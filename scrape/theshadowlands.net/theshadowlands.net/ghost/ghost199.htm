<p><b>Spooky Doctor</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: aidagamba@race.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My great aunt (now deceased) told me a story of when she was younger.&nbsp;
She cared for her elderly aunt, who, in her later years, was an invalid.&nbsp;
They lived in a rural community in Cuba, where there was only one doctor
who mostly made house-calls and who's "clinic" was his home.</b>
<br><b>One night, the elderly aunt ("N") felt uncomfortable on her bed.&nbsp;
She insisted that she be allowed to lay on the floor.&nbsp; Well, this
was the 1930's and respectable women did not lie on the floor.&nbsp; My
great aunt ("V") told N that she would not be more comfortable on the floor.&nbsp;
N insisted, and further explained that her doctor told her she could.&nbsp;
"When did he say that?" demanded V, who always with N when the doctor visited.&nbsp;
"Just now," said N, "he was just here."&nbsp; V brushed off the incident
as nonsense.</b>
<br><b>The next morning, V realized that N was low on her medication, so
after lunch, she walked to the doctor's house for a refill.&nbsp; The doctor's
daughter answered the door and informed V that the doctor had passed away
the previous evening.&nbsp; V remembered her aunt's account of how she
had seen the doctor, and relayed this news to the doctor's daughter.&nbsp;
The daughter responded by telling V that she was not the first to tell
this story ... apparently, the doctor visited all of his patients on the
night of his death.</b>

<p><b>Shadowpeople</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: myles59@cs.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't think me crazy, but let me tell you about
something we call</b>
<br><b>shadowpeople.</b>
<br><b>The first time I saw one was when I was 8 yrs. old we lived in a
three br.</b>
<br><b>house and my brother was about 7 months old. My mother had sent
me into the</b>
<br><b>kitchen to fix my brother a bottle before going to bed all the lights
were</b>
<br><b>out except the bathroom light which shone some light into the kitchen.
I</b>
<br><b>opened the icebox to fix the bottle and when I closed the door I
looked up</b>
<br><b>and standing in the frame of the door I saw the outline of a man.
there was</b>
<br><b>of course no one there just an out line like a shadow, needless
to say I was</b>
<br><b>frightened,so I ran back to the bedroom with my brother and mother(
I didn't</b>
<br><b>tell my mother what I'd seen) after that no matter where we lived
I would</b>
<br><b>encounter this entiies no matter. years later when I was grown up
and had</b>
<br><b>childern of my own I would continue to see them. Once when I had
went to vist</b>
<br><b>my family and at that time my parents were partying we had went
to bed and my</b>
<br><b>parents were still up. I had fallen asleep in my brothers bed with
me on the</b>
<br><b>left side, my son in the middle and he's older sister on the right
for some</b>
<br><b>reason I woke up and turned over and when I did i thought I saw
my father</b>
<br><b>bending over my daugther looking at my son being sleepy I said "go
to bed the</b>
<br><b>babys' a sleep" upon becoming fully awake I noticed that there was
nobody</b>
<br><b>there just a dark outline of a figure. which when I spoke to it,
it stood</b>
<br><b>straight up and turned and walked out. Now this is not the last
time I would</b>
<br><b>see such things, other members of my family admitted to seeing such
things.</b>
<br><b>My mother says that thier attracted to childern as there has alwaysbeen
kids</b>
<br><b>around when these things would appear I can't say that, thats' not
true.</b>

<p><b>Scared</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jiw1@cafes.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have a strange but true story.&nbsp; When I was younger my family
and I lived in an apartment building in Columbia, TN.&nbsp; I was two years
old at the time.&nbsp; I began to talk to a man that noone else could see.&nbsp;
Aparently I would not let him come out of the hallway because it scared
my mother.&nbsp; For months I talked with this man and was never afraid
of him.&nbsp; Then one night he told me he would not be back.&nbsp; He
moved his head to the side and blood ran out of his neck.&nbsp; Later after
we had moved my mother found out that a man had killed himself in the apartment
above ours a few years before we moved in.&nbsp; Another incident happened
to me when I was six years old in a church in Bell Buckle Tennessee.&nbsp;
My mother sister and I had gone to this church by mistake.&nbsp; On the
pugh beside us was a woman dressed in all black with a veil over her face.&nbsp;
She never moved the whole service.&nbsp; I was the only one who saw her.&nbsp;
It scared me so badly that I have never seen a spirit since.</b>

<p><b>Sitings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: smudry1@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello. I came upon your site as I was discussing</b>
<br><b>sightings with some friends of mine from Colombia, trying to find
accounts</b>
<br><b>of some of the stories that exist where I spent my teenage years...
historic</b>
<br><b>Yorktown, Virginia.</b>
<br><b>Consequently, after reading some of your articles, I feel it may
be an</b>
<br><b>appropriate forum to share and document for the first time some
of my own</b>
<br><b>personal experiences. I must say I should not be called a 'believer'
due to</b>
<br><b>my rigorous engineering background. But I am open minded and describe
my</b>
<br><b>accounts from a purely factual standpoint, making no assumptions
and</b>
<br><b>sticking only to the facts. Most of the stories are very subtle
in nature.</b>
<br><b>I ask that if you feel its appropriate to publish any of this on
your</b>
<br><b>website, you may retain my name and contact information for your
own</b>
<br><b>records, but please do not post it publicly.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, I will start with the town I was born in, Meriden Connecticut.
The</b>
<br><b>town itself had some interesting landmarks. There is, to this day
a burned</b>
<br><b>down half way house called the Altobello School that sits on the
side of a</b>
<br><b>mountain and is visible from most of the town. It is an old circa
1920's</b>
<br><b>industrial looking building. This would be an interesting research
subject</b>
<br><b>for you, with alot of stories surrounding it.</b>
<br><b>There is also a town in Connecticut called Dudleytown. As a youngster,
my</b>
<br><b>father would take us on weekend trips to go swimming in the mountains
etc.</b>
<br><b>On one particular saturday, my family was up in the northwestern
corner of</b>
<br><b>the state and I recognized the name of the town as being close to
where</b>
<br><b>Dudleytown was on the map. So I asked my dad to ask some locals
about it so</b>
<br><b>we could find it. The strange thing was the reaction of the people
that he</b>
<br><b>asked. My dad thought it was funny, but when asked, kind folks would
get a</b>
<br><b>blank, almost terrified look on their face, stare off into the distance,
and</b>
<br><b>walk away without saying another word. We continued to do this to
people</b>
<br><b>until we tired of it...</b>
<br><b>There is a house in another town called Southington that is supposed
to be</b>
<br><b>haunted by a demonic presence in the attic. This story was recounted
to me</b>
<br><b>by a tax assessor who supposedly demanded that he be let upstairs
against</b>
<br><b>the owners begging him not to open the door. He opened the door
to see walls</b>
<br><b>covered with scratches and claw marks.</b>
<br><b>My father told me at the time that our house was about 80 years
old. That</b>
<br><b>was about 25 years ago. I plan to go back and visit it someday.
Now growing</b>
<br><b>up I would always here footsteps up in the attic. It was always
really late</b>
<br><b>at night, or early in the morning. I didnt think much about it at
the time,</b>
<br><b>as I was little and didnt conceive of what I may actually be experiencing.</b>
<br><b>One afternoon, I was in the house alone with only my next door neighbor.
I</b>
<br><b>was about 13 or 14 yo at the time. From upstairs came a crashing
sound. It</b>
<br><b>struck me that it was the sound of the screens falling out of the
half a</b>
<br><b>dozen windows on our upstairs sun porch. We both heard it and jumped
up.</b>
<br><b>Without saying a word we ran upstairs to check the windows and found</b>
<br><b>nothing, absolutely nothing.</b>
<br><b>In this same house, about the time my grandmother was in the hospital
on her</b>
<br><b>last days of a bout with cancer, everyone in my family was at the
hospital</b>
<br><b>visitng except me. I was in the attic with a friend of mine. We
both heard</b>
<br><b>what sounded like footsteps coming up the attic stairs. Since we
were about</b>
<br><b>to commence doing something that I will not talk about, we both
jumped up</b>
<br><b>without saying a word. He ran to the shadows to hide our contraband,
and I</b>
<br><b>ran to the stairs to intercept whomever it was coming up the stairs.</b>
<br><b>I looked over the landing just in time to see the door to the attic
swing</b>
<br><b>open from a fully closed position. It then occured to me that whatever
was</b>
<br><b>on the stairs was going down not coming up. I grabbed my friend
and said</b>
<br><b>lets get out of here!</b>
<br><b>I also had an interesting 'UFO' experience. I was in first grade.
I remember</b>
<br><b>because I told the class the story the next day. It was sunset and
I was</b>
<br><b>lying in bed almost asleep. Something caused me to open my eyes,
and as I</b>
<br><b>looked out through the big windows on the sun porch I saw what appeared
to</b>
<br><b>be a large translucent orange glowing disc hovering over the trees.
The next</b>
<br><b>thing I remember, it was dark. The disc shrunk down to a small sphere
and</b>
<br><b>disappeared. It was not until years later that I thought about the
time</b>
<br><b>lapse.</b>
<br><b>At the age of seventeen my family moved to Yorktown, Virginia. The
first</b>
<br><b>unusual occurance was in the upstairs of a new garage building that
we had</b>
<br><b>built when we moved there. Out of the corner of my eye I saw the
distinct</b>
<br><b>outline of a person jumping from the shadows of the stairwell to
the crawl</b>
<br><b>space.</b>
<br><b>I then thought about the fact that with plain white sheetrock on
the walls,</b>
<br><b>and a bare lightbulb between myself and the wall, conditions were
perfect to</b>
<br><b>observe any kind of a 'thing' between the bulb and the wall. The
next thing</b>
<br><b>I thought about was that whatever it was may not have just been
a shadowy</b>
<br><b>figure, but may have absorbed some of the light thereby causing
a shadow on</b>
<br><b>the wall. The last thing that occured to me was that the figure
definitely</b>
<br><b>moved as if it was conscious of the fact that it was in a state
vulnerable</b>
<br><b>to detection and moved purposefully from the stairwell to the crawlspace
to</b>
<br><b>conceal itself immediately.</b>
<br><b>My final thought sent shivers down my back, and I left immediatly</b>
<br><b>afterwards. Whatever it was came up the stairs and headed directly
into a</b>
<br><b>crawlspace that lead down the wall directly next to where I was
standing.</b>
<br><b>Did my presence draw it up the stairs? Was it that important to
'it' to risk</b>
<br><b>detection to get close to me?</b>
<br><b>Friends of mine continued to express their uneasiness about being
in the</b>
<br><b>garage long after. We had a band that used to rehearse up there.
One night</b>
<br><b>during a break, the three of us that were up there heard the crashing
sound</b>
<br><b>of a toolbox tray of sockets from a socket wrench set just hit the
concrete</b>
<br><b>floor downstairs and spill. Investigation revealed nothing. The
floor was</b>
<br><b>clean and there was nothing on it that could have even come close
to making</b>
<br><b>the sound we heard.</b>
<br><b>For about a month one summer, we were building an addition onto
a house in</b>
<br><b>Urbana, Virginia that was built in the 1700's and belonged to a
tobacco</b>
<br><b>merchant. We were aware of the stories before we got there and hoped
to see</b>
<br><b>something. As we walked around the house one afternoon reflecting
on our</b>
<br><b>disappointment about the lack of activity, We noticed a strong,</b>
<br><b>sweet-smelling odor. My friend commented on it. We looked around
to find</b>
<br><b>nothing and went back to work. Later, we found out that it was a
part of the</b>
<br><b>story that the odor of fresh tobacco permeated the air whenever
the merchant</b>
<br><b>was present.</b>
<br><b>There is also an old Civil War hospital at the end of Waterview
Road that a</b>
<br><b>teacher at our High School occupied. We heard many stories about
the ring of</b>
<br><b>blood that they couldnt get out of the floor.</b>
<br><b>A very good friend of mine has been an electrician in Colonial Williamsburg</b>
<br><b>on the night shift for a number of years. You want to talk about
hair</b>
<br><b>raising stories!! I have begged him to give me the midnight tour
but he wont</b>
<br><b>go anywhere he doesnt absolutely have to. He has recounted many,
many</b>
<br><b>stories from being followed by shadows to hearing banshees hollering
at the</b>
<br><b>pub, to lights going out and coming back on, etc... There is a much
action</b>
<br><b>there at night as there is during the day when tourists crowd the
landscape.</b>
<br><b>I will get some more detailed and specific info from him if you
desire.</b>
<br><b>My final story, for the moment, is my own investigation of a very
well known</b>
<br><b>haunting in the West Point area of Virginia. I wont recount the
legend as it</b>
<br><b>is pretty famous. But for three weeks, every night leading up to
Halloween,</b>
<br><b>we spent all night on those railroad tracks. We walked from the
paper mill</b>
<br><b>all the way onto the Pamunky Indian reservation looking for the
spirit to</b>
<br><b>manifest itself. On Halloween night, around midnight it was drizzling
rain,</b>
<br><b>chilly, and we were right at the bridge on the tracks where this
whole</b>
<br><b>legend supposedly originated. We saw nothing!! Not to say the story
is bunk,</b>
<br><b>but in three weeks we saw nothing.</b>
<br><b>I have more, but these are all that I can recount for the moment.
Please</b>
<br><b>feel free to contact me, and good luck with the organization!! It
feels good</b>
<br><b>to get some of this off of my chest.</b>

<p><b>Relieved</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: pjsa@mtnia.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Okay, it all started when I was in middle school. First there was
the footsteps up above in the attic. Then they were on the stairs. It get
so loud we could hear it down stairs in the living room. Once in a while
we'd yell shut up, that didn't work. We heard them in day light it sacred
us, that is my sister and I. After&nbsp; awhile it didn't bother us except
when&nbsp; we were doing are homework. My mom heard it and came up with
all kinds of&nbsp; explanations Then one day a jar that was in the middle
of 2 other ones lifted up. This was happening while I was arguing with
my mom. It has happened a couple times. It flue at my mom, that was a shocker
to use. After that my mom started to believe me. Then she asked me if I
had done it ( yeah right like I have some kind of special power). These
jars site on top of are frigerator.On the side and my mom was across the
room.. After awhile everything stopped, I guess. I started to turn on my
music at night, so does my sister. We thought it had stopped, but new recent
thing happened. A pan just happened to slide of pile of dished,but instead
of falling. It waited a minute or so then fell to the ground. It was a
glass pan it fell all the way over by the stove, the stove is across the
room.It was face up and not a scratch on it. I wasn't arguing with my mom.
Nobody had gone in the kitchen for long while. I thought someone got in
the house, so I got a baseball bat out . I forgot to add that before the
jar or the pan, my sister heard someone knocking on her door. She would
knock back and it repeated her. I tried it, and lets say after that I didn't
do it ever again. Now my sister and I hear it sometimes call each others
name. We laugh, because we come down and ask what the other one wanted.
My moms had it happen, so have I. I've grown use it, actually makes me
laugh. I'm telling you this, because I've needed to tell someone for awhile.
Are house is the oldest one around. I think I just might&nbsp; research
it, and thanks for taking the time to read this if you get to.</b><b></b>

<br><b>House Built in 1902</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Shuirr@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>About 20 years ago I moved into an old house that was built about
1902. It</b>
<br><b>eventualy became a duplex for the last 15 years until it had a fire
in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen where it then sat empty for 2 rears. Then my husband, my
1 month old</b>
<br><b>baby boy and myself moved in. We bought it cheap and fixed it up.
About a</b>
<br><b>month or so after we moved in I went to bed early. As I layed there
I was</b>
<br><b>overcome with the feeling that someone was staring at me. Not just
staring</b>
<br><b>but, had their face wright up against mine. So I pulled the covers
over my</b>
<br><b>head. This did not make it go away. This very close feeling lasted
what it</b>
<br><b>felt like about 5 min. I was froze with fear. When it went away
I got up and</b>
<br><b>went downstairs and told my husband what happened. Of course he
laughed at me</b>
<br><b>and said it was probably just being in a new place. I thought he
could be</b>
<br><b>right but I didn't go to bed until he did! Now, I've never been
into the</b>
<br><b>ghost thing. Never gave it much thought.&nbsp; After that night
I had many moments</b>
<br><b>I felt like I was being watched. But only in the upstairs hallway
and just</b>
<br><b>inside the bedrooms.Not all the way into the bedrooms. For fear
of being</b>
<br><b>laughed at again I&nbsp; never talked about it any more. One New
Years my sister</b>
<br><b>and her new husband spent the night with us. While we were eating
breakfast</b>
<br><b>the next morning, my sisters husband looked at me and said,"You
have a</b>
<br><b>ghost!" "It hangs out in the upstairs hallway" and he raised his
arms up and</b>
<br><b>said "Right through here". My husband didn't laugh at me any more
but I could</b>
<br><b>tell he just thought we were both Looney! Over the next 16 years
I felt her</b>
<br><b>presence. I just felt it was a she. Almost every picture we took
of our son</b>
<br><b>had those spiraling white lines in them. (She hung around him alot).
We even</b>
<br><b>gave her a name. Betty. After I got used to her she didn't scare
me any more,</b>
<br><b>But, what did bother me was having that first feeling of her being
there and</b>
<br><b>knowing with all my heart there is SOMETHING there!</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: whoa4cj@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was also reading some of the ghost stories.&nbsp; They were very
interesting.</b>
<br><b>I have a very true tale of my own that I enclosed in this e-mail
if it is of</b>
<br><b>any interest.</b>
<br><b>I remember, no joke now, it was a late November night.&nbsp; My
good friend and I</b>
<br><b>were planning on making a double date and going up to Virginia City</b>
<br><b>graveyard.&nbsp; Being the young fools that we are we really didn’t
see the harm</b>
<br><b>in doing so.&nbsp; Being overly excited my friend and I decided
that we would go</b>
<br><b>up and “scoop” a place to park.&nbsp; And since neither of us knew
where this</b>
<br><b>park would be we would find it making it easier the night of our
date!</b>
<br><b>So around five o’clock my friend and I drove the half hour drive
up to</b>
<br><b>Virginia City.&nbsp; As were driving down the hill toward the city
we both</b>
<br><b>started to become a little uneasy.&nbsp; We thought that it was
just nerves</b>
<br><b>because we were both excited.&nbsp; D, that’s my friend, got the
feeling that we</b>
<br><b>were defiantly going to see something, thought good or bad she didn’t
know.</b>
<br><b>We pulled into a look out area.&nbsp; We saw the graveyard but didn’t
see a way</b>
<br><b>to get down there.&nbsp; So we jumped back in the car and decided
to find the</b>
<br><b>road leading down to the cemetery.</b>
<br><b>Now I must stop for a moment to explain that D drove a two-door
jeep, with a</b>
<br><b>stick shift.&nbsp; Now the passenger side door does not open and
the passenger</b>
<br><b>has to crawl over the drivers side, over the sick shift and the
parking</b>
<br><b>break in order to take their seat.&nbsp; Now her car is also very
small and a</b>
<br><b>little on the older side so it does not harness the kind of power
that it</b>
<br><b>used to.</b>
<br><b>Back to my story, we drove and found the street that lead to the
graveyard.</b>
<br><b>Driving down it we were both getting really excited, hoping to see</b>
<br><b>something?&nbsp; Pulling around the bend we saw the gates that blocked
off anyone</b>
<br><b>from driving up into the graves.&nbsp; D turned the car around in
order to make</b>
<br><b>the “fear flight” easier.&nbsp; Which I must say I am glad she did!</b>
<br><b>We both climbed out of the car into the rather chilly night.&nbsp;
There was no</b>
<br><b>fence that surrounded the cemetery, just the two rusted iron gates
that</b>
<br><b>blocked of passage of cars.&nbsp; The graves were set far back on
a hill.&nbsp; There</b>
<br><b>was a road that immediately branched off between going down to the
mines and</b>
<br><b>going up to the graves, otherwise the parking lot was set on a hill
and</b>
<br><b>before the edge there set very large rocks that a person could climb
over</b>
<br><b>but not a car.&nbsp; Well we climbed over these rocks and, being
a full moon,</b>
<br><b>started to walk up the road toward the graves.&nbsp; Suddenly I
was overwhelmed</b>
<br><b>with an irrational fear to leave immediately.&nbsp; I told D that
we should go</b>
<br><b>and I turned and started to run.&nbsp; D stayed glued to the spot
for a moment</b>
<br><b>then turned and ran after me.&nbsp; I was in the car when she ran
up to it and</b>
<br><b>jumped in.&nbsp; We immediately drove away.&nbsp; Felling foolish,
I talked D into</b>
<br><b>turning the car around and just going and sitting, in the car, and
wait.&nbsp; So</b>
<br><b>we did.&nbsp; D turned the car off, but left the battery on so we
had music.&nbsp; Not</b>
<br><b>even a second passed when right between us a rather loud, hoarse
and raspy</b>
<br><b>whisper said something.&nbsp; D and I turned to each other; we thought
it was the</b>
<br><b>other one, until we saw the blood drain from each other’s faces.&nbsp;
Without</b>
<br><b>another word D turned the key threw the car in reverse.&nbsp; As
she turned</b>
<br><b>around something grabbed the tail end of the car and would not let
go!&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>radio turned all the way up, neither one of us touched it!&nbsp;
Finally D</b>
<br><b>floored the gas petal and we were off.&nbsp; The whole way home
neither of us</b>
<br><b>looked in the back seat because something was still there!&nbsp;
We turned the</b>
<br><b>radio on.&nbsp; Twice it, all by itself, turned to static with a
menacing sound</b>
<br><b>trying to communicate and twice we flipped it to a music station.</b>
<br><b>Well needless to say we will never do that again.&nbsp; But honest
to god this is</b>
<br><b>a true story.&nbsp; It still gives me the chills, and I think that
I am hearing</b>
<br><b>things just writing it.</b><b></b>

<br><b>a strong intuititon for the unusual since I was a small child. When
you grow</b>
<br><b>up so young with special insights, you often make light of you experiences</b>
<br><b>with yourself. What I mean is that what seemed a natural situation
to me at</b>
<br><b>such a young age would seem so bizzare to most people. I have kept
so much to</b>
<br><b>myself all these years and have now decided that I should reach
out to others</b>
<br><b>who may be having or had similar experiences.</b>
<br><b>3:33's...How that number ending up scaring the crap out of me. I
have had</b>
<br><b>touched by probably many entities over the years in one way or another.
I</b>
<br><b>usually would try to break any contact the moment it occurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I seem to</b>
<br><b>attract spirits,entities, what have you when I am in that not awake,
but not</b>
<br><b>in a deep sleep quite yet time. I have always felt that they come
to me when</b>
<br><b>my guard is down and I believe they feed off my energy or better
yet...try to</b>
<br><b>posess my body for a brief moment. I have broken away from so many
"attacks"</b>
<br><b>over the years that I often can brush it aside and actually go back
to sleep</b>
<br><b>afterwards. It feels really strange to write this, and stranger
yet to share</b>
<br><b>it with people I do not know.</b>
<br><b>During the time of the 333's I lived in a city duplex that was built
around</b>
<br><b>the turn of the century.Many nights I would feel an attack coming
on and</b>
<br><b>would break free of the hold that this entity had on me. Our clock
radio</b>
<br><b>would glow the 3:33 as shivers ran down my body and if I had woke
my wife I</b>
<br><b>would tell her I was fine and not to worry. My wife is aware of
my unusual</b>
<br><b>gift/curse and has been desensitized over the years.</b>
<br><b>She believes me I think but she would rather not know of the things
for</b>
<br><b>obvious reasons. I t must be a little unnerving for your spouse
to wake you</b>
<br><b>up from a dead sleep...I feel the spirit as it approaches me,sometimes
I see</b>
<br><b>shadows but it is more of just sensing something is trying to control
me.</b>
<br><b>Often I am quite petrified at the onset,and I freeze up, probably
a natural</b>
<br><b>reaction of fear.If I can I try to dismiss the spirit vocally. Often
my words</b>
<br><b>come out gargled and unintelligable. My wife has witnessed me at
this moment,</b>
<br><b>and has been terrified at the sound coming from me. She does not
know if she</b>
<br><b>should touch me or wake me for she feels I am having a nightmare,what
an</b>
<br><b>understatement!!! I usually order the entity to go away, or damn
you...be</b>
<br><b>gone is another favorite of mine. So when I "breakfree" and am trying
to</b>
<br><b>catch my breathe my wife will ask..."Did it happen again?" And I
either tell</b>
<br><b>her not to worry,I am fine or had a nightmare sorry. Sorry but it
was just a</b>
<br><b>freaked out ghost that thought I looked like like an easy meal for
the</b>
<br><b>night,go back to sleep,dear.</b><b></b>

I have a story that not to many people beleive, because i'm only 11 years
old. but i have a story. I had been living with for four years. It all
started when i moved in. My sister has a bedroom in the basement of our
two-story house, she says that when she was in her room (the door wide
open) a teenage boy walked into her room but she wasn't scared he went
right to her closet and didn't even look at her.She said that he was dressed
in overalls and no shirt under them, he was very pale and had a straw hat
on.(Which is weird because we live on old farmland)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
one day doing the lanundry she said she saw him again and he smiled at
her but only for a spilt second then he disappeared. That happened only
the first year we were there, then about 6 months later it started again.
Once i ran down the stairs to go to my sister's room and suddenly everything
was white it was only for like 2 seconds then i rao answer so i went down
to her room and she was sleeping. I got really scared and ran up into my
room shut the door and turned on the T.V. i kept hearing knocking like
on the wall and the only room near mine was my parents and they weren't
home. I stayed awake until my mother came home then finally fell asleep.
I need help if there's something in my house i want to know but i'm to
scared to find out!!!</b><b></b>

<p><b>I Live in a Haunted House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Ajasmine1@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Ok. I'm currently 14 years old and live in a once haunted house.
I have a few</b>
<br><b>experiences with the paranormal that have</b>
<br><b>happened this year. But I would have to explain the background of
my school</b>
<br><b>which is where it all happened. This is a bit long.</b>
<br><b>My school was once the site of an indian Burial ground. Then some
projects</b>
<br><b>were built on top of them. When they tore the</b>
<br><b>projects down I think they moved the bodies of the burial ground
but I don't</b>
<br><b>really know. Now that that is out of the way on</b>
<br><b>with my experiences.</b>
<br><b>My first experience was in my music class. I was sitting in my seat,
bored</b>
<br><b>out of my mind as I began to drift off. I was half</b>
<br><b>asleep when darkness had surrounded me. The droning of my teacher
gradually</b>
<br><b>drifted off as smoke began to drift around. I</b>
<br><b>just stood in this darkness as these two eyes began to form. They
began to</b>
<br><b>move toward me, a body forming along with it. It</b>
<br><b>was about 5 feet away from me when I woke up. The person next to
me was</b>
<br><b>nudging my shoulder and said that I was kicking</b>
<br><b>the table in my sleep.</b>
<br><b>My second and more scary experience was in my math class. I had
entered the</b>
<br><b>room at the begging of the class and sat down</b>
<br><b>when I began to feel a slight pain in my back. I struggled to pay
attention</b>
<br><b>to the lesson but then began to feel hits all over my</b>
<br><b>body. It hurt to hold my head up so I laid it down. That was when
sharper</b>
<br><b>pains dug into my back. I began to get scared as I</b>
<br><b>felt something like teeth or nails dragging down my legs. Then I
felt punches</b>
<br><b>into my arms and my head. I finally lifted my head</b>
<br><b>up and asked if I could go to the bathroom. I was close to tears
from all the</b>
<br><b>pain i was going through. I left the class and the</b>
<br><b>pain immediately stopped somehow. I quickly went and splashed some
water on</b>
<br><b>my face before returning back to the class. As</b>
<br><b>soon as I stepped into the room again, I felt a sharp kick in my
leg that</b>
<br><b>almost made me cry out in pain. I practically limped</b>
<br><b>back to my seat as a knee dug into my back. As soon as i sat down
there was</b>
<br><b>this whispering in my ear saying '15 stories. It</b>
<br><b>was 15 stories.' I was really scared then. My teacher came back
and kept</b>
<br><b>asking me if i was all right and of course I couldn't</b>
<br><b>tell her. So i just said i was tired and had a headache as a punch
landed on</b>
<br><b>my shoulder. It was about 10 minutes to the end of</b>
<br><b>the class when i felt this large punch to my head that made me just
fall over</b>
<br><b>my desk in pain. Everybody turned to look at me</b>
<br><b>when that happened so i had to lie and say that I had bit my tongue.
Finally</b>
<br><b>when we were able to leave I had to slip out of my</b>
<br><b>seat onto the floor and grab my books. I LIMPED out of the class
as the</b>
<br><b>punches became much more violent as I neared the</b>
<br><b>door. As soon as I went out they died away as this voice whispered
again, '15</b>
<br><b>stories Alicia. 15 stories.'</b>
<br><b>The third and last time at that school was in the math class again.
The pains</b>
<br><b>were less this time but still painful. I fell asleep</b>
<br><b>somehow and was in this funeral home or something. I went into this
room</b>
<br><b>where an open coffin lay, this tall lady with long</b>
<br><b>brown hair and her feet hanging out of the coffin. I went to get
a closer</b>
<br><b>look at her face when it suddenly slammed shut and</b>
<br><b>sunk into the floor. I then heard this small voice as I turned around
to see</b>
<br><b>a small 8-year-old with long brown hair and holding a</b>
<br><b>little doll. She then said to me as she lifted her head, 'My names
Rebecca!</b>
<br><b>I'm 8! I like you!' She then reached out and touched</b>
<br><b>my hand as I woke up. It was the end of the class and I felt strangely</b>
<br><b>upbeat. I went out of the class and felt like i was 8 again.</b>
<br><b>I then went into my homeroom as I faded away almost. My friends
told me later</b>
<br><b>that I acted like an immature little kid. I believe</b>
<br><b>to this day that she had possessed me. I never did see her again
after that</b>
<br><b>day.</b>
<br><b>This is all true and very scary. After the last incident i never
ever was</b>
<br><b>bothered again by anything paranormal at that school</b>
<br><b>again somehow.</b>

<p><b>Parents Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: smokeylonesome@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My parents house in Duncan, Oklahoma is haunted.&nbsp; The ghosts
did not show themselves for a couple of years except as an illusion seen
from the corner of ones eye.&nbsp; Finally, they began to come into my
Mom's room almost every night as she was sleeping and they would wake her
by bumping her bed.&nbsp; Most thought she was dreaming.&nbsp; Then, they
started showing themselves to a few others.&nbsp; My daughter, grand-daughter,
my sisters and myself.&nbsp; It seems no one else could see them.&nbsp;
There are three ghosts.&nbsp; A heavy set woman, a man in stripped bib
overalls, and a thin woman.&nbsp; They only stand and look at us but if
you don't look at them, they will bump your bed and make sounds like paper
rattling until you acknowledge them.&nbsp; It's as if they just want you
to know they are there.&nbsp; They have clapped their hands or just walked
through a room.&nbsp; You can not make out what the features of their faces
are as they are a little foggy.&nbsp; They have never attempted to harm
any one or intentionally frighten us.&nbsp; They are just looking around.&nbsp;
I have been touched by one of the entities on two occasions but I don't
know which one.&nbsp; They will also move items to other locations from
time to time.&nbsp; They always appeared to be drawn to me and my Mom the
most.</b>

<p><b>Our Encounter with a Haunted House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MattAbbyHarris@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Sometime in the 80's my sister, and I visited a haunted house. A
mutual</b>
<br><b>friend knew of such a place somewhere located in upstate New York.</b>
<br><b>Arrangements were made to follow the caretaker to the haunted house.
Since</b>
<br><b>this experience occurred quite a few years ago I am fuzzy concerning
the</b>
<br><b>story about it's haunting. What I do remember about the entire experience,</b>
<br><b>and how it affected me remains as clear in my mind as though it
happened</b>
<br><b>yesterday. As we were getting near the house my sister brought to
my</b>
<br><b>attention the absence of ordinary animal life. In addition, an unnatural</b>
<br><b>quiet filled the air and extended for quite some distance around
the</b>
<br><b>periphery of the property. Upon approaching closer to the abandoned
house, we</b>
<br><b>entered through the doorway, and the small group among of us observed
an</b>
<br><b>obvious sadness. Inside the dimly lit entryway, we immediately noticed
all</b>
<br><b>the personal possessions to be trashed. Brand new clothes (with
pricetags</b>
<br><b>still attached), dishes and papers littered the floor. I carefully
walked</b>
<br><b>through this debris into the kitchen to look around. An uncomfortable</b>
<br><b>sensation gently bore down upon my psyche. A sense of urgency hastened
my</b>
<br><b>investigation. Before exiting the vacant structure, I bent over
to collect a</b>
<br><b>small number of souvenirs. After returning to the car, we all breathed
a</b>
<br><b>collective sigh of relief. That palpable sense of melancholy immediately</b>
<br><b>diminished and faded completely as we drove away from this unpleasant
site.</b>

<br><b>I would like to share my most vivid,obvious paranormal experience
with you.</b>
<br><b>I was about 10-11 years old at the time. One night i drempt that
a little boy covered in blue flame was coming out of my closet. Just the
then i awoke to see the same boy dressed in a red t shirt, blue jeans and
a baseball cap standing in front of my closet. For the next 2 weeks i slept
in my parents room. Nothing else happened for a few months and I never
spoke of it to anyone. One night i had a friend sleep over. She awoke in
the middle of the night to the same boy standing near the closet.I didn't
see him again for the longest time. Then one day i walked downstairs and
saw the little boy looking at me from behind the couch. neither of us moved
for a few seconds then he ducked behind the couch. when i went to see where
he had gone noone was there.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Old Mr. Par</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Legend654@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Old Mr. Par</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; When my family first moved into the house we're living
in now (I was about 2) there was an old man, Mr. Par, who lived next door.
He didn't like kids and he didn't like us. He had no family and was very
mean and cold-hearted. One day, years later, he died in his sleep of a
heart-attack, and about 4 years after that, a woman named Heather and her
baby boy, Isaiah, moved into the house. She didn't know about a man dying
in the house. One night she was woken up by the sounds of pots and pans
and silver-wear rattling in the kitchen. She at first thought that it was
either her cat, Carrie, or her dog, Sidney, but when she looked up Carrie
was sleeping at the end of the bed and Sidney on the floor next to her.
She went to go check on Isaiah to make sure he was alright and then left
the baby with her dog and cat (whom she trusted very much) and went to
see what was happening in the kitchen. The rattleing grew louder as she
got closer and even more violent. When she finally reached the kitchen
she flipped on the lights.... the rattling stopped and nothing was out
of place. When Heather told my mom about this, my mom told her about Mr.
Par and Heather was shocked. Sometimes you can see the figure of an old
man standing in the upstairs window of the house.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Hard to Believe</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gothicrombie@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name's Stefan, I'm 16, and I'm from St. Catharines Canada. I</b>
<br><b>recall having a couple ghost experiences within my life so far which
are</b>
<br><b>maybe hard to believe. I used to live with my mom until I was about
12 years</b>
<br><b>old and I moved out with my Dad afterwards. Anyway when I lived
with my mom,</b>
<br><b>I lived in this townhouse. It had 2 floors and a basement. I remember
trying</b>
<br><b>to sleep and being startled from noise in the basement. Either my
mom or me</b>
<br><b>always locked the basement door after we left the basement. There
were these</b>
<br><b>windows in the basement that were at ground level outside. My Dad
put up</b>
<br><b>these bars to prevent anyone from getting in our house. There was
no way</b>
<br><b>anyone could have gotten in the basement. I always heard things
being moved</b>
<br><b>around and I heard loud footsteps on the basement stairs. I know
I was</b>
<br><b>sleeping on the second floor but it was possible to hear those basement</b>
<br><b>steps. I remember nights where I heard something coming up the basement</b>
<br><b>stairs and unlocking the basement door. Then seconds later I heard
footsteps</b>
<br><b>on my main stairwell up to the second floor. The 'thing' got to
the top of</b>
<br><b>the stairs and just stopped there. I was cuddled in bed and I was
terrified</b>
<br><b>because I didn't know if it was a burglar or what it was. I heard
that</b>
<br><b>continously but not every night, only once in awhile.</b>
<br><b>My 2nd story, I actually saw something. This was when I was 14 living
with</b>
<br><b>my Dad. I had woken up early in the morning on a winter day. I went
to look</b>
<br><b>out the window to see it was still dark outside. Now I live in an
apartment</b>
<br><b>on the 5th floor. Well, what caught my attention outside was the
parking</b>
<br><b>lot. It's 2 levels and there's a ramp to the 2nd level and the lot
was about</b>
<br><b>50 ft from my building. On the ramp I saw someone. It was a girl
dressed in</b>
<br><b>a white dress and she had blonde hair. She was looking up at me
in my</b>
<br><b>window. I looked at her for about 20 seconds and she never moved
at all. She</b>
<br><b>just kept looking up at my me. I became a little frightened so I
thought I</b>
<br><b>just go back to sleep. I ended up falling asleep. When I woke up
again in</b>
<br><b>the day light, I didn't see the girl out my window nor did I ever
see her</b>
<br><b>again after that. I have no idea why she was there. I know it wasn't
just</b>
<br><b>some normal person.</b>

<p><b>Black Shadow</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cassidnc@EXCHANGE1.DREXEL.EDU</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I, like everyone else, am not sure if this really happened or not.
I was</b>
<br><b>living with my aunt at the time. I was just turning 19 years old.
I was</b>
<br><b>asleep in the back bedroom, which was like a two-by-four, and the
bed was on</b>
<br><b>the floor. (It was one of those race car beds, so it wasn't very
high.)</b>
<br><b>Anyway, in the middle of the night I suddenly woke up (at least
I think i</b>
<br><b>did).I glanced over at the door, which I always kept closed, and
it was</b>
<br><b>slightly open. Then it looked as if a black shadow were seeping
into the</b>
<br><b>room. There was no figure to it, just a shadow, like smoke. When
i tried to</b>
<br><b>sit up I couldn't. It was as if whatever it was kept me down. I
ws</b>
<br><b>paralyzed, and could barely breathe. I felt like I was being strangled.
My</b>
<br><b>one shoulder was lifted slightly off of the mattress, while the
other one</b>
<br><b>was pinned down. This lasted only a few seconds, but it felt like
an</b>
<br><b>eternity. Finally I was able to get up and use the bathroom. When
i stood</b>
<br><b>up, the door was shut all the way, the way it was when I fell asleep.</b>
<br><b>A few days later we were using the ouija board, and I asked the
person we</b>
<br><b>were talking to if they knew what it was. They said it was a warning
to quit</b>
<br><b>smoking, that if I don't, that's the way I'll end up breathing,
and</b>
<br><b>eventually die.</b>
<br><b>I know this sounds strange, and maybe it was a dream, or my imaginatio,
but</b>
<br><b>if it was, it was the most vivid I've evr had. If you could offer
any</b>

<br><b>July of '97</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: TaysMeg@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My family and I moved into my house in July of '97. When I first
moved here I</b>
<br><b>kinda got a weird feeling from it. I remember one of the first nights
I was</b>
<br><b>in my room there was a trash bag full of stuff sitting on the floor
I just</b>
<br><b>happened to look at it and it moved. Not very far, but it happened.
I told my</b>
<br><b>Mom what I had seen and she tried to make up explanations saying
that it was</b>
<br><b>probably just air from the vent. I didnt really take it to heart
until one</b>
<br><b>night I was half asleep in my room and I heard a sound coming from
my</b>
<br><b>bathroom like someone was messing with the plastic bag that was
in the trash</b>
<br><b>bag. It kinda scared me because the noise was frantic and it was
loud. The</b>
<br><b>next morning when I got up, everything was fine. Again, I just shrugged
it</b>
<br><b>off, I figured that I was probably dreaming or what not. I dont
remember when</b>
<br><b>but it wasnt too long after that incident. I was sleeping in my
bed and I</b>
<br><b>felt this warm breeze blowing on my face so I kinda woke up I looked
above</b>
<br><b>me, and sorta floating above me was an outline of a person. The
first thing I</b>
<br><b>thought of was Nan, which is my grandmother that passed in 1996.
For some</b>
<br><b>reason it scared me and I tried to switch on my light that was right
next to</b>
<br><b>my bed and it started flickering off and on really fast. I am going
to be</b>
<br><b>honest this lamp is old and it has old wires, but I have NEVER seen
it go on</b>
<br><b>and off like that so fast. I hit the lamp to make it stop and it
just went</b>
<br><b>off. I tried again to turn it back on but it didnt work at all.
I jumped out</b>
<br><b>of bed and turned on the ceiling lights and everything was fine.
Needless to</b>
<br><b>say, I slept with the lights on for the rest of the night. I believe
that was</b>
<br><b>in November or October of 1998, because I remember Christmas wasnt
to long</b>
<br><b>after that. On Christmas Eve my step dad at the time went to the
cemetary</b>
<br><b>where Nan is buried and he saw her sitting on her grave. He told
us that she</b>
<br><b>waved at him, then disappeared. When he was walking back to his
truck, a man</b>
<br><b>was coming from the same direction and called for my step dad's
attention.</b>
<br><b>When the guy caught up to my step dad he asked him if he had seen
anything.</b>
<br><b>My step dad looked at him and said "Yea, did you see it." and the
guy replied</b>
<br><b>yes.&nbsp; Nothing weird has happened for a while but in the Fall
of 2000, I was</b>
<br><b>down in our basement playing pinball. I swore that I kept seeing
lights on</b>
<br><b>the walls. I didnt like what I was feeling so I went to go get my
2 Labs and</b>
<br><b>my black lab came down with me but for some reason the yellow lab
wouldnt</b>
<br><b>come down. Knowing that dogs have a sixth sense I turned off everything
and</b>
<br><b>came upstairs. I still am not sure if I believe that my house is
haunted.</b>
<br><b>Between my stepdad, my little brother, my mom and I;&nbsp; I was
the only person</b>
<br><b>that has ever felt anything.</b><b></b>

<br><b>the year of 1995. After we drove alittle closer, he was walking
on one of</b>
<br><b>the paths we made with the four-wheeler. Then after a couple of
seconds, he</b>
<br><b>just disappeared. So, we went back to the house, told our mom's,
and just</b>
<br><b>went back to the woods again to see if he was still there but he
wasn't. So</b>
<br><b>I suddenly asked my mom, "Was that any of his favorite places to

she walked</b>
<br><b>with him most of the times. And I have never seen him since. I was

<br><b>My Grandfather ( Goodbye)</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: A_DeLeon@compaq.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>well, i have many stories to tell about the many experiences that
i have with "ghosts" as you can sya but sometimes i see things in my dreams
that always come true no matter how good or bad they are, i remember that
last year in 2000 i was sleeping in my bed when i see my grandfather and
he told me that i should take care of my mother no matter what happens
and that i should keep on studying because i would get far with a degree,
i was a little scared because in that time he was living and breathing
and the weird part of the dream was that he was in white like an angel
and he was with his family that had past away,but that i had never met,
i remember that i dreamed about him on a saturday, the next day my family
called him to ask him about his health and he said that he was fine but
i didn't belive him because i knew something was gonna happen. i told my
father about the dream and he said to stop watching t.v and to do more
homework but he didn't belive me anyways monday passed and in the middle
of the night of tuesday morning i felt a shiver in my body and i started
to cry for no reason then i went to school on tuesday and everything was
ok except that i was wearing everything black with a white shirt and then
my father comes to the school crying and i see him and he tells me that
my grandfather passed away at 1:30am ,but i got the shiver at 1:00 i think
that it was telling him that it was time to go but that i should know first
. in my mind i think that this has been the most beautiful experience in
my life because i got the chance to see him in my dream and i said "goodbye
grandfather i love you and visit me"&nbsp; maybe that is why i feel a nice
friendly presence around me.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Little Girl and Her Horse</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kellwil@trib.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; My cousin and I used to live in a small country suburb in</b>
<br><b>the Big Horn Basin in Thermopolis, Wyoming. His family lived 2</b>
<br><b>houses down from our family and we often went into the</b>
<br><b>surrounding foothills to catch lizards. One evening we decided to</b>
<br><b>go farther into the hills than we ever had, even though it was getting</b>
<br><b>dark outside. We wandered over the hills for a little while, and
we</b>
<br><b>didn't know why, but it seemed as if something were almost</b>
<br><b>drawing us further and further. Suddenly we both looked over at
this</b>
<br><b>hilltop next to us, both of us at the same time. There was nothing</b>
<br><b>there. I asked him if he saw something, and he said he did.</b>
<br><b>Apparently we had both seen what looked like a little girl out of
the</b>
<br><b>corner of eyes. The way I remember her looking was she had long</b>
<br><b>black hair, was wearing a red dress with a big red bow in her hair.</b>
<br><b>Both of us could only see her out of the corner of our eyes, for
as</b>
<br><b>soon as we would turn to look she would disappear. Well, this</b>
<br><b>really freaked us out and it was almost dark so we turned around</b>
<br><b>and headed back to the road leading to our houses. Needless to</b>
<br><b>say we walked quite fast. Then suddenly we both just froze in our</b>
<br><b>tracks and looked at each other. My cousin said, "Did you hear</b>
<br><b>that??" and when I said I had we both took off running. What we</b>
<br><b>heard were the sounds of a single horse's hooves running on the</b>
<br><b>small dirt path we were walking on. Although the hoof beats</b>
<br><b>sounded awfully close behind us, we turned to see and there was</b>
<br><b>nothing. We were right in the middle of a small valley, so we could</b>
<br><b>see for quite a distance behind us. We were still running when we</b>
<br><b>got the mouth of this little canyon, and we turned one last time
to</b>
<br><b>see if we could see anything, because the whole time the hoof</b>
<br><b>beats got louder and louder. Still nothing. This time the hoof beats</b>
<br><b>were very loud, and when I stood still I could even feel the vibrations</b>
<br><b>in the ground, as if the horse was fairly large and running right
past</b>
<br><b>me. I've never been afraid of horses, but it was like there was</b>
<br><b>something about this "ghost horse" that terrified me. I got a mental</b>
<br><b>picture of this horse, it was large and black with bright red eyes.</b>
<br><b>My cousin and I were standing on the paved road at the mouth of</b>
<br><b>this small canyon trying to catch our breath when we both looked</b>
<br><b>up at a large hill. I could see the girl standing next to the horse
on</b>
<br><b>the top of this hill, just watching us, but when I looked directly
at</b>
<br><b>them they were gone. It was really creepy because it looked like</b>
<br><b>the wind was blowing the girl's long hair across her body and the</b>
<br><b>horse's mane was also blowing, even though it was a peaceful</b>
<br><b>warm summer evening with no breeze at all. We were so scared</b>
<br><b>we ran the 2 miles to my house. Later I began to think maybe it</b>
<br><b>was the child of one of the wagon trains that passed through here
a</b>
<br><b>hundred + years ago going West, and maybe she died of a</b>
<br><b>common disease that children died of by the hundreds back in</b>
<br><b>those days. Then one evening my friend's boyfriend was driving me</b>
<br><b>home and when we went past the small dirt trail leading from the</b>
<br><b>paved road into the canyon he asked me if I had ever seen the</b>
<br><b>ghost child that lived in there. I was shocked because my cousin</b>
<br><b>and I had never told anyone about what had happened because we</b>
<br><b>knew they wouldn't believe us. I told him that I had seen something</b>
<br><b>in there, and he said his brother had seen it, although he could</b>
<br><b>only see it out of the corner of his eye, and whenever he looked</b>
<br><b>directly at it, it just disappeared. That really freaked me out.
Then I</b>
<br><b>started experiencing strange things at my house. My family used</b>
<br><b>to travel to Worland which is 32 miles away to visit my</b>
<br><b>grandparents but I seldom got to go because I always had to do</b>
<br><b>homework. Well, one night I was on the bottom floor watching TV</b>
<br><b>when I could hear footsteps in the top floor hall. This hall is
at the</b>
<br><b>very top of the second flight of stairs, and at the other end of
the</b>
<br><b>hall is my bedroom. I knew no one was home, so I thought maybe</b>
<br><b>it was my German Shepherd, even though these footsteps sounded</b>
<br><b>like a grown man. So I went up the first flight of stairs to the</b>
<br><b>second floor and looked up the stairs to my bedroom door. There</b>
<br><b>was nothing. So I walked back down to the bottom floor and began</b>
<br><b>watching TV again. As soon as I sat down I heard it again. It</b>
<br><b>sounded as if a large man was walking from my room to the end of</b>
<br><b>the hallway. I began to get up and go see if it was my dog, but</b>
<br><b>when I stood up I noticed she was laying next to the couch, looking</b>
<br><b>at the ceiling completely silent, her head cocked to one side. I
was</b>
<br><b>so scared I locked all the doors and got my mother's pistol. This</b>
<br><b>happened every week when my parents would leave me home</b>
<br><b>alone. Then one night the phone would ring every couple of</b>
<br><b>minutes, with dead air on the other end. This went on for almost
an</b>
<br><b>hour, and the last time it happened for some reason I got this</b>
<br><b>horrible chill down my spine and the feeling that the calls were</b>
<br><b>coming from INSIDE my house, even though I locked all the doors</b>
<br><b>immediately after my parents walked out. I was so terrified I again</b>
<br><b>grabbed my mother's pistol and then I called my parents in</b>
<br><b>Worland and told them they needed to come home right away.</b>
<br><b>Since it was a half hour trip and my parents could hear the utter</b>
<br><b>terror in my voice they called my aunt (the one who lived 2 houses</b>
<br><b>down) and asked her to come pick me up and take me to her</b>
<br><b>house until they got home. They didn't leave me home alone after</b>
<br><b>that, which is where another story comes in. One evening I came</b>
<br><b>home from school and saw that my bedroom light was on, which</b>
<br><b>was strange because I never turn my light on in the morning and
I</b>
<br><b>hadn't been in my room since that morning. I thought that maybe</b>
<br><b>my sister was snooping through my room so I ran inside to catch</b>
<br><b>her in the act, but she was on the bottom floor watching TV. When</b>
<br><b>I walked up to my room, the door was open, and I NEVER EVER</b>
<br><b>leave my door open when I'm not in my room. It's habit. So I was</b>
<br><b>convinced it had been my sister. I walked upstairs, turned off my</b>
<br><b>light and shut my door then went downstairs to watch TV. About 10</b>
<br><b>minutes later I walked upstairs to the kitchen for a drink and as
I</b>
<br><b>looked up the second flight of stairs on my way to the kitchen I</b>
<br><b>saw that my door was open and the light was on. I went back down</b>
<br><b>the stairs and my sister was on the computer next to the TV, the</b>
<br><b>same place she had been the whole time I was downstairs. I got</b>
<br><b>angry and yelled at her to stay out of my room, but she insisted</b>
<br><b>that she had not gone in my room. so I set up a trap for her. I</b>
<br><b>turned off my light and closed my door tightly, then walked around</b>
<br><b>the counter into the kitchen and watched the bottom of the stairs</b>
<br><b>that lead up to my room. I couldn't see my room, but I had a clear</b>
<br><b>view of the bottom of the stairs and there is no other way to my</b>
<br><b>room but those stairs. I knew my sister was downstairs on the</b>
<br><b>computer, so there I waited for 10 long minutes. Finally I got bored</b>
<br><b>and walked to the bottom of the stairs. When I looked up I saw that</b>
<br><b>my door was open and the light was on. I knew that my sister had</b>
<br><b>not been up there because she was still downstairs. My best friend</b>
<br><b>thought maybe the wind or something knocked it open when I told</b>
<br><b>her th enext day, so she came out to my house the next evening to</b>
<br><b>investigate. When she tried to open my door she had to kick it</b>
<br><b>because it latches so tightly when it's closed. That convinced her</b>
<br><b>that there was no way the wind or my dog could have accidentally</b>
<br><b>opened it. I think our ghost is not evil, but is attatched to my
room.</b>
<br><b>One other night I was laying in bed and there were some papers</b>
<br><b>laying on my floor. I was just about asleep when I heard the paper</b>
<br><b>crinkle up, as if someone had stepped on it. Then there were</b>
<br><b>footsteps in the paper heading to my bed, they were very loud and
I</b>
<br><b>was very scared, and just before they got to my bed, they stopped.</b>
<br><b>And I never heard them again. I still get creepy feelings in my</b>
<br><b>house, however, whether I'm home alon or not, particularly on th</b>
<br><b>bottom floor (where I'm at right now), my room, and my bathroom.</b>
<br><b>These are all very creepy rooms in my house for some reason, and</b>
<br><b>my best friend won't even use my bathroom by herself because she</b>
<br><b>gets bad vibes from it, too.</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;The Soccer Ghost</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of summers ago I spent the summer with
my rich</b>
<br><b>aunt and uncle in the Woodlands, a rich Houston suburb. They</b>
<br><b>were in Utah on business, leaving me and my older cousin by</b>
<br><b>ourselves. He was 19 at the time while I was 16. We were</b>
<br><b>downstairs watching TV in my aunt's bedroom and my cousin</b>
<br><b>decided he was going to bed. So he went upstairs after turning on</b>
<br><b>the perimeter security alarm. Now my aunt's bedroom had a wall</b>
<br><b>made entirely out of windows, so you could see everything in the</b>
<br><b>backyard. The backyard was also enclosed by a large wooden</b>
<br><b>fence around the pool. The pool lights were on so the wall across</b>
<br><b>from the windows was covered in light. Suddenly, I saw a shadow</b>
<br><b>walking across the wall in the light, as if someone were walking</b>
<br><b>right next to the windows. When I looked there was no one there.
I</b>
<br><b>went to the bottom of the stairs and asked my cousin if he had</b>
<br><b>gone outside a couple of minutes ago, and he said no, he was right</b>
<br><b>in the middle of brushing his teeth. So then I asked him if he had</b>
<br><b>turned the outside alarm on and he said he had. The alarm would</b>
<br><b>have gone off if there were someone out there, and the shadow</b>
<br><b>looked very human-like. I dismissed it as nothing and went back
to</b>
<br><b>watching TV. Then, all of a sudden my soccer ball, which had been</b>
<br><b>sitting on the floor peacefully for almost 6 hours rolled about
7 feet</b>
<br><b>between me and the TV. I thought it was really creepy because</b>
<br><b>this was a carpeted floor, and it's much harder to roll a ball that
far</b>
<br><b>on carpet than it would be on a hard surface. Needless to say, I</b>
<br><b>marched right upstairs (without my soccer ball) and sat up with
my</b>
<br><b>cousin for another hour, talking, trying to calm myself down before
I</b>
<br><b>could go to sleep.</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;My Ghosts..</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JoeLightlingJoe@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is only the recent ghost paranormal
stuff. Because I can remember</b>
<br><b>these better, and second I'm too lazy to type them all.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This one happened about a month ago.
After my mom explained hers, I</b>
<br><b>told her mine. I was sleeping in her room, on another bed, because
there was</b>
<br><b>no where in the house to sleep. I woke up about..oh, say, 3:00 in
the</b>
<br><b>morning. Instead of going to the bathroom inside her room, I went
to the</b>
<br><b>other across the house, because I wanted to get a drink of water.
As I opened</b>
<br><b>the door, I seen something by the kitchen table duck down. I looked
real</b>
<br><b>quick, and tried to get a better look. I walked out of the kitchen,
along my</b>
<br><b>way to the bathroom, and I seen again. I turned around, and there
he was.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No sort of glow, he wasn't opaque.
He was just there, like a human.</b>
<br><b>Staring at me. He couldn't have been more than 6 or 7 years old.
He looked as</b>
<br><b>if he had a height disorder. His hair was in a "buzz" style haircut.
I wasn't</b>
<br><b>scared (since I was half awake). I said, "leave me alone!" as if
it was my</b>
<br><b>brother. I walked to the bathroom, and he followed me halfway. I
did what I</b>
<br><b>did, and came back out. He was still standing there. I told him
to go away,</b>
<br><b>and I went back to sleep. We still see him some nights, and such,
but he</b>
<br><b>doesn't pose a threat.</b>

<p><b>2 Stories to Tell</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wnearing@msn.com]</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>hi, i have two stories to tell.</b>
<br><b>the first happened 9 years ago, right after my grandmother passed
away. my wife and decided it was time to go to bed. it was about 11pm.
she went up stairs to get ready for bed,while i went to lock the doors.
i then went up stairs to get ready for bed. our bedroom and bathroom are
across the hall from each other. as i was going into the bathroom i looked
in our bedroom and saw my wife laying in bed looking at a magazine. i couldn't
see her face because the magazine was covering it. i could only see her
arms. i went to the sink and started to wash my face. as i was bent over
the sink i felt someone next to me. i looked up and was surprised to see
my wife standing there in the clothes she had been waring when she went
up to bed. i asked her why she had put her clothes back on. she said,what
do you mean. i then told her i just saw her in bed reading a magazine.
she told me that she hadn't been in bed yet because she was in our daughter's
room looking in on her. i looked at her not believing. she said my face
went white. we then went into our bedroom to see who was in our bed. noone
was there. the bed covers had not been turned down and their was no magazine.
i didn't sleep much that night. all i was thinking was that my grandmother
had visited me..bill</b>
<br><b>the second thing that happened to us was last fall right after my
oldest daughter went away to college. my wife is clean freak and had totally
cleaned out her room. everything was in perfect order. one day i wife asked
me and our other daughter if we had been in jill's drawers. we both said
no but i think she thought one of us was lying. this was because some of
the drawers on a dresser were not shut. my wife closed them and didn't
say anything else. the next mourning my wife got up and when she went into
jill's room the same drawers were open. this time she did not accuse us
because she knew our ghost was back. for about two weeks this went on.
when my wife,myself or my youngest daughter went into jill's room the drawers
would be open after we had made sure they were closed. then one day it
didn't happen anymore.</b>

<p><b>The Unexplained Crash</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: AJULYNN@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was 6 my family moved into
a large three-story house on the</b>
<br><b>North Shore of Long Island. My new stepfather had become the minister
of a</b>
<br><b>church and we all got to live in what's called "the manse", or the
church's</b>
<br><b>house. I think it was ever since the first night that we slept in
that house,</b>
<br><b>that I began to have trouble sleeping. There were lots of creaks
and bumps</b>
<br><b>that occurred throughout every night, and there was just an uneasy
feeling</b>
<br><b>that settled throughout the whole house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, the first Halloween night that
we spent there, my older sister</b>
<br><b>and I had gone trick-or-treating with my Mom. After hours of candy
hunting,</b>
<br><b>we came back to the house and took off our costumes. Including my
sister and</b>
<br><b>I, plus our stepfather children, four children resided in the house
and we</b>
<br><b>each had our own rooms. And, every child had a set of bunk-beds
in their</b>
<br><b>room. Well, I had what's called a "T-Bed" which is like a normal
bunk-bed,</b>
<br><b>but instead of a regular bottom bunk, there's a regular bed that
can be</b>
<br><b>rolled around but is usually placed with the head of the bed halfway
under</b>
<br><b>the top, raised bunk, at a perpendicular (right) angle. Well, that
night my</b>
<br><b>sister and I decided to both sleep in my room. We put the bottom
bed on the</b>
<br><b>West side of the room for my sister to sleep on, and left the top
bunk on the</b>
<br><b>East side, where it was even with the top of the closet door, which
is where</b>
<br><b>I would sleep. My sister fell asleep right away, as usual, but I
stayed awake</b>
<br><b>with my eyes closed in attempts to fall asleep, as I usually did.
All of the</b>
<br><b>sudden, out of no where, my closet door, which had been left ajar,
slammed</b>
<br><b>shut violently. I opened my eyes, only to see a box of cassette
tapes that I</b>
<br><b>kept next to the door fall off the dresser and onto the floor, as
if it had</b>
<br><b>been pushed. The loud crash scared me so that I started to cry and
scream for</b>
<br><b>my Mom. Unsure of what had happened, she came running into the room
to</b>
<br><b>console me. I told her what had happened and she said that it must
have been</b>
<br><b>the dog who had caused the ruckus. But, just then, our dog, Poppy,
came</b>
<br><b>wondering into the room from down the hall to see what all the fuss
was over.</b>
<br><b>It was obvious that she had not been in the room, and had not caused
the</b>
<br><b>crash. My mother just looked at me, and still to this day has no
explanation</b>
<br><b>to offer for the cause of it all.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Ghost Hunt</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jnittler@oakwood.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My fianc&eacute; and I and his best friend decided to go to the cemetery
across the street from my house one night.&nbsp; We got dressed in our
warm clothes, grabbed the emf detector and the night vision monocular and
a flashlight and we were off.&nbsp; During the time we were there, nothing
really happened. We had&nbsp; ventured farther to the back of the cemetery
where all the recent were buried. The closer we got , the worst I felt.
I got this terrible feeling like we needed to stop and turn around and
go back.&nbsp; But I didn't say anything to the guys.&nbsp; When all the
sudden from behind us I distinctly heard some one whistling a tune! I whispered
to them to stop, and they did. When they stopped , so did the whistling.
So we started to go forward again. And I heard it again! So I looked at
them and said that it was time to go back. They agreed....thank God!&nbsp;
As we made our way back we heard this clicking sound. And all of the sudden
(which is not unusual) the sprinklers came on. But it still was so startling
that we ran out of there fast!.</b>
<br><b>The next day at work, I was telling my story to my friend marina.
She listened intently. Then she decided (after a lot of persuasion from
me) that she and I were going to go and check it out.&nbsp; She arrived
at my house after dark.&nbsp; I got everything together and tried to get
my fianc&eacute; to go with us....for protection! But there was a sharks
game on and he couldn't be pulled away.&nbsp; Marina held the emf detector
and the flashlight, I held the monocular and we were on our way.&nbsp;
We got to the edge of the cemetery, gave each other a look of ( what in
the heck are we doing out here) and hopped over the little stone fence.&nbsp;
We made our way through several headstones to the little road on the other
side. Marina was regularly checking the emf detector for any activity.
Nothing. We had the flashlight off, so we weren't seen. The moon was enough
light for us to see. I had my monocular up to my eyes, looking all over
the place. Nothing....nobody. We came to a curve in the road that led in
a "U" shape around a large patch of grave markers.&nbsp; Marina stopped
and handed me her car keys. She said if she need to run, she didn't want
to drop them and have to go back to get them. So I stuffed them into the
pocket of my jeans.&nbsp; We stood there debating on whether or not to
cut through the graves or stay on the road that lead to the well lit mausoleum.
Marina wanted to stay on the road and refused to cut through the graves.
She said she had a bad feeling about it. I on the other hand, wanted to
take the cut through where it was darker and we could not be seen. What
seemed like and eternity of arguing , she gave in.&nbsp; We had not even
taken 5 steps in the graves when from not even 5 feet away from us...When
marina stopped and looked at me in terror. "Did you hear that?" she said.
"Hear what?" I said and as the last word escaped my lips...I heard it.
The same tune I had heard the night before!&nbsp; I looked at her and said
"that is the exact thing I heard last night" she looked at me with tears
of fear in her eyes " no you didn't!"&nbsp; At that point we turned and
high tailed our butts out of there.&nbsp; If felt like we ran for miles!
We hadn't realized how far we had ventured in. We got to the stone fence
and jumped over.&nbsp; We got back to my house and breathlessly tried to
explain what happened. We will never forget what happend. And to this day...we
will never forget the tune.</b>

<br><b>My First Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bethwhite57@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was a non-believer until mid summer last year.&nbsp; Me, my wife,
and daughter took a driving vacation through the eastern states.&nbsp;
Our final destination was to go to a Street Rod National in Louisville,
Ky.&nbsp; Half-way through the trip I sent my wife and daughter home from
Durham, N.C. airport.&nbsp; We preplanned this because my daughter had
band practice that next week.&nbsp; Now to the ghost story.&nbsp; Two nights
after they flew home I checked into a motel in Charleston, WV.&nbsp; At
about 10pm I fell asleep and woke up at about 11pm to turn off the TV.&nbsp;
At about 2:30 am I was awakened by what I thought was my wife coming back
to bed from the bathroom.&nbsp; I felt the person set on the side of the
bed then lay down.&nbsp; In a few seconds, I realized it could not be my
wife.&nbsp; I came straight up out of the bed taking out two lamps from
the night stand to find no one there.&nbsp; After about 30 minutes, I laid
back down and shortly I felt some-one set on the end corner of the bed.&nbsp;
Kicking as hard as I could only to find nothing there.&nbsp; I laid there
with all the lights on for about an hour trying to understand what I had
seen.&nbsp; Then I turned then off one by one knowing I was not going back
to sleep.&nbsp; Within a few seconds after I laid back down with all the
lights off I saw a figure come around the end of the bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stopping
between me and the mirror just looking at me.&nbsp; It looked like a small
framed woman dressed in what would be clothes from the 1800's.&nbsp; I
opened my mouth but could not make a sound.&nbsp; I slowly raised up in
the bed and the figure went away.&nbsp; The hair stood up all over my body.&nbsp;
Writing this gives me that same feeling I had that night.&nbsp; I did not
want to see a ghost then and do not ever want to see one again.&nbsp; I
could not go to sleep that night.</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;My Experience with Life After Death</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CSUBLER@woh.rr.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I remember the day my grandfather died. I was living with him and
my grandmother at the time. I was away babysitting about 2 miles away.
I saw a sheriff's car go by the house, and something told me that someone
was looking for me.</b>
<br><b>When the lady returned home, about 30 minutes later, she found me
pacing the floor. I told her i had to leave immediately, and proceeded
to run the 2 miles back to the house. When I arrived, cars were parked
in the driveway, but no one was there.&nbsp; I ran the three blocks to
my parents home but no one was there. About the time I made it to the front
door cars started pulling into the drive way. At that moment i knew my
grandfather was dead. No one told me and no one had gotten out of the car.
For about three months after he died, i would wake up and see him standing
at the foot of my bed. He never spoke only smiled.</b>
