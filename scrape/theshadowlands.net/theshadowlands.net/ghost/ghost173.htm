<b>Haunted Clock</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: el22133@alltel.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My name is Cheryl and I live in Nebraska. It seems I've always had
ghost around, used to be scared, learned to live with them, get rid of
them if they turned mean, but now I'm stumped. I have an old pendulum clock
my cousin was going to have fixed for me one Christmas. I had a friend
who liked to refinish old things so we took it to his house to let him
work on it. He said it would take about 4 weeks to get it done. After that
I couldn't get hold of him. He wouldn't answer his phone or answer the
messages I left on his machine. He was never home when I went over. Finally
about 3 weeks later my daughter got hold of him and he'd been in the hospital
for pneumonia I think it was. He said he'd have the clock done by the week-end.
The week-end come and went, a few months come and went. Seven months after
the fact he was finally home when I went over. I didn't hardly recognize
him and even said "you're not Bart" but he was. I asked where my clock
was. He had it in a closet by the door, didn't ask me in just left me standing
outside while he put it in a bag and handed it to me and shut the door
in my face. I haven't seen or talked to him since, but my daughter seen
him about a week later, and he told her I sure acted wierd when I picked
up my clock. So I take the clock to a real repair guy. He said it would
take a month to get it fixed. I called him two months later, he was in
the hospital with heart problems. It's been almost 2 years, but I do have
the clock, and it does run. I don't have it hung yet, but I wonder what
will happen next. Just wanted to tell someone about it who wouldn't laugh
I guess, and see what you think. I think it's pretty wierd myself.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for listening.</b>

<p><b>Ghosts of Mal st.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ldnred@cybertours.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>HI, my name is Dan, I'm 14 and have already had a # of paranormal
activities happen to me over the years, at my house, and mainly at my cousins
house on Mal st..................</b>
<br><b>My cousins house, on Mal st. held very scary times for me. The big
old house used to be a funeral home and downstairs in the basement was
were the body's were creamated. Y ou can tell already there are a number
of spirets in the house.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My most haunted story was when I was 11 years old. I was sleeping
over my cousins house because of a family get together that had happed
that day. I was sound asleap on a small bed in my cousin Mike's room. (The
bed was facing the door.) I then suddenly awoke to the sound of Dakota's
bark downstairs. I awoke rather rapidly out of a dead sleep. The first
glance I got was of the door that had been partly opened. As I noticed
this, I&nbsp; also noticed a whiteish-blue glowing object pass the door.
My eyes jumped open in fear as I felt a cold rush over me. I jumped out
of bed and rose to my feet, I still felt the cold. I ran over to Mike's
bed and shoke him. He woke up, swore at me and than fell back to sleep.
I noticed the cold going away now, and than felt a feeling of security.
I walked over to the door and opened it. I looked both ways and noticed
to my right that the creepy old stairway door had been opened. I walked
out of the room and grabed onto the handle. I started to close the door
as I felt a cold breeze rush up the stairs. I was then startle by a loud
bark coming from the dowstairs in the kitchen. I let go of the door and
turned around and looked down the steep starcase that led downstairs. I
walked over to the edge of the staircase and looked down into the dark
abyss. I reched over to the light swich. I flipped it on as the dark abyss
flodded with light. I than joged downstairs, in hope to find Dakota. When
I reached the bottom of the stairs, I turned left and left again into the
kitchen, where I found Dakota staring at somthing in the next room.</b>
<br><b>"Dakota" I wispered. Dakota turned around happy to see me but than
stopped dead in her tracks, and looked directly over my shoulder. At that
moment, the stairway light went out and I felt the cold return as I slowly
turned around. In front of me I saw a large cloudy figure sfloating infront
of me I took a step back and looked to my right to see that the basement
door was open! The figure than came closer and floated off to the side
and down the basement stairs. I was now left in the pitch black room now
seeing darker shadows pass me. now, my nerves were pumping, I then dashed
through the hall and up the stairs, somthing was chaseing me!!! I ran up
stairs and back into mikes room. I ran in the room and bumped into mike
as we both fell to the floor. Mike than explained to me that he to had
seen the ghostly cloud figure pass by the door again, and he had also seen
the stairway light go out by itself.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;So, what was this ghost figure that both me and Mike saw?
Was it just</b>
<br><b>from being awake at such a late time? Are mind playing tricks on
us?</b>
<br><b>Or was it real? I think it was.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Sleep Paralysis</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DiorificOne@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This is something that still on occasion plagues me to this day.
It all started after my terrible visit to Bonaventure cemetery in Savannah
Ga. I would not like to go into that right now as it is late and quite
a lengthy and scary story. Let me tell you that I come from a religious
family, although I did dabble in the occult. (maybe this has something
to do with it). I am not on any medication, nor do I drink or partake in
drugs (save Camel Cigarettes). I have a pretty nice life now with a great
husband but still on occasion something happens to me that scares me so
very badly.I have read many a story on your site that reminds me of my
own in many ways.</b>
<br><b>Here goes.....</b>
<br><b>I used to be really into the occult and paranormal. I would read
stories and do tarot cards and the Ouija board, I read in a time life book
about out of body experiences and became fascinated. I would on occasion
try to get myself out of my body and feel very close but always fail. I
told my dad about what I read about the out of body experience and he asked
me a question that I will never forget and a question that changed how
I felt about out of body experiences. He asked "lets say you do get out
of your body, what if something else gets in it?" Well, that there floored
me and I began to wonder myself what would happen if I got out and immediately
ceased trying to do it all together. One day I went to the couch to lay
down and watch some TV as I lay there I thought I would take a nap and
closed my eyes, that's when it started, I got this numbing feeling, and
could hear ringing in my ears, I knew I was still awake as I could see
the TV flashing across my closed eyelids. Then I became paralyzed, I couldn't
even move a muscle, my eyes, nothing. I sensed a great fear take over me
like none I had ever known. I could feel myself trying to rise out of my
body, I did not want this to happen, it was as if something were trying
to pull me out of it against my own will. I knew for some reason that I
had to get up yet I couldn't, I wanted to yell and scream, yet again I
couldn't. The next thing I know I heard the most terrible evil voice inside
my head it seemed as I don't believe it was audible say and I will quote
: "I'll see you in five seconds!!!!" Well, that in itself was enough to
get me going, I was able to manage to get my little toe moving and then
the rest of my body started to move and I jolted up in a panic. I didn't
want to see the face or body of whatever it was that matched that voice.
I still recall every time this happens with pinpoint accuracy. Other times
it has happened even with my husband in the bed with me, I try to move
to wake him to help me yet I am paralyzed. I often stay up late after it
happens and am afraid to lay back down as it will overtake me again. Something
is trying to get me outside of my body. I am not crazy or suffering delusions
of grandeur. I often wonder if I have opened a door to something evil,
and if so will it ever leave? This experience does not happen often but
still it does happen. Once after it happened I stayed up reciting the Lords
prayer over and over again. I used to be into Satanism and saw a great
many things and that's the only thing I can think of that links this thing
or things with me. The reason I say things is that I can feel it approaching
me when it starts to happen, and once heard a strange music that sounded
like it was from the middle east playing and all I could think of in my
head while I was getting ready to become paralyzed is this "here they come
again". Please someone help me or talk to me that has had a similar experience.
Maybe I can learn something from others. Maybe you can learn something
from me. In any event I have turned my life over to God and do not practice
in occultic activities any longer. However I do believe in the other side,
if there is a good side there is also a bad side and I believe in them
both. Thank you for your time.</b>

<p><b>Baby Crying</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JESSA5@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;In the apartment I used to live in my husband and I have experienced
some things.They mostly started after my daughter was born.&nbsp; We'd
hear someone walking into our bedroom. Now it couldn't be coming from upstairs
because you can't walk that way up there and it couldn't be coming from
downstairs because you couldn't walk that way either.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also
one night very late I heard a child crying . It sounded like the way my
four year old cried at the time , I went to check on him he was still asleep.
Again it didn't come from upstairs because there wasn't a four year old
there and the same goes for the downstairs apartment also. A friend that
was staying with us at the time heard the same thing but did not tell me
until I said something about it. Tenants on the first floor also heard
it at one time but it was coming from outside near the creek that runs
by the building . Of course they did not find anyone or thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The apartment&nbsp; above us would smell foul odors where you shouldn't
have smelled them. The one person also&nbsp; experienced something laying
down in bed with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are still many more tales
I could tell about that place and am very curious as to what was haunting
that place, but I don't think I will ever know because the place will be
knocked down soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can only explain one of the occurences,
and that is that some years ago a four year old was&nbsp; killed instantly
in a car accident very near the building.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Thank you for reading my message hope you like it.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Music to Haunt By</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: RAHMANN.BELTING@worldnet.att.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>A few years ago I went and stayed the summer with my aunt in a farmhouse
she had recently bought that was over 100 years old in the outskirts of
Lincolnton, NC.&nbsp; Right up the road was where here deceased sister-in-law
lived when she died.&nbsp; My aunts was taking care of the woman's two
children.</b>
<br><b>On countless nights in the house my radio would turn on and off
by itself, when it was unplugged.&nbsp; It would also change stations.&nbsp;
I often heard music that seemed to be coming from the breaker box. One
of the lights in one of the rooms woulds flicker on and and off as if someone
was walking around above us.&nbsp; One room that no one slept in and was
supposedly the "death room" when&nbsp; the house was built, was ice cold,
even in 100 degree weather.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you tried to sleep in this
room, it felt like this strange force telling you</b>

<p><b>The Un-Invited Guests</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:Janmarie746@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; The summer of 1964, when life seemed much simpler and less
hurried, was a year of new beginnings for myself and my older sister, Dottie.
I married Donnie and she married his best friend Daryl. We lived in the
small town of Little Mexico, just outside of Sycamore, Ohio. Our small
community housed only twenty homes then. Sycamore was only four miles from
us, and we visited each other quite frequently. Dottie's little girl Beverly
was just 7 months old at the time, and wasn't walking as yet. I kept Beverly
overnight at times, as she was company to me when Donnie worked the second
shift factory job at the Carbon.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dottie and Daryl had married three weeks after Donnie
and I had, and they got moved to the Babbcock home prior to their wedding.
We helped to paint and clean the small two bedroom country house, enjoying
each other's company as we worked. Dottie sewed the curtains for the small
frame windows in a flowered and lace pattern, taking weeks to do it all
just so. She sewed the matching shower curtain and sink skirt, for their
tiny bath,</b>
<br><b>in the old fashioned prints of the golden era. The house itself
sat back a short lane, almost hidden from the highway's view by a thick
over-growth of trees and shrubs. I never cared for going there after dark,
as it seemed abit forlorn and lonely, and scary to me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life went as usual for them for a week
or two, until one night after Dottie had gone to bed. She was not asleep
yet, when she thought she heard a loud noise in Beverly's nursery, a room
set just off of their bedroom. She went to investigate, thinking perhaps
Beverly had finally mastered getting out of her crib. Beverly was fast
asleep, and not stirring.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Dottie entered the
room she noticed how very cold the air in the room was. It was like an
ice-berg in there, and the rocker sitting in a corner was still moving
to and fro, as though it were occupied. Being the middle of summer and
with temps in the 90's that day, the cold air was very puzzling to Dottie.
More so, was the movement of the rocker, as it was a still night, with
no wind coming through the open window at all.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing unusual happened for several days,
so Dottie passed it off as just a wierd happening. The phone rang, and
Dottie is telling me she is really concerned now. The previous evening
after she had gone to bed and was about asleep, when suddenly the covers
were violently jerked from her body, but not a soul appeared to be in the
room but her. With that strange eerie, ice cold air again surrounding her,
she bolted upright in her bed, wrapping her own arms around herself in
a protective jesture. There were no simple</b>
<br><b>explanations, and I began to speculate the many causes to settle
her fears. None seemed to quiet or calm her concerns now at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
She had talked to Daryl about this, but he scoffed at her fears, saying
it was just the breeze from the windows. Days followed and nothing seemed
to go wrong, till the night Darly was in the bathroom after work. Dottie
and Beverly were already asleep when he arrived home at 1:00 A.M. The sounds
of someone walking heavily, as they decended the stairway didn't bother
Daryl at all, as he figured that Dottie knew he was home from work, and
had come to say hello.&nbsp; The footsteps came to rest just outside the
bathroom door, then became silent. The hair shackled on Daryl's neck, as
he knew Dottie would just come in the room. He called her name, no response,
so he called louder, still no response. Now Daryl knew this was strange,
as he had heard someone just walk the length of stairs, and stop outside
the bathroom door.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went to see where Dottie was, thinking
she was trying to scare him,</b>
<br><b>but found her sound asleep in their room upstairs. Now he was sceptical
to what he had just witnessed himself. So as time went on these things
continued to plaque their household, in many ways. Things came up missing
with no explanation as to where they went, or things were totally moved
out of their intended places. The couch cushions would be taken off the
couch, stacked in the corner when they come down stairs in the mornings.
Daryl worked on model airplanes, placing straight pins in to hold the pieces,
till the glue would set. Pins would disappear, never to be found anywhere
in the house. Pictures on the walls would be placed in other rooms, stacked
in neat rows, or laid</b>
<br><b>out in a straight line across a floor.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lights would go and off at will, as would the
TV, while they were viewing a show or the news. Once the entire contents
of their fridge was laid out on the kitchen cubboards, when they got up
on a Saturday morning. Then when Dottie was sitting in the living room
one evening, she noticed that the lace on her curtains was totally gone.
It was no where in the house, as they searched every where for the lace,
to no avail. At first Daryl thought Dottie was just over reacting to some
little quirk she had, or maybe had dreamed</b>
<br><b>these things. Only when it happened to him, and he saw these things
too, and heard the footsteps did he know too, that something was wrong
in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They at first blamed the other one
on these things beiing miss-placed, and coming up totally missing all together,
but the last straw was when while Beverly was napping, and they sat in
their living room, the baby screamed as if in pain, and then appeared so
freightened. They ran upstairs to find that she had the imprints of fingers
on her arms, that appeared to look like</b>
<br><b>someone had held Beverly against her will. Her small tiny face had
an angry red welt from a handprint. That is when they knew this was the
time to move out of that house, and away from all the chaos, of what for
certain seemed to be a ghost or unwanted entity in their home. The legend
was told to them much later, that anyone not belonging to the Babbcock
family, had never been allowed to live in the house in peace and harmony.&nbsp;
This is a true story, and I know it was totally true, as it was my sister
who lived this nightmare in 1964.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Tall Dark Man</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>When my husband was about 11 years of age he his mother, father,
and younger brother who was around 9 at the time moved into a house in
North Carolina. My husbands grandmother was invited to come and see the
house and after entering she walked out of the house and said she got an
uneasy feeling about the house and that something was in it that she did
not like.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My husbands family was religious so they did not pay too much mind
to this comment the thing is nanny (my husbands grandmother) is religious
too, but still felt this presence there in that house. My husband said
as a child he felt uneasy when entering into his house, he didn't feel
so much afraid but just got an uneasy feeling. He said anyone could feel
that feeling upon entering the house. Upstairs is where the bedrooms were,
his parents rooms were at the end of the hall, my husbands room was at
the side of the hall</b>
<br><b>And his little brothers room was at the other end of the hall, so
that his parents could see directly into his little brothers room with
the street lamps illuminating his room and part of the hallway. One night
that my husband recalls with pinpoint accuracy his little brother started
yelling in a blood curdling voice "There's a man in my room!!!! There's
a man in my room!!!!</b>
<br><b>My husbands mother opened her eyes and looked down the hall at his
little brothers room from where she was laying in bed to see what the ruckus
was. What she saw she only has told very few people (me not being one of
them). She saw a dark silhouette of a man over&nbsp; 6 feet in stature
standing by my husbands little brothers bed actually looking over his bed
at him as if he were some kind of bug in a high school biology exam. We
will call this</b>
<br><b>Little brother Jerry. Jerry continued to scream the screams as my
husbands father rushed out of bed towards Jerry's room, My husbands Mom
watched as theFigure walked out of Jerry's room looked in her direction
and vanished. She said the figure was solid black. You could not see through
it. This happened on several occasions. My husband we will call him Larry,
said that no matter what time of day it was, it could be sunshine at 12
noon and he would be outside in his back yard all alone with no one in
the house and he would just know he was being watched. He said that whenever
he would enter a room in</b>
<br><b>The house and that means any room of the house he would as well
as others catch out of the corner of their eyes something leaving the room
and entering another room, as if this thing was exiting just as you were
entering. His mother later recounted that at night at a certain hour she
would hear things in the old dirt basement beneath the house, rapping's,
tapping, and what sounded like crumpling of paper. My husband heard these
noises too. I am not sure as to the history of the house, but I can tell
you in all assurance my husbands family does have all of their screws.
He is not one to tell tales and fortunately believes the ones I tell him.
They moved out after three years of the happenings. Larry's father has
never mentioned anything. His mother is silent as well. And believe it
or not even Jerry does not talk about it. I suppose it would be hard for
me to talk about too if some man</b>
<br><b>Was visiting me each night in my room at the tender age of 9. When
we go home to visit his parents I think I will bring up the subject to
his mother while we are alone and try to get the exact location for you.
Maybe the house is still up with occupants of earthly and unearthly still
living there. My husband confided in me also that he started having a terrible
dream in the house that he still has now during his adulthood. It was a
dream of being in hell following the devil himself into a tall tower that
overlooked hells waste lands. He hasn't had the dream in 2 years. But guess
what, although he never personally saw the tall black man that Jerry was
so unfortunate to see, the man appears in his dream, and the dream always
takes place with that house in it, and with the tall black figure banging
at the front door of that house saying.....let me in!!!!!! LET ME IN!!!!
I just found this out last night as we were discussing your very informative
and wonderfully put together site.</b>

<br><b>Greenhouse Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jeskim1@email.msn.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello My name is Jessica and I am 16 . I live in Massachusetts. I
will not say where this greenhouse is that i worked in&nbsp; that was haunted
but I can guarantee you that it is haunted. It is said that the man who
haunts the greenhouse that I worked in (one of 3 i was assigned to water&nbsp;
and care for this one because nobody wants to water it because they are
scared). Well I had heard of experiences of friends who worked there. Some
heard voice and objects flew across the room. Others felt like someone
was watching them. Some even saw the ghost. My experiences started shortly
after I had started working there in December of 1999. One day as i was
talking to my friend and we had just put all of the leftover plant pots
away. Suddenly a breeze came through the work area and none of the doors
or windows were open. Then a smell of dead fish lingered around. Several
minutes later all of the pots flew out at us and landed at our feet. This
was something that happened day after day. A couple of weeks later I was
watering the plants and I had just finished. I hear footsteps behind me
and all of the plants started moving and there was banging on the walls
coming froom all sides of the greenhouse. I ran out because I had this
feeling I was not wanted there. As I ran out of the greenhouse the footsteps
got faster and harder and i slammed the door shut and they stopped, so
did the banging, and so did the wind. Over Christmas Vacation is when everything
happened. Things we never expected. First off let me say that the people
who saw the ghost only saw the outline of an old man with a long coat a
cane and a top hat that kind of flopped over. All the ghost would do is
stare at people. There were certain boundaries for him. He would not go
out of the third greenhouse, and would not go into the new part of the
building which was built about ten years ago. Much newer than the greenhouses
which were about 50 years old. The old man who haunts it was in the hospital
and his sons sold his house on him thinking he was going to die. Because
of this the old man used to stay in the greenhouse for long periods of
time.&nbsp; Could this be why he is still there?? Back to my experiences
over Christmas vacation. It was on a Wednsday. Myself, Jesse , and Tricia
(all workers with me) were working 8 - 4:30. We were in the work are on
our break when the door to the third greenhouse started banging. There
was a master lock on it and it was lock (yet that morning nobody had locked
it). It was around 11:30. The door started banging like someone was pounding
on it and the plants inside started moving. No vents or doors were open.
We all looked at the door wondering what was happening. The lock on the
door unlocked and the door swung open. We figured maybe it was an open
vent or something and maybe we thought the lock was locked. We checked
no doors or vents open. And when we went to look at the lock it was floating
in midair!!! This scared us half to death. The lock the latched itself
onto a hook and the door hooked itself open. Trish and I ran into the office
of the building so scared we were crying. Jesse, having an interest in
ghosts, called her friend becky who studies paranormal things to see what
we should do. She told us to lock the door and put salt in front of it.
Salt is supposedly a repellent of ghosts and they will not walk past it.
When we did this, we heard footsteps run up to the door and they stopped
the minute the salt hit the floor. we sat in the office for an hour or
so when the ghost started getting mad. He was pounding at the door and
getting very upset. I was in the office when Jesse came up to me and asked
me what was wrong. I asked her what she was talking about and i looked
in a window and noticed my eyes were so bloodshot. I started breaking out
in sweats (mixtures of hot and cold) and shaking extremely bad to the point
when i fell to the floor. I started crying hysterically and started saying
things I dont even remember. All I know is I was t alking about the ghost
saying I know how he feels.I also had an urge to talk to the ghost. It
was so scary for me. Then I went to the window of the greenhouse we shut
him in and i looked in the window to find&nbsp; the ghost watching me.
I talked to him telling him it was ok we know he is here and we are taking
care of his greenhouse for him. We swept&nbsp; up the salt and from then
on he has been helpful. He helps us by opening doors when needed and he
doesnt bother us. Every so often he plays around with us and shows up here
and there. Other than that I am used to it. I no longer work there but
I go back there and I know he is there. We also have a ghost. A very silent
one, who sits near the bathrooms that were built about ten years ago. They
ghost's shadows appear on the walls and he lets you know he is there by
touching you and walking by you making a breeze. Well that is all I hope&nbsp;

<br><b>Paranormal Sensitivity</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Nmbr8ball@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well I think I've had a couple experiences before.&nbsp; First of
all I'm only 12.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I have a sister who babysits.&nbsp; I'm very close to her
and I always go with</b>
<br><b>her to babysit for one of my friends.&nbsp; Whenever I go into this
one room</b>
<br><b>upstairs I see this doll and I always get very scared.&nbsp; I never
go up there</b>
<br><b>alone anymore.&nbsp; In the washroom his parents put up a portrait
of a small</b>
<br><b>girl.&nbsp; I always fell like she's watching me.&nbsp; And yet
another time we were on</b>
<br><b>the pool deck and I sware I saw a white figure walking inside.&nbsp;
Nobody was</b>
<br><b>walking around for there to be a reflection on the glass of the
door.&nbsp; Then</b>
<br><b>at about 8:00 it always gets freezing cold on the couch.&nbsp; Then
there's my</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; I think I may just be paranoid but I'm not sure if
there's a ghost at</b>
<br><b>my house.&nbsp; Many times when I'm in my bed alone I feel as though
someone's in</b>
<br><b>my room.&nbsp; I always sleep with my door open.&nbsp; Sometimes
my dog barks in the</b>
<br><b>middle of the night for no reason what soever and she's staring
out the door</b>
<br><b>as if she see's something.&nbsp; I often get chills when it's not
cold but hey</b>
<br><b>maybe it's some muscular thing.&nbsp; I sware that I saw a lady
in a red dress</b>
<br><b>outside my house while my sister's boyfriend and I were talking.&nbsp;
Now my</b>
<br><b>whole family jokes about it.&nbsp; She disapeared and nobody else
say her.&nbsp; And</b>
<br><b>there's the oven.&nbsp; Oven, oven, oven.&nbsp; Sometimes when my
mom thinks she turns</b>
<br><b>it off we find it on hours later.&nbsp; Then we think we turn it
off and we find</b>
<br><b>it on again.&nbsp; Although these "ghosts" (if these are them anyway)
have never</b>
<br><b>materialized they have been noticable to me.&nbsp; I think that
I am a little more</b>
<br><b>sensitive to the "paranormal".&nbsp; None of my family members feel
as though the</b>
<br><b>"paranormal" activity is as strong as I do.&nbsp; Please, if anything
weird ever</b>
<br><b>happens to you trust that God will protect you because he loves
each and</b>
<br><b>every one of you.&nbsp; Thank you for spending your time reading
this story.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Little Boy</b>
<br><b>By: Stacy_Condie@sento.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before my
husband Rob and I were married, I stayed with him in his friend's house.
Rob used to tell me stories about a little boy that would look at him in
his bed, trying to sleep, while standing in the window well of Rob's basement
window.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night,
before I stayed there, the little boy was staring at Rob. Not moving. Just
looking at him in the window well. Rob didn't know who he was, so he just
hit the window with his fist, and yelled "Get out of here!" Tke little
boy didn't&nbsp; flinch, didn't blink, or move. It really scared Rob since
he believes in spirits and afterlife.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next
morning while I was at school, he paged me so he could tell me about it.
He also told me about how he had a dream about me the same night. He dreampt
that we were walking together and he was looking at me. After a minute,
he wasn't looking at my face anymore. It was a mean, evil face. He said
that it was black, and had really evil eyes. The figure took a swing at
him, and hit him in the jaw. he woke up the next morning, and his jaw was
sore.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He used to
listen to music at night when he was going to sleep. One night, when we
were getting ready for bed, I asked him if the music helped him sleep better.
He just told me yes, and said that there was another reason, but he just
didn't want to scare me. I asked him to tell me anyway, so he just told
me that he heard noises that he didn't want to listen to, and the msic
drowned them out, and kind of soothed him. I just left it at that.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night,
while we were trying to sleep, I could tell there was something wrong with
Rob. He finally told me that he could feel the same presence that he felt
the night he saw the evil face. We layed there awake for a while, until
he finally couldn't stand it anymore, and turned the lights on. I guess
the lights made it leave.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We never
had experiences like that for a while. We had a spirit of a young lady
in our first appartment. She would just show up sometimes as little gold
sparks that quickly flew across the room. She would also sometimes appear
in the bathroom at night, which was a few feet away from our bed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rob's brother
and a few of his friends have seen the little boy. He doesn't really do
any harm. Sometimes you'll just see him and he'll run around the room and
go into a wall or something like that. We believe that maybe he was just
a little boy that was killed in the area a long time ago, since Rob's friend's
house was fairly new.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About six
months after we were married, I couldn't go to sleep. We had just watched
a movie and were going to bed. I just put my arms around Rob and cried.
When he asked what was wrong, I just cried. I couldn't get anything out.
Finally, I told him that I felt something evil in the room. I could point
out where it was and everything. After I pointed it out, he started to
feel it too. It finally got so bad that we had to leave the house and go
for a walk. I didn't want to go home, but Rob has a bad ankle, so we had
to go back. When we got there, I still felt uneasy. So we prayed for it
to go away and to never come in our room again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We haven't
experienced anything like that since, but I believe that spirits are attracted
to Rob.</b>

<br><b>Devil's Den at Gettysburg Battlefield</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cinsation@pa.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi, this is my second submission to Shadowlands. I don't know that</b>
<br><b>anyone will agree with what I am about to tell you, but to me, the</b>
<br><b>experience I had at Devil's Den yesterday (Sept.30,2000) was by
far the</b>
<br><b>most thrilling and energizing I have ever experienced. And when
I say</b>
<br><b>energizing, I mean it was like someone gave me a shot of pure</b>
<br><b>adrenaline! On to the story.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I arrived at the Battlefield around 9am. The
outside temp was around</b>
<br><b>44 degrees F. My first stop was the Pennsylvania Memorial. It is
a</b>
<br><b>beautiful monument and I strolled around checking out the plaques
and</b>
<br><b>statues. As I walked into the center of the memorial I was overcome
with</b>
<br><b>an immense sadness. It was all I could do not to break down and
cry</b>
<br><b>right on the spot. I wasn't alone as there were several boy scout
troops</b>
<br><b>touring the battlefield that day. I walked away and gazed across
the</b>
<br><b>field adjacent to the memorial to try to regain control of my emotions.</b>
<br><b>I drove around a bit and found myself right back at the memorial
site.</b>
<br><b>But this time as I was approaching the site I looked out at the
field</b>
<br><b>and noticed a shimmering quality. At first I thought it was heat
waves</b>
<br><b>then realized, it was still only about 45 degrees and it couldn't</b>
<br><b>possibly be heat waves. It was amazing watching the energy in that</b>
<br><b>field. As I sat watching, I noticed a breeze in the trees. A little</b>
<br><b>whirlwind of leaves came by my truck and went as far as the oak
tree</b>
<br><b>approximately 30ft from me. The odd thing was, none of the other
leaves</b>
<br><b>on the ground were moving yet there was a steady breeze in the tree.
I</b>
<br><b>pulled away a few minutes later and headed for Devil's Den.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have always heard what a hotspot for paranormal
activity Devil's</b>
<br><b>Den is. Being as I love to explore the unknown I checked to make
sure my</b>
<br><b>camera was ready. The battery indicator said I had a full charge.
This</b>
<br><b>particular camera has never given me a moments trouble. It is an
AGFA</b>
<br><b>ePhoto 780 digital camera. I arrived at Devil's Den and stepped
out of</b>
<br><b>the truck to take a shot of my first viewing of the place. It took
me</b>
<br><b>almost 5 minutes to get the camera to work. I took 21 photos and
the</b>
<br><b>batteries were completely drained. I can normally take over 100
pics</b>
<br><b>without having to change the batteries. I began walking around the</b>
<br><b>stones and looking into the different hiding places and such just</b>
<br><b>enjoying the energy around the place. After about 45 mins I came
down</b>
<br><b>and stopped under a particularly large overhanging rock. I sat down
and</b>
<br><b>was enjoying the buzz of the air around me. I felt a drop of water
hit</b>
<br><b>my left hand and looked up to see where it might have originated.
The</b>
<br><b>stone was completely dry! I even stood up to run my hand across
it to be</b>
<br><b>sure. I sat back down and a few minutes later I felt a warm wetness
on</b>
<br><b>my right thigh. My jeans were dry but I could feel the pressure
of</b>
<br><b>someone's head in my lap. A strong feeling of sadness, fear and
anger</b>
<br><b>invaded my senses. The anger wasn't directed towards me, but seemed
to</b>
<br><b>be the anger of 'why did this happen to me?' type. I stayed until
the</b>
<br><b>pressure lifted and then moved across the road to the woods. I felt</b>
<br><b>prompted to go to the woods, like it was something I just had to
do. I</b>
<br><b>am so glad I followed that prompting, because what happened next
is what</b>
<br><b>had me so energized! At this point I just opened my mind and asked,</b>
<br><b>okay, what do you want to show/tell me? Mind you, I never heard
anything</b>
<br><b>with my ears, but I could hear a voice in my mind very clearly.
I also</b>
<br><b>felt his presence close by. Listening to what was going on in my
mind I</b>
<br><b>asked who my guide was. I was told his name is Pvt. Marc Johansen,
he</b>
<br><b>pronounced it Yo-hahn-sin. I thanked him and he led me through the
woods</b>
<br><b>on a barely visible trail. The whole time he was telling me about
the</b>
<br><b>way the men were feeling. He never did tell me whether he was Union
or</b>
<br><b>Confederate and I didn't ask. I was just really happy to have the</b>
<br><b>communication with him. He eventually led me back to the small creek</b>
<br><b>that separates the road and the woods. As I laid down to drink from
the</b>
<br><b>creek I saw a shadow in the creek, pacing around me. I had the feeling</b>
<br><b>that I was being protected from something. I thanked him and he
led me a</b>
<br><b>little further down the creek. There are some really large stones
in</b>
<br><b>this creekbed. A few times I felt him steady me as I jumped from
one</b>
<br><b>stone to another. At one point he wanted to sit and talk, so I sat
down</b>
<br><b>on a large stone and listened. By this time we were away from the
other</b>
<br><b>visitors and their voices, when heard, were nothing more than a
distant</b>
<br><b>muted noise. Pvt. Johansen told me the men were tired and for the
most</b>
<br><b>part just wanted to go home and forget the war. He said there was
a lot</b>
<br><b>of fear, excitement, anger and sadness. I couldn't see my wonderful</b>
<br><b>guide, but from his voice he sounded in his early twenties. We had
been</b>
<br><b>sitting about 20 minutes when a couple with a camera came to where
we</b>
<br><b>were. I could hear my guide tell me to hurry up and move downstream.
I</b>
<br><b>guess he is camera shy. Anyway, the couple looked at me strangely
as I</b>
<br><b>hurried past them and out of site. After we sat another 10 minutes
or so</b>
<br><b>he told me that he had to go. I thanked him and wished him a safe
trip</b>
<br><b>home. I crossed the creek and headed back to where my truck was
parked,</b>
<br><b>about a 1/4 mile upstream. I had several people look at me like
I was</b>
<br><b>crazy because I was smiling and just bouncing with energy. I didn't
care</b>
<br><b>because I knew I had just had the most wonderful experience in my
life.</b>
<br><b>As I drove away, my eyes were drawn to an outcropping of rocks just
off</b>
<br><b>the bank of the creek. I couldn't see my Pvt. there, but I could
sense</b>
<br><b>him and waved good-bye. I stopped at Triangular Field and could
feel an</b>
<br><b>energy there but wasn't contacted by anyone. A few of the other</b>
<br><b>monuments and markers I stopped at caused me to feel an overwhelming</b>
<br><b>sadness. I almost cried several times before finally leaving the</b>
<br><b>battlefield. I don't know why, but I maintained an incredible energy</b>
<br><b>level all day and barely slept last night. I loved every minute
I spent</b>
<br><b>with my guide. It makes me wonder if I knew him in a previous life
or if</b>
<br><b>he felt compelled to talk with me because I was so open to the</b>
<br><b>experience.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for letting me post
this wonderful experience and I would</b>
<br><b>love to hear from anyone who has had a similar energizing experience.</b>

<br><b>Friendly Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mmelnick@telusplanet.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>About 25 yrs ago I moved into an old house in B.C. Canada</b>
<br><b>I was a single mom with 2 boys ages 9 &amp; 10&nbsp; At first nothing
was unusual.&nbsp; One night I dreamed of a Mans voice saying "You have
always been like a daughter&nbsp; to me and I will take care of you" After
that things changed for the better if I was broke and needed money for
a grocerys it seemed I 'd get a jacket &amp; find money in the pocket I
didn't know I had or be walking down the street &amp; find some money.&nbsp;
About this time some of my friends began to say they felt uncomfortable
at my house that something didn't feel right.&nbsp; A girlfriend sleeping
over woke in the middle of the night &amp; started yelling she swore she
saw a mans face looking down at her.&nbsp; I laughed&nbsp; it all off as
I felt very confortable in my home.&nbsp; I started to hear strange noises
at night but was not afraid. The boys came to me one night &amp; said they
couldn't sleep as a man kept talking &amp; was scaring them.&nbsp; I sat
at my kitchen table &amp; said I don't mind sharing my house but stop scaring
the boys or I will move.&nbsp; The boys never complained about hearing
a voice again.&nbsp; One night another girlfriend was sleeping over we
had just gone to bed when I heard footsteps &amp; the fridge door open
I called out to Dot to see if she needed anything &amp; she answered from
her room that it wasn't her she had thought I was up.&nbsp; I went to check
on the boys both were sleeping soundly. I stood in the kitchen &amp; said
"I don't mind sharing my house but stay out of my fridge I need that food
for the kids"&nbsp; I never heard the fridge open again.&nbsp; Dot thought
I had gone completely nuts standing there talking to nothing but I just
felt that he was there &amp; heard everything I said.</b>
<br><b>There was one small room that had a closet at one end, I had a single
bed in it plus the washer &amp; dryer.&nbsp; One night I heard someone
running (It sounded like a kid playing in high heeled shoes) I yelled out
to stop the noise I was trying to sleep, (by this time I was so used to
him that I talked to him just like talking to anyone else) In the morning
we found the curtain off the closet door in the living room thinking the
dog or cat had done it I tried &amp; tried to get that curtain out of that
small room but no matter how hard I tried it would catch on the end of
the bed as i tried to get it between the bed &amp; the washer so I knew
it had to be him as the dog or cat would have lost it when it caught.&nbsp;
This relationship continued about 2 yrs.&nbsp; I became engaged and shortly
before I married I had another dream where he said to me I had someone
to take care of me now &amp; wouldn't need him anymore.&nbsp; I never heard
from him again.&nbsp; Over the years I have regretted never finding out
his name instead of just referring to him as him.&nbsp; Many times I have
wished he would come back,&nbsp; I have never felt as loved and protected
since. I sincerely wish I knew who he was &amp; why he picked me to look
after and many times I've wished he hadn't gone.</b>

<p><b>River Legacy Park -</b>
<br><b>By: Bishop72@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>There is a park in Arlington, Texas called River Legacy Park which
definitely lives up to its name. I will tell you of three of the most famous
legacies.</b>
<br><b>Screaming Bridge:</b>
<br><b>One night after a high-school football game a carload of kids were
driving fast on a country road just outside of the park. Coming to a narrow
bridge over the Trinity River they met their fate when they did not see
another car coming hitting it head on. Both cars erupted into flames and
plummeted into the river below. All involved were killed and since then
the road has been closed and can only be walked to through the park. Legend
has it that if you find the bridge you will see the dates of the occurence
and the names of the deceased glowing as tombstones in the water and if
after that you still dare you can sit in the middle of the bridge on the
night that it happened and at midnight you will witness a heavy fog coming
up from the river as you see headlights approaching from either side of
the bridge. The light will become so bright that it will be blinding and
you will hear a loud crash and screams as there is metal grinding over
the side of the bridge and a loud splash! If you then get up and run to
the side of the bridge you will be able to see the waves of the ghostly
cars in the water. Incidentally one of the real cars is still in the river
and can be seen when the water is low enough. Though I have never dared
to be there at night I have seen the car. It is in the middle of no where
so if you do go be sure to bring a flash light and maybe a good walking
stick.</b>
<br><b>The Hobo:</b>
<br><b>Near the park are some railroad tracks that run through an area
called Mosier Valley so the park is a good getting off place for the train
hoppers since the train has to slow down here. The park also provided a
"safe" haven for those who needed to stay over night before treking to
the nearest night shelter or highway. One night an old hobo was staying
in the park and was awoken by the sounds of screams. Wondering to the edge
of the woods from where he had been sleeping he saw a car parked and what
appeared to be a man and a woman fighting. Walking closer he saw the man
hitting the woman and the woman knocked unconscious. Opening the door he
grabbed the man but in the struggle that ensued was shot. The next day
the woman was found wondering through the park delirious and half-naked
but the hobo layed dead next to where the car had been. Though the killer
was later found it is rumored that no police reports were ever filed because
he was the son of a prominent politician. However, lovers parked late at
night still catch a glimpse of the old hobo. Legend has it that late at
night if you are still in the park after closing you will hear a tap on
your window and there will be an old man standing there in rags. He will
ask you if you have any change. If you roll down the window and hand him
some change he will thank you and walk quietly away back into the woods.
However, if you refuse to roll down your window he will disappear and your
car will not start. Let me tell you it is a long LONG walk to a pay phone
especially in this park!!</b>
<br><b>Hells Gate:</b>
<br><b>River Legacy Park is huge and one can easily get lost in the woods
that surround it. There are swamps and rivers and an endless labrynth of
trails that seem to take any would be hiker in circles. The whole park
is said to be haunted and once was considered the most spirited park in
America. Maybe that is because of all the liquor I drank there! Hah! I
have even been told that there is an old civil war cemetary here but I
have not been able to find it. Anyway, back to the legend. After about
a day of walking the trails you may stumble across an area known as Hells
Gate. It is a long trail with swamps on either side and shaded over by
large trees. At the end of the trail is a large mound of dirt and two fence
posts that were once a gate. As it is said this was the trail walked by
captured spies of the union army on their way to be hung. This gate was
the last thing they saw before being led to the tree that stands beyond,
where they died. Walking the trail one can still hear the sobs and whispered
prayers of the men and some women who walked their last steps here. In
the later 80's and early 90's this was a popular place for satanic rituals
and I in fact have seen some of the "leftovers" the next day. I will no
longer go to this part of the park and by all means avoid it at night.</b>
<br><b>If I were you I'd pretty much stay clear of this park. But for those
of you looking for a little adventure this is definitely the place to be
and even if you do not experience any of the haunts the energy that abounds
can be felt anytime.</b><b></b>
<p>

<br><b>South Africa</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: cmss@iafrica.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>The haunting is on a long dusty road with no houses on either side
just large, really large trees. You drive about 500m up the road and you
come to an opening on your left where a old house used to be (there is
just the foundation on the ground now) You stop on the side of the road
in your car, and wait.&nbsp; If you flicker your lights once or twice,
you see far in the distance a small moving light, one of a motorbike, but
you hear no sound and see no bike.&nbsp; The light moves closer and closer
towards you and dissapears.&nbsp; Again you flicker your lights, and the
light appears again, but this time it is right infront of you, as it approaches
your car it seems to go right through the car then dissapears again.&nbsp;
At this point you are terrified and will most probably leave in a hurry.</b>
<br><b>Some brave characters even get out of there car and have a walk
around.</b>
<br><b>You must go anytime after midnight, and when you stop the car&nbsp;
you must leave the lights off and the engine musn't be running.If you carry
on up the road you will notice there is no sign of life, no place for some
person playing a trick on anyone to go or come from. When you see the light
you can quickly drive straight towards it, it will disapear but you can
try and catch the person who is playing a prank and you and you will come
to this conclusion; if they were on a bicycle or on foot with a torch or
headlight, they could not get away quick enough, and if they were on a
motorbike you would obviously hear the sound of the engine.&nbsp; As he
haunts the road there is no noise to be heard and no harm to come to anyone
who dare go there.&nbsp; There is just the light of a lonely heartbroken
soul.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The story came about many years ago.&nbsp; Vereeniging is&nbsp;
place of farm houses and plots, on this paticular road a family of mother
and father and two sons lived on one side, and directly across lived, mother,
father, daughter and two sons. The son from the one side and the daughter
from the other in time fell deeply in love, but had to keep it a big secret
from there family's as both families despised each other.&nbsp; They were
lovers for years, he would go out riding on his motorbike and meet her
out in the plots far from there parents, but one fateful day the brothers
of the young girl followed her to her meeting place and caught the two
lovers.&nbsp; They didn't let there presence known, but came up with a
wicked plan to stop this love affair.</b>
<br><b>Back up at there homes they got themselves some sort of wire like
piano wire and tied it to a tree on one side of the road across to the
other side, also tieing it to a tree, so that when the young boy came speeding
up on his bike he would ride straight into in, slicing of his head.</b>
<br><b>But on that day he allowed his lover to ride his bike and he sat
on the back, as they came speeding up the road neither of them aware of
the fate, the wire sliced straight through her neck, slicing of her head,
and slicing his throat but without quite killing him.</b>
<br><b>As the bike tumbled to the ground, he stood up, holding his bloodied
neck, and realising what had happened to his loved one.&nbsp; He picked
her up, head and all and carried her across to her own house where her
brothers were hiding and her parents were working without any knowledge
of the mishap.</b>
<br><b>And there under one of those huge trees in the garden he lay her
to rest, and died minutes later in her arms.</b>
<br><b>Every night since that day, he has haunted that road on his motorbike,
he rides up and down it, maybe he is looking for revenge, maybe he is a
lost soul blaming himself for that fateful day. It is not quite sure what
came of the brothers or the rest of the family or even where the two lovers
where buried.&nbsp; I'm also not sure if the story is true or not, but
one thing is for sure, it leaves something to the imagination. I have witnessed
the haunting and have sat there in my car with a couple of friends and
watched the light appear and move straight towards us and through our car.</b>
<br><b>I will give you more info on this if you wish just let me know.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Eureka springs, Arkansas- Cresent hotel</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>It all started out to be a nice family vacation.&nbsp; In the month
of June my family and I stayed at the cresent hotel for two nights. We
heard of the idea that it was haunted but did not pay any attention to
the factor. We went on the ghost tour that night and the tour guide lead
us into the morgue. The morgue consisted of a hallway and a room lit with
blacklights. The blacklights were used so the tourists could see shadows
more distinctly. While on the tour I did&nbsp; not see anything unusual
or scary. I actually thought that for a moment that I just waisted my money
on this so called ghost tour. After the tour was over we decided to go
back to the room and rest for awhile. We thought that the whole hotel was
open to all the guests, but I guess that we were wrong.&nbsp; That night
at about 12:00 a.m we decided to give ourself a personal tour and walk
around by ourselves. We went to the basement and into the morge and suprisingly
it was unlocked. I heard strange music that was drawing me towards the
door. I followed it to the morgue room door and tried to open it, but it
would not budge. The other members of my family tried to push the door
open, but had no luck either. At that time the music quit and we heard
a moaning coming from behind the door. We all got quiet and the moan got
louder and louder. About 10 seconds later there was three masive bangs
on the door. Everyone ran exept for me. Something was drawing me to the
door. Finally after about a minute of it I snapped out of it and ran for
the exit. The lady from the lobby ran down therte because of the screams
and told us that we were not susposed to be down there so we all left.
That was the most horrifying situation in my life, but I will be returning
in October. Many people who read this may not believe my story, but the
only way to find out is to check it out for yourself</b><b></b>

<br><b>Forever Haunted</b><b></b>

<p><b>I've grown up in haunted houses pretty much all my life, but the

Wisconsin</b>
<br><b>from northest Indiana about four years ago and bought a house that
I lived in</b>
<br><b>alone.&nbsp; From the minute I moved in I never felt like I was
the only one in</b>
<br><b>the house.&nbsp; One night as I was taking a load of laundry to
the basement.&nbsp;&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was on the landing getting ready to take the first step when I suddenly
felt</b>
<br><b>like what can only be described as a finger poking me playfully
on the left</b>
<br><b>hip.&nbsp; I say playfully because I don't really think it meant
to push me down</b>
<br><b>the stairs although I almost lost my balance!!&nbsp; The next experience
happened</b>
<br><b>to my mother.&nbsp; I was away for the week and my parents stayed
at my house for</b>
<br><b>the week.&nbsp; My mother says that the air was really thick in
the house and she</b>
<br><b>felt some really bad vibes the first day.&nbsp; She went into my
bedroom to get</b>
<br><b>something and as she was exiting she felt something hit her in the
lower back</b>
<br><b>and when she turned around she saw a bottle of lotion rolling away
from her</b>
<br><b>on the floor.&nbsp; She said it couldn't have fallen off the table
and hit her</b>
<br><b>because the table it was resting on was over ten feet away from
her and the</b>
<br><b>table was lower than her waist and it would have had to shoot straight
up and</b>
<br><b>across the room in order to hit her.&nbsp; My mother said out loud,
"don't worry,</b>
<br><b>she's coming back friday night".&nbsp; My mother says that the tension
in the air</b>
<br><b>just went away and the rest of their stay was uneventful.&nbsp;
I have other tales</b>
<br><b>from my house if you are interested.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Fixer Upper</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mnorwood@bbvance.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've been reading all the stories on your site and have finally decided
to</b>
<br><b>tell a few of my own experiences.</b>
<br><b>I would say it all started when my family moved when I was 4 years
old (I am</b>
<br><b>30 now).&nbsp; We moved into a house that my parents purchaced from
one of the</b>
<br><b>founding families of our small town.&nbsp; The house was very old,
and had not</b>
<br><b>been well taken care of for several years.&nbsp; My father is very
handy with</b>
<br><b>carpentry, and decided that we could fix it up and make a wonderful
home out</b>
<br><b>of it.&nbsp; I must say, that my parents still live there to this
day, and it is</b>
<br><b>a beautiful old house, but I'm glad I no longer live there.&nbsp;
I still have</b>
<br><b>nightmares about that house.</b>
<br><b>First a little on the layout of the house:&nbsp; It's a large two
story house.</b>
<br><b>When you walk into the front door you are in the livingroom and
to the right</b>
<br><b>is a bedroom.&nbsp; At the time, straight in front of you, through
a doorway</b>
<br><b>would be a long hallway with a bedroom to the left and the kitchen
to the</b>
<br><b>right, and at the very end of the hall on the left was the bathroom,
and to</b>
<br><b>the right at 180 degree turn was a long dark stairwell that led
upstairs.</b>
<br><b>At the time we moved in, the upstairs was just one huge attic room,
and we</b>
<br><b>were not allowed up there at all.&nbsp; My parents had the bedroom
off of the</b>
<br><b>livingroom, and my older sister and I shared the other bedroom across
from</b>
<br><b>the kitchen.</b>
<br><b>I can remember laying in bed at night hearing footsteps coming down
the</b>
<br><b>stairs and being terrified.&nbsp; Anytime I had to go down the hall
to the</b>
<br><b>bathroom, I would drag someone with me because of the overwhelming
feeling</b>
<br><b>of someone being on the stairs watching me.&nbsp; There were times
when I would</b>
<br><b>be in the shower and have the bathroom door locked only to find
it open</b>
<br><b>slightly when I got out of the shower.&nbsp; One night in our bedroom,
I had</b>
<br><b>finally dozed off to sleep, when I was jolted awake by someone very
roughly</b>
<br><b>tickling me.&nbsp; My dad sometimes woke me up by tickling me, or
pulling on my</b>
<br><b>toes, but when I opened my eyes, it was pitch black, and no one
was in the</b>
<br><b>room but my sister, and she was sound asleep on the top bunk.&nbsp;
I spent a lot</b>
<br><b>of time on the rug by the bed in my parents room.</b>
<br><b>Finally, after much remodelling the upstairs was ready for us to
move into.</b>
<br><b>It consisted now of 2 large bedrooms on each side of a hallway at
the top of</b>
<br><b>the stairs and a small dormer room at the end of the hallway at
the front of</b>
<br><b>the house. My sister got the room to the right, and my parents took
the</b>
<br><b>largest room to the left.&nbsp; Being the smallest, you guessed
it, I got the</b>
<br><b>small dormer room.&nbsp; It seemed cozy so I didn't mind the small
space.&nbsp; It had</b>
<br><b>a huge walk-in closet with another smaller closet inside of it for
clothes</b>
<br><b>and such. It was really cool. (For a while).&nbsp; I'm not exactly
sure when</b>
<br><b>everything started, but I can remember waking up with a medium sized
dog in</b>
<br><b>the corner growling at me. (We didn't have a dog)&nbsp; This in
itself was scary</b>
<br><b>enough, but then I would wake up with my closet door slightly open.&nbsp;
I got</b>
<br><b>to where I hated my closet, so I would put a small rocking chair
in front of</b>
<br><b>the door.&nbsp; You guessed it, I would wake up and the chair would
be back in</b>
<br><b>it's place beside the door, and the door would be ajar.&nbsp; I
think there was</b>
<br><b>something evil in that room, but something good also there to protect
me.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>can remember frequently, in a dreamlike haze, being chased out of
my room</b>
<br><b>straight toward the stairs and being pushed, but then not falling,
but sort</b>
<br><b>of bouncing gracefully down several stairs at a time.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I know that this</b>
<br><b>would actually happen because sometimes my dad would hear me jump
out of bed</b>
<br><b>and he would catch me before I got to the top of the stairs, and
he could</b>
<br><b>not belive the force that I hit him with.&nbsp; I was pushed down
the stairs a</b>
<br><b>couple of times.&nbsp; Once with my dad standing with me, and he
caught me by the</b>
<br><b>ankle, and kept me from falling down the 18 steps.</b>
<br><b>I have many more stories, but this is already too long.&nbsp; The
next time I</b>
<br><b>write I will tell some of the ones about when I took over my parents
room,</b>
<br><b>and they moved downstairs.</b><b></b>

<p><b>ESP Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jai@anjai.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I just finished reading your section on ESP and Dreams. I have been
really</b>
<br><b>interested in the paranormal most of my life. Nothing has ever really
scared</b>
<br><b>me or made my hair stand on end...and, I think, being confronted
with a</b>
<br><b>ghost or presence. However, it has yet to happen. But, I have had</b>
<br><b>premonitory dreams and possibly a "dream" of my dead uncle. I will
attempt</b>
<br><b>to explain a couple of instances in the hopes maybe you can affirm
my</b>
<br><b>conclusions [you can post my note if you wish :-)].</b>
<br><b>I am pretty close to my mother's aunt and uncle and their family.
They have</b>
<br><b>six kids and the youngest is only 4 years older than I am. We are
pretty</b>
<br><b>close...as close as we can be since my family is a military family
and we</b>
<br><b>moved every 4 years. Anyway, about 6 years ago I had a dream the
Maria, my</b>
<br><b>cousin, was pregnant. About 2 months later she called me up, out
of the</b>
<br><b>blue, and said, "Guess what?" And I said, "You're pregnant." She
asked how I</b>
<br><b>knew and I told her of my dream. I've had a couple other "premonitory"</b>
<br><b>dreams like that before in my life...but not as often as I would
like.</b>
<br><b>Along the same family ties, it was about 3 years ago when my mother's
uncle</b>
<br><b>decided to go on a one-day hunting trip in the mountains around
his home. I</b>
<br><b>was getting ready to move to Germany about that time. We were actually</b>
<br><b>living in a hotel at the time I found out that my uncle never came
home. By</b>
<br><b>the time I found out about it, a week had gone by and my husband
and I were</b>
<br><b>flying in 2 days time. I did call and found out all I could. Speculation
was</b>
<br><b>going around from a heart attack to kidnapping. The whole family
was a</b>
<br><b>wreck. They had the Air Force out looking for him, but it was winter
and in</b>
<br><b>the mountains, snow could cover anything. There was no sign of my
uncle.</b>
<br><b>Over the next few weeks, I actually had dreams about my uncle. Nothing</b>
<br><b>spectacular. Only, he would come visit me. One minute he would be
in my</b>
<br><b>house, the next, I would be sitting on his lap in his chair in his
house,</b>
<br><b>like I did when I was small. Only I wasn't small. And, it was his
new</b>
<br><b>house...similar to his old with additions like being more spacious
and a</b>
<br><b>pool. All we did was talk. It was a very nice dream. But when I
woke up, I</b>
<br><b>just knew he was gone. They didn't find his truck or him until June
when the</b>
<br><b>snow melted. Seems it must have been lunch time when he had a heart
attack.</b>
<br><b>The truck fell off the mountain road and was buried in a snow drift.)</b>
<br><b>My husband and I have a pretty good connection. We truly are soul
mates and</b>
<br><b>I believe that has given us the benefit of being extra close. There
have</b>
<br><b>been times when we were apart that we have felt each other's presence.
The</b>
<br><b>last time I have any feeling was when my husband first went to Kosovo
last</b>
<br><b>year. It was about a week or so after he left. I was working diligently
on</b>
<br><b>the general's computer in his house, alone, when I heard, clear
as day, my</b>
<br><b>husband call for me. Unconsciously, I responded. I looked up from
the</b>
<br><b>computer to realize exactly where I was and where my husband was.
And, it</b>
<br><b>made me smile.</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Encountered</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mclaughlin2000@mindspring.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>i had an experience back when i was a kid, i'm 30 yrs old, as well
as my</b>
<br><b>mom. i rememeber it like it was yesterday. like i said i was a kid,
along</b>
<br><b>with my 2 sisters, one older and one younger than me. it was around
dinner</b>
<br><b>time and my father was working late. my mother was washing the dishes
when</b>
<br><b>we were in the living room watching tv when our mom walked into
the living</b>
<br><b>room and asked who was watching her. we all looked at her like 'what
are you</b>
<br><b>talking about?'and still our mom had a puzzled look on her face
like she was</b>
<br><b>going crazy. later, after everyone went to bed i recall my self
waking up</b>
<br><b>out of a sound sleep even though no noise had woke me up. i woke
up staring</b>
<br><b>at the corner of two walls my bed was up against. i was freezing
even though</b>
<br><b>my windows were closed, my blanket over me and the night was still.
at the</b>
<br><b>same time i woke up i felt like someone was standing right next
to my bed</b>
<br><b>watching me. i tried to turn around and see who was there but i
was frozen</b>
<br><b>like someone was holding me still. i was scared and calm at the
same time,</b>
<br><b>how is that people keep wondering every time i talk about it. i
was scared</b>
<br><b>of whoever might be there but my instincts told me its alright,
don't be</b>
<br><b>afraid. when i turned around with every bit i had, expecting one
of my</b>
<br><b>sisters there, and there was nobody anywhere. my door was open slightly
to</b>
<br><b>let the light from the bathroom nightlite in my room. i was definitely</b>
<br><b>afraid of the dark, after that. then i went back to bed but facing
the</b>
<br><b>direction of 'whoever' and slowly went to sleep. when i awoke nothing
was</b>
<br><b>different, mom was making her coffee, my sisters were laying around.
then</b>
<br><b>the phone rang. our mom was talking to my grandmom with a surprised
look on</b>
<br><b>her face, then hung up the phone. she told us her grandfather had
passed</b>
<br><b>away yesterday. my mom hated her grandfather because he was always
a grouch</b>
<br><b>and he wanted to have nothing to do with anybody, so he died a lonely
man.</b>
<br><b>my mom thinks it was he who was watching her while she was doing
the dishes</b>
<br><b>and she caught him through the corner of her eye. when she turned
he was</b>
<br><b>gone. she also thinks he came to her that night to ask her for forgiveness</b>
<br><b>and she did. but why did he come see me? he wanted to see his great</b>
<br><b>grandchild before he went which is alright with me.</b>

<br><b>&nbsp; Eddie house in Chittenden Vermont</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: sspencer@nc.rr.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Many years ago a book was written on this house that is located near
where I</b>
<br><b>used to live.&nbsp; The book is called "The world beyond"&nbsp;
I can't find any info</b>
<br><b>on this or on the internet.&nbsp; I have seen the house and been
inside one time.</b>
<br><b>And that was the last time!&nbsp; Not many people talk about it,
but many know of</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; The family was the original settlers in the Chittenden
area, and were</b>
<br><b>involved in the occult.&nbsp; Many stories branch off from this.&nbsp;
Some dealing</b>
<br><b>with old Indian burial grounds near there.&nbsp; There is a poltergeist?
or</b>
<br><b>something there.&nbsp; I have seen the work first hand.&nbsp; The
house has changed</b>
<br><b>owners many times, the last of which I knew, the house was a lodge
for</b>
<br><b>skiers.&nbsp; At the time I think it is again empty and or for sale.&nbsp;
This place</b>
<br><b>has a long history which itself is intriguing.&nbsp; If your up
for a good</b>
<br><b>history lesson, check it out.&nbsp; Better yet, stay there!&nbsp;
It gets good about</b>
<br><b>1:00 - 3:00 am.&nbsp; That was the time frame when the doors swung
shut on us in</b>

<br><b>Dream</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kristie.bishop@detroit.appnet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>It isn't exactly a haunting for me, but for my fianc&eacute;'s mother,
it is.&nbsp;&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>fianc&eacute;e and I were seeing each other for about 6 months when
this happened.</b>
<br><b>I was at his mother house, where he lived at the time, and it was
getting</b>
<br><b>very late.&nbsp; A storm was approaching, so she told me I could
stay the night</b>
<br><b>(they lived about 45 miles from me, so it would have been a very
long ride</b>
<br><b>home).&nbsp; We sat up talking for a while about life and other
such things.</b>
<br><b>The upstairs of her house is much like a loft.&nbsp; A small open
room with a</b>
<br><b>closet at one end and the attic entrance in the main area of the
room.</b>
<br><b>There was a little bed situated under the window next to the attic
entrance.</b>
<br><b>It was about 2am when we decided to go to bed.&nbsp; My fianc&eacute;e
took me upstairs</b>
<br><b>to "tuck" me in.&nbsp; I had a really strange feeling up there and
I didn't want</b>
<br><b>him to leave.&nbsp; Finally, he clamed my nerves down.</b>
<br><b>I was sleeping for I would say close to an hour.&nbsp; I started
having the</b>
<br><b>strangest dream I have ever had.&nbsp; A fairly old lady came to
me in my dream.</b>
<br><b>She was wearing a nice dress and had on pearls, and her hair was
fixed.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>sat on the end of the bed and called me over to sit next to her.&nbsp;
I sat</b>
<br><b>there with her.&nbsp; We were talking.&nbsp; I don't recall what
the conversation was</b>
<br><b>about, but it was brief.&nbsp; I awoke after the dream was over.&nbsp;
I had this</b>
<br><b>overwhelming sense of comfort and warmth.&nbsp; I glanced over to
the stairs and</b>
<br><b>noticed a shadow of a person walking down the stairs.&nbsp; Needless-to-say,
I</b>
<br><b>pulled the covers over my head and slept that way the rest of the
night.</b>
<br><b>When we all woke in the morning, we gathered for breakfast.&nbsp;
There was</b>
<br><b>something strange in the air, I could feel it.&nbsp; After breakfast
I sat</b>
<br><b>outside with my fianc&eacute;e.&nbsp; I asked him if he had come
upstairs during the</b>
<br><b>night.&nbsp; He looked at me like I was crazy.&nbsp; He told me
that he didn't even</b>
<br><b>come up from the basement all night.&nbsp; Then I told him what
happened, the</b>
<br><b>dream and the shadow.&nbsp; I described to him the lady in my dream.&nbsp;
He took me</b>
<br><b>inside then and took out an old photo album.&nbsp; He turned to
a page in the</b>
<br><b>middle to show me a picture.&nbsp; I freaked out, the lady in the
picture was the</b>
<br><b>lady in my dream.&nbsp; Apparently, his grandmother visited me in
my dream (his</b>
<br><b>grandmother was dead for about 10 years at this time).&nbsp; We
decided it would</b>
<br><b>be best not to tell his mother, she gets weird about that kind of
stuff.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>assumed at that point that the shadow I saw was her.</b>
<br><b>Later that day, his mom told us that she was visited by grandma
that night.</b>
<br><b>It was about the same time that I saw the shadow going downstairs.&nbsp;
Come to</b>
<br><b>find out, his grandma spent a lot of time upstairs reading and sewing.&nbsp;
When</b>
<br><b>I went upstairs to gather my things, I noticed that the sewing machine
was</b>
<br><b>uncovered and her favorite book was laying opened on the desk as
if someone</b>
<br><b>had been reading it.</b>
<br><b>I have a couple other incidences that I would love to share with
you later.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Dream Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mjustice@wwgap.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have actually had several unexplained things occur in my parents
house but that's another set of stories.&nbsp; This story concerns my aunt
and her daughter.&nbsp; Seems the daughter was approx. 19 and was dating
a young man the same age or a year older.&nbsp; They had dated a while
and at one point actually planned to marry.&nbsp; Things changed between
the two and they broke up.&nbsp; The young man however, didn't want to
split and conspired to "win her back".&nbsp; He, along with a friend concocted
a plan where they would go hunting, the young man a little earlier and
his friend 30 mins. later.&nbsp; The young man intended to "accidentally"
shot himself, but not "seriously" to play upon my cousins sympathies and
maybe re-unite with her.&nbsp; Well off he went and he managed to some
how give himself a minor wound in the leg.&nbsp; Trouble is, his friend
for some reason did not follow him 30 mins. later, some emergency came
up or they had miss-communicated when they were going to pull this off,
in any case he didn't show as planned.&nbsp; Even though the wound was
minor, he could not make it to help and eventually bled to death in the
woods.&nbsp; He was found later on in the day already dead.</b>
<br><b>Now the part of my aunt comes into play.&nbsp; That night, when
she was sleeping my aunt had a dream/vision/visitation, from the young
man.&nbsp; He told her not to be frightened but that he had a message he
wanted to tell her for her daughter.&nbsp; He told her to go to the library
of the house and to go to a certain book on a certain row on the shelves,
that in it contained a letter he had placed there to her daughter as they
were breaking up telling her good bye.&nbsp; Then he vanished.&nbsp; The
next morning my aunt went to the library and she found the book in the
exact spot she was told to look for and opened it, in it was a letter un-opened
to her daughter in the young mans handwriting on the front and a letter
from him inside...</b>

<p><b>Dog Named Dudley</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gig1@creative-net.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, just one quick story on our deceased dog "Dudley".&nbsp; Dudley
was a Dachshund and lived to be 17 yrs. old.&nbsp; He loved to play with
an old basketball we kept in a closet by pushing it up and down the hallway
with his head and barking at it the whole time he was nudging it.&nbsp;
I say kept it in a closet because he had no sense with that ball...he would
literally push it until he collapsed so we let him play with it only with
supervision.&nbsp; After he was put to sleep, because of his extended years,
for months we kept picking the basketball up out of the hall floor and
returning it to the closet where it was supposed to be.&nbsp; It happened
so many times, later we threw the ball away because it upset us too much
seeing it there.&nbsp; After the ball was gone we started hearing him whine
and scratch on the closet door.&nbsp; This went on for days and it stopped
as suddenly as it started.&nbsp; Some say animals don't have a soul or
have an afterlife...I can attest they do...please visit my site at www.geocities.com/hauntingly_yours
and see the other entities we live with.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Do I Need Help?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cbrownlee@CSIDS.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My encounters also began as a child. I have never actually seen faces
or</b>
<br><b>colors, I have only seen shadows.</b>
<br><b>Some in the shape of humans and some shadows can only be best described
from</b>
<br><b>the movie The Haunting.</b>
<br><b>It is a large figure with a very obscure shape that I have seen
several</b>
<br><b>times looming over me and beside me on the wall. The shadows very
rarely</b>
<br><b>stay long enough to really be focused on, as soon as I am aware
of their</b>
<br><b>presence they disappear. The shadows that are actually shaped like
humans do</b>
<br><b>stay. In the middle of the night I would wake up for no reason at
all and</b>
<br><b>see the shadow either above me or beside me, as I stated before.
There has</b>
<br><b>only been one time where the ghost, spirit, entity, poltergeist,
actually</b>
<br><b>woke me up by shaking my legs. And as soon as I awoke, there was
nothing.</b>
<br><b>Until I confirmed my sightings with my older sister, I thought my
eyes were</b>
<br><b>just playing tricks on me. She has not had any encounters since
her</b>
<br><b>childhood, but mine have continued. Every night we both could hear
voices.</b>
<br><b>As if people were having a conversation, but no matter how hard
we tried to</b>
<br><b>listen, we were unable to understand what they were saying.&nbsp;
My encounters</b>
<br><b>did stop for about 5 years. But have since come back.</b>
<br><b>My Father-in law as well as my Grandfather have just recently died.
Just</b>
<br><b>this week, Oct. 22 - Oct. 26, very unusual things have been occurring
in my</b>
<br><b>apartment. (I have lived in apartments all my life) The morning
of October</b>
<br><b>25, 2000, I got up just like I do every morning and began getting
ready for</b>
<br><b>work. I came out of the bathroom and our television turned itself
on. At</b>
<br><b>first I thought that my husband had rolled over on to the remote
control,</b>
<br><b>but I then noticed that it was still on the nightstand where I placed
it the</b>
<br><b>night before. The night before that I was awakened by a rather loud
knocking</b>
<br><b>sound coming from the kitchen. I did not get up to investigate.
The morning</b>
<br><b>of October 26, 2000 the television did not turn itself on, but did
begin to</b>
<br><b>change channels. It first went to the next channel up then after
a while it</b>
<br><b>wanted to go to specific channels. Only one number would come on
the screen</b>
<br><b>as if it was waiting for the next number to be put in. The first
number that</b>
<br><b>came up was 3-. Then 2-3 minutes later it was 9-.&nbsp; If I had
not had any</b>
<br><b>previous encounters, this would be very easily dismissible. I almost
have a</b>
<br><b>feeling that I could possibly be my husband's father, since most
of the</b>
<br><b>events occur when he is present. I don't know what to make of the
all this</b>
<br><b>because this is the first time that something or someone has tried
so hard</b>
<br><b>to be noticed. I am not sure of anything anymore and I don't know
if I</b>
<br><b>should be afraid. I will let you know more as I know more.</b>

<br><b>Decorating Ghost?</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: SMSDES@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I live in a typical California tract home in Huntington Beach
, Ca.</b>
<br><b>I bought my home in the early 80's and began a long process of renovation.</b>
<br><b>The house is relatively new by some standards, built in the 60's.&nbsp;
So the</b>
<br><b>idea of it being haunted wasnt on the top of my list ( I have lived
in a pre</b>
<br><b>world war 1 home that was very haunted, I will tell you this story
too).</b>
<br><b>After a long day of painting and wallpapering the kitchen, I found
myself</b>
<br><b>alone as everyone had gone off to bed.&nbsp; As I stood looking
at the new</b>
<br><b>wallpaper I couldnt help wondering if the original owners of the
house would</b>
<br><b>approve or even recognize their old home.</b>
<br><b>Moments later as I stood there the feel of a finger running teasingly
along</b>
<br><b>my back made me jump and turn around. I fully expected to find my
husband</b>
<br><b>standing there telling me to come to bed.&nbsp; There was no one
there!!! I looked</b>
<br><b>to see if something had fallen off a shelf and brushed me, but the
area was</b>
<br><b>completely clear .&nbsp; I didn't get a scared feeling, the feeling
was one of</b>
<br><b>approval and fun.&nbsp; Was my ghost giving me it's approval of
the new decor?</b>
<br><b>Was it someone I had known making a visit.&nbsp; I ran in to the
bedroom and woke</b>
<br><b>my husband to tell him what had just happened.&nbsp; I think he
was more shocked</b>
<br><b>at my reaction of not being frightened ( as I have been very freak
out by</b>
<br><b>"visitors" in the past).&nbsp; We now refer to our "decorating angel"
whenever we</b>
<br><b>are doing another project around our home.</b>
<br><b>Note: my 18 year old son has "seen" a shadowy visitor in our hallway
on more</b>
<br><b>than one ocassion, it is never malevolent , only a bit of that "Whoa!"</b>
<br><b>feeling.</b>
<br><b>Our other very scary home ( which we left in a big hurry) was one
we rented</b>
<br><b>in the early 70's in Redondo Beach, Ca. (551 Juanita st.)</b>
<br><b>This small pre WW1 house sat on a large parcel of land.&nbsp; We
couldnt believe</b>
<br><b>our luck at finding a house for such reasonable rent at the beach.</b>
<br><b>My husband and I were to be married that summer and the thought
of living in</b>
<br><b>a beach home for our first months of married life sounded like heaven.</b>
<br><b>We scraped together our money and signed a lease for the summer.&nbsp;
The house</b>
<br><b>was a bit drab.&nbsp; The small rooms painted a sickly pistachio
green didnt help.</b>
<br><b>We moved our furniture in and tried to make it feel warm and comfortable.
But</b>
<br><b>Nothing seemed to help.</b>
<br><b>We had 2 bedrooms in this house.&nbsp; We chose the brighter corner
room for our</b>
<br><b>bedroom. and used the longer attached room for guests and a small
space for</b>
<br><b>my studio.</b>
<br><b>Our friends would drop by and all would comment on how cold the
studio always</b>
<br><b>felt.</b>
<br><b>I tried to ignore this , but other things started to happen.&nbsp;
The door to the</b>
<br><b>room would close by itself.&nbsp; Even when the house was draft
free.&nbsp; The feeling</b>
<br><b>of not being alone in the room would be over powering and evil at
times.</b>
<br><b>I started leaving the door to that room closed at all times.</b>
<br><b>We were known for throwing large Halloween parties and had invited
all who</b>
<br><b>had partied a bit hard to stay the night.&nbsp; We placed several
sleeping bags in</b>
<br><b>the extra room and the place was full by 2am.&nbsp; We had planned
on making</b>
<br><b>brunch for our guests as a surprise .</b>
<br><b>As we woke up and walked out to the living room, we noticed that
everyone was</b>
<br><b>now in the front of the house, several with freaked out looks on
their faces.</b>
<br><b>Not one person had slept the entire evening in that other room,
they had all</b>
<br><b>felt an evil&nbsp; presence and had to leave.</b>
<br><b>It made for a very interesting halloween .</b>
<br><b>That November, my husband was attending night classes at college
.&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>alone in the house when I heard voices.&nbsp; 2 distinct voices
as if they were in</b>
<br><b>the house.&nbsp; I ran to see where they came from and even went
outside and</b>
<br><b>looked all around the grounds.&nbsp; Nothing!</b>
<br><b>That same week, as my husband was napping on the couch, he awoke
with a start</b>
<br><b>and screamed.&nbsp; Standing over him was a dark shadowy figure
that hovered and</b>
<br><b>disappered.&nbsp; To say this was the straw that broke the camels
back is an</b>
<br><b>understatment.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;We started looking for a new house that very day.&nbsp; We
still had 2 months on</b>
<br><b>our lease, but there was no way we would stay .&nbsp; This was a
truly evil</b>
<br><b>feeling.</b>
<br><b>We never found out who or what it was.&nbsp; We have speculated
over the years</b>
<br><b>that someone may have died or committed suicide in that extra room.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Dearly Departed Grandfather</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: michelle_lincks@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Greetings, everyone!&nbsp; I don't claim to be an honest</b>
<br><b>believer of everything supernatural or paranormal by</b>
<br><b>nature.&nbsp; I.E., psychics, telekinesis, etc.&nbsp; But</b>
<br><b>certain things have happened to our family that just</b>
<br><b>don't happen in "normal" families.&nbsp; We look at ghosts</b>
<br><b>as something average, mundane even.&nbsp; Something is</b>
<br><b>always happening, so why should it be more than it is?</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I'm about to write about a case in point here.</b>
<br><b>January 17, 2000, my beloved grandfather died.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>seems odd this story, but it really wasn't.&nbsp; This all</b>
<br><b>actually took place that weekend, Saturday the 15th.</b>
<br><b>I was at my cousin Deanna's apartment for a little get</b>
<br><b>together.&nbsp; At about 10 p.m., her mom called to ask if</b>
<br><b>Dee had been to her house at all that day.&nbsp; Dee told</b>
<br><b>her that she had been busy all day cleaning and</b>
<br><b>shopping, and asked why her mom wanted to know.&nbsp; What</b>
<br><b>she told her still gives me the chills sometimes.</b>
<br><b>That morning my aunt had hung up a pair of freshly</b>
<br><b>washed curtains in her dining room.&nbsp; Understand that</b>
<br><b>my aunt has a thing for neatness.&nbsp; A place for</b>
<br><b>everything, yadda yadda.&nbsp; Well, her curtains were no</b>
<br><b>different.&nbsp; Exactly one inch from the floor.&nbsp; No more,</b>
<br><b>no less.&nbsp; (Trust me, this becomes relevant to the</b>
<br><b>story.)</b>
<br><b>That afternoon, my aunt and her boyfriend left to do</b>
<br><b>some running around.&nbsp; She put her old as the hills dog</b>
<br><b>in the garage.&nbsp; As they pulled out of the driveway, my</b>
<br><b>aunt said she should have left her porch light on.</b>
<br><b>Needless to say, she didn't get the chance as they</b>
<br><b>were already heading down the street.</b>
<br><b>Later on that evening, my aunt comes home.&nbsp; She is</b>
<br><b>greeted by the sight of her front porch light on.</b>
<br><b>(Nope, no timer on the light.&nbsp; And no motion sensor</b>
<br><b>either.)&nbsp; She goes in the house, and finds the back</b>
<br><b>porch light on as well.&nbsp; She also notices something</b>
<br><b>wrong with the curtains she hung up that day.&nbsp; Both</b>
<br><b>were touching the ground.&nbsp; Plus, the left side curtain</b>
<br><b>was turned around, facing outside.&nbsp; My aunt went from</b>
<br><b>the kitchen into the living room.&nbsp; There she found the</b>
<br><b>oddest thing.&nbsp; All of the rugs had been rolled up.</b>
<br><b>The biggest one, not very big at all, had been placed</b>
<br><b>in front of the couch.</b>
<br><b>My aunt, the poor dear, was thoroughly spooked now.</b>
<br><b>She thought she had an odd sort of burglar in her</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; One that like to fool with the curtains and</b>
<br><b>rugs, then turn on porch lights.&nbsp; She promptly ran to</b>
<br><b>her garage, where her dog was waiting.&nbsp; Luckily, she</b>
<br><b>had a phone connection out there.&nbsp; From the garage,</b>
<br><b>she proceeded to call my other cousin, Carolyn, from</b>
<br><b>down the street.&nbsp; As she talked to my cousin,</b>
<br><b>Carolyn's husband, John, and a neighbor came by to</b>
<br><b>check the house.&nbsp; My cousin asked her mom if there was</b>
<br><b>someone else with her.&nbsp; My aunt said no, and then</b>
<br><b>asked why.&nbsp; Carolyn told her that it sounded as if</b>
<br><b>someone had gotten on another line, listening to them.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;As she said that, both women heard an audible click,</b>
<br><b>as if someone had hung up one of the other two</b>
<br><b>extensions.</b>
<br><b>That was seconds before the men made it to the house.</b>
<br><b>They searched high and low, but found nothing amiss.</b>
<br><b>Everything was as it otherwise should be, sans the</b>
<br><b>burglar.</b>
<br><b>Pretty much out of her mind with fright, my aunt</b>
<br><b>refused to sleep by herself in the house.&nbsp; So, another</b>
<br><b>aunt was recruited to stay with her.&nbsp; Until then,</b>
<br><b>Deanna on the phone was the next best thing.</b>
<br><b>We eventually found out who was playing the pranks.</b>
<br><b>It was our great-uncle Kenny, our grandfather's older</b>
<br><b>brother, who had died when I was just a small girl.</b>
<br><b>Through the use of an Ouija board, he admitted his</b>
<br><b>guilt.&nbsp; He also told us of a big party that was to be</b>
<br><b>thrown for grandpa on that Thursday, the 20th.&nbsp; We had</b>
<br><b>no idea what he meant, of course.</b>
<br><b>Now comes Monday, January 17th.&nbsp; This is the point in</b>
<br><b>the story that kind of strikes me as odd, even for my</b>
<br><b>family.&nbsp; This is the only time where we've displayed</b>
<br><b>something close to psychic ability.&nbsp; Everyone seemed</b>
<br><b>to show up at my grandparents' house.&nbsp; Uncles, aunts</b>
<br><b>and cousins that I hadn't seen in months, all of a</b>
<br><b>sudden came out of the woodwork.&nbsp; You see, my grandpa</b>
<br><b>had been bedridden for a year with cancer.&nbsp; (Or, at</b>
<br><b>least that's what we believe he died of.)&nbsp; He seemed</b>
<br><b>to get worse at times, then he seemed to get better.</b>
<br><b>But this time it was as if everyone knew what was</b>
<br><b>going to happen next.</b>
<br><b>At about 5 that evening, my grandma asked me call</b>
<br><b>grandpa's two remaining sisters.&nbsp; They got to the</b>
<br><b>house by about 5:30, long enough to see grandpa.&nbsp; At</b>
<br><b>exactly 6 p.m., my sister's boyfriend, a paramedic,</b>
<br><b>yelled for my grandma.&nbsp; I had to hug myself to keep</b>
<br><b>from screaming.&nbsp; I knew what was coming.&nbsp; Grandpa was</b>
<br><b>dead. We all knew.&nbsp; We were all relieved and grieved.</b>
<br><b>Relieved that grandpa didn't have to suffer anymore.</b>
<br><b>And grieved for a big part of our lives that was lost</b>
<br><b>for good.&nbsp; The memories are still there, so he hasn't</b>
<br><b>really gone anywhere.&nbsp; That Thursday (January 20th) we</b>
<br><b>held the wake.&nbsp; I had never seen so many people.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>almost had to have the whole funeral parlor to</b>
<br><b>ourselves.&nbsp; Was that the big party Uncle Kenny</b>
<br><b>referred to?&nbsp; It's possible.</b>
<br><b>That's not quite the end of the story yet.&nbsp; There was</b>
<br><b>one more visitation to my aunt.&nbsp; She woke up one night</b>
<br><b>after the funeral for no apparent reason.&nbsp; She looked</b>
<br><b>over by her bedroom door, and saw both my grandpa and</b>
<br><b>his brother standing by the door.&nbsp; She said they both</b>
<br><b>smiled, waved to her, and told her to go to sleep.</b>
<br><b>She did as she was told.&nbsp; And, so far, we haven't</b>
<br><b>heard anything from them again.&nbsp; Yet.</b>
<br><b>Well, I want to thank you for letting me share my</b>
<br><b>story.&nbsp; It helps to tell this story.&nbsp; It's one of my</b>
<br><b>favorites.&nbsp; I have many more to tell, but at a later time.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Dead Man's Cliff</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; cjseamon@home.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Ambridge, Pennsylvania&nbsp; The cliff is a favorite gathering place
for high</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;school kids from the Beaver County area</b>
<br><b>to drink and have a good time.&nbsp; Back in 1994 a group of local
kids made their</b>
<br><b>way to their local drinking spot after a friday night highschool
football</b>
<br><b>game.&nbsp; The night started out just like any other friday night
with the kids</b>
<br><b>rolling in with their party balls, 40 oz. beers and cases of beer.&nbsp;
Around 12</b>
<br><b>AM in the morning it began to drizzle. Most of the kids were already
pretty</b>
<br><b>liquored up, so they decided to go to their buddy's house to continue
the</b>
<br><b>party and get out of the rain. On their way off the cliff Michael
Pellegreni</b>
<br><b>stopped because he forgot his jean jacket.&nbsp; He told his buddies
to meet him</b>
<br><b>back at house because he was going to go back and grab his jacket.&nbsp;
The group</b>
<br><b>of friends continued on their way and just when they were about
to reach the</b>
<br><b>house they heard a bloodcurdling scream. The boys ran back to find
that th!</b>
<br><b>eir buddy Mike had fallen off of the cliff while trying to retrieve
his</b>
<br><b>jacket.&nbsp; The cliff remained off limits for about a year and
a half until</b>
<br><b>local kids began to frequent it once again.&nbsp; On more than one
occassion the</b>
<br><b>kids have run off the cliff horrified at what they had seen. What
they had</b>
<br><b>seen was Mike waking the cliff. It is rumored that the ghost of
Michael</b>
<br><b>Pellegrini still walks the cliff in search of his jean jacket.&nbsp;
They say it</b>
<br><b>is as if he doesn't notice the kids, he just searches "Dead Man's
Cliff" for</b>
<br><b>his jacket.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Dad Still Around?</b><b></b>
<p><b>Altered_st@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>A ton of supernatural phenomenon surrounds the death of my father,
who in 1989 passed away suddenly and tragically. About two months before
his passing, my mother and I were attending a class concerning supernatural
activity. One night for kicks, they had a tarot reader come in and do a
few free readings for the class. I personally have/had little or no faith
in tarot/numerology, etc... but mom volunteered to participate. In her
reading, the death card came up - and the reader seemed surprised and uncomfortable
while explaining it didn't necessarily mean death, but rather a "major
change" that would occur in her life. While we thought it was a little
weird, we dismissed it and went on with our lives. Well, that major change
came two months later with the unforseen (to us anyway) passing of my father.</b>
<br><b>Within six months, strange things began happening around our house
and members of our immediate family. My father was a smoker - and the smell
had long since disappeared from our home. But quite often (daily?), we
would get a whiff of fresh smoke as we rounded a corner or were sitting
watching t.v. We heard heavy footsteps emanating from my parents' room
- which is right above the family room. This occurred at all times of the
day, even when I had friends over after school. The cats could (and still
can) be seen staring intently at something at the top of the stairs, or
on the lower stairwell. Lights and t.v. turned on and off, and cool breezes
would move through rooms with no open windows or doors. We would often
catch a glimpse of a human figure in a white t-shirt (my father's standard
dress) on the stairwell landing, and my mother woke one night to see a
gray mist hovering at the foot of her bed. Strangely, my sister experienced
relatively few of the happenings. Outside the home, mom's car would begin
smelling of cigarette smoke during her commute to work, and my grandmother
felt my father's presence with her at a church service. In addition to
all of this, we heard my father's 12-string guitar (which resides in its
case in an upstairs closet) strumming as we entered the house one evening,
and witnessed lights moving in the hallway at night, accompanied by an
intense feeling of being watched.</b>
<br><b>Most happenings have become much less frequent, and a lot of them
were one-time events. But activity continues at my mom's house. Mom finds
herself being tapped on the shoulders and arms at least a few times a week,
and the atmosphere feels charged upon entering the house. It seems that,
eleven years later, Dad is still poking around keeping an eye on the family
he was pulled away from so tragically. Ironically, it was my father who
used to poke fun at my mother and I for believing in all that ghost stuff.
It seems perhaps that one can retain their sense of humor in the great
beyond.</b>

<br><b>Coma Soul In Bayville</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: groovychainsaw@monmouth.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>For five years, my fiance S. rented a suburban house in Bayville,
N.J.&nbsp; To</b>
<br><b>manage the rent, he sublet the spare rooms to fellow bachelors.&nbsp;
In 1995 a</b>
<br><b>tragedy occurred.&nbsp; A new housemate -- an insulin diabetic with
an</b>
<br><b>unfortunate drinking problem -- celebrated his moving-in with a
case of</b>
<br><b>Milwaukee's finest and went into a deep coma.&nbsp; He was taken
away in an</b>
<br><b>ambulance, and his belongings retrieved by a relative.&nbsp; All
told, his</b>
<br><b>tenancy lasted no more than 24 hours.&nbsp; I never met this man,
but I felt pity</b>
<br><b>when I heard the news.</b>
<br><b>A year later, in early October 1996, S. asked me to move in while
we hunted</b>
<br><b>for an apartment of our own.&nbsp; This was the first time I'd been
to the house</b>
<br><b>since before the incident with the diabetic housemate, which I'd
pretty much</b>
<br><b>forgotten about.</b>
<br><b>Coming from a family of "sensitives", I've always practiced psychic</b>
<br><b>self-protection.&nbsp; Not even an enjoyable experience with the
"uncanny" can</b>
<br><b>change my belief that it's better to be cautious than sorry.&nbsp;
Spirits are</b>
<br><b>everywhere, and they are unpredictable strangers.&nbsp; So whenever
I moved, I</b>
<br><b>always cleanse &amp; bless my new living space, praying for the
rest of any</b>
<br><b>entities present.&nbsp; This time however, I felt my skeptical fiance
might not</b>
<br><b>understand my ritual.&nbsp; Since our stay would be short, I persuaded
myself</b>
<br><b>that there was no need to unpack all my tools &amp; carry out the</b>
<br><b>"housecleaning".&nbsp; After all, I'd been to the house on numerous
occasions and</b>
<br><b>never noticed or felt anything unusual.</b>
<br><b>But it wasn't long before I noticed some oddities.&nbsp; No matter
how warm or</b>
<br><b>bright it was outside, it was always cold &amp; dim inside.&nbsp;
The air in the</b>
<br><b>livingroom was blue, and its energy dragging &amp; sluggish as if
separated from</b>
<br><b>the rest of time.&nbsp; Objects and surfaces felt unaccountably
sticky and dirty</b>
<br><b>even when clean.&nbsp; I kept seeing things out of the corners of
my eyes--</b>
<br><b>flashes of movement across doorway openings and hallways, shadows
on walls</b>
<br><b>and floors.&nbsp; Most alarming was the basement staircase.&nbsp;
I invariably</b>
<br><b>received impressions of falling while walking down it.&nbsp; At
its foot, this</b>
<br><b>was replaced by the distinct sensation of being physically crowded,
as if</b>
<br><b>someone was standing or following you close enough to trip you.&nbsp;
I found I</b>
<br><b>could hardly spend more than a few minutes down there even with
S. in tow.</b>
<br><b>If forced by necessity to do any errand down there alone, I did
so literally</b>
<br><b>at a run.</b>
<br><b>As S. and I often worked opposing shifts, I spent a fair amount
of time in</b>
<br><b>the house without him.&nbsp; I always felt uneasy on my own there.&nbsp;
I soon found</b>
<br><b>my range of emotional alternatives diminishing sharply.&nbsp; I
seemed limited to</b>
<br><b>either irritability or depression, with no-inbetweens-- odd, since
I was</b>
<br><b>very happy to have joined my fiance.&nbsp; I felt dizzy, confused,
exhausted,</b>
<br><b>unable to focus, and always slightly nauseated.&nbsp; I found myself
having</b>
<br><b>inordinate difficulty speaking or understanding other people's speech.</b>
<br><b>There was no explanation for these maladies.</b>
<br><b>I suffer from mild narcolepsy, a miswiring in that part of the brain
which</b>
<br><b>controls descent into/ascent out of sleep.&nbsp; One symptom of
this neurological</b>
<br><b>disorder is catalepsy, or sleep paralysis.&nbsp; Catalepsy causes
speechlessness</b>
<br><b>and loss of muscular control in moments of emotional extremity,
but it</b>
<br><b>really hits you hard in the morning when you're trying to get up.&nbsp;
A</b>
<br><b>cataleptic suffers frequent "jump-start" difficulties upon waking--
most</b>
<br><b>often the mind is alert, but the body takes many minutes, sometimes
up to a</b>
<br><b>half-hour, to respond with movement.&nbsp; Catalepsy always seems
to go hand in</b>
<br><b>hand with insomnia, so getting to sleep is usually just as much
a problem as</b>
<br><b>getting out of it.</b>
<br><b>In this house, however, I'd feel myself dragged forcibly into a
sort of</b>
<br><b>"drowned" sleep as soon as I lay my head down.&nbsp; Dreams would
begin almost as</b>
<br><b>soon as I closed my eyes, and the time before I opened them again
seemed</b>
<br><b>filled by one long disturbing movie.&nbsp; I suffered intense frustration,
as if</b>
<br><b>I'd never been to sleep at all when in fact I'd been out cold for
nine</b>
<br><b>hours.&nbsp; I could never remember the dreams when I woke.&nbsp;
Only their theme</b>
<br><b>remained behind-- decay, slipping downward into a hole of death,
despair,</b>
<br><b>humiliation.&nbsp; S. reported that at least once every night in
that house, I</b>
<br><b>sat bolt upright in bed with a shriek, clutching him or the bedcovers.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>seemed delirious, incoherent, and would toss and turn fitfully before
going</b>
<br><b>back to sleep.</b>
<br><b>In the mornings my body felt like it'd been beaten.&nbsp; I was
in constant pain.</b>
<br><b>I sustained a great number of small injuries in the house, especially
to my</b>
<br><b>head-- constantly hitting or bumping it.&nbsp; I was covered with
a collection of</b>
<br><b>cuts, scrapes, and bruises.&nbsp; My balance and coordination were
off.&nbsp; The back</b>
<br><b>of my neck felt as though it were in a vise-- at times I could barely
lift</b>
<br><b>my head.&nbsp; I found myself having inordinate difficulty speaking
or even</b>
<br><b>understanding people's speech.&nbsp; My fiance and my coworkers
became worried.</b>
<br><b>We found a apartment in a nearby complex, but it wouldn't be vacant</b>
<br><b>immediately.&nbsp; S. and I secured the lease &amp; started to pack
and plan.&nbsp; At</b>
<br><b>this point, circumstances in the house changed considerably for
the worse.</b>
<br><b>I'd already begun to hate the house, and felt happy &amp; triumphant
to be</b>
<br><b>moving.&nbsp; Though depressed, I felt defiant as I knew I'd be
leaving soon, for</b>
<br><b>ever.&nbsp; The presence in the house did not take my defiance kindly.</b>
<br><b>It was as if some sort of focus on me increased.&nbsp; I felt freezing
cold at</b>
<br><b>all times, drained of energy, oppressed beyond description.&nbsp;
My balance</b>
<br><b>worsened to the point of feeling as though the ground were tipping
me off</b>
<br><b>its surface.&nbsp; I stumbled &amp; bumped into things constantly
now, even at work.</b>
<br><b>One of my housemates told me he'd had nothing but bad luck here.&nbsp;
Shortly</b>
<br><b>after moving in, he'd had a serious car accident which had forced
him to</b>
<br><b>spend weeks in pain confined to the house.&nbsp; He hoped to get
out of here</b>
<br><b>soon.</b>
<br><b>I began to see a figure out of the corner of my eye.&nbsp; It was
built like a</b>
<br><b>brick house, big &amp; intimidating, but with no features.&nbsp;
As soon as I walked</b>
<br><b>into the house now, it jumped right on me like a parasite.&nbsp;
I sensed -- not</b>
<br><b>heard -- constant shouting in my ear.&nbsp; It was angry and desperate.&nbsp;
Don't</b>
<br><b>go, you can't go, it said.&nbsp; Just as angrily I talked back to
it in my mind:</b>
<br><b>I WILL go, I AM going.&nbsp; I spent every waking hour in that house
arguing</b>
<br><b>silently with this presence, and only lost when I slept, because
then it did</b>
<br><b>what it pleased with my dreams.&nbsp; I would not give in, and neither
would it.</b>
<br><b>At the same time, my "unlucky" housemate started talking inexplicably
about</b>
<br><b>how much he loved the house and never wanted to leave.&nbsp; He
even talked about</b>
<br><b>buying it, something he was in no position to do.&nbsp; I told him
point-blank</b>
<br><b>that I thought it was a big mistake.&nbsp; Clearly this entity wanted
someone to</b>
<br><b>stay and would do anything to force one of us.</b>
<br><b>One late November night, when I couldn't think of doing laundry
in that</b>
<br><b>basement one more time, I loaded my duffel bags onto a cart &amp;
walked over to</b>
<br><b>the laundromat.&nbsp; There, for no apparent reason, an elderly
woman stole my</b>
<br><b>empty cart &amp; hid it in an abandoned parking lot across the highway.&nbsp;
I've</b>
<br><b>known this woman for some years &amp; can attest that she is in
full control of</b>
<br><b>her mental faculties.&nbsp; But that night she could not explain
what had</b>
<br><b>compelled her to do this.&nbsp; I went across the highway to retrieve
my cart,</b>
<br><b>and suddenly found myself lying flat on my back in the parking lot
with the</b>
<br><b>cart on top of me.&nbsp; At that moment I heard a mocking laugh,
but there was no</b>
<br><b>one in sight.&nbsp; Covered with mud and contusions, I walked back
into the</b>
<br><b>laundromat, collected my clothing under the staring gaze of half
the</b>
<br><b>patrons, and limped home.&nbsp; As soon as I closed the front door
behind me, I</b>
<br><b>had what some people call a "psychic slap in the face".&nbsp; The
voice in my ear</b>
<br><b>said very clearly, "See?&nbsp; YOU ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE."&nbsp;
When he came home,</b>
<br><b>my fiance found me lying on the bed, in tears and unable to move.</b>
<br><b>A second "accident" occurred near Christmas.&nbsp; S. and I were
at my parents'</b>
<br><b>house two towns over.&nbsp; This time, I'd brought my laundry with
me to do</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; While the others watched a movie in the livingroom,
I went upstairs</b>
<br><b>to turn on the dryer.&nbsp; The dryer hose won't ventilate unless
it is rigged to</b>
<br><b>reach the window in the room across the hall.&nbsp; I took the hose
into this</b>
<br><b>room and opened the window.&nbsp; What happened next is inexplicable.</b>
<br><b>Now, I lived in this house for half my life, I knew everything in
it like</b>
<br><b>the back of my hand, even the placement of the furniture.&nbsp;
To this day I can</b>
<br><b>walk through my parents' house in pitch darkness without bumping
into</b>
<br><b>anything.&nbsp; In addition, I have very good night vision and have
no trouble</b>
