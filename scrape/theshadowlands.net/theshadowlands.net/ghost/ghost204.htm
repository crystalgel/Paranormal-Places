<p><b>A Real Experience!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sunedeh@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm 17 years old, in my whole life, I've had one dearly loved person
die.</b>
<br><b>My grandfather was 76 when he died of bone cancer.&nbsp; I have
a 20 month old</b>
<br><b>cousin who had a special bond with him.&nbsp; My cousins parents
were truckers,</b>
<br><b>and it being summer, they asked me to care for their baby for a
month.&nbsp; They</b>
<br><b>left their son in my care, and what I gained in that experience
is that I'm</b>
<br><b>glad that I'm not a teenage mom.&nbsp; A week and a half after they
left for the</b>
<br><b>road, my grandfather died.&nbsp; The morning he died, my cousin
woke up crying.</b>
<br><b>We couldn't understand why, we tried feeding him, changing his diapers,</b>
<br><b>cuddling him.&nbsp; He would not stop.&nbsp; Fifteen minutes later,
our phone rang.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>don't remember exactly when he stopped crying, but it was during
the</b>
<br><b>conversation and before my mom was given the news.&nbsp; I remember
she started</b>
<br><b>to cry and she said "When?" and that's when I knew that he was gone,
she was</b>
<br><b>told he passed away 15 minutes before the call was made.&nbsp; I
started to cry.</b>
<br><b>My cousin comforted me, being all of 13 months at the time.&nbsp;
At one time, my</b>
<br><b>brother was putting the movies into our movie box, and our cousin
walked up</b>
<br><b>to him and put his head on my brothers shoulder and put his tiny
arm around</b>
<br><b>him and patting him on the back.&nbsp; My mom called our Bishop,
he came and</b>
<br><b>blessed us.&nbsp; He told us that his mother believed that when
someone dies,</b>
<br><b>they visit the little ones.&nbsp; My cousin, being the littlest
at the time and</b>
<br><b>having had the bond between him and our grandfather.&nbsp; I was
sad, the last</b>
<br><b>time I had seen my grandfather was the Christmas before, I never
got to tell</b>
<br><b>him that I loved him, and to say good-bye.&nbsp; He knew I loved
him though.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>dreamt one night, that I was at my grandparents home.&nbsp; *Everytime
we went to</b>
<br><b>visit, my grandfather used to stand up and see who was at the door.*&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>walked into their house, and he stood up.&nbsp; He smiled and chuckled
and I knew</b>
<br><b>that he was fine.&nbsp; Everytime I think of this I cry.&nbsp; When
my grandfather was</b>
<br><b>diagnosed, he was given two years to live; but within five months,
he passed</b>
<br><b>away.&nbsp; We're all glad that he never has to live through that
kind of pain</b>
<br><b>again, and we miss him.&nbsp; With all our hearts.</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Recent Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: AHAMES@centralbankofturkey.fsbusiness.co.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have sent some stories to you previously, explaining my life long
ability to see ghosts.&nbsp; But, until now I have not been totally able
to pass on messages from them.</b>
<br><b>For the 18 months I have been working very closely with a lovely
Turkish lady who lost her two young sons in the terrible earth quake Turkey
suffered in August 1999.&nbsp; As I had experienced many deaths of those
close to me, we talked alot and forged a very strong bond.</b>
<br><b>For months we had encouraged her to become pregnant and have another
child as she is a natural mother.&nbsp; Finally last July she announced
that she was expecting.</b>
<br><b>A few months into the pregnacy she became very depressed and worried
that her sons would be angry about the new baby.&nbsp; We all felt for
her but there was nothing we could do.</b>
<br><b>Until, one night i was sleeping ver restlessly, and when i finally
dropped off, I dreamed of being at work and her two boys visited me, what
is amazing is that although i had seen pictures of them when they were
young i didn't really know what they looked like or how they were personally.&nbsp;
But, everything i saw was increddibly accurate, even down to how they behaved
with me.&nbsp; They told me that they were very excited about the baby
and they were worried about thier mother because she was sad.&nbsp; After
telling her this her mood changed instantly.</b>
<br><b>Shortly after the birth of her daughter this feb, I had another
dream where they boys visited me.&nbsp; This time i was in thier bedroom
and they told me that thier mother should give them the comfort blanket
that they had both used, and that the babies hand's and feet were exactly
the same as the oldest sons were.&nbsp; Again I told my friend this an
I was totally accurate.</b>
<br><b>Both my friend and her husband believe that thier sons are talking
to me because i am able to hear them, and It is really helping them through
a very hard time.</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Third Hand Tale</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Paulj.Wilson@btinternet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>At the end of the 1980's a good friend of mine moved into an apartment
in the East Lothinn (Scotland) village of Ormiston.&nbsp; Nothing out of
the ordinary happened for a long time but the first thing she and her husband
noticed was that things got interfiered with.&nbsp; The settings on the
cooker and oven would be altered, either up or down, without anyone having
gone into the kitchen.&nbsp; During the night, the TV and/or lamps would
come on.&nbsp; Eventually they developed a routine where before going to
bed she would go around the room switching off appliances, un pluging them
from the outlets and he would go around after her to check it had been
done.&nbsp; In the morning they would often find plugs back in their outlets
and appliances turned back on.&nbsp; The only other manifistation was one
day when Lynn was exercising in the livingroom on an exercise bike and
despite being in the house on her own she disticly heard a child lauging
from the other end of the room, but nothing could be seen.&nbsp; On questioning
the previous owner of the apartment, he confessed to haveing experienced
all of the same things over the years he had lived their.</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Very Special Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: david1@nextgen.net.mt</b><b></b>
<p><b>"when my parents got married they moved into a very small flat ,just
3 rooms .the first night they got in they were in bed when they heared
strange noises coming from the kitchen .At first they ignored it&nbsp;
but the sound was getting louder and louder .So they decided straight away
to go to my granny's home that lived near by . But when they went home
again a couple of days later the sounds were the same .Then she was pregnant
with me and for example when my dad use to help her washing the floor and
he was sure that the floor cloth was there he wouldn't find it and then
he used to say"if you really want it you can have it"and go to the other
room he used to find it. Then i was born and since I was the only child
in the family i had no children to play with I&nbsp; used to play with
the mirror in the bedroom .I knew i wasn't playing alone cause when I throw
the ball the ball would came back to me .My parents&nbsp; got worried a
lot and once they asked me with who I was playing and i told them with
a man . His hair was long and dark ,big black eyes with moustach and a
bit of goaty he was dress in royal red like a cavalier and he had a necklace
with a pandent the face of Christ .So we went to live with my grannys for
a while becuase they were afraid,but soon we had to return home cause I
was ill and I wanted to go home .As soon as we retured home i started to
feel better and i went to play .The following months were raffy since dad
lost his job and mum used to find money under the mat in the cuboard and
some times even sweets and milk .Once I gave dad 3 numbers that this friend
of mine had gave me and he won some money from the lotto. Mum and dad tried
to have more children when we were living ther but they couldn't .Then
we&nbsp; got a bigger house and dad got a new job and it was time to leave.
A few days before my friend wanted to&nbsp; give me his chain and I said
no cause my mum always told me not to accept things from other people so
i was afraid altough I wished to .And so we left .people phoned us the
next morning to ask us if we left a dog or some thing in the flat,cause
they could not sleep with at night with the sounds of some one crying and
foot steps coming in the flat .All I know is that after we left a week
later a young man got in and the following morning they found him dead.
I was 2 at that time and we left our flat in vittoriosia in malta at 4
years ,then my mum had more children 4 infact . I am 20 now and I never
seen him since.Some times i have that strange feelingthat I am not alone
or that some one is there with me but i feel relaxed by the smell of jasmines
that surround the room .He was my first friend more then a ghost and i
will treausare that daysfor ever in my heart"</b>

<p><b>Mild but Ghostly</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Gemini61386@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I guess you could say that my experiences are quite mild compared
to others.</b>
<br><b>When I was about seven or eight I was having trouble sleeping and,
at that</b>
<br><b>time I kept my closet open at night, I looked through the slats
of my bunk</b>
<br><b>bed into my closet and saw a large golden glowing figure and a smaller</b>
<br><b>glowing figure. A few years before my dog had died, I loved him
very much.</b>
<br><b>And a few months earlier, my fish, I was very close with this fish-she
let me</b>
<br><b>pet her-, had died. My conculsion to this was that they were there
to help me</b>
<br><b>sleep. As soon as I saw them I went straight to sleep. My other
experience</b>
<br><b>was this year. I was home alone and I was picking something up out
of the</b>
<br><b>bottom of my closet and I heard a voice say "Bridget, I wouldn't
do that."</b>
<br><b>And I quit doing what I was doing and got up very quickly. As soon
as I got</b>
<br><b>up, something fell off the top shelf. It landed right where I was
kneeling.</b><b></b>

<br><b>I Can See Them</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: joethefed@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi there, my names Joe, my friend Colin probably wrote you recently
about</b>
<br><b>some recent activity.&nbsp; For the past I don't know how many years
I have been</b>
<br><b>able to feel and to an extent see ghosts.&nbsp; I can sense what
they are feeling</b>
<br><b>and what their intentions are.&nbsp; However, about three years,
my friend Colin</b>
<br><b>started having sleeping problems.&nbsp; I already knew his house
was haunted, but</b>
<br><b>what was haunting it was the spirit of what I think is a five year
old</b>
<br><b>child.&nbsp; For christmas the year before a friend of ours that
lived in</b>
<br><b>Thailand sent us all gifts, however Colin was the one that received
a house</b>
<br><b>that you would leave tokens and gifts in to help ward off evil spirits.</b>
<br><b>Over time it stopped doing that.&nbsp; Trapped in the house was
some kind of</b>
<br><b>creature, like a demon, it was huge, dark, and very menacing.&nbsp;
I still don't</b>
<br><b>know how to use all of my abilities very well, but at the time I
sure as</b>
<br><b>hell didn't, but I attempted this any way.&nbsp; We attempted to
destroy the</b>
<br><b>house and everything in it.&nbsp; It took 45 minutes just to get
it to catch</b>
<br><b>fire.&nbsp; During this 45 mintues I was attempting to immobilize
the creature</b>
<br><b>inside the house.&nbsp; After 45 minutes I was able to trap it,
by pure luck.</b>
<br><b>After I trapped it I was able to see what was being stored in the
house.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was a large field, fire everywhere, dead bodies on fire, blood everywhere.</b>
<br><b>It reminded me of what Hell would look like when described to you
as a</b>
<br><b>child.&nbsp; After that I was drained, I couldn't do much of anything,
I thought</b>
<br><b>I lost all my abilities, but after two months they started coming
back, very</b>
<br><b>slowly.&nbsp; I knew this only because I was able to sense the ghost
in Colins</b>
<br><b>house again.&nbsp; While I was living in Korea I encountered a few
spirits, but</b>
<br><b>they were by chance and left over from the war, that was when I
knew my</b>
<br><b>abilities were back to full, but I wanted to learn how to better
use them,</b>
<br><b>and I am not having any luck.&nbsp; Well to end the story on a bad
note, last</b>
<br><b>week my friend Jess asked about any ghost encounters any of us have
had, so</b>
<br><b>Colin and I talked about this one, so Jess got curious and wanted
to see</b>
<br><b>where it happen.&nbsp; Reluctantly we took him there.&nbsp; Surprisingly
enough,</b>
<br><b>development has been going on in the area for the last five years,
but at</b>
<br><b>the spot where we destroyed the house nothing is built.&nbsp; We
went to the spot</b>
<br><b>and I was able to feel it out from residue from when we first destroyed
it,</b>
<br><b>but after a few minutes it wasn't just that.&nbsp; The feeling I
was getting</b>
<br><b>became stronger until it made me sick, I almost passed out and I
double-over</b>
<br><b>dry heaving.&nbsp; It turns out it was still trapped there, until
that night,</b>
<br><b>somehow it got loose.&nbsp; I don't know how or why, but now I have
to get rid of</b>
<br><b>it for good, and I don't know how</b><b></b>

<br><b>Original Plantation Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: prtblonde@excite.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This happend about 8 years ago. My friend Debi and i were sitting
on my</b>
<br><b>front steps talking about a bunch of things including ghosts and
spirits. We</b>
<br><b>knew that the land we were on was full of ghosts. Just like all
of Madison.</b>
<br><b>There is alot of Historie here. This is the only town Sherman did
not burn</b>
<br><b>down during the civil war.You still find Original Plantation Houses</b>
<br><b>here.Anyway, that was pretty much what we were talking about at
the time.</b>
<br><b>When out of the blue we smelled a very strong Odor of a mans cologne.
It was</b>
<br><b>hot and there was no wind at all. We both felt someone standing
in front of</b>
<br><b>us. Since we both liked the cologne, we told "it" that he smelled
good but</b>
<br><b>he put way too much cologne on. It was too strong.So we asked if
he could</b>
<br><b>tone it down a little. Thats when the cologne smell turned into
a smell of</b>
<br><b>"Death" rotten flesh, bad eggs. I don't know how to explain that
smell. It</b>
<br><b>was BAD let me tell you! So, the women that we are, we changed our
mind</b>
<br><b>about the cologne very fast. We told him that we understand now
and to</b>
<br><b>please use the cologne again we would deal with it being so strong.
He</b>
<br><b>complied and used the cologne again. We thanked him and kept talking.
He</b>
<br><b>staied for a bit and then left.</b>
<br><b>There is so much Activity in this Town! The Spirits are everywhere.
No</b>
<br><b>matter where you go. There is one where i work. All he wants is
for someone</b>
<br><b>to know that he is there. He'll come and through something off of
a shelf</b>
<br><b>and as soon as I tell him that i know he is there, he'll stay around
to</b>
<br><b>watch me work.He does not talk to me even though i have asked him
who he is</b>
<br><b>and what he wants, does he need help with anything e.t.c. He just
wants to</b>
<br><b>be around someone. He doesn't want to be alone i don't think.</b>
<br><b>In the Next County in the woods, is a Plantation House. Noone lives
there</b>
<br><b>now. The House is falling apart. There is the spirit of a Slave
that used to</b>
<br><b>work and live on the plantation. He told us about how well he was
treated by</b>
<br><b>the master unlike the other slaves. He loves the land and the House.
He told</b>
<br><b>us that he was hung by the plantation owner because the daugter
of the</b>
<br><b>family had his child and to save her face, she said that he Raped
her. He</b>
<br><b>died and stayed behind to watch over her and his baby. He said that
he realy</b>
<br><b>loves her and the child. He likes for someone to just listen to
him tell his</b>
<br><b>storie. He invited us to come Back and listen to him tell his storie.
For</b>
<br><b>all of you out ther that think spirits are all about scarring you,
thats not</b>
<br><b>true. Most of them are very nice and just want to be and noticed.</b>
<br><b>Sorrie for useing so much space. Thanks for reading my stories.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Apartment Ghost Story...</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Sandee013@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>In 1989 I moved into a goverment apartment(# 7) in a small town containing</b>
<br><b>seven units. The last apartment was occupied by a single mom with
a small</b>
<br><b>child and her boyfriend. The previous year they (Man and woman)
were</b>
<br><b>murdered(shot to death) in thier bed in the first bedroom by the
woman's</b>
<br><b>estranged ex. No one wanted to move into the apartment because of
the history</b>
<br><b>surrounding the apartment. I was a young mother and had two children
and</b>
<br><b>needed a place to live and thought nothing of this. In time I was
told of the</b>
<br><b>strange happenings of the place and chalked it up to superstition
or small</b>
<br><b>minded people with too much time on thier hands. Things were pretty
quiet for</b>
<br><b>me and my little ones for the first few months, then small things
started to</b>
<br><b>occur. The light over the sink area in my kitchen would mysteriously
come on</b>
<br><b>in the middle of the night. Being the only adult in the house and
the only</b>
<br><b>person who could actually reach the switch, this had me worried
that I had an</b>
<br><b>electrical short or something and promptly had it checked</b>
<br><b>out.....nothing,perfectly normal. Kitchen cabinet doors would be
halfway open</b>
<br><b>in the mornings when I awoke, I scolded my oldest daughter(7 yrs.
at the</b>
<br><b>time) for climbing the counters and getting snacks out and she told
me that</b>
<br><b>she was asleep,she didn't do it. My youngest daughter (2 yrs. at
the time)</b>
<br><b>was starting to make a habit of getting up in the middle of the
nite and</b>
<br><b>getting into bed with me. Very unusual for her, she is a hard sleeper.
At one</b>
<br><b>point I was having trouble sleeping, so much to the point I went
to a doctor</b>
<br><b>and got sleeping medication, all to no avail. I always woke up at
3am and had</b>
<br><b>a difficult time going back to sleep. Nothing worked until I rearranged
my</b>
<br><b>bedroon furniture and moved my bed from one end of the room to the
other.</b>
<br><b>Once while my oldest daughter ws visiting her grandmother overnite,
myself</b>
<br><b>and my youngest daughter decided to take a bubble bath together
in the late</b>
<br><b>evening. While we were in the tub, I herd jingle bells rattling
around in a</b>
<br><b>cup on a shelf not five feet from me. All of my windows were closed
and no</b>
<br><b>one else was in the house, couldn't explain it at the time. After
three years</b>
<br><b>I chose to move in with&nbsp; a man to a better neighborhood . My
landlord chose</b>
<br><b>that time to tell me the complete history of "My" apartment.He showed
me the</b>
<br><b>newspaper articles on what happened and after reading all of them
I</b>
<br><b>understood all.....</b>
<br><b>The Ex climbed through the bathroom window and shot them both dead(At
three</b>
<br><b>am) and took the child which was sleeping between the two. Thier
bed was in</b>
<br><b>the exact postion as I had my bed when I couldn't sleep. The mom
was a stay</b>
<br><b>at home mom and was always in the kitchen fixing stuff for her little
child</b>
<br><b>(making homemade cookies, snacks and such). She always left the
kitchen sink</b>
<br><b>light on for her boyfriend when he came in late at nite. My daugher
always</b>
<br><b>getting into my bed late at nite was quickly understood by me. The
other</b>
<br><b>bedroom was never used by the child, she always slept with her mother
and the</b>
<br><b>boyfriend.No other tenants have reported any activity in this unit,of
coarse</b>
<br><b>they didn't have small or female children either. Time will tell
if this</b>
<br><b>ghost will ever find peace or her final rest.Before moving out (The
last nite</b>
<br><b>there) I made my peace with her and told her I understood why she
did the</b>
<br><b>things she did, I understood she wasn't trying to scare me or my
little girls</b>
<br><b>and I wished her peace .</b>

<p><b>Apparition in the Hallway</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: fboily@sympatico.ca</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>One afternoon of 1995 or 1996, I was dusting our bedroom (the master’s</b>
<br><b>bedroom) in our appartment.&nbsp; Right beside our bedroom was a
small</b>
<br><b>hallway leading up to the bathroom and to the other bedroom.&nbsp;
I remember</b>
<br><b>being in a very good mood.&nbsp; I had been doing a few changes
in the</b>
<br><b>decoration of the bedroom and was now dusting.&nbsp; I was happy
with the</b>
<br><b>results and as I was dusting I was talking about the changes with
my</b>
<br><b>husband or what I thought was my husband standing in the hallway.&nbsp;
All</b>
<br><b>smiling and happy I started to tell him, or what I thought was him,
&laquo;</b>
<br><b>Hey Franky ! Look at what I’ve just done?&nbsp; Isn’t that nice?!
&raquo;&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>advanced in the hallway to bring him in the bedroom and as I neared
him,</b>
<br><b>he disappeared!&nbsp; I nearly jumped!&nbsp; Now, as I was dusting,
I happened to</b>
<br><b>turn my head towards the hallway which was on my right and there
stood a</b>
<br><b>man who very much looked like my husband and who was dressed in
modern</b>
<br><b>clothes (a short and a t-shirt).&nbsp; When I saw him, I was sure
he was my</b>
<br><b>husband.&nbsp; That is when I started talking to him and as I was
cheerily</b>
<br><b>and happily explaining the changes to him, he had this most beautiful</b>
<br><b>smile of encouragement!&nbsp; He seemed to be happy for me.&nbsp;
What a surprise</b>
<br><b>when I realized that I had been speaking to someone or something
else</b>
<br><b>than my husband and when I saw it disappear!&nbsp; It is when this
being</b>
<br><b>disappeared that I realized that my husband was lying on the couch
and</b>
<br><b>watching TV!&nbsp; He was very surprised when I told him what happened.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Apparition in the Middle of the Night</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: fboily@sympatico.ca</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>One Saturday night (around 1995), my husband and I went to bed very</b>
<br><b>early.&nbsp; I was sound asleep when suddenly, around 2 A.M., I
was awakened</b>
<br><b>by the sound of crumpling paper.&nbsp; The sound was coming from
my left.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>turned my head, and there, beside the bed, on my side, was an</b>
<br><b>apparition!&nbsp; It had the appearance of a young man with short
brown hair</b>
<br><b>and was stripped to the waist!&nbsp; The lower portion of his &laquo;
body &raquo; was</b>
<br><b>transparent, ghost-like.&nbsp; It was also pretty tall, around 6
feet or so.</b>
<br><b>Now, on my side of the bed was the closet and a lamp.&nbsp; The
apparition</b>
<br><b>was standing in front of the lamp and sideways to myself.&nbsp;
His head was</b>
<br><b>bending over a little bit and yes, he was crumpling something with
his</b>
<br><b>hands.&nbsp; I remember thinking &laquo; Oh, this must be my husband,
what is he</b>
<br><b>doing there in the middle of the night? &raquo;&nbsp; To be sure,
I turned around</b>
<br><b>to see if he was really in bed and yes, he was sound asleep!&nbsp;
I remember</b>
<br><b>looking at my husband, then at this apparition, then again at my
husband</b>
<br><b>and again at this apparition.&nbsp; I wanted to be sure I wasn’t
dreaming or</b>
<br><b>seeing things.&nbsp; But no!&nbsp; It was real!&nbsp; I couldn’t
believe it!&nbsp; There</b>
<br><b>beside me was this being from another world, from another realm!&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>fully realized it, my heart started beating like crazy!&nbsp; I
really got</b>
<br><b>freaked out.&nbsp; I just leaned on the bed and stared at this apparition.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>was scared because this was the unknown, but I tell you, when I
think of</b>
<br><b>it now, it really was a peaceful being.&nbsp; I even think that
he probably</b>
<br><b>was an angel, or my guardian angel for that matter.&nbsp; Sometimes,
I</b>
<br><b>believe, that our guardian angels want us to see them.&nbsp; Yes,
in the</b>
<br><b>presence of this being I felt great peace.&nbsp; For a moment, during
the</b>
<br><b>experience, I thought &laquo; When is he going to leave? &raquo;.&nbsp;
Just when I</b>
<br><b>thought that, he disappeared!&nbsp; When he disappeared I began
sweating and</b>
<br><b>my heart was pounding so hard I thought it was going to jump right
out</b>
<br><b>of my body!&nbsp; I hid under the bed covers and eventually, but
with much</b>
<br><b>difficulty, fell asleep!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Attracted to Me</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jughead888@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stumbled onto your website. I just
want to say that out of my 41 yrs</b>
<br><b>of "life" I have been haunted since early childhood. Folks around
me notice</b>
<br><b>these things too - so its not just me. My experiences run the entire</b>
<br><b>spectrum&nbsp; - mostly poltergheist, some other... angelic, maybe
one demonic,</b>
<br><b>seen a few ghost - clearly - heard them at times - clearly - crying...</b>
<br><b>actually the only time I've heard them (thankully) was who I call
the crying</b>
<br><b>lady in an old Inn and others have heard her too. The sobbing was</b>
<br><b>tremendously sad and resonant broken between sobs with her voice
"Oh God</b>
<br><b>please nooooo... oh my god noooooo...." then more sobs. I have had
what I</b>
<br><b>call whistling gost - really odd stories... no question about any
of them</b>
<br><b>that they were real and something paranormal. Lately, very recently,
I have</b>
<br><b>been plagued by sudden very loud raps on the wall next to my head
as I sit</b>
<br><b>and write - usually very late at night. I thought it was kids out
late</b>
<br><b>tossing rocks against the wall but one cold rainy night a week ago
I decided</b>
<br><b>to test it and went up to the room to write - 2:30AM, raining hard
- almost</b>
<br><b>freezing out, definately no kids out - no trees near the wall either.
As</b>
<br><b>soon as I sat down - smiling to myself thinking it wasn't going
to happen -</b>
<br><b>Rap! hard on the wall next to my head. I don't come up to this room
to write</b>
<br><b>anymore after 9PM as I think it was somebody telling me to do other
things</b>
<br><b>with my time. Once I was at the PC late - I live alone - and behind
me I</b>
<br><b>heard a slap and a jingle and turned to see my heavy leather belt
swinging</b>
<br><b>around on the handle bar of my Nordic Trak where it had been all
day. I</b>
<br><b>could go on and on with stories&nbsp; - most more dramatic than
these little</b>
<br><b>attention getters. I wrote em all out in a book hoping to sell it
and I have</b>
<br><b>a total of 21 "major" stories - a few verifiable by other sources.
Once I</b>
<br><b>had a spirit tell a 5 yr old to give me a message in a certain room
we were</b>
<br><b>staying in as I was engaged to his ma. He said that the spirit man
came to</b>
<br><b>him with a message for me - that he (the ghost) came and went from
the room</b>
<br><b>and that I did not need to fear him because he was a "good" spirit.
He just</b>
<br><b>wanted me to know that, he wanted the boy to tell me that -&nbsp;
and he left. A</b>
<br><b>year later, the enagagment having flopped, I was out of a place
to stay and</b>
<br><b>the owner of the esate offered me a room at a great rate and I accepted
- it</b>
<br><b>was the same room. In that room I experienced quite a few paranormal
events</b>
<br><b>- levitation, poltergheist stuff. I found out that a certain fellow
had shot</b>
<br><b>himself in that room ten yrs back. Folks that knew him said he was
about the</b>
<br><b>nicest person you could hope to meet. So anyway...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what to make of all this -
a lifetime of it... I have</b>
<br><b>never sought or investigated any of it. I don't know. I am a Christian</b>
<br><b>myself and don't think it right to investigate too deeply and I
am also</b>
<br><b>afraid that by investigating I will attract it. I have heard other
folk's</b>
<br><b>ghost stories and generally believe em. But I have never heard of
anybody so</b>
<br><b>haunted as myself - no way. I think maybe something about me attracts...</b>
<br><b>don't know.&nbsp; That's all.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Australia Incident</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kyliwebb@lefevrehs.sa.edu.au</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in Australia and I have been seeing spirits ever since I was
about 2</b>
<br><b>years old. My first experience was just after my grandmothers death.
I was</b>
<br><b>visiting her grave for the first time and all of a sudden I started
hearing</b>
<br><b>voices. They were telling me to leave that it was dangerous for
them and me</b>
<br><b>if I stayed, that I had to run, and</b>
<br><b>never turn round. It is weird that I remember it, although my memory
is not</b>
<br><b>as clear as my mothers but I remember most of the details. I know
that this</b>
<br><b>is probably really hard to believe but I give you my word it is
true.</b>
<br><b>Although I think about it know and realize that I wasn't scared,
at the time I new that I had to leave so I told my mum and dad and we left.
My dad</b>
<br><b>didn't believe me, but my mum did. Since then I have had many experiences</b>
<br><b>with spirits all of which have been good except for one. This happened
when</b>
<br><b>I was 15. I had been roped into a swimming carnival, and I can't
swim to</b>
<br><b>good so I was practicing in my pool. The pool is down the very back
and you can't see the house from the pool as it is behind the shed. I have
often seen spirits down the back but it has never worried me . It was getting
late and I had been swimming for a while so stopped for a brake. Whilst
I was standing in the middle of the pool I seen a baby sitting on the fence
that surronds the pool, I tried to look away but I was in a trance. I finaly
stopped looking at it but it was good as I was suddenly dragged under the
water. I struggled for about 10 minutes befor it would let go. When it
finaly did I run inside. I told my mum and she never believed me but I
have never been down there on my own since.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Hello shadowlands,&nbsp; my story begins</b>
<br><b>when my daughter was 5 months old , I moved in with my mom with
my</b>
<br><b>daughter to Bakersfield calif. We lived in a large appartment complex,</b>
<br><b>my daughter and I where sleeping , she was in a portable crib across</b>
<br><b>the room and I was on the other side by the window, well my daughter</b>
<br><b>cried out, not a fussy I'm waking up cry but a cry, needless to
say as</b>
<br><b>a new mother, I was up and walking across the room like a shot and
in</b>
<br><b>my birthday suit so as I walking I noticed something out of the
corner</b>
<br><b>of my eye, I tried to look but, it would just stay out of sight.
I</b>
<br><b>looked at my baby and her eyes where wide open, I got a blanket
to</b>
<br><b>cover her up, then covered her and turned around to walk to my bed
when</b>
<br><b>I saw it again, just out of sight,&nbsp; I layed down in bed and
there was</b>
<br><b>this ghost staring at me from the ceilling!&nbsp; I noticed mainly
the eyes!</b>
<br><b>You could see the shape of it's&nbsp; head moving around looking.
I</b>
<br><b>pretended not to see it so I kept my eyes closed , then the sun
came up</b>
<br><b>through the window and lit up the room, I looked , of course I couldn't</b>
<br><b>see it I'm sure it blended in with the light and was still there,
so I</b>
<br><b>left. I figured that when my daughter cried out, and me shooting
across</b>
<br><b>the room, I must have startled it, my baby saw it thats why she
cried</b>
<br><b>out but anyway the spirit was looking at her and avoided me at all</b>
<br><b>cost! The way it behaved it acted like "your not supposed to me"
.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>daughter is 17 now, I've told her the story for many years, she's</b>
<br><b>attracted other spirits while growing up, not bad ones ,they just
seem</b>

<p><b>My name is Evan and my friends name is Scott.&nbsp; We were making
a trip to</b>
<br><b>North Carolina for a concert in August of 1996.&nbsp; After the
concert we</b>
<br><b>drove for a long while, finally making it to South Carolina, and
were in</b>
<br><b>need of a place to camp as it was getting pretty late.&nbsp; We
found the</b>
<br><b>Kings Mountain State park entrance, but being almost 2 A.M., the
gate</b>
<br><b>was locked.&nbsp; We both got out of the VW camper to see if we
could get the</b>
<br><b>gate open. The road was completely deserted, and being at the entrance,</b>
<br><b>we were not even close to any campsites.&nbsp; With the headlights
of the</b>
<br><b>camper as our only source of light, a woman appeared out of nowhere.</b>
<br><b>She had dark hair, a thin white dress, and was barefoot.&nbsp; She
asked us</b>
<br><b>if we were with the wedding party, and we replied that we were not.&nbsp;
As</b>
<br><b>quickly as she appeared, she was gone.&nbsp; Scott and I thought
it was kind</b>
<br><b>of weird...no evidence of another car on the road, and the fact
that she</b>
<br><b>was barefoot in the middle of nowhere at 2 in the morning.&nbsp;
Entertaining</b>
<br><b>the thought that we may have had an encounter with a ghost, we forgot</b>

<br><b>Recently I was reminded of the incident, and thought I'd surf the

found</b>

Mountain</b>
<br><b>State Park...and the woman in the white dress.&nbsp; The entry said
that she</b>
<br><b>was murdered by the Klan for marrying a black man.&nbsp; I wonder
if they</b>
<br><b>were married right before the murder, and that's why she asked us

<p><b>I am a firm believer in the afterlife, and I know that sometimes
the other</b>
<br><b>side reaches out to us in ways that we might not understand</b>
<br><b>This incident happened in the late evening around ten at night.
We , My</b>
<br><b>friend and I, were coming home from her mother's house.</b>
<br><b>She lives in a newly designated historic neighborhood in San Antonio,
Texas.</b>
<br><b>There are bunches of beautiful old houses that were built in the
early part</b>
<br><b>of the century. As we turned the corner of this one residential
street, my</b>
<br><b>headlight beams hit on something moving in the road about twenty
or thirty</b>
<br><b>yards ahead. Conversation was going on between us, and we kept talking.
As I</b>
<br><b>neared the object in the road I saw what appeared to be a transluscent,
neon</b>
<br><b>blue, crab, moving sideways across the road, and when the headlights
hit it,</b>
<br><b>it stopped and stood and waved its claws like it was dancing, doing
a sort</b>
<br><b>of Hula. Not beliving what i saw I kept driving until we drove past
it, by</b>
<br><b>this time it had reached the shoulder of the other side. The conversation</b>
<br><b>had stopped in the car. I looked at her ans she was looking at me
with a</b>
<br><b>funny stare. "Did you see something?" I asked&nbsp; "Yes, I think
I did", my</b>
<br><b>friend said.</b>
<br><b>She turned around and looked out the back window and I looked in
the rear</b>
<br><b>viewmirror and neither one of us could see anything that could have
been</b>
<br><b>what we saw. No bags in the wind, no trash, nothing. We wonder if

<br><b>some form of other worldly creature out trick or treating a few

<br><b>Childhood Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: parker.david@btinternet.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>The first time i ever experienced that i was not alone was during
my childhood.&nbsp; i was so scared to walk thorugh doors at night because
i use to see figures floating above them, it really freaked me out, but
that was only the start.</b>
<br><b>I remember many restless nights. I always keep my bedroom door open,
and from my bed i could see the upstairs landing. Before i saw anything,
i was felt a slight cold breeze, sweep past my face, and there she was.
A girl about 10 years old, around the same age i was at the time. She appeared
to be sitting on the landing crying. As I watched, a heard of horses ran
past her, almost over her, then she disappeared.</b>
<br><b>This resulted in me running to my sisters, or brothers’ room opposite.
As they looked out there was nothing there and I could not explain it.
This happened on a regular basis, but stopped around the age of 14.</b>
<br><b>I still can't explain it. even though we moved house a few years
ago, it still scares the hell out of me, what was it, a ghost or my imagination?</b>
<br><b>One thing i do know is that before the house we lived in was built,
it originaly was a field with horse's in.. The people who bought our house
have children, so it would be interesting to see if they have seen anything
like i have experience, so it can put my mind to rest.</b>

<p><b>Childhood Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nova_nation@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a story I have told to many people. It's of an experience
I had when</b>
<br><b>I was about 5, and none of the details have ever changed.</b>
<br><b>It was 14 years ago, when I was 5, my family (mom, dad, 3 yr old
brother)</b>
<br><b>lived in our tiny old house. My brother and I were forced to share
a room, a</b>
<br><b>small one, and our beds were directly across from each other. I
woke up one</b>
<br><b>night, it had to be late because our parents were already asleep,
and there</b>
<br><b>was a woman standing over me. She put her finger to her mouth and
told me to</b>
<br><b>be quiet, that her and the man would be right back, they were going
to go</b>
<br><b>eat first. When she said that I looked across to my brother's bed
to see a</b>
<br><b>short, bald man over him. I didn't see them as transparent, and
I didn't see</b>
<br><b>them fade away, but they disappeared, and as soon as they did I
was in bed,</b>
<br><b>across the hall, with my parents. A few minutes later I heard my
brother</b>
<br><b>start crying. My dad went into our room and carried him into his
and my</b>
<br><b>mother's room, laying him on the bed to sleep. The only thing I
can figure</b>
<br><b>is that the man and woman did come back. I remember that night perfectly,</b>
<br><b>and I know it wasn't a dream I've been remembering, I have plenty
of dreams</b>
<br><b>that I remember in detail, and I know what are and are not dreams.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Long Time Haunt</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: BrandyMarie@att.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Hi.&nbsp; Just wanted to add my story to the list.&nbsp; I
live in Oberlin PA.&nbsp; It's a small town outside of Harrisburg.&nbsp;
My house is a duplex that was built in the early 1900's.</b>
<br><b>I started noticing strange occurrences at an early age.&nbsp; The
first experience was when I was about 6.&nbsp; I was laying in my bed and
I heard footsteps in the attic.&nbsp; At the time my dad was in the shower,
my mom was down stairs reading and my brother was not home.&nbsp; The second
was probably a year or so later.&nbsp; I was in my bed and I happened to
glance over at my closet and what I saw was simply unbelievable.&nbsp;
There was this thing (I don't know what to call it) walking back and forth
in front of my closet.&nbsp; It was about 6' tall and very ugly.&nbsp;
It's head/face reminded me of the alien on that show Alf (does anyone remember
what he looked like?) except the thing's face was longer and skinnier.&nbsp;
Of course being a kid I covered my head with my blanket and tried not to
think about it.&nbsp; Nothing happened then for years.</b>
<br><b>Approximately 3 years ago they started again.&nbsp; Mostly just
small things like seeing something move out of the corner of your eye.&nbsp;
Right behind the chair that I'm sitting in right now I sometimes hear a
bird fly past me.&nbsp; I was sitting here one night and my chair started
rolling toward my kitchen like someone was pushing me.</b>
<br><b>The scariest for me was 2 summers ago.&nbsp; I was home alone for
the weekend and I just got in bed and was starting to fall asleep when
someone ran up my steps.&nbsp; It scared me because like I said I was home
alone and I didn't hear anyone come in my house.&nbsp; So with a baseball
bat and a bottle of hairspray I ventured out into the hall.&nbsp; No one
was in the house but me.&nbsp; Trying to be logical about this I thought
one of my cats did it.&nbsp; One was outside and the other 2 were sleeping
downstairs and besides that neither one of them sounds like a person when
they run up the stairs.&nbsp; Well I put it out of my mind and went to
sleep.&nbsp; The next night the same thing happened.&nbsp; Around the same
time both nights (11:30).&nbsp; This time I told 'it' to stop and I went
to sleep (it never happened again).</b>
<br><b>I always heard that animals have the gift of the 6th sense.&nbsp;
My youngest cat is one of them.&nbsp; Hannah will be sleeping comfortably
on the couch then all of a sudden jump up like someone hit her and run
up the stairs.&nbsp; She also stares at the steps like she's watching someone
(she stares at me the same way sometimes).</b>
<br><b>I talked to a friend of a friend about this.&nbsp; He claimed to
be psychic.&nbsp; I wasn't sure if I believed him or not but thought I
would give it a try.&nbsp; He told me a lot about myself that not many
people know about me (this was the first time I met him).&nbsp; I asked
him if he could tell me anything about my house.&nbsp; He told me that
something did happen here but it was not his place to tell me.&nbsp; He
did tell me that there is a little boy or a younger man in my house.&nbsp;
He is not a threat he's just not sure what's going on.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;So if anyone out there has ANY info about anything that happened
in Oberlin PA please e-mail me at:&nbsp; BrandyMarie@att.net. To all of
you that have had experiences you have been given an extraordinary gift.&nbsp;
Don't ever let anyone tell you that your crazy or stupid.&nbsp; I have
had many experiences in and out of my house (too many to tell you about).</b>

<br><b>Summer-time lights</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: T3ebush@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I was hanging out with two of my friends during the summer with
nothing much</b>
<br><b>to do.&nbsp; I suggested that maybe we should take a look.&nbsp;
At the time we left,</b>
<br><b>the sun was beginning to set.&nbsp; We were talking about some random
thing, when</b>
<br><b>I saw three lights floating through the air.&nbsp; They seemed to
hover in the</b>
<br><b>air, but suddenly came right in front of my face.&nbsp; I fell down
&amp; my friends</b>
<br><b>laughed, not noticing the three lights.&nbsp; They started to vibrate
and then</b>
<br><b>flew away quickly.&nbsp; They went about 5 yards away &amp; disappeared.&nbsp;
My friends</b>
<br><b>told me that we were talking about our favorite performer &amp;
I had fallen down</b>
<br><b>right when one of them told me who their's was.&nbsp; They had thought
my falling</b>
<br><b>was a joke about that performer.&nbsp; When I had told them about
the lights, they</b>
<br><b>thought I had tripped and was just trying to play it off.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I thought maybe I</b>
<br><b>had been daydreaming, so I just shrugged it off.&nbsp; That night,
I was going to</b>
<br><b>bed &amp; I heard a woman laughing.&nbsp; My mom was away from the
house at the time &amp;</b>
<br><b>I have no sisters, so I immediately thought of the lights.&nbsp;
I'm not sure if</b>
<br><b>that was paranormal activity or not, but it had kept me awake for
the next</b>
<br><b>few nights.&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't had any other experiences since.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Serial Murder</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ellison@edatcat.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a true account of events that took place when I was a teenager
in</b>
<br><b>the late 80's in&nbsp; TN.</b>
<br><b>My parents and I lived in a nice suburban home nextdoor to a newlywed</b>
<br><b>couple.&nbsp; The wife, Amy, was exceptionally kind and very athletic.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>husband, Tony, was somewhat effeminate and slightly eccentric. The
two had</b>
<br><b>children from Amy's pevious marriage.&nbsp; The girls were under
age 5.&nbsp; The pair</b>
<br><b>owned a small Italian restaurant at the entrance of the subdivision.&nbsp;
Our</b>
<br><b>two families developed a typical neighborly relationship.</b>
<br><b>On her way home from work one day, Amy's car developed sudden trouble,</b>
<br><b>exploded, and flew off of the interstate.&nbsp; She survived and
the incident was</b>
<br><b>dismissed as a fluke accident.&nbsp; However, a few weeks later,
the same thing</b>
<br><b>happened again.&nbsp; Miraculously, she survived a second time.&nbsp;
The second</b>
<br><b>incident was reported to the vehicle manufacturer.&nbsp; I'm not
sure what become</b>
<br><b>of that.</b>
<br><b>About a year later, in mid-summer, the telephone woke me up one
morning.&nbsp; In</b>
<br><b>a groggy voice, I answered.&nbsp; It was Tony.&nbsp; He tearily
explained that Amy had</b>
<br><b>died and he wished to inform my parents.&nbsp; Still half asleep,
I said "ok,</b>
<br><b>thanks, I'll tell them" and hung up the phone, not grasping the
reality of</b>
<br><b>what he'd just said.</b>
<br><b>As it turns out, Amy had drowned in the bathtub the previous evening.&nbsp;
Her</b>
<br><b>death was ruled an accident, we thought, but a detective hung around
the</b>
<br><b>house nextdoor for months to come.&nbsp; Eventually, Tony married
a woman from</b>
<br><b>across the street, named Kathy Beadle, whose husband had recently
died in a</b>
<br><b>plane crash (he was a pilot).&nbsp; The two moved to Knoxville,
TN.</b>
<br><b>Not long after, a new couple bought Tony and Amy's old house.&nbsp;
They planned</b>
<br><b>some renovations before they moved completely in, and had carpenter
teams in</b>
<br><b>the house regularly.&nbsp; One evening, the woman knocked on our
door.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>explained that the carpenters refused to come back to the house
to work.</b>
<br><b>Myserious events had occured, she said.&nbsp; "The water in the
upstairs bathroom</b>
<br><b>comes on unexpectedly....when we turn it off, it comes back on as
soon as we</b>
<br><b>leave the room."&nbsp; She also recounted things being fixed...such
as cabinet</b>
<br><b>doors, scratches on the walls being repaired, and other small things
around</b>
<br><b>the house.&nbsp; She was afraid to stay in the house alone.</b>
<br><b>"What happened in this house?"&nbsp; she wanted to know.</b>
<br><b>My parents explained.&nbsp; The woman was aghast.&nbsp; My father
wanted to help, so</b>
<br><b>he went nextdoor, and stepped inside the house.&nbsp; He made his
way around the</b>
<br><b>house, talking to Amy....yes talking to Amy...or her ghost, rather.&nbsp;
he told</b>
<br><b>her that her children were fine and that all was well...that she
could move</b>
<br><b>on and be at peace.</b>
<br><b>Strangely enough, the mysterious incidents in the house never happened
after</b>
<br><b>that.&nbsp; However, it turns out that a year later, Kathy (the
woman Tony</b>
<br><b>married) came up missing.&nbsp; A manhunt began and we were surprised
to learn on</b>
<br><b>CNN that Tony Vic was wanted by the FBI as a suspected serial killer.</b>
<br><b>Kathy's body was discovered buried under 6 feet of concerete in
the couple's</b>
<br><b>Knoxville backyard, beneath their swimming pool....K-9's discovered
her</b>
<br><b>remains.&nbsp; Tony was apprehended in New Jersey living with another
man and was</b>
<br><b>placed behind bars where he belongs...he was eventually convicted
of, not</b>
<br><b>only Kathy's murder, but for murdering Amy by drowning her in the
bathtub,</b>
<br><b>and for the murders of 3 previous wives and a mother-in-law...he
convinced</b>
<br><b>one woman and her mother that god wanted them to throw themselves
in front</b>
<br><b>of an oncoming truck...incredibly, they oblidged.</b>
<br><b>Amy's untimely death caused her to be restless in the afterlife...she
was</b>
<br><b>not ready to go.&nbsp; My father convinced her that it was ok.&nbsp;
Sometimes, I</b>
<br><b>guess even the dead need reassurance.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Own Experience</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: malcolmturley@worldnet.att.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>At the age of 8, my family moved me to the middle east. A small place
called Doha, Qutar. Before we could move into my house there, my family
&amp; I had to stay in a large hotel for about a month. The hallway outside
our door smelled like rotted eggs, and our "room" had enough beds-each
in different compartments- for me and my brother to sleep by our selves
leaving my mom &amp; dad to also have their own room. I suffered from a
major case of jet lag. It was worse than any member in my family. At night,
I would just lay in bed, staring at the ceiling.</b>
<br><b>My room had always given me a chill down my spine. But one night,
I was trying to sleep and a small hand grabbed mine under the covers. I
pulled away, and looked over to that side of the bed. There was the face
of a little Arab boy peeking his head over the side of the bed. He looked
frightened. I screamed and ran to my mom's room. She said it was nothing
and told me to go back to bed. When I got there, he was gone.</b>
<br><b>The next night, I sat up in bed staring at the wall near the door.
The light was off, and my door was closed. I blinked, and when I opened
my eyes again, there was a different little boy in colorful overalls running
towards my bed. He looked even more scared then the boy from the night
before. I couldn't move, I was so shocked. He disappears behind the foot
board, and appeared right in front of me standing up. He reached out and
started shaking me viscously. I still couldn't move to get away, and just
stared at the kid. He looked about 3.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly he turned around and screamed, covering his face. The only
way I could explain what happened next is as if something came sideways
through him and he turned to mist from the middle out. It scared me so
much that I screamed bloody murder, and fell off the bed onto the floor.
Coincidentally, the air conditioning came on right then, so my mom could
explain it as just that. I tried to explain, but she cut me off.</b>
<br><b>Two years later, I completed 4th grade, and my mom took me back
to America. She had separated from my dad, and my brother had already left
for home about a month before. And since then, I've been trying to figure
out what had happened to those boys...</b><b></b>

<p><b>When my wife and I first got married, we lived in a very old house
that her</b>

the same family</b>
<br><b>until it and the surrounding land was sold in 1996.&nbsp; The house
was so huge</b>
<br><b>that a family lived on the first floor and we lived on the second

<br><b>There was a slave cell in the basement and there were still chains

<p><b>The Family Demon</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: gungsa@usit.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;This happened to me when I was twelve years old.&nbsp; As
you will read, however, the experience had a type of repeat years later.&nbsp;
I was glad to read that you discriminate between ''ghosts'' and ''demons''
otherwise, I would not be writing you.&nbsp; My encounter was with a demon.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My father was an alcoholic.&nbsp; He was a steel worker who
worked hard and drove far to work each day.&nbsp; We didn't see him but
a little while each evening.&nbsp; During the work week he was sober.&nbsp;
On the weekends, however, he stayed drunk and that's when my brother and
I suffered his violence and brutality.&nbsp; It seems that his violence
increased the last few years he was alive.&nbsp; In 1952 he was killed
in a car accident.&nbsp; Sad to say, the news was met with relief on my
part.&nbsp; The day of the funeral is when I had my encounter.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;We walked home from the church that day and climbed the steps
to our apartment above the laundry.&nbsp; The Catholic Church we had the
funeral in was very beautiful.&nbsp; As a young Catholic, I was always
"in love" with the beautiful saints and statues of Mary and Joseph, but
the statues of Jesus were my favorite.&nbsp; The face so gentle and full
of love that I carried it active in my mind during the bad times.&nbsp;
I don't remember the funeral.&nbsp; I don't remember sermons graphically
describing Satan.&nbsp; So it wasn't a thought I carried with me that day
after the funeral.&nbsp; I was a kid, anyway.&nbsp; No pain stays too long....only
the damage done by those who we were supposed to be able to trust and honor.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I walked through the front room on my way to my bedroom.&nbsp;
I was frozen in my tracks in the hall.&nbsp; I don't know what stopped
me.&nbsp; My blood seemed to drop to my feet and I was cold.&nbsp; I looked
up and there, floating in the darkened corner of the hall was an apparition
of my father's face.&nbsp; It wavered there as though I was seeing it though
rippling air.&nbsp; But this face, with it's greenish cast and malevolence,
was looking at me with such hatred that I remember thinking that if it
had a full body it would be trying to strangle me!&nbsp;&nbsp; The moment
ended in about 30 seconds.&nbsp; Suddenly, all was as it was before.&nbsp;
I "went on my way" as though nothing had happened.&nbsp; It was totally
gone from my memory.&nbsp; I didn't run screaming to my mother about the
experiece.&nbsp; I didn't tell my friends.&nbsp; I had forgotten it completely.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;In 1976, after the death of my wonderful husband, I moved
in with my eldest brother and his family for a short time.&nbsp; It was
great for all of us.&nbsp; My brother was my favorite.&nbsp; He'd been
through those years of violence with me.&nbsp; We'd always comforted each
other during those times and&nbsp; remained close through to adulthood.&nbsp;
My two children and their three cousins were good friends and my sister-in-law
was a true sister and friend.&nbsp; But my brother was also a heavy weekend
drinker.&nbsp; So living there meant my sister-in-law and I lent support
to each other during those days.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;As I arrived from work one day, my brother was coming down
the sidewalk from the house.&nbsp; I looked at him as I approached and
was, once again, frozen in my steps.&nbsp; He came toward me and I thought
how much he looked like my father.&nbsp; Then I saw that same malevolence
staring back at me!&nbsp; He passed without saying a word.&nbsp; Like before,
I was freed from my motionlessness and went on into the house.&nbsp; As
before, the moment passed into oblivion.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;During a recent conversation witrh my mother I was relating
the stories that until that moment I'd not recalled (suddenly I remembered
them, like someone freed from amnesia).&nbsp; Details returned and with
them realizations.&nbsp; My brother looks nothing like my father.&nbsp;
The face that I saw on my brother that day was not his face...but the very
same spirit face I had seen the day of my father's funeral!&nbsp; That
point alone was enough for me to know that while I had somehow escaped
it's influence that day, my brother had not.&nbsp; I can only imagine that
even at the tender age of 10, he was captured by that spirit that no longer
had power over my father.&nbsp; In retrospect, I can see it's influence
in my brother's life.</b>
<br><b>I've read that demons take control during moments in any person's
life where they are at a morally weak&nbsp; moment, ie, inebriated, to
mention one.&nbsp; The longer a person stays in that state the more "demons"
can enter.&nbsp; It is evident in the memories I have of my father and
now, of my brother.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;For me, the connections came many years later.&nbsp; I would
not have believed it if it hadn't happened to me.&nbsp; And the way it
happened...over so many years to have unfolded so slowly...to have come
to the full horrible realization of the ''haunting'' of my father, then
my brother.&nbsp; To the full realization of what I escaped...somehow...
and it makes me thank God!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The week that this all came together I found that I couldn't
get my precious niece out of my mind.&nbsp; Waking, dreaming...all filled
with thoughts of her.&nbsp; For some reason I can't explain, and not knowing
her situation-of-the-moment, I wrote her.&nbsp; For some reason I can't
explain, I decided to tell her that story.&nbsp; The next morning she called
me to tell me that she'd been having a battle with alcohol for years and
that this week had been especially hard for her.&nbsp; She'd quit drinking
a long time ago but still had days when the battle not to drink was almost
more than she could handle alone.&nbsp; Knowing the story of "the family
demon" gave her an additional tool....knowledge; an appreciation of what
she was in fact&nbsp; fighting against!&nbsp; With that she was given an
added incentive for overcoming her "demon", which she recognized as being
a reality.</b>
<br><b>There are prayers, or mantras, if you will, that can assist one
in being freed of such influences.&nbsp; While I know that some of your
readers are looking for the thrill of reading a good "ghost story"&nbsp;
others are looking for help.&nbsp; It's with that in mind that I include
the prayer.&nbsp; It can be called a prayer, a blessing, a mantra, or even
an exorcism.&nbsp; But we are all a part of the Spirit that created us
and as such we too, have the power of God's Spirit to bless.&nbsp; As Jesus
told Peter, "What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and what you
loose on earth will be loosed in heaven" Matt. 16:19</b>
<br><b>And so, for what it's worth, this is the prayer:</b>
<br><b>"I give my higher self permission to accept the help of my angels
and I call twelve archangels to assist me.&nbsp; We do not accept the spirits
of darkness and opposition to God's light to remain.&nbsp; You dark spirits,
with your harmful intent, must leave now.&nbsp; You will go to the light.&nbsp;
You will go away from me.&nbsp; I command it with the power of God and
in the Name of God, the Creator.&nbsp; You are banished from me forever.&nbsp;
The light of God is around me and within me there are no dark corners.&nbsp;
My higher self is henceforth in company of the angels of God.&nbsp; I am
protected by the light of God.&nbsp; It is done.&nbsp; In Jesus' name,
so be it.&nbsp; Amen"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;That's it, Dave.&nbsp; I wouldn't have written this to you
if I couldn't include the prayer.&nbsp; It's a true experience and the
help that came from that prayer is undeniable.&nbsp; We don't need a church
exorcist, with all their accoutrements, to free ourselves from a malignant
spirit...that prayer (and words to that effect ) are all that are needed.&nbsp;
I know that there are many who are seriously trouble by such manifestations
and this could help.&nbsp; If one wanted to help an alcoholic it would
have to be done while he/she was completely sober.&nbsp; The afflicted
person must say the words.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Haunting at TRW</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: whitphoto@sdccu.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Dave:&nbsp; My story happened in the photo lab at TRW in Redondo
Beach.&nbsp; I was the day shift supervisor and Louis Blackman (Blackie)
was my group leader.&nbsp; He had an old pick-up with running boards.&nbsp;
I had my foot on the board while we talked the last night of his life.&nbsp;
We were talking about all the things we had not done in our lives that
we wished we had.&nbsp; I remember that he wanted to visit Catalina.</b>
<br><b>Blackie was always second to arrive for work after me because he
loved the coffee I made.&nbsp; He did not show the next morning.&nbsp;
I kept looking for him to come through the door but he never did.</b>
<br><b>I got a phone call from someone asking which department to call
for death benefits.&nbsp; I found out that Blackie had been killed on the
405 freeway on his way home.</b>
<br><b>Blackie continued to come to work, I don't think he realized that
he was dead.&nbsp; I could not get anyone to work his photo lab dark room.&nbsp;
I had one man who came running out of the lab screaming, "I'm never going
back in there.&nbsp; There's someone in there".&nbsp; Things were being
moved and it was extremely chilly in that room.&nbsp; I tried to do the
jobs that were backing up in the room but kept seeing shadows out of the
corner of my eye.</b>
<br><b>I don't know where I got the idea but I had everyone on my shift
go with me into the room one morning and I said out loud, "Blackie you're
dead, leave us alone".&nbsp; The room immediately warmed up and every thing
went back to normal.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghost in Exton, PA</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dimotta@gate.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>About 28 years ago, I made a sales call on a family that lived on
RT 100</b>
<br><b>near Exton, PA. They lived in a clapboard house on the west side
of the</b>
<br><b>road just south of a high overpass.</b>
<br><b>It was a Sunday afternoon and my appointment was with an</b>
<br><b>African-American couple to discuss their investments.&nbsp; I arrived
early</b>
<br><b>and they were finishing Sunday dinner so the lady showed me to a
sitting</b>
<br><b>room off the kitchen. As I headed towards the room, a little black
boy</b>
<br><b>about 6 yrs. old peeked out of the room smiling and then ducked
back</b>
<br><b>inside.&nbsp; I went into the room and expected to see him there
but he must</b>
<br><b>have been hiding.</b>
<br><b>The family finished dinner and were carrying their plates back to
the</b>
<br><b>kitchen.&nbsp; The lady looked toward me and saw me looking behind
the couch.</b>
<br><b>She came into the room and asked me what was I doing. I explained
that I</b>
<br><b>was looking for the little boy that I saw duck into the room.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>screamed and her husband and older sons ran into the room.&nbsp;
They wanted</b>
<br><b>to know what happened and she screamed, " He saw him! He's here!"
I was</b>
<br><b>totally lost. The men ran outside the house and one yelled "There
he</b>
<br><b>goes!"&nbsp; I looked behind all the furniture and no one was in
the room. I</b>
<br><b>checked the only window and it was locked from the inside!</b>
<br><b>All the members of the family finally returned to the room that
I was in</b>
<br><b>and began to fire questions about the boy. I asked what was the
big</b>
<br><b>commotion about.&nbsp; They said they saw the boy run from the window
toward</b>
<br><b>the hedge along the highway. The father and the sons stood on either</b>
<br><b>side of the hedge and searched it. There was no little boy anywhere!
I</b>
<br><b>still didn't get it.</b>
<br><b>Finally the woman told me the story of the little boy who used to
live</b>
<br><b>there and had been sent to that room by his parents. He had slipped
out</b>
<br><b>the window and ran to the hedge and apparently fell through it into
the</b>
<br><b>path of an oncoming truck and was killed!&nbsp; Right, I thought!!!
I know I</b>
<br><b>saw a little boy and there's no such thing as ghosts.</b>
<br><b>On Monday when I returned to the office I told the story to some
of my</b>
<br><b>co-workers. They all laughed.&nbsp; 3 months later, the Philadelphia
Inquirer</b>
<br><b>ran a story on a Sunday about strange happenings.&nbsp; Guess what?!?!?&nbsp;

<p><b>I'm in my late 40ies, Greek, living in Greece and I must state from

<p><b>My Unexplained Experience</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Dear Dave:&nbsp; This experience happened some thirty years ago,
and to this day I</b>
<br><b>cannot explain how or why I am still here to speak about it.</b>
<br><b>Back in 1970 I was in College to get my nursing degree.&nbsp; The
college was 50</b>
<br><b>miles from my home, so&nbsp; I had to commute every day on a very
busy four lane</b>
<br><b>highway.&nbsp; My children were still in school then, so when I
finished with</b>
<br><b>classes or at the hospital I generally was in&nbsp; anxious to get
home, as there</b>
<br><b>was no one there to supervise them when they got home from school.</b>
<br><b>One day on my return, driving my father's big Ambassorador, which
I inherited</b>
<br><b>after his is recent death,&nbsp; I was in the passing lane&nbsp;
and approaching an</b>
<br><b>intersection, when a car drove accross the road and stopped paralle
in my</b>
<br><b>lane as the medium already had a car waiting to cross into the south
bound</b>
<br><b>land, there was a car beside me and suddenly I knew I was going
to crash into</b>
<br><b>this car in front of me.&nbsp; I hit the brakes, then I noticed
the hands on the</b>
<br><b>wheel, they looked like my Fathers hands,&nbsp; the next thing I
remember after</b>
<br><b>that is the car jumping over a curb, and I was sitting in the meduim
beyond</b>
<br><b>the intersection,&nbsp; I was dazed and the car was still running,
and I don't</b>
<br><b>remember getting there,in fact I do not remember anything else except
seeing</b>
<br><b>my father"s hands,&nbsp; I last real vision was that car I was going
to crash into</b>
<br><b>directly in from of me.&nbsp;&nbsp; To this day I do not know how
I missed it and how I</b>
<br><b>got into that medium alive.</b>
<br><b>My husband worked only two miles beyond where this happened, and
I drove</b>
<br><b>there to relate this experience and to see what damage occured to
my car.</b>
<br><b>The only thing we found was&nbsp; a scrape on the gas tank as I
went over the</b>
<br><b>curb.&nbsp; Nothing else, there was not a scratch on the car anywhere.</b>
<br><b>To this day, I wonder what happened, and still have no explaination.&nbsp;
But I</b>
<br><b>am grateful that I am here to relate this experience.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghostly Delivery</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Samnpatti2@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My son was 17 years of age. He delivered the Sunday paper. It was
around</b>
<br><b>4:30a.m., he was loading his papers in the car. He said he felt
something go</b>
<br><b>thru him. It scared him very much. After that he would speak a foreign</b>
<br><b>language in his sleep. When he went to college his roommate pulled
me aside</b>
<br><b>and told me about talking in his sleep, and how strange it was.
I said "yes I</b>
<br><b>know about this." My son is 31 years old now, and it is still difficult
for</b>
<br><b>him to speak about this incident. I never said this to my son, but
I felt a</b>

<br><b>Ghost of a Little Girl</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Lori.Delor@VPUADV.uab.edu</b><b></b>
<p><b>Maybe this isn't so much a ghost story and simply a truly frightening
and</b>
<br><b>tragic human experience. However, human tragedy seems to be the
impetus for</b>
<br><b>some ghosts and the spirit of the young girl at the center of this
story has</b>
<br><b>been seen and felt by several people over the years.</b>
<br><b>I have not seen the ghost myself, but my mother claims to have felt
her</b>
<br><b>presence and had strange experiences in the house where the little
girl</b>
<br><b>died. She was the only child of our neighbors in the late 70s in
a suburban</b>
<br><b>area outside of Athens, Ohio. At the time of her death, she was
only four</b>
<br><b>years old. Still, at that tender age she was considered a prodigy.
She</b>
<br><b>learned to read and write well past the kindergarten level before
she was</b>
<br><b>old enough to go to school. In fact, all of her milestones, walking,</b>
<br><b>talking, motor skills, occurred much earlier than any of her peers.
She also</b>
<br><b>showed an uncanny ability to reason and contemplate abstract metaphysical</b>
<br><b>issues. In addition to being highly intelligent, some in the neighborhood</b>
<br><b>remarked that she seemed melancholy most of the time, as if she
were</b>
<br><b>burdened by the weight of the world.</b>
<br><b>Late one evening, after 11 p.m., her frantic mother pounded on our
door in</b>
<br><b>her nightgown as her husband desperately tried to pry open or break
his</b>
<br><b>daughter's bedroom window. Flames and smoke coming from the bedroom
could be</b>
<br><b>seen from the yard. I remember the scene quite well although all
was chaos.</b>
<br><b>The mother was sobbing uncontrollably, the father was shouting and
trying</b>
<br><b>everything to gain access to the small bedroom from the outside.
I could</b>
<br><b>hear sirens from the distance as my mother ushered me back to my
bedroom. I</b>
<br><b>protested at first, wanting to be in the middle of all of the excitement,</b>
<br><b>but now I am glad my mother prevented me from seeing the firemen
bring out</b>
<br><b>the tiny body of the neighbor girl. I'm glad I was not able to witness
the</b>
<br><b>anguish of her parents as they realized she could not be saved.</b>
<br><b>That incident is tragic enough, but it was actually the cause of
death that</b>
<br><b>some people think brought on the haunting. The neighbors went to
stay with</b>
<br><b>nearby relatives while the house was being repaired from the fire
damage</b>
<br><b>which seem to be confined to that one corner of the house. My mother
went to</b>
<br><b>comfort them often and helped make funeral arrangements. Just before
the</b>
<br><b>funeral, the girl's mother confided that the authorities seemed
to think the</b>
<br><b>child's death was a suicide.</b>
<br><b>A four year old committing suicide? Unbelievable! However, as the
neighbors</b>
<br><b>began to put together the pieces, suicide became not only believable,
but</b>
<br><b>highly likely. From evidence found at the scene, everyone agreed
on what</b>
<br><b>took place that night.</b>
<br><b>It seems that the little girl was put to bed at her normal time,
but stayed</b>
<br><b>awake until she was sure her parents had gone to sleep. Then, she
crept very</b>
<br><b>quietly from her room to the kitchen where she pushed a chair against
the</b>
<br><b>countertop and climbed up to retrieve the fireplace matches from
the top of</b>
<br><b>the refrigerator. She put the chair back in it's proper place and
went into</b>
<br><b>the den where her father kept newspapers and magazines in a rack.
Ignoring</b>
<br><b>the magazines, she gathered up as many newspaper pages as she could
carry</b>
<br><b>and quietly returned to her room. She locked the door, which usually</b>
<br><b>remained slightly open, and pulled the window shades closed. She
tried to</b>
<br><b>pull the mattress off of her bed. Not being strong enough to move
it to the</b>
<br><b>floor, she settled for the mattress hanging halfway off of the bed.
On the</b>
<br><b>part of the mattress on the floor she built a small bonfire with
the</b>
<br><b>newspapers. Finally, she moved to a corner of the room, clutching
her</b>
<br><b>favorite stuffed toy, and waited for the fire to catch.</b>
<br><b>When the smoke alarm awoke the parents, they immediately tried to
enter her</b>
<br><b>room, unaware that it was the source of the smoke in the hallway.
When they</b>
<br><b>couldn't get past the locked door and the child didn't respond to
their</b>
<br><b>calls, the father ran outside to the bedroom window while the wife
ran to</b>
<br><b>our house. The fire was relatively small and contained, but the
smoke was</b>
<br><b>thick enough to suffocate the girl.</b>
<br><b>If it wasn't suicide, only a child playing with matches, then why
did the</b>
<br><b>girl seem to have reasoned out how to start a fire without being
caught, how</b>
<br><b>to use kindling to build a bigger and more deadly fire, and how
to prevent</b>
<br><b>her parents from rescuing her? Some people in the neighborhood speculated</b>
<br><b>that the girls was simply too smart for her own good. Some believed
that she</b>
<br><b>had an incredible capacity to ponder the human condition, life and
death,</b>
<br><b>pain and suffering, and was just too burdened by the universal answers
we</b>
<br><b>all seek that she could bear it no longer. Imagine how frustrating
it must</b>
<br><b>be to comprehend an eternal truth and yet be powerless to communicate
it to</b>
<br><b>the world as such a small child.</b>
<br><b>A while later the couple settled back into their home and continued
to</b>
<br><b>grieve. My mother stopped by three or four times a week to comfort
them, as</b>
<br><b>did other neighbors and friends. The people who visited in those
months all</b>
<br><b>reported feeling chills, strange sensations, and a feeling of sadness
that</b>
<br><b>was more profound in the house than elsewhere. The experiences usually</b>
<br><b>occurred in the kitchen, where the little girl set the events of
that night</b>
<br><b>in motion with the fireplace matches on top of the refrigerator.
A few</b>
<br><b>people claimed to have seen movement or an image out of the corner
of their</b>
<br><b>eyes that didn't exist when they turned their head to look. The
parents</b>
<br><b>never seemed to notice anything, so the neighbors and friends did
not</b>
<br><b>mention it. They gradually stopped coming to visit as they felt
more and</b>
<br><b>more uncomfortable in the house.</b>
<br><b>Not long after that, my father's job took us out of state and the
neighbors</b>
<br><b>moved away as well, saying they could no longer bear to live in
the house</b>
<br><b>where their daughter died. No one knows if the ghost lingered. The
new</b>
<br><b>owners never seemed troubled by anything. Maybe she was trying to
connect</b>
<br><b>back to the life she had known before after realizing she made a
terrible</b>
<br><b>mistake. Maybe she is truly gone now.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Finland Fright</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ApclpseCruiser@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi. My name is Sergei , and I've been interested in ghosts and</b>
<br><b>hauntings for a while now.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Since I was about six or seven years old. My dad got a transfer
to Finland</b>
<br><b>as a station manager of Aeroflot - Russian International Airlines.
While we were</b>
<br><b>there my parents would play volleyball every Sunday at this college
that had</b>
<br><b>a gym on the first floor. While they played their game, we (kids)
would stay in</b>
<br><b>the locker rooms, and play. That's the first time I got interested
in ghosts,</b>
<br><b>because there was one locked door in one of the locker rooms. It
was always</b>
<br><b>locked, but we did see one day that somebody was putting some basketballs
and</b>
<br><b>other sport equipment in there. One day we were playing in the locker
room</b>
<br><b>that had the door, and we heard some noises from behind it, that
seemed to</b>
<br><b>echo. I looked under the door so I could check if I could see anything.
All I</b>
<br><b>saw was some spider web floating from under the door, and wind coming
from</b>
<br><b>the inside. We heard this creepy windy sound that you hear in most
horror</b>
<br><b>movies. We all listened to hear something, and what we heard made
us go into</b>
<br><b>the other room, and we never went back to the first one. We heard
a female</b>
<br><b>voice yelling at someone, and babies crying. There were also some
plates</b>
<br><b>breaking and more female voices. All of this seemed very far away,
like it</b>
<br><b>was at the end of a very long hallway or something. And all of the
sounds</b>
<br><b>echoed a little too. That scared us pretty good, and that was the
first time</b>
<br><b>that I wanted to know more about this stuff.</b>

<p><b>Crying Baby Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>BY: Mitchell Hamand</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all the ghostly encounters I have had, this
one is probably one</b>
<br><b>of the more interesting ones.&nbsp; I was working the night shift
as a baker</b>
<br><b>for Tim Hortons at the time.&nbsp; This one night though, I was
walking to</b>
<br><b>the baker's area in the back after</b>
<br><b>having a coffee break at about 5:00am.&nbsp; Then right as I was
entering the</b>
<br><b>baker's area, I heard a young baby crying in the front of the store.</b>
<br><b>This I found to be somewhat odd because of the time.&nbsp; So I
went up front</b>
<br><b>to see the baby(I love baby's by the way) only to find the store
empty</b>
<br><b>of custumers.&nbsp; I then asked the 2 other people working that
night if</b>
<br><b>they heard a baby crying only to be told I was crazy.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a month or two after that incident, another
fellow employee</b>
<br><b>heard a young girl crying for her mother in the lady's room.&nbsp;
She then went to go help</b>
<br><b>the little girl in the bathroom only to find it empty.&nbsp; Right
after that custumers</b>

<p><b>I Wish You Were Here</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gafishe@qwest.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi There. I'm Jennifer. I guess this is where I'm supposed</b>
<br><b>to send my story. If it isn't, I'm terribly sorry. Anyways,</b>
<br><b>onward.</b>
<br><b>I was a very young girl when my Grandfather passed away,</b>
<br><b>around the age of 10. He was of Irish-Scot descendant, so of</b>
<br><b>course he was a big guy. He didn't die a violent death and</b>
<br><b>he lived a very good, respectful life. Fortunately, he was</b>
<br><b>in a coma for a day or so before he passed on. I was very</b>
<br><b>upset when my parents came home with the news. A few weeks</b>
<br><b>later, my best friend at the time (she still is) came to</b>
<br><b>spend the night. We were sitting on the floor in my bedroom,</b>
<br><b>up late talking about our Grandfathers (she had lost hers as</b>
<br><b>well at the age of 5.) I began to cry and say 'I wish you</b>
<br><b>were here, I wish you were here' repeatedly. When I calmed</b>
<br><b>down a little I felt soft, strong arms around my shoulders</b>
<br><b>and a man's voice in my ear-"You'll be allright.</b>
<br><b>Everything's allright." My friend heard it too.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Another story takes place around Christmas of 2000. I was at</b>
<br><b>my Grandmother's house. It was a festive occasion. We were</b>
<br><b>laughing, joking and decorating her tree. I, being the goof</b>
<br><b>I am, was dancing around the living room to some Christmas</b>
<br><b>song with the top of the tree on my head. I had tinsel</b>
<br><b>wrapped around my shoulders and I was trying to get</b>
<br><b>attention. My Grandmother started to laugh...and very</b>
<br><b>faintly, I heard a man laughing along with her. I looked</b>
<br><b>towards my Grandfather's chair, and I didn't see anything,</b>
<br><b>but felt a presence come very close, and one side of my body</b>
<br><b>got very warm. I didn't feel threatened. The presence was</b>
<br><b>all too familiar, and it made me smile.</b>
<br><b>A few weeks ago, I was at my Grandmother's house, and</b>
<br><b>everyone was there. Grandma, Mom, Dad, My sister, My brother</b>
<br><b>in law, my niece, my 2 nephews. Everyone was in the kitchen,</b>
<br><b>bustling and crazy. I went to the living room, and for the</b>
<br><b>first time in years, I felt compelled to sit in my</b>
<br><b>Grandfather's brown chair. So I did. The same warmth and</b>
<br><b>softness I felt at Christmas came back to me and I felt like</b>
<br><b>I did when he used to sit me on his lap and read me stories</b>
<br><b>or watch the baseball game on tv.</b>
<br><b>People on the outside of the family may think these small</b>
<br><b>experiences are b.s. or tricks my mind plays on me, but I</b>
<br><b>don't think that's so. I truly believe that "Goompa" is</b>
<br><b>still hanging around with my Grandmother, waiting for her to</b>
<br><b>pass on so they can cross over together. Plus, he loved his</b>
<br><b>family when he was here in body, and he must still feel</b>
<br><b>needed. Either way, it warms my heart, makes me smile and I</b>
<br><b>know there is someone watching for all of us; laughing,</b>
<br><b>arguing, crying or celebrating with the rest of us.</b>
<br><b>But I still miss him.</b><b></b>

<br><b>She came to comfort me!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:nathalie_gauthier@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>First, let me apologize for the mistakes I am bound to make, my being
a francophone.</b>
<br><b>This is not an extremely exciting story, but I thought it might
be interesting because it does not involve seing anything of feeling something
strange, but it involves smelling.</b>
<br><b>My mother's aunt was blind, therefore she could not live on her
own, so when her husband passed away, she moved in with her daughter.&nbsp;
Two or three weeks per year, we would take Tante Jos&eacute;phine with
us, so her daughter could take a rest and maybe go on a trip or something,
usually in the summer, so I would end up spending those days with her (I
was in my teenage) while my parents were at work, but I didn't mind because
she was a softspoken, kind person, really not demanding at all.&nbsp; We
would go on walks once or twice a day, I would cook for her, but most of
the time we would just sit around and talk or mind our own business.</b>
<br><b>One day, as everybody is bound to do, she passed away, and I must
say that for the first time, I really felt very sad about someone's death,
Tant Jos&eacute;phine was the first person who had died I knew I would
miss.</b>
<br><b>Many many years later, after having been married for five years,
and freshly separated (with all the anguish that come with such a traumatic
event), I was getting ready for work, after having dropped my baby at the
babysitter (who lived in the same appartment building). I went back to
my place and when I entered my bedroom, I could smell my great aunt's perfume.&nbsp;
Now, I had not dreamt of her the night before (actually, I never, to this
day, had a dream about her), did not think of her, nothing, she was not
on my mind at all as that moment, so it couldn't have been triggered by
my memory.&nbsp; I thought of it has being stranged, but just dismissed
it and went along with my task.&nbsp; The next morning, the same thing
happened, and I remember feeling a bit scared but I also dismissed it,
but with a bit more difficulty, even at work that day, I couldn't help
think about it.&nbsp; But when it happened again for a third day in a row,
I freaked out, and kindly (or should I say sheepishly) asked my</b>
<br><b>About a year later, I was sitting on the couch in my living room,
worrying about personal stuff, really depressed, almost suicidal, but still
not thinking about her, when her scent came to me again, very subtle at
first, but getting stronger as the seconds passed.&nbsp; Right away I said
"Please Tante Jos&eacute;phine, I know you mean no arm to me, but I really
can't handle this" and the smell just disappeared.&nbsp; It lasted maybe
three of four minutes, no more, but I knew that she had come to try to
comfort me.</b>
<br><b>I few years later, I was at a party at some acquaintances' place,
when all of a sudden, this lady guest, whom I had never seen before, tells
one of my friends standing beside me, who didn't know her neither; "There
is a man watching over you and your child, he is there to protect both
of you".&nbsp; My friend started crying, because her first boyfriend had
died four or five years previously and somehow she knew he was still around,
but to hear it stated out loud like that, she was in shock.</b>
<br><b>And then she turned to me and said "There is also someone watching
over you, it's a woman, and she is impaired".&nbsp; Right away, I tought
of Tante Jos&eacute;phine, so I asked her if she could tell me in what
way this "person" was impaired and the answer was "I don't know, I can't
see what it is", which didn't really surprise me, considering that my great
aunt was blind when she was part of this world...&nbsp; And I have to believe
what she said, because she also told me things about my then boyfriend
(who wasn't present at the party) that she just couldn't have known and
just by looking at a picture of him.</b>
<br><b>One thing worries me though: she also told me that something "evil"
was lurking around me, but that I was able to control it.&nbsp; She couldn't
tell me though what it was and if I could loose control (I certainly hope
not).&nbsp; It's been almost four years now, and nothing happened.&nbsp;
Let's hope it's going to remain that way!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Terror in Texas</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: woodpeck@onramp.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi!&nbsp; I've always been in to ghost and the supernatural stuff
but as</b>
<br><b>boring as my life is, of course nothing ever happened.&nbsp; Nothing
until we</b>
<br><b>moved into this one house in Tx.&nbsp; First off, I'll start off
by</b>
<br><b>saying the town's and house's history.&nbsp; The house was built
anywhere</b>
<br><b>between 1918-1922.&nbsp; I don't remember.&nbsp; That would make
it about 80 years</b>
<br><b>old.&nbsp; Nevada used to be a booming town.&nbsp; Stores, banks,
you name it,</b>
<br><b>they had it. Until the big tornado of 1924.&nbsp; It was an F5 and
destroyed</b>
<br><b>pretty much everything in the town.&nbsp; The only thing left was
a couple of</b>
<br><b>houses, the school, and the church.&nbsp; It killed hundred's of
people and</b>
<br><b>the bodies were kept in the church's basement until they could be</b>
<br><b>properly buried.&nbsp; There are still blood stains in the basement.</b>
<br><b>Anyways, that has nothing to do with it.&nbsp; Now, Nevada is a
small farm</b>
<br><b>town with the population of about 400-500.&nbsp; The church, the
school, and</b>
<br><b>only a few houses are still standing from the tornado.&nbsp; My
house is one</b>
<br><b>of them.&nbsp; It is on a street that used to be full of houses,
but now</b>
<br><b>there is only 2.&nbsp; Mine and the one across the street. (The
lady who</b>
<br><b>lives across the street used to live in my house)&nbsp; Back to
the ghost</b>
<br><b>story.&nbsp; My family was moving from Garland and needed a house.&nbsp;
We came</b>
<br><b>across this house and loved it.&nbsp; We were going to rent it from
the lady</b>
<br><b>whose family had built it and been passed on from generation to</b>
<br><b>generation.&nbsp; While she was showing us the inside of the house,
we came</b>
<br><b>across this one room upstairs.&nbsp; It was so cool, I decided it
had to be</b>
<br><b>my room. (of course, I later found out it was used as the sick room
back</b>
<br><b>in the 20's or 30's; a sick room is a room where they would keep
the</b>
<br><b>sick people of the family so no one else would get sick)&nbsp; When
I stated</b>
<br><b>that it had to be my room, the lady said I shouldn't have.&nbsp;
I asked why</b>
<br><b>and she said that it wasn't a very pretty room and I should pick
another</b>
<br><b>one.&nbsp; I found this strange b/c it was a gorgeous room and why
would she</b>
<br><b>care if I wanted this room or not?&nbsp; Well, we decided to rent
it out.</b>
<br><b>The first night we were there, my mom and I kept hearing doors opening</b>
<br><b>and shutting.&nbsp; We got freaked out, but that was nothing.&nbsp;
It was about</b>
<br><b>two weeks after we moved in and we were all asleep.&nbsp; Everybody's
was</b>
<br><b>downstairs except mine was upstairs in the sick room.&nbsp; I was
laying</b>
<br><b>there pretty much asleep when I heard this loud noise that kind
of</b>
<br><b>sounded like a vacuum cleaner.&nbsp; Then, I heard people screaming
(men,</b>
<br><b>women and kids).&nbsp; Then, I heard a women's voice yelling "Get
Jordan,</b>
<br><b>where's Jordan?"&nbsp; I thought it could have been the tornado
or</b>
<br><b>something.&nbsp; My whole family thought I was crazy.&nbsp; After
that incident I</b>
<br><b>moved my room downstairs.&nbsp; All my stuff was still in that room
but my</b>
<br><b>bed was downstairs.&nbsp; I remember one night in my new room I
was lying</b>
<br><b>there awake and I heard a horse galloping by my window.&nbsp; We
don't have</b>
<br><b>any horses but I passed it off as someone else's horse that had
gotten</b>
<br><b>loose.&nbsp; Then, I heard someone get off start walking around
on the rocks,</b>
<br><b>get back on and ride off.&nbsp; I got scared, covered up my&nbsp;
head and went to</b>
<br><b>sleep.&nbsp; I heard it again around 3:00am.&nbsp; Soon, things
started to happen</b>
<br><b>to the rest of the family.&nbsp; One night my mom was in the bathtub
and she</b>
<br><b>heard a man talk like he was right outside of the window.&nbsp;
She couldn't</b>
<br><b>understand him but she heard it.&nbsp; My dad wasn't home and us
kids were in</b>
<br><b>the living room.&nbsp; We've all heard this man now.&nbsp; Then,
one morning my</b>
<br><b>mom was cleaning the house and only me and her were home.&nbsp;
She started</b>
<br><b>hearing this lady hum some sort of song she had never heard before</b>
<br><b>coming from the bathroom.&nbsp; It was the type of hum you sing
when you</b>
<br><b>clean house.&nbsp; If she stood by the stairs you couldn't hear
it.&nbsp; If you</b>
<br><b>took a step in front of the stairs you'd hear it.&nbsp; One evening
I was</b>
<br><b>upstairs in my room and kept hearing someone banging on my side
of the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; Everyone denied it.&nbsp; The banging continued and
finally my dad</b>
<br><b>agreed to check what was outside.&nbsp; We all started towards the
backdoor</b>
<br><b>and were about to open it when some man in a white shirt casually
walked</b>
<br><b>right next to the door outside. (it was a screen door so we could
see</b>
<br><b>through)&nbsp; My dad furious and ready to kick the trespasser's
a$$ ran</b>
<br><b>outside but no one was there.&nbsp; The scariest incident of all
happened</b>
<br><b>early one morning before school.&nbsp; I had gotten so scared that
I started</b>
<br><b>to sleep on the top bunk of my brother's bunk bed.&nbsp; I was in
a deep</b>
<br><b>sleep and I heard a man's voice mumbling.&nbsp; I thought it was
my dad b/c</b>
<br><b>he woke me up in the mornings.&nbsp; I slowly opened my eyes and
saw a man of</b>
<br><b>about 20 or so just standing there.&nbsp; He was wearing a forest
green</b>
<br><b>colored suit and had&nbsp; reddish-brownish hair with a handle bar
mustache.</b>
<br><b>I screamed bloody murder and got under the blankets.&nbsp; My parents
came in</b>
<br><b>there and asked me what was wrong.&nbsp; I slowly raised my head
out of the</b>
<br><b>blankets and the man was gone.&nbsp; I finally talked them into
moving.</b>
<br><b>While we were packing,&nbsp; our neighbor came over. (remember she
used to</b>
<br><b>live there.&nbsp; We asked her if anything ever happened weird to
her.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>said the usual doors shutting, lights going on and off by themselves.</b>
<br><b>But then she said one story.&nbsp; She said one day she was cleaning
and she</b>
<br><b>saw a man in white at the corner of her eye just standing at the
back</b>
<br><b>door.&nbsp; She thought it was her husband until she started talking
to him</b>
<br><b>and he never answered back.&nbsp; She looked over and he was gone.&nbsp;
She also</b>
<br><b>said that when we were on vacation she would hear children laughing
and</b>
<br><b>the creaks of them swinging.&nbsp; She would go over there to greet
us</b>
<br><b>thinking we were home and no one would be there.&nbsp; After pretty
much</b>
<br><b>everything was moved we decided to have a physcic over and do a
seance</b>
<br><b>just for fun.&nbsp; She told us that this house was once used to
hide illegal</b>
<br><b>drugs or something.&nbsp; She said that someone was very sick and
locked up</b>
<br><b>most of the time in my room.&nbsp; She said the head of the house
was</b>
<br><b>mentally unstable and everyone was scared of him.&nbsp; She said
a women hid</b>
<br><b>from him in the bathroom.&nbsp; She didn't say anything about the
tornado so</b>
<br><b>we didn't know if she was full of crap or what.&nbsp; But in all
of the</b>
<br><b>closets were little secret hidden compartments, pretty small and
they</b>
<br><b>could have hid things in there.&nbsp; They are hard to see and blend
in with</b>
<br><b>the wall.&nbsp; We never told her about that.&nbsp; Finally, we
had moved</b>
<br><b>everything and we were checking every room and every closet and
we</b>
<br><b>looked in those compartments.&nbsp; We found things that have been
missing</b>
<br><b>for years and things that we had just had this morning.&nbsp; Ever
since we</b>
<br><b>left that house nothing has happened.&nbsp; Other things have happened
like</b>
<br><b>lights going on and off, doors opening and shutting,&nbsp; and even
hearing</b>
<br><b>people calling our names, but these are the major incidents.&nbsp;
Thanks for</b>
<br><b>your time!&nbsp; -Lily</b><b></b>

<br><b>Grammy,the angel,our Mother,and me</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: BigLudo@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I've always been a believer, ever since I was very young.&nbsp; What
I never</b>
<br><b>thaught was that something would ever happen to me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order for me to tell about my happenings,
I have to tell you about my</b>
<br><b>grandmother(Grammy).&nbsp; I used to always go to her house, because
she had to</b>
<br><b>babysit me cause my parents worked.&nbsp; Her and I used to bake
things, and she</b>
<br><b>would make homemade waffles and she introduced me to "mint jelly".&nbsp;
But she</b>
<br><b>had cancer.&nbsp; When I was 5 she was to sick to get out of bed,
so I would</b>
<br><b>always go in and lie on the bed with her.&nbsp; She and I would
talk, and she</b>
<br><b>would play with my hair.&nbsp; That December she died.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing really happened to me until a few years
after she was gone.&nbsp; One</b>
<br><b>night, I was sitting on my bed reading, when all of a sudden, I
felt someone</b>
<br><b>playing with my hair, then I got really cold.&nbsp; My first instinct
was to look</b>
<br><b>behind me to see what it was, there was nothing there.&nbsp; That
really gave me</b>
<br><b>the willies, but that wasn't all.&nbsp; One night, I was in my room
alone,</b>
<br><b>standing by my dresser when I heard someone or someTHING breathing
behind me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I ran out of my room and told my parents, but they thaught
that I was just</b>
<br><b>emagining it.&nbsp; After that, it was the end of the strange happenings.&nbsp;
Or so I</b>
<br><b>THOUGHT.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a year later I awoke in the middle of the
night.&nbsp; Out of the corner</b>
<br><b>of my eye, I saw a woman standing in the doorway that leads to my
bedroom.</b>
<br><b>She had dark brown hair, about shoulder length, and was wearing
a long white</b>
<br><b>dress that had long sleeves, was tight at the waist and then puffed
out at</b>
<br><b>the skirt like a ball gown.&nbsp; Even though I only saw her out
of the corner of</b>
<br><b>my eye, I could tell that she was very beautiful.&nbsp; I turned
my head real fast</b>
<br><b>to get a better look, but when I did she disapeared. Then I turned
my head so</b>
<br><b>that I was facing the wall instead of the door, and there she was
again! So</b>
<br><b>Ilooked over to see her, but she disapeared again.&nbsp; This happened
about 3</b>
<br><b>times. I really coudn't explain any of it, and when I went to tell
the rest</b>
<br><b>of my family, they thaught I was "full of it".&nbsp; But then I
realized that what</b>
<br><b>I had been experiencing wasn't a bad thing.&nbsp; I realized that
when I felt my</b>
<br><b>hair being played with, and heard the breathing, it was my Grammy
just</b>
<br><b>popping in to say "Hello".&nbsp; And the woman in the doorway HAD
to be an angel,</b>
<br><b>because the night it happened, I really wasn't scared. (even though
I was</b>
<br><b>only about 7 or 8 years old) I actually felt confortable with her
there.</b>
<br><b>After that, only one more thing happened.&nbsp; I was asleep in
bed, and then</b>
<br><b>suddenly woke up.&nbsp; And I never do this, but for some strange
reson I looked</b>
<br><b>up at the top of my bookshelf.&nbsp; When I did so, there, standing
on top was our</b>
<br><b>Blessed Mother Mary.&nbsp; Her veil and dress was blowing in the
wind and she was</b>
<br><b>looking down at me.&nbsp; She was only about a foot tall, so I thaught
that maybe</b>
<br><b>it was one of my dolls, but when I turned on the light She was gone.&nbsp;
I new</b>
<br><b>right then and there that I was truly blessed.&nbsp; I haven't had
any other</b>
<br><b>happenings since then...that is, I mean, in my own ROOM.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The End...of THIS</b>
<br><b>story.</b><b></b>
