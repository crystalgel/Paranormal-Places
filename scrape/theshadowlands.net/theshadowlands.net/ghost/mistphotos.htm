<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">One of the most dramatic types of positive
photos we get on investigations are mist photos. These photos show various
shapes of a fog or smoke-like substance hanging in the air. When these
photos are taken, this mist is not usually visible to the photographer.
While these mist photos are rarer than orb photos but they also seem appear
primarily in areas where spirit activity is being reported.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The skeptics and debunkers have a field
day with the mist photo. They say it is everything from cigarette smoke
to the</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">photographers breath on a cold night.
I would like to take this opportunity to address the most common explanations
and also give you tips so that you can make sure your photos are good quality
evidence. First off, the mist photos are not cigarette smoke. If you are
an investigator, you should never smoke anywhere near an investigation
site. This is simply common sense. In an indoor investigation, make sure
all sources of smoke such as candles and fireplaces are out prior to you
taking any photos. Over the past there years I have been keeping track
of times of year, temperature, humidity and other variables to see if I
could find a connection to ectoplasm mist to any natural explanation. After</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">reviewing this data, it is plain to see
that there is no natural explanation for these mist photos. In simple terms,
60% of the mist photos obtained were taken in the colder months of November
through March, the other 40% were obtained in all of the warmer months
including July and August. The percentages are the same for the temperature
range I divided them into, above 60 degrees (40%) and below 60 degrees
(60%). This shows that 40% of the mist photos taken were obtained in temperatures
where the photographers breath could not have caused the mist in the photo.
When tracking</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">the humidity, I was looking to see it
higher humidity was causing the mists because of the higher percentage
of moisture in the air. My research showed that mist photos were obtained
in all ranges of humidity and were actually more concentrated in the mid
to lower ranges than in the higher ranges which leads me to conclude that
moisture in the air is not the cause of mist photo either. Remember, good
researchers do not take photos in the rain, snow and</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">fog.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">It is a good practice to log in the weather
data each time you conduct any research so you can look back at your results
to see how they compare with mine and other researchers. You should first
rule out the natural before you look for supernatural explanations. There
are numerous theories on what ectoplasm mist photos are but by ruling out
what it is not, we can get one step closer to finding out.</FONT>
