<p><b>&nbsp;University of Calgary Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sjaneofthejungle@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have noticed that you don't have any ghosts listed for the University
of</b>
<br><b>Calgary residences in Calgary, Alberta.&nbsp; I had a strange experience
in the</b>
<br><b>residence tower called Rundle Hall.</b>
<br><b>To give you some brief information, there are two identical towers
(plus</b>
<br><b>some apartment-style residences) that were built in the late '60s
when the</b>
<br><b>University was founded.&nbsp; They are both seven stories tall,
with a central</b>
<br><b>communal lounge and three hallways radiating out like spokes.&nbsp;
Each hallway</b>
<br><b>has eleven rooms and a bathroom.&nbsp; Originally, they were built
as a Female</b>
<br><b>dorm (Kananaskis Hall) and a Male Dorm (Rundle Hall).&nbsp; I spent
three years</b>
<br><b>of my University career living in Rundle Hall.</b>
<br><b>The room that I shared with my roommate was in the co-ed hallway
of the 6th</b>
<br><b>floor of Rundle.&nbsp; This kind of applies, because we shared all
facilities</b>
<br><b>with guys - toilet stalls, urinals, sinks and showers were all communal</b>
<br><b>(think Ally McBeal), and we often had guys hanging out in our room
(lets</b>
<br><b>just say there were quite a few of us engineers on that floor).</b>
<br><b>I started the year living in room 661.&nbsp; One night I awoke frequently,
and I</b>
<br><b>could have sworn that there was someone in our room, sitting in
the chair at</b>
<br><b>my roommates desk.&nbsp; I passed it off as being asleep, but the
next day I did</b>
<br><b>ask my roommate, "were there people in our room last night?"&nbsp;
All she said</b>
<br><b>was, "yeah, I thought that one of the guys had come in during the
night."</b>
<br><b>Wierd.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, a little later in the year I moved into room 557 (on the
same side</b>
<br><b>of the hallway - two doors down).&nbsp; We started noticing that
in the common</b>
<br><b>room, which was a large open area in the centre of the spokes, one
of the</b>
<br><b>elevators would often come up to our floor on it's own accord, open,
close,</b>
<br><b>then go back down to the main floor.&nbsp; Sometimes it would stay
on our floor</b>
<br><b>with the door open for almost an hour before going back down.</b>
<br><b>My real experience came during Reading Break.&nbsp; I guess your
guys' equivalent</b>
<br><b>to Spring Break, only we have ours in early- to mid-February, and
most</b>
<br><b>people leave, because the skiing's awesome in the Rockies (only
a few hours</b>
<br><b>away).&nbsp; In our hallway, the only people not gone was me, my
roommate, the</b>
<br><b>girl across the hall, and the girl at the end of the hall on our
side by the</b>
<br><b>fire escape.</b>
<br><b>To start my real story, I'll give you a little explanation about
how our</b>
<br><b>room was laid out.&nbsp; If you walk into the door from the hallway,
there is a</b>
<br><b>closet on each side that extends about two feet into the room, that
goes all</b>
<br><b>the way to each wall (no doors on the closets).&nbsp; The room is
approximately</b>
<br><b>square.&nbsp; My roommates bed was against the left wall, with her
desk against</b>
<br><b>the window (directly across from the door) and the chair between
her</b>
<br><b>headboard and the desk.&nbsp; My bed was against the window, with
the headboard</b>
<br><b>against the right wall, with my desk along the right wall.</b>
<br><b>I awoke one night because I swore that the door to our room had
opened, and</b>
<br><b>that one of the guys from the guys' wing had come in (he had gone
on a date</b>
<br><b>that night, and was a close friend).&nbsp; I looked over at my roommates
bed, and</b>
<br><b>it looked like this guy was whispering something to her.&nbsp; I
found it kind of</b>
<br><b>creepy, though, that instead of crouching by her bed like a normal
person</b>
<br><b>would do, he was standing with his legs straight, bent at the waist,
with</b>
<br><b>his face about two inches from hers.&nbsp; Now, I got kind of pissed
off, because</b>
<br><b>it was the middle of the night, and this guy had come in to tell
Lauren</b>
<br><b>about his date.&nbsp; I wanted to see what time it was, so I sat
up in bed so I</b>
<br><b>could see around my desk to my alarm clock, which was on a dresser
in the</b>
<br><b>closet.&nbsp; It was 2:30-ish in the morning, so I turned my head
to yell (or</b>
<br><b>whisper strongly) at the guy.&nbsp; Then I realized it wasn't who
I thought it</b>
<br><b>was.</b>
<br><b>This is the creepy part.</b>
<br><b>He stayed bent over my roommate in the same position, but slowly
turned his</b>
<br><b>head to look at me.&nbsp; While he was turning his head, this grin
spread across</b>
<br><b>his face.&nbsp; One could interpret the grin as malevolent (I sure
did at the</b>
<br><b>time!).&nbsp; Then he slowly stood up straight, and took a few steps
backwards</b>
<br><b>toward the closet, folded his arms across his chest, and looked
at me with</b>
<br><b>that same scary grin on his face.&nbsp; It was strange, because
really, he had no</b>
<br><b>facial features.&nbsp; Nothing of a face that I could see except
for this grin</b>
<br><b>that I could more sense than see.</b>
<br><b>Well, that was enough for me.&nbsp; Like any 20 - going on 6 - year
old, I dove</b>
<br><b>beneath the covers on my bed, and stayed there all night.&nbsp;
This was very</b>
<br><b>hard to do, since the heating is very efficient in those buildings,
and most</b>
<br><b>of the rooms are usually hot enough to be in shorts and tanks in.&nbsp;
Anyway, I</b>
<br><b>did not sleep again that night.</b>
<br><b>After a week or so, thinking about this experience, having insomnia,
and</b>
<br><b>sleeping with the light on, I have second thoughts on what was going
on</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; I think that, yes, he was intentionally trying to scare
someone, but</b>
<br><b>only out of a sense of fun, because he knew he could.&nbsp; I think
he had my</b>
<br><b>roommate in his target sights, and he had his face by my roommates',
waiting</b>
<br><b>for her to wake up with this ghost-face two inches from hers.&nbsp;
Well, you</b>
<br><b>couldn't wake my roommate with a cherry-bomb when she's sleeping,
nevermind</b>
<br><b>waking to a ghoslty presence like so many of us do.&nbsp; Instead
I woke up, and</b>
<br><b>his grin was more of a 'finally, someone's awake that I can scare'
grin.</b>
<br><b>So that was it, other than the knocking, which is actually quite
funny.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was about two days after my experience, when all three of our rooms
got</b>
<br><b>simultaneous knocks at 5:30 in the morning.&nbsp; My roommate got
up to answer</b>
<br><b>the door, and scared the crap out of both her and the girl directly
across</b>
<br><b>from her by opening the door at the exact same time.&nbsp; Also
the girl at the</b>
<br><b>end of the hall had her head out the door, asking if someone had
knocked.</b>
<br><b>There was no one in the hall, and no way someone could have left
without us</b>
<br><b>hearing.&nbsp; The door into the central common room was on a pneumatic
hinge,</b>
<br><b>and made a whining noise when you opened it.&nbsp; The door to the
fire escape</b>
<br><b>(at the other end) makes a crapload of noise, which echoes through
all the</b>
<br><b>floors.&nbsp; The door to the bathroom also has a pneumatic hinge,
and bangs when</b>
<br><b>it closes.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, to close this outrageously long story, I worked for housekeeping</b>
<br><b>during the summer because the residences are rented out like hotel
rooms. (I</b>
<br><b>did not go back home in the summer.)&nbsp; I was talking with the
cleaner from</b>
<br><b>the 6th floor while doing the laundry one day.&nbsp; She related
that she has had</b>
<br><b>experiences with this guy over the last few years.&nbsp; She was
cleaning a room</b>
<br><b>after move out, and had the door propped open with the garbage can.&nbsp;
A guy</b>
<br><b>poked his head around the door, looked her in the eye, kicked the
garbage</b>
<br><b>out from in front of the door, and slammed it.&nbsp; There was no
one there when</b>
<br><b>she went to look.</b>
<br><b>There are rumours that a guy got really stressed out during exams
in the</b>
<br><b>eighties, and threw himself off the roof into the parking lot.&nbsp;
I have not</b>
<br><b>substantiated these claims, so who knows.&nbsp; I do know that the
roofs are now</b>
<br><b>off limits to students, whereas they weren't in the past.&nbsp;
The cleaner says</b>
<br><b>that he is quite shy, and is only seen during Summer, Christmas,
an Reading</b>
<br><b>breaks.&nbsp; Never when the residences are filled with people.</b>

<p><b>My Daughter Jazmyne</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Hellopurrtylady@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>When I was six or seven months pregnant with my son Anthony I had
a little nightmare or so call.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every night I would
sleep with the bedroom door half open and also had the hallway light on
just because of wierd strange things been happening. That night around
1 or 2am I was awokening with a strange noise. As I started to open my
eyes I seen this little girl standing in my doorway. She was a black shadow
from 5 feet away from my bed. But the strange thing was I could see this
beautiful little girl with long black hair and big round eyes. I see her
as a lost child instead of a scary shadow. At the same time looking at
her I couldn't move at all. Laying in bed stiff as a board she started
to approach me even closer. The closer she get the more beautiful she look.
Suddenly the figure got on my bed and lay on top of me. With her big eyes
looking up at me I didn't feel scared at all. Then I heard this small voice
calling me " MOMMY!"&nbsp; When I woke up that morning I could still feel
her presence and I will never forget that look until I had my second child.
It's a girl of course.</b>
<br><b>One day when Jazmyne was 4yrs old I was taking a nap while she watched
t.v.. She woke me up and she was on top of me staring with this familiar
eyes smiling at me at the same time with her big grin which of course I
started to remember this black shadow calling me "MOMMY" and to my surprise
Jazmyne said "MOMMY". As I looked into Jazmyne's eyes I still that little
girl I seen 4yrs ago before Jazmyne was even born. I bet you she came back
as my living child. I also reminded Jazmyne not to scare me with her big
round eyes again. Especially when we are alone in the same room.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Poster Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: eckinger@comcast.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>i have a story that is very odd and i would like to share it.&nbsp;
the upstairs of my house always made me very uncomfortable.&nbsp; however
my room always seemed to be "safe".&nbsp; until this happened... i had
just hung a poster in my room that said "you suck and thats sad"</b>
<br><b>( it was a happy bunny poster which is a rabbit that has merchandise
with insulting sayings on it) now i have a crate like set of shelves that
this poster was behind and the shelves are approx. 2 inches from the poster.
so i awoke one morning to find my poster ripped in half . i&nbsp; asked
my mother if she had done this or if she knew how this happened, she said
no and i believed her she would really have had no reason to do this anyway
and does not usually interfere with my belongings.&nbsp; so that option
was gone.&nbsp; i also have cats but in order for them to rip my poster
they would have had to jump up with their claws out hit the wall and my
poster and slide down the wall about 6 feet to the floor. as i do not think
my cats are graceful enough to do this that option was gone.&nbsp; i was
left to believe that my room was no longer as safe as i thought it was.
i think i may have insulted whatever it is.&nbsp; however i have since
taped it back together and nothing has happened to it since.</b>

<p><b>Something Touched Me</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ShaggyZxHonkie@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This is something that happened to me when I was around 6 or 7 years
old. I've tried telling a lot of people...my parents, friends, cousins..the
only person that believes me is my grandma. When I was little for some
very strange reason..at night my room had to be pitch black for me to sleep.
If there was any light at all I couldn't sleep. My mom had to buy black
curtains for me because of the street lamps. Anyways..for the longest time,
I'd always fall asleep facing my door. After about 5 or 6 months living
in that house, my door would open and close for hours everynight. I remember
telling my mom and step dad, but they said I was dreaming. It never really
scared me, I'd just lay there and watch it until I fell asleep. One night,
I remember laying in bed waiting for my parents to go to sleep, for the
door to start. But for some reason it didn't do it that night. Then later
that night, I woke up for some reason and I couldn't get back to sleep.
I was laying on my side facing my window, which was unusual, when I felt
something touch my stomach. I was too scared to open my eyes so I just
laid there. Then I felt it wrap around my neck. It was choking me. I was
too scared to open my eyes so I just laid there hoping one of my parents
would come in. Then the door opened and it stopped. I jetted to my parents
room screaming. This time my step dad decided to sleep in my room...about
an hour afterwards..he came into his room where my mother and I were, and
told us to get dressed and we went to a hotel. Now, I can't sleep unless
theres light in my room, and I probably won't ever be able to. Its really
weird though, like these things happen to people who never really had much
to do with this stuff.</b>
<br><b>This happened to my friend. We were talking about stuff like this,
and I asked him if anything weird ever happened to him. I was kind of just
looking for him to scare me and make something up, but he promised me these
things happened. One night he went to bed with the lights and TV off, and
woke up in the middle of the night to find his phone off the hook. He said
he knew his mom couldn't have done this, because his door was locked. He
waited a few minutes, then for some reason he picked the phone up and put
it to his ear, and he said he could hear children laughing but somewhat
faded. He figured he was hearing thing and hung the phone up and went back
to sleep. Then when he woke up in the morning it was off the hook again,
and his TV was on. He said he wasn't really scared...the TV was on Cartoon
Network, and he heard children laughing, so it obviously was children.
He thought that maybe they wanted to play. HE invited me to stay the night
with him so I could see it for myself. We were on the floor in his room
playing cards, when his light turned off. When he walked over and turned
it back on the cards were scattered. We just laughed and started playing
again. So, he definitely has playful spirits. -He also told me that when
his Grandmother was in the hospital, the picture of her on the wall in
the family room fell, and as soon as it hit the floor..the phone rang.
It was the hospital calling to tell them she was gone.If anyone has any
advice or anything about what happened to me, please e-mail me.</b>

<p><b>Native Reservation</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: shelob1971@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was looking for spiritual&nbsp; and paranormal websites and found
yours, I thought that you may be interested in my story. this is my personal
experiences with ghosts and the unexplained .the experience i had was when
i was a teenager, about 15yrs old.(mid 1980's)I live on a native reservation
in Saskatchewan, Canada. our family moved to this house in summer 1981
our house was about ten to fifteen years old at the time of my experience
my bedroom was in the basement of the house in the north left corner. .
i feel that my story needs a bit of background. my older brother (two years
older), used to come to my room and we would listen to music or just talk
about our childhood, we were close all though our childhood right up until
high school and we both went our seperate ways. now when we listened to
music he would sit in a chair tapping and humming to a song that was in
his head.</b>
<br><b>after he moved out of the house i was asleep. and i always had a
night light on (the room gave me the creeps) i was asleep one night and
i was awoken by the sound of someone tapping and humming to a tune in the
corner of the room, i thought my brother was back to visit and didnt want
to wake me suddenly, then i remembered that he moved away nad the chair
that he sat on was taken out of the room. the corner was empty except for
my laundry there.i was wide awake when i realized this then i heard a movement
i opened my eyes , but i was facing the wall with my back to the corner,
i started to pray and ask for help and courge and to make this go away,
as i was praying a male voice whispered in my ear "Hurry up!"....it was
said as tho someone was right against my ear. i could feel a presence right
behind me, i closed my eyes and started praying harder. i then gathered
up courage nad jumped out of bed. my room was still lit with the night
light and the room was empty. i ran upstairs and everyone was still asleep.i
slept on the couch for the rest of the night.</b>
<br><b>i could never forget that voice nor what it said, and to this day
i cant figure out what it wanted or why it said that.my sister lives in
this house now,and she still has problems with it , there are sounds of
someone yelling or maoning in the basement , the sound of a loud banging
, and small children who enter the basement tell of a man they see (a man
in black) calling them into the north left corner room. my own daughter
had that experience. she came back upstairs and told me "that black man&nbsp;
wanted me to follow him into the room, i asked her what&nbsp; he said...she
told me that he said.."Allie come here".(allie is my daughters nick name,
her real name is alicia).(happened this past spring,2004) I told her.."never
follow him..ever , hes not a good man"... and i told her to never go down
there alone. what we were taught about ghosts was to go to where u have
seen them and tell them to go away, or even yell at them and chase them
away.(so thats what my sister and i had done).(2003)my younger brother
was visiting my sister and they slept in the spare room, their son(aged
five at the time) woke up early , he woke his dad and said,"dad the little
kid in the basement wants me to play with him downstairs"...my two nephews
were not home at that time, they were in the united states visiting their
dad. there were no other children in the house that morning.&nbsp; he woke
his wife and they all left immediately. to this day no-one enters the basement
alone. people have also seen a man in black standing in the kitchen, peeking
from the bedroom doors or going down stairs. my sister still lives there
and she sleeps with the lights on in her room and the kitchen as well as
her two sons room. her sons share a room because they refuse to sleep in
a room by themselves. there are many experiences from this house alone,
babies have been heard crying outside in the middle of winter, people have
been seen walking by the door,we hear people outside.etc...alot of differnet
people have seen or heard things and all see the same person in black ,hes
usually angry or just the mere presence of him is felt even tho he may
not be seen. I would also like to note that there are many native reservations
and native homes that have paranormal experiences. and to my knowledge
most have never been investigated. in our culture the belief of ghosts
and spirits is very strong. I rarely meet a skeptic when it comes to ghost
hauntings and stories. my neice and i decided to put a cassette tape recorder
in the basement, we dont know if we did it wrong but all we heard was the
noise of the house, except for three loud bangs that sound like someone
stomping on the floor upstairs. I dont have the resources or equipment
to do a proper investigation of these types of hauntings, and would like
to know if your site has information that deals with native stories and
experiences. please let me know if u can shed any light on my stories or
why this is happening to our family. this house or the area it sits on
seems to have a history and we believe thats why its an active area for
the paranormal. i dont know where to begin looking for information concerning
this area or history ,all i have been able to gather was stories from the
elderly people, some of whom have passed on yrs ago. i do know that there
is a "lost grave yard" in our general area ,as well as a "ceremonial" spot
, but it was so long ago no one knows where they were.&nbsp; there are
also three sunken areas in the front yard that resemble graves but we dont
know for sure, there are stones on the hill in the back yard that have
carvings underneath , we also have no idea what they are, or whether they
are just natural weathering of the stones..when one stays on that hill
at night u can hear whispering and chanting, it sounds as tho it is coming
from undreneath. thank you for your time, and i do hope to hear from you
as soon as possible.</b>

<p><b>A few Years Back</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dee12_7@yahoo.co.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>I would just like to share with you what happened in my house a few
years back.This probably seems silly in comparison with other experiences
you're given but I thought id tell you anyway.I share a room with my sister
and one night I woke up around4am and could not go back to sleep. As I
was lying there, wide awake,I thought I heard my sister whisper my name(she
sometimes calls my name in a way that no others say it).I turned and whispered
back "what?"but she was sound asleep.I then thought I imagined it but then
seconds later I heard it again, but stronger and slower.My insides went
cold with this and I thought I was losing my mind!I was now sitting upright
in the bed and heard it one more time before I tore out of the room!I decided
it was best not to discuss it with anyone, until some weeks later, one
morning my brother rushed into my room and said something seriously wierd
happened the night before. He said he woke up and heard a voice as clear
as day whispering his name.He reckoned he also saw a blurred figure as
he opened his eyes but put that down to possible sleep in his eyes.&nbsp;
Not long after that he had another strange thing happen. He was in the
sitting room watching telly.My father has a collection of small hardback
books which he keeps standing together on the shelf above the telly which
had been standing,undisturbed,for a long time.As my brother sat there,
one of the books came flying out of the shelf and onto the floor. Around
this time another odd thing happened to my sister and I. My mother was
working upstairs and my brother had gone out for the evening so my sister
and I decided to watch some telly.Everything was fine until we heard a
pressing on the door handle so we thought that my mother was coming in(she
has a habit of leaning on it before opening it!)the door handle went down,the
door opened around a quarter of the way, and closed again.The door handle
was still down while it was being opened so we put it down to our mother
forgetting something upstairs and going back to get it. Seconds later,
my mother came down the stairs and came in. We asked her why she opened
the door and then closed it like that but she insisted that she was upstairs
the whole time. My brother returned home hours later so it definately wasnt
him and my father works long hours so he wasnt home.Nothing has happened
since, so I feel a bit skeptical now about any presence in my house.</b>
<br><b>Maybe all of this could be put down to logic, as I've tried to do
myself (if theres logic to it all, please let me know!).My mother reckons
if there is something there it is doing no harm so it should be left well
enough alone. Maybe shes right!</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Library</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sanctabones@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to relate experiences that have occured
to me and to other</b>
<br><b>staff members at the public library I have worked at four 6 years.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The building the library is in (since 1967) was formerly
a large private</b>
<br><b>residence built in 1873.&nbsp; It was lived in by various members
of the same</b>
<br><b>family until the late 1950's, in the early 1960's it was deeded
to the</b>
<br><b>county by a grandaughter of the original owners.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Most of the strange occurences have happened in the downstairs
(formerly</b>
<br><b>the basement) of the library, where the children's section is located.</b>
<br><b>Members of staff have organized and locked up the library in the
evening,</b>
<br><b>only to come back the following morning to find books pulled out
of shelves</b>
<br><b>and scattered on the floor.&nbsp; This occurs about every 3-4 months,
and has</b>
<br><b>been happening as far back in years as anyone on the staff can remember.</b>
<br><b>Fifteen minutes before closing time, a staff member heard someone
in the far</b>
<br><b>back of the room, knocking into the shelves. She had been under
the</b>
<br><b>impression that there was no one else in the children's dept. at
the time,</b>
<br><b>she went to investigate.&nbsp; The knocking continued to happen
until she turned</b>
<br><b>to walk down the aisle of shelves where it came from.&nbsp; The
knocking suddenly</b>
<br><b>stopped.&nbsp; On another occasion, a library volunteer was placing
books on the</b>
<br><b>shelves from a pushcart when the cart was violently knocked over
for no</b>
<br><b>apparent reason.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; There is also an elevator that connects the first floor (basement)
to the</b>
<br><b>second and third floor, the third floor being for staff use only.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>personally have seen the elevator go to the third floor, as if someone
had</b>
<br><b>pushed the button.&nbsp; The elevator will then open upon the second
or first</b>
<br><b>floor--nobody inside.&nbsp; It could be called a prank, except that
no member of</b>
<br><b>staff was upstairs the four times I have seen this happen.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; As far as any of us can find out, there were no known deaths
in the</b>
<br><b>building when a family lived there.&nbsp; No one has ever claimed
to see any</b>
<br><b>appartion, although I and other people have felt watched at times,
usually</b>
<br><b>on the first floor.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; We have an annual ghost story reading for kids at Halloween
in the</b>
<br><b>children's dept.--at least no real ghost has showed up yet to scare
them!</b><b></b>

<br><b>with guys - toilet stalls, urinals, sinks and showers were all communal</b>
<br><b>(think Ally McBeal), and we often had guys hanging out in our room
(lets</b>
<br><b>just say there were quite a few of us engineers on that floor).</b>
<br><b>I started the year living in room 661.&nbsp; One night I awoke frequently,
and I</b>
<br><b>could have sworn that there was someone in our room, sitting in
the chair at</b>
<br><b>my roommates desk.&nbsp; I passed it off as being asleep, but the
next day I did</b>
<br><b>ask my roommate, "were there people in our room last night?"&nbsp;
All she said</b>
<br><b>was, "yeah, I thought that one of the guys had come in during the
night."</b>
<br><b>Wierd.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, a little later in the year I moved into room 557 (on the
same side</b>
<br><b>of the hallway - two doors down).&nbsp; We started noticing that
in the common</b>
<br><b>room, which was a large open area in the centre of the spokes, one
of the</b>
<br><b>elevators would often come up to our floor on it's own accord, open,
close,</b>
<br><b>then go back down to the main floor.&nbsp; Sometimes it would stay
on our floor</b>
<br><b>with the door open for almost an hour before going back down.</b>
<br><b>My real experience came during Reading Break.&nbsp; I guess your
guys' equivalent</b>
<br><b>to Spring Break, only we have ours in early- to mid-February, and
most</b>
<br><b>people leave, because the skiing's awesome in the Rockies (only
a few hours</b>
<br><b>away).&nbsp; In our hallway, the only people not gone was me, my
roommate, the</b>
<br><b>girl across the hall, and the girl at the end of the hall on our
side by the</b>
<br><b>fire escape.</b>
<br><b>To start my real story, I'll give you a little explanation about
how our</b>
<br><b>room was laid out.&nbsp; If you walk into the door from the hallway,
there is a</b>
<br><b>closet on each side that extends about two feet into the room, that
goes all</b>
<br><b>the way to each wall (no doors on the closets).&nbsp; The room is
approximately</b>
<br><b>square.&nbsp; My roommates bed was against the left wall, with her
desk against</b>
<br><b>the window (directly across from the door) and the chair between
her</b>
<br><b>headboard and the desk.&nbsp; My bed was against the window, with
the headboard</b>
<br><b>against the right wall, with my desk along the right wall.</b>
<br><b>I awoke one night because I swore that the door to our room had
opened, and</b>
<br><b>that one of the guys from the guys' wing had come in (he had gone
on a date</b>
<br><b>that night, and was a close friend).&nbsp; I looked over at my roommates
bed, and</b>
<br><b>it looked like this guy was whispering something to her.&nbsp; I
found it kind of</b>
<br><b>creepy, though, that instead of crouching by her bed like a normal
person</b>
<br><b>would do, he was standing with his legs straight, bent at the waist,
with</b>
<br><b>his face about two inches from hers.&nbsp; Now, I got kind of pissed
off, because</b>
<br><b>it was the middle of the night, and this guy had come in to tell
Lauren</b>
<br><b>about his date.&nbsp; I wanted to see what time it was, so I sat
up in bed so I</b>
<br><b>could see around my desk to my alarm clock, which was on a dresser
in the</b>
<br><b>closet.&nbsp; It was 2:30-ish in the morning, so I turned my head
to yell (or</b>
<br><b>whisper strongly) at the guy.&nbsp; Then I realized it wasn't who
I thought it</b>
<br><b>was.</b>
<br><b>This is the creepy part.</b>
<br><b>He stayed bent over my roommate in the same position, but slowly
turned his</b>
<br><b>head to look at me.&nbsp; While he was turning his head, this grin
spread across</b>
<br><b>his face.&nbsp; One could interpret the grin as malevolent (I sure
did at the</b>
<br><b>time!).&nbsp; Then he slowly stood up straight, and took a few steps
backwards</b>
<br><b>toward the closet, folded his arms across his chest, and looked
at me with</b>
<br><b>that same scary grin on his face.&nbsp; It was strange, because
really, he had no</b>
<br><b>facial features.&nbsp; Nothing of a face that I could see except
for this grin</b>
<br><b>that I could more sense than see.</b>
<br><b>Well, that was enough for me.&nbsp; Like any 20 - going on 6 - year
old, I dove</b>
<br><b>beneath the covers on my bed, and stayed there all night.&nbsp;
This was very</b>
<br><b>hard to do, since the heating is very efficient in those buildings,
and most</b>
<br><b>of the rooms are usually hot enough to be in shorts and tanks in.&nbsp;
Anyway, I</b>
<br><b>did not sleep again that night.</b>
<br><b>After a week or so, thinking about this experience, having insomnia,
and</b>
<br><b>sleeping with the light on, I have second thoughts on what was going
on</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; I think that, yes, he was intentionally trying to scare
someone, but</b>
<br><b>only out of a sense of fun, because he knew he could.&nbsp; I think
he had my</b>
<br><b>roommate in his target sights, and he had his face by my roommates',
waiting</b>
<br><b>for her to wake up with this ghost-face two inches from hers.&nbsp;
Well, you</b>
<br><b>couldn't wake my roommate with a cherry-bomb when she's sleeping,
nevermind</b>
<br><b>waking to a ghoslty presence like so many of us do.&nbsp; Instead
I woke up, and</b>
<br><b>his grin was more of a 'finally, someone's awake that I can scare'
grin.</b>
<br><b>So that was it, other than the knocking, which is actually quite
funny.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was about two days after my experience, when all three of our rooms
got</b>
<br><b>simultaneous knocks at 5:30 in the morning.&nbsp; My roommate got
up to answer</b>
<br><b>the door, and scared the crap out of both her and the girl directly
across</b>
<br><b>from her by opening the door at the exact same time.&nbsp; Also
the girl at the</b>
<br><b>end of the hall had her head out the door, asking if someone had
knocked.</b>
<br><b>There was no one in the hall, and no way someone could have left
without us</b>
<br><b>hearing.&nbsp; The door into the central common room was on a pneumatic
hinge,</b>
<br><b>and made a whining noise when you opened it.&nbsp; The door to the
fire escape</b>
<br><b>(at the other end) makes a crapload of noise, which echoes through
all the</b>
<br><b>floors.&nbsp; The door to the bathroom also has a pneumatic hinge,
and bangs when</b>
<br><b>it closes.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, to close this outrageously long story, I worked for housekeeping</b>
<br><b>during the summer because the residences are rented out like hotel
rooms. (I</b>
<br><b>did not go back home in the summer.)&nbsp; I was talking with the
cleaner from</b>
<br><b>the 6th floor while doing the laundry one day.&nbsp; She related
that she has had</b>
<br><b>experiences with this guy over the last few years.&nbsp; She was
cleaning a room</b>
<br><b>after move out, and had the door propped open with the garbage can.&nbsp;
A guy</b>
<br><b>poked his head around the door, looked her in the eye, kicked the
garbage</b>
<br><b>out from in front of the door, and slammed it.&nbsp; There was no
one there when</b>
<br><b>she went to look.</b>
<br><b>There are rumours that a guy got really stressed out during exams
in the</b>
<br><b>eighties, and threw himself off the roof into the parking lot.&nbsp;
I have not</b>
<br><b>substantiated these claims, so who knows.&nbsp; I do know that the
roofs are now</b>
<br><b>off limits to students, whereas they weren't in the past.&nbsp;
The cleaner says</b>
<br><b>that he is quite shy, and is only seen during Summer, Christmas,
an Reading</b>
<br><b>breaks.&nbsp; Never when the residences are filled with people.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Night in Pa.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ghost_of_fear_4@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have been reading the stories on your site for a couple of months,
now. I've found quite a few of them very interesting. Some are so wicked,
its hard to believe they're true...I'm not saying they aren't. I'm just
saying they're really scary.</b>
<br><b>This happened about a month ago. I, just about two months ago, moved
to New York from Pennsylvania. I was visiting my friend, Ashley, for a
few days because my parents and I came back to PA to visit family and friends.
Her and I always talk about ghosts and stuff, to scare each other.</b>
<br><b>Ashley lives in a big white house, on a back road. There isn't many
houses on this road, and its mostly a wooded area. Therefore, it tends
to get creepy at night. We were in the basement watching horror movies,
eating ice cream and drinking soda, of course. Her parents and older brother,
whom I've secretly been in love with forever ;], were sleeping on the second
floor. Her brother had a friend over, also. We had to flip a coin to see
who got the basement...since her parents didn't like the idea of 4 kids
in the basement all night.</b>
<br><b>Anyways...we were sitting on the sofa, cuddled up, watching</b>
<br><b>'The Puppet Master', when we heard something in the other room fall.
(Her basement was divided into 2 parts.) We were both really scared, teens
tend to get like that when watching these movies. We looked at each other,
and ran up the steps to her brothers room.</b>
<br><b>We told him and his friend what happened and asked them if they'd
come check it out. They basically laughed at us, but decided to come down
with us. Ashley and I jumped on the sofa and the two guys went in to check
it out. When they came out, they looked rather scared. They wouldn't tell
us what they saw, and just made us come up in their room with them. (I
was happy!! lol)</b>
<br><b>Anyways, Ashley and I were bugging them to tell us what they saw.
They wouldn't. So, Josh (Ashley's brother, his friends name is Jason) told
me and Jason to go downstairs and get some junk food and soda, and to grab
a movie or something. As we were going down the steps, Jason said to me,
"I don't think I'll be staying the night here anymore!" I just kind of
laughed and asked him why. Then he told me what they seen in the basement.
He said they opened the door and there was a black image...like the body
of a child, sitting on the computer chair. He said they could hear it breathing,
and the keyboard had been unplugged and was laying on the floor next to
the chair. I guess thats what we heard fall.</b>
<br><b>When we were getting the soda from the fridge, we seen something
walk past the doorway in the hall...going towards the living room. I jumped
and grabbed on to Jason. He told me to chill out, and that it was probably
Ashley and Josh trying to scare us. So...we walked into the living room
and looked around. There was nothing. We grabbed the uff and went back
upstairs. When we got to the room...Ashley was there..but Josh wasn't.
She said he seen something walk past his doorway too and went down the
hall into the extra bedroom to see what it was. When he got back he said
he couldn't find anything. So, we were sitting there on Josh's bed, really
freaked out. We were talking about it, trying to figure out what was going
on. Ashley and Josh said they never had anything like this happen before.
Then we heard something walking up and down the steps....and we heard children
laughing, but like it was in the distance...somewhat far away. We just
locked his door and went to sleep. Josh was on his bed and Ashley, Jason
and I were on the floor. We were all just laying there talking about stupid
stuff to take our minds off what had happened. I'd say about 10 minutes
later..I felt Jason wrap his arms around me..and whisper that something
was touching his feet. I know he felt really stupid...him being 17 and
me only 15...and him turning to me for help..so I told him to calm down
that I might have touched his with mine or something. He said that it was
a hand, but we were all laying the same way...with our feet by Josh's bed.
I told him to scoot over, that it was probably Josh messing around with
him. (I was a bit jealous..I'd rather have Josh touch my feet. lol)</b>
<br><b>Anyways, I was in the middle, next thing i know, Ashley is telling
me something was grabbing her feet too. Whatever it was...was under Josh's
bed..(I know it sounds stupid..but its true) Eventually I felt it, and
we just curled our legs up, away from the bed. When all fell asleep sooner
or later. When we woke up...we looked under Josh's bed, and there was two
matchbox cars and a green crayon. Josh was 17, and didn't have anything
like that. We figured it was a little kid, and he just wanted to play.
The next night the feet thing happened again...but we weren't scared. The
only thing I don't get..is why he would unplug the keyboard and throw i
on the floor...? thanks for your time. If you have any comments or questions..E-mail
me.</b>

<p><b>The House On The Corner.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Whisperb4igo@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I awoke to the sound of footsteps, the shaking of my bed, and the
smell of light flowery perfume. I always thought that the house was haunted
but, logic was easier and less scary. It was around three A.M. I laid still
for a moment just listening to sounds, trying to distinguish the sounds
of an old house settling and, an old haunted house. I felt the presences
of someone in my room, but could see no one. I was scared! My body wanted
to up and run, but, my fear keep me there. Barely breathing. So I think.
I felt another presences enter my room, but this one was not scary. In
fact, I felt safe and peaceful. I moved my head slightly to my right side
and seen a white aura kneeling next to me My head begin to feel like it
was being stroked and I heard the words" Everything will be okay, All the
angels in heaven loves you." I felt so safe. I moved my eyes down toward
the foot of my bed and seen papers floating in mid air. I felt a third
presence walk into my room. I didn't want to take my eyes off the white
aura next to me. I couldn't speak to yell for help, or move to run. It
was like I was in a trance. In the center of the room hung a long chain
where the light fixture is, It started to swing back and forth. I could
see it from the corner of my eye. A feeling of sadness overwhelmed me.
I know I was awake because, I remember looking at the posters on my wall
and registered everything that was happening so, I could tell someone.
All of a sudden My boyfriend woke up. He asked me who the blond hair girl
was swing the light fixture? Why are there papers all over the bed? I looked
to see the blond hair girl, but I seen no one. My kneeling white aura was
know longer next to me. I rolled over and went back to sleep.</b>

<p><b>The Apartments</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: shealtm@sympatico.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>Just thought i would share my experiences with all of you. Im an
empathic sender-receiver clairaudiant\voyant. Since I could remember I
have always felt "entities" and people around me, and been able to communicate
with them. I'm a human tape recorder for EVP's, I don't need a recorder
to hear it.</b>
<br><b>I used to live in this house that was haunted by a man and woman,
I have had dreams about how the woman died...She was in a pool (we didn't
have one in the backyard) face down and as I looked at her she slowly turned
around to face me and pointed at me. I got the feeling of drowning but
not on water, on blood. I have also seen her face to face in my foyer,
ectoplasm and all. The man is a poltergeist of sorts, whispering things
in my ear, even screaming it. I was doing laundry at 10 PM once and had
just closed the laundry room door when he banged on the door, sent me flying
up the basement stairs, let's just say that I don't do laundry at 10 pm
anymore *laughs*. I've also seen him as a black streak out of the corner
of my eye. The first night we moved into the house there was a woman screaming
and crying in the vents of the house, the furnace is fairly new so I don't
think it was the furnace, and my brother in law (who lived with us at the
time) said he heard it too. The cold cellar I hate going into, it gives
me the creeps, like that's where both of them are stuck, not able to leave
the house. Come to find out a husband committed a murder suicide in the
house, killing his wife then himself. I wonder if it's them that haunt
that place.</b>
<br><b>The apartment that I live in now has an imprint of a little girl
about 5 to 7 years of age that brushes her teeth at 3 am every morning
like clock work. I've lived in apartments that literally have portals for
spirits and entities in them, have seen some interesting things in my lifetime.
From being attacked psychically by some entity that tried to "feed" off
my fear to the Ouija board telling me I would have three kids that would
be a year apart from each other, come to think of it my kids will be 3,
2 and 1 this september coming._</b><b></b>

<br><b>Sharing my Harley</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hrspwr@connext.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was riding into the sunset by myself today 8/19/04. The temp was
about 90 and it was really humid here in central MD. A "presence joined
me on my motorcycle as I was going about 50 on some old roads headed west.
My HD is the large touring bike [2000 FLHTCI]and equipped with a great
stereo. I was listening to Still in Saigon by Charlie Daniels. As the song
played the hair on my body stood up and I was engulfed with emotion for
Vietnam vets.</b>
<br><b>The feeling was one of happiness to be riding and one of suffering
for those who didn`t come home. I wanted to smile and cry, I could only
control the bike by trying to accept what was happening and not fight it.
The presence left after maybe a mile of riding.</b>
<br><b>I bought this bike from a dealer locally, the previous owner was
a Vietnam veteran and had to sell the bike due to health issues 3 years

<br><b>My Friends Apartment</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tda23@go.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I came across your website and I have been reading it nonstop!!&nbsp;
I had</b>
<br><b>an experience when I was younger that I would like to share with
you.</b>
<br><b>When I was about 15 years old, I had a friend who lived in a little</b>
<br><b>apartment with her mom in our town.&nbsp; I found out later that
this</b>
<br><b>apartment, which was in a really old building with a store front,
used</b>
<br><b>to be a doctors office.&nbsp; Well, weird things used to happen
there all</b>
<br><b>the time.&nbsp; My friend told me that if she was having a fight
with her</b>
<br><b>mom or something, the sink would start running or the tv would come
on</b>
<br><b>by itself.&nbsp; This stuff seemed to happen more often when people
in the</b>
<br><b>apartment were mad or fighting.&nbsp; One time I was there, and
we came home</b>
<br><b>from school, locked the door and went into her bedroom.&nbsp; When
we came</b>
<br><b>out about an hour later, the door was wide open!!!&nbsp; It was
freaky.</b>
<br><b>Well, one night I slept over and I stayed in her bedroom and my
friend</b>
<br><b>slept on the couch in the living room.&nbsp; Her bedroom in the
apartment</b>
<br><b>had no windows, so if the lights were out it was completely dark.&nbsp;
In</b>
<br><b>the middle of the night, I woke up out of a dead sleep and sat straight</b>
<br><b>up in bed.&nbsp; Now, this is where it gets crazy.&nbsp; Although
the lights were</b>
<br><b>out and it was absolute darkness, I could see everything in her
room as</b>
<br><b>if the lights were on.&nbsp; I remember seeing the stuff on her
dresser and</b>
<br><b>on the floor, I also remember that my eyes were wide open so I couldn't</b>
<br><b>have been dreaming.&nbsp; At the foot of her bed, she had a desk
with a</b>
<br><b>chair and there was a man sitting in the chair staring at me.&nbsp;
He had</b>
<br><b>blond hair, but I couldn't make out his facial features.&nbsp; I
shook my</b>
<br><b>head and everything became dark again.&nbsp; I only saw the man
for a few</b>
<br><b>seconds before I shook my head and everything went dark.&nbsp; I
got really</b>
<br><b>freaked out and went&nbsp; into the living room and slept on the
floor next</b>
<br><b>to my friend (who was on the couch).&nbsp; At first I thought it
was a</b>
<br><b>dream, but I KNOW that I was awake and my eyes were open!!&nbsp;
I could see</b>
<br><b>the whole room perfectly and the lights were off!!&nbsp; It wasn't
until I</b>
<br><b>shook my head and ran out of the room that it became dark again.&nbsp;
Also,</b>
<br><b>I almost never wake up in the middle of the night, I am a very sound</b>
<br><b>sleeper.&nbsp; I've thought about what happened a million times
and I've</b>
<br><b>decided that whoever that man was, he was not trying to scare or
harm</b>
<br><b>me, he just seemed curious. This happened over 10 years ago and
I have</b>
<br><b>only told 2 people about this because it seems so crazy.&nbsp; I
also have</b>
<br><b>another story, but I will email you later about that one because
it's</b>
<br><b>getting late!&nbsp; I grew up in New Jersey about 5 minutes away

<p><b>My Dead Uncle (2 true stories)</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hellopurrtylady@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>1-&nbsp; My uncle past away strangely with unknown reasons. Doctors
couldn't figure out what had happened. I just think his wife poison him
for his life insurance, that's why she requested no autopsy being done
on him. Anyways, I was his favorite of course so one night while me and
my husband was sleeping at my mother's house he decided to mess with us.
That night I had a bowl of mangos laying on my bedside table ( that was
his last meal ) and a sharp knife. I was laying next to the wall while
my husband was laying close to the table. He was awaken by a loud silware
shaking against eachother. When he open his eyes he seen just the knife
hitting against the bowl. So scared out of his mind he asked me to switch
side. I was to sleepy to ask why. About half an hour past i heard movements
in the room also the bed and table was shaking. I woke up my husband and
he stated "i move because of that"!!! Then everything stopped moving except
my mango bowl it still was shaking. Thinking it might have been an earthquake
so i ignored it. Then the bedside table started to move. So i screamed
out for my mother. She also said that it was my uncle looking for food.
if you know what i mean. Never again did me and my husband sleep there
again.</b>
<br><b>2- Around midnight, it was very hot that night. I was sitting next
to the window in the living room when I happened to glance over at my aunts
house up the hill. I seen a figure dress in white walking up the path to
her house and when it reach to the steps to the door it walked away like
upset. All of a sudden i heard a noise and looked the other way, a second
later i glance out the window and the figure was gone. Next morning i asked
my aunt was she awake at that time and she responded yes but no company
came that late. So i told her about the figure and she said it has to be
uncle. He left because he wasn't welcome. Asian tradition is once your
dead your not welcome means they asked the buddhists to bless evil and
spirit to stay far away from their home.</b>

<br><b>My Dad's House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Amberdinni@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was 10 we moved into the house my father currently lives in
which is situated behind a cemetary with headstones dating back to the
early 1800's.&nbsp; When I was about 15 or so, when I started going out
with friends and coming home late at night I started sensing strange things.&nbsp;
I would come home late, after the family had gone to bed and I would not
turn on lights so I wouldn't wake people, I would walk down the hallway
and I could feel someone walking with me, on occasion he would be walking
in front of me, I could see his shadow in front of me.&nbsp; He is a tall
man about 6 foot 4 at least.&nbsp; I got to the point that when I came
home I would say hello to my ghost and he would just kind of dissappear.&nbsp;
He never did go into my room, he would walk me to my door and stay there.</b>
<br><b>When I was 7 my uncle died in a tragic accident and when I was 18
my grandfather died suddenly.&nbsp; I never really recovered from my uncles
passing, I was very young and I missed him greatly. After my grandfather
died I was laying in bed one night and felt the end of my bed go down like
someone was sitting there and my first thought was it was one of my cats
(I have four, it wasn't out of the realm of possiblity) so I opened my
eyes to see which cat was there and my Uncle Melton and my Grandfather
Pat were sitting on the footboard looking at me.&nbsp; Instead of freaking
out I was happy and things began to get better after that. I had gone through
a great depression when my grandfather died and went off the deep end.</b>
<br><b>My family does not take pictures very often but I can see Orbs in
my back yard and in the house and at my grandmas house you can see them
around my grandfathers room where he slept and out in his barn where he
spent a lot of time.</b>

<p><b>The encounters my brother and I have had in our house have been few,
but still very strange.&nbsp; The first time I remeber anything strange
happening in our home was shortly after we finished putting a second floor
on the house.&nbsp; The rest of my family was sleeping, and I was staying
up watching t.v. in my living room.&nbsp; I heard what sounded like someone
walking&nbsp; down the stairs, I looked over to see a&nbsp; woman in a
long flowing nightgown walk down the stairs and head towards the kitchen.&nbsp;
I at first thought it was my mom coming down for a glass of water (she
wears nightgowns to bed a lot).&nbsp; I then got up to talk to her, walked
in the kitchen and found no one there.&nbsp; Obviously shaken, I quietly
went upstairs to my bedroom and went to sleep.&nbsp; The next encounter
I had was with my brother.&nbsp; My parents had just taken the dog for
a walk and the only people who were in the house were my brother and I.&nbsp;
I was practicing piano in the office when I heard what sounded like someone
walking up the basement stairs.&nbsp; Frightened I ran up to my brother's
room where he was reading.&nbsp; We both listened as the sounds traveled
through the kitchen and up the stairs.&nbsp; At this time we both freaked
and made a run for it.(My bedroom was right next to my brother's and the
door was wide open.&nbsp; It was cold outside and all of the windows in
the house were closed.)&nbsp; While running down the stairs we heard my
bedroom door slam shut.&nbsp; We then waited outside until my parents came
home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most recent encounter happened to my brother.&nbsp;
He was playing Game Cube very early one morning, he had a sleepover and
our cousin was also in the basement sleeping. He had felt like someone
had been watching him all night.&nbsp; According to him, he looked into
one of the glass panes on a painting on our wall and saw the reflection
of a woman stairing back at him.&nbsp; He claims she was wearing very old
clothing, and when he looked back again she was gone.</b>
<br><b>These events were pretty spread out, with almost a year inbetween
them all.&nbsp; I sometimes get weird feelings when I am alone in the house,
and I do not go into the basement after dark.&nbsp; Also at times my dog
sits on my parent's bed in total darkness and barks at the walls for no
apperent reason.</b>
<br><b>Our encounters are few, but I really feel like we are sharing our
house with another being or beings.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Matthew</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jenwickman@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>through out the 4 years that I lived in my home, several incidents
happened in which me believing that ghosts really do exist!&nbsp; There
is an open archway connecting the living room and the kitchen.&nbsp; One
day while the children were playing outside andI was vacuuming, I felt
that someone was watching me.&nbsp; I looked and got a quick glance of
a small child, about 3 ft in height, blonde hair, and wearing overalls.&nbsp;
He was looking from the kitchen around the open arch into the living room,
then quickly disappeared.&nbsp; I turned off the vacuum and followed the
direction of the child, surprised to see that no one was there.&nbsp; Because
the child resembled my youngest son, I presumed it was him.&nbsp; I then
went outside to see what he wanted, amazed to see that he and his older
brother was running through the sprinkler! (They both were wearing swimming
trunks.&nbsp; Other incidents including hearing faint giggling when it
was just me in the house, my oldest child complained of being tripped by
"Matthew"this was the name that my children gave him, being the&nbsp; (he
felt a hand&nbsp; just above the front part of the foot) Many times while
I was cooking or doing dishes I would feel a tug on the back of my shirt,

"Matthew" was like any other child, and got on my nerves, but we grew to
love hi just the same!</b><b></b>

<p><b>I have lived in Virginia most of my life and have 'seen" what others
don't see since I was 5 years old. Well as I am now searching my family
roots I am discovering that all the places that I have received such a
strong "pull"toward and seen the most "activity" are places that I have
a genetic link to. My mother's family have been here since Jamestown and
have always been involved in politics and social concerns.</b>
<br><b>I have many stories to tell,many I have witnessed myself . I have
investigated many of my "sightings" to try and find out the whole stories
behind the hauntings after "they" have presented themselves to me.&nbsp;
I have some answers but there are many more I am still searching out the
facts.</b>
<br><b>I even have had one haunted house warn me of my own up coming death
and the death of others. I didn't heed it's warning,but "the house" then
"ran interference" for me so I could get away. Although I did die ,I was
brought back,even the Doct tors don't understand how, Others weren't so
lucky. But that is another story.</b>

<p><b>The Bedroom and the Little Boy</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: redspikeshorty@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I would like to share my experience with you and what I think may
be the supernatural. My brother and I have what I guess would be a gift
to sense things about people, events before they happen, and even things
we can't see. He and I have had several conversations about being awakened
in the middle of the night by a presence or a feeling of being watched.
Sometimes that presence is an evil one. Sometimes it is not. Hence from
this, I will share my story.</b>
<br><b>I have had several "strange" experiences over the course of my life.
The one that stands out most is this one:</b>
<br><b>About 7 years ago, my now ex-husband and I bought a cute, little
two-bedroom, A-frame house. It was about 70 years old, having been built
around the end of WWII. I don't know much about it the house other than
it was a rent house and changed hands several times. The bedroom we had
picked to be our daughter's room had a very strange feeling. It was like
a pressure or sense of foreboding. The closet in the room was just as creepy.
It was a regular everyday closet, yet it was like being in another world
if you stepped into it. After we moved in, I would rock my daughter in
the room with the door shut. I would always feel a sense of panic, that
I needed her to go to sleep so I could leave the room.</b>
<br><b>When my daughter was about two or three, she came to me one morning
and said, "There was a little boy who was trying to scare me, but his Mommy
told him to stop and then he left." I asked her what little boy she was
referring to, since she and I were the only ones at home. She told me the
little boy that was standing in the hallway had scared her. Well, there
was no little boy standing there, and I put it out of my mind with e exception
of creepiness value. It wasn't long after that that my daughter developed
what some describe as "night terrors." The thing is, she was never asleep.
This would happen when we would go to put her to bed in that room. She
would scream bloody murder and run in circles around her room and come
into the living room begging us to let her stay up. We had to completely
close that closet door, hang blankets over the windows and lay with her
until she fell asleep. This lasted a couple of weeks and then as abruptly
as this started, it stopped. She then began to talk of the man who lived
in her closet and how he would come out to visit her. Being two or three,
I could never tell if she was making it up or truly seeing something. I
always sensed things in there, but never saw anything.</b>
<br><b>Time went by and we had another daughter. I was in that bedroom
changing her diaper one evening. My husband and oldest daughter were in
the living room playing. As I was leaning over the baby bed, I distinctly
felt a finger grip the back of my skirt and tug! I turned around to tell
my oldest daughter to stop, but there was no one there! I picked up my
baby and literally ran out of the room!</b>
<br><b>Not long after that, I remember dreaming about a little boy in a
Texas Rangers baseball cap. The only thing is, I am sure I was awake. He
was nearly transparent. The baseball cap was very recognizeable, but his
features had almost a "Casper" quality. I remember he reached out to pat
my arm, like a child would to awaken its mother. It was at that point I
screamed. My husband sat up gasping asking what was wrong. I told him and
he laughed and said I had had a nightmare. Well, it scared me so badly,
I asked him to switch sides of the bed with me. Several months later, I
had the same dream again. The little boy had found me on the other side
of the bed. I screamed again! After that second time, I never saw him again.
My daughters would come to the side of the bed, and for a long time, I
was scared because I wo d awaken to see a small child. OF course, those
times it was my own! I began to wonder if the little boy I saw was the
same one who had scared my daughter several years earlier.</b>
<br><b>I divorced my husband last year. He stills lives in that house and
the girls still have the same room. I never hear of any strange occurances,
partially because my ex-husband doesn't believe in things like that. However,
I have had other strange occurances in my present house that I live in
by myself. It makes me wonder if something is following me wherever I go!</b>

<p><b>Number of Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: blinkfan198@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had quite a number of experiences with ghosts, and I thought
I'd</b>
<br><b>share them with you...</b>
<br><b>The first was when I was younger. I had my great grandmother's chair
in my</b>
<br><b>room. She passed away the year before I was born - I was born on
the one</b>
<br><b>year anniversary of her death. When I was younger everynight I can
remember</b>
<br><b>seeing her sitting in that chair, not really doing anything, just
sitting</b>
<br><b>there. That was fine, I don't think I was ever scared of that, but
after she</b>
<br><b>disappeared a man dressed in all black with a hat and a trenchcoat
would sit</b>
<br><b>on the edge of the bed and stare at me all night, but by morning
he was</b>
<br><b>always gone. This went on every night for about 2 weeks. No one
believed me,</b>
<br><b>but I was terrified! So finally one night I asked the man who he
was and he</b>
<br><b>didn't answer, so I told him to go away so he just disappeared.
Neither him</b>
<br><b>nor my great grandmother ever came back. We got rid of the chair.</b>
<br><b>My second ghost story is from a few months ago when my neighbor
and I went</b>
<br><b>to go see a house her cousin was renovating. The house was over
100 years</b>
<br><b>old. There were 4 floors, and the top floor was simply a small hallway
and</b>
<br><b>the master bedroom. We were all up in the master bedroom and my
neighbor and</b>
<br><b>I were in the closet, totally amused at the fact that the closet
slanted</b>
<br><b>downward like a semi-steep ramp. I went back down when her cousin
went back</b>
<br><b>downstairs, but my neighbor stayed in the room for a minute. She
SWEARS as</b>
<br><b>she came back down that she turned off all the lights as she came
down. When</b>
<br><b>she came out me and her cousin were already at the car and he said
to her "I</b>
<br><b>thought I told you to turn off the lights!" and my neighbor swore
up and</b>
<br><b>down she did but when we looked at the house ALL the lights were
on. So her</b>
<br><b>cousin went up and we watched as all the lights slowly went back
off. Well</b>
<br><b>the second he came out of the house, ALL the lights went back on
again. He</b>
<br><b>got freaked out so we left. The next day he went back to the house
and all</b>
<br><b>the knives were out on the kitchen counters, and when he got upstairs
the</b>
<br><b>bed in the master bedroom was pushed up against the door. After
researching</b>
<br><b>the house he found out that about 100 years ago a woman was stabbed
to death</b>
<br><b>by her husband and he hid her in a box under the floor of the closet.
(Which</b>
<br><b>explains the slope in the floor.)</b>
<br><b>I also have a picture from a plantation in St. Maarten where you
can see a</b>
<br><b>ghost sitting in the tree if you would like me to pass it along.
I also have</b>
<br><b>stories of two ghosts that live in my house - very nice, playful
ghosts. I'm</b>
<br><b>sorry I dont really have time to share the rest of my stories, but
if you</b>
<br><b>are interested in them I will be more than happy to send you another

<br><b>My Son's Dog</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: GLamb@anl.gov</b><b></b>
<p><b>My son passed away unexpectedly in 1998.&nbsp; His dog, a male Akita,
passed away 9 months previously.&nbsp; He also had another Akita which
I still have. About 6 months after my son left us, I had gotten up in the
middle of the night to use the bathroom.&nbsp; Living along, I didn't bother
to shut the bathroom door.&nbsp; I saw the dog, the only animal in the
house, come out of my son's room (the doorway was visible from the bathroom)
and go down the hall.&nbsp; I heard toenails clicking on the hallway tile.&nbsp;
I thought it strange that the dog came of my son's old room because it
had been sleeping next to my bed when I got up to use the bathroom.&nbsp;
Anyway, I started talking to the dog saying, "Now you get up in the middle
of the night and want to go out and I'll have to wait until you're ready
to come back in before I can go back to bed and I have to get up early
to go to work and you can sleep all day".&nbsp; I went through the house
and to the back door where the dog always goes when it has to go out.&nbsp;
It wasn't there so I checked the kitchen and living room and it wasn't
there either.&nbsp; I next checked my bedroom and there she was, asleep
in the same position and location as when I got up to use the bathroom.</b>
<br><b>I was wide awake and not only saw the dog clearly, but heard the
toenails clicking on the tile.&nbsp; For those of you who don't know, an
Akita is a pretty big dog..my dog weighs 110 lbs. and is about 27" at the
shoulder.&nbsp; I've have other experiences that have made me wonder if
they were paranormal, but this is the only time I actually seen a "spirit".&nbsp;
If it wasn't the spirit of my son's dog, what did I see?</b>

<br><b>Grammy's Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Squirrel68@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I grew up in my grandmother's house with my family and I living on
what was made into a second floor house of what was actually a single family
home in Lynn, Ma. We lived this way until I was 14, at which time my grandmother
died in her bedroom. Shortly thereafter, we moved into the remainder of
the house which is a very large 8 room house with all the rooms of considerable
size. One night my parents were over my aunt's house and my siblings were
out and about.&nbsp; I was home alone with my dog. I was watching television
in what was now our family room (that faces towards our dining room, which
had been my grandmother's bedroom). I thought I heard someone call my name
very faintly like a whisper;&nbsp; it was coming from the dining room area.
I brushed it off, but was sure I heard something. At this point, I looked
down at my dog and he was staring into the dining room and turning his
head from side to side as dogs do when they are confused. This was enough
for me so I took the dog for a long walk until someone else came home.
This is not the end of the story either, when I was talking with my oldest
brother about it he told me that he had been up late watching TV when the
French doors facing towards the hallway slowly opened on their own, he
said that he thought it could have been the wind, but then they closed
equally as slow.</b>
<br><b>Several years later my girlfriend at the time, now my wife, was
sitting in the kitchen of this same house while I was speaking with my
brother in the family room, I was only gone for a minute or two but when
I returned my girlfriend asked me who the lady was that just walked past
her in a blue bathrobe and with curlers in her hair. I told her that I
hadn't seen anyone walk by me, but she was adamant that there was no way
I couldn't have seen her as she walked right through the doorway I had
just came into. I got the chills because I remember that my grandmother
would always go to bed with curlers in her hair. Also My girlfriend had
never met my grandmother as she had passed away about 6 years before we
got together.</b>

<p><b>The Little Girls</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dasa01902@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This story needs just a bit of set up.</b>
<br><b>An ex-girlfriend of mine has a friend who lives in a haunted house.
the</b>
<br><b>house has a sad history. In 1988 the house caught fire, and two
little</b>
<br><b>girls, (I forgot their ages, probably between 4-7 years old), were
caught in</b>
<br><b>the fire, and were killed.</b>
<br><b>Me, being an avid believer in ghosts and such, had asked my girl
if we could</b>
<br><b>check out the house. We got the ok from her friend, and we went
in. Now,</b>
<br><b>I've always been sensitive to the supernatural, I feel things, but
my girl</b>
<br><b>could SEE things.&nbsp; Her friend had told us that the hauntings
of the house</b>
<br><b>had become increasingly worse over the last few months. Doors would
slam,</b>
<br><b>and things would fall off of shelves. My girl's friend had been
at the top</b>
<br><b>of the stairs, and she felt someone push her. Luckily, she didn't
fall down</b>
<br><b>those stairs.</b>
<br><b>We started our "tour", in the basement, and as soon as we went down
there, I</b>
<br><b>got chills and the feeling like I was being watched. I also felt
pure</b>
<br><b>malice. Whatever was in that basement, wanted no part of us. As
I walked</b>
<br><b>through the basement, I came to what I think was a retaining wall,
it was</b>
<br><b>four feet high, and stone. Dirt was piled to the top of it, on the
other</b>
<br><b>side. Almost like one of the basement's storage compartments had
been walled</b>
<br><b>off and filled with dirt. While next to that wall, I had a feeling
deja-vu,</b>
<br><b>which I couldn't explain, and to this day, can't explain.</b>
<br><b>We left the basement, and went to that living room. There are two
dogs in</b>
<br><b>the house, and when they saw me come out of the basement, they freaked
out,</b>
<br><b>growling at me, and showing their teeth. I crouched, and offered
my hand,</b>
<br><b>and they reluctantly came to me, and then they were fine.</b>
<br><b>So, upstairs we went, to the room that the little girls had died
in. As soon</b>
<br><b>as we walked in, my girl&nbsp; flung her head around, and said that
the spirit</b>
<br><b>had ran from the room, which I thought was odd. We stayed in that
room for a</b>
<br><b>while, and it was as if a blanket of saddness had been put over
us. It was</b>
<br><b>almost unbearable, we were both openly weeping. As we went through
the rest</b>
<br><b>of the house, I kept feeling different things, sadness, anger, malice.
It</b>
<br><b>was so odd. I asked my girl;s friend is she wanted me to do a wiccan</b>
<br><b>banishment ritual to get rid of the spirits, and at that moment,
I felt a</b>
<br><b>chill and the hairs on my arms stand up. I suddenly felt, for lack
of a</b>
<br><b>better term, "unwelcome". The woman said no, that she was used to
the</b>
<br><b>spirits. We left then, unfortunately, I didn't have a camera or
any</b>
<br><b>recording equipment so I could document this odd tale. I wish I
had.</b>

<p><b>You Warned Me</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Lbell2@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>For years I have had one unexplained occurrence after another.&nbsp;
I grew up in a small town in Ga.&nbsp; There never seemed to be a true
calm night go by.&nbsp; From the time that I can remember lights would
turn on and off by themselves.&nbsp; Stereos and televisions would turn
on and off in the middle of the night.&nbsp; There would be voices.&nbsp;
Two of them.&nbsp; A man and a woman would talk constantly.&nbsp; They
would not be talking to each other.&nbsp; The voices would each be saying
something different .&nbsp; You could disturb them just by coughing,etc.&nbsp;
but then they would start back up soon after.&nbsp; The rocking chair in
our den would rock constantly.&nbsp; Balls of light would sometimes pop
up.&nbsp; If you walked toward them they would disappear.&nbsp; On occassion
my bedroom door which would get stuck in the door frame would slam open
so hard in the middle of the night that the door would literally vibrate.&nbsp;
Imagine that rude awakening.&nbsp; To be young and have these things happen
was more scary than I can put into words.&nbsp; There were witnesses to
these activities.&nbsp; As I grew into my teenage years other oddities
would start showing up.&nbsp; I had a way you might say of knowing things
before they happened.&nbsp; My best friend would not leave her house without
a prediction you might say.&nbsp; Also, I noticed that these happening
seem to be directed to my presence.&nbsp; For instance, when I would come
home from school I would place my books etc. on the kitchen table, walk
down the hall come back to the kitchen to get my stuff and it would be
just gone.&nbsp; No one else at home but me.&nbsp; You turn the place upside
down and your things are nowhere to be found. You question your sanity.&nbsp;
This would happen so often that somedays I would stand in the middle of
the living room and yell at mid air that "I would greatly appreiciate it
if you would please return my stuff."&nbsp; It would always show up where
I had left it.&nbsp; These occurences happened alot with jewelry also.&nbsp;
Like I said before I knew that I was the focus when it came to unusual
activitiy.&nbsp; There is more that I haven't even added here.&nbsp; However
I had read just enough to make me realize the pictures that appeared in
my mind about what would happen in the future were or could be connected
to some of the events mentioned above was enough to scare me to death.&nbsp;
Next I just out right tried to stop the images.&nbsp; I did a pretty good
job of ignoring them until my daughter came along.&nbsp; I also would of
never thought my daughter would experience any paranormal activity.&nbsp;
However one after she was lying on our bed watching television when her
little dog preceeded to bark like I have never heard her bark before.&nbsp;
I walked (more like run) just in time to see a black shirt that had been
left in the floor fly straight up and across the room by it's self.&nbsp;
My daughter just started screaming.&nbsp; I was not impressed.&nbsp; This
was an entirely different residence than the one above.&nbsp; We were both
scared, except she showed it by screaming and I did not.&nbsp; How do you
explain that to your five year old, when seen it too.&nbsp; Here we go
again.&nbsp; Several other things happened like the vaccum coming on in
the middle of the night, etc.&nbsp; Those kind of things.&nbsp; When we
bought our present home it felt good.&nbsp; Maybe just maybe nothing weird
would happen anymore.&nbsp; Did I get fooled.&nbsp; When my daughter turned
around ten years old there was a another incident.&nbsp; One morning before
school she comes screaming and crying to me.&nbsp; She kept screaming about
this little girl.&nbsp; Once she had calmed she explained to me she had
seen a little that was about her age.&nbsp; This little girl appeared to
have to of drowned.&nbsp; The ghost you might say kept trying to tell my
daughter something that my daughter could not understand.&nbsp; My daughter
could not hear what the ghost was trying to tell her.&nbsp; Once she told
me all of this, I had an automatic panic attack I guess.&nbsp; Fear, adrenaline,
fear.&nbsp; What was I going to do.&nbsp; This ghost showed itself to my
daught several times over about a week period of time.&nbsp; My husbands
response was to take her to a counselor.&nbsp; I wasn't quite sure that
was what she needed.&nbsp; I finally came to conclusion that the only way
to be rid of this situation was have my daughter take control and order
it to leave and never return, which she did.&nbsp; No more ghost.&nbsp;
The situation was finally over.&nbsp; Later I found out from a friend that
there was a lake on our property years ago.&nbsp; Well as of now the only
thing that seems to be unexplained is at night through my bedroom windows
is what appears to a shadow of a man walking by.&nbsp; I have tried every
way to try to explain what this is.&nbsp; I have sat by the window and
looked for light reflections , etc.,&nbsp; I can't find anyway to explain
it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time my husband seen it he jumped up out of bed
and loaded a shotgun and went outside looking for the man that just went
by the window.&nbsp; I finally got him to listen so I could explain that
it happens every night.&nbsp; He just happened to never notice it.&nbsp;
The first time my daughter seen it she just tripped out.&nbsp; I had to
explain to her not to be scared I had noticed it along time ago.&nbsp;
There was no one outside the window.</b>
<br><b>I know this is forever a long story, but there is something else.&nbsp;
For years, when I go to sleep it's like I float.&nbsp; I have looked down
on my body from the ceiling.&nbsp; I have went to places and have seen
and met others.&nbsp; I do not like it.&nbsp; I do not feel in control
and that scares me.&nbsp; Actually the only control that I feel like I
have is to wake myself up.&nbsp; It will happen even if I take a nap during
the day.&nbsp; I am not educated enough on any of these subjects to know
what to do about them.&nbsp; I have read a couple books and actually a
fairly well known psychic called me at home one day.&nbsp; That shocked
me.&nbsp; This lady has published a book recently.&nbsp; She sent me copy.
For some reason she felt she just had to talk with me.&nbsp; She was a
very kind lady.&nbsp; She preceeded to tell me I had special gifts that
I would not talk to anyone about.&nbsp; That I had very powerful pschyic
grandmother .&nbsp; She described my grandmother.&nbsp;&nbsp; I really
did not know what to say.&nbsp; I have not talked with her again.</b>
<br><b>I still have pictures pop up in my mind as recenty as this morning.&nbsp;
It was about my son who is 19 and the police.&nbsp; I warned him and within
less than an hour he was pulled over by the sheriff for riding has four
wheeler on the road.&nbsp; He just looked at me and smiled and said, "you
warned me."&nbsp; Oh yes I warned him, but luckily he wasn't ticketed.</b>
<br><b>Well anyway I could go on and on but I will stop here.&nbsp; Thanks
for taking the time to read.&nbsp; It's nice to be able to share my stories
and not be totally thought of as crazy.</b>

<p><b>Tennessee Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mistyreed1015@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This home was located in Knoxville, TN This was 10 yrs ago The house was
completely surrounded by This leads me to think that the house may no longer
be there...a recent address satellite imagery showed what could still be
the house, but can't tell from it....</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now I do have to give you just a bit of background before I go to into
things, cause over the years I have thought some of the things going on
at the time may have played into what we went thru....</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My Sister-in-law and Brother-in-law lived in this house before we did,
they said some odd things happened , you know like things disappearing
then reappearing later, small things..things that could be anything, or
nothing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The house held 2 other tenants, one lived upstairs in what was probably
once all upstairs bedrooms, and one lived in a small part off the breeze
way, it was a small one room, area, is the best to describe....We lived
in the bigger downstairs part, which being it was an old house would have
been the main part in the old days.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The guy in the small room, was seldom home, don't blame him actually. The
girl upstairs often called my sister-in-law saying she heard us yelling
and screaming, on nights we weren't even home... in fact once we were at
my sister-in-laws when the upstairs girl called to say we were throwing
things around... we came home to all the stuff on the wall and in my bookshelves
on the floor, all the stuff on the wall was rare......we even called the
police and filed a report, although nothing was missing, nor did either
neighbor see anything, just heard things....these things did not happen
to the neighbor when my sister-in-law lived there....</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We moved there when I was about 4 to 5 months pregnant with my son,(my
only child) so around late June, maybe early July of 1990.&nbsp; Our marriage
wasn't so great even then, my husband (ex-now) was seeing others, not coming
home much and when he came home he was often angry, and abusive.. We lived
there until August of 1991. I of course was going thru lots of stress,
first pregnancy, all alone, quite a lot, so I often think of Poltergeist
now when I tell this story... but onward.....</b>
<br><b>It started out with things like the tape measure was missing, sitting
right out on the bar and then gone, of course my husband thought I had
already put the darned thing up, I was a CLEAN FREAK when I was pregnant,
and yelled at me for a good 5 minutes, then he walked into the kitchen
and there it laid, the tape measure.... Of course, he swore, I had put
it back while he was in the bathroom...many things did that...but I figured
we were moving in, and I was maybe not thinking as I put things here and
there....I did have lots of other things on my mind.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
began to settle in, It was really nice to have a large place after living
in a one bedroom, 1960's trailer... I hung a lot of pictures on the wall,
(I honestly don't do that much anymore)&nbsp; 2 in particular, an 8x10
of me when I was about 5yrs old, and the first framed picture I had ever
bought on my own, for my very first place, (an old cheap print of some
abstract looking vase and cat, with the cheap plastic gold frame, from
the dollar store) this picture just meant a lot to me, cause it signified
when I went out on my own to live, now to think of it, it was pretty ugly....
The 8x10 of me was one of my husbands favs, and personally one of the best
pics I have ever taken...LOL</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would hang
those 2 pictures back up almost 3 times a day, some days more often, for
the next year...</b>
<br><b>I would leave the living room where they both hung, and before I
was across the next room I would hear a BANG as the 8x10 would hit the
floor.. Before I could get done with what I was doing I would hear the
second lighter bang of the cheap print hitting the floor... I would always
calmly go back into the room, and say "please I really like these pictures
please, let them stay up.." of course they fell constantly, like I said
I was a freak about cleaning when I was pregnant, and I would honestly
rearrange the living room daily if the urge hit that week, I did notice
that certain arrangements would make those pictures fly farther and more
often.....of course they tended to fly more often when the husband and
me were arguing, or if I was stressed cause he hadn't come home for a day
or so...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course I began
to just ignore it, figured it seemed to mean no harm, just playful? Heck
maybe it was me, some king of "Carrie" thing going on... ha hah....</b>
<br><b>I continued to pick up the pictures, but it did begin to annoy me...
we had a beautiful Doberman puppy that my mom gave me, but I had to get
rid of the poor animal, it was never able to sleep in that house, she constantly
whined and cowered, and refused to ever leave the living room, which seemed
to scare the hell out of her, but the rest of the house scared her worse.....she
would run out of the liivng room to the sunroom which had a backdoor and
sit and cower at the door till I let her out, I always expected her to
run away, but she just stood in the yard and stared at the upstairs window...
the one I always swore the upstairs girl stared out at me thru... once
I was sure it was here scaring the dog, and thought if I just could see
her car in the drive I would go talk to her about this... I looked around
the corner of the house, and , yeah you guessed it her car wasn't there...
but that in no way means someone wasn't up there... I have never proved
to myself that it wasn't a real person looking out that window....That
dog never sat foot in any other room of that house, she went on to a great
family, and was a great pet, she died about 2 yrs ago, natural causes....they
kept in touch with me, cause I thought the dog was a basket case... I think
the house was the problem...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still I was the only one to really experience
these things, my husband had been there several times when the pictures
fell off the wall, but he always said it was cause I wasn't hanging them
right...he to thought the dog was crazy, and I was following it right down
the same path.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scariest thing to personally happen
to me, was the first night I was home with my son from the hospital, the
husband had went out to party or something, and I was home alone with a
new baby, I had him in the bassinet in my bedroom with me, the bedroom
we were sleeping in at that time was separated from the kitchen by a locking
door...the kind with the slide lock on the inside of the bedroom... I got
up while my son was asleep to get something to drink, as I stepped thru
the door into the kitchen the door shut behind me, no big deal I figured,
it will keep me from waking the baby... well then I heard the slide lock
slide... and yes, my new born baby was locked in my bedroom... I panicked...
there was no other way in that room... and I then heard my once sleeping
baby making these happy cooing noises.. I could peek thru the crack, and
I swear he looked as if he was looking up and smiling....( I know newborns
don't smile they have gas, but it was what it looked like!!!) I firmly
and loudly said "Stay away from my baby!!!" and the slide lock slid back
as I was looking at it thru the crack in the door!!!!!! Of course I busted
into the room scaring the baby to death, he screamed, I cried, and that
room was ice cold....for about a minute or so, I recall that perfectly
cause not only was my mommy instinct kicking in, I remember I was using
a small space heater and it had clicked off right before I went out, it
was on and red hot when I went in....</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband, who was extremely
skeptical would laugh at me, and say it was insane rambling... until one
morning about 4 or 5 days before Christmas we were watching the news and
our little Christmas tree was sitting next to the TV on a box actually
so it looked bigger... all of the sudden slowly and surely enough to grab
both or our attention one of the glass balls on the tree lifted up and
came out about 2 feet from the tree and box, it sat there long enough for
me to look at my husband, and say "you do see that too, don't you?" he
never stopped looking at it, and he was white as a sheet, he was able to
nod his head and I said "see what I mean",&nbsp; just before it fell onto
the hardwood floor and of course shattered... Best thing that did was make
him never doubt me again, and if he thought about doubting me, he got more
proof about 2 months later...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had changed to the
middle bedroom, so I could sleep closer to the baby, (the middle room was
the babies room)&nbsp; and late one night I woke up to hear a "swish" noise,
like something swinging back and forth, as I went to sit up and look, I
heard my husband say quietly and sounding scared to death, "you don't want
to look" by then I had probably seen enough cause I didn't look, and all
I said when I heard the BANG was "well this time it managed to break the
picture"... I had moved that cheap print into that bedroom over the dresser,
and the next day my husband tells me he woke up to that noise real slight,
and looked at the picture as it was swinging on the wall like the wind
might be blowing it some, no fan, no windows open, so he had to watch,
like he was hypnotized he said, by the time I woke up it was swinging wide
enough to touch the ceiling, he said like some hand had it by the middle
and was swinging it on the wall....when I got up and found it, the glass
was broken, the cheap frame bent, and the picture itself was laying on
the ground.. I swear I taped that thing right back up on the wall, of course
it didn't stay, and it actually ended up ripped during a bad fight my husband
and I had....cause it was laying in the floor as he walked thru the room....</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 8x10 of me when I was a
kid, I continued to hang back up ,it hit the hardwood floor enough times
to completely bust the glass out, and damage the frame some until it actually
disappeared ,well the picture itself did, I found the mangled frame in
a box of stuff after we moved, I do recall packing the entire thing up....
I never have seen my copy of that picture again...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never actually
saw anything in that house, I know that dog did, and I know something was
there, I think of Poltergeist cause they say they come around when lots
of stress is on someone in the house... and I was under LOTS of stress.....my
marriage was lousy, my husband was cheating on me, and when he was home
he was hitting on me....I still wonder if it was something in me... I have
never since been under such stress, but I have been in paranormal situations
since....</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not long before we moved
out, the girl who lived upstairs moved out, and I was kept up many a nights
as something paced the floors up there, sometimes stomping really hard
If I fell asleep...reminded me of clog dancing...LOL</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband worked
night shift, so he missed lots of that, but as little as we can agree on
anything now a days, we do still agree on the things that we saw there...
somewhere he has the picture of him standing in front of the living room
mantle with that cheap print hanging there, and a large red looking orb
right next to that picture...not near the glass so it could be a flash
reflection, but beside it on the wall.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I wish he would let me have it, I know it scared the hell
out of him the first time we saw it, don't know why he would keep it,&nbsp;
but he really doesn't like me much anymore...that's ok, I ain't real fond
of him...LOL</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can always think of more little
things that happened there, some could have explanations some might not...I
do know when I did the address imagery search, I was honestly scared to
look at the picture in case that house jumped out at me... and while my
ex and I were still married and we would go to Knoxville to visit I would
often say" let's go see it the house is still there..." He always refused
cause he was honestly afraid that whatever was there might recall us as
we passed and come back with us....That house really made him a believer.........
I had already seen and believed... it just annoyed me, then scared me,
and now a days it makes me curious, as to what went on, was it something,
or was it me????</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Hauntings that still Happen</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: yashayazoki@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been seeing ghosts for about ten years, it
all started to happen when I was five. I would see this little girl about
my age stand at the foot of the bed and wave for me to follow her. The
first few times that I saw her I was scared to death and didn't move, but
after a year or so I decided to go see what she wanted.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She took me to the main room, which was right
down the hall from my room, and pointed to another young figure that was
in the dark. This other young figure looked like she was sitting in front
of a candle that was dimly burning, but when I turned the light on there
was no girl or candle. I stood there frozen with fear for a few minutes
and turned the light out and they disappeared.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A week later I heard my mother talking to my
grandmother about how she is seeing figures go in and out of the rooms
and thought it was me, but when she checked to see where I was I would
always be asleep.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing that I wasn't the only one that saw these
figures was a relief, but it scared&nbsp; me more to know they were real.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This lasted for a few years and than stopped
when we moved into our new house. At this time I was about eight years
old and about a year of living in our new house I had forgotten about the
figures. We lived in this new house for about three years when my grandmother
moved into a smaller house and we moved in with her.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of a sudden I started to see figures again...but
this time they were more active. I would hear the cabinets open and close
in the kitchen, and lights would turn on and off by themselves when I was
home alone. After awhile I got to where I always wanted to be around someone.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three to four more years passed and we moved
out of our grandmother's house and into the house that we onced lived in.
A couple of days passed and nothing happened as usual, and I wasn't worried
because nothing never happened here before, but after the fourth night
I started to see tall men, but they were more like shadows. For some reason
I was not scared of them, but looked at them like angels and not ghosts.
I even named them...the taller one was Bill, and the other was Bob. I don't
know why I named them...but when I called to them after having a bad dream
they would come. I loved these ghosts until I woke up about one o' clock
in the morning and I couldn't breath...it felt like someone was choking
me. All I could see was his eyes and they looked evil.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that accident I still didn't tell no one,
I was about thirteen and I was scared that if I told someone that either
they wouldn't believe me, or things would get worse.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A year later we moved into a two story house that was
next door to my grandmother. This frightened me more sence they were ALWAYS
more active where she lived, but to my surprise nothing happened! No figures
or voices...I thought that Bill and Bob were gone forever....but I guess
that my luck ran short. About six months later I was walking down the hallway
in the house by myself when I heard someone whisper my name. Out of normal
reaction I said,"what?!" when no one said anything back I remembered that
I was home alone. It scared the crap outta me, so ran to the couch and
waited for three hours for my mother to get home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever sence than I haven't had any more problems
outta ghosts, but at least once in awhile I do see or hear them, but I
truely think that when they said my name...they were saying good-bye.</b>

<p><b>In this home, many different things happened. For instance, one night
I had my sister and her children staying with me. I turned to something
which i thought was one of the children. As I looked there was a small
child reaching out to me. I told the child to go back to bed, but she did
not leave. She continued to stretch out her hands to me. at this time,
i became somewhat scared when i realized that the small child was not any
of the children at my house that evening. i backed away from her. At the
same time that this transpired, my neice came to me and told me that she
had been lying on the living room floor staring at a large man in a black
suit, that of which had come into our back door. She said that she watched
him for a long while, too scared to scream. He too disappeared. I am unsure
as to what had previously taken place in that home, but I do know that
it is exceptionally haunted.</b>

<p><b>My Uncles Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Sfivepearces@wmconnect.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;A couple of days ago I set out to go visit my aunt with my
cousin (let's call her Jan) and my grandmother.We were having a "hen party"
which is our name for a gathering of females in our family during which
we chat,eat and drink.I had forgotten about this until my cousin "Jan"
brought it up later on in the evening.</b>
<br><b>When "Jan" was about 14 ,her family added on to their house.They
purchased a</b>
<br><b>trailer from a family in our area.It had been rumored that the people
who originally owned the trailer were into some really odd practices.The
add-on was placed at the back of the house and contained a bathroom and
my cousin Jan's bedroom and her younger brother "Jack's" room.</b>
<br><b>I was very young at this time and all I can remember is that I felt
uneasy in this part of the house and never wanted to be alone there.My
brothers and Jan's brother Jack were very close and I can't remember them
ever once staying the night with Jack.In fact,after a while my cousin Jack
refused to stay the night in that room and I don't think he ever did again,not
even in his teen years.When I was very young we would all gather under
a table with a blanket over it and tell spooky stories.Looking back,Jack's
contributions were not fitting to "child's play".The playfulness in his
voice when he told us stories rang false.</b>
<br><b>During that evening of the "hen party",Jan recalled being bone chillingly
afraid of</b>
<br><b>w/e was back there.At almost 30 years old,she still recalls the
unsettling fear that</b>
<br><b>plagued her in that part of the house.Most of the time,she recalls,it
was foot steps that would follow her in the hall,they would stop when she
stopped and start again when she did.She never dared to look behind her.Even
at 17 years old she would run full speed to her room,tag the light as she
flew by and jump under the covers.</b>
<br><b>She used to have a little dog that slept on the end of her bed.She
woke up in the middle of the night at one time and the little dog did too.The
little dog stood at the end of her bed,all the hair on his back stood straight
up,and he stared out into the&nbsp; empty hall and growled ferociously.Not
long afterward,the dog was discovered,laying dead in a ditch near her home.</b>
<br><b>Years later,when she had already moved out on her own,an odd incident
occurred</b>
<br><b>during a visit home.Her boyfriend,who is now her husband,came with
her and spent the night in "Jack's" old room.He had always flat out disbelieved
in ghosts,hauntings,etc.He went to sleep that night and woke up later to
the sound of someone calling him by his name and laughing.Everyone in the
house was asleep.He went to where Jan was sleeping and told her that he
was absolutely not leaving her sight for the rest of the night.</b>
<br><b>When she was a teenager she refused to say anything about it to
her parents because,being 14 and older,she had always tried to rationalize
it to herself.Now,years later,even her father who is a Christian school
principle admits he had always felt "something" in that part of the house.Noone
who has felt it has ever reported it as a "pleasant" or "indifferent" feeling.</b>
<br><b>Jan's mother unfortunately passed away.Her father remarried a woman
who has a daughter who was about 15 at the time.They all moved in and her
daughter was given Jan's old room.I heard her daughter telling someone
about how she had been alone in the house at one time and heard hard,running
foot steps come through the house.She assumed it was her stepbrother,Jan
and Jack's younger brother,and that he had come home early from a church
member's house warming party he had attended with his stepmother.She looked
all through the house and when she didn't find him she though maybe he
had gone as quickly as he came home and set out to my grandmother's house
who lived very near.She decided to call her mother at the church member's
party and asked her if her stepbrother had decided to come home.Her mother
seemed a bit confused and told her,"No.He's right here with me."</b>
<br><b>The house has now been torn down(not in relation to any of the above
incidents) and the family bought a new house to put on the same plot of
land.No more incidents reported.</b>

<br><b>My Pop's Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: TwitchnItch420@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I have always been very interested in ghost and the supernatural,
and I love to tell my experiences every chance I get.&nbsp; I was about
14 and I was staying with my grandparents in Port Norris, NJ for the summer.
They lived on a very deserted area there were only two houses on there
raod&nbsp; my great grandparents lived in the other house untill they died
and left it to my&nbsp; poppop shortly after my greatgrandpa died my aunt
moved into the house she told me that she saw nina and pop (thats what
I called my great grandparents) quite a few times, she said that if she
slept with her light on my pop would come and turn it off in the middle
of the night my aunt lived alone so it couldnt have been anyone else. He
would also cover her up if she fell asleep with no covers and if she went
to work or left for the day when she'd come home the dog would be out side
it would be impossible for the dog to get out on its own with all the windows
shut and the doors locked. Even though I beleived in ghost I was a Little
bit skeptical, untill i spent the night at the house my aunt wanted to
show me that she wasnt crazy so I slept in her room with her and we left
every light in the house on I woke up in the middle of the night my aunt
was fast asleep and sure enough every light was turned off. i stayed for
the week and I was at the house alone I was making a pie i left it in the
oven to take a quick shower and when I got out the oven was off and the
pie was cooling on the window sill. About a week or so later me and my
poppop got in a fight and i ran down to my aunts house it was very dark
and I was really scared I strarted banging on her door but i knew she'd
never hear me her door was at the back of the house when suddenly the door
swung open I looked in and saw a dark shadowy figure that strangely reminded
me of my pop I ran to my aunts room quickly and told her what happend it's
pretty clear to us that my nina and pop are watching over us and the house.</b>
<br><b>My mom also had a more chilling experience when she was a child
and lived in the house with my grandpop my nina and pop were alive at the
time and lived down the road in there house. My mom must have been ten
or eleven at the time she was asleep in her room wich was right by the
kitchen when she started hearing all the cabinets open and close she saw
the light from the fridge going on and off the back door started to open
and close by then my grandparents had woken up and came out to see what
was going on all the doors stoped moving when they came out so they went
back to bed and my mom slept with them that night the next night mom was
back in her room she slept in a bunk bed on the bottom my aunt slept on
the top when she saw a misty black orb float into the room from the kitchen
and slide up the foot of the bed onto the top bunk when she herd my aunt
scream and the figure flew out of the room. the next night they told my
greatgrandparents what happend and they all sat in the kitchen and prayed
for the spirit to leave after that nothing strange like that ever happend
again.</b><b></b>

Looks...</b>
<br><b>First...I'm A 19 Year Old Girl, Named Jodi.&nbsp; I Am From Baltimore,
MD, But I've Only Lived Here For About 5 Months, Now.&nbsp; I Moved Here
To Be With My Bf.&nbsp; I Used To Live In Southern Lancaster County, Pennsylvania,
Where My Parents And 16 Yr. Old Brother Still Live.</b>
<br><b>Well..When I Was Growing Up, I Spent Alot Of Time Over At My Grandparents
House, In Oxford, PA, While My Parents Were At Work.&nbsp; I Was VERY Close
To My Grandfather.&nbsp; He Was My Best Friend When I Was Younger, And
I Remember Always Sitting On His Lap to Watch A Movie, Or Wasting Lazy
Summer Days Away Just Swinging In The Hammock In The Backyard.&nbsp; I
Loved Being With My Grandfather...He Was My Best Friend.</b>
<br><b>My Grandfather Passed Away When I Was 12 Years Old.&nbsp; BUT..I
Knew When He Died.&nbsp; I Was At My Parents House, And I Was Asleep In
My Room When I Had What I'm Assuming Was A Dream?&nbsp; My Grandfather
Came To Me And Said "This Is Something I Have To Do, Please Don't Be Mad,
I Have To Do This, But I'll See You Soon".&nbsp; I Had No Idea What He
Meant, And Repeatedly Asked Him What He Was Talking About.&nbsp; He Kept
Saying "I Have To Do This, This Is Something I Have To Do.&nbsp; Don't
Be Mad, I'm Sorry, I Love You, I'll See You Soon"..&nbsp; At Some Point
The Dream Just Ended..I'm Not Sure Exactly How Or When Because The Only
Parts I Remember Is When My Grandfather Was Talking To Me, But The Next
Morning When I Came Downstairs, I Knew Something Was Wrong By The Way Everyone
Looked And Was Acting.</b>
<br><b>I Was Still pretty Shaken Up About My Dream, And Asked My Dad (My
Pop-pop Was His Father) "Is Something Wrong With Pop-pop?", And I Remember
The Look In My Mom's Eyes As My Dad Broke Down And Told Me That He Had
Passed Away The Previous Night In His Sleep.&nbsp; I Didn't Say Anything
To Them About My Dream Because I Figured They Wouldn't Have Believed Me,
And Because I Didn't Want To Make Things Worse Than They Already Were.&nbsp;
I Have Since Then Told My Parents About The Dream I Had, And To My Surprise
They Believed Me, And Told Me That He Came To Me To Say Good-bye, And To
Try To Help Me Understand That It Was His Time To Go.</b>
<br><b>Now, Just This Past Year (I Was 18), I Was In A Turkey Hill (Conv.
Store) And I Was Bending Down To Pick Up A Gallon Of Iced Tea When I Heard
A Male Voice Say "Hey, Girl, Long Time No See!".&nbsp; I Stood Back Up,
And Turned Around, And I Swear My Grandfather Was Standing Right Next To
Me With A Big Smile On His Face.&nbsp; I Was Extremely Shocked And Dropped
The Iced Tea I Was Holding, Which Promptly Broke Open On The Floor, And
Spilled Out Everywhere.&nbsp; When I Looked Back Up, My Grandfather Was
Gone.&nbsp; I Didn't Know What To Do, So I Just Stepped Over The Spilled
Tea, And Walked Out To My Car, And Sat There And Tried To Figure What Had
Just Happened To Me In The Store. I Thought For Sure I Was Going Crazy.&nbsp;
I Must Have Sat In My Car And Cried In That Parking Lot For An Hour, Until
The Clerk Came Out To Ask Me If I Was Ok.&nbsp; I Said "Yes" And Drove
Home.</b>
<br><b>I REALLY Contemplated Telling Anyone About This, Until A Few Weeks
Later, My Brother, Brian, Who Was 15 And Worked At Burger King At The Time,
Came To Me One Night Before We Went To Sleep, Looking Embarrassed, Said
"Jod, I Have Something To Tell You, But You Have To Promise You Won't Laugh".</b>
<br><b>I Promised Him I Wouldn't, And He Preceeded To Tell Me That A Few
Days Earlier, He (And I Quote) "Was At Work Taking Orders At The Counter,
When A Guy Who Looked EXACTLY Like Pop-pop Came In.&nbsp; HE LOOKED IDENTICAL
TO POP-POP, JODI!&nbsp; He Came To The Counter And Said "Hey Brian, What's
Up?".&nbsp; I Didn't Know What To Say, And I Just Stood There And Looked
At Him. And I Didn't Have My Nametag On So There Is No Way He Could Have
Known My Name If It Wasn't Him...I Know It Was Pop-pop.&nbsp; I Don't Even
Remember If He Ordered Anything, I Just Remember That He Winked At Me,
And Went Into The Dining Room And Was Just Gone.&nbsp; I Don't Know If
He Walked Out The Door or Not.&nbsp; I Saw Him, Jodi, I Swear I Saw Him.
You Believe Me, Right?"</b>
<br><b>I Was Quite Shocked, And I Told Him I Believed Him Completely And
Told Him About How I Had Seen Pop-pop At The Turkey Hill.&nbsp; We Decided
To Tell My Parents The Next Day, And Found Out That My Dad Had Also Seen
Him.</b>
<br><b>My Dad Was Grocery Shopping, And Was In Line Ready To Write A Check
To Pay For The Groceries, When He Looked Out The Front Windows Of The Store,
And Saw Pop-pop Standing Outside The Window.&nbsp; He Said Pop-pop Smiled
And Waved At Him.&nbsp; My Dad Said He Said "Thats My Dad!" And Ran Outside,
Leaving His Checkbook And Groceries At The Checkout Line, But When He Got
Outside, Pop-pop Was Gone.&nbsp; He Said He Felt So Stupid Because Everyone
Looked At Him Like He Was Crazy. It Upset Him So Badly That He Just Sat
Out On The Porch For A Few Days. He Said That He Doubted Seeing Pop-pop
At All, Until My Brother And I Came To Him And Told Him How We Had Also
Seen Pop-pop.&nbsp; My Mother Has Yet To See Him.</b>
<br><b>It May Be Hard For You To Believe...But It Meant So Much To Me To
Know That Those Times We Saw Him, He Was Checking Up On Us.&nbsp; It's
Extremely Hard For Me Not To Cry Right Now, Because Writing This Really
Brings Back That Day He Came To Me In The Store, Just To Say "Hi".&nbsp;
I Miss My Grandfather Extremely Badly, But I Believe That Because He Came
Back To See Us, That He Is Happy And Doing Good.</b>
<br><b>If This Whole Thing Sounds Far Fetched, I'm Sorry...And I Wouldn't
Really Consider It A "Ghost Story", But You Can Take It For What Its Worth.</b>
<br><b>Do You Have Any Ideas On This Whole Thing? Is This Something That
Happens To Alot Of People?&nbsp; Or Possibly You Have Some Ideas On How
I Could See Him Again?</b><b></b>

<p><b>Evil Dog</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dubious4576@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was young, i beleive I was 5, we just moved</b>
<br><b>into our new (and still current) house.&nbsp; It was all</b>
<br><b>nice and fine for a couple weeks until I started to</b>
<br><b>hear noises late at night.&nbsp; It started with me hearing</b>
<br><b>the downstairs T.V. on even though everyone was</b>
<br><b>already upstairs and fast asleep.&nbsp; I would check by</b>
<br><b>looking down my stairs to see if there was any light</b>
<br><b>coming from my television.&nbsp; When I did there was no</b>
<br><b>light and the noise stoped.&nbsp; Then noises like</b>
<br><b>something was running up and down my stairs started to</b>
<br><b>occur.&nbsp; My room is right next to the staircase and</b>
<br><b>from my bed i am able to see the top of the staircase.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Even though I heard the sounds I never saw anything</b>
<br><b>come to the top and go back down.&nbsp; Only heard it.</b>
<br><b>Then it started to really trouble me.&nbsp; One night as i</b>
<br><b>was lieing in my bed, I heard the panting of a dog and</b>
<br><b>the scratching of its feet on the downstairs tile.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>sounded if it was coming upstairs.&nbsp; I listend to the</b>
<br><b>sound of it coming up the stairs but never saw</b>
<br><b>snything.&nbsp; Then that same night the nightmares began.</b>
<br><b>Every night I heard these sounds of the dog I would</b>
<br><b>have a nightmare where I was somewhere. Not always the</b>
<br><b>same place, But there would be a black dog.&nbsp; This dog</b>
<br><b>would be some distance from me walking by then stop.</b>
<br><b>It would turn to look at me and its eye were a blood</b>
<br><b>red.&nbsp; At that instant the dog would charge me and</b>
<br><b>knock me over and rip out my throat.&nbsp; But these</b>
<br><b>nighmares only happend when I heard this dog roaming</b>
<br><b>my house and this was not every night.&nbsp;&nbsp; But then all</b>
<br><b>it once it seemed to stop.&nbsp; We got a new puppy and</b>
<br><b>after we did that this deamon dog never returned.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>never heard the T.V. on, I never heard things running</b>
<br><b>up and down my stairs, and i never heard or dreamed of</b>
<br><b>that dog agian.&nbsp; I havn't told anybody of this because</b>
<br><b>I was in no danger.&nbsp; But if this ever starts up agian,</b>
<br><b>I want to face this evil dog that was tormenting me in person.</b><b></b>

<p><b>About Reeds Furnace in Pennslyvaina</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ChuckysGal1975@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>"It's about 10 mins from the town I live in - Grove City, PA. I've
been there a few times (Reed's Furnace that is) and strange things have
happened. As you turn onto the rocky path/road that says "No winter maintenance,"
you will find yourself going along a LONG bumpy path until all of a sudden
you don't see any houses or fields and you are driving down this narrow
rocky hill with cliffs that are literally 200 feet high on both sides of
you! Everything becomes VERY still...you will notice that not one leaf
is moving on any of the trees and it's considerably darker! When you finally
reach the unofficial location that they call "Reed's Furnace," you will
find yourself going between 2 hills that lead up to paths where rail road
tracks used to run. Over these 2 hills lied a bridge which has long been
gone. After you pass this location where the bridge used to be if you go
about 10yds you will find a parking lot, sort of, with rocks along the
front so that you don't drive into the creek just ahead. This parking lot
was put in for the hunters that have tree stands back there. Once you get
to the parking lot you will notice a trail going back that starts on the
right side of the lot...don't bother going back here for it only goes back
to an old bridge with detereorating wood that you would probably fall through
if you attempted to walk across it. Instead, you want to walk across the
creek and try to find Reed's auctual furnace which I have NEVER found...believe
me...I have looked EVERYWHERE for the remains for they say that the bones
of the children - not dogs or employees - that he used to rape and then
burn still remain, as well as his spirit. Going back to the bridge that
used to be there...a little girl was hit by a train that was running from
Reed on the bridge. I have seen her multiple times. One time as I was leaving
I looked up the right hill path and saw her standing on a mound of dirt.
Another time as I was driving away I saw her sitting where the bridge would
have been with her feet dangling over. She looks to be about 10 to 12 years
of age and she is wearing a white/pink colored dress. As for Reed...well...if
you ever find him or his furnace I'd be dying to know what happened or
what you saw. Seeing the little girl is an experience in it's own."</b>
