<P><B>THE WAVING BEAR</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  Spyro0123@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>    I am fourteen years old and if my spelling is bad, please excuse
it.</B>
<P><B>When I was about two my family lived in an old house that was probably
built </B>
<P><B>around the 1890's. like you, I was somewhat ghost prone. I would see
ghosts</B>
<P><B>of men with loin cloths on, walking through the halls at night.sometimes
they </B>
<P><B>would just sit on the ground and sing songs to me. How I am sure
happened</B>
<P><B>was because after a while I started to sing the songs, which my
father</B>
<P><B>recognized and showed my grandma who was part native american(which
kind I am not so </B>
<P><B>sure.)and she told me that I was singing about life and love. My family
</B>
<P><B>believed the ghosts were real because of this. Before I was old enough
to</B>
<P><B>ask her to translate it to me, she died of old age when I was ten.</B>
<P><B>    I think there were also demonic creatures dwelling there as well.
When I </B>
<P><B>was six and sharing a room with my sister, I would see a black figure,
with </B>
<P><B>red eyes looking at me from under my bed as I was getting up at night
to go </B>
<P><B>to the bathroom. so I would just go on my sisters bed, wake her up
and sleep </B>
<P><B>with her the rest of the night under the covers. Every day I would
get woken </B>
<P><B>up by getting punched in the face. After a while my parents started
noticing </B>
<P><B>bruises.They thought it was my sister until I convinced them it wasn't.
The </B>
<P><B>demon was getting more violent as the days went on. One night as I
was </B>
<P><B>wrestling with my sister, I felt something grab my back and push me.
We fell </B>
<P><B>out the window.(good thing it was a two story house.)I got a deep slice
in</B>
<P><B>my thigh. My parents decided to move the next day and that night when
I came</B>
<P><B>home from the hospital. I just couldnt got to sleep.All of the sudden
I saw a</B>
<P><B>white stuffed bear waving to me.When I started to try and wake up my</B>
<P><B>sister,another bear nodded its head no. My sister woke up and saw it
just in time.The next </B>
<P><B>two weeks I moved out and never saw another ghost again. and to this
day me </B>
<P><B>and my sister have no reccolection of what happened after we saw the
stuffed </B>
<P><B>animals waving. All I remember is waking my sister up and me and her
</B>
<P><B>screaming.  If you know what any of this means , or any story related
to </B>
<P><B>this please send me them. I know Im only a kid but it would help me
to know </B>
<P><B>that im the only one.</B>

<P><B>White Figure</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: cronin@fas.harvard.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>Myself and a friend recently moved into a house in Belmont,MA right
outside</B>
<P><B>of Boston.  The place is about 100 years old and retains much of the</B>
<P><B>original woodwork, ceramic doorknobs etc.  I even found a few old
ceramic</B>
<P><B>liquor and mead bottles in there.  It's a third floor apartment with
an old</B>
<P><B>aluminum speaking tube to the second floor, which leads us to believe
this</B>
<P><B>may have been servants quarters at one time.  We never get anything
but</B>
<P><B>good vibes from the place but a few things have happened which make
me</B>
<P><B>wonder, and I write asking your opinion.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Firstly, the former tenant was an elderly alchoholic who according
to the</B>
<P><B>landlord used to heat only one room in the house, the dining room,
with a</B>
<P><B>space heater.  She "kept the whole place closed up" according to Mrs</B>
<P><B>Richardson, who also tells us the former tenant didn't die but moved
to a</B>
<P><B>nursing home.  (We aren't sure if we believe her)  Well that room seems
to</B>
<P><B>have a door problem- often when I return from work, all three doors
to the</B>
<P><B>room will be slammed shut- even the one which is tied open with a
string.</B>
<P><B>These are doors which don't close easily, being old and paint-covered
and</B>
<P><B>warped a bit.  While we hang out, sometimes doors slam.  It happens
in fits</B>
<P><B>and starts; one week it happened every day but it hasn't happened for
a</B>
<P><B>while.  Granted there is a breeze in that room, but the manner in which
it</B>
<P><B>happens strikes one as odd sometimes.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Also, we have both seen a white figure in a long dress and perhaps
a veil,</B>
<P><B>always in the hallway into our place or in the doorway of the dining
room.</B>
<P><B>It is a peripheral vision thing which leaves when looked at directly.
 I've</B>
<P><B>seen it standing in the door several times and I saw it seemingly
walking</B>
<P><B>down the hall once.  It kind of bounced up and down like a person
would</B>
<P><B>were they walking.  Mike tells me he usually sees it moving past the
door,</B>
<P><B>either coming into or exiting the apartment, and he has used the
words</B>
<P><B>"wedding dress" to describe it's clothing.  I didn't get that detailed
a</B>
<P><B>look but have definitely seen the shape.  Visitors have seen a
similar</B>
<P><B>shape but hesitate to call it a ghost.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Lastly-and this is not so much an experience as a creepy
coincidence-when</B>
<P><B>first repainting the place we decided to do the kitchen in blue and
white.</B>
<P><B>I proposed that we paint only the panels on the kitchen doors blue
(we</B>
<P><B>haven't done this yet) which both of us thought was a good idea.
 Later,</B>
<P><B>when exploring the basement for the first time, I found an ancient
door of</B>
<P><B>the same style as our other doors, removed from the hinges and
brought</B>
<P><B>downstairs years before.  It seems to be the one door from our
apartment</B>
<P><B>which was been taken off the hinges- the kitchen door.  And the panels
were</B>
<P><B>painted years ago in cracked blue paint.</B>

<P><B>  Whaley House Experience</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: O2VENTIDTC@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> Yesterday my husband and I toured the Whaley House in San Diego. I
think I may have been present</B>
<P><B>to a supernatural experience of sorts but I wanted to ask you about
it. Initially I started out</B>
<P><B>on the first floor (not part of the tour) and I felt a markedly weird
sensation in front of the </B>
<P><B>dining area that I can only describe it as having a sinking feeling
that boardered on nausea.</B>
<P><B>( I felt fine walking around Old Town and coming into the house.) I
just sort of hung out in </B>
<P><B>front of the dining area for like 10 minutes thinking that  what I
was  feeling was unusual and</B>
<P><B>it disipated .I  felt fine again so I looked around the rest of the
house and felt ok until I </B>
<P><B>came to the first upstairs bedroom directly right of the stairs. I
again felt that same feeling </B>
<P><B>and I stood there just looking about the room and that is when I think
I saw something in one of</B>
<P><B> the mirrors (the mirror closest to the hall). It looked as though
thin white smoke was being </B>
<P><B>reflected into the mirror as though someone was standing next to the
mirror with a lit cigarette </B>
<P><B>. I can only describe what I saw as smoke because it curled. I also
smelled a very faint smell </B>
<P><B>of cologne that reminded me of violet water. I made sure it was not
me since I was the only </B>
<P><B>person in that area and it wasn't.It seemed to blow in through the
 slatted wooden partition . I</B>
<P><B> was a little weirded out because I was in disbelief at what I might
be witnessing so I called to</B>
<P><B> my husband downstairs to come up . I didn't want to cause a stir because
I was unsure what this</B>
<P><B> was. I walked back to the area in front of the room and looked back
into the mirror to make sure</B>
<P><B> that it wasn't a reflection of something outside like a passing vehicle
but I no longer saw the</B>
<P><B> smoke. I didn't want to tell anyone about what I think I saw because
I didn't want to cause a </B>
<P><B>stir  and wind up scaring people including myself. I have been thinking
about it ever since and</B>
<P><B> been trying to find a logical explanation for it. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Voices in the Dark</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: John7057@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I have always been very interested in the subject of ghosts and the
</B>
<P><B>paranormal but never thought I would have a direct experience with
them.  </B>
<P><B>Although, I am currently part of theater group that is renovating an
old </B>
<P><B>theater and we defintely have some specteral energy in the place, but
that's </B>
<P><B>another story.  This story is about the first time I had something
"strange" </B>
<P><B>happen to me.  I am originally from a small island off the coast of
Italy.  </B>
<P><B>The community dates back to 700 B.C., so you can imagine they have
their</B>
<P><B>fair share of ghosts stories.  I was 15 and staying at my aunt's house
with my </B>
<P><B>sister.  Our grandmother had died 3 years before and as part our week
long </B>
<P><B>stay, we went to visit her grave.  The experience was unsettling to
say the </B>
<P><B>least and I think I was the most affected emotionally by the visit.
 Trying </B>
<P><B>to remember a woman who I loved very much now reduced to nothing but
a </B>
<P><B>picture and writing on marble mausoleum.  Although it was a very hot
and </B>
<P><B>humid summer day,  the cemetary seemed to have an unsettling chill
about it </B>
<P><B>and I couldn't wait to get out of there.  However, anyone who is Italian
or </B>
<P><B>knows of Italian cemetary visits is that they are family events that
take a </B>
<P><B>long time.  Feeling very sentimental and depressed and somewhat bored
I </B>
<P><B>couldn't help but look around and read more grave sites.  With each
name and </B>
<P><B>picture that I saw, I thought more about the people behind them.
 Their</B>
<P><B>lives and who they must have been.  The atmosphere seemed more oppressive
and I </B>
<P><B>started seeing flashes out of the corner of my eyes.  Nothing definite
but</B>
<P><B>it was almost as if something had passed in front of me very quickly
and the </B>
<P><B>experience left me somewhat disturbed.  We left not long after, much
to my </B>
<P><B>relief, but still with this heavy, depressed feeling.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Later on that night I had fallen into a deep sleep but was awaken at
3:00 in </B>
<P><B>the morning by a male and a female voice arguing.  I was very groggy
but I </B>
<P><B>immediately thought the voices were strange because they didn't sound
like </B>
<P><B>they were coming from anywhere. in particular.  They sounded as if
they were </B>
<P><B>right in my ears.  The room I shared with my sister was directly over
a busy </B>
<P><B>main street and being a summer resort there always some activity going
on.  </B>
<P><B>However, the street this night was totally quiet with no one in sight.
 The </B>
<P><B>voices continued to argue in Italian and though I spoke it, I couldn't
make </B>
<P><B>out what they were saying.  Also the intensity of the voices didn't
change</B>
<P><B>as I moved around the room.  They always seemed to be in my ears and
were </B>
<P><B>continuing to grow in intensity.  At this point I thought it was my
cousin </B>
<P><B>and her husband were arguing from their bedroom.  They shared the room
with </B>
<P><B>their two small children and I thought what could be so important to
be </B>
<P><B>arguing at this hour of night and why weren't their children reacting.
 I </B>
<P><B>decided to investigate and as I slowly opend the door the voices suddenly
</B>
<P><B>stopped.  Not a cut off in conversation or a conclusion but as if
someone</B>
<P><B>had switched off a radio.  I walked to their room and found the whole
family </B>
<P><B>sound asleep.  I returned to the room dumbfounded but found the room
to very </B>
<P><B>cold.  The day had been extremely hot and the night had not let up
and I was </B>
<P><B>just in the room a minute before but the I knew the tempreature had
gone</B>
<P><B>down at least ten degrees.  It was then I felt the same heaviness that
I had </B>
<P><B>experienced at the cemetary and a large chill moved right through me.</B>
<P><B>Almost immediately the room returned to its original temperature. 
</B>
<P>
<P><B>During this whole experience my sister was asleep next to me and when
I</B>
<P><B>asked her about hearing anything during the night she thought I was
crazy.  To</B>
<P><B>this day I'm not sure what I heard and felt that night.  However, I
have spent </B>
<P><B>many nights in that room over the years and never had a similar experience.
 </B>
<P><B>Did I "touch" something or someone and did they follow me back from
the </B>
<P><B>cemetary, I don't know...    </B>
<P>
<P><B>Visits From My Sister??</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: CHAMIMARIE@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have been having vivid dreams of my sister (Murdered 7.31.97 )</B>
<P><B>and in one in particular she is standing over my bed telling me to
lock the </B>
<P><B>windows and doors, before I go to bed at night, I usually keep them
open, it </B>
<P><B>is as if I am not quite awake or asleep when she tells me this, and
I have </B>
<P><B>been getting up to make sure they are locked.  What do you think? </B>
<P>
<P><B>I have also been smelling perfume, when I am alone, and I do not usually
</B>
<P><B>where any myself.</B>
<P><B>Not to mention all the other strange things that are going on with
myself</B>
<P><B>and </B>
<P><B>my daughter, she has also seen my sister in her room, </B>
<P>
<P><B>Right before I fall asleep at night, I sense someone is there watching
me, ( </B>
<P><B>last week) I turned over to the bathroom vanity, and thought I saw
a blurry </B>
<P><B>shadow, could this be my imagination? </B>
<P>
<P><B>The night my sister was murdered, I got very sick with a high fever,
that </B>
<P><B>night my dog started barking at the wall, at that moment the wind chimes
in </B>
<P><B>my house started chiming (the ac was not on, windows closed ).</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Violent One</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  nana@intsvc.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>There are 2 ghosts in my apartment. This complex was built in 1980.
The couple tnat lived in my </B>
<P><B>apt. moved in when it was first built. In Jan.1998, their daughter
made them move out of the </B>
<P><B>complex, and live with her. We moved in in Feb. of 1998. About five
months ago, my husband and I</B>
<P><B> started to hear two people talking in my dining area after we went
to bed. The voices belonged</B>
<P><B> to a man and a women. We noticed that the drawers to a small chest
of dawers in the bathroom </B>
<P><B>were open and items scattered on the floor. My combs and brushes wold
be moved to a spot other </B>
<P><B>than where I had placed them. The doors to my kitchen cabinets would
also be open. During the </B>
<P><B>last 2 months, the male ghost has become violent towards me. He has
crawled into my bed, and his</B>
<P><B> face is ashen and wrinkled. All he does is count to 10. Shortly after
that he tried to pull me </B>
<P><B>from my bed and pull me to the patio door. My husband was using the
computor in the living room </B>
<P><B>one night and the male ghost moved the covers of my husband's bed.
He also moves th small fan in</B>
<P><B> the bedroom back and forth. Two weeks ago, I saw a figure standing
in my bedroom door, waring </B>
<P><B>brown clothes. Since then, each night, before I get into bed, I have
to tell this ghost to leave</B>
<P><B>. I wish he would just leave and not come back.</B>

<P><B>The Scariest Experience </B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Orange6999@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have a big blue candle that I keep on my vanity. Ok and it wasn't
lit.Well I got up to go to </B>
<P><B>the bathroom around 4 in the morning. When I came back in my room,
my blue candle was lit. I know</B>
<P><B>for a fact that I wasnt dreaming and noone was playing a trick on me
cuz everyone was asleep. </B>
<P><B>Well when I got up to the nerve to go blow out the candle, I had the
scare of my life...on the</B>
<P><B>wall above the candle...there was a very faint vision of a clown face,
well I quickly blew out </B>
<P><B>the candle and grabbed my cat and hit under the covers that night.it
was really scary.</B>
<P><B>Believe me,this happened!!!!</B>

<P>
<P><B>The Old Green House </B>
<P>
<P><B>By: EJGaddis@webtv.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>  Thirteen years ago my Mom and I moved into a nice home that was
owned</B>
<P><B>by her boss who was also the land lord. In the first week of living</B>
<P><B>there the landlord and my Mom where talking about the house and the</B>
<P><B>landlord brought up that the house was haunted by two spirits her son</B>
<P><B>who hung himself across the street over a bout of depression and her</B>
<P><B>best friend for years who would come and baby sit her kids and also
died</B>
<P><B>on the way to her house to baby sit the kids.Well we had lived in the</B>
<P><B>house for some time and there wasn't any strange things going on till
we</B>
<P><B>had our friends move in with us and I guess the spirits got real</B>
<P><B>angry.One morning my Mom's friend was mad and said who ever was
turning</B>
<P><B>the lamps on and off last night should stop we all had done nothing
we</B>
<P><B>where asleep in our beds so we couldn't of done any thing.Sense then</B>
<P><B>there was a bad filling around the house we didn't want to be left
alone</B>
<P><B>atleast at night some times I would have my hairs on the back of my
neck</B>
<P><B>stand on end and find my self looking over my shoulder very</B>
<P><B>disturbing.Then one day it all came to a head my Mom came home from
work</B>
<P><B>and was very tired so she went up to bed she layed down and almost
fell</B>
<P><B>asleep when something in the attic started to make stomping sounds
like</B>
<P><B>big men in the attic in a fight she also heard thing being thrown
around</B>
<P><B>at the same time and this was too loud to be racoons or a bird so she</B>
<P><B>got up in a panic ran out of the house got in her car and left what
ever</B>
<P><B>it was it scared my mother real bad and it wanted her out of the
house</B>
<P><B>and succeeded in doing that quite well.We had finally got tired of
the</B>
<P><B>noises and bad filling of some one watching us and got the Bible out
and</B>
<P><B>did what my Mom calls cleaning the house and we did it together first
we</B>
<P><B>had a prayer to God to help us get read of the spirits then we walked</B>
<P><B>through the house from bottom to top all the rooms and all the
closets</B>
<P><B>we read the Bible and rebuked the spirits to leave in the name of God</B>
<P><B>and Jesus Christ telling them to never return to our house ever
again.</B>
<P><B>After that day we felt peace and serenity in the home no noises the</B>
<P><B>lamps quite going off and on and it stayed that way.So if any one
reads</B>
<P><B>this the Bible is the perfect tool to getting read of unwanted unseen</B>
<P><B>tenants out of a home and it is very affective and usually last the</B>
<P><B>power of God can not be argued with by a spirit when God comes into
the</B>
<P><B>picture.</B>

<P><B>The Old Cavalier Hotel</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: ccoates@pilot.infi.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I'm from Virginia Beach, Va. I worked at the Cavalier hotel at various
jobs, including           laborer , accounting and carpet laying.</B>
<P><B>It was when I was a laborer that I had my one and only encounter of
my life so far.</B>
<P><B>It was 4:00 pm and work was over at the old cavalier (there are two
cavalier hotels, the new one</B>
<P><B>was built in 1971.  The old one was built in 1927. And has numerous
ghost stories</B>
<P><B>attached to it.) We had been demolishing rooms on the third floor for</B>
<P><B>renovation.Really dirty work. My boss asked me to check out  a couple
of rooms for laying carpet </B>
<P><B>as I was about to make the transition from laborer to carpet layer.</B>
<P><B>The hotel was open ,we just had two of six floors out of service. So
there were people in the </B>
<P><B>hotel, but not on the floor  I was on.</B>
<P><B>I went into a room , it was stripped of everything .Ready for contruction.
To my left was where</B>
<P><B>the two double beds  would be and there was a piece of plywood up against
the</B>
<P><B>wall there a full sheet standing length wise,no big deal.  I continued
into the room and turned</B>
<P><B>right into the bathroom and looked up at the ceiling it had been removed
because it was damaged </B>
<P><B>and some of the debree was still on the floor . I remember thinking
" I got to clean this up </B>
<P><B>before  I start work tomorow." my back was to the door . When  I turned
around to leave the </B>
<P><B>bathroom my heart came up  in my throat instantly. The piece of plywood
that was to my left as I</B>
<P><B>walked through the room was now propped up against the bathroom door
in front of me. I pushed </B>
<P><B>it down and RAN out of the room , down the hall ,down the stairs  and
outside I turned around </B>
<P><B>and looked at the hotel ,just stood ther for a momment , before getting
in my car and  leaving. </B>
<P><B>I think I told a few people , but who's going to believe that story.
IT HAPPEND.</B>

<P><B>The Man in the Basement</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: PunkinTim@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a bit long but is entirely true. I was 13 and home alone. 
Not that </B>
<P><B>this was any big deal, but the house i grew up in was huge and scary.
 My </B>
<P><B>fathers' workshop was in the basement located directly under the
family</B>
<P><B>room. </B>
<P><B> It was around 8pm and dark outside.  I had finished my homework and
started </B>
<P><B>to watch TV.  I had felt and heard this bumping under my feet.  It
sounded </B>
<P><B>like a thud then a long slow sliding sound had followed.  Forgetting
that I </B>
<P><B>was alone, I thought it was my father storing the kneelers he had salvaged
</B>
<P><B>from a church between the floor joists.  This went on for a few minutes.
 I </B>
<P><B>began to realize that my father was with my mother and older siblings
at an </B>
<P><B>awards banquet and should be home soon.  The bumping continued.  I
was at a </B>
<P><B>loss as to who might be in the basement.  Thinking it might be an older
</B>
<P><B>sibling who came by, I shouted down to them to stop as they were
interfering </B>
<P><B>with the TV reception.  No answer and the bumping still continued.
 I knelt </B>
<P><B>to an area in the floor where a crack between the planking revealed
an </B>
<P><B>overhead view of the workshop area.  I peeked between the planks and
saw a </B>
<P><B>very tall and dark clothed person walking back and forth and continuing
this </B>
<P><B>project.  Not recognizing who this was, I sat up on the couch and tried
to </B>
<P><B>think what would be best to do.  I turned on all the lights.  Not an
easy </B>
<P><B>task as this house was quite large.  At this time, I could hear footsteps
</B>
<P><B>above me in my bedroom and then they started to step down the hallway.
 Well </B>
<P><B>at the end of the hallway upstairs, was the front staircase that landed
</B>
<P><B>behind the couch I was sitting on.  Who ever was up there was starting
to </B>
<P><B>come down and of course they would reach me upon their descent at the
base</B>
<P><B>of the stairs.  I ran out of the house so darn fast and waited outside
in the </B>
<P><B>cold with no jacket or coat.  Didn't have time to grab one.  I remained
in</B>
<P><B>my neighbors front yard across the street in full view of the house
where I </B>
<P><B>could see anyone leaving or walking around inside.  My eyes were fully
fixed </B>
<P><B>on my house as I waited for my parents to come home.  Two hours later
as</B>
<P><B>they pulled into the driveway, my frantic self ran toward them.  I
told my dad </B>
<P><B>someone is in the basement.  He checked and said all the doors to the
</B>
<P><B>basement were locked and how no one could get in.  This is a very old
house </B>
<P><B>and the only way into the basement was from the driveway and a separate
door </B>
<P><B>that ran off of the back porch.  No access from inside the house. 
They had </B>
<P><B>said they would have been home about 2 hours earlier and didn't intend
to </B>
<P><B>stay out so late.  I had asked what took them so long to get home and
they </B>
<P><B>said the wheel on the car had mysteriously come loose and they had
nearly </B>
<P><B>crashed.  My mom of course thought I was nuts with my wild claims.
 I </B>
<P><B>insisted dad go downstairs and check if the kneelers were stacked on
the </B>
<P><B>basement floor.  He came upstairs and out to the driveway with a confused
</B>
<P><B>look on his face and told us that, no, they werent on the floor where
he had </B>
<P><B>left them but were stacked neatly between the floor joists.  We decided
to </B>
<P><B>pray.  This event began many to follow.</B>

<P><B>Haunted Complex</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: nana@intsvc.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>There are 2 ghosts in my apartment.  This complex was built in</B>
<P><B>1980.  The couple tnat lived in my apt.  moved in when it was first</B>
<P><B>built.  In Jan.  1998, their daughter made them move out of the
complex,</B>
<P><B>and live with her.  We moved in in Feb.  of 1998.  About five months
ago,</B>
<P><B>my husband and I started to hear two people talking in my dining area</B>
<P><B>after we went to bed.  The voices belonged to a man and a women.  We</B>
<P><B>noticed that the drawers to a small chest of dawers in the bathroom
were</B>
<P><B>open and items scattered on the floor.  My combs and brushes wold be</B>
<P><B>moved to a spot other than where I had placed them.  The doors to my</B>
<P><B>kitchen cabinets would also be open.  During the last 2 months, the
male</B>
<P><B>ghost has become violent towards me.  He has crawled into my bed, and
his</B>
<P><B>face is ashen and wrinkled.  All he does is count to 10.  Shortly
after</B>
<P><B>that he tried to pull me from my bed and pull me to the patio door.
 My</B>
<P><B>husband was using the computor in the living room one night and the
male</B>
<P><B>ghost moved the covers of my husband's bed.  He also moves th small
fan</B>
<P><B>in the bedroom back and forth.  Two weeks ago, I saw a figure standing
in</B>
<P><B>my bedroom door, waring brown clothes.  Since then, each night, before
I</B>
<P><B>get into bed, I have to tell this ghost to leave.  I wish he would
just</B>
<P><B>leave and not come back.      </B>
