<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi i have another story
about Sarah.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Me and my roommate were
walking to our block when she staired and something in the tree. She looked ver
frightend but i could see anything. She asked me if i could see her aswell but
i said no and asked her what she was talking about. She said there was a girl
wearing black sitting in the tree swinging het legs up and down just stairing
at her. I still couldnt see her but it was obvious that my roommate could see
her cause she was really looking at something. She told me it was looking at
her. I told her to describe what she looked like but she said she couldnt see
her face because it was all blurry. I told her that it must have been her
imagination and i dragged her to out block.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was standing about 2
meters away from the door when my roommate said that 'Sarah' was standing next
to the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I got a bit scared because
it was ver obvious my roommate could see her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">To comfered her i went to
the door and said that she wasnt there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My roommates eyes opened
really wide and she said that 'Sarah's' hand was on my shoulder. I couldnt feel
anything but i got very scared..<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I told my roommate to just
ignore it or tell it to go away but she was to scared too. So i told it to go
away and leave us alone. After that evening my roommate hasnt seen her again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I am scared i was to harsh
on 'Sarah' but she was really scaring us. I hope she is in a peaceful place
now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>My aunt told me that one time when she live in
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Oklahoma</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;"> she found this house for rent. It was a three or
four bedroom house and the rent was only $250 a month. Well, there was a barn
in the back of the house and my aunt went back there to check it out. On the
barn floor there was a circle ( it was some kind of cult sign). The circle was
red. Well, she said that when she met the woman who owned the house, the woman
said that she did not want the house. Well, she did not listen to the woman and
she got the house. when she move into the house with her children she said at
night time she would hear cars pull up and shut off the engine and close the
car door. She also told me when she went to get her utilitys turned on she said
that the company said that there was no adress that registerd there.Well, she
kept on telling them that there was a house there. The company still said there
was no known house there. She still had utilities, but she wanted to put it
under her name. So she never had to pay a utility bill. Well, she would get up
and look out the window<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and no car or
any person(s) were there. Then one day when it got dark she would see two red
glowing eyes in the window. Well, one night when all her kids were in bed and
she was in bed the tv came on. She got up and turned the tv off and just
thought it was a power serge. Well, the tv kept on coming on by it self. So one
night she unpluged the tv and she put the kids to bed and went to bed herself
as usual, and the tv came on. She went in there to turn it off when she
realized that the tv was unplugged and still came on.Well, one of her daughters
got sick and she took her to three doctors and they could not tell her what was
wrong with her daughter. Her daughter stayed sick no matter what they did. The
landlady never would come into the house. She would wait out on the porch for
the rent come rain or shine. Then one night when my aunt was in bed she and her
kids heard this heavy breathing. The kids ran into her room. Well, the dog that
they kept in the house went into the kitchen and had gone strait to the corner
of that kitchen and stood up on its hind legs and started barking at the
ceiling. They always kept a bag hanging on the kitchen door. Well, one night my
aunt heard the bag rattling. She said it sounded like something was going threw
the bag. She didn't get up to check it out. Well, all this time her daughter
was still very sick. When they would want to leave the house their car would
not start. They had to push the car all the way down the road and stick the key
in and it would start right up. She said when she was in that house she felt
like she was being watched all the time. Well, one day they went out and got
home late. My aunt saw this big black shape on the porch. My aunt said it was
shaped like a man with hooves for hands. Well, she got her kids out of that
house as soon as possible. After she moved out her daughter got better in no
time at all. Well, that is the weird haunting. Thanks for every thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I sent you a story yesterday
and decided to share with you a few more experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will ask again that if you do post these
for others to read only to use the email address<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><st1:PersonName><span style="font-family: Arial;">elvisno.1@juno.com</span></st1:PersonName><span style="font-family: Arial;"> in correlation with my story - the email address I
am sending this to you from is a work email- thanks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">These events took place
about 13 to 14 years ago - my Dad was last stationed in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Utah</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;"> before he retired from the military and this is
where I was knowingly introduced to the strangeness of the paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before I graduated high school I worked at an
amusement park during the summer as part of the early morning grounds crew - located
near the back of the park is a replicated town of the first Morman town that
Joseph Smith established (no I am NOT a Morman).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was rumored to be haunted, but of course
no one believed the stories until one morning a few events changed all of our
minds forever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The girls and I were instructed
to head to the picnic area in the replicated town to prepare it for the days'
guests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, none of us were overly
excited to do this area because there wasn't a whole lot of lighting and it
kind of freaked us out after hearing the stories of what people have seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were split into a couple of different
groups so, that way we could hit some of the other areas that needed cleaned
along the way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My group had finished the
area that we were assigned to do and started heading for the poorly lighted
town, when we heard a blood curdling scream.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I right away recognized it
as my friends voice and went running towards the sound of her screams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finally figured out her terrifying screams
were coming from the towns jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I
reached it, two of the girls who had it out for her were holding the door shut
to the jail and she was trapped inside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I just remembered hearing her repeat over and over again, "let me
out or he's going to get me" - I felt the agony she was feeling, pushed
aside the girls and unlatched the door.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My friend came flying out of there running and yelling to me "run,
don't look, just run".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, this
intrigued me and scared both at the same time - I turned my head to look and
ready to run, but I froze, I couldn't move and I couldn't scream - all I could
do was stand there shaking and stare, afraid to even take a breath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What I saw will forever be embedded in my
mind - the jail was a two cell jail with a dirt floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Looking in the door
immediately to your left was the two cells and a small walk way from the door
to the end of the second cell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What I
saw was a translucent small boy crouched in the far corner with his knees drawn
up, his arms wrapped around them and his head buried in between his knees and
chest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was dressed in clothing from
the early 1800's and seemed to be weeping - in the quick few seconds this took
place he lifted his head first staring at the cell in front of him and then
creepily he turned his head and looked at me with a stare that reminded me of
something from a horror movie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once, we
made eye contact, the fear that had frozen me quickly changed into a flight of
survival and I took off running.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Once I caught up with my
friend I asked her who did she saw and to describe the person to me - she did
and it was the boy I had seen weeping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
will never forget my experience with him and I often wonder why was he there,
why was he so sad and did he ever cross over to where he was meant to go or is
he still haunting the jail to this day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We were shook up and stalling
to continue our instructions of cleaning the dreaded picnic area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We knew of course our boss was strict and we
had no choice but to proceed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We kicked
ourselves being responsible and went on our way to do our job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The area located right before you head into
the picnic area is a gorgeous green lawn with old trees and beautiful flowers -
what really is the kicker, smack dab in the middle of all of this is a replica
of the stage they performed the towns' hanging's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What we all saw, prevented us from completing
our job on that day.....there were two ropes tied into loops and perfectly
knotted, ready to do their killing....what we didn't expect is what we saw
hanging there...two somewhat translucent people, once again dressed as the boy
in early 1800"s pioneer clothing, heads bobbing and bodies swinging.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one even thought twice, we just turned,
took one look at each other as we ran like we were running for the gold in the
Olympics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our group leader covered for
us and our boss never did really find out what happened that morning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This experience happened a
little over a month from the last two experiences, but in the same replicated
town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the far end of the town was the
"mayor's" home, the story goes that his daughter on the day of her
wedding was murdered in this home while she was wearing her dress (no one seems
to know why) and if you are lucky enough to catch her at the right time you
will see her step onto her balcony and begin to pace......she only moves back
and forth three times and then vanishes, but if you are close enough and she
doesn't see you, you can hear her sobs and see the blood stains on the front of
her dress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One morning we were taking a
short cut back to our office to clock out from our shift and something caught
our eye, there on the balcony of the house stood the girl in her white wedding
dress crying into her hankie and pacing....then she was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I will never forget the
images that are forever imprinted in my mind and such sadness that the little
town held.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">About a year after we moved
into our new house there was a forest in the back i liked walking in it. One
day i was walking in it i was in the middle of the woods when i thought i saw
something behind me to my right. I turned to look when i saw it was pitched
black, the deepest i had ever seen it did not seem to notice me but kept on
walking until it walked behind a clump of brambles and disappeared. I was very
scared and did not tell anybody about this until now, it was a very frightening
experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When reading the encounter
on your web page I was shocked and somewhat relieved(that we were not
crazy).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Myself along with two
friends that were with me six years ago on that very same road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were coming back very late from the
backwards church on Halloween night, a figure appeared after coming upon a
strange blue/lt purple fog, on the side of the road was someone riding a very
old bike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we approached the figure we
could see he was wearing a dark purple cloak with the hood pulled up so just a
very small portion of what you would expect to see a face would be at, instead
of a face it was a gray fog/mist that had no definition(there was no face), we
were driving by at 25 MPH three feet away from the apparition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not quite sure if this was a real person or
what we decided to find an explanation, we drove down the road found another
road that goes up and around so that we would come up behind him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which we did but this time he was not on the
bike he was pushing the bike and as we came up behind to pass the
apparition/figure/thing the head/shadowy face watched and followed us as we
passed again at a very low rate of speed and only feet away trying to get a
good look, at this point we were determined to see this things face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we ascended the hill to double back there
he was pushing his bike on a completely different road about &frac14; of a mile from
where we had just seen him minutes previous with no other rout except the
entries we were taking besides bush wacking it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At that point we knew what
we had just seen and took off like a bat out of hell, it was a relief to have
the site confirm my storey years after me telling it to other, that&#8217;s scary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I recently had a couple of
supernatural experiences while on vacation in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Chincoteague</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">VA.</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> The house that we were staying in was built in 1905.
The woman that lived there had passed away a few years earlier. My first
experience happened the first night. I was out on the couch in living room and
I kept hearing strange noises. Another experience that happened was I would
keep seeing shadows moving along the walls. My sister also claims that she
heard footsteps one night and couldn't go to sleep. Although I never saw a
person, the owners wife claims to have seen an elderly woman in one of the
windows.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

strange experiences. They started when I was very young, and at that time I was
afraid to tell anyone for the fact that they would think I was crazy. Well one
night I stayed up late to watch television, I was about 11 years old. As I was
watching tv I heard a noise from the corner of the room, kind of like thumping
when two cats are fighting and throwing eachother, only we didn't have any
cats.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At first it was that then a
loud bang like if they were thrown off the radio that was in that corner. By
this time I was very scared but stubborn enough to stay and see what happend
next. I would look in the direction of the noise and it would stop then when I
would look away it would start again. Then the thumping stopped and I heard
claws getting stuck in the carpet like a cat was walking towards me only it
sounded like two things. Again I would look then it would stop turn away then
it would start. Finally I had enough I ran to my bedroom and closed the door
completely. The things chased me I could hear them running after me, then
clawing at the door. I pulled the covers over my head only to hear them stop
and my door nob creek then turn and the door be pushed open.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">They circled my bed and all
I could do was pray and finally either passed out of fear or fell asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Needless to say I tried not
to stay up late anymore by myself. Although the door nob creeking and turning
didn't stop until I was fed up and yelled for it to stop doing that to scare me
and left the door open all night to sleep. Well that is one of my stories, I
have more but too long to tell maybe I will write again later. I hope this
didn't bore you to read or that it was too long an email but it feels good to
talk about it and know that I am not crazy and that I did hear and see things
in that house that no one else did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hey. My name is Hannah. I
was just curious have you ever heard any stories about the Eureka Theater in </span><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Eureka</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">? It's now the </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Eureka</span></st1:City></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> theater of performing arts I think.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, I used to live there when I was very
little. There was an apartment on top, and my dad was the manager of the
theater. And very strange things happened there.. almost on a nightly basis. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A few examples... One night
I was in bed with my mom and dad, and the lights were still on and everything
and my parents were still awake talking. And out of nowhere I look at the end
of the bed and there was a HUGE spider crawling up the bed but it was white and
kind of.. misty looking. Then I looked over to the bathroom and saw a small
white figure walk out of it. By small I mean no more than a foot high.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then I heard my dads blanket start to
pop. And I was screaming and freaking out so my mom told my dad to take me to
the living room and I fell asleep. That was the end of that night. Another time
My brothers were playing with their bouncy ball in one of the theaters , and my
brother bounced it really high and all of<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>a sudden<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>a "devils" tail came out from the
screen curtain and grabbed it. My brother was chased by a ghost. The janitor
that worked there would play loud music on a few different stereos and he would
hide behind mirrors because he said it "confused" the ghosts. Also
many people who worked there quit because they were so freaked out. Many people
just seeing a movie would see someone who was there and then dissapear a second
later. The place next door was also haunted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Those arent my only strange experiences though.. my brother, myself, and
my parents probably have hundreds of stories like that. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It's pretty strange. We've
experienced everything from ghosts, to strange noises, to ufos, aliens, balls
of lights, hooded figures, weird creatures, losses of time, even fairies on one
particular night. It was in the </span><st1:place><st1:country-region><span style="font-family: Arial;">georgia</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> mountains. My dad, my uncle, aunt, and grandpa were
camping out and they were the only people around. I mean there was NO one else
anywhere near where they were and they started hearing this strange folk
music/chanting? <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">so they started looking
around for what it could be. My dad was standing by a small bush by the road
and heard voices comng from it. So my dad got freaked out and asked everyone to
come with him to his tent that was down the road to get his stuff because he was
too scared to go down there alone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">On the way down they heard
zipping and ripping noises coming from the wodds on both sides of them. They
got to my dads tent and the strange music/chanting noise was practically coming
from his tent. He said it was very loud in his tent. So he ran in grabbed his
stuff and ran back up the road as fast as he could. Then that night my uncle
woke up to 3 knocks on the camper and he went to look and no one was there. And
the next morning a crow was circling their camper. Anyways.. Those are jsut a
couple stories. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">my name is tiffany smith and
i am 15 years old....not many people believe in ghosts...i never used to either
til not too long ago...here is my story...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">one night me and my friends
were all hanging out in my room and we were all talking when all of a sudden my
television shut off by its self....i thought that it was one of my friends
playing around and turning the tv off wit the remote....then i looked to the
side of me and noticed that the remote was next to me the whole time and plus
it had no batteries in it....we were all a little freaked out but we payed no
attention to it and we just turned the tv back on....about 15 minutes
later...we heard some one walking down my hall way and it sounded like it was
coming towards my room...we thought that it was my mom just coming to tell us
to be a little quieter but what ever it was just stopped walking when it got to
my bedroom door....we all looked at eachother and i opened the door to see who
it was but no one was there....so i just looked around then closed the
door....then about 2 minutes later someone knocked on my door and scared the
crap out of all of us...i opened my door...but only to see that no one was there....at
this time we were all FREAKING out...so we ran to my sisters room to make sure
it wasnt her...but she was sleeping...then we went to my mom and step dads room
and they were sleeping too....so we all went to my room and after that things
were fine.....until we fell asleep....about an hour ter we all fell asleep my
cousin woke up to go to the bathroom but she got an even bigger surprise...she
started tapping on my arm and when i woke up, i woke up to her face REALLY pale
and tears running down her face... i looked up and saw a lady staring at
us....the lady had a long red dress on and her hair tied back....by this time,
tears were running down my face also...we looked at the lady then all of a
sudden she disappeared...we looked back and my friend was sitting there with a
speachless look on her face.......she didn't know what to do or say....none of
us did....<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">i dont know what that lady
wanted to do.....but the one thing she definently did was scare the crap out of
me, my cousin, and my friend<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My grandmother passed away
before I found out I was pregnant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
daughter was namesaked after my grandmother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My grandfather met her when she was 2 weeks old and passed away some 4
months after that. (We live 800 miles from them).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the time I can remember, my daughter
would always follow something with her eyes and &#8220;talk&#8221; and babble to invisible
things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would laugh and giggle
looking at something intently that we could never see and I insisted it was my
grandparents. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One morning, when she was
very small, hardly old enough to turn herself over, she woke up not feeling
well so I put her in bed with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had
a double bed and it was fairly high enough off the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well this particular morning, after my alarm
went off, I blocked her up with some pillows just to be safe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was out in the kitchen having coffee and I
felt this urge to go check on her, so I did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This infant child had not only fallen out of bed, but was completely
unharmed and still sleeping&#8230;.there were boxed and shoes and cd&#8217;s all over the
floor, and she was laying in the one spot that didn&#8217;t have anything&#8230;almost like
someone just lifted her off the bed and placed her there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was the only one awake&#8230;and I was single at
the time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another thing&#8230;after she
could talk&#8230;.I have a picture of my grandparents in my bedroom&#8230;.she&#8217;s never met
them, only my grandfather the one time at 2 weeks old&#8230;and she said to
me&#8230;&#8221;that&#8217;s grandma and grandpa&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
completely blew my mind!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Anyway, I thought you&#8217;d like
to know you aren&#8217;t alone in the world and that I firmly believe that
children&#8230;especially infants, have a strong link to the other side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another story..not so much a
haunting&#8230;but definitely something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
estranged husband committed suicide a year ago.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had been separated from him for 5 years at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were just getting to the point where we
could be friends and I enjoyed it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well
he committed suicide and needless to say, our daughter and myself were
devastated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was always a tortured
soul on earth and I needed to know he was ok.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>2 nights after he died, I had a dream.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was in wooden casket and there was nothing around but darkness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was standing over him and no words were
said..but the lingering question was there&#8230;was he ok&#8230;was he happy now&#8230;was the
pain gone?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked at me in the
coffin&#8230;and he didn&#8217;t say a word&#8230;but I felt this complete and utter peace around
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I woke up knowing that he was fine
and the pain was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Now I know this is long, but
here is yet another one..and it involves my husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If anyone has ever heard that when you have a
loved one die, they sometimes leave<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>loose change around the house&#8230;in places where you know it isn&#8217;t supposed
to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well after he passed on, I would
find change in the most interesting places&#8230;under the computer chair (a handful
of loose change that wasn&#8217;t there in the morning), on the coffee table I had
just cleaned off the night before&#8230;.in piles on the floor in front of our daughter&#8217;s
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first I thought it was my
boyfriend or one of my daughter&#8217;s.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
denied it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That&#8217;s when I found out about
loved ones leaving change&#8230;.so the next time I found change where it wasn&#8217;t
supposed to be, I would just say outloud&#8230;&#8221;thanks for looking out Walt&#8221; and
leave it at that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now one day his sister
called and wanted to take my oldest (her niece) out for dinner&#8230;she didn&#8217;t
mention taking my little one, just the bigger one&#8230;so my senses were immediately
on red alert&#8230;.and it weighed heavy on my mind&#8230;.I then had a dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband kept telling me over and
over&#8230;&#8221;Don&#8217;t let her go&#8230;don&#8217;t let her go&#8221;..and I couldn&#8217;t figure out what he was
saying in my dream&#8230;.but then I said..&#8221;You&#8217;re dead..you can&#8217;t be here&#8230;you left
me the change remember?&#8221; and then, in my dream, I walked out of my room and he
was standing there and in front of him, spelled out in loose change, were the
words &#8220;DON&#8217;T LET HER GO!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So needless to
say I didn&#8217;t let her go!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunted House</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">hello ... i live in a haunted house in canton <st1:place><st1:State>connecticut</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the house was built in the early sixties by a
man who never married and devoted his time to creating the beautiful gardens
that surround the property. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>certain
features make this house very unique... you cross running water to reach teh
house, there's a stone circle in the woods near the property and the house sits
in the center of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>large clearing
surrounded by trees.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"steve" died in the late 80's - early 90's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he had no immediate family and he was dead in
the house for a few days before anyone found him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the house was vacant for about a year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it had two owners in very quick succession,
and then my fiance bought it in 1997.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>shortly after he moved in, it became very clear that steve was still
around and still regards pond house - our name for the place - as his.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>one night after beginning the first major
renovation project, don (my fiance) was in bed and felt someone push him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>one morning i was getting ready for work when
he called very early to ask me if i had come over to his place the night
before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i said, no, i'd be home all
evening and asked him why he thought so, and he said he'd been asleep on the
couch when he heard footsteps coming up the steps and someone who sounded like
me calling his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he was so sure it
was me, he waited for me to come and say hi, and when i didn't, he searched the
house looking for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>no one was
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a few weeks later, i experienced
the same thing... except i was already in bed and don had fallen asleep on the
couch that evening watching tv.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as i was
snuggling down to sleep, i heard a voice that sounded like<span style="">&nbsp; </span>don call my name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i also heard don snoring.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i sat up and said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'cut that out... it doesn't work when you can
hear the person snoring, too!!"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>another night i woke up in the middle of the night and heard what
sounded like a baseball game on TV.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>again, i thought don had fallen asleep with the tv on, until i looked
over, saw it was 2 AM, and that don was asleep next to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i also realized it was the middle of january,
and even on cable, baseball in january is pretty rare.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>and don never leaves the tv on - he turns it
off when he comes to bed.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>now that i
live here too, i see a lot of movement out of the corner of my eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my son has seen orbs float around his room,
my middle daughter has photographed orbs.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>don's daughter has seen a man around the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>there's a lot of activity that happens on the
property itself and steve doesn't much long change even now... but he and we
seem to have reached an amicable arrangement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>:)... thanks for reading... </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My life is full of ghost stories but one of the most
compelling incidents happened when I was working at a small museum in an area
full of history.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was in the office working at the computer when I felt
there was someone standing at the door. Of course, there was no one visible but
the pull for my attention got stronger and stronger. I tried to pay no attention
to the energy at the door but I think it got a little annoyed with being
ignored. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">All of the sudden there was the very loud sound of pots and
pans crashing down behind me. I knew this was impossible since there was
nothing behind me that could make that sound and when I looked around all was
normal. The sound was so clear and real that I actually ducked down and covered
my head with my arms. Since I was alone in the museum there was no one else to
ask to see if they heard the crash as well.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The museum is actually a very old church that was converted
a few years ago.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I don't work there anymore but I sure would like to know
what the entity was trying to tell me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This is not my story but an experience my brothers had that
I'd like to relate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandfather
passed away on September 3, 1998. My parents, grandmother and two brothers were
with him when he passed. I was unable to be there because I was beginning my
first year of college and was required to be at freshman orientation; something
I will always regret since I never got to say goodbye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brothers have never been big believers in
the supernatural, however that day they both definately found something amiss
in that hospital room. Watching my grandfather die was not something they could
take so they both went out into the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Shortly thereafter they both tried to walk back in the room to say
goodbye since my dad said he was going, but they were met with resistence. My
one brother describes it as "it felt like the room was too crowded".
He could not get through the doorway, there was too much pressure and it felt
as though someone was pressing on his shoulders to keep him out of the
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not long after that my grandfather
passed away and my brothers went in to say their final goodbye. They said the
room still felt crowded but they were welcomed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only thing they could think was that our family who had already
passed over (grandpa's parents, siblings etc) were waiting for grandpa and
possibly thought it best that they didn't see him die.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The funny thing is, neither my parents or my
grandmother felt anything odd, it was just my brothers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, my name is Amber and Ive written a few of my experiences
down for you before, this one is one that my mother told me about last
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This story happened a few days
ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now for a little background.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother lives in a small town in <st1:place><st1:State>Washington</st1:State></st1:place>
state called Goldendale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She lives just
outside the town itself, in a new mobile home that she rents from my husbands
recruiter and his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My younger
brother, and his girlfriend and their son are staying with her for a while, her
health isnt great.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My nephew is 4 yrs
old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is central to this story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are the only four people in the house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The other night, my mother, brother, his girlfriend, and
their son, wre in the living room watching tv after dinner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My nephew was sitting on the floor in the
frontroom, coloring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He glanced up into
the kitchen, then back down to hius coloring book, and quite casually asked my
brother "Daddy, who is the little girl in the kitchen doing the
dishes?"<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My brother jumped up and
ran into the kitchen, knowing that no one else was supposed to be in the house,
and my mother also went and looked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
didnt find anything, of course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now keep
in mind that my nephew wasnt at all frightened, he was totally nonchalant about
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So they asked him what he saw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told them that the little girl had dark
hair and a white dress on, he told them her name, and that she was sad and
crying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They asked him why, and he told
them it was because her daddy had killed her mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They asked him where she went and he told
them that she flew into grandmas bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">No odds, my mother nad brother were mystified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told her i wouldnt w ry too much about it,
that my nephew wasnt frightened and that whatever it was didnt hurt anyone, so
it should be okay, but that she needed to research the land, and ask the owners
about the mobile home, try to find out if there were any double murders close
to the area or in the house itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
personally think that the little girl was murdered at the same time as her
mother, and maybe doesnt even really realize it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Poor thing.</p>

</span>They have lived in the house since 1975 with no supernatural phenomena.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, one night while I was visiting, I awoke
during the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sleeping in the
den, which looks into the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
I awoke, I sat up to roll over in bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As I looked into the living room, I saw a little boy standing there who was
dressed in 1920's style clothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let me
tell you that scared the heck out of me!!!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I got up and went to sleep with my cousin!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, that was the only time I ever saw the
ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Weird thing is that about 5 years
later I am again at my grandmother's house, and I'm talking to her next door
neighbor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He's done some research on his
house and it turns out it was owned by Al Capone and that his mistress lived
there with her two children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His house
and my grandmother's homes were built around the same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, he's showing me pictures that he has
found of his house and there in one of the pictures is the little boy I saw
that night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">About 2 years ago, about 10:00 pm, I was quietly surfining
the web in my bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My 5 year old was
in his bedroom - at the other end of our apartment, asleep (or so I
thought).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is always a good time for
me to get in some quality computer time without inturruptions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was very quiet in our apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not one tv was on, which is unusual for us,
no radio, nothing.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My computer at that time was on a small desk in the corner
of our bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept getting a strange
feeling that someone was behind me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was thinking that it was my son sneaking around trying to put off going to
bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My neck got very cold, and a VERY
loud whisper was in my left ear "MOTHER".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I jumped up and ran to my son's bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was sitting up in his bed SO frightened by
a spider that he couldn't make any noise.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Just a terrified look on his face and an open mouthed silent
scream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To his credit it was quite a
nasty spider, coming down his little web right over <st1:City><st1:place>Tyler</st1:place></st1:City>'s
bed.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Someone or something was certainly watching over both of us
that evening!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This is my second story, of many more to come, that I am
submitting.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On January 2nd 2004 at 6:00am the alarm clock went off and
my wife needed to get up for work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
off that day and did not need to get up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well to go back for a second,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
need to add that on new year's eve we got a new dog - he was about a year old
when we got him and he weighed about 100 pounds and had some pretty good height
to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So with that out of the way, my
wife and I layed in bed and talked for about 10 or 15 minutes before she got
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then got out of bed and went
downstairs to take the dog outside before she showered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I layed awake in bed for some time because it
is hard for me to fall asleep because I have sleep disorders (insomnia and
sleep apnea).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I rolled over to my
stomach and partially on my right side and was basically laying with my head on
my right arm that was extended out under the pillow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was laying there wide awake I heard a
noise like someone had entered the bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I lifted my head and looked to the door but no one was there but as I
went to put my head back down on the pillow I thought I saw something out of
the corner of my eye and thought that maybe the dog came back into the room so
I looked again and nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I put my
head back on the pillow and layed there for about another 30 seconds when I
felt something lightly grab my wrist of my right arm. before I could act
something just POUNCED on me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The force
of pressure was just intense with most of the pressure being on the top part of
my shoulders and the back of my neck.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The thing that grabbed my wrist also intensified leaving me unable to
move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was pinned down for about 10
seconds (which seemed a lot longer at the time).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now I am a big guy weighing at about 285
pounds, built like a football player and I was not able to move a muscle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this weight lifted off of me I spun around
in bed to find nothing there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got up
and ran down the stairs. As I got to the bottom step my wife was coming out of
the bathroom and she looked at me and seen something was wrong and asked me
what happened and I told her that I got pinned down in bed and she got freaked
out and left for work early.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So for the
next month I really couldn't sleep wondering if whatever it was, was going to
return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And still more true experiences
to come.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I used to work at Clemens Unit,a medium security prison in
Brazoria,Texas.I started in 1999,and quickly heard of the past.There was a
inmate cemetary across the street from hwy 36,which was the main drag through
town.Only markers remain with numbers there,but I wanted to explain about while
I was living next door to the grounds.A trailer park was there on the property
line.Some cool foggy nites as you would look through the tree lines towards the
prison you could see dark figures walking through the trees,on closer
observation you could notice them working the fields, (hoe squad)as they called
it.My wife one nite was on the phone talking to `1 of her friends and freaked
out over seeing these images.The next work shift I explained what we
experienced to one of the Sargents,and he said that was alot of death and bad
things of the past all over the property.I really beleive that now,cause
starting about late 2000,I noticed alot more things happening at the prison,ok
the history lesson of the place starts in 1890,An inmate was brutally murdered
in the original building which housed 6 ,40 to 63 man tanks.we never knew why
he was killed,but the inmates started discribing a older black man in original
blk/white striped shirt/pant combo walking around in the old stage area,and
also among the tanks he would be present during the 12 to 2 am time.I
personally saw him in the old kitchen area a few times,and also through the
back hall area.He would just walk past me,smoking I think and walking towards
the outer doors.Some times I would go with an inmate up to the upper tanks by
the law library,to the storage (stage) room and always feel cold chills,warm
spots,and even "guss" as we called him walking around from one end of
the stage to the other.In 2002,I was called apon by some inmates as I worked
the tanks that nite,to help an inmate in the toilet area.come to find out that
he was having a massive heart attack,and as my Sargent and I were helping get
him on a gurney,he literly died in my arms.after that "guss" came
around alot more frequently,and if it was him or not,things happened more.Blk.
images floating among inmates at nite,the smell of rotting flesh in certain
parts of tank #3.It really got bad for awhile.The ending of this mans story,Is
that if you want to work in a prison,be ready for haunts,ghosts,spirits and
other bumps and smells along the way.Brazoria County,Texas is especially
haunted,cause of it's juicy past.if you like what you read in here,plz visit
the County of Ghosts in Texas.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I know that your site already has The Rave, located in <st1:place><st1:City>Milwaukee</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Wisconsin</st1:State></st1:place>, listed as one of the buildings
in your Haunted Places Index, but I honestly believe that the building right
next door to it should be listed, too.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The building is named The <st1:PersonName>Sheri</st1:PersonName>dan, and
it's one of those very old buildings that used to be a hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It feels as if you've travelled back to the
1950s every time you enter it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
even one of those elevators that is built something like a cage and has a
wooden panel you have to slide back to get to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The apartments even have fuse boxes and those lock boxes in the kitchen
cabinet that used to be used to store packages that were delivered from the
mail carrier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, moving on with the
subject, I just moved into this building like two weeks ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went into the rental office during my lunch
break on a Monday morning and paid my security deposit for it and received my keys.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whole thing only took like a half hour,
and I still had a half hour to waste for lunch, so I decided to go over and
check out my new home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Usually, people
do this BEFORE they pay for an apartment or home, but to be honest I had to
hurry up and move into a cheaper apartment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Money is tight and I didn't care what the apartment looked like, just as
long as I could get a decrease in rent before it was too late, so I just took
the first apartment available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked
into the building and went to the second floor, where my apartment was and was
about to put the key into the door but I swear I began feeling very, very
strange standing there at the door of the apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thinking back on it, I feel kind of retarded
because I really had no reason to have any sense of foreboding, but it was
there anyway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I mean, I stood there at
the door with my key inside of the lock, but something kept telling me not to
turn that key.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And while I was standing
there, I kept feeling eyes on me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
started to laugh at myself, but then I actually heard something or maybe
someone moving inside of the apartment and I didn't think anything was funny
anymore, I just took my key out of the door and left the building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still haven't moved in because I am kind of
nervous about going back there alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
haven't even been back to visit the apartment without someone with me, but I
know that eventually I'll have to move into the apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I paid for it and signed a lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know, maybe I'm just being really
dumb right now, but I am really convinced that something is not right with that
apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I haven't said anything to
anyone, though, because I don't want them to think I'm a superstitious fool... </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Unbelievable Events</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: colleen.cassidy@verizon.net</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Hi- I have never written about this, but when I was 16, I
had an unbelievable event happen to me. Over my childhood years, I have felt
that I have been visited by deceased family members, especially right after
they passed on. I have had them touch my hair, visit me in dreams, and just
feel them there. I have always been a light sleeper. Well, around 3-4am on a
weeknight, when my entire family was asleep, I was awakened by a dark shadow
standing in front of me. I was terrified, and couldn't move. It was black, but
somehow transparent also. It kept looking at me, then quickly started to move
back and forth- almost floating. It then ran up to me, then ran down the hall,
and slammed the bathroom door shut. Maybe it had to go? Ha! Anyway, I finally
had the courage to yell for my parents and had them look around the house. Of
course there was nothing. But even today- nearly 15 years later, I still have
shadows follow me upstairs every night.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another time, I was 6 months pregnant with my daughter, I
was up late one night crying very hard about a hard decision I had to make. I
always pray to myself at night, but on that particular night, I said
outloud," Mom or Pop, if you can hear me- please show me a sign that you
understand how I feel!" At that moment- my blinds shot up on their own! I
was shocked! That never happens! I never met my mother in law- whom I called
out to, but I knew Pop. I just hope they understood and agreed with the
decision that I made.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A few years back, my grandfather was dying of cancer. I was
supposed to go and see him for the last time the very next day. I prayed for
him, and told God and Pop Pop that it would be okay to leave, and that I would
understand. The next day he was gone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I know in my heart that ghosts exist-some good some bad. But
I would like to think they are there to reassure us and be there when we need
them the most! Thanks for listening!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I live in a small community, and one night my friend and I
were at her house and decided to go to a building which was just down the
street, called the Multicultural Centre, which was said to be haunted. Now you
see, this Centre was a historic site, which had an old house and a building
where they a little restraunt and they sold some other things there. So, we went
there and it wasn't that late at night, only around 6 or 7:00pm. Apparently the
building was closed because ALL the lights were out and no one was around. On
they building (not the old house) they had those windows right by the ground,
so being curious I knocked on one of them. Then something not expected
happened, something knocked back!! You may recall earlier as I said ALL of the
lights were off, and they were, I mean the place was locked! But the strange
thing was I didn't see a hand or anything. When that happened, I ran back and
screamed in fright, since then i have always been hesitant to go back or even
watch scary movies. I know it sounds like I'm being a little baby, but it was
more scary than it sounds. If you don't believe me I can't change that, but I
swear on my life, IT'S TRUE!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: wayne.parker2@comcast.net</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am not sure if this is a ghost story or just a vivid dream
but here goes. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I was 18, a dear friend of mine died (She was also 18).
</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Last summer I was very anxious and nervous. I have a 2 year
old and was informed by my doctor that I may have a form of Leukemia and I was
very agitated and scared. I had this dream, a dream that made it all better. I
was walking through a field of Sunflowers with my friend who had passed away.
She held my hand and told me everything would be ok and to turn around. When I
turned around, I saw myself, my husband and my daughter. My husband and I were
older and my daughter had grown up and we were all having a picnic with HER child.
I just felt so at ease and when I woke up I knew I was ok. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That weekend I went to visit my mother. I told her of the
dream and as I was in mid-sentence, my deceased friend's mother walked in! She
came to visit my mom also and to give her a gift she found somewhere. She
opened the gift and it was a suncatcher..a Sunflower suncatcher. I immediatly
told her of my dream and she got the most loving look on her face and said
"Libby was saying hi to me". She says this because after her death,
her mom always thought of her when she saw Sunflowers. Sunflowers are tall and
beautiful but also clumsy looking, just like Libby. Soon after her death,
sunflowers were everywhere she went so she always associated that with Libby
saying Hi. She also asked me when the dream was...and it turned out it was the
10 year anniversary of her death. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Here is another one if you don't mind. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another friend of mine died when he was 18...same year as
the other one but very different circumstances)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A year later I was very depressed and thinking about killing
myself. It was a Friday and I dreamed he was in a white room with me and I was
extactic he was there and he said "Don't worry about it, I'll see you on
Sunday"</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I took that as meaning on Sunday I would die (1 year
anniversary of death). So, Sunday night comes and I do it. I kill myself. I
took a bottle of pills and passed out. My mother found me and we went to the
ER, I got therapy and I am stable and ok now. The wierd thing is HOW my mother
found me. My deceased friend woke her up. My mother doesn't just wake up and
she is a sound sleeper. She was awaked at 3am by someone literally shaking her
and telling her to go in my room. She said she remembers saying no and trying
to roll over and this person kicked her in the stomach and she got a really bad
stomach ache so she got up. Now I know that when he said "Don't worry,
I'll see you Sunday" he meant he would be the one to save me. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Is all this possible or am I just an amazing dreamer? I have
many more that aren't dream related but I don't want to bombard you with them. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By:justin.donato@navy.mil</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I appreciate your reply...and like I said, I have quite a
few "stories".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I thought it
over and I decided to go ahead and share them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here's one of them:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Let me start by saying that I grew up in <st1:place><st1:City>New
  Orleans</st1:City>, <st1:State>LA</st1:State></st1:place>...and from living
there for all those years, I can tell you that there isn't much I haven't
seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was 13 years old, my
father, my brother, my grandmother, and I moved out of the apartment we were
living in, and into a house on the outskirts of the city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a nice house and I liked it a lot, but
at times things would happen that would scare me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first thing we noticed about the house
was that the front porch and the entrance to the front door was like a big
ramp...like it was designed for someone with a wheelchair. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well anyway...it must have been about a week after we moved
in, it was during the end of summer, around August, and in the summer I get bad
allergies and hay fever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I had gotten
sick that day, and I went to bed early, around 6 o'clock in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father had gone out, so had my
grandmother, and my little brother was staying at a friend's house back in our
old neighborhood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I was alone, which
didn't bother me because I like being alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So, it must have been around 9 or 10 at night when I heard this loud
banging noise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It woke me up abruptly,
and it kind of scared me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I get up
out of my bed and walk around the house looking for what's making that
noise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I walk into the kitchen, I can
tell that the noise is coming from outside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our kitchen faced our backyard, so as I looked out the window I could
see the whole yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Off in the corner of
the yard we had this old aluminum sided shed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now, it was pretty dark out there, and I was half asleep, and sick and
tired, and just flat out disorientated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But I was absolutley positive of what I was looking at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a little girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had her back to me and she was banging on
the shed as hard as she could.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
wearing a little dress with big polka dots and there was this big bow tie on
the back of her dress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And she had
pigtails in her hair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, I couldn't
help but to laugh at this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I figured
that since we were new in the neighborhood, some of the neighborhood kids were
just messing with us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, I just blew it
off and went back to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never
thought of it again and never mentioned it to any one.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then, about a month or two after that...school had started,
and I was in bed asleep because it was a school night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My little brother comes running into my room
and jumps on my bed with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, you
have to understand something... I have never known my brother to be scared of
anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He fears NOTHING.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So when I saw him freaked out like that, on
my bed shaking and crying, I was scared to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked him what happened, and at first he
couldn't even talk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just sat there and
held him until he calmed down, and then he finally told me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that he had woken up to use the
bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he got out of his bed, he
said he felt really cold, and he just felt weird...like someone was watching
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So he turned on his little lamp and
he looked around his room and he saw a little girl standing in the corner of
his room staring at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that
her face was all messed up, like someone had beat her with a bat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Half of her face was all smashed in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And she was wearing a polka dot dress, and
the dress was all muddy and torn, and she was just STARING at him!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, when he told me that, I was definatley
freaked out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That had to have been the
same girl I saw that night, but I never thought that she was a ghost or
anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought she was a regular
girl.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well, needless to say, my brother and I decided to keep that
to ourselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn't want to tell
anyone because we were scared that they would make fun of us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it seems like the more we tried to
pretend it didn't happen...the more she would mess with us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it wasn't just her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was someone else there, too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could never see him, but I could always
hear his wheelchair late at night, and I could hear him grunting in
frustration...like he was trying to get out of his wheelchair or
something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All sorts of little things
would happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd be watching TV in the
living room and I'd hear a little girl whisper something and I'd hear little
feet running across the kitchen floor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One time I was in the shower, and I was home alone, so I left the
bathroom door open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out of no where, the
lights in the bathroom went out and the door slammed shut!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was so freaked out, I didn't know what to
do.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">And things didn't just happen to me and my brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had friends that would be at my house and
tell me things, too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend Eric
spent the night at my house one night and he was sleeping on the floor next to
my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that something kept
touching his face, and when he opened his eyes to see it, it was a little
hand...like the hand of a child coming out from under my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yeah, after that I didn't sleep in my room
for a while.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But what I thought was odd,
was that she never messed with my grandmother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Or if she did, my grandmother just never mentioned it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She never really messed with my father
either, except for one night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a
couple of friends over and we were watching TV in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father had to work the next day so he was
in his room sleeping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, out of no
where, he comes running out into the living room yelling at me, and I was like,
"Dad, what's your problem, why are you screaming at me..."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And he told me to stay out of his room and
leave him alone while he's sleeping because he's tired and has to get up
early.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a bit confused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day I asked him why he did
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that he was sleeping and
he felt someone breathing on him, so he turned to look, but it was so dark, all
he could see was a dark figure and it kicked his bed and ran out of the
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He assumed it was me playing
around with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I knew who it was
and it made the hair on the back of my neck stand straight up when he told me
that.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That's pretty much it for that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never saw the girl again, but you didn't
have to see her to know that she was there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She obviously loved attention and would try to get it from whoever was
around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as for the wheelchair
man...I asked some people in my neighborhood about that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They told me that some old guy used to live
there by himself and yes, he was in a wheelchair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked some of them if he had a
granddaughter or if ever there was a little girl that lived there, and they
said no, they never saw any girl there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But they found that question odd because there was a little girl that
lived in that neighborhood years ago that went missing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some people believed that the old man that
was in the wheelchair had lured her in the house and....well, who knows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They said that the police investigated the
missing girl, but she was never found.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The old man lived in the house by himself and he was supposedly kind of
weird, so they questioned him without any probable cause and he filed a
complaint against them and that was the end of that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never knew what the think about all
this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I even contemplated digging around
in the backyard, maybe around the shed to see if her body was buried
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't know what to believe, so
I decided to just forget about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
on the day we moved out...a few years later, I think I was 16,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>all of our stuff was out of the house, and I
was so exhausted from moving the stuff all day that I fell asleep on the floor
in what used to be my bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a
dream of a little girl trying to talk to me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I couldn't see her, and I could barely make out what she was
saying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But she seemed desperate and she
kept trying to talk to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seemed
like it was real...but then again, it had to be a dream, right?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who knows.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Greetings!! </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I'ts been a few years
since I sent a story in as I was layed (oops,not PC..)I mean there was a
"Reduction in force" where I use to work. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My situation was this...My wife and I had gone to Las Vegas
for some R&amp;R(November time frame) and the last night we were there I had
the most vivid nightmare I've had in a long time that unfortunately came true.
I guess they call this a "preminition" I saw my older sister's death/
funeral playing in my head ,right down to the type of casket!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>December 25th of 2004 at 3am it became
reality.She had been fighting cancer for a year or so and had gone into
remission,or so they thought. It came back with a vengance. I had<span style="">&nbsp; </span>relayed this "story" to my mom the
night she called to give me the news,and her only comment was,"just like
your grandfather".I take it from all my mom has said about our family in
the past is that "we" have been given that gift since we were
kids.This kind of gift "they " can take back !! Thankfully I have had
no more of these preminitions(so far)and was really bummed out by it. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks for letting me ramble!! </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Glad to see the website is still there!!!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Bed Time</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Recently my boyfriend Mark and I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>bought a new bed. Once we got it home and
into our bedroom, we put the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">duvet and pillows on and went downstairs to answer the door
to find that it was our friends, Dave and Karen. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We had a chat and a couple of drinks then had a Chinese take
away. We realised it was getting late so we said </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">goodbye to our friends and headed upstairs. Once the bedroom
door was open, we noticed that the duvet and pil-lows were scattered around the
room and a big red patch emerged on the mattress. After this incident, no
strange happening occurred but we were still rather scared. Mark decided to
research about the bed, then he emailed the man that had sold him the bed and
got this reply:' My fellow salesmen and I are very sorry to tell you that the
bed you bought appears to be haunted. The previous owners had a very hard time
because of financial difficul-ty's and after her husband died mysteriously in a
car accident she gave up the will to live and committed suicide in her own bed.
' After receiving this e-mail, we decided to leave the bed in our house for a
couple of nights be-fore dispossessing of it. During the day, nothing unusual
happened but that night when Mark and I went silently to bed, I saw green eyes
peering in through the window. Frozen with fear, I managed to wake Mark up but
by then the eyes had gone. He was cross for being woken up, and went straight
back to sleep. I then saw blue gunge seeping through the walls and dripping
onto the floor. I screamed which woke Mark up yet again and I showed him the
wall where the gunge had been. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Strangely,
the gunge had disappeared and there was nothing at all on the wall. I still
don't know why it is </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">that only I could see the haunting's, perhaps it is because
I was the one that wanted to dump the bed, whereas </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Mark insisted on keeping it. He was not usually like this,
he said the bed was possessing him. But in the end we </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">got rid of the bed and Mark got back to his normal self. We
will never buy a new bed again.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Four years ago I lost my<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>best friend<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We both were Radio
Broadcasters his name was Tom Rose<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tom
Suddenly passed away while doing his show<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>his daughter felt the need to let me have Toms CDS<span style="">&nbsp; </span>after several weeks I had the courage to seat
in my kitchen and play Toms music<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
alone that night my cocker spaniel was outside all of a sudden my dog was
barking uncontrollable<span style="">&nbsp; </span>staring at me
through my sliding door finally I had to turn off the stereo I packed up the
cds<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and was carrying the case upstairs<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will never forget when I reached my fourth
step I heard my kitchen floor making noise only the sound when walking I froze
and started yelling out my wife's name thinking she may had come home there was
no reply I have an alarm system<span style="">&nbsp; </span>all at
once I heard<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my alarm door beep only
beeps when the door opens or close<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran
downstairs thinking someone came home to my shock there was no one but myself.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I emailed you on 11/10 regarding my best friend Tom
Rose<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my name is Tony there is more
occurrences that took place<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One week
before Toms death I use to do plant tours for the company I work for one day
while I was walking through an area I did everyday I was in a hurry as I walked
through a young girl with long brown hair no more than in her mid twenties said
in a very sweet voice Hi Tony I took a quick glance and replied I kept on
moving until it dawned on me who was this person that knew me and I felt bad I
did not stop to speak with her so I decided to go back to where she was when I
arrived she was not there I started to ask several workers in that are where is
the girl who was working on the first line they told me no one ever works there
I waited several minutes to see if she returned she did not<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I purposely went back there every day for one
week and never saw her again<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do
remember when she said hi Tony she put her head down with no expression<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that same night I phoned Tom and told him
something really strange had happen my father passed away nine months before
Tom said maybe it was a sign for your Father that following week on a Sunday at
3:07pm Tom passed away while doing his Radio program toms on air name was
Doc<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tom and myself would speak
everynight on the phone sometimes for hours<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>we would sometimes kid around and tell each other<span style="">&nbsp; </span>if any thing would happen to one of us we
would keep the music we owned<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the first
Sunday after Toms death I felt the need to do his show the hardest thing I will
ever do now I knew Tom had a Daughter Michele but never had a chance to meet
her when I was on that day a young girl entered the studio and ask if I was
Tony she introduced her self being Toms Daughter she told me she came to pick
up his belongings in the office that was being stored the General Manager came
in shortly after opened the office and handed Michele Toms Jacket and cases of
CDS<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked Michele if she would stay
with me in the studio while doing the show and she did<span style="">&nbsp; </span>now Tom had a favorite song entitled Dear I
Swear by the Plants<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the song I still
play in is memory when I am doing a show I played it that day saved it for last
I noticed something strange about the song while it was playing the song
finished and I thought nothing else about it<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>in the mean time after the show Michele turned to me and said I feel I
need to let you have my Dads CDS I asked her if tom had ever mentioned that to
you she said no why I just knew how close you both were<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>after the show I played the program from
that show when I heard Dear I swear I could not believe it was possible the
lyric she is mine all mine backed cured it self and repeated a Cd cannot do
that once it skips it cant continue like it did than I recalled something I
heard through my headphones and that was it I played the same cd now and never
has any hesitations I made Rollye James from Wpht who was a friend to the both
of us hear what I heard on the tape she agreed it could not have happened
naturally she was thrown back<span style="">&nbsp; </span>did not
mean to take up too much of your time but needed this off of my chest there
were a few more strange events that took place I never went to see where Tom
was burried<span style="">&nbsp; </span>until my daughter bought her
home across the street was the Cemetery that tom was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I decided to walk over and find his resting
place<span style="">&nbsp; </span>after that visit all the strange
occurrences I was having ceased<span style="">&nbsp; </span>what I

<p class="MsoNormal">This house sits on the corner of Clinton and Valentine. It's
a white two story house with a animal pen to it's right, (if your facing the
house). There's a big green gate in the front of the house creating a kind of
outside foyer. It once had a beautiful white horse that would pace nervously
from side to side, then one day, the horse ran full speed at the brick wall at
the back of the pen and killed itself. An eerie greenish light was seen from a
small rectangular hole near the foundation of the house (the basement?). While
the house was abandoned, I went in with a friend, we have video footage of a
dresser, with one of the drawers taken out and set on top of the dresser, that
suddenly slides off and slams to the floor. There was a smell of something
rotting (dead) coming from the attic when you got to the landing on the stairs
(inside), a general sense of dread, like something bad happened in that house.
We also have video footage of a pair of sunglasses hanging on the wall in the
kitchen. There was nothing for them to hang on, nor were either of us wearing
sunglasses, we went at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We saw a
mist in the living room, where the feeling of something bad got worse. A cold
draft came from behind us, and some knocking, and we took off like someone lit
a fire under out butts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People live
there now, there's a for sale sign up, they've only been there for a year. No
one stays in that house long, and I don't blame them. Something happened in
that house, and whoever or whatever is there doesn't want anyone to be there.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Ive seen a few of these stories and mine isn't anything
terrifying at all. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">its a bit comical.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Ive got a cat who has befriended a ghost in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brother and I are are the only ones that
live there and we are 21.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ok, so this
ghost only bothers us when our cat is upset. if we dont feed her on time, a
glass breaks in the kitchen. if we dont let the cat in, a glass breaks in the
kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>one day my mother decides to
take the cat with her to my grandfather's house where she (my mom) also
lives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>guess who got to buy new glasses
the next day. Segue: We have a dripping shower. our shower isnt one in a
bathtub and doesnt have doors, just a shower curtain that fails to reach the floor,
so water splashes onto it. End segue. Well the day after my cat was taken, my
brother and I see footprints on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Small footprints that seem to be the footprints of an 11 year old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>there were also wet footprints on the carpet
outside of the bathroom. Didnt bother us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My mother came by that day and called me into the living
room from my room. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">You have to go through the kitchen to get to the living room
from mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">when i got to the kitchen i heard a little girl say, "
Come here Abby." </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">that's my cat's name. It didn't surprise me because i've
never paid much attention to the out-of-ordinary things that happen around
here. I paid attention that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About
10 pm the t.v.s in all 3 bedrooms turned on as well as the one in the living
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vacuum also turned on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lights didnt flicker, just turned on and
stayed on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>so i told the ghost that i
would go get the cat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>all the lights,
tvs and the vacuum turned off at the same time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I brought the cat back. Glasses still break when Abby's unhappy, but I
had a "talk" with the ghost and told her to turn a light or tv off or
on if the cat wanted in or wanted to be fed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It works. That's my story. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Hope you have a good laugh at it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Paranormal Activity in My Condo Apartment</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: sbabich@airwaystrucks.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am a thirty year old male living in <st1:place><st1:City>Fort
  McMurray</st1:City> <st1:State>Alberta</st1:State></st1:place>. I am a
manager of a rental company and here is my story, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On October 12 2005 my nephew and I were playing video games
on our Sony playstation. Meanwhile my 18 month old daughter was playing in our
dinning room area with her toys. Being tuned into the game we were not paying
to much attention to what she was doing. Suddenly she would stop come into the
living room and say &#8220;it&#8217;s scary daddy&#8221;. Not thinking anything of it we
continued to play our game and she went on playing. This then happened again a
second then a third time, this time I watched her to see what she was doing.
She would run into the dinning area and say &#8220;boo&#8221; then turn around run into the
living room saying &#8220;it&#8217;s scary&#8221; then giggle this happened about six or seven
times. We started to get a little freaked out, so I started to ask her what is
scary. And she would reply &#8220;it&#8217;s scary&#8221; every time I asked her. Getting no
where I then asked her to show me what was scary. She then led me and my nephew
around the kitchen table crouched down to the ground and physically tried to
pick something up of the floor. I asked her 3 more times to show me and each
time would take me to the same spot and try to pick something up. We then moved
to the living room to try and clear our heads to figure this out. Meanwhile my
daughter had gone into the dinning area again and started to look around the
table say &#8220;boo&#8221; and start giggling hard, this went on for about 15 minutes with
her following something around the table, playing with it. Over all this went
on for about an hour and a half. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Since then about every two or three days in the evenings my
daughter would have what I would call episodes of varying severity and length
of her seeing or playing with something in the apartment always in the kitchen
or the dinning room. Over the last two months my daughter has been having more
and more nightmares waking her up I have noticed since being aware that usually
these episodes occur after waking up and after being up for one to two hours. I
talked to a doctor about the nightmares and he said it is very unusual for a
child that young to experience nightmares causing her to wake up and stay
awake. So I am wondering if it is nightmares at all or if it&#8217;s something else
waking her up in the night wanting to play.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On October 1st 2005 we moved out of the apartment not due to
related problems but due to a nicer property becoming available. Last night
October 7th 2005 I was in the apartment again with my nephew trying to clean up
and to get a few more things out since we have till the end of the month. I was
walking into the bedroom and glanced in the bathroom as I was walking by. In
the mirror looking at me I saw a young girl ten to thirteen years old. I
stopped in my tracks looked for what seemed, several seconds, got a very good
look and then she was gone. She had long dirty blonde hair but what was very
strange that there was grey hair mixed in with blond, she had very high check
bones, a thin face with a narrow chin, and thin lips. Her eyes were large for
here face and the colored part of the eyes were black; I remember this the most
because she was starting directly into my eyes. She was very thin and was
wearing a very faded summer dress with large 5 peddled flowers on it. Her skin
was grey and had what looked like age wrinkles on her face but I could tell it
was a young girl; she looked like had been there for a very long time. At this
point I kind of lost it and headed for the front door. My nephew asked what was
going on and I told him I was getting the fuck out of there. I calmed down and
refused to let my fears take over, I mean heck she has been there this long and
has not hurt anyone. So we finished what were we doing and I started to load
the truck. While I was down stairs the nephew said it felt like someone was
watching everything he was doing in the apartment. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I being a person that does not like horror films and do not
watch them can not attribute this to my imagination because I have never seen
anything like this in any movie or picture and there is no doubt in my mind in
what I saw. At this point my concern is this I have heard that spirits can
become attached to individuals and or material things, what can I do to try and
prevent this from happening with my daughter or our belongings, frankly she can
stay were she is for all I care.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">If there is anyone who can explain what I can or should do
please respond to the email. Regards Steven Babich</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have only had one experience in my life and this is one
that changed my life and way of thinking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I was a teen my grandmother moved in with us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I loved my grandmother, we were very close,
so much that my mother would call me her junior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well when I was seventeen I went to prom and
my grandmother had let me borrow<span style="">&nbsp; </span>her
beautiful ruby necklace, Well at that age being somewhat reckless I lost it
somewhere, to this day I still do not know where I just remember at the end of
the night my mother was so upset with me, my grandmother being very
understanding and forgiving was not upset at all, a year later my grandmother
passed away, not long after that I joined the military and got stationed in
Germany for years I had not talked to my family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried started my on family but only after
two years my husband left, at this point I had been in Europe for 4 years and I
still had another year to go, one night I was a hysterical drunken mess I broke
down, I cried for hours and past out and the end of the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning when I woke I found clutched
in my hand one beautiful ruby necklace that was my grandmothers, I don't know
how to explain this, it just happened, I shared this with my mother and we both
cried and together with the help of my family and really weird occurrence I am
putting my life back together, Thank you for letting me share this with you</p>
