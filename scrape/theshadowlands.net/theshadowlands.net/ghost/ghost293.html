<p><b>Regarding Santa Ana High School</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>As one of the members of a theatre group that had shows at the auditorium,
I can tell you that the legend of “Alice” seems to be correct.&nbsp; One
of the oldest high schools in Orange county, it is said that Alice fell
through the rafters of the auditorium during the opening night.&nbsp; She
was rehearsing upstairs and fell through the rafters, through the ceiling
and into the front row of seats.&nbsp; This is, reportedly, in the 20’s.</b>
<br><b>To my knowledge, no “signs” have ever been carved in the floor of
the attic.&nbsp; However, the groundskeeper Or janitor (if you like) did
sometimes allow students to go up there and ask for Alice’s blessings.
if the play’s principle characters did not go upstairs and say a prayer
or offer flowers, it was inevitable that someone unexplainable would go
wrong.</b>
<br><b>Mics would go out with no reason.&nbsp; The power would be fine,
every mic would work when tested but once on stage, the principle’s mic
wouldn’t work.&nbsp; Lights would go out with my reason and in the attic,
doors would shut and lock though open and unlocked when left.</b>
<br><b>When I was in a play there, the local school officials had banned
students from going into the attic.&nbsp; They had been poorly informed
that “Satanic rituals” were being done upstairs and since it was a public
school, such things weren’t allowed.&nbsp; I felt bad for the spirit, however,
and wet alone upstairs anyway,&nbsp; I knelt on the floor and offered her
a flower.&nbsp; I was told that at the end of the show I could come back
and get it so there’d be no evidence of anyone having been there.</b>
<br><b>At the end of the show, I ran upstairs to go get the flower.&nbsp;
I had the more horrible and terrifying experience.&nbsp; I felt like I
couldn’t breathe and something told me that I needed to go back downstairs
RIGHT NOW.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; When I walked up a few minutes later, I found
that the attic door was locked, when it had been left open and unlocked
previously.&nbsp; The only person with the key swore that he didn’t lock
the door and that “Alice must be playing tricks again.&nbsp; She probably
wants to keep the flower”&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it’d been tradition, I was
perfectly fine with that.&nbsp; So far, there has been&nbsp; no corroboration
of this Alice story.&nbsp; It seems to be purely lore.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Plantation Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Wavesinger19@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>My father lives in Delhi, Louisiana on a huge cotton farm.&nbsp;
It was built a very long time ago, I think in the late 1800's.&nbsp; I
lived with my mother in Mississippi most of my life.&nbsp; I am now 19
and attend college in Mississippi at a University here.&nbsp; Therefore,
I have only been to the farm a couple of times since my parents got a divorce
when I was 14.&nbsp; But I used to have to go there all the time when I
was little, which I hated.&nbsp; It all started as far back as I can remember.&nbsp;
I would go visit my grandparents when they were alive and lived at the
plantation house.&nbsp; Everyone called it "The Place".&nbsp; There would
always be something there that always made me uncomfortable.&nbsp; Being
so little I couldn't describe it.&nbsp; I never wanted to be alone in a
room.&nbsp; My mother would worry about me because I would always stay
in this one little cornor and play.&nbsp; I would hear things and think
I would see things.&nbsp; I would play outside a lot at a little pond they
had.&nbsp; I would always think I saw something moving behind the trees
at the pond.&nbsp; The place was just down right creepy.&nbsp; Just a couple
of years ago, maybe 1 or 2, I was talking to my mom after I had come home
from school.&nbsp; We were talking about "The Place".&nbsp; She told me
for a little while one of my ancestors ran a doctor's practice out of the
huge formal living room that it had.&nbsp; A lot of people had died in
there.&nbsp; Thinking about some of the chills and scary feelings I had
had in that living room (since all the adults would be talking in the den)
things started to piece together a little bit for me.&nbsp; Then, one night
my dad had called.&nbsp; My dad is a very smart man.&nbsp; He also has
a very good head on his shoulders.&nbsp; He sounded a little upset.&nbsp;
He moved into the house after the divorce.&nbsp; He had another wife, but
they had gotten a divorce.&nbsp; He was at that house all alone.&nbsp;
He started noticing some weird things that he had accounted to other people
being in the house.&nbsp; Things were moved out into the middle of the
floor.&nbsp; He would walk into rooms and all the lights would be on.&nbsp;
He would hear thumps and thuds all through the house.&nbsp; He didn't know
what to think.&nbsp; Things would come up missing a lot.&nbsp; And he said
he knew when things would be bad at night when he drove home from work
and there was a haze around the moon.&nbsp; I never experienced anything
like this, but I have no doubt that he did.&nbsp; I thought I would just
share this story with people like the hosts of this site (I have read your
personal story) and wonder if this is normal or if we are all just imagining
things.&nbsp; I hope I can get some kind of response.</b>

<p><b>Paranormal Activity</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Juggalettemj17@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>You will probably think this is boring, but to me it was anything
but boring..ok heres the story..one day&nbsp; my mom was getting ready
to take my 2 little sisters and my little brother to a halloween party
and,&nbsp; i was hungry so i went into the kitchen and i opened the refrigerator
and there was a roll of toilet paper in there, i asked my mother and siblings
how it got there and they all said they didnt know and it was probably
put there by someone on accident, so i dismissed it as nothing. The very
next day me and my little 4 year old brother were home by ourselves and
i decided to wash the dishes so i picked up the dishwashing liquid and
was getting ready to wash the dishes, when my little brother called me
into the hallway next to the kitchen so i could read him a book..I was
reading to him 5 minutes when me and him heard the refrigerator door open
then close, he looked at me and asked "did a ghost do that?" and i said
"no i dont think so." Then i brushed that off like it was nothing, about
10 minutes later i decided to go and do the dishes, i went into the kitchid
was gone, i thought i misplaced it so i looked all over the house, i even
had my little brother look with me, we found it no where, so i just sat
and thought were could it be, then i got a brilliant idea and decided to
open the refrigerator, when i opened the refrigerator i saw the dishwashing
liquid sitting right there on the top refrigerator shelf, my little brother
looked at me shocked and said "The ghost did that." i just looked at him,
when my mom came home i told her and she told me to shut up i am lying
and all that crap but me and my brother know what we saw, and i will never
forget it, also in that house i would hear footsteps of little children
running up and down the stairs, when i would look no one would ever be
there, there were a few instances where my t.v. would come on or turn off
without me touching it, there were also a few times where my bedroom door
would fly open really fast..this all happened about 2 months ago so its
pretty new to me, im not sure what it was that caused all the paranormal
activities but i never felt scared or threatened by what/who ever it was.
I have a few more incidents involving paranormal activities if you are
interested in knowing about them then feel free to contact me at Juggalettemj17@aol.com</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Left Side</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DarkLiLCowGirl@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>*03/31/04* Myexperiences began when I was very young, at least five
or six years old. Most of the small town I live in is Indian burial ground
and one highway is especially haunted. I don’t live on that highway but
the house I lived in was haunted anyway. I would often hear someone call
my name when no one was around and also strange laughter, also when no
one was near me. A few times I heard someone call my name while I was taking
a shower and the voice sounded identical to my mom's voice. But when I
asked her why she called my name she appeared confused and said she never
called my name. My dad thought something was really wrong with me and many
times he would sit me down and pray for me and for the weird incidents
to stop happening. I knew something was wrong but I didn’t even know what
it was, what was causing it, how to stop it, or why these things were happening
to me and no one else. Not much else happened until I was ten or eleven
years old. My family and I had just moved to a new house on a large piece
of land with a two-story house next door to us that was almost one hundred
years old. At first all seemed right but after a few nights of sleeping
in the new house I began waking up in strange places like the kitchen or
the living room. A few times I even saw apparitions of things I cant explain,
the one I remember the most was a floating piece of paper. Those incidents
were often accompanied by uncontrollable chills and shaking. After a few
nights of that happening to me I never went through it again until a very
later time, which I will explain eventually. Nothing happened for at least
a year until one day my mom and I were outside doing yard work for my neighbor
who lived in the big two-story house. I was watching the road when I saw
an extremely bright flash and a small figure darted across the road and
vanished. It looked like a Persian cat but it was too far away for me to
be sure of what I had seen. I dismissed the sight until a few days later
I was back in my neighbors yard. She had a cat that had just had kittens
and she was more than willing to let me play with them so a lot of time
was usually spent in her big backyard. There was no kind of fence or barrier
blocking our yard from hers so I would always just walk to her back door
and play with the kittens. While I was over there that day I was playing
with the mother cat. I was bending over to pet her and I saw a white cat
walking towards me between my legs. I stood up and turned around to pet
it and no white cat could be seen. Suddenly I remembered the Persian I
had seen flash and run across the road that day and I figured it had to
be a ghost. From then on I often saw the cat playing and running out of
the corner of my eye. It would sometimes even follow me when I walked back
to my yard and when I turned around it would vanish. I never thought of
the ghost as dangerous or serious but things would start happening that
would quickly change my mind. I began to see what appeared to be a very
large man standing in my yard. He wore a plaid jacket and he was at least
six or seven feet tall and he was also wide. I was never really scared
because he never attempted to harm me or come near me in any way. It was
almost like he was watching over me in a way and I even began to like him.
Back then before my parents divorced my family consisted of seven members:
my parents of course and five children, me being the oldest. Our house
only had three bedrooms but I didn’t have one so I slept on a bed in my
living room that folded out from the couch. Soon I began to hear someone
breathing close to my left ear as I tried to fall asleep at night, for
some reason it was always on the left side of me. I was paralyzed from
fear at first but I soon got used to it and I figured it was the man I
had seen standing in my yard, only now he had moved into my house and into
my bed. The ghost began to get more comfortable and almost every night
I would feel the bed move as he lay down beside me, and the bed would move
again when he decided to get up. Once again I was extremely scared as these
things started happening but they happened almost every night so I eventually
got used to it. The ghost considered the left side of the bed his and he
never let me sleep on that side. If I ended up falling asleep on that side
he would blow in my ear or hit mypillow until I moved to the other side
of the bed. Sometimes he would lightly touch my face or brush his fingers
through my hair. I felt some kind of loving connection with this ghost,
not a romantic kind of thing but like something protective and safe. As
time passed I began to see another figure, a little girl in a white gown.
I was never really afraid of her because by then I was used to seeing ghosts,
even in other peoples houses. I quickly learned that she loved to play
as I would often see her hiding around corners and running when I walked
past her. She was usually smiling and the presence that accompanied her
was a happy one. I named her Boo because one night as I was lying in my
dad’s bed listening to music, she playfully pushed me and said, "Boo."
Maybe she was letting me know she wanted to play. I became fond of the
ghosts and I wasn’t scared of them anymore, but there were other spirits
that weren’t so nice. Strange things happened to me in my neighbor’s house.
Because she was ninety years old and lived alone she would have friends
come pick her up and take her to get groceries or to see her husband who
lived in a nursing home. One day I was outside as one of her friends drove
into her yard. I watched as she spent a few minutes knocking on the front
door with no reply. She walked over to me and asked me if my neighbor was
home. I replied I didn’t know but my mom had a set of keys to her house
in case of an emergency so I got those and we walked back to her house
and let ourselves in. While she looked upstairs for my neighbor I looked
in the kitchen. From the minute I walked into the house I sensed a weird
vibe, like there was some kind of evil or strange presence in the house
and it wanted us out. Her kitchen was very small and in the back of it
there was a door that led into the pantry and in the back of the pantry
there was a screened door that led outside to the steps where I played
with the kittens. The door that led into the pantry had a large glass window
that took up the top half of the door. I walked up to the door and peered
into the pantry to see if my neighbor was in there. When my face was a
few inches from the glass something banged it and I screamed and backed
away. It sounded and looked as if someone had thrown a fist into the glass
but it didn’t even crack. My neighbor’s friend decided that we should leave
the house so we quickly locked the door and she drove away. From them on
I never went into the house alone. Back in my house there were times that
I would see terrifying things. Sometimes a tall black figure would walk
from a few feet away from my bed to the kitchen and it would do this all
night. Probably the most terrifying thing I have ever seen were small black
figures that were at least two or three feet tall and would run on all
fours from behind my chair and into the hallway and back again. When I
saw these things I would pray and ask God to make them go away and they
would disappear until the next night. After a while they were gone and
since then I have only seen them very rarely. At least a year after I saw
the black figures I got my own room and strange things happened there too.
Myprotective ghost followed me and because my bed was small there was no
room for him to lie on the left side so he would often just sit for a few
minutes and for the rest of the night I would hear him walking around my
room. When I slept over at my friend’s houses I would warn my brother to
stay out of my room and apparently my ghosts decided to enforce my warning.
One night when I was away my brother slept in my room and all night the
ghosts shook my bed and rattled two bedrails that were leaning up against
my wall. Needless to say my brother never slept in my room again. I later
found out that these things weren’t happening to just me, my mom had also
had similar experiences since we had moved into that house. I was amazed
when she described the little girl and the man in the plaid jacket, and
she told me that she often saw the man standing at the edge of her bed
or at the end of the hallway as if he was watching over her and the kids.
And it appeared the she and I were the only ones that could see them. My
mom and I both experienced a feeling of being followed as we walked down
the hallway. And she would often walk down the hallway to find the closet
door open only a few minutes after she had shut it. One of my strangest
experiences happened one night when I was asleep. I had just gone through
a bad situation with an ex boyfriend and I felt terrible and extremely
stressed, like everything was going wrong for me and it kind of was at
the time. At about 2:00 in the morning I woke up and saw a black figure
similar to the grim reaper walking towards my bed. I felt like I was in
some kind of trance and it seemed to hold me there as it continued walking
towards me. For about three or four hours I fell in and out of consciousness
and when I was unconscious I found myself fighting the figure in every
way I could. It was very evil and I felt like it wanted me in some way.
When I was conscious I would lay paralyzed in my bed looking at the figure
standing above me until I eventually fell back into the dream state where
I continued fighting it. After what seemed like forever I felt physicallyand
mentally exhausted. Just when I was about to give up I fell back into unconsciousness
and saw what saved me. I saw an angel above me with what I think in his
hands was the Holy Bible. Behind him was a large crucifix and it slowly
began to glow until it was very bright. I watched as the angel pointed
one hand at the demon while at the same time saying some kind of banishment
prayer for deliverance from evil. The demon covered its face and backed
awayand eventually vanished. I looked thankfully at the angel and finally
woke up for the last time. I stayed awake for the rest of the night trying
to figure out what had happened to me. I know what I just described sounds
unbelievableand unreal but I swear it really happened. Since then nothing
like that has happened thankfully but I did continue seeing my two ghosts.
One day my mom came home with news that my grandmother was in the hospital
dying. Since the only thing we could do for her was take care of her at
home we had to move into her house. Since my parents divorced several years
ago my dad had moved into a smaller house several miles away from us, but
when we moved into mygrandmothers house he moved back into my house with
the ghosts and he lives there alone now. Since we moved I haven’t seen
my ghosts, but sometimes when I visit my dad Boo will let me know she’s
around and I can still hear the man in the plaid jacket walking around
the house. My dad has never seen these ghosts but he finally believes me
now. While my grandmother was dying she would often confuse things and
for some reason she only called my name for help. I hardly ever went to
see her because I was scared to see her that way and I figured my mind
probably wouldn’t be able to handle it. She died on a Saturday and only
a few days after the funeral strange things started happening again. My
mom and I began to see her in the hallway, often near my cousin’s old bedroom.
Later, doors could be hear slamming in the middle of the night when everyone
was asleep and my grandmother would keep my mom awake most nights. This
was all very stressful to my mom and finally one day when she sensed my
grandmother near her, she told her that it was time to go home and that
everything was okay for us. Since then nothing has happened to anyone but
me. Sometimes I still see my grandmother’s short stout figure in her white
gown in the hallway though. Something that bothers me really bad is my
ability to see death angels as my mom calls them. Tall black figures that
often appear a few hours or minutes before a person’s death. Only a few
weeks ago I was sleeping in my living room when I saw one walk past my
fireplace and into the kitchen. I tried to brush it off but a few hours
later my mom’s friend called and told us that her ex husband had died of
a heart attack an hour earlier. I told my mom and she believed me but something
makes me wish I had kept it to myself. I guess this is the end of my story
for now. In a few months I will be moving to Tampa and I can only imagine
what I will see there.</b><b></b>

<br><b>More Ghost Stuff....</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: nicole197698@juno.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is continued to my previous post. Lately in the last few weeks
my</b>
<br><b>ghosts have been actively walking around the house as if looking
for</b>
<br><b>someone or something. A few days ago, today is March 31,2004 I was</b>
<br><b>sitting outside on my front stoop smoking a cigarette when, out
of the</b>
<br><b>corner of my right eye, i saw a full apparition wearing a black
cloak, it</b>
<br><b>had no face, no arms, and wasn't walking on any feet. It just glided
down</b>
<br><b>the sidewalk, once it noticed it and it noticed me, it vanished.
It</b>
<br><b>didn't' scare me since I'm so used to ghosts, it most likely wasn't
evil</b>
<br><b>and wasn't going to hurt me, most likely it was a lost soul looking
for</b>
<br><b>its body or its family.</b>
<br><b>I've also very recently noticed a white streak of light, again out
of the</b>
<br><b>corner of my right eye, down at the corner of my neighbor's patio,
once i</b>
<br><b>would see it, it too would vanish. It has been said and I'm waiting
to</b>
<br><b>get all the information, that my complex was built on a graveyard
before</b>
<br><b>Houston was founded in 1836. Most of Houston was built over a graveyard,</b>
<br><b>most people just don't realize it or aren't into the paranormal
as most</b>
<br><b>of us are. Anyway, I believe i have a new ghost or two in my house
that</b>
<br><b>are trying to get some acknowledgement. Yesterday I had knocking
on my</b>
<br><b>front door, I, thinking it was the neighbor, went to answer it,
there was</b>
<br><b>no one there and no one around. Today I discovered that i had been</b>
<br><b>scratched on my leg, this scratch however was a bit deeper than
the usual</b>
<br><b>ones i would get and it drew some blood. Having ghosts in my house
does</b>
<br><b>not terrify me, they just want attention, so quite often I'll talk
to</b>
<br><b>them, ask them questions, they speak to me in my mind, not out loud.
My</b>
<br><b>investigator thinks that if they talk to me out loud that it will
scare</b>
<br><b>me, so i figure as long as they communicate, it's fine. My ghosts
are</b>
<br><b>just lonely or lost, or have lost someone close to them and i intend
to</b>
<br><b>help them anyway i can, because quite frankly, I'm not afraid, and
I love</b>
<br><b>my ghosts, they are my closest friends. Weird huh?</b>
<br><b>Now, for those of you who are scared by these ways of communication,
the</b>
<br><b>best thing to do is to acknowledge that they are there by simply
telling</b>
<br><b>them " I know you are here". A lot of times they will move personal</b>
<br><b>items, scratch you, or you might even get lucky enough to hear them
say</b>
<br><b>something out loud if they really want your attention. A lot of
these</b>
<br><b>ghosts are lonely and just want someone to talk to. Don't feel stupid
by</b>
<br><b>talking to them, or even feel frightened, most will not harm you.
If you</b>
<br><b>are ever harmed very seriously, contact your local paranormal</b>
<br><b>investigators right away. They are there to help you and to help
the</b>
<br><b>spirit(s).</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted Room 11</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Kanawhahaha@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When was 8 years old (3 years ago) I was diagnosed with a hole in
my heart. I had to have surgery the summer of 2001. Well, summer rolled
around. I was having my surgery in Morgantown, West Virginia (about 178
miles from where I live). We headed down to Morgantown July 13th, 2001.
I was having my surgery at Ruby Memorial Hospital on July 15th, 2001. Since
we got down there early we stayed at the Ronald McDonald House right beside
Ruby Memorial. When we got there the employees said they had one room open,
and that was room 11. They said that they have gotten weird reports from
people that stayed in that room, and we asked like what kind of weird things
have happened and they said, "Someone might knock on your door at night
and you go to open it and no ones there." "Someone might call on the telephone
and when you pick the phone up they would say something like I'll be waiting
for you in the Parlor tomorrow and other freaky stuff." We were amazed
by what they said but we decided to take the room anyway. That night I
took my shower, brushed my teeth, got my nightgown on, and hopped into
bed. About 3:00 in the morning the knocking on the door and the phone ringing
started. I didn't get any rest that night. That morning the employees asked
did you have in strange experiences? We said yes. The night after that
was the same. Well, it been 3 years now and I hope to never see that awful
place again!</b>

the list of haunted places in Quebec...I was born in Quebec and some 10
years ago I must have been 15 or 16 we had a party for my granny in the
famous hotel.. being "teenagers" me and my cousins went exploring to find
ourselves stuck in a room decorated with victorian looking furniture and
window drapes.. music playing...a man sittingin a big chair with a high
hat in a black suit staring at us!!! We turned around to find the door
from where we had came from to our dispair it was NOT THERE... we then
took a stair case heading down we saw to the corner of the room ;to end
up behind another stair case (wich was going up)adjascent to a main hallway
somewhere.We all stared at each other afterwards all out of breath questionning
if that REALLy happened and somehow we never talked about it ever again...well
that's my story, nothing nuts just plain strange.. i do not know the history
of the chateau but i do know it's VERY old and creepy too</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Shadow man</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: fairgirl75@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am writing to tell you about the things that have happened in my
grandparent’s house. They moved into the house when I was around 8 years
old. Only one other family had lived in the house but no one had ever died
there. My mother and I lived with them some when I was growing up and so
did my uncle. I used to hear the sliding glass door open and footsteps
go down the hall and one time the pictures in my room seemed to shake and
vibrate on the wall but made no sound at all. My mother used to wake me
up screaming for her daddy in the night (my grandfather). My mom would
say that she saw the shadow of a man watching her. He was broad shouldered,
appeared to be wearing a suit and a hat like they might have worn in the
40’s. My grandmother used to see this figure too. She took my grandfathers
hand and reached out to touch the shadow man with it (my grandfather was
sleeping and she was too scared to use her own hand. Ha!). The thing disappeared
and she says she hasn’t seen the shadow man anymore.</b>
<br><b>One night my cousin stayed all night with me there. We were just
kids but we were lying in bed and heard the piano playing a few notes.
It scared my cousin so bad his mother had to come and get him. My uncle
also heard the piano playing. He was down stairs on the phone with a friend.
No one else was home. He told his friend to hold on, went and got his gun
and went upstairs to investigate. As he was headed up the playing stopped.
He looked thought the whole house and found no one. He went back down stairs
and as soon as he got back on the phone with his friend and sat down the
notes started again. The radio has also been known to come on by itself
full blast. My aunt has thought she has seen someone coming up the stairs
and going down the hall thought a mirror reflection but no one was there.
My grandfather has tried to explain all this away and doesn’t believe anything
is going on. I remember as a kid thinking it was neat that my grandmother
and mother had seen an actual ghost manifest and wishing that I could see
one. I was scared but I was also intrigued and curious.</b>
<br><b>The last think that ever happened to me in that house to date made
me regret ever wishing that I could see a ghost. This was years later.
I was 23 years old. I had graduated college and moved to Charlotte, NC
for a job. Well, I had come back home to East Tennessee to see my family
and stayed all-night at my grandparents house. I was going to sleep in
the room my mother used to sleep in when we lived there. I hadn’t even
thought about the ghost in a long time because the things that would happen
had happened over about a 15 year span and was not that frequent. I hadn’t
heard of anything happening in a long time. I hadn’t been drinking or drugging
or anything like that. I had not watched anything scary on T.V. either.
In fact, I had read the Bible some before going to sleep. When I had finished
reading I laid the Bible on the floor beside my bed and went to sleep.
In the middle of the night I woke up suddenly as if someone had touched
me or something. I looked to the side of my bed and I swear the shadow
man was on his knees kneeling over me beside my bed with is head cocked
to the side looking at me like he wondered how I was or what I was doing
there. He was just so close to my face that it scared me to death. I looked
at him for a second and blinked and he was still there so I screamed and
he disappeared. I jumped up and ran to the kitchen and called my mom and
told her what I had seen. I was crying and panicking and she said,” Say
I rebuke you Satan in the name of Jesus Christ.” I was like,”Oh my gosh
mom! You are freaking me out! He’s not the devil!” Needless to say what
my mom told me wasn’t any help at all. I was so scared I made my grandmother
sleep with me for the rest of the night. I was a grown woman but I was
too scared to sleep alone.</b>
<br><b>I have moved back to Tennessee, married and have 2 girls. I am now
28 years old. I will never forget that as long as I live. I have never
stayed the night there again and I won’t encourage my girls to as they
get older. We visit a lot but anytime I’m alone in that house I am scared
so I don’t stay long alone. I have had several strange experiences in my
life and so have other members of my extended family. I think we may be
sensitive to these things a little bit. This was the most up-close and
personal that I had ever gotten with a ghost. I was scared because he was
so dark and shadowy. I thought he must be evil. I have learned from your
site that just because they appear in shadow form doesn’t mean they are
evil. I am still intrigued by ghost and the paranormal. I would like to
see a ghost again, just not on the home front when you never know quiet
when they will pop up!!</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: Kcraft7732@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I lived there for a short time taking care of a blind friends</b>
<br><b>2 yr. old twins. Their room was down stairs and mine up, so I had
baby moniters so I could</b>
<br><b>hear them through the night. One day I was taking a nap upstairs
and saw some one</b>
<br><b>coming up the stairs. I thought nothing of it until no one ever
reached the top landing. I</b>
<br><b>went to the top and looked down and a large black shadow went over
my head and out the ceiling. That night I heard a baby crying over the
moniter. I went down stairs to check on</b>
<br><b>the kids but they were sound asleep.</b>
<br><b>I turned off the moniter and could here a baby screaming at the
bottom of the stairs. Of</b>
<br><b>Course I had the ibby jibbies by now, but I tried to find this sound.
The crying would switch rooms and when I would open the door to the room
it was in, it would fade to another part of the house.</b>
<br><b>This crying lasted for three days and three nights non stop. I knew
I wasn't crazy when friends came over and they to heard it. My puppy continuously
barked and cried at the corner where I the dark shadow re entered the room.
The 2 year old children even asked where is that baby at, and why is it
crying? I don't know the story of this house, but I moved out the following
week.</b>

<br><b>My Whole Life</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Alisa.Neely@VerizonWireless.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My whole life I have had experiences that were strange and associated
with</b>
<br><b>the paranormal but I was never really sure if I believed that ghosts
were</b>
<br><b>real... until recently.</b>
<br><b>I'm 22 now but it all started when I was 5. My family and I lived
in an old</b>
<br><b>house in Amarillo, TX that I will swear to this day was haunted
by what I</b>
<br><b>called the "Pinching Lady." I would wake up in the middle of the
night and</b>
<br><b>there would be a lady standing next to my bed pinching my arms.
Neither one</b>
<br><b>of my parents believed me until my 16 yr old cousin moved in and
started</b>
<br><b>telling them the same thing. We moved out not long after and it
never</b>
<br><b>happened again. My life was pretty much quiet until I was about
14. We'd</b>
<br><b>moved to WA state and my dad had remarried and had a house built
for the new</b>
<br><b>family. Whenever I was home alone, the toilets would flush by themselves.
It</b>
<br><b>wasn't just the noise a toilet would make when flushing, the water
would</b>
<br><b>actually be twirling down the toilet when I went in to the bathroom.
This</b>
<br><b>went on for about a year then other things started to happen. Something</b>
<br><b>would knock on my bedroom door or throw it open when it was completely
shut.</b>
<br><b>It would open so furiously that it would leave marks on the wall
behind it</b>
<br><b>from the knob. My brother complained that he would wake up in the
middle of</b>
<br><b>the night and there would be someone sitting on his chest.&nbsp;
It was getting</b>
<br><b>so intense that I was afraid that I was going crazy since no one
else seemed</b>
<br><b>to be experiencing the same things. It wasn't until recently that
my father</b>
<br><b>started complaining of the same things (he still lives there.) He
says him</b>
<br><b>and his wife will hear doors opening and closing and people walking
around</b>
<br><b>but there's no one there except for them. One time it was so loud
they</b>
<br><b>called the police because they thought some one had broken in!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Over the years there have been a few other things that have
happened but</b>
<br><b>nothing was as real and scary as last night. We had been at work
talking</b>
<br><b>about ghosts and hauntings when one of my co-workers mentioned a
"ghost"</b>
<br><b>that would turn the radio up in her car and at her mom's house periodically.</b>
<br><b>I joked with her since my apartment already seemed to have some
strange</b>
<br><b>happenings, he could come home with me so he would have some company.
Bad</b>
<br><b>idea..... I was standing in the living room joking with my boyfriend
about</b>
<br><b>it when we heard a deafening pop. We turned around and the entire
glass</b>
<br><b>sliding door had shattered! The dog meanwhile was cowering in the
corner</b>
<br><b>staring down the hall growling and whining as if someone were there.
(He did</b>
<br><b>it all night!) Thinking it was malicious activity by someone in
the</b>
<br><b>neighborhood I called the security patrol and was advised to call
the</b>
<br><b>police. The door was so badly spider webbed that we feared opening
it would</b>
<br><b>cause the pane fall out so we didn't get a good look at the outside
of the</b>
<br><b>door. Once the policeman arrived we discovered the outside pane
was</b>
<br><b>completely intact! Not a scratch or crack anywhere.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;While I had been waiting for the police, my boyfriend had
gone to bed.</b>
<br><b>After the police left I went to crawl into bed and was greeted by
a</b>
<br><b>sarcastic "Thank you" from my boyfriend for rocking the bed to wake
him up.</b>
<br><b>I was amazed since at the time I was supposedly rocking the bed
I was</b>
<br><b>outside with the officer! I called today to make sure that there
was no</b>
<br><b>recorded seismic activity and there was nothing they could come
up with.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;This is not the first time something like this has happened.
Since we've</b>
<br><b>moved in the channels on the TV change when you get up and walk
away, we've</b>
<br><b>both had television remotes thrown at us on separate occasions and
things</b>
<br><b>will go missing and appear later in the most obvious places.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;If there's one thing I've learned from this, it's not wise
to invite</b>
<br><b>ANYTHING home with you.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Haunting in Oz</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dstevens@rascal.com.au</b><b></b>
<p><b>My uncle used to live in an old house in the Adelaide hills in Australia.
This house had a rich history. The house was used as a bakery to feed travelers
between destinations. As a child of nine years I was exited by this house.
It was on a large property and boasted such things as a well and a small
creek where I used to catch frogs. This house obviously had quite a story
to tell for my family had many experiences. Apart from some strange noises
things also appeared in front of us. As kids would normally do when visiting
a new place, we explored. After finding a large room with nothing in it
but two wardrobes we thought we would pry. Looking in the first wardrobe,
nothing could be seen. But in the second, a beautiful wedding dress was
hung up. Sensing wedding bells we closed the cupboard to talk to my uncle.
After turning our back on the wardrobe a large thud seemed to hit it but
we thought nothing of it. After speaking to my uncle and seeing the stunned
look on his face we convinced him to come and take a look. He opened the
wardrobe and peered inside. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Thinking we made
a mistake we looked in the next and again completely empty. We thought
nothing of it until recently and decided to talk to my family about it.
They were not surprised because they had their own stories to tell. After
having a lovely dinner at my uncle’s house, granddad decided to take the
hour long trip home. During the car ride, he recalled often hearing voices
in his back seat but of course thought nothing of it. After returning home
he went to bed. At 3am the next morning my grandmother woke to hearing
crying coming from the lounge room. Sitting by her husband of close to
forty years she asked what’s wrong. “I must save Michael (my uncle)”, he
shouted “he is in danger I must save him. The next day my granddad was
scared to tell people what had happened. As a veteran of the Scottish armed
forces, it was embarrassing for him to cry.</b>
<br><b>Not only did this house effect family members but also a family
pet. My uncle owned a large pure bred boxer. This dog was afraid of nothing
and was an excellent guard dog. After spending time at the house it began
to act strangely. It used to quiver in corners, bark at walls and urinate
it self which he had never done before. My uncle moved out as soon as possible
and has never looked back</b><b></b>

<br><b>Cornwallis (ghost Story)</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mariejfox@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Cornwallis is a massive 200 year old home&nbsp; within walking distance
from Halifax harbour,which in the opinion of many is one of the hottest
spots for hauntings in Eastern Canada.Think about it!!!It was here where
the`infamous Halifax Explosion happened,killing thousands of innocents
in mere minutes,it is here where the bloated bodies from the ill-fated
Titanic washed ashore to find rest in one of the oldest cities in north
america.</b>
<br><b>It was here that I moved to for the first time on my own to pursue
painting at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design.I arrived in a rush
to start school during the January semester,in the middle of a howling
ice storm.My parents and I didnt have much time to waste in finding a place,
and after looking at many dingy over-priced rooms we snatched up the room
on Cornwallis street with much relief.My room was vast,with high ceilings,
tall elegant windows,a beautiful elaborate fireplace and hardwood floors.All
the rooms in the house were like this and filled with other art students.My
best friend (who came with us ) was to stay the first night with me and
we were very excited.But of course we both felt a little uneasy about the
place,having grown up in bright cheery modern homes.But I was determined
to not ruin it for myself so I ignored the unease.We chatted&nbsp; for
awhile,when all of a sudden she pointed to the ceiling and said 'Did you
just see that!!!!"</b>
<br><b>My heart almost stopped.'Whhat' I said angrily</b>
<br><b>"Dont you see the huge moth???"She asked in wonder....</b>
<br><b>I didnt see anything no matter how hard I tried.This apparent moth
was supposedly circling furiosly above our heads on the ceiling,in the
dead of winter and I couldnt see it.Great.</b>
<br><b>The next day my parents and my friend deperted.</b>
<br><b>A major snowstorm was happening so I coudnt even leave the house
for 3 days.I was very depressed and homesick and the following events did
not help.</b>
<br><b>On the first night on my own I could not get to sleep.I started
coughing alot and I felt freezing cold one minute and was sweating with
fever the next.The hairs on my began to stand on end so I turned on some
Vivaldi , low volume to calm my nerves.I even tried to do some sketches
,but I could feel out the corner of my eye that next to the fireplace something
wasnt the same.....</b>
<br><b>I concentrated furiosly on my drawing and refused to look up,even
while the music was beginnig to distort,the violins slowing while the harpsichord
sped faster.....Finally when I did look up I saw I long dark column wavering
distorting with the music in front of the fireplace.I couldnt breathe.</b>
<br><b>I think I must have blacked out,for I awoke the following morning
quite sick.</b>
<br><b>Many such eerie occurences occured the rest of the semester,many
perhaps more alarming than that one.Perhaps I will send in more sometime.</b>

<p><b>Something about The Marshfield County Hospital</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: critters_world@charter.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I happened upon your sight tonight, when on a whim, decided to look
up ghost stories of Wisconsin.&nbsp; I read the short piece on the old
Marshfield County Hospital.&nbsp; Just wanted to add a little bit I know
about the old hospital (aka: Norwood Hospital).</b>
<br><b>To let you know the source of this story, I had a teacher in high
school who's husband was a doctor turned parapsychologist (believe his
name was Dr. Tierney).&nbsp; During her "Death" unit in her English class,
she would bring in her husband to tell us a few of the sighting he had
investigated.</b>
<br><b>He told the story of the Old Norwood Mental Hospital.&nbsp; A doctor
and personal friend of Dr. Tierney had relayed a story of what had happened
to him while working at this old hospital.&nbsp; The story is as follows:</b>
<br><b>The doctor had worked long at the hospital when he started hearing
patients tell stories.&nbsp; They would tell of hearing strange voices,
seeing shadows, feeling as if someone was there.&nbsp; Well, it was a mental
hospital after all, so he dismissed the claims.</b>
<br><b>Sidenote:&nbsp; To describe Norwood (which was recently destroyed
due to the Highway 10 bypass project) it looked like an old sandstone-colored
castle.&nbsp; It was a creepy place to go even after the place had closed
do and places like the Salvation Army and other various businesses would
hold auctions, flea markets and sales.&nbsp; I used to go there with my
parents after the facility was closed, so I was up close and personal.</b>
<br><b>Okay, back to the story:</b>
<br><b>The hospital had series of hallways beneath the facility that would
lead to rooms for storage and utilities (heating and plumbing).&nbsp; These
tunnels were only accessible by administration and staff.&nbsp; A room
would mark the end of a hallway, with no way out.&nbsp; That way, if a
patient did get down there, there was no way out and they were trapped.&nbsp;
These hallways were also sparsely lit.</b>
<br><b>Working a late shift one night, he needed to go down to the records
room.&nbsp; The room at the end of a particularly long hallway.&nbsp; The
lights where spaced far apart and allowed many shadows.&nbsp; Walking down
the hallway, the doctor thought he saw someone standing against the wall
need the door to the records room.</b>
<br><b>On closer inspection, he recognized the form of that of "Joe" the
janitor.&nbsp; He called out in greeting to Joe and asked him what he was
doing down there.&nbsp; The shadow then just detached itself from the wall
as if to face the doctor, it turned, then walked into the wall.</b>
<br><b>The doctor was quite shocked by this, and just a bit shaken.&nbsp;
After a moment he dismissed it as an overactive imagination from working
long hours.&nbsp; He continued down the hallway, but as he closed on the
door, he started getting a feeling of dread.&nbsp; The closer to the door,
the worse it became.&nbsp; His heart pounding and his body sweating, he
forced himself to reach for the door knob.&nbsp; He turned the knob and
the door wouldn't budge.&nbsp; He starting forcing the door open and it
felt as if a wild wind pushed out of the room.&nbsp; After forcing the
door open a few inches, a voice screamed, "GET OUT!" and the door slammed
shut.</b>
<br><b>The doctor, taking a hint, ran for his life.&nbsp; He sat in his
office for quite a while trying to gather himself over a cup of coffee.&nbsp;
Finally, he decided that the hospital was starting to get to him.&nbsp;
He had to go back down to the room to prove to himself that he wasn't going
crazy.</b>
<br><b>Slowly he walked down the hallway and reached the door without incident.&nbsp;
He reached for the door, turned the knob, and quickly threw the door open
and flipped on the light switch.&nbsp; NOTHING!&nbsp; Nothing happened
and nothing was disturbed in the room.&nbsp; He thought with all the wind
he had experienced from the room, the place would be a mess.&nbsp; Everything
was where it was supposed to be.&nbsp; He quickly gathered what he needed
and left the room vowing not to anyone about the incident.&nbsp; After
all, crazy things like that were the reason people were locked up there
in the first place.</b>
<br><b>A month or so later, the doctor was coming in on his morning shift
when one of his fellow workers quickly pulled him aside.&nbsp; "You will
never believe what happened to me last night down in the records room!"
the worker exclaimed.</b>
<br><b>The doctor replied, "Try me."</b>
<br><b>The co-worker went on to tell the doctor and amazing story that
almost duplicated the doctor's experience.&nbsp; Then the doctor came out
and told the co-worker of his experience.&nbsp; The co-worker was very
relieved and was happy they were not going crazy.</b>
<br><b>There was one thing missing from the co-worker's story though and
asked the co-worker about it.</b>
<br><b>"Before this all happened, did you see anything?&nbsp; I thought
I say Joe, the old janitor, standing in the hallway by the door."&nbsp;
The proceeded to tell the co-worker about the shadow walking through the
wall.</b>
<br><b>The co-worker explained that they had not seen a shadow, but that
is possibly had been Joe.&nbsp; Joe had hung himself in the boiler room
down there several months before.</b>
<br><b>Hence the Haunting of Norwood Hospital.</b>
<br><b>I hope you find the story interesting.&nbsp; I have several other
stories I have looked into in Stevens Point, and even more I have experienced.</b>
<br><b>Stevens Point seems like a hotbed of ghost stories.&nbsp; Just will
give a little overview of a couple of them:</b>
<br><b>The legless man of Lynwood:&nbsp; A short man in a turn of the century
suite stands along side of County Truck P near dusk when the fog covers
the roads.&nbsp; He waves down people while holding a bouquet of flower,
asking passersby where his wife is buried.</b>
<br><b>Calvin Blood:&nbsp; I've heard several stories for a background
to this haunting, but it is says this haunting is by a man once named Calvin
Blood.&nbsp; Blood at one time was a popular name in portage county like
Jones or Smith.&nbsp; The haunting itself takes place in a cemetery along
the Wisconsin River off of West River Drive.&nbsp; I found a police report
in Stevens Point's old library about an incident happening to a couple
of officers investigating a call of kids in the cemetery.</b>
<br><b>To make a long story short on this one, supposedly a blob of light
and fog comes out from behind Calvin's grave stone, shutting off all power
to vehicles and lights, it envelopes a vehicle, and then just vanishes
restoring all power to the vehicle.</b>
<br><b>Now this cemetery is watched by a keeper who doesn't like anybody
coming into the cemetery at night.&nbsp; And also heard from another of
my teachers that Calvin Blood's remains were moved to an island out in
the river behind the cemetery.&nbsp; There are 30 or 40 graves there that
are unmarked.&nbsp; Remains were moved there to keep people from going
after the bodies.&nbsp; He told of the only two people lynched in Portage
county that are buried there.&nbsp; Two brothers that raped and murdered
a girl early in the town's history and were hung in the town square.&nbsp;
Another buried there was a former sheriff that were hated by may in the
town.&nbsp; One night, someone hung the sheriff from the maple tree in
his front yard.&nbsp; For years, on the anniversary of his death, people
would dig up his remains and hang them from the tree, hence the reason
for hiding his remains.</b>
<br><b>If interested, I'll give you a few more stories I know from the
Stevens Point/Plover and surrounding area, both publicly know and a few
private ones.</b><b></b>

<p><b>I Thought I was Dreaming</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: n8vbelle@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Since, I was a little girl.&nbsp; I had always seen and heard things.&nbsp;
We in the southwest part of New Mexico.&nbsp; Lived in a newly built house.&nbsp;
So you would think that there would be no ghost.&nbsp; I remember first
encounter.&nbsp; I was 6-7 yrs old.&nbsp; My 3 brothers were out with our
cousin.&nbsp; My parents were sleeping in their bedroom.&nbsp; I was woke
up to laughter in the kitchen.&nbsp; I heard the music from the old west
and people laughing, smelling of smoke (no one in our family smokes.),&nbsp;
and lots of talking.&nbsp; I thought that I was still dreaming.&nbsp; At
this point I knew that I was awake.&nbsp; I called out my brothers name
and I heard a voice of a man say "SSHHH!!&nbsp; She is up.&nbsp; I told
you guys that we would wake her up!"&nbsp; I got out of the bed.&nbsp;
I approched the door.&nbsp; The voice said again.&nbsp; "I think she went
back to bed.&nbsp; But keep it down.&nbsp; We don't want her to know that
we are here."&nbsp; When I got to the door of my room.&nbsp; I in turn
said.&nbsp; "Hey you guys!&nbsp; I'm awake now.&nbsp; Here I come."&nbsp;
I looked in the kitchen.&nbsp; There was nothing there.&nbsp; I got this
eerie feeling along the cold air.&nbsp; I stood there and felt this brush
on my arm and knew I was not alone.&nbsp; From then on I always have "the
feeling".&nbsp; I have experienced alot more since then.&nbsp; Even to
this day I see and hear things that no one else can.&nbsp; I think I even
passed it on to my 2 kids.</b>

<p><b>An Invisible Guest</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: harry.engerer@sympatico.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>This incident happened about 12 years ago at the apartment my wife
and I shared before kids. She had lived there for several years before
we met and nothing like this had ever happened to her. On Saturdays I worked
till 1:00 pm and would come home, have a snack then the two of us generally
would go to our bedroom at the far end of the apartment down a long hall
past 2 other bedrooms for a "nap"&nbsp; It was very quiet at this end of
the apartment and it kind of became a ritual with us.</b>
<br><b>The bedroom was laid out with the bed diagonally opposite the doorway,
the windows faced west so the summer afternoon sun was streaming into the
bedroom giving a very warm comfortable feeling. (this incident happened
in late July in Toronto. Normally hot)</b>
<br><b>On this particular day we had just begun to doze off, we were lying
on our right sides. I was behind my wife both of us facing the door when
I felt the normal summer heat rapidly diminish at the same time I could
feel her begin to tense up. ( Deb could sleep through a hurricane) My arm
was lying along her arm up to her shoulder and as I opened my eyes I was
able to watch as the hair on my arm stood up. I was looking towards the
door and watched as what appeared to be a watery translucent image appear
at the door to the bedroom. The temperature in the room was unbelievably
cold at this point and I asked Deb "do you see that" she said "I feel it"
At this point I got up and said aloud "we're leaving lets go" as soon as
we passed the doorway of the room,we had to pass this thing 1st,&nbsp;
but it seemed it wasn't there any more the temperature rose dramatically.We
went to the balcony where the full force of the afternoon sun was and just
stood there for what seemed like an hour. When we went back in all seemed
normal.</b>
<br><b>We moved out soon after and it never happened again but to this
day my wife refuses to acknowledge the incident,she fears these things
quite a bit. However when we talk about it, just the two of us she says
the same thing " I didn't see it but I did feel it"</b>

<p><b>Intruder in the House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Bustingthugs@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I really love this site and want to share this story,&nbsp; My mother
and I and my brother were watching Tv in our living room back in the mid
1960's one night while my father was at work. We had this pet toy poodle
that stayed in the house who at the time was laying on the floor at the
edge of our couch while we watched television.</b>
<br><b>My mother had a real close friend who had often visited us with
her husband and lived not to far away. As we watched Tv our dog all of
a sudden jumped up and started to growl and was focusing on something or
someone down the hallway, it was dark and we could not see what he was
growling at, but what ever it was it really shook up our dog because he
was backing up and shivering and growling in real fear of what ever it
was.</b>
<br><b>My mother jumped up off the couch and turned on the lights but there
was no one there. I remember her calling my father at work complaining
that there must have been a prowler around the house and told him to come
home because she was afraid.</b>
<br><b>My mother had no sooner hung up the phone and then the phone rang
and she answered it. On the other end of the phone was my mothers best
friend who was screaming and crying that her husband had just shot himself
in the head and was dead.</b>
<br><b>I was very young and the incident happened along time ago but I
still get goose bumps hearing the story from my mother when she tells it
to others.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghosts Spirits and Angels</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Mysticwch@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi, my name is Becky</b>
<br><b>I have lived with spirits around me for the better part of my life.&nbsp;
I am, I guess you would say sensitive to them.&nbsp; I, for the most part,
have had only good experiences and really do not mind them being in my
life with me.&nbsp; It is nice to know you have someone around even if
you can't see them all of the time.</b>
<br><b>When I was 7 years old my brother moved into a house that had so
much activity in it that it was next to impossible to keep any one living
there for longer than 3 or 4 months.&nbsp; My brother and his family was
no exception.&nbsp; The first day they moved in things started happening.&nbsp;
In the dining room of the house (by the way this was in 1965 and the house
was built in the 20's or 30's if I remember rightly)&nbsp; there were 2
crystal chandeliers, not real big ones but impressive.&nbsp; One was a
pinkish color and the other a blue.&nbsp; My brother had put his rocking
chair in there and sat down under one of them to read a book.&nbsp; In
just a few minutes it started to swing back and forth and around in circles
and then turned off, at the same moment it went off the other one came
on.&nbsp; He moved under the other one and had the same thing happen.&nbsp;
This went on a few more times till he finally gave up and said, out loud,
"Ok you win, I'll go to bed."&nbsp; With that they both came on, off, on,
off, on and off one more time and stayed off.&nbsp; He went to bed.&nbsp;
Two or three days later my mom and I went over to see them and watch my
neqhews.&nbsp; It was a warm day and in So. California at that time not
many people had air conditioners.&nbsp; My brother and his wife went to
do some shopping for house stuff I guess and we, my mom, myself and my
two nephews went into the backyard.&nbsp; I don't remember what we were
doing, I guess me and my neqhews were playing, since I am just a few years,
3 or 4, older then them.&nbsp; We weren't outside long when we heard doors
slamming inside of the house.&nbsp; The windows in the house had been painted
shut and the front door was closed.&nbsp; There was also no breeze that
day.&nbsp; My mom thought that they had forgot something and came back
so she went inside.&nbsp; When she came back out she said it wasn't them
and didn't know what it was.&nbsp; My brother had forgot to tell us about
the ghosts.&nbsp; A little while later it happened again this time I went
inside with her and we looked around, nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; It happened
a few more times that afternoon but after the second time we didn't go
back in.&nbsp; We just waited in the back yard till they got home.&nbsp;
My mom told them what had been happening all day and my brother just laughed
and said, "oh yeah I forgot to tell you that it is haunted."</b>
<br><b>I ended up staying the night there that night because my mom was
going out and had to sleep in the dining room on a fold up bed.&nbsp; I
had been calling the spirit or spirits a name all evening.&nbsp; Being
a kid it was Casper the unfriendly ghost.&nbsp; When it was time to go
to bed I met my first spirit buddy.&nbsp; I heard what sounded like footsteps
coming out of the kitchen into the dining room.&nbsp; I did what any smart
7 year old would have done to protect myself, I pulled the blankets over
my head.&nbsp; I felt someone sit on the bed next to my right thigh.&nbsp;
I started to peek out when a man, whose voice I did not know, spoke to
me.&nbsp; He told me his name was not casper&nbsp; that it was Johnney
and he was not unfriendly.&nbsp; He also said he was not alone.&nbsp; The
pressure against my thigh left and I took a quick peek.&nbsp; Covers pulled
back up over my head I laid there for a long time finally going to sleep.</b>
<br><b>Johnney and, I guess his wife, girlfriend , whatever she was to
him, ended up with me when my brother moved out.&nbsp; They let them selves
be known when they got mad at me or if someone doubted they exsisted.&nbsp;
You know throwing things around or picking things up for all to see and
moving them across the room and setting them down nice and easy.&nbsp;
When my mom and I had been gone and came back home, you could sometimes
hear them inside the house arguing.&nbsp; As soon as the key went into
the lock all would become quite.</b>
<br><b>Like I said when my brother moved out of the house they came with
me.&nbsp; Well when my brother moved out they tore the house down a month
later.&nbsp; In my neqhews room at the foot of Randy's, (Lee the oldest,
Randy the youngest at the time) was a cold spot almost freezing cold it
seemed.&nbsp; In the living room was a fire place that had been bricked
in there was a cold spot just to the left side of it.&nbsp; Out in the
side yard was a Weeping Willow and under it was another cold spot.&nbsp;
When they tore down the house and dug up the land they found 4 bodies,
or what was left anyway, 2 in the bedroom about 5 feet under, one in the
wall beside the old fire place, and one buried under the Weeping Willow.</b>
<br><b>I still feel Johnney around sometimes though not as often as when
I was younger and till my late twenties.&nbsp; I have also picked up some
hitchhikers over the years.</b>
<br><b>I my self now live in an old mobile home that has been added on
to.&nbsp; The couple that lived here before me are now both passed.&nbsp;
He loved this place and I am told he was very happy here.&nbsp; I guess
so because he showed himself to me about 2 months ago and is still hanging
out.&nbsp; His name is Woody.</b>
<br><b>Like I said I don't mind the company.&nbsp; I have had alot of other
things happen in different houses I have lived in.&nbsp; From a woman that
haunted one place in which her husband had killed her.&nbsp; She hated
men and would pretty regularly hurt or try to kill my husband.&nbsp; Another
placed an elderly black man had a heartattack in the bathroom that seperated
the two bedrooms.&nbsp; It got to the point that my daughter, Erica, she
was also 7 years old when this happened, could not go into the bathroom
alone.&nbsp; If she did he would start whispering in her ear and if she
tried to take a bath with the curtain closed he would reach around the
curtain, she saw his hand, and open it up and she would come out screaming.&nbsp;
He also liked to rub my leg at night while I slept.&nbsp; It would wake
me up.&nbsp; I finally told him he had died and needed to go on to his
next life.&nbsp; That his work here was done.&nbsp; He didn't leave but
he did mellow out.</b>
<br><b>I have also met angels.&nbsp; When my brother died, I was 15 then
and he was 31.&nbsp; I met my gaurdian angle.&nbsp; His name is Corinthian.&nbsp;
That is a whole other story though and quite long.</b>
<br><b>I wish you all well and hope you have a good day.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghost Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Dreamer7392@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have a graveyard across the street from my house. I'm only 11 but
I have a lot of experiences to tell you about. I'll tell you them in order.
They range from when I was 8 to now.</b>
<br><b>When I was six years old, my sister (13-14 at the time), and I were
the only ones home. We were sitting in the living room and we smelled something
coming the kitchen. The stove had turned on and was melting a pan on the
top of the stove!</b>
<br><b>A year later, we moved into a different part of our house. (its
split into four parts). I was doing the dishes and was drying a pan. I
had my back tunred towards the sink. I heard a click and i noticed that
the kitchen suddenly got a lot brighter. The light above the kitchen sink
had been turned on.</b>
<br><b>A couple days after that, my sister was sitting at the table, studying.
She noticed it got brighter in the kitchen and she felt a chill. She looked
and the light had been turned on.</b>
<br><b>The next moring after my sisters incident, she was making coffee
in the kitchen. She went into the lving room because I had wanted to ask
her something. We both heard a chink and went into the kitchen. The spoon
my sister had place fully in the cup, had been placed next to it, in the
short 5 seconds my sister had exited the room.</b>
<br><b>It was peaceful until about 6 months (I was ten) after the cup incident,
my sister and I were standing at the kitchen sink and my cat came running
into the kitch and whirled around and hissed at something and a door slammed
shut behind her. There had been noone in the house and no wind when this
happened.</b>
<br><b>A couple weeks after this, everyone had gone to school, except my
mother and father, who had the day off. They went shopping and came home.
My mother was looking out the window and saw my cat (indoor) run across
the lawn. She went to check every window, and found one had been pushed
open. My sister and I came home from school, and my mother told us about
that. We went to look at the window, which my dad had shut tight, and found
it was shoved open again.</b>
<br><b>2 months after this, I was in my room, brushing my hair. I went
outside to check to see if my friend had arrived yet, and went back in
my room. It was exceptionly cold in my room, when it hadn't been before,
and I found my brush all the way across my room., and noone was home.</b>
<br><b>A couple days after this, I was talking on the phone with one of
my friends, and&nbsp; I passed the bathroom. I heard a thump, and a tissue
box and fallen from the top of the toilet, to the floor, some 6 feet away
from the toilet.</b>
<br><b>A year later, (I was 11), I heard knocking on my door, and someone
moving the beads in front of them. I walked to my door and pulled it open.
Noone was there.</b>
<br><b>Later that day, I was sitting in my room, listening to music, and
my computer moniter shut off. I have no sleep timer or anything on it.</b>
<br><b>The next day, I woke up, after a nightmare, and I turned on my TV.
The remote was laying 1 foot away from me, and I hadn't moved, yet my TV
turned off.</b>
<br><b>Then, yesterday, I was talking on the phone to my friend Cori, and
I was absently looking out to the graveyard, when I noticed something odd.
There was a man, that I could see through, kneeling at a grave, dressed
in 19th century clothing. Thatwas actually the first time I had seen a
ghost. Chills shot up and down my spine and I ran inside.</b>
<br><b>These are all true experiences. I find the time span of them a bit
puzzling, but they all happened. There are many more to come, I'm sure.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted Visit</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I was visiting in lebanon, tenness from August 27, 2002 - December,
2002</b>
<br><b>i was staying with an elderly couple&nbsp; next to a cemetary.&nbsp;
one night besides all the other strange happenings, i was sitting up againt
the cushions on a made out sofa bed and all their cats started going crazy
and i looked to my left down the hall way and right in front of their bedroom
door was a little girl about 8 years old with long blonde hair and a ankle
length white dress with bloomers and black shoes holding her hand in front
of her.</b>
<br><b>then a few days later the elderly lady showed me a clock she had
and it didn't work in many many years.&nbsp; then one night about 3 a.m.
it started working.&nbsp; it would also be hot in the house and you could
get up and walk toward the hall and there was a spot that was very cold.</b>
<br><b>There are three families that live on that land by the cemetary,
and they all have ghost stories.</b>

<br><b>Family Tradition</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: teapot@sasktel.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For many years now, my mother and I have been
experiencing some very</b>
<br><b>interesting paranormal activity in our home.&nbsp; It is my belief
that my</b>
<br><b>house is haunted by several spirits.&nbsp; The most active of which
is</b>
<br><b>possibly a cat.&nbsp; As this is a farmhouse and many cats have
died both</b>
<br><b>within the house and on the farm, I can't be specific as to which
cat.</b>
<br><b>It is dark brown or black in colour with a slightly angular face.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>have seen this spirit 'running' past doorways and peeking around
corners</b>
<br><b>at me.&nbsp; If I leave my bedroom door open at night, the spirit
will jump</b>
<br><b>on my bed waking me from a sound sleep.&nbsp; I don't feel any threat
from</b>
<br><b>this spirit, possibly because it doesn't bother me nearly as much
as it</b>
<br><b>does my mother.&nbsp; Several evenings spent relaxing in front of
the TV have</b>
<br><b>been disturbed by this enitity touching my mother on the shoulder
or</b>
<br><b>face.&nbsp; My nine-year-old niece and I were sitting at the kitchen
table,</b>
<br><b>talking, when she jumped and exclaimed "What was that?"&nbsp; She
explained</b>
<br><b>that she had seen something small and black running past the hall</b>
<br><b>doorway.&nbsp; It seems that the women in my family are a little
more</b>
<br><b>sensitive than most.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another spirit I have seen may be a late relative.&nbsp;
My great-uncle</b>
<br><b>passed away in the early sixties.&nbsp; All my life, I have seen
a man</b>
<br><b>wearing a brown suit and a derby style hat standing on the landing
or on</b>
<br><b>the stairs to the basement.&nbsp; This bothered me because this
house was</b>
<br><b>built in 1968.&nbsp; Only recently did I discover that the basement
stairs</b>
<br><b>were taken from an old farmhouse that stood on this site since 1908.</b>
<br><b>That was the year my great-grandparents came to Canada and settled
on</b>
<br><b>this homestead.</b><b></b>

<p><b>A Creepy True Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: april84@excite.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mom used to live in Little Rock, AR.
in the River Walk apartments. When they went to look at the apartments
this really nice lady helped her pick out this huge apartment that used
to belong to a handicapped man who lived by himself but died recently.
My mom took that one because it was the cheapest, wonder why. Well once
she got moved in lots of weird stuff started happening, first that really
nice lady had died in a really bad car accident about 2 or 3 weeks after
my mom moved in. It gets weirder though, my mom was cleaning one day and
she turned the cold water of in the kitchen and went to the back of the
house in her bedroom to do something and the hot water was on well she
turned that off and went back to her room and the water was back on! She
was home by herself that day so that had to have scared her allot. About
a week after that her dog, which is usually really quiet, starts yelping
and turning around allot like someone had grabbed her tail or something.
This happened allot too, her and my step-dad would get up every morning
and stuff would be missing like candles or newspapers and sometimes my
video games. One morning I got up, I thought this was a trick, and found
a huge pyramid of toilet paper rolls stacked up on the dining room table!
I</b>
<br><b>sked my mom about it later and she said neither her or my step-dad
had did it. And every morning when I woke up to go to my bathroom and brush
my teeth and hair and stuff my floor would be really wet, and the maintenance
man said there was nothing wrong with the plumbing. The last really weird
thing that happened was the night before they were going to move they had
just got the truck there but it was late so they went to bed without putting
anything in the truck. They woke up the next morning and a lot of the boxes
were in the truck! Thanks for taking the time to read this story</b><b></b>

<br><b>_Where do I Begin?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hgeddie@mts.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi there.&nbsp; I am writing to you because there are a lot of strange
things that have happened in my life.</b>
<br><b>First of all, I am empathic.&nbsp; I pick up on things that normal
people don't.&nbsp; I can walk into a room and know it's history.&nbsp;
I have dreams that come true.&nbsp; I pick up on peoples thoughts and emotions.&nbsp;
To me it is not suprising that I live in an apartment with a ghost.</b>
<br><b>Firtst the empathic things.&nbsp; I used to work at a home for seniors.&nbsp;
A lot of our people were there to die.&nbsp; One lady comes to mind.&nbsp;
I met her the day she came in.&nbsp; I was assigned to get her room ready
and to help her settle in.&nbsp; I knew she had cancer of the ovaries and
that's about all.&nbsp; I met her daughter and son in law first, then she
came in on a stretcher.&nbsp; I helped the EMS team transfer her to bed
and when she was safe I shook her hand.&nbsp; The worst pain I have ever
felt in my life pased thru my lower abdominal area the second I touched
her.&nbsp; I was feeling her pain.&nbsp; I have no idea how she managed
to stay so cheerful and pleasant in that much pain.&nbsp; It happened at
least 8-10 times in the 3 months she was with us.</b>
<br><b>Another time I was with a resident as she was dying.&nbsp; I was
asked to stay in the room with her until the family came.&nbsp; She died
before they got there.&nbsp; I went to get our D O N who pronounced her
dead and then procedded to wash her up and dress the body in something
nice.&nbsp; I was working with another aide and I got this feeling we were
being watched.&nbsp; That feeling was confirmed when I felt something cold
settle right beside my left arm, it stayed there until we were done dressing
her.&nbsp; My partner was about to leave when she felt something cold brush
against her arm.&nbsp; She gasped, and I smiled at her.&nbsp; I said "I
think she's still here."&nbsp; That was all it took for me to be left alone
with a dead body.&nbsp; When the family showed up, I hugged the son and
daughter in law.&nbsp; The husband came in a few minutes later.&nbsp; As
we were all standing by her bed talking about her and the arrangements
for the funeral, the bedside lamp flickered rapidly a few times.&nbsp;
The husband looked to his right and rubbed his arms, then he touched his
face.&nbsp; He told us he felt cold on his cheek and like something cold
was holding his hand for a moment.&nbsp; Then it was gone.&nbsp; I felt
she was gone.&nbsp; I looked at the husband and said, " I think she just
said goodbye."&nbsp; She used to brush her hand across his cheek and hold
his hand.&nbsp; They had been married for 66 years.&nbsp; I would have
dreams about patients to.&nbsp; In life these were people who were in a
vegatative state, or wheel chair bound, or who couldn't talk.&nbsp; In
my dreams they were well and healthy and doing things like eating icecream
or getting their hair done.&nbsp; I once had an entire conversation about
cats with one ;ady in a dream.&nbsp; This woman couldn't talk, she'd had
a stroke.&nbsp; Always, within 2 days of these dreams sometimes on the
night I had them, these patients would have passed away.&nbsp; I only got
it wrong once, and that is because the woman slipped into a coma for 6
days before she passed.&nbsp; She died an hour after the great grandaughter
showed up with her baby that was 5 days old.&nbsp; They placed the baby
beside her great-great grandmother, took a picture and then when they left
an hour later, she died.&nbsp; I felt priveledged to be in the room with
her when she passed.&nbsp; We all believe she was waiting to "see" the
baby before she passed on.</b>
<br><b>Now it doesn't suprise me or scare me that we are living in an apartment
that still houses its previous tenant.&nbsp; About 5 years ago the woman
who lived here for 20 years died in her sleep.&nbsp; The story we got from
other tenants was that she was found the next day by her son who came to
take her shopping.</b>
<br><b>She made her presence known only after I had settled down into my
bedroom, which is the master bedroom and was hers..&nbsp; She does little
things like sitting on the edge of my bed, or brush the hair off my neck
and sigh in my ear.&nbsp; I have also had my hip nudged several times and
feel almost nightly someone sitting down on the edge of my bed.&nbsp; Our
cats know she is there.&nbsp; Sometimes they will look up at absolutely
nothing and make the half purr half meow they use to greet us.&nbsp; Sitting
in the living room, we will see someone walk down the hall when there is
no one there.&nbsp; My bedroom door opens on its own, my closet door will
get closed if it is open.&nbsp; I don't like the cats to go in there.&nbsp;
At first I was bothered by all this, but I had a "talk" with her.&nbsp;
I just asked her if it would be possible to live in peace with her.&nbsp;
Apparently she likes that idea.</b>
<br><b>My last and most memorable experience was the night my grandfather
died.&nbsp; I woke up to a dark quiet room with a feeling of anticipation.&nbsp;
From no where my grandfather was standing beside my bed and he was smiling.&nbsp;
He winked at me and said,"I'm going now, I love you."&nbsp; He reached
out his hand and I reached towards him.&nbsp; He vanished before I could
touch him.&nbsp; I found out that he had finally passed away after months
with cancer at about 3am.</b>
<br><b>More things than I can possibly write here have happened to me.&nbsp;
I am a strong empath and it gets stronger every year that I am alive.&nbsp;
I wouldn't change it for anything.</b>

<p><b>St. Andrews Tower Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kbremer@optonline.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Over the many years of my 29 year old life, I have encountered many
ghosts</b>
<br><b>and strange phenomina. My mother used to tell me it was because
I had old</b>
<br><b>celt blood running through my veins and the gift has been passed
down</b>
<br><b>through generation after generation.&nbsp; The story I am about
to tell is by far</b>
<br><b>one of my best encounters ever and to this day I love telling it
to all who</b>
<br><b>ask.</b>
<br><b>Back in February of 2000 I went on a trip with a group of friends
to</b>
<br><b>Scotland. I was excited because I could finally meet my long distance</b>
<br><b>cousins over there and do some major sight seeing. Well one of the
stops was</b>
<br><b>the quiet college town of St. Andrews reknowned for their golf courses.</b>
<br><b>There they have the ruins of an old Cathedral with a cemetary which
you can</b>
<br><b>walk around. Also there is a lone tower which you can climb up and
get a</b>
<br><b>wonderful view of the town and sea scape. It was in the tower that
I had my</b>
<br><b>experience.</b>
<br><b>I went in with a group of my girlfiends and decided to be the last
one</b>
<br><b>beacuse I have a hard time navigating up spiral staircases. And
this</b>
<br><b>staircase was intimidating to say the least. I started out ok. Holding
onto</b>
<br><b>both sides with my friend directly infront of me. Then the virtigo
kicked in</b>
<br><b>and I started to get scared so I started climbing on my hands and
knees. I</b>
<br><b>started to feel really scared like I wasn't going to be able to
make it to</b>
<br><b>the top and by this time my friends had left me in the dust. So
I stopped on</b>
<br><b>the stairs and was literally on the verge of tears because I was
alone and</b>
<br><b>god forbid if I fall no would know. So I couldn't go forward nor
backwards.</b>
<br><b>It was then I heard a man's voice with the Scottish accent go as
clear as</b>
<br><b>day "C'mon up!".&nbsp; I yelled "wait for me!" "Don't leave me".
He then said it</b>
<br><b>again and it sounded like he was just around the bend from me so
I started</b>
<br><b>heading up the whole time expecting to see him as I turned each
corner.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>kept coaxing me around each corner until I hit the top of the tower.
I was</b>
<br><b>there that I found all of my girlfriends standing looking at the
view. I</b>
<br><b>then started looking for another staircase that the guide as I call
him</b>
<br><b>might have gone down but it turned out that I was standing in the
only</b>
<br><b>entrance to the only staircase. There was no male figure up there
any where.</b>
<br><b>I then got lost in the view and it stood out in the back of my mind
but for</b>
<br><b>that moment i got lost in the beauty of the town and landscape.
I made it</b>
<br><b>down the stairs much better then going up.(basically I slid the
whole way</b>
<br><b>down on my rear). But it wasn't until a couple of days later that
I bought a</b>
<br><b>book for my older brother called Scottish Ghosts. I was reading
it in the</b>
<br><b>back of the bus when I happened across the story about the St. Andrew&nbsp;
Rules</b>
<br><b>Tower, it went on to say that it was haunted by a kindly spirit
of a monk</b>
<br><b>who would help people make it to the top of the tower. I was floored.
For</b>
<br><b>once I had more then a glimpse of something moving, a feeling like
I wasn't</b>
<br><b>alone, or a scent of something in the room. This time a spirit reached
out</b>
<br><b>and helped one sorry sap who should really know her limits, and
gave her a</b>
<br><b>wonderful story to tell friends and family and a lasting impression
of the</b>
<br><b>magic of Scotland.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Mom Said Goodbye</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: theshewolf2000@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I will never forget the feeling I experienced on the night of June
25, 1981.&nbsp; I had left San Diego by plane to meet my father and his
family for the first time in Montana.&nbsp; My first night there, I was
in my bed which was in the basement.&nbsp; I was awoken by the distinct
feeling that someone was standing at the foot of my bed staring at me.&nbsp;
Thinking it was one of my siblings "checking out" their big sister who
they had never met, I sat up and asked "who's there?" keeping a friendly
tone hoping not to scare the child away.&nbsp; There was no response or
anyone there.&nbsp; I got out of bed and turned on the light.&nbsp; The
feeling was so intense, I even looked under the bed expecting to be greeted
by a giggle of one of my little brothers or sister.&nbsp; There was no
one in that room.&nbsp; I turned out the light, a crawled back into bed.&nbsp;
As I started to doze off, the person came back to the side of my bed.&nbsp;
this time they sat next to me.&nbsp; I pretended to be asleep, as not to
ruin my siblings' surprise visit.&nbsp; I smiled and opened my eyes to
no one at all.&nbsp; It wasn't a scary feeling, but i once again got up
and turned on the light.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; When I returned home to my
grandparents in August, they sat me down after my arrival home and told
me that my mother had passed away the night I left for Montana.&nbsp; They
didn't say anything to me while there because my father would have obtained
custody of me.&nbsp; Because my step mother stated she didn't want me to
have anything to do with her or "her" family, we fought often while i was
in Montana, and one day she took it to physical level, breaking my nose.&nbsp;
I broke all contact with my father and his family.&nbsp; in 1998, my little
brother had problems with the law.&nbsp; He had called me and I said he
could come live with me.&nbsp; While living in my home, he met, married
and had a child with a beautiful girl named Robin.&nbsp; My father and
I had recently come to speaking terms. Unfortunatley, one day he called
to tell me David and Robin has been in a car accident, and that Robin was
dead. This event reunited the family, and me &amp; step-mommy just never
discussed our summer of hell together.&nbsp; My grandmother swore revenge
for her disfiguring my face.&nbsp; "Some day" she always said.&nbsp; My
grandmother died in 2001, 10 months after the birth of my first child,
who she adored.&nbsp; I took my son to see his grandfather the following
father's day.&nbsp; My father and his wife now live across the street from
the house I stayed at the summer of "81.&nbsp; Me, my husband and my step
mother took my son on a walk after dinner.&nbsp; As we passed the old house
my dad used to own, i looked at the spot on the lawn where my step mother
assaulted me.&nbsp; She saw my glance and looked away.&nbsp; Just then,
as my husband later discribed the event, it was as if step mommy tripped
over an invisible rope, her feet flew out from underneath her, and she
landed flat on her face.&nbsp; I quickly went to help her up and wiped
the blood away.&nbsp; We all looked back.&nbsp; There was nothing for her
to have tripped over at all.&nbsp; Even, level ground.&nbsp; No cracks,
weeds. Nothing.&nbsp; As we climbed into bed that night my husband kissed
me on the forehead and whispered "Mam-Maw always keeps her promises!".&nbsp;
I had to laugh, I do believe my grandmother finally got her revenge.&nbsp;
Just one more item of interest.&nbsp; My child was born to my late in life,
and my grandmother passed away 10 months later.&nbsp; She had raised all
of her kids, grandkids, and babysat her great-grandkids everyday.&nbsp;
My son was the only child not to be raised by Mam-Maw.&nbsp; But I believe
she is with us daily.&nbsp; Why? you ask.&nbsp; Because I can feel her
love, and almost hear her whisper "patience" to me when i get cranky with
my boy.&nbsp; But mostly because I have never had orbs in any photos I
have ever taken.&nbsp; But there is always one or two in photos of my son.&nbsp;
thank you for letting me share a paragraph from my life that is near and
dear to my heart.&nbsp; You can write me at theshewolf2000@yahoo.com with
any questions.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Man in the Hall.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In late 1997, I moved into a two bedroom apartment in Los Angeles
with a couple friends.&nbsp; It was only meant to be a temporary as we
were intending to look for a three bedroom.&nbsp; But since two of us had
been out of town for a number of months due to work, the third roommate
didn’t have the time to look for a place for us to move directly into,
so we decided to cram into her current place for a month or two.&nbsp;
The building was an old Spanish style 4-plex with two apartments on the
ground floor and two directly above.&nbsp; All had the same layout.&nbsp;
We were in one of the bottom apartments and the one directly above us had
been the landlord’s elderly parents’ place but was currently empty since
he’d moved them to the other ground floor apartment but hadn’t bothered
to rent it out yet.&nbsp; When you entered our apartment you were in the
large living room/dining room areas with the kitchen off the back of the
dining room to the left and to the right was a very long narrow hallway
with a bathroom halfway down.&nbsp; At the end of the hall was a small
bedroom on left and at the very end was a larger bedroom.&nbsp; Since we
were two girls and a guy, it was decided that the girls would share the
larger bedroom and John would have the smaller room.&nbsp; But since he
wasn’t set to move in until the week after I did, I thought I would stay
in his smaller room so I’d have some privacy.&nbsp; Right from the first
night, I was violently shoved awake at 3:40 am.&nbsp; I became terrified
of the doorway (the door was open) and refused to look, but I can see them
without looking directly at them (if that makes any sense).&nbsp; He was
about 5’10”, sturdy build, mid-late 30’s and translucent.&nbsp; Not to
mention angry and aggressive. Then he started walking the hallway from
my door to the bathroom and back until almost 4:00 am.&nbsp; I covered
my head and it took me a long time to get back to sleep.&nbsp; This happened
repeatedly for the next 6 nights at exactly the same time.&nbsp; Then John
called to say he wasn’t going to move in for another week.&nbsp; That was
it, I couldn’t take it anymore, forget about privacy, I moved my bed into
Lucy’s room as soon as I hung up the phone with John.&nbsp; From then on
I slept fine, but still heard him walking the hallways in the early morning.&nbsp;
At first, I didn’t say anything to Lucy as I didn’t want to scare her and
she’d been living there alone for 6 months.&nbsp; Then John moved in.&nbsp;
Immediately, the shoving started with him.&nbsp; The first couple times
he ignored it.&nbsp; But mentioned it in the morning, I told him my experience
and he decided to tell the ghost to leave because it was his room now.&nbsp;
That night, John woke me up with a scream (our other roommate was out of
town).&nbsp; Apparently, the ghost must have fed off his anger because
John was woken up by a pressure on his chest like someone was trying to
get inside of him.&nbsp; He threw the entity off him opened his eyes and
looked at the door to see a translucent male figure in the doorway with
his hands above his head like in victory.&nbsp; Well, the two of us ran
to the living room and watched TV until the sun rose.&nbsp; When Lucy returned
we told her what had been going on, at first she was reluctant to admit
anything, but finally she said she’d always felt like someone was in there
with her and had slept with a large metal candlestick under her pillow
for protection, but had tried not to dwell on it because she didn’t want
to freak herself out as she had been living there alone.&nbsp; Despite
everything, John stayed in that room.&nbsp; The shoving subsided but the
footsteps in the hall and feeling of being unwelcome remained.&nbsp; Then
one afternoon, John and I were in the kitchen doing dishes.&nbsp; I was
in the doorway to the dining room when out of the corner of my eye I saw
a man come out of the hallway and disappear as soon as he reached the dining
table.&nbsp; Lucy had decided to return to Canada and therefore we no longer
needed a 3 bedroom, but John and I decided we could no longer stay in that
apartment either.&nbsp; The rent was cheap, but with all the disturbances
it was too high of a price as far as we were concerned.&nbsp; The landlord,
however, really liked the two of us and offered us the apartment directly
above.&nbsp; I was a little concerned about the ghost being up there as
well but from the first time I went up to check the place out, I felt happy
and home.&nbsp; So, we took it.&nbsp; In the end, we lived in that bottom
apartment for 5 months. You could still hear him walking the hall from
the upstairs apt, but I grew accustomed to it and knew he stayed downstairs
so I was alright with that.&nbsp; When all the activity first started downstairs,
I asked the landlord if someone had died in there.&nbsp; His parents had
owned the place for about 40 years and to his knowledge, no.&nbsp; After
we moved out, two young guys just out of College moved in.&nbsp; They had
just started their first jobs and were big partyers.&nbsp; From above I
could hear the ghost getting louder with his footsteps, so I knew he was
annoyed.&nbsp; After a while, we asked one of the guys if they’d had any
weird goings on.&nbsp; They said that there was a lot of noise in the hallway
and all the girls that stayed over had complained about feeling something
was there with them and didn’t like the place.&nbsp; But the irony is there
was a lot of activity leading up to and especially the night that the elderly
landlord died in the other downstairs apartment.&nbsp; The ambulance came
in the middle of the night. I don’t remember exactly what time it was,
but the young guys downstairs said that after his death they had no problems
or activity whatsoever.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wondered if it was the elderly man
himself, who was in poor health and angry, perhaps being surrounded by
young life, specifically male (except for me), because the other upstairs
apartment had two men in their mid-late 20’s, was jealous that he was at
the end of his and was somehow astral traveling (as his younger self) and
trying to get into the guys bodies because he wasn’t willing to go.&nbsp;
Either that or the ghost was attached to the older man in some way</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunting Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nneufeld@accesscomm.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've just kept this story in so long, I want to give it out now.
It started when I was younger, maybe around five. I'm near fourteen now,
by the way, so it's still, in a way, fresh.</b>
<br><b>We lived in a small town off of a highway. It was called Balgonie.
It didn't have an outstanding population nor anything to really put it
on the map, but it was so casual, so comfortable there.</b>
<br><b>I remember best our neighbours, Grandpa Porky and Grannie Shirlee.
Of course, they weren't really related to us but we spent so much time
at their house it was as if they were indeed grandparents. One of my favorite
pasttimes there was getting ponyback rides from Porky. He'd go on his hands
and knees and say, "Hop on, Nicki," and he'd carry me around their living
room. We were very fond of each other, and there were seldom a day when
I did not visit him.</b>
<br><b>Unfortunately, one day he had a heart attack. I remember because
I was on vacation in Winnipeg but Shirlee called us and I was so sad. I
had a dream that night, and I saw him standing on the steps leading to
our house, having a heart attack. Later I learned that that was indeed
the way he had passed, and I was slightly unnerved.</b>
<br><b>The funeral was held some time after we got back. I remember going
up to his casket and touching his hand. It was so cold, so unlike him.
But I felt as if he were still alive and was bound to wake up.</b>
<br><b>My parents found me after the service sitting in a corner and crying.</b>
<br><b>That night, he came to me. I have two snowglobes given to me from
his on previous birthdays, both with angels in them. He had picked one
up, and I recall being startled by this because he was transparent and
seemingly unable of such an action. But he held it out to me, and said,
"Hold it." I took it and my hand passed through his. It was as chill as
his hand had been at the funeral. "I'm always in this now," he said, tapping
the glass. "I'm the angel in there."</b>
<br><b>I slept perfectly that night, and I still have the snowglobe to
this day. He has only visited me once since, but there is an unmistakable
feeling of comfort and something unnatural whenever I pick it up.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Grand Island Nebraska ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Kscott63@satx.rr.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I and a friend were driving home late at night from work, he was
in his car and I was in my car. We drove past a private pond next to the
Platte River and as I looked over I saw a blue glowing apparition with
a blue rope, it was a young boy falling into the water as he tried to swing
out.&nbsp; My friend slammed on his breaks about a mile later, ran to my
car and said “did you see that blue ghost”, he had seen the exact same
thing. We found out later the kid had broken his neck falling just as we
had seen.</b>
<br><b>I have seen many ghosts.</b>
<br><b>The hospital in Papillion Nebraska when I worked on the psychiatric
ward as a psychiatric technician had a floor all closed off due to ghosts
and rooms we could not use due to ghosts.</b>
<br><b>I could tell at least 20 good solid ghost stories, of my own and
more that I and my family have encountered. I live in Texas now and due
to having two near death experiences I am very psychic. These stories above
were for anyone and all have seen them that go to those places I believe
the kid falling is a bit rare.</b>

<p><b>Dad?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: christine22719@msn.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This started in 1993 when my father was in the hospital with pnumonia.&nbsp;
I thought he was going to be fine and come home.&nbsp; The night before
he died, it was about 11 o'clock at night and I was ironing in our upstairs
apartment.&nbsp; Suddenly I hear these 3 knocks at the window.&nbsp; I
wasn't scared, just thinking, "That was strange".&nbsp; Then I hear 3 more
knocks at the window.&nbsp; My first thought then was that this lady who
lived downstairs was trying to scare me (she was a troublemaker),&nbsp;
but would she really climb up there with a ladder late at night, esp. when
she had a newborn?&nbsp; So he died the next day. If that were him, why
would he send me a message "before" he died?</b>
<br><b>Then someone kept playing with my sideview mirror on the car, and
my brother told me someone was doing that with his car window too (we lived
in separate places). Next the automatic locks in my mom's car went haywire.&nbsp;
We would be driving down the street and all four of them would start locking
and unlocking by themselves, all at once.&nbsp; This went on for months.</b>
<br><b>The weirdest incident was when I was visiting my mom one night.&nbsp;
She had a bad hip and could no longer make it up the stairs.&nbsp; My brother
was not home that night. Suddenly we hear this God-awful noise coming from
my brother's room upstairs.&nbsp; This is going to sound funny, but it
sounded like a goose or a duck was squawking really loud up there. We just
stared at each other like "What in the world?".&nbsp; Finally my mom says,
"Go up there and see what's going on".&nbsp; Well I went up there and found
NOTHING.</b>
<br><b>I have a few other stories too (but not about Dad)</b><b></b>

<p><b>Spooksville, Portland, Connecticut</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Kathy.Zapor@thehartford.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I just wanted to let you know of an experience I had in Spooksville.&nbsp;
A</b>
<br><b>couple of friends our kids went for a drive, and wound up in Spooksville.</b>
<br><b>We saw a number of ATV's and dirt bikes, and decided to go off-roading.</b>
<br><b>While going up a fairly bumpy hill, I noticed a stone house, complete
with a</b>
<br><b>smoking chimney off to our right and mentioned it to my friends.&nbsp;
They said</b>
<br><b>they couldn't see it through the trees.&nbsp; As we got closer,
I couldn't see</b>
<br><b>the house anymore, either, but we did see an old stone foundation
in the</b>
<br><b>general area.&nbsp; I passed it off as a mirage or something.&nbsp;
Later, driving</b>
<br><b>down the same road, I thought I saw a lady in an old-fashioned gray
dress</b>
<br><b>(the hoopskirt kind) standing by the side of the road, but then
she</b>
<br><b>disappeared.&nbsp; Later still, I cautioned my friend who was driving
to watch</b>
<br><b>out for the dog in the road, and he said he saw it, but as we got
closer, it</b>
<br><b>seemed to vanish-not running off, just sort of fading away.&nbsp;
I've been back</b>
<br><b>twice since then, and the last time we went, I had my two young
children in</b>
<br><b>the car, and my son got out to look at one of the streams (looking
for</b>
<br><b>frogs), and my daughter (who is 5) said to me, "Mommy, I don't think

<p><b>Feelings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Morningwhtdove@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>A year ago, I lost my Ex- husband in a truck accident.</b>
<br><b>to say the least, when this happened I was shocked, not only because
he died, but he also lost his current wife, 4 weeks before that of cancer.
They were both in there 50's.</b>
<br><b>Jim, ( my ex) got along very well, for being divorced.</b>
<br><b>On day, on a Friday, I woke up, and had this feeling, to go to the
cemetery. As the morning wore on, and the more I put it off, the stronger
this feeling got.</b>
<br><b>About 11 am, I dropped everything I was doing, Grabbed the keys
and went to the cemetery... Right behind pulled up a car, with Michigan
tags.&nbsp; Being this was only my second time, to the cemetery, I was
not sure where the grave was at.</b>
<br><b>I went to the office to find out exactly where the grave site was
at. When I got back, I noticed the man that was driving the car with the
Michigan tags was Jim's son ... He was sitting by the grave...</b>
<br><b>Things were a bit stressed through the years with Jim &amp; his
children, so.. I left well enough alone, and never approached him.</b>
<br><b>Nw I have to wonder if I did the right thing. But... Since then,
I have no more strong feeling to go the cemetery... So I summarize that
peace has been made among the both of them... Could I be correct?</b>
<br><b>Another time about 5 years ago, I was going though Penna. Is the
area where my grandfather lived? We came across a new county road sign
and decided to take it.</b>
<br><b>We ended up at my grandfathers old homestead.</b>
<br><b>I went to the door, and told the women that owned the house now,
who I was, and why I was there, that were looking for the place, to see
if it changed at all. She invited my sister and I in, and proceed to tell
us, that she has a friend that was a physic and the women said the house
had an energy about it. And proceeds to tell us some of the encounters...
Which basically was all pretty good?</b>
<br><b>Except ... there seemed to be 2 types of energies in the house...
One that was looking out for everyone ... and another one that scared her
10 year old son.</b>
<br><b>Her 10 year old told me there was a "mean" man in the basement,
and asked if I was his granddaughter... To humor the boy, I told him, yes...
I am, and then he asked me to tell the old man to quit scaring him... So...
I told the "old man" in front of the boy," Grand pa leave the kid alone
your scaring him.... Which then the boy seemed to be a bit relieved.</b>
<br><b>After I did that , I went and took a walk behind the house and took
a piece of shingle from it, ( just for a keepsake)</b>
<br><b>A year later I get a Christmas card, from the lady, saying there
has been no more strange happenings since were we there.</b><b></b>

hall ahead of me but cant seem to catch up to them they always seem to
be 10 steps ahead of me.&nbsp; Also there was a famale guard about a monthe
before I hired on that was actually thrown into a door from behind (that's
why she;s no longer there)&nbsp; And people still see the pale man walking
around every once in awhile</b>

<br><b>A Touching Incounter</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: good_charlotte_fan08@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My brother was 19 when he met his girlfriend,they soon married and
had a</b>
<br><b>son.Soon after at age 22 my brother got very sick with liver cancer
and</b>
<br><b>couldnt take the pain and suffering he and his family felt for him
so he</b>
<br><b>purposly got into a wreck on his new motorcycle,he died in the</b>
<br><b>helicopter,his son was only 3.I decided to go with my mom to his
wifes house</b>
<br><b>outside of San Antonio Tx.Everyone was upset but we tried making
the best of</b>
<br><b>it so that we wouldnt upset my nephew.As night fell,everything was
going</b>
<br><b>fine.It was about 1am when my brothers wife noticed her touch light
next to</b>
<br><b>her bed kept turning on,she thought nothing of it and went back
to bed.The</b>
<br><b>next day I peeked into my nephews room and noticed he was playing
with his</b>
<br><b>cars and talking to someone.He was laughing and saying "here daddy
you</b>
<br><b>try,and laughing as the cars moved".To my amazement they really
did move!I</b>
<br><b>asked him what he was doin and who he was talkin to,he said "im
talkin to my</b>
<br><b>daddy,he's playin cars with me".I told my mom about it and she said
its</b>
<br><b>normal he just misses his daddy.Finally my mother and I left for
home.My</b>
<br><b>brothers wife called a few weeks later and said he is doin it again,talkin</b>
<br><b>to his daddy.She said he came into the kitchen with my brothers
big drinking</b>
<br><b>cup and said "My daddy wants some tea in his cup,please".It started
to freak</b>
<br><b>her out,but she didnt make a big deal of it,so she put the tea into
the</b>
<br><b>cup.Sometimes at night she said her bedroom door would open and
the touch</b>
<br><b>light would come back on.She said Dustin (my nephew) likes talkin
to him</b>
<br><b>often.Often he would say "goodnight daddy,I love you" before he
would go to</b>
<br><b>bed.She doesnt feel frightened at all,but feels safe.Before she
goes to</b>
<br><b>bed,she leaves her touch light on,since he likes keeping it on for
her.I</b>
<br><b>believe he is here watcing over each and every one of his family</b>
<br><b>members,especially his little boy who he loves very much.When I
am there,I</b>
<br><b>also feel his presence in the house,and it is comforting.People
dont believe</b>
<br><b>me when I tell them this but it is all true.I believe children have
more</b>
<br><b>incounters with someone they love and lost than anyone,since they
are all</b>
<br><b>innocent at that young age.Thank you for reading.</b><b></b>

<p><b>A Story of a Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Lorettahopper2@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My story of a ghost is that I have had many strange incounters with
plenty of gost. One is when I was a little girl my mom had just put me
in the bed. Well, the landlords daughter had a baby and the baby had died
in that house. Well, that night when my mom had turn out the lights these
cartoons were on the walls like there was a projector in the room, but
we did not have one and thats all I remember about that story. Another
one was when my grandfather had just died I was living in an apartment
with my dad at that time. Well, my dad and I were in the living room watching
t.v. and I caught a glamps in the hallway a white foot with an old time
night gown. I dont know if that was my grandfather or not. Now when my
father and stepmother had just moved into a house from the apartments my
stepmother said the first few nights when they had just got there, they
had the t.v. pluged up and well my stepmother had turned the t.v. on channel
five it would end up on channel three.&nbsp; If you have gotten this far
in the letter your probally thinking I am off my rocker, but I'm not. Well,
I have had more incouters, but cant tell them all right now. Well, bye
and if you want to email me back that would be great.</b>

<br><b>Creepings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Simon_Carlsson@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Theese events all occured when i was around 10 years old.</b>
<br><b>But still it fells like it was yesterday.</b>
<br><b>The house we live in was previously owned by an old lady who had
the interrest in collectong spiders.</b>
<br><b>She died one day feeding these and when the neighbours found her
weeks later her whole there was spiders inside of her.</b>
<br><b>I know this because it stood in the newspaper but i niether i nor
my parents knew at the time whe bought the house.</b>
<br><b>But the events didn't start until a year after our arrival.</b>
<br><b>The first things that happened were that i heard stuff like small
feet running around in the ceilings.</b>
<br><b>Those sounds lasted around five months.</b>
<br><b>After that there was a silent season.</b>
<br><b>But after around two weeks i felt things creeping inside my bed
so i didn't daresleeping in my own room for a week.</b>
<br><b>But then my parents didn't want me sleeping with them so they asked
me whars the matter and i told them.</b>
<br><b>They had the room checked out but nothing could be found.</b>
<br><b>So i started to sleep in my room again.</b>
<br><b>But after some weeks i woke up in the middle of the night.</b>
<br><b>When i looked up i saw i giant spider at the size of a cat.</b>
<br><b>I tossed everything aside and ran to the bathroom and locked myself
in there for twenty minutes.</b>
<br><b>Later i got courage to go back inside.</b>
<br><b>You could definetly see that something had been lying on my bed
cover because it was eight medium dents in the shape of a circle.</b>
<br><b>I was clearly awaken and i didn't go to sleep again that night.</b>
<br><b>I have checked up every book about spiders and couldn't find anyone
with that description.</b>
<br><b>There have been other events but nothing related to this.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Contacted</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:ketsuchan_the_raven@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have been visiting your site for quite a while now. I am very glad
that it is available to me. I just now decided to share these experiences
I've had with you. I've had many.. but I decided to send you the ones I
think are best.</b>
<br><b>I've been contacted, whether I could tell that's what it was or
not at the tim, by spirits.</b>
<br><b>For example one time in my high school mythology class, it was valentine's
day and my friend found an old card she had gotten from her dad, who had
commited suicide while she and I were in middleschool. She told me that
she didn't know how the card wound up in her bag, but I did. I knew her
dad had put it there, just to let her know that he was watching out for
her and that he still loved her as much as ever.</b>
<br><b>Another time, I was sitting in french class, the teacher said that
we needed our books, but mine was in my locker down the hall. I looked
at a desk behind one of my other friends and saw a french book sitting
there. I opened it up to see whose it was.. It had been my friend who I'll
simply call Bear out of respect for him, who had died from complications
following a surgery. I didn't know it at the time, but Bear was telling
me that he was looking out for me! I realized it later.</b>
<br><b>And lastly I'm going to include the time that I was at the Pierce
Auditorium at Breneau Women's College. If you're not familiar with the
story, there are two versions of it. One is that a young girl hung herself
in the basement after she found out her boyfriend cheated on her.. or that
she hung herself from the diving board of the pool. One time, during a
performance of the Nutcracker, I felt this girl, one Agnus by name, tap
me on the shoulder. My grandmother has also had numerous encounters with
Agnus, such as pictures being turned upside down, or to the side, and fruits
disappearing from the kitchen.</b>
<br><b>Hope you enjoy these anecdotes.</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp; Into Spirits</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: abby072890@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>hello, my name is Abby. For a while now I have been into spirits
or anything out of ordinary. I'm 13 and I would like to tell you of the
time I saw a ghost.</b>
<br><b>In the middle of the night, I was sleeping. I woke up to my door
opening, I saw nothing there. So having cats, I was half asleep and I thought
my cat did it. Then I closed my eyes and I heard footsteps. I opened them
back up and a girl in gothic clothing was walking towards my window. I
could only see her shoulders up. I was so scared I just pulled my blankets
up over my head and went back to sleep. After that moment, I was definitly
aware that ghosts exist. Thank you for reading this. Goodbye</b><b></b>

<p><b>Great Grandmother's Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kenney@amgen.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I had an experience as a child(about 6 yrs old) when we lived in
a house</b>
<br><b>that was somewhat remote in the East side of the Sierra Nevada,
just outside</b>
<br><b>of Bishop. We had just moved there form Los Angeles just a few weeks
after</b>
<br><b>my great grandmother had died. She appeared in the doorway of my
room, it</b>
<br><b>was early in the morning(2am) and I awoke to see a green translucent
figure</b>
<br><b>just standing there looking at me. Let me tell you as a child I
was really</b>
<br><b>freaked out, even to this day when I think about it I get chills
down my</b>
<br><b>spine. I immediately closed my eyes to open them a couple minutes
later and</b>
<br><b>she was still there in the same position, so I closed my eyes again
and</b>
<br><b>didn't open them until the morning. Many years later I had a conversation</b>
<br><b>with my mother about this and she told me she had an experience
that same</b>
<br><b>night, she had felt a presence in her room and had smelled my great</b>
<br><b>grandmothers perfume. This was the only experience that I have ever
had with</b>
<br><b>a ghost. I believe this in my heart to be true and I know what I
saw.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ship Happenings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: silver_nemesis_80@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Shannan, I'm 23 years old and in the US Navy.&nbsp; I
have a couple experiences... well more than a couple actually, but these
two stand out.</b>
<br><b>Point Lookout State Park, St. Mary's County, Maryland.</b>
<br><b>I was stationed at NAS Patuxent River in St. Mary's County, Maryland
for two years, April '99 to August '01.&nbsp; During that time, myself
and several friends went to Point Lookout State Park, approximately 20-25
minutes south of the base.&nbsp; At the state park, there is an old Confederate
POW camp the Union was running at Ft. Lincoln, complete with mass cemetary
with over 3,000 brave men buried there.&nbsp; One night, a girlfriend of
mine got bored at about 1 a.m. and called me.&nbsp; We decided we'd go
down to the park to hang out at the beach.&nbsp; When we left the base
it was fairly warm and temperate with clear skies and a light breeze.&nbsp;
The base is directly on Cheseapeake Bay.&nbsp; When we arrived down at
the beach in the park, it was SIGNIFICANTLY colder; by about 20 degrees
at least.&nbsp; We stayed for about twenty minutes, all the while I was
growing more and more uncomfortable.&nbsp; I asked if she was ready to
go and we left.&nbsp; On our way out of the park, the road took us past
the old fort itself.&nbsp; As soon as we had passed the turn off for Ft.
Lincoln, we were no longer alone in Karen's car.&nbsp; There was something
in the back seat.&nbsp; I kept looking in the passenger rear-view mirror
expecting to see a young (late-teens, VERY early twenties) man in grey
with a confederate cap sitting in the back seat looking back at me.&nbsp;
The back of my neck positively itched, but for the sake of not looking
paranoid, I didn't turn around.&nbsp; I noticed ren had a white-knuckle
grip on the steering wheel.&nbsp; Finally, I turned and just looked in
the back seat.&nbsp; I couldn't physically see him, but I could "see" him
sitting there, looking back at me.&nbsp; He even waved!&nbsp; Karen made
a small noise and asked that I not look behind us anymore.&nbsp; I asked
why and she said because there was something in the back seat.&nbsp; I
said I knew that, and he had just waved at me.&nbsp; She floored it to
about 75 miles per hour and as soon as we had passed the park's boundary,
our strange pick-up vanished from my mind's eye and Karen relaxed visibly.&nbsp;
I don't make any claims on being pychic, but I "see" too much.&nbsp; I've
always put it off as an over-active imagination, but sometimes I'm not
so sure.&nbsp; As a side note, this particular state park is registered
as a haunted place on your site.&nbsp; Karen and I both felt the presence
of this young man, without leading the other up to it.&nbsp; Until she
asked me not to look in the back seat, neither one of us had mentioned
feeling anything odd to the other.&nbsp; Also, upon daylight inspection
of the monument at the cemetary later that week, my family name was present
as being buried there.&nbsp; To my knoweledge, my family name is very uncommon
and my family history on my father's side extends in the US as far back
as the War of 1812.</b>
<br><b>USS Oldendorf DD-972</b>
<br><b>My first ship was approximately 25 years old at her decommissioning
last June.&nbsp; I enjoyed my time stationed aboard her greatly, with one
notable exception.&nbsp; I'll call him the "shadow man".&nbsp; I was "mess-cranking"
on a Southern deployment, which means I was working for the galley temporarily.&nbsp;
I was taking a bag of trash to our containment space just down the passageway
from medical.&nbsp; I'd put the garbage in the containment space and was
making my way forward when I no longer felt alone.&nbsp; It was around
11pm and the white lights in the p-ways had been extinguished and the red-lamps
were lit for night hours.&nbsp; I didn't turn around but I walked a little
bit slower.&nbsp; The "presence" was behind me, back where the medical
passageway met in a "T" junction to the containment space.&nbsp; It was
standing there and glaring at me.&nbsp; It did NOT like the fact I was
there (women have only been permitted on combat ships for about ten years)
at all.&nbsp; I ignored him and kept heading for the door just ahead of
me.&nbsp; As I passed the double door into medical, the presence rushed
up behind me and I could feel hot air, like breath, on the back of my neck.&nbsp;
I opened the water-tight door as fast as I could and put my hand on the
handle to pull open the door when an unseen hand wrenched the lever back
down.&nbsp; I screamed, yanked the lever back up, threw open the door and
ran all the way back to the galley.&nbsp; Under no circumstances would
I go back there at night again, and even during the day I'd feel intimidated.&nbsp;
I would walk by the water-tight door at times and peer through it's port
hole and I could "see" a man-shaped shadow in an aggressive stance down
at the "T" junction.&nbsp; He eventually faded away and I lost my fear
of going down there at night.</b>
<br><b>Later, on the same ship, I was given my own duty section, meaning
I was the only IT on duty.&nbsp; It was quite a responsiblity, and my workcenter
superiors trusted me greatly to give it to me.&nbsp; One night I was on
duty and alone in Radio.&nbsp; I decided to sleep in the space rather then
down in berthing.&nbsp; Just as I had snuggled down in my jacket with my
feet on the desk, I heard footsteps on the deckplates behind me.&nbsp;
I had let my hair down and slung it over the back of the chair so I wouldn't
lay on it.&nbsp; The light in the other room was on and I could see behind
me in the reflection of the computer monitor.&nbsp; Now, our deckplates
were somewhat loose; there was NO WAY anything larger than a mouse could
have walked across them quietly.&nbsp; But these footsteps stopped RIGHT
behind me, and in the computer monitor's reflection, I could not see anyone!&nbsp;
An unseen hand started to play with my hair, as if running it through their
fingers.&nbsp; I didn't feel threatened as I had with the shadow-man, so
I simply told whomever it was that I had to be up early for muster and
if it would let me get to sleep.&nbsp; I swear, on my grandfather's ashes,
the hand gave my hair one last caress and I heard the footsteps clank back
across the deckplates into the other room.&nbsp; And I never saw anyone
in the reflection, besides my own rather surprised face.&nbsp; There is
only one way into that particular complex of spaces on a Spruance-class
destroyer, and that's though Radio's front door.&nbsp; The back door can't
be opened from the outside in the passageway.&nbsp; I was throroughly alone;
I had checked the three spaces before settling down for the night to make
sure.&nbsp; I don't know who might've decided to maintain his watch into
the afterlife, but he never made me feel unwelcome; quite the opposite,
actually.&nbsp; I think he approved of my presence, or at least like me.&nbsp;
OLDENDORF was decommissioned and towed to Bremerton, Washington Naval Ship
Yards st year.</b>

<p><b>Scared</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: twagner@abe.midco.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to tell you a little about myself
before i get started</b>
<br><b>about my scary story. i am 30 years old and i live with my husband
Ronald</b>
<br><b>and i have 3 children, Alex, Macey, and Carmon. They mean the world
to me!</b>
<br><b>We live in a small town in Florida.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One Friday night in the winter, we all were sitting
down to a nice meal</b>
<br><b>when all of a sudden, i heard the chairs in another room move. i
walked in</b>
<br><b>there and no one person or thing was there. i didn't think anything
of it,</b>
<br><b>so i hustled back into the kitchen. While we were all enjoying the
meal, i</b>
<br><b>felt something move right past me. i all of a sudden turned around
and</b>
<br><b>nothing was there. Now at this point i was getting a little freaked
out, but</b>
<br><b>i didn't want to show it. That night, i couldn't get to sleep thinking
about</b>
<br><b>this thing that was in our own household! I called the police to
come and</b>
<br><b>help find it. Pretty soon, they found out that there was a ghost
in our</b>
<br><b>house, so we decided to move to another town in Florida. We are
all ok now</b>
<br><b>and it seems as if our family has never been tighter!</b><b></b>

<p><b>I saw ''Her'' again</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LiLj2345@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Background Information:</b>
<br><b>My house was built in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1903 and according
to new info the builder Jacob, gave the house to my grandmothers ancestors
in 1912 (to find out what im talking about read my first experience)</b>
<br><b>Due to remodeling done to our one hundred year old house over the
years not much remains of how it was before. The adding in a modern bathroom
in 1909, the sealing of the house's side door, the ''New'' kitchen in the
1920's and remodeling done to the dining room and later the adding of aluimium
siding. The things that have not changed are only the the windowless side
of the house and a rosebush that was planted by the mother of my grandma's
great Aunt.</b>
<br><b>My Second Encounter With ''Her''</b>
<br><b>The Woman I saw back in 1999 made a second appearence to me recently.&nbsp;
I wakened to the feeling of extreme thirst and I went downstairs to get
a glass of milk (dont laugh cold milk puts me to sleep) I saw the time
it was around 12:15am on the clock in the hall. I was at the top of the
stairs when i saw ''her'' the same woman i saw back in 1999, in the doorway
of the dining room on the left side at the landing of the stairs. She was
still was wearing the same long out of date grey purple dress, brooch and
the same hairstyle but her spectacles were gone. she looked right up at
me, turned around, and walked right through the wall at the bottom of the
stairs. I knew for a fact that is where the side door used to be. The first
floor hall goes in a straight line from the front door, to the living room
doorway on the left, to the stairs on the left, and to the dining room
doorway straight ahead, the side door(which was sealed in order to put
in a storm door leading into the cellar) was at the bottom of the stairs
to the right of the dining room doorway. I decided again not to tell anyone
at home about this ''meeting'' on the grounds that I would be called crazy.&nbsp;
I have chosen a nickname for the ghost ''Auntie'' because of me thinking
her to be the spirit of my grandma's great Aunt. It could be possible that
it is the spirit of the great Aunt's mother who planted the aged rosebush
on the side of the house you be the judge.</b>
