<P><B>A Couple of Different Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SuKs2BU433970509@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>i have a little brother who is four years old, at the time he was
around two or three, but i had a room in the basement of our old house
and one night he was playing in the kitchen which had a door that led to
the basement, and all of the sudden he came running screaming that he was
scared of the man down there...so my mom and i asked who he was talking
about and he told us that it was the guy who was by my stereo at the bottom
of the stairs who watched me while i slept and played with my stereo, it
not only scared me because it was my room, but the fact that they say little
kids can see things, and this guy watched me, but i also had been getting
bruises, and i didn't know where they were coming from, i wasn't running
into anything....but i would be sleeping some nights and i always kept
my radio on volume level four, and i would wake up to it on 12, i moved
back upstairs because i couldn't stay down</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a couple of months earlier he had told us about
four guys in his room that beat him up, we didn't see any bruises, or hear
him scream, we asked him why he didn't scream and he told us that the guys
told him to shut up we could never find anything out as for a rational
reason we no longer live in that house, but it was weird, i don't even
know if it was a haunting.</B>

<P><B>2 Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Trixrbtgurl01@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>The first one happened when I was about 5 yrs old after my grandma
on my mom's side died. At that time I was scared of my room so I would
climb into my parents bed. One night in my parents bed I woke up @ 2:00
in the morning for no apparent reason looked to my left and saw a figure
walking in the hall. It stopped in front of my parents door looked in,
smiled at me and walked away. It kept walking str8 and that leads to my
room and since then I feel uneasy like someone is watching me and I see
like little glints all over my room.</B>
<BR><B>My second story happened very recently and in the same house. I
was doing my homework and needed something in my room. I was looking at
my paper and turned to walk thru my door and stopped dead in my tracks
and walked backwards like I had bumped into someone I even almost said
excuse me. I still don't know why that happened but it will never leave
me.</B>
<BR><B>My cousin who is a psychic said when i as at his house that he can
tell that there are spirits in my house he could sense it on me.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Grandfathers Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: fengamima@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hi, this is a true story told to me from my grandfather.&nbsp; When
he was</B>
<BR><B>younger and my mum and her sisters were just kids. One night he
went to</B>
<BR><B>sleep just like any ordinary night. in the middle of the night he
awoke to</B>
<BR><B>find a man dressed in a black robe with a hood blocking his face
holding a</B>
<BR><B>sickle, otherwise known as the grim reaper standing over him.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>grandfather than jumbed up out of bed and actually asked the grim
reaper</B>
<BR><B>what he was doing. th reaper than replied i have to take a sole
from someone</B>
<BR><B>that lives on this street and i have chosen yours.&nbsp; my grandfather
than</B>
<BR><B>imediately shouted at the reaper to go away and leave him and his
family</B>
<BR><B>alone.&nbsp; The next day my grandfather found out his next door
neighbour had</B>
<BR><B>died that night with no cause, even though he was very healthy.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>grandfather has told me this story only once when i was little and
even</B>
<BR><B>today i can still remember the slight touch of terror in his voice
as he</B>
<BR><B>gave the recount.&nbsp; My granfather has never spoken a lie and
hence i believe</B>
<BR><B>this story even though i know some wouldnt.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Walking With Nana's Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: windham@ev1.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is about my best friend, Cory(I am 9 yrs. old so I'm probably
not going to tell a REALLY good story!).Here's what Cory told me: When
Cory was little, her Nana died. A few years passed, and she was 3 yrs.
old. One night, she saw her Nana checking up on her family.Then,Nana went
to Cory's room and walked her down the hallway. When everyone woke up,
her Mom told her what happened. So now, she knows that she has the power
to see ghosts/spirits/angels. When she wants to, that is!!!</B>

<P><B>Museum in Wales</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kate1404@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;I went on a school trip to Wales a</B>
<BR><B>year ago, we were told by the inhabitants of an old house, that
had since</B>
<BR><B>been turned into a museum, that the house was haunted by a young
male doctor</B>
<BR><B>who got lost in the walls of the house. The story goes like this</B>
<BR><B>Years ago, in a Welsh house, a man and his wife lived alone. They
were</B>
<BR><B>desperate for children but the wife wasn't able to have any. The
man was so</B>
<BR><B>devestated that he went back to fight in the army for a year. A
short while</B>
<BR><B>after he had left, the woman fell pregnant with his child. She had
no way of</B>
<BR><B>contacting the husband, so she depended on a young male doctor.
The doctor</B>
<BR><B>was unqualified. So, when the baby started to have contractions
and her</B>
<BR><B>water broke 2 months early, the doctor panicked. He got the lady
in a spare</B>
<BR><B>bedroom upstairs and locked the door from inside. At this time,
the husband</B>
<BR><B>had been able to be contacted and was soon to be home. There was
a</B>
<BR><B>complication during the birth. The doctor didn't know how to handle
it so he</B>
<BR><B>deliberately killed the new born child in front of the mothers eyes.
His</B>
<BR><B>reason for doing this was said by some people outside, they said
that he had</B>
<BR><B>said to the woman that the baby would've had trouble breathing in
the</B>
<BR><B>future. The mother knew that this was a lie and so started to call
out for</B>
<BR><B>help. The husband was home by this time and so ran upstairs to batter
the</B>
<BR><B>door down. The doctor got so afraid that he grabbed a pair of scissors
that</B>
<BR><B>he was going to use on the cord for the baby and stabbed the woman
to death.</B>
<BR><B>The doctor then fled up the chimney in that room, cutting himself
on the</B>
<BR><B>way. So when the husband came in, the doctor was gone, leaving the
dead</B>
<BR><B>omther and child there. The walls were never searched and the doctor
was</B>
<BR><B>never seen again. However, at night, the sounds of scuffling and
of a man</B>
<BR><B>crying and scratching and of him repeating the words "I could do
nothing"</B>
<BR><B>can be heard through the walls at night. Also, dripping blood can
be seen at</B>
<BR><B>the fireplace that the doctor escaped up.</B>

<P><B>Ok... I don't know if this really applies to me but I'll tell ya
about it.</B>
<BR><B>In front of my fiancee's house, there is a family that lives there.&nbsp;
Husband,</B>
<BR><B>Wife, and Son.&nbsp; Son is about my age which is 23.&nbsp; On Jan
15th, the</B>
<BR><B>husband/father(Rick), blew his head off with a shotgun.&nbsp; He
was very</B>
<BR><B>depressed and it sad and it sucks that he did that.&nbsp; His wife
Cathy and son</B>
<BR><B>Jared now have to deal with his death.&nbsp; They grabbed their
belongings and</B>
<BR><B>probably went to Cathy's mom's house or sisters.&nbsp; This is a
middle/upper</B>
<BR><B>class neighborhood in Mandeville, Louisiana.&nbsp; My girl and I
noticed a few</B>
<BR><B>days after his death, the light in his office was on.&nbsp; It came
on after</B>
<BR><B>midnight.&nbsp; Nobody it at his house.&nbsp; His window was open
but not sure what</B>
<BR><B>kind of light this was.&nbsp; Not sure if it were an orb but it
was a light.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>next night, it was off.&nbsp; Then it was on again the following
night but not so</B>
<BR><B>bright as before.&nbsp; Also there is a fog/myst that appears to
surround the</B>
<BR><B>house at night.&nbsp; I think its freaky.&nbsp; I'm a big fan of
paranormal/ghost stuff</B>
<BR><B>and I think there is something really going on here.&nbsp; Well...just
wanted you</B>
<BR><B>to know because I think it's interesting.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Great-Grandma's Broom</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bb3267@sbc.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was fortunate enough to know both of my great-grandparents for
many years</B>
<BR><B>before they passed on. Great grandma believed that sensitivity of
some kind</B>
<BR><B>seemed to run in the family. While she was a religious woman, she
never</B>
<BR><B>doubted that ghosts exist and that the spirit of loved ones would
help you</B>
<BR><B>if they were able.</B>
<BR><B>Here is her story. She came to America at 14 and married my</B>
<BR><B>great-grandfather who was a very mature 16. They worked hard and
produced a</B>
<BR><B>houseful of children, 1 boy and 7 girls. Great grandpa used to work
nights</B>
<BR><B>so great grandma would often sleep downstairs on the couch and wait
for him</B>
<BR><B>to get home. One night, the children were all sleeping upstairs
and she was</B>
<BR><B>sound asleep on the couch. Suddenly she heard her mother swearing
at her in</B>
<BR><B>Italian, telling her to stop being so lazy and get up and take care
of her</B>
<BR><B>children! Having put in a long day, she begged her mama to let her
sleep a</B>
<BR><B>little longer. The swearing got louder and now she was being hit
with a</B>
<BR><B>broom. The feel of the broom was quite distinctive since, like everyone
else</B>
<BR><B>around her, her mother handmade her brooms. While the swearing and
broom</B>
<BR><B>whacking continued, great grandma started to come out of her deep
sleep</B>
<BR><B>stupor. She realized the mama she was being assaulted by was back
in Italy</B>
<BR><B>and buried there years ago! She sprang off the couch only to find
that smoke</B>
<BR><B>was billowing throughout the house. She ran and got herself and
all of her</B>
<BR><B>children out safely but the house burned to the ground.</B>
<BR><B>My great grandmother lived until she was 85 and had all of her faculties</B>
<BR><B>until the end. She would tell the story calmly with no embellishments
like</B>
<BR><B>it was just something that happened. I miss her dearly and remembering
her</B>
<BR><B>telling this story has made me smile. Thanks for providing somewhere
to</B>
<BR><B>share it</B><B></B>

<BR><B>MY PARENTS HAUNTED HOUSE</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: donsuead@earthlink.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>First of all let me say I was raised not believing in ghost, goblins
or spooks.&nbsp; The experiences of the last 40 years have made me doubt
my up bringing; I just don’t know what to believe.</B>
<BR><B>It all started in the summer of 1966, in Morrow, Georgia, when I
was 16 years old.&nbsp; My mother was an insurance agent, and also sold
real estate.&nbsp; The man my mother sold real estate for, made my mother
a fantastic deal on a large two story house.&nbsp; The house was four-year-old,
brick, four bedrooms, full finished basement, laundry room, two full bathrooms,
and double carport.&nbsp; The carport had wooden stairs that led up the
to the dining room.&nbsp; This is the last place in the world that any
of us would suspect as being haunted.</B>
<BR><B>On the day my parents singed the papers on the house I spent the
night in the house alone.&nbsp; I heard footsteps going up and down the
stairs all night long.&nbsp; Now being 16 I did not let anyone know of
the noises I heard.&nbsp; I didn’t want to be accused of being a silly
teenager, scared of the dark.&nbsp; I really wasn’t scared; the noise just
kept waking me up.&nbsp; I would get up and look around and find nothing
unusual.</B>
<BR><B>As the summer dragged into the fall, it was football season.&nbsp;
My father worked for a bottle manufacturing company, and worked rotating
shift every seven days.&nbsp; It was not unusual for me to watch Sunday
afternoon football on TV, in the basement, alone. Now this is the beginning
of the haunting as far as I am concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp; While watching TV,
I would hear footsteps going up the stairs from the carport, open the dining
room door, go across the carpet and into the kitchen.&nbsp; The kitchen
had tile flooring, and was directly above me when I was in the basement,
so the steps in the kitchen could easily be heard over the TV.&nbsp; At
first I thought it was my mother home from the real estate assignment she
usually had on Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; I would go up stair to see her and
there would be no one in the house but me!&nbsp; This was to be repeated
many, many times over the years, and with many different people hearing
the same thing.&nbsp; As time went on both my parents and my younger sister
had similar experiences.&nbsp; Not wanting to upset my sister, my mother
would laugh and say Little Casper, (the friendly ghost) had been around.</B>
<BR><B>In 1968 I got married, joined the army, and left home.&nbsp; My
wife Brenda did not get along with here parent very well, so she lived
with my folks while I was overseas.&nbsp; Mysterious things would happen
to her, as well.&nbsp; She stayed in my old bedroom downstairs.&nbsp; She
would hear the footsteps on both stairways, and every so often something
would sit on the bed with her as she was sleeping.&nbsp; It didn’t take
long for her to decide her parents weren’t so bad after all.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now believe me, we did not build this ghost thing up to her.&nbsp; If any
thing at all was said it was in a joking way about Casper.</B>
<BR><B>By 1976, Brenda and I had 2 children, and a divorce in 1978.&nbsp;
All the while we were married strange noises, footsteps, and the like was
going on.&nbsp; Being careful not to scare the children we just did not
talk about Casper in front of them.&nbsp; We did not want the kids to be
scared at grandma’s house.&nbsp; One afternoon the kids and I went to see
my mother.&nbsp; The kids went to the basement to watch TV. Mother and
I stayed outside for a while talking and visiting.&nbsp; In a few minutes
the kids come outside and said, Grandma we thought you your inside, we
heard you upstairs in the kitchen.&nbsp; We went upstairs to see if we
could have something to drink, and no one was in the house.&nbsp; My kids
at the time were 8 and 3 years old.&nbsp; These children had in no way
been exposed, introduced, or scared by ghost stories.&nbsp; They thought
they had made a mistake and thought they had heard us in the kitchen.&nbsp;
They weren’t even frightened then.</B>
<BR><B>In 1978 my father died.&nbsp; Soon after the funeral a really strange
thing began to happen.&nbsp; It seems like most every night at 11:00 PM
we could hear door keys at the front door. Like someone had the keys in
their pocket, pulled them out, and was trying to unlock the front door.&nbsp;
The front door handle would jiggle back and forth.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have gone
out and looked many times trying to catch what ever was at the door.&nbsp;
I never did catch anyone or see anything.&nbsp; Now there is another strange
thing.&nbsp; My sister at the time was raising show poodles, and had a
Boston Terrier dog.&nbsp; Every night that the door shook, the dogs would
run to the door, bark, growl, and shake.&nbsp; They almost became a basket
case.&nbsp; After about 3 months, thank god, the door thing stopped.</B>
<BR><B>Over the years we would occasionally we would have relatives from
out of state visit us.&nbsp; It never failed; then something would sit
on the bed, of a female relative, and wake them up.&nbsp; I know it happened
to my Grandmother, 4 different aunts, and my present wife, Susan.&nbsp;
My family never made a big deal about this goings on.&nbsp; To my knowledge
it never happened to a male guess.&nbsp; My family never made a big deal
out of Casper, we didn’t want people the think we were nuts!!!</B>
<BR><B>One afternoon I was sick, and was a sleep in the basement. The phone
rang and it was my mother checking on me.&nbsp; I told her Dale, an ole
girlfriend at the time, was here because the light in my bedroom was on.&nbsp;
After we finished the conversation I hung up the phone, and got up and
turned off the light in my room.&nbsp; I went up stairs to find Dale.&nbsp;
No one else was in the house.&nbsp; I went back down stairs and the light
in my room was on again.&nbsp; I turned it off again and got back on the
sofa.&nbsp; I took a short nap and when I woke up, the light was back on.&nbsp;
Now this is the third time I have turned that light off.&nbsp; I spoke
in a very loud, and angry voice.&nbsp; Don’t turn that damn light on again!
The light did stay off that time.&nbsp; Maybe I should not have raised
my voice, but I did get the message across, and Casper did comply.</B>
<BR><B>In 1982 I married Susan, we moved about 50 miles from my mother,
and thru the years Casper would do thing.&nbsp; Mother would talk it as
if it was member of the family. I guess it was we had it over 30 years.&nbsp;
We never felt any sense of danger, just wonderment.</B>
<BR><B>In 2000 my mothers health was failing, cancer. Two weeks, before
I had to insist my mother move in with Susan and I, Casper walked the floor
all night long according to my mother.&nbsp; He kept up this activity the
last two week she lived in that house.&nbsp; My mother had just got to
the point she needed help.&nbsp; She was sick with cancer, chemo treatments,
and just couldn’t do for herself.&nbsp; I moved her to my house in May
2000.&nbsp; One evening mother and I were talking and she said, “I wonder
if Casper has missed me.&nbsp; I just wonder if Casper knew my mother was
sick, maybe trying to help her.&nbsp; Maybe he was upset because she was
sick.&nbsp; Maybe he knew she would be leaving.</B>
<BR><B>My mother lived in that house alone from 1982 until May 2000. She
took a sprit, ghost, or something in and made it a member of the family.&nbsp;
She was never freighted of it, just a little curious about why it was here.
That is the kind of woman Hilda Faye Adams, my mother was.&nbsp; My mother
died October 31, 2000, Halloween!&nbsp; Before she died she asked me if
I thought she would get to meet Casper?&nbsp; I did not know, and I don’t
know now.&nbsp; After 30 something years we still don’t know what we were
dealing with.&nbsp; Casper brought a little start ever now and then, and
a lot of humor over the years.&nbsp; I guess what I am saying&nbsp; I miss
him, and if he is still around and need a place to stay well we have an
extra bedroom.</B>
<BR><B>Ps&nbsp;&nbsp; Both my children, Cori, and Jason are grown and have
children of their own.&nbsp; They have been aware of Casper for many years
now, and have never felt threatened by him.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>We Were Welcome.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: donnarobb@xtra.co.nz</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi&nbsp; my story seems tame compared to some i have read on your
board well it all started when we moved from our house to another place
that was about the same age this bloke had died in the house about 3months
before we moved in and we knew about it but because we did`nt think any
thing of it we weren`t worried well anyway our kids were 5 years old and
we had 3 year old twins and a 2 year old. one of the twins would not sleep
in his room that night and sowe said to himtocome and lie on the couch.
My husband and i were unpacking some this in the lounge and my son sat
bolt up right on the couch and said tell the man to go away we asked what
man asthe kids did`nt know about the death he said the man on the telly
well the tv was`nt even plugged in we just said there is no one there&nbsp;
i always gotthe feeling that some one was watching me in the shower but
youwould alwaysjust see some thing out the corner of your eye One night
when we were in bed weheard the coal range open up and stirred about and
the door close we only had a coal range for heating and cooking we need
that wehad a vistor then the kids soon learned to live with eric and every
night wewould always yell good night eric i think he was checking out who
had moved in and what we were going to do to the place which we put in
gardens that had over grown since we did the gardens we only saw eric once
and that was when we came in and there was acup of tea sitting on the kitchen
bench he had made for us as we were to busy in the garden to stop for one

<BR><B>My Paranormal Family and Four Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mpowell@nycap.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>At the outset let me say that tiny bits of paranormal occurrences
are spattered throughout my life.&nbsp; My middle daughter (I have three)
has a quirky talent when behind the wheel; she avoids all sorts of things.&nbsp;
Now this girl is one of those 'quick' drivers that you can really hate
and riding with her is nerve-jangling.&nbsp; However, on one occasion when
I was riding with her, for no reason at all she slowed down to the speed
limit (she doesn't much believe in speed limits) on a familiar stretch
of interstate with no other cars in sight.&nbsp; Sure enough - where there
had never been during the thirty years that I'd driven that road, was a
speed trap.&nbsp; Okay - not a biggie.&nbsp; On another occasion we had
just started out, a traffic light half a block ahead of us turned green
and my daughter, who often jumps green lights, came nearly to a stop and
avoided being hit by a car that ran the red light.&nbsp; Because of buildings
in the way, neither of us could see the car until we were almost into the
intersection and it flew by.&nbsp; If my daughter had not slowed, that
other car would have killed her.</B>
<BR><B>This sort of thing happens often in my family.&nbsp; When my mother
was attending Vassar Brothers in the late thirties she used to come home
now and then unannounced.&nbsp; This required getting a ride from the college
to the train station, catching any of several trains on New York Central's
then popular Manhattan to Chicago run, and then a trolley, which were all
pretty random events.&nbsp; I am told that, without fail, my grandfather
would put on his coat or jacket and tell the rest of the family that he
was going to the corner to meet my mother and would return with her.</B>
<BR><B>After grandpa passed away (and I'll return to him shortly), mom
showed a flair for this ability.&nbsp; During my tour in the military I
used to come home as cheaply as possible.&nbsp; I'd use military hops,
I'd hitch-hike, I'd schedule my leave to coincide with someone who was
headed generally towards my home, and I would never give notice to my mother.&nbsp;
In spite of this lack of notice, she would tell her co-workers that I would
be coming home and make plans for us.</B>
<BR><B>The most recent such happening was very small and had a familiar
feel to it.&nbsp; Last week I dropped by my oldest daughter's to see if
she felt like doing some shopping in Albany.&nbsp; She told me that she
had purposely not gone to Albany earlier in the week because she knew we'd
be going.&nbsp; I told her that I didn't know that I was going until about
ten minutes before I got to her house; certainly not days earlier.</B>
<BR><B>Okay - enough of the lead-in and onto ghost number one.</B>
<BR><B>My grandfather was already retired by the time I was born.&nbsp;
At six feet three, he was a huge man and had developed that 'presence'
that most tall men do; that unspoken air of authority.&nbsp; This made
him a giant to a toddler and child my size and certainly not someone you
could be mistaken about seeing.&nbsp; He was also a man of habit.&nbsp;
Every day, from nine until ten and from six-thirty until eight he would
sit in 'his' chair in the back living room and read every inch of our two
daily papers.&nbsp; I was almost eight when he died and for a while nothing
special happened.&nbsp; Then one morning (it must have been a weekend)
I was assembling my Lionel tracks on the floor when I happened to look
up and see him sitting in his chair, studying my efforts.&nbsp; I remember
that he smiled and I ran to the kitchen to get my grandmother.&nbsp; Of
course, when we got back he was gone, and Nana assured me that it was okay
to see him, and that such 'sightings' probably wouldn't continue for very
long.&nbsp; I had no idea what she was talking about, but she was correct
- they never happened again.</B>
<BR><B>Mom, on the other hand, was never visible, but very persistent.&nbsp;
First of all, there was the house we lived in.&nbsp; She'd bought that
house and she loved it.&nbsp; We had a garage at the back of the yard,
but the driveway was too narrow for cars made after the mid-fifties or
so, which made the garage a wonderful storage place.&nbsp; Also, there
was a room at the rear of the cellar that had about a hundred cubby-holes
for odds and ends.&nbsp; For the thirteen years after mom died, there was
rarely a project that I would undertake on that house that mom had not
foreseen and provided for.&nbsp; Before going to a store, I'd check the
storage areas and, with only one or two exceptions, find exactly what was
needed.&nbsp; Some of it was spooky.&nbsp; Our house was shingled and my
son used the back porch to bounce balls off.&nbsp; Kids at six have very
little consideration for shattering shingles.&nbsp; He broke thirty in
all and, sure enough, I found thirty-one shingles in the cellar.&nbsp;
So, what happened to that extra shingle?&nbsp; It broke when I was carrying
the stack of shingles up the stairs and dropped it.&nbsp; Mom had planned
for me to drop it I guess.</B>
<BR><B>On one occasion my wife had just finished a couple loads of wash
and dumped them on our sofa.&nbsp; After selecting the things we needed
for a trip to her parents, we locked up the house and left.&nbsp; When
we returned, hours later, the house was still securely locked and nothing
inside had been disturbed, except for the pile of clothes.&nbsp; They were
all neatly folded and sorted.</B>
<BR><B>Mom hung around for years, never seen, but always nearby.&nbsp;
The most remarkable event happened after I'd built a topnotch darkroom
in the cellar.&nbsp; To get down there you began in a little hallway between
the kitchen and front room, opened a door, walked down five squeaky stairs,
turned right and walked down ten more such steps.&nbsp; One evening I was
in the darkroom loading film and I heard my wife walk down the stairs.&nbsp;
She said nothing.&nbsp; She walked right up to the darkroom door and I
told her not to open it; that I had raw film out and would be out as soon
as I got it put away.&nbsp; I listened to her walk back to the stairs and
up them.&nbsp; Two minutes later I was finished and went off in search
of her.&nbsp; I found her, in the front room reading.&nbsp; When I asked
her what she wanted, she looked at me as though I'd lost yet another marble.&nbsp;
When I told her my side of things, she told me that she'd been in that
chair for over an hour and not left it.&nbsp; No one had gone to the cellar
and the door to it, which she would have seen move, had not been opened.&nbsp;
She too had heard the footsteps and thought it was just me doing something
weird.</B>
<BR><B>Ghost number three lived next door.&nbsp; For about ten years it
would have been difficult for an observer to determine which house belonged
to my family and which was our next door neighbor's.&nbsp; We were constantly
together and while Marty wasn't big on photography, we both loved woodworking
and spent lots of time and too much money making things that no one ever
needed or wanted in the first place.&nbsp; When Marty's wife died she kept
coming home.&nbsp; The front door to Marty's was typical - sturdy oak with
a window and an aluminum and glass storm door on the outside.&nbsp; As
it was still spring, the glass was still in that outer door - not screening.&nbsp;
I point this out for two reasons.&nbsp; First, that outer door prevented
breezes from reaching the main door.&nbsp; Also, if you have a properly
fitted pair of doors, which these were, when you open one of them you can
feel the small vacuum you're creating trying to hold the door closed.&nbsp;
This didn't stop Marty's wife.&nbsp; For a month after she died, the inner
door would open on its own.&nbsp; Marty and I checked the locks on both
doors, checked the hinges, the frames - you name it and we checked it.&nbsp;
Everything was in proper working order and yet the inner door, and only
the inner door, continued opening on its own day and night.&nbsp; Everyone
in both our families saw it many times and so did anyone who visited Marty.&nbsp;
And then it just stopped.&nbsp; No changes had been made.</B>
<BR><B>I never personally experienced the last ghost in my life, but my
cousin sure did.&nbsp; She and her mother lived in apartments a block away
from one another, just off Columbus Avenue in Manhattan.&nbsp; At the time
of her mother's death, my cousin had been typing up the late Joseph Campbell's
(the mythologist) final book.&nbsp; My aunt, an English major, would proof
read everything her daughter typed.&nbsp; In Manhattan, death does not
end a lease.&nbsp; If it's under rent control, you hang on to the place,
and that's what my cousin did.&nbsp; She used her mother's apartment as
a studio where she could do her typing.&nbsp; One day, not long after her
mother's death, my cousin called me and told me that her mother was still
proof reading.&nbsp; My cousin would neatly stack her typing for the day
on top of her mother's piano and leave for the night.&nbsp; When she returned
in the morning, quite often several pages had been moved from the stack
and set to the side.&nbsp; Invariably, there were errors on those pages.&nbsp;
One day my cousin intentionally made a typing, grammatical or syntactical
error on every page she typed.&nbsp; When she came back the next day, the
entire stack had been moved.&nbsp; Beyond this, my cousin said she could
'feel' her mother's presence at times.&nbsp; Sometimes her mother's favorite
couch would have a 'warm section' as though someone had been lying on it
and just gotten up.&nbsp; Well, the only windows faced due north, so it
wasn't sunlight.&nbsp; The day my cousin finished the book, her mother
left forever.&nbsp; The stack of that day's typing was undisturbed when
my cousin returned in the morning and the publisher found three errors
in those pages.&nbsp; Beyond that, over the following years my cousin never
felt her mother's presence again.&nbsp; My aunt had set out to help her
daughter finish a job and, except for the final ten pages, had done just
that.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>This Happened to My Aunt</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ryan_mcgregor79@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My aunt was telling me that one time her and a bunch of friends decided
to hold a seance. Now I don't know anything about them so I won't be able
to mention it in the story. But she said they had the cat in the room and
they didn't know it. They were doing the seance however it is done and
all of the sudden they heard a screeching noise when they said to give
them a sign that there was something there. They all jumped and looked.
The cat was clawing at the wall as if he was trying to get through it.
And the dog was barking in the other room. There was a window above the
cat and they looked through it and saw something but couldn't figure out
what it was. They went outside and a man was standing in the alley. He
was dressed all in black and they couldn't see his face. He started towards
them and they all ran inside and back to the window. He was gone. They
never saw him in the neighbourhood again.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Postman</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: AnglChrst8@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was given your website address today and wish to share with you
an experience I had in 1965.&nbsp; I am in England, my name is Angie and
at the time had no real idea that I was a medium.&nbsp; I was 22 at the
time, staying with my two children at my parent's home in Didcot, Oxfordshire,
England until such time as my husband, who was in Royal Air Force in Germany
could send for us.</B>
<BR><B>One day I had a letter to post to Germany and realised that it was
almost 11 am, the time the local post office had its mail collected from
mailbox outside the shop.</B>
<BR><B>I used my mother's bicycle and pedalled up to the box.&nbsp; There,
counting mail on the front of his bicycle was the postman (mailman).&nbsp;
The mail box was open with big bunch of keys in the lock.&nbsp; In England,
if the postman has collected the mail out of the box, he will often refuse
to take your letter.&nbsp; Silly I know, but true.&nbsp; I quickly jumped
off my bicycle and stood next to him.&nbsp; He did not look up, just kept
thumbing through the mail, in a bag on front of his post bike.&nbsp; I
said "have I missed the post please?".&nbsp; The young postman did not
look at me for a few seconds, then gave me a strange look and did not reply
to my question.&nbsp; I was mad!!!&nbsp; I walked to the wall of the Post
Office, threw my bicycle against said wall, turned and got the shock of
my life.&nbsp; No postman was there, box was shut and locked and this all
in about 10 seconds.&nbsp; My first thought was, this cannot be happening.&nbsp;
I walked over to the box and saw that letters were still in</B>
<BR><B>I have no idea.&nbsp; Since those days, my clairvoyance has gone
from strength to strength and I now attend Spiritualist Churches, taking
services and clairvoyant evenings as well as helping people who need it.</B>
<BR><B>That is my true story.</B>

<P><B>Spadra Cemetery</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Shagys2dope42@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello My name is Brandy.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I have been going to the Spadra Cemetery For the past ten
years. I was there</B>
<BR><B>when Jim and Arleen where there doing their investigation. I truly
believe</B>
<BR><B>there are spirits of the young children there in the yard. I tend
to go out</B>
<BR><B>there just to sit and listen. and Feel the energy that the grave
yard holds.</B>
<BR><B>There is a certain ghost that seems to show his presence very well
when My</B>
<BR><B>friend and I go there. We like to Call him Timmy. I believe he is
the</B>
<BR><B>deceased Child of one of the mothers, I cant remember her name off
hand but</B>
<BR><B>she died giving birth to him. On certain nights they are more active
than</B>
<BR><B>others. They are all very playful, and love to "play" with those
that enter</B>
<BR><B>the Cemetery. Personally I tend to sit under a large group of trees
and</B>
<BR><B>listen to the sounds. And if your just sitting there not really
trying to</B>
<BR><B>listen for it you can actually hear voices. Its hard to understand
what they</B>
<BR><B>are saying but they are very distinct voices. One night a few friends
and I</B>
<BR><B>heard giggling, Children giggling. We all thought it was our minds
playing</B>
<BR><B>with us, but I went back the next night alone and heard it again.
Obviously</B>
<BR><B>these young spirits love to be visited and like to play. I actually
took a</B>
<BR><B>disposable camera out there and took a few pictures and I got those
Orbs on</B>
<BR><B>my pictures. I was truly surprised. But I just thought it was really
funny</B>
<BR><B>how Jim and Arleen assumed what was out there was a bad thing. I
truly</B>
<BR><B>believe the spirits of the Spadra Cemetery are as friendly as the
person</B>
<BR><B>going out there, If you are out there to listen and understand they
will be</B>
<BR><B>"playful" if your out there to disturb them then you wont have a
great</B>
<BR><B>experience. But I go there every other night to communicate with
them and try</B>
<BR><B>to keep wrong doers out. Well, I thought you would like this story
about the</B>
<BR><B>playful kid like spirits out there.</B>

<P><B>Second Hand Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gbmcnulty@yahoo.com.au</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I really enjoy your site. I would just like to forward to you a story
told by a friend. I have no idea if it is true, because I have never met&nbsp;
the person involved. It may even be one of those "chain" stories. A story
everyone, except me, knows about.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway here goes;&nbsp; One night a cab driver picked up beautiful
young lady, carrying a bunch of roses. She told him the destination,&nbsp;
and off they went. Upon arrival he turned to gather the fare and the back
seat was empty. Except for the roses. He got out of the&nbsp; cab and looked
around, but the street was empty. He picked up the roses, found the house
the girl&nbsp; had&nbsp; asked to be taken to and&nbsp; went to the front
door. He knocked and the door was opened by a middle aged woman. He introduced
himself, and explained what&nbsp; he was doing there. The woman looked
very annoyed when he mentioned the girl. He noticed a photo sitting on
a mantlepiece&nbsp; behind her and realised it was his passenger. He told
the older woman this, she gasped, and explained that this was her daughter,&nbsp;
who had died some five years prior. As I said I did not get this story
directly, but it did scare me slightly. Have you heard anything like this
before.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Incidents Around the House</B><B></B>

<P><B>To: p021369@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have lived in my current home for at least 25 years and my husband
has</B>
<BR><B>been there his whole life.</B>
<BR><B>Before my husbands parents bought the three floor house, it was
a farm which</B>
<BR><B>consisted of two buildings and what we call the little house.&nbsp;
What we</B>
<BR><B>can figure out the little house was where the people came in and
got warm</B>
<BR><B>and relaxed. Our house was the main house, and the other large house
was the</B>
<BR><B>barn. In our estimation we feel the house is somewhere over a 100
years old.</B>
<BR><B>I thought some of you would be interested in some of the happenings
and</B>
<BR><B>events that have occured&nbsp; in the&nbsp; house.</B>
<BR><B>As a kid my husband and his brothers often heard footsteps or banging
coming from the second and third</B>
<BR><B>floors. When they were brave enough they would come out from under
their beds</B>
<BR><B>and grab bats and sneak up to confront whom ever was up there,.&nbsp;
They , never found anyone.</B>
<BR><B>When I first moved into the house little things would happen like
the water in the bathroom</B>
<BR><B>would turn on by itself , lights would sometimes go on and off little
things</B>
<BR><B>like that. We have a ceiling fan that&nbsp; will only work when
it wants . It usually wants to in the dead</B>
<BR><B>of winter during a blizzard, never in the summer when it is hot.The</B>
<BR><B>electrical plugs will work&nbsp; one day and not the next.</B>
<BR><B>I had a incident where I was down the cellar folding the laundry.
I had</B>
<BR><B>just taken a pen out of my sons jeans that he had left in the pocket
when</B>
<BR><B>I picked up the pen and wrote 464.&nbsp; Today I still dont know
why I did it.</B>
<BR><B>Well figuring someone was telling me to play this number I did for
two days</B>
<BR><B>.The first night it came out straight, the next day it came out
anyway.</B>
<BR><B>Another time I was sitting in the kitchen all by myself , when I
felt</B>
<BR><B>someone lift the back of my hair. I was not afraid, because somehow
I felt</B>
<BR><B>it was friendly.</B>
<BR><B>One time while walking from the front room of the house into the
kitchen</B>
<BR><B>out of the corner of my eye I saw a tall young man dressed all in
black,</B>
<BR><B>like in the sixties, looking through the daily paper. I said to
him thinking</B>
<BR><B>he was my son, to please take out the rubbish, and I kept walking.</B>
<BR><B>Suddenly I remembered my son had gone with his father camping, I
turned</B>
<BR><B>back and the man was gone.</B>
<BR><B>We now come to one of the most frightening experiences in the house.</B>
<BR><B>While walking through the same door way into the kitchen , I could
hear like</B>
<BR><B>animal nails clicking on my vinyl floor. I turned the corner to
go into</B>
<BR><B>the parlor when I came upon the most frightening black dog I have
ever seen.</B>
<BR><B>This dog wanted to eat me so bad, his large teeth were growling,
and all</B>
<BR><B>his saliva was dripping down on the floor.&nbsp; He was sliding
on the floor</B>
<BR><B>trying to get a grip on it so he could run.&nbsp; Then he was gone.
This</B>
<BR><B>experience took me over a day to get over it was so frightening.</B>
<BR><B>I consider myself a very lucky person, because spirits chose to
come visit often.</B>
<BR><B>Whether it&nbsp; is someone touching us or you feel someone watching
you, or when your sleeping and you wake up</B>
<BR><B>and just know someone is there, but you cant see them.</B>
<BR><B>One such experience happened to me one night. I had a visit from
a recently</B>
<BR><B>deceased brother. I was dead asleep and all of a sudden I woke up
and there</B>
<BR><B>in front of me was my brother sitting on a island with me and my
other brothers</B>
<BR><B>and sisters together on land. He was telling me that he was very
upset</B>
<BR><B>that all us kids were fighting, which we were at the time, and he
didnt</B>
<BR><B>like where he was.&nbsp; I felt he meant he was in limbo.&nbsp;
Not good enough for heaven</B>
<BR><B>but not bad enough for hell.&nbsp; Then he disappeared.</B>
<BR><B>The next one to leave us was my youngest brother. Being mentally
challenged he was constantly</B>
<BR><B>being tormented by the other kids as being stupid.&nbsp; When he
came to see me one night</B>
<BR><B>he was standing with alot of very smart people.&nbsp; Somehow I
felt that God had evened the</B>
<BR><B>score with my brother. And in death he was everyones equal. This
visit was one of my happiest.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;My sister in law woke me up the night she died.&nbsp; She
looked 20 years</B>
<BR><B>younger and very happy. She just smiled and then disappeared. No
words or thoughts</B>
<BR><B>were exchanged during her visit.</B>
<BR><B>The next visit I received was from a young man I didnt know.&nbsp;
When he</B>
<BR><B>appeared before me he was barefooted and just had jeans on. He was
standing</B>
<BR><B>with his hands on his hips looking very cocky how good he looked.&nbsp;
I kept</B>
<BR><B>getting that from him, that it was important that I knew he looked
good.</B>
<BR><B>Like I said I didnt know who he was, but at the time of the visit
one of my nieces</B>
<BR><B>friends father died in rather tragic circumstances. He was also
homeless at the time</B>
<BR><B>of his death.&nbsp; When times were very good he prided himself
on being clean. After talking</B>
<BR><B>to the friend and seeing that she was taking the death really really
hard. I</B>
<BR><B>asked her father to come to me if he wanted and give me some kind
of sign for&nbsp; his</B>
<BR><B>daugher so she would know he was alright. Today I am still trying
to get a picture of</B>
<BR><B>the girls father when he was younger to see if it is him.</B>
<BR><B>I am often woken up at night feeling someone standing beside me
in the dark</B>
<BR><B>but sometimes I am just too tired to open my eyes and look. I know
I</B>
<BR><B>have probably missed some good spirit opportunities.</B>
<BR><B>There was another episode that happened with my brother. I had been
with him when he died and I said</B>
<BR><B>goodbye to him and left the hospital. When I entered the house family
and friends</B>
<BR><B>told me that like fifteen min. before I got home the whole kitchen
started</B>
<BR><B>glowing. There were like ten people witness to this. I feel it was
my brother just</B>
<BR><B>coming to say good bye.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Now its time to talk about my cat Lily. I must confess that I prefer
dogs over</B>
<BR><B>cats, but I did become very fond of Lily in the short time we had</B>
<BR><B>her.Lily and I went through some very trying times together, but
she was there</B>
<BR><B>when I got my first energy streak, the several moving orbs and some</B>
<BR><B>of the unexplained stuff. Lily came to me because her owner had
died</B>
<BR><B>and all stray animals seem to end up at Pattis house. At first Lily
wasnt</B>
<BR><B>that friendly, but eventually she came around and we became paranormal</B>
<BR><B>picture takers together.&nbsp; No matter where I took pictures in
our yard or in the</B>
<BR><B>house, Lily had to be with me.At the end, I depended on Lily to
help me</B>
<BR><B>find the best place to take paranormal pictures.</B>
<BR><B>On one occasion Lily was standing in the middle of the kitchen floor
and all of</B>
<BR><B>a sudden it was like someone had grabbed her by the fur on her back
and</B>
<BR><B>lifted her straight up and then whatever dropped her. She always
landed on</B>
<BR><B>her feet. This happened at least five times to the cat right in
front of me.</B>
<BR><B>One other time Lily was running through the door to go into the
house</B>
<BR><B>after a camera session, when I accidently shut the door on her.&nbsp;
After that</B>
<BR><B>Lily always made sure I was out of the way when she walked into
the house.</B>
<BR><B>Well this one particular day Lily let me know she wanted to go out.
I opened</B>
<BR><B>the kitchen door and then and went and opened the outside door.
As usual she</B>
<BR><B>waited a little time before walking by me., all of a sudden it was
like</B>
<BR><B>someone had kicked her in the butt and sent her flying at least
three feet in the</B>
<BR><B>air. They hit her so hard she spun around in mid air and landed
on the porch</B>
<BR><B>facing the other way. She landed on her feet, but she kept staring
at something</B>
<BR><B>on the porch that wasnt there.&nbsp; I have no doubt something paranormal
booted</B>
<BR><B>her butt.</B>
<BR><B>Now comes the story about how crazy lily decided to attack me. This
incident</B>
<BR><B>was to me more frightening than the big black dog incident that
I have</B>
<BR><B>already mentioned.&nbsp; This one day I was again walking in from
the front room</B>
<BR><B>into the kitchen when for some unknow reason Lily decides to jump
up on me</B>
<BR><B>clawing my legs up on the way down. Well when I yelled at Lily that
made her really</B>
<BR><B>her even more mad., She came up again jumped at my legs again scratching
them</B>
<BR><B>causing them to bleed. Now the look on the cat changed, she looked
like a</B>
<BR><B>crazed animal who was possessed. Each time I put my foot up or yelled
she would</B>
<BR><B>charge&nbsp; me again.&nbsp; Finally I had to give her a kick to
get her away from me.</B>
<BR><B>She just came back again like she didnt even feel it. This time
she jumped and</B>
<BR><B>up and bite me drawing blood again. Finally I was able to reach
a bench seat</B>
<BR><B>and turned it over to use as a shield. I was able to keep the bench
seat</B>
<BR><B>between Lily and I.&nbsp; I went out onto the porch and was bleeding
from my legs</B>
<BR><B>and hands by now, when my son and husband came home.&nbsp; I told
then the cat attacked</B>
<BR><B>me and they thought it was funny that I was crying over a cat, until
they saw</B>
<BR><B>my hands and legs.&nbsp; All three of us pushed the kitchen door
open only to</B>
<BR><B>see the cat still looking crazy sitting right on top of the bench
waiting for us.</B>
<BR><B>When my husband called her name she stared at him for a minute and
then looked</B>
<BR><B>like herself again. She didnt have that crazed look in her eyes.&nbsp;
As a precaution</B>
<BR><B>we kept her upstairs in her cage for the night.&nbsp; The next morning.
They went up</B>
<BR><B>to get the cat and the cat seemed all right. So we brought down
the cat, and we let</B>
<BR><B>him loose.&nbsp; I kept my distance from this crazy cat. She was
alright during the day, but</B>
<BR><B>when she entered my bedroom, I noticed she had that look in her
eyes again, and like</B>
<BR><B>before she charged me.&nbsp; My son was standing right beside me
so he grabbed something</B>
<BR><B>to keep the cat from getting to me.</B>
<BR><B>Well after that Lily became herself and like I said before, she
stayed with me whenever I took paranormal</B>
<BR><B>pictures. I would watch the way she acted and where she was looking
to get some good pictures. Alot of the</B>
<BR><B>pictures that I took that are on this website, Lily helped me get.</B>
<BR><B>Another story I want to tell you about happened in the middle of
the night.</B>
<BR><B>My husband and I were sleeping when we both jumped up out of bed.
I was screaming</B>
<BR><B>he was choking. There in the doorway was a blond young man in a
flannel shirt</B>
<BR><B>and jeans.&nbsp; When I saw him I yelled get out, because I thought
he came to</B>
<BR><B>take my husband.&nbsp; I then turned to make sure my husband was
ok, and when I looked</B>
<BR><B>back at the doorway the man was gone. I now felt that he wasnt there
to take</B>
<BR><B>my husband, but to help my husband.</B>
<BR><B>Over the last couple of years Ive started taking paranormal pictures.
Ive</B>
<BR><B>captured many pictures of large, small, see through, solid moving
orbs. Some</B>
<BR><B>even look like they have faces. I even captured a energy stream.&nbsp;
but for some reason</B>
<BR><B>since January this house has had a great increase in spirit activity.
Just today we had a very weird experience.</B>
<BR><B>Early this morning my husband and I were sleeping very close together.
when we both woke up</B>
<BR><B>suddenly,we both jumped up together., him choking and me wondering
what was going on. When out of the corner</B>
<BR><B>of my eye I could see a clear good sized orb floating down coming
toward</B>
<BR><B>my husband. I watched while it entered my husbands side, I then
felt it leave</B>
<BR><B>him travel through me and exit out my hand.&nbsp; At the time I
saw the orb enter my</B>
<BR><B>husband, I had my hand on his shoulder, so that is when it passed
through me. All I felt was a</B>
<BR><B>little bit of energy going through me before it exited. I asked
my husband if</B>
<BR><B>he felt anything when it went through, he said he felt nothning
because</B>
<BR><B>he was too busy choking.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Another incident happened two nights ago. I woke up in the middle
of the</B>
<BR><B>night hearing what sounded like someone pounding on the front door..
At first I thought</B>
<BR><B>I was dreaming because the dog should have been barking.&nbsp; Well
the pounding</B>
<BR><B>happened again, this time the dog went crazy.&nbsp; I jumped up
and woke my husband and told</B>
<BR><B>him that I had heard my daughter go out earlier, but never heard
her come back. I told hime</B>
<BR><B>I was sure it was the police saying she was in a accident. We went
to both doors, nothning., we</B>
<BR><B>went outside, no one around. We checked our daughters room and she
had come home and she</B>
<BR><B>was sleeping in her bed.</B>
<BR><B>We all went back into our beds and fell asleep for a few hours when
we were awoken by</B>
<BR><B>the sound of something like hitting the wall and falling to the
floor. We all got up again, checked</B>
<BR><B>everything, but we couldnt find a thing.&nbsp; Several hours go
by, I go to use my</B>
<BR><B>computer, but I cant find the mouse.&nbsp; I found it behind the
computeron the floor.&nbsp; In order to get it</B>
<BR><B>there you would have to drop it from the shelf into a box, get on
your hands and knees thread it through the desk</B>
<BR><B>with all the wires and pull it out of a little hole. We still dont
know who did it.</B>
<BR><B>but it had to be done on purpose, because it took alot of work to
get it on the floor.</B>
<BR><B>Another day last week I invited my niece over for the day with her
two kids. At supper time my</B>
<BR><B>little two and a half year old nephew tells us that a ghost just
hit him in the head. We all looked</B>
<BR><B>at each other, like do we believe him or not.&nbsp; I believed him,
I dont know if anyone else did.</B>
<BR><B>Well after supper my niece is getting the baby bundled up to leave
when I hear her scream from</B>
<BR><B>the kitchen. I went to see what was the matter, and she said" someone
just touched her hair". She thought it</B>
<BR><B>was my husband playing a joke on her. He wasnt even in the room.</B>
<BR><B>When my niece left I kept her son over night. I picked up my nephew
in my arms and looked out the window</B>
<BR><B>to watch my niece leave. All of a sudden I felt like someone was
playing with my hair on both sides</B>
<BR><B>of my head.&nbsp; I checked up in the air to see if I was feeling
the blind cord., There was no</B>
<BR><B>cord. All of a sudden I felt like a little charge of electricity
went through my head. I turned to look</B>
<BR><B>at my nephew and he was brushing something away from his head. I
think whatever was playing with my head,</B>
<BR><B>was playing with his.&nbsp; It was weird in one day we had three
incidents involving three different</B>
<BR><B>in my house.&nbsp; Of course while this was going on I was snapping
away. I got really good pictures of clear</B>
<BR><B>orbs areound the kids and my niece.</B>
<BR><B>Last but not least.&nbsp; These are some experiences Ive had out
of the house.</B>
<BR><B>On my last stay over visit at my sons house, I was awakened while
on the couch by what felt like something</B>
<BR><B>running under or through me on the couch.&nbsp; When I opened my
eyes I saw in the corner of the</B>
<BR><B>wall farthest from me, two little girls in pink party dresses with
their hair all in</B>
<BR><B>banana curls. Which takes these girls back aways. I forgot to tell
you they were twins.</B>
<BR><B>I knew somehow that they had been playing tag. They stayed there
for a second then disappeared.</B>
<BR><B>Another time, my husband and I were sleeping in a upstairs bedroom
in his deceased</B>
<BR><B>fathers house. The bedroom was at the top of the stairs. All of
a sudden I woke up to hear this heavy stomping</B>
<BR><B>of feet coming up the stairs, sounding like he was dragging something.
Whatever this was it sounded big.</B>
<BR><B>I waited to see what would appear when suddenly his father was standing
in</B>
<BR><B>the doorway. He just looked at me walked into the room went to his
son, and at that</B>
<BR><B>very moment his son woke up, and his fathers image disappeared.</B>
<BR><B>While at work this incident happened. I was riding in front of the
freight doors with my fork lift when</B>
<BR><B>something caught my eye to my right. There standing in between the
merchandise was a old man with white</B>
<BR><B>hair and old fashioned coveralls on.&nbsp;&nbsp; I ended up seeing
this old man three different times at work.&nbsp; I never</B>
<BR><B>mentioned this to anyone.</B>
<BR><B>One night while driving home with my son we were having a conversation
when my son said he had something to tell</B>
<BR><B>me and for me not to think he was crazy.&nbsp; On several occasions
he had seen this old man in coveralls</B>
<BR><B>standing in between the rows of product. When he would turn away
and look again he would disappear.&nbsp; This</B>
<BR><B>was the very same thing that I had seen.&nbsp; While we were still
driving home</B>
<BR><B>I was saying something strongly to my son when I saw out of the</B>
<BR><B>corner of my eye something grab him by the coat and shake his arm.</B>
<BR><B>I didnt say anything because I thought I may not have seen what
I thought I had.</B>
<BR><B>My son said to me " did you just see that"&nbsp; I replied what?
" someone just grabbed</B>
<BR><B>my jacket and shook my arm.&nbsp; This is another incident we both
saw.&nbsp; Later when we got to</B>
<BR><B>go into the owners office. I saw a picture of the old man. He was
the founder of the</B>
<BR><B>company.</B>
<BR><B>This story happened to the above son this New Years Eve .&nbsp;
I get this call from my son he is</B>
<BR><B>on his cellular phone and he has a story to tell me that I</B>
<BR><B>cant repeat to anyone.&nbsp; So remember you didnt read it hear.
lol.</B>
<BR><B>It seems the night before he was sleeping along side his wife and
new</B>
<BR><B>baby when for no reason he wakes up. He is laying there thinking
about all the weird</B>
<BR><B>stuff I talk about, mostly paranormal in nature. when out of the
corner</B>
<BR><B>of his eye he sees three balls of light moving near him.&nbsp; He
thinks he is seeing</B>
<BR><B>things so he turns his head for a minute and of course they disappear.</B>
<BR><B>He ends up falling asleep. A little time goes by and all of a sudden
he hears</B>
<BR><B>someone whispering in his ear. He cant make out what they say, but
he hears</B>
<BR><B>them clearly. He looks around the room, and sees the wife and baby
are still</B>
<BR><B>asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he is determined to stay awake in case someone
is trying to</B>
<BR><B>warn him of something.&nbsp; He makes it for a little while and
again he falls asleep.</B>
<BR><B>This time he feels someone sit on the bottom of the bed causing
the spring to</B>
<BR><B>make a noise.&nbsp; This kid is a big kid but now he is afraid.&nbsp;
He looks around</B>
<BR><B>sees his wife and baby still sleeping. Now he knows someone in the
family is trying to tell</B>
<BR><B>him something.&nbsp; Now he definitely is staying awake.&nbsp; Well
you know what happens next, he falls</B>
<BR><B>asleep again only to be awaken for the fourth time by someone grabbing
his ankle.&nbsp; This time he</B>
<BR><B>checks his family grabs a knife and sits on the couch until day
break. He was that sure</B>
<BR><B>that someone was trying to give him a warning.&nbsp; Nothning ever
happened that night.&nbsp; This</B>
<BR><B>incident happened in the house where I saw the two little girls
in pink dresses.</B>
<BR><B>Well that is a few stories from my vast experiences dealing with
strange things.&nbsp; Hope you</B>
<BR><B>liked them.&nbsp; Feel free to leave comments and you can post my

<P><B>Another Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: prefect@iprimus.com.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when i was 19 i was laying down in
the lounge room of a house when, all of a sudden, i could not move, a voise
said it is time to go, my left back part of my brain said (and this is
true) NO! NO! it is not your time, i said within my self, in the name of
the lord i will not go, after i said that i could move, death when it comes
is a strange thing, some of the dreams to are hard to understand , like
walking down the road one night, and seeing an arm made of some sort of
jelly roll down the road, this arm offended me so i grabed it and went
to the bottom of the road and threw it to the dark where only the white
gum trees could be seen. As i walked up the road ajoining i saw a friend
who was argueing with his brother, i tried to wave to him and get him to
notice me , but he didnt see me, so i walked up the road i came down, and
there were all these pens and papers all over the road i said to myself
i have to get this off the road so people can get through, as soon as i
started, a lady came out of a house and asked me to help her, i said no
i cannot, i have to get these papers and pens off the road, she said if
i help you will you help me? i said yes, so she took me to her house up
to a small room where her son was sitting, she said ill get the problem
thn asked if i wanted a glass of water? i declined, next thing the lady
came out with a big black dog, she wanted me to get rid of it because she
couldnt, i thought it wouldnt be a problem, the dog was calm untill i got
to the door it put up a bit of a fight , but i got it through the door
the stairs there were a sprial case, so i threw the dog over the side,
it fell into an abis what a dream, a week went past and my friend came
over and said he was going out onto the town i asked him not to go i said
it is dangerious , that night he was thrown out of a car at 60mph</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Preschool Mormon</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was a preschool teacher in Kentucky during the day and would lock/clean
up</B>
<BR><B>at 6:00&nbsp; pm every night.&nbsp; One evening, I was doing my
sweeping when the</B>
<BR><B>lights went off.&nbsp; since it was dark outside, I was scared but
I asked GOD to</B>
<BR><B>please put them back on.&nbsp; They came on, and I continued my
work and left.&nbsp; It</B>
<BR><B>was about two days later I was sweeping, when I heard the water
running in</B>
<BR><B>the bathroom.&nbsp; When I went in there, the sink was plugged up,
and full of</B>
<BR><B>water , with both faucets turned on.&nbsp; I cleaned up the water
and went out to</B>
<BR><B>finish my work.&nbsp; I never did feel anything to be afraid of
and wasn't</B>
<BR><B>frightened, so I continued&nbsp; my cleaning.&nbsp; Nothing happened
until the next</B>
<BR><B>week.&nbsp; I was emptying the trash and noticed movement out of
my left eye.</B>
<BR><B>Looking up, I saw a man, dressed in a black suit, white shirt with
a black</B>
<BR><B>hat.&nbsp; He had a white&nbsp; beard&nbsp; that went to his chest
and his face had the look</B>
<BR><B>of a person just out for a nice evening stroll.&nbsp; I&nbsp; put
the trash can down</B>
<BR><B>and proceeded to leave when I saw the same man coming back to go
the other</B>
<BR><B>way with the same look on his face he had the first time I saw him.&nbsp;
He</B>
<BR><B>didn't say anything to me, he just kept walking and disappeared.&nbsp;
The hallway</B>
<BR><B>didn't have any doors or windows to leave the building so where
did he go?&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>picked up my things to leave, and had the feeling that it didn't
want to hurt</B>
<BR><B>me just be with someone.&nbsp; I left and the next evening before
I started</B>
<BR><B>cleaning up, I asked this man to please leave me alone, that I had
things to</B>
<BR><B>do and wanted to get home to my family.&nbsp; It never bothered
me again.&nbsp; I don't</B>
<BR><B>know why it picked me to show itself to, but I don't think it would
have hurt</B>
<BR><B>me because when it came around I got the feeling it just wanted
to take a</B>
<BR><B>walk.&nbsp; I hope it had a nice walk and found what it was looking
for.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Pere Cheney Cemetary</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: nycki@bikinikill.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I live in a small northern Michigan town where there is not a whole
lot to do if you are not into outdoor activities. Since my dad was a young
kid, he and his friends would go out to the local haunt spot called Pere
Cheney. It is an old cemetary with about ten headstones and no remains
of a town. The town was affected severely by smallpox around 1890 or so.
It is a semi-popular party spot and unfortunatly several of the headstones
have been severly damaged and/or destroyed. Anyway, I have been out there
over 50 times and about 80% of the time, I see or hear something freaky.
I have only been out there once by myself and that was the time that I
was bombarded with all sorts of assaults on the senses. I had my car turned
off and the keys were in my lap when the radio turned on full blast, the
windows opened and closed (i have electric windows), and it felt like someone
was jumping on the back of the car. I was pretty scared but none of it
seemed violent, so I sat there in complete awe. All at once everything
stopped and I heard the creepiest giggling, like a little kid that had
evil on it's mind. I kept on seeing things in the corners of my eyes, and
a nasty smell was filling the car. I started to shake and I tried to start
my car but the engine wasn't turning over. I took a deep breath(as much
as I didn't want to) and tried to light a cigarette with matches and every
time I tried to light it, it was like someone was next to me blowing it
out. I yelled "quit it!" and all of a sudden there was a little girl standing
by my window smiling with turn of the century clothing on. She dissapeared
and I was finally able to start my car. I drove directly home and when
I got out of the car, there were handprints and footprints on the trunk
of my car. I had washed my car right before I went out to the cemetary
and the drive out there was rather dusty. I took some pictures out there
one time and there were little floating bubbles in almost every picture.
Well, that's one of my stories of the cemetary....</B>

<BR><B>One Last Good-Bye</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: theyoungs@cableone.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>While in the military, I had a roommate that loved to sleep in on
the weekends.&nbsp; So, I would try to be as quiet as a mouse whenever
I got up.&nbsp; One morning, still in my t-shirt and panties, I silently
got out of bed, and opened the curtains just enough to let some light in
to our dorm room so that I could organize my desk.&nbsp; After a few minutes,
I suddenly felt that someone or something besides my roommate and I was
in the room with us.</B>
<BR><B>Heart pounding, I turned slowly around to see a figure wearing a
red long sleeved shirt, jeans, and tan work boots on, bending over my sleeping
roommate, as if it was tucking her in for a good nights rest.&nbsp; Surprised,
I gasped, and the figure stood up, turned to its right took about three
steps and vanished.&nbsp; As it stood, I had gotten a good view of were
there used to be a head.</B>
<BR><B>Terrified, I took off out the door in my underwear in broad daylight
(not something that I have a habit of doing, as I am very self-conscious),
around to the other side of the building to my friend’s room.&nbsp; When
she opened the door, and saw me standing there white as a ghost and shaking
like a leaf, she pulled me inside, and I told her what I had just experienced.&nbsp;
Borrowing her robe, and bringing one of our male neighbors, we went back
to my room.</B>
<BR><B>When I was satisfied that the room was okay, and so was my roommate,
(she was rather unhappy that we woke her up to see if she was okay) I entered
the room.</B>
<BR><B>After explaining why we woke her, with tears in her eyes, she explained
who the figure was, and why he had visited her on that day.&nbsp; One year
to the day, her favorite uncle had committed suicide by blowing his head
off.&nbsp; When they found his body, he was wearing a red sweatshirt, jeans,
and tan work boots.&nbsp; He had apparently come to say good-bye one last
time.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>5 Minutes Ago</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sts@rica.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is my true experiance that happened only 5 minutes ago. I was
reloding my polaroid camera. I was sure that I did it right as I had many
times before. Well after I loaded it the black peice or the cover of the
film came out. Well I was almost ready to take my first picture when the
camera went berserk. All of the pictures were used up. They all landed
neatly&nbsp; on the floor in one neat stack. I decided to look at the picture.
9/10 were all blood red. But the very last one was black. With a strange
sort of figure standing tall and stern looking. I relized who this person
was. It was my father who did 6 years ago. I belive that he still haunts
this farm today tring to look out for the family he lost, but perhaps I
nor anyone else may never know.</B>

<P><B>Never Forget</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: death_skulz@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I was living in a little village called Moonan Flat, near Scone (In</B>
<BR><B>Australia if you are confused :)). We lived in a fairly old place
(I am not</B>
<BR><B>sure how old), on an old farm, about 20 minutes away from the little</B>
<BR><B>village. I lived with my father, stepmother, step sister, two half-sisters</B>
<BR><B>and my only brother. Dad and Sue (Stepmum) would ususally go to
Scone (About</B>
<BR><B>an hour an a half away), taking the kids and leaving my step sister</B>
<BR><B>(Crystal) and I alone until they returned. There is one particular
day they</B>
<BR><B>I will never forget . .</B>
<BR><B>It was about 11 am. Crystal and I were watching a the TV, getting
bored</B>
<BR><B>after a while, so we turned it off and went into the kitchen to
get a drink.</B>
<BR><B>When I returned to the living room, the TV was back on, and it was
tracking</B>
<BR><B>channels in (We only got the ABC and NBN, pretty sh#@%y :)). However,
when I</B>
<BR><B>returned with Crystal, it was turned off again (The Living room
is pretty</B>
<BR><B>much next to the kitchen). Crystal thought I was just messin with
her until</B>
<BR><B>she turned around and noticed that in a picture above the fireplace,
the</B>
<BR><B>reflection was moving around as if from that heat shimmer thing
(It had</B>
<BR><B>glass over the painting), however, it was the middle of summer (I
think) and</B>
<BR><B>no fire had been lit for quite some time (That I am absolutly sure
of), like</B>
<BR><B>a couple of weeks at least. Needless to say this freaked us out,
so we</B>
<BR><B>thought "bugger this" and went outside to wait for our parents to
get back.</B>
<BR><B>After about a minute I reckon of waiting, we heard the most blood
curdling</B>
<BR><B>scream I have ever heard in my short life (I am only 16, this happenend
when</B>
<BR><B>I was about 12), it was a scream of utter terror. We ran back into
the</B>
<BR><B>house, back into the living room and waited. The heat shimmer thingie
in the</B>
<BR><B>picture had stopped as well. I do remember it being colder than
usual, even</B>
<BR><B>for being up in the moutains, and it was only colder in the living
room. I</B>
<BR><B>can't explain it and I have never been back to that house since
we moved.</B>
<BR><B>Also, Sue and Crystal often said that they would be woken up in
the middle</B>
<BR><B>of the night by heavy footsteps on the porch, when they were the
only people</B>
<BR><B>in the house. They also said that one night they awoke to the sound
of a</B>
<BR><B>violin playing, again on the porch. I never liked the house, it
was really</B>
<BR><B>run down.</B><B></B>
