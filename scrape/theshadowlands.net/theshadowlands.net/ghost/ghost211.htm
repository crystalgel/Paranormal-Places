<p><b>House I Grew Up In</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mark.parisi@verizon.net</b>
<br><b>Hello. My name is Renee.&nbsp; My mother and myself have both had
encounters in</b>
<br><b>the house that I grew up in.&nbsp; Upon waking in the morning, when
fully</b>
<br><b>conscious, I have felt something walking on my stomach (like that
of a cat)</b>
<br><b>and when I finally did dare to open my eyes, nothing was there and
the</b>
<br><b>footsteps stopped.&nbsp; My mother has had this same experience
numerous times in</b>
<br><b>the same room.&nbsp; A strong presence could be felt also.&nbsp;
It always seemed like</b>
<br><b>someone was in the room watching you.&nbsp; Also once when my mother
was away on</b>
<br><b>vacation, she asked me to stay over to take care of the house.&nbsp;
She told me</b>
<br><b>not to stay in her room.&nbsp; But since it was the most comfortable
place to</b>
<br><b>sleep, I did so anyway.&nbsp; When I stayed in her room, I was awakened
in the</b>
<br><b>middle of the night by a feeling of coldness on my wrist.&nbsp;
I screamed and</b>
<br><b>called my cat to see if she would come stay with me.&nbsp; She walked
over to the</b>
<br><b>doorway and then would not step foot inside.&nbsp; This was very
unusual behavior</b>
<br><b>for her as she always came when I called her.&nbsp; I then felt
something scratch</b>
<br><b>my leg (under the blanket) and two large cuts (approx. 1/2 in. wide
each and</b>
<br><b>several inches long) appeared on the shin of my right leg.&nbsp;
After that</b>
<br><b>experience, I never went into my old house again by myself.Other
instances</b>
<br><b>that have happened include my mother lying in bed with her boyfriend
and</b>
<br><b>having the bed shake violently.&nbsp; Also the landlord used to
work in the</b>
<br><b>carpenter shop downstairs and he used to tell us that he would hear
loud</b>
<br><b>footsteps even though no one was home.&nbsp; I am reluctant to tell
anyone other</b>
<br><b>than close family about our experiences because I feel like people
may not</b>
<br><b>believe it.&nbsp; My fiance does believe me because he saw the actual
scratches</b>
<br><b>on my leg when I got home the next morning.</b>

<br><b>ball,well actually he ran over it with the</b>
<br><b>lawn-mower,but he brought it inside,we have it at our</b>
<br><b>house now.But we suspect that our house was on an old</b>
<br><b>battle ground site.</b>
<br><b>when i was four my grandmother died thus leaving me</b>
<br><b>with one grandparent,my grandmother from my fathers</b>
<br><b>side.we moved into this house.Nothing started</b>
<br><b>happining until i was 8 thou.</b>
<br><b>When i was 8 i got a drum-set for Christmas,a couple</b>
<br><b>of months later i was reading a book and i put it down</b>
<br><b>to to take a sip of my drink,i was siting on the sofa</b>
<br><b>which was right next to the room my drums are in,i saw</b>
<br><b>a very destinct looking figure of a man wearing jeans</b>
<br><b>a Tie-dye T-shirt,he had long hair in braids he was</b>
<br><b>siting at the chair at my drums.I ran out of the</b>
<br><b>room.Some time later i was walking past our stair</b>
<br><b>case.I freaked out.</b>
<br><b>Last year one of my dogs died,one night i heared the</b>

<br><b>but soon i fell back asleep.</b>
<br><b>This year one night i woke up,i was choking i couldent</b>

<br><b>during the night feeling sick.last week i heared</b>
<br><b>something like a dog yelping loudly in the street</b>
<br><b>infront of our house.Last night i heared a cat in our</b>

<p><b>Husbands Death</b><b></b>

<p><b>my husband had diabetes, was 56 yrs old went to work one day and
I had an</b>
<br><b>appointment for the hair salon at 1:30 p.m. I went upstairs to my
bedroom to</b>
<br><b>get ready to leave for the hair appt at 12:45 I was in front of
my dresser</b>
<br><b>when i felt very cold. As I stood there, I got progressivly colder,
so cold</b>
<br><b>that I felt it right to my bones and I said out loud to nobody,
as I was</b>
<br><b>totally alone in the house, " why on earth am I so cold" Let me
add that the</b>
<br><b>date was April 27th and the weather was warm. Just then the phone
rang. It</b>
<br><b>was my husbands boss at work telling me he had fallen and was taken
by</b>
<br><b>ambulance to the hospital. I phoned my son and he and his wife took
me to the</b>
<br><b>hospital where we were told by the doctors that at 12:47 my husband
had died</b>
<br><b>instantly from a massive heart attack. This is what made him fall.
He was</b>
<br><b>dead before he hit the floor. It was at that time that I felt that
terrible</b>
<br><b>cold and to this day I swear he came to say good bye.</b>

<br><b>Grandpa</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>OK my grandpa died when I was 3 so I didn't really know what kind
of a person he was but I knew what he looked like.</b>
<br><b>I was visiting my grandma in the country my family and I were visiting
for a week.</b>
<br><b>Let me tell you what the house set up was first , there was a hallway
that lead to the guest room bedroom. If you went down the hall you would
see a verandah for the front door , farther down you would come to my grandmas
bedroom also on the left side , then of course the guest bedroom.</b>
<br><b>On the 3rd day of the visit I was walking to the bedroom when I
saw a ghostly shape that looked like my grandpa.</b>
<br><b>Seeing this I ran to my parents and grandma tolled them what I saw.&nbsp;
They believed me , that comforted me so I went to bed.</b>
<br><b>The next day was good I didn't see any "ghost" or anything weird
but&nbsp; on the second last day of the visit something weird happened.</b>
<br><b>I was lying on my bed wide awake then some thing caught my eye ,
I looked up at the head of my bed and saw a ghostly white hand move across&nbsp;
then disappear. I lay there to frightened to move I mean I was 6. Anyway
I waited a few seconds then something grabbed my pillow and it was pulling
it under the bed I pulled it back and waited for it to pull back , but
nothing happened.I'll tell you this it was SCARY.</b>
<br><b>In present days I haven't encountered anything UN normal around
my grandmas house so I guess that that was a once in a life time experience.</b>

<p><b>Spooky Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jandhlee@rmi.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm by no means a pychic, but when I was a young child I'm thinking
around four, my Mother and I had a very spooky experience.&nbsp; Where
I grew up is near the Santa Fe Trail.&nbsp; We had a screened in pourch
that we would spend our summer days and drink iced tea.&nbsp; One evening
getting ready for bed, my mom went to retrive our empty cups.&nbsp; I heard
a scream, I ran to her side and she begged me to get the cups.&nbsp; As
I went into the pourch I noticed a figure standing on the oppisite of the
door leading to the outside.&nbsp; I could make out old clothes and long
hair.&nbsp; The moon was full on the other side of her.&nbsp; So I could
make out her fly aways in her hair and she wore a shawl and long dress.&nbsp;
I couldn't see her face because the moon was too bright and her hair covered
it.&nbsp; My mother who is a chicken was in hysterics and wanted me back
inside.&nbsp; It has always caught my imagination that I wasn't to scared.&nbsp;
I tease my mom now and all she'll admit she didn't know what it was.&nbsp;
I have witnessed alot and my son who is now four sees things too.&nbsp;
My husband and I lost our first daughter six years ago to a still birth.&nbsp;
My son of course never met her.&nbsp; When he was 2 1/2 he was talking
to "agirl" as he put it, I blew it off thinking it was play.&nbsp; That
weekend we went to the cemetary and our baby has an Angel on her headstone,
my son got very excited to see "that girl"!!!&nbsp; Goosebumps went up
and down my body!!&nbsp; He has shared stories about seeing a girl floating
above his bed that looks like mommy!&nbsp; I believe him because he doesn't
lie or tell wild stories!!&nbsp; We're very honest on what happened to
his sister in hopes we don't scare him.&nbsp; Last weekend he came into
our bed in the morning and said Mommy, Aashlyn touched my head.&nbsp; I
asked him where were you guys at?&nbsp; He looks at me and says right here
mommy, between you and daddy!!&nbsp; So your right ghosts are everywhere
even in our beds!!!!</b><b></b>

<br><b>I Saw Me as a Skeleton</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: skylernv@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was about 6 or 7 I was sleeping one night when I was woken
up by a</b>
<br><b>skeleton who rised up next to me.&nbsp; He looked at me and as I
rised up slowely</b>
<br><b>out of bed, he sunk back down to where I could not see him.&nbsp;
I felt a really</b>
<br><b>close connection to him for the longest time and could not figure
out why.</b>
<br><b>It has only been through reading your website and putting some more
thought</b>
<br><b>into the matter that I have come to the conclusion that it had to
be me.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>know this sounds wierd but it has to be, because I can now relive
that</b>
<br><b>moment through both myself as the 6/7 year old and I can see myself
sitting</b>
<br><b>on the bed from where the skeleton would have seen me.&nbsp; Wierd,
ne?&nbsp; Also, a</b>
<br><b>little side note, all my life I have been able to do this little
trick that</b>
<br><b>is wierd.&nbsp; I can "burn out my insides".&nbsp; It sounds wierd
but thats the only</b>
<br><b>way to describe it.&nbsp; I can do it on will, it dosen't hurt;
it feels really</b>

<br><b>I See the Living</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: blhobson@eol.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>Before I begin telling you what I see, I would like to tell you some
history of my family.&nbsp; I am native aboriginal and my parents are from
two separate tribes. Their joining was nothing out of the ordinary save
for the respective backgrounds.&nbsp; Like many other cultures, there are
social hierarcies - my mother's side of the family came from warriors and
chiefs while my dad's side came from shaman. We were raised with very traditional
beliefs and practices.</b>
<br><b>In 1994, my father past away.&nbsp; That is when my experiences
began.&nbsp; When alive, spirits (people still living) would come to my
father at night when he was sleeping and awake him.&nbsp; On many occasions,
when I visited Dad, he would say things, "Never let them scare you. or
Ignore them if you want them to go away."&nbsp; Since his death, I have
had three visits from people (relatives) who were about to die.&nbsp; As
my father would say, "They are visiting and saying good-bye to you."</b>
<br><b>When my dad was alive, he would go to people and assist in their
spiritual preparations.&nbsp; Since his death I feel like the torch has
been past onto me.&nbsp; Do you know of ways or people that I can contact
to help develop this inheritance?</b>
<br><b>To describe the experiences, they are similar. Like my dad used
to say, "They don't look like that in real life."&nbsp; The three times
that I've been visited, two relatives have died - one uncle and one auntie.
The third and most recent, three weeks ago coincided with the birth of
my third grand-nephew.&nbsp; I'm sure you're wondering - well that was
a birth not a death. That's what puzzling!</b>
<br><b>When the spirits come, I wake fully from sleep to find them staring
directly into my eyes.&nbsp; My Auntie Annie appeared as a little girl
in old-fashioned clothes. She stood beside the bed, near my left arm, body
faced toward me, looking down.&nbsp; Her brown eyes piercing. As I looked
into hers, she turned and began to walk away yet her spirit did not have
legs. By the time she reached the foot of the bed, her presence had faded
with each step until she was gone completely.&nbsp; I reached for the flash-light
on the nightstand, beside the bed, and went to look for her, but she was
gone.&nbsp; I didn't feel a thing in the house as I tried to expand my
mind.</b><b></b>

<br><b>I ThinkI Had an Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sabrina_ejh1@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>On June 3rd, at around noon, I went with my mother and grandmother
to the cemetery to visit my uncle and my great-grandpa in their niche in
the main office.</b>
<br><b>I was walking down the rows, looking at all of the names on the
walls in the isles, and my mom called out to me to come look out the window
in the back that overlooks one of the cemetery yards where my great-grandpa's
2nd wife is buried. I turned around because I suddenly got cold, and I
looked down the row to my left, and I saw a potted tree branch moving up
and down like there was someone playing on it, but there was no one there!
I looked and then it stopped, and then as I was walking away, it started
again. I might mention that there was no breeze inside the office, and
it wasn't windy outside. I kept walking into cold spots in the office.</b>
<br><b>I heard thumping, and it sounded like someone was walking with boots
on through the rows, and I didn't stay around to find out. My grandma and
my mother and I were the only ones inside the office. I herded my grandma
and my mom out of there, and I was shaking as I got into the van. I have
no idea what happened, but it scared the hell out of me. I told my boyfriend
what happened, and he said that it was nothing to worry about, and I told
my mom, and she looked at me like I had 2 heads. I am trying to talk my
boyfriend into going back with me, but I don't want to go there alone again.
How do I go about finding out what I saw on sunday?</b>
<br><b>Thank you for reading this.</b>

<p><b>Very Real</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Sgaston@amesinternational.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I had a couple of experiences with some ghosts that is very real.&nbsp;
I've</b>
<br><b>always beleived in ghosts, but never thought that I would come in
contact</b>
<br><b>with one.&nbsp; It all happen when I moved out of my mom's house
into my own 1</b>
<br><b>bedroom apartment w/ my daughter.&nbsp; I only had a reclining chair
in the</b>
<br><b>living room (no furniture).&nbsp; The chair sat facing the hallway
towards the</b>
<br><b>bathroom &amp; the front door. At times when I was alone in my house,
I would</b>
<br><b>see in the corner of my eye, someone walking in the hallway.&nbsp;
But everytime</b>
<br><b>I looked straight forward, nothing was there.&nbsp; And other times,
I would see</b>
<br><b>someone peeking around the corner w/ just the forehead and the eyes
looking</b>
<br><b>at me.&nbsp; I didn't think much of it and I still don't, but it
scares me.</b>
<br><b>A couple months ago (May), things started to get really spooky.&nbsp;
The hallway</b>
<br><b>started to get really cold.&nbsp; I would have the heat on to 80
degrees and the</b>
<br><b>entire apartment would be hot, but the hallway would be cold, like
a walk-in</b>
<br><b>freezer.&nbsp; Well anyway, I was laying on an air matress with
my daughter</b>
<br><b>sleeping next to me.&nbsp; We were laying with our heads towards
the hallway</b>
<br><b>(facing away from it).&nbsp; It was pitch black and all of the sudden,
I heard</b>
<br><b>footsteps behind my head.&nbsp; I could hear every step taken.&nbsp;
My eyes were wide</b>
<br><b>open but I was too scared to move.&nbsp; Then I saw shadows standing
next to me.</b>
<br><b>There were (I believe) 4 of them.&nbsp; I could see the outline
of their heads &amp;</b>
<br><b>shoulders, no face.&nbsp; One reached down and started choking me
(I think it was</b>
<br><b>a man, bec of the broad shoulders).&nbsp; I could see the outlining
of his arms</b>
<br><b>coming towards me.&nbsp; I couldn't move, I was gasping for air.&nbsp;
I couldn't</b>
<br><b>scream or anything.&nbsp; I tried to reach for my daughter, but
couldnt even do</b>
<br><b>that.&nbsp; Then it stopped.&nbsp; I ran to turn on the lamp and
looked at the clock.</b>
<br><b>It was 320am.&nbsp; It was really strange &amp; scary bec I never
sleep on my back</b>
<br><b>(tummy sleeper) and I was laying on my back while it was choking
me.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>stayed up a little bit after that &amp; watched some t.v., but was
so tired, I</b>
<br><b>my eyes were getting droopy.&nbsp; So I shut the t.v. off (the lamp
was still on)</b>
<br><b>and I was laying on my back again and the comforter on top of my
chest</b>
<br><b>started to sink and I started to get short breathed.&nbsp; I couldnt
sleep</b>
<br><b>anymore so I stayed up and watched t.v. all night.&nbsp; I started
sleeping in my</b>
<br><b>daughters room after that.</b>
<br><b>About a week later I called my mom and asked her when she goes to
the temple</b>
<br><b>(we're Buddhist) to bring me some holywater.&nbsp; She kept asking
why, I didn't</b>
<br><b>want to tell her, but I did anyway.&nbsp; She went and told one
of the Monks and</b>
<br><b>the next day, my house was blessed.&nbsp; Nothing happened for a
while.&nbsp; I would</b>
<br><b>still see a shadow walking in my hallway &amp; someone peeking around
the</b>
<br><b>corner, but figured my house was safe bec of the blessing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
About 2 weeks</b>
<br><b>later, I started to get this sour smell in the bedroom.&nbsp; I
thought my</b>
<br><b>daughter spilt milk on the carpet.&nbsp; I looked everywhere and
cleaned every</b>
<br><b>peice of the carpet from where that smell was from.&nbsp; I couldnt
get rid of</b>
<br><b>the smell.&nbsp; Everybody who entered the room, smelled it, it
was like sour</b>
<br><b>milk.&nbsp; My friend came to sleepover one night, we were up pretty
late talking</b>
<br><b>and I finally went to sleep (in my daughter's room).&nbsp; My freind
was watching</b>
<br><b>t.v. in the living room and I remember laying on the air matress,
turning</b>
<br><b>back &amp; forth, trying to get confortable.&nbsp; I had a nightlight
on in the room</b>
<br><b>(it was really bright, you can see everything), and all while I
was tossing</b>
<br><b>&amp; turning, I ended up on my back and something was choking me
again.&nbsp; Again,</b>
<br><b>my eyes were open, but I didnt see anything this time.&nbsp; I tried
to move my</b>
<br><b>arms up, to push it away, but I couldnt move.&nbsp; I tried to yell
my friends</b>
<br><b>name, but just moaning came out.&nbsp; I could hear myself breathing,
but I</b>
<br><b>couldnt move.&nbsp; I wasnt scared, I just wanted it to stop.&nbsp;
Finally, it</b>
<br><b>stopped and I looked at the clock, it was the same time, 320am.&nbsp;
I ran out</b>
<br><b>to the living room where my friend was and I asked her if she could
hear me.</b>
<br><b>She said she heard me moaning, but thought I was doing it in my
sleep.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>told her what happened and we stayed up all night together.</b>

<p><b>In Response to "Strange Phenonmenon"</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: shelleyahughes@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I recently read "Srange Phenomenon" on page eight and found many
similarities to my own story. Link : http://theshadowlands.net/ghost/ghost61.htm#phenom.
I was wondering if you could post this beneath it. I was really excited
to find a similar experience. Thank you for posting these stories.</b>
<br><b>I am now 24 but the event happened when I was 19. My best friend
Lacey was dating a guy named John. His father had a heart attack and died
at home with John there trying to save him but it was a massive heart attack
and he didn't make it. Apparently John's dad was not fond of his girlfriend
Lacey. I attended the funeral&nbsp; with Lacey and John and it was a very
sad occasion athough nothing seemed out of the ordinary. About a week later
Lacey and I were driving down the road with the windows rolled down on
both sides because it was a warm summer evening. She started to talk about
John's dad saying she wondered if he ever watched over her and John. Then
she added that she doubted it because he was a mean man and he hated her.
She went on for a few minutes explaining how he treated her. Then she said,
"He was not a nice person, he was evil, I know he is in hell."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;We were stopped at a light in the turn lane at the time. As
soon as those last words came out of her mouth "something" flew through
my car. It was a physical object but seemed to be made of white light or
smoke and was slightly illuminated. It sounded like some type of whistling
fire cracker or something and I felt a breeze go by my face.&nbsp; It was
twisting in circles around itself at a fast past as it flew in my window
(driver side) right in front of my face then right in front of lacey's
fast and out the passenger window. It seemed like it was in slow motion
and the phsyical presence was so strong that we both pushed our heads against
the headrest as hard as we could so that it would not hit our faces. As
soon as it exited her window i looked over at her with my head still pushed
against the seat and she had hers pushed against the seat as well. We knew
it was not a firecracker or anything explainable. I immediatley asked her
what the heck it was and she was beginning to cry and sink down in the
seat to hide toward the floor board of my car. Before i could even say
anything else "something" dropped in my backseat. It felt and sounded like
someone had dropped a 50 lb feed bag in my back seat from above. My whole
car bounced in response. I again looked at Lacey and said what the h@#$
was that!" At that point the light and turned green and I turned into a
parking lot where we both immediately jumped out of the car. I opened all
the doors and the trunk trying to find an explanation. Lacey was still
crying and shaking. We both agreed that we thought it was Jon's dad's ghost.
We couldn't get back in the car right away but eventually we had to. It
was a very scary experience and we never talk about his dad anymore unless
we are telling the story.</b>
<br><b>I don't think anyone really believes us when we tell the story but
we know it happened. We felt the breeze, both of our heads were pushed
against the seat and we both felt my car bounce. There is no way it could
have been a coincidence. I have found stories that tell about ghosts "dropping"
into chairs but until now have not found one about the "thing" that flew
through my car right in front of our faces. Thank you for submitting the
story it's nice to know we aren't the only ones this has happened to. I
hope this gives you some reassurance that your mother's story is true.</b>
<br><b>If you have had any other similar responses please pas them on,
I would be interested in reading them.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Is This For Real???</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Sassiebutsweet29@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Is this for real?.....Thats the question i get asked everytime i
tell my</b>
<br><b>stories or someone comes to visit me in my home......I'm living
in a home</b>
<br><b>that i moved into about 7 years ago...its a pretty old house...some
of the</b>
<br><b>closets still even have the old time doors and door knobs on them
that you</b>
<br><b>had to have a special old key to get into.....Anyway....let me share
with you</b>
<br><b>the things that have been going on in my home and then you can judge
for</b>
<br><b>yourself.</b>
<br><b>My first dealing with the paranormal was back in October of 94...i
was</b>
<br><b>sitting in my living room and notice out of the corner of my eye
something</b>
<br><b>walking through my hallway leading from the kitchen to my sons room...I
didnt</b>
<br><b>really think anything of it at first except a glare from a cars
headlights</b>
<br><b>passing by outside....a few moments later my son had woke up and
came into</b>
<br><b>the living room and asked if i came in his room and fixed his pillow....of</b>
<br><b>course i said no because i had been sitting there watching a movie.
I got up</b>
<br><b>and walked him back to bed....and turned on the bathroom light for
him that</b>
<br><b>was in hallway as he needs light to help him sleep better.</b>
<br><b>I decided to switch where i was sitting so that i could watch the
hallway</b>
<br><b>while i finished watching my movie. A short time later i saw something
that</b>
<br><b>was to unbelievable for me...the shadow that i had seen earlier
was not a</b>
<br><b>shadow at all....it was a figure of a woman floating through the
hallway in</b>
<br><b>the same direction as before from the kitchen to my sons room...i
could only</b>
<br><b>see the left side of the womans body and face she was translucent
but i could</b>
<br><b>tell she was wearing a very old fashion dress her hair was very
long. Not</b>
<br><b>once did she ever look my way or look around...just straight ahead
towards my</b>
<br><b>sons room. Her feet werent even touching the floor. I of course
couldnt move</b>
<br><b>at this point...i was frightened at what i saw. I waited about 5
minutes</b>
<br><b>before actually getting up.....and as i was rounding the corner
to my sons</b>
<br><b>room my son and i ran right into one another....of course scaring
me to death</b>
<br><b>again....he asked the same questioned as before..."Mommy why do
you keep</b>
<br><b>fixing my pillow?"....this time i just told him i came in because
he was</b>
<br><b>laying awkward and didnt look comfortable so i fixed him up so he
would sleep</b>
<br><b>better....but that wasnt the case at all...i never went in his room...only</b>
<br><b>the time to walk him back to bed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never saw the woman again until a few
weeks later when my niece had</b>
<br><b>spent the night with me she was 19 at the time and was sitting on
the couch</b>
<br><b>where i had sat the last time i saw the woman and quickly screamed
for me to</b>
<br><b>come down stairs..she told me she saw a woman leaving the kitchen
and going</b>
<br><b>into my sons room....and swore the woman was a ghost. The woman
never bothers</b>
<br><b>anyone and its seems to be the same routine with her...and the same
direction</b>
<br><b>everytime we see her....I can say I've seen this woman at least
8 times in</b>
<br><b>the last 7 years ive lived here.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, my story doesnt end there with just
the woman...several nights i</b>
<br><b>have heard voices of children coming from the upstairs across from
where my</b>
<br><b>daughter sleeps...this happens during the day when my children are
at school</b>
<br><b>and I am home alone...and it happens at night when everyone is sleeping.</b>
<br><b>Footsteps are heard by anyone that comes to visit coming from the
upstairs.</b>
<br><b>Things my husband and children and i know that we have placed somewhere
come</b>
<br><b>up missing. Also..when my children were very small...around 4 and
5...they</b>
<br><b>are now 9 and 7 they claim to have seen a man in the upstairs closet
in the</b>
<br><b>bedroom across from daughters bedroom....they even were able to
describe this</b>
<br><b>man as having long reddish brown hair...blue eyes and a mustache
and beard</b>
<br><b>same color as his hair....they said the man didnt move or talk....just
stood</b>
<br><b>there and smiled at them. (freaky, huh?)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last thing i will tell
you which still kinda spooks me til this</b>
<br><b>day is about 4 years ago my niece and i were upstairs picking up
some broken</b>
<br><b>glass from where my daughter had dropped a picture frame and the
glass</b>
<br><b>shattered in the "closet"...see the pattern here?....Anyway.....she
picked up</b>
<br><b>a sliver of glass...and pulled back her finger and yelled out ...OUCH...as
if</b>
<br><b>she had been cut from the glass...but she looked down and no cut
or blood was</b>
<br><b>visable...but (and heres the freaky part) when i reached for a piece
of glass</b>
<br><b>with my fingers...i noticed droplets of blood coming from my finger
and i</b>
<br><b>hadnt even touched the glass yet and there was a cut on my index</b>
<br><b>finger...same hand same finger as my niece claimed she had been
cut by</b>
<br><b>glass....but no evidence of it. (Very strange)...all of this is
very</b>
<br><b>true...some say im crazy...some believe it and have witnessed it...Now
u can</b>
<br><b>be the judge of whether this is for real or not.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Might also help to tell you that since
i was 8 years old i've been able</b>
<br><b>to see and hear things that no one else could...I am now almost
30 and still</b>
<br><b>go through the same things...dreaming of things before they happen...seeing</b>
<br><b>my dead great aunt and actually being able to talk with her?....I
used to</b>
<br><b>think i was crazy myself..haha...but I've experienced way too many
things in</b>
<br><b>my life to truly believe its just all in my head.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Itty Bitty Fingernails</b>
<br><b>By: Claudia.Jimenez@sf.fk.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This story was told to me by my boyfriend.&nbsp; It regards the tale
of his Great Grandfather in Guatemala.&nbsp; It was told that upon returning
home on horseback from a long day of agricultural work on his plantation
he heard a baby wailing off the side of the road.&nbsp; Since he was a
kind-hearted gentleman, he decided to stop his horse and look to see where
the crying was coming from.&nbsp; Lo and behold he found a dirty bundle
of blankets wiggling and the wailing seemed to be coming from there.&nbsp;
He picked up the bundle and unwrapped the face, suddenly the baby stopped
crying.&nbsp; He mounted his horse carefully as not to drop the baby and
continued on his way.&nbsp; A while later he noticed that the baby was
very still, thinking it was asleep and remembering how much peace his own
children brought him when they were asleep, he decided to take a peep.&nbsp;
Upon unwrapping the baby, he gasped to see that it was no longer a human
child, but a horse's head on a baby's body.&nbsp; It soon started to laugh
a demonic laugh and pulled out his arms to show him his long protruding
fingernails and said "Loooook, looook, look at my itty bitty fingernails."</b><b></b>

<p><b>I've Seen a Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dlmfly1@neonline.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>It was on halloween when my friend&nbsp; Holly&nbsp; said : "I dare
you to go to the grave yard&nbsp; tonight". I said ok I'm not afraid of
anything. I didnt even believe in ghost untill that night. At 8:00 I was
in the grave yard&nbsp; with one flash light and one set of batteries.
I wasnt scared till I heard a branch break. Than I herd little foot steps.
Pretty soon I got scared&nbsp; and sat&nbsp; by a tree waiting untill 11:00
that was when I could leave the grave yard. At first I thought it was Holly
trying to scare me. I was looking around to see&nbsp; if I could see her
but when I looked the other direction&nbsp; I saw a big light. I was staring
at it . I&nbsp; saw something in the light it looked almost like a face&nbsp;&nbsp;
and it was standing there like I was a enemy that most be destroy. I&nbsp;
for got all about the bet and ran for my life.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Just Plain Strange</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:c.frazier@sympatico.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi,&nbsp; I don't know if this falls into a "haunting" category but
I thought</b>
<br><b>I'd share my story.&nbsp; My family had a cottage in a clearing
by a lake.</b>
<br><b>Our cottage was almost completely surrounded by forest.&nbsp; There
was a</b>
<br><b>dirt path that cut through the trees and eventually became our</b>
<br><b>driveway.&nbsp; Being 8 and curious, my parents would allow me to
roam the</b>
<br><b>woods around our cottage as long as I took our German Sheppard with
me.</b>
<br><b>She was an older dog who ALWAYS stayed by my side, especially during</b>
<br><b>excursions.&nbsp; One morning I decided to take a stroll through
one of my</b>
<br><b>many beaten paths in the bush and pick some wild strawberries.&nbsp;
As I was</b>
<br><b>bent down foraging I hear my dog growl.&nbsp; I though nothing of
it (she was</b>
<br><b>so protective of me that the slightest noise would set her off).&nbsp;
A few</b>
<br><b>moments later I noticed she was no longer by my side, I began to
call</b>
<br><b>her name but to no avail. I decided to start back to the cottage</b>
<br><b>thinking she got tired of waiting on me and made her way back.&nbsp;
As I</b>
<br><b>walked down the path a heard a loud "crash" like a falling tree
and</b>
<br><b>turned in the direction of the sound. I gazed upon a rocky hill
covered</b>
<br><b>in moss and fallen debris. the sun was shining brightly through
the</b>
<br><b>canopy and I had to squint.&nbsp; Something VERY large was quickly
climbing</b>
<br><b>this small hill with it's back to me.&nbsp; I froze thinking it
was a bear</b>
<br><b>until I realized that it was white and seemed to have a shawl or
wide</b>
<br><b>belt tied around it's waist.&nbsp; It was about 6 to 7 feet high
and as broad</b>
<br><b>as a grizzly bear.&nbsp; Moments later my dog came running out of
nowhere as</b>
<br><b>if she'd been chasing it.&nbsp; As my dog began to bark and bear
her teeth,</b>
<br><b>the thing turned towards us and I was unable to make out any features</b>
<br><b>(due to the sun or my child's mind blocking it, I cannot recall)
and</b>
<br><b>immediately, it vanished.&nbsp; I ran home screaming and my parents
quickly</b>
<br><b>ran to meet me as I cam crashing out of the bush with dog in tow.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>started rambling on and unable to make any sense of what I was saying
my</b>
<br><b>parents consoled me and brushed off the experience as being</b>
<br><b>imagination.&nbsp; For the next few nights, I heard rustling noises
and what</b>
<br><b>sounded like a growling hum???outside my window.&nbsp; Even though
my shade</b>
<br><b>was down ( it the type that blocks out all light).&nbsp; There was
an</b>
<br><b>orange-red glow shinning through the sides of the shades.&nbsp;
I didn't''</b>
<br><b>sleep a wink.&nbsp; The noise continued&nbsp; and my dog sat at
the foot of the</b>
<br><b>window growling softly all night.&nbsp; I was reluctant to tell
my parents of</b>
<br><b>this for fear they would not believe me but it was clear to them
(by the</b>
<br><b>bags under my eyes) that something was wrong.&nbsp; Finally I broke
down and</b>
<br><b>told them the story, my father immediately said it was probably
the</b>
<br><b>neighbors 12 and 14 year old sons trying to scare me.&nbsp; We later
found</b>
<br><b>out that our neighbors were away in the Netherlands for the month</b>
<br><b>visiting relatives and the next closest neighbor was 3 miles away.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>only way to access the front of our cottage (short of tramping through</b>
<br><b>the dense bush) was to come up the dirt path.&nbsp; If this was
the case, I</b>
<br><b>should have heard footsteps as the approaching person came up the
gravel</b>
<br><b>entrance to our lot or the stoned walkway directly in front of my</b>
<br><b>window.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Kentucky Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: robin005@gte.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>The only experience I've had myself was when I was about ten to twelve</b>
<br><b>yrs. old. My sister and I were sleeping in the same bed and we were</b>
<br><b>woken up by the sound of a horse whinnying by our bed. We scooted,</b>
<br><b>terrified, back against the wall and listened for several minutes
to the</b>
<br><b>sound of the horse breathing. The property our house was on was
a brick</b>
<br><b>yard in the late 1800's, so I can imagine that there were plenty
of work</b>
<br><b>horses around the place in those times. That may explain our experience.</b>
<br><b>However, my mother has several stories to tell and I can personally</b>
<br><b>vouch for her honesty. In the 1950's, my parents were young marrieds</b>
<br><b>with their first child{my brother}. They lived in East Cenral Kentucky.</b>
<br><b>They rented a house from a lady who once asked my mother if she
had</b>
<br><b>experienced any "trouble" while living there. Well, my mother and
father</b>
<br><b>did have "trouble". In the morning after my father went to work,
my</b>
<br><b>mother would go back to bed. This was an old house with no running</b>
<br><b>water, just an outside well. While in bed, my mother would hear
the</b>
<br><b>kitchen door{which was locked} open, then heavy footsteps proceeding
to</b>
<br><b>the water bucket, then the sound of the dipper touching the sides
of the</b>
<br><b>bucket, then the footsteps retreated from whence they came and the
door</b>
<br><b>shut. My mother never got up to investigate, though she heard this
many,</b>
<br><b>many times. She was too scared. Another time while she was outside,
she</b>
<br><b>heard what sounded like a shower of rocks hitting the opposite side
of</b>
<br><b>the tobacco barn. When she investigated, she found nothing unusual.
My</b>
<br><b>father's mother and little brothers came to visit one day {not knowing</b>
<br><b>that my parents weren't at home}, and saw a little blond haired
girl</b>
<br><b>standing by the house, she ran around the other side of the house
and my</b>
<br><b>uncle jumped out of the car, running after her, thinking she was
my</b>
<br><b>mother's little sister, Elaine. He yelled after her, she never answered,</b>
<br><b>and he never found her. Needless to say, it wasn't Elaine. I've
saved</b>
<br><b>the strangest stories for last. Once, while my parent's were in
bed,</b>
<br><b>they saw what my mother describes as "a green and orange ball",
very</b>
<br><b>large, float through the living room, into the bedroom, and over
to my</b>
<br><b>brother's crib, where it hovered for several seconds, then faded.</b>
<br><b>Another time, after my parents had settled down for the night, a
sound</b>
<br><b>like a vacuum cleaner, very loud, moved through the living room
into the</b>
<br><b>bedroom and hovered over the bed. My parents describe being "paralyzed"</b>
<br><b>during this experience. My mother said that it felt as if cold steel</b>
<br><b>bands were on her ankles. They then blacked out and didn't know
anything</b>
<br><b>more until the morning when they woke up. My fathers' teenage sister
was</b>
<br><b>staying with them that night, sleeping on the couch. In the morning,
my</b>
<br><b>mother asked her if she had heard anything the night before, and
she had</b>
<br><b>experienced the same thing as my parents. The noise, the paralysis,
the</b>
<br><b>blacking out. A very strange story, but I know it to be true.</b>

<p><b>hello my name is kelly&nbsp; , i dont know really where to begin
but i guess at</b>
<br><b>the beginning would be good. Ever since i was little i have experienced</b>
<br><b>seeing and hearing ghosts , as i got older it grew stronger. About&nbsp;
8 years</b>
<br><b>ago my boyfrienD (I&nbsp; am now married) was murdered,since the
moment he died he</b>
<br><b>was in my house, the night he died my front door started shakeing
really hard</b>
<br><b>but i knew it was him. F rom that day forward i would feel him touch
me , or</b>
<br><b>i would wake up in the middle of the night to someone moaning in
my ear</b>
<br><b>almost like a deaf person tries to speak but he could not get out
what he</b>
<br><b>wanted to tell me, so i started useing the weja board to communicate
with</b>
<br><b>him. It was really sad he just kept saying pray for him and that
he was</b>
<br><b>suffering other spirits would cut in sometimes bad ones and try
to pretend</b>
<br><b>they were him but i knew his personality it was just like he was
still</b>
<br><b>alive,when he was alive he would get into alot of fights and usually
he won</b>
<br><b>but he said on that side his punishment was that other spirits were
fighting</b>
<br><b>him and he was loosing,do you understand that? I went everyday to
my chapple</b>
<br><b>and prayed for him but my mom always told me its to late after you
die , but</b>
<br><b>i tried anyway.As time went on he seemed a little&nbsp; farther
away and it was</b>
<br><b>harder to contact him,i got pregnant with my 6 year old and one
day i woke up</b>
<br><b>to someone rubbing my face but could see no one, i knew it was him
saying</b>
<br><b>goodbye. It was quit awhile before i saw or heard from him again
untill one</b>
<br><b>week before my wedding i woke up to someone banging on my bedroom
door no one</b>
<br><b>ansered when i said hello, so i laid back down and in a few minuets
i looked</b>
<br><b>up to see richard walking across my bedroom but he did not even
look at me</b>
<br><b>,it was as if i wasnt even there. Thats the very last time&nbsp;
i have felt him</b>
<br><b>hear, but i still feel presences hear with lights flickering things
falling</b>
<br><b>or just knowing someone is there but i am not sure who they are
.Maybe you</b>
<br><b>could give me better advice on how to communicate with him or them,
i really</b>
<br><b>could tell you more stories but i have taken enough of you time.</b>

<br><b>OK it all started when the boy had newly moved into his new room

would</b>
<br><b>throw him athwart the room, beat him, and many times paralyzed him.</b>
<br><b>The demon hadnt always been AS vicious but once a chathlic(YES!see

<br><b>He then told his friend of the happenings.</b>
<br><b>The girl had listen to him and had declared to him the figure in

room and the christmas tree lights where on and the glare of light was
going through the hall way and was glaring to where you can see the poster
a little bit. My sister was talkig to her boyfriend and was looking on
the wall with the lights off and about an hour later she came running out
of my bedroom screaming she said megan your bedroom is really haunted and
i said why and she said go in there and stare at the poster and you tell
me if it is haunted so i went in there and looked at the poster and then
i seen a man in the kingpin poster dancing and tipin his hat and moving
around like a pshyco and i was freaked out. Then when i left and got my
mom and other sister to come and look they seen the same thing and i sent
myself in there and then came out and told my other sister (17) to go back
in there and watch and when she came out she told me what she wrote down

<br><b>Memories of the Ohio Canal</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Elizabeth_Snow@msn.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I have written here before about a house I was in once and
it all being paranormally... anyway just recently I had another run in
with something. First I have to tell you all the details so that this makes
sense. I live in central Ohio and about 100 years ago or so there was the
Ohio Canal. Most of it is just a really big ditch now, forgotten and decaying...
and in some places extreemly haunted. My friend Corey lives on the sight
of an old lock house (lock #9)on the old canal. You can still see were
the locks were, b/c of these huge stones right next to her driveway, and
right along the house is the old canal(now a big, long ditch.)Her parents
had actually bought the old lock house and decided on renovating it, but
b/c of cost they just tore it down and built a new house on top of it.
When they lived there they had several run ins with ghosts. A man in civil
war attire, a little girl screaming for her mother, and other odd things.
The house isn't exactly quiet, but the ghosts are no longer residents(they
changed the location of the doors). The house is not the only thing haunted
out there, the land itself seems to remember the old days still.Corey has
told me a lot about the land and canal.The ships would sometimes throw
the dead into the canal as they went by. People falling in and drowning.
A very old tree stands in the middle of a field next to the house,it's
called the hanging tree, no explanations needed. So many things for Corey
and I to investigate.Keep in mind we are two stupid girls looking for the
unknown. About two weeks ago Corey and I took out her 4 by 4 to ride around
the field and just look for stuff. We brought a tape recorder with us this
time to see if we could record anything inaudible to us. First we went
to lock 10 which is not to far away from her house. I turned on the tape
recorder and we were bullshitting asking the ghosts to let us know if they
were there or we were just crazy. Nothing, so we rode around for a little
while longer and went back to her house. I took out the tape recorder to
listen to our stupidity and I heard something with our vioces. Corey really
wasn't paying attention and talking about something. I listened to it agian..."Cor-(Hey
if there are any ghosts out there say something)Me-(No no!!!)Cor( Yes,
except make it hearable ..)Me-(hearable?*laugh*)Cor(audible?)" After Cor
invited the ghosts to say something you begin to here a *clang clang clang.*
We are out in the middle of no where w/ the engine off and you can here
a clang very softly. I immediatly freak after figuring out what it was.
Its the sound of a lock opening and shutting to level watter and let boats
through... a 100 years after the canal was forgoten! That is the first
real proof we have of paranormal activity around her house.</b>
<br><b>The day before we heard a wagon following us in the same area. And
when we got close to the spooky woods near it (we didn't have the 4 by
4 w/ us, just the dog) the dog got all quiet and then attacked me for no
reason. I don't like those woods, I find it extreemly hard to breath there
and sometimes I feel so depressed that I want to cry or just die...Well
thanxs for reading this:)</b>

<br><b>YOU A FEW THINGS THAT ARE VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THIS STORY.&nbsp;
MY</b>
<br><b>YOUNGEST BROTHER IS 10.&nbsp; WE'LL CALL HIM STEPHEN.&nbsp; EVER
SINCE HE WAS ABOUT 1</b>
<br><b>&amp; 1/2, EVERY ONE WHO HAS MET HIM SAYS HE IS EITHER PURE EVIL
, OR POSSED BY</b>
<br><b>THE DEVIL HIMSELF.&nbsp; THE REASON FOR THIS IS BECAUSE WHENEVER
HE IS AROUND,</b>
<br><b>STRANGE, MYSTERIOUS THINGS OCCUR AND WHEN THEY DO THERE IS A FEELING
OF PURE</b>
<br><b>EVIL.&nbsp; THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE SAYS ANYWAY.&nbsp; MY&nbsp; IMMEDIATE
FAMILY HAS OFTEN</b>
<br><b>BEEN SUBJECTED TO "SUPERNATURAL" OCCURANCES, BUT NONE OF WHICH SEEM
DIRECTLY</b>
<br><b>CAUSED BY STEPHEN. I, PERSONALLY DO NOT SENSE ANYTHING EVIL ABOUT
MY</b>
<br><b>BROTHER.&nbsp; SUPERNATURAL, MAYBE, BUT EVIL, DEFINATLY NOT.&nbsp;
NOW, FOR THE STORY.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; WHEN I WAS ABOUT 8 YEARS OLD, MY FATHER WAS A MECHANIC AND
MY MOTHER</b>
<br><b>STAYED AT HOME.&nbsp; STEPHEN WAS 3 AT THE TIME.&nbsp; ON THIS PARTICULAR
DAY, MY</b>
<br><b>SIBLINGS AND I WERE OUT OF THE HOUSE, THOUGH I DON'T REMEMBER WHERE.&nbsp;
MY</b>
<br><b>MOTHER HAD DECIDED TO REST FOR A WHILE AND WENT TO HER ROOM TO READ.&nbsp;
AS SHE</b>
<br><b>LOOKED UP FROM HER MAGAZINE TO GAZE OUT THE WINDOW, SHE SAW THE
SHAPE OF AN</b>
<br><b>ALEIN HAED IN HER CURTAIN. YOU KNOW HOW, IF YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING,
YOU SEE A</b>
<br><b>PARTICULAR SHAPE, BUT YOU TURN AWAY OR BLINK AND IT'S GONE?&nbsp;
WELL, SHE</b>
<br><b>FIGURED THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.&nbsp; BUT AFTER LOOKING BACK IT WAS
STILL THERE.</b>
<br><b>THIS DIDN'T BOTHER HER, SHE JUST WENT BACK TO READING.&nbsp; A FEW
MINUTES LATER,</b>
<br><b>SHE HEARD A SOUND AND LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOW.&nbsp; THE ALEIN HEAD
WAS STILL</b>
<br><b>THERE.&nbsp; ALL OF A SUDDEN IT GOT REAL DARK OUTSIDE AND SHE FELT
AN EERIE</b>
<br><b>PRESENCE.&nbsp; THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, SHE WAS SLUNG BACK IN THE
BED WITH A FORCE</b>
<br><b>HARD ENOUGH TO MAKE HER HEAD SLAM INTO THE HEADBOARD. SHE SAT UP
AND LOOKED</b>
<br><b>AROUND. IT WAS BRIGHT AND CLEAR OUTSIDE AND THE ALIEN WAS GONE.&nbsp;
SHE WAS</b>
<br><b>GOING TO GET UP TO&nbsp; CHECK AND SEE IF HER HEAD WAS BLEEDING.&nbsp;
SHE HEARD A CAR</b>
<br><b>PULL INTO THE DRIVEWAY. SHE LOOKED AT THE CLOCK.&nbsp; IT WAS 6:30
IN THE</b>
<br><b>EVENING.&nbsp; WHEN SHE HAD LAID DOWN, IT WAS ABOUT 12 NOON.&nbsp;
SHE LATER TOLD HER</b>
<br><b>HUSBAND ABOUT THE ODD OCCURENCE AND HE REPLIED THAT SHE HAD OBVIOUSLY
FELL</b>
<br><b>ASLEEP AND THAT'S WHERE THE DAY HAD GONE.&nbsp; WHEN SHE ASKED ABOUT
IT BECOMING</b>
<br><b>DARK, HE REPLIED THAT THE DAY HAD BEEN CLEAR THROUGHOUT.&nbsp; THIS
PUZZLED MY</b>
<br><b>MOM BUT SHE THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT FOR A FEW WEEKS.&nbsp; THEN MY
GRANDMOTHER, WHO</b>
<br><b>LIVED IN ILLINOIS AT THE TIME, CALLED AND SAID SHE HAD HAD A DREAM
ABOUT</b>
<br><b>STEPHEN A FEW WEEKS BEFORE AND SUDDENLY REMEMBERED. APON ASKING
IF HE WAS</b>
<br><b>ALRIGHT, MY MOTHER TOLD HER OF THE ODD OCCURENCE.&nbsp; MY GRANDMOTHER,
WHO IS A</b>
<br><b>DEVOUT CATHOLIC, SAID THAT SHE WAS SURE SHE HAD AN EXPLINATION.&nbsp;
SHE SAID</b>
<br><b>THAT THE "ALIEN" OUTSIDE MY MOTHER WAS REALLY AN ANGEL.&nbsp; (SHE
SAID ANGELS</b>
<br><b>CAN TAKE ANY FORM, AND THIS ONE TOOK THE SHAPE OF AN ALIEN IN THE
CURTAIN</b>
<br><b>BECAUSE MY MOTHER WOULD NOT BE ALARMED BY IT).&nbsp; SHE SAID THAT
SATAN WAS</b>
<br><b>TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL OF STEPHEN.&nbsp; BUT HE HAD TO KILL MY MOTHER
FIRST,</b>
<br><b>BECAUSE SHE WAS HIS PROTECTOR APPOINTED TO HIM BY GOD.&nbsp; SHE
ALSO EXPLAINED</b>
<br><b>THAT THE BLAST WAS A BATTLE BETWEEN THA ANGEL(WHO WAS SENT TO PROTECT
MY</b>
<br><b>MOTHER) AND SATAN.&nbsp; SHE SAID THAT MY MOTHER WAS PROBABLY UNCONSCIENCE
DURING</b>
<br><b>THE BATTLE, AND THAT'S WHY, WHEN SHE LOOKED AT THE CLOCK, THE DAY
HAD</b>
<br><b>PASSED.&nbsp; I NEVER HEARD ABOUT THE INCIDENT UNTILL LAST YEAR
WHEN MY MOTHER</b>
<br><b>TOLD A FRIEND.&nbsp; MY MOTHER DOES NOT BELIEVE ANY OF IT.&nbsp;

<br><b>More Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gerty2@citnet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I just love this sight and love to read the stories that are posted.&nbsp;
I never believed in "ghost" until things started happening in our house.&nbsp;
They have calmed down quite a bit but thought I would share a few more
stories with you, the most recent one happening last month.</b>
<br><b>The first happening was years ago,&nbsp; my daughter was on the
couch in the family room and my other daughter was in the chair and me
on the recliner.&nbsp; My youngest daughter (about 8?)&nbsp; all the sudden
ask us if we hear the pretty music</b>
<br><b>playing?&nbsp; My other daughter and I both say what music?&nbsp;
She says....the pretty organ music, can't you hear it?&nbsp; We again both
say NO.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she starts telling us that the couch is moving,
we both tell her it isn't and she starts crying saying the couch is shaking
and the music is getting louder,&nbsp; then it stopped.&nbsp; She was so
freaked out.......she is 17 now and still remembers that day.</b>
<br><b>Another incident was the same year and again my youngest daughter
was in the kitchen eating her cereal,&nbsp; I was in the bathroom drying
my hair for work and my other daughter was upstairs getting ready for school.&nbsp;
All the sudden Nikk comes running to me in the bathroom crying saying something
just hit her in the back of the head really hard.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had no
explanation of it since neither of us was around but she swears it happened
to this day.</b>
<br><b>Ok, the most recent incident just happend to me last month.&nbsp;
As I have said, things have started slowing down a bit over the last few
years but every once in a while we still hear the footsteps upstairs walking
around and I have seen shadows go past me.&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 25, 2001
I had off of work for vacation day.&nbsp; My daughter had left for school
and my husband had left for work.&nbsp;&nbsp; About 8:30 am, I was laying
their trying to go back to sleep and I all the sudden felt someone with
their hand around my neck, not real hard like trying to choke me but like
as a gag, so I thought my husband had stopped back home and was playing
a trick and I opened my eyes to say "Very funny" but nobody was in the
room or even in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; I immediately got up and get dressed
for the day.&nbsp; It was really scary.</b>
<br><b>I think my dog also sees things.&nbsp; He will sit in the room and
you can watch him moving his head like he is following something and sometimes
growls at it.&nbsp;&nbsp; From what I hear, the old lady who owned this
house before us had died here so maybe it is just her wondering around.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The articles that disappear and reapppear are always female items belonging
to me or my daughters.....barrettes, necklace (which is still missing),
brush, wallet etc........just mischevious I guess.</b><b></b>

<br><b>More of the Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bruce.hinch@verizon.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>At ten, I encounter my first spirit. I was speaking to my uncle</b>
<br><b>frank that I later learned was dead. As a child I felt different</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;because of my ability to see things ahead of time. I was shunned</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;and told to keep quite and sharing my ability only with my
sister.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I began keeping a journal. During back surgery, I experience
an</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;OBIE-out of body experience. I floated about my body and wondered</b>
<br><b>why the nurse could not see it. While sitting with my husband, I</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;floated but manage to pick up my cat. A voice called out to
me</b>
<br><b>saying it was not time yet.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;In 1994 I began sensing an unusual presence in the house.
It</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;happened in the den. Dave-my husband was talking to me, I
looked</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; outside and the sky was brown and dust was flying. People
were</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;crying. Dave did not see anything. A few nights after this,
our</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;bed began to shake violently. We both awoke in wonder and</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; amazement. Soon after, doors began opening and closing, footsteps</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;in the hallway. When Dave died I experienced a beautiful display
of</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;lights dancing above his head.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I moved into a smaller house after his death. Since Ive been
here,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I have had other family members experience phenomena such
as</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; footsteps, banging closet doors, strange odors. The attack
on me</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;where lighting went through my body prompted me to seek some
help.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Saying a prayer usually helps diminish their presence for
the time,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;but they come back.</b><b></b>

<br><b>2 Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: candy0987@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have two stories to tell, one with my own experience the other
my friends.&nbsp; I may be only 14 but I know what I have seen and heard
and I know its real.&nbsp; I'll start with my friend's story she was home
alone watching tv in an arm chair.&nbsp; All of a sudden an extreme coldness
came over her.&nbsp; She said she tried to get up to check the thermometer
and to turn up the heat but she couldn't seem to move.&nbsp; She also tried
to scream but her mouth wouldn't open and she couldn't seem to make even
a noise.&nbsp; The tv also turned off on its own for no reason.&nbsp; Thats
when she heard the window above her front door break and she heard the
front door open.&nbsp; After about a minute she heard a man scream and
then running feet and then the coldness was gone and she could move and
speak again.&nbsp; She quickly went to call 911 and her parents.&nbsp;
Later on they found out that a robber had broke in and he had also turned
himself in.&nbsp; The police say the man was hysterical mumbling that the
light would kill him and other stuff like that.&nbsp; He was later put
in mental institute and still is in it.&nbsp; They also found out that
her grandfather had died an hour earlier of the break in.&nbsp; My friend
called me the next morning telling me the whole story she was crying and
scared to death.&nbsp; Her family think that the ghost was her grandfather
trying to protect her from the robber.&nbsp; You see everyone knows my
friend is beyond brave and that if she wouldn't have been held down she
would have wanted to see what had happen and would probably have been killed
by the robber.&nbsp; Ever since then nothing really has really happen at
her home except she can sometimes smell smoke from a pipe and neither of
her parents smoke but her grandfather did.</b>
<br><b>Now to my story I never really thought I would ever see a ghost,
well that was until my family moved into this apartment in Austin, Texas.&nbsp;
Nothing had happened the first month we moved in but soon after that, stuff
began to happen.&nbsp; It all started one day, I went into my parent's
bedroom to watch a movie because the VCR in my room was broken.&nbsp; While
I was in the room my dog began to look in the corner and all of a sudden
she pricked her ears up and then she began to shake violently and just
continued to stare.&nbsp; After 5 minutes of staring in the corner she
all of a sudden whined and ran over to me and hid her head behind my neck.&nbsp;
I was trying to move her away from my neck but she would just go back.&nbsp;
Over the next 6 months this happened over and over anytime I would go into
my parent's bedroom with my dog.&nbsp; By this time I started to believe
that there was something in my apartment.&nbsp; One day my dog was whining
so bad behind my neck that I got so pissed of I started to scream at whatever
it was.&nbsp; I called it names and to top it off I said your not wanted
here.&nbsp; Well I think I might have pissed it of because that night I
could not sleep at all anytime I would doze off and then something would
wake me up.&nbsp; My parents have this huge old antique dresser that has
been passed down in our family.&nbsp; That night at exactly midnight I
heard the dresser slowly open and slam furiously closed in fact it slammed
so hard that it shook the whole wall.&nbsp; After I heard that I prayed
to God and finally went to sleep.&nbsp; The next morning my parents woke
me up.&nbsp; They asked me why my dad's belt was laying by me.&nbsp; I
looked at them confused because I didn't remember seeing that on my bed
when I went to sleep.&nbsp; My dad told me of course not because he had
put the belt in the dresser that night and when he woke up this morning
to put it on it was gone.&nbsp; When I got up my parents noticed red marks
on my legs that looked like they were belt marks.&nbsp; That was the biggest
thing that happened and thats when I told my parents everything and they
actually believed me.&nbsp; Although neither of them have actually experienced
anything they believed me.&nbsp; I actually asked the ghost to forgive
me for cursing at it and I told it that it was welcome here and I was sorry.&nbsp;
I still live in the apartment but my parents want to move quickly and are
looking for a house now.&nbsp; There are still things that happen. 24/7
I feel uncomfortable like someone is watching me.&nbsp; Quite a few times
out of the corner of my eye I swear I've seen something move.&nbsp; Whenever
I'm angry it also gets really cold but my parents don't feel the coldness.&nbsp;
Oh yeah 3 times this has happened where we leave our keys out on the counter.&nbsp;
2 hours later we'll hear a knock on the door and&nbsp; it'll be our neighbors
saying we left our keys in the door even though we swear we put it on the
counter.&nbsp; My parents always ask me if I'm scared no I'm not scared
I've studied up on ghosts and not all of them are bad.&nbsp; The only thing
I'm scared of is I'll piss it off again.&nbsp; I haven't studied up on
the history of the apartment I should though.&nbsp; I think this ghost
is a mom who thinks I'm her daughter because it all happens to me and she
even spanked me!!!!!</b>

<br><b>Blessing</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: reggie</b><b></b>
<p><b>My experience was a blessing.My daughter died 2/8/79</b>
<br><b>she told me she was going to die young,she was 20</b>
<br><b>when she passed.Still don't know the truth if it was self</b>
<br><b>inflicted or help from the boyfriend?At her funeral I asked</b>
<br><b>the big word"WHY" her right arm broke out in goose bumps</b>
<br><b>and I immediately knew her spirit was present.Her sister was</b>
<br><b>freaked by this.After the services a cloud left the casket going</b>
<br><b>from her head to bottom of casket &amp; upwards from there.I seen</b>
<br><b>this &amp; another sister also seen it besides another friend that
talked</b>
<br><b>to me a couple of months later about what he had seen.My daughter</b>
<br><b>asked me mom what was that cloud &amp; I told her it was her sister's
spirit</b>
<br><b>leaving.But she didn't leave!!She hung around for 3 months to help
me</b>
<br><b>to get help for the sister that had seen her spirit.I thought I
was losing</b>
<br><b>my mind at the time.took several events to get the message across.Her</b>
<br><b>sister had experienced&nbsp; an overdose.I knew something was different
but was unable to get my daughter help because she had to sign herself
into a hospital.</b>
<br><b>Now if I knew the truth of what happened I may have been able to
have had her commited.Her sister didn't rat on her about drugs.After a
few months Of</b>
<br><b>confusion with the living daughter I finally got the message to
get her out of the school she was attending.She was leaving school and
going to the cemetary 1 block away &amp; clawing at her sister's grave.She
blamed herself for her sister's death.With help she was put into long term
theraphy because she had become sucicidal.When her sister got the help
she needed my daughter went to the</b>
<br><b>other side.If she hadn't stayed behind to warn me her sister most
likely would</b>
<br><b>have suffered from the same fate.I feel so blessed by this experience
but it is to long to go into detail with all the events that happened between
my daughter &amp;</b>
<br><b>how she communicated things to me.I now know that there is life
after death.</b>

<p><b>Still Haunted</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JackieFan02@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>The house I grew up in, in Brunswick, Ohio, was and still is haunted.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>first experience with the ghosts occured when I was a teenager.&nbsp;
I had 2</b>
<br><b>large Elvis posters on my bedroom wall.&nbsp; On the wall directly
opposite, I had</b>
<br><b>a stereo with a fold down dust cover.&nbsp; The overhead light was
on.&nbsp; While</b>
<br><b>looking for something below the stereo, I looked at the dust cover.&nbsp;
I saw</b>
<br><b>the reflection of my posters.&nbsp; Within the posters, as if in
the paper itself,</b>
<br><b>were several faces, very clear and detailed.&nbsp; I looked at the
posters</b>
<br><b>directly, and saw nothing.&nbsp; But looking at the reflection,
there they were.</b>
<br><b>I called a few people in to look at them.&nbsp; One of the people
touched the</b>
<br><b>posters, saying that he didn't see anything.&nbsp; He didn't look
at the</b>
<br><b>reflection.&nbsp; After he touched them, all the faces disappeared.&nbsp;
The next day,</b>
<br><b>there were 6 new faces in the reflection.&nbsp; The one that stands
out was a man</b>
<br><b>holding a staff in his hand.&nbsp; His mouth was wide open, as if
screaming.</b>
<br><b>Another incident I had was in that same bedroom, same stereo.&nbsp;
My sister in</b>
<br><b>law and I were in the kitchen, talking.&nbsp; We were in the house,
alone.&nbsp; After</b>
<br><b>several hours, we were startled to hear an album on my stereo begin
to play.</b>
<br><b>It was clearly loud enough to hear in the kitchen, yet it was in
the middle</b>
<br><b>of the album.&nbsp; If it had been playing all along, we would have
heard it.</b>
<br><b>My sister claims to have been scratched on the leg by something
that was</b>
<br><b>pulling on her blanket, in that same bedroom.</b>
<br><b>My elderly mother lives alone in that house now, and she's also
had a few</b>
<br><b>encounters.&nbsp; She has a paper shredder in her kitchen, about
two feet away</b>
<br><b>from where she sits. She keeps it on auto.&nbsp; One night, she
was sitting there,</b>
<br><b>watching TV, and the shredder came on all by itself.&nbsp; It had
been hours since</b>
<br><b>she'd used it.&nbsp; She has also found the shower in the basement
running.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>never uses that shower, yet the water was running forcefully enough
for her</b>
<br><b>to hear it upstairs.</b>
<br><b>When I was about 10,&nbsp; I stayed overnight at my brother in laws
house.</b>
<br><b>Getting up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, I looked
into the</b>
<br><b>living room.&nbsp; There was a rocking chair, rocking back and forth.&nbsp;
There</b>
<br><b>appeared to be a white mist occupying the chair.</b>
<br><b>And finally, to the house I now live in.&nbsp; I often feel a brief,
cold draft on</b>
<br><b>my arm, as if someone were touching me.&nbsp; I have baseboard heat,
no furnace,</b>
<br><b>and my bedroom window, as well as the door, are usually closed.&nbsp;
So there are</b>
<br><b>no drafts from anywhere.&nbsp; I had one experience where I went
to close my</b>
<br><b>bedroom door, and it felt like I hit something with the door.&nbsp;
Thinking it</b>
<br><b>was my cat, I went to investigate.&nbsp; The cat was on the couch,
sleeping.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>frequently hear what sounds like an aluminum ashtray being knocked
over.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>have opened my daughters' bedroom door while she was in school,
and a guitar</b>
<br><b>that was leaning against her desk, strummed, as if someone had run
their</b>
<br><b>hands across the strings.</b>
<br><b>Sorry to make this so long.&nbsp; I hope you, and others, find it
as interesting</b>
<br><b>as I do.</b>

<p><b>--My Father</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Sqawangel1@cs.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Actually, this could be a couple of stories.&nbsp; No, I am not
a professional</b>
<br><b>writer.&nbsp; I'm sure you can tell.&nbsp; I just write well.&nbsp;
At least, I think so.</b>
<br><b>My father was a very troubled man, he started seeing a therapist
when he was</b>
<br><b>in the Army at age 23.&nbsp; He and my mother had the house built
that I grew up</b>
<br><b>in when my mother was pregnant with me.&nbsp; They did a lot of
work on it</b>
<br><b>themselves as it was being built.&nbsp; My dad was somewhat of an
amateur</b>
<br><b>carpenter and did a lot of work in the basement and garage.&nbsp;
He also built a</b>
<br><b>large barn in the back yard and a wood bin.&nbsp; We called the
barn the "mini</b>
<br><b>barn."&nbsp; It was anything but mini.</b>
<br><b>I am the last of 4 children.&nbsp; My childhood was filled with
police and</b>
<br><b>ambulances at my house at least once or twice a month.&nbsp; Sometimes
more.</b>
<br><b>Finally, my mother could no longer take the beatings that my father
produced</b>
<br><b>when he would come home drunk.&nbsp; He was a brilliant lawyer and
I think that</b>
<br><b>added to his what can only be described as soul wrenching sadness.&nbsp;
All I</b>
<br><b>know about his childhood was that his mother, who was a widow, would
lock him</b>
<br><b>and his older brother in the closet when she would have a "gentleman
caller"</b>
<br><b>over.&nbsp; Who knows what else she did to those poor boys.&nbsp;
He never laid a hand</b>
<br><b>on us children.&nbsp; In fact, he would quite often bring my sister
(who was 4</b>
<br><b>years older than I) presents.&nbsp; We only had to listen to our
mothers beatings.</b>
<br><b>When I was 9, my mother told me in our car parked in the driveway
that she</b>
<br><b>was getting a divorce from my father.&nbsp; Of course it broke my
heart, but even</b>
<br><b>at that age I understood why, having been witness to her many cuts,
bruises</b>
<br><b>and broken nose's.&nbsp; My fathers firm fired him, (a prestigious
oil company).</b>
<br><b>They could not have a divorced executive in the late 60's.&nbsp;
In fact the</b>
<br><b>offered my mother an allowance, her own car, and a new house to
stay with</b>
<br><b>him.&nbsp; Of course, not being a material woman, she declined.&nbsp;
He could not find</b>
<br><b>work in the state in which we lived and moved down to Florida for
a much</b>
<br><b>lower paying and less prestigious position.&nbsp; He was no happier
there than</b>
<br><b>here.&nbsp; And in the end he took his life with a bullet to the
head.&nbsp; But,</b>
<br><b>unfortunately that did not end his sadness.</b>
<br><b>I was 13 when he took his life, and knowing that he was mentally
ill did not</b>
<br><b>help the loss I felt for the man I loved but did not really know
and was</b>
<br><b>deathly afraid of.</b>
<br><b>This was about the time when there was a local show that ran horror
movies at</b>
<br><b>midnight.&nbsp; Two back to back.&nbsp; And after that, there was
wrestling before it</b>
<br><b>became the phenomena that it is today.&nbsp; Wrestling came on at
4:00 a.m.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>kids would stay up, watch the horror flicks and then wrestling.&nbsp;
Of course</b>
<br><b>our mother was long in bed by then.&nbsp; Our main floor was in
the shape of a</b>
<br><b>horseshoe.&nbsp; Ending on both ends at the master bedroom where,
of course, our</b>
<br><b>mother slept.&nbsp; One night while watching the horror movie, our
mother began to</b>
<br><b>scream like we had never heard her scream before.&nbsp; We all jumped
up and ran</b>
<br><b>to her closest door.&nbsp; It was locked, which was natural.&nbsp;
It was an old lock</b>
<br><b>that could be picked with a potato knife.&nbsp; A long straight
piece of metal.</b>
<br><b>My sister ran to the kitchen to get one and "popped" the lock with
our mother</b>
<br><b>still screaming all the while.&nbsp; When we got into her room she
was sitting</b>
<br><b>straight up in bed still screaming with the lights out.&nbsp; When
she calmed</b>
<br><b>enough to tell us what was wrong she simply said, "Their was the
shadow of a</b>
<br><b>man at the foot of the bed.&nbsp; It was your father."&nbsp; Morning
light was coming</b>
<br><b>in the window before we left her alone in her room.</b>
<br><b>It was another Friday night watching horror movies with all four
of us kids</b>
<br><b>in the living room and Mom in her room asleep.&nbsp; Our basement
floor was plain</b>
<br><b>concrete.&nbsp; We all knew what moving furniture on concrete sounded
like.&nbsp; All</b>
<br><b>of the sudden we heard, piece by piece, our furniture being moved
in the</b>
<br><b>basement.&nbsp; All of us looking wide eyed in horror at each other,
we did not</b>
<br><b>say a word and waited for our mother to scream.&nbsp; She never
did.&nbsp; The sounds</b>
<br><b>stopped.&nbsp; We had a conversation and decided to all go down
together.&nbsp; And so</b>
<br><b>we did, all holding hands, expecting to see something totally strange.</b>
<br><b>Halfway down the steps we did see something strange.&nbsp; Nothing
had been moved.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Everything was in it's place.&nbsp; That happened to us on
two different</b>
<br><b>occasions.&nbsp; After that we didn't watch the horror movies quite
so much.</b>
<br><b>I was the youngest by 3 years to the closest, my sister was married
and the</b>
<br><b>boys were in Kentucky in college.&nbsp; My mother had remarried
(my stepfather now</b>
<br><b>of 25 years) and I was the only child at home.&nbsp; My mother hated
the house by</b>
<br><b>now because of all of the bad memories.&nbsp; But I still loved
the only home I</b>
<br><b>had ever known.&nbsp; It was only my mother, stepfather and me.&nbsp;
I was about 15 by</b>
<br><b>then.&nbsp; Nothing had happened for a long time.&nbsp; But on one
occasion I had left</b>
<br><b>a cheap gold bracelet on the kitchen counter.&nbsp; While I had
been talking on</b>
<br><b>the phone I moved it into a circle.&nbsp; Then not thinking I played
with it to</b>
<br><b>make it as perfect of a circle as I could, then went off and left
it.&nbsp; I did</b>
<br><b>not think anything about it until the next day when I saw it again.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>bracelet was in an absolutely "perfect circle" and the missing link
had been</b>
<br><b>replaced by a link of real gold.&nbsp; I asked both my mother and
stepfather if</b>
<br><b>either of them had fixed my bracelet and of course they both said
they didn't</b>
<br><b>even know it was there.</b>
<br><b>Another occasion, I remember saying "I wish I had a watch like that."&nbsp;
And lo</b>
<br><b>and behold, within a week there was a beautiful gold watch on the
kitchen</b>
<br><b>counter.&nbsp; I asked both my mother and stepfather again, if they
had bought me</b>
<br><b>a watch and left it on the counter.&nbsp; Both said no again.&nbsp;
They had no idea</b>
<br><b>where it came from.&nbsp; I just got rid of the watch a year or
so ago.&nbsp; I held</b>
<br><b>onto it many years after it stopped running.</b>
<br><b>I got married in the backyard of that house when I was 18.&nbsp;
Nothing had</b>
<br><b>happened since the watch.</b>
<br><b>Two years later my mother and stepfather (who I think of as my "Dad,"
he has</b>
<br><b>been great to all of us kids and our children) sold the house to
a couple in</b>
<br><b>their 60's.&nbsp; Within a year it was up for sale again.&nbsp;
They said it was</b>
<br><b>"haunted."&nbsp; Before they could sell it, the man died.&nbsp;
It has been sold twice</b>
<br><b>again since.</b>
<br><b>Another story about the house.&nbsp; My mother and father were great
antique</b>
<br><b>collectors and my mother had many artifacts from the older members
of her</b>
<br><b>family.&nbsp; In the bathroom in the main hall of the house, she
had mounted her</b>
<br><b>great-grandfathers straight-razors and the boxes that they came
in on a piece</b>
<br><b>of driftwood that we had collected from my fathers family resort
in</b>
<br><b>Wisconsin, on the wall that was behind the door in the open position.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>mother was a clean freak and always lifted the wall hangings, whatever
they</b>
<br><b>may be, up from the wall and dusted underneath so they would not
leave dust</b>
<br><b>marks when she rearranged. It was the children's chore to clean
our own</b>
<br><b>bathroom.&nbsp; Of course my mother being the clean freak she is,
she would double</b>
<br><b>check our efforts.&nbsp; While going through the beginning of the
divorce, my</b>
<br><b>mother lifted the piece of driftwood in "our" bathroom.&nbsp; When
she did at the</b>
<br><b>beginning of the divorce, eggshells fell from underneath.&nbsp;
She confronted us</b>
<br><b>all one by one, as was her standard of trouble shooting having four
children,</b>
<br><b>we all knew nothing of them.&nbsp; We talked about the shells amongst
ourselves</b>
<br><b>and knew for sure none of us four had done that.&nbsp; That was
just weird.&nbsp; As</b>
<br><b>time went on, the divorce got harder and harder for our mother,
as our father</b>
<br><b>begged and his company begged and bribed our mother to stay with
him.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>held her resolve.&nbsp; Mom continued to find eggshells falling
out from behind</b>
<br><b>the piece of driftwood.&nbsp; It got so us children would not go
into that</b>
<br><b>bathroom by ourselves.&nbsp; Being 2 boys and 2 girls we would go
in pairs.&nbsp; That</b>
<br><b>is one time that males did go to the bathroom in pairs too!&nbsp;
(HaHa.)&nbsp; If we</b>
<br><b>had to go alone we would use our mothers half bath.&nbsp; We did
not know this at</b>
<br><b>the time, but our Mother was going into the bathroom by herself
too and</b>
<br><b>saving the eggshells and putting them in a babyfood jar.&nbsp; After
about a year</b>
<br><b>and the divorce almost ended, the shells stopped appearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
When the</b>
<br><b>divorce was over, Mom got a better job and things were going better
for her</b>
<br><b>financially, the eggshells started disappearing from the babyfood
jar. None</b>
<br><b>of us kids knew anything about that either.&nbsp; We didn't even
know were she was</b>
<br><b>keeping the jar.&nbsp; When it was just about empty again, she brought
the jar</b>
<br><b>from it's hiding place and confronted us with the almost empty jar.&nbsp;
Again,</b>
<br><b>we four knew nothing about it.&nbsp; Believe me, had any one of
use done the task</b>
<br><b>another one would have known.&nbsp; At that time, we didn't hide
anything from</b>
<br><b>each other.&nbsp; We clang to each other for love and support.&nbsp;
Our mother finally</b>
<br><b>fessed up to us, she told us that eggs were her great-grandfathers
favorite</b>
<br><b>food.&nbsp; He ate them every morning for breakfast.&nbsp; She believed
that he was</b>
<br><b>showing his support for her through the most trying time in her
life.&nbsp; And as</b>
<br><b>things got easier for her, the shells disappeared until they were
gone.</b>
<br><b>After that, she made enough money to support our household and four
children</b>
<br><b>on her own.</b>
<br><b>After the original couple bought our house and the man died, the
house has</b>
<br><b>been sold three times since.</b>
<br><b>My oldest brother lived with a High Priestess in college.&nbsp;
I went and stayed</b>
<br><b>for two weeks with them when I was 14 years old, my brother and
the High</b>
<br><b>Priestess told me they had gotten in touch with my father and that
he wanted</b>
<br><b>my to have his Tarot Cards.&nbsp; By then, all my fathers things
where gone.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>best friend at the time was in Florida with her mother.&nbsp; As
a present, my</b>
<br><b>friend brought me back a deck of Miniature Rider-Waite Tarot Cards.&nbsp;
As</b>
<br><b>anyone who knows anything about those kinds of cards knows you cannot
buy</b>
<br><b>your own, they must be given to you by someone close to you.&nbsp;
We were both 14</b>
<br><b>at the time and neither of us knew what the cards stood for at the
time.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>do know now.&nbsp; My oldest brother lives in our original neighborhood
and is</b>
<br><b>about ready to sell his house.&nbsp; I live in a trailer close to
my old</b>
<br><b>neighborhood and my father has not followed any of us.</b>
<br><b>I would do just about anything to have the house that my father
built.</b>

<p><b>Power of Ghosts</b><b></b>

<p><b>My name is Mitch.&nbsp; Me and a couple friends live in a little
backwoods town</b>
<br><b>in Fla.&nbsp; We never really belived in the "powers" of ghosts.&nbsp;
We used to joke</b>
<br><b>and laugh about them.&nbsp; Like, for instence, there's a nice size
catfish pond</b>
<br><b>about a quarter mile from my house.&nbsp; We use to go out there
at night and sit</b>
<br><b>and hang out.&nbsp; Near this pond is a small clearing about 20ft
in diameter.</b>
<br><b>Later one night, we pulled a prank on my cousins and made them think
we had</b>
<br><b>made a deal with deamons, to get rich, and give them our cousins
souls.</b>
<br><b>They believed us and were scared to death.&nbsp; We harassed them
about it for</b>
<br><b>about 15 minutes, then just decided to go home.&nbsp; The three
"doomed" ones, my</b>
<br><b>little brother, and my 2 younger cousins, ran home way ahead of
us.&nbsp; Me and</b>
<br><b>Alex were walking slower than the rest of the group.&nbsp; We stopped
to take a</b>
<br><b>break.&nbsp; Alex climbed up on top of a broken down bull dozer.&nbsp;
I sat at the</b>
<br><b>trunk of a tree near by.&nbsp; After a few minutes, Alex jumped
from the tractor</b>
<br><b>screaming.&nbsp; He asked, "Did you hear that?"</b>
<br><b>"What?" I responded.&nbsp; "Tell me you saw it too..." He said.&nbsp;
Right then, this</b>
<br><b>chill came over us both.&nbsp; I don't mean goosebumps, i mean it's
87 degrees at</b>
<br><b>night and i am shivering to my bones chill.&nbsp; And a fog started
to roll up to</b>
<br><b>us out of nowhere.&nbsp; We ran like, well, like we had just seen
a ghost.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, it turns out, that while Alex was sitting on the
tractor, he heard</b>
<br><b>someone say, "That's pretty funny."&nbsp; When he looked around,

<br><b>person would and ran out of my house, and started running down the
street ,</b>
<br><b>while Gregg was in the car he looked to his side to see the person
in all</b>
<br><b>white looking in on him in the car, he screamed and jumped out of
the car and</b>
<br><b>it disappeared and he was like this is too freaky im leaving your
house he</b>
<br><b>started walkin and didnt realize that the figure appeared again
chasing after</b>
<br><b>him , i screamed to tell him but when he looked back it dissapeared.

<p><b>My Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: masha2@excite.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I would like to submit a story.&nbsp; My family and I have had a
number of</b>
<br><b>experiences with what we've concluded must be ghosts, in an apartment
we</b>
<br><b>used to live in on the south side of Chicago.</b>
<br><b>Our family have always been "believers" and none of our experiences
have</b>
<br><b>really been horribly unpleasant, but they were frightening at the
time.</b>
<br><b>I used to always see a "boy" walking through the hallway beyond
our living</b>
<br><b>room late at night.&nbsp; He'd usually pause a bit just beyond the
doorway (so</b>
<br><b>that I could only see part of his arm and leg) and then move on.
At first, I</b>
<br><b>assumed that it was my older brother trying to frighten me and I
used to beg</b>
<br><b>him to stop but he would just look at me, claim not to know what
I was</b>
<br><b>talking about and walk away.&nbsp; One night, after seeing the "boy"
walk through</b>
<br><b>the hall toward my parents' room, I jumped up and ran to my brother's
room</b>
<br><b>(in the direction from which the "boy" came).&nbsp; My goal was
to catch my</b>
<br><b>brother when he came back into his bedroom, but when I opened his
door, he</b>
<br><b>was in his bed.&nbsp; I thought this was weird because there was
no way he could</b>
<br><b>have gotten back to his room without passing me along the way.</b>
<br><b>All of the ghosts in our apartment were very human-like and usually
came</b>
<br><b>alone, but one evening several years later (after I had moved into
my</b>
<br><b>brother's room when my new little sister was born and got my room
for a few</b>
<br><b>months) I was having trouble sleeping and noticed that there was
a man</b>
<br><b>standing on the end of my bed.&nbsp; I don't remember being very
afraid, but do</b>
<br><b>remember thinking that this wasn't normal.&nbsp; I closed my eyes,
counted to 10</b>
<br><b>(assuming that it was just the fact that my eyes hadn't adjusted
to the</b>
<br><b>darkness in the room) then opened them again and he was still there,
but</b>
<br><b>bending over a bit so as to get a better look at me.&nbsp; He was
very hazy, but</b>
<br><b>I could feel the weight of him on the end of my bed, pressing my
mattress.</b>
<br><b>I closed my eyes again, opened them and he was still there leaning
even</b>
<br><b>closer.&nbsp; His head was no more than 3 feet away from mine, but
I wasn't able</b>
<br><b>to make out any features, he was more of a silohuette.</b>
<br><b>I closed my eyes again and decided that I had to be dreaming and
eventually</b>
<br><b>fell asleep.</b>
<br><b>The next morning at breakfast my brother was talking about a dream
he had</b>
<br><b>had the night before about a large group of people in our bedroom;
he noted</b>
<br><b>that several of them were congregated around his bed, watching him,
a few</b>
<br><b>stood near the closet and one "man" stood at the end of my bed,
leaning down</b>
<br><b>watching me.&nbsp; My mother (who had also lived in this apartment
when she was a</b>
<br><b>child, our family owned the building for years) was a bit taken
aback by my</b>
<br><b>brother's recount of his dream and noted that she used to have frequent</b>
<br><b>dreams about groups of people in the room with her (she slept in
the same</b>
<br><b>room as a child).&nbsp; The people would come in through the bedroom
door and go</b>
<br><b>into the closet, but before entering the closet, most would hang
around the</b>
<br><b>room for awhile looking at books or toys in the room or staring
at her while</b>
<br><b>she lay in her bed.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Series of Events</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: brenoliver@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a very strange thing for me to be doing. But I think that
I'm</b>
<br><b>supposed to because of the series</b>
<br><b>of events that have occured. Let me start by saying that my name
is Brenda</b>
<br><b>and although I have had</b>
<br><b>a lot of different experiences with angels and the Lord, I have
never had</b>
<br><b>any experiences with</b>
<br><b>"ghosts" until recently.</b>
<br><b>I began camping about a year ago with a college friend and her family
and</b>
<br><b>family friends. Typically</b>
<br><b>my boyfriend and I would take a tent and set it up away from the
campers.</b>
<br><b>Memorial Day weekend</b>
<br><b>was our first camping trip of the year. Another college friend and
her</b>
<br><b>boyfriend joined us and</b>
<br><b>informed my boyfriend and myself that we could bunk in their camper
(which</b>
<br><b>is brand new and has</b>
<br><b>never had a previous owner). There was no need for the tent although
we did</b>
<br><b>set it up, this time on</b>
<br><b>the other side of the camp ground.&nbsp; On our last night camping
we were all</b>
<br><b>pretty tired. We went to</b>
<br><b>sleep (in the camper) about midnight. This night had gotten particularly</b>
<br><b>chilly and the wind had</b>
<br><b>kicked up a bit. So, at some point in the middle of the night (I'm
not sure</b>
<br><b>what time), there was a</b>
<br><b>rapping noise on the camper. It sounded as if a window could've
been open or</b>
<br><b>a vent etc...This noise</b>
<br><b>woke me up out of my sleep and as I looked around to see if a window
needed</b>
<br><b>to be closed, there</b>
<br><b>were 3 people standing in front of the camper door (inside the camper).
I</b>
<br><b>wasn't really sure what I</b>
<br><b>was looking at so I kinda rubbed my eyes and focused a little bit
more. Sure</b>
<br><b>enough, there were 3</b>
<br><b>ghosts in that camper. A woman, man and child. Although I know that
they</b>
<br><b>were watching me, the</b>
<br><b>man had no face. I could see the woman and the child, but the child
was</b>
<br><b>playing with something and</b>
<br><b>he was looking down, studying what he was doing. The woman was my
main</b>
<br><b>focus. As she stood</b>
<br><b>there, she (telepathically) said "come with us." As she did this,
she turned</b>
<br><b>her head slightly and</b>
<br><b>cracked a smile at me that scared me to death!! This was NOT a good
feeling.</b>
<br><b>At this point I woke</b>
<br><b>up my boyfriend and told them there were people in the camper. He
woke up at</b>
<br><b>looked around and</b>
<br><b>said "there's nobody here, where are they?" And I told them where
they were,</b>
<br><b>as they were still</b>
<br><b>standing there. But the more my boyfriend talked with me the more
they</b>
<br><b>faded. And finally they were</b>
<br><b>gone. My boyfriend proceeded to get up and go outside and look around,
but</b>
<br><b>there was noone.</b>
<br><b>The clothes they were all wearing is clear. And when I think about
the</b>
<br><b>experience, I know that they</b>
<br><b>were pioneers from around 1920. I haven't done much research on
the area,</b>
<br><b>but I do know that</b>
<br><b>there are some old cabins approximately 1 mile away and that there
was a lot</b>
<br><b>of traveling through</b>
<br><b>that area. I would like to know who the family is and possibly find
out</b>
<br><b>about their deaths. I'm very</b>
<br><b>hesitant to do this because of the fear this woman instilled on
me. I have</b>
<br><b>not had an experience like</b>
<br><b>this before and have not had one since. I will return to the camp
site for</b>
<br><b>4th of July and would like to</b>
<br><b>know if there's any advice I could use. That night I could not go
back to</b>
<br><b>sleep. I was afraid they</b>
<br><b>would come back and I laid there thinking that if they did, I would
try to</b>
<br><b>talk with them. I don't know</b>
<br><b>if that's a good idea or not.</b>
<br><b>I had phoned my mother the day I got home and told her about the
incident. I</b>
<br><b>also asked if she</b>
<br><b>would send some old photos of my great grand parents and their son
who had</b>
<br><b>passed away at an</b>
<br><b>early age. A couple of days after the conversation with my mother,
she</b>
<br><b>received this website link on</b>
<br><b>ghosts. Coincidence?? ?????</b>

<p><b>Citrus Packing House</b><b></b>

<p><b>My great-grandparents are owners of a citrus packing house in south

<br><b>and the packing house is haunted.&nbsp; My dad and are both believers
of ghosts</b>
<br><b>and the super-natural. About 5 years ago (1996) in late October
my dad and I</b>
<br><b>went to the haunted packing house, it was late at night so it was
extremly</b>
<br><b>dark but we had flash lights.&nbsp; When we were about to open the
door (to get</b>
<br><b>inside) we heard strange noises such as yelling and screaming.&nbsp;
We pushed</b>
<br><b>open the door quickly and ran inside.&nbsp; We searched the entire
packing house</b>
<br><b>and found no else but ourselves, we were on the second floor, where
the boxes</b>
<br><b>are packed, when it suddenly got really cold and we heard the noises
again.</b>
<br><b>We turned a corner to go back down stair when in front of us we
both saw a</b>
<br><b>glare at the bottom of the stairs. We could just barely make out
a</b>
<br><b>description of a man, he was tall but had an extremly skinny body</b>
<br><b>deffinition. Then from the right a glare with the figure of a woman
appeared</b>
<br><b>and was walking toward the man, and we began to hear yelling again.
I was</b>
<br><b>scared stiff, i turned to my dad and asked him if he was seeing
the same as i</b>
<br><b>and when he shook his head yes to me i grabbed his head and said
"let's go!"</b>
<br><b>We ran down the stairs and went strait out the door. My dad and

<br><b>Grandmas Visit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jennifer@alliedworld.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>So here's my story.&nbsp; I am currently 25 years old and have lived
in</b>
<br><b>California almost all my life.&nbsp; I recently moved to New York
last</b>
<br><b>summer.&nbsp; My Dad's side of the family lives here in New York.&nbsp;
When I was</b>
<br><b>younger I would come spend the summer here and would visit my grandma.</b>
<br><b>By grandma was in poor health with heart problems.&nbsp; THe last
time I saw</b>
<br><b>her was the summer of 94'.&nbsp; She said to me then "this is probally
the</b>
<br><b>last time we will see each other."&nbsp; Well needless to say that
she died</b>
<br><b>in August of 96'.&nbsp; She was creamated and there was a memorial
service</b>
<br><b>held for her here on Long Island.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not attend.</b>
<br><b>So about 2 years ago I was in the mall and all the sudden I smelled
some</b>
<br><b>perfume.&nbsp; I knew the smell, it was the same perfume my grandma
used to</b>
<br><b>wear.&nbsp; Every so often I will just get a whif of that perfume.&nbsp;
It will</b>
<br><b>come out of nowhere.</b>
<br><b>Well like I said I moved to New York last summer and was staying
with my</b>
<br><b>aunt and uncle.&nbsp; Things weren't going well and I started looking
for an</b>
<br><b>apartment.&nbsp; I was having trouble getting one and was loosing
all</b>
<br><b>hope.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I then came across an apartment built on
the side of someones</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; I went to look at it with my aunt, and come to find
out the lady</b>
<br><b>used to work for my grandma back in 1975 or so.&nbsp; On the way
home my aunt</b>
<br><b>and I said that if I got this apartment we would have to go get
my</b>
<br><b>grandma's ashes and send them down to New Orleans to her sister.&nbsp;
(her</b>
<br><b>ashes are sitting in my uncles garage, and he said he is not ready
to</b>
<br><b>give them up)&nbsp; That was her wish to go to New Orleans.</b>
<br><b>Well I got the apartment.&nbsp; The owner of the apartment left
me some</b>
<br><b>furniture in the apartment.&nbsp; THe table was covered with a red
gingum</b>
<br><b>table cloth.&nbsp; My grandma was obsessed with red gingum.&nbsp;
It was all over</b>
<br><b>my room when I was a little girl.&nbsp; I thought that to be so
wierd.&nbsp; Well</b>
<br><b>since I have been there different things have happened.&nbsp; My
alarm clock</b>
<br><b>will change the time the alarm is set all by itself.&nbsp; This
happened a</b>
<br><b>few times.&nbsp; Then while watching tv, this schhhhhhhhhh sound
will come</b>
<br><b>from the tv.&nbsp; The picture remains normal.&nbsp; The channel
has changed by</b>
<br><b>itsef before.&nbsp; Then last night the strangest thing happened.</b>
<br><b>I was home, left for about 1/2 hour, came home, opened up the door
and</b>
<br><b>there was this stench in my apartment.&nbsp; It smelled like something
dead.</b>
<br><b>I have smelled a dead animal before so thats what I associated the
smell</b>
<br><b>with.&nbsp; I walked aroung lookinf for where the smell was coming
from.</b>
<br><b>Every time I moved around the smell would also move around.&nbsp;
I could not</b>
<br><b>find anything that was causing this smell.&nbsp; Then all the sudden
the</b>
<br><b>smell disappeared.........</b>
<br><b>I think my grandma is trying to contact me.&nbsp; Can you give me
some</b>
<br><b>insight to what these signs might mean ie: clock, smell etc.&nbsp;
I would</b>
<br><b>really appreciate any help you could offer me.&nbsp; It feels like
She is</b>
<br><b>trying to tell me something I just don't know exactly what it is.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Haunted Life</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MonrJssc@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello my name is Jessica I am now 20 years old,
I live in southeastern</b>
<br><b>Indiana and I seen and had some crazy and terrifying experiences
in my life.</b>
<br><b>It started in the second grade. i have a family history of people
who are</b>
<br><b>able to ghosts and my great grandma was psychic so my dad says.
Anyway in the</b>
<br><b>second grade I started dreaming things that end up coming true.
At first it</b>
<br><b>was little things like I would dream about a surprise test at school
and</b>
<br><b>three days later it hapeend and I knew every word that was teacher
was going</b>
<br><b>to say, the setting was the same, her movements what she was wearing
etc.</b>
<br><b>Then oneday i would be in the car with my Mom and she would tell
me something</b>
<br><b>and I would say I know you told me last week and she would say but
I just</b>
<br><b>found out about it today? I know when something is going to come
true or not,</b>
<br><b>it depends on how real it is. Like if its an off the wall dream
i know its</b>
<br><b>not going to happen but if its something that could actually take
place it</b>
<br><b>will happen a day, a week, months even years down the road but i
always</b>
<br><b>remeber it. years later I would dream of talking to people and then
ending up</b>
<br><b>months later having the same conversation with my best friend. I
just said</b>
<br><b>its deja voo. I dream about tornadoes, ghosts and houses that are
haunted</b>
<br><b>almost 90% of the time to this day. I finally mentioned something
to my Dad</b>
<br><b>who says he does the same thing and then my twin sister confided
in me that</b>
<br><b>it happened to her too. Thats when Dad told us the story of our
family and</b>
<br><b>how only certain people have this gift and the gift to see and hear
things .</b>
<br><b>At first we kinda laughed. Then when i was nine years old, we moved
two</b>
<br><b>blocks away into a much older house. It was built I think in the
1940's There</b>
<br><b>use to be an old farmhouse in the center of our block. Well the
house didn't</b>
<br><b>bother me but naturally as a little kid i was afraid of the basement.
It is a</b>
<br><b>one story house with a wide entrance way in the center of the house.
My dad</b>
<br><b>use to joke it looked like one of those old houses that had the
wide entrance</b>
<br><b>into the living room because they had funeral visitations in their
house.</b>
<br><b>Anyway my sister and I shared a room and the first night we stayed
we swore</b>
<br><b>we heard kids laughing and singing and whispering. Sometimes we
would feel</b>
<br><b>like we were being watched. especially in the living room and basement.</b>
<br><b>Nothing much happend the house had always been calm, sometimes you
would hear</b>
<br><b>something like people walking at night but that was about it. then
one night</b>
<br><b>my sister and I were 13 yrs old and my cousin Alyssa came from seattle
to</b>
<br><b>visit. We were watching Amityville, and all of a sudden we heard
a loud crash</b>
<br><b>and the sound of a door slamming against a wall. We were the only
ones there</b>
<br><b>and we jumped up and turned the corner to the kitchen and we froze.
All of</b>
<br><b>the kitchen cabinets were opened and there were can goods, cooking
stuff and</b>
<br><b>boxes everywhere on the floor and the basement door which was shut
when we</b>
<br><b>started the movie was wide open. we cleaned up and sat on the porch
until my</b>
<br><b>parents got home.&nbsp; We told my parents and Mom said jokingly
maybe it was the</b>
<br><b>movie that started it she didn't beleive us. Nothing else much happend
except</b>
<br><b>i would be in a room and hear my mom call me and I would say what
Mom and she</b>
<br><b>would say I didn't say anything? I still felt i was being watched
alot too.</b>
<br><b>One day im not sure what year or day exactly I was 15 and My sister
and some</b>
<br><b>friends rented witchboard. And things started happening again. I
would hear a</b>
<br><b>womans voice say my name, and out of the corner of my eye once while
standing</b>
<br><b>in the bathrrom i saw a man in the doorway of the living room. When
I was 16</b>
<br><b>my dad built us each a room in the basement. i had shared a room
with my</b>
<br><b>sister for 16yrs . I was no longer afraid of the basement at this
time and</b>
<br><b>nothing had gone on for about a year. One night i woke up because
it felt</b>
<br><b>like someone was playing with my hair but noone was there and then
another</b>
<br><b>night i was awaken because it felt like someone smacked me in the
head! Mom</b>
<br><b>would always tease us it was the ghosts Dad and my sister and I
were always</b>
<br><b>talking about. Then when i was 18 My Mom went down to the basement
to do</b>
<br><b>laundry our washer is the kind that stops working when you open
the lid. Well</b>
<br><b>she put some clothes in the washer closed it, turned it on and went
upstairs.</b>
<br><b>moments later she went back down and the washer was running&nbsp;
and the lid was</b>
<br><b>up!! That freaked her out!! Then she was talking to one fof our
neighbors one</b>
<br><b>day and they asked her if she had ever heard of the Ghost women
that walks</b>
<br><b>aorund the block from house to house. The farmhouse i mentioned
that use to</b>
<br><b>be in the center of the block is part of our backyard. People on
our block</b>
<br><b>claim that a ghost women walks around at night and enters different
houses on</b>
<br><b>and around our block and that some had seen her. I was 19 when i
moved out,</b>
<br><b>got married and had my first child. We live a few blocks away on
the other</b>
<br><b>side of town my house isn't haunted i don't think but i still hear
things.</b>
<br><b>People would probably think im crazy!!! I will be laying in bed
at night and</b>
<br><b>i will be half asleep and i will hear people talking! One night
fed up i said</b>
<br><b>to my husband did you hear that! He was like no? He knows about
everything</b>
<br><b>and he thinks I have ESP! One morning i was laying in bed and i
had my eyes</b>
<br><b>closed and I heard a female voice say Oh! Its great to be home!
I jumped up</b>
<br><b>my infant son was asleep so i went into the living room and noone
was there.</b>
<br><b>Nothing has really happend&nbsp; at my parents house in a few years
nothing anyone</b>
<br><b>has noticed but its alaways been that way. I still don't like to
go to that</b>
<br><b>house alone, even though noone has ever been hurt it freaks me out
still. I</b>
<br><b>have always been fascinated with ghosts even though its the one
thing that</b>
<br><b>terrifies me the most.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Hauntings....</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: KPCOUNTRYGIRL@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Well my story starts back in 1987.&nbsp; I was one of those people
who would</b>
<br><b>listen to ghost stories of other people and nod and think, boy are
you ever</b>
<br><b>nuts!!&nbsp; No way did I believe in ghosts!!&nbsp; haha.&nbsp;
Well, it didn't take long</b>
<br><b>for me to change my mind thats for sure.&nbsp; This story is 100
% true.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>husband doesn't believe me, but I know these things happened to
me and still</b>
<br><b>do to this day.&nbsp; Here I go.....I moved into my apartment in
1987.&nbsp; I was 21</b>
<br><b>years old with a baby girl.&nbsp; I was really excited about my
new place.&nbsp; I got</b>
<br><b>settled in really quick.&nbsp; I didn't have a bed so I had to sleep
on the couch.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I had a crib for my daughter so that wasn't a problem.&nbsp;
My first night there</b>
<br><b>things started to happen.&nbsp; I was just laying down for the night
in my</b>
<br><b>livingroom when all of the sudden I heard something whizz by me
and slam into</b>
<br><b>the wall.&nbsp; Then a crashing sound.&nbsp; I jumped up and hit
the lights.&nbsp; There was</b>
<br><b>my picture of Jesus I just hung up on the wall earlier on the floor.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>glass was smashed.&nbsp; I didn't think much of it other than it
fell.&nbsp; The nail</b>
<br><b>must of gave way.&nbsp; I shut off the lights and went to sleep.&nbsp;
Well the next</b>
<br><b>morning I woke.&nbsp; Everything was going normal.&nbsp; I started
to clean up the</b>
<br><b>picture.&nbsp; I noticed the nail was still intact in the wall and
not bent at</b>
<br><b>all.&nbsp; That made me study the picture closely.&nbsp; Do you
know how pictures have</b>
<br><b>that gold backing on it?&nbsp; Well there were 5 long black marks
on it.&nbsp; I took</b>
<br><b>my nails and ran it down the backing as well and it didn't leave
any black</b>
<br><b>mark, just indentions.&nbsp; I put my fingers up to the marks and
it was like</b>
<br><b>someone scratched the picture.&nbsp; Wow did I get spooked out then.&nbsp;
I through</b>
<br><b>the glass away and went about my daily duties.&nbsp; I didn't think
no more about</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; Well later that night more things started to happen.&nbsp;
I didn't have a TV</b>
<br><b>set so I listened to records and the radio.&nbsp; That nights I
was listening to</b>
<br><b>the record player.&nbsp; I sat there and watched the record arm
skip all the way</b>
<br><b>across the record and start all over again.&nbsp; I got scared really
bad then.</b>
<br><b>Next I had a bunch of glass bottles I collected against the wall
in the</b>
<br><b>livingroom, and I watched them tip over one by one onto the floor.&nbsp;
They were</b>
<br><b>on the floor already just standing up on the carpeting.&nbsp; I
just froze.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>mind was too busy trying to think of a rational explanation.&nbsp;
Needless to</b>
<br><b>say, I figured it was the wind or the house settleing.&nbsp; (No
windows were</b>
<br><b>open).&nbsp; But ofcourse at that time, I didn't believe in spirits.&nbsp;
Next alot of</b>
<br><b>different things would happen.&nbsp; I would come home throw my
keys on the table</b>
<br><b>run to the restroom and get ready to leave again and my keys would
always be</b>
<br><b>missing.&nbsp; I would hunt forever!!&nbsp; I would leave the kitchen
and come back and</b>
<br><b>there they would be right where I already looked 5 times!!&nbsp;
Plus things would</b>
<br><b>get tipped over into the bath tub, things would come up moved into
a position</b>
<br><b>I wouldn't put it.&nbsp; Knick knacks and those kind of things.&nbsp;
Finally I asked</b>
<br><b>my best friend Michelle to move in with me.&nbsp; I was getting
a little spooked.</b>
<br><b>She agreed.&nbsp; I never told her about the things happening.&nbsp;
I just wanted to</b>
<br><b>see if they would stop.&nbsp; I actually wondered if I was going
crazy?!&nbsp; Well I</b>
<br><b>got my answer quickly that first night Michelle moved in.&nbsp;
She woke me</b>
<br><b>screaming!!&nbsp; I ran into the living room where she was sleeping
and she was</b>
<br><b>scared to death.&nbsp; She said listen!!&nbsp; I did and I heard
it too.&nbsp; It was</b>
<br><b>moaning and groaning in the same wall that the picture fell off
of and the</b>
<br><b>bottles fell from.&nbsp; There was no neighbor on that side.&nbsp;
I was in a two story</b>
<br><b>house made into 4 separate apartments.&nbsp; I had the attic part.&nbsp;
We listened</b>
<br><b>for a few minutes curled into a blanket and then it all stopped.&nbsp;
Well the</b>
<br><b>next morning we woke to stains running down the wall.&nbsp; It looked
like someone</b>
<br><b>around 4 feet tall was holding a glass of tomato juice against the
wall and</b>
<br><b>walked holding it to the wall letting it spill down.&nbsp; I scrubbed
at it and it</b>
<br><b>wouldn't go away.&nbsp; It was very light though.&nbsp; Not fresh.&nbsp;
Almost like it</b>
<br><b>seeped through the paint.&nbsp; Well now I am really freaking.&nbsp;
I called the</b>
<br><b>landlord.&nbsp; What a mistake that was.&nbsp; He accused me of
doing it.&nbsp; I was so</b>
<br><b>mad!!&nbsp; I asked him if someone had been hurt or killed in this
room?&nbsp; He said</b>
<br><b>no and said I had to paint the wall all over again.&nbsp; I was
so angry with him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;He actually thought that I did that.&nbsp; Well more and more
things started</b>
<br><b>happening.&nbsp; My daughter even got to the point she wouldn't
walk into our</b>
<br><b>bedroom or sleep in her crib.&nbsp; It was getting crazy.&nbsp;
Then on another</b>
<br><b>occasion my girlfriend was in the livingroom and I woke to her screaming</b>
<br><b>again.&nbsp; There was those moaning and groaning sounds again.&nbsp;
We decided to get</b>
<br><b>out the bible.&nbsp; Of course that didn't make it stop.&nbsp; So
we left and went to</b>
<br><b>get her aunt who is a medium.&nbsp; She came to the house to feel
it out so to</b>
<br><b>say.&nbsp; She asked me if I was dateing anyone?&nbsp; I told her
a lie and said no.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>wanted to check her out too.&nbsp; I was very skeptical.&nbsp; She
said are you sure?</b>
<br><b>I said of course I am sure.&nbsp; She said well if I was seeing
a man, he was</b>
<br><b>dangerous to me and my daughter.&nbsp; She told me the spirit that
was with me</b>
<br><b>only wanted to protect me.&nbsp; Well that was that.&nbsp; She did
mention the spirit</b>
<br><b>was not evil just mischevious.&nbsp; Well I thought differently
ofcourse.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>also said the house that was abandoned next door to us, she wouldn't
step one</b>
<br><b>foot in it.&nbsp; That really scared me.&nbsp; Anyways, she left.&nbsp;
My girlfriend moved</b>
<br><b>out that day.&nbsp; I was alone again.&nbsp; Scared now.&nbsp; I
tried to talk to the</b>
<br><b>spirit, but felt stupid.&nbsp; My boyfriend called me and I told
him everything.</b>
<br><b>He said his mother already knew about it.&nbsp; I asked how did
she know and he</b>
<br><b>said she is a witch.&nbsp; That freaked me out.&nbsp; He told me
he would come over and</b>
<br><b>stay the night.&nbsp; I said great.&nbsp; Well while we were talking
with the lights</b>
<br><b>out.&nbsp; The only light was from the street lights, I swear I
saw his face</b>
<br><b>change.&nbsp; I know it sounds nuts, believe me I still remember
that face to this</b>
<br><b>day.&nbsp; It is like what I picture the devil to look like in human
form.&nbsp; Gotee'</b>
<br><b>black hair and eyes.&nbsp; I kept opening and shutting me eyes until
he finally</b>
<br><b>looked like Micheal again.&nbsp; I didn't know what to do then.&nbsp;
Well needless to</b>
<br><b>say the next day I split up with him.&nbsp; He robbed me and trashed
my whole</b>
<br><b>place but he was out of my life.&nbsp; I felt something terrible
coming from that</b>
<br><b>man.&nbsp; Not to mention when I was at his house doors would open
and shut.</b>
<br><b>Pounding on walls and windows.&nbsp; The gas stove would come on
and off.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>witnessed all of this!!&nbsp; Crazy stuff!!&nbsp; Well after all
of the commotion, my</b>
<br><b>grandmother came over to the house.&nbsp; I sat down with her and
she explained to</b>
<br><b>me, my mother killed herself.&nbsp; That did it.&nbsp; I just freaked
out.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>grandmother left, and I just started crying and cleaning the apartment.&nbsp;
When</b>
<br><b>all of the sudden I thought I saw movement out of the corner of
my eye.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>looked into the livingroom and nothing was there.&nbsp; Well I started
back to</b>
<br><b>doing the dishes and this time put my hair behind my ear and watched
out of</b>
<br><b>my peripial vision.&nbsp; I saw something!!&nbsp; It was so fast.&nbsp;
It was like a white</b>
<br><b>streak went through my livingroom!!&nbsp; I froze.&nbsp; All these
things happened on</b>
<br><b>that side of the apartment by that same wall!&nbsp; I don't know
why.&nbsp; Well that</b>
<br><b>did it for my nerves.&nbsp; I started to puke and it was violent.&nbsp;
It was also</b>
<br><b>black stuff.&nbsp; Nothing else, no food or nothing.&nbsp; Just
a black mass.&nbsp; I never</b>
<br><b>felt so sick!!&nbsp; I don't mean to be gross but it was just terrible.&nbsp;
I left</b>
<br><b>the apartment.&nbsp; My daughter was with family thank goodness.&nbsp;
I left the</b>
<br><b>apartment for a few hours.&nbsp; I felt better and went back home.&nbsp;
Well no sooner</b>
<br><b>than I hit the kitchen, I was running to the bathroom vomitting
again.&nbsp; I had</b>
<br><b>to stay there though.&nbsp; This was my home.&nbsp; I didn't have
anywhere else to</b>
<br><b>live.&nbsp; I jumped into the shower to clean up.&nbsp; I then got
out of the shower</b>
<br><b>with nothing but a towel on and went to my bed.(yes I finally got
one of</b>
<br><b>those).&nbsp; I layed down on it with the fan blowing on me.&nbsp;
It was summer time</b>
<br><b>and very hot.&nbsp; All of the sudden I felt something touch me
on my right foot</b>
<br><b>ice cold like a single finger and slide up my leg.&nbsp; I screamed
and moved up</b>
<br><b>the bed so fast!!&nbsp; It was like someone put an icecube on my
leg!!&nbsp; That was</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; No one was there of course and I packed up some of my
stuff and left.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>never went back to the place.&nbsp; I had friends of mine move me.&nbsp;
I wouldn't</b>
<br><b>even go into the home again.&nbsp; I moved in with Michelle.&nbsp;
Ha.&nbsp; She didn't have</b>
<br><b>any ghosts.&nbsp; I didn't have anything else happen for a few years.&nbsp;
But its</b>
<br><b>back.&nbsp; I have everything happen.&nbsp; Anything from my keys
getting lost for</b>
<br><b>weeks at a time and ending back into my purse, to my son acting
like he is</b>
<br><b>hiding from someone he is watching walk across the room and he is
only 2.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>just says SCARED!!&nbsp; Alot of other things happen too.&nbsp;
I hear some feet</b>
<br><b>running up the hall and back down it again, feeling like someone
is always</b>
<br><b>behind me.&nbsp; Always!!&nbsp; I hate that feeling.&nbsp; Everyone
scares me who walks up</b>
<br><b>on me.&nbsp; But I have rambled on enough.&nbsp; If you need to
know more, believe me I</b>
<br><b>can tell you a few other things too.&nbsp; Thanks for listening.&nbsp;
I wish I knew</b>
<br><b>who was following me all these years.&nbsp; It can't be my mother,
because this</b>
<br><b>was going on before she died.&nbsp; What do you think?&nbsp; I know
one thing now, I am</b>
<br><b>a believer.....</b><b></b>

<br><b>My House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: blue_flame311@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>About 6 and a half months ago I moved into a new house with my mom.
A few</b>
<br><b>months ago I was sleeping down stairs in her room. Her room is right
below</b>
<br><b>my room.</b>
<br><b>There are two rooms and a small hallway between mine and my brothers
rooms.</b>
<br><b>My room has always been the coldest of all the rooms up stairs,
no matter if</b>
<br><b>I left the door open to get heat into it. I was the only one in
the house at</b>
<br><b>the time. Well it was about 1 am and I was just laying there when
I heard</b>
<br><b>some footsteps upstairs. They were small and quiet, but they walked
from my</b>
<br><b>room to my brothers room, then back into mine. This happened two
times, one</b>
<br><b>after the other. I later went over to my friends house and we were
on the</b>
<br><b>ouija board and we were told that she is a little girl. My room
used to be</b>
<br><b>her room, and my brothers room was her play room (since it is much
smaller).</b>

<br><b>My Loyal Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Krissybk31@gateway.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My ghost, "Bob", has lived with my family at the last three houses
we've</b>
<br><b>lived in. When we first encountered him, he would move things around,
turn</b>
<br><b>off the furnace in the winter, and even shut off our refrigerator.
I'm</b>
<br><b>divorced with children, but sleep alone. When I would lay down in
my</b>
<br><b>queen-sized bed often at night, I would turn toward the wall. Soon
after I</b>
<br><b>would feel someone sitting down on the other side of the bed. I
would turn</b>
<br><b>around, fully expecting to see one of my kids or someone there-
but there was</b>
<br><b>no one. When we went to move from this house, I asked my ghost to
tell me who</b>
<br><b>he was. I explained that we were moving soon. The NEXT day I went
upstairs to</b>
<br><b>get the baby. On his changing table I had his name "Jamie" spelled
out in</b>
<br><b>stickers. The stickers were still laying there. To my shock, I looked
under</b>
<br><b>"Jamie" and saw the name "BoB" in stickers!!!!! No one else could
have done</b>
<br><b>this!!! We moved right around the corner to another house. Bob followed
us.</b>
<br><b>We would see something white and small out of the corners of our
eyes- me and</b>
<br><b>the kids. This is also when I took a picture of my son's 2nd birthday</b>
<br><b>(Jamie). In the picture was a white, filmy, foggy form of an old
man. We</b>
<br><b>moved again- to a house two doors from the last one. This time Bob
is getting</b>
<br><b>braver. He tugs on my nightgown when I'm trying to sleep. Once I
sat up and</b>
<br><b>asked him to stop- and he did!! We have two more pictures of him,
also. One</b>
<br><b>distinctly looks like a mask. It even shows up in the negative.
What's really</b>
<br><b>strange is that the night before that photo was taken, I watched
the movie</b>
<br><b>"Eyes Wide Shut", in which they wear masks. The mask in my picture
that was</b>
<br><b>foggy white looked just like the one in the movie! Bob has a sense
of humor,</b>
<br><b>and is harmless. Everyone now in the neighborhood knows about him.
I believe</b>
<br><b>he's just a lonely old man, and I think he'll likely follow us when
we decide</b>
<br><b>to move again. Bob is a part of our family.</b>

<p><b>My Many Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: soren@harenet.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi. I've been enjoying reading everybodys stories. As long as I can
remember I've always been interested in ghosts. I'm 28 married and the
mother of four childern. I have had losts of interesting things happen
to me. Every since I can remember. This may get a little long and I'm sorry
if it does. It all started when I was little and everyhouse I've lived
in something strange has always happend there. I am also a firm beliver
in ghosts. Anyway, the first house I remember living in when I was around
5 until I was 12 I would see all sorts of stuff&nbsp; there. Mostly in
my room. I remember never wanting to sleep without a light on. I refused
to go to bed without a night light or the hall light left on. Even then
I would see things out of the corner of my eyes. Like an animal of some
sort coming into my room. We had a dog but she was never allowed upstairs
and the stairs door was always closed. Our dog was brown this thing was
black and big, like a panther. We had a little dog. I would see things
out of the corners of my eyes all the time thinking it was the dog but
she would be somewhere else sleeping! I would also wake up in the middle
of the night to see things in my room, I remeber this very vividly. I was
startled awake one night looked to the side of me and there was a figure
standing on the edge of my bed. It was samll like a gnome or troll or something.
All I know it was ugly and scary and grining evilily at me. I shut my eyes
and turned over and it was on the other side of the bed. Ishut my eyes
for a long time and was laying flat on my back. When I finally got the
nerve to open my eyes it was on the ceiling! I was freaking by then. It
just finally faded away. My friends would also tell me when we would be
gone for vaction for a week my light in my room would be on! Ny nephew
saw things to and he was probably 7 and he still remembers it clearly and
it freaks him out when he talks about it. He was sleeping in my room when
he woke up from some reason and I had a paper sack in my room that I put
my barbies in. He said the bag started shaking and the barbies started
coming out of the bag. It freaked him out bad. Iheard nothing. I was a
really sound sleeper. Another time he woke up and seen a severed head at
the foot of the bed and it&nbsp;&nbsp; rolled off on to the floor. He was
7 at the time and remembers it like yesterday! Whatever was in that house
I didn't like</b>
<br><b>We moved to a house on the farm when I was about 12. This house
I didn't like at all. I hated being home alone. I would turn the TV on
loud or the radio so I wouldn't hear anything. Now we had a cocker spaniel
named Penny. We I was home alone the dog would often go in the kitchen
and start barking and growling and just throwing a fit. Which also made
me even more frightened. We didn't have a phone at the time either so I
couldn't call anybody just to talk to them. I would also hear footsteps
upstairs when I was the only on home. One night I had a friend spend the
so told me a freaky story the next morning. (also I sleep upstairs alone
and my mom and step-dad slept done stairs) She said she woke up during
the night and had to go to the bathroom. Of course the bathroom was downstairs.
She was ready to get up when a figure came into the room. She frooze. She
said she could tell it was a man. He was tall and didn't look to nice at
all. Now the only other man in our house was my step-dad who is only 5
foot 2 and round. She said he walked over to the window and stood there
for a while. Then he came towards the bed and went under the bed and started
hitting the mattress. She was totally freaked out by then. I don't how
long this went on because I was asleep the whole time. She said she tried
to wake me but I wouldn't wake up. I didn't believe her but she insisted
and her story didn't change. Well about two weeks later I was upstiars
trying to fall asleep when I heard what sound like someone breathing really
heavy in my room. I waited and heard it again. I flew downstairs and never
slept upstais again. Ever! I never saw this apparition but later my brother
told me a similar story.</b>
<br><b>Like I said every house I've lived in I have seen or heard unexplained
things. I've lived in alot of houses to. There's one more house I would
like to tell you about, and I,m sorry about this being so long. This house
my husband I lived in was a fairly small house. It was a very old house.
Well over a hundred years old. The landlord told us that when he bought
it it still didn't have a bathroom in it. The people he bought it from
were still using the outhouse. Can you beleive that! So he added the bathroom
to it and a back laundryroom. Anyways we would have some strange things
happen once and a while but not to often. You know like the water turning
on by it self. But we didn't think to much about it. I guess ou get used
to it after awhile when you've been around it your whole life. Well anyway
my husband worked the nights. He wouldn't usually ge home until 4 in the
morning so it was just me and the 4 kids at night. I don't know if anybody's
heard of sleep paralysis but I started having these episodes I would wake
up during the night and I could barely open my eyes and I couldn't move
it felt like something was holding me down one the bed. I could just barely
see a dark figure but I couldn't turn my head to look and I couldn't scream
it was very terrifying! It is like your being attacked and are powerless
to stop it. These would happen every so often. Then they started to get
more frequent. Sometimes twice a week sometimes more and more terrifying.
I was afraid to fall asleep. Well here's the strange part I never had these
episodes before and since we've moved from that house I haven't had them
since! I truely belive there was a evil force in that house that wanted
to hurt me. After we moved my daughter told me see had seen a black figure
standing in the hallway. I would also feel like I was being watched sometimes.
The house w live in now was quiet at first but things have now began to
happen. Seeing things out of the corner of your eyes. My husbandf also
sees it. Just last night we were laying in bed just started dozing and
I heard a giggle. I sat up and my husband heard it to. Now I know it wasn't
the kids because I know what my childrens giggles sound like. Then I finally
drifted off to sleep and my husband&nbsp; got up because it started storming
and it was getting pertty bad out and he turned on the scanner so he could
listen for any storms headed our way. He was sitting in the kitchen in
the dark and he got a very uneasy feeling, like he wasn't alone when he
seen a figure walk in front oft the window. It freaked him out but he got
up from the table and looked out the window and saw nothing. He had this
feeling almost all night. He got on the computer cause he couldn't sleep
and felt like someone was watching him and kept seeing movement out of
the corner of his eyes. He look, nothing there. So I don't know if they
follow us or are attracted to us. But every where we go we always endup
with a ghost. So these are just a few of my many stories. I'm sorry it
got so long but thank you for reading my experiences. I'm always glad to
share them with people.</b>

<br><b>Voice Talking to Me</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Rhoncarver@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi. My name is Rhonda.&nbsp; My father sent your web address to me
just a few days</b>
<br><b>ago.&nbsp; I am 29, married with two small children.&nbsp; I just
recently began to</b>
<br><b>tell my parents of some of the incidents that have happened periodically
in</b>
<br><b>my life.&nbsp; The most recent being in my current home.&nbsp; The
first that occurred</b>
<br><b>that I actually paid attention to was the first night I brought
my first baby</b>
<br><b>home from the hospital.&nbsp; I couldn't sleep being a new Mom,
so I went into the</b>
<br><b>living room laid down in the recliner with my one week old daughter.&nbsp;
I had</b>
<br><b>just started to doze off when I felt my baby being lifted off my
chest.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>first thought was that it was my husband. Then a terrible feeling
came over</b>
<br><b>me and I could not wake myself up.&nbsp; I had been holding onto
my child's ankles</b>
<br><b>as she was sleeping on my chest. I could feel myself grip her tighter
as I</b>
<br><b>tried to scream. I kept fighting to wake myself but couldn't.&nbsp;
So I just held</b>
<br><b>on tight and continued the fight and screaming in my head that "they"
were</b>
<br><b>not going to take my baby!&nbsp; After what seemed to be a very
long time, I felt</b>
<br><b>my baby being laid back onto my chest and I was able to wake. The
room was</b>
<br><b>cold and I had a feeling of evil being around.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time of the communication was when my daughter
was about 4 or 5</b>
<br><b>months old.&nbsp; I was sitting on my sofa nursing her and my 16
year old niece</b>
<br><b>was in the kitchen. We heard a whistling, it sounded just like my
husband.</b>
<br><b>My husband was out of the country on business.&nbsp; I handed the
baby to my niece</b>
<br><b>and took my dogs with me through the house thinking it was a burglar.&nbsp;
Once I</b>
<br><b>found nothing, I knew what it was.&nbsp; I stood in my kitchen and
very sternly</b>
<br><b>told "it" that this is my house and if he wanted to stay I didn't
want to see</b>
<br><b>or hear him again!&nbsp; I didn't hear anything for two years.&nbsp;
Then my husband</b>
<br><b>and I took two long trips one right after the other.&nbsp; On the
night that I</b>
<br><b>returned home, I was laying on my bed in my room.&nbsp; I heard
my husband's voice</b>
<br><b>say "hello."&nbsp; I have a very large house that is divided by
a door in the hall</b>
<br><b>which was closed at this time.&nbsp; My husband who is very soft
spoken was in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen at the other end of the house.&nbsp; I got up to see who
he was talking to</b>
<br><b>and found him in the refrigerator.&nbsp; When I realized that it
could not have</b>
<br><b>been him, I went back into my room and told "it" again.&nbsp; I
said, "I realize</b>
<br><b>that you missed me, but let me make this very clear to you, I don't
want to</b>
<br><b>hear you anymore or you will have to leave."&nbsp; I have not heard
"it" since.</b>
<br><b>The only thing that happens now is occasionally I find my hall closet
door</b>
<br><b>open.&nbsp; My children are 18 months and four years old. I will
usually find the</b>
<br><b>door open after being gone all day.&nbsp; This particular "thing"
does not give me</b>
<br><b>the evil feeling of the very first time though.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had many other experiences in my life,
too.&nbsp; When I read your</b>
<br><b>personal experience with the woman's voice and knew what you must
have felt.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Spirit Expierence</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: NICHOLE.STOCKMANN@cph.org</b><b></b>
<p><b>I worked in the famous Lemp Haunted Caverns in St. Louis, MO. The
caverns have been converted to a haunted house for October for the past
several years.&nbsp; In 1995 I worked there (oddly met my husband there.)
I had several experiences there but I'd like to share 2 particular experiences.
I worked a holograph of Lady Lavender and where my station was, when people
would go through, they would walk up a ramp and into the next station of
the haunted house. There was a wood plank placed over the cavern floor
as it is naturally uneven and easy to trip on in the dark.&nbsp; There
was a wedge of concrete poured in front of the wood plank so no one would
trip over the board. Well, as wear and tear occurred on the wedge the concrete
began to break up and people started to trip. So, I asked for them to repair
the concrete. After pouring the concrete everyone dispersed from my station
to find something to lay over the concrete so no one would step in wet
cement that night. As we all convened back in my station to lay the new
board there was a face print in the cement. I was only about 20 feet from
my station the whole time and never saw a thing. This was a full face print.
Not just a side view.</b>
<br><b>The other experience I'd like to share is that when I would fall
asleep in my station (we were slow sometimes) I would lean against a wood
"wall" and every time as I drifted off a loud bang would hit the wall from
behind. It was if someone or something slammed the wall very hard. This
is impossible as the "wall" was laid up against the cavern wall and you
couldn't even fit a finger in between. It was so hard that it shook everything
attached to it.&nbsp; Needless to say I believe the Lemps still inhabit
the caverns as well as the mansion.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Uncle</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hott_dogg_gurl69@lycos.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>when i was 3 years old, my grandmother died of cancer. around the</b>
<br><b>time i was 7 or 8 my uncle divorced and shortly after re-married.</b>
<br><b>at the wedding, my cousins and i were playing on the rocks on the</b>
<br><b>other side of the yard while we were waiting for the wedding to</b>
<br><b>start. it started to get cool where we were and we went to get jackets,</b>
<br><b>by the time we had gotten to the place where our parents sat, the</b>
<br><b>wedding had just started so we sat down and waited. after the wedding</b>
<br><b>my uncles mother in law went over to talk to my uncle and she (not</b>
<br><b>knowing that my grandmother had passed away) told him that she had</b>
<br><b>saw her standing by the rocks where my cousins and i had previously</b>
<br><b>been playing, and my uncle calmly explained to her that my grandmother</b>
<br><b>had passed away 4 1/2 years prior to the wedding. then about 2 week</b>
<br><b>later my uncle got his wedding pictures and he began distibuting</b>
<br><b>them throughout the family. the day he brought them to my house</b>
<br><b>i was the only one there and he gave me them and left. I took them</b>
<br><b>out of the envelope and i began looking at them. there was one of</b>
<br><b>my uncle and step aunt, and they were standing in front of a tree.</b>
<br><b>and in the bark of the tree there was a face of a women, not thinking</b>
<br><b>much of it, i placed the pictures back in the envelope and placed</b>
<br><b>them on the table. i went outside and started playing basketball,</b>
<br><b>but i couldn't get that face out of my mind. then i remembered what</b>
<br><b>my uncles mother in law had said about seeing my deceased grandmother.</b>
<br><b>i immediately went back inside and grabbed a picture of my grandmother</b>
<br><b>and looked at the wedding picture. i believe my grandmother came</b>

<p><b>Belief in My Haunted Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One reason is that during
the day I stay home by myself and</b>
<br><b>everyday I hear footsteps going across the hall upstairs. When I'm</b>
<br><b>upstairs I don't here it though.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes early in the
morning my door will open up, even though</b>
<br><b>it doesn't latch. I used to think it was my dog, but one night we
had a</b>
<br><b>gate up so my dog couldn't get to my room, that night two of my
friends</b>
<br><b>spent the night. My door opened at about 1:30 and so I shut it then
it</b>
<br><b>opened again about an hour later. When this happened I put a big
stuffed</b>
<br><b>animal in front of it so it couldn't open. One of my friends and
I</b>
<br><b>decided to sleep on the floor (my other friend was hogging the bed)</b>
<br><b>anyway, the door kept trying to open but then it would hit my stuffed</b>
<br><b>animal and close. Both of my friends witnessed this.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a year or two ago
I had been laying in bed and all of a</b>
<br><b>sudden I seen a boy standing in my doorway. He had like a scar or</b>
<br><b>something on his face. I blinked and he disappeared like two seconds</b>
<br><b>later he was gone. I then turned the other way and tryed to sleep,
but I</b>
<br><b>didn't sleep well that night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read the article Shadow
lands has about Ouija boards and it</b>
<br><b>made me think. I realized that my friend and I were interested in
ghosts</b>
<br><b>and stuff so we used her Ouija board and tryed to contact spirits.
Then</b>
<br><b>we invited over a friend and we were using a Ouija board and asked
them</b>
<br><b>to prove they were real (BIG MISTAKE) but then we didn't know to
much.</b>
<br><b>Well after we said this we seen like a shadowy dark figure it was
fuzzy</b>
<br><b>and was weird. It scared us so we ran downstairs and tryed not to
think</b>
<br><b>about it. Soon after I moved out of that room into another and the
day I</b>
<br><b>moved out of that room my door latch broke. I know it could be nothing</b>
<br><b>though. The point is that,thats the time it all started.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've mentioned something
to my mom before but all she really said</b>
<br><b>was that she wouldn't be surprised if we had a ghost because our
house is</b>
<br><b>over 100 years old. My dad doesn't really believe in ghosts, I don't</b>
<br><b>think. There are a couple other things that have happened. I don't
think</b>
<br><b>they care, but I do.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't really

<br><b>Interest in the Paranormal</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:hampson2001@netzero.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had an interest in the paranormal for as long as I can remember.
I had my first experience with this subject when I was about 5 yrs. old.</b>
<br><b>My family lived in an apartment building that used to be a catholic
school. The church that my parents go to bought the building in the early
1970's, so that they could take advantage of the classrooms for a bible
college. The nuns old rooms, and the priests quarters were turned into
apartments which were used by the pastors and by people that had jobs in
the college. My mother worked in the bookstore and so we were able to live
in the building. Our apartment in right behind the chapel, in what used
to be one of the priests living quarters. My family has lived there for
many years, and my mom still lives there to this day. The bible college
has gotten too big for the building and has now moved to Baltimore, Maryland.
Now the building is just a branch of the church that runs the bible college.</b>
<br><b>One night after dinner, my sister ( who is 10 yrs. older than me)
and I&nbsp; went out to take the trash. To take out the trash you need
to go out the back door, take a left,&nbsp; go around the maintenance shed,
and go straight across the parking lot to the otherside where there was
a dumpster.&nbsp; Once you pass the maintenance shed you are able to look
to the rightside of the property, which is a bordered counterclock-wise
by first a line of trees, and then a swampy area. In the corner of the
property where the line of trees and the swampy area meet, there is a street
light that is part of the town hall parking lot that borders one side of
the property. The street light shines down through the line of trees into
the corner of the property.</b>
<br><b>When my sister and I came around the side of maint. shed, I looked
over to the corner of the property and saw a brightly glowing figure on
a horse. The figure had on white robes, and shield that looked like it
was made of gold and jewels on his left arm. The horse was white and also
glowing, and had armor on that closely matches the armor that used to be
worn by the knights horses in the middle ages. The horse's armor was also
made of what looked like gold and jewels. The figure was holding the reigns
for the horse in his right hand and looking right at us, except his face
was too bright to make out. I told my sister to look at the figure that
is saw. She told me to just keep walking and acted very scared. I was not
scared at all.</b>
<br><b>The figure watched us walk all the way to the dumpster and back,
all the while not moving anything except his head to follow us, and his
right arm to keep control of the horse who was moving his head up and down&nbsp;
and pawing the ground with his front leg. When my sister and I almost reached
the point where we were going to go around the maint. shed where we could
no longer see the figure, the figure let go of the reigns and reached across
the horse with his right hand and pulled a sword out of a sheith that was
strapped on the horse's side. He pulled out the sword, that had a hilt
made of gold and jewels and a glowing white blade, and put his arm straight
up into the air in what I have taken to be a salute of somekind. Once the
figure had his arm straight up, the horse went up on it's hind legs and
pawed the air. We rounded the corner just before the horse landed on the
ground again.</b>
<br><b>When we got inside we told my mother and father what we had seen.
My mom told me that the only explanation that she could give me about what
it had been was that in the bible it says that God puts angels all around
his people to protect them. She believes that what we saw was probably
one of the angels that he has looking after the church. I went over to
the area the next day to see if I could find any hoof prints or anything,
but found none.</b>
<br><b>I have since tried to ask my sister about what she remembers about
that night, but she refuses to talk about it.</b>
