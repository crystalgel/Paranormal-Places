Haunted House from 1828<br>
<br>
By: helloghostkitty@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I have been reading the stories on your website and decided to share my
own experiences.&nbsp; My family home was built in 1828, originally as
a log cabin with a cellar but converted in the 1800's into a "saltbox"
design with two stories.&nbsp; One other family owned it directly
before we did, and before that it had always been in the family of the
people who built it; their direct descendant now lives up the hill from
us.&nbsp; <br>
The only reason I believe in ghosts and the supernatural is that I grew
up in that house; otherwise, I would be a skeptic.&nbsp; A number of
things have happened in that house over the years, many of which are
similar to experiences others on this site have had.&nbsp; When I was a
child, the most common thing that occurred was that we would hear
voices talking, though they were so low and muffled that you could
never make out what they were saying.&nbsp; The nearest neighbors were
too far away for the noises to have been their radios or their own
conversations.&nbsp; We also would hear a very distinct sound of
footsteps, both at night and during the day.&nbsp; Our cats would often
watch "something" that we could not see walking or moving across the
room.<br>
Growing up in that house, I always felt that something was watching me
or standing behind me.&nbsp; I thought that it was normal to feel
afraid or apprehensive when going up the stairs and, therefore, to RUN
up the stairs as fast as I could go.&nbsp; It was only when I went to
college and then moved into a house of my own at this time that I
realized that feeling like this going up the stairs was actually not
normal!&nbsp; <br>
My parents and cats and I were not the only ones to feel something or
hear something in that house.&nbsp; My paternal grandfather refused to
spend the night there because of the strange voices.&nbsp; <br>
We never felt that the ghosts were evil, though they did scare us a bit
because they are the "unknown."&nbsp; They seem to have a definite
sense of humor and to enjoy giving us a little fright once in
awhile.&nbsp; Sometimes they would take objects (mostly books, though
sometimes my father's glasses and other small items) and hide them,
only to give them back days or weeks later, putting them in places
where we couldn't have missed them; I was fascinated to see that other
people on this website have had the same experience!&nbsp; <br>
A more recent occurrence (within the last ten years or so) has been the
appearance of "ghost cats."&nbsp; I've never seen or felt these, and
they seem to center around my father, who's very fond of cats.&nbsp; He
is also an extremely sensible, and skeptical, man, so if he says this
happened, then you can be sure it did.&nbsp; Usually the cat or cats
will come to him at night and jump up on the bed and lie down next to
him, just like his real cat does.&nbsp; The ghost cat will feel just
like a real cat, but when he reaches down to pet it, thinking that it
is the live animal, there is nothing there.&nbsp; <br>
Much of the haunting aside from this has centered around my father too;
he also has some psychic abilities, although he doesn't like to talk
about that or think about it, so perhaps he is sensitive to such
things.&nbsp; Recently, my parents were thinking seriously about moving
to a different house, since my mother is disabled and they are both in
their 60's - 70's.&nbsp; The haunting incidents really went into
overdrive at this time, though we'd not experienced much of anything
for a few years before that.&nbsp; My theory was that the ghosts did
not want my parents to leave (they have been in the house for over 30
years and have done a lot to renovate and improve it).&nbsp; Though we
have to this day never seen a ghost, during the time that my parents
were thinking of moving the ghosts made their presence known physically
more than they had before.&nbsp; They would move things in the house
(small items) and began touching my father on the shoulder, "sitting"
or leaning into his bed at night, etc., and more than once left small
items which did not belong in the house in plain sight.&nbsp; The
interesting thing is that once my parents decided they didn't want to
move after all, the haunting occurrences died down again. <br>
I'll end with the most frightening thing that happened to me,
personally.&nbsp; My parents were away in Europe for a vacation a few
years ago, and I was at their home watching the cat and dog while they
were gone.&nbsp; One night, I went down into the basement to do
laundry, and I smelled the unmistakable dank, musty smell of the old
cellar room, the door of which is always kept closed.&nbsp; This is the
original cellar of the old cabin, and the rest of the basement was
added a few decades later.&nbsp; From as far back as I can remember, I
always called this cellar room "witchy's room," and none of us has ever
gone into it unless we absolutely had to (I'm not sure why, but all of
us just get the creeps from that room).&nbsp; Well, that night, when I
was there alone for the week, "someone" had opened up that room.&nbsp;
I grabbed a broom and slammed the door shut tight with the end of the
broomhandle and then asked the ghosts to please not do that sort of
thing to me because I knew they were there already and they were just
scaring the heck out of me!&nbsp; To their credit, they didn't do
anything else while I was there; like I said, they seem to be totally
benevolent, though they do have a sense of humor and like scaring
people.<br>

Helpful Ghost In My Apartment<br>
<br>
By: MathPunk21@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Hi.&nbsp; I thought that I might share my own (extremely tame)
story.&nbsp; I used to live in a duplex that was built in 1920.&nbsp; I
lived on the second floor.&nbsp; The place was very nice&#8230;bright,
inviting, friendly.&nbsp; I never felt threatened or uncomfortable in
all 8 years that I lived there.&nbsp; I did, however, feel that there
was somebody there with me.&nbsp; Not threatening, not comforting, just
there.&nbsp; My one and only experience happened about 10 years
ago.&nbsp; I am a teacher, and on the morning in question, I was
running very late.&nbsp; We were going on a field trip that day, and I
was running about looking for my checklist.&nbsp; I was responsible for
a group of children and I had their names all written on a list along
with other important information for the day.&nbsp; I could not find my
list anywhere in my apartment.&nbsp; After looking around for a bit, I
said &#8220;Screw it, I&#8217;ll get another at school&#8221; and went to take my
shower.&nbsp; I lived alone, so talking aloud to myself was a normal
occurrence.&nbsp; I jumped in the bathroom to take a quick
shower.&nbsp; I stepped out of the shower, dried myself off and opened
the door to head for my bedroom.&nbsp; There on the floor, directly in
front of the bathroom door (placed square to the door&#8230;not just casually
thrown there) was my folded up list.&nbsp; I knew what it was without
even picking it up. It seems that somebody was listening in on my
little conversations with myself.&nbsp; I must have stared at that
paper for a solid minute without moving.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t recall being
frightened as much as awestruck.&nbsp; Incredulous.&nbsp; I got
dressed, picked up my paper and went for the door.&nbsp; On my way out,
I (somewhat sheepishly) thanked my unseen helper. <br>

My Own True Story<br>
<br>
By: Tigergirl2252@Hotmail.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, it all began when My husband and I moved into our new house in
Texas. I happen to have a six sense to where I can feel things around
me or hear things no one else can hear. The first night we moved into
our house. I was setting up the bathroom when I heard heavy breathing
behind me. I thought it was my husband Jared and asked him why he was
breathing so heavy. I heard no reply from anyone and I turned around to
find no one in the bathroom with me. I wasn't scared at first until my
husband later told me he heard the same thing when he was fixing up the
garage. After a couple months, things didn't really happen or at least
not to me because I tend not to realize whats going around me. Jared
said at night when he is home alone he would hear someone turning the
water on and off in the bathrooms. He would feel someone tugging on the
sheets when I wasn't at home at night. One morning when Jared would
leave for work, I could hear laughing upsets in the attic. My mother in
law would ask me why I'm laughing. I asked her if she heard someone
laughing upstairs and she thought it was me and I told her no. Than
things started to get more accurate. The day my husband and I had off,
I went to the store to get a few things. I came back and went into the
kitchen and I saw Jared at the sink washing dishes. I notice that
someone or something was playing with his hair causing it to fluff up
as if someone was grooming his hair. I asked him what are you doing and
he quickly turned around and saw me and his eyes went big. He got
scared and dropped the plat and flew over by me. He thought it was me
playing with his hair and it turns out that no one that I could see was
behind him. After that, things like someone tugging on the covers and
sounds of someone walking down the stairs and up where always
happening. Two years after we moved out of the house, we later found
out that a man and a woman who were happily married were murdered in
that house.<br>

Life Unlike Others<br>
<br>
By: abateman@telus.net<br>
<br>
<br>
I am 26 now and have had a life unlike any other, I have been told by
phycics that I am what they call a sensitive.&nbsp; The first time that
I can remember having an experience with the paranormal I was four
years old, this event was not scary but comforting.&nbsp; I have to
start off by saying that my grandparents helped my mom allot when I was
a baby and toddler, as she was a single mother.&nbsp; So needless to
say I was really close with my grandparents especially grandpa.&nbsp; I
was lying in bed that night I could not sleep, I remember lying there
looking at my door, it was dark as my mom was long since in bed.&nbsp;
As I looked at my door an orb of light appeared at the top and exploded
out into my room, I could see rows upon rows of gray faceless figures,
I could hear what sounded like a church song, out of the light stepped
my grandpa, he was dressed in his burial clothes.&nbsp; I sat up in bed
confused wondering why my gramps was in my room.&nbsp; He walked
towards me and sat on my bed, he started to talk to me, without moving
his lips, he told me not to be sad, that he was in a better place and
was no longer in pain, he also expressed his love for me and told me
that he would always be there to protect me, upset and confused about
what was being said I started to cry, he simply put his hand on my back
as he always did when I was upset, at that point I felt at ease and I
laid back down and watched as he got up from his place on my bed walked
back into the light from which he came, turned and smiled at me then as
fast as it had appeared it imploded and was gone.&nbsp; The next
morning I woke up went out to the living room where my mom was sitting
crying, I asked her what was wrong she told me that my grandpa had died
the night before.&nbsp; I didn't speak to anyone for three weeks
after.&nbsp; My life went on and nothing happened for about three or
four years, it started again at the age of&nbsp; 7 or 8.&nbsp; We were
living in a basement suite with my mom, step dad and new baby
sister.&nbsp; It was late and again I could not sleep, I got up and
went to the bathroom got a drink and then went back to bed, I was lying
there trying to sleep when I heard a faint baby crying, thinking it was
my sister I got up and peeked in her crib she was fast asleep.&nbsp; I
got back into bed covering my head with blankets, it got louder and
louder until it sounded like it was right next to my ear, I pulled the
covers down to look for myself but saw nothing, scared I ran out into
the hallway, where again it got louder, I ran for my moms door, when I
got there it was stuck I tried and tried but could not move the
doorknob, becoming more and more terrified I turned back to go to my
room, at the end of the hallway just after my bedroom there was a box
slightly gray blue and transparent in color.&nbsp; As I approached the
box the crying became softer, I looked in over the top of the box and
saw a newborn baby inside, I turned and ran back to my moms room and
opened the door, I woke her up and told her what I had seen she gave me
a blanket and let me sleep by the foot of her bed.&nbsp; We moved out a
short time later, the next year I remember watching the news with my
step dad, when I saw the house that we used to live in, the man on the
news reported that a baby had been found in the alley outside the
house, that the lady had given birth in the bath tub and in fear of her
boyfriend (the babies father) had wrapped the baby in sheets put it in
a box and left it in the alley for someone to find it, only no one
found it in time, the garbage man found it two days later frozen to
death.&nbsp; I got chills.&nbsp; My family moved once again.&nbsp; When
I was nine I was visited yet again, my mom and stepdad who was an
incredibly violent and mean man where fighting, he decided that he was
going to make an example of my mother and beat her in front of me while
she was holding my then 2 1/2 year old sister. He beat on her for hours
in front of us, when he finally tired of that he want and sat in the
living room, we were sent to bed not that we could sleep, as I lay
there listening to my mom sobbing in the other room I felt an
overwhelming feeling of comfort and love I rolled over and again saw my
grandpa sitting on the edge of my bed, he smiled a smile of pity and
again started to speak without moving his lips.&nbsp; He told me that
he loved me and that he had been watching out for me and informed me
that it would all be over soon.&nbsp; That was in June by august my mom
had filed for divorce and we were on our own.&nbsp; I have seen other
things all my life, I can hear people speaking to me just before I go
to sleep sometimes, although I can never figure out what they are
saying, I have not had an experience in a long time, I am glad as I
have asked not to receive anymore, they have tried but I always tell
them to leave.&nbsp; I don't want to have to worry about seeing these
things with my kids around, I believe my daughter who is named after my
grandpa has seen him before, although not able to tell me.&nbsp; When
she was a baby she would smile at nothing or something just behind me,
I always felt that it was him.<br>
Thanks for letting me tell my story!<br>

My Family's House<br>
<br>
By: celeste@destone.co.za<br>
<br>
<br>
I have been spending hours reading stories on your web site and I think
it is time that I told my own experiences.I live in South-Africa and my
story begins in my great grandmothers house (It is still in my family
my grandfather still owns the property and stays on it as well in a
house build 23 year ago ( my age) on the same property. Let me stop
boring you with the details and get to my story it is a long one.<br>
The 1st people to stay in the house as I have been told was called
Bloem the whole area is called Bloempark as I understand this was the
first house to actually be build in the area. The Bloem's sold to my
great grandparents.<br>
When my great grandfather died (long before I was born) my great
grandmother stayed on alone on the property and as years went by her
health was not very good any more and my grandfather build a house for
him and my grandmother on the property about 150 meters away form the
original house.<br>
The first occurrence told by my grandmother : My mom was a baby and my
grandparents were visiting my great grandparents - They slept over
because they lived far away.My mom as I understand about 3 months
old.She slept between my grandmother and grandfather on a double bed.
My grandmother woke up in the morning to find my mom missing.She found
her wrapped in her blanket peacefully asleep on a carpet (made of some
skin) in front of the bed.<br>
Years went by and..<br>
My mom was expecting me and she and my grandma was on their way to my
great grandmother house. This happened during the day. My mom and
grandma saw a little old lady dressed like the old "voortrekkers" by
the dam. This scared them because during that time there was mostly
grass and corn lands everywhere and just a dirt road leading to the
plot and they did not know the little old lady( A plot is a bit smaller
than a farm) They ran and my dad and grandpa went to investigate but
found nothing. This is impossible because there is nowhere to hide or
run especially for an old lady.<br>
My great grandmother was a loving person and we were all very fond of
her.A couple of years after she passed away my family ( My mom,dad and
me) moved into the house. During that time the house was already passed
100 years old.Again she was expecting ( my brother) and she was home
alone ( Grandparents basically living next door) she was sitting in the
TV room and she saw a door open by it self and she saw the figure (dark
outlined&nbsp; shadow)of a big man standing there and walking away
peacefully -She still thinks to this day that it was my great
grandfather checking up on her because she was sick at the time. All
the men in my family are big men and she says that it fits my great
grandfathers description.<br>
Years went by and this is were I come in.Let me say first that I am not
scared of that house because I believe it is my family keeping an eye
over us ,even though I had a bad experiences in a other house we use to
live.I never actually saw anything but heard it.The TV would go on and
off by itself in the middle of the night or the stereo would go on on
top volume playing a cd in the middle of the night and wake us al up
etc. and I had a experience in my room where I felt a presence I was
cold could not breath or move one knight and felt a presence that was
not very friendly. Then we moved to my great grandmothers house...<br>
One night I was working on a school assignment (very late) and saw a
figure pass right by me (a dark shadow)between the couch and dining
room table where I was sitting. -the room was dark just the TV was on
and I was doing last minute touch up's on my assignment.I went into the
kitchen where this person had to go-turned on the light and there was
no one.I woke my parents asking if one of them went to the kitchen.They
replied that the hadn't and my dad got up to check it out.Nothing-He
thought it was my imagination.Months later I found out from a friend of
the family that slept over one night-he was lying on he couch watching
TV and saw the same thing pass behind the couch walking into the
kitchen.He also checked it out and found nothing.<br>
My room was big and always cold. I never thought it ought until I read
some of the stories on your site.I thought my room was just cold
because it did not get enough sun or something ,but when I thought
about it&nbsp; I had BIG windows in my room.I never really saw any
thing again but felt a presence often especially when I was sad or
scared for some reasons.However I did wake up one morning and had a big
hand print (smudge but very clear) on my cupboard mirror.. (The house
does not have build in cupboards) Onto this day I am so mad at myself
for not taking a picture (did not have cell phone with cameras during
that time) The house was cleaned during the day by the girl that worked
for us and she wiped the mirror clean.The hand print was about twice my
hand size and looked like a skeleton print. I could see the bones
especially the thumb clearly.Somebody wanted to say hello and I would
like to think it was my great grandfather because I never met him,and I
suspected something I think he just confirmed his presence.My close
friend (we were always together) slept with me in my room whenever he
stayed over-he just said that the house scared him but would not
elaborate. We moved to town and later my uncle and his wife moved in.
His wife was terrified of the house and they moved away soon ,she would
also not tell why she was so scared, she thought of all reasons to tell
everybody but I think I know the real answer.<br>
The house is being rented out to other people at the moment and I
haven't heard them complain.I will be visiting the property this
weekend and I will go down to that old house that I sometimes miss so
much just to see if the feeling is still in my room.It was always
stronger when I was sad or upset.<br>
Well this is my story I hope you enjoyed it<br>

My First House<br>
<br>
<br>
By: clipscomb@caseyarchitects.com<br>
<br>
When I was 23 I bought my first house. It was/is a 1925 bungalow on the
edge of a historic part of town. I got a really good deal on it since
it had been on the market for over a year. (Should have been my first
clue- houses in this area at that time normally sold in about 20 days)
I bought it from a man whose job had been relocated out-of-town and
really needed to sell. This house had been his rental property and he
lived in another home he owned a few blocks away. (The other house had
sold immediately) I thought that the fact that it had been a rental was
strange, because it was in really good shape. I found out that the guy
I bought it from had only owned it a couple of years and had purchased
the house from the original owner.<br>
I spent the first few evenings (after work) removing the carpets to
expose the hardwood floors, lining cupboards, cleaning, etc.
Essentially getting ready to move in. During this time I experienced
feelings that I could only explain as strange at the time- like I was
in someone else's home the whole time I was there. I just attributed
this to the fact that I had only just purchased it and none of my stuff
was there. After my cat and I moved in, odd things began to occur. The
first thing I remember was coming home from work one afternoon and
finding all of the bathroom drawers standing open. (I hadn't yet moved
my stuff into the drawers) I knew that I hadn't left the drawers like
that, my cat was unable to even open a door that was partially open to
let herself in a room so I knew it wasn't her. (Plus, the top drawer
was out of her reach and they were all pulled all-of-the-way out of the<br>
cabinet- any further and they would have fallen completely out of the
cabinet and onto the floor.) I shut all of the drawers and called my
brother-in-law to change all of the locks. (he owns a hardware store)
There were a few other instances of this but never all of the drawers.
Every other time it happened, it was one or two drawers and always ones
that I hardly used.<br>
About this same time I would notice that small things were not in the
same location that I had left them. Pieces of paper, glasses, mail,
etc. It was always stuff that I had just set down and was going to get
back to later. It was really never anything that was permanently in the
house- photos, vases, stuff like that, it was always insignificant
things that I was not 100% positive had been moved, but, they seemed
like they had been. The house just always felt "different" when I would
come home from work. Sometimes magazines would simply be rotated 90
degrees- little stuff like that.<br>
&nbsp;I put the cat litter box in the guest bedroom due to the fact
that I didn't want her going into the basement. It was concrete and
clean but one end opened to the crawl space that was the last 10 feet
of the house's depth. The only problem with her litter being in the
guest room was that it was difficult to keep the door to that room
open. It would spontaneously shut on it's own. I put a basket of books
in front of the opened door to help hold it open. I figured that there
was something wrong with the hinges.<br>
This seemed to work until one day I came home to find the door shut again.<br>
As I pushed the door open I noticed that it would only open about half
way due to the fact that the basket of books was still in position!
Somehow the door had shut around the basket that was holding it open.<br>
While all of this was happening I simply never felt alone in the house-
ever. Every time I took a shower I felt like there was a man in the
corner of the bathroom watching me. This was a really overwhelming
feeling and happened every day until one day I had had enough and said
out loud "please don't watch me anymore while I shower". After that, I
never had that feeling again (while showering). He would still watch me
in other parts of the house and especially while I was brushing my
teeth.<br>
At least once a week I would come home to the toilet seat up (this
lasted for years-even after I confronted the ghost- which I'll tell you
about in a minute). This was really strange considering I am a female
(lived alone) and always leave the seat down. But, sure enough I would
come home and the seat would be up like a guy had been there. In the
first year that I lived in that house I had the locks changed 3
separate times. Every time I would change the locks only me and my
parents would have a copy.<br>
There were a few nights (before I had central air conditioning
installed) that I would sleep out on the sofa- there was a window A/C
unit in the living room and one in the dining room- they would pretty
much keep the house cool. Actually, the house's normal state was pretty
cool but it gets into the low 100's for about a week every summer and
it would be stuffy in my bedroom. So, the first few times I moved out
onto the sofa to sleep.<br>
Every time I did this I had a strong feeling that I shouldn't be out
there- that something in the house didn't want me to sleep anywhere but
in my bedroom. One night, while sleeping on the sofa to be cooler, I
woke up to find my TV armoire doors opening and shutting on their own.
I got up and went back to the bedroom- never to sleep on the sofa
again. (I installed central air before the next summer started).<br>
Another night while sleeping in bed I awoke very startled. I sat
straight up in bed and saw this strange light in the hallway. The light
was creating a silhouette of a man on the opposite wall. He was really
tall around 6'3"<br>
or 6'4", broad shouldered, had curly hair, was really big- but not fat,
and was walking toward the bathroom. That was the night that I
confronted him and told him I had bought the house and it was mine. He
needed to move on and leave me and my cat alone. (I would have these
random thoughts through-out the day- while at work- that my cat was
being chased around the house by something) I told him that we didn't
want to see him or his antics anymore. The hall was in the very center
of the house- with no windows into it so there is no way any outside
light was shining in the hallway. Plus, our street did not have street
lights on it so it was very dark in the neighborhood at night. Things
sort of slowed down after that. Except I knew that he was still there
because I could still feel his presence and him watching me.<br>
No one was allowed to talk about "the ghost" in the house. If they did
stuff would immediately start happening. Sometimes stuff would start
happening even while the person who had brought it up was still there.
One night I had a few friends over. A woman asked me about my ghost and
the toilet started flushing over and over and over again. Normally,
however, if someone brought it up it would just mean that for the next
few days I would find the toilet seat up and things moved from their
normal location more frequently. One night, I came home a little later
than normal and noticed that the toilet seat was up again. While I was
going to the bathroom I muttered to myself that "you are going to have
to do better than this if you are going to scare me". The next morning,
while getting ready for work, I couldn't find my comb. I am a really
organized person and everything has its place. My comb was always in a
basket in the bathroom. I searched the entire house and couldn't find
it. I ended up buying a new one on the way home from work that day and
somewhat forgot about the missing comb. Two weeks later the toilet
started flushing on its own over and over again. I lifted the lid off
of the tank- not an easy task. The tank hung on the wall and you had to
slip it out from under some trim then lift it off of the tank to look
inside. When I looked inside my "missing" comb was floating in the
water. I guess that "he" had gotten upset that I seemed to forget about
the missing comb and wanted to show me where it was. I want to also
point out here that those were the only two times in the entire seven
years I lived in that house that the toilet flushed on its own. In both
cases, as soon as it was noticed that the toilet was indeed flushing on
it's own- it would immediately stop flushing and begin working normally
again without any other action (like fixing any part of the toilet)
taking place. The rest of the seven years it always functioned normally.<br>
(this is long- I'm sorry, but stuff happened all of the time)<br>
Every time I would walk down the basement stairs I found myself
thinking "don't you dare push me" over and over and over again in my
mind. For some reason I never thought of this as strange, and for the
longest time I didn't even realize I did it. It was just something in
my subconscious saying it.<br>
On one trip to the basement as soon as I stepped onto the concrete
floor "he" poked me in the back- really hard. I turned and went
upstairs. It was a few weeks before I would go back down there.<br>
About this same time I started really redecorating the house, painting
every room- really intense colors- everything was white before, I
changed out all of the light fixtures to new reproductions, changed out
kitchen counter tops, sink, faucets, had built-in cabinets made in the
dining room.<br>
New roof, new privacy fence at the back yard, new siding on the house,
changed out the shutters, the storm doors and windows, painted the
front door. Ripped all of the wallpaper out of the bathroom and painted
it- almost every finish material in the house was different. All of the
changes to the house REALLY seemed to slow down the strange
occurrences. I would still catch a glimpse of a tall dark shadow moving
toward me in the basement while doing laundry and I still never really
felt alone, but, I really don't remember any episodes after the
remodel. Maybe I just had gotten used to things in my "fun house" and
ignored most of it. Who knows?<br>
After finishing up all of the remodeling, I got married and my husband
and our dog moved in. Things really slowed down after that except that
we would be woken up in the middle of the night a lot. We would both
say we had heard the same thing, but couldn't ever find a source for
any of the sounds. It was normally banging, or breaking glass, or a
loud screech. Oh, that reminds<br>
me- I also heard voices talking in the middle of the night when I first
moved into the house. I always attributed it to the neighbors (which is
odd because I never heard any of the neighbors during the day) I was
pretty good at rationalizing stuff to myself so that I wouldn't be
scared. Until there was about a 9 month span that both of the rental
houses on either side of me were empty- I still heard the voices in the
middle of the night. They were definitely coming from my house. Usually
they would stop after I woke up so I got pretty good at completely
ignoring them. (which is probably why I forgot to write about them
before now).<br>
After about two years of marriage we decided to buy a bigger house. We
showed our house to a few "friends of friends" before we went on the
market with a realtor. One Sunday (during this time of showing it to
friend's of<br>
friend's) I noticed a car with a man and woman sitting in it in front
of our house. We didn't have a for sale sign up yet so I figured that
one of our friends had sent them to look at the house. I asked my
husband if he knew of anyone coming to see the house that day. He
didn't, so I ignored them. They were still out there about 20 minutes
later so my husband went out to see if they needed help. The woman said
that they were in from out-of-town to visit her mother and she was just
bringing her husband by to show him her grandmother's old house. (our
house- her grandmother had been the original owner from 1925-1996.) I
asked her if she wanted to see inside. Normally I would never offer a
tour of my home to strangers but we had been showing it to people
anyway and were about to go on the real estate market so I figured why
not? She jumped at the chance and they came in. She was explaining to
her husband exactly how it used to look. (Her memories were exactly
what the house looked like when I moved in 7 years prior to this and
before all of the remodeling). I showed her the living room, dining
room, and kitchen.<br>
When we went into the kitchen she explained that when her grandmother
lived there the kitchen always smelled like Fig Newton's. (it still
smelled like that after I moved in-two years after her grandmother had
moved out). They stayed for about 15 minutes. On her way out of the
house, I had this overwhelming feeling to ask her if she had ever known
anyone to pass away in the house. She looked at me and went stark
white. She said her grandfather had died in the house. She went on to
tell me about how horrible of a man he<br>
was- how he used to verbally and physically abuse her grandmother and
her mother. She went on and on about how horrible he was. I told her
that I was sorry that he was so terrible and that I believed he was
still in the house.<br>
Then she told me that he had died before she was born and wanted to call her mom to see if he had really died in the house.<br>
She called her mom, told her mom where she was and then started asking
her questions. When she got off of the phone she told me that in 1972
her grandfather had a terrible stroke. He then had a dream that God
came to him and told him he was going to die on a certain day in
October of that same year and to be ready. Well, that day in October
came and he died of a massive heart attack in the bathroom of the
house. Her mother had asked her to ask me if he slammed doors in my
face. I told her that he shut doors a<br>
lot- but never slammed them in my face. She went on to say that her
grandmother went on living in the house for 24 years-until one day she
"fell" down the stairs to the basement and broke her hip. (I didn't tell<br>
her- but I am positive he pushed her down the stairs- my subconscious
had always known he was capable of that). After braking her hip, she
moved to a nursing home and they sold the house to the man that I had
bought it from.<br>
My ghost's name was Lloyd Wimmer. I asked her if he had been a big man
and described the silhouette I had seen in the hallway years before.
She freaked out and started digging through her purse and said that was
EXACTLY what he had looked like and said she had a photo of him and her
grandmother in her purse. I told her that was okay, I really didn't
want to see a photo of him!<br>
The next few weeks I was really tense. All of my suspicions had been
confirmed. I had known it was a man, I knew he had died in the
bathroom, and I had known that he felt superior to women. (I think that
I really threw him off track because I am a very strong and independent
woman) I went to the neighbors house across the street that night. She
and I were pretty good friends (having lived across the street from
each other for 7 years- she had lived in her house for 10 years) I told
what I had just found out about Lloyd. She got this look of
astonishment on her face and said "so, THAT'S why he couldn't keep a
renter in that house for more than a month!" She was talking about the
guy I had bought the house from- which explained to me why it didn't
"look" like a rental when I had bought it- no one lived in it for<br>
very long between the original owner and me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We sold the house- (in 14 days<br>
this time) and moved into our new house (about a mile away and in the
middle of the historic district). Our new house is actually older than
the first one, but it is 'clean'. There is no presence there.
Matter-of-fact the first week we were there, my husband was out back
with the dog (my cat had total kidney failure at 17 years old and we
had had to put her to sleep right before we moved) My husband and dog
were in the backyard at the new house. I was upstairs in the guest room
making the guest bed and putting pictures up when it hit me. I felt
alone. Totally alone. No one was watching me from the corner. It was
the first time in 7 years that I had been alone in my own home and
actually felt alone. Before we left the old house I told Lloyd that he
was not to follow or come with us.<br>
Since then I have met some friends that go on ghost hunts (along with<br>
professionals) and actually have their own EVP equipment. On one hand I
kind of wish that I had known them while we still lived in the house.
On the other, I am glad I didn't. If Lloyd was so horrible that his
granddaughter, who had never even met him, thought so badly of him I
don't think that I want to know what he was saying to me all of those
years!<br>

My Gran<br>
<br>
By: Bigdaverox1@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
My gran died when I was three. Since then I have seen her three times.
The first time was about a couple of months after she passed away, when
I was four. I can't actually remember this happening, but my mum can.
She says I came into her room, really scared, saying I saw my gran.
Since I was only four and very scared, she told me that ghosts didn't
exist and that it was probably a dream.<br>
The second time it happened I think I was six. Though i'm not sure
whether it was actually a ghost this time, i'm not sure. But I was
still terrified. I think I saw a figure standing at the end of my bed.
As I said, I'm not sure if this was my gran or even a ghost, but it's
worth thinking about nonetheless.<br>
The third time it happened, was only last year, when I was thirteen. It
was the anniversary of her death. I woke up and I saw a figure standing
at my door. Since it wasn't a threatening presence and it was the
anniversary of my grans death, I assumed it was her. I sat upright but
at that moment, she disappeared<br>
I never knew my granddad, he died before I was born. But I have seen
pictures of him before. anyway, once I was sitting in the back of a
car, staring into the sky, just daydreaming. I snap out of my daydream
when I see a cloud formed in a perfect image of my granddad and his two
dogs. I know it seems cheesy and very ridiculous but it does seem like
quite a coincidence that the clouds formed like that.<br>
And still to this day, I still see shapes and lights out of the corner
of my eye. I'm not scared of them because now I know they're not trying
to scare me and I know I shouldn't scared.<br>

Regarding Real Ghost Experiences<br>
<br>
By: dollyluver@msn.com<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I live in a first floor apartment in Harrow in the U.K, and I have
lived here all my life. (I'm 17.) The place was built pre-World War II,
I believe in the early 1930's. The experiences here have mainly
happened to my mother, and she is a very reliable source as she is an
athiest and doesn't really believe in the afterlife. When she and my
father first moved in (he has never seen anything) she was making her
way down the stairs to the front door and she missed her footing and
would have fallen, had it not been for our "spirit", who she felt
pushing her back. This happened a couple of times. Other times she
would be doing everyday chores and feel exactly like someone had come
up right behind her and was just standing observing her. <br>
She also had (and still has) a thing about the staircase. We have a
curtain which is pulled across in winter to prevent the cold coming up
the stairs, and my mother always swore there was someone sitting on the
stairs. My dad laughed it off, saying, "Yeah, it was me!" Only the
occurences happened whist he was working.&nbsp; In the end it gave her
the creeps and she bought a crucifix and hung it over the stairs, as it
was the only thing she could think of doing. And for a time, it seemed
to work - the occurences stopped, and she hoped the spirit had found
his peace (she was sure it was a man). <br>
Nothing much happened until I was about 13 or 14. My father was
vacuuming in our lounge, and I and my mum were sitting on her bed
watching TV and fooling around. We shut up to watch the TV for a
moment, and distinctly heard someone go into our tiny kitchen, take a
glass, and fill it with water from the tap. Now we knew it couldn't be
my father as the lounge is next door to the main bedroom and he would
have had to walk in front of the door to get in the kitchen. My mum
shouted, "Did you knock a glass over or something?" <br>
My dad immediately got irate and said, "Of course not, I'm still vacuuming!" <br>
When I went into the kitchen to investigate, the glass was on the
draining board, still full of water. We were a bit startled but not
really frightened. Our most common occurence is mainly of someone
coming in the front door. It's usually in the evening. Sometimes I hear
it, other times it's just my mum. Usually I dismissed it as background
noise, but one evening there was no denying it. My mum was drifting in
and out of sleep and I was next to her in the lounge, reading. We both
heard the&nbsp; front door slam hard and the sound of keys. Taking a
crutch (my mum is disabled) as a weapon, I thoroughly searched the
entire apartment, heart racing, only to find no-one there. As my father
was outside working in the shed, my mum opened one eye and said, "I'll
kill your father. I wish he'd tell us when it's him going in and out
the door so we don't think it's a burglar." When he came in a few hours
later, he swore he'd never been near the door since he'd walked out of
it earlier that day. These things didn't really bother us as such, and
my best friend who loves anything paranormal finds these stories
fabulous! The only time our ghost nearly got us in trouble was about<br>
2 weeks ago, from July 5th to July 10th, 2006. My mum had an envelope
which she kept spare money in as things are tight. It was kept in a
draw with my underwear (hey hey!) and was always perched on the top of
the clothes when I went in the drawer. One day i was told to fetch it
and it wasn't there. We turned the flat UPSIDE DOWN every day. We took
every single drawer out of the unit, emptied out the clothes and
searched at least twice. Every cupboard, drawer, purse and room was
thoroughly searched. In the end my mother resorted to asking my dad if
he'd borrowed it for petrol, which he denied. On the following Monday I
went to the drawer, wondering if I could have possibly missed it. When
I opened the drawer it was neatly folded and placed carefully on top of
the clothes. I opened up the envelope to find the exact same &pound;20
note that was there before. I could identify it as this note had been
signed by an accountant at some point - the signature was there. I said
to my mum, "You found the money then?" She looked at me as if I was
mad. She said, "We haven't found it. I've been looking again this
morning." <br>
I said,&nbsp; "It's in the drawer." She said, "You're joking." I went
and got the envelope, and showed her the note, signature and all. We
just cannot explain it. Other things have also gone missing, only to
turn up days later, exactly where we left them.<br>
I have a few other things to tell, but I'll leave it for another time! Sorry this was so long!<br>

Same story as the Indian at Grandma's House<br>
<br>
By: janatmsn@verizon.net <br>
<br>
There was a person who wrote the Indian at Grandma's House. I had the
exact same experience. I live in a small apartment complex and another
woman said the same thing only at first I didn't put it together. There
was a woman living in our apartments who came out of her apartment
screaming that a man just walked by her window-The sliding glass doors
but nobody really paid too much attention to her-they thought she saw
something outside but why would she run out side in her pajamas if that
were true-she was hysterical. Most people blamed it on the fact that
she was recently divorced and was upset so therefore they concluded
that she imagined this or made it sound worse than it was. I also had
the same experience I was reading on the couch and all of a sudden from
the corner of my eye I saw a man appear from the bottom up like someone
lifted a shade-he walked across the room never turning to look at me
and when he approached the table and the end of the couch he
disappeared. He was very tall and had long hair and he was dressed like
an Indian and He looked Indian. There is an Indian graveyard not too
far from where I live and a shopping area was constructed there. It
seems like everyone in this area has some sort of experience. The
person who lived upstairs from me was awoke in the middle of the night
by a plant falling off of the windowsill but the window wasn't open.
The thing she remarked about was the fact that it fell but not a speck
or dirt was on the ground because it landed flat (kind of like it was
taken off of the sill and just dropped straight down) I have noticed
that this person shows up before people move. The lady in the apartment
that ran out in her pajamas moved shortly after that. And I moved from
one apartment to another. I guess if you live in the United States you
are bound to have this type of experience because this was all Indian
land at one time and who knows where the burial grounds were. The
Indian that walked through the house looked like a phantom rather than
a ghost. The one thing I noticed is that he had a muscle in his upper
leg that we do not have because I could see it move up and down as he
walked through the house. Please don't print my email address<br>
Thank you<br>

The Man in the WWII Army Clothes<br>
<br>
By: boat84@frontiernet.net<br>
<br>
This might sound a little wierd but i swear that i saw ''him''...true story<br>
Well it all started when i moved into this house in Lake Havasu
City,AZ.When i first moved in i felt like something kept watching me
but i just ignored it like alot of things i feel, but this one kept
coming back.The first time i saw ''him'' was when i was laying in my
bed watching t.v. and i thought that i saw someone walking down the
hallway(the hallway goes right past my room into the kitchen) and i
figured that it was my mom or something.Than it came back past my room
and it stoped in my doorway and i looked at it.I noticed that ''he''
was wearing world war 2 army clothes and i thought about my grandpa,he
was in world war 2,and ''he'' looked like my grandpa.So i wasnt scared
at all the only way i could go to sleep was to see him and he stayed
there untill i went to sleep...i felt safe.Well this went on for awhile
and didn't really care anymore untill i met my best friend,Amanda, she
was cool and we did every thing together. I thought that it was finally
the time for her to spend the night so she did.It was about 10:00pm and
we decided to play a board game(i cant sleep unless my door is
open).When all of a sudden ''he'' was there and i smiled at him and
went back to the game than Amanda started to freak out and asked me who
the man standing in my door way was and i said that ''you can see
''him'' too!''Than sfter that i didn't really see him any more untill
the night before my grandma passed away.That was a weird night cause i
was&nbsp; at my friends birthday party and it was a sleep over so when
i saw ''him'' i called my mom and she said that everything was fine
.When i went home the next day she told me that grandma passed away but
i wasn't suprised at all.My name is Brianna Thompson and i have lived
in the same house and he comes around every once in awhile.By the way
all of this happened in 5th grade.Thanks for reading.<br>

The Old Tavern Haunting<br>
<br>
By: kribor@bigpond.com.au<br>
<br>
I have been a fan of your site for some years now.&nbsp; I have had
some experiences myself but I want to share one with you that happened
recently.&nbsp; It is not a really big deal, but it still gave me quite
a "buzz".&nbsp; <br>
My husband and myself were in an old tavern that is in the Adelaide
area (South Australia) and it is a place that was built somewhere
between the 1840s and 1850s.&nbsp; It is reputed to be haunted and they
even have a name for the ghost.&nbsp; For the purposes of this story, I
will call the ghost "Harry".&nbsp; The owners and staff are quite
adamant the place is haunted and there are stories of the place being
locked up overnight only for the owners to return the next morning and
find things moved around.&nbsp; I am talking about major movements in
the bar area.&nbsp; Pictures being moved, furniture, etc.&nbsp; <br>
Well, my husband was standing in the doorway between the bistro, which
was closed and in darkness, and the bar, which curves around in an L
shape sort of.&nbsp; We were just minding our own business, watching a
band, chatting with other people.&nbsp; Next thing he tells me that he
felt someone touch him on his back.&nbsp; Now, he would have had to
feel quite a definite touch as he was wearing a thick suede jacket, as
it was a cold night.&nbsp; I didn't really think much of it.&nbsp; <br>
Well, later on I was standing in the same spot and my husband had gone
around the corner to get a drink, the poor girl behind the bar had to
work the whole area, so he went around to her.&nbsp; I was just
standing there at the bar casually when I felt someone touch me on the
back also.&nbsp; Now, I was also wearing a thick suede jacket, so it
was a definite touch.&nbsp; <br>
What I had neglected to mention earlier was that there was absolutely
no-one in the bistro, anywhere behind where my husband had been
standing or where I stood later on.&nbsp; There was no-one there,
nothing nearby, nothing to attribute the "touch" to and the area was
definitely in darkness, deserted, etc, etc.&nbsp; <br>
Suffice to say, we now believe we have had contact with "Harry" and
that he had heard us asking about him (we had asked the girl behind the
bar about the stories earlier on) and that he had let us know he was
there and was real.&nbsp; Perhaps we were also standing in his
favourite spot at the bar and maybe he was asking us to move out of his
space?!<br>
Hope the story isn't too tame for you.&nbsp; <br>

There with Me<br>

<br>
Hello I read some of the stories that is on the Shadowlands Website and
some of them are creepy and some of the pictures that you have on it
are just outright scary, like the pic of the ghost in the picture of
Christ, that is just plain evil.<br>
Well heres my ghost experience, This all happened about a month after
my grandpa passed away, and i was in my 2nd year of highschool,and I
was the only one home at the time mom and grandma went out. I was just
about to fall asleep so i wrapped myself up in my blanket, because it
was cold in the house and all the sudden my blankets were literally
ripped off my bed and placed infront of my door. When that happened, I
stayed awake the rest of the night. I told my mom and Grandma about it
and they just looked at me, Grandma said that it could have been my
grandpa saying he was there with me.<br>

Towngate Theatre<br>
<br>
By: MandyJ312@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In Wheeling, WV...there is an old church that was made into a theatre.
I was in the cast for a play there and during the shows, anyone who is
not on stage is downstairs. During one of the shows, anyone standing by
a certin door could smell some kind of mens cologne. The guy who
smelled it first walked around smelling everyone and found out that no
one was wearing it. We all just let it past as someone sprayed it
before anyone came and had left all ready.<br>
Today, I was the only person besides a director who was upstairs. I
smelled the cologne the second I walked by the door, but didn't think
anything of it. I then was fixing my hair in a mirror right by the door
when I looked down to find something in my purse. When I looked back up
I saw a man, about 5 foot 7, standing a few feet behind me. He was
white and looked around 65. When I blinked he was gone. Not only 1
minute later I heard footsteps but saw no one. After asking the
director if he had walked downstairs and if any one else was in the
builing, he repled no, and asked why. I told him and he said a few
people had smelled colonge and heard footsteps before. I then stayed
outside untill someone else came.<br>

Walking High Heels and Screaming Branches<br>
<br>
<br>
By: egyptiankitten1@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
One time, my cousins, Sukie and Katie and I had a sleep over at my
house. Of course, they were not very scared during the night. They had
no reason to be. They knew of my said 'ghost' that I both named and
heard his name was Tom. <br>
I pretty much thought that he was the only ghost I had. I have bin proven wrong. <br>
One day, like I said, Sukie and Katie spent the night at my house. It
was very late. Maybe 12 or 1 at night. Me and Katie were asleep, till
Sukie woke me up, telling me she heard something. I sat up and we both
listened. We couch hear high heels walking from in my living room where
the main door was, all the way to my small hallway that lead to both
the bathroom, my room, and my brother's room then it stopped. Sadly, I
was stupid enough to have closed the door before going to sleep. Me and
her, being scared at the moment, quickly woke up my cousin Katie. When
she did we told her to listen. But she heard nothing. All the sounds
had stopped. We ventured out of my room and looked around. The doors
were all locked and my parents and brother were sound asleep.<br>
Maybe three or so months later, my cousin Sukie spent the night at my
house again. But only her. We had bin talking about the situation and I
learned she had heard the high heels walking up from the concrete path
outside, to my porch. then stopped. That was when she woke me up.<br>
I was surprised. Never before had that happened.<br>
Either way, the next day we went out into my backyard to play a bit of
Frisbee.&nbsp; We tossed the Frisbee back and forth seeing who would
make the Frisbee drop first. Then Sukie stopped suddenly. Her face
paled a bit. "Did you hear that?" she asked me.<br>
I listened closely, and then my dog, Blacky, stood up and growled at the tree that was in the middle of the yard. <br>
After a while Blacky stopped and curled up and fell asleep and me and Sukie continued our game. <br>
It was maybe five or ten minutes later when Blacky woke up. She growled
at the tree and then went under the house in fear I supposed. <br>
A scream and branches breaking was heard and me and Sukie rushed away
from the tree. We didn't see anything fall out from it though. We went
up to the tree and looked up. Everything was the same. We turned to
each other with big eyes before leaving the backyard.<br>

Why Me?<br>
<br>
By: freebird_46349@yahoo.com<br>

In the early 90's I lived in Cedar Lake, Indiana with my best friend at
the time.&nbsp; We were living in her boyfriend's grandmother's
house.&nbsp; She and her husband had both died.&nbsp; My friend's
daughter Heather was about<br>
3 yrs. old at the time.&nbsp; She and I shared a room and my friend and her other child slept in the other room.<br>
&nbsp;Heather frequently woke during the night crying and saying the lady woke her up.<br>
I never thought much of it until one day around 11 in the morning I was
sitting in the livingroom on the couch.&nbsp; The livingroom had a wide
open archway into the kitchen.&nbsp; The kitchen had an arched doorway
which entered a small hall.&nbsp; To the left was the laundry room, to
the right the exit to the back yard.&nbsp; Right in front of the
archway was the bathroom door.<br>
My friend was in the laundry room doing laundry and we were talking
back and forth.&nbsp; I thought she was coming out of the laundry room,
but when I looked up I saw an old woman walk from the laundry room,
past the doorway in front of the bathroom, and head for the back yard. <br>
I was flabbergasted to say the least.&nbsp; Although she appeared
transparent, I could see the fine details of her appearance and her
clothing, right down to the colors. (purples) We went up the street to
talk to the deceased woman's daughter-in-law and told her the
story.&nbsp; When I described the woman who I had never seen before she
told me that her husband, the deceased woman's son had seen her tending
to her flower beds before also.&nbsp; When she showed me a picture I
could of passed out.&nbsp; It was indeed the same woman.<br>
I sincerely believe that she was looking out for Heather, my friend's
daughter, and was the woman waking her up.&nbsp; My friend was in a
terrible relationship with Heather's father, the deceased woman's
grandson.&nbsp; He was a violent alcoholic.<br>

Hello, my name is Derrick and I have been visiting this website for
about a yeatr or more now and I thought that I should share some
stories that happened to me. <br>
It all started when I was 12 years old and I was sleeping in my old
house that didn't seem haunted at all untill one night i was in the
middle of sleeping when all of a sudden I woke up and could hear
children all around my bed laughing like a playing laughter, and I
crawled around my bed dizzy looking off the edge of my bed trying to
see who all was laughing but I never saw anything but children's
laughter is all that was heard.&nbsp; I everntually went back to sleep
and awoke the next morning very sick with a fever and ever since that
night in the very same house I have seen black shadows peer in and out
of my bedroom door and I have been able to see the figure of a
partially invisable person whenever it is dark and when I look for it
and I like to believe that I can see ghosts because of these figures
that I see whenever I look for them, they are either flying around the
room that I am in or they are either standing in one spot in the room
either floating in the air or standing. Also in the very same house my
older brother told me that one night he was sleeping and woke up in the
middle of the night dizzy and could see a shadowy figure in the shape
of a child standing next to his bed and my brother told me that the
next morning when he woke up that he had a red mark on his arm.&nbsp;
Another thing that has happened to me in that same house is one day I
was in my bedroom and I like to listen to my music with my head phones
plugged into it so that my parents wouldn't hear my music and complain,
but anyways I was listening to a cd on my stero and all of a sudden in
the middle of my song I heard a older woman's voice say help me and I
freaked out and ran upstairs and told my parents but they didn't
believe me (the song was a kidrock song from his second album).&nbsp;
Another smll thing that happened in that house was that I walked by my
sister's room and in her room she had a Rug Rats doll of Tommy sitting
on one of her chairs in her room and anyways I walked by her room and I
heard the doll say something to me as I walked by but I don't remember
what it had said but the voice sounded just like the character off the
t.v. sounded like and the voice was a clear sound too.&nbsp; In the
house that I live at now I have only had a few things happen to me
lately that I can remember and one of them was when I was blow drying
my hair in my parents room something would always fall in there and I
would have to get up and leave.&nbsp; Another thing that has happened
to me in this house is that one of my dad's friends stayed for a few
months at our house and my dad's friend and I were hanging out in the
living room talking when all of a sudden we heard form another room
close to the living room in the house a baby yawn and we both looked at
each other shocked and I got up off the couch and ran to that rom only
to find nothing.&nbsp; The strangest thing that has happened to me in
the house that I live at now was one night I had my cousin spend the
night and me and him were in my computer room and we were throwing a
ball back and forth to each other from both sides of the room and in
that room there is a fire place and in front of the fire place there is
a small statue of a deer standing up and anyways my cousin and I were
throwing a ball back and forth to each other when at the time we saw
two deer statues standing in front of the fire place and I threw the
ball back to my cousin and he didn't catch it and it bounced off him
and hit one of the deer and made the deer that was hit, turn and look
like it was sniffing the other deer's butt, and we both looked at each
other and started laughing and we both look back at the deer and one of
them was missing and we never could find it.&nbsp; Other smalls things
that have happened in this house is well some of them were in my
computer room and I would be back there sometimes and either it would
be freezing cold in there and there would be in the middle of the night
when I was back there a loud sound of what sounded like somewhere
hitting the side of the house and things would move around and shuffle
around in there.&nbsp; Well that was alot but this is all of the things
that have happened to me that I can remember at the moment and if
anything else happens to me or if I remember anything else I will be
sure to post some.<br>
