<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Haunted
House</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp; afterwrath@gmail.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
summer of 1996, I bought a large
home in nice, older neighborhood. My fianc&eacute; lived with her
parents at the time
since she was still in college, and I was living with my parents since
I had
just gotten out of the Army. We were really looking forward to getting
married
and having our own, private place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first night in the house felt very strange to me, but I chalked it
up to being a newlywed in a new home. As time went by, the strange
feelings did
not abate as I thought they would. I felt more and more apprehensive,
especially when I was in the house alone. The house made many strange
noises
when I was there by myself that it did not make while Sandy was home
with me. &nbsp;Also, I asked Sandy if she heard any strange
noises when she was there alone and she said she did not. I tried to
ignore the
noises and apprehension, but it was getting harder and harder to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After being in the house 6 months or so,
I began to hear footsteps at night coming from the upstairs. There were
just the
two of us in the house, and the bedrooms upstairs were only used for
storage.
The footsteps seemed to pace back and forth in the upstairs hallway.
Sandy
claimed she never heard any of the sounds and was calling me paranoid
and
crazy. At first, the footsteps were confined to the upstairs, but
eventually
they came downstairs and into our bedroom. Whatever was making the
footstep
noise would come up to my side of our bed and stand there for several
minutes
before walking (is walking the right word?) out of our room.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard
other strange noises in the
house like the sound of an animal growling and scratching noises in the
walls.
Someone (or something) knocked on our front door one morning at 3 am so
loud
that I thought the door was going to come off the hinges. Of course,
Sandy
never heard anything and accused me of trying to scare her. I began to
see
small, black humanoid figures darting in and out of the corner of my
vision.
They would shoot behind furniture or duck into rooms when I try to lay
my eyes
directly on them. I saw them during the day and night, and began to see
them
more and more often. I would get this odd feeling that someone was
behind me,
and if I quickly turned around, I could see one or more of those things
run
away. One day when I turned around to try and see the little black
things, I
saw a large, black thing at the other end of the hallway. It was about
6 feet
tall and though I could not make out any features, I could tell that it
was a
human shape under a cloak, and it did not run away. It just stood there
for
several seconds to let me get a good look at it and then it slowly
disappeared.
I saw that apparition several more times over the next few months,
always
standing some distance away and just looking at me. I was really
getting scared
and it came to the point that I did not want to go home at night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The experiences were taking a huge toll
on our marriage. Sandy would blame me for scaring her with reports of
things
that were not happening (in her mind) just to cause trouble in our
marriage.
She could not begin to conceive that I was truly scared and that
something was
really happening, even if she did not experience it. We stayed married
for a
total of 30 months before she moved out of the house and filed for
divorce. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here is
where the story gets even
stranger. The day she moved out of the house, the frequency and
intensity of
the experiences began to diminish. That night, the footsteps did not
come
downstairs like they always had in the past. I saw the large, black
apparition
only one time after she moved out and that time it was translucent, as
opposed
to being completely opaque as it had been before. It also did not stick
around
as before. Once I saw it, it vanished. Four months after she was gone,
all the
activity ceased. The house was quite and still and I no longer felt
that
apprehension I wrote about earlier. I have since remarried and we live
in the
same house with our children. I thought that the experiences might
return once
I brought my new wife into the house, but they did not; if they had, I
would
have sold the place. It had to be something associated with Sandy.
Maybe she
was into the occult or something. I spent plenty of nights with her in
her
parents&#8217; home (when they were away) before we were married and never
experienced anything like what happened in the house. Perhaps it the
combination of her and the house that was the problem, but I hope not.
If it
were, then that means the same thing could happen again, and I don&#8217;t
want my
family subjected to that.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Mildenhall
Village Suffolk County, England</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:
anonymous</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;While serving at RAF Mildenhall with
USAF
1993-1994 I lived with roommate from Santa Rosa, NM, named
"Greg."&nbsp; We both originally
lived in the dorms on base but got special permission from our First
Sergeants
to move off base together because we did not drink alcohol and drunken
parties
were a constant among our roommates and in the dorms in general 24
hours daily
as airmen worked three shifts.&nbsp; We were
both practical-minded Air Force aircraft mechanics with serious
responsibilities and not given to flights of fancy and had no previous
interest&nbsp; or experience in the paranormal
or occult.&nbsp; I simultaneously dated an
Englishman I would later marry named "Bill."&nbsp; The cottage only had
a coal fireplace for
heating; Greg did all he could to keep the coal stoked but the house
never
warmed and coal always died out quickly despite large piles of coal
Greg stoked
well often.&nbsp; The phone rang at various
hours day &amp; night with a loud, hissing static; there was a faint
but
unmistakable sound of someone whispering loudly through the static but
the
words were always unintelligible.&nbsp;&nbsp; Calls
to the operator to discover where the calls came from were answered
that we had
not received any phone calls at all during these events as far as the
phone
company was concerned.&nbsp; The calls simply
came from "nowhere."&nbsp; Greg
worked the night shift, I worked days.&nbsp;
Every night I heard heavy footsteps come up stairs to the bedroom
landing (4 sq. ft.) and back downstairs after varying lengths of pause.&nbsp;
When I was home at night these heavy
footsteps occasionally went into Greg's room; when he was at home he
heard the
steps enter my room a few times.&nbsp;
500-year-old wooden stairs creaked very loudly beneath thin carpet when
known humans were using them: the human footsteps could be heard
anywhere in
the cottage; these "phantom footsteps" were much, much louder and
projected a foreboding emotion to the roommate at home when they
occured.&nbsp; The rocking chair in the living room near fireplace
rocked of its own accord on a regular basis.&nbsp;
Once both Greg and I were simultaneously "TDY" or assigned
"temporary duty" to separate bases for a few months.&nbsp; We locked
the cottage down tight as a
drum.&nbsp; A friend agreed to check the place
from time to time but as all doors and windows remained locked he never
went
inside.&nbsp; I returned before Greg did.&nbsp; Every object in the
kitchen that could be
moved - such as cutlery, dishes, pots &amp; pans, bread bins,
knick-knacks,
whatever - were taken by "someone" and all dumped in the middle of
the living room floor.&nbsp; Nothing was
missing, it was simply transported to the middle of the living room and
unceremoniously dumped there.&nbsp; At other
times I was TDY and Greg experienced occurences more often and more
intensely,
for him, when I was gone.&nbsp; However, his
worst experience happened unbeknownst to me while I was deep inside the
cottage.&nbsp; One night as Greg went out to
his car to go on duty he saw what are sometimes called a "shadow
figure," but in much more detail.&nbsp; Greg
was not bothered by the unexplainable occurences in the cottage until
he met
this thing.&nbsp; It was blacker than black,
the outline of a large adult male, about 6 1/2 feet tall be his
estimation, no
facial or other features except glowing eyes that looked at Greg in
such an
"evil way" Greg said he was "scared to death"&nbsp; - he claimed
without hearing a sound that
this thing was unmistakably evil and had ill-intentions, to say the
least.&nbsp;&nbsp; Greg got in his car (a TRuE British yellow
"mini") and sped away as soon as he could.&nbsp; There is a broken-down
shed directly behind
the house in the backyard.&nbsp; Both Greg
&amp; I looked into it from time to time but refused to enter until one
day we
agreed to go in together.&nbsp; We both
experienced an unexplained strong sense of being watched from up close
though
no one else was on the property.&nbsp; The
sensation, we both agreed at the time, was an evil one.&nbsp; We both
thought we heard heavy breathing, but
neither of us wanted to jump to conclusion and appear to the other to
be easily
"duped" by what we could not explain.&nbsp;
There is a storage area on the side of the house that cannot be
accessed
from inside the house; only by the door outside the storage area
attached to
the side of&nbsp; the cottage.&nbsp; Greg and I both hardly dared look
inside after
our first time inspecting the property; there were no electrical lights
in the
room, there was junk and building materials scattered around as if
someone
dumped everything from the ceiling, and materials "changed positions"
from time to time.&nbsp; Occasionally the taps
(faucets) in the bathroom upstairs turned on and off of its own accord,
yet
both hot &amp; cold tap levers were always in the "off"
position.&nbsp; Every unexplained occurence
was of an extremely strongly sensed nature - it always got our
attention.&nbsp; Except for the static phone calls and the
chair rocking itself, most activity took place when there was only one
roommate
in the cottage.&nbsp; Neither Greg nor I had
ever experienced anything paranormal before, at least he had not
anything to
this degree, and of the photos taken inside &amp; outside the cottage
there is
nothing remarkable: no orbs, light streaks, vortices, apparitions, etc.&nbsp;
The Englishman I was dating and later married
was a complete skeptic but strongly disliked being in this cottage; he
would only
state "something is wrong with this house; something strange about
it."&nbsp; For his degree of skepticism
that was quite a statement in itself.&nbsp;
When a man with a young teenage girl moved into the other side of this
duplex cottage, Greg &amp; I decided to warn her without giving
anything
specific away about the occurences so we weren't planting suggestions
in her
mind, knowing teenagers are very impressionable.&nbsp; We simply
welcomed her, made chit-chat, then
told her when she was alone if she was ever uncomfortable or frightened
she
could come over to us anytime.&nbsp; Less than
a month later she came over extremely frightened, telling us she was in
her
bedroom alone when she audibly heard a voice call out her name.&nbsp;
She had no history of hallucinations, swore
she did not mistake it for a conversation she heard through the walls
(which
would not have occurred for that night Greg was on duty at the base)
and that
the voice was male, not matching Greg or myself.&nbsp; Shotly after
this I moved in with my fiance
in a nearby town - largely to get away from the occurences - and soon
lost
touch with Greg.&nbsp; The paranormal
occurences in this cottage were constant, in one form or another, and
experienced intensely.&nbsp; It carried a
heavy pall of fear or, at times, dread or terror everywhere in the
cottage that
never, ever left - never anything that could be called benign or
benevolent.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A
Ghost named "Glenda" (also known to older sisters as
"Sally") resides there and only haunts the sisters who live in the
house, mostly upon their first few weeks of moving in. Glenda steals
bras and
other personal items, turns light switch off while girls are showering,
makes
the faucet drip while using the bathroom (starts slow then gets faster
even
after checking to make sure it is completely off), makes every thing
sway back
and forth (clothes in closet, desks, lamps, anything hanging) in a
certain bedroom
on the 2nd floor especially when trying to study. I have had personal
experience with all of these things. One night during our first week
there, we
heard kissing noises in the middle of the night and my roommate saw an
orb in
the corner of our room. Glenda has her "own room" under the stairs
that the sisters have designated for her. Glenda is a playful spirit
who will
stop what she is doing if you acknowledge her and ask her to please
stop
because it is freaking you out and to go to her room. Every new sister
who
moves in the house is informed of Glenda and that she is part of the
family.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I'd
like to share a recent hauting I've experienced. I unfortunately don't
have any
EVP or photos, seeing as most of these experiences have happened when I
wasn't
prepared to face them and capture proof. &nbsp;For starters, I have to
say that I've lived on
a farm until recently with my boyfriend. The farm buildings date until
before
his grandfather's time, who was the one to purchase them and turn them
into a
family buisness of dairy cows. Now, the creepy things is he purchased
them from
a man who had just hung himself in the &nbsp;barn
and set fire to it (the building was saved and the good wood was
re-used to
build a fresher barn) because he owed money to the village's loaner.
Seeing as
he was unable to repay the man and in dept above his ears, he decided
to end
his life and destroy the place. &nbsp;My
boyfriend' mom called shamans to the property a couple years back and
they
confirmed the presence of &nbsp;three ghosts,
one of which being the hung man, another an uncle of my boyfriend's who
died by
accident and a third unidentified being. The one I have 'experienced'
(because
I believe to have been confronted by one being alone) I believe to be
the hung
man. Here are a list of things I have experienced at the barn: -while
letting
my dogs outside of the barn at night and staying alone to prepare their
food
bowls I have often heard loud, boot-like footsteps above me, where the
straw
and hay is kept. It was far too late for anyone to be in the barn
(epecially in
the hay section) and the sounds were very distinct, lasting several
seconds,
before vanishing. &nbsp;-caring for the cows
early in the morning, (I am the first to arrive in the barn at 6am) I
often
saw, out of the corner of my eye, a very big man appearing out of this
air near
a door and walking through it, sometimes peaking from around the cornor
as if
to check if I was looking. When i would go to investigate, the corner
where he
would have been standing to peak from was full of ladders. There was no
way for
someone to hide in that corner. &nbsp;- creepy
feelings of being watched. Now I know those may sound clich&eacute;,
but the scary
things is that they would occur just before I started dating my
boyfriend, a
couple years back and BEFORE he told me about there being ghosts in the
barn. &nbsp;Now, I've recently moved to a house about
40min from my boyfriend's and I believe one of the ghosts followed me.
Here is
what has happened just days ago: I was watching TV with my dogs when
one of
them (a big rottweiler) got up and walked to the wooden cabinet the TV
is on.
That cabinet was two glass doors on either side of the TV that close
with that
push-magnet thing and they have a bunch of DVDs inside. Now, as my dogs
nears
the glass door, it suddenly swings open with enough force to loudly
bang
aganist the TV. My dog jumps back and runs off, scared, but I figure it
probably nudged the door and the magnet released it. However, several
minutes
later, when I got up to close it, I realised that the bottom part of
the door
would jam against a ledge and I would have to apply force to actually
close it.
Worst than that, even when it was closed and I would push on it for the
magnet
to release it, it would jam again against the ledge and even once free,
if I
pushed it open harshly, it would very slowly swing open. Not once did
it manage
to bang against the TV. And just yesterday, watching the TV again, my
other dog
(a boxer) walked over to the other glass door and before he reached it,
I saw
the door apparently attempt to open, although it jammed in the same way
its
opposite did. My boxer immediately stepped back and retreated with VERY
alarmed
glances. &nbsp;My dogs also have a tendency to
stop and stare at fix points in the house, sometimes following
something
invisible as though it was walking around. My boxer being more
protective than
my rottie, he sometimes growls lowly at something neaby, although I
can't see
anything. These ghosts apparently don't want to hurt me, but at time I
wonder
if it might be a good idea to try and communicate with them and see
what they
want... althought I must admit I'm frightened at provocking them.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The
survivors of the OLA fire, got together and had a memorial statute made
to
honor their dead classmates. It was in the New OLA school when it was
sold
and&nbsp; taken over by a non-sectarian group.
The students there descrated the memorial that was in the school. It
was taken
out of the school , restored and placed into Holy Family Church.
Whether this
has any bearing on the "haunt" at Holy Family Church, I can't say.
But I didn't know if you knew this or not.&nbsp;
I was 7 when that fire happened, I went to Our Lady Help of Christians
grammar school. Which was 1 block north of Chicago Ave. on Leamington
Ave. The
fire made a lasting memory for me , even though I didn't attend OLA. Be
that as
it may. I buried it for almost 20 yrs.&nbsp; Something
that would creep alot of people out, was I went to Forest Hill Cemetery
in Glen
Ellyn, on St. Charles Rd. A few days after my visit, my 4 yr. son at
the time,
1988, came to me and said that he had a boy who came to play with him
at night.
He told me that the boy looked like him and his name was like Jason,
but was
not. The little boy liked football and he wanted to play. Now I went
back to
Forest Hill, and found the grave of Justin Egan. He was 8 yrs.old when
he died
and they had a picture of the child at the gravesite. My son and Justin
were so
alike , they could have been twins ! &nbsp;Also
there was a statue of a boy in foorball attire on the grave. As my son
grew
older, he did not retain any memory of Justin. Justin came to visit him
for
about a week. Justin died of a congenital heart defect. At the time ,
there was
alot of grief at the gravesite. I haven't been there in many years.&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Similar
to Dave's Story </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
 href="mailto:nswaldron@att.net">nswaldron@att.net</a> </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I'm
writing you to tell my story. I was reading Dave's story and it's so
close to
the experience that I had that it actually gave me chills. &nbsp;My
first paranormal experience happened when I
was 4 yrs old. All the experts say that things that happen to someone
before
the age of 5 is very hard to remember. The funny thing is that I can
remember
my experience like it was yesterday. My mother, sister (who's 3 yrs
younger
than me), and myself. I remember being asleep in my bed and waking up
very
suddenly. I looked at the door way and I say this full bodied figure,
the only
thing is that it was completely white. I'm not talking like white like
a white
wall, I'm talking white like energy. This figure to me was a child. the
reason
I believe this is actually because of it's height, I mean it did not
have a
face or anything like that. It walked toward me and got on my bed. I
remember
pulling the blanket up over my head because I was so scared, but I
actually
felt it on the bed. At that point I ran screaming and crying into my
mom's
room. Her boyfriend got up and walked me back to bed to show me there
was nothing
to be scared of. when we got there it was gone. Now lets fast forward
to the
age of 17. By this time in my life my mom had gotten married, not the
same guy
from when I was 4, and they had bought a house. It was a tri-level with
a full
finished basement and a sub basement. From day one something felt very
odd in
the house, almost like a very </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>heavy,
unwelcome feeling. The sub basement was probably the strangest. when
you would
walk in there you could see spray paint all over the walls. I know
that's not
strange, but when you stood in the center of the room you could seen
that the
spray paint actually was covering up what looked like writing on the
walls, and
it was also on the floor. So that was kinda creepy. We had two dogs
that both
refused to go into my room and constantly would either stair at the
wall and
bark or would stand at the stairs and bark up to the second floor or
down the
stairs to the basement. The longer I lived in the house, the more I
began to
feel, almost alone. It was like I was becoming isolated mentally from
everything. In my room it would constantly feel as if I was being
watched, I
would hear loud bangs and things sounding like they were hitting the
floor but
nothing would be around. All the motion sensor lights around the
outside of the
house would turn on all at once for no reason. I mean I actually began
to think
I was going crazy. Finally I broke down and told my step dad everything
that
had been going on. He looked at me very seriously, I remember thinking
"
oh crap, he thinks I'm nuts". He began to tell me about how one night
after he had gotten home from work, he worked second shift and didn't
get home
till around 1 am, we was sitting on the computer playing a game. At the
time
our computer was in the front room and you could see right up the
stairs and
onto the landing where the bed rooms were. He said he saw a man walk
out of my
room. The man he saw was a taller man in a pair of jeans and a flannel
shirt.
At first he said he thought it was me, because he only saw the man out
of the
corner of his eye. But then he asked how I was doing and looked up and
realized
the man wasn't me. The man turned and walked back into my room. My step
dad ran
up the stairs and opened my door and I was the only one in there and I
was
asleep, in a pair of boxers. After my step dad told me this I was
convinced
something was going on. One weekend while my parents were out of town I
invited
2 of my friends over so we could try to catch stuff on film. Of course
we got
nothing. That is until we tried to go to sleep. We had all decided to
sleep in
the basement because there was more room there. we turned off the
lights and
started to go to sleep. My one friend, Chris, was already asleep and
myself and
Dave were talking. All of a sudden the light to the sub basement turned
on and
we could see what looked like a shadow under the door. you could
actually hear
what sounded like work boots walking up the wooden stairs. We woke up
Chris and
we all stood at the door. We really thought someone had broke into the
house.
We opened up the door, prepared to beat the crap out of someone, and
the was no
one there. We walked downstairs and looked around, we check the windows
and
everything. The windows were shut and locked and no one was there.
There are a
lot more things that happened but It would be like writing a novel to
tell them
all. I just thought it was kinda creepy how similar my story is to
Dave's.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My
Ghost Story - Easton, PA</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; th1928@gmail.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I
am not sure really where to start, but recently I have moved and for
some
reason I keep thinking about the odd experiences I had at the old place
I used
to rent. I recently moved from Easton, Pennsylvania, where I used to
rent an
old townhouse type of place. The landlord told my roommate and I that
they
place was from the 1900s, but he re-did it and fixed up a lot of the
issues
that needed to be addressed. However, if I knew about the weird
experiences I
was about to encounter I probably wouldn&#8217;t have moved into that place.
Our
landlord and his girlfriend never expressed anything strange or
abnormal about
the house, but as soon as I moved in was when everything seemed to
start. &nbsp;&nbsp;I first started noticing things when I would
hear people talking and low voices at night, but I just thought it was
the
neighbors or people outside. So I ignored those things for a long time.
&nbsp;Eventually, the instances became more
distinct, such as at night I would hear someone walking down the hall.
Heavy
footsteps would be walking either down the hall from my bedroom to the
bathroom
or I would hear footsteps in the attic above my room. My roommate said
she
never heard the footsteps, so I just started to ignore what I heard at
night.
It wasn&#8217;t until later I heard the footsteps and saw shadows under my
door. I
saw someone walking down the hall from the gap under my door. I could
honestly
say I was freaked out, but I remained calm and opened the door to see
if
someone was there. No one was in the hall and my roommate&#8217;s door was
closed
with the lights off. I walked down the hall to her room and went in to
ask if
she was walking around&#8230; she said no and that she was in bed. After that
night
the footsteps and seeing the foot shadows was a regular occurrence. A
few
months later was when my roommate actually started believing me that
someone or
something was in the house. My roommate, a friend of ours and myself
were
watching a movie. I was sitting with my roommate on a big chair, while
our
friend sat on another chair. I had my head resting on the back and all
of a
sudden something hit the back of my head and pushed it forward. My
roommate
looked at me wide-eyed and asked what that was. I had no way of
explaining the
situation besides the fact that something felt the need to hit my head
and make
me aware that it was in the house. The footsteps each night still
continued to
happen as well. It wasn&#8217;t until I started dating my boyfriend when
things
started to get even more intense. Whenever I tried taking a nap after
work I
would hear children running in the attic &#8211; the steps were small and I
could
hear light sounds of children laughing. It seemed like they were
playing a game
or something. I only heard them two times before that disappeared and
everything got calm and quiet again. The footsteps were no longer in
the hall
and the house was finally still. However, the activity really
intensified when
my boyfriend moved into our house. After that point was when I started
to get
really paranoid about the situation of the noises.. For awhile the only
things
that happened were just noises or I noticed things were out of place in
the
morning and I asked everyone in the house and no one moved what was
misplaced.
That mainly happened up until the late spring. The real weird stuff
happened
after a little boy was hit by a bus in Easton (the article can be found
on
lehighvalleylive.com). He was riding a bike and flew out in front of a
bus and
was killed instantly. That night I was getting ready for bed and my
roommate
and I were talking before I went to sleep. When she left my room, I
turned the
lights off and started to fall asleep, but wasn&#8217;t in that deep sleep
yet. I
started to hear something tapping on the floor in my room, so I sat up
and
looked around to see what the noise was. It stopped and I thought I
must have
imagined it. So again I laid back down and just got ready to fall into
a deep
sleep when the tapping noise started again and I sat up to look around.
It
stopped. This continued one more time and I became very freaked out and
ran
down the hall to get my roommate. She came into my room and turned on
the light
and my room was messed up. Bags were toppled over and the contents all
over the
one half of my room. We both looked at each other and knew that my room
did not
look like that before I went to sleep. After that night I started to
get really
weird nightmares and became very scared to sleep in my room by myself,
so I
moved up to the attic where my boyfriend resided. I felt better and
things
seemed to calm down again. Later in the </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>summer
I was in a car accident and the activity started up again. At this
point our
lease was about over, we actually had two more weeks left in the house.
This
point in time I still think about. After the accident I was on some
pain
medication for my knee but I could still hear and think very clearly.
At night
I started to feel someone sitting on the edge of my bed and I would
hear
footsteps and whispers. When I would go to the bathroom in the middle
of the
night I felt someone staring at me from my old room down the hall.
Whatever was
there by this point I felt wasn&#8217;t very friendly&#8230; I was actually
terrified for
some reason and had an odd sense of something wasn&#8217;t right. The last
thing I
remember when I was there is the most disturbing to me. I am still
scared of
what I saw to this day. It was a week after my accident and a week
before we were
getting ready to move out. It was pretty late at night and I just got
done
going to the bathroom and laid down to fall back to sleep. I was in
that period
of where you aren&#8217;t fully asleep but you aren&#8217;t wake either and that is
when I
started to feel weird things. I felt something touching or caressing my
face. I
brushed my hand over my face and rolled over to fall back to sleep, but
I felt
something brush my face again and something slowly pulling the covers
off of
me. Then whatever it was started talking to me, but I can&#8217;t recall what
it
said, but I know it scared me pretty decently because I jerked awake
and looked
up and saw a dark, tall shadow beside my bed. I screamed my boyfriend&#8217;s
name
and when I looked back at the shadow it was gone. I got up and turned a
light
one and everything was as it was when I went to sleep before. I crawled
back
into bed and fell asleep, however, the next morning I just felt really
strange
and have been really freaked out ever since. I know whatever was
talking to me
and revealed itself wasn&#8217;t friendly; it wasn&#8217;t horrible either, but it
definitely didn&#8217;t like us being in that house. &nbsp;The day of us
moving out was when my boyfriend
finally revealed all of his instances that happened. Throughout the
entire time
we lived there I told him all the happenings and he just shrugged them
off. He
never told me what he experienced because he knew I would be very upset
and
scared to continue to live there. He said the entire time he was in the
house
he also felt something sitting on the edge of the bed; or he would wake
up
afraid and would try to sit up and couldn&#8217;t because it felt like
something was
holding him down; and he also felt pressure on his chest, like someone
was
holding him down, to the point he couldn&#8217;t breathe. Ever since I moved
I
haven&#8217;t experienced anything strange happening, so I definitely believe
our
house in Easton, PA was haunted. It may seem strange or that I am
telling a
fib, but I can whole- heartedly say that all the instances I described
truly
happened. I felt the need to write about them so maybe someone could
explain
it. I am a very superstitious person and I highly believe in paranormal
activity, but I never thought something that intense would happen to
me.
However, it &nbsp;did and to this day I am
very unnerved about the situation I experienced.&nbsp; </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In
the house I spent most of my childhood in, there were a number of
incidents.
There were 4 big things I have seen or heard in the house other than
hearing
footsteps in the hall and having just an over all creepy feeling. The
house I
grew up in is in Beaverton, OR near Greenway Elementary School. In
fact, the
school was right outside my backyard on the other side of a small
creek. The
first major incident was when I was about 6 or 7. It was light at night
and I
was having trouble getting to sleep. Back then, whenever I had trouble
sleeping, I would stare at the window just past the foot of my bed and
watch
the lights from passing cars go by. Even though we had a tall fence,
you could
still see the light. After a few cars went by, I started to drift to
sleep.
Then I saw something odd. It was a shadow in the middle of my window
cast by
the passing cars. Another car went by and I could tell what the shadow
was of.
It was a human figure. Now I was wide awake. More cars went by and it
was still
there. What scared me the most was the fact that I could see the whole
body
except for a small portion of the feet cut off by the bottom of the
&nbsp;window. But this shouldn't have been possible
as the window stood 3-4 feet off the ground. It was then that a scary
thought
popped into my little head - someone was hung from the old oak tree in
my back
yard! I freaked out and did what many kids do when they are afraid, I
pulled
the blanket over my head and closed my eyes till I passed out. I went
into the
backyard that morning before school to see if there was anything there.
There
wasn't much grass in our back yard, mostly mud. Since it was wet, no
one would have
been able to get back there without leaving footprints or some kind of
sign.
When I checked, there was nothing. Nothing in the tree, nothing on the
roof,
and no signs in the mud of anyone being in the yard that night.&nbsp;
The next sighting was a frequent one. Myself
as well as other member of my family (there was myself, mom, dad, and 3
younger
brothers) had seen a black cat. We didn't own a cat, but we had one. He
would
often look at you, then run down the hall and jump right through the
wall. You
cant really play with a ghost cat, or pet it, but it was still fun
having him.
Although I don't think the dog was too happy about it...Later on, in my
high
school years, I began to notice something else. When I walked home from
school,
I always had my headphones on and the music was turned up so loud I
couldn't
even hear the traffic around me. However, even with the music blaring,
when I
got home I would always hear the sound of a little girl giggling. It
would
startle me and I would rip off my headphones to the sound of nothing.
After
putting them back on, I would hear it again. I never was able to tell
where it
was coming from. A number of time I had rushed to the back yard and
looked over
the fence to see if the Elementary school kids were out playing, but no
one was
there. After a while I had gotten used to it and had said hello to the
disembodied voice a few times. The last major incident happened around
2003 I
believe. I was in my room playing Mario Kart 64 with a friend of mine
when one
of my little brothers &nbsp;came running into
my room. He said there was someone tapping on his window. My little
brothers'
room was right next to mine, and I hadn't heard anything so I sent him
away. He
came back a few more times and I was losing patience. I finally went
and looked.
I peeked out his window (he had the blinds shut) and stood in his room
for a
few minutes. I heard and saw nothing, so I went back to my room. As
soon as we
got the game unpaused, my little brother was back. I was fed up with it
so I
said I would check it out one more time and that was it. I stood in his
doorway
for a few minutes and was ready to call it quits. &nbsp;As soon as I
turned I heard it. It was a
series of 3 taps. I waited, then I heard it again. Before I go further,
let me
explain what lies beyond the window. There was only a very small space
next to
the window. We had a large trampoline in the back yard that cut off
most of the
space by my brothers' window. On the other side is the fence separating
our
back yard from the yard next door. I went up to the window and placed
my hand
on the blinds. As soon as I heard the taps again, I opened the blinds
to look.
Nothing was there. I told my dad what was happening and he stood at the
end of
the hall ready to run. I stood in the doorway again listening. As soon
as I
heard it, I signaled my dad and he took off fast. There was no way
someone
could have gotten away crawling under the trampoline or hopping the
fence
before he got there. And there is no way to get over the trampoline and
its
rusty springs without making a lot of noise. But there was no noise,
and no one
there.</big></p>
