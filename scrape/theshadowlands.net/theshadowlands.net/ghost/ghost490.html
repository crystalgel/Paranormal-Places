<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A
Haunting in Plover Wisconsin</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>There
is an old bed and breakfast at the end of post road where it turns into
highway
54. It is said to be haunted by multiple spirits. People staying at the
house
would often complain of noises or seeing strangers in their rooms at
night. A
pastor did an cleansing of the building and although it worked for a
short time
the spirits returned. It has sense been closed and abandoned. Its been
for sale
for years. It has switched owners numerous times in hopes of creating
new
business but to no success. More recently, in the summer of 2008 two
teenage
boys visited the house at midnight. One of the doors was surprisingly
unlocked
so they went inside and explored the lower level. Suddenly they turned
around
and a figure with glowing eyes was staring at them. They run as fast as
they
could up the stairs and out. While they were biking home they crossed a
railroad track and as they looked to the right they saw the two glowing
eyes
staring at them again. Even thought it is abandoned when you visit you
will
notice blinds will be down one day but when you come back the next day
they
will be open.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Was
driving from Gouverneur, NY to Salmon Run Mall. I took Rt.11 then onto
Rt.81,
which will take you straight through to the mall. There was a right
turn coming
up and I took it thinking it was the right turn to the mall. It was an
unfamiliar street, I took the next right into a residential area then
turn
around in the first right sided driveway I saw. I came out the same way
I went
in and was on "MILL STREET"! I was on the other side of the city in a
matter a a few turns that took about 3 minutes! I was on Mill St.
facing the
square.&nbsp; I had to follow Arsenal St. all
the way to the mall. This distance usually takes about 20-30 minutes.
Much later,
I tried to locate the wrong turn I took off Rt.81.....I couldn't find
one on
the map! So, where did I turn and how did I get across the city so fast?&nbsp;
I never told this to anyone because they'd
say I either went into Watertown on Mill St. (which I </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>never
used) or I was crazy.&nbsp; I often wondered
if I hit a vortex or a worm hole.&nbsp; It was
a very strange experience.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I
believe in ghost have since I was a girl. But my husband never has. He
does
now. When my son was 4 I took him to the doctor for a check up while I
was gone
he retired to his work shop in the basement he said he heard someone
open the
door which was locked walk from room to room ending in the bedroom
thinking
someone had came in he returned finding no one. Upon telling me this he
admitted it spooked him I told him I hear this walking often brushing
this
aside, during our weekly card night a shelf came lose from our bedroom
wall
flew halfway across the room landing in the middle of our bed ,he
brushed this
off also. Mid July our house turned into a walk in freezer and the
scent of
many different flowers filled our home for 5 minutes, so he says okay
that&#8217;s
odd but it proves nothing items started going missing small things like
tools
knife's my favorite earrings a gold lip liner pen he brushed this aside
saying
I had just misplaced </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>them
then when I started working night shift he had went to bed as all ways
he
turned onto his left side he said his hair fell across his face he said
something with icy fingers brushed back the hair from his face he said
he
jumped from bed and ran I found him sitting on the couch the next
morning where
he had been all night to afraid to go back to bed. He said now I
believe. For
my birthday he bought me a lamp with the guardian angel on it, at
around 8 pm
each night this lamp comes on we turn it off it comes back on after a
few days
of restless sleep he broke down and said if it didn&#8217;t stop he was going
to
throw it out into the yard a week went by before it came back on yes we
have this
lamp on the night stand yet. Each night when we go to bed we can feel
something
sit down on the bed at our feet&nbsp; no pets
in the house my cat use to stay in at nights but one night she was in
the bed
room with me the cat jumped up starting hissing every hair she had was
standing
on ends she was looking at the foot of the bed she hissed once more
leapt
across the room running to the front door and started clawing trying to
get out
it was 10 days before she would come back into the house avoiding the
bed room
wanting out before I went to bed we can see an imprint where something
sat
down. Our son now 27 will not lay down and sleep with out a light on
says he
hears things and if something was going to slip upon him he wanted to
be able
to see it. Many times when I have been down I have felt an icy hand
touch me on
my shoulder as if saying its alright&nbsp; I'm
hear for you it's got to the point where I talk to it like I would any
other
person we all have come use to this being if it was going to harm us it
would
of done so long before now its been with us for 12 years now. Now my
husband is
a believer and when he hears someone say they don&#8217;t he tells this story
some
believe because they have seen for themselves.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Potter's
Field</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
medic5329@optonline.net</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp; I am a member of a paranormal group
and
recently we started going to cemeteries to see what is happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We have had a lot of experiences mosty good
but some strange and he most strange seem to be in a Potter's Field.&nbsp;
Potter's Fileds&nbsp; are the final resting place of people that
are forgotten, poor or just mentally unstable.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The name comes from the Bible.&nbsp;
When Judas betrayed Christ he was give 30 pieces of silver .&nbsp;
Having realized what an aweful thing he did
he threw the money back to the priest nd went and hung himself.&nbsp;
The Jewish leaders used the money to buy a
field to bury him and ohers and to this day they call them potter's
field.&nbsp;&nbsp; The one I refer was associated with an
Almshouse or a poor house that held the indebted, the elderly, the
sick, a lot
of the psychologiucal and neurological diseased we know about today
were
considered insane and petty criminals.&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is a cemetery associated witt he house that </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>has
1000 stones in one area and 13 in another.&nbsp;
Theswe are tiny numbered stones, no numbers or any detail just a number.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We were told it is haunted so we went to
investigate and by the end of the night we knew it was not the cemetery
but the
side woods that are haunted.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got a
feeling and was drawn to the far corner and as I got there I felt very
very sad
.&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned and saw a girl of about 12
or 13. dressed in the clothes of the late 1700s or early 1800s.&nbsp; A
bonnet, white apron red and white dress was
what seh wore.&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw her and the
sadness got worse then suddenly she left.&nbsp;
I looked &nbsp;to the left an there she
wa about 10 feet further away so I walked up to her and said not to be
afraid
but as I approached she left again.&nbsp; This
happened 3 or 4 times till I got to the front corner and then I saw a
mist form
right in front of me and as it evaporated she was gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We had a psychic with us and he said she
can not talk tous because someone is telling her to shut up and we all
heard
a&nbsp; "Shhhh!" every time we asked
her a question.&nbsp; Before this we heard a
young woman's voice say "Don't hurt me" .&nbsp;&nbsp; One of our group
had a Digital voice
recorder running and as we left you hear a young girld say "Listen
daddy..
Joe is leaving...Yeah"&nbsp; and the
psychic is named Joe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A week later I
went again with different people and again she showed herllef to me and
everyone felt the sorrow.&nbsp; One of our
people left a teddy bear forher and I found it on the floor so I picked
it up
and showed it to her telling her it is hers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I tucked it into a fence post so it would not be eassy to fall nor
eaasily seen by kids but she kenw.&nbsp; As I did
this I heard a slight voice saying&nbsp;
"Thank You" unfortunately it didn't record.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Alos while there the last time I was on
the outsaide way away from the otehrs then I walked over and I was
taliking to
one&nbsp; of our guys.&nbsp; Another guy asked where I was yet I was
right
next to him.&nbsp; The first guy said he was
talking to me for a couple of minutes yet he saw me standing at the far
side of
the cemetery.&nbsp; A dark figure my size.&nbsp; He was stunned that I
was back and he hadn't
seen me but more so he saw me there just as I was talking to the other
guy.&nbsp; I am going back with my son who is
13 about the age of the girl and we are going to see if they want to
play or
talk to him.&nbsp; We used my son in another
experiment with a ball trying to get a spirit to play and the ball
actually
started to vibrqate as if squeezed by a hand unseen.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Personal
Experience</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
greatone187@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Here's
a couple things that happened to me when I was younger. It was in the
early
90's at a house in California.&nbsp; When I
was between 5 and 8 I had experiences in a house in California. One
night when
I was 5, my mom put me to bed in my room. I was laying so I could see
in the
middle of the room. I wasn't in there very long when this huge scary
face with
glowing red eyes appeared and screamed at me really loud and scarily
but only I
heard it. I screamed and my parents came in. So they made my sisters
switch
rooms with me. Then everyday until I was 8, in my new room, I had this
chair
that I would sit in after I went to bed. I'd stare at the window which
had the
moonlight on it. Every time I sat in that chair I'd see a shadow of
someone
move across the window and they had a gun. If I looked at it long
enough it
would turn towards me with the gun. I'd close my eyes and it would
happen again
a few seconds after I open eyes. It stopped when I turned 8. Neither of
my
sisters or my parents ever had a ghostly experience in that house.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>One
Terrifying Fall Night</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
athenarusso@verizon.net</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I
previously sent a story titled "My 1st Haunting" which gives the
story of my first sighting of the ghost.&nbsp;
This story happened about 7-8 years later in a newly built house, which
was 1/2 block down from the old house.&nbsp;
It seems my ghost followed me here.&nbsp;
Anyways, here's the story:One fall night, while I was a freshman in
high
school, my mother and father went out for the evening and I was
babysitting my
sister.&nbsp; I was on the phone for quite a
while talking to my boyfriend, when my dog started barking by the
downstairs
door, letting me know she wanted to go outside.&nbsp;
I need to give a little description on how my house was laid out.&nbsp;
My house was a bi-level and to put the dog
outside on the chain to do her &#8220;business&#8221; you have to go down the
stairs into
the basement (there&#8217;s a door to get into the basement) (this part is
the den),
then out through another basement door (which is the garage part of the
basement), and then out another basement door, which would take you
outside.So
anyway, I went down through all the doors and put my dog on the chain,
which is
right outside the basement (outside) door.&nbsp;
After that. I distinctly remembered that I locked that door, and the
door leading into the den part of the basement, then locked the sliding
glass
door in that room, then went upstairs and locked the door behind me
(the one
leading from the basement to the upstairs).&nbsp;
Also during that course of time I checked that all the windows were
locked upstairs and downstairs, which they were (I&#8217;ve always been a
little
obsessive-compulsive when it comes to that).&nbsp;
About 20 minutes later and still on the phone with my boyfriend, I
heard
my dog barking outside, but was too lazy to run downstairs to get her.&nbsp;
A few minutes later I heard her growling, but
again figured she had just seen a rabbit or deer or something like that
outside.&nbsp; Then about 20 seconds later I
heard something downstairs in the basement.&nbsp;
(When you are in my upstairs living room, and it is dark out, (and the
light is on in the stairway) you can look into the living room picture
window
and it reflects the image of the steps leading down to the basement).&nbsp;
So as I am still on the phone I see my dog
running up the steps through the reflection in the window.&nbsp; I
figured my parents were home so I went into
the kitchen and looked out the window to the driveway but there was no
car
there.&nbsp; I then noticed my dog had
something around her neck, which was the collar and part of the chain
that we
put her on to go outside (about a foot of it).&nbsp;
She was also acting really strange, jumping around me and barking and
stuff.&nbsp; So suffice to say, I was
petrified!&nbsp; I then heard some sort of
smashing glass downstairs in the basement and grabbed the phone (and a
knife) and
the dog and ran into the room where my sister was sleeping and closed
and
locked the door.&nbsp; I then went to tell my
boyfriend (who was on the phone through all of this) to call the police
&#8211; but
when I picked it up no one was on the phone.&nbsp;
So I clicked over to the dial tone and went to dial I could here all
these weird sounds on the phone, like voices mumbling &#8211; well since it
was a
portable phone I figured it was some interference, so I used the
regular phone
in mine and my sisters room to try to call someone but the same thing
happened
with the mumbling voices.&nbsp; Throughout the
time my dog is hysterical.&nbsp; This went on
for about 1 hour.&nbsp; All the time hearing
footsteps, doors closing, sounds directly beneath the bedroom in the
basement,
and bumps against the bedroom door.&nbsp; As
you could imagine, I wasn&#8217;t about to open the bedroom door to get out
of the
house.&nbsp; After the hour passed, I didn&#8217;t
hear anything else but still the same thing for the phone.&nbsp;
Finally I heard footsteps again and can
recognize my mothers frantic yell and can hear my father calling out
our
names.&nbsp; So when they came to the bedroom
door I opened it (once I knew for certain it was them).&nbsp; And my
mother was completely pale and
obviously shaken.&nbsp; She asked me why all
the doors in the house were wide open (even the screen doors were wide
open &#8211;
you know when you push that thing over to keep the screen from closing)
and all
the windows in the house were in the up position.&nbsp; When we went
downstairs there was no broken
glass like I had heard.&nbsp; I told them what
happened, but then after that day my mom told me not to talk about it
anymore.&nbsp; I think &#8220;it&#8221; scared the life
out of her too.This is one story of many that happened in this house
and in a
previous house throughout my childhood.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ohio
Wesleyan's Haunted Library Beeghly&#8217;s Library Ghosts</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
darkknightjc_007@msn.com&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp; The first library in the city
Delaware,
Ohio, was located at the Mansion House. The facility only carried 700
volumes
of outdated textbooks. The need for new books was determined by the
increasing
enrollment of students at the new university. In 1853, William Sturges
from
Putnam, Ohio, offered up to $10,000 for upgraded books with an
additional
$15,000 to be given in the construction of the library. In October of
1855, the
Sturges Library was built on the classical style of the Doric order.
The Doric
order was only one of three ancient orders of Greek architecture. The
other two
were the Ionic and Corinthian. In the classical version of the Doric
order, the
pillars were firmly implanted on a flat surface and the pillars or
shafts rose
to a square abacus intersecting a wooden or concrete horizontal beam.
This
style highly suggests a seriousness of purpose and incorruptibility;
the Doric
is quite appropriate for any library or university building of public
service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four floors of the library
consisted of library shelves recessed into separated rooms enclosed by
fashionable iron railing. The library was built on the alcove plan. In
1854,
Dr. Edward Thomson, president of the university, travelled throughout
Europe to
purchase more books, but his stay was cut short due to an epidemic
affecting
the European continent. What seemed odd about the library was the
prohibition
of using these books for study and research purposes. This did not set
too well
with the students. The students protested this practice. The library
became the
student center for the college. At times, chaos reigned. What made the
problem
even worse was the inadequate heating and cooling of the building,
which
affected the preservation of rare and valuable books and documents, and
the
lack of work space needed for the librarians to perform their duties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By 1878, the student population was at a
high of about 2,188 and the book collection grew to about 300,000 and
increasing
at approximately 5,000 volumes per year. Again, there was a need for a
new
library and in 1878 Slocum Library was the answer that the university
needed.
In addition to the books already made available, the university created
a
special collections section containing rare and valuable books,
documents and
other artifacts relating to the history of the college. Among the
special
collections were 30,000 additional artifacts and literary texts
relating to
Ohio Methodism. Under the direction of Dr. J. H. Lancaster, director of
Slocum,
the library provided interlibrary loans, reference services and
microfilm to be
used to reproduce library works. The Audio-Visual part of the library
was
located in the South Annex of Elliott Hall.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The library served the public well, but due to the increased enrollment
of students and books, the university was ready to meet the demands of
a new
generation of students and of a changing society. Plans were made to
build
another library. Before the new library was built, the university
needed
approval from the citizens of Delaware. In the May 1964 election, the
citizens
voted for the closing of Franklin Street between Park and University
Avenues to
make way for the library. It was to be built on University Avenue, the
site of
St. Paul&#8217;s Methodist Church. Later, the street would be renamed to
&#8220;Rowland
Avenue.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1963, Mr. Charles Beeghly,
Chairman of the Board of the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation from
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, gave the university a gift of one million
dollars for
the construction of the library. At that time, Charles Beeghly resided
in
Youngstown, Ohio. The library was slated to be completed by the end of
1965.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1966, Beeghly library opened
with a seating capacity double of that of Slocum with four hundred
study
carrels, four conference rooms, two meeting rooms and open areas to
house over
400,000 volumes, making the library the second largest in the state of
Ohio.
The Archive Room was placed on the second floor and the Audio-Visual
Department
was placed on the ground floor adjacent to the periodicals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1966, the library conducted a major
effort to change from the Dewey Decimal System to the system already
implemented by the Library of Congress. Other changes included the
implementation of a retrieval system by computers and to fully
integrate
services with other libraries on a national and international basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The library became one of the largest
United States document depositories in the nation. The library,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Hamilton-Williams Center, the Mowery
Alumni Center and the Chappelear Drama Center, became a mall area which
joined
east and west campuses</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Incidents
of Hauntings&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around 5 p.m., on one
afternoon in August 2007, a student library worker went to the ground
level to
turn off the lights. Since the library was operating in the summer, the
library
closed earlier. Having turned off the lights, the worker proceeded to
the
second level where he noticed a woman studying in one of the carrels.
The
worker informed the woman that the library was closing and also
explained that
the building would reopen at 9 a.m. the next morning. The woman looked
up and
smiled as to indicate that she understood. She got out of her seat and
began to
walk toward him. The woman&#8217;s body turned from having a physical
appearance to a
translucent one (see through). The woman vanished in front of him. The
worker
could not see any books on the table where the student was studying.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Around 6:30 p.m., in the month of May 2008,
the student worker was shelving reference books and happened to look up
toward
the balcony on the second floor when he observed the same woman he had
encountered before. When they locked eyes, she backed away from the
railing and
walked out of his sight. He searched the second and third floors for
her, but to
no avail. One of the other student workers who was assigned to the
circulation
desk did not see the woman exit from the library.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: I was contacted by the worker
regarding these incidents. The worker and I agreed that a search of the
archives should be done to find any information regarding the deaths of
Ohio
Wesleyan students. He brought me an article which appeared in The
Transcript,
the university&#8217;s newspaper. The article shocked me.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
fall of 2005, I was working the day
shift and walking on the mall area in front of the Hamilton-Williams
Center.
There were numerous tables on the mall which held information regarding
student
organizations. I stopped by the table manned by representatives of the
Tri-Delta (Delta Delta Delta) sorority. A beautiful young lady with a
terrific
smile stopped by the same table. We talked about five minutes. At that
time, I
believed that she was one of the students at the university. After our
conversation ended, she proceeded to enter the library. For some
reason, I
could not forget her. The woman, who the library worker encountered in
2007 and
in 2008, is the same person I met in 2005. According to the article in
The
Transcript, she was a member of the Tri-Delta sorority, and passed away
tragically in her home....in November 1996.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hi
guys. I wrote you when I was 13 and told you of my many childhood
experiences.
When I saw my story up on your page, however, all the words were mixed
up and
punctuation differrent. I was going to ask you to try to fix it but the
years
just slipped by. It was quite weird how it did that. Anyway, I am now 22&nbsp;
and have a few new stories to tell about my
new family's first place. I was 19 and had just had my first baby. He
was a few
months old and my boyfriend and I were still living with his sister. We
obviously totally hated it and wanted our own little family to have our
own
space. We were looking for something w 2 bedrooms that was cheap. The
first
place we found was in the town of Dannemora (home to a very large
maximum
security prison) it was fifteen minutes out of Plattsburgh (where we
had been
living) and we thought it might be nice to live in a little town. The
apartment
was right on main street, just past the huge prison wall. It was an old
( I'm
not quite sure how old, at least 50 years) white house that had been
converted
into three apartments. Ours was upstairs in the very back. Now when we
went to
look at it, it was a partly sunny afternoon and the apartment felt so
warm and cozy.
That's what bothered us; it tricked us, as when we came back a week
later to
move in the whole vibe had changed. I was so excited to have our family
together in our own place that I tried to ignore the very oppressive,
negative
presence I felt. That first day I was bringing a box from the living
room into
the kitchen when I saw something black and low to the floor speed by
the
recliner I was walking past. I've thought I was seeing things like this
before,
a trick of light, a shadow, whatever. And previously when I've seen
something
like that I knew it was just an illusion. So, although I knew what I
saw this
time was real, I still tried to convince myself it wasn't. My boyfriend
noticed
the feeling in our place that first day and asked me if I felt it. I
was trying
to delude myself so I said no, it feels fine. After we had all our
stuff moved
in and were settled, we moved in ourselves. I had no cable and just two
recliners for furniture, so I would watch golf or the news or just sit
in
silence. I would be ok sitting there while the baby was sleeping, glad
I felt
comfortable for once, when I'd all of a sudden feel extremely
uncomfortable and
watched. Let me tell you, this pissed me right off. I mean, I had the
right to
be comfortable in my own home! This would happen like this on and off
in the
living room, but in my bedroom, kitchen, and hallway is where it seemed
to be
centered. The bedroom was the worst. Even in the middle of a sunny
winter day I
would only run in there when needed and glance around the room the
entire time.
Next was the kitchen. I would never turn my back in that kitchen. While
I was
doing dishes I'd go into the little space between the cupboards and
sink
instead of standing in front of the sink like a normal person.&nbsp; I
got a different feeling in the kitchen
though, more of being watched by something more curious than 'what the
hell are
you doing here?'.&nbsp; I became used to this
feeling, so when it would get so, so oppressively heavy in my room at
night to
the point where I couldn't even sleep, it scared me of course but it
really
pissed me off. Our windows were old through out the apartment, so when
I'd hear
a door slam shut even when our bedroom door was closed, or watch the
door
rattle, I'd chalk it up to drafts. Then, I began to notice that when it
was
windy, the whole door would rattle and the hallway door and my sons
door would
never slam. But, when things were feeling especially heavy, the door
KNOB would
actually rattle and turn a bit, and our hallway door and my sons door
would
slam shut. I began to hear shifting, scratching noises in the kitchen,
and
tried to convince myself it was a mouse. However, it just sounded like
our
boxes were being moved around and slid across the floor and looked
through.
This would happen when I was in the living room or my bedroom and
whenever my
boyfriend or I would investigate, it would stop. The only room that
truly felt
okay was the bathroom, but if I was in the tub with the door open I'd
constantly be looking into the hallway and would have to close the
door. Now,
for the few things that really stood out to me. The first that happened
was one
night my father came to visit and help with the baby. For one, my
father has
ALWAYS driven these spirits, or whatever, away. My dad is like james
dean and
elvis and a biker all rolled into one, he just has a very cool and
collected,
don't f**k with me attitude about him. For two, when me and my
boyfriend were
there together, we always had the lights on. When my boyfriend or I was
alone
for the night, we would sleep in the living room with the lights on
(with out
even knowing the other did it lol) . This night, I slept in my bedroom
with the
lights off, with my dad in my sons room with him, thinking nothing
would bother
me because of my fathers presence. WRONG. It was sickeningly
uncomfortable and
the air was sooo heavy I felt like I could literally see it swirling
around
like water. Even having my dad come sleep next to my bed on the floor
didn't
help. So crazy. Anytime I've called my father into a room because I had
that
kind of feeling, in any other house, it would go away. The next day, as
well, I
had just smoked a cigarette on the porch and came in, not two minutes
later it
began to rain so I went out to get them. They were gone. I mean, it
could have
been some weirdo that ran all the way down our driveway and up two
flights of
stairs to see if there were any cigarettes to steal, but I doubt it. It
just
felt odd. A few days before halloween, I was relaxing in the living
room when I
heard a very loud knocking that sounded like there was a window right
in front
of me that someone was knocking on really hard. It really confused me
because
our front door was wood and there was a flight of stairs after that
which led
to a door that did have glass, but it would not be that loud and in my
face all
the way in the living room, it would have been muffled. Of course I
went to the
front door, no one,&nbsp; and then the second
door, and no one was there still. There wasn't a car in my driveway or
any
tracks in the light snowfall. It really shook me up. I would also smell
cigarette smoke very heavily in my sons room, focused around the
closet, and in
my hallway. I thought smoke was somehow getting upstairs from my
downstairs
neighbors apartment, and after a while I called my landlord to
complain. He
said he would ask them to not smoke inside. I knew they smoked outside
but
figured they might sneak some inside and thanked him. About two weeks
later,
they moved out and I would STILL smell that cigarette smoke from time
to time,
a couple times it even smelled like marijuana smoke. After a couple of
months,
I began to hear very, very faint whispering and felt like I had people
all
around me, very close to my face. That was extremely annoying and I
would
snuggle up next to my baby so I could hear his breathing instead. Now,
there
was only one night, when I was up late (prob 2:30 am) where I could
actually
make out one of the whispers. I heard "its her baby". It pissed me
off because my son was right there with me and that was the last person
I wanted
them to mess with. So I sat up and began to read. I got a strange urge
to look
up into the hallway, and when I did, I saw a head, about 6 foot up the
hallway
doorframe, begin to peer into the hallway. All I saw were some curly
black
tufts of hair at first, then a black shadowy from of a profile. I
glanced away
and when I looked back, it was gone. I sat there, trying to figure out
if I had
really just seen that. I kept trying to convince myself that it was my
cat who
had somehow climbed up the door frame and the light that came from
behind made
it look like a face. I mean, I knew it wasn't possible and I would have
heard
and seen her climb up and seen her jump down, but I tried to explain it
away
because I hadn't seen something like that since I was a child. Anyway,
that's
what I experienced there, and I included the towns name, and street
name so
that if anyone happens to search this town or apartment they will find
this and
hopefully contact me. I know they went through many people there and in
the 5 months
we lived there, I only stayed there about half the time because of all
the
occurrences, and we went through three neighbors downstairs. The last
people
who stayed there were there for maybe two weeks before they just left.
That
makes me think something was up down there as well. Anyway, thank you
for
listening and I'm sorry its so long and detailed but I just had to
explain the
whole big picture. Thanks again.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Gitchi
Manitou State Park in Iowa</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
christopherw77@gmail.com </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I
think another point of interest may be worth note in the upper midwest
near the
IA/SD border regarding Gitchi Manitou State Park, officially in the
Northwestern portion of Iowa. There are various accounts for spiritual
activity
here, of which the oldest are accounts from the Native American people
that
once inhabited the area. For starters, Gitchi Manitou in literal
translation
means Great Spirit, so it is considered sacred by some tribes. Also, I
have a
friend that is Native American, and he has said there are stories from
Native
American tribes in that area of those that drowned in the river at
night whom
were lured there by water spirits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Furthermore, there is a darker history that surrounds the area, and
maybe a few more to which not everyone may be aware. In 1973, there was
a
series of violent deaths that occurred from the actions of three
brothers with
some teenagers that camped in the area. The perpetraitors' names were
David,
Allen, and James Fryer and they killed four boys and raped a girl that
was with
the group, but she survived. The brothers later blamed their behaviors
on
illicit marijuana use, but there are other rumors from locals, myself
included,
whom heard the boys may have been influenced by melevolent spirits on
the
grounds. If there wasn't enough said, there is more...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is also a small gravesite on the
grounds where a family is buried. Some have reported seeing small balls
of
light eminating above the headstones, which I am not sure are still
there.
There is also the remains of a very, very old building, of which the
framework
still stands. It's made of the native stone found in the area and you
can still
see the fireplace in the building, which is inclusive with the frame.
There is
a path that leads from the corner of the highway of the road back to
the
building. Also, there is a sign that states trespassers will be shot,
but that
makes no sense at all, since it's a state park. I have included a map
of the
area, as well as a link that discusses some of the events that took
place
there. Not many places are known beyond the locals of the area, as I'm
unsure
that this portion of the country receives much traffic. I'm devoting
the
information to your site because I was really impressed to see how many
places
and stories you've devoted to the hunting and stories of ghosts, as
well as
other paranormal phenomenon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lastly, there is one story to contribute, which is my own. Several
times
I have visted this site, both during the night and the day. There have
been a
series of events I am unable to forget. On some of those visits, I can
feel the
energies of the area and understand very much that I'm not alone when I
go
there. Others that I've brought with me have also felt the presence of
something, but they dismissed these occurrences as fringing too closely
to the
imagination. If that were the case, why would we ALL feel it when we
visit?
Everyone seems to. A nighttime visit is much more entailed with
activity than
during the day. I think the spirits there are more active (naturally).
When
walking the path at night, you can here twigs breaking in the brush and
trees
and it sounds like something is nearby, following you. I've heard
footsteps
trailing behind us and there is a very eerie sensation of being watched
from
within the brush and bushes. Something strong is there... Something
old--you
can feel it. One never feels safe venturing too far from the path
leading to
the cabin when traveling on it at night, even with the strongest of
flashlights. Something sort of dark in feeling gives you the sensation
that sort
of distracts you where the water lays, which gives me pause about the
Native
American stories. There have also been Satanic practices in the area
(never a
good thing). There are also stories of a farmer that once lived in the
area
with his family that killed them and stuffed their bodies down a well.
I don't
know if that story is true, </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>though.
Ihope you may find this interesting and consider publishing it on your
site.
:-) Thanks so much for your time,</big></p>
