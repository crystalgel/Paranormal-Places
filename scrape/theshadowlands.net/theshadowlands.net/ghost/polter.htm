<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">The word words comes from the German tern poltern
- "to knock" and geist - "spirit". This phenomenon has been researched
extensively for years.&nbsp; It has been the subject of movies, but I don't
think Carol Ann and her family were being plague by a poltergeist in the
movie.&nbsp; There are a few different theories on what poltergeists are.&nbsp;
I am going to discuss the one theory that I believe here and keep it simple
as possible.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">A typical poltergeist haunting seems to always
consist of noises, such as loud knocking, and objects moving about on their
own.&nbsp; There can also be voices, smells and apparitions in addition
to the other symptoms.&nbsp; Usually these events are witnessed by numerous
people in the home , including visitors.&nbsp; The events may start slowly
with small noises and small objects moving and then may progress to something
like furniture flying around the room and full bodied apparitions.&nbsp;
The exact events differ from case to case as well as the progression and
severity.&nbsp; Normally there is one person who seems more affected than
others and is always present in the home when events occur.&nbsp; When
that person is removed from the home, the events cease.&nbsp; This person
is usually a preteen female who's hormones and the stress of that age combine
and finally release subconsciously in a way that causes the poltergeist
activity.&nbsp; The person is causing all of the phenomenon with the subconscious
mind and they are not aware that they are the cause.&nbsp; This person
can also be a teenager or into their early twenties and may be under some
unusual amount of stress.&nbsp; When they are relived of the stress, sometimes
by moving from the location, the problems stop.&nbsp; If the stress or
causes continue, the "haunting" seems to follow them.&nbsp; Reliving the
inner problems is the key to stopping the poltergeist activity.</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">Poltergeists are not often easily discernable
from other types of spirit hauntings.&nbsp; The symptoms are often very
similar.&nbsp; An onsite investigation and extensive research is often
necessary to uncover the hidden existence of this type of phenomenon.&nbsp;
This explains why many questions that investigators ask seem off base when
they interview witnesses in a home.&nbsp; They are trying to rule out a
poltergeist problem before they start the investigation into the possible
spirit activity.</FONT></B>
