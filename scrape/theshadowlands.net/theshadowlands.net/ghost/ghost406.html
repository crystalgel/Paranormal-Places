Haunted House My Encounter<br>
<br>
By: sarajane123000@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
My friends and I Live in Dinuba, and were driving around one day and
saw an old 2 story house that was burned down. So, we decided to go in.
I had a tape recorder with me (only for voice) and so I decided to
record anything that happened. So we were walking around the house and
as we got to the stairs, we heard music. It sounded like old 50&#8217;s
carousel music. Then, it stopped abruptly. So we all left. This was all
recorded on the tape. The next day, we went back and I had my recorder
again, but this time, we couldn&#8217;t hear anything at the time, only on
the recorder. We had stood in the house for about 5 minutes, waiting
for something to happen. But suddenly we all got a horrible feeling and
ran out of the house and to my friend&#8217;s car and drove away. We pulled
over to the side of the road and listened to the tape. On it, you can
hear the music again, and then, right before we all ran outside, you
can hear a person whisper, (not sure if it is male or female) &#8220;Go,
Don&#8217;t Talk-Run&#8221;. And right after you hear that, that&#8217;s when we all
started running to the car. And as were getting in the car, you can
hear about 3 little girls laughing, and one asking us if we are
alright, and you hear one of us reply yes.&nbsp; <br>
We tried to research this house, but couldn&#8217;t find anything, only that
part of it had burned down. This all happened around November 2005.
Now, too many people had been breaking into the house to do drugs, so
the city burned the whole house down.<br>
One day, I hid the recorder in my dresser drawer, and about a month
later, I looked, and it wasn&#8217;t in there. I have yet to find it.<br>

My Experience<br>
<br>
hikari_sin@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I come from the small town of Durant, Oklahoma.&nbsp; This is a true
story.&nbsp; When I was 15 my mother had passed away in January,
2004.&nbsp; That summer I worked on a youth program and chose to work
at the library like I've done in the past.&nbsp; Only this time it was
different.&nbsp; Everyone always set me up in the juvenile section,
that hasn't changed, lol.&nbsp; There's this one section by the windows
that I always loved to sit down in the floor and read on my
breaks.&nbsp; My first day when I walked into that section, the hair on
my arms and neck stood on end.&nbsp; I payed no attention to it, I
walked in further.&nbsp; I felt someone watching me.&nbsp; At this
point I felt totally uncomfortable, like the presence of someone angry
at me, wanting to strike out at me.&nbsp; I ran out of there and I
thought I heard someone following me all the way.<br>
The next day I made sure I stayed clear of that area and worked a few
sections over.&nbsp; About that time whispers were behind my
back.&nbsp; I couldn't make them out.&nbsp; I spun around and they
stopped.&nbsp; I turned back around and they started again.&nbsp; It
was like that all week.<br>
The very next week I was told to work in that one section that I
called, 'Demon's Corridor.'&nbsp; I sat myself down and starting
putting books on the shelf when I saw out of the corner of my eye a
shadow standing at the end watching me.&nbsp; I quickly turned my head
and saw a retreating shadow.&nbsp; I leapt up and ran to the opposite
side and followed the path hoping to see a kid.&nbsp; I saw
nothing.&nbsp; I ran back into the adult section where my co-workers
were and accused them of scaring me.&nbsp; They said that they haven't
been in my section all day.&nbsp; They told me I might've seen kid
seeing as that WAS the juvenile section.&nbsp; I looked up at the
clock.&nbsp; It was 8:30.&nbsp; The library doors did's open until
9:00.&nbsp; There is NO way in the library without a key or someone to
hold the door open for you.&nbsp; Shaken up, I returned to my work.<br>
I felt worse and worse everyday.&nbsp; One night I went home and sat
down in my room to watch some tv when I hear my door knob rattle.&nbsp;
I think, "my sister is trying to get in my room."&nbsp; And I laugh it
off as my door WAS locked.&nbsp; Then the beatings on the door became
violent and the rattling wouldn't stop.&nbsp; I jumped up and jerked
the door open about to tell my sister off.&nbsp; There was nothing
there.&nbsp; I ran into the living room and told my grandma to tell
Rebecca to stop pounding my door.&nbsp; She said my sister left with my
grandpa hours ago.&nbsp; I was VERY afraid now.&nbsp; Whatever it was
at the library, had followed me home.<br>
Weeks into the job, books started falling off the shelves.&nbsp; Huge
shelves came toppling down when no one was there to push it.&nbsp; I
even had to file an injury report because a whole stack of thick books
fell out on me while I was putting them up.&nbsp; The whispers behind
my back became more frequent.&nbsp; Shadows were everywhere.&nbsp;
Books fell out of the shelves.&nbsp; I felt uncomfortable locked in my
room at night.&nbsp; I was being watched.&nbsp; I was scared out of my
mind.&nbsp; I talked with my grandpa and he told me that momma always
loved to read.&nbsp; He said maybe it was mom's spirit reaching out to
me.&nbsp; But why?<br>
One day after work was over and nearly everyone left, I stood in the
library and said outloud.&nbsp; "I don't like this.&nbsp; Whoever you
are, stop doing this to me.&nbsp; Stop it now."&nbsp; The next day,
nothing happened.&nbsp; The shadows vanished.&nbsp; The whispers
stopped.&nbsp; Books remained where they were.&nbsp; Shelves remained
on the floor.&nbsp; Then I realized it may not have been momma.&nbsp;
As I was walking down the sidewalk to my ride, I turned and saw that
the building next to the library was Coffey's Funeral and Cremation
Services.<br>
And that's it.&nbsp; True I swear!<br>

My boyfirend lives in a house that is very old, and has now been
converted into two apartments.&nbsp; He occupies the top 2 floors with
his roomate.&nbsp; Anytime anyone is alone in the apartment it always
sounds like somebody is walking around in the kitchen , and getting a
glass of water.&nbsp; But the freakiest thing happened to us last
friday night...Oct. 20th, my boyfriend and I were watching the
discovery channel, and they had a family on telling the story about
their house being haunted.&nbsp; The ghosts in their house would always
set the smoke detectors off, making them beep briefly then stop.&nbsp;
Literally 2 seconds later it cut to commercial... all of a sudden, th
smoke detector in my boyfriends kitchen started bEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP 4
times , then it abruptly stopped.&nbsp; FREAKY!&nbsp; It hs not
happened since, but other things have.<br>

Woodbury Cemetery Experience<br>
<br>
By: Sbigblock@aol.com<br>

<br>
Good morning. I enjoyed your website. I have one expirence to add to
the woodbury cemetary listing. About 7 or 8 years ago my mother stood
on the backside of the cemetary to take a picture of a tree. Now we
were on a side road and not really facing the cemetary. Yet when she
went home and tried to print out the pictures she couldn't. They were
filled with a fog like thing and some how we lost them on the computer.
Now my family all lived in woodbury our whole lives. My sister, brother
and I have gone in there as a shortcut from the park to main street and
there is definetly something following you. If you walk fast you hear
someone behind you walking just as fast. I don't know what was in those
pictures but I do know that it is such an eerie feeling and extremely
unpleasant to be around there. They are actually doing a halloween tour
on the 28 and 29 this year. Just wanted to share my little expirence.<br>

The Orange Foot Stool<br>
<br>
By: flattslovr156@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
It's been a couple months since this has happened, but i remember it
clearly. My grandma Vaunie on my dad's side of the family died about a
year or two ago, and my papa (her husband) died when I was one year
old. Their house was left to my dad, but he gave it to his sister (my
aunt) as long as she gave him half the price when she sold it. My dad,
my stepmom, my aunt and I were at the house getting the rest of his
possesions from the house. they were all in the livingroom and I was in
the kitchen looking through an orange foot stool that opened on top.
There were cabbage patch dolls, barbies, coloring books, and gift
wrapping papers. I was looking at the cabbage patch doll when I saw my
granny and papa through her eyes. I also felt a presence in the room
with me. Suddenly I felt a hand on each of my shoulders. One hand was
small like a woman's. The other hand was big, rough and calloused, like
a man's. I was too surprised to look behind me. when the hands were
gone, and my granny and papa were gone from the dolls eyes I ran in the
livingroom and told my dad. He said " your granny and papa ain't gonna
hurt you." I knew that but it was still scary. I still felt the
presence, but this time it was more comfortable. I was actually sad
when we left.<br>

The Little Boy<br>
<br>
<br>
By: michelle.connolly@promptcare.net<br>
<br>
Six Years ago I moved into a townhouse with my dad and stepmom. I had
lived in my previous house for 11 years and grew up frightened of the
dark, mainly from silly childhood imagination. I always listened and
found many things were attributed to the house settling and common
noises. When I started hearing noises in the townhouse, I figured I
wasn&#8217;t use to its normal noises. I would pay attention to floor boards
and the noises as a walked the house. Many nights I would be upstairs
and hear creaking downstairs and the same vice versa. Finally after a
few months I asked my stepmom if she heard the same. She told me not to
mention anything to my father because he wouldn&#8217;t believe, and began to
tell me her experiences when she and my dad had first moved in. She was
under the distinct impression that it was a spirit of a little boy. She
had gone as far as to ask neighbors the history of the house. It had
been unused for 2 years and neighbors say nothing bad had happened and
they didn&#8217;t recall a young boy living here. My room was a spare bedroom
and the room next to mine is my dads office. I often used the computer
in his office and felt out of nowhere, ice cold chills thru my entire
body. Sometimes, along with the chills Id feel their was someone
standing behind me that wanted me out of the room, at which time Id run
into my room and shut the door. One day I was home all alone in the
room and on the computer. I heard a bang downstairs so loud that I got
up to see why one of my parents had come home. I checked out the window
to the garage and no car had pulled up. I went downstairs to see if
something had fallen and everything was in its place. I started working
part time at the grocery store and when I would come home from school
Id go into my bathroom which was across from the office to freshen up.
Everyday for 2 weeks I felt I was being watched as if something was in
the door frame a few feet from where I was standing. The feeling was
very hard for me to ignore and many times I ran out of the house. I
always kept in mind my stepmom saying that she never felt harmed by it,
and I felt uneasy having things happen so often. After 2 years of the
small mishaps I tried to ignore the feeling of being singled out, until
the door to my bedroom started opening on its own. For about a month I
would come upstairs to my room and shut the door behind me. Each time
only a moment later my door would open half way and then stop. The wall
to my closet is to the right and I wouldn&#8217;t be able to see out into the
hallway. Finally when I came up to my room one night I decided to turn
around and look as I was shutting my door. There in the doorway to the
office, was the face of a boy with blond hair! His face almost looked
shocked that I had seen him and disappeared immediately. I told my
stepmom and my dad overheard. He said hed try to fix my door and he
did, but it still open for a few days after. My stepmom was getting
concerned, especially since she would hear the noises the most in the
stairwell. One Valentines day she heard footsteps walk into her room
halfway and then walk back out. I had never heard anything in my room
and always felt safe in there. Every year my parents go on Vacation in
October. I finally took one of those nights, sat in my living room,
watched a movie that scared the crap out of me and decided to do a
test. I turned off all the lights in the house and sat in the living
room frightened. I said outloud &#8220;okay this is a perfect time for my
mind to play tricks on me and I am genuinely scared&#8221; I waited in the
dark for almost an hour and heard nothing. No one creak or sound. For
awhile the noises were less frequent and my stepmom said she hadn&#8217;t
heard anything in a long time. Few things still occurred. One time I
was sitting alone while my parents were out and the cat suddenly looked
up and was staring directly next to the space where I was sitting and
at the same moment I felt something was there with us. I reached my
hand out in the spot and felt cold. I moved my hand all around it and
they were normal temperature and the same spot was cold. What had also
scared me was when I was sitting in the same chair one night I heard
what sounded like a gust of wind go clear across the upstairs floor.
When I went outside the air was still and no sign of wind. Looking back
many of the incidents were in broad daylight. After about four years I
started to get use to it and sometimes get annoyed. One night I was
leaving to grab a bite to eat before heading to a friends house. I
decided to stop home again first to eat when I heard a loud bang
upstairs. I continued to eat and went upstairs to shut the computer off
and I heard the same loud bang downstairs. I then said to the cat &#8220;good
luck here tonight&#8221; and spent the night at my friends house. I really
started hearing it more often again in the past year and my stepmom
hadn&#8217;t. A few months ago I was reading about spirits and decided to try
something a girl said would work. I asked my stepmom if she would mind
walking thru the house with me. We both walked around to each room and
said outloud and firmly &#8220; there is nothing for you here. Move into the
light&#8221; and since then I haven&#8217;t heard much or paid attention to what I
have heard. Ive found the best way is to not give it my fear. Six years
is more than enough. <br>

The Imps<br>
<br>
By: chiara_moscardini@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm not really sure why, because for years I have been avoiding
anything to do with ghosts or the supernatural because it terrifies me,
but last night I decided to run a search on real life ghost stories to
see other people's experiences and find out if anyone else's were
similar to mine.<br>
When I was a little girl my family always used to say I had an
overactive imagination, I refused to sleep with the light off and
always had to have my bedroom door closed, up until I left to stay with
my gran when I was 16 I would sometimes run through to sleep in my
parents bed. At these times I didn't see things, but I felt them there.
It was out in the hall which was why I had to have the door closed and
at times if I could feel it out there I would crouch behind my door
crying, too scared to go outside and across the hall to my parents
bedroom. Sometimes I would wonder myself if it was my imagination, when
I was very young I used to hear a woman calling my name but there was
never anyone there or no one had called me. I would hear this voice at
different times of the day in different places and it never scared me
though eventually i heard it less and less until it stopped.<br>
I can remember vividly the first night I actually saw something. I was
16 and on a school trip to Rome, I shared a hotel room with 3 other
girls from my year. In the middle of the night I woke up, I could see
one of the girls standing at the corner of the double bed the 2 other
girls were sharing and staring at them, her head was down slightly so I
couldn't see her face as her hair covered it. I called out to her
asking what she was doing, but she didn't reply so I called out her
name, Lauren, It was then I realised that I could see Lauren sleeping
in her bed and that the person i could see wasn't her. It didn't feel
dangerous or evil but I was still terrified, too scared to even reach
out and turn on the light. I rolled over to face the wall, closed my
eyes and waited for morning to come.<br>
The next night I woke up during the night again and the same thing was
there only this time there was something else. The thing that scared me
most about this one was the feeling that it gave me, it was very small
and dark and was rushing around the room. I rolled over again but could
still sense it moving in the room behind me, I rolled round to face the
room, wanting to turn on the light but when I turned over it was right
there, in front off my face. I was so scared I couldn't move, I just
cried and eventually covered my head with the sheet and cried until I
fell asleep.<br>
The next night I refused to sleep in the room and went to sleep with my
friends in another room where i woke everybody up during the night due
to me screaming in my sleep, which I had never done before.<br>
What really freaked me out was that the imp things that you described
in your story sound exactly like the thing that I saw that was moving
round the room.<br>
Another time that I was staying in an appartment in Magaluf, as I was
trying to get to sleep I felt something pass my bed, I opened my eyes
and saw a tall figure passing through my room, I can't remember if I
called out to it or just watched it but it turned to look at me and
carried on walking until it was out of the room.<br>
I have not seen anything since these incidents but there are still many
nights that I get a bad vibe or feel a presence about the room and so I
will sleep somewhere else or with the light on. Sometimes i wake my
boyfriend up because I get a feeling that there's something there but I
don't want to open my eyes to see it.<br>
Maybe the things i think I feel or sense in a room are just my
imagination but I know that those t things that I saw were there, it's
hard finding people that believe though because everyone's always
thinks that I'm just imagining it.<br>
Sometimes I'm not sure whether to believe my own mind or not.<br>

The Beast<br>

&nbsp; <br>
My mom used to tell me these stories about a house she used to live
in.&nbsp; She moved in just after the birth of my older brother.&nbsp;
Since she couldn't afford it on her own, her sister moved in with
her.&nbsp; At the time my mom and dad were just dating so he didnt live
there with them.&nbsp; Soon after moving my mom and aunt were
experiancing all kinds of things.&nbsp; 1st encounter:&nbsp; My mom
threw a tupperware party and as people were leaving she walked outside
with them.&nbsp; One woman turned around and said "WOW, you cat has
some very green eyes" my mom confused turned around and saw that in the
upstairs bedroom there were two green eyes glowing in the window.&nbsp;
my mom turned to the lady and said "well thats strange because i just
saw Sam (the cat) in the kitchen"&nbsp; My mom then went back into the
house to find Sam still eating her food where she had been just minutes
before.&nbsp; What was in the bedroom???&nbsp; My mom then rushed
upstars to find nothing that could have possibly have made that sort of
reflection appear.&nbsp; 2nd encounter:&nbsp; On many many occasions
small things would happen such as faucets turning on and off, light
flickering, banging noises and other oddities.&nbsp; One thing that
happened a lot was my two older siblings Katie and Russell would come
screaming down the stairs saying "its coming its coming!!!!"&nbsp; so
they were seeing something no one else did.&nbsp; But on one strange
occasion my mom found my brother and sister in the same crib which they
had been in seperate ones to begin with and they were mumbling to some
weighted balloons that had somehow mysteriously floated up stairs into
my brothers crib.&nbsp; who could they have been talking
to?&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of my mom and aunts friends didn't believe these
stories so when they would disagree they would always get alittle
surprise like a picture falling off the wall into their lap or a very
distinct vibration in the floor.&nbsp; My mom and aunt were never
bothered by these things since the ghost was causing no harm to
them.&nbsp; That was until one night ...........&nbsp; The final straw
for my mom started on a night like any other.&nbsp; My dad had stopped
over for dinner as usual.&nbsp; Well for some reason or another my mom
and dad got into a fight and my mom doesnt fight in front of us so she
kicked him out until he calmed down.&nbsp; Well, in the house they
lived in the back door didn't lock so she had to hold it so he couldn't
come back in.&nbsp; So she put a chair under the door handle and waited
for my dad to go away.&nbsp; Finally he did and she watched him get
into his truck and take off.&nbsp; she then took the chair away from
the door incase my aunt was to come home.&nbsp; After the long fight
she was tired so she layed on the couch facing the back of it (there
for hindering her sight as to what was behind her)&nbsp; as soon as she
got comfortable she heard the back door slowly creak open and then slam
again.&nbsp; She figured Dad had to of come back knowing no one would
be keeping the door shut.&nbsp; She heard him come through the kithchen
slowly and then all the way to the living room and stand behind her
just breathing.&nbsp; My mom kept her eyes shut so it would appear as
though she was asleep and maybe he would go away.&nbsp; Then there was
a growling coming from behind her.&nbsp; It wasnt human, and it wasnt
animal.&nbsp; It was a sound that she had never heard before in her
life, and it was so loud.&nbsp; My mom knew she had to turn over and
look but she was so frightened that as she turned over she kept her
eyes shut until she finally made it all the way around.&nbsp; then she
took a deep breath and opened her eyes.&nbsp; There was nothing
there.&nbsp; Needless to say they were out by the next week!<br>

Seeing is Believing<br>
<br>
By: ExileRider1@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I am 34 years old and I have been a Peace Officer for 16 years
now.&nbsp; I have seen and experienced many things to truly understand
that there is more then what just lies in front of us to plainly
see.&nbsp; What I saw at the age of 3 years old has made me a believer
and very open minded my entire life.<br>
When I was approx. 3 years old, my mother and I lived with my
Grandfather and my Grandmother in a home that my Grandfather had built
in the early 1950's.&nbsp; My mother was 19 years old at the time, the
year was either, 1974 or 1975.&nbsp; My mother and I lived in that home
with my grandparents for the first 4 years of my life.&nbsp; It was a
single story home&nbsp; with a one car garage built below the front
living room.&nbsp; It is a 3 bedroom, one bath home still located in
unincorporated South Vallejo, Solano County Ca.&nbsp; <br>
My mother and I shared the front room.&nbsp; I plainly remember the
floor plan of that room.&nbsp; As you walked in directly to your left
there was the sliding door closet.&nbsp; Then to the right was our bed
so when you lay in it you would directly be facing the closet.&nbsp;
Next to the bed was the window which faced out towards the front of the
house.&nbsp; <br>
Early one morning I laid awake with the moon light shining into the
room.&nbsp; My mother was sleeping next to me and I was looking towards
the closet.&nbsp; I plainly saw a man, wearing a black wide brimmed hat
and long black coat standing in the closet against my mothers
cloths.&nbsp; As he stood he swayed from side to side.&nbsp; I could
not make out his face, it was dark, with only slight moon light
lighting the room.&nbsp; I looked to my right over to the window,
thinking that this man was standing out side of our window with the
moon light against his back, and it was perhaps a shadow reflecting
into the room.&nbsp; That was not the case, our bedroom window was
approx. 6 feet high off of the ground.&nbsp; I looked back and there he
stood in the closet.&nbsp; In complete fear I pulled the covers over my
head.&nbsp; I was even too afraid to make a sound to wake my mother, in
fear of what would happen to us if she awoke.<br>
The next morning I told my grand father, terrified and I remember him
pushing the cloths from side to side showing me there was no one inside
the closet.&nbsp; When I grew up and I was in High School I spoke to my
mother about the man I had seen.&nbsp; I thought that the sighting was
merely my young imagination, the common "boogeyman" syndrome of a young
child.&nbsp; She told me that when she was a little girl at the age of
approx. 6 years old she too had seen the man with the large black
brimmed hat and black trench coat standing in the back yard of the
house, out side of my grandparents bedroom.&nbsp; It struck a cold fear
in her that remains to this day as it does with me.&nbsp; I realized
that perhaps I had actually been fortunate enough to see something that
I find scary, but yet amazing.<br>
My grandparents sold that house around 1977 when I was 5 years old.<br>
When my grandmother passed away in 2001, after the funeral, My mother
and I along with my female cousin Kathy, who is 8 years older then me
drove the 3 miles from the funeral service to the old house which has
remained abandoned and has been for many years now.&nbsp; It is the
only abandoned house on the street.&nbsp; We walked through the house
which had changed very much and was so run down.&nbsp; The three of us
sat on the front porch and recalled the many good memories of the old
house.&nbsp; <br>
I then brought up the story of the man with the Black hat.&nbsp; My
cousin looked at me and her mouth opened slightly and a look of fear
but relief appeared to flow across her face.&nbsp; Kathy began to tell
her story of the man she had also seen.&nbsp; She told us that she was
about 5 years old and was standing in the lower garage looking out the
side window.&nbsp; Kathy told us that she saw a man standing outside
the garage wearing a black trench coat and a large black brimmed
hat.&nbsp; She said that she saw what looked like large holes through
his body as if he had been shot.&nbsp; It scared her and she had
blocked the memory from her mind.&nbsp; When I told my story it all
came back to her.&nbsp; My mother then told my cousin of her sighting
of the man.&nbsp; All three of us had seen the same man, Ghost, if you
will, when we were around the same ages of less then 6 years old.<br>
To this day the old house stands abandoned, for sale, with no takers.<br>
Seeing is believing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

School Stories<br>
<br>
By: babygirl032296@cox.net<br>
<br>
My name is Lydia and my sister whose name is Ashley and I both went to
Christiansburg Middle School and we both have had separate experiences
in that middle school. Mine was in the library, that&#8217;s where people
have heard babies crying. In the library there are a number of small
wooden doors that lead to old bleachers. I was in the library one day
and I was near one of the wooden doors and I heard a baby cry, then a
few weeks later I was in the library again doing research and I was
sitting at a table with a friend of mine and I felt someone breathe on
my neck, and there was no one around. We were not sitting under any air
vents.<br>
Ashley&#8217;s experience happened in the girl&#8217;s bathroom that is another
place that is &#8220;haunted&#8221;. She was in the bathroom alone and she heard a
toilet flush by itself. And the bathrooms didn&#8217;t have the automatic
toilets.&nbsp; Every time I went into the bathroom alone I got the
feeling that someone watching me. No one I knew would go anywhere in
that school alone, mainly in the girl&#8217;s bathroom.<br>
We now live in CT but we will never forget what happened to us in
toughs walls of that school. I hope this helps some people who want to
go to see if this middle school is truly haunted. One more thing the
teachers and other members of the staff and faculty told the students
that it was not haunted but we knew otherwise.<br>
<br>
<br>

Scary Basement<br>
<br>
By: finkd@sbcglobal.net<br>

<br>
My friend lives in an old house, maybe 50 years old. It doesn't look
scary on the outside or upstairs but their basement is scary.<br>
One time a while ago, my friend had a sleepover in her basement. We
were all crazy and scaring ourselves. Her basement has this blocked off
area where you have to climb over a pool table to get to it, and
there's a toy basket behind there, then a bathroom next to it. Well, we
were in the living room spot (not at all close to the pool table) and
all of a sudden I see this purple monkey laying on the couch. I asked
anyone if they had seen it on the couch before or if they had moved it
to scare us. No one did and they weren't lying. I was watching that
spot the whole time.<br>
Another time my friend told me (and she wasn't lying. The only time she
lies is when she has a joking voice) her dad was in the basement with
her and he had washed his hands, turned the water off, and left. Then
they heard the water turn on. My friend turned off the water and left,
but the water turned on again. They were freaked!<br>
She told me some stories too. A lady had died on Halloween and she was
old and mean. These other people had weird experiences. There was this
mirror in her basement that a guy would see spirits in. The people who
had lived there moved out as fast as they could.<br>
I have felt akward in her house. I have tingling feelings sometimes.
Her basement is cold when they have the heat on. I think there are
ghosts down there.<br>

Personal Experience<br>

Back in 1973 I lived at&nbsp; in Philadelphia, PA. Early one morning,
right after my husband left for work, I was sitting reading at the
kitchen table when I suddenly got splashed with water!&nbsp; There was
no one else in the room, there was no water running, and the doors and
windows were closed. I was so scared that I ran out the back door to my
neighbor&#8217;s house and couldn&#8217;t stop shaking. Another time, in the same
house, after my husband went to work, I felt someone get into bed with
me! The bed springs creaked and I felt the mattress shift. I thought my
heart would go through my chest! My daughter used to tell me she heard
strange things too. Needless to say, I was glad to move in 1978.<br>

Many say that my 100 year old home is haunted by spirits of the past&nbsp; . <br>
I've never checked the records for any terribly unfortunate deaths or anything though .<br>
Some people are very uncomfortable when they visit describing it as
somewhat creepy&nbsp; and yet others say they love it's comfy feeling .
<br>
Guests have ask me where the music is comming from and I am unable to tell them. <br>
It sounds somewhat old fashioned ...sort of sounds like&nbsp; violins
and /or banjo , and occasionally it sounds like someone is giving a
speech or perhaps a sermon or something but it's intelligable.<br>
Sometimes you see short glimpses of someone hurrying by .<br>
And sometimes you smell damn good old fashioned cooking when I've not
cooked in days ......fresh cookies , mouth watering pot roast , bacon
and eggs ,etc .<br>
Haunted sounds like such a harsh word.......I prefer " inhabited ". <br>
And they have caused no grief to my family or I in over 20 years , so I say it's a good thing.<br>
My husband passed away in this house almost 10 years ago , but I know it's not him. <br>
I would guess that you would have prefered a scary story and this just isn't so..but I thought I'd share anyway.<br>

Mysterious<br>

In 1960 my Uncle built a house next door to us.&nbsp; It was nice
having family close to visit and just have get togethers.&nbsp; We were
always running back and forth between the houses.&nbsp; One night&nbsp;
in&nbsp; September with a full moon, my father couldn't sleep so he got
up to have a cigarette.&nbsp; He would walk around our house&nbsp; with
no lights on and you'd see his lit cigarette traveling from room to
room.&nbsp; This night he looked out the window into his Brother in
laws back yard and noticed someone walking around.&nbsp; Appeared to be
a female figure with white hair, dressed in white.&nbsp; She walked to
the back of the property placed something in the ground, and walked
away.&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't think too much about it until the next day
he realized no one next door had white hair.&nbsp; My aunt had Jet
Black hair,&nbsp; her kids were brunette and so was Uncle.&nbsp; Dad
was a little nervous, but shrugged it off, probably was his
imagination.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let's skip ahead to 1999.&nbsp; We're
still living in the same house,&nbsp; Uncle is retired but still lives
next door.<br>
Around 10 pm I looked out the window and saw a little old lady (I
thought) with white hair in a nightgown.&nbsp; She was trying to walk
up the driveway next door, but stopped and started to pace back and
forth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since my Mother now had white
hair,&nbsp; I said is that her?&nbsp; I ran downstairs and there she
was asleep in bed.&nbsp; I walked next door and the lady was
gone,&nbsp; My cousin came down the front stairs and said,&nbsp; 'Did
you see a lady with white hair?'&nbsp; Yes I did,&nbsp; but where did
she go?&nbsp; She appeared on his security camera, as he walked to the
door and opened it she was gone.<br>
Who she is or if she's from the other side,&nbsp; we'll never
know.&nbsp; I told my cousin what my father saw in 1960 and he
shuttered.&nbsp;&nbsp; He checks his security camera alot more
now.&nbsp; <br>
If she comes back, we'll let you know.<br>

Jasmine<br>
<br>
By: wanderingfaerie2000@yahoo.com<br>

<br>
I was reading the stories on the website, and it brought to mind one of my own.<br>
In February of 2005, my dog Jasmine passed away from internal bleeding,
the direct result of a rupture in her spleen. This came after she had
been suffering from arthritis for about four years. She was part of our
family for eleven years, so understandably her death really hit us
hard. It was especially difficult for me, because we raised her from
the time she was a puppy, when I was 8 years old, and I was 19 when she
passed. She was also the first dog I was told I could have after
finding out that my allergy to dog fur had gone away. <br>
We adopted a new dog, whom I named Bijou, from a shelter near my home
in April of that same year. It had only been two months, but we felt
that the house was just far too quiet without a dog to keep us company.
<br>
On a hot day in July, Bijou was taking a nap in the den, and my
boyfriend Jason and I were in my room. My room is in the central part
of the house, with the kitchen running parallel to it. The kitchen has
a linoleum floor, so any sounds made on it can be heard clearly.&nbsp;
All of a sudden, Jason and I heard what sounded like a dog's nails
walking around, and we assumed it was Bijou. I walked out of my room
and to the den not a moment later, and I found Bijou still sleeping on
the floor in there. I came back and told Jason this, and we concluded
that it obviously wasn't Bijou walking around...so we walked all around
the house to see what might have made that noise. When we found no
plausible solution, we returned to my room, perplexed. <br>
Then Jason mentioned that it must have been Jasmine's spirit.[He has
had some experiences of his own with the paranormal, so I knew he
wasn't pulling this out of the sky.] I told him that that made sense to
me, because she had led such a happy life in our home and loved us all
dearly. I still miss her to this day. <br>

A Nice House<br>
<br>
By: ulujm@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I was 30 years old from France when I decided to go in USA for a job
related to the automotive industry. First I went alone, my wife
(Sophie) and my 2 kids (Julie, 8 years old and Helene, 10 years old)
will come later once I found a house for all of us. This was in June
1998.<br>
My boss found an apartment close to Detroit to give me the time to find the House.<br>
After a month I finally choose a nice 3 bedrooms house in the country
side close to a city called Royal Oak. I wanted to buy a house since I
was going to stay in USA for at least 5 years. My wife saw the house by
internet and came for 2 weeks to be sure the house was her taste. The
house was not that big but charming with a nice cheminee and a nice
basement when I could put all my red wine. Few weeks later my wife and
my 2 girls came to join me. The winter was coming, we didn&#8217;t know what
to expect since so many people told us that the winter is pretty cold
here.<br>
I remember the snow start around November. It was a lot of snow!<br>
The winter was indeed pretty cold but fun with the girls making snow man&#8230;.<br>
One night I was talking with my wife front of a warm fire with a glass
of wine that I brought from France. It was delicious and peaceful. My
wife went to bed and I stay a little longer to finish my wine and just
listening the sound of the flame eating the wood.<br>
After few second it was very quiet and I could feel a cold air coming from my back.<br>
I turn around get up and check the door and window to be sure nothing
was open. But everything was close and no wind outside. I was not sure
what it was? But then I went to bed.<br>
A week later I was front of my computer at night when I heard a voice
coming from the kitchen. My first reaction was what the kids doing in
the kitchen in the middle of the night. So I went quickly in the
kitchen but nobody. I was going to check their bedroom upstairs when I
hear the same voice again from the kitchen. I turn around but nobody!
The room was cold! I went right away to bed. The next morning I asked
my wife if she didn&#8217;t go to the kitchen last night around midnight. She
didn&#8217;t.<br>
I told her what happened. But her answer was, maybe I drunk too much wine that night.<br>
I felt something was not right.&nbsp; And I wanted to know what the
voice was saying but I could not remember. The thing is I was certain
it was not in my head.<br>
So the next night I decided to stay in the living room longer but nothing happen.<br>
The spring was coming and we start to have outdoor fun with the kids.<br>
I didn&#8217;t hear any voice since few months.<br>
On a Friday night I was alone at home around 6pm. My wife and girls were out for shopping.<br>
I was reading a book about the life of Napoleon when I heard a voice
from the kitchen again. This time I went slowly to the kitchen and try
to look at it, as a spy. The voice was telling something like &#8220;I like
this house&#8221; when I start to look inside the kitchen at first, I didn&#8217;t
see anything but in fact something was fogy or milky.<br>
The voice was deeper coming front the ceiling and then in a second
being close to my hear telling my name &#8220;Jean-Pierre&#8221;, I step backward
and was very surprise and scared.<br>
I went to the living room and took the peace of iron stick from the cheminee.<br>
I went back to the kitchen and then I saw a whole milky female body well define.<br>
I was paralysed I didn&#8217;t know what to do. The woman was looking at me
in a peaceful manner. She starts to move toward the living room and
then disappears.<br>
I was so shocked that I stay without any reactions for a few seconds which was like an hour for me.<br>
I went in the kitchen and start to prepare the lunch looking every second around me.<br>
I was cutting the onions to prepare veal with a sauce normande, when I
saw on the corner on my eyes a glass floating in the air. I turn around
and 5 glasses was floating around and the cabinet&#8217;s doors were open. I
was petrified. I slowly reach a glass with my hand and put it on the
table.<br>
Since nothing seems armful I did that with other glasses.<br>
Then I panic and start to run outside of the house. A minute later my
wife arrived with the kids and saw me outside looking at the house.<br>
She came to me quickly and asked me what I was doing.&nbsp; I told her
that something weird happened but I&#8217;ll tell more when the kids will be
to bed.<br>
Later my wife was intrigued by what I just told her.<br>
She told me that she believed me but she need to witness these things also.<br>
Well I have no idea when these things will happen again.<br>
So we decided that we will try to stay together in any room of the house.<br>
3 days later after saying goodnight to the kids we were going
downstairs when we heard something falling on the floor coming from the
kitchen. I look at Sophie telling her with my hand not to talk. We went
on the kitchen and there the fogy milky thing was there. On the floor a
broken glass. My wife could see it. We stand there front of this
things; I know Sophie was very scared by holding and crunching my hand.<br>
The Voice start again telling us that was her home &#8220;it&#8217;s my home&#8221;.<br>
One plate from our lunch starts to float in the air and then come back to the original place.<br>
Then the room became very cold, I could see my breath coming from my mouth.<br>
I start to speak load to this thing telling this not her house anymore this is our house and she has to leave.<br>
After a minute everything was back to normal.<br>
We look each other completely shocked.<br>
I could not believe I talked to this thing.<br>
My wife start to cry but then she became calm and quiet. We went to the
living room. I went to pick up 2 glasses with Grand Marnier and black
chocolate from Belgium.<br>
We start to talk about the whole thing from the beginning.<br>
We didn&#8217;t know what to do. Should we move? Is this thing dangerous? How can we get rid of it?<br>
I was trying to figure out what could be a rational explanation for this.<br>
I am very skeptic about these ghost stories but I have to admit that was a very strange thing that we witness.<br>
I was also kind of happy that my wife could see it. I was not the only one.<br>
After an hour we decided to go on internet and see if we can find
something about this kind of stuff. We could fine some information but
nothing which could make us more comfortable.<br>
Next day I left earlier form work and join Sophie to the local library to look at the books.<br>
One book was pretty interesting &#8220;how to live with Ghost&#8221;. In this book
I could read that it&#8217;s good to be strong and show to the ghost that I
am the boss and I should tell him that it&#8217;s my house and he has to
leave. I realized I just did that when we saw the ghost.<br>
Since, we didn&#8217;t get any dramatic experiences, sometime cold spot or noise coming from nowhere.<br>
We still live in this house in 2006 and are very happy, even we may have an extra guest time to time.<br>

Haunting<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Aallbritten@wmconnect.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Kentucky The little brown house sits on the right hand side and has
been said for many years to be haunted. While living there, many family
members have reported things being thrown down the attic stairs, a cold
feeling of being watched by something hostile, heard their name called
by an unseen being, and have been touched on the shoulder. Children
have been reported to stand in their cribs in the bedroom, crying and
pointing to the window. People who were not family members have
reported items being moved and reappearing later in the original place
they were left. Dogs bark at the house after dark and sometimes lights
are seen reflected in the attic windows, although there is no longer
electricity to the house. Renters have experienced hostile feelings and
no one ever stays. It seems that every renter who stays for a length of
time will experience the dissolution of his/her relationship and
violent feelings/actions towards their loved one. Meaning: The feeling
in the house is one of hostility that eventually affects the people
living there, turning them on each other until they move away. In the
surrounding fields, green lights are reported which occur in the Fall
and the Spring of the year. If you get into your car and try to reach
the lights, they disappear before you can get close to them. In the
house across the street from the brown house, the owner reports that
she can stand on her deck and see the lights and the dogs will bark and
howl at them. When a car comes towards the lights, they descend and
disappear. Also, in the house across the street, heavy bootsteps have
been heard walking down the hallway. The owners' cat reacted to the
sounds and followed them down the hall to the bathroom. Also, in the
house across the street, feeling of being touched, being smacked on the
leg, hearing noises all through the house, dogs barking each night
after sundown and growling on the porches at nothing. Voices heard
whispering into your ear while you are sleeping, waking you up from a
dead sleep. WARNING: Private Property/Guard Dogs.<br>

I remember when I was about 12years old, and I lived in an old 3 story
house in bonneylake washington, and I have 3 siblings that lived with
me at the time..well I had my own room with 2 single beds..my sister
had her room across from me down the hall..well my 5year old niece was
spending the night and she stayed in my spare bed..it was about 2:00am
and the lights were out but the door was open..so you could still see a
little bit of light..well i woke up to this very chilling feeling like
it was winter and the window was open, but the thing is it was summer
and my window was shut, anyways I looked up and saw a little girl
sitting on the other bed looking at me, where my niece was sleeping..
thinking it was my sister I told her to go back to her room and stop
bothering me..at that time she would'nt move nore say anything I
remember that the girl had very long hair, and my niece or my sister
had short hair ..well I got out of bed and turned the light on, and the
girl disapeared, then I ran into my sisters room and she was fast
asleep..I know it was'nt her playing a prank cuse she would have
started laughing..that was only one of the minor things I have
encountered in my life..the other stuff would freak you out..<br>

Hackworth House, Tuscumbia, AL<br>

<br>
My family bought this house in the 1970's and had it remodel and
updated.&nbsp; One morning, about 3:00 AM, in the morning, I saw
someone pass by my bedroom doorr,&nbsp; Mother had been ill the night
before and I stayed awake to see if she was OK, but she didn't go back
to bed. I looked all through the house and couldn't find anyone.&nbsp;
She said that she had not been up in the night.&nbsp; Right after that
we started hearing noises.&nbsp; The front door unlocking and relocking
and no one there.&nbsp; The front porch swong, would swing and no one
was there, then stop as if someone stood up.&nbsp; My little dog would
stand and bark at an empty corner or door where there was no
there.&nbsp;&nbsp; We started talking to Mrs. Hackworth.&nbsp; When we
would leave, we would tell her to look after the house.&nbsp; Not one
piece of paper, box, anything was ever missing from the outside of the
house.&nbsp; i do not know if the people that live there now has ever
seen her but I sorta think that she is there just looking after that
house.&nbsp; I am the only one that saw her but we all heard her.<br>

Ghostly Sightings in Montague MI.<br>
<br>
By: knappar1@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
The following story is of great interest and takes place north of the
small town of Montague, MI. in a very old place known as Mouth Cemetary
(Montague's Mouth Cemetary is listed in your directory; I discovered
this three years after my own sighting). Mouth Cemetary is one of the
oldest known cemetaries in the area. It is known to be a very haunted
place, and therefore attracts those interested in the paranormal.
Myself with several friends went out to this place about three years
ago on devils night. We went out there to get a good Halloween scare.
The cemetary is surrounded by a black iron gate. In front of the
cemetary is a two-track and a small clearing in the forest ideal for
parking two or three cars. So my friends and I parked our cars in this
small clearing. Two of my friends got out and were walking in the
forest behind the cars because they thought they heard something. I got
out of my car with my friend Tony, we were standing in front of our
cars facing the cemetary entrance. Tony and I were talking, when he
nudged my arm and pointed out toward the cemetary. He said, "looks like
someone is out there holding a candle". I look up to see what appears
to be a candle circling around a particular grave marker. Out of
curiosity, the two of us walk toward the entrance. When we got closer,
we could see a baseball-sized ball or "orb" of orange light revolving
around this one grave marker. It was not a candle, and no one was
holding it up-it just hovered in mid-air. It kept circling around the
marker; we also noticed that it lit up the ground underneath it. My
friend said, "lets walk toward it to see what it does". Having
reservations about this but not wanting to look cowardly, I obliged. We
walked toward the grave marker near a tree in the front. When we got
within thirty feet of the grave, the orb quit circling and hovered to
the right of the grave. As we approached, the orb floated away. We
walked faster, it floated away faster. It would not let us get closer
to it. Toward the back of this cemetary there is a small hill that
descends downward into a treeline. This orb went over the side of the
hill. We stood at the top of the hill and watched as the ball of light
disappeared into the treeline toward Old Channel Rd. Never seen
anything like it. My friend and I still talk about it to this day. Just
last week I found the shadowlands website, looked up Michigan and found
Montague. Mouth cemetary was mentioned. It then mentioned orbs, which I
found rather interesting. It also helped corroborate my own tale. In
addition to ghostly sightings, there is also a local legend handed down
over the years about a haunted chair known as Sadoney's chair. Local
legend has it that on certain nights one can see his ghost sitting in
the chair over looking the lake. <br>

Weird Story<br>
<br>
By: racer541@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Well, this one is a weird one I tell ya.&nbsp; I live in Coos Bay, OR
and one night my friends and I were coming home from the beach.&nbsp;
It was a clear night around 45 degrees at 11:30 PM at night.&nbsp; We
were driving on a road near Charleston, OR just south of Coos Bay
called Libby Road.&nbsp; Libby Road is a curvy and winding road with a
30 mph speed limit and increasing to about 55 mph.&nbsp; This 6-7 mile
road had many traffic accidents and deaths since the opening of the
road.&nbsp; This one night we had 3 cars going back to our meeting spot
in Downtown in Coos Bay.&nbsp; We were about 2 miles until the end of
Libby Road when my friend in front of me all of a sudden slowed
down.&nbsp; We had walkie talkies on and were talking to each
other.&nbsp; All of a sudden my walkie talkie gets a lot of static as
my friend in front started slowing down.&nbsp; Just before we slowed
down a mile down the road I saw a mist of fog roll across my car.&nbsp;
I was kinda weirded out by that cause it was a clear night.&nbsp; So
after my friend slowed down we went to our spot and of course my walkie
talkie started working again.&nbsp; We all got out of our cars and I
asked my friend why he slowed down.&nbsp; He said that he saw a figure
of a child standing on the side of the road.&nbsp; I was getting kinda
spooked.&nbsp; I said that it was 11:30 at night and all kids are in
bed.&nbsp; He said that the figure had blondish hair and was dark
looking.&nbsp; I asked him what color was his eyes and he told me that
he could not see them.&nbsp; He also told me that the driveway where
the child was near was dark and had no lights in the driveway.&nbsp; So
we were talking and my friend told me that one of his childhood
friend's had died there from a drunk driving father who had crashed his
car and his friend had died.&nbsp; Had all the same features that were
described.&nbsp; I told him that when he saw the "ghost" that my walkie
talkie was getting static.&nbsp; So my friend that was in front of me
also had his 2 year old child with his girlfriend in the car.&nbsp; I
asked him if it was a reflection of his child but he said no it couldnt
cause there was no oncoming traffic.&nbsp; I was travelling right
behind him when he slowed down and he asked me if I saw anything and I
told him that I didnt see anything but the fog that rolled across my
car.&nbsp; So we were wanting to go back and see if he was still
there.&nbsp; But we freaked out.&nbsp; So we decided to tell ghost
stories of things that have happened in our town.&nbsp; So if anyone
wants to see some paranormal stuff, come to Coos Bay/North
Bend/Charleston, Oregon.&nbsp; We have the Tioga Hotel, the Charleston
Bridge, McCollough Bridge, and other places that are haunted here.<br>

Ghost Stories<br>
<br>

<br>
First of all I to say that I really enjoy your site. . .The ShadowLands is excellent. . .<br>
To my story where do I need to begin is the question for me. . .<br>
Well when I was three years old my family and I lived in a rented brick
house. . .that had a huge pecan grove behind it (since then I believe
the pecan grove is now gone). . I remember very well I did not like
this pecan grove something evil lurked in that area. . the utility room
always stayed bone chilling cold no matter what the season was. . the
people we rented from were a little strange as well. . .I didn't want
to be around there kids at all and I surely did not trust the man (our
land lord). . .<br>
One night, at the time my sister was just a baby and she slept in a
crib near my parents bed and I slept in another room, well anyways my
mom was awakened by something touching her leg. . .as she looked over
at my sisters bed she realized that there was something small but very
defined standing on the end of her baby bed. . My mother being a
Christian automatically knew what she was looking at. . .this spirit
was not a good spirit whatsoever. . .so she called out in the name of
Jesus for this thing to leave and it did. . .I have often wondered what
ever happened to it because I was left alone in my own room. . .<br>
This by far was not the only experiences I have to share. . .but the most recent one happened back in 1999. . .<br>
I was still living with my parents at the time and we lived in a house
next to a church where my father preached. . .well one night I was
sound asleep (I am a very hard sleeper no joke I could sleep through
hell itself) well that night something shook me awake and I rolled over
to my left side where there was a window where a outside night light
was shining through and there in my room by the window stood a small
black lady wearing a pair of glasses from the old days. . .she had on a
yellow flowered dress and a bible in her hand. . .she smiled. . .by
this time in my life I was not to easily to be startled by such because
well most of my life I have had to deal with such rather I wanted to or
not. . .but nevertheless as I looked at her I said "God if this is of
you thank you if not in the name of Jesus Christ leave me alone"&nbsp;
I rolled back over and went to sleep that night with not an ounce of
fear. . .later on I told my father about this and he told me that some
of the local church members had told him that years and years ago there
was a black settlement there and the whites runned them off or
something of that extent I have a feeling it was horrible whatever
happened. . .any how several other people have seen this woman as well.
. .<br>
Well just thought I would compliment you on your site and share just
the tip of the iceburg about my life and the spirit world. . .<br>

Ten years ago a large group of friends and I went to this friend's house at the beach.<br>
There were many rooms in the house and many people, but we were all the same age (around 19).<br>
The night we arrived two of my friends went to their room to get some
coats, and were surprised to find a grown man going through their
backpacks. They looked at each other not knowing what to say, and when
they looked back at their backpacks no one was there. They told me this
story many years after it happened, when I told them my experience in
the house during that same trip.<br>
I had woken up very early one morning (everyone else was asleep) and
had decided to take a tour of the house. I was looking at a map which
was hanging on a wall. Suddenly I sensed that there was someone
watching me, and from the corner of my eye I saw a man leaning against
a table, kind of checking me out. The house and street were totally
silent, so I would totally have heard anyone moving close to me.<br>
My heart was pounding fast, and my feet and hands got very cold and my
mouth went dry. I gathered courage, closed my eyes for a split second
and turned to face the man. There was no one there!<br>
I was right next to the front door, so I went out into the garden to
gather my breath and get some sunlight, because I was shivering.<br>
I stayed outside, in my pijamas, until others woke up and started to circulate. <br>
I later found out that the man who had built the house had also died
there, and that many people had seen him and not even my friends who
were boys liked to sleep alone in the rooms or spend time by themselves
in the house.<br>

Hello. I have&nbsp; lived here all my life in this small town of
Godley. My parents brought this land years ago,since then we have had
numereous tales to speak of. In my trailer, which Dont think its the
actual trailer thats haunted as the spot. We have old coal mines all
around our area. The spirits have been described as a old fisherman as
little kids described.From hearing people walking in the hallways. My
tv gets the channel changed all the time,which anymore I just laugh at
it. My sister lives next door in a trailer also and has had different
things happening. and where I grew up in my mom and dads house,use to
hear walking at night when no one was awake. I dont feel afraid with
these or this spirit, I just say hello to them and aknowledge that they
are around. I dont know if its possibly a old coal miner from years
past or some passed on relatives.<br>

Florida Home<br>

This is a house we rented&nbsp; in Lynn Haven Florida.<br>
We lived there for approximately 2 years.&nbsp; Over that time we had many encounters.<br>
The house was built in the 1920's and we discovered had suffered a fire at one time.<br>
It began with hearing two men talking, their voices were muffled like
they were far away.&nbsp; We checked outside to see if neignbors were
talking at first, but all was quite outside and only three of us lived
in the house.&nbsp; My son and I heard on several nights what sounded
like a ball bouncing off the roof. There would be three bumps on the
roof and it would happen over and over, when no one was outside our
house.&nbsp; My husband felt the present of two cold presences brush
against him one night in the master bedroom.&nbsp; One of the more
interesting incidents was I was in the bathroom brushing my hair with
the bathroom door open and my husband was sitting on the bed.&nbsp; Our
closet door opened, a clothes hanger flew out of the closet barely
missing my husband and landed at his feet.&nbsp; A friend of my son's
stayed one night and he told my son quiet shaken that their was an "old
man" standing in the hallway. I have several dreamsickles (little
angels) in a locked curio we would often find them turned around facing
backward.&nbsp; The final encounter was my husband was in bed early one
morning, and I had left for work.&nbsp; He felt someone roll off of the
bed, sit up and then get up off the bed, he thought nothing of it at
first think it was me, until he realized I had left over an hour before
for work.&nbsp; He was ready to move at that time.<br>

On Feb. 23, 1999, while working on the house&nbsp; that we bought in
Kitchen's Mills, SC..and moving dirt, I was nearly killed after leaving
the driver's seat of my Back-Hoe-Front- Loader and run over. My family
and I&nbsp; were living in AZ at the time and came to SC about twice a
year to visit friends and spend time in our home town. We bought this
house to have a place to come to.<br>
I remember hitting something, probably a root, while moving a large
pile of dirt. I left the tractor seat and came to myself on the ground
with my right leg caught in the chassis of the tractor, broken just
above the ankle joint. I tried but failed to get myself loose. ( It was
like you see in the movies everything slowed down and I had time to
evaluate the situation and I try to get loose, but I could not.) I then
tried to move with the forward motion of the tractor, to no avail.<br>
I evaluated the situation and came to the conclusion that I was going
to be run over, although this all happened in a few seconds, it seemed
like a long time, I even had time to try to avoid the hydraulic
stabilizer foot that were coming for my chest. It all happened in slow
Motion.<br>
Accepting the fact that I was about to possibly die, I asked God to please help me through this ordeal and he did.<br>
I watched as the large rear tire and the hydraulic stabilizer came over
me, crushing and dislocating&nbsp; my left hip and breaking several
ribs, crushing my pelvis and destroying my de-sending colon,
dislocating my right hip and essentially pulling my right foot off. <br>
The tractor ran into a large cedar tree and shut it's self down. ( now
comes the good Part. ) I never lost consciousness, looking back at the
pile of dirt I saw a middle aged man with black straight hair and dark
olive skin. He had what looked like a two or three day growth of black
beard and wore a black and red flannel shirt with thin yellow striped
between the large black and red squares.<br>
There was no verbal conversation between him and me, It was mental, He
said to me,"God would not let me kill you but look at all of the pain
that you are in." I then remembered what my daughter had asked of God
when she was injured while giving birth to my grandson Richie, "Dear
Lord please take away enough pain that I can bare this ordeal."<br>
The pain level dropped to a point of tolerability and then he was gone.( I get some strange looks when I share this experience.)<br>
I laid flat on my back for over six months in the Augusta, Georgia
Veterans Hospital and I was the only person that didn't think that I
was going to die.<br>
The next incidence happened about two years later in the summer of 2001.<br>
I was in the back of this same house putting away tools at dusk dark. I
heard from behind me, A Strong Caucasian voice say,"GOOD EVENING," I
turned and said, "good evening," no one was there. Talk about getting
spooked? I was.<br>
I went into the house and asked my wife Rachel if she had heard
anything, she said,"no she had not heard a thing". I called the Aiken
county sheriff's office and when the officer came out we explained what
had happened, there were no foot prints etc., The officer told us to
keep an eye and ear out and left.<br>
Many people say that I am a very lucky man, I say I am a very blessed man.<br>

Ball Cemetery<br>
<br>

My friends and i are intimately familiar with Ball cemetary... On a
previous visit my friends and i being skeptical ventured out there...
it is very eerie and gloomy, day or night. As we proceeded into the
grave yard nothing appeared and we took it as a joke, but as we
proceeded out there was a severe shaking that overcame the car, side ot
side... nothing like a flat tire but as if someone were rocking the car
back and forth. We pulled over to investigate and the car was in superb
condition, but in the dust covering the vehicle were the handprints of
small children... Most people dont belive us, But i went out with
another group of people to see if it would happen again and no such
rocking occurred, however the next morning my friend who was driving
was washing her rims off, and looked up and saw handprints all over the
glass... We never told her about the first incident... Also we have
heard from people if you walk the four corners you can see orbs and
spirits rise and swirl... But it is indeed a very chilling place<br>

Hello whoever's reading this. i am not a skeptic, but rather someone
who tries to look at a situation from every possible angle. ever since
a was a child i have believed in 'spirits' and with good reason. i have
encountered many occurances in 3 of the 4 houses i have lived in (I say
3 because i was too young to remember my first home), voices, bumps in
th night, object and appliances moving and turning themselves on. one
time when i was very young i woke up one morning, walked onto my
landing and saw to green eyes, clear as day, staring at me from the
shadows. instantly something clicked in my mind and i realised what
they belonged to . before i could move they started moving towards and
i saw that they actually belonged to a rather thick set dog. all the
time i knew that this wasnt 'freindly' and wanted to escape allthough i
was to scared to move. the dog was the same colour as the dobermans
that i had owned but had died and the one that was currently sleeping
in my mothers room. at first i thought it was my dog but as i stared i
noticed it was more like a rotweiller as it was so chunky. it sped up
as it approached me and finaly broke out snarling and barking as it
leaped through the air at me. god knows how but i managed to run into
my mothers room and hide beneath the duvet covers. Now..... here comes
the logic, this happened many ears ago so long ago infact that i have
started to doubt whether or not it actualy occured. the fact that i
knew exactly where the dog was going to move leads me to beleive that
it could have been a lucid dream, but ive never had a lucid dream
before let a lone one so real and this feeling of knowing what is
coming next is one that i often get either with these 'encounters' or
just say spilling a drink. it could be something similar to the what
people mean when they say that accidents are in slow motion. and finaly
it is just so clear i remember every detail and i always have. this was
actualy my second house and every body from my grandfather to my
skeptical step father experienced things, then i moved and things
quietened down. eventualy i started getting a similar feeling of
presences and things and even thought i saw a tall dark hooded figure
watching me, standing directly above me as i sat in my living room. one
day i came home from school feeling worse for wear, my head hurt and i
felt dizzy so decided to nap on the coach in the living room and wait
for my mother to come home from work. we had been have then kithcen
wich joined onto the room done out and so the door was just proped
against the hole also we were using the kitchen door as our main
entrance. so i lay sleeping on the couch and suddenly am woken by the
noise of the front kitchen (back) door being opened, to my deberman who
barks at any noise or voices who arent me or my mother, starts running
around the room wagging its tail and jumping at the proped up door. so
i assume my mother must be homeand start calling to her 'hello mum' to
which i get no reply just the continuing shufflin and banging around in
the kitchen. then i decided to wait fo he to come in because she
obviousy couldnt hear me, the next thing i knew i was waking up on the
couch, 'god' i thought ' i drifted off' so i got up and started to find
my mum but could not see here any where, i searched the whole house
buut no one was home and everthing was where i left it and the dog had
gone back to bed. She must have gone out again so i sat and waited some
more. <br>
eventualy she came through the door in her work uniform and saying
hello, when i saked why she had gone out agin she told me she had nver
been home. <br>
once again all logic and my state leads me to beleive this event didnt
happen, but it was so real. after wards when i told my mother she told
a story about her which was quite similar and which i will put below
for any body who would like to read it. after this i beleived that the
presence must have caught up with us or i was having very real dreams
which i never have. <br>
later my girlfreind would tell me that when she was sleeping in one of
our spare rooms she had been woken during the night by what she thought
to be my mother getting the dirty washing. she soon realised that i
couldnt have been my mother shuffling around next to her because it was
the middle of the night and mum was in bed she quickly turned around to
see nothing there. my mother as often told me of a person who quite
frequently visits her during te night and sits on her bed. so has my
grand mother, she also told me that shortly that after her mother died
she was cleaning her house and saw her mother walking down the street
to her house, she ran to put the kettle on for her but realised she had
passes away. she was instantly over come with a feeling of calm and
reassurance and has never felt upset towards her mother since.<br>
there have been times when me and my freinds have been forced to sleep
with the light on because we can hear something moving around in the
other empty bedrroms in the house. since then we have moved and hae
experienced only on thing. my girlfreind described seeing a tall dark
hooded figur standing over her bed. i had not told her of the one i had
seen. my mother as spoken of how she believes that it is a gaurdian
watching over us because she has never felt threatened by it and also
because a very reliable fortune teller descibed and old irish woman who
watches over us. i dont know what to think as i have felt both
threatened (due partly to being slapped on the head by<br>
something) and also comfortable with the presence. things have happened
that i could quite easily explain, a curtain swinging on its own for
example which turned out to be the hot air rising up from a radiator
below it, and other things have been harder to understand like a toy
gun firin at me without being touched. draw your own conclusions.<br>
For anybody else who would like to hear my mothers story.....<br>
she was babysitting with a freind one evening. the child was in bed and
my mtothers freind had gone to the shops for some reason or another
leaving my mum alone. my mother locked the door behind her freind and
left the key in, she then watched television for half an hour but was
interupted by her freind banging on the door. she walked over and tried
turning the key which was stuck for some reason. ' hold on ' she told
her freing whos banging was becoming more and more frantic. my mother
really began to panic as she treid to get thedoor unlocked but failed.
she urged her freind to stay calm and hold on but the banging
persisted. she started asking her freind if she was ok but recieved no
answer, she asked for he freind to say anything but got no reply. she
told her freind that she wouldnt open the door until she got an answer
but the only answer she got was more banging. all of a sudent the
rappingstopped and the flat was calm. 'hello?' my mum asked but still
got no rply, she checked the child and then went back to the
television, after a few minutes there was another banging at the door
but it was accompanied by her freing quite calming asking her to open
up. my mother walked over and had another attempt at truning the key.
it tuned smoothly and the dor opened with out a problem, he freind came
in, they locked the door again and my mother bgan to tell my freind all
about what had hapened.<br>
