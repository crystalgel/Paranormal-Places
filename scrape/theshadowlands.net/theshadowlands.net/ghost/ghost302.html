a week later my daughter came to me again in broard daylight saying " mummy
come into my room the girl is in there ".&nbsp; I followed my daughter
into the room i didnt see anything but the room was absolutely frezzing
cold ( summer at the time ).&nbsp; Then one day my daughter had a friend

<p><b>4 Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: vicious_kitten_16@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Crawford Rd. in yorktown VA</b>
<br><b>Last Saturday about 2:00am in the morning me and a few of my friends
decide to go down Crawford Road. We go down this road often looking for
something to happen, but we dont really have much luck.. except for this
night. We were driving down this road and well we got to the bridge and
2 of the guys I was with got out and wanted to stand under the bridge so
they did.. Of course we were scared there were 2 of us left in the car..
so we kept driving.. the drivers side window started rolling down by its
self.. and she tried to get it to go back up but it wouldnt, then at that
moment something tried to grab at her arm. We screamed!&nbsp; So then we
rushed to the end of the road and we got the 2 guys that were with us.
The 2 guys saw a ghost in white on the bridge stairing a them. They were
scared! We got of the road and decided to double back and go back down
the road.. We all look on top the bridge and we see the ghost standing
there in the middle. We leave.. and we still go back. Another occurance
we had was when we went down crawford and we parked under the bridge at
1:00am at night.. the car was off.. no lights were on.. nothing! We stayed
til 1:10am then we were like " well nothings going to happen so lets leave"
so we started the car and when we were pulling off we hear *BOOMBOOM* on
top the car.. you could feel it too. We hurried and left we were all scared.
Now for some reason the car is messing up.. every car we take down that
roads gets messed up.</b>
<br><b>The Moore House in yorktown VA</b>
<br><b>We heard some stories about the Moore House.. so we decide to check
it out. We get there its about 1:00am in the morning. Wr get out and walk
to the house. We stand in the back yard facing the back of the house..
We look in the window and there its a white eye-like figure. We see its
move about the window. Then we run off screaming. Then we get the courage
up to go back and it wasnt there. We just wait a few and it appears again.
We were Scared! We walked around seeing many shadows and we go in to the
graveyard and we heard cannons going off. We saw a white figured walking
about the side yard. We get scared and leave.</b>
<br><b>The Nelson House in yorktown VA</b>
<br><b>We heard of the stories of the Nelson House so we check it out.
We go in to the yard scared cause of the stories we heard. We look at the
shades in the house opening and closing every so often. I go and knock
on the door and something knocked back at me. I run off the 7 ot 8 steps.
We go into the garden and we walk the paths that are in it. I felt something
grabbed my arm twice.. I then said "what is that" and it wasnt anyone that
was HUMAN.. it got cold very cold and it grabbed my arm once again and
I said "Stop it now" and it did it again so I said "Please stop" and then
it stopped. Then my friend saw a soldier hold a rifle way in the back garden.
The garden is very cold.. even in the summer. My friend looked up while
we were in the garden and saw a man with a rifle on its back in the top
window on the side of the house. We leave.</b>
<br><b>Cohoke Crossroads in west point VA</b>
<br><b>We drive down this dark dark road. We see the railroad tracks and
we park on the railroad tracks.. car turned off and no lights on. We are
face the road. We sit there patiently waiting for a light to appear we
sit there for 20minutes and the we see a light way down the tracks that
seems to be floating down the tracks towards us. We are then starring trying
to see if the light is getting closer.. it does start getting closer and
it when it gets right beside the car it fades out and disappears. Then
the car rolls off the tracks. We figure that the ghost light pushed us
off the tracks because it was scared we were gonna get hit by the train
like he did. So we think that this ghost is a nice ghost. We then leave
and go home.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Being Watched</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mattfron1988@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>ok, im not sure what im saying here is an actual haunting or whatever,
but it is all true.</b>
<br><b>the first part of my story has to do with my old home where i lived
when i was younger. it is extremely old and has been standing for over
100 years. normally it was perfectly fine nothing out of the ordinary,
but every now and again when i was alone i would get the overwhelming feeling
that i was not alone in the house. often i would have no reason to be frightened
but still i would get this strong sense of malevolance or just a funny
presence. other times i would have just gotten into bed and i would feel
some sort of animal jump upon my bed and walk around. at first i would
think it was my cat but when i would turn on the light and look nothing
was there, and i slept with my door shut to keep my cat out. other times
i would here shuffling in my room or get the sense that something was leaning
over me... i never had the nerve to turn around i would just pull the covers
over my head until i felt whatever it was leave, or fade away.</b>
<br><b>one night i had my door open and was watching it before i shut off
my light and the door slammed shut as i watched it. it looked like someone
slammed it. i did not have any windows open so it could not have been a
draft. also, idont know if this means anything but i never dreamed in that
house. i know sometimes you dream and can't remember it but i literally
went to sleep and woke up and i never slept well. my mother always complained
of noises such as scratching or the like&nbsp; and strange lights in her
room as she tried to sleep. all this was troubling but the most terrifying
part wasn't in the house at all. behind our house was a large planted forest
of pines at was bordered by state forest on three sides. i liked to explore
and walk the trails in the woods as i felt a very strong presence or awareness
there. im not sure when that awareness began to change but slowly the forest
felt colder and had a strong malevolent presence almost as soon as you
walked in it. a few minutes after entering a light mist covered the ground&nbsp;
and the strong sense of fear made me run back to the house on many occasions.
i brought freinds and they too felt the presence and saw the mist. once
i tried finding the source of the feeling and it seemed strongest by an
old abandoned saw mill. once i tried to get whatever it was to leave and
shouted for it to go. the presence in the air pulsed and i was driven to
my knees the mill seemed to have a shadow cast over it and i prayed on
the spot. as i prayed i was able to stand and ran as fast as i could home.</b>
<br><b>that night whatever i had disturbed in the woods visited me in my
room. (i know it sounds cheesy but i was scared out of my mind) i grabbed
a cross that i had on my night stand and held it out as a talismen before
me. nothing happened for several minutes the "entity" didn't leave but
didn't seem to grow in power as it did in the woods. i prayed the entire
time and slowly the presencce ebbed and faded. about a year later we moved
away and the first night we spent in the house i had the best most restful
sleep ever and i dreamed vividly. lately i can't sleep again and i no longer
dream and if i do they turn to nightmares. there is no evil presence but
i at times feel like im not alone.</b>
<br><b>if someone can tell me if this is true or not or if you have had
similar experiences please email me at mattfron1988@yahoo.com. thanks!
and once again i am telling the truth.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Childhood Hauntings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ydnim@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Way back when I was in 3rd grade, my best friend at the time would
scare us all by saying that she was being terrorized by a 3 foot killer
clown named Chuckles. Well, not long after hearing her tales, I had two
experiences.</b>
<br><b>I shared a room with my 2 sisters, so to make room, my parents installed
2 bunk beds in the room. I slept on the top of one with my sister Jamie
below, and my sister Brandy slept on the bottom of the other, leaving the
top reserved for friends who wanted to stay the night. When I got scared,
I would crawl into bed with Brandy.</b>
<br><b>One night, I was sleeping down there when something starting tugging
at the blankets from the bottom of the bed. Brandy was snoring away beside
me, and we had no indoor pets. Unsure of what it was I screamed bloody
murder for my dad. He came in, turned on the lights, but all I saw at the
foot of the bed was a giant teddy bear. After not seeing anything else
that could have tugged the blankets, I begged him to leave the light on.
I put the cover over my head as soon as he walked out the door, and the
tugging began one more. I passed out from fright and did not wake up until
the next morning.</b>
<br><b>During the 2nd experience, which was only like a week or so later,
I was once again in the same bed as Brandy. This time, my older brother
Paul had gotten scared and was in the "guest" bed above us. We lay there,
listening to our parents play card games and watch "Saturday Night Live."
Suddenly, something started walking around the floor, practically stomping.
All 4 of us freaked and began screaming for our parents. They never came.
To this day, my mom swears that she never heard us scream and believes
that we're making the whole thing up.</b>
<br><b>Whatever it was, never bothered us again. Thank God!!!!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Big Fan of Hauntings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tinkerbelldust96@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have many ghost stories to tell from around here. I live in Hutchinson
Kansas and I am 16 years old. My favorite experience and the most terrifying
is of when I lived in a small one horse town called Abbyville when i was
7. Me and my family lived in a house right across the street from an abandoned
church. From my experiences I would gather that the ghostly aperitions
had come from that church.</b>
<br><b>The first strange happening from what I can remember was when i
was sleeping. I heard i strange noise comming from the bathroom that was
located right next to my room. The noise was a kind of scratching sound
mixed with a slight splashing noise. At that age I was fearless so I got
up to see what it was and of course nothing was there. That same noise
continued every night after that; I just learned to ignore it.</b>
<br><b>At a nother night while we were watching tv we could hear a tapping
noise on our glass table in the kitchen. When my mother would turn the
tv down the noise would stop and then continue when the tv was back up
again. That same night, as I remember perfectly, I was playing in my room
by myself. Suddenly there was a sharp pain in my lower back like something
had punctured my skin and I cried to my mother. There was blood everywhere.
It was running down my legs and mad a trail behind me as I ran. My mother
cleaned me up and calmed me down, but after the blood was cleaned off my
back she could not find any type of wound at all and the pain had stopped
completely. After that we could not get the blood stain out on the floor
in my room, ever.</b>
<br><b>After that bloody incodent my mother was terrified of that house
and her being some what of a ghost hunter herself, decided to take as many
pictures of that house as possible. When we got the pictures developed
we found a number of disturbing photos. Most of the pictures of my room
had one single red orb in certain parts of the picture. Also the red orb
appeared in 1 of the bathroom. Later on I decided that something terrifying
had happened to my mom while she was in my room sometime becuase she would
not go into it and would run past my door when she walked by and that must
have been her breaking point. She hired a priest to come bless the house
and even the priest seemed a little anxiouse to leave when he was done.</b>
<br><b>3 months later we moved out when we realized that our efforts had
failed. It seemed for a while that everything was fine, until my little
brother flew backwards out of his chair in front of everybody and the event
was followed by a high pitched yet faint scream that came from the back
of the house which we knew that no one was back there.</b>
<br><b>Today the church is gone and so is our house but I still get goosebumps
when i visit that town and have to ride past the place where the church
had been. I still cant believe that i used to play hide and seek in that
church.</b>

<p><b>Grandparents Farm</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: scottie_58@plateautel.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My grandparents farm, Southwest of White Oak, Oklahoma, was the scene
of some really strange occurences for me when I was a teenager. My great-grandfather
had been a spirit medium, but as far as I know, he died long before my
grandparents got married. On several occasions when I would spend the weekend
with them, I would sleep on my grandmother's sofa. Around 2:00 a.m., the
lights would come on by themselves, and the radio would begin to play.
This was in the early 1970's, and the local radio station went off the
air at 8:00p.m. every evening. Then the telephone would ring. I would get
up and answer it, and it would ring again with the receiver still in my
hand!!! Cars would come up the hill, which is still a dirt road to this
day, and suddenly vanish without a trace. My grandparents always had at
least 2 dogs and a bunch of chickens, all of which would raise cain if
a car came up the driveway regardless of what time of day. None of them
would make a sound. And the strangest thing of all was that my grandparents
would sleep through it! I would hear voices talking to each other, and
everyone would be asleep except me. I never stayed out there again after
the last time it happened. I could hear people calling my name, but no
one was up but me. I never told my grandparents because I didn't want them
to think I was crazy. But that house was spooky at night</b><b></b>

<br><b>Haunted High School</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ydnim@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In the fall of 2002, I was offered a job as a Residence Life Coordinator
for a private all-girl high school in San Antonio, which was operated by
one of the local universities. Essentially, the position was that of a
Dorm Mom. I do need to do a little set up for you.</b>
<br><b>One of my perks was an apartment on the floor. All of the my girls
and staff lived in traditional-style dorms; however, my room was an actual
apartment. If you entered my door you ended up directly outside my bedroom
door with a hallway running off to the right. That hallway led to my living
room, kitchen and bath area.</b>
<br><b>The residence hall itself was a giant L, with the entrance on one
end and my room at the other end of the L. At the end of my hall, was an
entrance into the high school. No one was ever allowed to enter or leave
that door for security reasons, so an alarm was installed on it. My staff
and I were the only ones with keys to the door. During the school day,
I would be the only person in the building with the exception of our cleaning
woman.</b>
<br><b>I had moved in over the weekend, but had yet to unpack more than
my bedding by the time I stayed the night for the first time. That night,
I crawled into bed, exhausted and nervous about starting the new job, mainly
because I had one other staff member and a third who was volunteering just
through my first weekend. I "awoke" to my door bounding open and a boy
of approximately 10 years of age jumping on the bed while another older
male watched from the door way. I woke up the next morning thinking that
it had to be a dream. Yeah, my door had been closed when I went to sleep
and was wide open in the morning, but I could have just not shut it tight
enough.</b>
<br><b>The following Tuesday, when I went to bed, I made sure that both
of my doors were shut tight. When I awoke, both stood wide open. After
the girls left for school, I let in the cleaning woman, who asked me to
make sure all the doors were left unlocked since she did not have a key.
I then left to run some errands, leaving her alone. I returned at about
3 p.m., literally minutes before my girls got home from school. My one
employee, Marissa, had been out all day and wouldn’t return until closer
to 6 p.m. One by one, the girls trudged in, ready to change out of their
uniforms and go roam around the college campus. Each one came back to the
lobby where I sat waiting to check the girls in, and asked me to unlock
their doors. Every single door on the floor was locked from the inside.
As I had said before, the cleaning woman had no keys, and I had been the
only other person on the floor.</b>
<br><b>Two nights later, I once again found myself to be the only staff
member on the floor. Marissa had decided earlier that day that she would
move to another room because it had a private bathroom. She moved a couple
of boxes into the room, which was located at the corner where the two halls
intersected. She didn’t leave any windows open, nor had turned on the air
conditioner. When she left, she locked the door behind her, so that there
was no way anyone could enter. About an hour after she had gone, I sat
on the floor near her door talking to one of the high school girls, Yassi.
I was telling her about all the weird stuff that had happened to me in
the week I had been living there and how my friend Amanda, who used to
work for the university, said that people had complained that the floor
was haunted. No sooner had I begun telling my tales then Marissa’s door
began shaking as though someone was on the inside wanting out. Yassi screamed
and practically jumped into my lap. Out of fear, I began laughing nervously.
Yassi looked at me and screamed, "Why are you laughing?" I was so scared
that it was the only response my body made.</b>
<br><b>Other little events happened to me throughout the school year. Some
of my girls would call me mom, and after they had gone to sleep, I would
hear a voice say, "Mom." Each time I heard it, it sounded like a different
girl. I would stick my head outside of the doors, but saw no one. There’s
no way someone could have run off, because I would have either heard them
run off, saw that their door was open or I would have heard them shut it.
That never happened.</b>
<br><b>In November, for a period of a couple of weeks, whatever it was
would flick the blinds in my living room. They were made of metal, so I
would hear little ping sounds. One night, I had been asleep, but it must
have been making a real racket, because I awoke screaming, "For the love
of God, stop it!" I never heard it again.</b>
<br><b>Twice, I had been in deep slumber and awoke to something terrifying.
It was almost as though someone had snapped their fingers, instantly waking
me up. The first time, my eyes flew open to see a large black shadow looming
at the end of my bed. I was instantly filled with fear, threw the blanket
over my head and began praying. I eventually fell asleep. The second time,
I had moved my bed from the foot of the bed being by the door to it facing
the eastern wall. I woke up, instantly filled with fear, and looked over
by my door to see a black cloud begin to form. Knowing that I would probably
see the shadow, I once again threw the cover over my head and began praying.</b>
<br><b>The other frightening event I had happened in late November or early
December. Marissa and I was asked to inventory the rooms on the first floor
of the building (we lived up on the third floor). Everything was okay until
we went into this huge storage room that was located directly under my
part of the hall. It was a dark intimidating room filled with all sorts
of junk. As soon as we managed to get the door open, Marissa said it didn’t
feel right. We closed the door and moved over to the laundry room that
was directly below my room. At the back was an S shaped hall. Each wall
was lined with huge storage cabinets. When I stepped into the hallway,
unimaginable terror took over. My knees shook and my chest tightened almost
like I was having a panic attack. I looked at Marissa; she didn’t feel
it but didn’t argue when I said, "Let’s get out of here."</b>
<br><b>Toward the end of the school year, my neighbor Cata and I began
having a similar event occur. At 12:30 a.m., I would hear 1 individual
knock on my bedroom door. No ne had entered my apartment—I know because
my door had a VERY loud squeal. The same thing would happen to Cata 5 minutes
later. She would open the door to find the hall quiet and empty.</b>
<br><b>As one of the girls was moving out, she heard a woman’s voice saying
a prayer in Latin. We had always heard that the floor was haunted by a
nun, but that was our first run-in with her. No one had mentioned the other
2 ghosts, but after everything that had happened and the stories I heard
from others, I knew that there had to be a little boy that liked to play
practical jokes and whatever that evil entity was.</b>
<br><b>After all the girls had gone home for the summer, I had the building
to myself. At first, I was really intimidated to be in a haunted building
alone, but after a while grew comfortable with my surroundings. But something
weird started happening at night when I went to bed. I’m the type of person
who cannot sleep without a cover over my feet. With such an active imagination,
I have always feared something grabbing my feet. As I would lay there on
my stomach trying to fall asleep, I would feel the covers flatten against
my legs and feel a depression form between them. Whatever it was would
then begin to lightly stoke my calves. Instead of being frightened, I felt
soothed and would usually fall asleep pretty quickly. I like to believe
that it was the nun helping calm me down with all the stress I was dealing
with in my personal and professional life.</b>
<br><b>Since then I’ve moved away and have not heard any of my girls complain
about ghosts. Funny, but I actually miss it. It was always exciting, and
I usually had a great story to tell the next day. 80)</b><b></b>

<p><b>Little Boy</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: babybuttergirl@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>In my town we have a park that is pretty big, behind it is a brick
house</b>
<br><b>that was knocked down and a shed. My bestfriend was talking about
something</b>
<br><b>about a boy who lived at that house that died in the river that
flows from a</b>
<br><b>creek in the center of the park. Me and my friend decided to go
down there</b>
<br><b>and see if any thing strange would happen. (Ghost hunting if you
will) We</b>
<br><b>weren't down there for that long and the whole time I had the feeling
like</b>
<br><b>something was watching us so I told my friend I wanted to go back.
(I forgot</b>
<br><b>to mention this but along the side of the river and tree grew outward</b>
<br><b>instead of up, this is a key part of my incounter.) We started to
walk back</b>
<br><b>when I felt some dirt slide from under my foot. I look down when
I started</b>
<br><b>to hear a crackling noise and noticed that the tree down there was
breaking</b>
<br><b>off and started to drift down the river. I was a little freaked
out about it</b>
<br><b>and started to move faster when my friend warned me not to run.
I was pretty</b>
<br><b>scared and when I looked back I could see that there was a little
boy</b>
<br><b>dressed in a green shirt and faded blue jeans. As soon as I turned
around it</b>
<br><b>ran behind a tree, I thought is was my imagination when I started
to hear a</b>
<br><b>faint crying and a little boy screaming for his mommy like he thought
that</b>
<br><b>one of us was his mother. The farther we got from the house the
louder we</b>
<br><b>could here it. As soon as we got out of the woods we started running
towards</b>
<br><b>the other end of the park. We met up with one of our friends and
asked him</b>
<br><b>if he could hear the crying because we still could. He said he could
and we</b>
<br><b>left the park as fast as we could. Me and my bestfriend did go down
there</b>
<br><b>again and I did feel a presence but nothing happened. I've been
down there a</b>
<br><b>few times since, once in the middle of the night but I haven't heard
from</b>
<br><b>the little boy since then.</b><b></b>

<p><b>There has always been a history of hauntings in my grandmother’s
waterfront San Francisco Bay Area home.&nbsp; The most popular one is "the
romantic ghost".&nbsp; The house was originally the first home on the entire
block, built over 100 years ago.&nbsp; Then, as the century progressed,
more and more homes were built.&nbsp; Several different families had lived
in that house over the past 100 years.&nbsp; My grandmother acquired the
house in the mid 60’s.&nbsp; She bought it from a couple whose 18-year-old
son had been working on the roof, slipped, fell and tragically died the
year before.</b>
<br><b>When I was a child, my parents, siblings and I lived in that house
with my grandmother for a couple of years.&nbsp; I remember many times,
my parents would be at work, grandma would be out and all us kids were
sitting down in the living room, with Aunt Krissy watching us.&nbsp; We
were constantly hearing all kinds of footsteps and doors opening and closing
upstairs.&nbsp; You couldn’t walk anywhere in that house without feeling
like someone was following you.&nbsp; In the back bedroom, upstairs, there
is a trap door in the closet ceiling, which leads to the attic.&nbsp; We
never used the attic; it was the only untouched place in the whole house....
In fact, my brother is the only member of my entire family who has ever
been up there.&nbsp; Every now and then, someone would look in the closet
and the trap door would be slightly open.&nbsp; We would always close it,
but we kept finding it open again.</b>
<br><b>Many years later, when I was about 18, I had my first encounter
with "the romantic ghost".&nbsp; I came down to my grandmother’s house
for a visit during the summer.&nbsp; My two teenage cousins Nichole and
Amber were visiting there too.&nbsp; One night, I was getting ready to
go to sleep on the couch, out in the game room.&nbsp; Despite the fact
that I was born in the early 80’s, I have always loved 50’s and 60’s rock
and roll.&nbsp; I set the radio on an oldies station and snuggled down
into the couch, under the blanket.&nbsp; I started to nod off, but I jolted
awake when I felt something brush through my hair.&nbsp; I sat up and looked
around, but saw nothing.&nbsp; After a minute, I nervously laid back down,
keeping my eyes open.&nbsp; I was a kinda freaked out, so I tried to stay
awake as long as I could.&nbsp; However, the music slowly but surely began
to lullaby me back to sleep.&nbsp; I finally closed my eyes and drifted
off.&nbsp; A few minutes later, I actually felt someone kiss me!&nbsp;
I immediately sat up again and the feeling went away.&nbsp; I assumed the
old love songs must have been making me have strange dreams or something.&nbsp;
But then my heart jumped up into my throat when I felt it again!&nbsp;
Yes, it happened again, with me sitting up, WIDE awake!&nbsp; I screamed
and backed up against the arm of the couch.&nbsp; A couple of seconds later,
my grandmother came out of her room and flipped the light on.&nbsp; She
looked worried.&nbsp; She asked me what was wrong.&nbsp; I didn’t think
she would ever believe what had just happened to me, so I told her that
a big spider landed on me and I smacked it away.</b>
<br><b>The next night, I told my cousins Amber and Nikki about it.&nbsp;
I was shocked to hear that they had experienced the same exact thing, several
times, over the past few years!&nbsp; II asked my grandmother about the
young man, but she didn’t now much, except that he was 18 and he died.&nbsp;
So I decided to go down to the city library and check the old news papers.&nbsp;
After an hour of searching, I found&nbsp; his obituary.&nbsp; It said that
his name was Joshua and he was a bright young man, who was planning on
being a doctor.&nbsp; There was also a photo of him below.....He was pretty
handsome!&nbsp; Well, the "kiss" incident happened again, every other night
that summer, until I left.&nbsp; After hearing that it was a common occurrence,
I wasn’t frightened by it any longer.&nbsp; I actually thought it was kind
of sweet AND sad.&nbsp; A young man’s life ending so suddenly and now his
ghost lingers, his human contact and love life limited to an occasional
kiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If anything, I was a little flattered.&nbsp; Besides,
not to sound like a weirdo, but I have yet to meet a living guy who kisses
better</b>

<br><b>Freaky Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: abajac@hotmail.com]</b><b></b>
<p><b>A few years ago i used to live in an old trailor. My babysitter used
to</b>
<br><b>watch us all the time, her mom and mine were best friends. Alot
of freaky</b>
<br><b>stuff used to happen when we lived there. The Babysitter was spending
the</b>
<br><b>night with her two little brothers, one at the time was very young,
around 4</b>
<br><b>years old maybe. well she was tucking him in in my moms room, the
attic</b>
<br><b>entrance is in the ceiling. You have to pull a set of stairs out
of the</b>
<br><b>attic, well anyways, she looked up and made sure the light was off.
then</b>
<br><b>looked back up and a minute or so later and noticed light peeking
out of the</b>
<br><b>craks in the ceilng. She of course was freaked out, and left the
room to get</b>
<br><b>her other brother, and they all slept in the room, along with my
two other</b>
<br><b>siblings and I.</b>
<br><b>Another time she was watching us, there was a thunderstorm. we were
all in</b>
<br><b>my room at the time and we hear something crash, like glass breaking
on the</b>
<br><b>floor, so we went around the house and looked to see what had broke,
we</b>
<br><b>found nothing, and all the windows were closed. Freaky</b>

<br><b>New House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: neillmorr@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had several experiences throughout my life that I could only
describe as unexplainable, but generally they were isolated incidences
in friends homes, or once in a hotel room (whole other story). In one house
my family and I lived in though, there were ongoing unusual things happening
quite frequently, and here is a brief account of those things.</b>
<br><b>This house that we lived in my dad built from the ground up, when
he bought the property, it was part of an apple orchard, so obviously the
house has no prior tenants. It is far out in the country and my parents
considered it their dream home and we did as well. I was about 15 y/o when
we moved in, I have two brothers as well and one was 16 the other 19. The
first few incidents we all experienced, usually when we were home alone.
It was a three story house, and the front door located on the mid ground
level was this heavy mahogany wood. We would be home alone and clearly
hear the door open and close. It had&nbsp; a very distinct sound. It happened
to me twice and everyone else at least once. Sometimes at night, sometimes
broad daylight. We would get up to see who was home and there would be
noone there. On one occasion I even saw it briefly from the upstairs landing
and by the time I walked downstairs the door was&nbsp; locked!</b>
<br><b>This alone could be explained. On another occasion I woke up around
2 or 3 in the a.m. because I heard footsteps coming down the hallway, very
slowly and quietly starting from the stairs on down toward my room. My
first thought was my brother (who's room was across the hall) was trying
to sneak in from partying, so I quietly got out of bed to surpise him,
but there was no one in the hall, so I opened his bedroom door, and he
was standing by his bed in his boxers, obviously still groggy from sleep
about to punch me because he was awoken by the footsteps too, and then
as he saw the doorknob begin turning it really freaked him out. We were
so scared, we woke my parents and they checked the whole house for an intruder...nothing.</b>
<br><b>Another time my 16 y/o brother was taking a nap in his room after
school one day, when he said he felt as though somebody was attacking him.
He felt barely able to breathe as though a very heavy weight was on his
body, he said he tried to scream but couldn't. He said a quick prayer in
his head and the weight was lifted, but he couldn't deny the evil presence
he felt. I saw him just after this happened and he was very shook up, pale
and sweaty.</b>
<br><b>Another time me and my other brother were playing Monopoly until
the wee hours, we noticed throughout the game that we would roll the dice
and sometimes when we looked back at the dice they would be showing something
completely different. Well on one roll, we actually saw the dice roll over
on it's own. When this happened the dog who was sleeping on the floor beside
us got up and ran upstairs, needless to say we were right behing him.</b>
<br><b>The fire alarms&nbsp; were wired throughtout the house so that if
smoke was detected anywhere in the house all of them would go off. Our
entire family were pulled out of bed on about 3 occasions where in the
middle of the night or early dawn all the fire alarms would go off. We
all came running out of rooms thinking there must be flames or something
but there was never anything. My parents searched high and low and never
found the source. They even brought some inspectors in to see if there
were problems with the wiring. Nothing.</b>
<br><b>The final chapter in this story was that we all went out of town
for a weekend and when we came home, the house had burned completely to
the ground. They were never able to fully conclude the cause because the
damage was so extensive. All in all we lived there not even a year. We
talk about the strange things that happened there alot, but wonder how
it could be haunted since it was brand new? Maybe something happened on
the property a long time ago? I am 24 now and still feel unable to explain
any of it</b><b></b>

<br><b>Greystone</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: fanadfilms@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>In 1991, while working on a script with Seth , I</b>
<br><b>first heard of Greystone.&nbsp; His roommate (Jarred</b>
<br><b>), Toby&nbsp; and another guy (Max), left</b>
<br><b>Seth to have fun with a chick.&nbsp; They took me to</b>
<br><b>Greystone.&nbsp; At the time, you could get into the</b>
<br><b>grounds at night by hoping a two foot high stone wall</b>
<br><b>on the eastern side of the property (it's closed off</b>
<br><b>now).</b>
<br><b>When I got inside, without knowing anything of the</b>
<br><b>history of the place, I saw two amorphous figures</b>
<br><b>appear out of the darkness.&nbsp; Jarred and Toby went on,</b>
<br><b>but Max and I stayed where we were.&nbsp; I could not go</b>
<br><b>in.</b>
<br><b>In 1993, Seth, Kaela (his sister), Jarred and a couple</b>
<br><b>of others, went back.&nbsp; We actually walked the property</b>
<br><b>at night.&nbsp; As we were getting ready to leave, I saw</b>
<br><b>the same forms walking toward us on the southern</b>
<br><b>walkway.&nbsp; The figures walked past us as if we were not</b>
<br><b>there.</b>
<br><b>Later, a friend who knew the guards, got us an invite.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;We toured the place.&nbsp; We saw many strange things</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; I would tell that, but I have little time.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Shaking Bed</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: andrew.griffiths@ucd.ie</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well, this is a story from Dublin, Ireland. My experience began when
I =</b>
<br><b>was staying over in my sisters house doing a spot of painting and
=</b>
<br><b>decorating for a neighbour of hers two doors down. I was given the
back =</b>
<br><b>bedroom of my sisters house to sleep in for the three days. Her
house =</b>
<br><b>was built in the mid-1970's. The first night I was in bed I could
hear a =</b>
<br><b>noise in the room but could not figure out where it was coming from.
It =</b>
<br><b>room was dark.&nbsp; It's hard to describe it but this noise could
be heard =</b>
<br><b>as if something was moving around the room.&nbsp; One second you
would hear =</b>
<br><b>it, and then a pause and 2 minutes later again, the same noise.
At this =</b>
<br><b>point I sat up but could not see anything because the room was in
=</b>
<br><b>darkness. I could hear the noise coming from the corner of the room
and =</b>
<br><b>the next minute it would be to my right. Then my bed began to vibrate.
I =</b>
<br><b>began to think that I was going mad. How could a bed vibrate by
its own =</b>
<br><b>accord? I thought to myself. Was it the beating of my heart?&nbsp;
The =</b>
<br><b>simplest thing to do was to get up and put on the light but I have
to =</b>
<br><b>admit, yes, I'm a wimp and the idea of standing watching my bed
shake =</b>
<br><b>with the light on did not appeal to me. Eventually it stopped but
=</b>
<br><b>vibrated once or twice after that.&nbsp; I crawled under the covers
and hoped =</b>
<br><b>that what ever it was would take a hike. The next thing I heard
was the =</b>
<br><b>floor boards creaking outside of my door. The board creaked for
quite a =</b>
<br><b>while and I tried to rationalize what it was that could be causing
it. I =</b>
<br><b>eventually fell asleep with mental exhaustion. The following morning
I =</b>
<br><b>asked my sister if her husband had been up to the toilet during
the =</b>
<br><b>night and she said no. Her husband put it down to the wind blowing
the =</b>
<br><b>fence in the garden. I don't think so..this noise was in the house.</b>
<br><b>The following night I brought my sister's dog up to the bedroom
and =</b>
<br><b>nothing happened. Thank God. On the third night my girlfriend came
over</b>
<br><b>to stay and I suggested that it would be wise if she took the back
=</b>
<br><b>bedroom and that I would sleep on the sofa. I didn't tell her about
the =</b>
<br><b>shaking bed but I let her believe that my sister would not approve
of us =</b>
<br><b>sharing a bed together in view of the fact that we were not married.
I =</b>
<br><b>know, I'm cruel but I wanted to see if she experienced anything.
To my =</b>
<br><b>shock the following morning she came down the stairs and said "I
don't =</b>
<br><b>know what the hell is going on in that bedroom but my bed was shaking
=</b>
<br><b>a lot during the night"! I told that she was imagining things and
not to =</b>
<br><b>worry about it. At least it confirmed that I was not losing my marbles!
=</b>
<br><b>I always felt uneasy in that house. I wouldn't say that I'm tune
into =</b>
<br><b>the paranormal but I always felt a presence whenever I was in the
house. =</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The story eventually had a bad end as my brother-in-law dropped
dead on =</b>
<br><b>the kitchen floor with heart disease at the age of 42 a few years
later. =</b>
<br><b>My widowed sister eventually went to a medium who nothing of the
death =</b>
<br><b>of her husband and warned her that her house was evil and that she
=</b>
<br><b>should get out and no good would ever come to her while she lived
there. =</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Two years later I happened to be talking to two of my other
sisters and =</b>
<br><b>the subject arose on ghosts and I began the above tale only to be
=</b>
<br><b>interrupted by one of my sisters who informed me of the vibrating
bed in =</b>
<br><b>the back bedroom. I had never told them or anybody else for that
matter =</b>
<br><b>this story and it just went on to prove that I wasn't the only one
to =</b>
<br><b>have this experience.......</b><b></b>

<p><b>Real Life Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: paulsue@sbcglobal.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is SE. I have always been somewhat aware of another realm,
even as a child. There have been several strange and unexplained experiences
for me and my family but the most concrete have been since we moved to
a rural site where the area was originally established in the 1870's.</b>
<br><b>1.</b>
<br><b>On December 6, 2001 my Mother, daughter and I were sleeping in separate
rooms of the house.&nbsp; The security alarm was on and my husband was
at work. About 3:00a.m. in the morning, I was awakened by my Christmas
carousel playing loudly with all the red, green and yellow lights flashing
in the Living Room. The volume was turned up as high as it would go. We
had not played the carousel the day before. I ran into the living room
to check on my Mom and daughter who were staying in rooms on the other
hallway. I observed our Border Collie was running around barking in circles
in the Living Room and very agitated.</b>
<br><b>Mother quickly came to meet me, we were standing in the dark and
felt a presence as I tried to call my dog to my side and reassure her everything
was okay.&nbsp; I turned off the carousel, turned on the lights and realized
it was my birthday.&nbsp; I was quietly sad when I went to bed the night
before as I thought about my father who had passed away in 1998 and wished
so he could be with us that birthday.</b>
<br><b>As Mom and I talked about the wake up surprise, she said it is odd
and odder still you were born at 2:45a.m. in the morning.</b>
<br><b>All I could guess is Dad wanted me to know that he was aware it
was my birthday.</b>
<br><b>2. During the winter of 2002, I was home on a weekday. My husband
was working days and my youngest daughter was in high school. It was on
a Thursday and my Mom was to come stay with me for the weekend. I was watching
daytime soaps curled up in a blanket i n the chair in the large living
room.&nbsp; I heard a brushing noise, glanced up at the door-just in time
to see a small red and gold picture frame fly off the large stereo speaker
and over to&nbsp; hit the backrest (hump) in a loveseat which was several
feet away. I couldn't believe my eyes and after a few minutes I got up
and walked over to see which frame flew.&nbsp; The photo was of Mom and
was one of two matching frames with my parents when they were quite young.&nbsp;
I mulled over the situation as I realized there was no way the frame could
have fallen over because it would not have flown several feet.&nbsp; I
asked whoever threw the picture to not throw it again. To respect me and
my home. Nohing else happened that day. I was disturbed by it.</b>
<br><b>3. During the Winter of 2003, my Mom, Husband and daughter and I
were watching an interesting show on television.&nbsp; My Mom was sitting
at the dining room table watching the&nbsp; tv in the Living Room.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My daughter was on a loveseat in the living room and my husband and I were
in our matching chairs.&nbsp; I saw my daughter get up and walk down the
hall to the bathroom, then I observed her sit back down on the loveseat.&nbsp;
I returned my gaze to the television. I thought she got back up and was
obstructing my view of the tv for an instant and even moved so she wouldn't
block the tv. Then she didn't walk in front of my husband. Although I thought
it strange, I didn't say anything. A few seconds later my Mother put her
hand on my shoulder and in a thin voice said, did you just see what I saw.
Our daughter was looking straight at me too! I said you mean Jess bouncing
around in here in front of the tv. Once Jess sat down on the sofa, she
did not get up again. She and Mom confirmed this.&nbsp;&nbsp; We all saw
someone walk in front of us and disappear.&nbsp; Mother said she saw jeans.
a belt , very tall, a bare chest and dark hair. Later, after the chills
wore off, we all realized we saw a ghost. Our new house was built on land
near Towanda Kansas, which was settled in the 1870's.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Scary Face In The Window</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: benj@app-net.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; My parents house that I grew up in (long torn down now)
was sorta</b>
<br><b>spooked. It was said the house was built in the exact spot that
a</b>
<br><b>saloon/ cathouse was back in the 1800's. There had been a few killings</b>
<br><b>over the girls there, etc. I come from a family of eight children,
five</b>
<br><b>girls, three boys. They have all had their own odd experiences in
that</b>
<br><b>house but I will only tell you mine. One night my baby brother who
was</b>
<br><b>4yrs old and myself who was eleven, had to sleep on a couch in our</b>
<br><b>living room . The kind that makes a bed. My grandparents were visiting</b>
<br><b>and there was no room. I thought it would be fun sleeping on the
couch.</b>
<br><b>Not! My brother was closest to the window and I was lying in front.</b>
<br><b>Everyone was in bed and Dad had all the lights out. The only light
was</b>
<br><b>from the pole light outside. My brother fell asleep before me and
as I</b>
<br><b>was trying to get comfortable I rolled over to face the window.
There I</b>
<br><b>saw the scariest face looking straight at me. I will never forget
it if</b>
<br><b>I live to be 100! It had glowing red eyes, red flaming hair that
stuck</b>
<br><b>out in fiery wisps and it's mouth was open in an evil sort of smile.
I</b>
<br><b>could see its white pointed teeth, which seemed to have either bloody</b>
<br><b>gums or blood dripping down the teeth. I was so scared I couldn't
scream</b>
<br><b>or anything. It was as if I were paralyzed! My Dad had forgotten
to set</b>
<br><b>the alarm clock for work so he came into the living room with a</b>
<br><b>flashlight to set it. I wanted to tell my Dad to look at the face
but I</b>
<br><b>couldn't open my mouth. And the face was still smiling at me, baring
its</b>
<br><b>teeth! Dad went back to bed. I pulled the cover over my head and
just</b>
<br><b>lay there, scared stiff. Finally after what seemed like hours I
slowly</b>
<br><b>peeked out and&nbsp; it was STILL THERE! Now I started shaking my
little</b>
<br><b>brother so he would wake up. He wouldn't wake at first but I kept</b>
<br><b>shaking till he woke and he wanted to know why I woke him up. I
said</b>
<br><b>"Look at that face in the window!" He was&nbsp; right next to the
face and he</b>
<br><b>couldn't see it. He said he didn't see a thing. He fell back to
sleep.</b>
<br><b>It seemed the hideous face was smiling even bigger now with more
pointy</b>
<br><b>teeth showing. I pulled the covers over my head and stayed there
till</b>
<br><b>morning. I told what I saw but no one believed me. Later on, that
same</b>
<br><b>horrid face was seen by my older brother and my grandmother. I never
saw</b>
<br><b>it again and can't imagine why I saw it in the first place, but
no movie</b>
<br><b>monster has ever looked as frightening as that face I saw all those</b>
<br><b>years ago.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Gardens</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Xxkakie01xX@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I suppose I should start from the beggining.</b>
<br><b>Well, I was talking to my mom the other day. She was in her room
reading a book and I got bored so I went in and asked her if she wouldnt
mind telling me some stories of when I was real little. After I while we
agreed that if she told me a few stories, I would leave her alone so she
could finish her book. She told me about little bumps and brooses I got
and annoying sounds I use to make. And then she told me about this one
time....</b>
<br><b>She was out working in our garden. Its right next to the house.
A big old tree towered over it. I was sitting in my playpen (and for all
you smarts mouths out there, yes I had a playpen, and Im proud of it.)
and I started talking to someone.</b>
<br><b>She turned around and there wasnt anyone there that she could see.
But I was sitting right near the edge of the pen and looking way way up
at someone. By this time Id expect that she thought I was some kind of
pre-mature phycho.lol.</b>
<br><b>She asked me who in the world I was talking to.</b>
<br><b>"A boy." I said.</b>
<br><b>I guess she was somehow creeped out by this, I would have been if
I was my child.lol, but continued on with her gardening-thinking I had
an imaginary friend, I suppose.</b>
<br><b>I think it was just a few weeks later that I was again in my playpen
upstairs while she was cleaning the bathroom.</b>
<br><b>I was over near one of the huge windows we had in our house. Theres
a great view of our....sideyard???lol....and the garden. But at that angle,
she couldnt see me from the bathroom.</b>
<br><b>I started talking to someone out there. And since she couldnt see
me she thought someone had broke into the house. Only the two of us were
there to begin with so if you heard your child talking to someone in the
hallway what would you have thought? So out pops mighty mom with her disinfectant
spray in hand and her trusty paper towels in the other.lol.</b>
<br><b>Again she asked me who in the world I was talking to.</b>
<br><b>"A man." I said.</b>
<br><b>This time she got really nervous.</b>
<br><b>"What does he look like?" She asked me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
She told me that I had described an Omish man, as wierd as it may seem.
Now, I should have said this at the beggining of this story. It would have
made much more sence.</b>
<br><b>At the time, we lived in a really big farm house. It was a light
blue with a pretty red door and a lot of porches all around it. Probably
like three.</b>
<br><b>So the person and the house kind of went together like none of my
socks do. Sry. Just noticed that now.lol.</b>
<br><b>But anyway...</b>
<br><b>When I was about 18 months old, our neighbor, Erric, came over and
showed my mom a picture of the house a while back. He had once lived there
before we did. But this picture was of before he lived there.</b>
<br><b>But the wierd thing is, that in the picture, at the bottom, standing
infront of the house, was a boy and his..... father? More specifically
the boy I had seen and the man I described. Wearing just what I said. A
tall black hat and a black suit like thing. Well that just scared the crap
outa my mom.</b>
<br><b>Later that day she told my dad. He rejected the whole story and
thought nothing of it. He still does.</b>
<br><b>Well, I was probably about eight or so when I was sitting in my
room watching t.v. I was sitting on my bed with drawings all around me.
The colored pencils I had been using were everywhere. Im surprised there
werent any on the cieling or walls. Well I was about ready to crash for
the night, when I spotted something in the hallway. I turned completely
but there was nothing there. A minute later I felt the need to look again.
It felt like someone was telling me to. I dont know I just felt like it
was absolutely neccessary to look again. So I did and at first I didnt
see anything. After a moment or two, I saw a little girl walk right across
my doorway. As if I wasnt there. She simply walked right by. As stiff as
a soldier. She didnt have much of a frame. Just a frail white laced nightgown.With
two pail feet at the bottom, two pail thin arms at the sides, and a pail
featurless face at the top.</b>
<br><b>I never figured out who she was but for some reason I nick named
her Kazzad. Dont ask.lol.</b>
<br><b>I never saw her again but Ill tell you I never went to sleep that
night. I was so tired but I felt like if I turned the t.v. or lights off
she would come in and kill me or something awful like that.</b>
<br><b>So I stayed awake as long as a could until I guess I fell asleep.</b>
<br><b>When I woke up my t.v. had been shut off and so had my lights. But
it was morning so it didnt really matter. I had it confirmed that my mom
had turned everything off but I knew that had not been her walking around
last night. I dont think I ever told them. I dont remember telling them
at all.</b>
<br><b>We moved out of that hosue when I was 11. And tomorow, July 3 2004,
will be our 1 year anniversary. Erric and his family moved into our old
house and now we live in Bellefonte. Its very nice but our new house is
small and as far as Im concerned...unhaunted.lol.</b>
<br><b>If youre reading this you either skipped ahead to the end or you
read my story. I if you did, I very much appreciate it.</b>
<br><b>My friends our coming up tomorow to stay a few nights and were going
to keep an extra eye out. Ya know...for anything.....ghosty.lol.</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: irelandGirl91@go.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>After my husband and I divorced I was given full right to keep my
3 year old son Matt and my Ex-husband was given the house! My son and I
moved to a old home that was always rather drafty and nothing very welcoming
but&nbsp; no doubt about it the only we could afford that had a back yard
that my son could play in instead of a cramped apartment! I worked almost
all day and a close friend of mine came to my house to watch Matt. After
about a month of her looking after him she made a&nbsp; sort of funny remark
“your son is so imaginative he wonders around with a little ‘imaginary’
boy named KC it’s the cutest thing!” At first I thought well he’s a little
boy it’s normal to have imaginary friends! Months past and apparently he
still was communicating with this ‘imaginary friend’ it was Christmas time
I was given off work, I was doing laundry one day in the basement, and
I saw my son come n from playing outside in the snow, He was talking to
somebody as he started to climb the stairs he talked to KC saying “it’s
all right KC u can go upstairs with me” I quickly asked my son who he&nbsp;
was talking to and he said “KC” I giggled! That night I asked my son to
help mommy set the table, he did so but&nbsp; set a place for KC as well,
I decided to play along and put some food on KC’s plate as well, As we
were eating I was shocked when the plate of food I set before Matt’s imaginary
friend vanished. Stuttering like a moron I asked my son, “where did that
food go?” my son looked at me like I was crazy “KC ate it” a week l8r in
the middle of the night I heard water running in the bathroom, I decided
it&nbsp; was just my son washing his hands after the bathroom but 3 minutes
l8r the water was still running, No one needed t wash their hands that
long, I walked down the hall I heard someone quickly turn off the water,
I find the bathroom flooded!, then I saw my son standing outside the bathroom
yelling at somebody, I quickly scolded my son for leaving the water on
for so long!&nbsp; He told me “ mom it wasn’t me it was KC” I decided this
KC thing was going to far! As I was about to scold my son some more I saw
that the bottom of his pajama’s were not wet if he had&nbsp; run in there
as I was walking down the hall to turn off the water his pant legs would
be soaked! Now we had a well outside our house, and every time my son would
go near it KC would appear and start talking to him. I decided to take
action, I went to a local place where people help you with your ghost problems,
I told them what was going on and they told me he was trying to warn us,
I went back home and asked my son to find KC, he said KC was hiding in
the closet! I found a small ball laying on the floor I picked it up and
sat down in front of the closet! I said to KC, KC I’m going to ask u some
questions if the answer is yes role the ball back to me if the answer is
no then don’t role the ball back to me,” I decided since he was always
by the well it had something to do with that, I asked “are you trying to
warn us?” I rolled it is and to my shock the ball rolled back out,&nbsp;
“Did you die In the well?” the ball rolled back out again! Then I asked
“ were you murdered?” the ball rolled back “ do you want me to keep my
son away from the well?” the ball rolled back, then I asked one more question
“is there anything else you’d like to tell us?” I rolled the ball in but
it didn’t come out, I asked my son to check if KC was in there and he said
“no, there’s no KC” my son never saw KC again so I assume the boy moved
on to heaven! My son is now 5 and we live in a new place! So it is true
the ghosts haunt the living for a reason!</b>

<p><b>Hello my name is Chelsea.&nbsp; I have been a visitor of this site
and a few others for quite some time now.&nbsp; This is the first time
i've submitted anything and i chose this site because it was the first
one i found.&nbsp; Before i tell my story i just want to say that, i've
only had a few experiences spread out through my lifetime.&nbsp; I am only
going to tell one.&nbsp; When i was a very little girl back in the 70's
i dont remember what age i was at the time. One night i had a very hard
time going to sleep and it was a very hot night.&nbsp; The whole family
was alseep i shared a bedroom with my brother and i slept on the top bunk.&nbsp;
I just happened to look at the foot of my bed and see this face.&nbsp;
I'll try to describe it as best as i can.&nbsp; The face had little dark
beady eyes and a pig snout for a nose.&nbsp; His face was green and there
was a green mist surounding his face.&nbsp; He just was staring at me my
heart skipped a beat.&nbsp; I turned to my side and lay there motionless
before i got up the nerve to look again.&nbsp; The face was gone but the
mist was there for a little while.&nbsp; I never screamed or yelled for
anyone till after i finaly fell alseep then woke up the next morning.&nbsp;
It was still dark out but our living room light was on so i screamed for
my dad.&nbsp; He came in and i told him what happened.&nbsp; He looked
around for me but nothing was there.&nbsp; I never saw this thing again.&nbsp;
But its always been on my mind and have wondered if that thing will ever
show up again to me or my children.&nbsp; I am now 31 yrs old.&nbsp; I
have prayed to god to keep me and my children pr ected cuz i dont want
something like that to happen again.&nbsp; I never see or hear anything
anymore.&nbsp; I've never realy had big experiences anyway.&nbsp; The rest
were quite funny.&nbsp; Thanks your listening</b><b></b>

<p><b>New Orleans</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nds@cox-internet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in Louisiana. My family and I went to New Orleans&nbsp; last
year for the Helen Bret Show. While we were there me and my dad went on
the ghost tour by the Irish pub. One of the places we stopped at was the
Lalaurie House. While the guy was telling us the story of how Mrs. Lalaurie
killed and rearranged her servants faces in her shed, I started to lose
my sight and couldn't think straight anymore. I didn't know what was happening
to me. I leaned against an old garbage can that was in front of the house.
I started to feel like I was going to throw up. The wierd thing is I normally
don't start passing out when I hear gross stuff like that. It got to the
point where I couldn't even hear what he was saying even though I was standing
two feet in front of him. He acted like he didn't even notice what was
happening. I decided to leave right there. When I went to tell my dad I
wanted to leave I couldn't get myself to walk. My dad realized what was
happening and called a taxi. He had to help me walk all the way to the
cab. Once I got in and drove away from the house everything came back to
me all at once. I felt fine.</b>
<br><b>Just recently we went back to NewOrleans. I finally talked my dad
into taking me again so that I could the rest of what happed to Lalaurie's.
We had a new tour guide this time. Before he started to tell us the story
he gave us a warning that freaked me out. He asked everyone to stay at
least five feet away from the old garbage can in front of the house because
strange things start happening to the people standing by it. He said over
78 people have passed out on that spot. It sounded stupid at first until
I realized that was the exact same place I was standing last time.The tour
guide said it's almost like they become possessed. They start to get really
cold.</b>
<br><b>So if you ever decide go there, don't stand next to the house.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Seeing things</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jbmmlm@comcast.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Thanks for encouraging us to share our stories.&nbsp; I have
long</b>
<br><b>gotten over my shyness about sharing my experiences with the</b>
<br><b>paranormal and have found that just about everyone has had an</b>
<br><b>experience that they can't fully explain.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I
have no</b>
<br><b>pictures, video, or sounds to share.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I began seeing things when I was quite young and, of</b>
<br><b>course, was told that I wasn't really seeing anything, that it was
just</b>
<br><b>my imagination thereby negating my reality.&nbsp; But, that's ok,
my</b>
<br><b>parents didn't know any better so it wasn't until I was in my late</b>
<br><b>teens and into my twenties that I began sharing my stories.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;There are several that overlap.&nbsp; The first happened in
my</b>
<br><b>late teens.&nbsp; I always had a strange and persistant feeling
of being</b>
<br><b>watched and was very, very uncomfortable being outside after dark.</b>
<br><b>This was at home, in my own yard!&nbsp; I didn't say that to anyone
in my</b>
<br><b>family having already learned that I would just be told it was my</b>
<br><b>imagination.&nbsp; However, one night, a young man I was dating
and I</b>
<br><b>were sitting outside and I had the usual feeling come over me and</b>
<br><b>he looked at me with a strange expression on his face and</b>
<br><b>suggested we go inside. We did and I asked him what the problem</b>
<br><b>was and he said he felt like we were not alone.&nbsp; During the
course of</b>
<br><b>about a year, I had many strange experiences, like if I came home</b>
<br><b>after dark, I always felt like someone was running up behind me
and</b>
<br><b>was walking in my footsteps as I walked, usually ran, to the house</b>
<br><b>from my car.&nbsp; I hated getting out of the car because it always</b>
<br><b>happened.&nbsp; One night while discussing this with my friend,
we heard</b>
<br><b>a howling coming from a distant part of the property but from the</b>
<br><b>same general direction that the follower came from.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;A night or so later, I had been out for coffee with some</b>
<br><b>friends.&nbsp; As I pulled in our driveway, my headlights caught
two red</b>
<br><b>eyes, about five feet off the ground, standing by a pole barn off
to</b>
<br><b>the side of the driveway.&nbsp; While pulling in I continued to
watch them</b>
<br><b>because I thought it was a deer.&nbsp; Well, they turned away but
there</b>
<br><b>was no body.&nbsp; Needless to say, I didn't know what to do.&nbsp;
Somehow I</b>
<br><b>found the courage to park the car, and run into the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Some time after that, however, it was worse.&nbsp; I had come</b>
<br><b>home late, about midnight, and went through the same routine.&nbsp;
I got</b>
<br><b>into the house alright and heard my dad snoring, which was</b>
<br><b>soothing to me.&nbsp; We also had a 95 pound German shepard who</b>
<br><b>always greeted me and would follow me into the bathroom and then</b>
<br><b>the kitchen for a treat from the refrigerator.&nbsp; Well, that
night, the dog</b>
<br><b>didn't wake up, which I thought was strange, even though he was</b>
<br><b>sleeping in the kitchen in his usual spot.&nbsp; So, I walked through
the</b>
<br><b>kitchen and heard a low growl so I figured the dog was dreaming.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>walked into the bathroom and then back into the kitchen to turn
off</b>
<br><b>the light over the sink.&nbsp; I stopped in my tracks because I
heard a</b>
<br><b>louder growl coming not the dog, but from the laundry room off the</b>
<br><b>kitchen.&nbsp; Needless to say, I was petrified and ran into my
bedroom</b>
<br><b>which was located in the basement.&nbsp; I felt OK, though, because
my</b>
<br><b>parents were upstairs and my brother's bedroom was next to mine</b>
<br><b>in the basement.&nbsp; With a housefull of people and a giant sleeping</b>
<br><b>dog in the kitchen, what could it be other than my imagination?</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I heard the door to the basement at the top of the steps</b>
<br><b>open and thought that my parents were checking on the light</b>
<br><b>situation since I had not turned off the light in the kitchen. They
were</b>
<br><b>big on making sure unused lights were turned off. So, I was trying
to</b>
<br><b>rationalize an irrational situation.&nbsp; I tried not to think
anything more of</b>
<br><b>it and went to sleep.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;At 3 a.m. I heard my bedroom door closing and someone</b>
<br><b>stepping onto the bottom step to the basement stairs.&nbsp; There
is a</b>
<br><b>screen-like skylight over the bedroom door for air circulation so
I</b>
<br><b>knew the basement lights were not on.&nbsp; I turned on my light,
sat up,</b>
<br><b>looked around, and thought, man, I must have been dreaming.&nbsp;
So, I</b>
<br><b>laid back down and turned off my light.&nbsp; As soon as the light
was off,</b>
<br><b>my bedroom door threw open with a ferocity that I have yet to</b>
<br><b>duplicate and someone stepped into my room.&nbsp; I didn't know
what to</b>
<br><b>do.&nbsp; The way the room was laid out, the closet was built out
into the</b>
<br><b>room and therefore blocked any light coming in from the two</b>
<br><b>windows so the door area was pitch black.&nbsp; I laid there in
a total</b>
<br><b>panic until I passed out.&nbsp; I woke up at 5 a.m. and it was light
enough</b>
<br><b>that I could see that my bedroom door was completely shut.&nbsp;
As</b>
<br><b>soon as I heard my parents up and moving around I ran upstairs in</b>
<br><b>what I believe to have been one giant leap.&nbsp; My parents saw
me and</b>
<br><b>said, what the hell happened to you?&nbsp; I was white and visibly</b>
<br><b>shaken.&nbsp; I told them what happened and my dad, in his own unique</b>
<br><b>way, sent my brother and I back into the basement to check it out.</b>
<br><b>Of course no one was there.&nbsp; I do not know what visited me
that</b>
<br><b>night and I am not sure I want to know.&nbsp; Of all the things
I had seen</b>
<br><b>and experienced in my parents house, which I am currently living
in</b>
<br><b>by the way, that was by far the most dramatic and unexplained</b>
<br><b>phenomenon.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;While living in Pennsylvania, I experienced a real ghost,
the</b>
<br><b>kind you can see that walks through your house and causes loud</b>
<br><b>noised to occur.&nbsp; I had just bought the house and I could have
lived</b>
<br><b>with this man there but I didn't want to freak out my kids.&nbsp;
So</b>
<br><b>because of that, I called a woman in the Cleveland, OH area that</b>
<br><b>was known to "bust ghosts."&nbsp; She came to my house in PA and
also</b>
<br><b>came to my mom's.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;In PA, the ghost I saw was with the house when I bought it.</b>
<br><b>He had adotped us as his family.&nbsp; The previous owner was also
a</b>
<br><b>divorced mom with two kids so we were the new family.&nbsp;&nbsp;
However,</b>
<br><b>there was another ghost who was attached to a table I had. She just</b>
<br><b>wanted to know where the rest of the set was and I told her I had
no</b>
<br><b>idea.&nbsp; The table was my ex's and I think it may have been his</b>
<br><b>grandmother.&nbsp; Needless to say, he got the table back!&nbsp;
The third</b>
<br><b>ghost that was there was actually with me.&nbsp; His name was James,</b>
<br><b>and he had been with me since I was an infant living in the</b>
<br><b>converted attic at my grandmother's house.&nbsp; She thought that</b>
<br><b>perhaps James was related to me somehow.&nbsp; She asked me</b>
<br><b>several times if I wanted her to send him on and I said yes.&nbsp;
She got</b>
<br><b>this weird look on her face and said well, he has a message for
you.</b>
<br><b>She asked me if I had ever fallen and broken a leg or something</b>
<br><b>and I said, no, why?&nbsp; She said that James wanted to tell me
that he</b>
<br><b>was sorry he couldn't have protected me.&nbsp; Well, all sorts of
things</b>
<br><b>rans through my head of the ways in which he would have been</b>
<br><b>frustrated in that arena.&nbsp; I told him it was OK .&nbsp; So
Maryann sent him</b>
<br><b>on but at that very moment, it felt just like someone had lifted
their</b>
<br><b>hand off my heart - like my energy heart, not the actual heart,
and I</b>
<br><b>got instant tears in my eyes and almost started sobbing.&nbsp; I
told</b>
<br><b>Maryann about what I was feeling and she said, hey, he's been with</b>
<br><b>you longer than you were with your parents!&nbsp; So even though
I had</b>
<br><b>never seen James, at least that I know of, he was with me all the</b>
<br><b>time.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;At my mom's she told me that there was an opening next to</b>
<br><b>the barn and that there was an entity there and an opening through</b>
<br><b>which it traveled.&nbsp; And it had red eyes - so at least it solved
the red-</b>
<br><b>eyed mystery.&nbsp;&nbsp; I told her that it had to go and was not
to be</b>
<br><b>anywhere near my family and not to come back to this house or</b>
<br><b>property.&nbsp; Before it left, it wanted to know if I wanted to
send it</b>
<br><b>somewhere in particular, like to my ex-husband's house.&nbsp; At
least it</b>
<br><b>had a sense of humor!&nbsp; I refused since I have two children
that visit</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; My son had already seen this entity at his dad's, and
my</b>
<br><b>sister-in-law had seen it at her house so apparently it either traveled</b>
<br><b>with my mother or it just liked my family as a group.&nbsp; But
we didn't</b>
<br><b>like it.&nbsp; She sent it on and closed the opening and it has
not been</b>
<br><b>back since.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;We are currently living at my mom's house and althought I</b>
<br><b>continue to hear things here and my children, my siter-in-law, her</b>
<br><b>mother, and I have sensed things here, we believe that the only</b>
<br><b>ghost here now is my dad and he's hanging around until my mom</b>
<br><b>makes the transition.&nbsp; Yeah, I still don't like the basement
and we</b>
<br><b>rarely go down there.&nbsp; I think the only thing there is my dad,
that was</b>
<br><b>really his domain.&nbsp; My kids don't like the garage either, but
then</b>
<br><b>again, that was also my dad's domain.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;There are more stories here from different family members,</b>
<br><b>like my nephew stayed here and had a door opening experience,</b>
<br><b>and my son has too, but I don't think it's anything other than my
dad</b>
<br><b>making himself known.&nbsp; He's still here, he's still watching
over us,</b>
<br><b>and he let's us know if he doesn't like certain things - like my
son</b>
<br><b>cranking certain music on the stereo.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;So, yes, people can blow this off as scary stories, but I
had</b>
<br><b>the full blown experiences of these - wide awake, completely lucid,</b>
<br><b>not under the influence of any hallucinogens (who needs them when</b>
<br><b>reality is so interesting!), alcohol, etc.&nbsp; If anyone has an
idea as to</b>
<br><b>what the growling thing may have been or if you have an insight
or a</b>
<br><b>jolt in your gut that says "hey that was a ...." please let me know.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Some Strange Things</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: browneyeslonglashes@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have only had a few very small experiences.</b>
<br><b>One being when my grandma was dying- we brought her home because
that is where she wanted to be- things started to happen like we were all
sat around her bed and by her bed was a firle place and on the mantle piece
was a candle snuffer( it was made of iron) all of a sudden it flew off
the mantle piece on to the floor, a few ather things happend like lamps
falling over on their own and so forth. The starngest thing was that my
mum and her brither hadnt got on for years and they were outside the house
talking about things and putting differences to rest- at the exact time
they hugged and made up my grandma died- i mean the exact same time.</b>
<br><b>The place we live now i live with my mum and my boyfriend- we live
in a flat and apparently someone died here but i am not sure- things go
missing like a bellyring went missing for weeks and then just turned up
on our glass dining table( there is no way we could have missed that).
I am a shoe lover and my favourite pair of shoes went missing for a good
few months, i had looked everywhere for them and i couldnt find them- then
one day they just turn up on my wardrobe.&nbsp; The wierdest thing that
has happend is me and my boyfriend were in bed falling asleep( we had just
tu ed the light off)- and all of a sudden i felt my boyfrind jump and lash
out- i asked him what was wrong and he said a bad dream- the next day he
told me that he had been lying there just driftinf off to sleep and he
flet someone poke him in the eyes, both of them. I am telling the truth.</b>
<br><b>I do sometimes feel abit wierd or cold but that could just be my
imagination!</b>

<p><b>The Dead don't hurt Us</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kells@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have always been facinated by ghosts and thing that seemed unexplainable
it was 14years ago when i had my first child that things happened to make
me a true belever as a single mother i was like all the rest over protective
of my first child one night i put my son to bed and sat down to watch tv
i must have dozed off for i heard my son crying i thought i would let him
cry for a few minutes to see if he would go back to sleep on his own but
then i heard some one singing a lullaby i knew i was the only person in
the house so i went to see thinking i was still asleep when i opened the
door i froze in both shock and fear my son was floating above his cot as
if somone was rocking him and i heard a lullaby my son was going to sleep
and didnt seem to worried about this ghostly thing when i could finally
move i went to take my son and it felt like another person handing him
over to me that night my baby slept with me and i got the house blessed
after that nothing else happened .</b>
<br><b>Some years later i moved in to another house&nbsp; witch was haunted
i could feel the presents in the house my self&nbsp; one night lying in
bed i heard the bedroom door open and felt a weight get in to bed besid
me thinking it was one of the children i turned over to see but the bed
was empty and the part that was still weighed down was freezing i quickly
said a prayer and asked it to leave witch it did&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some
time later i had become accustomed to the ghost by then my partner and
myself were in bed when the door opened i said to my partner that it was
the ghost and he laughed so i told it to get out and the door opened and
closed as if someone had just left the room my partner has never laughed
at me since.</b>
<br><b>I went to get a card reading and was told that i had a ghost but
he was there to protect me that he had become attached to me and that it
would be hard to get him to cross over in to the light they said his name
was Allen James that he was 45yrs old and that he died on the 4 of may
which scared me as that is my birthday.</b>
<br><b>Now i live in a house where people pass you but there is no one
there and a name less child roams at night but they have never harmed any
off the family or visitors so we can live with that.</b>
<br><b>well this is my stories i hope you find them as interesting as i
do</b>
<br><b>my grand mother always said its not the dead that hurt us but the
living and i believe thats true.</b>

<p><b>My paticular experince has only been going on for the past month.&nbsp;
I</b>

town of</b>
<br><b>Smithers, British Columbia, Canada.&nbsp; I work a cleaning night
shift at, what</b>

<br><b>system is controlled by hand (by light switch).&nbsp; I am at this
building after</b>
<br><b>7:00p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.&nbsp; By now, the
building is clear</b>
<br><b>of everyone else, except for me and another cleaning lady who does
the third</b>
<br><b>floor of the Nora Building.&nbsp; The last person out of the building
has to turn</b>
<br><b>off the lights.&nbsp; Now, before either of us go home, we let the
other one know</b>
<br><b>that we are going.&nbsp; I'm normally the last one out of the building.&nbsp;
Exactly</b>
<br><b>between 7:30 p.m and 8:00 p.m., on the days that I mentionined above

<br><b>am in the Nora Building, the first floor back room lights are turned
off.</b>
<br><b>This has happened to me at least 6 times in the past month that

<p><b>I have had many experiences throughout my life. My family have very
strong</b>
<br><b>psychic lines on both sides and because of this i think maybe i
tend to be</b>
<br><b>more sensitive to the paranormal than most people. All my family
are either</b>
<br><b>witches, tarot readers, palm readers or just naturally psychic or</b>
<br><b>clairvoyant. My first experience started when i was about 3. I was
an only</b>
<br><b>child and had what my parents thought was an imaginary friend but
my Mum now</b>
<br><b>swears that it must have been a spirit. She says that she would
come and</b>
<br><b>check on me playing in my room and would walk through cold spots
in my room.</b>
<br><b>When she did this i would cry and say she had stepped on "Arthur".
Other</b>
<br><b>things happened to make her think that Arthur was real. For exmple
one day i</b>
<br><b>was very bad and my mum punished me by taking away my favourite
doll and</b>
<br><b>putting it in the top of the hot water cupboard. I was really upset
and sat</b>
<br><b>inside the cupboard crying because i couldn't reach it. My mum came
to check</b>
<br><b>on me becuase i had stopped crying and found me sitting in the cupboard
with</b>
<br><b>my doll. When she asked me how i got it down i told her "Arthur"
got it down</b>
<br><b>for me. We moved out of that house when i was about seven and i
haven't seen</b>
<br><b>"Arthur" since.</b>
<br><b>When i was about 12 i was in a major car accident and ended up in
a ditch</b>
<br><b>full of water. I was knocked out and the water was up to my neck.
Usually</b>
<br><b>when you are unconscious your head falls onto your chest but when
i woke up</b>
<br><b>my head was tilted back out of the water as if someone was holding
it and i</b>
<br><b>felt a complete calm. If my head had fallen onto my chest when i
was knocked</b>
<br><b>out i would have drowned. Lucky something was there to look after
me.</b>
<br><b>When i was 13 i was staying at my friend "Sarah's" house who lived
down the</b>
<br><b>road. Her house was built in 1903 and was the original farmhouse
when all</b>
<br><b>around was farmland. We were sitting in her room talking when suddenly
the</b>
<br><b>room went cold and Sarah started acting real wierd. Her eyes rolled
back in</b>
<br><b>her head and she knelt down on the carpet and started raking her
fingernails</b>
<br><b>through the carpet making a circle around herself and rolling her
head</b>
<br><b>around on her neck. She kept making these horrible moaning noises
that</b>
<br><b>really hurt my head and made her dog Toby whine and scratch outside
the door</b>
<br><b>like he wanted to be let in. I didn't know what to do so i ran to
the door</b>
<br><b>and let Toby in coz he was a huge dog and made me feel safe. He
ran up to</b>
<br><b>Sarah and knocked her onto her back so hard that she hit her head
on the</b>
<br><b>floor. Suddenly the feeling in the room changed and Sarah seemed
to be back</b>
<br><b>to normal. She said it was like someone had taken control of her.
She said</b>
<br><b>she could see everything that was going on but couldn't do anything
about</b>
<br><b>it. We went outside and sat in her pepper tree which was one of
our</b>
<br><b>favourite places. We looked back towards her house and saw a little
girl</b>
<br><b>staring out of the bathroom window which is right next to Sarah's
room. We</b>
<br><b>couldn't see many features but she had these piercing dark eyes
and big dark</b>
<br><b>ringlets. We decided to check it out so we took Toby, her dog, and
went to</b>
<br><b>the toilet. I know it may sound silly but when you think about it
when the</b>
<br><b>house was built it wouldn't have been the toilet. Toby wouldn't
go near the</b>
<br><b>toilet. He started growling and all the hair on the back of his
neck stood</b>
<br><b>up. Me and Sarah stood together and covered ourselves in white light,
which</b>
<br><b>is a trick my aunty who is a high priestess taught me for protection.
We</b>
<br><b>then told the spirit to go away and not to bother us. We never saw
her</b>
<br><b>again. But when Sarah moved out about a year later, we were cleaning
out the</b>
<br><b>attic and found heaps of old books. I picked one up and a photo
fell out of</b>
<br><b>it. We both got really freaked out because it was a picture of the
girl we</b>
<br><b>had seen in the toilet.</b>
<br><b>I would really like to hear any feed back ytou have on these. I
have lots</b>
<br><b>more stories too.</b>
<br><b>Its really cool to be able to share these and i think your website
is a</b>
<br><b>fantastic idea.</b>

<p><b>Ghostly Friend</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rebecca4871@charter.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was little I had a ghost for a friend. He got me into a lot
of mischief. For instance I&nbsp; remember playing house in my bedroom
and he pointed out we didn't have any play money. So he stood as look out
in the hallway as I took a big wad of my fathers cash from the top of his
dresser. The funny thing is that my dad thought my mom just took and never
asked about it until she found it at the bottom of my closet inside one
of my purses. When she asked me where I got the money from all I said was
"The ghost did it!"</b>
<br><b>Another time he got me into to trouble was on my birthday. I had
a huge cookie monster birthday cake and he thought we should have some
of the frosting. I remember taking the cake into my living room and sitting
in the corner behind our couch. He 'the ghost' ran his finger from one
corner of the cake to the other and stuck it in his mouth. Then he told
me it was my turn and I did it too. When I was asked about it I said "The
ghost did it!" (My mom took a picture of the cake and there is only one
finger mark through the frosting)</b>
<br><b>Those are the two most vivid memories of my friend. My mom said
that I always blamed things on "the ghost," and up until I moved out of
the house we always kept in touch. For instance one day he through the
potatoes down the stairs to get my attention. He would turn my T.V. off
all the time. At night he had a ritual; You could hear him walking up the
stairs to my bedroom, then I could hear him walking around the bathroom
for a while, after that he would walk up my stairs into the attic. I could
hear his footstep everynight. In an erie way I was comforted by him.</b>
<br><b>Recently, my parents sold the house to a couple with 2 little boys
&amp; 1 little girl, I think he'll be happy with his new friends!</b>

<p><b>Ghost in my Window</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: petz062285@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>One day I suddenly awoke in my old apartment. At the time I was 10
Years old, I look at the window and see the outline of the Devil. Im scared
so I call My mother who also slept in the same room she gets up and looks
at the window and cant see anything but the outline was still there. I
decide to close my eyes and ignore it but then im awaken again by a sound
and the outline is still there. Im thinking theres no possible way this
can happen since we were located on the second floor. Anyways I kick my
borther to wake him up and he sees the shape and he jumps up to the top
of the bed after making some gestures and the outline dissapears suddenly.
Then I found out that vefore we moved into this apartment in the Bronx
a guy had been shot in front of our door and had asked for help but noone
opened their doors and alot of weird things happen in tis building every
year.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Friends Apartment</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Stickyfingerz18@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My story all starts out
in my friends apartment in Holyoke. My friend had mentioned that an elderly
woman had died a while back in the kitchen. So all of a sudden he heard
the door to the apartment slam shut. The door is at the bottom of the stairs
leading to the third floor. So he asked me if I slammed the door and I
said no. Then it was 11 at night and earlier we had put a bunch of beer
bottles on an air conditioner in the kitchen. One was sitting on a towel.
So when it fell to the ground, we thought maybe it fell. Then we heard
a scraping sound from the kitchen which was about 30 feet straight ahead
from where we were. So we noticed that it was the bottle moving towards
us. We sat there and watched as it continued to move toward us. So then
my friend picked up the bottle and put back in the kitchen. We were both
laughing yet scared at the same time. So he asked it to give us a sign
if it was real. All of a sudden we heard the toilet bubble up and water
everywhere. That was no coincidence.&nbsp; It was everywhere. So the next
morning we woke up and put all the bottles in the six pack things. So at
about 9 PM that night the same thing happened. We heard the bottle hit
the floor and it moved towards us again. We knew it couldn't have fallen
out because it have had to be lifted out. There for someone or something
in the apartment lifted it out. But it wasn't me or my friend. So we started
to ask it questions. Everytime I would ask it a question it would turn
towards me and go towards me. The same with my friend. So then we asked
it to give us a sign if it was real. The next I know in the bathroom I
hear what sounds like a sprinkler. My friend went o go look and it was
the sink spraying water everywhere again. Another thing that would happen
is one of us would be in the kitchen and it would feel like you are being
watched from around the corner. My friend always would ask if I was there
and I would say no. I was in the living room everytime he would ask. We
assume it was the old lady. We would always hear noises from the kitchen
at all hours of the night. Like for example I would hear a clicking sound.
It sounded like a refrigerator but it wasn't though. We would only hear
it at about 12 in the morning when we would try and go to bed. It was creepy.
Another time we heard something in the kitchen thrown across to the other
side. I think it was a salt shaker or something. That's my story. if you
have any questions or want to know More Email me.</b><b></b>

<p><b>"DEVIL LIGHTS"</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: andykumpon@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>We have a strange anomaly here in the inland northwest, that s been
going only for the last year or so. The locals refer to them as the "Devil
Lights," and the back story behind this supposed supernatural aura, are
quite interesting in its own right. About a year ago, a group of college
kids at a local university (Eastern Washington University) who are tied
to some environmental organization, disappeared out there, and though no
trace was found, many believe that they just relocated themselves to the
Oregon coast, where most seem to inhabit. They are considered "Eco-terrorists,"
sabotaging logging equipment and spiking trees etc. Well, some people believe,
that they are still out there, somewhere, and are tied to the actual "Devil
lights" themselves. Rumor has it that it was a mass suicide, or quite possibly
even murder (though there is nothing to substantiate these allegations)
and the "lights" are tied to their restless spirits. Or, is possibly some
cult, or something like a coven.</b>
<br><b>I have seen them, or at least "I think I saw them." It happened
fast, and I must say, they do have an aura of "evil" about them. It almost
resembles a red glow of eyes and a mouth, hence the term "Devil Lights."
People are as scared as hell to venture out after them. Could be Bonfires?
Could be the Northern lights? I really can t say. But I do hope they investigate
further as to the true origin (if any, I m still skeptical).</b>
<br><b>I m sure they ll be more info on this within the months to follow.&nbsp;
This area is in Spokane Washington.</b><b></b>

<p><b>TRUE Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Mest62289@wmconnect.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was about age 4, I was called "psychic" by my mother. We lived
in a large house and my room was up two flights of stairs and down a narrow
hall. One day I was playing in my room and I hollared to my mother to make
me one (a sandwhich) she said make you what? I said a sandwhich. I was
in my room for hours and I didnt know or smell her cooking. A few years
later went by and we moved to a new home. I was about 7 now, this house
was so far up on a mountain there were no misquiots and we couldnt bake
brownies otherwise they would burn. Anyways, I when I would fall asleep
at night I could sense a someone in my bedroom, in my brothers room and
in the lower part of the house. One day a woman came to the house, a random
woman who heard the news that we moved in. Nobody knew who we were in that
town, the woman came to the door and said to my mother. Hello Elaine, you
were born April 11 1960. My mom was stunned and invited the woman in, this
woman was a nurse as well. I just got bitten by the dog the evening before
I came downstairs and before my mom could tell the woman I got bit, she
knew. She felt the back of my head because I was knocked down and she could
sense that I had ESP. I was pronounced psychic. The woman said that the
house was haunted badly. A pregnant woman was pushed down the stairs and
lost her baby and was killed there. Two boys were blown up with dynamite
in the backyard and a little girl was buried alive in the basement. I later
on would start playing with this young girl and my mom became concerned.
Because I was later able to speak to the spirits, we later moved because
it became "to freaky" for my parents to handle. I recently have been visiting
graveyards, and have made a new spirit friend through nightly meditating.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp; 3 Ghosts in My Life</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I am 29 now and when I was about three my parents and I (I'm an
only child) lived in an old house that was condemned way out in the country,
2 hours from anywhere and&nbsp; I&nbsp; used to walk down the road to the
farmers cowshed to get milk, I can still remember milk being warm and bits
of grass floating in it,anyway I can't specifically remember this but my
mum told me that during the night I would wake up and chat away,as if I
was talking to someone who was sitting on my bed. My parents though I had
an 'invisible friend' and thought nothing of it. When my mum put me into
the spare room, my friend came with me and mum and dad thought nothing
of it until one night they had a party and a friend of theirs heard me
talking and came to check on me and asked who I was chatting to, I said
her name was Kathy and she lived here before me, so the friend went to
mum and dad and asked them who had bought their kid with them and when
mum and dad said no-one, she said someone did because she had seen her
in my room talking to me.A few weeks later we moved, and mum went through
the newspapers the library and found out that about 5 years before we moved
there a girl about 2 years older than I was had been killed there by her
father.</b>
<br><b>Then when I was 21/22 my boyfriend and I along with his parents
moved into a house that one a small street, only about 10 houses on it,
that was off a busy main road and not long after we moved in things would
move around and disappear.</b>
<br><b>I usually cooked tea( still do) and I would put down a spoon or
a fork look away, and it would be gone! the same with lighters, keys any
cutlery, ashtrays, most things that were small.</b>
<br><b>We all used to hear&nbsp; footsteps walking up and down the hallway
late at night but thought it was one of us going to the toilet or kitchen.</b>
<br><b>We used to experience cold spots&nbsp; and our bedroom( mine and
my partner's) used to be very cold all the time even in summer.</b>
<br><b>One night I was in the living room reading and someone walking past
the door caught my eye but all I could see was the elbow, it was a green
leather patch on a jacket and I didn't think twice until a day later I
asked who owned the jacket and no one did and that led to a conversation
about</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;the noises and disappearing objects( which would be found
later on the other side of the house) and held a s&eacute;ance around the
dining room table.</b>
<br><b>We all jumped when the glass moved and all accused each other of
moving it, and when it moved on its own, we quickly stopped!</b>
<br><b>My boyfriends mother was friend with a next door neighbour, a women
of about 70 who had lived there for about 50 years, and found out that
the person who had lived their was an old guy who had lived in the house
all his life and named Norman, Norman's father had built the house and
lived their until his death and so did Norman who had died in the house
a few years before we moved in, incidentally in the room I shared with
my boyfriend.</b>
<br><b>Norman's daughter had taken care of the house until we rented it
of her.</b>
<br><b>So after that when things went missing we would ask Norman to give
it back and he usually would a few minutes later.</b>
<br><b>A few months ago we were talking about the house and Norman and
we all agreed we never felt threatened or scared when Norman played his
tricks, although when I was cooking tea it would get a bit frustrating.</b>
<br><b>My last experience was actually while I was living in Norman's house
but used to work as a nanny on the main road. The house was in front of
a wood mill ( now closed) and night and day there would be the sound of
machinery and the thumping of logs which I quickly got used to.</b>
<br><b>The wood mill was well known for accidents and a odd accidental
death.</b>
<br><b>The house I worked in was only about 20 years old and before the
house was built, it was an empty plot of land used by the workers as a
shortcut to the mill.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;One night just afar I had put the boys to bed ( two year old
twins) I was shutting the curtains and checking the locks, when I saw someone
walk past the door. The door was a set of French glass pane doors that
opened to three steps that went onto to the drive way.</b>
<br><b>I opened the door and called out " Hey" I could see the person was
a man wearing a red plaid shirt, he turned around and I swear to god he
turned to look at me and he disappeared into thin air. I was so scared
I have never moved so fast to check doors and close the curtains since!</b>
<br><b>I haven't had any ghostly experiences since but often know who is
on the phone when it rings and when I get hunches or have ' a gut feeling'
they are ALWAYS right. I often know when visitors are going to drop in
unannounced, and now I am a student at the I.T.,&nbsp; always get a feeling
when classes are called off with no notice.</b>
<br><b>Well those are my experiences, thanks for taking the time to read
about them , I hope they were interesting,</b>
