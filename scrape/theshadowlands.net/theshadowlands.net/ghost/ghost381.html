My Experiences<br>
<br>
By: stephaniejulcar@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
HI MY NAME IS STEPHANIE CARRASQUILLO AND I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN
BOSTON MASSACHUSETTS. I GREW UP IN A HOUSING PROJECT THERE AND HAD MANY
MANY EXPERIENCES HAPPEN IN THE 1ST AND 2ND APARTMENT THAT WE LIVED IN.
IN THE FIRST APARTMENT I WAS LIVED THERE FROM BIRTH TO ABOUT THE AGE OF
TEN. WELL EVERY NIGHT I WOULD BE AWAKENED BY SOMEONE SQUEEZING MY TOES.
I WOULD LOOK AND NOONE WAS THERE BUT I WOULD HERE LAUGHING AND I
THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ONE OF MY 4 SISTERS TRYING TO SCARE ME. SOME TIMES
I WOULD FEEL SOMEONE RUBBING BACK MY HAIR BEHIND MY EAR AGAIN WHILE I
WAS SLEEPING AND ONCE AGAIN I THOUGHT IT WAS EITHER MY SISTERS OR MY
MOM CHECKING IN ON ME BUT I WOULS WAKE UP AND NOONE WAS THERE. WELL
THAT WAS ALL THAT REALLY HAPPENED IN THAT APARTMENT BUT ONCE WE MOVED
NEXT DOOR INTO THE OTHER BUILDING,THE FIRST APARTMENT AND THE NEW ONE
WE MOVED TWO ACTUALLY WERE ONLY SEPERATED BY A WALL, THINGS REALLY
STARTED TO SCARE ME. ONE TIME WHILE SITTING ON MY BEDROOM FLOOR READING
A BOOK TO MY YOUNGEST SISTER I REMEMBER IT GOT REALLY CHILLY IN THERE
AND THEN MY SISTER WHO WAS ONLY 5 AT THE TIME TOLD ME TO LOOK. SHE WAS
POINTING TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE WALL THAT I WAS LEANING AGAINST AND
WHEN I LOOKED I SAW A LEG, BLACK DRESS PANTS BLACK DRESS SHOE, COMING
THROUGH THE WALL AND IT CONTINUED TO WALK RIGHT THROUGH TO THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE ROOM AND THROUGH THE NEXT WALL THAT LED TO OUR BATHROOM.
LET ME TELL YOU I WAS RUNNING SCARED. ANOTHER TIME WHILE WE WERE ALL
SITTING IN THE LIVING ROOM MY MOM WAS IRONING OUR CLOTHES AND ASKED ME
TO GO HANG THEM UP IN MY CLOSET. WELL ALL OF THE LIGHTS WERE OFF AND I
WAS ALREADY SCARED OF MY BEDROOM, I STARED DOWN THE HALL. WHEN I
REACHED MY BEDROOM DOOR AND WENT TO OPEN IT I HEARD SOME ONE TALKING IN
MY ROOM, I OPENED THE DOOR AND HIT THE LIGHT SWITCH AND MY BED COVERS
WERE ALL MESSED UP TORN OFF OF MY BED AND MY PILLOW WAS BROKEN OPEN.
WELL I KNOW THAT NONE OF MY SISTERS DID THIS BECAUSE RIGHT BEFORE WE
WENT TO THE LIVING ROOM TO SIT DOWN AND WATCH TV MY MOM WAS INSPECTING
OUR ROOMS TO MAKE SURE WE HAD STRAIGHTENED UP, THAT WAS A DAILY THING
WITH HER OUR HOUSE AND ROOMS HAD TO BE SPOTLESS. NONE THE LESS I WAS IN
ALOT OF TROUBLE, SHE THOUGHT I HAD DONE IT.AND ONE OF THE LAST MOST
MEMORABLE ONES WAS ME AND MY LITTLE SISTER WERE GOING TO BED AND ONCE
AGAIN THE LIGHTS WERE OFF IN THE BEDROOMS. I WAS WALKING HER TO THE
BATHROOM SO WE COULD WASH UP AND BEFORE I COULD FLICK THE LIGHT SWITCH
ON IT DID IT BY ITSELF. WELL I GAVE IT NO SECOND THOUGHT WHEN ALL OF A
SUDDEN IT JUST KEPT GOING UP AND DOWN ON AND OFF AND IT WOULDNT STOP. I
SCREAMED AND THEN RAN BACK TO MY MOM. SHE ONCE AGAIN THOUGHT I WAS
MAKING IT UP BUT BELIEVE ME MY LITTLE SISTER WASN A TRUE BELIEVER
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE LAID DOWN TO SLEEP. OUR DOOR HAD TO STAY OPEN
BECAUSE WE WERE BOTH AFRAID OF THE DARK AND EVERYONE ELSE WAS ALREADY
IN BED. THE BATHROOM LIGHT STARTED GOING ON AND OFF AGIAN AND THEN WE
HEARD LAUGHTER........ABOUT A YEAR LATER ONE OF MY FRIENDS HAD TOLD ME
THAT SHE WAS SURPRISED WE LASTED SO LONG IN THAT APARTMENT BECAUSE HER
GRANDMAOTHER HAD DIED IN THERE ABOUT TWO YEARS BEFORE WE HAD MOVED IN.
I ASKED HER IF ANY KIDS EVER LIVED THERE AND SHE SAID TWO OF HER
COUSINS,WHO WERE SMALL AT THE TIME, HAD DIED WITH HER
GRANDMOTHER.......THEY DIED IN A FIRE IN THE APARTMENT.......I REMEMBER
THE FIRE BUT NEVER KNEW WHO LIVED THERE AND NOW I DO ..I STILL HAVE
MANY THINGS HAPPEN TO ME BY SOMEONE OR SOMETHING UNSEEN BUT I JUST
THINK OH WELL THERE EVERYWHERE<br>

Grayson Manor,Sequatchie County<br>
<br>
By: dumptheidiot@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
Me and my son went to Grayson Manor today.It is very hard to find and
you have to go down a couple of roads that two cars can't pass on.We
had searched for two weeks and we finally found it.You have to cross a
cattle gate and then a creek.The whole time you are walking up the dirt
road you hear something walking beside you. You finally come to a cute
little building and then the creek is right behind it about two
yards.As you come to the creek you see the house and I am here to tell
you even in the daytime it is scary as heck. Walk across the creek and
in the high grass,walk around to the front of the house,you can't go in
because it is all to heck but you can see in the rooms from the
outside.We walk beside the left side of the house and I step on a nail
and it goes through my foot,Well I holler for my son Joey and he tells
me he can't help because something is pushing him against the front of
the house. I finally get my foot free and then we go to the backside of
the house so you can see the stairs that General Grayson walked up to
hang himself. We stood there and looked up the stairs and me being the
idiot I am asked him to show us a sign, a thump or creaking sound and
we got what we asked for it was a small creak and we wasn't touching
nothing so we would know that it came from him.I asked him to please do
it again.And again it was a small creak.Then I said thank you and a
cold spot came over where we were standing I asked my son to put his
hand out and feel.I didn't tell him what I was feeling and he said he
felt really cold in that spot.Then we heard a sound of someone walking
towards us.Sorry but we got the heck out of there. As we crossed the
creek we could hear something behind us.Will we go back?Yesss! We want
to go back at night and ake a tape recorder and more film.It is haunted
and I would like for anyone with more info to please contact me and let
me know because it just makes me want to know who he was and what made
him kill his family and himself.<br>

<br>
This is something that happened to me over Christmas.<br>
*****<br>
My family and I were over at my grandmother's house for Christmas, my
sister had her son with us and everything was going great. butmore
people showed up than we thought so my sister and I went out back to
the shed to get more chairs, its a long walk to the shed. well I walked
in and was pulling some chairs out when my sister asked why Aj (my
Nephew) was outside. I turned around and saw him too, I started to tell
him to go back inside when he turned and walked back towards the house.
<br>
Well when we got back inside I asked my Mom how Aj got outside, my mom
looked at me funny and said that my Sister and Aj had left after we
went outside. I still dont know what to think about seeing the little
boy out there because my grandma lives in the middle of nowhere, and no
one other than my sister had a child with them.<br>

True Happenings<br>
<br>
By: missydavis@chiwest.com<br>
<br>
Hi, I just wanted to submit my story of some experiences we had in
house the my daughter and I Lived in from August 2001 to February of
2002.<br>
This house is located in Pendleton, OR.&nbsp;&nbsp; In July of 2001 we
lived in a small duplex that burned down.&nbsp; So my daughter and I
lived with my Mom for a short while then the Hospital I work for had a
house that no one was living in so we were able to rent it.&nbsp; This
house had a complete upstairs then another apartment downstairs.<br>
When we first moved in we didn&#8217;t notice anything at all then my Dad
moved in with us and lived in the downstairs apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
first thing that happened was in very early am&#8217;s like 4 a.m. we could
hear a baby crying from somewhere in the house but the exact location
could never be found.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then my Dad who was a true skeptic of
the supernatural actually admitted that he had seen a young woman in a
large brimmed red hat in the downstairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Both my daughter and I could here people walking up and down the
concrete steps that lead to the downstairs apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Short
before Christmas that year I was laying in bed mostly asleep but aware
of the house and I heard very distinct footstep coming up the back
steps, walk through the kitchen, dining room, living room and into my
bed room (I even heard the bags rustle at the end of my bed as they
walked by.&nbsp;&nbsp; I say straight up thinking it was my Dad coming
upstairs to tell me something and when I looked there was no one
there.&nbsp; I laid back down and heard the footsteps walk back out of
my room through the other two rooms and back down the stairs.<br>
One of the most interesting things that happened was that my daughter
loved to sing and she was recording herself sing on a very simple old
fashioned tape recorder.&nbsp; She sang three songs on the first one
everything was fine then on the second one it started out in her voice
then all of a sudden it was a man&#8217;s voice singing the song then that
song got over then it went back into her voice.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was so
scary we couldn&#8217;t believe it!<br>
Then right after the new year my Dad became very ill and was admitted
to the hospital for over a month.&nbsp; While he was gone the haunting
became even more noticeable.&nbsp;&nbsp; We would hear very loud voices
coming from downstairs and the TV turn and and just blair.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So I completely locked up the downstairs so no one could come or go
from the any of the entrances.&nbsp;&nbsp; One night my daughter and I
were watching TV and all of a sudden the TV downstairs came on so loud
it was shaking the the upstairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; You could hear people
walking around in circles in the kitchen and you could voices of two
mean argue/talking coming from the downstairs.<br>
We ended up having to move so I don&#8217;t know if any haunting continues
there or not the house has since been sold and new people live there
now and I&#8217;ve always wanted to ask them!<br>

The Thing in My House<br>
<br>
By: laura@titleamerica.us<br>
<br>
Hello, my name is Laura. I have had a lot of experiences in my life, a
lot of people say ghost follow me, and especially my sister-in-law ho
has been around me when things seem to happen. But I would like to
share two incidents in particular that scared my family and also
myself. The first story starts when we moved into my grandmother&#8217;s
house. Everybody in my family said it was haunted, but I did not
believe it, I have visited there and spent the night there a lot and
nothing to strange has happened that could not be explained. It was the
second night in the house and I was giving my daughter a bath. She was
taking her bath and I was sitting on the sink plucking my eyebrows,
when all of a sudden she turned to my and said, mommy there are red
eyes in here. I said what, where honey. She turned to show me and the
look on her face was that of sheer terror, I would never forget the
fear in her face. She let out a piercing scream and I was afraid, she
was acting like someone was coming after her. I ran, grabbed her out of
the tub we slipped to the door and I dove out of the room. My husband
was dead asleep on the couch, but he flew up and went into the bathroom
swinging his arms, he thought someone had broken in or something. She
really was freaking out. We were in the living room trying to calm her
down, she was hysterical. All she kept saying was, He's gonna get me,
don't let him get me. And we said who, and she said the man with the
eyes. We let her know she was okay and no body was coming for her. We
almost calmed her down and as soon as we said we wouldn't let anyone
get her and that she was safe, the garbage flung across the room and it
was loud. That started her back up again. That was the last incident
that night. My cousin was sleeping over one night and went home crying
cause I told her about the incident that happened and she got a little
to vocal to the ghost and a screwdriver flew off the fridge and hit her
in the stomach. There were happenings like doors opening, water turning
off, scratching at the doors, and on, and toys going off by themselves.<br>
Second story.<br>
We recently moved from FT. Lauderdale to S. Augustine. We actually
moved to Lake Butler. We lived out in the middle of nowhere. One day I
was up watching TV. I had nothing to drink and I do not do anything
else. Anyway I was watching TV and got distracted by something out the
window. It looked like a green glowing circle. It was about the size of
a golf ball and the light was gleaming off this thing. I was wondering
to myself what in the world. All of a sudden came another one, and then
another. In like two seconds time there seemed to be at least 10 and it
looked like they were trying to come through the window. I got scared
and turned my head, thinking it would go away. as I turned my head I
looked at the door window, and a flash of heat lightning or some kind
of flash lit up the window, and it looked like a man, almost
transparent, but not quite. He seemed dark, I don't know, anyway it
hard to explain, but it scared me so bad my body hurt.<br>
I ran to the window, closed the blinds, and ran to bed and forced
myself to sleep. Things still happen a lot, my family and I just choose
to ignore it.<br>
I hope you all don't think I am crazy. Thank you for listening<br>

Savannah GA Haunting<br>
<br>
By: Rebecca.Ivins@cox.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I saw this site and decided to finally tell what happened to me a few
years ago in Savannah, GA. I have been very hesitant to repeat this to
anyone as I was afraid I&#8217;d be met with skepticism and ridicule at best.
I&#8217;ve told a few close friends but since I can repeat it here without
fear of being harassed, then maybe I&#8217;ll get some answers or find
someone else who has experienced something similar. <br>
In the year 2001, I was working down on the historic river front of
Savannah, GA, a long strip of tourist shops right up against the
Savannah river that sees a large number of people each year. All of the
shops were built into pre-existing buildings that have been around
since the river front was being used as a shipping port back during the
colonization of Savannah. The walls of all the stores are the original
stonework and the ramps leading down to River Street are all paved with
the original ballast stones used by incoming ships. The buildings are
all separated into three floors; the bottom holds the store, the middle
is a sort of floating floor that you can only access up a steep flight
of steps and the third floor was all offices. There were two ways to
reach our third floor office, one was by walking outside and up one of
the ramps to a big glass door (which was usually sealed behind thick
wooden shutters, the other was to go up a cramped spiral, iron
stairwell hidden inside a closet in the truffle room. I tell you all
this so you can understand the history of the place and what it looked
like. Now, Savannah is supposedly very haunted but I had never put much
stock in any of that while I was living there. It wasn&#8217;t that I didn&#8217;t
believe ghosts couldn&#8217;t exist, it&#8217;s just I had never had any encounter
so it was never on my mind while I worked down there. <br>
The store I worked in was (and still is) called Savannah&#8217;s Candy
Kitchen. It&#8217;s four rooms of bright paint, old candy machines, and more
sugar than ANYONE should be around for long. I had been working there
for about two years already doing everything from making pralines to
dipping out ice cream on hot southern days. I&#8217;m a hard worker and
fairly practical so I quickly became an assistant manager of sorts and
was often assigned odd additional jobs around the store when the
management needed help.&nbsp; One April day, when things were slow, my
manager Tabitha sent me upstairs to the second floor to take inventory
of our chocolate truffles. One of my co-workers Shawn, was standing
just outside the doorway taking a smoke break while I counted. I heard
him head back down to the main store and then realized I had to use the
bathroom. (This is how you know I&#8217;m not lying, as this is utterly
UN-romantic) I didn&#8217;t want to wander all the way back down the narrow
staircase to the downstairs bathroom and remembered that the upstairs
floor had one too. No one was up on the third floor and I knew the big
wood doors covering the outside entrance were solidly chained shut;
that left the stairs behind the closet door of the room I was in. <br>
Not really thinking much of it, I headed up the stairs and reached the
door to the third floor. I remember it was very dark up there since no
light could get in through the closed main door. I walked in, closed
the door behind me so I wouldn&#8217;t get in trouble for being up there, and
then headed for where I knew the bathroom was. As I was sitting
there&#8230;.doing my business (like I said, VERY bad time for a haunting), I
hear the door to the downstairs open and VERY distinctive footfalls
coming into the hallway right outside the bathroom. Now I know I wasn&#8217;t
imagining them or exaggerating what I heard because I very clearly
remember thinking &#8220;Oh no, I didn&#8217;t lock the bathroom door and now
Tabitha is going to walk right in on me while I&#8217;m up here.&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t
scared at all, just embarrassed and worried she&#8217;d walk in on me. The
footsteps stopped right outside the door and I kept thinking &#8220;Please
don&#8217;t come in.&#8221; Then they moved on and headed for a back room that had
always sort of given me the creeps. We stored our newly dry-cleaned
uniforms back there. Once I was finished, I headed for the door,
expecting to see the hall light on or at least one of the lights in the
back room, when I opened the door, however, I found the whole upstairs
was just as dark as I&#8217;d left it. I KNOW I didn&#8217;t hear the footsteps
come back by and anyone leaving would have to have walked back past me.
<br>
I headed towards the back room slowly, calling Tabitha&#8217;s name but got
no answer. As I got within five feet of the dark doorway to the back
room, all the hair on my arms stood on end and my little internal
monkey ran up the nearest tree and started screaming. Every instinct I
had was yelling &#8220;RUN&#8221; so, suddenly terrified, I turned and raced for
the door that led back downstairs. I felt like something was chasing me
and still get chills thinking about it. When I reached the door, I
found that, despite the fact that I had closed it behind me coming up,
it was now wide open. I flew out the door onto the stairway landing and
wrenched the door shut behind me. I caught just before closing as if it
couldn&#8217;t slip the rest of the way shut, though I had never had problems
closing it before. Finally after a few moments of tugging, it was as if
someone let go of the other side and the door slammed home. I stood
back panting and trembling and as I stared at the door, I got a
terrible feeling of menace from the other side of it. <br>
I raced down the stairwell and out of the truffle room. I tore all the
way back down to the main store and then stood trembling in the
sunlight just outside the entrance. In the sun, things are always less
scary so the more practical part of my mind began coming up with
possible reasons for what happened. The first being that maybe Shawn or
Tabitha DID come up and I simply didn&#8217;t hear them leave. When I
confronted them both about it, however, Tabitha and Shawn assured me
that Shawn had been down in the praline window the whole time and
Tabitha had not left the store. I had about 6 other employee witnesses
who verified that fact. Everyone had been accounted for downstairs. <br>
I have spent a long time trying to tell myself it wasn&#8217;t a ghostly
encounter but everything I can come up with to debunk it has always
failed. I thought maybe that some tourist had come up by mistake but
then I remember that no one knows about the stairs behind the closet
door but the employees. I thought about the noise just being reflected
somehow from somewhere else but then I remember how convinced I was
that my manager had been standing right outside the bathroom door. I
can&#8217;t explain it and have finally stopped trying. <br>
I quit my job shortly thereafter and haven&#8217;t been back since.<br>
<br>

Playful Ghost<br>
<br>
By: orderdesk@pecdigital.com<br>
<br>
LAST AUGUST 2005 I WAS HOUSE SITTING FOR MY BOYFRIEND. IT HAD JUST GOT
DARK AND I WAS OUTSIDE CLEANING MY WINDOWS OF MY CAR. MY DAUGHTER WAS
ALSO WITH ME BUT SHE WAS INSIDE IN MY BOYFRIENDS ROOM WHICH WAS TOWARDS
THE BACK. I WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE PASSENGER CLEANING THE WINDOW AND
HEARING&nbsp; MUSIC WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN FROM THE FRONT DOOR OF THE
HOUSE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE SIDE OF THE DRIVER SIDE TO THE BACK END
OF THE CAR I SEE A WHITE STREAK.<br>
WELL&nbsp; OF COURSE I WAS CLEANING THE WINDOWS AND NOT LOOKING THAT
WAY BUT I COULD SEE IT IN THE CORNER OF MY EYE. WELL I STARTED LAUGHING
AND STARTED TO WALK TOWARDS THE BACK OF THE CAR TO TELL MY DAUGHTER
HA,HA YOUR FUNNY TRYING TO SCARE ME, WELL TO MY SURPRISE THERE WAS NO
ONE THERE. IT JUST STOPPED ME IN MY TRACKS. WELL MY DAUGHTER WALKED OUT
OF THE HOUSE AND TOLD HER WHAT HAPPENED AND SHE SAID IT WAS NOT HER.
BECAUSE SHE WAS WEARING A WHITE SHIRT.<br>
BUT THERE WAS NO NOISE, NO FOOT STEPS. I FORGOT TO MENTION, AS THE
WHITE SHADOW WAS GOING BY THE SIDE OF THE CAR THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR WAS
OPEN ALL THE WAY HE CLOSED IT WHEN HE WENT BY. THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT IT
WAS MY DAUGHTER BUT IT WAS NOT. IT DID NOT SCARE ME, I GUESS BECAUSE MY
BOYFRIEND HAD MENTIONED TO ME ABOUT THE GHOST AND THAT HE LIKES TO PLAY
AROUND. HE SEEMED TO LIKE ME AND LIKED TO PLAY AROUND WITH ME BECAUSE I
STOOD THERE FOR A WHOLE WEEK BY MYSELF AND I FELT COMFORTABLE AND NOT
SCARED AND HE DID NOT BOTHER ME WHEN I SLEPT OR ANY OTHER TIME THAN
THAT, WELL UNTIL HE DECIDED TO PLAY WITH ME. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING<br>

Gadsden Experience<br>
<br>
By: k.cranford@comcast.net<br>
<br>
One night me and a few of my friends decided to ride out to hinds road
in Gadsden to see if the stories we heard were true, only it was a
different story, not the one of the witch. It was something along the
lines of a girl on prom night got murdered on the bridge and supposably
has been seen along the bridge, but her face is now all twisted up. We
went out there and waited outside the car for about an hour. Right as
we got in the car to leave, we caught a glimpse of a girl in a dress
run in front of the car.&nbsp; The next day we went back out there in
the daylight and the same big rock I was sitting on the night before,
had a pair of white, formal dress shoes sitting on it.<br>

people talking to my baby why I was in the bedroom her room is right
conected to mine she is 2.and again I didnt fill any harm she was
crying and somelady said shh its ok,and no one else was in the house.
sometimes i smell perfume just come and it goes but its not my

I just came across your website after having a ghost experience, not quite encounter.<br>
I moved into a new townhome about 3 months ago. Everything was fairly
normal except that it seems as though someone was walking on the roof.
The townhome was only one story high, with vaulted ceilings. The
townhome is more spanish style so it has a flat roof. My parents said
it was just birds or animals on top, and nothing to worry about. So
about two weeks before christmas (after about 2 months of living there)
I woke up in the middle of the night to see a girl in my closet. the
girl was glowing and was white, though I could see her figure very
well. She had longer brown hair, a sailor type of dress &amp; a very
large wide brimmed white hat. Though all of it was white, I could still
see her color. She was just looking through my closet and seemed to
pull off the clothes and hold the clothes with her arms up as though
she were looking at the entire piece and then put it up to her as
though to see if it fit her. It was very strange, I didn't have a bad
feeling, but rather a nervous or anxious feeling with butterflies in my
stomach. After that I got a roommate who says she has thought the same
thing, only that her radio's tapeplayer would be playing and sounding
as the tape were stuck, but there was no tape and she didn't press the
play button. She also said she saw a figure under the blanket on the
couch, but there was no person there, just a figure. This past week I
could here someone in the bathroom jiggling the toilet handle. When I
looked into the bathroom, I didn't see anything. I just received a new
bathrobe and I have my bathrobe hanging on the door and I saw it trying
to come off the hook, but it couldn't get off. I think that she was
trying to get it off the hook to put it on. Also, alot of my underwear
has been coming out of my underwear drawer and on the floor when I get
home. I believe it is a younger girl (as my roommate is about 8 years
older than I and said she hasn't noticed the girl trying or looking in
her closet). I think that she must be lost and she feels at home with
us girls and has just stayed there. It is kind of a creepy yet ok
feeling with me.<br>
Just thought I would share that story.<br>

Living at Home<br>
<br>
By: admin.desk@darlingtoncab.co.uk<br>
<br>
First time I have been to your site.<br>
I was living at home with my parents 1991 I was troubled by vivid
dreams.&nbsp; I would dream that I was in a terrace house that was
brightly lit and with a front parlour.&nbsp; There was an elderly lady
with a me and a man that was dressed smart suit with a high collar, the
Elderly lady was dressed in dark clothing with a white shawl on her
shoulders I noticed red roses in the shawl.&nbsp; This lady would smile
and talk to me and tell me not to be afraid.&nbsp; I would stand behind
a sofa that faced a fireplace with a black stove in.&nbsp; The elderly
lady was the only who would talk to me.&nbsp; The lady asked me about
my family and I would talk about my family for a while.&nbsp; The man
in the suit stood in front of the fireplace and never moved our spoke
to me.<br>
This dream would occur on regular basis nothing changed the elderly lady would talk to me about my family.&nbsp; <br>
I never told anyone about the dream until one day I was talking to my
mother and I mentioned the dream with the elderly lady and the man in
the suit.&nbsp; My mother asked me to describe the room and what the
elderly lady looked like.&nbsp; When I described the shawl she told me
that it was her grandmother's favourite shawl and that as a little girl
she use to wear it.&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother never mentioned her
Grandmother to me and has no pictures of the Grandmother.&nbsp; But I
described the house and the Grandmother to a tee.<br>
That same year my father passed away suddenly. I do not know if this is
a ghost story however, it has stayed with me and I think they must of
known that my father was to suddenly pass on.&nbsp; <br>
The man in suite according to my mother was a brother of her
Grandmother who was killed in the first world war.&nbsp; My mother only
ever saw pictures of the man in the suite.<br>
I have not been back to the dream since that time.<br>

Man in my Room?<br>
<br>
By: acostam@gmail.com<br>
<br>
I've been a little addicted to reading the stories on this site and
finally decided to send in my own experience. I'm not sure if what I
experienced was my imagination, but maybe it would help if someone
could confirm it for me. <br>
I lived in the same house and in the same room from 3 age of 3 to 18.
It was in Miami, FL so it was a relatively new house (built in the
1950s or 60s). My mother was always the type to experience strange
things and even see spirits walking across our backyard. Anyway, as I
go older (around 13 or 14) strange things happened in my room. I almost
always felt like I was being watched. And I felt that whatever presence
in my room was a male. I felt so uneasy that most nights I slept with
the light on (even until i was 17). Often, I would feel a thump on my
pillow that would wake me all of a sudden and i would shoot up in bed.
Once, I had to call my dad to stay in my room with me until I fell
asleep. Another night I was so frightened I went to his room. As I was
starting to calm anddrift back to sleep I heard a voice say clearly in
my ear " I love you." I shut my eyes and pretended not to hear it. <br>
Little things would happen over the years like the inside of a thermos
I was holding exploding and shooting shards all over my floor or a
sheet of paper lift up off my dresser and fly behind it. I angrily told
"it" that this was MY room and it had to leave, but that didn't change
anything. Even once when I was half asleep, I felt lips kissing mine
and i kissed back before i realized what was going on and sat up. The
thing that convinced me though, was the time when I was 16 or so and i
was talking on the phone in the dark to my boyfriend. I felt a towel
slid off the headboard (I had a metal daybed). I ignored thinking that
maybe i hadn't place it right. I think "he/it" didn't like that I
didn't pay attention because a minute later as I was sitting up, a hair
clip thudded against my pillow. I had no idea where it came from but it
startled me and I left the room. <br>
At 19 I went away to college, but came back to visit during break. The
pillow thudding happened again, but this time I completely ignored it
and it didn't happen again, although I still felt a presence. The next
time I came home, my brother (who I told all of this to) told me that
my mom had the room cleansed. Although I wasn't sure if she had, I
never did feel a presence there again. whatever it was, left. <br>

Children and Ghosts<br>
<br>
By: kimberlylakes@bellsouth.net<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;My name is Diana and I wrote into your website last night as my
husband had just finished explaining to me an experience he had while
spending the night in our home which is under reconstruction due to
hurricane damage. We have lived in that house for 4 1/2 years and have
dealt with alot of ghost activity since we moved in. I am sure having 2
teenagers in the home ( 1 being a girl) did not help matters. I wanted
to share another incident which I remember while reading you section on
children and ghosts. About 2 years ago, when my youngest son was
between 6 &amp; 7 yrs old, he came screaming into our room one night.
He shared a bedroom across the hall with his older brother who had
spent the night elsewhere. They had bunk beds and my little man slept
on the lower bunk that night since his brother was not home. <br>
&nbsp;What he described was an old lady that looked like a witch. He
swears she woke him up by pullling his feet. He was very adament when
telling us this and kept saying over and over again that he was awake
while this happened, I believed him by the look in his eyes. Pure fear!
The witch he described had evil eyes and rotten sharp teeth, was
dressed in black and had sharp nails, he said her skin was rotten too.
She pulled at his legs waking him up, he said he looked down at his
feet and saw her fly up to the upper bunk, that's when she leaned over
the end of the top bunk and hung upside down at the foot of the lower
bunk, reaching for him and laughing. That was when he came running into
our room. He would not go into that room alone for a few months, let
alone sleep in there if his brother was gone. He started sleeping with
a&nbsp; big plastic TREX dinosaur that he had in his toy box, which
actually looks pretty real. When I asked why he picked that toy to
sleep with, he explained that the dinosaur had teeth, and if the witch
came back, the dinosaur would protect him against her. <br>
&nbsp;I tried to chalk it up to a childs nightmare or maybe something
he had seen on tv recently, but his belief in what he saw was very
convincing. He was and still is very adamant that this really happened.
He is an extremely bright child. Anyway, I just wanted to share this
story in relation to children who experience ghost sightings. And just
for the record, to date, the witch has not returned.<br>

Cemetery Visit<br>
<br>
By: beautifulgoodbye2@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
This is my third story I am sending to you.&nbsp; This one takes place
at Spook Hallow in St.James Missouri.&nbsp; The very first time we
visited the graveyard at the end of the road, well we didn't make it
there.&nbsp; About two or three miles before the cemetery as we were
driving around a curve,&nbsp; there was a woman walking the road.&nbsp;
As we passed her we noticed she was covered in blood.&nbsp; We turned
around and she came up to the window,&nbsp; she kept saying "let me
in".&nbsp; She told us she had wrecked her car.&nbsp; We called for
help.&nbsp; <br>
The next time we went out there.&nbsp; My friend Noel and my boyfriend
Mike had just stepped out of the car to go into the graveyard when what
sounded like a rock hit the metal barrel used as a trash can not far
from the car.&nbsp; Well they both jumped back in and we started to
take off.&nbsp; Mike was watching out the back window when he starting
saying GO!!!&nbsp; There was a black "figure" not chasing us but
"floating" after us.&nbsp; As we went around a curve it
dissappeared.&nbsp; We stopped at a gas station in town.&nbsp; As we
got out of the car I walked around the back of it and noticed hand
prints on the tailgate that hadn't been there before we went out
there.&nbsp;&nbsp; And there was a face on the passenger side
mirror.&nbsp; Like someone had pressed they're face against it and it
was small like a childs.&nbsp; Our third trip was the scariest of
all.&nbsp; We made it the cemetery.&nbsp; Well there was no way I was
getting out of the car.&nbsp; Ashley and Betty wouldn't get out
either.&nbsp; So Mike, Noel, and Joanna got out and went into the
emetery to look at the grave stones.&nbsp; While they were out there
freaky things were happening in the vehicle.&nbsp; The electric locks
where going up and down nonstop.&nbsp; We were trying to hold them down
and keep a look out for "other" things.&nbsp; Well the locks stopped
and that's when I heard heavy breathing from beside me.&nbsp; I thought
it was Ash or Betty but I looked at both of them (Ash was sitting in
front, me in the middle seat of the durango, and betty in the very
back) and neither one of them was breathing heavy.&nbsp; Ashley heard
it two because she looked at me and said I coming back by you.&nbsp;
All of us were almost in tears when we see the others running back to
the car.&nbsp; They got in and Nikki (Noel) took off.&nbsp; They said
the first tombstone they looked at had 666 on it and then they heard
strange noises from the woods.&nbsp; <br>
Needless to say I won't be going back there any time soon.&nbsp; We were not wanted their.<br>

"Seeing Ghosts"<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Tiakh@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
My name is Rebecca,&nbsp; I started to "see" ghosts when I was 8yrs
old.......&nbsp; My then best friend Carrie had gone to her Grandpa's
funeral the week before and it was her first day back.&nbsp; While we
were waiting for the traffic to slow down so we could cross the street,
we sat on the grass by the sidewalk.&nbsp; She was telling me about the
necklace that he had given her when she was 5.&nbsp; She told me that
when he gave it to her, He said "As long as you have this necklace, I
will always be with you",&nbsp; as she said those words the hair on the
left side of my body just seemed to stand up and I got a cold chill on
that side,&nbsp; I turned to look and there beside me in the grass were
2 man sized footprints.&nbsp; I reached over and said "Carrie
Look!!!"&nbsp; and the grass started to stand up as if someone had
stepped away....&nbsp;&nbsp; that was the first of many, many
encounters.&nbsp; I live in a haunted house and I wouldn't have it
anyother way.&nbsp; They have their ways of letting me know if somone
doesnt belong in my house,&nbsp; They alert me to danger..(they woke me
up out of a dead sleep and made me go check on the kids, seconds before
a tree came down on the house.&nbsp; I had fallen asleep on my
balcony..... the tree landed on my balcony)&nbsp; Now I have countless
others that I could tell.... most good, some bad... some just eerie...
but I wont bore you.<br>

Attending his Own Funeral<br>
<br>
By: vadmike@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
<br>
This is a story from my grandfathers&#8217; funeral.<br>
You must understand that my grandfather was a very spiritual man and as far<br>
as I know he had done right by everyone that knew him.&nbsp; Perhaps this is why<br>
he, in my opinion, was allowed to attend his own funeral.<br>
I, myself never saw him but before the funeral began my younger sister,<br>
still not quite sure of what was going on asked why we were at the church?<br>
My mother told her that we were there for Grandpa Reed&#8217;s funeral.<br>
My sister looked at my mother puzzled and my mother asked what the matter<br>
was?<br>
My sister replied &#8220;if it is Grandpa Reed&#8217;s funeral, why is he standing over<br>
at the door greeting people?&#8221;<br>
Both myself and my mother looked we could see nothing but my sister age 5<br>
was insistent that it was grandpa.&nbsp; I have no reason to doubt my sister&#8217;s<br>
knowledge of her grandpa; he held her and played with her just as a<br>
grandfather should.<br>
Of note, when my sister was younger she had a disease which required several<br>
operations.&nbsp; A couple of weeks after her operation, we took her to church<br>
and she saw a picture of Christ and she acted as she recognized the picture.<br>
My mother asked her about Christ and my sister said that he is very nice<br>
and has the prettiest eyes and that he played with her while she was in the<br>
hospital.<br>
I do believe my sister, she was only a small child at the time which makes<br>
all the more sense to believe her.<br>
Thanks again for the wonderful site<br>

Adding my Story<br>
<br>
By: r.wakelin1@ntlworld.com<br>
<br>
Hi i have always loved reading the ghost stories on this page and now
ive decided to put in my own story. I am 18 years old and live in the
midlands, UK. When i was around 4, 5 years old i would often tell me
Aunty that people would speak to me in the night and can only vagily
remember hearing a women who would tell me to be quiet and she would
often make a hushing sound my sister who a shared a room with would
also hear these nosies.&nbsp; We would also hear the sound of someone
walking up the satirs and onto the landing .However when i was 8 years
old and moved into my own room the voice were no more. Howevre the
walking sound continued and i often felt as though whatever it was
would stand firstly by my room snd then my younger sister. This
experience seemed to lessen and by the time i was 14 years old this
hardly ever happened. I then moved rooms again to my parents room as we
were having an extension built on the house. Well things strted to
happen again, long bangs could be heard downstairs it seemed to be as
if someone was picking things up and then throwing them to the ground ,
my mum and dad were kept up all night at one point by theses banigng. I
would also often hear someone walking around downsatirs and opening
doors when everyone was asleep. Then soemhting else happend my dad had
his bag stolen at work so we had to chnage the keys to our house, after
thsi me and my sister would often hear the sound of someone trying
desperatly to open the door, we thoutht we were being broekn into so we
asked my dad to investigate, howver nothing was there. One night me my
sister and a friend were sitting in my room which is at the front of
the house at about 11:00pm suddenly we heard the sound of someone
tryingt ot get in we looked outside and could hear no one but could
still hear the sound of soemone trying to get in , we went in to tell
my dad for a moment before doing this we stood at the top of the stirs
staring at the door no one was there but the noise could still be heard
my father went to investagate, nothing. This continued happen for about
a week until one night the front door actually sounded like it had been
opened someone walked into the corider into the living room and then
nothing?weird! me and my sister had also heard someone coming into both
and rooms and on two nights at the same time heard a women singing an
old folk song, i and a friend had also seen a women dresses in old
clothing at the top of our stairs i had alwyas believed thus to be my
great grandmother as the spirit looked like her. However my theory is
that the perosn trying to get into the house was my grandmother she had
died a year before the extension and before this she was alwys let
herself in with her own key, it was as if she could not get in any more
because of the new lock of the door. After this nothing at all happend!<br>

Guardian Ghost<br>
<br>

<br>
It all started when i moved my second time in flagstaff.. i moved to
cheshire right across from where i boarded my horse.. when we moved
there i was about 6 or 7 when strange things started happening. The
first ocurance was when i was sleeping in my room with my dog shadow..
i was watching tv and slowly drifting to sleep.. as i heard my dog
start to growl.. so i just reached down and assured her that no one was
there.. as i turned to look at my tv i noticed it was fuzzy .. i
thought it might have just been bad weather or something so i turned
and tried to sleep again.. i now started to feel very cold.. so i
looked down at my heating blanket switch to see if it was on.. as i
looked the cords started to shake violently but no one was there to
move it.. my dog continued to growl .. so i just burried under the
blankets and tried to sleep.. i finally did .. nothing seemed to happen
the next few days until i tried telling my mom about it she assured me
i had an overactive imagination so i ignored it.. that night i heard
scratching on my walls .. it seemed to be all around me .. i told my
mothr but she said the same things.. so i moved again my mom and my dad
(divorced) so my dad moved again in flagstaff and my mother moved to
doney park.. my first strange incodent at my fathers new house was when
i had a sleepover with my best friend i was around 11 or so and we went
back to my room right as we did the tv turned static.. we ignored it
and shut it off right as we were about to go to sleep it turned back on
we then changed it to a working channel and left it on.. form then on i
have left it on every night .. but now sometimes a feel cold around me
when i sleep like someone is holding me.. also when i take a shower
sometimes the curtain blows in for no reason no windows will be open or
anything and the shower head will move by itself.. also there will be
steam in the bathroom i will start to feel a very strange chill and
when i get out there was no sign of it being there. . no for my moms
house its different .. my sister and i were in the bunk bed she got top
and i got bottom.. i awoke around 3 or so in the morning and saw red
and silver baloons filling the room.. the were beautiful as the
moonlight gleamed off of them.. my sister awoke and we had a small
converasation of them and wondered why they were here.. we came to the
conclusion that my 15th b-day was coming up soon and it was an early
surprise.. my sister than got up and went to turn on the lights and she
stepped on one i told her to be careful and she turned on the lights ..
nothing was there.. then my sisters and i got curious one night and
tape recorded sounds in the room.. we heard a lot of starnge breathing
noises and mumbles we couldnt make out .. but we were all silent when
we did this,,, everything has kind of cooled down since untill last
week when my step dad and i were standing by the door his back was
turned and i was talking to him.. all of a sudden we both jumped to the
sound of the door slamming behind him and the cat jumping threw it as
if the cat had gotten out and someone threw her back in.. we turned
around only to find the door was locked.. these are a few of the
strange things that have happened there are more i am willing to share
to anyone who is willing to listen.. my e-mail is listed at the top..
please i would like to know what is going on my step dad and i both
believe it is something to do with ghosts and he has had some strange
experiences himself.. i still feel occasional cool sensations in the
bed or shower at both houses mainly fathers.. <br>

I have seen a Ghost<br>
<br>
By: ryan_keffer04@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
My name is Ryan and im only 14 years old, yet i have seen a ghost. It
happened when i was 12 years old. I used to sleep on bunk beds with my
brother. he had the bottom bunk and i had the top bunk. at the time my
brother was only 9 years old and he really didn't know much about
ghosts and the supernatural, but i did. Well I was in my bunk bed and I
was sleeping until i woke up to use the restroom. I went to the
restroom and when i was going back up my bed i felt really weird like
somthing was watching me. I went back to sleep and I woke up but didnt
open my eyes yet (I was trying to go back to sleep) but i got that
feeling again. I opened my eyes and i saw the figure of a man looking
straight at me and I was scared out of my mind......Then the figure
reach out its arm over the bunk and it touch my elbow. Right when it
did that i jump to the other end of of my bed and turned on thye
lights. I still dont know what the figure was but i think it was my
dad. My Dad had died when i was only 3 years old. I think he came that
night to remind me that he is always going to be there no matter what.<br>

Some Bad Some Not<br>
<br>
By: bizzaro_68@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
My name is Josh, I'm 23 and I've seen quite a few let's say other
worldly things.&nbsp; I like to look for them, if someone tells me a
place is haunted I want to investigate.&nbsp; It started with a house I
used to live in in Oklahoma.&nbsp; I remember you could always hear if
someone was coming down the hall or something because the thick carpet
would make a brushing sound.&nbsp; One night when I was 8 or 9 I woke
up to that noise thinking my dad had gone down the hall then I realized
it was in my room.&nbsp; The room had enough light to see due to a
streetlight filtering through a window.&nbsp; I saw a very tall....
something....... walking through the room,&nbsp; it stopped at the foot
of my bed and turned it's head towards me.&nbsp; At this point I'm
scared stiff, hoping beyond hope that it doesn't see me.&nbsp; I
noticed it's arms and legs were too long and skinny.&nbsp; It curled
it's arm and hand closest to me up and the fingers were abnormally long
and pointy looking and in the sillouette of it's head I could see ears
sticking out that also almost seemd pointy, it went on it's way and
just kind of faded out.&nbsp; I've seen shadows of this thing since
then as we still own the house and go and check on it from time to
time. and once I think I got shoved by it&nbsp; I wen into a room and
felt someone shove me hard enough to knock me down.&nbsp; This is not
an easy thing to do as I am not a small guy. I've many more stories but
for now I'll share one more.&nbsp; Between here a burkburnett theres a
ghost town called Clara.&nbsp; I think y'all have something about it on
your site.&nbsp; I've been at the cemetary at all times of the night
and I've never seen, heard or felt anything out of the ordinary there,
but I was coming back from burk one night on my bike, i like the back
road due to the twists, moving about 80 or so when I saw some deer just
before the old clara church.&nbsp; I slowed down to about 30, hitting a
deer at 80 on a motorcycle would probably land me in that
cemetary.&nbsp; Well I got past the church and cemetary when way up in
my head light I see something that looks like a small child walking
towards me in the ditch.&nbsp; Thinking there was maybe a wreck I
slowed down. As I got closer I noticed this kid was all white, like an
albino or something, but not only that his clothes were white
too.&nbsp; when I got close enough to make out his features he raised
his arms as if trying to flag me down, then I saw his eyes....or lack
thereof. his eye sockets were empty holes, he opened his mouth as if to
say something and I could see right through his mouth to the grass
behind him.&nbsp; Now that I think about it, I should've stopped at the
time it took me so off guard that I slammed the throttle back and went
triple digits all the way home.&nbsp; I've been back but never seen
this aparition again, it scared me due to the lack of eyes.&nbsp; Eyes
are a big thing to me and odd eyes offten unnerve me the lack of them
when I could tell this child was looking at me chilled me deeply.<br>

Wandering Souls<br>
<br>
By: Songstress1310@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello, my name is Meghan and the following little stories I am about to
tell are kinda creepy. My fiance and his family live in Indiana in a
little area known as Bright, which is by Lawrenceburg. The road that my
fiance's family home is off of is called Mt. Pleasant Road. It's a
rather long and winding road that was the site of Capt. Morgan's Raid,
which happened during the Civil War and the unrest that occurred. When
Capt. Morgan blazed down that narrow country road, he burned all the
houses and pillaged and plundered. My fiance's house is a relatively
new one situated on 17 acres of land. Now, these first occurances were
told to me by my fiance.<br>
My fiance, Jeff, believes that his house is haunted. When I first
started going out with him, I thought he was just joking with me b/c he
knows that I scare easy and I have an over-active imagination. The
first story he told me went like this: He was coming home from hanging
out with his family and it was late at night. The driveway to his house
is a quarter of a mile long and as it nears the house, has a slight
grade to it. As his mother was pulling up to the house and was getting
ready to go into the garage, he said her headlights flashed in the
living room and he saw a dark figure standing in the living room and
peering out the window. When his mother cut off her headlights, the
figure disappeared. Also, Jeff says there are cold spots in the house
and that his bedroom door opens by itself and the door to the basement
opens and closes by itself and the lights down there turn on and off.<br>
Recently, I was over his parents house with him and I got to experience
some of the creepy stuff that goes on there. His parents had just
finished the basement and we decided to spend the night there at the
house in the new bedroom in the basement. It was about 2 am and we had
been watching TV and we decided to go to sleep. We went into the
bedroom and laid down on the bed, but instead of falling asleep, we
started to argue. He finally said to me, "i don't want to talk to you
for the rest of the night." I didn't answer him but we both heard a
voice, quite female in timbre, and it sounded like it had a crackle of
electricity behind it. We both sat up and asked each other is we had
heard it. We both did. Jeff got up and grabbed the camcorder that was
downstairs and turned it on. I think he was hoping to find some actauly
footage that proved we weren't crazy. He also went upstairs to see if
anyone was awake. No one was and no one had a TV on.<br>
Could my fiance's house be haunted? The history to the area would
surely say so. He and his father and brother found what was called a
"slave wall" that borders their property and they found belongings
strewn around the wall. Also, his brother and he have seen odd lights
late at night floating by their lake. And after my experience, I
believe.<br>

Strange Happenings in my Family<br>
<br>
By: dblack@prpi.com<br>
<br>
We have had many strange happenings in our family since I was about 5 years old. I am now 39.&nbsp; <br>
The first event I recall hearing my parents talking about was my father
seeing the devil at the end of his bed when he was a teenager. He
apparently had the flu with a high fever.&nbsp; He called his my mother
(my grandmother) into the room and she swore it was her dead
mother!!!&nbsp; I always had a hard time believing that because of his
fever and thought he must have imagined it but then so many other
things happened in our family after that.<br>
I think I was about 5 and remember my mother and grandmother (father's
mother) talking through the years about my mother waking in the middle
of the night because she felt something poking her.&nbsp; She got up
and turned on the light, and their laid my father with all of the
artificial roses from the nightstand surrounding his body and he had a
crown of roses around his head. My grandparents (father's parents)
lived with us at the time and when my mother screamed they came
running.&nbsp; My grandmother swore it was her mother again.&nbsp; I
don&#8217;t know what made her say that but she always said she knew it was.<br>
I think the third thing I remember happening is my parents were
watching television one night when I was about nine or ten years old
and my mother said "Dawn, get in bed." I heard her say this and was
confused because I was laying in my bed reading the story, Black
Beauty.&nbsp; When I shouted "I am in bed." My father said "stop lying,
we can see you standing right there in the hallway." I again said "I am
in bed." My mother came in and said "Stop lying, we just saw you and
heard you get a drink of water in the kitchen." She then looked at me
and asked me why I had changed my pajamas.&nbsp; Apparently, her and my
father saw me standing in the hallway with a pair of white pajamas with
red anchors and when my mother came into the room,&nbsp; I had green
and white striped pajamas on. My mother was obviously upset with me and
opened up my bureau drawer and there were my red anchor pajamas
folded.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t believe it. That same night I was still
reading and heard a tapping on my window and I said "Mom, somebody is
outside!!" Her and my dad went out and didn&#8217;t see anything but I saw a
grayish cloud at the end of my bed floating and started to feel it
coming over me. I could hardly move but managed to scream and my
parents came running and it went out the window like a puff of smoke. I
swore after that night I was never wearing those pajamas or reading
Black Beauty ever again!!!<br>
There was another time around the same age that we were all having
dinner. Again, my grandparents lived with us.&nbsp; As we all were
sitting there eating, we heard footsteps go down the basement stairs as
if they were in a hurry.&nbsp; We all just looked at each other and
said "What was that?" This was strange because the kitchen door was in
view and the downstairs steps were right across from the door and no
one had come in nor had anyone come up and into the kitchen. My father
and grandfather went down into the basement and searched every nook and
cranny there was and found nothing. <br>
In this same neighborhood I just spoke of, our next door neighbor was
coming home about 3 a.m. and as he got out of his car and as he was
walking up his drive he said he could feel someone behind me. He said
he started running for his front door and just as he stepped in
something swatted at him. When he looked out later, the screen was
torn. I often wondered if the neighborhood was haunted but then was
confused because of the story my father had told from his youth about
seeing the devil and then my mother seeing those roses on my father in
another house when I was smaller. Plus this was a time when everyone
was talking about Big Foot so I never really believed it. <br>
I don&#8217;t think it was till I was about 20 when the next experience
happened. My younger brother had been a troubled youth with drugs and
alcohol and my parent's were at their rope's end so I said he could
come stay with my husband and I for the weekend in Philadelphia.&nbsp;
When my brother came, we were sitting there having coffee and a saw a
blackish figure out of the corner of my eye, looked over at my brother
and he had this strange look on his face. He asked me "Do you see
that?" I said "Yes I do!!!" I was trembling but at this point I was so
sick of all this happening that I was determined it wasn&#8217;t going to
anymore and I said to my brother "just ignore it!" We did and it
disappeared.&nbsp; For the next several hours my brother told me
stories of how we saw demons all the time and it scared him so
much.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know if it really was demons he was seeing or if
it were his drugs so I just blew it off and didn&#8217;t really let it bother
me.<br>
I moved to Virginia Beach probably in my mid 20's and the day we moved
into our new house, I don&#8217;t know what it was that made me do it, but I
went over to the fireplace and prayed and asked God not to let anything
happen in this house. It never did. <br>
After all these years, I finally thought it was over until last week
when my father called and said he had another experience.&nbsp; He said
he was laying on the bottom of the bed watching poker, when he thought
he heard the bathroom fan come on downstairs.&nbsp; He said then all of
a sudden, he saw my mother come around the bed, and she bent down and
put her ear to the floor. He said "Hun, what are you doing?" and
started to get up. As he reached back on the bed to help push himself
up, he felt my mother's body and there she was asleep.&nbsp; He looked
at her and she had on a red robe. The woman he saw had on a blue and
white flowered house dress. He woke my mother up and told her and she
said "That had to be your mother (my now dead grandmother of 10 years)
because she had a house dress just like that and I don&#8217;t own one.<br>

Uncles Home<br>
<br>
By: AlliedNelson@aol.com<br>
<br>
I always knew there was something different about my uncles house. <br>
many things have happened there, many stories. It all started about
sixteen years ago when my aunt would wake up to find her husband{my
uncle} chasing somebody down the hallway with a gun. He always told us
that he would wake up and find a man standing in the hallway staring at
him laying in bed, but every time he gets up there would be no one
there and all the doors would be bolted shut from the inside. There was
also one night he was down in the basement watching a football game
about nine O clock at nighttime when all the sudden he said he felt
somebody massage his shoulders. My aunt would later tell me that he
come running up those stairs like all hell broke loose shaking and with
third degree goose bumps. now keep in mind my uncle is a two hundred
and forty something man,whom stands at six feet seven inches. what
could scare a man like that, I don't know but I never want to live to
see it. there have been many more incidents such as him being down in
the basement and him hearing some woman call his name from the eerie
weight room. Also if you go down in the basement you will begin to
smell fresh smoke coming from the bar in which nobody smokes in that
house.It was always rumored that my late great grandma Elsie is doing
the haunting.<br>
Its calmed down over the years or so I heard.<br>

Germany Barracks<br>
<br>
<br>
By: joshua.k.crawford@balad.iraq.centcom.mil<br>
<br>
My name is Specialist Crawford.&nbsp; I am in the 181st Transportation
Battalion.&nbsp; I lived for a year in Room 303 of Turley
Barracks.&nbsp; I&#8217;m now currently deployed to Iraq.&nbsp; When I return
I will be going to Babenhausen.&nbsp; I was online looking for some
information on my new duty station in Babenhausen when I came across
your site.&nbsp; I was shocked to see that you went into that much
detail&#8230; I mean down to the room that I lived in.&nbsp; I both wanted to
confirm some of what was said and perhaps add some new
information.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
As far as a little girl in my room, I&#8217;ve never seen one.&nbsp; I have
however experienced the cold.&nbsp; I will have the two heaters in the
room turned full blast and the room will still freeze during certain
hours of the night.&nbsp; I would have to say that the hallway of the
3rd floor is more haunted than any particular room.&nbsp; Myself and
other soldiers have all experienced some of the same things
there.&nbsp; The hallway is very long and old.&nbsp; On the inner part
of the hallway there are several WWI gunracks embedded into the walls
on the other side of the hallway there are large 8 foot windows that
line the hallway.&nbsp; At around 2 or 3 at night I have experienced
some very strange things.&nbsp; In the 3rd floor latrine, after using
the bathroom proceeded to wash my hands.&nbsp; As I looked in the
mirror I saw a person standing in the door to the hallway.&nbsp; It was
a man with brown hair and an unkept beard&#8230; like someone who had not
shaven in about a week.&nbsp; It was only a glance but he appeared to
be wearing a brown t shirt like most military guys but it didn&#8217;t seem
like the one we normally wear.&nbsp; This man was staring at me.&nbsp;
I know everyone in my building so this face was new&#8230; as I turned around
there was nobody there.&nbsp; I looked out into the hallway and there
was noone there&#8230; the hallway is long so you can hear people
walking.&nbsp; This disturbed me&#8230; as I walked back I felt as if someone
was following me down the hall.&nbsp; I turned back several times but
nothing was there.&nbsp; As I said I live in room 303.&nbsp; It is the
last room on the corner.&nbsp; There are about 4 more rooms beyond mine
but nobody lived there.&nbsp; The stairwell on that side of the
building is nolonger in use either.&nbsp; <br>
We deployed to Iraq in October of 05.&nbsp; About a month before that
we moved from our building into a newly renovated building.&nbsp; They
hadn&#8217;t hooked up the phones in the new building yet so late at night I
would sneak over to the old barracks and make phone calls.&nbsp; I did
this on 5 instances.&nbsp; The building was locked up but there was a
window on the backside that I knew was unlocked.&nbsp; I was the only
one in the building.&nbsp; I would walk up to the 2nd floor which is
where the payphone is and call home.&nbsp; I could hear footsteps on
the 3rd floor when I knew for a fact that I was the only one in the
building.&nbsp; I would call out &#8220;who&#8217;s there?&#8221;&nbsp; Nobody would
answer and the footsteps would continue sporatically from above on the
3rd floor.&nbsp; This happened each time I was there.<br>
A few other soldiers have seen the guy in the mirror&#8230; and just about
everyone has heard the footsteps when they were the only one in the
hallway.&nbsp; I hope what I said is useful.&nbsp; I was never a
supersticious person but after living at Turley with it&#8217;s Nazi past&#8230; I
don&#8217;t doubt anymore.&nbsp; And after looking at your site&#8230; I have a
feeling that Babenhausen should be an experience.<br>

No One Else Home<br>
<br>
<br>
By: mrestain@suffolk.lib.ny.us<br>
<br>
<br>
Hi. I enjoy reading all the ghost stories and thought I would tell
mine. I am a mother of three and live on Long Island. My father passed
away 15 years ago. Shortly after, I moved in with my boyfriend and got
married.<br>
Less than two years later we had a baby boy. He is thirteen now. <br>
We moved to a new house, a small bungalow by the water with two
bedrooms that are next to each other and share one wall. One morning,
my husband left for work about 5:30 in the morning. I was still in bed
trying to sleep. There was no one else home except for me and the baby.
All of a sudden I heard a pounding on the wall, like someone was taking
their fist and pounding on it. There were three knocks on the wall. I
rolled over and didn&#8217;t get up. Almost instantly, the knocks were
repeated, three one right after the other. I got up and went into the
other bedroom and the baby was sleeping, with a blanket over his face.
I looked at him and pulled the cover down off of his face. His feet
were not near the wall and I believe he was too young, only a few
months old, to make loud noises like that. I went back to bed and
didn&#8217;t hear the pounding on the wall again. I have no explanation for
what happened but I often wonder if it was my father coming to visit
his grandson. I don't know if ghosts can make noises like that but that
is what happened.<br>
Thanks for reading. If you have any questions or comments I can be reached at <br>

Neon Green Glow<br>
<br>
By: scojowoods@comcast.net<br>
<br>
I was shocked to read the story of a neon green glow on a cross.....In
1993 I went to a cemetary here in Walpole, Mass, to visit my friend
Billy Seymour who passed away in a violent car accident. It was late at
night, and I was walking back towards my car when I saw a neon "thing"
in the woods next to the cemetary. For every step forward I took, it
took two. When I stopped it stopped. I just ran for my life, locked
myself in my car and closed my eyes and blocked my ears. My ex-husband
was standing next to the grave seeing all this but he spoke in slow
motion "I cant move".......I swear to god that had to have been the
scariest night of my life. Ive given birth twice and I would do it a
zillion times more before I would ever go back to that
graveyard......Joanne Woods<br>

Takes Place in England<br>
<br>
By: largelyhappy@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
This experience took place in England, though I now live in New Zealand.<br>
Before I married, my husband-to-be moved into a small apartment near
mine and asked me to come over one evening to help him unpack.&nbsp; In
those days, over 50 years ago, young people didn't automatically sleep
with one another, so the invitation was innocent :-)<br>
He was at work for the first hour I was there (I had a key) but I began
to unpack some things and put them in drawers and cupboards; in between
I went from that room (which was both livingroom and bedroom) across a
hall into the kitchen to make sure potatoes and other vegetables were
cooking on the gas stove in the kitchen.<br>
Nothing happened until my fiance arrived home, then the first little
strangeness was that as I was hanging his coat in the wardrobe, the
shoes on the floor shifted an inch or so.&nbsp; As you do, I thought I
was mistaken, the shoes could not have moved, I said nothing.<br>
We chatted a while and I went back into the kitchen only to find all
four rings of the gas cooker were off. There was no one else in this
place and to turn the gas off you had to physically turn a
butterfly-key tap.&nbsp; I turned them on again, lit the gas and went
back to tell Tim.&nbsp; Neither of us could understand this but then I
told him about the shoes moving.&nbsp; He said the day before, he had
been sure a chair moved too.<br>
Tim was a Catholic and very superstitious and this began to freak him out. <br>
I've never been in the slightest bit scared of ghosts, although I was brought up in a family who denied they existed.<br>
Once more that cooker was turned off but by this time the meal was
cooked so I served it up and took the plates into the main room.&nbsp;
Tim said the place had begun to 'feel funny' though I didn't detect
anything but he asked if I would stay over that night and I agreed.<br>
About 10pm we settled down, me in the bed and Tim in a chair next to
me, with his feet up on another and packed with quilts. We kept the
light on. In those innocent days, personal honour was more important
than fleeting sensation so I had nothing to fear as Tim was an
honourable man.<br>
About 2am I woke with this very strange feeling in my throat, not as if
someone was strangling me, more as if my throat was closing from the
inside.<br>
Tim was dozing so I said nothing until this feeling became quite
severe, then I reached out and woke him, telling him in a croaky voice
what was happening.&nbsp; He started reciting prayers, with no
noticable difference in my situation; I was saying, 'Pick on someone
your own size, get off me you lout!' and stuff like that, to whatever
entity had decided to play a trick on me.<br>
The feeling subsided slightly and Tim decided to go make a cup of tea
(I had to go with him as he was too scared to go to the kitchen alone -
this is a big guy of 6ft 4ins who played rugby too!)<br>
We had our tea (the English cure-all) and my neck was feeling much
better; I got back into bed (it was till only 3am) and Tim settled down
as well. I was just dropping off to sleep when Tim nudged me and said,
'There's a man sitting in that chair' - pointing to a big old easy
chair across the room. I couldn't see&nbsp; thing but as Tim began to
describe him (elderly, bald)&nbsp; I leapt out of bed, went to sit in
the chair and said to my fiance "Is he still there now?"<br>
I tell you, this nearly drove poor Tim right out of his tree, he began
his prayers again and told me not to mess with the spirits but he had
to admit that I wasn't sitting on any old man's knee and I didn't have
a ghost on mine.<br>
I don't think Tim slept at all after that but I did and when I woke
about 6.30 there was a angry red weal around my neck, like a rope burn
(though it hadn't felt like hanging or strangling at all).&nbsp; That
mark stayed for 3 days and caused a few tricky questions.<br>
The following day Tim moved out of the apartment, losing his deposit - and went to another, more peaceful place.<br>
Our second son Joe (an Aquarian son of an Aquarian mother) has, from
birth, been able to see spirits and when he could articulate, described
them to me (though I could never see anything).&nbsp; Many of them were
in old fashioned dress but many were not. He has also seen me and a
neighbours dog (neither of us were dead at the time, or anywhere near
him) so I can't explain that bit.<br>
My mother did not believe in ghosts but when my father died very
suddenly at the age of 54, one of the things he left behind was the key
to working the complicated central heating system in their house. Mum
told me a long time afterwards that every night, that system was
re-programmed until she was well enough to find the instructions and
work it out for herself. Only Dad could have done that.<br>

My Mom's House and Her more Recent Happenings<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; Anonymous<br>
<br>
Hi its me again.I was very dilighted to finally see my story on your
sight.I am still living at my moms house and strange noises and
footsteps are still going on.I thought I would update you on a few
things that have happened recently.My uncle was staying with us for a
while.He has since moved out because my mom and I have become forster
parents to my cousin Misty and her son.My uncle had the creepy room
which is now Misty and her sons room.I told her that the house is
haunted and we believe centerd in her room.She has yet to have an
encounter but im sure her day is coming.Although she has not seen or
herd anything as of yet she to has a strange feeling when it comes to
that closet but she is the oppasit of me when it comes to the door.She
can,t sleep with it shut!!Anyways before she moved in my uncle lived
here.Now we have never told him the things that have happened cause he
can be very dramatic.When he was married to his first wife my aunt
Shirly they had an encounter at a farmhouse they were renting in
Washington in the late 1970s that he believes to this day was the devil
or something out of hell.He is some what of a story teller but my aunt
who dose not like to talk about it has comfirmed that this did
happen.Anyways back to my story.I moved back here in mid July of 05 and
my uncle was here intill beginning of Sept.05.So one night I was here
alone with my two daughters and we were in the basement.My mom had went
out with a friend of hers to go dancing and my uncle works intill 11 at
night and useually gets home around 11:30 inless he stops off to have a
few beers after work.So im sitting downstairs and we have hardwood
floors so you hear if someone is on the main floor.It was about 11:40
or so and I herd movement upstairs.Thinking it was my mom home early I
went up to see how her night went but when I got upstairs her car was
not home yet so I assumed it was my uncle because when I got on the
main floor I could hear someone going up the stairs to the third floor
and moving around in my uncles room.So I decide to play a game on the
computer since my girls were down for the night.I kept hearing banging
up there and more then once wonderd what the hell he was doing up
there.So as im sitting hear on the computer about an hour or so latter
my uncle comes walking threw the front door.Now I did go downstairs a
few times to check on my girls so I figured he must have came down and
left when I was down there but I was,nt down there long and the noises
contiued up intill he walk in the door.I was very suprized and a little
freeked out when he said he had worked overtime and had just got
home.There had been nobody in the house but me and my girls!Now to hear
footsteps upstairs is not unuseual but this thing was stomping and what
sounded like jumping around up there.I thought well that&#8217;s a new one
but im not frightend by this ghost.I don,t believe he means us any
harm.I think he was tring to tell me that he was still here.Although I
do have to admit there are times it dose creep me out,espacially when I
feel like hes watchen me when im on the computer late at night.I have
never seen him since that one time in 2001.Now this has happened on
many accations since then.Just a few nights ago I was on the computer
and Misty was gone for the night it happened again.You see since she
has moved in I have,nt herd anything,but while my uncle was here I herd
things upstairs almost on a nightly basis before he would get home.The
watching thing is happening right now as I write this.My daughter Allie
has told me that the same man she saw when she was 3 was standing in
her doorway a few nights ago.At first she was very scard but then she
rememberd me telling her to tell him to go away and he would.So she
told him go away and leave me alone and she said he stood there for a
few more seconds before turning and going into the livingroom area.She
got up to see where he went and when she steped into her doorway he was
standing in the kitchen area where the bar once was.This scared the
crap out of her cause she really did,nt espect him to still be
there.She said I want you to go away and he looked at her then just
disappeared right before her eyes.She had a hard time sleeping alone in
her room so she slept with me for a few nights but she in her room
again and has not seen him since but she says at times she feels like
she is being watched but she to scard to look and see what it is that&#8217;s
watching her.She pulls her comforter over her head and tells it to
leave and after a few minites it dose.This man has never tried to touch
her or anything like that but I have to admit it dose scare me when
this thing comes to my daughters room and watches her.He has never
harmed anyone but I don,t like its fasanation with my child and I have
said many times outloud for it to stay away from my child and it has,nt
happened for a few days now.My doughter told me its happened like 4
times in the last month.Weve been here 7months now and this just
started about a month ago.Im not sure why he shows himself to her but I
wish he would stop doing this because even though she knows he wont
hurt her its still a very scary thing for her.With me besides the
footsteps on the main floor which is something weve never herd before
(only upstairs) I have seen shadows out of the corner of my eye in the
basement when I turn and look theres no one there but the feeling of
being watched was there.I don,t mind him being around but I wish he
would go back upstairs on the top floor where hes always been and stay
out of my basement.I just wanted to let you know that this house is
still very much haunted.I don,t feel him watching me now but I hear him
moving around upstairs now.So I hope you will add this to your sight.<br>
