<b>The Closet Man/Black Magic Lesson</b>
<p><b>By: yarddog@fgi.net</b>
<p><b>I have a story to tell that scared me so bad, it took me 25 years
to try and write it down.&nbsp; You may believe as I tried to convince
myself, that it was all a dream.&nbsp; You may not believe it at all.&nbsp;
I don't want to believe it, but it happened and it wasn't a dream.</b>
<br><b>In high school, I ran around with a guy named Cliff, my best friend.&nbsp;
We grew up together and had each other to lean on when times were tough.
In our junior year, the school offered a class called, "Witchcraft and
Folklore", which we thought was the best class the school ever offered
and we both signed up immediately.&nbsp; The folklore part was interesting,
but we were both totally engrossed by the witchcraft aspect.&nbsp; We threw
ourselves into that part, reading book after book on occult, black magic,
anything like that.&nbsp; It was just interesting, that's all.&nbsp; But,
it didn't take too long to change.Cliff and one of his friend were talking
about spells one day and his friend mentioned that he was having trouble
winning the attention of this girl he liked.&nbsp; I don't know the particulars
here, but I think Cliff might have mentioned that he could cast a spell
to help the guy out.&nbsp; The guy, Jim by name, readily agreed and plans
were made for that night.Again, I don't remember a whole lot about this
part, who was there, who wasn't, but I don't remember being there, even
though it's possible I was.&nbsp; I know that there was an incantation
invoked and that it had the desired effect.&nbsp; Jim got his woman, but
we all got more than we bargained for.&nbsp; One thing here:&nbsp; This
was just for fun.&nbsp; Cliff and I just did this out of boredom, really.&nbsp;
We weren't trying to kill anyone or fly, or anything like that.&nbsp; It
was just something to do.&nbsp; I don't think we even thought&nbsp; about
it working....I know we didn't think about the consequences.</b>
<br><b>Here begins my story:</b>
<br><b>One night, (it might have been the same night the spell was cast)
I was laying in bed listening to music.&nbsp; It wasn't too late, but my
room was my haven away from my four sisters.&nbsp; I was drifting toward
sleep at the time, when I heard some one open the door to my closet.&nbsp;
I look over and I saw the door was open.&nbsp; It look like whoever it
was was standing inside the closet shining a flashlight out into the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Annoyed, and thinking it was one of my sister, I told them to get out of
the closet and leave my room.&nbsp; The light went out and to door became
closed.&nbsp; I didn't see it close.&nbsp; It just became closed.Confused,
I sat up and tried to make sense of what just happened.&nbsp; Before I
could form a conclusion, I noticed a misty outline forming just in front
of the closet door.&nbsp; It only took a few seconds to realize it was
the form of a huge man and as I looked on in horror, the image became very
clear.&nbsp; It was a robed man.&nbsp; He was transparent except for his
face.&nbsp; Everything was gray, but where his face was, it was solid black.&nbsp;
One of his arms was thrown over the top of his head.&nbsp; The other arm
was under his chin and his hands were bent in such a way that they form
a rectangle frame around his face.&nbsp; As I watch, the man started drifting
toward me.&nbsp; That's when I screamed.The room&nbsp; was freezing.&nbsp;
I picked up a chair and threw it at the man, but it went right through
and hit the closet door.&nbsp; I screamed, "GET OUT!!" and pushed myself
against the far wall.&nbsp; The man drifted back against the closet door
and slowly faded to nothing.&nbsp; It was then that my father walked in
and he wasn't very happy.&nbsp; I told him what I had seen and he explained
that the mind can really play some dirty tricks on you while your sleeping.&nbsp;
I tried to believe that, but I was finished sleeping for the night.</b>
<br><b>The next morning, Cliff called.&nbsp; He had just heard from Jim
that the spell he used worked!&nbsp; Cliff was pretty excited until I told
him what had happened to me the previous night.&nbsp; We agreed to talk
about it and Cliff drove into town to talk to me.On the way to my house,
he passed right by Jim's and when the car got even with Jim's house, the
car just died.&nbsp; And that'swhere Cliff left it.&nbsp; He walked (or
ran) the rest of the way to my house and we were both totally freaked out
by this time.After a few more weird things happened, each one bringing
on a higher level of fear, we consulted the minister of Cliff's church,
who in turn contacted a priest from the diocese in the state capitol 35
miles away.&nbsp; We met with him at Cliff's church.&nbsp; The priest was
an old, frail man, but he really did exude a power and we felt safe in
his presence, while all three of us related our stories to him.&nbsp; He
was very concerned, but he told us that he thought it might be a warning
to stay away from the dark element.&nbsp; He talked for quite a while and
then finished with a prayer.&nbsp; Upon departing, he gave my a crucifix
that he told me to hang on my closet door.&nbsp; I did and that's where
it stayed until we moved out of that house.I never saw the apparition again.&nbsp;
We never messed with black magic again.&nbsp; There are pieces of this
story missing and I have asked Cliff to relate them on this site to fill
in the missing areas.&nbsp; I hope he does.&nbsp; I know that it still
gives us both the creeps and we refer to it as "the demon".&nbsp; What
it was, I don't know and I have never heard of any one having anything
similar happen to them.&nbsp; I can't help but wonder about the significance
of the light, or the manner in which he positioned his arms, but maybe
I don't really want to know......</b>

<p><b>Haunted Highschool</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: jbell@chicago.bozell.com</b>
<p><b>variable name: Back when I was a teenager in highschool in the early
90's I went to a private school in Litchfield CT. I have been told that
the capmus was haunted, I pretty much found out for my self that it is
so very true. Or for that fact the whole town is.</b>
<br><b>Well any way, My encounter was in the schools art building, which
used to be the old dinning hall. One night I decided to get extra credit
by going into the main art room to do some of my paintings, mind you this
was at night during study hall time. since I was a senior I was allowed
to use my study hall time for this. I started to do my work at 7:00pm til
9:oopm. That is when my encounter happend.&nbsp; Now 9:oopm or I say exactly
9:05 pm I was starting to wrap things up, I also new I was the only one
there, because I was the only one given permission to be in there and all
the doors were lock including the one I came in, because I lock it.&nbsp;
What had happend at 9:05 was I heard foot step above me walking around
in a circle, like someone was slowly walking around something. Now I knew
there was a second floor, but I had never been up there. Not to many have,
being the fact that we were not allowd up there.&nbsp; The activity up
on the 2 level started to get a bit livelier I figured it maybe a teacher
or just someone clean up. so I went&nbsp; out side to the front to see
if any light were on or not, there were none. I was starting to get scared.</b>
<br><b>I quickly went back in side to clean up my stuff, I decided I was
done for the night. On my way out I was a bit eager to get out I heard
what seemed to be a model train go around on tracks on the 2 level. At
this time I am freaking out and more or less scared.&nbsp; The next day
I told a few of my friends, and it first they did not believe me, so at
the same time at night the next day I took them. They heard the exact same
thing I heard at the exact same time 9:05pm.we all ran out of there as
fast a we could catching people's attention.Later we had found out by the
school's historian, that the old headmaster of the school love trains and
that he had built a scale railrode track from scratch, and when he died
the school named the building after him and&nbsp; left the track right
were he had left them and then locked the door so the tracks would not
be tampered with. The school&nbsp; historian allowed us to see them, and
the fact that the door was locked and the lock had lots of dust on it showed
me that&nbsp; there has been nobody through that door for years.&nbsp;
We saw the track but no train. I had told the teacher who was also the
historian that I heard a train and some one walking around, and so did
my other friends. He said you are not the first.</b>

<p><b>My Dad's Phillipines Story</b>
<p><b>By: XxCuTiEpNaY87xX@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>well i have had no experiences,but my dad has.</b>
<p><b>it happened in the phillipines, just as he told me.</b>
<br><b>he was not even born yet but his grandfather was still living and
his great</b>
<br><b>granpa had just died. one time a maid told him this story when he
was quite</b>
<br><b>young. one time the maid was cleaning on the top floor hallways,usting
and</b>
<br><b>stuff. then she went inside my dad's greatgrandpa's room, which
now belongs</b>
<br><b>to my dad's uncle. their house was full of antiques and nothing
but antiques.</b>
<br><b>in the room stood my dad's great gramps rocking chair. according
to the maid</b>
<br><b>there was an old man sitting in it. she thought it was my dad's
grandpa {not</b>
<br><b>great grandpa!} so she said "hello grandpaa juan" {thats his name}
and left</b>
<br><b>the room. no one else was in the house. then in the drive way she
saw grandpa</b>
<br><b>juan pulling up the drive way. in confusion she thought....if grandpa
juan is</b>
<br><b>there.....who is sitting down upstairs?</b>
<p><b>case 2-</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; my dad was still a college student at the time. he was studying
the human</b>
<br><b>skull and unfortunatley needed one. so his uncle bought one from
the cemetery</b>
<br><b>they are cleaning up just miles away to put a buildind in its place.
so he</b>
<br><b>bought one and gave it to my dad. my dad was checking out the skull
and left</b>
<br><b>the room. a maid asked him if he had a guest. my dad had said no,
and then</b>
<br><b>the maid asked why there was a lady in a gown in his room. my dad
had thought</b>
<br><b>it was a joke because that maid happened to be superstitious. then
when he</b>
<br><b>went to get a snack,he bought the skull with him. there,he saw something.</b>
<br><b>while he eating, there was a tlevision on the counter which he didn't
want to</b>
<br><b>turn on becuz it might interfere with his studies. he looked up
and saw</b>
<br><b>something on the screen of the t.v. he saw a lady sitting on the
couch. he</b>
<br><b>turned around and no one was there. he soon hid the skull and until</b>
<br><b>now...they still hear footsteps and moans...from my dad's room.</b>
<p><b>case3-</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;my great uncle tony bought a house in the mountains called
baguio.</b>
<br><b>{bagiyo}the house was very lonely...stood on a dirty runway next
to the</b>
<br><b>horrorful teacher's camp {where the japenese hid the bodies of the
dead or</b>
<br><b>killed japenese soldiers.its the place which was rated for the most
ghost</b>
<br><b>appearances.} in the house, there existed a very violent spirit.
my granma</b>
<br><b>was away on a trip so my dad went to sleep at my uncle tony's house
with his</b>
<br><b>brother rey.</b>
<br><b>they slept on the couch.</b>
<br><b>during the night, his couch shook violently. he woke up and thought
it was an</b>
<br><b>earthquake, but saw that rey's couch wasn't shaking. so he layed
down. then</b>
<br><b>he heard the faucet go on. and a sound that sounded like a 100 year
old's</b>
<br><b>footsteps chee chee chee ..... he tried waking rey up but he was
dead asleep.</b>
<br><b>so he moved to his nephew,j.p.'s room. he slept and&nbsp; was awaken
by heavy</b>
<br><b>wieght on his stomach...he ignored...thinking it was j.p., but had
seen that</b>
<br><b>j.p. was turningg the other way... then he looked at his shirt .
his stomach</b>
<br><b>was going down and his shirt was wrinkling. thuis he knew that something
was</b>
<br><b>sitting on his stomach. then he cursed at the ghost...which frequently
got up</b>
<br><b>because his stomach soon lifted up and his shirt became unwrinkled.</b>
<p><b>*ultra case-</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; my dad never seen his grandma becuz she died when he
was still in his</b>
<br><b>mom's stomach.</b>
<br><b>he went into my cousin's kitchen here in baldwin park, and at the
corner of</b>
<br><b>his eyes,he saw something standing there. he looked but she wasn't
there. {it</b>
<br><b>was a she because&nbsp; she was wearing a white gown} then he went
to talk to my</b>
<br><b>cousin and came out and something passed him by. cold air. and he
saw her</b>
<br><b>shape in the mirror in the kitchen. he went to my grandma and asked
her about</b>
<br><b>it. my grandma reacted :oh yea! today's mom's anniversary!: it figured.</b>
<p><b>lc.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;when my dad and 3 of his friends were walking by a restaurant
in</b>
<br><b>phillipines, they remebered lady chayet died. later that night one
of my</b>
<br><b>uncles&nbsp; got drunk and went to the restaurant,which my dad,
and the 2 still</b>
<br><b>normal uncles followed...or spied on.</b>
<br><b>he went up to a lady in the restaurant {he forgat chayet was dead
} he</b>
<br><b>noticed that this lady was taller than he remebered. he saw that
she was</b>
<br><b>floating.&nbsp; then the head tuned around and it was lady chayet....he
screamed</b>
<br><b>and fainted and my dad and his cousins had to carry him out.</b>
<p><b>*~*</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;the reason ghost always come to my dad is because he has no
featr of them.</b>
<br><b>and believe me, i know. we were at his house in the phillipines,
and saw an</b>
<br><b>antique candle. as soon as i said "there is no such things as ghost

<br><b>the candle lit up. all my dad said was "spirits,if&nbsp; talk to
me while my</b>
<br><b>daughter isn't here"</b>
<br><b>then the candle flew by fast as if the someone threw it, and it
ended up not</b>
<br><b>being lit at all!!!! maybe it got mad because of what i said. later
that</b>
<br><b>night i heard my dad. he was talking to someone! he looked retartded!!!
then</b>
<br><b>i over heard him say "if it weren't for that car you could have
still been</b>

and said "did</b>
<br><b>cousin luis really die because of a car accident?? a black car on
this</b>
<br><b>certain street?" my uncle responded yes.....and asked how he knew
becuase his</b>

<p><b>Sampson</b>
<p><b>By: janicer@Princeton.EDU</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>In December of 1998 my husband and I lost a very dear friend.&nbsp;
Our sweet</b>
<br><b>kitty boy Sampson was hit by a car about five days before Christmas.</b>
<br><b>Needless to say we were devastated as we adored him and he us.&nbsp;
He was</b>
<br><b>ornery and stubborn but deep down we knew he loved us as much as
we</b>
<br><b>loved him.&nbsp; One of the things that Sampson would do to indicate
that he</b>
<br><b>wanted to go out or come in was to stand in the window and claw
the</b>
<br><b>screen demanding our attention.&nbsp; It was quite annoying as well
as</b>
<br><b>destructive to the screen.&nbsp; When Sampson was gone for a couple
of days</b>
<br><b>my husband removed the screen from the window in order the repair
the</b>
<br><b>damage he had caused by clawing at it.&nbsp; That evening I was
sitting in</b>
<br><b>the living room wrapping presents and lo and behold I hear Sampson</b>
<br><b>clawing at the outside of the window demanding to be let in.&nbsp;
Without</b>
<br><b>giving it a second thought I jumped up from the floor and took about</b>
<br><b>five steps to the door before I realized that not only was Sampson
gone</b>
<br><b>but the screen was no longer in the window.&nbsp; However, that
was</b>
<br><b>definitely what I had heard, Sampson clawing to get in.&nbsp; Later
that</b>
<br><b>evening I said to my husband in a very off-hand way and without
using</b>
<br><b>Sampson's name that, "He's been back."&nbsp; You can't imagine my
reaction</b>
<br><b>when without even missing a beat my husband replied, "I know, I've
heard</b>
<br><b>him too."&nbsp; He heard Sampson clawing at the screen as well!&nbsp;
It only</b>
<br><b>happened once or twice after that but I would always go to the door
and</b>
<br><b>open for Sampson.&nbsp; Strange, maybe but I wanted to make sure
that he knew</b>
<br><b>that it was still his home and he was still loved very much.</b>
<p><b>Thank you for listening...</b>

<p><b>Haunted History</b>
<p><b>By: Chevra4unme@aol.com</b>
<p><b>Hi, I have been seeing spirits since 1978. At first I thought I was
dreaming,</b>
<br><b>but now I know I am not dreaming. All the people I have spoke to
about this</b>
<br><b>either think I'm crazy or they think it is my subconcious mind acting.</b>
<br><b>It all started back in 1978, in my college dorm room. I was sleeping
and was</b>
<br><b>awoken by a cold breeze. I noticed at the side of my bed there was
a figure</b>
<br><b>of a young man with long blonde hair. He was dressed all in white
but I only</b>
<br><b>saw from his shoulders to his waist. His dress was like a thin see
through</b>
<br><b>drape. I was startled and turned on the light. Of course he was
gone. At the</b>
<br><b>foot of my bed was my light. It was just as tall as the young man,
so I</b>
<br><b>thought it was just a dream.</b>
<br><b>When it happened again about a week later, I called out to my roommate
and</b>
<br><b>said to her I think we have a ghost. All she said was that I was
dreaming and</b>
<br><b>to get up and get some water.</b>
<br><b>I went to one of my professors and told him about this. He asked
me if it was</b>
<br><b>menacing. I said no. It wasn't at this time. He told me if it happened
again</b>
<br><b>to go to a parapsychologist. I didn't know where to go or whom to
see so I</b>
<br><b>didn't do anything.</b>
<br><b>It happened again in my parents home. I went to bed and was just
about to</b>
<br><b>fall asleep when this little child came out of the headboard of
my bed. It</b>
<br><b>just looked at me and then vanished, a minute later a woman came
through the</b>
<br><b>headboard, she looked like she was beaten up and very worried. She
vanished</b>
<br><b>through the headboard.</b>
<br><b>Another time, there was a menacing figure that came through the
upstairs</b>
<br><b>balconey door. He was very scary, with dark black hair which looked
like it</b>
<br><b>was never brushed, dressed in a total black flowing gown, he also
had long</b>
<br><b>hands with long nails and vampire like teeth. He flew or glided
quickly</b>
<br><b>towards me with his nails clenched and ready to strike. All I was
able to do</b>
<br><b>was gasp and cover my head up to my eyes. He went back through the
door.</b>
<br><b>My friend and I heard that there was going to be a parapsychologist
coming to</b>
<br><b>the YMCA, at only a $10.00 charge. So we went to see this&nbsp;
woman.</b>
<br><b>During her lecture, she asked the audience if anyone had ever seen
a ghost or</b>
<br><b>spirit. I raised my hand after a few other people raised theirs.
She looked</b>
<br><b>straight at me and said I was wondering when you were going to raise
you had.</b>
<br><b>She mentioned to me that if I ever saw those spirits again to call
her or get</b>
<br><b>the book "Ceremonial</b>
<br><b>Magic" by, Daniel Cohen. I tried to phone her but was unable to
locate her. I</b>
<br><b>also tried to get the book but no one was able to get it for me.</b>
<br><b>I moved to California in 1981 and lived with my cousin for about
3 months.</b>
<br><b>During those 3 months I received some spirits and a bright light
only in the</b>
<br><b>closet.</b>
<br><b>The first spirits were a male and female, dressed in long black
gowns. I</b>
<br><b>didn't see the face of the male but the woman was very beautiful
with long</b>
<br><b>dark hair. I looked at them both and said hi, they looked at me
in fear and</b>
<br><b>hurried back into the closet. I never saw them again. The next one
was a</b>
<br><b>black man.&nbsp; He had the laugh of the old Coke commercial. A
deep hardy laugh</b>
<br><b>kind of hoarse. He was throwing plastic hangers at me. I sat up
in bed and</b>
<br><b>said don't throw hangers at me give them to me now. He gave them
to me but I</b>
<br><b>could not feel them. He began to laugh again and disappeared. The
next day my</b>
<br><b>sister told me that we were going home because my mother was very
ill.</b>
<br><b>Time passed and I still had spirits visit but not as frequently.</b>
<br><b>I moved to California again to be with my sister. I didn't get any
spirits in</b>
<br><b>her home but my brother-in law said I was walking in my sleep alot.</b>
<br><b>I moved to my apartment and the spirits visited again. I remember
one was a</b>
<br><b>man with short blonde hair. He had deep blue eyes and was at the
side of my</b>
<br><b>bed. We had a conversation, but I only can remember this. I told
him that if</b>
<br><b>he wanted the gold colored blanket he could take it. As I lifted
it to place</b>
<br><b>it at the foot of my bed it vanished.</b>
<br><b>I moved into my new husbands house and saw this most beautiful spirit.
She</b>
<br><b>was so lovely and very calming. She was just like an angel floating
in the</b>
<br><b>air. She was dressed in a thin flowing white gown with lace and
a vail over</b>
<br><b>her head. She was breathtaking. I woke my husband up and showed
him her but</b>
<br><b>he couldn't see her. All the the spirits that came to see me my
husband can't</b>
<br><b>see. He must think I am a crazy person. I also see cartoons on the
walls,</b>
<br><b>puzzles on the ceiling and walls, numbers and words that move so
fast it is</b>
<br><b>hard to read them. I asked whatever was doing this to please slow
down so I</b>
<br><b>could read it&nbsp; but it never did slow down. I also see things
in my closest</b>
<br><b>and a light in my closet. Sometimes I see fingers opening the door
and eyes</b>
<br><b>peeking out from the small opening.</b>
<br><b>Where ever I go I see these spirits, but only at night.&nbsp; Sometimes
I feel a</b>
<br><b>presence of someone in the daytime. I look in that direction but
nothing is</b>
<br><b>there. Sometimes I see a shadow pass by in the hallway but I never
get a good</b>
<br><b>look at it because it is so quick.</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;Nursing Home Locked Facility</b>
<p><b>By: Cmskobe@cs.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One such experience occured at an alzhiemers facility where I</b>
<br><b>worked the evening shift. We started off the shift around 3pm with
5</b>
<br><b>c.n.a.'s, and then at 10pm, when everyone was tucked into bed, we
dropped</b>
<br><b>down to one cna and myself, the charge nurse. Being an alzhiemers
facility,</b>
<br><b>every door was locked, except those common areas where our patients
could</b>
<br><b>roam safely. The building was an older building that was obviously
a large</b>
<br><b>house that was converted to accomidate @ 30 patients. It was quaint
and</b>
<br><b>homey. Table lamps, large mirrors, sofas, everything one would furnish
their</b>
<br><b>home with. To get to the back bedrooms was sort of a small maze
of hallways.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One evening, after 10pm, the last cna was finishing up the</b>
<br><b>laundry, down the hall. I was at the tiny nurses station, finishing
up my</b>
<br><b>last charting. When I turned the chair, I saw a womans shoe I recognized.</b>
<br><b>(Never occured to me to wonder why I did'nt trip over it on my way
in the</b>
<br><b>nurses station) So, I proceeded to return it to it's owner, in the
back</b>
<br><b>bedroom. On my way through the little, dimly lit maze of hallways,
the hair</b>
<br><b>on my neck stood straight up. I could not bring my self to look
into the</b>
<br><b>mirrors as I made way back to her room. I walked increasingly faster
and</b>
<br><b>faster, till I reached her room, then I threw the shoe in some general</b>
<br><b>direction of the closet, all my hair standing up and terror in my
heart. I</b>
<br><b>could not see who was right on my tail, but I felt like I was being
chased,</b>
<br><b>so I ran! When I got back to the nurses station, there was the last
cna,</b>
<br><b>running down her hall towards the nurses station, asking me if I
felt scared.</b>
<br><b>I said yes, while we hugged each other and cried in the nurses station,
I</b>
<br><b>called for back up, my brother-in-law, who lived down the street.
After I</b>
<br><b>laid the phone on it's cradle, we heard the loudest "click" I ever
did hear,</b>
<br><b>and then the deadbolt locked kitchen door, loudly creaked it's way
open,</b>
<br><b>while we stood there, hugging each other and crying, watching that
door</b>
<br><b>slowly open to it's full potential. I never really shared an experience
like</b>
<br><b>this with anyone, so that made it more frightening still, because
now it</b>
<br><b>could'nt be brushed off to my active imagination. But, after some
time has</b>
<br><b>passed, it still isn't the scariest thing ever to happen to me.
I feel as</b>
<br><b>though I am a magnet for this sort of stuff, which makes me look
and feel</b>
<br><b>like a kook. But, I can't deny what has been tossed my way.</b>

<br><b>House of Haunts</b>
<p><b>By: larryg961@earthlink.net</b>
<p><b>Back in 1971, my mother and father purchased a house in La Puente,
California.&nbsp; It was a single story, 3 bedroom home. We we told by
neighbors that a very violent death occurred in the front bedroom right
before we moved in.&nbsp; We didn't think much of&nbsp; it until strange
things started to happen.&nbsp; On several occasions I was violently shaken
awake to find no one in the room and&nbsp; heard my name being whispered
when no one else was around.&nbsp; Things like ashtrays were thrown across
the room.&nbsp; Strange scratching sounds came from within the walls.&nbsp;
Several times the door to the front bedroom would not open.&nbsp; My mother
was gardening in the backyard one day and heard knocking, first at kitchen
window then the bathroom window, from the inside.&nbsp; Thinking it was
my dad home from work early, she went inside to find the doors locked and
no one there.&nbsp; My father saw a ghostly figure of a woman with a flame
in her cupped hands walk down the hallway and vanish.&nbsp; He started
going to this lady who told him to burn incense throughout the house to
cleanse it, but the strange things kept happening.&nbsp; Finally in 1979,
my&nbsp; parents sold the house.&nbsp; On the day we moved out I was left
in the house alone to wait for the movers and I actually heard</b>
<br><b>a faint weeping&nbsp; coming from the back of the house.&nbsp; I
ran out the front door and never stepped inside it again. The house is
still there.&nbsp; Sometimes when I'm in the neighborhood I drive by,&nbsp;
wondering if the owners now have experienced anything strange.&nbsp; I
don't have the nerve to go up and ask.</b>

<p><b>Daddy's Goodbye</b>
<p><b>By: Lills4@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>On April 11, I spent the day with my father in the hospice. We knew
he was</b>
<br><b>getting worse, but didn't know when he was going to die. My husband,
our</b>
<br><b>infant son, and myself, decided to accompany mom home to get some
rest.</b>
<p><b>Sitting in mom's room at 12:45 a.m. in the early hours of April 12,
thinking</b>
<br><b>about the day, about dad, I was suddenly blinded with bright, pulsating</b>
<br><b>light. I had never seen anything like it before. It was extremely
bright but</b>
<br><b>did not hurt my eyes. I thought I was going blind. I got up, groped
along the</b>
<br><b>wall to get to the door to go tell my husband to wake up and take
me to ER.</b>
<br><b>By the time I got to the door, the lights shimmered away.</b>
<p><b>I have never been able to find out what this was. I am a skeptic.
I had a CT</b>
<br><b>scan done. Normal. Had my eyes checked. Normal. A specialist tells
me that it</b>
<br><b>might have been an occipital misfire in the brain.</b>
<p><b>But I know better.</b>
<p><b>Next visit to mom's house, she showed me dad's death certificate.
Time of</b>
<br><b>death on dad's death certificate:&nbsp; 12:45 a.m. April 12, 1992.</b>

<p><b>Double Haunting</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: epg69@hotmail.com</b>
<p><b>Hey my name is Ernest. I am 15 and live in Denver, Colorado. My house
is</b>
<br><b>located in an old part of town first inhabited by the Irish, then
the</b>
<br><b>Italians, now the Mexicans. My house is about 60 years old. There
has only</b>
<br><b>been one family to ever live in this house (besides mine), the DiBonas.
They</b>
<br><b>were an italian family consisting of Fred DiBona, his wife and two</b>
<br><b>daughters. They never had any pets, and nobody has died in this
house. I am</b>
<br><b>pretty sure all the DiBonas are still alive. I think there are two
ghosts</b>
<br><b>living in my house.</b>
<br><b>First, in the basement, I think there is a spirit of a phantom dog.
Our</b>
<br><b>basement is set up with the two main rooms forming an "L" shape.
In one of</b>
<br><b>the rooms there is a waterbed. Once I was folding up laundry and
saw two red</b>
<br><b>light reflections "hovering" about a foot and a half on top of the
bed. I</b>
<br><b>thought it was nothing at the time, as i could not think of any
rational</b>
<br><b>explanations of the, and i had never sensed anything paranormal
in my house.</b>
<br><b>Well months later i was playing with my dog on the stairs to the
basement,</b>
<br><b>and I shined a flashlight into it's eyes. I then recognized the
two</b>
<br><b>mysterious red light reflections. Have you ever shined a light into
a dog's</b>
<br><b>eyes? If not, the effect is similar to the "red-eye" effect in photography.</b>
<br><b>I realized that i had seen the EXACT same reflection in my dog's
eyes that i</b>
<br><b>had seen in the mysterious reflections, except that the mysterious</b>
<br><b>reflections were RED, while the ones in my dog's eyes were a deep
blue. And</b>
<br><b>im sure it wasn't my dog because he was outside at the time. Awhile
later</b>
<br><b>that month I was folding up more laundry and i felt as if i was
being</b>
<br><b>watched. I was home alone, so i called my dog to the basement. He
is just a</b>
<br><b>little bichon frise dog, so i heard his little nails click down
the linoleum</b>
<br><b>on the stairs. He came running up to me, and suddenly tuned towards
the room</b>
<br><b>with the waterbed. He looked as if he were anticipating something
coming,</b>
<br><b>and then he started growling. He then began wrestling with some
invisible</b>
<br><b>phantom dog and it looked as if he were losing. He got pulled up
into the</b>
<br><b>air by the scruff of his neck and slammed down onto his back. He
appeared</b>
<br><b>pinned and just laid there immobilized staring into the eyes of
some phantom</b>
<br><b>opponent. I was swinging at the air around my dog, connecting with
nothing</b>
<br><b>so I grabbed the little mutt and ran upstairs. Another time i was
doing</b>
<br><b>laundry (If you guessed this was a regular chore of mine, you are
right) and</b>
<br><b>i heard clicking noised in the room with the waterbed. I realized
they were</b>
<br><b>the sound of a dog's nails clicking against tile. Then i heard a
soft,</b>
<br><b>distant howling and whimpering, quite different of my dog's and
besides he</b>
<br><b>was at the grooming salon. I got freaked and ran upstairs. Now everytime
i</b>
<br><b>enter my basement i exclaim "Any mischievous spirits are unwelcome
in this</b>
<br><b>household. Be banished in the name of the LORD!" I never have had
an</b>
<br><b>encounter with the dog since.</b>
<br><b>I also believe there is a helpful spirit in my house. Sometimes
i just come</b>
<br><b>home and just kick off my shoes and lie down on the couch. Most
of the time</b>
<br><b>i just leave my shoes under the table in the living room. But in
the morning</b>
<br><b>when i am in a rush and looking for my shoes, and i suddenly realize
that</b>
<br><b>they are at the door of my room, with the laces untied (which i
NEVER do).My</b>
<br><b>parents blatantly deny having anything to do with this, and i know
they</b>
<br><b>expect me to be responsible for all my stuff, and would never do
this kind</b>
<br><b>of thing. Also sometimes when i come home my radio is on even though
I</b>
<br><b>turned it off before i left. Sometimes It is turned off in the middle
of the</b>
<br><b>night (I like to fall asleep and awaken to music), even though i
leave it on</b>
<br><b>at night. I also constantly feel like i am being watched in the
hallway from</b>
<br><b>the living room in the middle of the night when i go to the bathroom.
Once i</b>
<br><b>looked into the living room to see if i could see anything watching
me, and</b>
<br><b>there was a sudden blast of white light on the wall in an irregular
pattern,</b>
<br><b>not a circle or sphere like flashlight light, and not as bright
as lightning</b>
<br><b>or a camera's flash. A lot of times things are physically out of
place in my</b>
<br><b>house, and move there instantly. Once i bought a red false jeweled
ring for</b>
<br><b>a haloween costume, and the jewel part broke off. I spent all night
looking</b>
<br><b>for it, and it turned up under my parent's bed, even though i had
not gone</b>
<br><b>into that room with the ring, and certainly not put the ring anywhere
near</b>
<br><b>the bottom of the bed. Im pretty sure this is the work of my Grandmother,
as</b>
<br><b>she has done some paranormal activity in my house before, but thats
another</b>
<br><b>story. Well i'll tell the story some other time. Email me if you
want to</b>
<br><b>know anything else or to comment on anything.</b>
