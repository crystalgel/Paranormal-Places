<br><b>was an antique, with drawers and a large mirror.Once my mom heard</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;a little girl laughing and singing,at night.She sat up in
beb and the</b>
<br><b>giggling and singing stopped, as soon as the bed creaked. I was
asleep</b>
<br><b>in my mom's bed,and my sister wasn't born yet. Then we moved we
were</b>
<br><b>renting and our rent time was up. We moved to a house that we had
just</b>
<br><b>built. My mom started to hear whisling,doors slaming with no wind,I
was</b>

<p><b>The Elmhurst Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: farcus2000@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>About twenty-five years ago, my wife and I purchased a townhouse
in Elmhurst, Illinois. We had not yet moved in but were painting and cleaning,
preparing for the move. The front of the house faces what is known as the
Illinois Prarie Path, which is a bike path that runs for miles here. There
are no houses across the street, only trees and bushes, which made the
property very desirable.</b>
<br><b>My wife had left to get us something to eat.</b>
<br><b>I was washing the front room window which is a large picture window
about six feet wide by four feet tall. There is also a storm window on
the outside. There is only about four inches between the inside window
and the storm window, which makes cleaning between them very difficult.</b>
<br><b>I had finished cleaning the inside and the tight space between both
windows and went outside to clean the outside pane last. After I finished
cleaning the window, I came inside and stood looking out the window at
the beautiful scenery outside. I was also inspecting the job I had done
and was admiring the sparkling clean window. It was then that I noticed
a piece of paper towel outside in the bushes below the window. I went outside
to retrieve it. It was the first floor window and the door to the outside
is right next to the window, so it only took me about fifteen seconds the
go outside, retrieve the scrap of towel and return inside.</b>
<br><b>As I came back in, I turned to look outside and continue to admire
my work.</b>
<br><b>My blood turned cold and an icy shiver went up my spine. For the
window that I had just cleaned was totally covered in hand prints! I stood
frozen for a long time, my throat was dry and I was terrified.</b>
<br><b>I finally got the nerve to investigate the hand prints and was further
astonished to notice that I could actually feel the hand prints, as if
done by a very clammy hand. What chilled me the most was that the prints
were between the two windows in that very tight four inch space, and the
ENTIRE window surface was covered with them!</b>
<br><b>After that we never had any more supernatural experiences, except
for a toilet flushing by itself once, many years later.</b>

<p><b>The Deer Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ilmffs@mcleodusa.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>It was very early in the morning and my husband was driving, along
with</b>
<br><b>myself and his friend , Mike.</b>
<br><b>We were returning from the stock car races and were on the Interstate.</b>
<br><b>I was curled up on my side of the car against the door and had just
gone</b>
<br><b>to sleep.&nbsp; My husband reached his arm out in front of me and
said, hold</b>
<br><b>on!!&nbsp; I immediately woke up and asked what he was talking about.&nbsp;
He had</b>
<br><b>this strange look on his face and about the same time, Mike said,
" did</b>
<br><b>you see that?"&nbsp; My husband said, "What?"</b>
<br><b>Mike said , "I didn't see anything."&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't get
an answer from</b>
<br><b>either of them about what they were talking about.&nbsp; After we
got back to</b>
<br><b>town, we went to a restaurant for breakfast.&nbsp; Then they started
talking</b>
<br><b>about what they both saw.&nbsp; They&nbsp; both saw a big deer running
along side</b>
<br><b>our car and then it cut in front of our car, which is when my husband</b>
<br><b>threw his arm out in front of me to keep me from hitting the windshield</b>
<br><b>when he hit the deer.&nbsp; Guess what?&nbsp; No impact. No damage.
My husband</b>
<br><b>just drove through the deer or deer ghost.&nbsp; Strange!! When
we go by that</b>
<br><b>area, we watch for it now, but have never seen it since.&nbsp; By
the</b>
<br><b>way, this happened in Illinois on Interstate 74.</b>

<p><b>The Crying Child</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: RagDollLady@cs.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had several experiences with ghosts.&nbsp; The most puzzling
one occurred</b>
<br><b>on the first evening my husband and I spent in our brand new house
in</b>
<br><b>Palmdale CA.&nbsp; Our children were very young then and had been
very excited by</b>
<br><b>the move.&nbsp; It was their bed time and both my husband and I
were exhausted so</b>
<br><b>he laid down in one room with the two oldest boys and I took my
daughter and</b>
<br><b>her younger brother into my room with me.&nbsp; It was summer time
and the sun had</b>
<br><b>just set by the time the little ones with me began to dose off.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must have dosed off soon after the kids because
it was completely dark</b>
<br><b>when I was awakened by a child crying really hard, the kind of crying
that</b>
<br><b>makesyou think the child is in serious pain.&nbsp; I could not see
the child in</b>
<br><b>the doorway but I reached across the bed and I could feel my son
and daughter</b>
<br><b>still lying on the bed asleep.&nbsp; Thinking the crying child was
one of the boys</b>
<br><b>and my husband was sleeping I called out to it,"Come here baby and
tell mommy</b>
<br><b>what's wrong".&nbsp; The child came into the room and was climbing
up onto the bed</b>
<br><b>when the moonlight caught its shinny blond curls.&nbsp; I could
feel its weight on</b>
<br><b>the bed as it climbed closer to me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that I made a startled sound when I saw
the child's hair, because</b>
<br><b>I only have one blond and his hair is straight.&nbsp; I reached
out to grab the</b>
<br><b>child and it was gone.&nbsp; I thought it was one of the neighbor's
children and</b>
<br><b>it was hurt and must have tried to hide under the bed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had not unpacked our lamps yet and I could
not seem to find a light</b>
<br><b>switch in the room.&nbsp; I started reaching under the bed but there
was nothing</b>
<br><b>there, so I began to scream for my husband.&nbsp; He ran in the
room and turned on</b>
<br><b>the light.&nbsp; The only children in the room were our two still
asleep in the</b>
<br><b>middle of the bed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were both shaken, although my husband had
not seen it, he had heard</b>
<br><b>the crying.&nbsp; He went out side and searched the yards and the
street.&nbsp; He even</b>
<br><b>went across the street where earlier in the day we had seen blond
children</b>
<br><b>playing, but they were all in bed asleep according to their very
curious</b>
<br><b>mother.&nbsp; Needless to say we did not sleep that night.&nbsp;
We never saw the child</b>
<br><b>again, but sometimes at night we heard its muffled cries outside
the bedroom</b>
<br><b>window.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Cologne</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bl00d_luver@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>hi. my story happened when i was about 10.&nbsp; two of my</b>
<br><b>friends stopped at my house for a couple drinks while</b>
<br><b>we were out hiking in my woods and i wanted to scare</b>
<br><b>them a lil bit because most of my friends thought i</b>
<br><b>was truly possesed because i did spells and i looked</b>
<br><b>all dead and stuff.... i dont know why but i had an</b>
<br><b>idea to care my friends that were with me so i pulled</b>
<br><b>out my old ouija (spell chek) board that i had made by</b>
<br><b>hand and we used a c.d of mine.i lit sum candles. they</b>
<br><b>sat down thinkin that it was all fake and made up. so</b>
<br><b>we started out and i thought one of my friends was</b>
<br><b>moving it so i just played along. after an hour or so</b>
<br><b>we stopped and we got all ready to go back outside.</b>
<br><b>when we were about to put the game away the c.d</b>
<br><b>started moving..... i thought it was just a figment of</b>
<br><b>my imagination but i grabbed my friends and we all sat</b>
<br><b>down again and we were probably scared straight at</b>
<br><b>this point. shawn got back up and ran out the door and</b>
<br><b>he of course went home. me and jessica stayed because</b>
<br><b>we have always been amazed by this kinda stuff. we put</b>
<br><b>our fingers back on the c.d and started asking the</b>
<br><b>spirit questions. it kept saying 24 over and over and</b>
<br><b>over. i got kinda freaked out because he started</b>
<br><b>asking if he can come over. jessica didnt know what</b>
<br><b>can happen if you do that so she said yes and</b>
<br><b>immediatly after that we heard somethin break in the</b>
<br><b>bathroom so i ran back there and the smell of cologne</b>
<br><b>ran through the whole house. it was so strong that i</b>
<br><b>just ran outside and started coughing. me and jessica</b>
<br><b>got away from the house and went to her house to tell</b>
<br><b>her mom what happened. her mom checked out the house</b>
<br><b>and said it was fine and smelled fine. we went into</b>
<br><b>the bathroom and the broken cologne bottle was laying</b>
<br><b>on the floor shattered into a million pieces. my heart</b>
<br><b>started pounding when i felt something touch my neck</b>
<br><b>and jessica and her mom were in the other room.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ever
since then so many weird things have</b>
<br><b>happened to me. when ever i go into a room in my house</b>
<br><b>i smell that cologne and the room would get cold and</b>
<br><b>things would fall over on their own and all sorts of</b>
<br><b>scary stuff has happened to me. like once when i was</b>
<br><b>having a sleep over,&nbsp; we were all sleeping and i was</b>
<br><b>awaken by a dog barking in the hallway. i looked</b>
<br><b>around to see if anyone else was up but they werent so</b>
<br><b>i went back to sleep and heard it again so i woke up</b>
<br><b>and my two dogs were growling and they were laying by</b>
<br><b>my side practicly squishing me. they were growling so</b>
<br><b>much and staring at the hallway that i decided to</b>
<br><b>check it out and my dogs would not let me up so i</b>
<br><b>yelled at them to go and they wouldnt move. i heard</b>
<br><b>the little bark again and my dogs got even closer to</b>
<br><b>me. i woke my friends up and they heard it too. my</b>
<br><b>dogs got up and layed down in front of my bedroom</b>
<br><b>door. we got so scared that we couldnt even scream</b>
<br><b>right. my dogs started barking and they are HUGE dogs</b>
<br><b>so my parents woke up and ran out into my bedroom</b>
<br><b>where we were sleeping. they put the dogs outside and</b>
<br><b>we all went back to sleep tehni heard the dog again</b>
<br><b>only it sounded like the dog was in my room this time.</b>
<br><b>i woke my friends up again and i could hear my dogs</b>
<br><b>barking like crazy outside my window, so i opened the</b>
<br><b>window and they jumped in and started growling again.</b>
<br><b>this time the little dog started scratching at my</b>
<br><b>closet door (the door was closed) and me and my</b>
<br><b>friends were so freaked out that we just opened the</b>
<br><b>closet door. when all my friends finally went to</b>
<br><b>sleep, i felt all sad because the land lord said that</b>
<br><b>there was a little puppy that was abandoned in this</b>
<br><b>house and he died. when my family first moved in here</b>
<br><b>there was a little tennis ball in the back of the</b>
<br><b>closet. when i opened the closet the little tennis</b>
<br><b>ball was gone. i was feeling happy/freaked out. i went</b>
<br><b>over to my dogs and hugged them both. i went into the</b>
<br><b>kitchen and i heard the barking again i got freaked</b>
<br><b>out again and my dogs ran back in the bedroom. i</b>
<br><b>wanted the dog to be quiet because my friends would</b>
<br><b>wanna go home and never come back again, so i got a</b>
<br><b>little bone and threw it out the window and said</b>
<br><b>"fetch" for some odd reason. and we never heard it</b>
<br><b>again. i wanted to move so bad after that but we</b>
<br><b>couldnt and i still live in the house. i dont have</b>
<br><b>many friends but hey, my friends are just like me.</b>
<br><b>things still happen to me but im used to them now and</b>
<br><b>when im alone in the house...... i pretend the spirits</b>
<br><b>are just another person living in the house. when</b>
<br><b>something breaks on its own, i say outloud "be</b>
<br><b>careful" or something.</b>

<p><b>THE CHASE FROM THIRD TO OUTSIDE</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DALLAS9978@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I remember the day with a clearness that is erie to me and my friends.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>stills brings shivers to us all as we think back to it.&nbsp; To
understand it</b>
<br><b>clearly you have to know the past.&nbsp; A while back a school in
Illinois by the</b>
<br><b>name of Our Lady of the Angels burned down, killing many kids of
all ages.</b>
<br><b>The school was rebuilt and since then we all call the school haunted.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>name is Kim and during a punishment, we saw what others had saw
and it</b>
<br><b>spooked us out of our mind.&nbsp; The third floor in our school
was never used</b>
<br><b>because when it was the students always complained.&nbsp; We were
in seventh</b>
<br><b>grade, the year was 1996 I believe, and we were in trouble.&nbsp;
About seven us</b>
<br><b>walked up and down the stairs with all of our books and the third
floor was</b>
<br><b>included.&nbsp; All the lights were off the hallways echoed with
our foot steps</b>
<br><b>and laughter.&nbsp; Our teacher did walked with us and he flipped
on the lights.</b>
<br><b>The hallways at our school all connected together and one or two
lights lit</b>
<br><b>the whole floor.&nbsp; As we made it around the hallway the lights
went off, but</b>
<br><b>no one stood there at the light switch.&nbsp; We ignored it laughing
it off. We</b>
<br><b>flipped the lights back on and continued another lap on the third
floor.&nbsp; As</b>
<br><b>we walked we heard screams and a voice telling kids to to God and
not to</b>
<br><b>worry.&nbsp; Then we heard cursing.&nbsp; Voices were every where.&nbsp;
Then we saw red</b>
<br><b>eyes and blury movement in a room.&nbsp; We screamed naturally.&nbsp;
The door swung</b>
<br><b>open and the chase began.&nbsp; We all ran.&nbsp; No one dropped
their books because no</b>
<br><b>one wanted to go back.&nbsp; Our teacher ran right with us.&nbsp;
We made it to the</b>
<br><b>stairs and went around the corner fast.&nbsp; No one saying nothing
but breathing</b>
<br><b>hard.&nbsp; Marcus looked back and screamed.&nbsp; The red eyeballs
were following us</b>
<br><b>down the stairs.&nbsp; At that moment no one cared.&nbsp; My boyfriend
at the time</b>
<br><b>grabbed my hand and dropped his books and knocked mine out my hand.&nbsp;
We ran</b>
<br><b>faster.&nbsp; By then teachers had heard our screams and were trying
to stop us</b>
<br><b>from running.&nbsp; No one listened.&nbsp; We all kept on going
and ran right out side.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The red eyes stopped at the school door.&nbsp; We heard high
pitch screams of it</b>
<br><b>being unfair and then the glass in one of the doors broke.&nbsp;
We were forced to</b>
<br><b>do research on this fire after being made to return to school.&nbsp;
With our</b>
<br><b>teachers helped we found survivors of the kids on the third floor.
They</b>
<br><b>stated that the teacher told them to pray.&nbsp; To not worry.&nbsp;
They said when the</b>
<br><b>fire reached the third floor some of them began to run out.&nbsp;
She chased them</b>
<br><b>and so did other students trying to get out.&nbsp; They made it
outside right when</b>
<br><b>a big explosion came and the tearched burned to death right by the
front</b>
<br><b>door.&nbsp; We never went back to the thid floor until the next
year because our</b>
<br><b>classes were their, but the light box had a lock on it and the doors
were</b>
<br><b>left wide open with chains.&nbsp; No one was upstairs when the lights
went out.</b>
<br><b>The school closed in 1998 and it was said that others were chased
by the red</b>
<br><b>eyes when they had a lockin at school.&nbsp; Only, they were on
the first floor</b>
<br><b>second floor and third floor.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Blue House Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: No1deevaa@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>About 4 years ago, my husband, myself and my 2 year old son had rented
this</b>
<br><b>old beatup farm house. The house was very old and was occupied by
tennants</b>
<br><b>before us who had rented it for about 10 years.</b>
<br><b>After we had moved in, strange things were going on. The first thing
was the</b>
<br><b>upstairs. My sons room was up there. I would put him upstairs for
the night</b>
<br><b>and he'd just fall asleep like a normal child. About 6 weeks after
moving in,</b>
<br><b>my son would not sleep in the room. I would rock him to get him
to sleep, but</b>
<br><b>as soon as I left the room, he'd wake up screaming and crying. (He
NEVER did</b>
<br><b>this). So, We moved his room downstairs and we moved upstairs. No
problems</b>
<br><b>with him going to sleep now. Which leads me to the next incident
that I</b>
<br><b>remember vividly. I was sleeping (upstairs). I had presents up there
for my</b>
<br><b>sons 2nd birthday. There was a book with buttons to push as you
read the</b>
<br><b>story and it made sounds. The gifts were all wrapped and in the
corner of the</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; About 3 am the book started going off like someone was
pushing the</b>
<br><b>buttons. I got up to see if the cat was messing around with it.
NOPE! The cat</b>
<br><b>was next to the bed, s! till groggy because I woke up. My husband
was asleep in</b>
<br><b>the bed. (NOTHING WAKES THAT MAN). It went thru several different
"buttons"</b>
<br><b>before it stopped.</b>
<br><b>One day when I returned from work, after no one was home all day,
I went into</b>
<br><b>the kitchen. Just an overview, the cabinets were very tall and reached
the</b>
<br><b>ceiling. I had wine glasses up on the top shelf for safe keeping
because I</b>
<br><b>knew the cat couldnot open the door and get up there to break them.(they
were</b>
<br><b>from our wedding). When I walked in, 2 glasses were smashed on the
counter.</b>
<br><b>The cupboard door was closed. NO ONE WAS THERE ALL DAY.</b>
<br><b>My husband has experienced several weird things as well. Pepper
flew out of</b>
<br><b>the cupboard over the stove and hit him in the chest. He was taking
out the</b>
<br><b>garbage one evening and some kind of strange "being" crossed in
front of his</b>
<br><b>car headlights. He said it appeared to be a teenager boy with overhauls
going</b>
<br><b>into the old, falling down garage out by the road.</b>
<br><b>We also had experienced seeing things like out of the corner of
our eye. Like</b>
<br><b>just a flash of white, like someone scurrying thru real fast and
you only</b>
<br><b>getting a glipse of them.&nbsp; The TV would turn on out of the
blue...no reason.</b>
<br><b>Also, channels would change for no reason. It was a bizarre experience.
It</b>
<br><b>has intrigued us both to learn more about this. I personally think
a being</b>
<br><b>was there. How I go about researching the house or finding out if
something</b>
<br><b>happened there has stumped me. I dont know where to begin. Id like
to find</b>
<br><b>out who it was or what it wanted.</b>
<br><b>I still go by the house from time to time. Someone had bought it
since we</b>
<br><b>lived there. These people had put on new siding and new doors and
possibly</b>
<br><b>new windows but, since then no one seems to be occupying it.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The American Museum of Astoria is Crawling with Presences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: OLLoCoPoPpy@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>The american museum of the moving image in astoria queens is haunted
without</b>
<br><b>a doubt.I first went to the museum about 12 years ago, when I was
about 10</b>
<br><b>years old and me my mother and my sister all agreed the place felt
weird and</b>
<br><b>creepy.I went back about a month ago and was reassured of the haunted
feeling</b>
<br><b>to the building after 12 years.When you walk in to the place the
feeling hits</b>
<br><b>you like a ton of bricks. Once you walk in the gift shop you feel
a really</b>
<br><b>strong presence (belive me i felt it) and the rest of the building
is no</b>
<br><b>better.On the second floor the feeling of the haunting reaches every</b>
<br><b>corner,especially the mock egyptian theater on the 2nd floor were
you can</b>
<br><b>sense an ominous presense lurking and lingering in the theater room.In
this</b>
<br><b>theater room (its kinda small for a real theater) are pantings of
faces,</b>
<br><b>egyptain and others , famous movie stars but i swear when u look
in the eyes</b>
<br><b>of the painted growcho and the other mark brother there's something
sinister</b>
<br><b>that seems to be using these pantings to hide in it is VERY VERY
creepy. The</b>
<br><b>third floor&nbsp; has its own funky feeling to it also , just like
with the rest</b>
<br><b>of the building you can sense a STRONG presense not as bad as the
2nd floor</b>
<br><b>but not so good either.&nbsp; the fourth floor was being renovated
but it to is</b>
<br><b>probably haunted.I did not sse any thing but the elavator opened
on its own</b>
<br><b>will in the lobby when i was approching it.There are many stories
by the</b>
<br><b>employees of footsteps following you in the office areas,talking
coming from</b>
<br><b>vents when no one is in the place at night. A deep voice heard in
the halls</b>
<br><b>that comes from no where and a sighting of a black lady in a white
dress that</b>
<br><b>sits in the lobby.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW&nbsp; HERES
A QUICK HISTORY OF THE BUILDING</b>
<br><b>................It was built in 1920 by paromount to bring back
film</b>
<br><b>production to ny area.then in 1944 up until 1977 it was used by
the us</b>
<br><b>army.IT was kind of delapatated and some organazation bought it
fixed it up</b>
<br><b>and started collecting old movie and film memoravillia and equipment,
when</b>
<br><b>that was done the museum opened 11 years later in 1988 . So i say
if your</b>
<br><b>live in nyc or come to nyc visit the moving image and feel how moving
the</b>
<br><b>image is.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Terrifying Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Celticladyfair@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Actually, I've had a few experiences.&nbsp; Only one was really terrifying.This</b>
<br><b>particular incident left me thinking I was either temporarily insane
or</b>
<br><b>worse, that it was true and that it happened.&nbsp; I didn't really
like either</b>
<br><b>prospect.</b>
<br><b>The first real incident happened the night my mother passed.&nbsp;
It was my</b>
<br><b>boyfriend's birthday, his senior prom, and the night my mom died.&nbsp;
My father</b>
<br><b>insisted I go to the prom, instead of staying home.&nbsp; Mom had
been ill for</b>
<br><b>years, and we all knew it was just a matter of time.&nbsp; But at
10 PM, when they</b>
<br><b>were serving dinner, I "knew".&nbsp; She was gone, and I wasn't
with her, yet I</b>
<br><b>knew she must of stopped by to say goodbye or something.&nbsp; True
enough, when I</b>
<br><b>got home, I found out that she had indeed passed and that it was
at 10 PM.</b>
<br><b>Right as I knew it would be.</b>
<br><b>5 years later, my father died.&nbsp; I was working on a cruise ship
from Los</b>
<br><b>Angeles to Ensenada Mexico (puddle jumpers), and had been for at
least 5</b>
<br><b>months.&nbsp; My brother called shore-to-ship to give me the news.&nbsp;
I went down to</b>
<br><b>the bar at mid-ship to cry for my father.&nbsp; No matter what kind
of seas we</b>
<br><b>were on, I never saw this before or again.&nbsp; I had ordered a
can of beer.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>did a 360 on the table.&nbsp; Just a perfect little circle.&nbsp;
My husbands' can was</b>
<br><b>still, but mine moved.&nbsp; "Hello, Daddy", was all I could say.</b>
<br><b>About 3 years after that, came the scary experience.&nbsp; I had
just gone to bed,</b>
<br><b>it wasn't overtly late.&nbsp; We had a waterbed in the early 80s
mind you, so it</b>
<br><b>rocked like the ocean when anyone "got in".&nbsp; The door to the
bedroom was</b>
<br><b>open, I could hear the TV on in the living room where my husband
was.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>closed my eyes to go to sleep.</b>
<br><b>Within a minute, I felt something on the bottom left corner of the</b>
<br><b>waterbed... sit down.&nbsp; No mistaking that feeling on a waterbed.&nbsp;
I opened my</b>
<br><b>eyes to look and there was nothing there.&nbsp; Instantly, there
was a weight on</b>
<br><b>my body, squishing me down into the bed, and what felt like a hand
over my</b>
<br><b>mouth to keep me from screaming and something at my throat.&nbsp;
My eyes were</b>
<br><b>wide open, and I couldn't see what was attacking me.&nbsp; This
lasted for about a</b>
<br><b>minute, then was gone.&nbsp; It took forever it seemed to gain speech
back to call</b>
<br><b>to my husband.&nbsp; All I could get out was little more than a
squeek.&nbsp; I finally</b>
<br><b>found my legs to get me out of that bed.&nbsp; Never happened again,
but I still</b>
<br><b>remember it clearly.</b>
<br><b>I've had numerous feelings over the years, more recently within
the last</b>
<br><b>year.&nbsp; Many many experiences.&nbsp; One of the ones that was
the strongest was at</b>
<br><b>a local hardware store.&nbsp; Back around the time of the waterbed
incident, the</b>
<br><b>local Builder's Emporium caught fire, and about 5 people died inside
the</b>
<br><b>building.&nbsp; It was rebuilt, and reopened as an OLE's.&nbsp;
I'm not exactly Ms.</b>
<br><b>Fixer Upper, so it wouldn't be the type of store I'd frequent.&nbsp;
Well, I had</b>
<br><b>to go there recently.&nbsp; I'd forgotten about that fire, as it
happened so many</b>
<br><b>years ago.&nbsp; But in the back left of the store, I immediately
experienced a</b>
<br><b>choking sensation , along with the feeling that my skin was burning.&nbsp;
I had</b>
<br><b>to rush out of the store, and I doubt I will go back.&nbsp; My son,
who is also a</b>
<br><b>sensitive, felt it too.&nbsp; There's plenty more... but those are
the one's that</b>
<br><b>stand out.</b>

<br><b>Stranger in the Two Rivers Valley</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Arcana7609@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was a fat, energetic 12 year old.&nbsp; I realize
those two adjectives are</b>
<br><b>seldom used in conjunction with one another, but I had lots of energy.&nbsp;
I would</b>
<br><b>roller skate everywhere and had just got elected cheerleader which
I was very</b>
<br><b>excited about.&nbsp; I was probably the worlds fattest cheerleader
at 218 lbs.&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>5'7.&nbsp; So as you can imagine I didn't exactly have boys knocking
down my door,</b>
<br><b>but I was still very outgoing.&nbsp; I mention this because it's
quite relevant to my</b>
<br><b>tale.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We lived on a farm about a
mile and a half out of town.&nbsp; The town itself</b>
<br><b>consisted of a population of around 350 people.&nbsp; My 8th grade
class had ten</b>
<br><b>kids, five boys and five girls.&nbsp; Our farm was situated at the
bottom of a hill</b>
<br><b>and there was a gravel road that ran in front of our house.&nbsp;
There was a</b>
<br><b>cornfield separated by a fairly large creek and beyond the cornfield
was the</b>
<br><b>town.&nbsp; It was fall and the fields had just been harvested.&nbsp;
The creek had a few</b>
<br><b>trees on the banks, but other than that from our front yard you
had a clear view</b>
<br><b>of the town and the area surrounding the town for miles.&nbsp; My
hometown in</b>
<br><b>Illinois is flat farm land surrounded by large hills.&nbsp; We're
a small valley</b>
<br><b>nestled right between the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in the front yard practicing
cheers and doing various acrobatic</b>
<br><b>activities.&nbsp; Our yard was surrounded by a white picket fence
which I was</b>
<br><b>supposed to be white washing.&nbsp; My parents were at work and
so without</b>
<br><b>supervision I was goofing off.&nbsp; It was still warm outside,
so I was barefoot and</b>
<br><b>in shorts.&nbsp; I had just done a front flip and was standing with
my hands in the</b>
<br><b>air pretending I was at the Olympics.&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt like someone
was watching me, so</b>
<br><b>with arms still upraised I turned my eyes toward the town and there
on the far</b>
<br><b>bank was a boy around my age watching me.&nbsp; This intrigued me
since boys in</b>
<br><b>general weren't in the habit of looking in my direction.&nbsp; I
called and waved to</b>
<br><b>him but he just stood there.&nbsp; He was wearing modern clothes.
I went out the gate</b>
<br><b>and headed over to where he was.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I was walking a tree
got in the way of my sight of him for the amount</b>
<br><b>of time it takes to walk three steps and he was gone.&nbsp; I continued
over and when</b>
<br><b>I got to the creek and saw him sitting on the bank with his head
down.&nbsp; I called</b>
<br><b>to him and he continued to ignore me.&nbsp; I figured he was embarassed
and was</b>
<br><b>afraid to say anything for fear I might think he liked me.&nbsp;
I was going to slide</b>
<br><b>down the bank, but the dirt around the creek was very cold so I
thought I would</b>
<br><b>go back and get my shoes on.&nbsp; I turned around and started to
head back, but</b>
<br><b>decided that he might leave so I turned back around and he was gone.
I looked up</b>
<br><b>and down the bank and he was not in sight.&nbsp; That side of the
bank was almost</b>
<br><b>bare and there were no trees.&nbsp; There was no where he could
have gone.&nbsp; I looked</b>
<br><b>at the water to see if he had jumped in, but it was calm. It never
dawned on me</b>
<br><b>until years later that he might have been a ghost or spirit.&nbsp;
He just looked so</b>
<br><b>real.&nbsp; The main reason it stuck with me all these years is
I always wondered who</b>
<br><b>he was since I had never seen him before.&nbsp; I used to imagine
that he came over</b>
<br><b>and we talked and that he liked me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dream about that creek
all the time.&nbsp; I often dream I live under it</b>
<br><b>and I have always wondered if my dreams might be connected to that
boy.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>almost drowned in that creek twice.&nbsp; I had also thrown a ouija
board into the</b>
<br><b>creek a little further down from where I saw that boy, but that
was 6 years</b>
<br><b>after I sighted him.&nbsp; My experience with said ouija board is
another story and</b>
<br><b>was not a pleasant experience at all.&nbsp; I hope you enjoyed my
tale. I never saw</b>
<br><b>him again.</b>

<p><b>A Few Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CeeArnie18@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hello Dave and everyone else who has shared their stories,</b>
<br><b>My name is Chris and I live in a small town called Medina, it is
in Ohio,</b>
<br><b>about 35 miles southwest of Cleveland, and I wanted you to know
that, since I</b>
<br><b>remember, have had a sense, and love for the supernatural.&nbsp;
I myself, have,</b>
<br><b>regrettably, (even though most of you think I am crazy), have not
had a</b>
<br><b>recent experience myself.&nbsp; I do, however, have a few stories
for you, one is</b>
<br><b>my own and happened a long time ago, and one is from two of my best
friends.</b>
<br><b>OK, story goes like this, my friends, ( and I will call them Will
and Grace</b>
<br><b>for anonymity's sake) babysat for a woman who was quite coldhearted
if you</b>
<br><b>ask them, and they would babysit the children of the household four
to five</b>
<br><b>times weekly, (seeing as how the woman had nothing to do besides
go out), and</b>
<br><b>they started to become fast friends with the children.&nbsp; Well,
to make a long</b>
<br><b>story short, if possible, Will was sitting alone playing Playstation
with the</b>
<br><b>little boy when the little boy happened to tell him that his daddy
had "hurt</b>
<br><b>himself and was not going to be back for awhile".&nbsp; Well, Will
knew that the</b>
<br><b>father had shot himself because the mom had been cheating on him,
so he</b>
<br><b>changed the subject once the boy brought it up.&nbsp; To get to
the freaky shit,</b>
<br><b>one night Will and Grace were babysitting the children, and Grace
had the</b>
<br><b>little girl up in the tub and was on her way to check on her when
she heard</b>
<br><b>the little girl talking to someone, (I know this is taking a lot
of room of</b>
<br><b>your site, but I feel this is important), the little girl stated
" daddy, I</b>
<br><b>want a puppy, but mommy says she can't take care of it, and she
knows I</b>
<br><b>cant", and then Grace said as clear as day, she heard the little
girl's voice</b>
<br><b>change into a man's voice saying, "well, honey, you know daddy loves
you, but</b>
<br><b>you need to talk to mommy more if you are going to get a puppy".&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well,</b>
<br><b>Grace grabbed her chest at that point and shot back down the stairs
to where</b>
<br><b>Will and the boy were playing video games.</b>
<br><b>The next experience in the house involves Will and Grace at the
same time.</b>
<br><b>Grace had told me that the little girl they babysat was the most
mild</b>
<br><b>mannered child she ever met, (i.e., never made a fuss when asked
to go to</b>
<br><b>bed, never asked for sweets, and always helped put her OLDER brother
to bed),</b>
<br><b>well, one night after taking the children to see a movie (101 Dalmatians),</b>
<br><b>they went to pull in the house's garage, and next thing they know,
the little</b>
<br><b>girl was going insane, clawing at the windows to get out of the
car, kicking</b>
<br><b>her little brother, the doors, Will and Grace, and the windows,
to get out),</b>
<br><b>and needless to say, Grace obliged and quickly pulled out of the
garage, and</b>
<br><b>Grace said as soon as she was out of the garage and had the door
closed, the</b>
<br><b>girl was as humble as can be, and cheerful. Hmmmmm...........</b>
<br><b>The next weird occurence is the last............ Anyway, that night
that the</b>
<br><b>little girl went crazy in the car they came in and played video
games and</b>
<br><b>listened to music for an hour or two, then they went to put the
kids to bed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Now normally Will and Grace would sleep on the couch in the
living room</b>
<br><b>until the mother got home from work or from the bar, BUT this particular</b>
<br><b>night, the little girl was adamant on the two spending the night
in the</b>
<br><b>parents' room, ( and this is where Dan took his own life), so they
agreed,</b>
<br><b>seeing as how it was a waterbed, and soon all were off to</b>
<br><b>sleep.....................................................2:30 AM
rolls</b>
<br><b>around, Grace awakes from a deep sleep to hear a monstrous pounding</b>
<br><b>reverberating throughout the house, so she goes to investigate,
to see if the</b>
<br><b>mother had come home, and of course, no sign of her,&nbsp; so she
goes back to</b>
<br><b>bed, dismissing it as one of those moments you wake of from a dream,
to find</b>
<br><b>it wasn't real, but before she can return to sleeping, she hears
the same</b>
<br><b>monstrous pounding, but this time, it originates at the parents
bedroom door.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; So, safe to say she immediately woke up Will to assist her
in finding out</b>
<br><b>what the sound was.&nbsp; So they both get out of the bed, and of
course it</b>
<br><b>happens again, and this sends willl into a frenzy, he went into
the KIDS'</b>
<br><b>room and got in bed with the son, but Grace got him up and they
explored the</b>
<br><b>sound,&nbsp; and both realized that they never had had a problem
sleeping in the</b>
<br><b>living room, so they eventually calmed down enough to lay down on
one of the</b>
<br><b>two couches in the living room, and immediately after that the pounding</b>
<br><b>stopped.</b>
<br><b>Now, I didn't talk to Will and Grace for about two years until recently
Will</b>
<br><b>freed himself of some problems he was having that were&nbsp; making
him work alot</b>
<br><b>of overtime every week, and they said the only reason they told
me this story</b>
<br><b>is because they thought I would be the only one to understand, seeing
as how</b>
<br><b>I am an active member of AGS.&nbsp; Now, I have a love for ghosthunting,
but am</b>
<br><b>frustrated to say I haven't SEEN anything out of this world, SINCE
I became a</b>
<br><b>ghosthunter fulltime, BUT, I have heard plenty of weird noises,
and have had</b>
<br><b>spoons flip up out of drawers into my face with no explanation,
SO Grace</b>
<br><b>figured me a more than qualified source for "confession".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I hope that you</b>
<br><b>think this story qualifies for your sight, because it is as much
true as I</b>
<br><b>was excited.&nbsp; I hope I receive a response from you, because
I have a few</b>
<br><b>other things I would like to "discuss" with you.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would
also like to thank</b>
<br><b>all of the people on this sight who shared their experiences.</b>

<p><b>Brookdale Lodge</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; rye@mike-force.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was growing up in Kansas (no it's not that long of a story)
my</b>
<br><b>Grandfather would tell us grandkids about an Inn in California with
a creek</b>
<br><b>that ran through the center of the restaurant. He said he had stayed
there</b>
<br><b>once back in the '30s. He told us the place was haunted and told
many of the</b>
<br><b>same stories we hear now, but he said that he never saw or heard
anything.</b>
<br><b>In 1996 I moved to Ben Lomond California just 1 mile south of Brookdale,
and</b>
<br><b>last year I moved to Brookdale into an old carriage house of the</b>
<br><b>estate that had been converted in to a rental house (very old</b>
<br><b>and drafty I'll tell you about that later in the e-mail). Anyway
the main</b>
<br><b>place I ALWAYS hear things from the Lodge is, when I walk down to
pick up my</b>
<br><b>mail from the Post Office (the post office is right across Hwy 9
from the</b>
<br><b>Lodge) I pass the swimming pool, I never go inside of the pool area
but I</b>
<br><b>have heard splashing like someone is swimming or someone jumped
in the pool</b>
<br><b>and no one is there, I have also heard voices like people are playing
in</b>
<br><b>there but there no one is there, and I always feel like some one
is watching</b>
<br><b>me from the pool. UNLESS people are in there then I don't feel like
I'm</b>
<br><b>being watched?!?! it's really weird. I never heard of the pool area
being</b>
<br><b>haunted until last week when I was surfing the net for info about
the lodge</b>
<br><b>after looking at your web site.</b>
<br><b>In the bathroom of the Lodge (the one by the bar and Brook Room)
I have</b>
<br><b>heard someone walk in (the sound of a man's foot steps) and turned
around to</b>
<br><b>find no one there (this has happened more than once), and Saturday
night</b>
<br><b>11-4-00 I was at the Lodge playing darts and I went to the bathroom&nbsp;
there was one</b>
<br><b>other guy in there at the time, we both had finished and were washing
our</b>
<br><b>hands, we both had flushed, but my urinal flushed 2 more times while
I was</b>
<br><b>washing my hands. We both looked at each other and got out of the
bathroom</b>
<br><b>quick. Also in the hallway to the Brook Room by the bar I have felt
cold</b>
<br><b>spots that seem to appear out of no where.</b>
<br><b>That's mostly my experiences at the Lodge, I have been there at
times when</b>
<br><b>nothing has happened. On election day 11-7-00 I went to the Lodge
to vote,</b>
<br><b>and the lodge was very warm and felt very nice to be there, like
I was</b>
<br><b>welcome, unlike most of the time when I feel like I have to keep
looking</b>
<br><b>over my shoulder because something is behind me.</b>
<br><b>Over the last few weeks I have been looking in to the ghosts of
the lodge by</b>
<br><b>asking a lot of my friends who have lived in the area for a long
time about</b>
<br><b>things they have experienced there. I mainly get the old stories
that are on</b>
<br><b>the net and a few that are not. No one I have talked to has seen
anything</b>
<br><b>but several people have heard things in the Bathroom and in the
hall way,</b>
<br><b>and they have felt cold spots, and one person saw ice on the floor
of the</b>
<br><b>Brook Room that would not melt and they did not know where it came
from.</b>
<br><b>Some of the stories I have heard are the Lodge classics, but no
one I talked</b>
<br><b>to has experienced these. The little girl walking through the Lobby
to the</b>
<br><b>Brook Room, The Judge making noises, the Gardenia or Orchid Lady
where you</b>
<br><b>smell flowers or perfume, Sounds in the Mermaid room, The young
man who</b>
<br><b>roams the upstairs of the main lodge, and I have heard of the underground</b>
<br><b>tunnels that run under hwy 9 to the cabins on the other side and
hidden</b>
<br><b>passageways and rooms.</b>
<br><b>I don't think this is supernatural but on election night long after
we voted</b>
<br><b>my wife and I were driving to the store in Ben Lomond to get dinner
when my</b>
<br><b>wife said she saw two people standing VERY still on the balcony
of the Lodge</b>
<br><b>with their arms to their sides, one was on the balcony the other
was in the</b>
<br><b>door way. I didn't tell her because she spooks easy but I had seen
the same</b>
<br><b>thing a couple of years back. Have you heard of this before?</b>
<br><b>There is one other place in the Santa Cruz Mountains I think people
should</b>
<br><b>look in to. It's called Sacpozies (I don't think my spelling is
right, but</b>
<br><b>I'll find out and e-mail it to you) it's an Italian restaurant now
but "back</b>
<br><b>in the day" it was very similar to the lodge. It was a Speak Easy
and a</b>
<br><b>Brothel with the same style hidden passageways, rooms, tunnels as
the Lodge,</b>
<br><b>and I have heard a few ghost stories about the place but can not
remember</b>
<br><b>them right now.</b>
<br><b>My place for the most part is a nice place (for a cabin that's 150
years</b>
<br><b>old). It was an old carriage house</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;and was converted into a cabin after cars took over the old
horse drawn</b>
<br><b>carriages, and now the Land lord rents the place out. The weird
thing about</b>
<br><b>my place is that the back bedroom that we use as a storage room/computer</b>
<br><b>room is always 10-15 degs. colder than the rest of the house and
is cold</b>
<br><b>even in the summer when it's 100 degs out side. In the winter it's
almost</b>
<br><b>unbearable to be in there and in the summer it's better than having
central</b>
<br><b>air :) I don't think it's anything supernatural. My wife hates the
room and</b>
<br><b>almost refuses to go in there because she says it gives her the
creeps, but</b>
<br><b>I don't mind it at all.</b>

<br><b>Visit to the Winchester House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rye@mike-force.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I was taking the tour of the house with two of my buddies Rich and
Dave in</b>
<br><b>the fall of 1997. My experience took place in one of the front rooms
of the</b>
<br><b>house, it was towards the end of the tour and I was getting rather
board of</b>
<br><b>the tour guide and found myself not really paying attention to him
or anyone</b>
<br><b>else in the room. I was snapped out of my little day dream when
I felt a</b>
<br><b>hand on my left shoulder. It was like someone was comforting me,
not strong</b>
<br><b>or forceful, but a nice firm grip. I plainly felt the fingers and
thumb of</b>
<br><b>this hand and I could tell it was a left hand. It only lasted only
a moment</b>
<br><b>until I started to look for the source of the hand. My back was
to the wall</b>
<br><b>and only Rich was in arm's length of me but he was on my left and
there was</b>
<br><b>no way he could have touched me with his left hand. I quickly placed
the</b>
<br><b>experience in the back of my mind as the tour moved on. Once outside
Rich</b>
<br><b>made the comment that the front room gave him the chills but to
Dave and I</b>
<br><b>the room felt no different than the rest of the house. When I told
them</b>
<br><b>about what I felt in the room they thought I was just playing on
Rich's</b>
<br><b>comment of the chills and didn't believe me. I don't talk about
it much</b>
<br><b>although I do believe in ghosts, heck I live 1/4 of a mile behind

<p><b>Ghostly Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: keith_and_di@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This document is meant to serve as a general, if not sporadic, listing
of experiences I have had with the unexplained. Perhaps there were ghosts,
demons, spirits...whatever. All I know is there was something there that
could not be fully understood.</b>
<br><b>I will try to list these chronologically, but I may forget some
and have to add then at different times.</b>
<br><b>The first experience I can ever remember came from the house I grew
up in, and was a multitude of unexplainable happenings that I thought I
was only privy to. At the house in Tecumseh (MI), 231 E. Cummins Street,
it was not uncommon to hear foot steps through the heating register in
the bedroom directly off from the kitchen that myself and my sisters shared
for a very long time. It was like someone was stomping as they walked up
and down the stairwell leading into the basement. This stairwell was on
the other side of the wall from that bedroom. As the "thing" would walk
past the heating duct you could hear a pounding noise, as if "he" hit his
head on the duct sticking out of the wall, followed by loud and angry cussing.
This happened almost every single night, if not. Being a young child, I
always thought I was the only one to hear it and often ran crying to mom
claiming a bad dream. Sometimes she would let me stay the rest of the night
with her, if Dad wasnt around. But if he was I had to go back to my bed,
with everyone else asleep around me.</b>
<br><b>Sometimes the stomping would continue into the house and lead through
the kitchen and out the back door. I dont know if it was the same thing,
since that one did not make and more noise than steps when in the house.
It never slammed the door, just shut it. The other thing was always slamming
the basement door and the door to the garage but seemed to stay in the
sewing room...the room adjoining the garage to the living room. This room
had a deep closet that all of us kids were afraid of. Most of the time
none of us would even go into the room if not accompanied by a sibling.
The weirdest thing about that is I remember my brother and I used to share
that room when we were really young and my bed was right next to that closet.
I cannot say if it bothered me or not.</b>
<br><b>Another oddity that occurred during those times was the constant
calling of my name at night. Not every night, but often enough to prove
I wasnt imagining it...after everyone went to sleep I would lay awake.
Later years I would find out that one of my sisters was indeed awake, but
she kept very quiet. There would always be someone calling my name. I do
not remember exactly what the voice sounded like, but I do remember it
being male and menacing. I sometimes thought it was my brother or his friends
trying to scare me. But that proved wrong. He would always be asleep when
I checked. Then I would run terrified through the house back to my bedroom
where I would pull the covers up over my head and wish the thing away.
I knew religion, but I was always so confused that I seldom tried that
as recourse. I did, on occasion, try sleeping with the bible in my hands,
but that never really did anything. I also tried praying but I didnt really
know how. I felt helpless.</b>
<br><b>At times I would experience what I now know as sleep paralysis...where
I would be able to see and hear everything going on around me but I could
not move nor speak. My sister would think I was faking it and throw stuff
at me all of the time. But it was awful. Other times I would show so much
control over my mind that I could, and still can, stare at things and make
everything around it disappear.&nbsp; I still experience the SP also, just
not as frequently as I did when I was a child.</b>
<br><b>As I grew older these things still haunted me on an almost nightly
basis, while entertaining an unrelenting fear of our open closet( not the
one mentioned previously, this one was actually in my bedroom). The closet
had no door and all three of us girls had to share it. One sister had one
side, I had the middle and my other sister had the side farthest to the
right...right next to the register. I watched a movie about this little
voodoo doll and had this insane fear it was in the closet waiting to attack
me. I still sometimes have nightmares about that show, but I know they
are now stupid. But being young, I was afraid. Nothing really happen with
that closet, I just remember the fear. According to my sister, sometimes
she would see clothing moving from her position on the top bunk, but I
dont remember that.</b>
<br><b>The stairwell/register got to bother my sister and I so much we
asked my mom and dad to rearrange the room and put our eldest sister in
the spot we were and our bunk beds against the wall with the window. Not
too long after that we started hearing this tapping noise, almost like
a tree branch scraping and tapping on the window. Strange thing is that
there was never anything there and no trees close enough to do so. We got
so scared that after awhile we refused to look out that window-afraid we
may actually see something hideous. Although we both knew about this, we
seldom talked about it. We did keep our beds that way until dad built on
my eldest sister's room, which scared me always. I hardly ever went in
there, it was too close to the basement for my liking. Plus it had a window
into the garage. My sister even admitted that it made her nervous. My other
sisiter and I did, at one time, talk to her about it and she even heard
the noise at the window. But no one ever really tried to figure it out
since we were all so scared. Eventually mom bought us new beds and I moved
mine back over to the other side of the room. Of course, the noises continued
for both of us...the window and the stairwell/register.</b>
<br><b>It was not uncommon for any of us living in the house to hear strange
noises from time to time, and even have scary events occur in the basement.
The washer and dryer were hooked up down there, and we had to go to do
our laundry. If I could afford it, I would always choose to do mine at
the Laundromat. But there were times when I had to go down there. If I
couldnt find anyone to go with me, I would force my dog Fuzzy to go down
there. Too many times for my liking he would either run back up the stairs
or refuse to go in the other room...the one with the dirt floor and where
mom put all of the canned foods. That room was scary. One year dad was
digging down there, I dont remember why, and he found some bones. He said
they looked human, but he never really told us kids about them. I think
he turned them into the police, but I do not recall anyone ever coming
out to our pad and looking around. Also, when in the basement, numerous
times the light would shut off on its own, and you would be left down
there in the dark. For the longest time I thought it was my brother doing
it, but it happened when he wasnt even there. When it did, Fuzzer would
go running up the stairs and scratch on the door to be let out. I would
have to find my way back up to the switch and turn it back on. It got to
a point where I would never go down there without a flashlight. If I went
down there at all.</b>
<br><b>One day mom fell down the steps. These steps were solid cement,
and wide enough even for the biggest misstep. She once admitted to the
feeling of being pushed, but she now denies it as not being said. But the
day it happened, she came upstairs white as a ghost and told us a little
about how she felt. She was very scared, but only bruised and scraped.
She wouldnt go back down there for a long time after that.</b>
<br><b>Another instance is when I asked Keith (boyfriend at that time,
now my husband) to go down there for me because I was too scared to. He
said that when he got about half way down, he started hearing the footsteps
and then felt something walk right through him. He never said whether it
was super cold or anything, but he remembers it and does not talk about
it. He was very frightened that day, actually made me leave. He never went
in the basement after that. During this time the entity really tried to
get my attention by calling my name even during daylight hours and intensifying
the violence in our home. By this time dad was in full drinking mode and
abusive as hell. I , ever the rambunctious one, would talk back and get
into fights with him. All the while this thing in the basement would get
louder and more bold...still never entering the house further than the
sewing room.&nbsp; But always trying to reach out to me....yelling at me
and scolding me for ignoring it...or trying to anyway.</b>
<br><b>One day a neighborhood friend came over and I was home alone. I
was watching tv with my back to the sewing room. He came in and started
watching tv with me. The thing either didnt notice him or didnt care,
and started calling me into the sewing room. This guy thought my brother
was in there and that we were messing with him. So he went into the room.
I cant say anything happened, I have no idea. But he made me leave and
go back to his house. He was petrified. I have no idea if it was because
there was nothing there, or if there was something I dont want to know
about. He never came over again, and actually started avoiding us after
that. When I think about it, he hasnt spoken to any of us since then....that
was in 1989.</b>
<br><b>A few weeks before Keith came into the picture, I met this girl
in my math class. I was in 9th grade, and she was in pre-algebra with myself
and my best friend at the time. I remember her jacket, it was silk and
had a Chinese dragon on it, was what drew me to her. She was nothing to
look at, but seemed nice. We got to talking and became somewhat friendly.
We didnt do much after school or anything, until she needed me to help
her out with a date for a friend of her boyfriends...which happened to
be Keith. Thats another story. But, we used to hang out at her pad in
her basement quite often with her. Nothing really seemed to out of the
ordinary, but when you went into her room you felt it. Something was always
watching...but never doing much else. As time went on we started noticing
strange things, like Keith going into trances or zoning out for no reason.
We just blew it off to drug use. We all experimented back then...nothing
more than pot, though. One day this girl called me over to talk about a
demon she thought she had. She talked about it and I listened, and she
talked me into bringing my eldest over ...since she was still active in
the church. During this visit Mel claimed to have seen a demon like creature
and we made a hasty retreat.</b>
<br><b>As we drove home she frantically talked about what she had seen.
She described an evil looking creature that somewhat resembled what you
would imagine a large troll to look like. She said it had the reddest eyes...and
that it started showing itself by holding something over her eyes. The
way she described it was as if someone was holding their hands over her
eyes so she couldnt see, but she felt nothing. Then while she was sitting
in the chair placed directly in front of the half-open closet, she swore
she could see the eyes looking out at her in the reflection of the mirror
across the room. She wasnt sure, but too scared to ask, and had me switch
places with her. As I sat there she looked into the mirror and said it
was still there. Talk about spooky. One thing we did notice is as we were
leaving, which my sister actually vocalized, was all that we could hear
as we drove off was the sounds of laughter. Evil laughter. Neither of us
said anything specifically about it at the time, but we were certain this
girl had set us up and was trying to do us some kind of harm to my sister
with her spirit. My other sister was at home at the time, and according
to my mom she was frantically pacing the house waiting for our safe return.&nbsp;
She said she had to strongest feeling of impending doom.....she so happy
to see us that she hugged both of us.&nbsp; She didn't even know where
we were going or why.</b><b></b>
<p><b>A few months, as we grew apart from that day on, the same girl friend
had a visit from her boyfriend, Steve, from California. He was heavy into
devil worship and did some weird things. One thing that really made me
uncomfortable was when we went for a walk and he asked us to leave him
at the largest, yet the spookiest grave yard in Tecumseh. What disturbed
me the most was that he entered into the mausoleum that I knew had rusty
locks that would not open. I dont know how he got in or out, but he did.
We met up later at a friends house, the aforementioned girl and I were
actually hanging out together. I think that was the day I made her up for
Steve. She looked really good. Anyway, we partied pretty hard and spent
a lot of time together while he was in town. The last encounter I had with
Steve was when we were again partying at our friend's pad and he offered
to walk me home, claiming that there were untrustworthy people out there
to watch out for. Since I was drunk I said ok, not thinking anything of
it. His grilfriend stayed at the party, and everything seemed cool. Until
he started putting the moves on me. So, I pushed him away and he tried
to kiss me goodnight on my front porch. I kept pushing him away, this time
he was getting forceful with me. My Dad heard the commotion and ended up
coming out and putting a stop to it. At that point he left my house, walked
down the road, stopped in the middle of the road, dropped to his knees
and started chanting. I have no idea what he did/said, but I was scared.</b>
<br><b>After that I never talked to that girl or Steve. He eventually left
and went back to California and things went back to normal...for my life.
During the time he was in Michigan, I cannot say whether the spirit in
the house was bothered or aroused, or whatever, since I was heavily drinking
and normally passed out when I hit the bed. I think I did that to avoid
the occurrences.</b>
<br><b>When Dad finally moved out for good, my sister and I moved into
the front bedroom that mom and dad had shared, and mom moved into our old
one. No one slept in my eldest sister's room after she moved out. We just
never wanted to.</b>
<br><b>In the front room we had some problems at times, one time specifically.
It was funny...my sister and I were sitting around telling stories about
the old room and what we felt when all of the sudden the wires outside
our bedroom window caught on fire and we had a brown out. I cant say that
had anything to do with our talking, but we both were freaked out. My bed
was right next to the window, so I never picked up on that noise from the
stairwell, but I was then introduced to something new. I dont know if
it was an ongoing thing that was just new to me or if it was something
that I brought with me into the front of the house. No matter, but I would
hear something walking around in the living room and sometimes open the
bathroom door. I specifically remember a time when I got up to go to the
bathroom, heard someone in there and waited for like 20 minutes. I then
got up and knocked on the door but no one answered and the light was off.
I opened the door tentatively, hoping not to find my brother asleep on
the toilet, and found no one in there. I had to go really bad, but went
back to bed in fear instead. I stayed up all night after that.</b>
<br><b>During my time spent in the back bedroom, I used to have many bad
dreams. I need to tell about some right now, since they are still fresh
in my mind...and probably will always be.</b>
<br><b>All the dreams I am going to talk about were experienced while I
was reading this book called Phantoms (not the one by Dean Koontz). I have
never found it again, but I will keep looking. The first dream took place
in a very beautiful wooded park, with a huge gazebo. We were having a family
reunion, and for some reason brought Fuzzer along. It was getting very
dark and my sister and I decided to clean up the mess. We had Fuzzy with
us and we went around with garbage bags throwing everything away. There
was a decent size mess, the reunion was large. It was getting darker and
darker when we started hearing this demonic like howling, kind of like
and animal, but was scarier. Fuzzer darted off into the woods, to either
chase after that or whatever. We freaked out and started cleaning up faster
while calling Fuzzer back to us. He didnt return and she thought she needed
to go find him. I begged her not to leave, that we should stay together.
All the while the howling is getting closer and way louder. The woods are
getting blacker and blacker....time was running out. I turned to get another
garbage bag and when I turned back around my sister was gone. I started
hollering for her, and even went over to our Jeep to see if she was there.
No deal. So I went back to the gazebo, just in case she would return to
it. I started cleaning and I could still hear the howling getting closer
and closer. Finally, it grew quiet and I started to relax...just a little.
All of the sudden I heard the howl...louder than life. I turned around...feeling
the presence behind me...and woke up. That, even to this day, was the scariest
dream I have ever had.</b>
<br><b>The next dream I remember from them was that we were in the old
house, but it was in like a subdivision where it sat out front with a few
other houses, and the roads ran on rows behind it...with houses lining
the streets. They ran to this other street, kind of making a filled-in
box. For some reason we were all together, the family I mean, and we were
celebrating something. The inside of the house was completely different,
but I knew it was the same house. For some reason, this house was not where
mom lived and dad send myself and my sister to drive all the way down the
road behind the house to another house that mom was in. It was late at
night, everything was black. I remember seeing all of these demonic symbols
lit up in the yards we passed, but no one was around. We drove to the house,
picked up mom, and drove back the original house. Once we got in there,
the house was only lit by red-flamed candles. It seemed like there was
no electricity. Anyway, this guy comes to the door and dad lets him in.
He was wearing a reaper robe, and looked very menacing. I do not remember
what his face looked like at that time, but I do recall him attacking my
family somehow. He grabbed me and I kept pushing him away. He had a hold
of my arms above the elbows, but I could still push at his face. As I did
so, his skin began to slide over his face...almost like you would see cheese
do to a pizza. What it revealed was nothing, a blank bloody canvas....then
I woke up.</b>
<br><b>During my life in the old house, I had numerous dreams that I have
forgotten over time. I seem to always..still..dream about vampires.&nbsp;
I can't figure that out.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, I am going to skip ahead quite a bit to when my mother,
sisiter, and I decided to have a few drinks to celebrate our new home in
Jackson, MI. My sis and I started walking around the neighborhood and talking
about the old house. She told me she would never go back. She also admitted
to hearing whatever call my name every night, and the thing in the basement.
She said she kept quiet out of fear that it would start bugging her. Very
selfish, but understandable. She also told me of an experience that she
had at college, with her fish tank stuff. She always claimed to hear sweet
singing when she played bands like Boston and Bad Company, so she did so
often to please the spirit. But a few times she caught "her" in the fish
tank stuff...pulling it out of the closet and looking through it curiously.
She never did any damage, and one night Jeannette asked her to be quiet
since she had exams the next day and that was the last time she saw/heard
her....except for the singing.&nbsp; What she described was just a figure
in the shadows....like someone's shadow itself.</b>
<br><b>So, lets jump ahead again, the when I lived with my now mother-in-law.
There are definitely multiple spirits within that house, well, maybe there
is only one...but it has a huge variety of personalities and/or moods.
But I will start with the upstairs, and the spirit that seemed to hang
out up there. Basically all that would happen is that the door between
the rooms would slam shut with no wind or reason, or the closet door would
shut while I was in it....something it did not do by itself. One day we
had a helium balloon that was at about half mast. It was too funny to watch
that balloon chase my dog Daisy around the room with it! Keith even saw
it. Then another time he claimed there was nothing in there. I said, ok
then...if you are here could you shut the door? The door slammed shut.
Keith turned paler than pale, as I walked over and opened back up the door.
Nothing there. This spirit always reminded me of a child.....ever prankish.....probably
what most would consider a poltergeist.&nbsp; Things would come up missing
or be misplaced, but never did I feel threatened or scared.&nbsp; Well,
I take that back...there was this one time when I was sitting on my bed
reading and all of the windows just started rattling really hard, like
I would imagine from a mild earth quake.&nbsp; I ran downstairs and asked
my mother-in-law if she heard it but she said it was nothing.&nbsp; I know
she heard something, she just didn't want to admit it.&nbsp; That was kind
of scary since it had never expressed itself in such a way.&nbsp; That
leads me to beleive there was more than one....</b>
<br><b>Downstairs in the spare bedroom there is something odd going on.
When you lay down you can hear people talking...it sounds like a couple
of people talking just low enough so you cant make out the words. It goes
on for the entire night, but nothing else happens. If you have ever watched
that older movie "The Haunted", the voices sounded exactly like those the
woman heard when she laid her head down on her pillow. Sort of a whispery-non
identifiable type of talking. When my neice was little she would sometimes
sleep in that room.&nbsp; She would always wake up screaming as if in pain.....we
could never figure it out.</b>
<br><b>The reason I say something not-so-nice may reside there is from
the few experiences I had. One day I was laying on the couch and awoke
to hear the sounds of Sara (my niece mentioned above, who was right around
2 years old) playing and hollering my name outside. I got up and ran to
the door to find no one there, I was alone. Another time I was in the living
room watching TV and heard the sound of my brother talking on the answering
machine. I hadnt heard the phone ring, but stranger things have happened.
So, I walked over to the machine to find no messages. I dialed *69, and
no one had called. I shrugged it off as imagination. Then, a few days later
I was watching tv in my mother-in-laws room while she was on vacation
and Keith was at work. I heard, over the tv, what sounded like Keith hollering
to me..."Hey Hon". So I went into the dining room and even to the porch
to see if he was home early. I checked the machine again, thinking maybe
the ringer on the phone was turned off or something. Nothing. So, I went
back to the room and heard it again....except this time it came from the
basement. I tried to ignore it, but it happened again. At this point I
just hollered out...I am not going to answer you....please leave me alone.
For the rest of the night it did.</b>
<br><b>I have the feeling that it may have been the nice one, trying to
get a message to me. Maybe it enjoyed my company so much that it didnt
want me to move? That was right before we moved here, so I will never know.
I do know it did not follow us here.&nbsp; Every time I go back ther, which
is often, I feel something watching me.....and I always feel a strong urge
to go upstairs.&nbsp; I don't know if it is for memory sake or not.&nbsp;
I can't explain it.</b>
<br><b>That is not to say we havent had our own experiences in this house.
There for a long time, eggs used to come up missing from our refrigerator.
It was odd, no one would have eaten then or cooked them...and we never
found them. Then the doll. When I was a child my mom used to buy us these
Stacy dolls...little figurine dolls that really only their heads moved.
I had one..actually I think it may have been my sister's, that had red
hair, wearing a pair of jeans. I am not sure of the top...at least I couldnt
swear by it. I know it was painted on. I lost this doll, that I do remember,
at the old house. One day, after spending extensive time cleaning out the
bathroom cupboards, I found that doll sitting right in plain sight. There
is no way I put her there, and I asked all of the kids. No one had ever
seen it before, or at least not since I lost it in the old house. How it
got there is a mystery. Now I keep it in a closet with the kids toys. The
next thing I found with a similar story, was that pink comb that I wrote
my name on with a silver marker. We found that in my Dads truck, after
Keith had cleaned it out (after we bought it). We opened the door and found
it sitting right there on the seat one day...plain as day. We hadnt seen
it before, and I had lost it at the old house...right as we were moving
out. There is no way Dad could have taken it, since he did not live there
at the time. I have since asked/told him about it and it really spooked
him.</b>
<br><b>Other things that happen here arent bad, just the scratching on
the back door every once in a while, it sounds like my dog when she wants
to be let in...but nothing is ever there when we look....and the smell
of cookies in the bedroom. I found out from my neighbor that her brother
used to live here before he died (in this house I might add) and that he
always used to bake cookies...those pre-made ones, and eat them while watching
TV in the back bedroom. Nothing too unpleasant, and definitely not scary.
But, when I told her of the lingering scent, she seemed quite disturbed,
to say the least.&nbsp; I still experience the window rattling her though,
something I never tied into the old house until I started writing this.&nbsp;
A few times when I have been in there really late...talking to my brother
on the phone with the lights on, the windows start shaking as if someone
is out there pounding on them.&nbsp; No one is ever there, nor any tracks.&nbsp;
Plus, those windows are up too high..we live on a hill, for anyone to reach
without major difficulty.&nbsp; And they are not loose enough to shake....even
if you pound on them.&nbsp; That does always seems to startle me a bit.</b>
<br><b>We have yet to have anything else happen, and hope it stays calm
until we move. What will a new house bring? Time will only tell. If I have
my way I will have an old farm house that probably will hold a lot of strange
occurrences. I just cant get enough of history.....especially when it
comes to houses and such. By the way, regarding the house I grew up in.....my
mother broke down and told me a true-fact about that house only a few years
ago. It seems that soon after it was built a known criminal lived there.
He was in and out of jail a lot and was a bad dude. It turns out that after
one of his illegal excursions, he was chased back to the house by the police.
Whatever he had done must have been very bad, since instead of giving up
and spending some time in jail like he used to, he decided to have a shoot-out
with the police from a perch on the roof top of the house. He was eventually
shot down, after fatally wounding three officers, and died in the back
yard. This may or may not give notion to what still exists within that
house. Still, to this day, if I drive past it just for memories sake, I
get the feeling the spirit is watching and daring me to re-enter. Sorry,
no can do. I will not ever go back to that house, unless it is burning
to the ground!</b>
<br><b>Thank you for reading this long collection of my experiences. I
have decided to start documenting this type of stuff in order to prove
that I am not insane...this stuff really does happen to anyone.</b>

<br><b>Bed Making Ghost</b>
<br><b>By: lee_terra@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>It all started about 5 years years ago when i was living in a small
townhouse with just my mother.&nbsp; She was working nights and i was watching
T.V.&nbsp; We have a picture of Mary(jesus' mother) above our T.V.&nbsp;
What happened was the T.V. channels started flickering and the picture
fell landing straight up looking at me.&nbsp; I called my mother hysterical,
and she came home early from work.&nbsp; The following summer, we went
to california.&nbsp; When i returned, i walked into my room to find a small
picture of mary on my floor....with a small light shining upon it.&nbsp;
The picture is now framed in my room.&nbsp; A few weeks later i found a
mary medallion on my dresser, no one knows where it came from.&nbsp; Although,
these were the good things that have happened to me because things changed
after i moved into my new house 4 years ago.&nbsp; Having 4 older brothers
my brother and i moved into the basement and immediatly noticed some strange
things.&nbsp; Sometimes late at night i would come home and hear faint
conversations in the basement, thinking it was my brother on the phone
or watching t.v, although, when i went downstairs no one was there..including
my brother.&nbsp; One night about eight months ago i was watching t.v,
and my family was in bed, it was around 3am.&nbsp; I heard some wistling..calling
my dog.&nbsp; My dog who was sitting next to me started to get agitated,
and me worried.&nbsp; But every time i put the t.v. on mute, the wistling
would stop.&nbsp; After the 4th time i called to my mom asking her if she
was calling my dog for some odd reason, but she yelled back at me to go
to bed.&nbsp; When it happened the 5th time i ran up to my mothers room
and buried my head in her pillow.&nbsp; She turned on her bedside lamp,
which started flickering and her alarm clock went off LOUD.&nbsp; We both
held eachother tight. A few weeks later my mother was sitting in the living
room when water started dripping on her head. freaked out she had my brothers
get on chairs and check the entire celing for a leak but there was none.&nbsp;
This happened to her again in another room.&nbsp; Lastly, just yesterday,
my room was messy and my mom was making a nice pile in my room for me to
clean up.&nbsp; She stipped my bed to wash my sheets.&nbsp; When i came
down to my room i noticed the huge mess i had to clean up, and my bed perfectly
made, with freshly washed sheets.&nbsp; The next day my mother asked me
a question that put me in tears.&nbsp; She asked&nbsp; me "so u actually
made your own bed this time, without making me do it?" But the fact is
i didnt make my bed and my mom didnt either.&nbsp; My mother told me that
my sheets were in the washing machine and had not yet been dried.&nbsp;
It doesnt make sense...but i was bawling i was so confused and scared.&nbsp;
It was either 1 of 2 reasons.&nbsp; A ghost, or some pervert broke into
my house and made my bed.&nbsp; Most likly it is the ghost, but why.</b>

<p><b>Is their a Ghost in the House????</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Gerty2@citnet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>About 7 years ago, strange things started happening in our house.&nbsp;
I think well before this we had heard noises but just passed them off as
" the house settling", but now we know better.&nbsp; We live in an old
house but we have added on a family room and dining room and changed some
of the other rooms in the old half of the house.&nbsp; Most of the occurances
happen in the old part of the house, however some do occur in the addition.</b>
<br><b>Up in the attic we will hear footsteps walking around and the floor
boards creaking when everyone is downstairs and nobody is up their.&nbsp;
Sometimes I hear this in my bedroom under the attic when I am home by myself.</b>
<br><b>Years ago their was a knock on the door but nobody answered me when
i said who is it and my daughter thought I was calling her and came and
said what and I said did you knock on my door and she said no.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My daughter shut off her light one night and started to walk out the door
and the light switch flicked back on, we both just looked at eachother
and she ran out of the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other occuances are things disappearing
and you search for them and a day or so later they will turn up either
where you left it or in another spot of the house.</b>
<br><b>My husband thinks that me and my two daughters are crazy becasue
MOST of this stuff happens when he is not around.&nbsp; My sister was skeptical
too until one night last year we were all in the kitchen and my husband
was at the refrigerator and my sister and i were leaning on the sink/cabinets.&nbsp;
Above my sink is two cabinet doors that have glass in them, they are very
old and they have that little wheel that clicks shut to keep it closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
All the sudden the cabinet popped open and the door swung open, she screamed
and ran and got her purse and said, bye see you later, i am out of here!!</b>
<br><b>A couple years ago i was awakened from my sleep and i thought it
was one of my daughters waking me up becasue something was poking me in
my shoulder, i sat up and looked and it was dark and nobody was thier but
I could still feel the pain where it had pushed on me.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I could go on and on with other occurances but end it here.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think we just have a mischeivious poltergeist.&nbsp; What do you think???</b>

<p><b>"Phantom Cat"</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1992 my mother and I moved into a new
home in North Adams, MA. Immediately stange things began occuring in the
house. Often we would see dark shapes that resembled a cat out of the corner
of our eyes. However, when we would turn look at it, nothing was there.
Within a month of moving in, my mother's set of cat drinking glasses that
she had for many years smashed one by one.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes our pet cats would stare intensely
at nothing in the living room.</b>
<br><b>Often, we would feel an invisible something touching us or brushing
by us. Occasionally, the phantom cat, as we named it, would manifest itself
visually and we would often mistake it for our pet cats. For instance,
once I saw our pet cat at the door waiting to be let out. However, when
I reached the door and looked down, the cat was not there, nor anywhere
in the room for that matter.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have never been harmed by the phantom cat
and my mother is opposed to any type of investigation, for fear that it
may needlessly antogonize the spirit. My mother still resides at that house
today after nearly eight years.</b>

<p><b>Personal Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: amzworld@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have lived in the same old house in Colorado
Springs, Colorado for</b>
<br><b>more than five years. From the moment I moved in strange things
began to</b>
<br><b>occur. I need to explain that these things were in and of themselves
very</b>
<br><b>typical of things that can be experienced in a haunting but the
thing is</b>
<br><b>that I did not live in the house alone and the haunting would only
reveal</b>
<br><b>itself to me. When I first moved in to the property on the old westside
of</b>
<br><b>Colorado Springs I had a female roommate who was always sure to
pay her</b>
<br><b>bills but was somewhat of a free spirit and frequently traveled,
leaving the</b>
<br><b>state for one to two weeks at a time. I can say without any stretching
of</b>
<br><b>the truth that th very minute my roommate left the haunting activity
would</b>
<br><b>spring to life. In the begining it was small episodes that any sane
man</b>
<br><b>would discount- it was the wind, this is an old house, etc. The
first time</b>
<br><b>my roommate left was for two weeks to visit some friends in Seattle
within</b>
<br><b>the hour of her leaving I began to hear footsteps-very heavy and
clear, as</b>
<br><b>if someone was moving about in the attic. The sounds were very deliberate</b>
<br><b>and if I let them they would last up to a half hour or more- of
course the</b>
<br><b>first many times I rushed to investigate, climbing the small stairway
to the</b>
<br><b>attic with flashlight in hand only to find silence and an empty
attic. This</b>
<br><b>was the small begining that came to be a full blown haunting.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spirit that enjoyed performing for me quickly
graduated from attic</b>
<br><b>sounds to all-thru-the-house-sounds.&nbsp; The new disturbances
included at times</b>
<br><b>a constant dull thud that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere
and</b>
<br><b>doors being heard slamming but never seen doing so. On two or three</b>
<br><b>occasions my television came on at odd hours of the early morning
(two or</b>
<br><b>three a.m.) at an uncomfortable volume. On another occasion my stereo
came</b>
<br><b>on playing a very obscure song at a volume that disturbed my neighbors.
I</b>
<br><b>experienced knocking on the front and back doors when I was near
them only</b>
<br><b>to find no one there. On one cold winter night I was alone in the
house</b>
<br><b>taking a shower when I heard a violent rapping at my bathroom window,</b>
<br><b>thinking a friend had tried the front door and failed to reach me
I</b>
<br><b>proceeded to exit the shower, grab a robe and go to the door. I
opened the</b>
<br><b>door to find no friend and a complete lack of cars on my street
in front of</b>
<br><b>my house. Not thinking twice about it I went to my room to dry off
and warm</b>
<br><b>up, it was then I heard a loud, deliberate knocking at my bedroom
window,</b>
<br><b>this window is very large and I quickly pulled the blinds to find
nothing.</b>
<br><b>What does this spirit want so bad to follow me through the house
knocking on</b>
<br><b>windows?</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have stated and will maintain all of this
occured when I was the</b>
<br><b>only tenant home at the time. After three years my roommate moved
out and I</b>
<br><b>lived alone in the house for the next year. This year became&nbsp;
an unending</b>
<br><b>campaign of ghostly pranks played on me at a frequency that a weaker
man</b>
<br><b>would not have put up with. Some pranks were mild- lights turning
off and</b>
<br><b>on, I would be at the very back of the house in the laundry room
doing wash</b>
<br><b>and the lights would turn off I would some times call aloud to have
the</b>
<br><b>lights back and they would resume. At night I would lock the house
up tight</b>
<br><b>to awake the next day to doors unlocked and standing open(which
was very</b>
<br><b>cold in the winter months). I would lock up the house to go to work
and come</b>
<br><b>home to unlocked doors and every light in the house on and every
interior</b>
<br><b>door open wide( to the bedrooms and to the basement). I would frequently</b>
<br><b>arrive home to the television on or my stereo blasting(my neighbors
would</b>
<br><b>ask why I had to play music so loud all day). During this year alone
these</b>
<br><b>things ocurred about every three or four days.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The latest chapter in this story is yes I still live
here and now I live</b>
<br><b>here with my fiancee. Prior to her moving in the pranks became slightly
more</b>
<br><b>sinister. I was often awakened a little after three a.m. this happened</b>
<br><b>frequently so I must assume this time is significant to my lost
soul</b>
<br><b>prankster. On one or two occasions I was awakened to someone calling
my name</b>
<br><b>aloud, very urgently, very quietly and only once each time.&nbsp;
I own few</b>
<br><b>religious items but they would frequently vanish off the wall or
my desk to</b>
<br><b>mysteriously reappear days or weeks later in disturbing new areas,
in my bed</b>
<br><b>or in the middle of a doorway or walkway in the house. My fiancee
moved in</b>
<br><b>and I had a brief prank free time. It did not take long for my ghostly</b>
<br><b>housemate to come back to me and in a surprising twist reveal itself
to my</b>
<br><b>fiancee!&nbsp; My ladly love had lived with me for maybe two months
when she</b>
<br><b>began to experience many of the things I had all these years.&nbsp;
My girlfriend</b>
<br><b>seems to have had an odd effect on the old arrangement for now the
spirit</b>
<br><b>has chosen to show itself as an apparation, on two occasions my
fiancee has</b>
<br><b>seen the ghost of an attractive middle-aged woman in a long flowy
dress</b>
<br><b>silently walking by our room or standing near our bed.&nbsp; I have
even seen her</b>
<br><b>but only once in the living room, I was watching television when
I looked up</b>
<br><b>to see an unclear, smoky female figure standing in the doorway to
the</b>
<br><b>kitchen before my eyes could focus further she was gone.&nbsp; My
ghostly</b>
<br><b>roommate of five years seems to have tired a little recently choosing
to</b>
<br><b>haunt and prank me far less frequently than in the past perhaps
she likes my</b>
<br><b>fiancee, perhaps she knows I'm not leaving anytime soon...rest assured
that</b>
<br><b>there are still times when I cannot find my car keys for a week
and there</b>
<br><b>are still days when I come home to an unlocked brightly lit house.</b>

<p><b>Paranormal Activity</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: NoHitter77@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello,&nbsp; My name is BJ and I am from Oklahoma City, OK.&nbsp;
I came across your</b>
<br><b>website and thought I would send a story I have.&nbsp; On January
27, 2000, my</b>
<br><b>grandfather died of a heart attack in his home while he was sleeping.&nbsp;
After</b>
<br><b>5 or 6 months my parents, (My grandfather was my mother's dad),
my parents</b>
<br><b>were visiting my grandmother at her home.&nbsp; They were gathered
around the</b>
<br><b>kitchen table visiting, when one of the lights on the ceiling light
above</b>
<br><b>when out. At first we thought it was a coincidence that just before
my</b>
<br><b>grandfather died, my parents and grandmother wanted to change the
light</b>
<br><b>fixtures on that very ceiling light.&nbsp; My grandfather told everyone
not to</b>
<br><b>change it and that it was just fine the way it was.&nbsp; When the
light burned</b>
<br><b>out, my father grabbed a brand new light bulb and replaced the old
one.</b>
<br><b>After a few minutes, the brand new light that was just put in, burned
out.</b>
<br><b>When my dad examined the wires and found nothing unusual, he put
in yet</b>
<br><b>another light bulb.&nbsp; Again, a few minutes later the bulb burned
out.&nbsp; I guess</b>
<br><b>my grandfather didn't want anything done to the light on the ceiling,
and was</b>
<br><b>determined to prove his point even beyond his death.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Paralyzed by a ghost?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Ldybugg10@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I have always been fascinated by the paranormal, but had never had
an</b>
<br><b>experience myself.&nbsp; That was up until 2 weeks ago.&nbsp; My
boyfriend and I live</b>
<br><b>in an apartment in a brand new complex.&nbsp; I was laying in bed
one night, and</b>
<br><b>he was on the verge of being asleep.&nbsp; I had my eyes closed
but was not</b>
<br><b>asleep.&nbsp; I was fully aware of everything going on around me.&nbsp;
All of a</b>
<br><b>sudden, I got this totally eerie feeling and my whole body became
paralyzed!</b>
<br><b>I tried to move, but I couldn't.&nbsp; I almost felt like something
was holding me</b>
<br><b>still.&nbsp; I began to panic, and I tried to scream for my boyfriend
to help me,</b>
<br><b>but no words would come, like my lips were frozen in place.&nbsp;
I finally was</b>
<br><b>released, and I told my boyfriend what happened.&nbsp; he laughed
and said that it</b>
<br><b>was just my body falling asleep.&nbsp; But I was awake!&nbsp; I
tried to fall asleep,</b>
<br><b>and it happened again!&nbsp; This time I was still paralyzed but
I finally forced</b>
<br><b>out a whimper that woke my boyfriend.&nbsp; I as soon as he moved,
it stopped.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>wasn't the first time it happened, but I b</b>
<br><b>lew it off the first time.&nbsp; I just cried and was terrified
to go back to</b>
<br><b>sleep.&nbsp; I silently prayed for whatever was there to leave me
alone, and I was</b>
<br><b>able to go to sleep in peace after about an hour.&nbsp; Our development
is very</b>
<br><b>new, but the area we live in is very old and full of history.&nbsp;
It's an old</b>
<br><b>railroading town.&nbsp; I wonder if maybe a ghost attacked me.&nbsp;

<p><b>Our Old House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rlhicks@villagrove.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was 11 years old I had a experience with the other world,
and one of the inhabitants. We lived in a house located on main St. in
Urbana Illinois, in a quiet college town. We had moved back from Colorado
that year, to be closer to our family members. On first sight the new home/(rather
large Victorian home) seemed peaceful and nicely laid out, with all its
odd shaped rooms and little alcoves. I had made my room on the enclosed(screened)
front porch due to the summer heat. As I lay sleeping in my familiar and
comfortable old feather bed, in my new surroundings. It Began!!!!&nbsp;
I had just begun to sleep, when I heard the high backed wicker chairs located
next to my bed creaked as if someone had just sat down. I opened my eyes
to look at the chair, and although nothing was visible. There was a sense
about the room, that I was not alone. As time wore on over the next 2 months
this occurrence became more frequent, and continued nightly. I do not want
to mislead the readers of this site in any way. That is why I will try
to be brief, but it is a long and detailed story. It contains some things,
that had I not have seen it with own two eyes I probably wouldn't believe
it eather. But I'll hit the highlights in order.</b>
<br><b>I had many things happen in the house, many unbelievable shadows.
In the west bedroom there was a closet door that no matter what amount
of toys and debris could be piled in front of it, in the morning it would
be standing open. Even after the armada of toys that were strategically
placed in front of the door nightly, it became part of my nightly ritual
to try to protect myself against this unseen, but always felt presence
of evil. Again I digress, the shadowy figure that was seen by mother as
well as myself on many occasions was later discovered. My mother and I
grew a special bond for I believe our fear was the same, but yet we never
really spoke openly about what we were seeing. Especially to my father,
for he is still a very level headed typical dad. (I love him) Well one
night my cousin spent the night, and we sat up late playing a board game.
After we both tired of the game, we shut off the lights and began yaking.
11 year old boys trying to get a grip on how the world works, and not about
to understand what they were about to witness. Between the outer porch
and the bedroom, there were 3 doorways. Clearly visible from my room, the
same shadowy figure that I had witnessed on many occasions. This time seemed
much clearer, and you could distinctly visibly see a woman floating through
the doorway. She seemed very tall and you could see that she had her hair
in a beehive style. Popular during the 1960's, and piled straight up. Her
eye sockets you could see right through, same with her feet and legs. The
garmet that she appeared to wear, looked as if it were a frock/house type
coat. My cousin and I observed the woman enter the room, walk to the wicker
chair nearest the bed and sat dow. The apparition then repeated the same
steps back out of the room. (extremely freaked out, oh yes.) Well as time
went on, a decade passed and my cousin and I were at a old aunts house,
in a nearby town of BonnvilleIl. When somehow we got on the subject of
ghosts somehow. When Aunt Pat told us of the ghostly things she had seen
over the years inside her home. It was a one time the old railroad hotel,
and in this rural; area the only place for travelers to stay. Well she
told us of how she had encountered spirits in her own home. My cousin and
I began snickering, at the degree, and the way she told the story of her
mild brush with other side. When I said to my cousin:well its nothing like
102", Aunt pat said"102 where?" Main St. aunt Pat, why. Aunt pat began
to tell us the story of a old woman that she knew years ago who lived there.
I asked aunt Pat what was she like? Aunt Pat grew kind of quiet, and began
tell us that the woman had hung herself in a closet in the house. I didn't
have to ask which one, I felt I already knew. I then asked aunt Pat what
the woman looked like. She described as the following, a very tall woman,
who always carried a beehive hair-do. Mine and my cousins blood ran cold.
I always kept a eye on the place as I passed down main. And it seemed as
if the place was always acquiring new renters, but it is a college town.
But my mother and I finally had a real talk about our time at the house.
Mom revealed to me that while there she would have these horrible dreams
of this tall older woman, that would choke her with icy fingers. Each time
she would awake, in a cold sweat. I advised her of what aunt Pat had told
me , as well as telling her the story of my events.&nbsp; Later that same
year, the headlines of the local news were ran " High school senior hangs
himself at local residence". Guess where? Guess which closet?..................................Thanks
for letting me give you the condensed vision. I know what you might think,
but these were very real, and true events. I would tell it under oath,
and on any bible.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Our House by the Cemetery</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jnittler@oakwood.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>We moved into this house in march of 1999. Its on Winchester blvd,
in Santa Clara. Right down the street from the Winchester mystery house.
If you keep going down the street there is mission cemetery on your left,
then past that is the "big"one on the right.&nbsp; I live right across
the street.&nbsp; Our experiences in the house aren't huge,but still scary.
In the kitchen our cabinets refuse to stay closed. You can close them all,
walk away, then come back 10 minutes later and they will all be open again.</b>
<br><b>One night I was in my bedroom alone. My fianc&eacute; was out with
some friends. I was on the bed folding laundry and watching TV.&nbsp; Then
from on top of the television one of my glass votive candle holders came
flying at me! It dropped on the floor and rolled under the bed. I was a
little freaked. I told my fianc&eacute;, but of course, him being a nonbeliever...did
not believe me.&nbsp; Another time it was about 2am. I was woken from my
sleep by someone knocking on my bedroom door. Our bedroom is on the 3rd
floor. So I got out of bed thinking it was my mom or my little sister,
and opened the door. Nobody was there. I walked out and looked downstairs
and called out "what?"&nbsp; Then again "MOM?" nobody answered back. So
I went back to the bedroom and woke up my fianc&eacute; and made him check
the whole house! He was a little upset that he had too.&nbsp; I tried to
convince him but to no avail.&nbsp; (these non believers).&nbsp; My little
sister refuses to sleep in her room. She said she is woken up every night
by noises coming from her closet.(I don't know if that's true).&nbsp; Anyway,
its not all the time things like this happen. I think its just spirits
passing through on their way to the cemetery.</b>

<p><b>Noises</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: brackenmc1@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen and heard many things in the little
life that I lived so far.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;This particular event took place in my new bedroom of the
new house my mom</b>
<br><b>had just bought.&nbsp; It was Sunday night when this ordeal took
place.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember laying in bed, completely in a deep
sleep.&nbsp; I know I wasn't</b>
<br><b>that sleep that I don't know when someone is coming into my room.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>lying on my stomach, with my head propped up on a pillow when I
heard my</b>
<br><b>bedroom door open and someone walked in.&nbsp; I know it was a woman
that walked</b>
<br><b>into my bedroom, because I heard heels clapping against my hard
wooden floor.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;As the women came into my bedroom, a very loud noise began
to play louder</b>
<br><b>and louder in my ear.&nbsp; After the noise became softer, I was
then able to run</b>
<br><b>out of the room.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every since this incident has taken place, there
has been a breathing</b>
<br><b>noise in my ear.&nbsp; This noise comes and goes when it pleases.&nbsp;
What I have</b>
<br><b>found is that when i'm mad it comes real hard.&nbsp; I also found
that it strikes</b>
<br><b>more after 9:00 at night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people tell me that I have a witch riding
my back.&nbsp; Others tell me</b>
<br><b>that the child is the product of it's parents sins and that I just
so happen</b>
<br><b>to be that child.&nbsp; I just hope that whatever it is, will come
to a cease.&nbsp; As</b>
<br><b>a young adult, I believe that when I get older, these mishappenings
will</b>
<br><b>become harder to cope with.&nbsp; Until then I will keep asking
God' for his</b>
<br><b>forgiveness and mercy on my soul. "I am trying my best to Rebuke
the Devil</b>
<br><b>(Lucifer), in the name&nbsp; of Jesus."</b>

<p><b>No Problem Here</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jimeddie@prodigy.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've submitted before, and I've always gotten
an answer, which I do so appreciate.&nbsp; The advice I've been given has
really helped my fiancee and I handle what has been going on recently.&nbsp;
I'm not asking for help anymore, (though I do appreciate all that has been
received thus far :))&nbsp; But I am here to relate a few things that have
happened as of late.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I've mentioned before, my fiancee and I, and
my two children, daughter, 5 and son, 3 moved into this apartment in April
of 2000.&nbsp; We were very lucky to happen on to this place, as it fits
our current budget needs, though we do seem to be outgrowing the space
we have!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the first spot that all of us have been
able to call home, and we are very content to be here.&nbsp; I should first
of all explain that I live in an area of St. Paul, MN, on the Eastside
(borne and bred, thank you!), but I have never lived in the Mounds Park
area.&nbsp; I've done some research on the Web on our area, and the history
is just fascinating to say the least.&nbsp; For example, our home lies
just 1 block away from where ancient Indian burial mounds were once found.&nbsp;
Needless to say, they have been plowed under in the name of Progress.&nbsp;
But I don't really think that is what we are experiencing right now.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most nights when my children and I arrive home
(my fiancee works the afternoon shift, and doesn't come home until we all
are long fast asleep) we smell an aroma of spaghetti.&nbsp; Now I know
the other tenants, and none are usually home, or even cooking at this time.&nbsp;
But the smell is just wonderful.&nbsp; It reminds me of going to my grandparents
(dad's side) on a Sunday for a home-cooked meal when I was just a little
girl.&nbsp; My grandma (dad's side) was an Italian lady who could make
the most wonderful spaghetti/pasta dish you could sink your teeth into.&nbsp;
Maybe it's just a reminder of her.&nbsp; At any rate, I love it, and I
truly hope to experience more of the same!&nbsp; (It inspires me to cook
a home-made meal, which is something when you work full time!)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At any rate, to move on, my daughter the other
night went potty.&nbsp; No big thing.&nbsp; She turned off the bathroom
light and came into the bedroom to be tucked in and put to bed.&nbsp; The
prayers and kisses were done, I closed the door (partway, so the living
room lamp would still shine in for her to let her know mom was still knocking
around), and went to the living room to watch a little TV.&nbsp; I had
to go potty myself, and lo and behold, the bathroom light was on.&nbsp;
Now please understand, this is a very old house, and I can hear when the
kids get up to go to the bathroom.&nbsp; The floors are hardwood, and they
creak.&nbsp; I was thinking, allrighty then.&nbsp; A few more nights of
this, and I finally asked her if she had been going potty after I put her
to bed?&nbsp; She told me no, I thought it was you, mommy.&nbsp; Maybe
it's just my imagination, but there's other instances:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every morning, about 4am, my son's or my daughter's
musical books will go off.&nbsp; It is a touch-button type book, and yes
I do have cats, but please keep in mind they both are IN BED with my fiancee
and I when this happens.&nbsp; It's either Hickory-Dickory-Dock (my boy's)
or Silent Night (my daughter's).&nbsp; The kids aren't up, and I don't
get up for another hour or so.&nbsp; With the cats between my fiancee and
I, I don't know what to say.&nbsp; But it's kind of a wake up call.&nbsp;
Doesn't scare me, just reassures me that perhaps the other-worldly keeps
a schedule too.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We keep a nightlight in our bathroom for the
kids, in case they have to make the Midnight Run.&nbsp; Both my fiancee
and I have woken up and observed a shadow in the bathroom.&nbsp; Waited
a bit.&nbsp; When no one came out, I or he would go and investigate.&nbsp;
Nothing.&nbsp; Yes, once again it was not the cats.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know this is long, and I apologize for that.&nbsp;
There have been many, many other things that have occurred, but I shall
save that for another day.&nbsp; It's been reassuring to read all the stories
on your site.&nbsp; It helps to recognize that no, we are not crazy.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Weird Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: stewarthay@talk21.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Several years ago the following incident happened to me, I wonder
if you could explain it for me.</b>
<br><b>About 14 years ago I was lying in bed with my wife.&nbsp; We had
just retired to bed and were both totally sober/sane.&nbsp; We were both
lying reading when our 7 month old German Shepherd dog jumped onto our
bed.&nbsp; My immediately told the dog to get off the bed which he did.&nbsp;
When the dog finally lay down on his bed my wife said " GOOD BOY MAX THETAS
A GOOD BOY".&nbsp; At this time we were listening to the bedside radio
and a song called living doll by Cliff Richard was playing.&nbsp; About
five seconds later the radio went silent and a female voice came on the
radio and said the words "GOOD BOY MAX THATS A GOOD BOY"&nbsp; The voice
sounded like it was trying to imitate my wife's voice but in a mocking
nasty way.</b>
<br><b>I turned to my wife and by the look on her face I could tell that
she had heard what I had heard.(which she had).&nbsp; This never happened
again.</b>
<br><b>About one week later I had just gone to bed, my wife was already
asleep.&nbsp; As I was lying in bed trying to get to sleep I saw a figure
at the bottom of the bed standing there. I'm sure I was awake but who knows.&nbsp;
I decided to be rational about this presence which by this time was moving
closer to me.&nbsp; I remember thinking you don't scare me and when it
reached out towards me I thought OK I'm going to touch you because I know
you are not real and will go away.&nbsp; Ireached out and grabbed the hand
of this figure and to my horror it felt very real.&nbsp; I jumped up in
a panic and the figure was gone.</b>
<br><b>The only other episode happened about one month ago very similar.&nbsp;
I was in bed and awake (I think I was anyway who knows?).&nbsp; The figure
appeared at the bottom of my bed again.&nbsp; It might have been the samefigure
as the first time.&nbsp; It was similar.&nbsp; I was not scared and was
more prepared this time.&nbsp; I lay in bed watching this dark figure which
eventually walked round to my side of the bed closer to me.&nbsp; this
was a bit scary so I turned my back on the figure hoping it would go away.
When I turned round again it was still there.&nbsp; By this time I really
wanted it to go away so I turned my back to it again (out of sight and
out of mind).&nbsp; To my great surprise the damned thing started to blow
on my hair.&nbsp; I know it sounds weird but I swear Something was blowing
on my hair.&nbsp; I didn't turn round again till it stopped.&nbsp; When
I turned round it was gone.</b>

<br><b>I sit alone on the couch in my den petting our puppy Pochie and

<br><b>My Little Girl Sees Someone</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dat1girl@juno.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I just moved into this house not too long ago.&nbsp; There were 3
previous</b>
<br><b>owners.&nbsp; The first owner was an elderly couple, both dead.&nbsp;
After them,</b>
<br><b>there was another elderly couple, where the husband died but the
wife</b>
<br><b>still alive in a nursing home.&nbsp; The owner whom we bought the
house from</b>
<br><b>only lived here a year before selling it.&nbsp; Which makes it kinda
strange.</b>
<br><b>Why would someone sell a house after living in it for not even a
year?</b>
<br><b>Is it haunted???&nbsp; Well we liked the house and the price.&nbsp;
So we bought</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; The first week of living here, my daughter who was only
2 at the</b>
<br><b>time, waved and said "good-bye" to a corner down in the basement.</b>
<br><b>Strange but it was true.&nbsp; My husband was with her at the time.&nbsp;
They were</b>
<br><b>on their way upstairs from watching tv in the rec room.&nbsp; My
husband was</b>
<br><b>scared about what had happened.&nbsp; He immediately told me and
had my</b>
<br><b>daughter show us where she waved to.&nbsp; We didn't think much
of it because</b>
<br><b>she was only 2 and probably saying bye to her imaginary friend.&nbsp;
It's</b>
<br><b>been 4 months since that incident.&nbsp; Today at the age of 3,
she talks more</b>
<br><b>and has alot more vacabulary in her head.&nbsp; She started telling
us she</b>
<br><b>sees someone.&nbsp; It kinda scares us because she sees someone
in the same</b>
<br><b>corner and area as when we first moved here.&nbsp; She repeats it
over and</b>
<br><b>over "Mommy, I see someone."&nbsp; When we ask her where, she points
to the</b>
<br><b>same spot.&nbsp; Should I be concern?&nbsp; I mean little kids tend
to make things</b>
<br><b>up.&nbsp; But about her seeing someone?&nbsp; I think she might
be telling the</b>
<br><b>truth.</b>

<p><b>Truely Scared</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi&nbsp; i have an experience that i wish had never happend to me
for i was well</b>
<br><b>and truly SCARED.</b>
<br><b>It was about 3 years ago i was with a whole bunch of mates about
5-6 of us</b>
<br><b>and we used to go to an old football ground to play football and
when we</b>
<br><b>were going home about 3-4 in the afternoon we saw a house not to
far from</b>
<br><b>where we live that was old and looked abandoned so one night we
decided to</b>
<br><b>go there because we al thought it would be "cool" trust me it</b>
<br><b>wasnt..........</b>
<br><b>We got to the house about 8 oclock this was pitch black becuase
the clocks</b>
<br><b>had to go back 1 hour, we found an entrance to the house (oh by
the way</b>
<br><b>there were 3 people now not 6) around the back of the house behind
a very</b>
<br><b>easily moveable board and we slipped into the house we had brought
torches</b>
<br><b>and some of us had mobile phones (just in case) and we were searching
the</b>
<br><b>house top to bottom the house from the outside looked pretty small
but</b>
<br><b>inside it was rather big and it had long hallways and old pictures
and stuff</b>
<br><b>in the rooms when we were about to go out of the house we heard
a bang from</b>
<br><b>the upper floors of the house,we thought it was a mouse or rat or
something</b>
<br><b>and continued out of the house but when we got to the exit something
told me</b>
<br><b>to go back and not go outside so i suggested to go and have a look
at what</b>
<br><b>the bang was the other guys agreed and said they had thought of
the same</b>
<br><b>idea we got to the stairs and when we looked up we saw a faint shadow
or</b>
<br><b>outline of somebody we couldnt see properly because the figure was
walking</b>
<br><b>towards a door we only coaught a glimpse of it we looked at eachother
and</b>
<br><b>carried on going up the stairs and when we got to the top we heard
a</b>
<br><b>muttering or something that sounded very odd one of us said they
didnt want</b>
<br><b>to carry on and would go wait outside (i dont blame him) he went
downstairs</b>
<br><b>and we saw him running out of the premisis and we went through the
door we</b>
<br><b>saw the thing person whatever it was going through we went through
and</b>
<br><b>closed the door behind us,</b>
<br><b>it was a big bedroom and a dim light was on in a bathroom part and
we got</b>
<br><b>very scared and prepared to use physical damage if we had to we
turned off</b>
<br><b>the tourch and continued to the bathroom door we pushed it open
a tad and</b>
<br><b>nothing was in there but the light wasnt on when we saw it first
time we</b>
<br><b>searched the house, then i felt a pressence and swung round and
gave out a</b>
<br><b>pretty loud SHIT my mate turned round used a very different word
to me and</b>
<br><b>we began running out towards the door we came through though it
was stuck</b>
<br><b>and we couldnt open it we kicked it ramed it and even threw stuff
at it we</b>
<br><b>turned round and saw a person stood in the corner pointing at us
and walking</b>
<br><b>very very slowly towards us but it had no face and your could only
make out</b>
<br><b>the arm that was pointing at us it had no other features,we screamed
and</b>
<br><b>shouted and then we ran at the door and we opened it we ran down
the stairs</b>
<br><b>and out the entrance we came in as we got outside we met our other
friend</b>
<br><b>and he said what happend we didnt answer and carried on running
he followed</b>
<br><b>as we got a safe distance from the house we turned to see the bathroom
light</b>
<br><b>was still barely showing and somebody was watching us</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Encounter</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DRSWONDERING@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I don't know if u can call this a ghost story. But i had this encounter
with</b>
<br><b>super natural thing when i was 18 years old. That i feel the need
to tell you</b>
<br><b>about it. It was a week before my 18 th birthday and i was laying
in bed.</b>
<br><b>This women appears that looked my cousin that i was very close to.
That died</b>
<br><b>when she was 19 years old in a car crash. She drove this firebird
and when i</b>
<br><b>was 17 i bought myself a firebird. So anyways she appears in this
white see</b>
<br><b>through dress to warn me to not drive my car on my birthday. so
i took her</b>
<br><b>advice and didn't take it out that night. She never appeared to
me since then</b>
<br><b>and i'm 34 now. But the weridest thing about it&nbsp; four months
after my</b>
<br><b>birthday my younger sister took my car and totaled it. She was fine,
but the</b>
<br><b>car didn't make it. So what i'm saying is that i believe in ghosts
and</b>
<br><b>hauntings. I really think there are ghosts out there.... thank you

<br><b>for quite some time now. For several years.</b>
<br><b>And I love reading the stories, but seeing</b>
<br><b>as their are so many, I really want to</b>
<br><b>tell you all about my personal story. I hope</b>
<br><b>that all of you find this very true, and</b>
<br><b>somewhat entertaining. But overall its</b>
<br><b>a very true story. Please sit back and</b>
<br><b>enjoy.</b><b></b>
<p><b>One night after watching WWF Raw Is War.</b>
<br><b>Which was on a Monday Night. I decided I was tired and</b>
<br><b>I went off to bed. Well I am a person</b>
<br><b>that cant get to sleep easily.</b>
<br><b>Especially on this night. Well, to the</b>
<br><b>story. On this particular night, I was about to doze</b>
<br><b>off to sleep and for some reason I felt</b>
<br><b>as if someone pacing back and fourth on</b>
<br><b>top of me. My bed is located in the corner of the</b>
<br><b>room. And Their is a door to my left. Well in my room</b>
<br><b>it has some light coming from the outside window.</b>
<br><b>(This happened back in November of '99)</b>
<br><b>It felt and I was now wide awake I couldnt</b>
<br><b>move I was feeling trapped to my bed, and</b>
<br><b>I was like someone was walking through me</b>
<br><b>pacing back and fourth for about 20 MInutes.</b>
<br><b>This only happend once. It scared the crap out of me.</b>
<br><b>Although I didnt see anything, but I sure</b>
<br><b>felt it. Another story is I was watching TV about two</b>
<br><b>weeks later, and for some reason it shut off. I was</b>
<br><b>sitting on my bed. And it went off. I got up to look</b>
<br><b>for the Remote. I found nothing. This</b>
<br><b>happened very often. But on this night,</b>
<br><b>I had to keep on getting up to turn it back on.</b>
<br><b>If anyone has anything they can do to help or assist</b>
<br><b>my parents on this, (I have since moved out, and</b>
<br><b>Havent seen or felt anything in my new</b>

<br><b>My Room is Still Her's</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SAMBEANER1@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This is not very serious but i wanted to share it. I live in a house
that</b>
<br><b>isnt that old. The people that use to live here had a daughter who
was in</b>
<br><b>her</b>
<br><b>teens when she died. She was in a car without a seat belt and the
car was in</b>
<br><b>a crash and she flew out the window and died. My room use to be
hers and</b>
<br><b>somethings have happend. A few years ago when I was about 7 i was
in my room</b>
<br><b>and dropped a notebook suddenly the notebook pooped and jumped up
about 3</b>
<br><b>times then fell back down. Then i woke up and heard tapping on my
window.</b>
<br><b>There are no trees by it and i couldnt see anyone out of it but
i definitly</b>
<br><b>heard tapping. Then nothing happend until a few months ago i was
in bed- i</b>
<br><b>have a bunk bed and when u step on the ladder it makes a clunk sound.
Well i</b>
<br><b>was laying in bed watching T.V. and i heard a clunk and my bed shook
but</b>
<br><b>nothing was climbing up it. Then today i was looking at web pages
and i got</b>
<br><b>up when i came back they were gone and i thought i had did it. Then
later i</b>
<br><b>got up again because i heard a growl and my cat jumping out of the
bathroom</b>
<br><b>which is right next to my room. So i went to look and i came back
and the</b>
<br><b>web</b>
<br><b>pages were gone again. I think that the ghost may&nbsp; be the girl
who died.</b>

<br><b>My Live-In Spirits</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: c-p-enterprice@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>hello my name is arline and i live in north carolina and i rent an
old farm house.&nbsp; i've been told that the house is about 80 years old
or more.&nbsp; i really hope that when i get done with my story you will
give me your advise about how to tell if they want me out or are just trying
to let me know if they are there, and if that is the case, should i try
to ask them what they want from me.&nbsp; here is me story(experience).</b><b></b>
<p><b>well my daughter and i moved in not to long ago, my husband was put
out of town working so at the time it was just my daughter and i.&nbsp;
Well at first there was nothing but, then about the 2nd night we were there
while we (my daughter and i) were in bed i started to hear music.&nbsp;
well i blew it off as my imagination.&nbsp; Then every night i would start
to hear the music every night.&nbsp; But the wierd thing was that my daughter
would always be asleep.&nbsp; It never happens when she is awake.&nbsp;
She is now only 20 months old so i dont know if the spirit there doesnt
want to scare her or what. Well anyway as time goes on my husband comes
home, keep in mind he had never spent the night there yet.&nbsp; well i
never said anything to anyone because if it was spirits, they just seemed
to play music and chat at night.&nbsp; you could never make out what it
is they are syaing it just sounds like a room full of people chatting and
mingling.&nbsp; the music sounds like clasical music from back in the old
days.&nbsp; My husband was outside putting up a lawn mower cause it was
raining outside.&nbsp; Again my daughter was asleep, and he came running
around the house cussing and laughing.&nbsp; He said youre going to think
im crazy but when i was running with the lawn mower i heard someone say
WEEEEEEEEE.&nbsp; it scared him to death.&nbsp; Then we went back in the
house and i began to tell him of the things that i heard at night.&nbsp;
(this aslo accured at night).</b>
<br><b>Well i didnt hear the WEEEEEEEE that he heard.&nbsp; When we were
in the house i heard a woman laugh, and of course he didnt hear that well.&nbsp;
i got really spooked cause i heard the woman loud and clear.&nbsp; i know
that was not my imagination.&nbsp; so i went to the people who lived there
before me (they moved next door) and all i said was "did you guys ever
hear anything is that house?"&nbsp; and the lady began to tell me about
at night she could hear music and her husband was if the bathroom and turned
to the right and saw a woman in an old dress standing there.&nbsp; He asked
her what she wanted and she disappeared.&nbsp; we have experienced alot
more but it would take me all day.&nbsp; they have never touched or moved
aything in my house you can feel like someone is standing right on top
of you, or you can walk in the rooms and you can feel someone else in the
room with you.&nbsp; And of course hear voiced and music.&nbsp; Please
help me figure out what these spirits want or is it all in my head?</b>

<br><b>My Haunted Houses</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Goddesschic1014@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>ok this started a long time ago when my dad moved into a trailor.
i never</b>
<br><b>believed in ghosts before then but after&nbsp; having lived in that
house, the one</b>
<br><b>we moved into after it and the previous one i believe in ghosts.
when we</b>
<br><b>moved into the trailor i wasn't scared cause my brother was painting
my room</b>
<br><b>so i slept in the living room. the first night i stayed in my room,
my</b>
<br><b>sisters room is right next to mine, my sister kept comeing into
my room</b>
<br><b>telling me that she heard something and wanted to sleep with me.
that night i</b>
<br><b>didn't sleep. after that when my dad went to bed i would always
sneek into</b>
<br><b>the&nbsp; living room and sleep in there. we lived in that house
for about two</b>
<br><b>years and then my dad moved into his girlfriends house. i felt alot
better</b>
<br><b>that i wasn't staying in that house anymore.Then after a couple
of mothes me</b>
<br><b>and my friend were in the house alone and were watching t.v. the
flood lights</b>
<br><b>started blinking on and off but it didn't bother us. we just thought
it was</b>
<br><b>an electrical problem.&nbsp; we had a computer room with a lamp
that didn't work.</b>
<br><b>i don't remember if the light bulb had just burned out and we just
never</b>
<br><b>replaced it or what.after the flood lights stopped blinking the
lamp started</b>
<br><b>binking. it didn't scare us at first cause we just thought the light
bulb</b>
<br><b>just all of the sudden started working again but when me and val
got up to go</b>
<br><b>turn it off we noticed that the lamp wasn't even plugged in. my
stepmom told</b>
<br><b>me that the guy that lived there before had died and when he did
his family</b>
<br><b>kicked his wife out and sold it. she told me that before we moved
in she</b>
<br><b>would come home from work and things would have move and the t.v.
and stereo</b>
<br><b>would be on. i could never sleep in that house after me and val
saw the</b>
<br><b>lights blinking. even scarier, one night me, val, and my step mom
were</b>
<br><b>outside in the hot tub, a section of the yard was fenced off for
our puppy</b>
<br><b>and we started seeing lights shine out if the fence onto us. we
thought it</b>
<br><b>was my dad and brother playin a joke on us and when val went inside
to catch</b>
<br><b>them they were watching t.v. we told them what we saw and they laughed
at us</b>
<br><b>and said it was probably some kids. but it wasn't because we looked
over the</b>
<br><b>fence a couple of times to see if it was them and we wouldn't see
anyone. one</b>
<br><b>night when i was trying to go to sleep my closet door opened and
i saw</b>
<br><b>something out of the corner of my eye. i would always here someone
walking</b>
<br><b>down the hall and call my dads name cause i thought it was him and
i would</b>
<br><b>wait for him to come but no one was ever there.toilets would flush
on their</b>
<br><b>own and the bathroom door would always open when we were trying
to sleep. we</b>
<br><b>finally moved outof that house and now a family lives there. the
house i am</b>
<br><b>living in now is haunted i think because whenever i am down stairs
i</b>
<br><b>sometimes here someone walking around upstairs. instead of a door
i put beads</b>
<br><b>up in my room and one morning when my friends were over i woke up
really</b>
<br><b>early and i heard my beads moving. i always hear everything in my
room. one</b>
<br><b>night i was sleeping and i woke up in the middle of the night and
i heard a</b>
<br><b>big bang from inside my closet. we have a big hall closet and the
door would</b>
<br><b>always open, we never saw it open until my sister told me that she
always</b>
<br><b>closing it and when she comes back later it is open. i told her
that there</b>
<br><b>weren't any ghosts and right when i said that we saw the door open.
and one</b>
<br><b>night i heard something scratching on the door. i don't sleep in
my room that</b>
<br><b>much anymore. i mostly just sleep downstairs in our livingroom.</b>
