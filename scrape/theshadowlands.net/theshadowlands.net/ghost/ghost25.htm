</H3><P><B>by name with held by request</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am a Current serving Police Officer and joined a local force in 1975.

</B>
<P><B> Sometime shortly after that time, I was on night duty woring with
</B>
<P><B>another officer who was responsible for basically showing me the ropes.

</B>
<P><B> We were in the Police canteen one morning sometime around 1.30am when

</B>
<P><B>we received a call to go to a disturbance some 1 mile from the station.

</B>
<P><B>En route to the disturbance we were flagged down by a man who was very

</B>
<P><B>large in build, he really looked as though he could handle himself.
 He </B>
<P><B>was obviously very distressed and begged us to go to a nearby house.
 I </B>
<P><B>can remember this man was driving an old VW Beetle. I seem to remember

</B>
<P><B>that he was dressed only in underclothing and possible wearing a </B>
<P><B>dressing gown.  We tried to tell this man that we were on our way to
a </B>
<P><B>disturbance but his needs appeared to be greater.  He took us to a
house </B>
<P><B>nearby and was saying something to the effect that something strange
had </B>
<P><B>happened to his daughter.  The story continues that this man had been
a </B>
<P><B>former serving soldier in Northern Irelanda and had just left the </B>
<P><B>services and settled into this house with his wife.  I seem to remember

</B>
<P><B>that his brother in law was also staying at the house.  He stated that

</B>
<P><B>he had a large alsation dog also in the house.  The man stated that
all </B>
<P><B>three had been out for a drink that evening and had left a babysitter
in </B>
<P><B>charge of his daughter who was just a babe in arms.  The adults had
</B>
<P><B>returned to the houseabout 12midnight, took the babysitter home and
</B>
<P><B>returned.  They were watching a programme on the TV called the 'Baron',

</B>
<P><B>when they heard something being dragged across the bedroom floor </B>
<P><B>directly above them.  No carpets were on the floor and the babys cot
was </B>
<P><B>in this room.  They then heard the sound of the baby crying.  The mans

</B>
<P><B>wife started to panick thinking someone had broken in and was taking
the </B>
<P><B>baby.  The Husband tried to open the door from the main room to the
hall </B>
<P><B>this giving access to the stairs then to the bedrooms.  They could
not </B>
<P><B>open this door.  Someone had grabbed hold of a small axe from a </B>
<P><B>downstairs room to try and get the door opened.  The male told me that

</B>
<P><B>he then heard footsteps coming downstairs, the baby still crying and
a </B>
<P><B>female voice saying something similar to "HUSH DONT CRY".  The adults

</B>
<P><B>tried to open the door and eventually managed to force it open.  They

</B>
<P><B>got the dog and threw the dog into the hallway thinking that it would

</B>
<P><B>attack the person whom they thought had broken into the house.  The
dog </B>
<P><B>bit its owner on the hand and ran out through the front door into the

</B>
<P><B>street.  Both males went upstairs and saw that the cot was in the middle

</B>
<P><B>of the floor with the baby still in it but awake.  They grabbed the
baby </B>
<P><B>left the house, I think in two cars, the husband in one and his brother

</B>
<P><B>in law, wife and child in the other.  This is when the male in the
VW </B>
<P><B>came acroos us travelling to the disturbance.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I entered the house and saw the door badly damaged as he had stated,
</B>
<P><B>there were a number of bottles of empty beer on the table, but I didnt

</B>
<P><B>think this man was drunk.  I searched upstairs and sure enough the
cot </B>
<P><B>was in the middle of the room.  My collegue searched downstairs.  No
</B>
<P><B>Sign of a forced entry.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We were in a the divisional van a Ford Transit which was parked with
its </B>
<P><B>offside, (Drivers) side to this house which is situated in a small
Cul </B>
<P><B>de Sac.  My collegue turned the van around so that its nearside </B>
<P><B>(passengers) was now opposite the house.  I was taking the mans details

</B>
<P><B>in my pocket book.  I asked him if he had fully secured the house,
he </B>
<P><B>said Yes apart from a small downstairs window measuring some 3' x 18",
I </B>
<P><B>walked down the path and released the stay from the outside allowing
the </B>
<P><B>window to close.  Returned to the man and he gave me an address of
a </B>
<P><B>relative nearbye that he was staying with.  As we were about to leave,
I </B>
<P><B>looked up at the bedroom window that had contained the cot, saw the
</B>
<P><B>netcurtain move and the face of an elderly lady appeared. She was </B>
<P><B>wearing glasses and had her hair tied in a bun on the top of her head.

 </B>
<P><B>I looked at her for some 10 seconds as did the male.  He became very
</B>
<P><B>frightened got in his car and drove away.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is the only thing that has really happened  to me in 23 years
as a </B>
<P><B>Police Officer.  I felt very nervous about it.  The house is still
</B>
<P><B>standing to this day and is in the North West of the UK.</B>

<H3><A NAME=zama>More Camp Zama Ghosts</A>
</H3><P><B>by DEJA@prodigy.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I read the experience sent in by the assistant chaplain who was</B>
<P><B>stationed at Camp Zama Japan during the 1980's, and felt the need to</B>
<P><B>share some experiences while I lived there from 1987 to 1994.  I

lived</B>
<P><B>at Sagamihara housing base and worked at 69th Finance at Camp Zama.
</B>
<P><B>Before I tell you the "scarey stuff", I will start  with the slightly</B>
<P><B>weird.  Several times while at work by myself, I would get the feeling

I</B>
<P><B>was not alone, but not being able to see anyone or thing I would just</B>
<P><B>think to myself, that I was just imagining things and would finish
my</B>
<P><B>work and get out of the building as soon as possible.  On several</B>
<P><B>occaisions, I did see some one walk by the open door and thinking

that</B>
<P><B>it was my assistant who came in early like me, I would wonder why he</B>
<P><B>didn't come in.  Each time I got up to investigate, there would be
no</B>
<P><B>one in the building.  There was no way anyone could get out of the</B>
<P><B>building unseen, because they would have to walk back past my door.
</B>
<P><B>This never really scared me at the time, but I always wondered how

they</B>
<P><B>did it, and who it was.  It wasn't until about 1992 that I had heard</B>
<P><B>about the history of others seeing apparitions of sorts, so I'm sure

it</B>
<P><B>wasn't just my over active imagination.  The only time I was ever

really</B>
<P><B>scared was when I was at home.  I had to quit sleeping in my bedroom,</B>
<P><B>because of all the terrifying activity going on day and night. I was</B>
<P><B>seriusly thinking about getting psychiatric help, but I kept telling</B>
<P><B>myself it wasn't real and since I knew it wasn' real, I probably

wasn't</B>
<P><B>too far gone.   I don't know how many times I was awakened from a

sound</B>
<P><B>sleep, because I could feel something sit down on my bed.  I had a

water</B>
<P><B>bed and I could actually see the imprint of something sitting there,

and</B>
<P><B>the mattress would move and the water would slosh, and I would be up

and</B>
<P><B>out of there. It didn't happen every night and even though I knew what

I</B>
<P><B>saw, I didn't let it get to me until I started waking up to some type

of</B>
<P><B>entity physically on top of me.  It was so horrible I can't even say</B>
<P><B>what it was doing to me.  I wouldn't be able to move or speak until

it</B>
<P><B>was done with me.  I kept telling myself it had to be a dream, even</B>
<P><B>though I know I was awake.  I read everything I could find on this</B>
<P><B>subject and most people say that all it could be is a dream.  I read

a</B>
<P><B>book entitled "The Entity", and this was the exact phenomena that I</B>
<P><B>experienced.  I suffered in silence for a long time, because I just</B>
<P><B>couldn't believe it was real.  Until now I have only told two people,

my</B>
<P><B>best friend and her son who is a minister.  He told me that the next</B>
<P><B>time it happened, that I should pray to God for help and to tell the</B>
<P><B>spirit "In the name of God, leave and never return".  I did just

that,</B>
<P><B>and after doing this several times, it finally stopped.  Even though

I</B>
<P><B>couldn't speak, I just thought these words as hard as I could.  I

have</B>
<P><B>experienced quite a few strange occurances in my life, but nothing
so</B>
<P><B>physical and invading as what I experienced while I was in Japan.

 Since</B>
<P><B>then I have read quite a bit on the subject of ghosts and I have come

to</B>
<P><B>the conclusion that I had inadvertantly invited my unfriendly visitor

by</B>
<P><B>playing with ouigi boards when I was a teenager.  I still sometimes</B>
<P><B>wonder if I'm crazy, but I swear what I experienced seemed too real

for</B>
<P><B>it all to be a dream.</B>

<H3><A NAME=japan>A Military Base in Japan</A>
</H3><P><B>by "Daisy"</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi.  I'm a military wife living on a Marine base in Okinawa, Japan.

 We</B>
<P><B>have lived in our present apartment for 2 1/2 years and have

experienced</B>
<P><B>a few "weird" things.  It began with the all so common doors slamming</B>
<P><B>and opening.  And moved to something more real.  My husband is a</B>
<P><B>skeptic...a have to see it to believe it kind of person.  Well, we

heard</B>
<P><B>something together one night that we can't explain.  I had put our

three</B>
<P><B>small children to bed and shut all of the bedroom doors and door to

the</B>
<P><B>living area.  Our living area couch faces away from that door.  My</B>
<P><B>husband and I were sitting there watching a movie when about 15

minutes</B>
<P><B>later we heard the door knob rattle and the door open.  Then we heard</B>
<P><B>our 3 1/2 year old daughter timidly call out,"Mommy?"  Well, I tossed

my</B>
<P><B>hands up in the air and preceded to scold her for getting out of bed.

 I</B>
<P><B>turned to find the doorway empty. So I got up expecting to find her</B>
<P><B>behind the door or scurrying down the hallway, but instead found an</B>
<P><B>empty hallway and all of the doors shut.  So I checked her room to

find</B>
<P><B>her snoozing heavily tucked into her bed as was the other two children.

</B>
<P><B>Seriously confused I walked into the living area to ask my husband
if he</B>
<P><B>just heard something.  He asked,"What?  You mean "Lisa" calling your</B>
<P><B>name?"  Neither one of us knew what to make of that.  After that on</B>
<P><B>occasion I would see the reflection of something moving behind me in

the</B>
<P><B>steel cabinet in my kitchen.  I would turn around expecting to find

my</B>
<P><B>husband or one of the kids, but instead found nothing.  I would hear

my</B>
<P><B>daughter calling "Mommy" from a few a feet away when she wasn't even

in</B>
<P><B>the room or in the apartment.  The strangest experience was when my</B>
<P><B>husband and I were up watching Letterman and from across the room (20</B>
<P><B>feet) I could see what appeared to be a shadow standing in THE MIDDLE

of</B>
<P><B>the floor.  It was a little girl swinging her arms back and forth.
 It</B>
<P><B>lasted about 4-5 seconds.  I was so shocked I couldn't move or say</B>
<P><B>anything to bring my husband's attention to it.  Then he noticed my</B>
<P><B>fright and started asking me what it was.  Right as he started to

look</B>
<P><B>in the direction of the girl the "shadow" seemed to just jump up into

a</B>
<P><B>cloud mass and back down into the lamp.  I have seen a very brief</B>
<P><B>glimpse of a child in a wall mirror that is positioned at eye level

for</B>
<P><B>me. (5'3")  Just last weekend at a USO on a different base as I

filled</B>
<P><B>soda cups for all of us a little girl appeared to run very quickly</B>
<P><B>behind me.  I assumed it was my daughter "Lisa".  So I looked around

the</B>
<P><B>corner to find her sitting with the family.  I went back to the soda</B>
<P><B>machine and it happened twice more.  I don't know what to make of it.

</B>
<P><B>Is it a ghost?  Is it a projection of my daughter's "spirit"?  She
has a</B>
<P><B>very strong personality.  I just don't know.  I don't get any "evil"</B>
<P><B>feelings from whatever it is.  But it's strange nonetheless.</B>

<H3><A NAME=something>Something...</A>
</H3><P><B>by name withheld by request</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi,</B>
<P><B>	I do not have a story to tell but I do have some experiences.  But</B>
<P><B>that's not why I'm writing to you.  I just wanted to tell you how

much</B>
<P><B>I've enjoyed you page. Reading some of these stories have made my life

a</B>
<P><B>little bit easier.  I have "something" residing in my house, and at</B>
<P><B>first I have been deathly afraid of it (the unknown).  It hasn't

tried</B>
<P><B>to harm us or anything.  It has pulled a couple of pranks that trully</B>
<P><B>upset the family, but I don't think it meant any harm.  The first

time</B>
<P><B>was an envelope of money.  I tore that house apart (litterally),

looking</B>
<P><B>for that money.  I quit for the evening because I was tired and upset.

</B>
<P><B>This was all the money we had for a week.  The next morning we got

up,</B>
<P><B>tended to the baby.  While my husband sat in the recliner rocking the</B>
<P><B>baby I started searching again.  Still couldn't find the money.  I</B>
<P><B>started to cry.  My husband got up and put the baby in the cradle.

 When</B>
<P><B>we went back to the chair the envelope was sitting there.  It was not</B>
<P><B>there before he sat down.  I searched everywhere.  I sat in that

chair</B>
<P><B>the night before.  The second thing that happened was my husband's

keys</B>
<P><B>turned up missing.  Again we tore the house apart.  We couldn't find</B>
<P><B>them.  We finally had to broke down and call a locksmith to come and</B>
<P><B>make new keys to my husband's car.  We were really stressing the keys</B>
<P><B>because the gun cabinet key was on it and we only had one key.  This</B>
<P><B>meant we would have to have someone come out and drill the locks and

put</B>
<P><B>new locks in.  Expensive job as far as I'm concern.  Anyway, one day</B>
<P><B>some magnets and papers fell off the refrigarator and my son went to</B>
<P><B>pick these things up off the floor.  One of the magnets landed (I

don't</B>
<P><B>know how, it must of bounced or something) under the frig.  When my

son</B>
<P><B>reached under the frig he found the magnet and my husbands keys.  The</B>
<P><B>third thing happends quite alot.  My baby is almost 8 months old.

 When</B>
<P><B>getting him ready to go to bed at night I usually lay him on the bed

to</B>
<P><B>get him ready.  (This is really neat) My baby stares straight up at

the</B>
<P><B>ceiling and laughs (like someone is playing with him).  He does this</B>
<P><B>anywhere from 10 minutes to 20 minutes or until I grab him and start</B>
<P><B>putting him to sleep.  There is also a spot on the wall he watches

with</B>
<P><B>fasination and does the same kind of laughing.  What ever it is I

thank</B>
<P><B>it for keeping him occupied.  Sometimes I'm so exhausted it's hard</B>
<P><B>keeping up with the little rascal so even 5 minutes reprive is</B>
<P><B>appreciated.  I know it's a kind spirit and doesn't mean any harm.
</B>
<P><B>After reading some of your stories it made me realize that I don't

have</B>
<P><B>anything to fear.  </B>

<H3><A NAME=strange>Strange Presence</A>
</H3><P><B>by Cegarnets@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>It sounded interesting to share my experiences with ghosts with someone

that has experienced them before. For as long as I can remember there has
always been a strange presence in my house. I have lived here all my life,
16 yrs, and my parents have lived her for 24 yrs. In my house there is always
a presence that is watching you and you can sometimes sense it right next
to you. Being alone in my house is a bad mistake. </B>
<P><B>       Usually I am not comfortale staying here alone since something
I heard a huge bang noise. I am so used to strange noises and strange occurances

I usually ignore them. But this time I couldn't. It was a decent day outside,
I was home alone walking through my living room. It sounded like a huge tree

smashed into the back of my house sideways, while normally a tree would fall
on top. I was so scared I was afraid to look into the back yard. The sound
shook the whole house and I thought it broke all the windows in the back
of my house. It was so bad a screen fell off the window in the front of the

house. Finally I went into the hallway and looked around. Nothing. I went
into the back yard, nothing. The rest of that day I was jumpy. That night
the house was unusually quite.</B>
<P><B>      My house is a very small country house in a small private community

on a candlewood lake in new milford connecticut. Another example with my
house was when one of my friends was over my house and we were in the kitchen

getting something to eat. There is this hand made large wooden antique spoon
on the wall in my kitchen. We turned around to go out of the kitchen, when
we heard something loud fall on the floor behind us. It was the spoon. My
friend started freaking out because it went about ten feet. </B>
<P><B>         My brother also claims that he sees strange figures follow
him around the house. A couple times strange people have also shown up in
some of our pictures. Every night I also hear voices whispering every night.
I have grown so used to it I just ignore it, but when some of my friends
sleep over they hear it and freak out. One of my friends that was also so
scared she stayed awake the whole night and couldn't move. The list can keep
on going. Just thought that you might find this interesting. Hope you enjoyed
it. </B>

<H3><A NAME=white>The Lady In White</A>
</H3><P><B>by kclemons@conc.tds.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Whenever I would hear of someone living in a haunted house I </B>
<P><B>always thought the house had to be at least one hundred years old and

</B>
<P><B>very run down. I know better than that now.</B>
<P><B>     In the seventy's my husband and I moved into a nice little house
in a </B>
<P><B>small Tennessee town. For about the first six months it was our dream

</B>
<P><B>house. But then strange things started to happen. When we were in the

</B>
<P><B>kitchen the t.v. in the living room would change channels. Sometimes
</B>
<P><B>the knobs would fly off the t.v. and land in the floor on the other
side of </B>
<P><B>the room. If we were in the living room we would sometimes hear the
</B>
<P><B>kitchen cabinet doors open and close. Every time we were in the </B>
<P><B>bathroom and sat down on the tolit the light would go out. Stand up
and </B>
<P><B>the light would come back on. That was the only comical thing about
</B>
<P><B>that house. Things started to disapear around the house. At first we
</B>
<P><B>thought that some of the neighbor hood kids were breaking into our
</B>
<P><B>house when we were gone.. My husband nailed the windows shut from </B>
<P><B>the inside.That seemed to solve our problem for a little while. About

</B>
<P><B>three weeks later we took the kids and spent the day with their </B>
<P><B>grandmother. When we returned later that day what we saw was really
</B>
<P><B>horrible. Everything we owned,food,clothes,furniture,toys, everything

</B>
<P><B>was in a pile in our living room floor. Our windows were still nailed
from </B>
<P><B>the inside and the doors were locked. That night my husband woke me
</B>
<P><B>up in the middle of the night. Standing at the foot of our bed was
what </B>
<P><B>looked like a little old woman in a white night gown. She vanished
a </B>
<P><B>second or two later. The next day we did some research into the

house.</B>
<P><B>We discovered that the last owner had died in the room where we </B>
<P><B>sleep. We put the house back on the market a short time later and </B>
<P><B>moved to another town. One week later our dream house burned to the
</B>
<P><B>ground due to faulty wiring. I will always believe that she ran us
away to </B>
<P><B>save our lives and I thank her.</B>

<H3><A NAME=angela>Angela</A>
</H3><P><B>by kelpie@erols.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>In 1992 I moved to a civil war era row house in Richmond, VA.  I knew
</B>
<P><B>from the begining that something was unusual about the place.  My </B>
<P><B>roomates and I would always feel a preseance, like something watching
</B>
<P><B>us.  It took about a year or so to find out what it was.  One night,
my </B>
<P><B>roomate Josh and I were sitting in our kitchen/den.  My attention kept
</B>
<P><B>being drawn to the corner of the room by the back door.  Josh was </B>
<P><B>sitting by the back door and turned to see what I was looking at...
and </B>
<P><B>did a double-take.  Even though I couldn't see anything, he swore that
</B>
<P><B>he did.  He couldn't describe it but there was deffinately something
</B>
<P><B>there.  Over the period of the next week... I tried to contact whatever
</B>
<P><B>was in our house (this is not new or unusual for me... I've been talking
</B>
<P><B>to spirits for about 15 years).  The spirit began to appear to me as
</B>
<P><B>well.  At first it just a shapeless mist but gradualy took on the form
</B>
<P><B>of a teenage girl, dressed in civil war period cloathing.  When I spoke
</B>
<P><B>to her she was as relieved as I was.  Her name was Angela and no one
had </B>
<P><B>spoken to her in about 20 years.  The last people to inhabit our house
</B>
<P><B>were totaly unaware of her preseance.  She had died in that house when
</B>
<P><B>she was 16 but wouldn't tell me how or why she didn't travel on to
the </B>
<P><B>other side.  She and I grew very attached to each other.  We talked
</B>
<P><B>often and watched TV together.  Sometimes she would even lie in bed
with </B>
<P><B>me as while I slept.  The thing she liked to do the most was read.
 Of </B>
<P><B>course, having no physical arms, she couldn't hold a book or turn the
</B>
<P><B>pages.  So I would ask her what types of things she wanted to read
and </B>
<P><B>then go out and get books of that type.  Then we would read them </B>
<P><B>together, her reading over my shoulder.  After a while my financial
got </B>
<P><B>pretty bad.  I ended up having to move out of the house.  Angela and
I </B>
<P><B>where both very saddened by this.  I offered to try and find some way
to </B>
<P><B>take her with me, but she said that she had to stay there.  Eventualy
I </B>
<P><B>had to leave Richmond all together.  Now, often at night, I will think
</B>
<P><B>about her and allow my awareness to drift back to the old row house
</B>
<P><B>where I used to live.  I can feel that she is still there, and I know
</B>
<P><B>that she can still feel me as well.  We smile at each other across
the </B>
<P><B>miles.  I hope that she accomplishes whatever it is that she feels
she </B>
<P><B>has to do before moving on to the other side.  And I hope that when
I </B>
<P><B>take that journey, that she is there waiting for me.</B>

<H3><A NAME=one>One Too Many Encounters</A>
</H3><P><B>by pathologist@hotmail.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I believe I had lived with numerous spirits up until about 4 years
ago.  I am</B>
<P><B>now 20 and live with my grandmother, aunt, parents and younger sister.
 We just</B>
<P><B>recently moved here, but I was away at college for the past year and
a half.</B>
<P>
<P><B>During the first 2 1/2 years of my life, which I don't remember, me
my parents</B>
<P><B>and my 3 other siblings lived in a very small one story house.  My
mother has</B>
<P><B>told me that in that house there was the spirit of an old sailor who
used to</B>
<P><B>hit her and leave bruises on her arms whenever she went to do laundry.
 She</B>
<P><B>also said there was a lady spirit who left the smell of lavender
perfume</B>
<P><B>wherever she was, and that this female spirit would sing my oldest
sister to</B>
<P><B>sleep at night.  My mother also told me that this lady got rid of the
sailor</B>
<P><B>one night in a fit of flying pots and pans.  I have no recollection
of this</B>
<P><B>time period, so I am not wholly a believer in what my mother says.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I do remember my experiences starting around the time I was 4 or 5.
 One night</B>
<P><B>I was sitting in the living room watching tv with my mother.  From
the living</B>
<P><B>room walking towards the back of the house is the dining room converted
into a</B>
<P><B>weight room.  Adjacent to that was my second oldest sister's room with
the</B>
<P><B>doorway covered by a sheet.  (There are no doors to rooms in the house
except</B>
<P><B>to my parents' room and the two bathrooms)  As I was watching tv I
happened to</B>
<P><B>look out into the dining room and saw a lady dressed in a wedding type
gown</B>
<P><B>glide across the room and enter my sister's room.  The woman's skin
was also</B>
<P><B>white along with her hair.  As she entered my sister's room the sheet
covering</B>
<P><B>the doorway moved slightly.  I got up to investigate, but there wasn't
anyone</B>
<P><B>in the room.  My mother didn't see anyone, but years later told me
that the</B>
<P><B>spirit of a murdered bride was stuck in our house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Off to the left of the weight room is another room we call the green
dining</B>
<P><B>room, and adjacent to that room is our kitchen that has a door leading
out to</B>
<P><B>the backyard.  Adjacent to the kitchen is our bathroom.  Another time
(the only</B>
<P><B>time I had a witness to one of my experiences) my sister and I were
sitting</B>
<P><B>watching tv during the day in the living room.  We both heard footsteps
as</B>
<P><B>though my father was coming in from the kitchen.  They stopped by the
weight</B>
<P><B>room doorway entrance to the living room.  Then we both saw an image
of our</B>
<P><B>father standing at the doorway looking in on us.  I saw what appeared
to be a</B>
<P><B>photo negative of my father, when my sister said she saw a shadow figure
of my</B>
<P><B>father.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another incident (a quite embarrassing time) happened one night while
I was</B>
<P><B>going to bathroom.  I had left the door partway open because it was
only me, my</B>
<P><B>sister and my father at home.  So if you were to look up you could
see into the</B>
<P><B>kitchen between the door and the doorframe.  I had been in the bathroom
for</B>
<P><B>about 10 minutes when I happened to look up and into the kitchen. 
The shadow</B>
<P><B>of a young boy passed by quickly and I thought maybe it was my sister
and I</B>
<P><B>wasn't seeing things too well.  I called her name, but she didn't answer.
 Then</B>
<P><B>it sounded as if the doorknob had been taken hold of.  I didn't wait
to see</B>
<P><B>what was going to happen next, I started to scream my sister's name
at the top</B>
<P><B>of my lungs until she came in.  She thought I was going to die or
something</B>
<P><B>that is how terrified I sounded.  I even freaked out my dad.  My sister
told me</B>
<P><B>that she was just about to enter the kitchen when I started screaming
her name.</B>
<P><B> My mother had told me previously to this incident that there was the
spirit of</B>
<P><B>a little boy who liked to slam the bathroom door shut if you left it
open just</B>
<P><B>a little bit.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Also many times I would see people out of the corner of my eye, but
when I</B>
<P><B>would turn they would disappear.  I would hear my name being called
when there</B>
<P><B>was no one there.  I constantly heard the back door opening and
someone</B>
<P><B>entering the house, but there was never anyone there.  One time I was
so</B>
<P><B>convinced someone had come in (I always locked the door when I got
home) that I</B>
<P><B>grabbed my brother's baseball bat from upstairs and went downstairs
to</B>
<P><B>investigate.  When I got to the kitchen after searching the rest of
the house I</B>
<P><B>found the door to still be locked.  I saw someone resembling my brother
run</B>
<P><B>down the driveway, but when I went outside there was no one there.
 I even ran</B>
<P><B>to the front of the house to look out the windows, and there was no
one in</B>
<P><B>sight.  My brother came home about an hour later directly from school.
 I just</B>
<P><B>hated being a latchkey kid.</B>

<H3><A NAME=sam>Sam</A>
</H3><P><B>by Dani@Lucking.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello.  I wanted to tell you about how I grew up in a haunted</B>
<P><B>house.  My parents moved there before I was born and still live in
the</B>
<P><B>same house.  My mother hears doors close all day long, though no
doors</B>
<P><B>will actually be closed.  She hears lots of strange things.  I will
feel</B>
<P><B>a presence in the house.  I don't know if there is one spirit or
many.</B>
<P><B>I have felt things touching me.  Sometimes they would feel like
hands,</B>
<P><B>but sometimes it would be almost like a bar, cylindrical and kind of</B>
<P><B>heavy.  I would not always be asleep when I felt these.  At least
once</B>
<P><B>that I remember, I was in the den watching tv when I felt the bar
move</B>
<P><B>along my leg, like it was rolling slowly back and forth.  We also
have</B>
<P><B>had the "corner of the eye" sightings, but never anything really</B>
<P><B>material.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I came to call the ghost Sam, mostly because I didn't know anyone by
</B>
<P><B>that name.  One time I was falling asleep when I heard a stack of my</B>
<P><B>papers crash to the floor.  I said "Sam, I didn't do that, and I'm
not</B>
<P><B>picking it up."  Then I fell asleep.  In the morning, there were no</B>
<P><B>papers on the floor.  Sam seemed to just make noises mostly.  Our</B>
<P><B>kitchen</B>
<P><B>had a tile countertop and we used plastic glasses.  The sound of
those</B>
<P><B>glasses moving across the counter is unmistakable, and can be heard
</B>
<P><B>through the house, especially when everything is quiet.  At night,
</B>
<P><B>even though I knew no one was up, I could hear glasses go across the</B>
<P><B>counter and kitchen chairs being moved on the kitchen floor.  My
parents</B>
<P><B>both heard the distinct sounds of the wood burning stove being
opened,</B>
<P><B>the poker being moved from the holder, the fire being poked, the
poker</B>
<P><B>replaced, and the door being shut back.  All these things are very
very</B>
<P><B>distinctive sounds.  My parents are educated, logical people, but
they</B>
<P><B>both heard it.  They thought I had snuck up to watch tv, but they</B>
<P><B>checked</B>
<P><B>and I was sound asleep.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Even people we haven't told any stories to would comment on feeling
</B>
<P><B>creepy in the basement.  Like at my sister's sleepovers.  There were</B>
<P><B>too many girls for everyone to sleep upstairs, so they all had
sleeping</B>
<P><B>bags downstairs.  Without even starting ghost stories, they commented</B>
<P><B>on feeling something down there.  I don't think Sam is evil at all.</B>
<P><B>If I was at home alone and scared of the noises in the house, I would</B>
<P><B>tell Sam I was scared to be alone and ask him not to scare me with
any</B>
<P><B>strange noises.  I wouldn't hear any all night.  I am not sure,
however</B>
<P><B>that he was the only ghost.  I would definately feel threatened and</B>
<P><B>frightened at times.  I could feel a presence and maybe I overreacted</B>
<P><B>to the feeling and felt threatened. </B>
<P>
<P><B>One time I was awakened from a deep sleep by pressure on my shoulders
</B>
<P><B>and at my side.  It was as if a dog were standing over me.  I thought</B>
<P><B>that my old dog had finally died and was saying goodbye, but I was</B>
<P><B>terrified.  I tried to cry out, but couldn't.  When I finally could</B>
<P><B>get an audible squeek out for my mother, it went away immediately.
 My</B>
<P><B>dog was still alive.  I don't know what it was.  I don't know what</B>
<P><B>"gifts" I have in the way of the supernatural.  I have dreams that
come</B>
<P><B>true, I sometimes know things I have no way of knowing, and I feel</B>
<P><B>certain presences occasionally.  They make me uneasy and I wish that</B>
<P><B>I could either not feel them or feel at ease with them.  I knew there</B>
<P><B>was something in my house and was sensitive to that.  Ouija boards
and</B>
<P><B>movies like the Amityville Horror terrified me.  My sister used an</B>
<P><B>Ouija board in my room once and I never wanted to touch one again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am talking to my mother now about our house ghost.  She said that
she</B>
<P><B>has also felt things touch her, especially in bed at night.  We both</B>
<P><B>have felt things move on the bed.  She said that she has felt like
there</B>
<P><B>was someone on top, keeping her from getting up.  She says she still</B>
<P><B>hears things, but they are always at the other end of the house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My sister says she has never had any experiences and she thinks that</B>
<P><B>maybe I am making it up.  Not like a lie, but like a hypochondriac
can</B>
<P><B>really make themselves sick.  I told her that I think I am just more</B>
<P><B>sensitive to these things.  I find it unlikely that my mother and I
</B>
<P><B>would make up the same kinds of experiences separately.  We never</B>
<P><B>discussed them until I was older and never really talked about them</B>
<P><B>much at all.  I didn't know until tonight that she felt pressures</B>
<P><B>holding her down in bed.  My sister did say that she had felt
pressures,</B>
<P><B>but not necessarily just at my parent's house.  She considers it a</B>
<P><B>freaky nerve thing.  Her body, rather than her mind, playing tricks</B>
<P><B>on her.  She never considered the possiblity of a supernatural </B>
<P><B>explaination for it.  I conceeded to her that the pressures could
just</B>
<P><B>be a nerve reaction of some kind, but the sounds went on for years.</B>
<P><B>I even discarded a lot of the shapes I would see in the hall outside</B>
<P><B>my door as being due to the the unclearness of night vision and</B>
<P><B>childhood</B>
<P><B>imagination.  But that doesn't explain the happenings when I was a</B>
<P><B>teenager and awake in broad daylight.  Anyway, thanks for your time.</B>

<H3><A NAME=old>The Old Farmhouse</A>
</H3><P><B>by gardener@oricom.ca</B>
<P>
<P><B>You want ghost stories, and I have a couple of them, from personal</B>
<P><B>experiences, but for now, I'll tell you one of them that still haunts</B>
<P><B>me.</B>
<P><B>  The setting is an old farmhouse near Campbellford, Ontario, Canada.
It</B>
<P><B>took place in December of 1982, while I was working with a friend
there,</B>
<P><B>looking after poultry, sheep and goats.The owner was a book-keeper
for a</B>
<P><B>Toronto firm, and had hired us to stay on his hobby farm and run it.
The</B>
<P><B>weather had been very mild, so much so, that my buddy had been able
to</B>
<P><B>continue ploughing, and having a full moon helping light the fields
was</B>
<P><B>a great benefit to us.</B>
<P><B>  After a full day, which had commenced at five AM, and went through
to</B>
<P><B>about 1 AM, we finally loaded up the old wood-burning furnace in the</B>
<P><B>basement, and retired to our rooms. I have a nasty habit of having
to</B>
<P><B>read a bit before turning out the light, and did so for about 20</B>
<P><B>minutes, then turned out the light. The full moon seemed to keep the</B>
<P><B>room well lighted, and I soon drifted off. I awoke to find a girl,</B>
<P><B>standing beside my bed, dressed in a long nightgown, and I was seeing</B>
<P><B>through her. The moon had shifted position in the sky, and I knew that
a</B>
<P><B>couple of hours had passed since I went to sleep. The wallpaper in
the</B>
<P><B>room, which had been striped, was now a floral print, roses, I think.</B>
<P><B>I'd experienced ghosts before, and was not frightened, and the sad
look</B>
<P><B>on her face moved me to ask her what she wanted. She looked right at
me,</B>
<P><B>and it seemed strange that her lips never moved, but I learned her
whole</B>
<P><B>story.</B>
<P><B>  This is the tale that she gave me.</B>
<P><B>  It seems that her and her younger sister had been orphaned, and
sent</B>
<P><B>to live with their aunt and uncle on this farm .I was now sleeping
in</B>
<P><B>the room she had occupied. It seemed the uncle had started an
incestuous</B>
<P><B>relationship with her, and had threatened to turn her and her sister</B>
<P><B>out, if she ever told anyone, and also promised not to touch the
younger</B>
<P><B>sister, if she co-operated. That was until the younger sister became</B>
<P><B>pregnant by him, at which time, the two girls found that he'd been
using</B>
<P><B>the same story on them both. The sisters had no idea as to how their</B>
<P><B>uncle would take the news, never mind the aunt , who, though having
her</B>
<P><B>suspicions, turned a blind eye towards the whole thing. </B>
<P><B>  The story becomes a little "blurry" here, as if I couldn't recieve
the</B>
<P><B>information quick enough, but the next part was as clear as the
December</B>
<P><B>night it was told in. The uncle killed both of them and had buried
them</B>
<P><B>in the basement. He told his wife and the neighbours that they had
"run</B>
<P><B>off with some no-good, out west somewheres, and as far as he was</B>
<P><B>concerned, it was good riddance!"</B>
<P><B>  At this time, the girl started to fade, slowly, and I watched in</B>
<P><B>amazment as the wall-paper started to change back to its stripes. The</B>
<P><B>floral pattern faded, and as quickly as it did, the stripes appeared.</B>
<P><B>The moon hadn't changed position much, and I was sitting up in bed.
I</B>
<P><B>did not "awaken" this way...I was already awake. I went down to the</B>
<P><B>basement, and found the place that the girl had indicated to me. The</B>
<P><B>poured concrete floor was covered with dirt and bits of wood, but a</B>
<P><B>quick sweep with the broom soon showed a patch where the floor had
been</B>
<P><B>poorly repaired, right at the bottom of the stairs, in front of the
old</B>
<P><B>furnace. </B>
<P><B>  I returned to my bed, thinking that it was a strange thing to have</B>
<P><B>happen, and went to sleep.</B>
<P><B>  I talked to my buddy about it in the morning, and he tought it was
a</B>
<P><B>bit strange, but he also knew that I wouldn'T make something like
this</B>
<P><B>up. We wondered if the boss would let us dig up the floor, just to</B>
<P><B>satisfy our curiousity, but thought that we might go ahead on our
own,</B>
<P><B>and repair the damages through the week. I began having second
thoughts</B>
<P><B>about it, though. Did I really want to find a couple of skeletons
buried</B>
<P><B>there, and how would I explain how I knew they were there to anyone?
And</B>
<P><B>if we found nothing, I would have looked like a person whose imaginaton
</B>
<P><B>had over-powered his good sense, and had become obsessed with
nightmare.</B>
<P><B>  I always wonded if there was a tale of two girls, one about 16, the</B>
<P><B>other 14, who, during the 1920's had left the area to go out west,
and</B>
<P><B>were never heard from again.I also wonder what would happen if I</B>
<P><B>returned to the old house, and somehow talked the owner into allowing
me</B>
<P><B>to dig up a part of his basement. I'd probably be run off with a</B>
<P><B>shotgun.I also wonder if I'd let down a spirit who had reached beyond</B>
<P><B>the grave, attempting to get the truth out.If I have, I hope she</B>
<P><B>forgives me....</B>
<P><B>  The story I related is a true one, and whenever I think about it,
I</B>
<P><B>have all those questions running through my mind. If you wish to
reach</B>
<P><B>me, e-mail me at (gardener@oricom.ca)</B>

<H3><A NAME=beach>Haunted Beach House</A>
</H3><P><B>by DLOUHI@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've had some unusual experiences in my life, but this one stands out
and I continue to think about it till this day....</B>
<P><B>When I was 15 yrs old, my parents rented a beachhouse from a friend
at work.  They live in NJ, and the shore is the place to go...The house was
in Bricktown.  A small community with it's own private beach.  Not too far
from SeaSide or Point Pleasant.  The house is situated right on the bay.
 Walk out 100ft and you have your own crabbing dock.  It was located at a
deadend street, so the evenings were very quiet.</B>
<P><B>Now, being 15, was not an easy age for a girl.  The moodswings were
horrible enough that you didnt even like yourself at the time. But I believe
the raging hormones also increase your sensitivity.  I was not told much
about the house before we left, other than where it was located and a vague
description.</B>
<P><B> We arrived late, close to 12AM.  As I said, It was very quiet. You
enter the house from the back.  The front of the house was built facing the
Bay.  The first room is a guest room of sorts. It's a small room, maybee
8x8.  There is a hallway towards the far right wall.  The kitchen door is
on the right side and alittle bit further, the door for the (only) bathroom
is on the left.  Facing the bathroom door, is the cellar door on the opposite
side of the hallway.  There was always a darkness about this area.  I cant
remember if it was lighted, but I just in my memory there was a very dark
patch. </B>
<P><B>The hallway was only 6 or 7 feet in length, not much at all.  You walked
right into the family room or parlor.  Two story ceiling, A frame, with a
boulder fire place to your right. Windows surrounded the living room, giving
you a very open feeling.   The unusual aspect of the room was the stair leading
up and it was covered.  When you were standing and looking towards the hallway,
you saw the 2nd floor with the 2 bedroom doors side by side.  The enterance
of the stairs was cut in the wall and situated in the left corner of the
room. It was decorated in a sailors or sea theme.  It was pleasing and well
worn.</B>
<P><B>When we arrived, my parents and my sister went directly through the
house and outside to look at the Bay.  I do not know why, but I stayed inside
alone.  I sat in a chair facing the 2nd floor, when I felt a vibration, a
presence, I don't know what to call it.  It was in the far right corner of
the narrow catwalk, where the bedrooms where.  The hair on the back of my
neck stood up.  The feeling of fear was so strong, I left to join my family
outside.  I went directly to my mother and asked if this house was haunted,
she replied "how did you know?"</B>
<P><B>My mother, a very intelligent woman but also has a open mind when it
comes to the other senses.  I guess it comes by way of family, since my great,
grandmother was supposedly a gypsy.  Mom came to America in her mid twenties
from Germany.  Most of her family history was wiped out in WWII.  </B>
<P><B>There isn't much more I remember about my first trip other than my
mom mentioning pictures were taken in the house by other guest who caught
a hazy shape on the film.  You see, the previous owner was a doctor who
specialized in cancer reseach.  His daughter ironically, was diagnosed with
leukemia.  She was 16yrs old when she died.</B>
<P><B>The really interesting things happened when we returned the following
year.  I brought a friend, Monika and her boyfriend down with us. Now, I
did tell her there was something there but she really did not believe in
the beginning.  The first night Monika and I slept in the bedroom upstairs,
right next to my parents,  It was late, and we we cutting up, laughing, had
a case of the giggles.  Around midnight, both of us decided it was time to
sleep. I was on the inside of the bed and she was right next to the door.
 It was not closed all the way.  After turning off the lights, not seconds
later, we both her creaking on the stairs.  Then a knock on our door.  We
were staring at the door, hearing it and not seeing anything.  Let's say
we both went white and agreed it was time to go downstairs.</B>
<P><B>After kicking her boyfriend out of the bed in the guestroom,  We both
went to sleep.  I slowly woke hearing a booming noise, like someone was banging
on the pipes.  Then the  old alarm clock on top of the refrig. blasted music.
 The channels began to change very  quickly, as though someone was turning
the knob from one side to the other.  We stayed in bed, I was frozen.  Her
boyfriend got up and turned it off.  He never accepted what happened.  That
morning when I went into the kitchen I noticed it was unplugged.  I asked
him did he do that, he stated no. I asked my mother who also heard it, she
stated no.  Neither did my father.   It was never plugged in.</B>
<P><B>There was always a feeling of being watched.  A prickle on the neck,
tensing of the muscles, you would look around and nobody was there.  What
stood out is  when I was walking to the bathroom.  I would move quickly through
the hallway.  It felt like there  was a weight on my shoulders.  I could
never look at the basement door.  Even when my father needed my help, I couldn't
go down the stairs.</B>
<P><B>The next year, after telling my other friends I was taking down the
shore with me, all about the ghostly episodes in the house: they were
disappointed.  When I walked through the door, It felt empty.   Nothing happened.
 We had a great time, but it was just a house now.  </B>
<P><B>Mom told me something interesting after we returned home.  Before we
went down for the last time, The owners cleaned up the basement.  They found
much of the previous daughters possessions there and got rid of it.</B>
<P><B>What to make of it. I don't know. Maybe, since we were around the same
age when she died, there was a connection.  All I can say is it did happen
and it was real.</B>

<H3><A NAME=last>My Father's Last Goodbye</A>
</H3><P><B>by bader@gisnet.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>My father was a pilot with a national air carrier in Colombia, South
</B>
<P><B>America for 20 years.  My mother was accustomed to his continuos world
</B>
<P><B>travels.  In October of 1966, my father told my mother that he was
</B>
<P><B>retireing as a pilot and that he had been offered an executive position
</B>
<P><B>with the airline. For this reason, we would be moving to Bogota, the
</B>
<P><B>capital, where he had purchased land and was in the process of building
</B>
<P><B>a home for us.  At that moment, we began preparing for the move by
</B>
<P><B>selling our current home and taking care of other last </B>
<P><B>minute tasks.  On March 22nd of 1967, at 5:00 P.M., my father called
to </B>
<P><B>say that he was in Bogota after returning from a trip in Europe, and
</B>
<P><B>that he was going to drive to Medellin, the city in which we lived
which </B>
<P><B>was approxiamtely a 14 hour drive.  The last flight out to Medellin
had </B>
<P><B>left and he insisted on getting home immediatly and not spending the
</B>
<P><B>night in Bogota.  My mother urged him not to drive since he was </B>
<P><B>obviously exhausted from the flight and told him that the first flight
</B>
<P><B>the next morinig would get him home at about the same time as if he
</B>
<P><B>were to drive.  However, my father was anxious to get home to see her,
</B>
<P><B>myself and my brother and sister.  Despite my mother's insistence,
he </B>
<P><B>spoke with a pilot friend of his who agreed to follow him in his car
</B>
<P><B>with his family all the way to Medellin where they too resided.  At
1:00 </B>
<P><B>A.M. his friend stopped to tell him that he was extremely tired and
</B>
<P><B>could no longer drive.  He suggested that they spend the night in a
</B>
<P><B>nearby town and resume their drive the following morning after a good
</B>
<P><B>night's sleep.  My father refused explaining that doing so would delay
</B>
<P><B>his arrival more so than had he waited for the next morning's flight.
 </B>
<P><B>He said he would continue his drive and his friend and his fanily could
</B>
<P><B>spend the night in that town.  His friend's son, not wanting him to
</B>
<P><B>drive alone, offered to accompany him. Meanwhile, my mother went to
</B>
<P><B>sleep nervous knowing in fact that my father had decided to make the
</B>
<P><B>long and dangeroius drive through the mountenous terraine that </B>
<P><B>separates Medellin and Bogota, and anxious to see him after two weeks
of </B>
<P><B>absence.  At approximately 5:30 A.M., my mother heard my father walking
</B>
<P><B>up the stairs that led to our third floor apartment, and heard the
</B>
<P><B>clattering of keys as he tried to open the apartment door. She </B>
<P><B>immedialty gave out a sigh of relief believing that he had in fact
made </B>
<P><B>it home safely.  She heard him open the front door and heard his steps
</B>
<P><B>toward the bedroom door.  However, the door never opened...  </B>
<P>
<P><B>At 7:30 A.M. my mother received a call from an executive at Avianca,
the </B>
<P><B>airline for which my father worked.  The moment she heard his voice
she </B>
<P><B>knew something had happened.  Without him saying a word, she said,
</B>
<P><B>"Don't tell me, he's dead."  He told her not to worry, that everything
</B>
<P><B>was O.K. but she did not believe him.  She told him she knew something
</B>
<P><B>was wromg.  He then acknowledged that in fact my father had been </B>
<P><B>involved in an accident at about 5:30 A.M. in Caldas, a small town
only </B>
<P><B>45 minutes away from Medellin, and that he had died as a result of
the </B>
<P><B>accident.  The young boy who accompanied him had walked away from the
</B>
<P><B>accident without a scratch, but 12 years later met death in the same
</B>
<P><B>way, but this time with his wife and two children by his side.</B>

<H3><A NAME=great>My Great Grandfather</A>
</H3><P><B>by jcarpenter@netroute.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>This is my story. My family was moving into a old house. People were
telling</B>
<P><B>us it was haunted but, my dad didn't believe in ghosts. So we moved
in. As I</B>
<P><B>was picking put my room I found a room full of old books. They were
photo</B>
<P><B>books. I didn''t reconize anyone so I threw them in the basement. </B>
<P><B>A year later things went weird. I started hearing creaks when no one
was</B>
<P><B>walking, and a sound like someone was ponding. I got freaked and went
to the</B>
<P><B>library to check on the houses history. I found vey interesting things.
The</B>
<P><B>house was once owned by a dog trainer who was killed by a dog that
attacked</B>
<P><B>her. No one ever lived in for the next 7 years. That was when I came</B>
<P><B>acrossed something interesting. The couple that moved in it next was
Mr. and</B>
<P><B>Mrs. Smith. My great-grandparents!! I remember Nana talking about my
Papa</B>
<P><B>dieing of a heart attack. Well the town was under the impresion that
the dog</B>
<P><B>trainer killed him. For the next few nights I had a terrible time
sleeping.</B>
<P><B>One night as I lay awake in my bed someone came to the door. I thought
it</B>
<P><B>was my dad but as he came closer I saw who it really was. It was my
Papa.</B>
<P><B>The one who lived in the house along time ago. I was about to scream
when he</B>
<P><B>told me not to. We stared at each other for about 2 minutes when he
turned</B>
<P><B>around and left.</B>
<P><B>I woke up the next morning thinkling it was all a dream but there was
a</B>
<P><B>charm on my dresser. I opened it and inside was Nana's and Papa's
picture.</B>
<P><B>On the front was my Nana's name engraved. I phoned Nana and told her
I was</B>
<P><B>on my way over. I told her everything and showed her the necklace.
She began</B>
<P><B>to cry. She said that she believed he still lived in that house and
that it</B>
<P><B>why she didn't tell us about the history. The necklace she said was
her</B>
<P><B>anniversary present from Papa. After he died and she moved out, she
left it</B>
<P><B>for him to return and keep. I went home and thought about everything
and</B>
<P><B>finally came to a conclusion. I was visited by my Papa's angel. I was</B>
<P><B>shocked when I thought to myself that I hope he comes back. Maybe next
time</B>
<P><B>my mom or dad would see him.</B>

<H3><A NAME=strum>The Old Strum House</A>
</H3><P><B>by barbara.haas@bangate1.TEK.COM </B>
<P>
<P><B>The old Strum place sat on a hill, 5 miles south of Cornelius, Oregon.
</B>
<P><B>Known as the Old Storm Place, it was built by an old German and his
</B>
<P><B>family from the old country.  It had clapboard siding, painted white,
</B>
<P><B>lots of windows.  It had a huge barn on the place that sat below the
</B>
<P><B>house amid huge cedar, firs and pine trees that sighed in the wind
like </B>
<P><B>the pines in a Curwood novel.</B>
<P><B>I first saw the old house in the last part of 1937.  The depression
was </B>
<P><B>still rampant in the land and so many were out of work, but if you
could </B>
<P><B>get out of town and back to the land, there were always nuts, fruit,
and </B>
<P><B>berries to work in and put up for the winter at a minimal cost.  There
</B>
<P><B>was always empty houses or woodcutters shacks, empty because people
had </B>
<P><B>left to go elsewhere, or some farmer had bought or leased land, and
</B>
<P><B>didn't need the house that went with it. Most were not in to bad a
shape, </B>
<P><B>usually a stove had been left along with a rough hewn table, some </B>
<P><B>benches, and orange crates for cupboards, nailed to the walls, one
made </B>
<P><B>out pretty well.  No one seemed to be on window breaking binges, so
the </B>
<P><B>windows were usually intact.   With flour sack curtains, a good floor
</B>
<P><B>scrubbing, fire in the stove, and a pot of beans cooking, they were
a </B>
<P><B>haven to  crawl into, and it felt like "home".  Most everyone took
care </B>
<P><B>of the property and left it as neat, or more so than when they moved
in. </B>
<P><B> Sure beat a  hole-in-the-wall apartment, or a tar paper, or corrugated
</B>
<P><B>shack near the dumps.  </B>
<P><B>This district, I believe, was called the Iowa Hill District, strictly
a </B>
<P><B>German Lutheran Community.  We sure needed a place to stay, we had
a baby </B>
<P><B>girl and my husband could cut wood if we could find a place to stay.
 We </B>
<P><B>moved into the old Storm place, after getting permission from Alex
</B>
<P><B>Eischen, who owned another farm about a mile and a half away and farmed
</B>
<P><B>this place.  We asked about the amount of rent he wanted, but to our
</B>
<P><B>amazement he could hardly keep a grin off his face or the twinkle from
</B>
<P><B>his eyes, like he had some secret, and he said he didn't want any rent,
</B>
<P><B>as we wouldn't be there very long anyway.  He said sure we could live
</B>
<P><B>there, if we could stand it.</B>
<P><B>Up the road the other way lived a bachelor, a thickset German, who
only </B>
<P><B>laughed when we told him we were moving in, and he wanted to know how
</B>
<P><B>long we were staying!!!  We couldn't figure out what the joke was,
but </B>
<P><B>shrugged it all off and moved in.  Everyone we saw would say </B>
<P><B>incredulously, "You're moving into the old Storm House?", and look
at us </B>
<P><B>as if we were either to young, or to foolish to catch on.  We met many
 </B>
<P><B>with just open stares, embarrassed grins, or just a shake of the head.
 </B>
<P><B>Evidently the house was well known!!</B>
<P><B>There was my husband and I, our little girl and a cousin, or brother
who </B>
<P><B>stayed with us, often by turns, who would come to help cut wood awhile.
 </B>
<P><B>They used one of the old dragsaws, you now see in museums, and were
paid </B>
<P><B>$2.50 a cord, cut, delivered and stacked.  This was divided two and
</B>
<P><B>sometimes three ways, but you could keep a few chickens, and the </B>
<P><B>neighbors gave us milk for milking his cow when he had to be gone.
 The </B>
<P><B>place looked like a castle as we sure needed a place to stay with a
baby </B>
<P><B>and down to our last "nickel", you might say.  My husband's cousin
had an </B>
<P><B>old car put together sometimes with baling wire, so we had </B>
<P><B>transportation.</B>
<P><B>Our water came from an old pump by the side of the house, which we
had to </B>
<P><B>carry in for drinking, washing, scrubbing floors, cooking, canning,
and </B>
<P><B>baths.  And of course had to be heated on the cook stove.  The well
was a </B>
<P><B>deep one and echoed many sounds, like footsteps walking, that never
</B>
<P><B>appeared.  We dismissed many sounds as just being the well what it
was.</B>
<P><B>We did begin to hear no one who ever lived there stayed very long.
 A </B>
<P><B>cousin of my husband and her family stayed a short time before moving
to </B>
<P><B>the North Plains area. Their names were John and Leta Epler. They never
</B>
<P><B>would talk about the place, but did say no one member of the family
</B>
<P><B>stayed alone, and one time Leta was bitten by a rat as she laid in
the </B>
<P><B>bed with a small baby.  They used the bedroom off the front room.(
See </B>
<P><B>drawing)</B>
<P><B>While we were there, we hardly ever used the front door, or even the
</B>
<P><B>front part of the house, as the back door seemed more convenient to
the </B>
<P><B>kitchen, woodshed and all.</B>
<P><B>We begin to hear stories, mostly from our bachelor German neighbor,
that </B>
<P><B>the Strums had been bootleggers, a man was killed on the stairway leading
</B>
<P><B>upstairs, and that there were trap doors in some of the rooms.  The
</B>
<P><B>bloodstains were still visible on the steps, four or five steps up
and </B>
<P><B>also where the blood spilled on the floor.  We did find three trap
doors </B>
<P><B>that led to nice dug-out spaces below the floors.  We kept being told
</B>
<P><B>after we moved, no one would live there ever, but we were young and
</B>
<P><B>brave, and who believed in ghosts anyway???  And who worries when
you're </B>
<P><B>young.</B>
<P><B>We moved in with little or no furniture, using what we could find,
and </B>
<P><B>besides we decided after being around, the other part of the house
wasn't </B>
<P><B>needed, and it wasn't a very "friendly" part anyway.  </B>
<P><B>For awhile everything went along all right, being early summer, we
were </B>
<P><B>out of doors a lot, but as it got on towards fall, we begin to notice
odd </B>
<P><B>noises.  The first seemed to be these resounding footsteps that could
be </B>
<P><B>heard on the northside of the house where the pump sat.  I would run
out </B>
<P><B>to meet whoever was there, glad for any company as the farms were a
long </B>
<P><B>way apart in those days, and no one would be there.   Since the farms
</B>
<P><B>were two to three miles apart, we couldn't see how the footsteps could
 </B>
<P><B>echo so.  No one seemed to be walking much anyway.</B>
<P><B>The next incident was the sound of someone chopping wood in the woodshed,
</B>
<P><B>usually in the afternoons.  It would be the sound of measured chopping
</B>
<P><B>and I would dash out, thinking my husband had come home early.   If
the </B>
<P><B>dragsaw was broken down, often his cousin would go to town for parts
and </B>
<P><B>my husband would come home and cut wood  for the wood range and heater
</B>
<P><B>stove in the dining room.  When I'd get to the woodshed, the chopping
</B>
<P><B>would stop,  and start up again when I got back to the house.  So I'd
</B>
<P><B>think  he'd just stepped out side for a minute, and go running out
again </B>
<P><B>when the chopping started up again.  This would go on and on until
it </B>
<P><B>seemed I would wear my legs out.  This would go on for days, lasting
an </B>
<P><B>hour or so every afternoon, and then maybe go weeks before it would
start </B>
<P><B>up again, always in the afternoons only.  This went on as long as we
</B>
<P><B>lived there. We never did figure out an explanation for this.</B>
<P><B>There were the sound of men's footsteps that went to the stairs where
the </B>
<P><B>bloodspots were, stopped, and walked on into the living room, we used
as </B>
<P><B>our front room.  This would go on for some time, and then quite awhile
</B>
<P><B>would pass before he would  be back again.  He seemed to end his walk
at </B>
<P><B>the trap door in the room.  That trap door was very  "active" all the
</B>
<P><B>time we lived there.  I often wondered if someone was buried there.
 </B>
<P><B>Every afternoon, without fail, about three o'clock in the afternoon,
no </B>
<P><B>matter what you were doing, your head would automatically  jerk towards
</B>
<P><B>the corner of that trap door.  It was a forced reaction and you
couldn't </B>
<P><B>keep from doing it.  It became so routine, we just accepted it.  We
never </B>
<P><B>told anyone about this, as we like to see if  it affected everyone
the </B>
<P><B>same way.  It would and they would get a funny look on their face and
say </B>
<P><B>they had to be going.  No one ever didn't jerk and stare at the trap
</B>
<P><B>door.  The trap door was cut in such a way, that if you didn't know
about </B>
<P><B>it, you didn't see it, and we didn't bother to tell anyone about it.
 We </B>
<P><B>were having a good time with it and thought it was fun.  After we moved
a </B>
<P><B>few people asked us about it and being young and full of mischief,
</B>
<P><B>sometimes we told them, "No, we didn't notice anything".</B>
<P><B>About once a month when there was a full moon shinning over the fields
</B>
<P><B>and trees, different footsteps walked from the back door through the
</B>
<P><B>kitchen, living room and on into the south bedroom, where they seemed
to </B>
<P><B>stand and look out the window.  These were the steps of a young girl
who </B>
<P><B>seemed to be barefoot.  Like the sound of bare feet sticking to the
floor </B>
<P><B>and then moving on across the room.  Was she waiting for a lover who
</B>
<P><B>never returned or was killed????</B>
<P><B>The men used to follow the steps, one by one and they didn't stop until
</B>
<P><B>they got to the window.  She's the only one we ever saw, like apparition,
</B>
<P><B>barefoot and dressed in a long black cape.  we saw her twice.  One
night </B>
<P><B>one of my husband's cousins was coming to spend the night. Ruby was
to </B>
<P><B>stop at a sisters place down below the hill from us, have supper and
</B>
<P><B>visit and then come up to spend the night.   It got later and later
and </B>
<P><B>she hadn't arrived so we went to bed, having told her to just come
in and </B>
<P><B>go to bed when she got back.   Sometime after midnight, the back door
</B>
<P><B>opened softly, thinking it was Ruby, I didn't get up.  The bedroom
was </B>
<P><B>long with a cot at the far end.  As she seemed to stop, or pause at
the </B>
<P><B>doorway, I  whispered, "Come in, Ruby,  and crawl in!"  There wasn't
any </B>
<P><B>electricity and the moonlight was shining in the window so I didn't
light </B>
<P><B>the lamp.   She stood in the doorway in her long black coat or cape,
so I </B>
<P><B>whispered again louder, two or three times.  Still there was no  movement
</B>
<P><B>and I was getting chills up my back.  I woke my husband saying,
"There's </B>
<P><B>someone standing there and they won't answer."  He saw "her" standing
</B>
<P><B>there and swung at her with his fist,  she disappeared.  Ruby never
did </B>
<P><B>come, she had played cards and talked until so late, she just made
a bed </B>
<P><B>on the floor and slept there.</B>
<P><B>We never told the rest about the barefoot girl.  Many footsteps walked
to </B>
<P><B>the one trap door, but the other main one never seemed to have any
</B>
<P><B>disturbances.  We dried walnuts upstairs in the unfinished part and
the </B>
<P><B>rats did roll walnuts across the floor to the edge and they rolled
down </B>
<P><B>between the wall.   We know this accounted for some noises we heard,
at </B>
<P><B>least the ones upstairs.</B>
<P><B>Some evenings when we lit the kerosene lamp, a strange wind would come
in </B>
<P><B>the house and blow the lamp out.  We'd go outside to see if it were
windy </B>
<P><B>and the air would be strangely still.  Go back in light the lamp, and
the </B>
<P><B>wind would blow it out time and time again.  This would happen for
up to </B>
<P><B>an hour at a time, and then back to normal.</B>
<P><B>My little girl who was a little over two by this time would be playing
</B>
<P><B>with her toys or dolls and would stop her play and jerk around and
look </B>
<P><B>intently at "something".  I'd watch her so she didn't know it and she
</B>
<P><B>would just look for awhile and then go back to playing.</B>
<P><B>At the time we'd laugh and say "Oscar's" back, with absolutely no fear.
 </B>
<P><B>We liked it there with our ghosts. Now I wouldn't stay in that place.</B>
<P><B>One afternoon Mr Eischen said he'd be up to pick up some of the old
prune </B>
<P><B>dryers in the prune drying shed on the place.   We told him we'd help
</B>
<P><B>load them. We were late getting back from milking and it was one of
the </B>
<P><B>evenings when the "wind" kept blowing out the lamps.  Hearing pounding
in </B>
<P><B>the shed, my brother-in-law said he'd go help Mr. Eischen with the
</B>
<P><B>dryers, as it was getting pretty dark.  When he got there, there
wasn't </B>
<P><B>anyone there.  When he got back to the house,  you could hear the trays
</B>
<P><B>being lifted,  pounding and footsteps.  Each time they went down, the
</B>
<P><B>noise stopped and no one there. Come back to the house and it all started
</B>
<P><B>again. This and the lamps blowing out went on for about an hour.  All
at </B>
<P><B>once, the wind and noises were gone and everything was normal.</B>
<P><B>The next day we asked Mr. Eischen if he'd come to get the dryer trays
and </B>
<P><B>he said no, he had found enough at his place and didn't need them.
 Again </B>
<P><B>we didn't tell anyone of this.  It was one time I was uneasy there.</B>
<P><B>One time we had  party with food and drinks and company.  It wasn't
long </B>
<P><B>until the guests all came and told us they were leaving, if we wanted
to </B>
<P><B>stay in such a weird place, go ahead, but they were leaving.  We asked
</B>
<P><B>them what was the matter, no one would say anything.  We were surprised
</B>
<P><B>as we had told our "occupants" to behave themselves as we were having
</B>
<P><B>company, but the party broke up early and their parting shot was "If
we </B>
<P><B>ever moved, invite them again, but not to that place  ever. " We were
</B>
<P><B>surprised as we never told anything to anyone, partly because we were
</B>
<P><B>afraid they'd think we were ready for the funny farm and partly because
</B>
<P><B>we enjoyed our secrets.  Being young and dumb, we thought it was </B>
<P><B>hilarious and drank to "Oscar" and all the other shady men who lived
</B>
<P><B>there with us.</B>
<P><B>I never heard of a Mrs. Strum, but there were signs of a garden plot,
a </B>
<P><B>grape patch and clothesline. </B>
<P><B>The barn was the only place I was afraid of.  It was a beautiful big
barn </B>
<P><B>and I loved barns.  Since I had read and heard about Hobo's  or other
</B>
<P><B>homeless people scaring intruders away from the place they wanted to
</B>
<P><B>occupy, I went to look and see if this was the case with the barn.
 On a </B>
<P><B>calm sunny day if I entered the barn, gates and partitions would slam
 </B>
<P><B>shut with such force they would almost hit me.  It was such force it
</B>
<P><B>would scare the living daylights out of me.  There were no spring hinges,
</B>
<P><B>or anything like that that would make them do this.  No matter when
I </B>
<P><B>went down there, this would happen.  The pines were so sad sounding,
they </B>
<P><B>signed and sobbed in the breeze.</B>
<P><B>Since the men were away a lot, I put up with the ghosts more than they
</B>
<P><B>did.  I did stay alone a few times at night, but wasn't afraid, except
at </B>
<P><B>the barn.</B>
<P><B>The summer of 1939 I had a baby boy and there seemed to be less ghostly
</B>
<P><B>goings-on.  Maybe we were just happy with the baby and I was so busy
with </B>
<P><B>both children and lots of washing,  to do on the wash board,  and did
it </B>
<P><B>mainly outside during the summer.</B>
<P><B>Toward fall my husband went to work for Arnold Gnos and since he had
a </B>
<P><B>woodcutters cabin on the place he came up the hill and insisted we
get </B>
<P><B>out of the Storm place.  He seemed really concerned.  Again no </B>
<P><B>explanation and we gave none.  As we drove away I looked back and thought
</B>
<P><B>I saw a movement at the window.</B>
<P><B>One day a neighbor came by on horseback and  said he was going to go
look </B>
<P><B>around the old Storm place and asked if we'd lived there.  He came
back </B>
<P><B>in a couple of hours, hair unruly and visibly shaken.  He asked if
we'd  </B>
<P><B>"really lived in that place"?  He had spent some time looking at some
of </B>
<P><B>the old magazines in the upstairs, but wouldn't say anything else except
</B>
<P><B> "he'd never live there, in fact, he'd never so much as set foot in
there </B>
<P><B>again!"  Playing dumb I asked why as I wanted to hear someone else's
</B>
<P><B>version of the place, but all he'd do is shake his head  as he rode
on.</B>
<P><B>And what happened to the Old Storm Place???  A great blaze appeared
one </B>
<P><B>day on top of the lonely hill and the old house, and perhaps all the

<P><B>ghosts, went up in smoke, or did they all go live in the barn?  The
house </B>
<P><B>didn't burn accidentally, the men of the neighborhood community got
</B>
<P><B>together and burned it down.  They seemed to know a good deal about
the </B>
<P><B>strange going-on that went on in that old house, but none would really
</B>
<P><B>speak of it, maybe feeling a little foolish it were voiced aloud, and
</B>
<P><B>would tolerate no more of that place.</B>
<P><B>I never went back after the house burnt just couldn't. We "all" got
along </B>
<P><B>fine in the house together and lived together quite well.  They tolerated
</B>
<P><B>us, but no one else could manage them.  Perhaps they liked us, who
knows? </B>
<P><B> Being older and looking back, I couldn't or wouldn't have stayed there
</B>
<P><B>now as I'd have been scared to death.  I've never talked about it much
</B>
<P><B>and now have written it down. My daughter remembers it very faintly,
she </B>
<P><B>was three when we left and remembers the good things, a puppy, a pet
pig, </B>
<P><B>going for walks and picking the wildflowers, and who knows what friends
</B>
<P><B>she had with "Oscar and troop"?????</B>
