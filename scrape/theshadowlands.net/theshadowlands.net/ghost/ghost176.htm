<b>Double Jimmy's</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: AMCM74@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grew up on a farm in Central Pa. There are so
many weird happens there</b>
<br><b>that it would take an army of Super natualists in investigate them
all. Some</b>
<br><b>the common ghost stories and another that required Police investigation.
This</b>
<br><b>was the most memorible one that happened to me. I call it the Double
Jimmy.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My brother (jimmy) and I were suppose to be cleaning
the horse pens out.</b>
<br><b>Instead we were playing tag. (normal kids) I raced through then
Barn and up</b>
<br><b>into the hayloft. Jim was fast behind me so with a kick and a shove
I pushed</b>
<br><b>a bale of hay over the hole that lead to the loft and rested for
a sec. I</b>
<br><b>listend to Jim below and tried to keep track of his movments so
i could</b>
<br><b>"escape". I heard some one crawling up the side of the roof of the
barn.</b>
<br><b>Realising that there was no possible way of blocking Jim from getting
in I</b>
<br><b>pushed the hay bale back and jumped to the ground. I saw Aza (one
of our</b>
<br><b>horses) standing near by. She was realluy freindly so I knew I could
get her</b>
<br><b>and make my good my escape. The only other horse calm enough to
walk up to</b>
<br><b>was Bunny and she had a bad shoulder and couldn't run fast. I leapt
up on Aza</b>
<br><b>and grabbing the halter took off past the barn I heard a faint yell
behind me</b>
<br><b>"Hey!" But glancing back I saw Jimmy in the hay loft with a stick
looking</b>
<br><b>angry. I thought "He is mad I took Aza." Then he threw the stick
pointed end</b>
<br><b>first at me" I quickly pulled aza to the side. She saw it to and
jumped side</b>
<br><b>ways as the stick embedded in the ground between her front and back
legs.</b>
<br><b>(keep in mind she was in a trot and jumped side ways. This stick
would have</b>
<br><b>hit her or me square if she had not jumped. It was also summer and
the ground</b>
<br><b>was dry so the stick was thrown hard to impale int he ground like
it did.) I</b>
<br><b>was annoyed Jim had thrown it at me and made a mental note to give
him a</b>
<br><b>stern talking to about it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a min later Jim was behind me (on Bunny)
riding through the woods.</b>
<br><b>I started laughing at him "Pretty sneaky of me to steal Aza from
you"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know. I was shocked you did that to
me." He smiled happily</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not letting my good mood deter me I added "You
know you could have really</b>
<br><b>hurt me with that stick you threw at Aza"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimmy looked confused at me "What stick."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got mad thinking he was going to deny it. Not
something he did and I</b>
<br><b>wasn;t about to let him start now. "The one behind the barn! You
threw it at</b>
<br><b>me while in the hay loft."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimmy stopped Bunny dead "I was never in the
hayloft. You locked me out,</b>
<br><b>Remeber. I was trying to think on who to get up there when you rode
past on</b>
<br><b>Aza. I yelled at you and grabbed Bunny"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned and headed back to the barn where the
stick was still stuck in</b>
<br><b>the ground recalling I had heard Jimmy behind me. The same call
that made me</b>
<br><b>see the figure in the barn. The one that was just like a Double
of Jimmy</b>

<p><b>They are Missed!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Pscreem@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>sorry it's more like a book but its all true</b><b></b>
<p><b>my Mom and I have lived in this apartment building for almost ten
years.</b>
<br><b>my Mom a year longer.</b>
<br><b>my Mom lived on the 3rd floor and I on the second</b>
<br><b>things didn't start happening until around the time I gave birth
to my 4th</b>
<br><b>child my only daughter Melissa who is almost nine now</b>
<br><b>When she first came home she shared a room with my husband and I
for the</b>
<br><b>first few weeks.</b>
<br><b>Then she was moved to her own room which was right next to ours.</b>
<br><b>One night soon after</b>
<br><b>I heard her dresser draws open and closing not fast or loud but
like somebody</b>
<br><b>was looking for something.</b>
<br><b>I thought it was my husband</b>
<br><b>so I called out to him and asked what he was looking for</b>
<br><b>(I thought Melissa had woken up I didn't hear her)</b>
<br><b>he didn't answer so I went to get up and then I realized my husband
was</b>
<br><b>asleep beside me</b>
<br><b>and I could still hear the draws so I got up to look when I got
to her</b>
<br><b>doorway they stopped I went in and looked around and saw nobody
there</b>
<br><b>but it was chilly</b>
<br><b>this happened several times</b>
<br><b>the only way to get to her room is by going through our room so
it was not</b>
<br><b>any of my other children</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; during the day when she would
take her nap</b>
<br><b>(I would be the only one home)</b>
<br><b>I would go in her room when she woke up to take her out of her crib</b>
<br><b>the blankets in her crib were not the same ones I covered her in
when I laid</b>
<br><b>her down</b>
<br><b>it seemed the ghost liked her fluffy pastel jungle blanket best</b>
<br><b>if it was on the clothesline the other would be there instead but
most of the</b>
<br><b>time the other blanket would be folded and placed at the bottom
of her crib.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when Melissa was 3 she started
to take dance lessons on Saturday</b>
<br><b>mornings</b>
<br><b>my husband and I would always stop at my moms to tell how they went</b>
<br><b>my Mom has a big French door to enter her living room there is a
chair on</b>
<br><b>each side</b>
<br><b>I was on the right as you enter my moms bedroom door was to the
right of me</b>
<br><b>by a foot or two my husband set to the left my Mom on his left on
the end of</b>
<br><b>the sofa</b>
<br><b>all of a sudden I could smell baby lotion but neither my Mom or
my husband</b>
<br><b>could</b>
<br><b>after a few seconds my Mom could then my husband</b>
<br><b>it was like someone walked from my moms room right between us and
out the</b>
<br><b>livingroom door.</b>
<br><b>my Mom didn't have any babylotion in the house we never could use
it on</b>
<br><b>Melissa</b>
<br><b>because she had skin problems so bad as a baby.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (thats when my
husband started to believe)</b>
<br><b>not to long after that I started to smell a soft sachet around my
apartment</b>
<br><b>I knew the smell very well my grandmother used to wear it.</b>
<br><b>I told my Mom after the first time I smelt it</b>
<br><b>that I thought I knew who out ghost was</b>
<br><b>she agreed my grandmother also used baby lotion on her hands all
the time</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
a few months later my oldest son started high school</b>
<br><b>I was sitting at my kitchen table writing a shopping list and Melissa
was in</b>
<br><b>her room playing she came out of her room and asked me if I knew
who bobalink</b>
<br><b>was ?</b>
<br><b>I told her no I didn't know she went back off to play after a few
minutes</b>
<br><b>it dawned on me I did know I ran to her room and looked around and
found</b>
<br><b>nothing but her playing it wasn't chilly (I'm sure it was to long
of a time</b>
<br><b>had past)</b>
<br><b>and Grabbed Melissa and went to my Mom's not from being scared but
this was</b>
<br><b>real proof it was my grandmother</b>
<br><b>my grandmother could have asked Melissa about my other two sons
and got</b>
<br><b>answers</b>
<br><b>but out the great grandchildren she only had a nickname for one
and that was</b>
<br><b>my oldest son Bobby which she always called bobalink</b>
<br><b>it had been so many years I had forgot</b>
<br><b>there is no way Melissa would have known that</b>
<br><b>my other sons didn't remember my grandmother calling him that either</b>
<br><b>and Bobby came home that day to say he made the baseball team at
school</b>
<br><b>my grandmother died almost a year to the date before Melissa was
born</b>
<br><b>so she had never meet my grandmother not in real life form anyway</b>
<br><b>(I "M not sure if this part even counts but I'm gonna add it anyway</b>
<br><b>on the morning Melissa was born at the exact moment she was born
it started</b>
<br><b>to snow the biggest flakes I had ever seen my sister was in the
room with me</b>
<br><b>and she saw them my Mom at home she had my other sons had seen them
as well</b>
<br><b>Melissa was born on December 16th we live in new England</b>
<br><b>so snow is normal here at that time</b>
<br><b>my grandmother died on the 6th the year before</b>
<br><b>it snowed like that every year till about the last 3 I bet it won't
this year</b>
<br><b>either</b>
<br><b>I will be getting to that</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the family was used to
our ghost it didn't cause no problems</b>
<br><b>it seemed it was around Melissa mostly</b>
<br><b>but other things had happened</b>
<br><b>at different times we could hear someone coming up the backstairs
we would be</b>
<br><b>right on the porch and see no one.</b>
<br><b>The TV would come on in the middle of the night when no one was
up</b>
<br><b>lights would be turned on never off just on.</b>
<br><b>my Mom had seen glowing balls above her stove one night (it wasn't
on that</b>
<br><b>night)</b>
<br><b>we had ordered pizza it was summer to hot to cook</b>
<br><b>my Mom thought it was someone out side the window with a flashlight</b>
<br><b>when she told me about it the next day</b>
<br><b>I looked around her stove and found nothing.</b>
<br><b>I asked her if her shades were down that night she said they were</b>
<br><b>I went out that night with a flashlight and tried it she was on
the inside</b>
<br><b>and she couldn't see the beam.</b>
<br><b>a few times my Mom would go out shopping and come home to smell
aftershave in</b>
<br><b>her kitchen (my Mom lives alone)</b>
<br><b>one night I was watching&nbsp; remake of Stephen Kings The Shining</b>
<br><b>there was preview of the news during the movie about local haunted
places</b>
<br><b>so I stayed up to watch it and during they said that a camera man
from the</b>
<br><b>news was doing a documentary and if you had any stories to call</b>
<br><b>I told my Mom the next day she said to call him and see what he
says</b>
<br><b>so I did his name was Matt I gave him a quick run down of everything</b>
<br><b>he wanted to come out and talk to us (to make sure we were on the
up and up I</b>
<br><b>figure)</b>
<br><b>we pointed out how everything was and where things happened</b>
<br><b>he asked us to do the show we said we would</b>
<br><b>he told us he was gonna have a spiritualist come in as well to see
if he sees</b>
<br><b>or feels anything</b>
<br><b>we did the filming of remakes on how some of the things happened</b>
<br><b>then the next weekend the spiritualist came to do his thing his
name was John</b>
<br><b>he took pictures to see if he could get flash points</b>
<br><b>he was not told anything about what was happening at our home</b>
<br><b>but he said he could see that all together there was 6 ghosts in
our house</b>
<br><b>he described them all to be our past on family members to a Tee</b>
<br><b>we had pictures of our family members that none of them had seen
we took them</b>
<br><b>out to show them how right he was</b>
<br><b>my grandfather who I had never meet,2 of my aunts that I knew,my
grandmother,</b>
<br><b>my husbands father and uncle</b>
<br><b>who were mostly around my husband</b>
<br><b>John knew exactly which room everything was happening in</b>
<br><b>(Melissa's)</b>
<br><b>but he had one thing which both my mom and I agree on</b>
<br><b>John said they were here&nbsp; my because of my Mother</b>
<br><b>we both think it was because of Melissa thats right was</b>
<br><b>nothing has happened in a little over 3 years</b>
<br><b>the last thing that happened was the best thing of all</b>
<br><b>not long after we did the show</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melissa
wanted to have a camp in camp out which she saw on one</b>
<br><b>of her kids shows.</b>
<br><b>so we decided the next weekend we would do it we made tents out
of sheets in</b>
<br><b>her room had the radio out and books to color and playing cards
and such</b>
<br><b>and munchies the first night she fell asleep so early that we didn't
do half</b>
<br><b>the stuff and she felt jipped and hurt so we left everything as
it was and</b>
<br><b>did it again the following night.</b>
<br><b>she took a nap the next day to make sure she would stay up late.</b>
<br><b>when it got dark we had a night light plugged into the wall we had
one side</b>
<br><b>of the tent flipped up so we could see</b>
<br><b>it was aound 11:00 that night we were playing cards and listening
to a story</b>
<br><b>tape</b>
<br><b>and we got to laughing really hard when you laugh your head bobs
and my head</b>
<br><b>came up a could see a shadow where Melissa's should have been it
was the</b>
<br><b>shadow of a young women was sitting beside melissa and from her
shadow it</b>
<br><b>looked liked she was laughing with us.</b>
<br><b>and to me it was the shadow of my grandmothers school picture same
hair style</b>
<br><b>and everything</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now to the why we think they were here for melissa
and not my mom.</b>
<br><b>My Husband and I split up not long after that last sighting i guess
you would</b>
<br><b>call it.</b>
<br><b>he was a very heavy drinker,</b>
<br><b>it didn't matter what time of day</b>
<br><b>the verbal abuse was pure craziness. I could never trust him to
take really</b>
<br><b>good care of Melissa because half way through he would pass out</b>
<br><b>and she is an asthmatic so she has to have medication all the time.</b>
<br><b>and after we split up the ghosts just stopped.</b>
<br><b>it's like she (Melissa) will be fine now we don't need to watch
out for her</b>
<br><b>anymore</b>
<br><b>it's weird but I miss having them around</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Mothers Memories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tracyb-24@Hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, I would like to share a story with you. It was told to me
by my mother. she swears it is true, so here it is.&nbsp; when my mom was
around 5 or 6, she moved to a huge white house with a big wrap around porch.
i don't know all the details, but she said that there was a little ghost
car that would drive around the house at night. she would be in bed and
hear it drive all over the house. up and down the hallway. she was playing
in the floor one day and heard a revving noise. It was the car trying to
push the closed french door open.&nbsp; She told her mom, but she just
laughed and told her she was being a silly child. When i say ghost car,
i mean it was little and transparent, in the shape of a volkswagon.&nbsp;
The house had high ceilings with the light bulbs hanging from a line, so
you pulled a string to turn them on. She would be in bed at night and watch
while something pulled the light up, then let it go back down again. Also
she would be in bed whith her head on the pillow and dream about a snake
crawling through the space between the pillow and the back of her neck.
Well, she would get up in the morning and have a rash on the back of her
neck that would fade through the day.&nbsp; She saw a shadow of a man walking
down the hallway.&nbsp; I never understood why her mom didn't believe her,
they saw and heard things too. They would go to bed at night and if it
was summer they would leave the main doors open and just hook the screen
doors shut. well, they would get up in the morning and all the hooks would
be cut from the inside. Like something just snapped them in to. Her grandpa
lived there and he would hear someone walking around the kitchen table
but when he went to see, noone was there. He would hear singing coming
from the barn out back but noone would ever be there.&nbsp; There was a
little shed out back they used for a garage. one night my mom and her parents
were coming home from visiting, and my grandpa couldn't get the truck into
the shed. He said get out i will make it go if i have to run through the
back of the building. so,my mom and grandma get out&nbsp; and he backs
the truck up, then floors it. He gets to the shed and bam, he gos in but
a small, white, transparent balls comes out, kind of floating and bouncing
across the yard. Mom said it just disappeared. like it was never there
to begin with. There were other things too. i have already took up too
much space so i will stop here.&nbsp; Thank you very much, I hope this
doesn't start hauntings on me. Bye</b><b></b>

<br><b>House on the Hill</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: smoljano@camosun.bc.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>This event took place back in '96.&nbsp; I was living in a little
town about an</b>
<br><b>hours drive north of Ottawa Ont Canada.&nbsp; It was around 4:00pm
on a Sunday.</b>
<br><b>We had finished a weekend camping trip with a group of army cadets
and were</b>
<br><b>in the process of driving friends home.&nbsp; There were about 5
of us in one car</b>
<br><b>as only the driver had a licence.&nbsp; The first person to be dropped
off lived</b>
<br><b>about 30 minutes from the cadet hall so he would be the first drop
off.&nbsp; His</b>
<br><b>house sat at the top of a hill. The layout of the hill was a lot
like a</b>
<br><b>ramp, It sloped up from sea level (roughly) to a 60ft or so sheer
drop.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>took about 10 minutes to drive to the area where the 60ft drop was
and from</b>
<br><b>the road you could just see the roof of his house.&nbsp; It would
take anouther</b>
<br><b>20min or so to get around the cliff to his driveway and up to the
house.&nbsp; On</b>
<br><b>this day his mother was going to meet us just past the cliff around
the bend</b>
<br><b>and up the road about 1km at a rest stop.&nbsp; We met up with her
said our good</b>
<br><b>byes and left.&nbsp; As we rounded the bend we looked up towards
his house and</b>
<br><b>saw him waving to us from the top of the cliff.&nbsp; We all saw
him and we were</b>
<br><b>all sure it was him.&nbsp; Of course we all started to speculate
how he could</b>
<br><b>have gotten there so fast as by car it was impossable.&nbsp; One
of the guys said</b>
<br><b>he would call him when he got home.&nbsp; I had been home for about
2 hours when</b>
<br><b>I got a call from the guy who was going to make the call. It turns
out that</b>
<br><b>as my friends mother was pulling out of the rest stop they were
hit by</b>
<br><b>anouther car.&nbsp; She was severly injured and my friend was killed
instantly.</b>
<br><b>We decided not to tell anyone about this at the funeral as we figured
they</b>
<br><b>would think we were a bunch of teens looking for attention.&nbsp;
We all spoke to</b>
<br><b>each other about it many times, but know one every mentioned that
it was his</b>
<br><b>spirt saying a final fairwell.&nbsp; We all just tried to reason
a logical</b>
<br><b>explination but never did come up with one.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Ghostly Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: courtneyb@mindspring.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I have a ghostly experience that I would like to submit to
you. Actually, I have a lot of them but for the moment, I'll</b>
<br><b>only mention two of them.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Experience #1...</b>
<br><b>I was about 4 years old and living in a house in a very tiny town
called Cliftondale, Georgia. It's not on any maps so you probably won't
find it. I am a very sound sleeper and it takes a lot to wake me up at
night. It always has. Well, one night I woke up in the middle of the night
and there was an old man standing next to my window. I saw him as clear
as day. He had gray hair and was wearing overalls. He must have noticed
that I woke up because he turned his head toward me. I was petrified! I
pulled the sheet over my head but chould still see him through the sheet.
He began to walk toward me. I heard the unmistakable sound of feet shuffling
across the carpet. He walked over to the side of my bed and lightly tapped
my knee three times. I was so scared I couldn't move. Then he turned and
slowly walked out of my room. I heard him walk down the hallway. Every
night until we moved out of the house when I was 14, I heard those creepy
footsteps in the hallway every night. The next morning I told my parents
about the man who was in my room. My mom just told me that the man was
my dad checking on me. However, I overheard her telling the story to my
grandmother when I was 17 and she said that she had no clue who the man
was. She had told me that he was my dad so that I wouldn't be scared. That
freaked me out even more. I then knew that the strange man was most definitely
a ghost. Also, before we moved I heard the screen door slamming all the
time and drawers would open and close in the kitchen a lot too. Thos all
occurred until we moved out of the house in 1993.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Experience #2...</b>
<br><b>We moved from the above house to a brand new house in Sharpsburg,
Georgia, about 30 miles south of where we had previously lived. Not too
long after moving in, strange things began happening to me. In this new
house, different things occurred. I collected model horses and they were
placed along the back of the piano, which was against the wall in my room.
I would just be sitting in my room and my horses would float off of the
piano and fall on the floor on the other side of the room. Also, things
began to end up missing for weeks and then reappear. I loved playing card
games and I kept my decks of cards on my wicker shelves. Well, one day
I came in and my cards were gone. A few weeks later, the cards turned up,
back in the same place where they originally were. However, the strangest
incident was the VCR thing. I had a nearly new VCR but I don't watch all
that much TV. Well, one night I was sitting in my room and watching something
on TV when the chennels started changing on their own. I was really perplexed
by that. I changed the VCR to one channel and it stayed for a moment but
then began changing channels again, all on its own. I flipped out and ran
to get my dad, an airplane repairman and an ex-marine who absolutely does
not believe in ghosts. I showed him what was going on. He looked at the
VCR kind of funny as it changed channels right in front of him. He said
that maybe some sort of mocrowaves were causing it. He covered the place
where the VCR picks up the signals from the remote but it didn't stop it.
He said it would stop in a minute and went back to whatever he was doing.
It stopped and started and kept doing that. After about a half hour I unplugged
the VCR. Oddly enough, it still showed that the power was on and it was
changing channels still. I completely unhooked the VCR and put it in a
box and put it in my closet. The next day I went to my friend's house and
gave him the VCR, since I knew he needed one. He hooked it up and never
had any problems with it. Eventually those problems ceased. Now, I have
a different problem.</b>
<br><b>I had a cat that I had stolen from a family that had been abusing
it. His name was Tam. He was black and white and really loved me a lot.
He was named for my band director who died back in 1995 of brain cancer.
A year after we got him, right after I came to college, he was bitten by
a snake and died. We buried him and got another cat to ease the pain of
losing him. Well, after his death, I still feel his presence in the house.
Tam used to sleep on my bed with me. He would jump up there and lay next
to my side and purr until he fell asleep. Every now and then when I go
to bed, I can feel a can jumping up on my bed, laying down next to me,
and I can hear the purr. When I look down next to me, there is nothing
there. I do have two living cats but neither one was on the bed and I did
not feel anything jump down. I swear that Tam is still in my house.</b>
<br><b>I do have other experiences as well. If you would like to hear about
them, please let me know. I enjoy sharing them. Please</b>
<br><b>tell me what you think about these weird instances. They have been
on my mind for a long time.</b>

<p><b>The Gift!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lemming6a@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>The "gift" apparently runs in my family, although it seems to skip
every other generation. In my grandmother, it manifested as ESP.&nbsp;
She knew what was going to happen to people before it happened.&nbsp; In
me, the gift's manifestation is an acute sensitivity to the spirit world.&nbsp;
I've had many experiences with ghosts.&nbsp; Luckily, none have been violent
or terrifying.&nbsp; My first occured while driving to school one early
fall morning.&nbsp; I was passing the old civil war cemetary and saw a
misty lady dressed in antebellum style.&nbsp; It wasn't Halloween, so there's
no doubt in my mind that the lady was no longer of this Earth.&nbsp; The
next event was on a walk with a friend.&nbsp; We stopped in a vacant lot,
and standing there, I got a horrifying picture in my mind of a room with
a rag throw rug, a rocking chair, and dark paneled walls with blood spattereed
everywhere.&nbsp; I later found out that a house had stood there, but had
been knocked down and covered over because no one would by it after a young
mad killed his grandmother there during the depression.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next experience took me far from home.&nbsp;
I spent three summers working on Mackinac Island in Michigan.&nbsp; One
day I went to visit a friend.&nbsp; Mackinac Island houses most of it's
summer employees in bording houses.&nbsp; As I walked into this one, I
got the feeling of total despair and felt as though I were being choked
or sufficated.&nbsp; I had to get out of there.&nbsp; As soon as I was
outside, I felt fine again.&nbsp; I later found out that a student had
hung themself in that building about 10 years prior.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I was married, my husband was stationed
in Germany at what used to be a Nazi prison camp.&nbsp; I nearly commited
suicide myself there due to the constant overwhelming feelings of dread
and despair that emmanated from that place.&nbsp; Nearer to home, we moved
into a duplex when we returned to the States.&nbsp; At one time, it had
been a very nice single family dwelling.&nbsp; I knew it was haunted when
I moved in.&nbsp; The spirit only manifested itself once.&nbsp; I was in
the kitchen, looking for my scissors.&nbsp; I mumbled to myself about not
being able to find the darned things and next thing I knew, they were sliding
down the counter toward me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My grandparents former residence
was haunted by thier dog.&nbsp; After the dog died, my grandfather woke
in the middle of the night several times.&nbsp; He swore that he heard
Muffin bark to be let out and was usually at the back door when the jingle
of her dog tags disappeared.&nbsp; One night during a visit, my husband
woke to the same jingle and woke me up to ask me what it was.&nbsp; I told
him "It's just Muffin. Go back to sleep".&nbsp; In the morning, he asked
"Who's Muffin?"&nbsp; You should have seen his face when I told him it
was my grandparents dog that had been dead for 3 years!&nbsp; Muffin no
longer haunts the house.&nbsp; She disappeared entirley after my grandfather
died.&nbsp; I believe that she was there because she was lonely.</b>

<p><b>Ghost Stories of My Grandparents</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: chrismoss8@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My house is a house of haunting. Fist, when I was just a baby girl,
my</b>
<br><b>grandparents owned this house. Well when my grandfather passed away
on a</b>
<br><b>cold February morning, I inherited the house. My family moved in.
Since the</b>
<br><b>age of four, every February, strange things would occur. Strange
things such</b>
<br><b>as the time the was pounding on our basement door and hitting and
kicking</b>
<br><b>walls in the basement. Then, after about a half and hour, it would
stop! We</b>
<br><b>could never explain these crazy actions. Then, one time, when the
whole</b>
<br><b>house was asleep, my mother was just waking up. She heard my door
open and</b>
<br><b>slam. She peeked out of her door to see me walk by, since our upstairs
is</b>
<br><b>very small, and she saw nothing. All she heard was the bathroom,
right next</b>
<br><b>to her bedroom in the hall, slam shut! Well, she started to get
worried</b>
<br><b>because I had been in there a very long time. She went to check
on me and no</b>
<br><b>one was in the bathroom. She opened my door, and I was sound asleep.
The</b>
<br><b>ghost of my Grandfather would often slam our banister around on
the wall to</b>
<br><b>scare my mom when she was alone. After time passed by, and I moved
my room</b>
<br><b>to the basement, things stopped. The haunting ended. Unfortunately,
my</b>
<br><b>grandmother died much later. Right after her death, I became the
first out</b>
<br><b>of three other family members to hear her talk. You could never
understand</b>
<br><b>what she was saying. It always sounded like a muffled whisper in
your ear,</b>
<br><b>as if she was trying to tell you something. I personally believe
that she</b>
<br><b>was saying her goodbyes. I know my friends and I should never have
done</b>
<br><b>this, but we did a s&eacute;ance. We proceeded all the steps perfectly,
Everyone</b>
<br><b>was a little bit skeptical. Well, I suddenly heard her whispers
again. My</b>
<br><b>one friend felt a powerful chill that made her feel uneasy. We looked
over</b>
<br><b>and her part of the circle was broken open. Coincidence? I think
not! Well,</b>
<br><b>then we heard a pounding noise on the table across the room. All
of us</b>
<br><b>quickly got scarred, so we ended the s&eacute;ance and left the
circle. My younger</b>
<br><b>sister came running down the stairs because my family had gotten
mad at us</b>
<br><b>for all the noise. But, how could we make so much noise if we couldn't
leave</b>
<br><b>the circle? Well, then we knew we couldn't explain any of the noises,
but it</b>
<br><b>was truly my grandmothers spirit. Truly, if you can not explain
what you</b>
<br><b>see, hear, or feel, then there must be no other explanation. Just
learn to</b>
<br><b>keep your eyes open and stay aware of the possibilities. You never
know what</b>
<br><b>could happen next!</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I was 12 I have seen things and felt pressences,
They started</b>
<br><b>when I was living in Ohio, we had moved to the house when I was
8, the</b>
<br><b>house was only about 6-8 years old when we moved into it, the owners
had</b>
<br><b>lived in it then sold it to us, so no one else had lived there that
had</b>
<br><b>died or anything. I dont know about what could have been there before</b>
<br><b>the house was built, anyways, It was a warm sunny summer day, I
walked</b>
<br><b>down the hall to the bathroom from my bedroom, there stood my mom</b>
<br><b>dressed in a long dress with a apron over it and a bonet, she had
spiral</b>
<br><b>curls, I said mom why are you dressed that way, hot as it is? No
answer,</b>
<br><b>so I said well when your done I need to use the restroom, I went
into</b>
<br><b>the kitchen, there stood my mom dressed in shorts and a short sleeved</b>
<br><b>blouse, I said how did you change so fast? she looked at me like
I was</b>
<br><b>crazy and said what are you talkig about? I havent changed. I told
her</b>
<br><b>what I had saw, she had a strange look on her face, I went back
into the</b>
<br><b>bathroom, the lady was gone but I saw her standing in the hallway,
near</b>
<br><b>my bedroom door, I said who are you? what do you want? She looked
at me</b>
<br><b>then smiled and disappered. I ran back to the kitchen where my mom
was,</b>
<br><b>very scared,&nbsp; I never saw the women again, but from time to
time heard</b>
<br><b>footsteps&nbsp; in the hallway, felt cold air&nbsp; in the hallway,&nbsp;
my music box</b>
<br><b>would play wthout being opened sometimes, and I would feel like
someone</b>
<br><b>was around, but never saw anything I always felt like the house
was</b>

<p><b>Is tThis a Ghost?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DeliaVilla@wincup.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>On three separate occasions three different people have heard someone
come</b>
<br><b>in from the garage into our laundry room and put their keys down.&nbsp;
We all</b>
<br><b>heard the doors open and close and the keys.&nbsp; We wait for someone
to come</b>
<br><b>through the laundry room door to the hall way but no one comes in.&nbsp;
We go to</b>
<br><b>the laundry room and into the garage and no one is there.&nbsp;
On two separate</b>
<br><b>occasions just one person was home and no one else.</b>
<br><b>This last Sunday, my husband and I were getting ready to go out.&nbsp;
He decided</b>
<br><b>to wear his black cowboy boots, so he looked for his black belt
that matched</b>
<br><b>his boots.&nbsp; This belt is a thick long belt with a large, oval
buckle.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>husband is a very organized person and has a rack where he hangs
his belts</b>
<br><b>and ties.&nbsp;&nbsp; He told me he could not find his belt, so
I helped him look.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>ran my fingers through all this ties and belts on the rack.&nbsp;
He looked on</b>
<br><b>the floor incase the belt had fallen from the rack.&nbsp; He brought
a chair to</b>
<br><b>look on the top shelf incase he had put it there. We could not find
it</b>
<br><b>anyplace.&nbsp; I told my husband "maybe our son borrowed it"&nbsp;
although my son</b>
<br><b>does not wear what his dad wears.&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband put on
another black belt.</b>
<br><b>We went off to visit family and returned about 7:00 p.m..&nbsp;
Later I went to</b>
<br><b>bed and saw my husband take off his belt and went to hang it on
the rack.</b>
<br><b>He said "The belt is hanging on the rack".&nbsp; I could not believe
it.&nbsp; My son</b>
<br><b>was watching TV in the next room so I told my husband to ask him
if he had</b>
<br><b>borrowed it and put it back.&nbsp; My son laughed, "why should I
wear a belt like</b>
<br><b>that", It wasn't a belt he would ever wear, but I thought we would
ask</b>
<br><b>anyway.&nbsp; I got out of bed to see where the belt was hanging.&nbsp;
The buckle was</b>
<br><b>large and hanging over the rack and the belt hung lower than the
ties and</b>
<br><b>other belts. (too obvious).&nbsp; The belt was not on the rack when
we looked</b>
<br><b>earlier.&nbsp; We are absolutely sure my son would not wear a cowboy
belt.</b>

<p><b>Ghost in my Room!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Crazyupsidedown@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Some people think just because I'm young they think it's my imagination
when</b>
<br><b>I see ghost. I'm 12 years old and this happened when I was about
6 or 7. I</b>
<br><b>was playing at my best friends house in his basement, I never liked
his</b>
<br><b>basement is was always so big and dark. When he said lets have a
race</b>
<br><b>downstairs, Tory his little sister went running down first when
she tripped</b>
<br><b>and fell down the stairs, but it was like something was holding
her up from</b>
<br><b>falling and hurting herself.When we got down there Tory was just
sitting</b>
<br><b>there on the floor like nothing happened. This one happened in my
house, I</b>
<br><b>thought I had a bad dream but I was awake, ( my eyes were open and
I was</b>
<br><b>having a bad dream at the same time) the dream was I was in my room
when</b>
<br><b>something popped out from under my bed and grabbed me. I screamed
until my</b>
<br><b>parents came in and found me on the floor, that happened until my
parents</b>
<br><b>got me a new bed. We also changed the color of my room because I
said I</b>
<br><b>could see shadows from under my new bed like someone was still there.About
a</b>
<br><b>mouth ago I got all my courage to talk to the person under my bed,
it really</b>
<br><b>was a little girl who needed a friend to talk to. My mother thinks
I'm crazy</b>
<br><b>because she sees me talking to walls, and teddy bears. The girls
name is</b>
<br><b>Jennifer and she likes to play with all my stuff, she'll play hiding
games</b>
<br><b>with my stuff and put them in places I wouldn't look and she really
likes my</b>
<br><b>dog Snoopsie, Jennifer would chase the dog around my room and put
my t.v and</b>
<br><b>radio on in the night. She is really nice and if she likes you she'll
pull</b>
<br><b>on your shirt. One time I asked her why she was in my house and

<br><b>Ghost in Michigan</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: vcoonrod@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I and my first husband lived in Michigan about 1984, we had
a ghost in the house.&nbsp; It was a fairly old farm house with a basement.&nbsp;
My husband and I would hear foot steps upstairs when we were down in the
basement.&nbsp; The water would also turn itself on in our bathroom.&nbsp;
Of course, we figured we could explain this stuff outside of using the
supernatural to do it.</b>
<br><b>The strangest part though, was that I awoke at least twice and found
an older thin man standing next to my bed looking down at me.&nbsp; This
happened over the course of a year.&nbsp; Then he would simply disapear.</b>
<br><b>Another odd thing that happened in that house, was that I awoke
one night and saw a tiny ball of light zoom across the room like a pinball
a few times before it disappeared.</b>
<br><b>I actually got so upset at the ghost that I pleaded with it to stop
it and go away.&nbsp; We moved shortly after that to Washington State,
so it became a moot point.&nbsp; I have not had any other ghosts in any
other homes I have had since that time.</b>
<br><b>I never felt like the ghost accepted us in the house.&nbsp; I often
wonder how the people who live there now are faring.</b>
<br><b>I know this sounds weird but it is all true.</b><b></b>

I, was</b>
<br><b>sleeping on the floor in my den(bedroom was being painted) and I
woke up out</b>
<br><b>of a sound sleep to see a dogs snout up in the air. I could only
see its</b>
<br><b>snout nothing less. I ignored it and went back to sleep. My faithful</b>
<br><b>companion,(dog) Wolf died when I first moved here and he loved me
ditto. So</b>
<br><b>I told my mom and dad and they believed me(IN A WAY) And another
time when I</b>
<br><b>was in my room I was woken out of a sound sleep to see a figure,
jet black</b>
<br><b>stand at my doorway. I ignored it. It woke me up again and I looked
and it</b>
<br><b>was Closer...Again and it was closer. The final time it woke me
up and it</b>
<br><b>was gone. It woke me up again and&nbsp; A Different figure was there.
It didn't wake</b>
<br><b>me up again. Well, atleast a year passed by and noting happened..until
one</b>
<br><b>night when I was sitting on my living room floor eating a sandwich
and my</b>
<br><b>dog on my right. There was a table and chair on my left. I was minding
my own</b>

by</b>

scared</b>
<br><b>since. On our cellar door we have a chain to lock it. I cant reach
it, my mom</b>
<br><b>doesn't lock it because she does laundry. etc., and I cant reach
it. For 4</b>
<br><b>days it was getting locked by itself!!!! Another is my mom went
outside to</b>
<br><b>lock her care and something behind her with BIG foot steps was chasing
her!</b>
<br><b>She has a bad back and never runs, BUT she did! We played a Quija

<p><b>There is a Ghost Here!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jdravn@norcom.net.au</b><b></b>
<p><b>About two years ago I went around to my (now ex) girlfriend's house
for the first time, meet her family and stuff.</b>
<br><b>They have a games room set up with a pool table and bar. We were
shooting some pool and so on. I was sitting on a bar stool when I felt
something tug at my shorts.</b>
<br><b>I immediatelt thought it was my ex-girlfriends 18 month old daughter
who was wandering around. I looked down but it wasn't her, there was no-one
there. I noticed the daughter in another room.</b>
<br><b>My instant reaction was geez - there is a ghost in this house.</b>
<br><b>Up until that time I had never thought about ghosts and was probably
more of a skeptic than a believer. My theory was I would believe it when
I see it.</b>
<br><b>Well, I believed straight away. Although I didn't see anything I
definitely felt something tug at my shorts.</b>
<br><b>I didn't mention it straight away because I was meeting the family
for the first time and I didn't think I would make a good impression by
announcing to them that they had a ghost in the house.</b>
<br><b>So I mentioned it later to my ex girlfriend , when we were alone.
She just laughed and said oh yeah, that's our friendly ghost.</b>
<br><b>Apparantly the whole family is aware of the ghost and it has always
been in their house and they accept it as a matter of fact and part of
daily life.</b>
<br><b>She told me it was a friendly, playful ghost, like the ghost of
a young child. It turns the TV on and off when they are watching, moves
toys around, and stuff like that.</b>
<br><b>They were interested that I had felt its presence (literally, because
it tugged my shorts), but not surprised.</b>
<br><b>We never really talked about it again and we broke up not long after.
I went to the house a few times when we were going out but never noticed
the ghost again.</b>
<br><b>For some reason I have never really thought about it much until
recently when I saw an old friend and she asked me if I was still an avowed
atheist.</b>
<br><b>I have always been strongly atheistic and a non-believer in God
and cynical of organised religion.</b>
<br><b>However, my experience with the ghost has forced me to reassess
my beliefs.</b>

<br><b>Trail Haunts</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was about 13 or 14 years old,I was exploring woods and a feild
which</b>
<br><b>we owned. There was a trail down through the woods which I was following
and</b>
<br><b>I came to a small open feild that I liked to go to and spend time.

<br><b>very beautiful spot and I spent a lot of time there. I happened
to have my</b>
<br><b>shotgun with me and my dog was ranging around sniffing things out
as dogs</b>
<br><b>will do. He jumped a rabbit and as it ran past me, I sighted on
it swinging</b>
<br><b>the gun barrel in the direction it was running. As I neared the
end of the</b>
<br><b>arc of the swing,I saw a figure out of the corner of my eye and
pulled the</b>
<br><b>gun barrel up quickly,thinking that some one was standing near me
and would</b>
<br><b>be in my line of fire. I lowered the gunbarrel and looked in that
direction.</b>
<br><b>I could see a figure standing near a brush pile within 10 or 15
feet of me.</b>
<br><b>He had a beard,a blanket or bedroll across his body and was carrying
a musket</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>This experience didn't happen to me directly, but I felt it and
heard my</b>
<br><b>uncle scream downstairs when it tried to suffocate him. Mostly to
my cousin</b>
<br><b>and grandmother who have witnesses to it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it started with just random bumps
in the night. Then my cousin</b>
<br><b>began to feel things happening. She would get cold and feel like
someone was</b>
<br><b>touching her. One night she turned around and saw a teenage boy
standing</b>
<br><b>there. He looked like he was medieval france or something because
he had the</b>
<br><b>old ruffled shirt and belt buckle shoes. The boy was around her
age (14 or 15</b>
<br><b>give or take) and he was just kind of staring. Then she got up and
went into</b>
<br><b>the kitchen where she played cards. Nobody knows why, even her,
she just did</b>
<br><b>it. Then she like came out of the trance type thing and felt cold.
The boy</b>
<br><b>had vanished, but she still felt cold. She then went into my grandmother's</b>
<br><b>room and slept there with my grandmother.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next night, she was in the living room playing
video games. The boy</b>
<br><b>returned and was just sort of watching her. She tried to ignore
him but he</b>
<br><b>didn't leave until she got up and went into my grandmother's room.
That night</b>
<br><b>she heard the tv turn on and when she came into the living room
all the video</b>
<br><b>game stuff was out, even though she had put it away.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next few days things like that randomly
happened. The ghost would</b>
<br><b>appear and would tell it to go away. It would, but return the next
few</b>
<br><b>nights. The next serioud encounter she was when she was about to
fall asleep.</b>
<br><b>A girl's voice screamed into her ear. My cousin woke up and ran
to Grandma's</b>
<br><b>room. Another experience with my cousin was when she was in the
shower. She</b>
<br><b>felt like someone was touching her around her waist. She turned,
but nothing</b>
<br><b>was there. She got the same cold feeling, but still saw no one.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next few nights nothing happened. My cousin
was left alone. It was my</b>
<br><b>Grandmother who had the next experience. She was closing the doors
in the</b>
<br><b>house (a habbit of hers) when she heard a slam. She turned to find
all the</b>
<br><b>doors open. She turned to her own door (which she had opened) and
it was</b>
<br><b>closed. She opened it to go in but didn't sense anything or get
the cold</b>
<br><b>feeling my cousin did, but it scared her.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next experience was with my grandmother
also. She had her mail</b>
<br><b>sitting on her bed. She had turned around one moment to change the
channel on</b>
<br><b>her tv or something and when she turned to her mail, it was gone.
She looked</b>
<br><b>around and saw nothing. My cousin was in the room and she saw the
mail gone</b>
<br><b>too. My cousin searched the house for it, but couldn't find it.
When my aunt</b>
<br><b>got home, she found the mail in a neat pile in the driveway. She
brought it</b>
<br><b>upstairs and suggested that it might have blown out the window.
Except that</b>
<br><b>the window was closed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final experience, I witnessed.
Or heard rather. My cousins and I</b>
<br><b>usually sleep on the floor in the living room (six of us all together
crammed</b>
<br><b>on the living room floor). I remember suddenly waking up and feeling
very</b>
<br><b>cold. I was too frightened to move because I had this fear someone
might see</b>
<br><b>me, even though no one was awake except me. I heard it downstairs.
The noise</b>
<br><b>woke up my cousin and she too lay there in the same fightened state
as me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We suddenly heard my uncle (who lives
downstairs with my aunt and two</b>
<br><b>cousins) shout like he was trying to breathe. Marissa (my cousin
who was the</b>
<br><b>first to see the boy ghost) looked at me like 'what was that?'.
Eventually we</b>
<br><b>fell asleep.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning at breakfast my uncle
came upstairs looking like he had</b>
<br><b>a bad night sleep. When we asked what happened he explained that
he had a</b>
<br><b>dream a black tall figure was leaning over him and tried to choke
him. At</b>
<br><b>first the black figure suceeded, until uncle let out his shout (which
Marissa</b>
<br><b>and I heard). When Uncle woke up from his dream he saw nothing,
except his</b>
<br><b>door open. He knew he closed it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever since then the ghost (or ghosts if
you count the girl and the black</b>
<br><b>figure) have toned it down a bit and went back to the 'bumps in
the night'</b>
<br><b>they started with.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't really explain any of it and I
have had moments where I'm too</b>
<br><b>scared to move in that house. I see shadows and figures out of the
corner or</b>
<br><b>my eye, but nothing ever attacked me or stalked me. That's pretty
much it as</b>
<br><b>far as I know.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really would like someone to possibly
explain it, since it's odd that</b>
<br><b>they do this. If anyone could help that would be great. Thankyou
and that's</b>
<br><b>about it for my ghost experience.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once when I was about 13 my brother and I were
sitting in our breakfast room playing cards.&nbsp; I got up to fix a glass
of water.&nbsp; We were laughing and joking, when out of the corner of
my eye I saw what I thought was my father coming in from the next room.&nbsp;
He threw something into the trash knocking the can over.&nbsp; He just
turned to walk away.&nbsp; A little irritated I said " I guess I'll get
that!"&nbsp; Only then did I see the look on my brothers face,&nbsp; I
turned to see what&nbsp; he was looking at.&nbsp; In the doorway was a
figure, built like my father( a rather big man), wearing a plaid shirt
and jeans, yet he had no real facial features.&nbsp; He was standing there
looking back at us.&nbsp; Then as quickly as he came in he faded out.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We both saw the same thing at the same time, I know we didn't dream it!&nbsp;
We are not the only ones that have seen this man, but those are stories

<p><b>Gettysburg Ghosts</b><b></b>

<p><b>I went to school at Gettysburg College and along with hearing several
campus</b>
<br><b>ghost stories, I saw something there that I can't explain.</b>
<br><b>Now, I certainly did my share of partying in college and I'm sure
that some</b>
<br><b>of things that I saw as undergrad were self-induced. However, on
this day I</b>
<br><b>had not been out the night before and was very clear of mind at
the time.</b>
<br><b>It was during the Spring in my freshman year (1985); I was biking
through</b>
<br><b>the battlefields on a Sunday afternoon. As I was going down the
road</b>
<br><b>somewhere between the Wheatfield and the Round Tops, I passed a
man who was</b>
<br><b>standing on a rock. He was dark-haired and bearded, wearing a Union
uniform</b>
<br><b>(a NY regiment, I think. I nodded good morning, thinking it was
a reenactor.</b>
<br><b>The figure nodded back and as I passed him, something odd struck
me about</b>
<br><b>him. A few yards past, I looked over my shoulder to check the man
out again</b>
<br><b>and there was no one on the rock or nearby. There was no real cover
around -</b>
<br><b>it seemed like the figure simply disappeared.</b>
<br><b>To this day, I'm fairly certain that I saw a ghost.</b>

<br><b>This saturday night, I went to Gettysburg and took part in the Farnsworth</b>
<br><b>House cellar Ghost Stories.&nbsp; The storyteller was great.&nbsp;
During the stories,</b>
<br><b>my hair on my left sholulder moved as if I had turned my head.&nbsp;
I did not</b>
<br><b>turn my head.&nbsp; I was sitting still and had my eyes intent on
the storyteller.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Afterwards, we stopped in the Tavern for a bite to eat.&nbsp;
While there, we</b>
<br><b>spoke with one of the servers about the stories.&nbsp; She said
there was several</b>
<br><b>spirits in the house and, in particular, a 6 yr old spirit that
likes to play</b>
<br><b>with your hair.&nbsp; My mouth dropped!&nbsp; That must have been
what I felt.&nbsp; At the</b>

<br><b>House Of Haunts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: chathamcashier@on.aibn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have entered a couple of other incidents Ihave had with the paranormal
and decided that this would be a good one to submit also.</b>
<br><b>My husband and I along with our three children moved into a three
bedroom bungalow.&nbsp; The house was approximately 100 years old but was
a little too small for our family.</b>
<br><b>After residing there for approximately six months we decided that
it was time for us to buy our first house.&nbsp; We had the opportunity
to purchase the house that we presently resided in but upon careful consideration
decided that there wasn't enough room for the size of our family.</b>
<br><b>This is when things started happening.</b>
<br><b>I had managed to get some background on the house from some neighbours
before any of the occurences and don't know if anything can be attributed
to this.</b>
<br><b>Before we moved into the house a single elderly lady owned it.&nbsp;
She resided there alone and had lived there her whole life.&nbsp; Her father
being the person who built the house.&nbsp; She did not use electricity
and did not even own a fridge.&nbsp; This is not that unusual as some people
still believe in living the way they were accustomed to during their rearing
days.&nbsp; This lady was very sickly and had a sister who would come and
help to take care of her . Unfortunately this sister passed away and she
was left to fend for herself.&nbsp; People seemed surprised at this because
the sister was reported to be in excellent health.&nbsp; Anyway the lady
who resided in the house was relocated to a nursing home and this is how
my landlord came upon owning the property.</b>
<br><b>Now to get back to the details .</b>
<br><b>I was laying in bed one morning just after my children left for
school.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was awake but my eyes were closed and I was contemplating
either getting up or going back to sleep.&nbsp; I felt someone climb into
the bed beside me and lay down.&nbsp; I thought to myself why in the heck
wasn't my husband at work?&nbsp; I rolled over facing his side of the bed
and opened my eyes getting ready to berate him for taking the day off.&nbsp;
To my shock and surprise no one was there.&nbsp; I called for him and no
answer.&nbsp; I just dismissed it as my imagination and didn't give it
any more thought.</b>
<br><b>Not long after this always in the morning there would be banging
and scratching coming from my living room either from behind my wall unit
or from the front door.&nbsp; My bedroom was directly off of the living
room so I was always waken up by the noise.&nbsp; And I mean noise.&nbsp;
Loud banging.&nbsp; The first time I heard it I thought maybe a stray cat
or something had got in the house somehow.&nbsp; Upon further investigation
I found out there was no animal in the house.&nbsp; I became so accustomed
to the noises waking me up that one day I just screamed for it to shutup
and quit bugging me.&nbsp; Well thats not exactly what I said but you get
the gist of it.&nbsp; All of a sudden the noises stopped.&nbsp; I didn't
have any more problems for at least a couple of more months.</b>
<br><b>We had put a bid on a house and were quite excited .&nbsp; I was
laying in bed one night doing crossword puzzles.&nbsp; My husband had just
got home from afternoons and was taking a shower.&nbsp; I distinctly heard
a voice whisper my name right beside my ear.&nbsp; I said What?&nbsp; Thinking
that my husband had called me but was still confused as to why it sounded
so close.&nbsp; I went into the bathroom and asked if he had called me
.&nbsp; He then told me I was losing my mind when I proceeded to tell him
what had happened.&nbsp; Maybe it was the wind he said.&nbsp; Yeah right
on a balmy summer night with no wind at all.&nbsp; The funny thing was
that no one else experienced anything out of the ordinary in the house
.&nbsp; Upon moving out I actually felt saddened because I honestly had
the feeling that whatever this spirit was it didn't want me to go and only
annoyed me because I was moving out.&nbsp; At no time did I ever feel threatened
by it but when it said my name in my ear I can honestly say that it scared
the ---- out of me!</b>
<br><b>The house that we bought was an old nuns convent .&nbsp; Its a beautiful
older house and right now and thus far I have nothing to report to you
about this house and hope that I never do.</b>
<br><b>By the way, I am totally sane!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Germantown Road, Portland, OR</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lsartain@gateway.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>What do you make of this?&nbsp; There is an area in Portland, Oregon,
that whenever I'm near it, I feel absolute terror!.&nbsp; The first time
I felt it I was grown, and a friend and I had been driving around on a
Sunday afternoon, beautiful day, and were parked on a hill in outskirts
of Portland, trees overhanging the car, and although the conversation was
about things we had very much enjoyed, I began to be uneasy and within
half-hour, felt I had to get away from there.&nbsp; It was around 5-6 in
the evening.&nbsp; The name of the place was Germantown Road.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I came to learn that any time I was near there, I felt absolute terror,
even knowing we were going the other direction, or in a different part
of the city.</b>
<br><b>We went (a band) to play a job in Clatskanie, OR, and didn't go
in that direction, but coming home, although I had gone to sleep in the
car, a woke with that same unexplainable fear.&nbsp; Knowing we hadn't
gone in that direction, but the fear was so strong, I asked, Are we anywhere
around Germantown Road?&nbsp; The driver said "Yes, it's about a quarter-mile
ahead of us".</b>
<br><b>I was driving a small truck for a blueprint company and was to deliver
some blueprints to a company in that direction- there was only one main
road along the river leading to and past Germantown Road,&nbsp; and I was
really apprehensive about driving it.&nbsp; It was raining, and bad weather,
but also how do you tell an employer you're afraid to go there??&nbsp;
So I drove in that direction, knowing it would be bad, but for some reason
there was no fear.&nbsp; I could not understand it.&nbsp; But it was as
if something watching over me knew I didn't have to go that far, so there
was no necessity for the fear. (Sure was relieved to turn around and go
back.)</b>
<br><b>I grew up in Northeast Portland, an had only been to St.Johns (neighborhood)
a few times with mother to visit people she went to school with in Idaho,
and cannot associate any fear with those visits.</b>
<br><b>I had no other reason to ever be in that part of the city.&nbsp;
The Columbia River flows through Portland, and we were on the east side
near the airport, in an area strange to me because of sandy ground, and
although I was with my brother and friends I felt safe with, that same
fear was coming over me again-&nbsp; but I couldn't be near Germantown
Road, because that was on the West side and out by St Johns district.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Walking to where the others were talking though, I saw the lights of the
St. Johns Bridge in the distance, and we were across the river from it.</b>
<br><b>The only time I've ever felt this fear was when I was near a place
called Germantown Road.&nbsp; The fear is so strong I can almost see what
happens:&nbsp; I'm in a car, someone I'm with is outside the car, and a
dark something comes around the side of the car-&nbsp; there is violence
and maybe death, at the front side of the car fender.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dark
form is large and bulky, I think of the shape of a bear, but it could be
anything.</b>
<br><b>We've lived a lot of places (retired Navy) but that's the only place
I've felt that fear.</b>
<br><b>Have you heard of anyone else with that location?</b>

<br><b>smaller office spaces.&nbsp; My company used to rent one of these
spaces.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>upstairs (former projection room and balcony) often was colder then
the</b>
<br><b>downstairs offices and had a "hostile" energy.&nbsp; Nobody liked
to go upstairs</b>
<br><b>(which was used as a storage area) because you could feel somebody
watching</b>
<br><b>you from the projection room.&nbsp; One time I attempted to go into
the projection</b>
<br><b>room with a co-worker (to see what was really going on in there)
and I can't</b>
<br><b>describe the over whelming terror.&nbsp; To get to the projection
room you had to</b>
<br><b>cross through 2 smaller rooms - the closer we got to the projection
room the</b>
<br><b>colder it got.&nbsp; We looked in but didn't actually enter the
room and quickly</b>
<br><b>went back downstairs.&nbsp; On several occasions we heard what sounding
like a kid</b>
<br><b>bouncing a ball and running back and forth but nobody was up there.&nbsp;
There</b>
<br><b>were a lot of times I was in my office alone (it was a family business)
and</b>
<br><b>the othe!</b>
<br><b>r offices were closed and I would hear sounds from upstairs or the
door would</b>
<br><b>start rattling like somebody was trying to come out (the door locked
from the</b>
<br><b>inside of the office - so nobody that was upstairs could open it
from that</b>
<br><b>side of the door).&nbsp; There were several times I would run into
the office late</b>
<br><b>at night to pick up or drop something off and could feel something
watching</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; The other wierd thing was that I had a solar calculator
that regularly</b>
<br><b>sits on my desk - it often had a wierd display on it when I came
in in the</b>
<br><b>morning.&nbsp; On several occasions I would leave it on the center
of a cleared</b>
<br><b>off desk with a certain number on it only to find it had a different
display</b>
<br><b>on it in the morning.&nbsp; I would only do this on those days where
I knew I</b>
<br><b>would be the last out of the office and 1st in the next day because
I didn't</b>
<br><b>want anybody to think I was ghost crazy.&nbsp; No matter where I
put it in the</b>
<br><b>office the display would always be messed up.&nbsp; I am now in
a new office and</b>
<br><b>sti!</b>
<br><b>ll have the calculator.&nbsp; To this day I have never been able
to get it to do</b>

<p><b>Part Of the Family</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: whpoohbear@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello my name is Wendy. I have not had the experience of seing any</b>
<br><b>spirits but I have had the experience of living with a spirit all
of my</b>
<br><b>life.Let me explain.</b>
<br><b>My parents had brought a home in a small town in New Jersey. Come
to</b>
<br><b>find out it was the oldest house in the town and that it had been
a</b>
<br><b>slave shack back in the days when George Washington was alive.</b>
<br><b>Since I was a kid we would always heard&nbsp; what sounded like
footsteps</b>
<br><b>through the house . We always put it off as the house setteling
because</b>
<br><b>it was such an old house. Let me tell you, we did not have alot
of money</b>
<br><b>so we could not do alot of fixing up and this house did look like
a</b>
<br><b>haunted house</b>
<br><b>Well the noises continued. Than my mother is a person who has a
green</b>
<br><b>thumb, she loves having plants.&nbsp; Well we started noticing that
every few</b>
<br><b>days when we would go towater the plants that the plants would still
be</b>
<br><b>soaking wet. It got to the point that some of the plants were dieing</b>
<br><b>because of to much watering.&nbsp; She tried blaming us but we had
not done</b>
<br><b>it.</b>
<br><b>So after that we would always joke around abouavn a ghost in the
house</b>
<br><b>even thoughwe never saw anything.</b>
<br><b>We were really convinced in 1986 when we finally saved money to
fix up</b>
<br><b>the house.&nbsp; We had hired friends of the family to come and
tear the back</b>
<br><b>part of the house off.&nbsp; They had told us as the started tearing
it down</b>
<br><b>they thought they heard moaning or crying sounds coming from inside.</b>
<br><b>Things really started happening when we started the renovatios.My
sister</b>
<br><b>,her husband and I were doing all the work instead of hiring people.</b>
<br><b>Many times we would be working in one part of the house and we would</b>
<br><b>hear footsteps and people walking on the above floor.&nbsp; When
we would go</b>
<br><b>up to look of course no one was there. things would be movedfrom
one</b>
<br><b>room to another and who ever it is loves pencils because they would</b>
<br><b>always steal the pencils we were working with</b>
<br><b>A friend of our who is an electrician thought we were nuts, until
one</b>
<br><b>day when he was working on the third floor and he needed something
out</b>
<br><b>in his truck.&nbsp; When he got back a;; the tools he was worikng
with were</b>
<br><b>gone. He tried blaming his father but his father was outside with
him.</b>
<br><b>After looking around he wend down in the cellar and there sitting
on a</b>
<br><b>bench was all his tools.&nbsp; He was so scared he would never go
into the</b>
<br><b>house by himself again.</b>
<br><b>We finally got the house done and moved back in. We did not hear
much of</b>
<br><b>footsteps but things would start disappearing then showing up in
the</b>
<br><b>same places weeks&nbsp; later.</b>
<br><b>Than one day I was in the house by myself when I heard some one
call my</b>
<br><b>name, I didn't think much about it because it sounded like my mother
soI</b>
<br><b>went down stirs to see what she wanted but no one was there.&nbsp;
That</b>
<br><b>experience happened many times and Inever said anything untillmy
mother</b>
<br><b>said the same thing happened to her but the voice sunded like mine.</b>
<br><b>So who ever we have living in the house with us we fell it is a
women. I</b>
<br><b>have moved out but who ever is in the house is stil there and we
just</b>
<br><b>consider it a part of the family now.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;Prenatal Hauntings</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp; When I first became pregnant, I did not even know.&nbsp; I
was going to cosmetology school at the time, and a friend of mine knew
before I did.&nbsp; I was feeling real ill when I went to school that morning,
and Peggy just looked at me funny and asked if I was okay.&nbsp; I told
her that I must have the flu, and that I didn't feel real well.&nbsp; I
had just come out of the bathroom, when I had found out that I had just
started my period two and a half weeks too early, when Peggy stated that
I was pregnant.&nbsp; I told her that I couldn't be pregnant because I
had just started my period.&nbsp; She told me that I was pregnant with
a boy child, and that he would be due on June 15th.&nbsp; A month later,
I found out that I was pregnant and my baby was due on June 15th, ironically
this is also my birthday.&nbsp; But, during my pregnancy, I did not have
the chance to find out the sex of my baby.</b>
<br><b>I ended up with toxemia during this pregnancy, and had to go into
the hospital for two weeks in my eighth month of pregnancy.&nbsp; At the
end of my two week stay, the day I was to leave the hospital I had an encounter
with my future son.I was in the bed waiting for my husband to pick me up
when I saw this ghost standing there.&nbsp; He was about seventeen years
old, wearing a football uniform with the number 86, the colors were either
black and red or navy blue and red, and he was holding a football in the
crook of his arm.&nbsp; He smiled at me and walked towards me.&nbsp; When
he got over to me in the bed, he layed down ontop of me and entered my
body.&nbsp; I felt this tingling sensation, like when your foot falls asleep,
and a struggle between us.&nbsp; I tried to fight it because it scared
me at first.&nbsp; Then I gave in because I realized that this was my son,
his soul, entering my body.&nbsp; I told my husband when he arrived to
pick me up.&nbsp; I said to him, Anthony I just saw and meet our son.&nbsp;
He thought I was crazy.&nbsp; On June 4, 1991, my son David A. Goodman
was born, just about two weeks early because of complications.&nbsp; He
is eight years old now, and has a dream of becoming a professional football
player.&nbsp; I have not told him of this premonition or episode in my
life.&nbsp; Coincidence or what?&nbsp; We also seem to have this telapathic
link between us to date.&nbsp; I can say to David that we are going to
Dairy Queen for some ice cream, and think to myself about getting a banana
split, and David will blurt out I think I want a banana split...what's
in a banana split?&nbsp; This happened two weeks ago.&nbsp; He also knows
when I'm coming to pick him up from where he's at before I show up.&nbsp;
Weird little things like that.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Liberty Hall in Frankfort Kentucky</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Melinda.Howard@mail.state.ky.us</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This is perhaps one of the oldest ghost stories in Frankfort.&nbsp;
However,</b>
<br><b>it's not just a story to me anymore......</b><b></b>
<p><b>Liberty Hall's construction started in 1796 and was finished in 1801.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>two &amp; a half story mansion was built for one of Kentucky's first
senators,</b>
<br><b>John Brown.&nbsp; In 1799, John married Margaretta Mason from New
York and they</b>
<br><b>moved into the mansion upon it's completion with their first son&nbsp;
Mason.</b>
<br><b>One year later their second son Orlando was born.&nbsp; Then two
sons both</b>
<br><b>named Alfred were born &amp; died in 1802 &amp; 1803.&nbsp; Finally,
in 1807 a girl,</b>
<br><b>Euphemia Helen,&nbsp; was born unto the Brown family.</b>
<br><b>On October 1, 1814, Euphemia became very ill &amp; died.&nbsp; An
aunt of</b>
<br><b>Margaretta traveled eight hundred miles from New York to comfort
her</b>
<br><b>neice, which proved even more tragic.&nbsp; Three days upon her
arrival the</b>
<br><b>aunt, who is said to be Mrs. Margaret Varick, fell ill from her
journey &amp;</b>
<br><b>died in the mansion.&nbsp; Mrs. Varick was buried in the mansion
gardens after</b>
<br><b>her death and later moved to a cemetary, but Mrs. Varick (or now
commonly</b>
<br><b>known as the Gray Lady) doesn't seem to have left Liberty Hall.&nbsp;
Many</b>
<br><b>people have reported eerie lights &amp; cold spots as well as the
apparition</b>
<br><b>of a woman in a gray dress......</b><b></b>
<p><b>Here begins my story....</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I live about a half mile from the mansion &amp; had heard
the rumors of the</b>
<br><b>haunts all my life.&nbsp; One warm summer night about two years
ago&nbsp; three</b>
<br><b>friends and I decide to sneak in the gardens out back (being the
little</b>
<br><b>hoodlums we were) &amp; check it out.&nbsp; We parked the car on
a dark street to</b>
<br><b>the right of the gardens in back and proceeded to walk up to the
concrete</b>
<br><b>wall that is supposed to keep out visitors after dark.&nbsp; The
wall is about</b>
<br><b>4 feet high so it took us a few minutes to climb over.&nbsp; Once
over the wall</b>
<br><b>I began having second thoughts about being there.&nbsp; It was creepy
&amp; the</b>
<br><b>only light source was coming from the street light on the opposite
side of</b>
<br><b>the street.&nbsp; The garden was beautiful though. Flowers &amp;
vines covered the</b>
<br><b>whole perimeter of the garden but even more amazing was the maze
of</b>
<br><b>trimmed, shaped bushes .&nbsp; The maze started at the back porch
of the</b>
<br><b>mansion&amp; led you to a sitting area with a bench &amp; some hanging
plants.</b>
<br><b>After walking through the maze the two guys with us decided to go
explore.</b>
<br><b>Needless to say, us two girls were too scared to move so we stayed
safely</b>
<br><b>on the bench huddled together.&nbsp; I'd say about ten minutes had
passed when</b>
<br><b>we noticed we were getting cold.&nbsp; We could see our breath &amp;
we both had</b>
<br><b>goosebumps which was odd since it was such a warm night. Then we
noticed a</b>
<br><b>small glowing ball of mist emerging from the maze. I must not have
been</b>
<br><b>able to move because I'm SURE I would have taken off as fast as
I could.</b>
<br><b>As the ball came closer it took on the shape of a woman in a long
dress.</b>
<br><b>We knew who it was, the gray lady. Before we could see anymore both
of us</b>
<br><b>ran straight out of there.&nbsp; We actually jumped that wall without
any</b>
<br><b>climbing or complications.&nbsp; Once outside the wall we wondered
if it hadn't</b>
<br><b>been those guys playing a cruel joke but we weren't going back in
there.</b>
<br><b>So we walked towards the car to notice the guys were already in
it!&nbsp; They</b>
<br><b>had gotten spooked as well and came looking for us.&nbsp; They looked
all over</b>
<br><b>the garden (even exactly where we were sitting, they didn't see
any sign</b>
<br><b>of us) so they figured we had gone back to the car.&nbsp; To our
suprise they</b>
<br><b>had been waiting for us for about half an hour when we&nbsp; had
only been on</b>
<br><b>the bench for about fifteen minutes..........or so we thought.&nbsp;
I will</b>
<br><b>never fully understand what happened that night.&nbsp; When the
guys came</b>
<br><b>looking for us why didn't they see us?&nbsp; how long were we really
in there?</b>
<br><b>Was the gray lady trying to scare us out of her garden? I guess
some</b>
<br><b>things just remain a mystery.........</b>

<br><b>Grandmother</b>
<br><b>By:micheal.f@ntlworld.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Over forty years ago as a six-year-old child, something very
strange happened to me. I remember like it was yesterday.</b>
<br><b>In bed one night, I awoke needing to go to the toilet; it must have
been very late at night, because the house was in total darkness and everyone
was in bed. In this house our bathroom was downstairs, but I was not afraid
to go down alone in the middle of the night. We had a dog, which slept,
in the kitchen. I opened the bedroom door and walked onto the landing,
turning around to close the bedroom door. I did not want to wake my brother,
who shared the bedroom with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As I turned towards the stairs, I froze in my tracks, in front of me stood
an old lady. She was dressed in what looked like to me a wedding dress
and a veil; only they were grey and not white. She stared at me saying
nothing, but this didnt bother me, I wasnt scared at all. I tried to
speak to her, but no words would come from my mouth. I tried again and
the same thing happened. Then realising something was wrong, I tried to
turn and walk away, but I could not move. Then I realised the horror of
the situation that I couldnt move or speak. This terrified me. The few
seconds that this lasted, seemed like an eternity. The next thing I remembered
was running back to my bed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The next day I told my mother about what had happened, but
she laughed it off, saying I must have been dreaming. Shortly afterwards
my father died.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Twenty-six years later, I visited an aunt in New England.
This was the first time I had left the UK. One day during my visit, out
came the family photo album and my aunt showed me a photo of my grandmother.
Id never seen a photo of her before; she had died before I was born. I
looked at the photo and straight away recognised the face, it was the old
lady who I had seen all those years before. Yes it was my grandmother.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Black Shuck</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: the_real_chris_flood@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Thank you for giving me a chance to contribute</b>
<br><b>to The Shadowlands. I really find that regular things are too boring.
I</b>
<br><b>lovethe unusual. As it was said, "There are stranger things in heaven
and earth</b>
<br><b>than we can think of." Well, here it goes.</b><b></b>
<p><b>There has always been something other than family inhabiting my house.
I</b>
<br><b>did</b>
<br><b>not know this until a few months ago. My mother told me that there
is a</b>
<br><b>shadow that passes through our hallway from time to time. She had
been</b>
<br><b>seeing it for about 20 years. One night I decided to stay in the
hall and</b>
<br><b>watch out for it. It did not take very long for me to find out that
my</b>
<br><b>mother was telling the truth. I saw what seemed to be a light shadow
that</b>
<br><b>raced across the hall. There was a dress that my mom left hanging
in the</b>
<br><b>hall, and when the shadow raced across the hall, the dress looked
as if it</b>
<br><b>was moved by the wind. There was no noise, and it happened very
fast.</b>
<br><b>There have also been strange things that happened in my aunt's house.
My</b>
<br><b>cousins were sleeping there, and during the night, one of them woke
up and</b>
<br><b>saw a white shadow floating across the wall. The one who saw this
began to</b>
<br><b>panic. Everyone woke up and went to see what was wrong. They all
saw the</b>
<br><b>same thing. Then, one night they saw something even worse. They
saw a large</b>
<br><b>black shadow floating along the wall. They had their house exorcised,
and</b>
<br><b>they never saw these things again. Later, they found out what these
shadows</b>
<br><b>meant; white shadows symbolize the death of an unborn child, and
black</b>
<br><b>shadows symbolize evil spirits. In that house, there were three
white</b>
<br><b>shadows, and one black shadow.</b>
<br><b>Through the years, there have been numerous tales of a large black
dog with</b>
<br><b>blazing red eyes, shaggy fur, and an evil agenda. Black Shuck seems
very</b>
<br><b>real to many people in the Britain and other places in the world
today,</b>
<br><b>especially the people that this creature has affected. There have
been an</b>
<br><b>incredible number of sightings that have been documented. Seeing
this</b>
<br><b>creature usually foreshadows death or misfortune. A man was working
on a</b>
<br><b>tower, and he saw a large black dog on the beach below. He said
that it</b>
<br><b>looked as though it was looking for something aggressively. All
of a</b>
<br><b>sudden,</b>
<br><b>it vanished. He told his father of this the next day, and soon after
that,</b>
<br><b>his father was struck dead by lightening. There is a belief that
if you see</b>
<br><b>Black Shuck, you cannot tell anyone about him within a year and
a day, or</b>
<br><b>something bad will happen. In another case, a woman awoke to a noise
in the</b>
<br><b>middle of the night. There was a dog trying to climb through her
kitchen</b>
<br><b>window. She thought that it was just a regular (large) dog that
was trying</b>
<br><b>to get in, until she saw his eyes. They were blood red. It soon
left her</b>
<br><b>house without causing trouble. However, in the 1500's, there was
a dog of</b>
<br><b>this nature that entered a church and killed two people. The clawmarks
are</b>
<br><b>still visible on the doors of the church. Sometimes, people only
hear these</b>
<br><b>creatures. They are said to drag chains and walk right behind people.
This</b>
<br><b>happened to a man on his way home from work. He did not turn around
to see</b>
<br><b>what the creature looked like. He just hurried home. He claimed
that he</b>
<br><b>could feel the creature's breath on his back and hear the chains
dragging</b>
<br><b>on the ground. Some believe that one should try to ignore this beast
if it is</b>
<br><b>following you and speak not a word of it when you make it to safety.
There</b>
<br><b>have even been professional ghost hunters that have said that they
would</b>
<br><b>never want to encounter Black Shuck. Is he real? You decide.</b>

<p><b>When I was a girl I was invited to stay the night with a friend.
I really</b>

evening</b>
<br><b>was uneventful just the girly stuff you did at that age but when
we went to</b>
<br><b>bed things were a lot different! We were on a mattress in her room
with hard</b>

when the</b>
<br><b>bedroom door opened and I heard footsteps walk across the floor.
I sat up to</b>
<br><b>see who it was but there was NOBODY there! Next thing I know the

<p><b>The RedWood Valley In Hawaii</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>There were military housing and this address used to be mine..when
I was 8 my</b>
<br><b>father was in the Navy and he was stationed in Pearl Harbor for
3 years. We</b>
<br><b>stayed in the Navy Baracks until we were able to move into this
apartment on</b>
<br><b>Macadamia Place. The excuse given to my mother was that it still
was not</b>
<br><b>ready and had to be cleaned up. At the time my family and I did
not</b>
<br><b>understand why it was still not ready.&nbsp; But my mother did not
care too much</b>
<br><b>as long as we were able to move in soon. Well not long after we
had settled</b>
<br><b>in our new place on Macadamia Pl strange things started to happen..Things
on</b>
<br><b>the wall would fall off and my sisters and I would have to go to
the location</b>
<br><b>and put what it was back on the wall whether it were a painting
or a candle</b>
<br><b>holder. Sometimes we would hear the candle holders fall off of the
wall and</b>
<br><b>it would not be there hours later it would be there where we heard
it fall</b>
<br><b>hours before and not hearing a sound later. One time I stayed up
late and was</b>
<br><b>in my s!</b>
<br><b>ister's room. I was reading a comic on the floor by the door of
my sister's</b>
<br><b>room called Casper the friendly ghost..what a coincidence huh? At
the same</b>
<br><b>time I had my dog with me she was just a puppy then well all of
a sudden I</b>
<br><b>started to feel a strong draft become windy that it was very slightly
shaking</b>
<br><b>the door.My puppy started shaking then I began to hear footsteps
coming up</b>
<br><b>the stairs I looked underneath the door I could see the hallway
and the</b>
<br><b>beginning of the stairs..the foot steps got louder and then I really
started</b>
<br><b>to get nervous because my father was not at all a friendly man when
it came</b>
<br><b>to us being up late at night so I woke up my sister and asked her
if my dad</b>
<br><b>was home she got upset and started hollering and then kicked me
out of her</b>
<br><b>room I begged and pleaded with her not to let me out because there
was</b>
<br><b>someone out in the hall walking back and forth and I could not see
him but</b>
<br><b>she kicked me out anyway I closed my eyes and ran down the hall
to my room</b>
<br><b>and ran past th!</b>
<br><b>e thing I did not want to see and ran into the room where I shared
with</b>
<br><b>another sister and jumped into the bed with her I could not sleep
but did not</b>
<br><b>want to open my eyes because the foot step had followed me all the
way back</b>
<br><b>to my room why I was afraid I thought only because I was afraid
of the dark I</b>
<br><b>did not understand but I wanted also to believe it was more than
just my fear</b>
<br><b>of the dark. My mother would keep me up at night with her until
she was ready</b>
<br><b>to go to sleep.&nbsp; I use to wake up in the middle of the night
to a voice that</b>
<br><b>sounded like my mother...the sleep walking became constant that
my mother</b>
<br><b>bought a fence that attached from the wall to the stairwell banister
to keep</b>
<br><b>me from falling downstairs..my sister being only 4 years old at
the time had</b>
<br><b>a twin and she would see a man sitting on her bed and his head was
bleeding</b>
<br><b>on the side...we all thought she was just seeing things. When were
children</b>
<br><b>we all thought our house was haunted just as a joke but not seriously
beca!</b>
<br><b>use we did not actually understand haunted houses were real,when
unusual</b>
<br><b>things happened like my dog chasing something to a corner and barking</b>
<br><b>frantically we all thought it was just a crazy dog. We did not believe
in</b>
<br><b>ghosts until we had moved out. Another time I was in the kitchen
bymyself in</b>
<br><b>the middle of the night to get my dog a pepto bismol because I heard
my</b>
<br><b>mother say one time that our dog had diarrhea, me being just 8 yrs
old wanted</b>
<br><b>my dog to get better and I knew that pepto always did the job when
I suddenly</b>
<br><b>heard the voice of a man at the same time my dog hearing the voice
too she</b>
<br><b>turned quickly to where it was standing and she started shaking
in my arms</b>
<br><b>because it was standing right next to me saying,"Pssst ey" in a
loud</b>
<br><b>whisper.This happened around 12:00 a.m. I became so scared but not
scared</b>
<br><b>enough to spill everything because my dad was even more frightenig
so I put</b>
<br><b>back everything neatly into the refridgerator and walked slowly
back into the</b>
<br><b>living room and shut a!</b>
<br><b>ll the lights and then slowly towards the staircase and then ran
to the top</b>
<br><b>and into my room and jumped my sisters bed. My bedroom would be
freezing cold</b>
<br><b>even though it was around the hottest days in the summer without
the air</b>
<br><b>conditioning being on and the window open... It would be so cold
that if you</b>
<br><b>blew out air from your mouth there would be smoke...when my father
was home</b>
<br><b>on leave he would see a woman in a ligerie going up the stairs at
night.</b>
<br><b>Well when it came time for us to move we were told from the military
after</b>
<br><b>informing them of the incidences that occured at the house and on
our block</b>
<br><b>with the other military families ,because our homes where like townhouses</b>
<br><b>they were all connected..one child in each family around the same
time all</b>
<br><b>had broken either a leg or an arm and had to wear a cast..The military</b>
<br><b>finally told us that before we were allowed to move in, a man and
a woman,the</b>
<br><b>man was in the Navy and his wife was asian, used to live in that
house.&nbsp; When</b>
<br><b>coming hom!</b>
<br><b>e on leave, the Navy man found out that his wife had an affair while
he was</b>
<br><b>on duty and became outraged..He came home beat up his wife then
shot her and</b>
<br><b>placed her body in the closet under the trap door that lead to the
outer part</b>
<br><b>of the house but underneath. And then shot himself in the head.
Well, when</b>
<br><b>the person that was reponsible for looking for men that have gone
a wall</b>
<br><b>found that the Navy man had shot himself in the head in one of the
rooms, the</b>
<br><b>military was soon informed and clean out the house as soon as possible
but</b>
<br><b>was unable to locate the wife. A young couple was moved into the
house before</b>
<br><b>we were. But not too long after they moved in they quickly moved
out</b>
<br><b>complaining of strange disturbances and a strong stench. The military
then</b>
<br><b>went back to the house and located the place where the stench was
coming from</b>
<br><b>and found the wife. They cleaned up the house some more and we were
moved in</b>
<br><b>confused as to why the other couple had wanted to leave so quickly
having</b>
<br><b>lived th!</b>
<br><b>ere we discovered why.&nbsp; As for an update on the location site--being
that I</b>
<br><b>work on the base and am informed by other military soldiers and
reenlisted</b>
<br><b>men and women-- I have been told that the whole housing on the street
of</b>
<br><b>Macadamia Pl had been torn down and a museum had been built on top
of what</b>
<br><b>used to be our home whether or not strange occurrances still occur
is</b>
<br><b>unknown. I am now 28 years old and I still have memories of my experiences
in</b>
<br><b>that house experiences that are unforgettable and lingering. A list

<br><b>Pony Express House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; false_profir_76@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>The house used to be a Pony Express</b>
<br><b>station back when it was first built. My family bought it when I
was 14. When</b>
<br><b>we first moved in, I thought that it was just a creaky old house.
Before</b>
<br><b>long, variuos members of my family started noticing strange goings-on
within</b>
<br><b>and even outside of the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I didn't think anything of it at</b>
<br><b>the time, but the day that we moved in, I was sitting at a picnic
table on</b>
<br><b>the back porch when my mother came up on the porch and went inside.
I was</b>
<br><b>busy admiring the vast expanse of the back yard with all of its
trees and</b>
<br><b>shrubs when someone, who I assumed to be my mother, sat down on
the bench</b>
<br><b>next to me. I turned to say something to her, but no one was there!
It</b>
<br><b>startled me at first, because I could have sworn there was someone
there, but</b>
<br><b>then I figured that I must have been mistaken. Still, I got up immediately</b>
<br><b>and went inside to find my mother, dismissing the porch all together.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later on, l!</b>
<br><b>ittle things would come up missing all around the house. Once it
was a ring</b>
<br><b>that had been passed down from generation to generation in the family
that</b>
<br><b>belonged to my aunt(stolen maybe?),my drivers license,homework(that
happened</b>
<br><b>more than once to each of us kids) some blueprints to the house
and some</b>
<br><b>misc. paperwork(thought misplaced), my little sisters favorite pair
of</b>
<br><b>shoes(we assumed she hid them), the fireplace poker, various knicknacks,
and</b>
<br><b>some of my grandfathers artifacts. Then one day I was dusting the
furniture</b>
<br><b>in the dining room, and for some reason, pulled up a chair to the
china</b>
<br><b>cabinet to dust the top of it, and there were all of the missing
items! Every</b>
<br><b>last one of them! The cabinet itself was a good 8 feet tall, with
a recess in</b>
<br><b>the top, so that explained why no one had ever noticed any of the
things up</b>
<br><b>there. After that, anytime anything came up missing, it could be
found atop</b>
<br><b>the china cabinet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>windows in the !</b>
<br><b>house are 10 feet tall with lead inlay and very heavy. They have
latches that</b>
<br><b>you must turn clockwise in order to open the window. Then the windows
open</b>
<br><b>inward much like french doors. Often we would hear the familliar
creak of the</b>
<br><b>window latch, only to look over and see the latch turning on its
own, and</b>
<br><b>then the window (or windows )would open. Numerous people have witnessed
the</b>
<br><b>windows and doors in the house. The doors are all heavy oak, and
with the way</b>
<br><b>that the house has settled over the years, you have to lift the
door up</b>
<br><b>before opening or closing otherwise they will drag across the wood
floors.</b>
<br><b>Then you must tug it in whichever direction you want it to go because
they</b>
<br><b>are so heavy. Many times we would witness the doors swinging silently
and</b>
<br><b>gracefully open or shut. It really gave me the creeps at&nbsp; first.</b>

There are two sets of stairs that you can</b>
<br><b>hear someone walking up and down at various times. I would usually
use the</b>
<br><b>back s!</b>
<br><b>ervants stairs because they came up right next to my bedroom. The
stairway is</b>
<br><b>maybe 4 feet wide, very steep,and the stairs are only about 6 inches</b>
<br><b>wide.There is a large window at the bottom. I have often passed
and even</b>
<br><b>walked right into 'someone' on those stairs. Once, I lost my footing,
missed</b>
<br><b>grabbing for the rail, and something pushed me back against the
stairs. I hit</b>
<br><b>the stairs pretty hard, but if whoever hadn't pushed me back, I
wouldv'e gone</b>
<br><b>through that window. I stopped using those stairs for a while, it
scared me</b>
<br><b>so badly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I never saw anyone, but I always knew</b>
<br><b>when they were around. The room would get a little cooler,my dog
would freak</b>
<br><b>out and run to me whining,sometimes you could hear a child laughing
but it</b>
<br><b>sounded like it was in annother part of the house, sometimes I would
catch</b>
<br><b>movement out of the corner of my eye,or maybe catch a muffled wisper.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A few times when I was sleeping, I</b>
<br><b>wo!</b>
<br><b>uld wake to find my blanket gone. One time it was folded neatly
on the</b>
<br><b>radiator in my room, once it was draped over the bannister on the
front</b>
<br><b>staircase, and one other time, it was downstairs with my cowering
dog</b>
<br><b>underneath it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The favored room of the house seemed</b>
<br><b>to be a porch off of the dining room that had been enclosed with
windows. My</b>
<br><b>mother used it as a greenhouse for all of her many plants. Water
would come</b>
<br><b>from the ceilng like there was a faucet on up there or something.
It wasn't</b>
<br><b>raining, and there were no water pipes above that room. When we
would get a</b>
<br><b>chair and climb up to touch the ceiling, the water would stop and
the ceiling</b>
<br><b>would be bone dry. There would be water puddles all over the floor,
and</b>
<br><b>certain plants would always have a droplet of water on the very
tip of each</b>
<br><b>leaf. Oftentimes the plants would be rearranged. Some more in the
sun, some</b>
<br><b>more in the shade. As long as they were left there, they wouldn't
be messed</b>
<br><b>with again until !</b>
<br><b>one of us moved them. If we moved them, 'he' would always put them
back where</b>
<br><b>he liked them. Always in the same spot. I speculate that he must
know</b>
<br><b>something about horticulture, because the plants always thrived.
When my dog</b>
<br><b>was outside, he would go over to that side of the house and bark
at the room</b>
<br><b>until you made him come inside. He would never ever go anywhere
near that</b>
<br><b>room inside or outside of the house, but he usually only barked
at it when he</b>
<br><b>was outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of my sisters, there were three under the age</b>
<br><b>of six, who each had an invisible friend that they called Mr. Nobody.
When</b>
<br><b>they were outside you could hear them playing and arguing with him.
When</b>
<br><b>something came up missing or broken, they always blamed it on him
usually the</b>
<br><b>missing item could be found atop the china cabinet of course, but
there was</b>
<br><b>no way that any of them could have gotten up there. They were simply
too</b>
<br><b>little. None of them remember having an invisible friend when they
were</b>
<br><b>small, so it!</b>
<br><b>'s hard to say whether they made it up, or&nbsp; whether they could
actually see</b>
<br><b>our ghost.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The basement</b>
<br><b>downright terrified me. It had been separated into two halves, and
the walls</b>
<br><b>are raw stone. At one time there had been mortar, but most of it
has fallen</b>
<br><b>away, and there is almost always water trickling down the walls
from between</b>
<br><b>the stones. The front half of the basement isn't so bad. It just
resembles a</b>
<br><b>dungeon. Every time I'd go down there, I would get fierce chills,
and every</b>
<br><b>hair in my body would stand on end. I hardly ever went down there
by myself.</b>
<br><b>Someone had built a brick wall in the center and made it into two
rooms. The</b>
<br><b>back area had no lights and no windows. There was only a coal shute
on the</b>
<br><b>far left wall, so it was always pitch black. Any time you went in
there with</b>
<br><b>a flashlight, candle, lantern, or whatever it would go out. Eventually
there</b>
<br><b>was a small room discovered tucked around the corner of the wall
on the rig!</b>
<br><b>ht side of the room. (This room is not in the blueprints of the
house. There</b>
<br><b>are also several crawlspaces and a passageway from a side parlor
to the</b>
<br><b>livingroom that aren't in the blueprints either.)&nbsp; There is
all sorts of</b>
<br><b>stuff in the room, but we've never gotten any light to stay on long
enough to</b>
<br><b>tell what any of it is. That part of the basement is obviously off
limits.</b>
<br><b>It's really cold, even in the summer, and against the wall there
is a bricked</b>
<br><b>up enclosure that looks like something out of Edgar Allen Poes The
Cask Of</b>
<br><b>Amontillado. No one has any idea of what that could be, or why it
is even</b>
<br><b>there. But, there is just somrthing there that says "GO AWAY!" It
has a very</b>
<br><b>foreboding presence. So, that part of the basement is left alone.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The lights, t.v., and sterio would come</b>
<br><b>on and off by themselves, the t.v. and sterio would change channels
and</b>
<br><b>stations, sometimes stopping on something specific like classical
or country</b>
<br><b>music, !</b>
<br><b>and sometimes just rolling up and down the spectrum until either
he (I always</b>
<br><b>for some reason thought that our mischievious friend was a little
old man but</b>
<br><b>I don't know why. Sometimes, but not very often, there also seemed
to be a</b>
<br><b>little girl there too.) got bore</b>
<br><b>d with it. Eventually, I got brave enough to tell him to knock it
off, and it</b>
<br><b>worked! He'd stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the winter my parents had the worst time</b>
<br><b>getting fires started in the fireplace. The flue would somehow always
manage</b>
<br><b>to be closed, the house would fill up with smoke, and they would
argue about</b>
<br><b>the fact that whoever had been attempting to start the fire had
indeed made</b>
<br><b>absolutely positve that the flue had been open before they had attempted
to</b>
<br><b>start a fire. Then it would start all over again. The flue would
always</b>
<br><b>mysteriously close itself. They had it checked out, there was nothing
wrong</b>
<br><b>with it. Eventually they gave up on the fireplace, and just used
the radiator</b>
<br><b>system that the house has.Two years ago, they had a man come and
clean the</b>
<br><b>fireplace and chimney out, and he found a massive crack in the back
of the</b>
<br><b>fireplace that would have resulted in the house catching on fire
had the</b>
<br><b>fireplace been used. The crack was repaired, the flue was left alone,
and</b>
<br><b>there has !</b>
<br><b>never been a problem with it closing since.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Once, there were several of us kids in my bedroom,(which
I shared with my</b>
<br><b>cousin)and my cousin and one of my friends were carrying on about
not</b>
<br><b>beleiving in ghosts, (which truthfully, neither did I until I moved
into that</b>
<br><b>house) and he should do something to prove his existance. Each of
us had our</b>
<br><b>own experiences in that house, and we all knew good and well that
there was a</b>
<br><b>ghost there. They were just goofing off and didn't think anything
would come</b>
<br><b>from it, when suddenly the papers that were on the desk just swished
upward</b>
<br><b>and then scattered all about the room. We all bolted out of the
house, and</b>
<br><b>after that, I slept downstairs on the couch for a couple of nights.
My cousin</b>
<br><b>slept on the other couch for a good month.</b>
<br><b>Once, one of my friends was in the bathroom, and he screamed. We
all went</b>
<br><b>running to see what was wrong, and he, pale and sweaty, was frantically
insis!</b>
<br><b>ting that there was something in the bathroom mirror as he was on
his way out</b>
<br><b>the door. Later on he explained that when he had looked into the
mirror,</b>
<br><b>there was someone standing behind him, but when he turned around,
there</b>
<br><b>wasn't anyone there. It scared him so badly that he would never
come inside</b>
<br><b>my house again. None of us that lived there ever saw anything like
that.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We never really had any</b>
<br><b>problems with our ghost,(other than my scared friend and the presence
in the</b>
<br><b>basement, but I don't believe that the one in the basement and the
one(s) who</b>
<br><b>claims the rest of the house are the same entity) so we never really
felt</b>
<br><b>that we needed to make him leave. The most of our problems with
him were the</b>
<br><b>pranks that he loved to pull on everyone else, even the poor dog!
And after</b>
<br><b>all, we figured that it was probably more his house than it was
ours, and he</b>
<br><b>is rather protective of both the house and its inhabitants.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We thought that perhaps the activity might stop once myself</b>
<br><b>or the rest of us kids grew up and moved out, but it didn't. The
place is</b>
<br><b>still just as haunted as ever.</b>

<p><b>The entire campus is haunted by various spirits, ulman hall does
have an angry spirit living on its third floor. it is said that he was
a student that hung himself there. there is a spirit haunt an adminishtration
building that used to be a dorm. staff members have stated that they have
heard running on the third floor but when someone has gont to investigate
there is nothing there. in the same building foot steps have been heard
on the steps that are not carpeted. there is something down by the pond
that is an extreamly negative force. i do not know who and or what it is.
i say this for the pure fact that this thing, for a lack of a better term,
is violent. knocking people down, growling and leaving bruses on its victems.
also this same thing has also been able to have cause the smell of amonia

the library. his remains are kept there and he seems to b!</b>
<br><b>!</b>
<br><b>e conected to the library most of the time but he has been known
to travel around campus. there is also something else near the rail road
tracks. i have a feeling it is male but again it is a negative force. as
far as i know this spirit has not harmed anyone but it sure does like to
cause very uneasy feelings. the ulman ghost, recently i have been told,
that he one ngiht decided to open and close a girls closet violantly then
her draws on her desk then the desk dwraws stayed open and the things inside
proceded to be thrown out of the draws. i have gotten the feeling that
there are 15 spirrits on campus. some i can not figure out totaly. if i
had stronger decifering powers i could elaborate more. if i had the time
to spend on searching the campus over i would devote my time to figuring
out who these people were or what negative force desires to stay on campus.

<br><b>For Sale Again</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: chathamcashier@on.aibn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had experiences with ghosts from a very young age.&nbsp; It
would take forever to recall every one so I will write just the ones that
I find to be the most interesting.</b>
<br><b>When I was 8 years old my family and I moved to Scotland.&nbsp;
At first we stayed with my dad's uncle but eventually moved into our own
flat.&nbsp; One night I was sleeping on the couch in our living room.&nbsp;
This was not an unusual occurence as the house was heated by a fireplace
which was located in this room, and my room was located down a long corridor
and was never properly heated.</b>
<br><b>I woke up in the middle of the night.&nbsp; The exact time I am
unsure of , to find a young boy and a black dog floating in the air right
beside the sofa I was sleeping on.&nbsp; They were semi transparent and
had just sockets where their eyes should have been.&nbsp; For some reason
though I was not in the least intimidated by my sighting.&nbsp; I just
rolled over and went back to sleep.</b>
<br><b>The next morning I woke up and could ragged breathing coming from
somewhere in the room.&nbsp; I could not distinguish where this breathing
was coming from but fled the room and went and woke my parents.&nbsp; They
gave me some impossible explanation for it and that was the end of it.</b>
<br><b>Years later after we had moved back to Canada I was discussing this
with my mother.&nbsp; She said that she had also witnessed just the dog
standing at the end of our long corridor seemingly grinning at her.&nbsp;
Unlike myself she was very intimidated by the sighting and felt that this
dog was in some way detrimental toher and our safety.&nbsp; She was not
surprised to here me tell what I had seen years ago but had decided not
to devulge her information to save me from more fear.</b>
<br><b>When we moved back to Canada we moved to a nice house in a nicer
neighbourhood.&nbsp; For the first few months everything was fine.&nbsp;
After we were situated in our new home strange things began to happen.</b>
<br><b>At first it started with the TV turning on full blast in the middle
of the night.&nbsp; One of us would have to get up and turn it off. My
dad attributed it to a neighbour being on the same cable box.&nbsp; He
was always the sceptic.&nbsp; One night this changed.</b>
<br><b>He had been woke up by the TV going on full blast.&nbsp; He started
to go down the stairs and as soon as his foot hit the bottom step the TV
turned off.&nbsp; On his way up the stairs the TV turned on again.&nbsp;
This occurence made him into a believer.</b>
<br><b>Dishes would smash by themselves in the kitchen. We had two budgies
that died the same night and were found at the bottom of the cage in the
morning.</b>
<br><b>Another strange thing happened when my best friend at the time,
came over on a weekend to visit us .&nbsp; This wasn't surprising because
she was always either at my house or me at hers.&nbsp; We were gone at
the time and when we returned I received a call from Lori.She told me that
she had came over to my house and had entered by the side door.&nbsp; She
climbed up the five or six stairs that brought her to another door.&nbsp;
This door led to the dining room and was just a hollow door.&nbsp; Lori
then asked me if we put a lock on that door because she hadn't been able
to enter.&nbsp; She said that she had knocked and pushed on the door figuring
that myself or one of my family members was playing a joke and her and
was holding the door closed from inside.&nbsp; We had not installed alock
on this door and no one had been home to keep her from entering the house.&nbsp;
Whoever or whatever was in the house just did not want her in.</b>
<br><b>I honestly believe that whatever was in that house was malvolent
and was glad when we moved out shortly after moving in.&nbsp; I later on
met someone else who had resided there and they said that the house was
strange.&nbsp; Even today when I go by the house there is always a for
sale sign on the front yard.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Aunt Theresa</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sandwitch_1999@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have been reading the stories on this site for more</b>
<br><b>than 3 years now, and it never gets old! I even have a</b>
<br><b>couple of my own stories posted.&nbsp; Now, I have a new</b>
<br><b>one... When I was born in 1974, my Aunt Theresa was</b>
<br><b>only 14.&nbsp; While in high school, she and her friends</b>
<br><b>would take me cruising with them and let me hang out.</b>
<br><b>We were always very close, and my two younger sisters</b>
<br><b>also were close wih her.&nbsp; She was more like a sister</b>
<br><b>to us than an aunt. When I was 15 we were all sitting</b>
<br><b>around talking about ghosts and stuff and we all made</b>
<br><b>a promise that whoever died first would come back to</b>
<br><b>the others, if they could, and prove that ghosts</b>
<br><b>really exist.&nbsp; Weird, I know... My aunt and I</b>
<br><b>eventually grew apart somewhat, but still spoke</b>
<br><b>occasionally.&nbsp; On March 3, 1999, I was on the</b>
<br><b>computer, on this very site, reading ghost stories</b>
<br><b>(one of my favorite pasttimes!)when the phone rang.</b>
<br><b>My Aunt Mary was calling to tell me that something had</b>
<br><b>happened to Theresa and that she was being taken to a</b>
<br><b>hospital in Lubbock, Texas, and they weren't sure if</b>
<br><b>she was going to make it or not.&nbsp; I was in shock, of</b>
<br><b>course.&nbsp; My sister Jenny and I rode to Lubbock</b>
<br><b>together and on the two hour trip there, she said "Do</b>
<br><b>you remember a long time ago when Theresa promised</b>
<br><b>that if she dies before us, she will come back?"&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>did, but I tried not to think about it because I</b>
<br><b>really didn't want to assume that she was going to</b>
<br><b>die.&nbsp; Anyway, we were at the hospital for hours while</b>
<br><b>they operated to find out what was wrong.&nbsp; Appearantly</b>
<br><b>the lining of her intestine had been perforated and</b>
<br><b>peritonitis had set in.&nbsp; She didn't make it.&nbsp; She was</b>
<br><b>only 39 and had a ten year old son, so it was a real</b>
<br><b>tragedy.&nbsp; And to make it worse, I was feeling guilty</b>
<br><b>about our having grown apart, and was wishing I had</b>
<br><b>seen more of her in the last several years.</b>
<br><b>By August of 1999, I had been married for two months,</b>
<br><b>and my husband and I were in the process of looking</b>
<br><b>for a house in his hometown so that we could move</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; While we were there&nbsp; I had a VERY vivid and</b>
<br><b>intense dream.&nbsp; I was at a bar hanging out with some</b>
<br><b>people that were playing pool and my aunt walked up to</b>
<br><b>us.&nbsp; I was feeling weird because, of course, she's</b>
<br><b>dead, but nevertheless I was very happy to see her.</b>
<br><b>She looked really good, like when she was younger and</b>
<br><b>in better health.&nbsp; One of the people I was with went</b>
<br><b>over to hug her and her arms went right through</b>
<br><b>Theresa, like she was just an apparition.&nbsp; I ran over</b>
<br><b>and hugged her, and when I did, she was solid, like a</b>
<br><b>pesron normally is!&nbsp; I told her I missed her and that</b>
<br><b>I was so sorry that we hadn't seen much of each other</b>
<br><b>before she died.&nbsp; She said something like, "I'm sorry</b>
<br><b>I had to leave like that, but you know how it is."&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>know this was a dream, but I SWEAR it was actually</b>
<br><b>happening on a subconscious level.&nbsp; The entire time</b>
<br><b>that these events were taking place I kept saying to</b>
<br><b>myself, "This is not a dream!&nbsp; This is really</b>
<br><b>happening!" and I was crying when I woke up.&nbsp; I have</b>
<br><b>had many dreams like this where I swear I talked with</b>
<br><b>a dead friend or family member.&nbsp; Sometimes, when I</b>
<br><b>wake up, I find out that the person I dreamed of</b>
<br><b>passed on about the time that the dream was taking</b>
<br><b>place.&nbsp; I'm sure there are others out there that know</b>
<br><b>what I'm talking about; when you KNOW that you really</b>
<br><b>did communicate with the deceased.&nbsp; It is unlike any</b>
<br><b>other dream, and this one about my Aunt Theresa was</b>
<br><b>the most intense and probably the most meaningful,</b>
<br><b>considering the promise that we made each other.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>mom and my little sister believe that was her way of</b>
<br><b>"coming back".</b>
<br><b>Another interesting twist to the story involves my</b>
<br><b>little sister (Jenny).&nbsp; She was about 6 or 7 months</b>
<br><b>pregnant when Theresa died.&nbsp; Theresa couldn't wait for</b>
<br><b>the baby to be born, as it was going to be the first</b>
<br><b>baby from our generation.&nbsp; After Theresa died, Jenny</b>
<br><b>decided to name her daughter Kenzie McKay, the 'McKay'</b>
<br><b>being a variation of my aunt's middle name.&nbsp; Kenzie</b>
<br><b>was born that June and when she was about a month old</b>
<br><b>or so, strange things started happening.&nbsp; Kenzie would</b>
<br><b>be lying down, just hanging out, and all of a sudden,</b>
<br><b>she would look at a spot on the ceiling and start</b>
<br><b>smiling and laughing and kind of talking.&nbsp; She didn't</b>
<br><b>do this often, but she would be transfixed on one spot</b>
<br><b>and of course, there was never anything there.&nbsp; At</b>
<br><b>first it freaked Jenny and my mom out a little, but</b>
<br><b>then they decided that she must be talking to her</b>
<br><b>Great-Aunt Theresa.&nbsp; Also, she had a toy that was a</b>
<br><b>plastic green caterpillar that would light up and play</b>
<br><b>music when you touched it.&nbsp; Thing is, it got to where</b>
<br><b>it would light up and play music when nobody was NEAR</b>
<br><b>it!&nbsp; That really freaked everyone out, and sometimes</b>
<br><b>my mom would stick it in the closet when it would do</b>
<br><b>that.&nbsp; Maybe it is all coincidence; who knows???&nbsp; But</b>
<br><b>I did notice tonight, as I was reading some of the</b>
<br><b>newer stories, that there were a couple of incidences</b>
<br><b>where people talked about their babies smiling and</b>
<br><b>laughing at what appeared to be nothing!</b><b></b>

<br><b>First Experience</b><b></b>

<p><b>I'm not sure what to write.&nbsp; I just had my first experience
with seeing a</b>
<br><b>ghost last weekend. I was visiting my sister and her husband for
the weekend</b>
<br><b>and they let me stay on there hide-a-bed.&nbsp; At about 1:30 in
the morning I</b>
<br><b>was awakened, I'm not sure how, I just woke up.&nbsp; I look into
the kitchen and</b>
<br><b>their was a man standing in the door way.&nbsp; I didn't think anything
of it</b>
<br><b>because I thought it was my sister's husband.&nbsp; Well I kept
watching him and</b>
<br><b>I saw him walking around my bed and standing next to the fish tank.
I never</b>
<br><b>got a really good look at his face, I wasn't sure who or what is
was.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>must have fallen back to sleep because I remember waking up and
it was</b>
<br><b>talking to me.&nbsp; I remember it saying my sister's name and then
I must have</b>
<br><b>went back to sleep. In my sister's house you can't take a step without</b>
<br><b>making the boards creek. I remember thinking that their was no noise
at all.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Well at 3:00 in the morning my sister's husband woke up to

at all</b>

stay, so i</b>
<br><b>moved in. soon after i moved in, i noticed something strange. sometimes
my</b>
<br><b>cat would paw the air or chase something on the floor, just as if&nbsp;
i were</b>
<br><b>dangling a toy on a string for him. i watched him for weeks, trying
to see if</b>
<br><b>he was chasing a bug or something, but there was never anything
there. the</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years I have been watching the seasonal
specials which broadcast this time of year. I truly enjoy a good ghost
story. This year the family channel aired a 5 day series in which a family
spent the night in Chillingham Castle. It was quite interesting. However,
I know of a residence here in the states that is not far behind in its
activity. This is a residence that I had spent alot of time as will be
explained later. First, let me qualify myself. I am a police officer and
am a few hours short of my BS Degree in psychology (I need to complete
my langauges). I am a family man and consider my-self a stable and competant
person.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will try to make a long story relatively short
as to not take up to much of your time.</b>
<br><b>History:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 9 years ago I was playing in a
classic rock band with some friends. We needed a place to practice and
ran into some good fortune when a friend of mine decided to relocate out
of state due to a career move. This friend offered the band to use his
home (until such a time that it could be sold) in exchange for watching
over the place and upkeep. This was an old farmhouse located on about 25
acres in&nbsp; Southern Indiana.&nbsp; Of course we jumped at the opportunity
to have such an out of the way place to practice. The events bagan on the
day my wife and I, along with our youngest daughter (I think she was 4
at the time), decided to go to the house and clean up a bit prior to the
band arriving with the equiptment. I will not bother with expressing mine
or any others feelings about the place since as far as I know there was
no one among us with any psychic abilities. Instead, I will list the events
in a chronological sequence. This sequence took place over a period of
3 or 4 months.</b>
<br><b>Incident #1- While cleaning in the kitchen (this was our first day
there) my wife told me that a telephone receiver "jumped" off of the wall,
extended to the full lenght of its cord, than sprang against the wall where
it came to rest on the floor.</b>
<br><b>Incident#2- While playing music a loud banging sound comes from
the second floor just above the living room where the band was playing.
Though we were playing very loudly all members stopped after hearing this
sound. Over the next couple of weeks this exact banging sound emitted from
the second floor 4 or 5 more times. Each time the bang was loud enough
to be heard over the music. It (the bang) could be described as if someone
heavy was jumping onto the floor from a reasonable height.Group investigation
(no one wanted to go upstairs alone) revealed nothing but the few items
of furniture left behind by the former residents.</b>
<br><b>Incident#3- A cat which we had been caring for sits at the bottom
of the steps leading up to the second floor and maintains a dead stare
for at least a solid minute (it might have been more). Looking up the stairs
the rest of us see nothing. Without warning the cat bolts from the area
and out a window we had left open for circulation. The door at the top
of the steps was open though none of us remembered leaving it that way.</b>
<br><b>Incident#4- While walking my wife and a friend outside I hear a
voice distinctly yuell "hey" at me. I turn toward the voice and respond.
My wife, myself and our friend all heard it. A moment after responding
I realize that the voice was comming from an area of brush surrounding
a creek bed. This was late at night and though I didn't go to see, I could
not imagine anyone standing in the creek which was located next to the
home in the middle of the acreage. Despite the fact that I yelled a couple
of times the voice never responded.</b>
<br><b>Incident#5- My wife refuses to return to the home after having what
she described as the "most vivid dreams" of her life. In the dreams 2 women
were standing in the doorway at the top of the stairs.She told me that
both women were dressed in "old time" clothing. In the dream one of the
women was holding a noose from which my youngest daughter was hanging,
she added that they were laughing. From that day my wife never returned
to that house and the dreams ceased.</b>
<br><b>Incident#6- While standing in the circular driveway facing the house
myself and two others get the "feeling" that someone is watching. The feeling
is strong enough that we all more or less stop at the door of our vehicles.
We were all facing the house. When one of us ask if the others felt it
we all responded "yes". What happened next is what made this so unusual.
One of the others asked where it felt like someone&nbsp; was watching from
and we all simultaneously turned toward the barn, a direction opposite
of which we were facing.</b>
<br><b>Incident#7- When arriving at practice we fing that our music sheets
are strewn about the back of the living room. Keep in ming that the door
was locked at all times we were not there.</b>
<br><b>Incident#8-When leaving after practice, as we shut the door behind
us (it was the type of door that has a wood panel of the bottom and a glass
panel on the top)&nbsp; 3 loud distinctive "bangs" emit from inside the
house. These bangs were loud and violent. To the best we could tell they
came from the first floor. After a while we mustered the courage (yes we
were frightened) to go back inside. Experimentation (the slamming of different
doors and cabinets) revealed that the bangs might have been the result
of heavy cabinet doors located in the bathroom on the first floor.</b>
<br><b>Between the loud bangs from upstairs (they continued on and off
during our duration) and the other events the band decided that we would
meet elsewhere. I should note that when we returned to move our equiptment
we found the cat dead at the bottom of the stairwell. We had always left
food and water for the cat and only a couple of days had passed so we knew
it wasen't a case of dehydration.</b>
<br><b>Incident#9- My wife receives a nasty call from the real-estate agent
handling the home. The agent ask my wife to explain why human defication
was all over the floors of the home. Since other than the agent we had
the only remaining key the agent had called us for an explanation. We could
only tell her that we had locked all doors and windows prior to leaving
for the last time. I am sure that was the case since I double checked my
self.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to state that we were a drug free band
and that outside of a couple of beers here and there no one had consumed
any intoxicationg substance during these events.</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp; Farm house Haunting</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: CAPTINMJM61@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Many years ago, I traveled up north in Michigan with my best friend
to his</b>
<br><b>grandfathers old farmhouse built around 1890's or early1900's. we
were</b>
<br><b>teenagers who went on a trip alone during the summer ( august).
my friend</b>
<br><b>always told of family who saw and heard things in the house growing
up. we</b>
<br><b>were excited because we were alone , no parents or other family
around , our</b>
<br><b>first vacation from work that year. we got there late at night and
settled in</b>
<br><b>for the night in the downstairs bedroom and went to sleep. around
2 or 3 in</b>
<br><b>the morning, I awoke with a funny feeling that someone was in the
room with</b>
<br><b>us . my friend was awake at the same time , we both saw a man with
a cane</b>
<br><b>standing in the doorway , watching us . He had on old time clothes
and we</b>
<br><b>could'nt see his face too clearly but a outline of his body mostly.
we were</b>
<br><b>so scared we went under the covers and could'nt look at him. I could
still</b>
<br><b>feel him in the room and after a long while, we both went to sleep
until the</b>
<br><b>next morning. my friend thinks it was his grandfather checking who
was in his</b>
<br><b>house. he died back in the1930's. we never saw him again but heard
footsteps</b>
<br><b>going up the old wooden staircase at night real slow and a sound
like a</b>
<br><b>walking stick on the steps. I would like to go back now to see if
he's still</b>
<br><b>wallking around the old house at night</b>

<br><b>Follow the Light</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: pm35351@naxvix.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Where to start. I have alot of angels around me . Some call them
sprits, some call them ghosts I call them angels. As far back as I can
remember I have had them around me. I really started seeing them after
my dad killed himself when I was 10. After he died we moved from Minn.
to Neb. \ It took me 2 weeks to even cry.&nbsp; I didn't believe he was
dead. Then one night I couldn't sleep It was late and I opened my eyes
three stood my dad smiling at me. I didn't move nor did I make a sound.
I could hear his voice but his lips didn't move. He told me I would be
ok and I would understand when I got older. Then he told me when I got
married I would have 2 kids a blue eyed girl and a brown eyed boy.( And
that is what I had.) This is not the only time in my life I have seen angels
( ghosts). they walk in my home.&nbsp; It doesn't matter where I move,
with in a few weeks they are there. There has been old men and women ,children
even pets ,you cold see the paw prints in the carpet. This is not a joke
and I am not lying . When they are near, the room turns cold and the hair
on my husbands neck stands up. I went to a palm reader once to see what
she could tell me. She told me I was a medium and they come to me to help
them find there way. I know when there around. Just last sunday, it was
around 5:00am I woke to the crying of a baby and the smell of baby powder
so strong it was burning my nose.Mind you, we live in a one dwelling loft
apt 30 ft high. There are no babies close by. I know this sounds boring
but it would take hrs. to explain all the things that have happened . So
if you are afraid don't be they just need a little help as we all do finding
the way. Light a candle and tell them to follow the light , they will find
there way. God bless</b>

<p><b>Few of My Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Niekos@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am one of those fortunates/unfortunates
(pick one) who often</b>
<br><b>experience these types of things. Here are a few.</b><b></b>
<p><b>...Barracks Locker</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was a Marine sergeantback in the
70's one of my regular duties</b>
<br><b>was barracks security guard ("fire watch").&nbsp; Now, the NCO quarters
was made</b>
<br><b>by our pushing several wall lockers together to form a wall across
the end of</b>
<br><b>the squad-bay (with one missing for a door, of course) with our
racks (bunks)</b>
<br><b>on the other side.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this particular night several of the
NCO's and I were sitting on&nbsp; my</b>
<br><b>rack watching TV.&nbsp; Sgt. Root came in after his night in "the
'ville" ,</b>
<br><b>showered, smoothed the Confederate flag covering his civilian side
of his</b>
<br><b>locker (he was a meticulous man with a place for every thing and
every thing</b>
<br><b>in it's place), then went and laid down on his rack right next to
mine.</b>
<br><b>Shortly I saw, out of the corner of my eye, a man in a white towel
or white</b>
<br><b>boxers (it was out of the CORNER of my eye after all) in front&nbsp;
Root's</b>
<br><b>locker.&nbsp; As I turnto ask&nbsp; what he thought he was doing,&nbsp;
I only got "Hey,</b>
<br><b>what..." out of my mouth, for in the middle of the sentance he turned
right</b>
<br><b>and stepped up and through the open solid metal door!!&nbsp; I remained
staring</b>
<br><b>for what seemed like an eternity trying to decide if I really saw
it, or I</b>
<br><b>needed to be relieved for a couple of hours.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when I was about to go get my corporal,
Root exclaimed&nbsp; "Hey! Who's</b>
<br><b>been in my locker?!?" for he saw that the towel had been flipped
up onto one</b>
<br><b>of the shelves.&nbsp; Upon investigating, He found that several
things were out of</b>
<br><b>place.&nbsp; When he asked who in the h___ cld of done it in front
of us, "I said</b>
<br><b>you'll never believe me", and went back out to the "Duty Desk"&nbsp;
after all, I</b>
<br><b>really had sen it, I just didn't want to see it again real soon...
and we</b>
<br><b>never did.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well there , anyway.</b>
<br><b>...Finger prints</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our old house, the drive way ended at
the end of the house right by</b>
<br><b>our bed room, so when we heard our car door open and shut&nbsp;
shut, we were</b>
<br><b>justifiably concerned.&nbsp; When I went to investigate, I found
no foot prints in</b>
<br><b>the light snow other than my own, but there were three finger prints
in the</b>
<br><b>lightly frosted of the driver's side window as if from closing the
door.</b>
<br><b>...Butter Dish</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night after coming home from the drive-in
movie, my wife and I saw</b>
<br><b>the silver and crystal butter dish we had gotten for a wedding present
lying</b>
<br><b>in the middle of the kitchen floor ...with the cover still on it!!!&nbsp;
Checking</b>
<br><b>further, I found the cabinet that it never left shut ...swollen
shut, I might</b>
<br><b>add as the cabinets were real wood and it was pretty damp that night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are only a few of the things that
have happened around me or that</b>
<br><b>I've seen.&nbsp; I'll try to send more later.</b><b></b>

<br><b>"Possible Possession Story"</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MatthewRWhite9@netscape.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Intro about me: (just wanted to tell you guys, in case you want to
skip this</b>
<br><b>part and only read the experience)</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, My name is Matthew, but everyone just calls
me Matt.&nbsp; This is my</b>
<br><b>first time telling about one of my almost ubelievably large number
of</b>
<br><b>experiences with supernatural entities.&nbsp; First let me say that
I love this</b>
<br><b>site because it is the only place where I can tell the odd truth
and be</b>
<br><b>believed; it is a wonderful feeling to have the trust of you guys,
because</b>
<br><b>some of my experiences almost seem fictional although I swear that
they are</b>
<br><b>true.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I am actually pretty down to earth and skeptical
until proven wrong.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I try to look at every possible explaination before concluding
that an event</b>
<br><b>is supernatural ... but enough chitter chatter.&nbsp; Here is my
experience ...</b>
<br><b>saying it's a story makes it sound like it's not true.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Experience:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At about two o'clock on a cold night last December,
a good friend of mine</b>
<br><b>named Rick and I were sitting in his truck, talking.&nbsp; Why were
we talking at</b>
<br><b>2:00, you might ask?&nbsp; I had just got back after colleged ended,
and we had</b>
<br><b>alot of catching up to do.&nbsp; Now we had had the heat turned
on for a while,</b>
<br><b>but now it was turned off, so it was not too hot, and not too cold.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Matt," said Rick, suddenly sounding a little
nervous, "I feel like there</b>
<br><b>is something very wrong in here."&nbsp; I remember him saying exactly
that,</b>
<br><b>because the way he said it was really creepy; it was like that kid's
voice in</b>
<br><b>"6th Sence" when he says 'I see dead people.'&nbsp; I hadn't been
paying attention</b>
<br><b>to the surroundings or the atmosphere (just the conversation) until
now, but</b>
<br><b>when I did, I felt the same thing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said something to the extent of "Yeah, I feel
it also.&nbsp; I should leave</b>
<br><b>so you can get home quick.&nbsp; I don't like this feeling."&nbsp;
All of that was</b>
<br><b>true.&nbsp; However, we didn't want to go feeling like this, so
we decided to to</b>
<br><b>turn the radio on and sing along with a song or so to lighten the
atmosphere.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;This is where things started to get really freaky.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the first song went progressed, the feeling
of something wrong</b>
<br><b>steadily escilated.&nbsp; We thought that it was both of our imaginations
working</b>
<br><b>overtime, so we played and sung a second song. About in the middle
of the</b>
<br><b>song, the truck began to get progressively more uncomfortable, and
a little</b>
<br><b>cooler.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this may seem OT, but you know how in Toyota
standard pickup trucks</b>
<br><b>you can cram 3 people in them if one sits in the middle where the
stick shift</b>
<br><b>is?&nbsp; Well, it was cool except for that small middle seat.&nbsp;
Rick reached to</b>
<br><b>turn up the radio, and his hand hit the middle.&nbsp; His face went
white as a</b>
<br><b>sheet, and he told me to touch the middle ... it was hot!!!&nbsp;
Now right inside</b>
<br><b>my house, I have one of those thermometers that can tell you how
cold it is</b>
<br><b>outside or inside, so looking for an excuse for us to leave, I said
"I wonder</b>
<br><b>how hot it is there."&nbsp; Now listen to this!&nbsp; I got the
thermometer, and first</b>
<br><b>I measured how cold it was outside... 15&deg;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The temp.
inside near the door</b>
<br><b>was 45, and then I took the temperature of the hot spot.&nbsp; I
still can't</b>
<br><b>believe it myself, but it was 78&deg;!&nbsp; I had heard of cold
spots, but hot spots?</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't tell Rick this, 'cause I didn't want
to freak him out more than</b>
<br><b>he already was.&nbsp; I said that it was probably some really wierd
thing having</b>
<br><b>to do with the radiator or the engine or something.&nbsp; Concidering
this, Rick</b>
<br><b>turned the car off (not in the rest position, but OFF,) and took
the key out.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;For a second, everything seemed to be going as expected and
we waited for</b>
<br><b>the hot spot in the car to cool down.&nbsp; We even rolled down
the windows, to</b>
<br><b>help.&nbsp; That's when I noticed that the radio was still playing.&nbsp;
I felt</b>
<br><b>butterflies in my stomach, and tapped Rick to make him aware.&nbsp;
I don't know</b>
<br><b>how we didn't notice at first ... how the heck does the radio continue
to</b>
<br><b>play when the vehicle is off?!&nbsp; The rest position, sure, but
when it is off?</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rick turned the truck back on for some reason
or another (I don't</b>
<br><b>remember why, now) and the engine revved ... it sounded like it
was growling,</b>
<br><b>somehow, to Rick and I.&nbsp; I swear, it was like a scene out of
the Stephen King</b>
<br><b>book "Christine."&nbsp; If the brights turned on just then, I probably
would have</b>
<br><b>fainted!!&nbsp; The hot spot was still there, and I can't speak
for Rick, but I</b>
<br><b>felt in danger, and my guess is he did too.&nbsp; Rick wanted to
leave really</b>
<br><b>badly now, I sure can't blame him.&nbsp; He asked me to say a blessing
for us and</b>
<br><b>the truck, and I did, although I didn't really expect anything.&nbsp;
A couple</b>
<br><b>days later, a mechanic looked at the truck ... he said nothing was
wrong with</b>
<br><b>it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are still with me, thank you; this is
by far the most unbelievable</b>
<br><b>(but true, I swear!) experience I have had, and by far the scariest
to me,</b>
<br><b>although there are other close contenders.&nbsp; I hope to share
others, if y'all</b>
<br><b>want to hear them and still think I'm credible after this (I hope
you do, and</b>
<br><b>I think you will be, because everyone was very receptive and open,
at the</b>
<br><b>first chat I've gone to.)&nbsp; About my experience though, if you
can think of</b>
<br><b>anything that might cause something like this, believe that vehicles
can (or</b>
<br><b>even if you think they can't) be possesed, or have had something
similar</b>
<br><b>happen to you, please feel free to e-mail me at matthewrwhite9@netscape.net</b>
<br><b>or ChatManMat@aol.com.&nbsp; I would be delighted to hear from you!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Battlefield ghosts from the Civil War</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dehol@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am 53 yre.old and have been studying the paranormal for at least
35 yrs.</b>
<br><b>but nothing had prepared me for what I would see when I started
taking part</b>
<br><b>in Civil War re-enactments from Penn.to Miss.Gettysburg was the
most</b>
<br><b>extraordinary town and I feel is the most haunted town,including
the</b>
<br><b>Battlefield in America.Mark Nesbitt published 4 vol.on stories/legends
he</b><b></b>
<p><b>collected first hand mostly,and my understanding was those published
were</b>
<br><b>just a small fraction of material he has.I have seen 'ghost' that
had shape</b>
<br><b>and form but were not solid.On one incident,I met a person/'ghost'
who was</b>
<br><b>solid as a rock and&nbsp; from the same Division and Company as
two of my</b>
<br><b>ancestors,cousins,&nbsp; who knew their names, where they came from,
the name of</b>
<br><b>the town, that is,and such information that no re-enactor could
have been</b>
<br><b>playing a joke on me.He gave me his name and where he grew up and
the</b>
<br><b>family name.We were at Gettysburg,PA,doing re-enactments from the
Battle of</b>
<br><b>Gettysburg, fromJuly,1,2,3,1863.We were all dressed in authenic
clothing,</b>
<br><b>down to our socks and shoes,etc.When the oreder came to Charge the
Union</b>
<br><b>lines on Cemetary Ridge, this person shook my hand and told me to
'visit</b>
<br><b>his folks if he didn,t come down back off the hill'.Hundreds of
us marched</b>
<br><b>forward and I tried to keep that 'man' in sight but in the confusion,
he</b>
<br><b>just 'vanished'I've&nbsp; been to his home town and to ss his family
farm,not</b>
<br><b>much of what he described is left, but enough to know he was, at
onetime</b>
<br><b>there.In the family cemetary behind what is left of a barn, is a
headstone</b>
<br><b>that reflects his name&nbsp; and date he died,July 3,1863.More information
is</b>
<br><b>there but it was more difficult to take a rubbing of than name and

<br><b>He Kissed Me</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: roman@eclipse.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was fifteen, I had my first real boyfriend. His name was Liam
and I had been dating him for about a month. I can honestly say that he
was my first love-he was intelligent, caring and sweet, but very dangerously
depressed. For all the time I was dating him we went to movies, talked,
and did things that couples normally do, but he never kissed me. One night
we were on the porch swing behind his house and he brought up the subject
of suicide. He was talking about killing himself and why he would do it,
but I reminded him that there were still people that loved him. Iwent home
later that night. The next morning i stopped at his house to walk with
him to school, but there was a crowd of people around the house and an
ambulance was there. Liam had shot himself in the head; it had killed him
instantly. I was shocked and deeply saddened by this loss. A few hours
later, a suicide note was found in his pocket; it had a note to his parents
and the end of the note said 'I love you, Caro.' about a week later, I
was asleep in the living room. I woke up really late at night. It was very
cold in the room, but that wasn't too weird because the air conditioning
was on. Then I felt something embracing me gently. Strangely enough, I
wasn't scared. Then I felt something on my cheek and a voice whispered
'Sorry, Caro.' I knew it was him and Ii think that he let go and went on
to wherever it is that ghosts go. This happened three years ago. I am a
very skeptical person by nature and I rely on facts, but I can't explain
this. Thank you for reading.</b>
