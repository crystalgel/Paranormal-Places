<b>Am I Crazy?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MeiLien2@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that this may be a question/story that
you may get very often,</b>
<br><b>but I am running out of places to turn and am very confused. I'm
a 17 female</b>
<br><b>living in Long Island with my mother and stepfather. For the past
5 years</b>
<br><b>very odd, almost unreal things have been taking place in my life.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It started when my mother and I moved into my
Uncle's house. At the time</b>
<br><b>I was starting high school. We were living in the house about a
year when my</b>
<br><b>friend Catherine and I were sitting home alone on a summer day.
Please note</b>
<br><b>that there is only one entrance in to my second floor apartment.
Anyhow, we</b>
<br><b>were watching television when we both saw the refrigerator door
open slowly</b>
<br><b>(A view into the kitchen could be seen from the living room) Thing
rattled</b>
<br><b>around and the door closed. My friend Catherine and I investigated,
and</b>
<br><b>after seeing nothing, she left the house never to come back. She
wouldn't even</b>
<br><b>speak to me after that incident.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One evening, about three months later, my mother
and I were sitting and</b>
<br><b>watching television. I was drinking, I don;t know, some juice or
something</b>
<br><b>in a glass. I set the glass down on the end-table near me, also
glass. A few</b>
<br><b>minutes passed by when I saw the glass slowly move from it's original
place</b>
<br><b>to the end of the table and stop. I picked up the glass, put it
back, and</b>
<br><b>again it moved, slowly. I asked my mother to watch, but when I placed
the</b>
<br><b>glass in it's original position, it wouldn't move. I explained to
my mother</b>
<br><b>that I saw the glass move, but of course she did not believe me.
We</b>
<br><b>continued to watch television, I a little freaked out, my mother
annoyed. A little</b>
<br><b>later I lifted the cup again, took a drink, and placed it down.
This time, I</b>
<br><b>heard my mother gasp. She said that she, too, had just seen the
glass move.</b>
<br><b>With her watching, I picked up the glass and put it down. Slowly,
the glass</b>
<br><b>moved to the end of the table. When my mother tried, the glass did
not move.</b>
<br><b>My mother crouched down in front of the table. She asked me to pick
up the</b>
<br><b>glass again. I did, and the glass flew very quickly towards my mother.
She</b>
<br><b>caught it and the contents spilled everywhere. After that, whatever
we</b>
<br><b>placed on the table would not move.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few months after that I was alone in my house.
I swear to God this</b>
<br><b>happened, but no one believes. I was watching television at night
and</b>
<br><b>decided</b>
<br><b>I was going to go to bed. Before I even reached for the remote,
the screen</b>
<br><b>went blank. Printed on the black screen in the top left corned was
the word</b>
<br><b>"Goodnight." The screen remained blank and I quickly phoned my mother,
whom</b>
<br><b>was staying with her boyfriend in a neighboring town.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another incident in the house included two soda
can that were sitting on</b>
<br><b>top of my entertainment center. I had just come home, and as I took
off my</b>
<br><b>coat I heard a "Ping" noise. I looked up in the direction where
the "Ping"</b>
<br><b>had come from, and it was the soda cans. Two more "Ping" noises
followed and</b>
<br><b>I watched as one of the cans moved slightly, as if someone had flicked
it</b>
<br><b>with their finger. The other one, in almost a responsive way, "pinged"
back.</b>
<br><b>I could not tell you how long the conversation between these two
cans</b>
<br><b>lasted,because after about&nbsp; seconds I ran downstairs to my
uncle's apartment and</b>
<br><b>called my mother.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My best friend Gillian loved my apartment. She
would often hear the same</b>
<br><b>things I did and loved the fact that my stereo (Model RCA RP-9115)
would</b>
<br><b>turn on without warning, change stations, and even skip songs on
both tape and CD</b>
<br><b>that the so called "Ghost" did not like. A song it seemed to have
hated was</b>
<br><b>Goo-Goo Dolls "Iris." On tape, CD and radio, the stereo would either
skip to</b>
<br><b>the next song, or turn off.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gillian also claims to have had her own experiences
in the apartment. I</b>
<br><b>was asleep on the couch in the living room one evening (Gillian
was spending</b>
<br><b>the night) and Gillian was using our computer, located right next
to the</b>
<br><b>television. She said (Be aware I was not witness to this) that the</b>
<br><b>television turned on, changed channels, and stopped on some movie,
I forget which.</b>
<br><b>Believing that I was lying on the remote, Gillian though nothing
of it and</b>
<br><b>turned off the TV manually. The television turned back on. After
battling on</b>
<br><b>and off with the television, Gillian noticed that the remote control
was on</b>
<br><b>top of the entertainment center. She woke me up immediately to tell
me what</b>
<br><b>AHD happened. I turned off the TV and it did not turn back on.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people, after hearing the stories of my
house, begged for the</b>
<br><b>chance to spend the night. Everyone of them (With the exception
of the friend</b>
<br><b>Bridget) have experienced something they referred to as "Scary shit"
(Pardon</b>
<br><b>my language) Some of these events, but not all, I have witnessed
with them:</b>
<br><b>Candles blowing out suddenly, flames rising from candles, footsteps
coming</b>
<br><b>from the ceiling, knocking noises from walls, cats hissing at thin
air, and</b>
<br><b>many people just AHD a n eerie feeling.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After 4 years of living with strange incidences
such as these, hearing</b>
<br><b>noises, and watching my two cats chase imaginary things across the
room, as</b>
<br><b>well as run from them, my mother and I moved from the apartment
into a new</b>
<br><b>one with her boyfriend and his 5 year old daughter. We set up the
apartment</b>
<br><b>and thought nothing more of the "Ghostly" happenings. But now, three
months</b>
<br><b>after moving into the new apartment, the strange occurrences are
back. Late</b>
<br><b>at night I hear something that sounds like heavy breathing coming
from our</b>
<br><b>kitchen (It is located right next to my bedroom) even now, as I
type, I hear</b>
<br><b>it. When I don;t hear this noise, strange things happen to both
me and my</b>
<br><b>family members. My stepfather has been witness to picture frames
falling at</b>
<br><b>will, my stepsister said, and I quote "The ghost did it," when being
blamed</b>
<br><b>for crumbling a bunch of cookies all over the table. Things rattling,</b>
<br><b>shadows passing by unoccupied areas of the house, and as of last
night, violent</b>
<br><b>acts.</b>
<br><b>My fiance `John and I were playing chess. We sat at our dining room
table,</b>
<br><b>my mother with us, my stepfather doing dishes int he kitchen, and
my stepsister</b>
<br><b>in bed. My mother, fiancee `and I were startled by t loud "Clang".
Something</b>
<br><b>had hit my metal chair, hard. I heard it, felt it, everything. We
searched</b>
<br><b>for what the noise could have been, but we had not clue. Nothing
was on the</b>
<br><b>floor and no one could have thrown anything at it without being
seen.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, though this may not be connected, I have
had dreams of a "little</b>
<br><b>man" visiting me in bed at night. He crawls onto my bed, smiles,
and talks</b>
<br><b>with me for hours. I cannot remember our conversations, but I can
remember</b>
<br><b>things he tells me. Usually, predictions. The scariest one, that
my mother</b>
<br><b>will also vouch to be true, is one that even creeps me out. "Little
man" (As</b>
<br><b>my family and I call him) said that I would be eating fruit in my
kitchen</b>
<br><b>and my mother would come in to tell me that an old friend of hers
was dead. The</b>
<br><b>next day I was eating a piece of watermelon, in our kitchen, when
my mother</b>
<br><b>came in. She started to say "An old friend from school..." I interrupted
her</b>
<br><b>and said "He's dead." Shocked at how I knew information she had
learned only</b>
<br><b>a little whiles earlier, I explained everything about my dreams.
Other</b>
<br><b>predictions have included my friend Will being stabbed with a fork,
my</b>
<br><b>friend Gillian hurting herself with a video camera and others. Also,
recently, I</b>
<br><b>have been able to "Read peoples thoughts" as my fiance `puts it.
I hear</b>
<br><b>things that other people are thinking. Example, my fiance ` and
I were</b>
<br><b>driving home when we saw the gas prices had gone down to 1.69. I
was driving</b>
<br><b>and I know I heard him say "So why don;t we ever try the "69" position".
I</b>
<br><b>answered him, "Because it's immoral." John looked at me and asked
why I had</b>
<br><b>said that. I explained that I was answering his question, but he
said that</b>
<br><b>he was only thinking that and did not say a thing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be honest, I'm not even sure why I am writing
to you. I suppose I</b>
<br><b>Only want to know if what all my bible-beating friend say is true.
I, myself, am</b>
<br><b>haunted. I don;t believe in ghosts, I want to state that plainly
right now.</b>
<br><b>I have been in so-called "Haunted" places and have seen nothing,
nor felt any</b>
<br><b>presences when others claimed they have. I guess I'm just looking
for</b>
<br><b>reassurance that there are logical explanations for everything that
has</b>
<br><b>happened to me. Maybe you can offer some help, or even answers,
to why these</b>
<br><b>thins happen to me. Maybe then I can fix them. Just please do not
think of</b>
<br><b>me as one of those juvenile children who tell stories.</b>

<p><b>American Club</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Bellaspankster@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My father used to work at the American Club (a high class resort)
in</b>
<br><b>Wisc.&nbsp; It used to be housing for alot of immigrants back in
the day.&nbsp; It has</b>
<br><b>many hall ways with many old pictures of some of the old residents.&nbsp;
There</b>
<br><b>are many ghost stories told by the workers there.&nbsp; I seemed
that each hallway</b>
<br><b>has a different ghost and different story behind it.&nbsp; My father,
on numerous</b>
<br><b>occasions, had felt cold spots and uncomfortable feelilngs as if
he were</b>
<br><b>being watched.&nbsp; There is a tavern in the club that is supposed
to be haunted</b>
<br><b>also. It used to be a bowling alley for the wealthy residents.&nbsp;
Last but not</b>
<br><b>least, there is an old stable on the grounds that is very spooky.&nbsp;
Workers</b>
<br><b>think it was built on "bad ground".&nbsp; None of the horses would
stay in the</b>
<br><b>stable, always kicking their way out.&nbsp; They had to build another
stable to</b>
<br><b>house the horses, but were too afraid to tear down the old stable,
fearing</b>
<br><b>that whatever was occuping the stable would move into the hotel.&nbsp;
On the only</b>
<br><b>occasion my father went into the old barn (before he knew of any
ghost story)</b>
<br><b>he claims it was very cold, with dead air and dead silence.&nbsp;
He said all the</b>
<br><b>birds that were cherping out side could not be heard and he felt
like there</b>
<br><b>was something there that immedialy tried to push him back out of
the stable.</b>
<br><b>He ran out in fear, and felt as if whatever it was followed him
out to make</b>
<br><b>sure he wouldnt turn back to come inside again.</b>
<br><b>Hope that makes some sense!&nbsp; It would be interesting if you
could check these</b>
<br><b>stories out.&nbsp; We would like to know if anything or any real
happenings are</b>
<br><b>behind these strange things.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;My first experience with spirits was when I was three years
old.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I was lying between my parents in a bed in a motel room</b>
<br><b>and I began to feel nervous when I realized they were dozing off
and I</b>
<br><b>was still awake. I was staring up at the ceiling when three faces</b>
<br><b>appeared. They were round. One green, one red, and one</b>
<br><b>blue. I remember they spoke to me and their expressions terrified</b>
<br><b>me as much as their words although I dot remember what they were
saying.</b>
<br><b>I woke my mother and they disappeared, she comforted me and turned
over</b>
<br><b>to fall asleep. Soon after they appeared again. I dont remember</b>
<br><b>anything else but I know that my parents ended up rushing me to
the hospital</b>
<br><b>because I was so terrified. They brought me in screaming and the</b>
<br><b>doctors had to sedate me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My second experience was when I was five. My</b>
<br><b>older sister asked me if I would go get her a drink of water late
at night.</b>
<br><b>When I returned from the kitchen I saw a glowing spirit that blocked
me</b>
<br><b>from the hallway and standing in front of the stairway. I was terrified</b>
<br><b>of this woman who was staring at me. Later I saw a photograph of</b>
<br><b>my great-grandmother and realized the entity was her, it looked
exactly</b>
<br><b>like her. When I asked my mother her opinion of why grandma would</b>
<br><b>frighten me in such a way she told me that perhaps it was to protect
me</b>
<br><b>from falling down the stairs. Since then I have been visited in
dreams</b>
<br><b>and no longer fear her as now she appears young and beautiful and
gives</b>
<br><b>me advice. Her last visit with me was at her home and the last thing</b>
<br><b>she told me to do was "Take out the garbage". I know this had a
powerful</b>
<br><b>meaning but I dot know how.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The third major experience I had was after I had</b>
<br><b>been listening to music. I was twelve and my sister and I shared</b>
<br><b>a room. Our bed was near the doorway and faced it. I was wide</b>
<br><b>awake in the dark thinking about the day. Suddenly the moon was
dark</b>
<br><b>and the crickets stopped chirping. A tall dark figure darker than</b>
<br><b>the pitch dark of the room stood in the doorway next to my sister.</b>
<br><b>I began to feel as if I was being choked I gasped for air and tried
to</b>
<br><b>wake my sister but realized I was paralyzed. I couldn't move even</b>
<br><b>my little finger to pinch my sister beside me. In my mind I prayed</b>
<br><b>to God to save me. I kept saying my mind "I rebuke you Satan in
the</b>
<br><b>name of the Lord." Finally after what seemed like several minutes</b>
<br><b>it disappeared, the moonlight and cricket sounds came back. I was</b>
<br><b>terrified and tears poured from my eyes as I felt completely unsafe
by</b>
<br><b>the boundaries we call reality.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The last experience I had was just a few months ago.</b>
<br><b>It was early in the morning and I was laying in bed when I</b>
<br><b>began to feel a sharp pain in my cheek. The pain kept getting worse</b>
<br><b>and I tried to brush it off thinking it would go away. After a while</b>
<br><b>it began to irritate me so much I got up and looked in the mirror.</b>
<br><b>I had a three inch scratch across my cheek. It was bleeding slightly</b>
<br><b>and fresh as if it had just happened. Confused I went back to my</b>
<br><b>bed to see if I could find anything to explain it. I felt my sheets,</b>
<br><b>my pillow, and my fingernails. There was nothing there to explain</b>
<br><b>it. The more I searched and the more I thought about it the more</b>
<br><b>I realized how impossible it could be. I was alone in the house.</b>
<br><b>When I look at the scar today it affects me deeply. I dot know how</b>
<br><b>to deal with the physical aspect of what happened and hope it never
happens</b>
<br><b>again to anyone. Needless to say I have many more stories including</b>
<br><b>crawling noises, cupboards banging, toilets flushing, and an electronic</b>
<br><b>toy monkey whose ears started spinning but I am not afraid</b>
<br><b>anymore. I wish I knew why these things happen and have spent my</b>
<br><b>life trying to make sense of it all. Thanks for listening.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Angry Visitor</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Kirk@HEI-KC.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>In the early 1990's, I was about 13,I lived in a very old house in</b>
<br><b>Greenwood, Mo.&nbsp; It was said to have been built in the late
1880's by a</b>
<br><b>farmer. The layout of the house was very odd. Quite frequently you
could hear strange</b>
<br><b>noises, boards would creek as if someone were walking.&nbsp; Breezes
would sweep</b>
<br><b>by you when no windows were open.&nbsp; Minor strange things, and
at the time I</b>
<br><b>paid little attention to them. One Saturday afternoon, my older
sister and I</b>
<br><b>were watching TV.&nbsp; My brother was outside in the back yard.&nbsp;
While we were</b>
<br><b>watching 'The Hunt for The Red October', The front door swung open
very</b>
<br><b>violently.&nbsp; Startled, my sister and got up to see what had
happened.&nbsp; As we</b>
<br><b>approached the door, we heard someone running up the stairs.&nbsp;
The stairs</b>
<br><b>were located behind us and it was an enclosed stairway, so we couldn't
see</b>
<br><b>if anyone was there.&nbsp; We slowly approached the bottom of the
stairs, and</b>
<br><b>started our way up.&nbsp; As we got to the third step, a man shouted
from</b>
<br><b>upstairs,&nbsp; "Where is it!"&nbsp; Freaked out, we ran for the
back door through the</b>
<br><b>kitchen.&nbsp; We told my brother and the three of us went in together.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>brother was carrying a baseball bat, and I picked up a kitchen knife
on our</b>
<br><b>way back in.&nbsp; When we reached the bottom of the stairs, my
brother yelled</b>
<br><b>up, "Get out of here or we'll call the police!".&nbsp; We didn't
hear anything.</b>
<br><b>We stood there literally shaking.&nbsp; After a brief pause we continued
single</b>
<br><b>file up the stairs.&nbsp; Making it halfway up the stairs slowly,
broads creaking</b>
<br><b>under our feet, a man shouted again.&nbsp; "I'm gonna kill you,
you</b>
<br><b>son-of-a-bitch!"&nbsp; Following the shouting, we heard someone
stomping towards</b>
<br><b>the master bedroom door from the inside of the room.&nbsp; We were
so terrified</b>
<br><b>we dropped every thing and just ran out of the house and went to
the</b>
<br><b>neighbors.&nbsp; After the police arrived and found no one in the
house, the</b>
<br><b>three of us assumed it was a ghost.&nbsp; From that day on in that
house every</b>
<br><b>time I heard a strange noise, or felt that strange breeze, I was
taken back</b>
<br><b>to the terror that coursed through my body on that afternoon.</b>

<p><b>Cherry Tobacco</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Megan_Simmons@teamhealth.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a yr ago, I emailed one of my first
hand ghost stories to the</b>
<br><b>website.&nbsp; While that one was extremely frightening, this one
is not.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>believe that my grandfather haunts my family.&nbsp; Although maybe
"haunt" is</b>
<br><b>too harsh a word.&nbsp; He is more like a friendly visitor.&nbsp;
My grandfather</b>
<br><b>passed away from a heart attack in April 1984.&nbsp; My mother being
a devout</b>
<br><b>Christian always worried about where my grandfather ended up (i.e.
heaven</b>
<br><b>or hell) when he passed away.&nbsp; Well about 3-4 yrs after he
died, she</b>
<br><b>started smelling a sweet, cherry tobacco smell in our house.&nbsp;
Now this</b>
<br><b>always puzzled her because no one has ever smoked in our house.&nbsp;
She always</b>
<br><b>happened to be alone when this smell came, but once, I was with
her and</b>
<br><b>could not smell it.&nbsp; That was extremely odd, but we still didn't
know what</b>
<br><b>it was.&nbsp; However, one day, my mother happened to be talking
to my</b>
<br><b>grandmother about the pipe smell, and my Nana said that my grandfather
used</b>
<br><b>to smoke that particular type of tobacco, but gave it up way before
my</b>
<br><b>mother was born in 1950.&nbsp; Well now we knew the smell was, but
didn't know</b>
<br><b>why.&nbsp; Mother feels it is because he was letting her know that
everything is</b>
<br><b>okay.&nbsp; We have all noticed that we will smell that smell at
infrequent odd</b>
<br><b>times.&nbsp; When my sister first started dating her husband 4 years
ago,</b>
<br><b>Pop-pop said "hi" to him, but no one else smelled it.&nbsp; Once
when I was</b>
<br><b>playing with my sister, I smelled it but she didn't.&nbsp; Earlier
in the year,</b>
<br><b>I was at home (not my mother's house), and I walked into the room
and there</b>
<br><b>was that smell.&nbsp; I just stopped for a minute and said "hi,
Pop-pop."&nbsp; It is</b>
<br><b>never frightening, and always smelling that smell makes me feel
comforted</b>
<br><b>and loved.</b>

<p><b>Awesome Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was 11 yrs. old at the time, My family had moved from Kansas,to
Southwest</b>
<br><b>Mo. two years before this incident. It was an old house, that belonged
to my</b>
<br><b>aunt. MY two teenage sisters had several experiences with ghost
in the two</b>
<br><b>years that we had been there. But I hadnt seen or heard anything
until that</b>
<br><b>night.- I woke up in the middle of the night,for no reason. I was
sitting up</b>
<br><b>in bed, wide awake. I dont know why, but I called for my mother.
She was a</b>
<br><b>heavy woman, and you could here her get up and walk in the bed room
where I</b>
<br><b>was.I knew she wouldnt be too happy with me for getting her up,
so I was</b>
<br><b>trying to think of something to tell her. The room was pitch dark.I
could</b>
<br><b>barely see my mother ,and she was wearing a white nightgown.But,
I could</b>
<br><b>hear her. Behind her, a ghost walked in.He was almost snow white.
Like a</b>
<br><b>thick white cloud,very dence.I couldn't see through him at all.
He was</b>
<br><b>almost glowing. The awesome thing about this ghost was, that I could
see</b>
<br><b>every thing about him. even his eyelashes. The clothes he had on
looked like</b>
<br><b>Kaki's. Like some kind of workers uniform. But of course they were
all</b>
<br><b>white. I really can't find the words to describe him.I could see
his pocket</b>
<br><b>flaps, the hair on his head short, like it had been buzzed off army
style.</b>
<br><b>Little tiny threads sticking from his clothes. Needless to say I
was sitting</b>
<br><b>there with my mouth gapped open,big eyes, not hearing my mother.
She finally</b>
<br><b>got loud enough to get my attention. She was saying, whats wrong
with you?</b>
<br><b>What do you want? I told her I wanted a glass of water. she went
into the</b>
<br><b>kitchen,and he followed her.I wasn't really that scared, just in
shock I</b>
<br><b>think. There was a thousand things going through my mind. After
they went</b>
<br><b>into the next room, I looked through the crack in the door, where
the hinges</b>
<br><b>are, to see if he was still behind her--he was. I could hear her
getting the</b>
<br><b>water, and I figured when she turned around to come back,she would
see him.</b>
<br><b>I was waiting for her to scream or something. But she didn't. So,
here she</b>
<br><b>comes in the bedroom with the glass of water,with the ghost right
behind</b>
<br><b>her. I guess I went into my gapped mouth, big eye thing again. When
she</b>
<br><b>finally got my attention,she was saying--Do you want this or not?
Whats</b>
<br><b>wrong with you? I pointed to him and said, there's a ghost. She
said,where?</b>
<br><b>I said , behind you. She didnt really look behind her. She looked
down, kind</b>
<br><b>of beside her foot, and said, oh there is not. I took the glass
of water,</b>
<br><b>and she went back in her bedroom. He was behind her all the way.
This ghost</b>
<br><b>had his hands in his pants pockets. He didnt do anything to scare
me. It was</b>
<br><b>like he was just hanging around, bored, Nothing else better to do.
I didn't</b>
<br><b>mention that he was tall and thin, and he had boots on. All white
of course.</b>
<br><b>And this whole time , he never looked at me . Never even looked
my</b>
<br><b>direction. Until he was going back out the door, following my mother.
And</b>
<br><b>when he was in the door way, Just before he went through it, he
turned</b>
<br><b>completely around and looked me right in the eye. And he said I
know you can</b>
<br><b>see me. Thats when my heart leaped into my throat.It really felt
like it. I</b>
<br><b>never seen him again. But I,ve seen alot of other ghost. That was
37 years</b>
<br><b>ago,and I still remember that like it was yesterday. When I got
older, I</b>
<br><b>thought about it alot, and it seems like he was not looking my direction,</b>
<br><b>and acting nonchalant, so that I wouldnt be afraid. Oh I wish I
could</b>
<br><b>describe those white eyeballs! I swear this is true. Ive told a
few people</b>
<br><b>about it. I dont know if they believed me or not. Don't really care
either!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Billy</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: deedee@etcrier.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've been reading these storys for about a year now and finally decided
to write about mine. I've told some people about this&nbsp; but I could
tell nobody thought anything about it and they all changed the subject
quickly. I dont know what you would call this experience but I know it
wasnt a dream. In early 1990 I was engaged to the love of my life, Billy.
We were crazy about&nbsp; each other. We had just moved to a new town and
Billy made a new friend whom I HATED. I always felt bad things when this
friend was around. I worked nights and Billy worked days so I knew they
were hanging out at night when I wasnt around. This is where my nightmare
began. I returned home one hot summer night from work and Billy wasnt home.
His wallet was still on the table which was weird. after about an hour
I started growng angry because I just knew he was out with his friend cruizing
around and I couldnt believe he hadnt even called me yet. (He knew what
time I came home from work) and his friend just got a new camaro.&nbsp;
Well I fell asleep finally and awoke at about 5:30 in the morning and Billy
still wasnt home. I began to worry like crazy and felt I needed to turn
on the t.v. for some reason. As SOON as I did I saw a terrible crash on
the news that had happened the night before and all that was recognizable
were the rims on the car- I recognized them immediatly. They were asking
for help to identify the passenger whom had no identification. Well needless
to say my love was killed when his friend did a u-turn on the freeway right
in front of a big rig. He was also killed and they found alcohol in his
blood stream. For the next two weeks I kept having these terrible nightmares
where I was sitting in the passenger seat and watching the semi truck smack
into me. I would wake up crying hard and could even smell the wreck. This
dream happened EVERY NIGHT. I felt so sad and tired and confused I didnt
want to go on anymore. Then after finally falling asleep I had this incredible
"dream"? I was at a bbq with all of Billy and my friends from our home
town. It was in a back yard and all of the colors were so bright and vivid
I cant even describe them. Everyone was having the best time and someone
told me that Billy was there but he was on the other side of the fence.
I climbed to the top of the fence to look over and there stood Billy. He
looked like he was lit up from the inside out with bright colors and he
was smiling. He began to speak to me and told me that he could NOT come
over the fence and join the party and that I couldnt come to his side of
the fence but everything was o.k. and he would see me again. He said he
was in an accident and he was dissapointed at his friend for being drunk
and that he wanted to come home when his friend just turned into traffic.
He also told me it didnt hurt and that he loved me very much and that I
would be o.k. from now on. Suddenly I woke up and felt a peace that only
God could give someone. My heart was filled with a happiness I"ve never
felt before or since. I never again had that nightmare I was having. I
still dont believe it was a "dream" as I remeber every detail and color
I saw and it felt so real. Also, if it was a dream why did I awake with
such a peace in my body (from head to toes!) Well sorry for the lenght
I dont get to tell this story very often.</b>

<p><b>Under The Bed</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: VPS027@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My son Jason had a very strange experience when he was three years
old.</b>
<br><b>This day I was in my bedroom sitting at the head of the bed folding
some</b>
<br><b>clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jason came into the room and wanted to play.&nbsp;
He loved to rough</b>
<br><b>house on the bed, so we started to play.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right in the
middle of me pushing</b>
<br><b>him over on his back he said, "Mommy, what's that?"&nbsp;&nbsp;
He was pointing towards</b>
<br><b>the bedroom door and said that an animal had just come into the
room.&nbsp;&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>followed the animal with his finger, as it moved along the foot
of the bed</b>
<br><b>and then down the side and under the bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said, "It
went under the bed."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;He got off the bed and looked, but said that it wasn't there.</b>
<br><b>To begin with, Jason didn't make up things or have&nbsp; an imaginary
playmate or</b>
<br><b>that sort of thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew he'd seen something because
of the circustances</b>
<br><b>of him seeing it, how he stopped in mid-playing to point at what
he saw.&nbsp;&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>told him to come to me and I sat him on my lap and started asking
him</b>
<br><b>questions about what he'd seen.</b>
<br><b>He said that it was a tall black animal with ears that stood up
like a dog.</b>
<br><b>When I asked how tall it was he said, "Like Daddy," which would
be 5' 11". I</b>
<br><b>asked him what sort of hair it had and he said, "Like the Mouse."&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the</b>
<br><b>time we had a black short haired dog we called Mouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;
He said that this</b>
<br><b>animal was walking on it's back feet while holding it's front feet
up at</b>
<br><b>chest level with the paws hanging down.&nbsp; He said that it looked
at him the</b>
<br><b>whole time it was walking around the bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked about
the eyes and he</b>
<br><b>said they looked like "dog eyes."</b>
<br><b>Years later in middle school, one of Jason's classes was studing
Egypt.</b>
<br><b>Jason came home from school and told me, "I can finally show you
what that</b>
<br><b>animal I saw looked like."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He opened a text
book and showed me a picture</b>
<br><b>of the Egyptian God Anubus.</b>
<br><b>I have always thought it was such a weird thing for a small child
to see</b>
<br><b>something so strange.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is 21 years old now and still
remembers the</b>
<br><b>experience very vividly.</b>
<br><b>If anyone at Shadowlands could shed some light on this, Jason and
I would</b>
<br><b>most grateful.</b>

<br><b>Checking Up</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sixtiesflowerchild@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have a cousin, Amber, whose father died when she was</b>
<br><b>in the third grade.&nbsp; Shortly after his death, we and</b>
<br><b>two other young friends went to her grandmother's</b>
<br><b>farmhouse.&nbsp; We were sitting on a gaswell on a hill</b>
<br><b>next to her farmhouse. Farther up the hill there was a</b>
<br><b>tree line. We were all just talking when suddenly</b>
<br><b>Amanda, one of our friends, and I looked up the hill</b>
<br><b>to the tree line.&nbsp; "Ashley, Amanda, how are you girls</b>
<br><b>today?" asked a man dressed in orange hunting garb. We</b>
<br><b>did a classic movie double-take at each other and</b>
<br><b>tried screaming back up the hill to the man.&nbsp; He was</b>
<br><b>gone. The other two girls asked why we were screaming,</b>
<br><b>at who? They didn't see the man, they didn't hear the</b>
<br><b>man. We later learned that hunting season wasn't in.</b>
<br><b>We also learned that Amber's father had been to her</b>
<br><b>grandmother's house after hunting to get some Tylenol</b>
<br><b>because he wasn't feeling good, less than a week</b>
<br><b>before he was found dead from a heart attack in his</b>
<br><b>mechanic's garage. That was nearly a decade ago and I</b>
<br><b>still can't say for sure if that was her father</b>
<br><b>checking up on us or not. How could anyone else know</b>
<br><b>it was us from such a distance? All I can say is that</b>
<br><b>I'm not the only one who saw it and heard it. Amanda</b>
<br><b>to this day still doesn't like to talk about it</b>
<br><b>because it makes her so uncomfortable.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Cold Hands</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Auburn</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night while lying in bed I was softly singing
"The Heart Will Go On"</b>
<br><b>from Titanic, which had been the last song to play on the radio
before I</b>
<br><b>turned it off.&nbsp; I was also thinking of my friend Robert (name
has been</b>
<br><b>changed) who had been tragically killed years before in a hit and
run</b>
<br><b>accident.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reaching a very poignant part of the song which
made my heart long to see</b>
<br><b>Robert's face again, I started to cry.&nbsp; Out of the darness,
very cold hands</b>
<br><b>touched my arm, stroking it in a comforting manner.&nbsp; I kept
my eyes closed,</b>
<br><b>and to this very day I don't understand why I didn't panic, scream,
or move</b>
<br><b>in any way.&nbsp; I just kept softly singing.&nbsp; Those cold hands
were then were</b>
<br><b>touching my hair.&nbsp; I could feel fingers running through my
hair and</b>
<br><b>occasionally touching my face.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I finished the song I felt something very
cold pressing against my</b>
<br><b>forehead, which felt remarkably like lips.&nbsp; Just as I was about
to fall</b>
<br><b>asleep I heard a soft voice whisper, "I am here.&nbsp; I am always
here."&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>promptly fell asleep and dreamt of Robert throughout the night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To this day I believe that it was him coming
to let me know that he is</b>

<p><b>Colson Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: margiator@budweiser.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My dad's ex-wife's maiden name is Colson. My dad is still pretty
good friends</b>
<br><b>with most of the Colson family. Recently, my older half sister had
a child, so</b>
<br><b>of course, my dad's ex-wife was in to be here for the birth, etc.
I had the</b>
<br><b>opportunity to talk to her and she shared some stories with me from
"The</b>
<br><b>Colson Farm House". It's a house that has been owned by the Colson
family</b>
<br><b>for about 100 years or maybe even more. It's just been passed down.
She told me</b>
<br><b>a story of when she was a kid living near the house. She wasn't
allowed in the</b>
<br><b>house but she wanted to show it to one of her friends. So one day
they went in</b>
<br><b>there. They were upstairs when they heard the kitchen door slam.
Then they heard</b>
<br><b>men's footsteps downstairs. Immediately she thought "Oh no, it's
Grandad.</b>
<br><b>He'll kill me." There was 2 staircases in the house, one at each
end. So</b>
<br><b>she and her friend decided to wait and see which stairs her grandfather
would</b>
<br><b>take and they would take the opposite down. The man's footsteps
stopped. They</b>
<br><b>didn't come up the stairs. So they went on downstairs and there
was no one</b>
<br><b>there. The kitchen door was locked, just as they had left it. Everything
was the</b>
<br><b>same.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Colson family was good friends with
a man named Roy. Roy was a repair</b>
<br><b>man and could fix or make anything. He was a very BIG man and was
known to be</b>
<br><b>very tough. He wasn't scared of snakes, or anything. He had been
in the crawl</b>
<br><b>space under the house once and a copper head fell on him and he
killed it with</b>
<br><b>his bare hands right there. Anyways, the family hired him to do
something to the</b>
<br><b>house this one time and it required him to go under the house and
work on some</b>
<br><b>wires. He was crawling along and then all of a sudden there's a
woman's voice</b>
<br><b>right in front of his face that says "ROY! BOO!" He crawled out
of that thing as</b>
<br><b>fast as he possibly could and he hasn't gone back in since. Now,
he won't even go</b>
<br><b>into the house without someone with him because he has heard voices
and at one point</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;he heard footsteps and they kept getting closer and he finally
felt someone just</b>
<br><b>brush past him and the footsteps kept going, but he never saw anyone.
There's only</b>
<br><b>3 or 4 people that have been in that house that hasn't seen or heard
something. I've</b>
<br><b>never been in it, but I think it would be incredibly awesome to
go into it.</b>

<p><b>Compiled Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dwreck19@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have many ghost stories. Much that were told to me by family members
who</b>
<br><b>seem to be more sensitive than I to the paranormal. I'll start out
with some</b>
<br><b>stories my parents told me.</b>
<br><b>My parents are both from the same area. They grew up in Anderson
and Belton,</b>
<br><b>SC. One night, when they were dating, they decided to park next
to some</b>
<br><b>woods. As they were sitting there talking, my dad saw one little
speck of</b>
<br><b>light appear in the woods, kind-of like a lightning bug except it
didn't</b>
<br><b>blink. Then, many more started appearing throughout the woods directly</b>
<br><b>infront of my parents and their parked car. Suddenly, the whole
woods were</b>
<br><b>filled with tiny specks of light. Then the lights began to move
towards the</b>
<br><b>car. Needless to say, my parents got out of there.</b>
<br><b>Another more recent story happened to my mom one night while she
was in bed</b>
<br><b>at her mother's (my grandmother's) house. Before I tell the rest
of the</b>
<br><b>story, let me tell a little about the house in which my grandmother
lives.</b>
<br><b>The house was built during the civil war. It used to be a small
log cabin</b>
<br><b>but was later covered in wood and a new part was added on to make
the house</b>
<br><b>bigger. The house has had a few people to die in it over the many
years. And</b>
<br><b>the particular room where my mom was sleeping was supposed to be
where a</b>
<br><b>woman died of scarlet fever during the civil war time period. Ever
since I</b>
<br><b>was very young I can remember feeling very strange in that room.
As if I was</b>
<br><b>never alone. Okay, back to the story. As my mom was lying there,
she heard a</b>
<br><b>voice tell her not to open up her eyes no matter what. So, being
the</b>
<br><b>spiritual person she is, she did as the voice said. A few moments
later, she</b>
<br><b>heard a scratching sound on the screen of the window right behind
her head.</b>
<br><b>As if someone was sliding their fingernails down slowly. She said
that it</b>
<br><b>stopped after a few minutes but she didn't open her eyes for the
rest of the</b>
<br><b>night. The next morning she went outside to where the window is
and looked</b>
<br><b>for any bushes or tree limbs that could have caused it but saw nothing.</b>
<br><b>Another time, my dad was lying in the same room sleeping and was
awoken by a</b>
<br><b>loud car crash outside. Saying he could hear the glass breaking
and metal</b>
<br><b>bending. He said he jumped up and grabbed a flashlight and ran down
to the</b>
<br><b>road but saw nothing. It was very quiet outside.</b>
<br><b>Even another time in this same room, when I was about 3 years old,
I was</b>
<br><b>lying on the floor on a mattress behind the bed where my parents
slept. I</b>
<br><b>remember waking up and seeing a woman in a white dress walk by me.
I thought</b>
<br><b>that it was my mother so I called for her. Finally, my mother answered
me in</b>
<br><b>the bed. She had been sleeping the entire time.</b>
<br><b>I have many more ghost stories that really happened but I'll save
those for</b>
<br><b>another time.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Confusion About My Uncle</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Dsbutterfly5@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I was about 6 or 7 when my uncle&nbsp; died I never met him he lived
in Europe.</b>
<br><b>Well, I guess I did meet him once when I was a baby but obviously
I cant</b>
<br><b>remember. Anyhow throughout my life I've had several encounters
(I guess</b>
<br><b>that's what you would call them) but nothing major. Until one night
I was</b>
<br><b>about 17 and I was lying in bed I woke up and I remember someone
knocking on</b>
<br><b>my door in the middle of the night which I thought was odd. (we
don't knock</b>
<br><b>in our house) I said to come in the door opened and there was this
man</b>
<br><b>standing by my bed, but I couldn't remember him walking towards
me?? Anyhow</b>
<br><b>he was quite tall and there was another man standing beside him
really short</b>
<br><b>almost a midget maybe? They were surrounded by a blue light very
dull light.</b>
<br><b>I remember looking at this man not feeling afraid but knowing that
he was</b>
<br><b>dead. He looked dead. Does that make sense? Not gross or anything
just dead.</b>
<br><b>Anyhow for weeks after that I didn't see him but overnight when
I would sleep</b>
<br><b>I could feel someone in the bed with me, I could feel there arm
around me or</b>
<br><b>stroking my hair I felt safe. Anyhow one night the knock on my door
came</b>
<br><b>again and the man was standing there with that other little man
and he was</b>
<br><b>begging me to leave my bed so that he could sleep he complained
of how tired</b>
<br><b>he was and that he hadn't slept for a long time. I didn't question
it I</b>
<br><b>didn't even answer him I just got up and went to my mothers room.
My mother</b>
<br><b>woke up asked me what was wrong I told her brother (my uncle) asked
me to</b>
<br><b>leave my room so that he could sleep. Well, she was very upset with
me. I</b>
<br><b>don't even know how I knew it was my uncle I just did. Anyhow she
let it go</b>
<br><b>and it happened again the next night and this time my mother asked
me what he</b>
<br><b>was wearing I told her a suit I described it to her and told her
he was</b>
<br><b>wearing a tie but it was really loose he unbuttoned to the top of
the collar</b>
<br><b>she said that was the only suit he had and he was baried in it.
As for the</b>
<br><b>tie she said he always hated ties he would cry as a child to our
mother not</b>
<br><b>to wear them as an adult he rarely did. He said he felt like he
was choking.</b>
<br><b>Anyhow the following night he again came to my room except it was
different</b>
<br><b>this time I was very scared I cant even begin to describe the fear
that I had</b>
<br><b>felt and that same little man was with him again he asked me to
leave I</b>
<br><b>refused and all of sudden I got this awful cramp in my stomach I
knew the</b>
<br><b>little man had done it I ran out of my room to mother and told her
what had</b>
<br><b>happened. That next day she had our priest at the house asking me
questions</b>
<br><b>then he blessed the house. Problem solved. Until I moved and now
I'm in a new</b>
<br><b>house and he's back again.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Crucifix</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mth@toplinetmd.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Just a little ghost story of my own for you. It's pretty tame by
the</b>
<br><b>standards of some of the stuff on your site, but here goes anyway.</b>
<br><b>A good few years ago, during my teenage years, myself and two</b>
<br><b>friends thought it would be fun to have a ghost hunt of our own.
We</b>
<br><b>picked the ruins of an old priory on the outskirts of the Norfolk
(UK)</b>
<br><b>village we lived in and decided to spend the night there. We didn't</b>
<br><b>expect to find anything, we just thought it would be fun.</b>
<br><b>Anyhow, we set up some home-made ghost hunting stuff, including</b>
<br><b>putting flour over the doorways to see if anyone had been there,
and</b>
<br><b>then settled down. Periodically, we would go back to each of the</b>
<br><b>rooms and take a look, to see if anything had changed. At all times,</b>
<br><b>I had my eye on my friends and it was a pretty small, quiet place</b>
<br><b>so if anyone else had been there, I think we might have heard.</b>
<br><b>During one of our trips round, late in the night, we cheked out
the</b>
<br><b>old chapel of the priory, where the altar once was. Everything looked</b>
<br><b>OK, until someone noticed that in a crevass in the wall, above where</b>
<br><b>the altar once stood, a pair of moderatley sized sticks had been</b>
<br><b>wedged in the arrangement of a crucifix! They'd really been wedged
in</b>
<br><b>to a gap, so they were firm, so there's no way that they ended up</b>
<br><b>that way by accident, and I'm also certain they were not there</b>
<br><b>when we entered the priory shortly before Sundown. We panicked and</b>
<br><b>left and I've never been back to that place after dark since.</b>
<br><b>Not long ago, I was back visiting my two old friends, and I thought</b>
<br><b>to ask them whether either of them was playing a trick that</b>
<br><b>night. Both remembered it as clearly as I did and both swore that</b>
<br><b>they were as shocked as I by the strange occurance.</b>
<br><b>It's a good site, whatever line on Ghosts and religion you might</b>
<br><b>take. Keep it up!</b>

<br><b>Dead Man's Cliff</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; cjseamon@home.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Ambridge, Pennsylvania&nbsp; The cliff is a favorite gathering place
for high</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;school kids from the Beaver County area</b>
<br><b>to drink and have a good time.&nbsp; Back in 1994 a group of local
kids made their</b>
<br><b>way to their local drinking spot after a friday night highschool
football</b>
<br><b>game.&nbsp; The night started out just like any other friday night
with the kids</b>
<br><b>rolling in with their party balls, 40 oz. beers and cases of beer.&nbsp;
Around 12</b>
<br><b>AM in the morning it began to drizzle. Most of the kids were already
pretty</b>
<br><b>liquored up, so they decided to go to their buddy's house to continue
the</b>
<br><b>party and get out of the rain. On their way off the cliff Michael
Pellegreni</b>
<br><b>stopped because he forgot his jean jacket.&nbsp; He told his buddies
to meet him</b>
<br><b>back at house because he was going to go back and grab his jacket.&nbsp;
The group</b>
<br><b>of friends continued on their way and just when they were about
to reach the</b>
<br><b>house they heard a bloodcurdling scream. The boys ran back to find
that th!</b>
<br><b>eir buddy Mike had fallen off of the cliff while trying to retrieve
his</b>
<br><b>jacket.&nbsp; The cliff remained off limits for about a year and
a half until</b>
<br><b>local kids began to frequent it once again.&nbsp; On more than one
occassion the</b>
<br><b>kids have run off the cliff horrified at what they had seen. What
they had</b>
<br><b>seen was Mike waking the cliff. It is rumored that the ghost of
Michael</b>
<br><b>Pellegrini still walks the cliff in search of his jean jacket.&nbsp;
They say it</b>
<br><b>is as if he doesn't notice the kids, he just searches "Dead Man's
Cliff" for</b>
<br><b>his jacket.</b>
