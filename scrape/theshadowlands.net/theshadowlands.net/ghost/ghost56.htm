<A NAME="the"></A>The Premonition</H3>
<B>by historygrrl@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>One night when I was 12 years old, i woke to the sound of my mother</B>

<P><B>crying. Worried, I went to see what was wrong. I found her in fornt
of</B>

<P><B>the fireplace with her head in her hands sobbing like her heart was</B>

<P><B>broken. I asked her what was wrong and she jumped like I scared her.</B>

<P><B>Her face was pale white and her eyes looked glazed. She just looked
at</B>

<P><B>me and told me to go back to sleep and not to wake my sisters. She</B>

<P><B>would be fine, she said. Later, when ever I would ask her about that</B>

<P><B>night she would look away from me and refuse to say anything. I didnt</B>

<P><B>find out until I was 20 what happened to her. That summer, my younger</B>

<P><B>sister was killed in a car accident at the age of 18. After her death,</B>

<P><B>my mother told my the story: That night long ago, she was sitting
by</B>

<P><B>the fireplace, she thought she saw one of us standing on the right
side</B>

<P><B>of her. When she looked up she saw my sister, but it wasnt my sister</B>

<P><B>then. It looked as if she had aged into her teenage years. My</B>

<P><B>"sister" told my mother not to cry for her, that she was okay and
happy.</B>

<P><B>She told my mother that she didnt suffer and was going to keep an
eye on</B>

<P><B>all of us from heaven. Then, she disappeared. Thats when my mother</B>

<P><B>started to cry...and that is how I found her, 8 years before my sisters</B>

<P><B>death.</B>

<B>by jannabo@bwave.com</B>

<P><B>Let me start by saying that you have a most interesting site here.
The information provided in</B> <B>your site has shed light on a few strange
events in my life........but those are different stories for</B> <B>different
times. Anyway, let me relate one of my experiences in this next story.</B>

<P><B>At four years old, my family moved from Boston to a small town in
Maryland. While my mother and father both had jobs here, they had not found
a place to move into yet so we stayed with my Great-Grandmother. I stayed
with her during the day, and for a while, since I knew nobody here,</B>
<B>she was my best friend as well as my Grandma. She was 84 years old at
that time, but had the heart of a child. She had never learned to read,
so sometimes when I would read Cat-in-the-Hat</B> <B>or other Dr. Suess
books out loud, she would nod her head and pretend to read along. As you've</B>
<B>probably picked up by now, at that age I loved this woman more than
anything, including my own</B> <B>mother and father. Anyway, this arrangement
of us living with her lasted for about half a year, and</B> <B>then my
parents built a house on the other side of town. While my parents were
at work, I still went and spent the day with her until I started kindergarten
at age six. My Great-Grandma</B> <B>(affectionately Mom-Mom) and I remained
very close even after I didn't spend</B> <B>days with her anymore. I would
sleep over there instead. I could go on and on but let me get to the&nbsp;&nbsp;
part of this story that concerns the only time in my life that I KNOW I
saw a ghost. Other things have happened since but this is my only experience
with a ghost I can be sure of.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B> At age seven, my Great-Grandmother
had a stroke. It wasn't her first, and this one left her unable</B>&nbsp;
<B>to speak or walk. It was a blessing if the woman could even open her
eyes at times. I refused to go to school while she was in the hospital,
and days and nights were spent by her bed. I didn't go home for more than
5 hours at a time for a week. The night before she died, even I as a little
kid</B> <B>knew she was going to die soon, and I was like a madman, screaming
and crying. My Grandma</B> <B>just layed there, eyes closed. When I was
alone in the room, I crept up to her and layed my head</B> <B>on her chest
lightly and begged her not to die. I put my hand on hers and cried, burying
my head</B> <B>in the blankets next to her. Suddenly, my Grandmother squeezed
my hand. Keep in mind that this</B> <B>woman was unable to move at all,
and a hand-squeeze was an affectionate gesture we shared.</B> <B>I stood
up as fast as I could, and I said to her "Can you hear me Mom-Mom?" I told
her how scared I was and how much I loved her, and amazingly she opened
her eyes and forced her mouth into as much of a smile as she could. I told
her to squeeze my hand if she could hear me and if everything was going
to be alright. She squeezed my hand and I ran out of the room to get the&nbsp;&nbsp;
doctor and my mother. When we returned, her eyes were closed and she made
no&nbsp; movements. Still, that night I went home assured that everything
was going to be fine.</B> <B>At 5:07 the next morning, my Great-Grandmother
passed away in her sleep. My mother told me</B> <B>when I woke up, and
I screamed at the ceiling that I hated God and that I wanted to die. This
was extremely traumatic for me and I refused to eat and did nothing but
cry hysterically all day. I was so bad that I made mysef too hoarse to
scream anymore....and this was at seven years old.</B> <B>My mom was considering
taking me to the hospital, but eventually I just became silent and would</B>
<B>not&nbsp;&nbsp; respond to anything. I remained like that, silent and
staring, until that night I really wanted to</B> <B>die. I really did.
I remember this whole thing like it was yesterday. Anyway, I was laying
in my</B> <B>bed, looking out into the hall when I felt a presence-that's
the best way I can describe the feeling I</B> <B>got. I'm sure you all
know the feeling I mean. I looked across the hall into the bathroom, where
there was a soft whitish-yellow light emanating from within the room. I
was scared, but at the</B> <B>same time I wasn't, you know what I mean?
Regardless, I didn't make a sound and I hoped that the light would just
go away. The light grew stronger for a moment and then relaxed.......I
realized</B> <B>it was taking shape. Rapidly, the light became my Great-Grandmother,
wearing her favorite pale</B> <B>yellow Sunday dress, which she was buried
in the next day. I think she knew I was scared, and</B> <B>she smiled from
ear to ear the way she would when we shared a private joke. Then she raised
her</B> <B>arm and waved to me, the way she always did out her front window
watching our car go out her</B> <B>driveway.&nbsp;&nbsp; She then pointed
to the sky, smiled, and waved again. Then she walked across the</B> <B>hall,
through a closet door directly across from the bathroom, and was gone.
I think this was her</B> <B>way of telling me that she was going on to
a better place, Heaven of course, and not to worry.</B> <B>After a few
seconds, I yelled for my dad and told him to check the hall closet. He
opened it and</B> <B>found nothing. I then told him what happened. I don't
think he believed me.......but I bet you guys</B> <B>do.</B>

<P><B>Well, that was my story, and my apologies to anybody who wanted to
read something scary. I have a scary story or two involving a Ouija board
which I'll relate at a later date. Although I've never seen her ghost since,
I have felt her presence at times in my life when I was really depressed
or scared. Mom-Mom Sturgis, I love you, and I'll never forget you, wherever
you are.</B>

<A NAME="trap"></A>Hanging Trees and Trap Doors</H3>
<B>by jfritze@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>This story is not my own, but that of a friend. It happened to her
when</B>

<P><B>she was just a little girl, but she remembers it very clearly. To
make</B>

<P><B>it easier I will tell it as she told me (paraphrased of course):</B>

<P><B>"When I was little my mother was often sick and in the hospital.
A</B>

<P><B>friend of hers, Ethel, let my brothers, sisters, and me stay with
her</B>

<P><B>during those times. I remember she had a very big house with a strange</B>

<P><B>layout. The house was surrounded by a totally enclosed porch and</B>

<P><B>sometime in the 40's a bathroom was installed off the porch. To go
the</B>

<P><B>bathroom you had to go out onto the enclosed porch and walk under
this</B>

<P><B>trap doro in the ceiling. I hated going to bathroom because I knew
I</B>

<P><B>would have to walk under that trap door so I would wait until the</B>

<P><B>morning when someone could walk with me. I also hated sleeping in</B>

<P><B>Ethel's room, but if I was sick she would make me. Whenever I slept
in</B>

<P><B>her room I would pull the blankets over my head and would have a
very,</B>

<P><B>very hard time falling asleep. When I was older I found out that</B>

<P><B>Ethel's aunt had left the house to her. The Aunt had a mentally</B>

<P><B>retarded son who she was very ashamed of and she locked him in the</B>

<P><B>attic. When the aunt died she did so in Ethel's room and her son</B>

<P><B>starved to death in the attic. Maybe because I was so young I could</B>

<P><B>feel that those things had happened or maybe the house was really</B>

<P><B>haunted."</B>

<P><B>My friend also told me about a tree that was outside Ethel's house:</B>

<P><B>"Outside of Ethel's house stood this huge, twisted tree. I remember
I</B>

<P><B>hated driving by that tree. I even hated seeing it from the front</B>

<P><B>porch. My mother once told me that during a visit to Ethel's house
we</B>

<P><B>sat on the front porch. For no reason at all I stood on the front
steps</B>

<P><B>and stared at the tree and after a few minutes I started screaming
and</B>

<P><B>didn't stop until we went in. Ethel told my Mom a few days later
that</B>

<P><B>the tree had been rumored to be the town's old hanging tree."</B>

<P><B>So that's my friends story about Hanging Trees and Trap Doors</B>

<A NAME="hard"></A>Hard Lesson</H3>
<B>by amc28@dana.ucc.nau.edu</B>

<P><B>I've had several experiences, though your guess is as good as mine
as to if they were my imagination. I'm going to say whether I'm gifted
with seeing/sensing spirits, or cursed depending on your outlook, because
I simply don't know. All I know is that there have been some strange, very
frightening things that have happened, and some can be explained rationally,
some can't. Perhaps some can help me rationalize, or maybe tell me that
I'm not crazy in thinking these things truly were the result of spirits.</B>

<P><B>To begin with, I've always been fascinated by ghost stories. My dad
was in the military, and the English village I lived in when I was younger
had several resident ghosts, as did the neighboring villages, but these
are not what I'd like to share.</B>

<P><B>I learned to use the Ouija board very young, while still in England,
and that kind of of made me more popular to the kids when I came back,
because they thought it was cool. But then I learned the dangers. Nothing
as dramatic as some of the other stories, but I believe that early use
in a way invited some of the incidents that came later.</B>

<P><B>As I saw my friends changing, and depending on the board for any
number of answers, even simple questions such as "what should I have for
dinner" I knew that we needed to stop using the thing. The ones that my
sister and I used were drawn on paper, but seemed to work every bit as
well, so we started tearing them up, dunking them in water, burying them.
HOwever, during one use, when I was 13, a friend of ours could not breathe,
the spirit claiming that it would kill him, and as far as I know, five
years later, still often has problems with it.</B>

<P><B>In our apartment, strange things happened. I always felt that I was
being watched, and my room was always the coldest in the apartment, regardless
of the season or the thermostat. My sister and I had bunk beds, and one
morning, my sister was already up. I was still on the top bunk, and suddenly,
the entire frame shook, and there was this fwhump sound (like someone falling
onto the mattress below), scaring me to death. I thought our brother had
done it, he liked trying to scare us, but when I looked there was nothing
there. Often at night our animals (a cat and dog) would stare at areas,
and the only thing that would catch their attention would be to turn them
around manually. Often, the staring would be accompanied by growling or
hissing, or whining.</B>

<P><B>Well, we moved again, to Phoenix AZ, and at first all seemed normal.
For the first 3 months. My brother moved out to go to college, so I moved
from the living room into what is now my bedroom, during semester breaks.
I started thinking I saw things in the closet, from a sterotypical druid
type figure, to an old woman in a yellow dress. My sister often saw the
same thing in her closet, which is on the same wall, next to mine, just
facing into seperate rooms. Whenever I saw these figures, I think my gut
instinct of fear took over, and I layed there, paralyzed by fear, eyes
closed, praying that they wouldn't be there when I looked again, but not
opening my eyes incase they were. My interest in the occult continued,
though I didn't use a Ouija again. My friends did, and that may have led
to more incidences.</B>

<P><B>One night, I was trying out a set of Animal Medicine Cards with my
sister, when this strange sound terrified us. It came from the corner in
which I had set my TV, directly behind where her closet was in her room,
it sounded like something was dragging it's nails against the side of the
TV. Our dog started barking at it, and my sister and I left as quickly
as possible. Later, looking at it the next day, there was nothing I could
think of to explain it, and neither could my sister.</B>

<P><B>I don't exactly remember the timeline for this, but a while later,
my best friend was spending the night at our house, and she often felt
the same menacing. . . watching in the house that I did. She fell asleep
somewhat early, and I woke to her thrashing around, and I just thought
it was her back, as it had been hurting the past couple days. I told her
I was turning on the lights, and she quieted. I turned them on, moved over
to her, and suddenly her eyes snapped open and she jumped about a foot
back and 3 inches off the bed. Later explaining showed that she had been
attacked in her dreams by a dark man, and when she checked, where the thing
in her dream had hit her, she had marks.</B>

<P><B>As if that wasn't enough to tell us to stop delving into the paranormal
things, we kept doing things, putting each other into trances, my friends
using the Ouija, some of them tried using spells and the such.</B>

<P><B>I guess the worst, so far, has been something that happened Halloween
of 1997. I guess it was pure stupidity on my part, but I tried putting
my friend in a trance that night, and she went in fine. We just couldn't
get her out for about 20 minutes. And she kept flailing around if we got
anywhere near her. When she finally came out on her own, she told me the
same man had attacked her as the one in her dream a while before.</B>

<P><B>A few weeks later, something . . . I wouldn't say "attacked" necessarily,
but did get physical. At night, I often have imaginary conversations in
my head, and somehow I had slipped into a conversation with the thing that
had attacked my friend, except I wasn't thinking up both sides of the conversation.
The discussion began to get a little heated, and it's all blurry to me
now, but for a moment I said to him "why don't you come on in and prove
it" before I realized it. As soon as I realized, and knew that it wasn't
an imaginary conversation anymore, I tried to push him out, and suddenly
it felt like something grabbed the back of my neck, pinching hard, and
this searing pain went down my back about once every 30 seconds for about
. . I guess 5 minutes. I wasn't really paying any attention to the time.
All the while, he kept demanding to be let in. Then, suddenly, it stopped
and he left.</B>

<P><B>Another time, I felt something standing behind me, and to prove to
myself there was nothing there, I swept my arm behind me (I was laying
on my side) and hit something solid. I froze, then rolled over, but there
was nothing there that I could possibly have hit.</B>

<P><B>Again, a few weeks later, I thought I saw the dark man by my window,
right after I heard something warn me that he was there. I closed my eyes,
took a deep breath, then suddenly it felt like something was sitting on
me, stopping me from being able to breath. My heart pounded, I tried to
move, but I couldn't. The something just stayed there, until our dog scratched
on my bedroom door, whining, wanting in.</B>

<P><B>I've only had one more experience with the dark man, and that was
when he was in my room, and I was trying to hide under the covers. Again,
something sat on me, until Princess scratched and whined.</B>

<P><B>Two separate times, I've experienced the constricted breathing and
inability to move, and I can only wish that it never happens again, for
it is truly terrifying.</B>

<A NAME="little"></A><B>The Little Boy's Ghost</B></H3>
<B>by ck12306@navix.net</B>

<P><B>I wrote you yesterday about some of my experiences with ghosts, and
the</B>

<P><B>paranormal, but there is more. I have somewhat of an ability to talk
to</B>

<P><B>ghosts. In the story that is to follow, you will understand what
I</B>

<P><B>mean.</B>

<P><B>I have an ability to touch a picture of something, and or someone,
and</B>

<P><B>be able to tell you more about the picture, than what is in the picture,</B>

<P><B>I can do it with pictures, people and places I am familiar with,
and</B>

<P><B>those that I am not familiar with too. I was at a friend's house,
in a</B>

<P><B>nother town, visiting, and a friend of hers stopped by with her two</B>

<P><B>boys. I had never met her friend, or the children before, and knew</B>

<P><B>nothing about them.</B>

<P><B>Well the converstaion got on her son Jerry, well I did not even know
who</B>

<P><B>he was, or that he was her son, until she told me, and she made the</B>

<P><B>comment that since he was dead, wheter he was at peace or not. I
knew</B>

<P><B>nothing about her son, or his death. Well my friend told her, I could</B>

<P><B>tell her, and she asked how, and I told her I would need a picture
of</B>

<P><B>him, and she was not to tell me anything about him, or his death.
She</B>

<P><B>got out a picture, and hid it from me, than we turned out the lights,</B>

<P><B>that way I could concentrate solely on the picture, and the boy,
then I</B>

<P><B>closed my eyes, and had her put the picture on my lap, and than I</B>

<P><B>touched it.</B>

<P><B>Right after I touched it, I got a burning sensation, all over my
body,</B>

<P><B>but worse on my left side, and espescially the left hand, and I could</B>

<P><B>not brathe, it was like I almost was suffocating, it got so bad,
I had</B>

<P><B>to stop for a while, I told the rest what I felt. After a short break,</B>

<P><B>I started again, still not looking at the picture. I saw a little</B>

<P><B>blonde hair boy, with an older man, with an unusual smile, and they
were</B>

<P><B>running, and I was calling after them to wait, and they reached what</B>

<P><B>seemed like a tunnel, but yet was not a tunnel, you could see what</B>

<P><B>looked somewhat like the walls of a cave, but you could not see the
top</B>

<P><B>of the tunnel, it was black. When they reached the opening, they</B>

<P><B>stopped, and I asked where they were going, and the boy kept saying
mama</B>

<P><B>will know, mama, will know, and then they disappeared into the odd</B>

<P><B>looking tunnel.</B>

<P><B>I then sopped and asked the mother if this made any sense to her,
and</B>

<P><B>she said no. Well before she left, she asked if I could touch each
of</B>

<P><B>them, and see if I could see anything about them. When I touched
her,</B>

<P><B>and her oldest son, I saw nothing, but her youngest climbed up in
my</B>

<P><B>lap, and when I touched his hand he jumped out of my lap, and turned</B>

<P><B>around and looked at me, and said what are you doing. The odd part,
is</B>

<P><B>that I started to see something, when he jumped off of my lap, but
lost</B>

<P><B>it in the distraction. This child was the one, that had seen his</B>

<P><B>brother, after the funeral, in his room.</B>

<P><B>Well, after they left, I asked my friend if she knew anything about
the</B>

<P><B>boys death, and she said yes. I asked if she knew how he died, at
this</B>

<P><B>point and time I had not known the exact way he died, but I had a</B>

<P><B>haunch. I asked her if Jerry's left side had come in contact with
what</B>

<P><B>killed him, and if he were electrocuted, and the left hand had contact</B>

<P><B>with whatever it was more than anything else, on his left side, and
she</B>

<P><B>said yes. He had come in contact with an electrical wire, and was</B>

<P><B>electrocuted, and it was his left hand that had come in direct contact</B>

<P><B>with the live wire.</B>

<P><B>I asked her if she knew approximately where he was killed, and she
said</B>

<P><B>she knew what alley it was in, but not the exact location. I asked
her</B>

<P><B>to show me which alley. Well the alley is several blocks long, over
a</B>

<P><B>mile long, and we picked at random, the spot we entered the alley.
Well</B>

<P><B>I was driving down this alley, and I reached a spot, and stopped,
and my</B>

<P><B>friend asked me why I had stopped there, and I told her this is the
spot</B>

<P><B>he was electrocuted, and she asked me how I knew, I told her I could</B>

<P><B>feel is presence and energy there, and the hair on my arms, and back
of</B>

<P><B>my neck were standing on end, and I had goosebumps all over. I drove
a</B>

<P><B>little further, and to our right there was a parking lot, right next
to</B>

<P><B>the alley. I told my friend that I could feel his energy there too,
but</B>

<P><B>not as much as I did, at the previous spot, and that, the parking
lot</B>

<P><B>had something to do with his death. My friend then informed me, that</B>

<P><B>Jerry had been taken to a nearby parking lot, where rescuers worked
on</B>

<P><B>him, to try to save his life. My friend though, however thought that
we</B>

<P><B>had not gone to the right spot, and she wanted me to turn around,
and go</B>

<P><B>back the other way.</B>

<P><B>I told her though, that I knew without a doubt, that those spots
were</B>

<P><B>it, and that I could not turn around, I felt Jerry was drawing me</B>

<P><B>farther down the alley, in the way I was already going. I could not</B>

<P><B>stop, I had to go on. We crossed the connecting street, and started
to</B>

<P><B>enter the alley again, when it dawned on me, what the strange tunnel</B>

<P><B>was. If you looked down an alley, at the entrance, before you entered</B>

<P><B>it, at night, it looked like an odd tunnel. The odd looking sides
were</B>

<P><B>the backsides of buildings, and the black top, was the darkened night</B>

<P><B>sky above, and you cannot see the connecting streets up ahead, at
the</B>

<P><B>entrance, it just looks like a long continuous tunnel.</B>

<P><B>I was not through though, I knew Jerry's spirit was pulling me down
that</B>

<P><B>alley, he was trying to tell me something. My friend kept telling
me to</B>

<P><B>turn around, and go back, and I said I could not, that I felt Jerry
was</B>

<P><B>trying to tell me something. We were about two blocks, from the end
of</B>

<P><B>the alley, when it dawned on me, what he was trying to tell me. I</B>

<P><B>stopped and I asked my friend what was the last connecting street,
at</B>

<P><B>the end of the alley, and she said Vine. I looked at her, and I said,</B>

<P><B>who lives on Vine Street, and she said another friend's name, and
I</B>

<P><B>said, but who else, and she said Valva, and I said bingo. That is
what</B>

<P><B>Jerry meant when he said mama will know, before he entered the tunnel.</B>

<P><B>Valva is his mother, and of course she knew how to get home. I felt</B>

<P><B>like Jerry was telling me, he wanted to go home.</B>

<P><B>Well it was still not over yet. I went home that night, and could
not</B>

<P><B>get this child out of my mind, I felt like he was asking me for my
help,</B>

<P><B>so the next day I went back, this time to Valva's. I told her of
my</B>

<P><B>discoveries the night before, and she confirmed how he died. She
took</B>

<P><B>down another picture of Jerry, and I touched it. This time I saw
a</B>

<P><B>house, with a front porch, and the second floor seemed like it came
out</B>

<P><B>over the porch, and there wer lots of trees around it. I also saw
a</B>

<P><B>funny looking pattern, like a triangle, and a square, put together,
and</B>

<P><B>in the middle of the square sat Jerry playing. The description of
the</B>

<P><B>house did not jog any of their memories, nor the odd pattern.</B>

<P><B>I then touched Jerry's older brother David, and the picture. I saw</B>

<P><B>Jerry in the alley, kind of kicking the dirt, and I saw three bigger</B>

<P><B>boys up on the electrical poles, teasing Jerry, to get him to come
up</B>

<P><B>there with them, and Jerry finally reluctantly went up, but I sensed</B>

<P><B>also that he was upset with David, because he had wanted David to
go</B>

<P><B>with him, and David would not, that David wanted to stay behind,
and</B>

<P><B>play with his friend, and Jerry felt that if David had gone that
he</B>

<P><B>would of kept him from climbing up there. I also knew that the three</B>

<P><B>boys that were with him, were either older than him, or bigger than
he</B>

<P><B>was.</B>

<P><B>I stopped and related what I saw, and felt. David, was stunned, all
he</B>

<P><B>could say was, mom, she is right. It turns out, that him and Jerry
did</B>

<P><B>have an argument that day, because he wanted to stay behind, and
play</B>

<P><B>with his friends, and Jerry had gone reluctantly by himself., and
it</B>

<P><B>turns out that there were three boys with him, and they were older.
The</B>

<P><B>boys, also related later, that Jerry had not wanted to go up there,
and</B>

<P><B>he finally gave into the teasings, and the pressure and did it, and</B>

<P><B>wound up dying for it.</B>

<P><B>I then took them to the alley, and told them not to tell me anything</B>

<P><B>about the alley, and his death, that I would tell them what I saw,
and</B>

<P><B>felt. When I got to the same spot as the night before, once again
the</B>

<P><B>hair stood on end, and I had goose bumps, and I said this is where
it</B>

<P><B>happened wasn't it. I turned and looked at David, he was one of the</B>

<P><B>first ones there that day, his eyes were wide, and he said yes, this
was</B>

<P><B>the exact spot. I then drove to where the parking lot was, and I
said</B>

<P><B>that the parking lot had something to do with it, but I did not know</B>

<P><B>what, that I could feel his energy there, but it was not as strong
as</B>

<P><B>the previous spot. David then informed us, that after Jerry had been</B>

<P><B>electrocuted, the rescuers had taken him there to work on him, to
try</B>

<P><B>and save him. Once again I showed them the tunnel, and where it would</B>

<P><B>end, and that that was what Jerry meant by mama will know.</B>

<P><B>We still had more mystery to solve, the house, and the odd pattern,
and</B>

<P><B>the man I had seen Jerry with. They took me to all the houses, that</B>

<P><B>Jerry would have been familiar with, but none of them matched what
I</B>

<P><B>saw, so I drew a rough sketch of what I had seen. Than they knew
or</B>

<P><B>thought they knew where it was. They directed me to it, but before
we</B>

<P><B>were even in front of it, about a 1/2 block away, I knew that we
had</B>

<P><B>found the right one.</B>

<P><B>When I pulled up in front of it, I saw the very front porch I had
seen,</B>

<P><B>and there was just a small outcropping of a roof over it, and if
you</B>

<P><B>stood directly in front of it, you could not see that small outcropping,</B>

<P><B>it looked like the second floor came out over it, and formed the
roof.</B>

<P><B>It turned out to be her dead father's house, and her brothers still</B>

<P><B>lived there. We got out and started walking to the house, and Valva</B>

<P><B>said we have to go in the side door, because there are no front steps.</B>

<P><B>I told her, I already knew that, because just like the picture, my</B>

<P><B>vision, had no steps, and I told her, that in my picture, there were</B>

<P><B>four pillars, on the porch, and that is exactly how many this front</B>

<P><B>porch had.</B>

<P><B>When we got around to the side of the house, Valva, and her two boys</B>

<P><B>started to go in, but I did not, I headed to the back yard, once
again</B>

<P><B>feeling drawn to it. Valva finally got me to go in. When we got in,</B>

<P><B>Valva introduced me to her brothers. Next to one of her brothers
on the</B>

<P><B>wall sat a picture of a man, the same man I had seen Jerry with.
I</B>

<P><B>asked who is that man, and explained why, it turned out to be their</B>

<P><B>father, who was dead.</B>

<P><B>Valva's brothers were not believers in psychic abilities, and made
it</B>

<P><B>clear. Valva took down the picture and had me touch it. I than</B>

<P><B>proceeded to tell all of them that I saw there father sitting in
a brown</B>

<P><B>leather rocking chair sitting in the Northeast corner of the living</B>

<P><B>room, and there also sat a lamp with an attached table, and that
his</B>

<P><B>spirit was still sitting there. At this time there was no chair or
such</B>

<P><B>lamp sitting there physically. I looked over at one of the brothers,</B>

<P><B>the oldest, and he had tears in his eyes, and told me that his father</B>

<P><B>had such a chair, and lamp in that very corner when he was alive.
I</B>

<P><B>also recognized the living room window as one I had also seen, and
I</B>

<P><B>described a kind of dusty blue-floral print curtain or sheet over
it (at</B>

<P><B>this time there was nothing over it). Than they told me that there
had</B>

<P><B>been at one time a dusty blue floral sheet hanging in that very window.</B>

<P><B>We left the house, but when we got outside, all of the others went
to</B>

<P><B>the car, but not me. I knew there was something still pulling me
to the</B>

<P><B>back of the yard, and I had to know why. I went around to the side
of</B>

<P><B>the back yard, and then it dawned on me, what the pattern was. The</B>

<P><B>square was the fenced in back yard, and the adjoining rectangle was
the</B>

<P><B>house. I shared this with the others, that had by that time joined
me.</B>

<P><B>Also just like I had seen in the middle of the square (the backyard)
sat</B>

<P><B>the pile of dirt, that I had seen Jerry playing in, and I could still</B>

<P><B>feel his energy here. I told them that he was playing with a toy
truck,</B>

<P><B>and Valva asked the boys if they had ever played cars back there,
and</B>

<P><B>David said they had played cars there, but not trucks.</B>

<P><B>I then described the truck I saw him with as a yellow, and red dump</B>

<P><B>truck. Valva, looked at me, and told me that for Jerry's last birthday,</B>

<P><B>hae had gotten a red and yellow dump truck, and that it had disappeared,</B>

<P><B>and noone knew what happened to it.</B>

<P><B>I have not since, had any encounters with Jerry, I feel I accomplished</B>

<P><B>what I needed to accomplish, and that was to let his mom know he
was ok,</B>

<P><B>and happy.</B>

<A NAME="eyes"></A>In a Child's Eyes</H3>
<B>by Coacheswyf@aol.com</B>

<P><B>A week before our second son was born we moved into our first house
in</B>

<P><B>Dunedin, Florida in June of '94. The house was built in the '50's,
and the</B>

<P><B>previous owner had put carpeting over the old wooden floors &amp;
tiled the floors</B>

<P><B>in the kitchen &amp; dining room. The house was perfect for a first
house, we</B>

<P><B>had a small living room &amp; in there was a hallway that led to
the boys'</B>

<P><B>bedrooms. At the other end was the kitchen, the dining room &amp;
our bedroom (to</B>

<P><B>get to our bedroom you had to walk through the dining room). Not
long after we</B>

<P><B>moved in was when everything started happening.</B>

<P><B>My oldest son was only 1-1/2 years old &amp; as you know it doesn't
take much to</B>

<P><B>amuse them. His favorite game was to throw a ball into the kitchen
&amp; we would</B>

<P><B>get it &amp; throw it back. After several minutes we grew tired &amp;
David threw the</B>

<P><B>ball one last time &amp; it rolled into our dining room. For 4-5
days the ball</B>

<P><B>stayed there, call it laziness I guess. One night as my husband (then</B>

<P><B>boyfriend) &amp; I lay in our bed talking the ball started to roll.
We were a</B>

<P><B>little surprised, for a while we could not figure why it rolled by
itself, we</B>

<P><B>later thought maybe it was a draft from a door in the dining room
that led</B>

<P><B>outside, but why hadn't it rolled before that?</B>

<P><B>As it got closer to Christmas things really started to happen, but
only</B>

<P><B>happen when Rob wasn't home. Around 7 in the evening one night while
Rob</B>

<P><B>worked, my oldest son who now was 22 months was eating his favorite
snack</B>

<P><B>..Cheerios. All of a sudden he stopped &amp; stared at an empty wall
I was</B>

<P><B>sitting next to, then he walked over to it. He looked up as if he
was looking</B>

<P><B>up to an adult &amp; started to laugh, then he looked at me &amp;
looked back &amp; said</B>

<P><B>"yeah". He went back to his Cheerios &amp; picked one up ran back
to the wall &amp;</B>

<P><B>held it up as if he was offering it to whatever he was looking at.
The</B>

<P><B>laughing &amp; saying "yeah" lasted around a 1/2 hour or so, I was
really starting</B>

<P><B>to feel uneasy. Everyonce in a while he would bring his cup over
to the wall &amp;</B>

<P><B>hold it up &amp; offer a drink. David continued this almost every
night for about</B>

<P><B>a month &amp; then it stopped.</B>

<P><B>The next year around the same time it started all over again. David
would go</B>

<P><B>to the wall &amp; offer it food &amp; a drink, but this time whatever
he saw was</B>

<P><B>moving around the room. I could tell by looking at his eyes he was
watching</B>

<P><B>something move around the room &amp; he would sometimes get up &amp;
follow it. I</B>

<P><B>would tell my husband about this &amp; he said David had an imaginary
friend. I</B>

<P><B>figured o.k. this could be true until my second son who was now 1-1/2
years</B>

<P><B>would sit with David &amp; together they would follow with their
eyes something</B>

<P><B>moving around the room. My mom told me to call a Psychic medium &amp;
I did, but</B>

<P><B>the night before he was suppose to come he called to cancel &amp;
said he would</B>

<P><B>call me - he never did.</B>

<P><B>David soon started to tell me he was scared because he saw someone
in his</B>

<P><B>room late at night. I started to feel a little better now, because
he could</B>

<P><B>now relate to me what he was seeing. He would tell me it was a tall
man with</B>

<P><B>a beard, I think he called Frank. He would walk around the room &amp;
tell me</B>

<P><B>where "Frank" was, &amp; this me a little uneasy to think there was
a ghost in the</B>

<P><B>house.</B>

<P><B>One night while the boys &amp; I were watching T.V. the iscicle garland
we had</B>

<P><B>hanging on the entertainment center fell. When it fell the boys quickly</B>

<P><B>turned to see what happened, then they both watched something quickly
moved</B>

<P><B>across the room to the Christmas tree &amp; behind me. When whatever
they saw got</B>

<P><B>to the Christmas tree the tree started shaking!</B>

<P><B>One other instance I remember was during the day, the boys were in
their</B>

<P><B>chairs watching a Barney video, while watching it they started moving
around</B>

<P><B>in their chairs as if they were trying to look around someone standing
in</B>

<P><B>front of them. All of a sudden David screams out "MOVE!!!" &amp;
that was the end</B>

<P><B>of their squirming in their chairs.</B>

<P><B>There were times when I would be sitting in my rocking chair &amp;
it would feel</B>

<P><B>like the chair bumped something &amp; I would just ignore it. But
on one day I</B>

<P><B>froze - the boys were in the kitchen &amp; the chair back was toward
the kitchen,</B>

<P><B>I told them to be careful when they came through not to hit the chair
&amp; I</B>

<P><B>continued to rock. All of a sudden the chair was hit hard enough
that it made</B>

<P><B>me stop rocking, I turned aorund to yell at the boys &amp; they were
still in the</B>

<P><B>kitchen playing.</B>

<P><B>During the course of living there we found out that the guy who owned
our</B>

<P><B>house also owned the house next door &amp; one day while he was fixing
that house</B>

<P><B>up he had a heart attack &amp; died. No one found him for days until
they started</B>

<P><B>to notice a smell.</B>

<P><B>So I figure the ghost the boys saw was the former owner of the house,
but why</B>

<P><B>was he haunting our house?</B>

<A NAME="image"></A>The Image</H3>
<B>by trinama@webtv.net</B>

<P><B>I had one clear paranormal experience, which I will NEVER forget.
I can</B>

<P><B>picture it like it happened yesterday.</B>

<P><B>I was 8 years old at the time. My aunt and uncle operated a very
small</B>

<P><B>package store 20 miles out of town. My aunt, Vee, grew up in the
local</B>

<P><B>vicinity and had spent most of her 50+ years here. Her mother, Hilda,</B>

<P><B>lived in a house by herself and was only a few houses away from where
we</B>

<P><B>lived. Her daughter and my aunt, Vee and Vee's husband, Shorty, who
was</B>

<P><B>my dad's brother, lived in a house next to us in-town and again only
2</B>

<P><B>houses from Hilda's. I had been in Hilda's house several times and
knew</B>

<P><B>her as basically as my aunt's mom.</B>

<P><B>Anyway, the day I remember so well went like this. It took about
30</B>

<P><B>minutes to drive from town to this little store, which was only open</B>

<P><B>during the summer months. I remember very clearly as I was walking
up</B>

<P><B>those steps to go into the store with my parents and brothers, I
got a</B>

<P><B>very clear image of Hilda. She was lying on her bed fully clothed
in</B>

<P><B>daytime clothes, appropriate for the time of day, and her long, gray</B>

<P><B>hair being loose. She was laying supine on top of the bedcovers.</B>

<P><B>What was so striking, was that this image came very quickly and clearly.</B>

<P><B>And I "knew" or "was told" she was dead. Except for some pets, I
had</B>

<P><B>never been around death. I didn't even see her as sleeping. It came
to</B>

<P><B>me clearly that she was dead and I questioned it to myself, that
no that</B>

<P><B>cannot be. She can't be dead. The image stayed with me for about
a</B>

<P><B>minute or two.</B>

<P><B>Pretty much exactly 30 minutes later, an elderly gentleman drove
up to</B>

<P><B>the store and told my aunt Vee that her mother was dead. I WAS SHOCKED!</B>

<P><B>The gentleman was one I knew at the time and was a friend to both</B>

<P><B>families. As soon as he made that announcement, the image came back
to</B>

<P><B>me. But I didn't tell anyone about the image then. I was afraid nobody</B>

<P><B>would believe that her image had come to me and that I was making
it up</B>

<P><B>that I say the image. I felt then, as I do now, that I received her</B>

<P><B>image at the point of death or very shortly afterwards.</B>

<P><B>This was my only clear paranormal experience. I feel that since I
did</B>

<P><B>not act on this one, that no more were to come to me. I kept this</B>

<P><B>experience a secret for many years before I finally told someone.
And</B>

<P><B>even then, I got the strong feeling of disbelief.</B>

<B>by playingpucker@worldnet.att.net</B>

<P><B>anyway I have never been more scared in my entire life than this</B>

<P><B>night....here goes.</B>

<P><B>My family was moving into this really weird house and i say it was
weird</B>

<P><B>because it was odd.</B>

<P><B>from the front of the house there were steps that would normaly lead
to</B>

<P><B>where a front door would be but the door was moved and the room that
was</B>

<P><B>once the first room to wich you woould enter the house was turned
into a</B>

<P><B>bedroom and the door sealed off but the steps remained. you could
see in</B>

<P><B>the wall where the door had been walled over.The front door was moved
to</B>

<P><B>the side of the house ,you would walk from the front of the house
to the</B>

<P><B>side where there was an overhang that attached the houseto the garage
so</B>

<P><B>you walked between the two to get to the front door.and then the
back yard</B>

<P><B>wich also contained two other empty lots.and directly behind our
house was</B>

<P><B>a smaller building like a storage or a studio,it had like a drafting
table</B>

<P><B>built into the back wall and the building was just as wide as that
draft</B>

<P><B>table and kinda long. when we first went to the house we looked around
and</B>

<P><B>it was creepy, i never got that kind of feeling from a house and
i was 18</B>

<P><B>at this time. In that long room was all kinds of grafitti and swasticas</B>

<P><B>(sp?) and satanic symbols.</B>

<P><B>We figured some kids had been using the place while it had been empty
as a</B>

<P><B>hang out.</B>

<P><B>I had my own truck so Me and my youngest sister,12 at that time were
going</B>

<P><B>to take one more load over and start putting things away and stay
the night</B>

<P><B>there.</B>

<P><B>we got there and it was almost dark and we unloaded the truck and
started</B>

<P><B>unpacking and putting things in there place and we kept commenting
on how</B>

<P><B>creepy we felt in that house like someone was watching us and we
were very</B>

<P><B>jumpy.</B>

<P><B>we decided To call it a night around 1:00 a.m.</B>

<P><B>so we went to the living room and and pushed our couch together wich
was</B>

<P><B>like a play pen sectional.</B>

<P><B>we turned out the lights and laid there I think we were both (without</B>

<P><B>telling the other to scared to close our eyes). after a short time
we could</B>

<P><B>here noises in the hallway toward the front of the house. We were
very quit</B>

<P><B>and then we Tami my sister asked me if i could hear something in
the</B>

<P><B>hallway and i said yes she asked what it was and i said i didnt know.
I</B>

<P><B>(we) were terrified and just laid there listening and then we heard
a load</B>

<P><B>bang like someone had walked into the wall heater that is in the</B>

<P><B>hallway....O.K. that was it we were freaking out! but still we say
anything</B>

<P><B>and we laid there to scared to move i thought that maybe some kids
were</B>

<P><B>sneaking out of the attic thinking we were gone and that they could
leave.</B>

<P><B>Then it sounded like whispering and dragging noises on the carpet
that got</B>

<P><B>closer and closer like they were just on the other side of the couch!
I</B>

<P><B>swear I thought someone was going to kill us just waiting for us
to move.(I</B>

<P><B>being the chicken) told my Tami to go turn on the light and she said
YOU</B>

<P><B>GO.</B>

<P><B>(we were whispering,barely)</B>

<P><B>we laid there a few more minutes and then we saw these balls of lights</B>

<P><B>coming from the same entrance of the living room to the rest of the
house</B>

<P><B>they would shoot out and fade they were round and bright white.</B>

<P><B>We both saw these and then they stopped and i jumped off the couch
and ran</B>

<P><B>to the light switch and flipped it on. nothing was in the room.we
didnt</B>

<P><B>even think twice we were out of there and went to our house to that
night</B>

<P><B>the next morning we told the rest of the family but they didnt believe
us.</B>

<P><B>I never liked that house and i didnt stay there long I moved out
on my own</B>

<P><B>shortly after but i never liked being alone there. and as far as
i know</B>

<P><B>there were no other events.</B>

<P><B>this really happened and i had no idea what those lights were until
10 trs</B>

<P><B>later just a few months ago i was watching the show 'SIGHTINGS and
they</B>

<P><B>were investigating haunted property and they had video taped these
lights</B>

<P><B>that now i know are called orbs.</B>

<P><B>When I saw that show and the lights my scin was crawling and i had
to pick</B>

<P><B>my chin up off my lap.</B>

<P><B>this is true. and i have a witness.</B>

<P><B>I hope i never have anything else happen again. I like to read about
it i</B>

<P><B>dont like to live it.</B>

<A NAME="best"></A>My Best Friend's Ghost</H3>
<B>by bgard@nemonet.com</B>

<P><B>This story isn't very scary but you might enjoy it anyway. This happened
at my best friends house just about two years ago. I was spending the night
with her at her dad's apartment one night during summer vacation. Her dog,
Zero, had been acting really strange. He had been running up the stairs
that led to her dad's room and coming back down whimpering. A few minutes
later he would go back up there and he would growl at somthing and come
back whimpering again. He did that for about forty five minutes and then
he finally jumped on her bottom bunk and layed there growling for a few
minutes. Finally, Jacey told him shut up and he fell alseep. We just shrugged
it off and started watching t.v. again. at about 10:00 p.m. her dad went
to work and left us two there by ourselves. There was one more thing that
happened that night. We had had Jacey's cd player and were listening to
one of her CDs when her radio just turned off. We didn't notice it because
we were talking and everything but after a few minutes she looked at me
and made this weird face and said, "My radio isn't on anymore." I looked
up at the CD player and sure enough, the power was off and everything.
That happened about two more times that night then we finally went to bed
at 1:00 a.m. In the morning, I woke up before her and noticed that the
radio wasn't on. We had fell asleep with the radio on because we both like
to listen to music when we fall asleep. Anyway, I got up to turn it back
on but the radio wasn't off. The volume was turned all the way down. I
thought about it a little bit and then woke Jacey up. I told her and she
found it kind of strange because no one was there to turn it down because
her dad hadn't come home from work yet and the radio was up too high for
the dog to reach so it couldn't of been him either. Well, we just ignored
that too but it's not like it hadn't crossed our minds that it was a ghost.
I had thought about that but never brought it up. For some reason, it was
just too hard to believe because it had never happened to me before that.
We tried to fall back alseep because it was way too early to get up but
it was imposible. I decided to tell her about the really strange dream
I had had. We were laying on her bottom bunk (Her top bunk was full of
stuff because she was re-arranging her room and just put alot of the stuff
on her top bunk) and I was in the middle of telling her my dream and I
turned my head and looked at her wall just in time to see this orange stuffed
elephant fly off the top bunk, hit the wall across the room, bounce off,
and roll towards the bed. I just stared at it for a second and I wanted
to shrug that off too but it hit me that that couldn't happen all by itself.
Jacey's room is kind of small but somthing had to throw it so it would
hit the wall (close to her ceiling) and bounce off like that. There was
NO way it could've just fallen off. We just layed there for a second considering
what just happened and then Jacey finally said, "did that stuffed animal
just fly across the room?" I said, "Yup, it did." We layed there stunned
for a few more minutes than we got up and checked the top bunk. There was
nothing but stuff up there. We ignored it but it was the topic of our conversations
for the rest of the day. After that, nothing happened for awhile but after
school started up again, things started happening. He radio kept turning
on and off during school. She would turn it off before she left and when
she would come home from school, her dad would complain that she left he
radio on and it woke him up (he slept during the day and worked at night).
He told her that after she would leave he would fall asleep than the radio
would be up on full blast and he would have to go down and turn it off.
another strange thing that happened was, before she would go to school,
she would make her bed and put her favorite stuffed animals (she has ALOT
of stuffed animals but only a few favorites) on her bed a certain way and
she would come home and her stuffed animals would be scattered around her
room and her bed would be messing agian, like somone had slept in it and
didn't bother to make it again. It couldn't have been her dog because she
put him outside during the day. It wasn't her dad because he was sleeping.
Those things kept happening for a few more monthes. One more thing that
happened was about a year after the other things happened. Jacey and I
were playing Mario Cart on Nintindo 64. We had the volume down on the t.v.
because we wanted to listen to the radio (and there were no batteries in
the remote so we couldn't turn up the t.v anyway because it was all the
way down when the batteries ran out). Well, we were in the middle of Donkey
Kong's course when the volume of the t.v. started turning up. We were suprised
by it but just turned it down again and kept playing. After it kept happening,
we decided to find out what was causing it. It couldn't have been somthing
laying on her remote control because it was up on her shelf and there were
no batteries in it. The volume on her t.v. doesn't work either. Well, that's
all. I hope you enjoyed my story. I'll be sure to send it other things
if anything happens. bye bye.</B>

<A NAME="window"></A>The Voice from the Window</H3>
<B>by BLewis4744@aol.com</B>

<P><B>One fall day my mom and dad were planting a</B>

<P><B>tree that they bought and started to plant it outside in the backyard.
They dug the</B>

<P><B>hole and before they put the plant in the ground I spit in the hole
and said "I'm not</B>

<P><B>scared of you devil!" Not thinking about what I had said I went in
the house and</B>

<P><B>started playing with my toys. Well a couple hours later it was time
for me to go bed</B>

<P><B>and I had left the light on. At that time I was sharing a room with
my sister Shenita.</B>

<P><B>That night I could'nt sleep so I just layed in the bed. All of a
sudden I had heard this</B>

<P><B>noise coming from the window saying "HELP ME, HELP ME!" At first
I thought my</B>

<P><B>sister Shenita was doing it just to scare me but she was in her deep
sleep as usual.</B>

<P><B>The words "HELP ME, HELP ME!" were getting louder and louder and
still coming</B>

<P><B>from the window .I started to cry and I ran in my mother's room and
slept with her. I</B>

<P><B>am now 20 years old and to this day I still believe that it's true.
So just because a</B>

<P><B>parent tells you that you were just having a bad dream does'nt mean
you are!!!!</B>

<A NAME="shift"></A>Working the Graveyard Shift</H3>
<B>by TONYWOLFF1@aol.com</B>

<P><B>I worked at a museum in Queens, NY as a security gaurd. My shift
is from 9am to 5pm. The supperviser asked if I would work some nights if
someone took off. I said "yes." The pay was more then days. So the first
night I was 9/2/96. A gaurd couldn't come in. The shift started at 11pm,
it went to 7:30am. It was a night to remember. I worked with another security
gaurd, his name is Mose.&nbsp;&nbsp; We each take turns checking out the
floors ever 45 minutes. Well it took the first round it was 11:45pm. I
went to the third floor to start the rounds the lights were out except
for a couple of night lights. On the third floor ,they have the doll thats
of the girl from theExorcist movie. There are a lot of old t.v. and movie
cameras from the turn of the centary. I walked through the floor and check
the rooms and hallways.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were fine. I then went to the
secord floor to start checking. I first checked the hallway it was o.k.
Then I went in to the office area. The office area is in a"L" shape. I
walked through the office area, as I got to the to the corner of this area,
I heared a moan from a woman. It was low. The hair on my arms stood. I
felth like if someone was there. Right in back of me . I walk through the
office area. I finished my rounds very quickly. At 1:45 I had to do another
round. I started on the third floor again.&nbsp; I walked up the stair
case to the first station. finished there and went to the next station.
That station is right a cross from the freight elevator. There are two
office that right next to the station. The doors of the office were off
because there were painters in there that day painting and moving desk
out of the rooms. As I stood by the station plugging in the eletric eye,
I herd a women whisper. I tried to hear what was said but I got scared
and when to finish the floor quickly as possilby. I got to the next station
plugged in the eye.( You hear two beeps from the eye and that tells you
that your finished there,) As I left the eye about eight to ten feet a
way I herd two more beeps. All the stations on the third floor I herd the
samething the two beeps after I left the station. As I walked through the
floor I felth as if someone was wacthing me,also folling me. I did the
secord floor next and I didn't do the office area .I went down stair to
the lobby , in the cafe area in herd someone walking in back of me I turned
to check. No one was there. I stated to walk back to the cafe to see if
anyone was there, no one was . I ran back to the back desk. At 3:45 I had
to do another round. I went through the floors very quickly. I didn't hear
anything . As I got to the lobby I heard the walking sounds again. I check
again, no one. went back to the back desk, and sat in the chair. The guy
I was working with was sitting there and he asked me if I was o.k. I said
yeh i'm find. I didn't know how he would react to what I herd so I didn't
say anything. At the back desk, we talked about owe kids and things. As
we talked&nbsp; I herd from the hallway, a mans voice, it was very deep.
I got up and walked to the hallway to see, no one there. I am very freaked
out a this time, but didn't say anything to Mose 5:45 it was time for another
round, I went through the floors very quickly, nothing.&nbsp; Got to the
lobby. I herd walking again. I walked through the cafe. The walking got
louder and it sounded like it ran up to me. I swung around and put my hand
up if I was in a fight. No one there, I got out of there. It stayed with
me ( the foot steps) to I got back to the back desk.&nbsp;&nbsp; 6:45 Mose
did his round. I sat at the back desk. I herd the mans voice in the hall.
I herd foot steps and chairs being moved. I turned the camera to look at
the cafe and nothing. I still herd the sounds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mose came back
to the back desk after his round. He sat down and then the man voice from
the hall started again, I asked if he herd that. He looked at me and said
"yes I did" I then told him about all the things I herd through that night.
He told me that he herd things that night and in the past. He also told
me that there is another guard that will not do any rounds at night because
of things she herd.&nbsp; The noise continued in the hall as we talked
about this. The other guards don't talk to much about it, because their
have to work at these hours,also their afraid of lossing there jobs. Because
if anyone would find out in the office their wouldn't unstand and fire
them.&nbsp;&nbsp; The noise stopped, and owe shift was over. We went home
I did work again the graveyard shift ( I need the money) and I have more
to tell.</B>

<A NAME="bedroom"></A>The Sunken Bedroom</H3>
<B>by tarianna@theshadowlands.net</B>

<P><B>I have sent one other story about this house in before. The incidents
took</B>

<P><B>place over a period of several years. We would hear footsteps, see
shadows</B>

<P><B>out of the corner of our eyes, things would disappear ie:keys, jewelry,
money</B>

<P><B>ect. only to turn up a few hours or days later or sometimes never
again.</B>

<P><B>After the first few times we just chalked it up to our resident ghost.
In the</B>

<P><B>meantime I had moved into the sunken bedroom, and my parents moved
downstairs.</B>

<P><B>My Grandfather(dads side) had also passed away on my 12th birthday
Oct.30</B>

<P><B>1976. Yes I was born 2 minutes before Halloween which I think helped
increase</B>

<P><B>my interest in the supernatural. My Grandpa and I had never been
really</B>

<P><B>close; he liked to tease me and make me cry. I remember once in his
hospital</B>

<P><B>room, he had had a series of strokes and could barely move, he whispered
my</B>

<P><B>name and when I walked over to the bed and leaned over him, he pretended
to</B>

<P><B>die. I started sobbing and he opened his eyes and started laughing,
he was</B>

<P><B>always doing stuff like that my whole life and his number one target
was</B>

<P><B>always me. Whether or not this has any bearing on this story' I will
let you</B>

<P><B>decide.</B>

<P><B>About 2 years before his death I started hearing something or someone
trying</B>

<P><B>to get up the stairs. It sounded like stepping up three steps and
falling</B>

<P><B>down two. I always heard this in October. My mother and I joked about
the</B>

<P><B>ghost trying to get up the stairs. I always kept my bedroom door
open since I</B>

<P><B>was the only one upstairs with a furnace vent and we wanted to heat
the other</B>

<P><B>rooms too. It was always so warm in my room I would have to crack
a window in</B>

<P><B>the dead of winter just to be comfortable. And like I said in my
other story,</B>

<P><B>I also didn't have outlets in my room just dropcords. I had a swag
lamp</B>

<P><B>hanging over my couch bed that sometimes would work and other times
it</B>

<P><B>wouldn't, you just had to keep pulling the chain until it came on.</B>

<P><B>Well as I said something or someone was trying to get up the stairs.
For</B>

<P><B>about 4 years (2 before and 2 after my grandpas death). Finally one
night it</B>

<P><B>made it all the way up. October 18 1979. I remember the date clearly
because</B>

<P><B>it was the day after my parents wedding anniversary and my dad had
gotten my</B>

<P><B>mother a dozen red roses. Anyway I had been laying in bed listening
to the</B>

<P><B>footsteps on the stairs. I had been listening to them for about a
half an</B>

<P><B>hour up 3 ,fall down 2 when they stopped. I thought finally I could
get some</B>

<P><B>sleep. I rolled over to face the doorway and there it was. There
was really</B>

<P><B>no form or body about it just a shimmering bright light. It was about
3 feet</B>

<P><B>wide and 5 to 6 feet tall. It was white and yellow with some other
colors</B>

<P><B>mixed in. It came into the bedroom and I remember trying desperately</B>

<P><B>to get the swag light on. My room was probably about 12 feet long.
I could see</B>

<P><B>it walking toward me and hear it too. Although my room was carpeted
it sounded</B>

<P><B>like it was walking on bare wood floors. Even with my other experiences
I was</B>

<P><B>scared to death. I felt total hostility directed towards me. When
it got</B>

<P><B>about half way across the room my light finally came on. Of course
I couldn't</B>

<P><B>see it in the light, but I heard it move toward the window. My grandpa
(mom's</B>

<P><B>side) had told me of his many experiences and told me if I ever got
into a</B>

<P><B>scary situation to say" Old Tom Parker under your hat, bound in the
name of</B>

<P><B>God The Father, God The Son, and The Holy Spirit. ( I know now, Thanks
to The</B>

<P><B>Shadowlord, that this is a binding.) I said this as it moved toward
the</B>

<P><B>window. It groaned an unearthy groan and then it wasn't there.I laid
there for</B>

<P><B>a few moments trying to catch my breath, lower my heartrate and collect
my</B>

<P><B>thoughts about what I had just seen. I decided to tell my parents.
I got out</B>

<P><B>of bed, I was wearing my future husbands football jersey, it was
purple and</B>

<P><B>came to the middle of my thighs (revelant to the story) Anyways I
got</B>

<P><B>downstairs and turned on the hallway light which cast light into
my parents</B>

<P><B>room. I walked to my mothers side of the bed making sure the light
was not</B>

<P><B>behind me,I didn't want to scare them.I quietly called to my mom
and she said</B>

<P><B>what is it? I told her our ghost had finally made it up the stairs.
She sat</B>

<P><B>up opened her eyes and the next thing I knew I was lying across their
bed and</B>

<P><B>my dad had his fist raised above my head and my mom was screaming.
He didn't</B>

<P><B>hit me but later they both told me that what they saw was not their
daughter</B>

<P><B>but an old jagged tooth women about 4 feet high. Hair as white as
snow and</B>

<P><B>down to her hips, all ratty and snarled. With a long white dress
or nightgown</B>

<P><B>on. My appearence changed as soon as they threw me on the bed.. I
sat up and</B>

<P><B>explained what happened in my room . My dad had it in his head that
it was</B>

<P><B>his dad (my grandpa). We went out in the living room while he went
upstairs</B>

<P><B>to talk to it. That is when my mom and I noticed that the roses that
she had</B>

<P><B>received the day before and had barely started to open, were black
and</B>

<P><B>decaying. Meanwhile my dad got upstairs to my doorway when the door
slammed in</B>

<P><B>his face. He pushed it open without any resistance and went into
my room.</B>

<P><B>When I left my room my light was on and it was very warm in there,
When my dad</B>

<P><B>went in the light was off and it was so cold he could see his breath.
Remember</B>

<P><B>my room was the only one with a furnace vent and the furnace was
kicked on.</B>

<P><B>My Dad felt alot of anger directed toward him when he entered. He
swore at</B>

<P><B>whatever was in the room and told it to leave us alone, it had caused
enough</B>

<P><B>trouble. When he came back down he said he wasn't sure if it was
his dad or</B>

<P><B>not but whatever it was it was still in the room. So we packed up
the other</B>

<P><B>two kids, our dog and left the house to go stay with my grandpa and
grandma</B>

<P><B>(mom's side). We were gone a week, until a high ranking church official</B>

<P><B>and family member on my mothers side was able to get to the house
and exorcize</B>

<P><B>and bless it. I won't mention the denomination out of respect for
this</B>

<P><B>church. He wouldn't let us in the house while he did his work because
he said</B>

<P><B>the spirit may have possessed me once that night and he didn't want
it to</B>

<P><B>happen again. When he came out of the house he said he didn't have
the power</B>

<P><B>to banish it but that it was now very weak. He also looked at me
and said it</B>

<P><B>wasn't over for me, that spirits would be drawn to me for the rest
of my</B>

<P><B>life.</B>

<P><B>Little things like footsteps shadows and missing items would continue
to</B>

<P><B>happen while I lived there. When I moved out my parents decided to
put a deck</B>

<P><B>on the house. They found a corner of what looked like a tombstone
buried in</B>

<P><B>the yard.</B>

<P><B>The house was torn down about 3 years ago and the rubble burnt. There
has been</B>

<P><B>a 4 sale sign on the property for 3 years now, but most of the town
has heard</B>

<P><B>rumors about the house and I don't think it will be sold too soon</B>

<P><B>I know all this sounds hard to believe but it really did happen to
me and my</B>

<P><B>life was changed forever by it.</B>

<P><B>I welcome any questions about my experience.</B>

<A NAME="street"></A>College Street Haunting</H3>
<B>by Ethermind@aol.com</B>

<P><B>I want to tell you about a haunting that I experienced when I was
13 years old. I lived in western Tennessee in a small town named Martin.
My father and mother had just divorced and my mother, my brother, and myself
moved into this old house near the main railroad tracks that went through
the town. The house is located at 200 North College Street in Martin, TN.
It is still there to this day and it is occupied by something that is not
of this world. We experienced many strange happenings there while we lived
there, but there is one that really stands out in my mind.&nbsp; It was
real late on night and it was summer time. It was right after the fourth
of July. I remember that because the annual Fourth of July carnival had
just left town. I was sitting up in my bed reading a comic book. I was
reading an X-men comic. Those were my favorites. It must have been near
midnight because my mother had already gone to bed and she usually would
stay awake until 11 or 11:30. The house had been built in the late 1800's.
It was an old house. Every window in the place was etched in with cement.
Modern houses are not built that way. The house was two stories, but the
top floor had been burned very badly in a fire. The top floor had never
been restored so the only living place was the bottom floor and there was
a very large basement as well. Periodically strange things would happen
in the house and we were not the only ones that experienced them. Electrical
appliances would work by themselves, noises could be heard upstairs, doors
would lock or unlock themselves, and other more bizarre events had taken
place. Neighbors had warned my mother that something evil resided there
and the house had a bleak history. I was very young at the time so my mother
protected me from being terrified and she never told me some of the local
fables. On this particular summer's night I was reading my comic book and
I decided it was time to retire. I put the book on my nightstand and turned
off the light. I lay awake listening to the sounds of the night outside
and that would usually put me to sleep. I had been lying there for maybe
five minutes when I heard something down the hallway. I thought that it
was my mother up shuffling about in the night. Maybe she had to go to the
restroom or she was going to the kitchen for a midnight snack. I heard
footsteps walking down the hallway that lead to my bedroom. Outside the
entrance to my bedroom was also the door that lead down into the basement.
Still, I thought that this was my mother. The footsteps grew closer and
I decided to pretend that I was asleep. I did not want my mom knowing that
I was still awake. I squinted, keeping my eyes barely open. It appeared
that they were closed when actually I had limited vision. The foot of my
bed faced the doorway that lead into the hall. The footsteps were very
close now and I could faintly make out the figure of a woman walking toward
my bedroom. She had a silken nightgown on and her hair was long, dark,
and flowing. My mother's hair was quite blonde. Had my mother had company
over for the night? My mind was trying hard to rationalize what my eyes
were seeing. The room got very cold. She stood at the foot of my bed for
what seemed like and eternity. She just stood there and stared at me. It
was too dark for me to make out her facial features but I could feel her
stare. Then, she turned around and walked back down the hallway. She went
into the restroom outside of my mother's bedroom, turned on the light,
and shut the door. She was in there for about thirty seconds or so. Then,
she went into my mother's bedroom. I lay awake for at least another hour
or so. I could not figure it out.The next morning at breakfast I asked
my mother if she had any company stay over the night before. She looked
puzzled. She told me that she certainly had not and wanted to know why
I would ask. I told her that I must have just had some strange dream. I
knew that it was no dream. Time passed and I slowly forgot about that incident.
Many years later I was staying up late with my mother and a few friends
having drinks and conversation. I was home on leave from my duty in the
U.S. Marine Corps. My mother begins to tell us of the house on College
Street that was occupied by evil spirits. She had never told me about the
things that she had experienced there. She told us quite a few chilling
things about the place that I had never heard before. I was shocked. She
asked me if I had ever experienced anything strange there. After a few
moments of deep thought I recalled that strange woman that walked into
my room. Immediately my mother asked, " Did she have long dark hair and
a night gown on? "The hairs stood up on the nape of my neck. I asked her
how she knew. She told me that she had seen her too. So had and a few other
people that had been there. The house is still there to this day. My grandmother
owns it. She rents it out to college students. I cannot help but wonder
what other people have experienced there. There is one thing that is important
that I need to mention. Whatever is in that house is not good. One cannot
help but get this oippresive felling while in the house. Everyone that
I am aware of that has lived there has had real bad luck. My brother almost
died in that house from Pneumatic Bronchitus. The spirit (or spirits) that
occpies that place is (are) nasty. So, if you plan to go and visit that
place please be careful. Whatever is there has put bruises and scars on
my mother. My brother was deathly ill and as soon was we moved from that
place he miraculously recovered instantly. There are other things that
happened that are too numerous to mention. There are good spirits and there
are bad ones. That house has something dark and sinister in it. I swear
it.</B>

<A NAME="living"></A>Living Dead</H3>
<B>by lenachan@worldnet.att.net</B>

<P><B>I call my story the living dead because when</B>

<P><B>someone is still living but is on the verge of dying it attracts
spiritual</B>

<P><B>phenomenon. My brother, stephen, had cancer and had been fighting
it for a</B>

<P><B>while but was losing to the disease. My parents kept him home when
he was</B>

<P><B>very ill and kept him downstairs so they could easily take him back
and forth to</B>

<P><B>the hospital. At that time he started talking into thin air like
he was</B>

<P><B>actually seeing someone, he told them to go away because he wasn't
ready to go</B>

<P><B>with them. My parents thought it was the medication causing him to
hallucinate,</B>

<P><B>but at the same time we all noticed different things happening in
the house,</B>

<P><B>such as doors opening and closing all be themselves. I was 7 or 8
years</B>

<P><B>old at the time and I remember the door that led from the kitchen
to the dining</B>

<P><B>area shut before my face, and the doornob was moving back and forth
very</B>

<P><B>rapidly. I tried to grab it and stop it, but it was so strong my
wrists</B>

<P><B>just moved back and forth. I even tried to run around from the dining
room</B>

<P><B>through the living room to go to the kitchen from an other area to
find the door</B>

<P><B>stayed shut and the doornob was still moving so I knew for sure there
was nobody</B>

<P><B>really there. My mom said her door kept opening up after she would
close</B>

<P><B>it so finally getting fed up, she yelled make up your mind, either
come in</B>

<P><B>or stay out! and at that moment the door slammed shut by itself.
At</B>

<P><B>other times when my parents had taken my brother to the hospital
and I would be</B>

<P><B>at home alone waiting for them I would always hear someone calling
my name from</B>

<P><B>within the house of course I would be scared and would wait by the
front door</B>

<P><B>until they would come back. My brother continued talking to something
and</B>

<P><B>would always ask us if we could see them but we never saw anything.
He</B>

<P><B>finally passed away in 1972 but the noises continue to this day.
They</B>

<P><B>don't occur as frequently as they did back then but every now and
then my other</B>

<P><B>family members and friends will hear footsteps running down the stairs,
their</B>

<P><B>name being called and doors opening and closing by themselves, and
other</B>

<P><B>experiences that I will submit at a later date.</B>

<P><B>I have experienced something unusual at my aunts house. I stayed
with my aunt one summer and I slept in her living room. At night I could
see down her hallway and I could see a shadow of a person going down the
hall and there would be no one there. Recently, my aunt told me that after
watching television late her family was getting up to go to bed and her
husband seen a man go into their daughter's room so he ran down to see
who it was when he got to the room the man he saw vanished. She said that
they where scarred but that they have gotten used to it.</B>

<A NAME="leo"></A>Ghost in Leominster</H3>
<B>by Xoofuu@email.msn.com</B>

<P><B>My story happened about when i was in sixth grade so i was like 13
years</B>

<P><B>old. I moved back with my mother who moved into a apartment on the
first</B>

<P><B>floor. The house is very old and neighbors told me that along time
ago maybe</B>

<P><B>in the early 1900's the house was a bed and breakfast type thing.
I noticed</B>

<P><B>things that showed it was very old in the basement. I found a huge
old sink</B>

<P><B>and a huge coal burner in the basement. and staircase that just ends
halfway</B>

<P><B>up to the first floor.</B>

<P><B>Well the real story took place in my room which was fairly small
about</B>

<P><B>10x10ft square'ish room. and there was this weird big mirror on one
wall</B>

<P><B>that was like glued to the wall. Well one night i went to bed about
9ish and</B>

<P><B>i had school the next day.</B>

<P><B>During the night sometime i woke up sweating but very cold. I swear
i heard</B>

<P><B>voices coming from the opposite side of the mirror wall in the upper
corner</B>

<P><B>of the room. The voices were both men and women. They were loud then
went to</B>

<P><B>a whisper and they were calling me and then asking me what i want.
I was</B>

<P><B>freaking out then and pulled the covers over my face and was telling
myself</B>

<P><B>its just a dream. Then all of a sudden the voices stopped and a mans
voice</B>

<P><B>seemed right on top of me and yelled "What do you want !" I screamed
and ran</B>

<P><B>out of the room and went into the bathroom and puked. woke my mother
and</B>

<P><B>could not sleep the rest of the night. I went with her into the room
after</B>

<P><B>she forced me to and the voices were not there but i would not sleep
in</B>

<P><B>there again. I moved into another room and made her take that room.
For the</B>

<P><B>next couple weeks i was sick and stayed home from school many days.
I never</B>

<P><B>heard the voices again ever, but other times I would have weird experiences.</B>

<P><B>My mother built a wall so we could extend the porch into the house
as a</B>

<P><B>room. They way it was designed was you had to walk around this wall
and go</B>

<P><B>threw a doorway and then you could either go upstairs to the second
floor</B>

<P><B>apartment or take a left and there was another doorway to our apartment.</B>

<P><B>Well one night alone with my cat i was up late watching tv out in
that room</B>

<P><B>which i moved into, I remember falling asleep with the tv on and
all of a</B>

<P><B>sudden the tv went off and my cat jumped off the bed and i thought
ran out</B>

<P><B>of the room, but the tv flicked back on and i could see the cat in
the</B>

<P><B>corner next to the main doorway to outside purring and acting like
it was</B>

<P><B>rubbing on to someone's leg as cats do alot of. I was so tired it
didnt even</B>

<P><B>faze me at all. I just fell asleep. I never really told my mother
about the</B>

<P><B>tv but i told my bestfriend Jesse about it.</B>

<P><B>When i got older me and jesse were getting into the ouija board thing
and</B>

<P><B>into all kinds of witchcraft stuff. We even made our own ouija boards
out of</B>

<P><B>wood and would play with them. But i never knew how to use one right.
One</B>

<P><B>night after we finished my board we were in the basement at the time
with</B>

<P><B>the tools.I remember talking to him about learning how to use the
boards and</B>

<P><B>right then the lights went out in the basement and i heard the wood
rattling</B>

<P><B>against metal. It was loud and scary. We both yelled at my sister
to come to</B>

<P><B>the stairs and help us but she didnt hear us. The lights came on
quickly and</B>

<P><B>we ran upstairs. I thought that my sister was playing a joke on us
but she</B>

<P><B>was sleeping in the living room watching tv. We both asked if we
saw the</B>

<P><B>same thing and we did. That still scares me to this day. Well i moved
out</B>

<P><B>of that house to live with my dad in florida and my mother stayed
there for</B>

<P><B>one year and finished the designing of the front room. I never thought
about</B>

<P><B>any of this until i read some of these stories. To me i do not believe
any</B>

<P><B>of this until it happens to me. But in my case i think i just dont
want to</B>

<P><B>believe it.</B>

<B>by KristanC@sandycorp.com</B>

<P><B>I haven't had any experiences with ghosts myself, but my mother has
told</B>

<P><B>me true stories about her and her family, that gave me nightmares.
She</B>

<P><B>used to live in Detroit on a street named Savahana. She would tell
me</B>

<P><B>about all the weird things that would happen there. Her father was</B>

<P><B>dieing of lung cancer, and my moms brother kenny used to sleep in
his</B>

<P><B>room. Every morning at 5:00, he could here a woman screaming. Other</B>

<P><B>siblings also heard the scream. My mother slept in the attic with
her</B>

<P><B>sister. One half of the attic was turned into a bedroom, the other
half</B>

<P><B>storage for Christmas stuff etc. On one occasion, my mother and her</B>

<P><B>sister had thier cousin over. My aunt was looking in a mirror that
was</B>

<P><B>leaning on the table and against the wall. When my mom called her,
she</B>

<P><B>looked around the mirror, and the mirror flew off the table. The
way it</B>

<P><B>was siiting, it could have only slid off. Another occasion was when
my</B>

<P><B>mom was 13, she was up in the attic sitting on her bed. (The bed
was</B>

<P><B>directly in front of the door that lead to the storage space.) She
was</B>

<P><B>up there smoking, when she saw 3 orange tappered fingers appaer around</B>

<P><B>the door. Note the door had a lock on it. Then the ghost face appeared</B>

<P><B>and there were black holes were the eyes and nose should be. No mouth.</B>

<P><B>My mother ran down the stairs so fast, she doesn't remember touching
a</B>

<P><B>one. When they finally moved out of the house, years later, she</B>

<P><B>discovered that the house had been burnt down. When she asked neighbors</B>

<P><B>how, they did not know, but the fire had started in the storage part
of</B>

<P><B>the attic where the ghost was seen.</B>
