<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Haunting of
Tilly Bend
Settlement<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By: anonymous<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">About forty years
back I
became interested in tracing my family's ancestors.This is how I
discovered the
Tilly Bend settlement.Situated in the Appalachian Mountains it really
is a
beautiful place.The Toccoa River flows down from the high mountains
winding
it's way into Blue Ridge Lake.Tilly Bend Settlement is nestled back in
these
same mountains.One must cross the Toccoa River and travel down a one
lane dirt
road that takes you deep into the forest.As you drive along one begins
to
notice(windows rolled down) how quit the deep woods becomes.This was my
first
impression of this area 40 years ago.This place has been lost in time
because
it looks the same now as then with the exception of the renovation of
Tilly
Bend Church.I have been here many times,many,many times over the last
40
years.I suppose you could say I'm drawn to the mystery of this place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I will only share a
small
portion of my research,however you need to understand this Tilly Bend
church
sits right in the middle of this haunting.This church is not part of
the
haunting.This church is the house of God and services are held there on
a
regular basis and demands the respect as being the house of God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In 1756 the Creek
Indians
lived in this area and got along quiet well with the white folks that
came to
this area from North Carolina.There are census records showing that the
white
men intermarried with the creek women.The Cherokee did not get along
with the
creeks and forced them out of the area.The intermarried creeks did not
leave
and neither did their customs.In 1820 the Stanley's had formed a
settlement
over the mountain in a place known then as Stanley Gap.This being
told,I can
now share with you what I know as fact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Searching for my
great,great
grandmother's grave I ended up in Tilly Bend Cemetery.At this time the
church
only had services on decoration once a year.The church building was
very old
but still in fair condition for it's age.There were no glass windows
only
wooden shutters and that was common in the days before air
conditioning.The
doors to the church is what I remember most about this old country
church.There
was in both of the old doors what appeared to be like someone had shot
the
doors with a riffle of some sort.My first impression was that someone
had done
this out of pure meanness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I then proceeded to
walk
around the side of the church and walked up and peered through one of
the
cracks between the shutters.Of course with the shutters closed and
there being
no windows the inside was dark.I could however make out the old home
made
church pews and the pulpit.I also noticed the high ceiling with the
rafters
showing.Yes,I thought this church is old and the welcome sign out in
front of
the church stated the church was established 1858.After I looked the
old church
over I then headed up the hill to the cemetery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I noticed there
were a lot of
field stones marking the graves which is not unusual for very old grave
yards.Right in the center is a very old and large Oak Tree.The only
tree that
is in this grave yard.I started looking around at the grave markers for
my
great,great grandmother's grave.Well to my surprise her grave was also
in the
center of the grave yard and her grave was the only one under the oak
tree.The
name on her marker is Elizabeth.So I'm looking at this grave yard
thinking it
looked as if no one wanted to be buried anywhere near her grave.I then
wrote
the information from her marker down and that is when I noticed the
head of her
grave was facing west.Which is very of odd because all the people here
bury the
dead facing to the east because the Lord will return in the eastern
sky.I
finished getting the information and I caught a glimpse of someone out
of the
corner of my eye.I did not hear a car come down the dirt road and there
were(are) no houses close by.I turned very quick to see who it was and
there
was on one.I laughed at myself thinking"Yeah I am jumping at my own
shadow.You see I didn't believe in ghost but I did believe in mean
people.As I
started back down the hill I noticed another grave Mary.The birth date
was the
same as Elizabeth.They both died on Oct.26 Elizabeth died 1905,Mary
died 1906.I
thought "boy somebody messed up on the dates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I reached my car at
the foot
of the hill and as I got in I looked back up towards the cemetery and
at the
tree I saw what appeared to be a woman.Her dress was long and black.She
had on
a hat that I can only describe as a granny bonnet.I thought "you have
got
to be kidding".Then it looked as if she stepped back behind the tree.I
was
curious so I went about half way back up the hill and shouted
"Hello"of course no answer so I walked all the way back to the tree
and there was no one there.I hurried back to the car and left.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A couple of weeks
later my
grandfather ask me if I had went to his great mother's grave.I told him
I had
and ask why her grave was facing to the west.My grandfather said well
she was a
witch.I laughed and said"really grandpa why is her grave turned
around?He went
on to tell me this,She was Creek and also a witch doctor for the Creek
Indians.The whole settlement was afraid of her.Now she had a daughter
to marry
a Tilly and another daughter to marry a Stanley.There had been a family
feud
between the Tilly's and the Stanley's.So the two sister's became
enemies
because of their husband.The feud escalated and on Sunday morning the
Stanley's
went to Tilly church and started shooting through the doors of the
church.Killing the preacher(he was a Tilly) and several others in the
church,including the one sister who married a Tilly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Now the Tilly's did
not let
this go and one night they went to Stanley gap and killed some of the
men while
they were asleep.Now the sister that married a Stanley,her husband was
killed
that night.A few months later she died having a baby.Elizabeth Bradley
vowed
revenge on both the Tilly's and Stanley's for the deaths of her two
daughters...After that every baby born to the Tilly's and Stanley's
died at
birth.I said "come to think of it, there was a lot of little baby
graves.Rows of them"my grandpa said"Well after a year of this the
Tilly's went to Elizabeth Bradley's house and got her.She was then
taken to the
center of Tilly grave yard and hung from the old tree.They cut her down
and
buried her right where she fell.Right before they hung her she told
them she
would come back<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Now after a few
months the
little babies started dying,all at birth.People in the Tilly settlement
started
claiming the witch had come back and had taken up residence in a very
old and
mean woman. Elizabeth Bradley's sister in law Mary.So on the
anniversary of
Elizabeth Bradley's hanging,the men went and got Mary Tilly
Bradley.They hung
her from the same tree.They would not bury her facing west because she
was
after all not at fault because the witch came back through her and she
was a
Tilly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I said "grandpa
that
didn't really happen.He said'you saw the graves and I'm telling you it
did
happen and the older folks here will tell you that it's true.He
said"and
I'll tell you you something else that's true I saw one of them witches
one time
when I was a small boy.My grandpa went on to say that when he was about
9 year
old he went to decoration at Tilly and he described the very same woman
that I
had seen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This happened 40
years ago
and my grandpa has been gone for many years now.I have seen a tin
type(old
picture)of Elizabeth Bradley and I have also seen Elizabeth Bradley at
Tilly
Bend.I have kept a record and I have seen her 8 times the last 40
years.There
has been two occasions that I have heard a little baby crying as I walk
up the
hill.Of course it quits when I get to the tree.Strange how one would
think you
only see ghost at night.I have only seen her in the daytime.Coure I
don't go
there at night and I never will!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I've always
believed in
paranormal things! I've had many encounters with ghosts and it's never
really
bothered me. My daughter was born in 2006, around the time she was 1
1/2 we
moved in to a nice older house. The first night in our new house we
were
camping out downstairs because our beds hadnt been unloaded from the
truck yet
around 2 am i was woke up because you could hear the sounds of someone
walking
around in her room above the kitchen. I just blew it off as an older
building
and such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked upstairs when it
continued to find her closet doors open and things scattered around her
room
like someone had been in the boxes, again i just blew it off as my kid
brother
playing a trick before he left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next
morning we were setting up her room and I noticed her sitting there
acting like
she was playing with someone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sort of
gave me chills because she was actually talking to someone.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I just ignored it, but later she started
mentioning the man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Three days into
living there
is when things started happening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
room has never been warm, i can turn the heater up to 75 degrees, I
have bought
a space heater, the landlords have came and checked the windows and
insulation,
everythings normal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her closet doors
open at random times by themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now
at almost 3 she still talks about the man in her room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She's informed me that the man tells her she
can do things, be bad and do things after shes told no. She still sits
around
and talks to noone. We lived 14 months with just little things
happening all
around 2 am, her bedroom door slams shut and you hear stomping down the
stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The laundry room doors open and
slam shut, the water in the bathtub turns on by itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But lately things have become more aggressive
and frequent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I decided to decorate her
room, I put new curtains up, her new blankets on her bed and hung
clothes in
the closet. I walked downstairs leaving all the lights on but shutting<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">the closet doors, i
was down
stairs maybe 5 minutes. As i entered the hallway i noticed her door
closed,
nothing new, but i opened it and there was this rush of cold air, again
nothing
new, the light was off and you could feel someone in the room.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It was an angry sort of feeling, like someone
was glaring at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ignored it and
turned the light on, the curtains id just hung had been ripped off the
rod and
lay in the middle of her room, her new blankets and sheets were off her
bed and
her closet doors again wide open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
daughter refuses to sleep in her room now saying the man scares
her,That he
yells at her. I've placed crosses and went as far as to have my house
blessed
and nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the last 2 months I've
been woken up to someone screaming in my ear, the sound of my front
door
opening and slamming shut and my bathroom shower turning on, all in the
2 am
hour and on nights my daughters at grandmas house.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">One evening just
before dark
my wife was walking the dogs on the west side of the air field when she
saw a
dark figure at a distance since it was getting close to dark and she
was kind
of spooked she crossed the trail and started to run to the truck the
opposite
direction some how the figure reappeared in between her and the truck.
she knew
this was not possible because there was only A thin strip of woods
between her
and the road but some how it got in front of her again, now as she got
closer
the figure appeared to have no head<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it
was weird looking not clear in the fading light . now she was in total
panic
and so were the dogs she ran as fast as she could around the area and
got the
hell out of there. I told my dad this story waiting for the laughs, my
father
was born and raised on the edge of this field and told me that after
wwII there
were reports of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a dark figure walking
the edge of this field it was a prisoner of war camp. it kind of made
my hair
stand on end after that I told some other locals and most said that a
young vet
on leave was also killed in the same spot a year before . No matter<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>how you look at its kind of spooky. we call
this place headless trail now and we don&#8217;t walk it<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>in the dark!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">These are some
stories that
my family and friends have passed on and I think you may find them
quite
interesting<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I am a great fan of
your
website. I have some stories that I have heard from family. Here is one
that my
Grandpa encountered, his father had recently died in 1993, and the
night of his
funeral, he was awoke by something. He didn't know what it was he was
just
awoken by whatever it was. He looked over and his father was standing
there
saying I am okay, please do not worry. My grandpa got a drink of water
and his
father left, he went right through the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Then I have one
from family
friends. This was when friends Steve and Rita had moved into a new
house, they
had seen several apparitions, that they have not really explained, but
really
just blobs, then here comes the scary part. Here are 2 stories that I
have also
inquired from this same person.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Rita and her
husband and 2
friends were in the family room in the middle of the day talking and
all 4 of
them saw a shadow jump from the balcony slide across the family room
and go
under the couch. Steps have also creaked and toilets have flushed for
no
apparent reason. This was also a new house, with no history of violence
on the
property. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Now for the second
story, a
couple of nights later, Rita was sleeping and woke to feeling like
someone was
sitting on top of her trying to choke her, Steve woke up to Rita's
screams and
flipped the lights on, she told him there was a man with a plaid shirt
in the
room trying to choke her, no one was in the room, she got up out of
bed, and
went to the dresser, looked in the mirror, and he was behind her, a
lumberjack
looking man in a plaid shirt standing behind her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This also might
sound kind of
queer, but my mother Bernadette, lived in a new neighborhood, when she
was
little, outside of the development was a field with a very small house
almost a
shed, whenever my Mom took a walk with her grandma, a little girl would
come
running out of the house/shed and talk with them. She was always
dressed old
fashioned with a dress on. She resembled a little girl like Shirley
Temple. she
said her name was Judy. My mom saw her several times, her grandma also
did too.
Years later when she mentioned Judy to her mother, her mother said,
nobody had
ever lived in that house, it was used for storage, a shed, and said my
mother
was making it up, and that it was a story. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We have never
figured out if
it was a ghost or not. My great-grandmother remembered her too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">AS A SIDE NOTE: I
HAVE PASSED
THIS PARTICULAR FIELD MANY TIMES, AND HAVE SEEN THE SHED BUT HAVE NOT
HAD ANY
STRANGE THINGS HAPPEN TO ME WHEN PASSING THE AREA, LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER
SAID NO
ONE HAS EVER LIVED IN THAT SHED, SO I DONT KNOW, RYAN A.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My name is Rodney
and I would
like to share a story with you that happened to me and a friend of
mine. First I
will give you some background.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">It's the early 70's
Enon,
Ohio, my friend Mike and I were very close because of both of our
parents had
gotten divorced around the same time when we were in our early teens.
We shared
similar interest in Magic and Trickery and the Occult.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We used to save our money and either buy
magic tricks from magazines or make magic tricks from plans that we
would buy
for our act. We appeared on a local after school show for kids a couple
of
times and in doing so we got to meet a local Famous person named "Dr
Creep". He had a Saturday night show where he would host and show scary
movies and he also did magic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr Creep
was really knowledgeable and had a lot of contacts. He told us of a
local magic
shop in Dayton and gave us directions. We couldn't drive at that time
but I
would beg my older sisters to take us there. Discovering that magic
store
opened us up to a whole vast world of new tricks and illusions.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The shop also sold paraphernalia for smoking
and it had a lot of what we now refer to as "Goth" type of clothing
and jewelry. Well as we were getting a bit older the movie "The
Exorcist" came out and we thought that what a neat idea it would be to
put
some drama and stage production into the act to make it more of a
"Show". We both attended a vocational school so there were a lot of
talented people there and we found a couple of girls that liked to
dance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We added dancing demon girls to the
beginning
of the show using black lights, dark jump suits to conceal the girls
under the
sheets. The music was Mike Oldfield's Hergest ridge (I think that was
the
title) The stage was very baron when the show started, only a small
table with
a dimly lit candle and the dancing girls could be seen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The dancing girl's dance ended with them
meeting in front of the table and big flash exploded and as the lights
slowly
illuminated they would reveal a transformation in the whole look of the
stage.
There was now 10' X 12" painted dragon silk tapestry hanging behind the
table and two silk banners of Beelzebub artistically lit with eerie
lighting
and I would be standing where the dancing girls had disappeared in my
cape.
Most of our tricks and illusions were dark in nature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My friend Mike
moved to
Houston a year before we graduated High school. He got a job at the
"Galleria" mall in the "Fun Shop". After I graduated I
moved to Houston and stayed with Mike at his mothers house. I also got
a job at
the "Fun Shop". Eventually we pretty much ran the place and again we
found a lot of new outlets for Magic and the Occult. We eventually
moved into
an apartment together as room mates. Our interest in the occult grew
but only
out of curiosity and it gave us Arie of mystery to other people.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>As we made more friends and our reputations
as being a little "different" spread we decided to really mess with
people. Mike's bedroom had a huge closet and being young he didn't have
a lot
to put in there. We decided to dress it up and make it look like a
Devil
Worship Alter with the banners we had and with skull shaped candles and
the
magic tricks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our plans were when
friends would come over we would show them that and freak them out.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The very night we did this at about 12:00 I
awoke to a pounding on the wall between Mikes room and my room. I sat
up and
yelled "what are you doing over there! The pounding continued
unrelentingly. I got out of bed and went over to the wall and yelled
"knock it off, I'm trying to sleep!" The knocking got louder and
didn't show any signs of stopping so I went over to Mike's bedroom door
and knocked
and said "Mike, stop it". The pounding continued so I opened the door
to see Mike setting up in his bed looking at the closet. My eyes went
across
the room toward the closet and as my vision passed his dresser I saw
the doors
slowly closing. I asked Mike what he was doing banging on my wall. He
said it
wasn't coming from the wall between our rooms, it was coming from the
closet. I
continued looking on to the closet as as I saw the door it was
"breathing" and jostling as if someone was trying to get out. Then it
stopped suddenly. We were scared witless!! We gathered up enough
courage to
both walk over and we pulled open the door with ease. The closet was
freezing,
we looked around saw no one or thing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The apartment we
lived in was
brand new, no one lived next door. Our neighbor downstairs was gone for
the
weekend. We asked the people behind us the next day why they were
banging on
the walls and they said that they hadn't and that they didn't hear
anything the
night before. We immediately started ripping all the decorations down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

fascinated with the Paranormal but I will not invite it in. I have
another

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My parents own a
lake house
in Northern Indiana and we used to have a neighbor named Mr. Cambell.
Sadly,
Mr. Cambell was quite old and depressed and one day he left a suicide
note and
enough food and water to last his dogs at least a week. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">He said his body
could be
found in the lake. I can not remember if it ever was found though. This
story
has many parts, all leading to the same conclusion. Mr. Cambell's ghost
haunts
his property but he seems to be quite calm and docile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The first Incident:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Well a rich man,
Richard,
bought his property, tore the home down and built a 2.5 million dollar
house.
Richard was extremely nice and was always coming over for dinner. One
day he
told us that he thought his house was haunted. He had an entertainment
system
installed that requires him to climb a ladder to fully turn it on or
off. For
that reason he always left it on and left the ladder in the garage. One
day he
had guests over and was going to put on the Indy 500, but the system
was
powered down. He said he had watched TV the night before and no one
else had
been in the house. At first he just assumed it was a power outage or
something.
He got the ladder and turned on the system, however all of the settings
were
messed up. The volume was turned down very low and the radio was on and
set to
a 50's station. The TV was off, because of the radio. When he turned on
the TV,
it was tuned static rather then the Discovery Channel Richard had been
watching
the night before. He said he played if off as an accident to his guests
but
that it kind of spooked him. Later, after this happened again Richard
assumed
Mr. Cambell wanted to listen to music but didn't want to distrub
anyone,
because no one ever heard the music.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Second Incident:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Richard also had a
"roommate" James (the thought is they were lovers, but no one really
asked). Richard would travel to Chicago a lot and James would be home
alone.
One night my sister and I were watching TV in her room and saw lights
shining
outside and heard men talking. We looked out her window and saw about 3
police
cars and about 6 police men walking all over the house, looking in
windows and
knocking on the door. We went outside with our dad to see what was
going on and
the police asked if we had heard or seen anything suspicious. We said
no,
"why?" They told us someone had called 911 from the house but only
breathed
into the phone for a couple minutes and then hung up. We told the
police that
Richard was gone and usually when he was gone James would visit his
mother down
the street. My dad called James cell and he was at his moms for dinner
and a
movie. He said he was planning on leaving soon anyways and came to talk
to the
police. James let them in and they searched the whole house but no one
was
there. However, in the kitchen a burner was left on high. James said he
had
made pasta to bring to his moms and must have forgotten to turn off the
burner.
After the police left, James said he sometimes got a strange feeling in
the
house, like he wasn't alone when he knew he was, but that he was never
scared.
It was more like being watched over then stalked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Third Incident:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My sister and a
friend were
sitting on our screened in porch one Friday night after we got to the
lake
house late. They saw a man walk from the pier to Richard's house, and
my sister
called out "Hi, Richard! Or James..whoever it is, haha" But the
figure didn't stop or reply. He just walked up to the house and
disappeared.
The girls said a light never came on and they never heard a door open.
The next
day Richard was doing yard work and my sister mentioned the night
before and
jokingly accused him of ignoring her. He told her had not been home
last night
and that he had just gotten back from Chicago early that morning. He
also said
James was in NC for the week for his sisters wedding. My sister and her
friend
were confused because they had both seen the man and they were worried
they had
seen a robber. Richard asked if the outdoor lights turned on and they
said no,
why? He said he has motion dector lights so if there was a person by
the house,
the flood lights should have come on, and his alarm didn't registar
entry last
night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Fourth Incident:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I was home alone
one night at
the lake because I was tired of getting eaten alive by mosquitoes. The
rest of
my family took a moonlight boat ride. I was watching TV in the living
room with
our dogs and everything was fine. We have an alarm system and every
door in the
house has a sensor. If a door opens or closes it beeps. This way when
our
little cousins are up, we'll know if someone goes outside just in case
one of
them wonders away. Well I was sitting there and the beep went off, but
I didn't
hear or see a door open. Then the beep went off again. The dogs have
grown
accustomed to the beeping and tend to ignore it. They didn't move and I
yelled
out, "Hello?" No, on responded. I grabed the phone and dialed my
parents cell, as it was ringing both of our dogs looked up and their
heads
followed the same path. From the front foyer to the kitchen and then to
the
back door. The beeping went off again. I was quite spooked and told my
parents
to come back. I told my sister what had happened while waiting for them
to
return. The dogs were still staring outside at our screened in porch,
heads
coched. They remained like this until my parents boat was back, then
they got
all excited about my family being home, haha. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Fifth Incident:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Richard had to move
to
Chicago because it had gotten to be much for him to constantly be
driving back
and forth. He bought a flat in Chicago and put the house up for sale.
James
left too. The new owners are really quite annoying and full of
themselves, so
no one ever told them about the possible haunting or the houses past.
One day
Janet came over and asked us if the house had a story. I asked why? She
said
she had been in the shower when she saw an old man staring at her. She
screamed
and he just disappeared. We told her about Mr. Cambell and everything
and she
sort of freaked out. They tried to sell the house but couldn't. She
still says
the old man watches her every now and then. The housekeeper says she
has never
seen the old man while she was showering but that she thought she saw
him one
day while she was cleaning. He was in the entertainment room, listening
to
music. She also said the five dogs will all stare at the same spot for
several
minutes on end, tails wagging, as if they were being talked to. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">6th-infinite<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We still talk to
Richard and
he has told us many more stories about the house, rearranged pantries,
the
entertainment system being changed mulitple times, and other various
things. We
think Mr. Cambell haunts the home because he can't move on. My mom says
my
experence must have been Mr. Cambell trying to get away from Janet for
awhile,
haha. (That incident was before the shower, but Janet was already in
the home
with her husband) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We still hear the
beeping
every once and awhile, and we all just say, "Hi Mr. Cambell, you can
visit
as long as you like." The dogs stopped staring and following him after
about the 10th time. They'll look up just after the beeping and just
before we
hear him leave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I am a bit of baby
so I still
get creeped out when I'm alone at night, even though I know he has
never done
any harm. My parents are the last people I think would believe it but
with so
many incidents, we think he is there living out his days watching
others. Maybe
he regretted killing himself or maybe suicide keeps you from moving on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I've been looking
for a site
for a long time wherein I can outline an experience that I had back in
the
80's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It remains extremely vivid in my
mind...as if it happened only hours ago.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Last year, while camping in Vermont, I related the story to a
couple who
was camping next to us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were from
Massachusetts and told me about Freetown State Forest and what was
going on
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also told me that what I had
described was what was disturbing people there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She called it a Pukwudgie. (Guardians of the Forest.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Lets go back to the
Story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am now 48 and I live in Valley
Forge, PA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My great-grandmother on my
father's side was full-blood Lenni-Lanape.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I was younger, I lived near Philadelphia in a town called
Flourtown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I used to practically live in
Fairmount Park, (Wissahickon Creek), within the boundaries of the city
of
Philadelphia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The park is about 20 miles
long and about 6 miles wide at the most.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You'd never know that you were in a major city when you are in
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a steep valley and there
used to be a ton of mills there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
park has a long, historical past and had involvement in the
Revolutionary War.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also sacred land
to the Delaware tribe
of the Lenni-Lanape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a Counsel
Rock there, among other things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I had been there
many, many
times and there are many great places.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is "Devil's Pool" where the Native American legends say
the the Great Spirit defeated the Dark Spirit and an imprint was left
on the
rock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is the Ledge, which is a
great fishing spot, secluded and out over the water. One of my favorite
spots
is called "Mom Rinker's Rock."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a finger of rock that sticks out from a hillside deep in
the
park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is only one way on or off
and the drop on all sides may not be sheer, but they are steep and
treacherous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the top of the rock is
an old statue of William Penn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Engraved
in the plinth is the word, "Toleration."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">One night, during
the summer
of my 26th year, 4 friends and I went to "Toleration" before it got
dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sat on the rock until late,
talking and enjoying the peacefulness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All of the guys with me, I knew well.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One, (named Stan), was always seeing stuff and it was a joke of
sorts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One, (named Andy), never believed
anything unless he could touch it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyway, we were out there for a while and Stan came back from
relieving
himself and announced to me that there were eyes in the bushes.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I was talking to Andy and was closest to the
land side of the rock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I laughed, but
eventually I looked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sure enough, there
were two human-sized points of greenish-yellow light.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After about 10 seconds, they blinked, twice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I asked Andy if he
saw him
and he said, "yep."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About
15-20 seconds later, the owner of the eyes stepped into the moonlight.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I'll tell you, I never saw this before and
never saw it again, (except in dreams), but have been trying to figure
out what
it was since that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">It/he was about 3.5
to 4 feet
tall and he was squatting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, he
walked in a squat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He moved that way
until he was about 12-15 feet from me, then he stopped and just stared
at
us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could see the shadow he was making
on the ground, in the moonlight and he wasn't transparent, (although at
times
he seemed to shimmer..)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked
wet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His hair was long and
damp-looking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His face was human, but
his nose was long, almost over his upper lip.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I couldn't see any teeth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
eyes were greenish-yellow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
wearing a shirt that looked as though it was made of sticks and I think
he was
wearing a loincloth of sorts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(It may
have been his skin too.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His feet seemed
bare, but there weren't any discernible toes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His hands were human, but his fingers were very long also.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">One hand was held
like a
fist, with a stick in it that only protruded from the bottom of his
hand and
there were beads and feathers hanging from the end.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The other hand was empty and he kept opening
and closing it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He didn't make any sound
at all, not even on the dry ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
have no idea how long we were there like that, but I do know that he
was
looking at me, because my friends, (including Andy), not only commented
on it
later, but they were looking from him to me while we were in the
"standoff."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">After a while, he
left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he didn't walk away.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>He moved to his left, (our right.)<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The path that he chose was directly off of
the rock, but he didn't descend, he just moved through the air and we
could see
him passing through the trees until he was out of sight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Needless to say,
none of us
moved for a very long time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we did,
no-one wanted to lead or be in the back!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We eventually made
it back to
the car without incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Although,
just before we got there, a shadow moved across our path.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No-one was frightened at all on the rock,
only afterward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We never went back there
at night again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had dreams about it
for years and did some research, but never found much.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I went there, with a friend, on the summer
solistace this year with my camera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had saved some soil from that night and brought it with me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing appeared, although there seemed to be
a "theme" that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everything
that we saw had red in it. Leaves, fungus, stray debris, and a passing
balloon
on the wind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We even saw a Scarlet
Tanager, (which is a very rare bird for our area..)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I took allot of
pics and
checked them all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I got back and
displayed them on the PC, one had orbs in it. Strange during the day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Mom Rinker was a
tavern owner
in Philadelphia during the British occupation in the 1770's<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She used to listen to the British officers
talk in the tavern, then she would pass the information, (in balls of
yarn),
down to Jacob Levering who was camped in the creek area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is how the rock got its name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
later years, the rock was also the scene
of a report from a mill owner that stated, "Mom Rinker was a witch and
he
saw her there on the rock in the moonlight using it as the place where
she
would start her broomstick rides."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This could very
well be a
typical report of what I saw, except from a man in the 18th century.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, I've<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>shared my story with a few people over the last 22 years, one of
whom
was in Vermont.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was staying at Jamaica
State Park there, which had its own reputation with the native
Americans and
the massacre there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told me that I
had just described a Pukwudgie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was
the first time that anyone had the slightest recognition of this guy,
much less
a name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would like to know if anyone
else has had a similar experience and/or knows more about this.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't really want to start a discussion
thread unless the people on it were serious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I've attached some pics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I've always been
pretty much
in tune with things since I was very young.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I've had more than a few experiences in various places including
Gettysburg, and some of the Revolutionary sites around here.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>But that is another story....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hi there. Great
site.. I was
reading through the activity spots in my home state of Michigan and was
surprised to see a mention of Lincoln K-12 school in Warren, MI. I was
a
student at Lincoln myself for a couple of years in the mid 80's, and I
had
almost forgotten about the stairway accident your poster mentioned, in
light of
two other brutal deaths that happened while I was enrolled. The
accident to
which the other poster refers happened somewhere around 1980. The story
as I
heard it was that a boy had fallen down the stone stairwell leading to
the
second floor and suffered severe head trauma, dying a gruesome death on
the
hallway floor. I was always glad I didn't have to go upstairs for
classes
because that stairwell just freaked me out. Then, in late 1985 or early
1986, a
boy with hemophilia was running around the fifth grade classroom and
horseplaying with other students while the teacher was out making
copies. He
took a nasty spill into a desk and bled to death internally before help
could
arrive. There was always something eerie about that room after that. I
had to
go there for math classes, and it always made me feel very
claustrophobic. A
short time later, maybe spring of 86, a man was shotgunned to death at
close
range and in broad daylight just across Federal street, which borders
school
property. Another man pulled a car over to the curb and shot him,
apparently
for sleeping with his wife. I was in the third grade classroom at the
times of
both incidents, and the murder scene was maybe 50 feet from where I
sat. The
spot where the hemophiliac boy died was maybe 20 or 30 feet away from
my seat,
with the stone stairwell maybe 20 or 30 feet beyond that. I haven't
really
thought about any of these things in a while and it never occured to me
to
connect them in my mind, but.. there might be something to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I don't have any
childhood
memories of my mothers father, however I do remember when he died, a
family
friend looked after me and my brothers and sisters so she could attend
the
funeral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My cousion had his birthday
party at my Grandmothers house, family members were there his parents,
sister,
two of my other cousions, my mums two sisters, brother, my grandmother,
and two
great aunties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw my grandfathers
ghost sat on the television in front of the television, he was wearing
a dark
brown long coat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't talk to him,
or tell anybody because as a child I was very withdrawn and isolated.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I have mentioned seeing my grandfathers ghost
in a book I've written, my mum told me that he did have a dark long
brown coat.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My name is Jen I am
17 now
but I was only 14 when I had my experiance in marsh cemetary. I have I
was born
and raised in glendive. A couple friends and I had been told by our
parents
about the cemetary. And all the weird stuff that happened there. We
wanted to
see for ourselves. So we drove our there and brought some sleeping bags
and
flash lights. We didn't stay very long though. It seemed like right
when we got
there stuff started happening. It was a pretty warm night but the
tempiture
dropped in not even a min. As we sat there freezing I looked over my
right shoulder
and someone or something was staring at us from behind a tall
headstone. As
soon as I got up to go see it was gone. We were scared but decided to
stay a
little longer. We were all sitting in a circle when we heard this
voice. It
said in a muttered voice please don't. We decided it was time to get
out of
there. As we were walking out we saw a younger women sitting on top of
a
headstone<span style="">&nbsp; </span>powdering her nose and she
looked over at us as if she were terrifed and vanished. It was a very
terrifing
experience. We have tried to make people believe what we encountered
there that
night but they don't. We know what we saw was real and that's all that
matters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Two friends and I
decided to
go down Blood Road one night. The road is dirt and turns into a narrow,
one
lane, Nature Road taking you down into a swampy area. While driving
down the
road all of the cars lights started to flicker off and on. The farther
we drive
the more the lights stayed off till they would not come on at all. No
headlights, dash, or interior lights at all. I stopped the car and got
out to
check things out and heard noises in the woods. Branches snapping and
sounds of
someone walking in the woods nearby. We never saw anyone around there
but heard
a lot of strange unexplainable noises and felt a very eerie presence
that we
were being watched. My friends were screaming hysterically to get out
of there,
so I got back in the car, turned it around and headed back out. The
farther we
drove out the more the cars lights flickered and came back on. I have
never had
a problem with the cars lights before or after that night and there was
no
problems found after inspecting the vehicles electrical and lighting
system. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>here
is another story that I thought I would
share that happened to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to
high school with a girl named "Peggy" although we never knew each
other in high school, I just knew who she was because she was a
cheerleader and
hung out with the cool crowd!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway,
years later we met through an employer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I only worked with her for about 7 months before she became ill.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We had become close friends.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was only the 2 of us in the office so it's
kind of hard not to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Peggy had become an
alcoholic after her divorce because her husband was not a very nice man.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>What happened is that her kidney and liver
basically started shutting down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were
both only 42 at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be 3
years this September since she has been gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The first odd thing
that happened
in the office was my boss and I were looking for a file and could not
find it
anywhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew Peg was working on it
before she went to the hospital and my boss thought maybe she took it
home but
I knew she hadn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We gave up looking
for it that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple of days later
I was in the same file that the missing file would have been in.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The phone rang, I went to my desk and
answered it and after I hung up I went back to the file and there to my
surprise was the file we had been looking for standing straight up!<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I know for certain that my boss and I both
looked in that drawer several times.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I saw it, I just looked up and said "Thanks Peg".<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Another time I was
sitting at
another computer which looks out into the main office and into another
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I'm not looking at it directly I
can still
see the other room (kind of hard to explain!)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyway, I was typing and looking at the screen (I am on the same
exact
computer right now) and I swear I saw someone walk by into the other
office
very fast! <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I actually got up and said
"hello?" It really freaked me out, as a matter of fact I have goose
bumps right now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can't say that was
her again, but I know she helped me with the file!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When i was only a
year old my
family had an old abandoned house torn down and rebuilt over top of the
property. We later found out that our nieghbors dad died in the house
that
stood before ours. Now from the very beginning of living in this home
strange
things would happen. My brothers room was the first room as your
entered the
hallway and in the middle of the night one night he ran to my parents
room
crying, He told them that he heard old music coming from the walls. My
mom went
to see what was going on and she also heard the music. She explained it
as
being very old music, maybe from the early 1900's. She put her ear up
to the
wall it sounded like it was coming from but when she did it would move
to
another wall. After that night, it kept happening. This isnt all that
happened
in this house either. When we would take showers we would often feel
someone
touch our backs, or shoulders, but when we turned around, we realized
that
nobody was there and after<span style="">&nbsp; </span>awhile we got
used to this. My mom was up late one night alone and i was back in her
room
asleep which was at the very end of the hall, She was watching t.v and
something standing beside her room door caught her eye. She described
it to
look like an older man, he was wearing a black suit and his face was
blurred,
she said that she couldnt make a sound or even move during this
occurance.
Around 10 years later we finally had to move out, so when people came
to
inspect our water strange things would happen, The water would be clear
and
fine early in the day, but when the inspectors came to check the water,
it
would turn a rusty color, it's almost like the "ghost" didnt want us
to leave, so we went around the house and said, we have to move now,
you cant
keep trying to keep us here. And after that, our water was fine!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I have two stories
both
involving the family dog both eerily odd but neither scary.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We had a german Sheppard collie lab mix we
got from pet-co adoption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her name was
Meka best dog in the world (as we all love our animals to be) writing
the story
I will admit makes my eyes water to this day anyway.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One night home alone, I walked down my stairs
and as usual in passing my dog I ran my hand across her head, to her
back and grabbed
her tail lightly as to let it slip through my fingers as we crossed
paths.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About an hour later my parents came
home and
Meka came rushing to my room as if she hadn&#8217;t seen me in ages which
made me
question my parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Mom did you take
Meka for a walk?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Yes honey&#8221; she
replied and I told her about my experience then she believed it to be
the
essence or spirit of Meka just watching over me letting me know she
cared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other is after we realized she
needed to
be put down, I won&#8217;t go into detail for my sake but I drove home from
the clinic
as I was the only one not in tears, or in the room (I&#8217;m not sure if I
regret it
or not honestly) after returning home my emotions got the best of me
and I
broke down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later that week I had a
dream about Meka, or at least it seemed like such in the half
awake-half asleep
state where reality and your unconscious mind meet and magic happens.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>As Meka often did crawled into bed with me
and shuffled her way up to my pillow and laid her head on it, then on
my and
gave me &#8220;the look&#8221; (If you&#8217;ve ever had a dog, you know the look) the &#8220;I
love
you and am so happy with you&#8221; kinda look.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I put my arms around her and stroked her soft short hair with
tears
filling my eyes as they are now writing this even years later.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I gave her a kidd on the bridge of her nose
or her head I am not sure which and told her I&#8217;ll miss her and love
her, then I
woke up with the tears running down my cheek, again as they are now.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m not sure if it was a ghost or a dream or
a combination of both, again like I said the state of mind where magic
happens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But for days when I was alone,
I would feel my eyes well up and whisper softly &#8220;Please come say hi&#8221;
she never
did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think it was her way of checking
up on me making sure I was ok, and letting me know she was ok too.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thanks for letting me share.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">okay so; i used to
live on
some really old house, no idea how old it was, though. when everyone in
the
house was asleep, id go to the kitchen to get a glass of water, and id
see
shadows passing by me. they were really dark. id feel cold chills all
the time,
and i actually felt a tug on my hair. i could hear the kitchen counters
getting
knocked on, but nothing was there. i went to lye down on my bed, and i
faced
the ceiling. i saw figures passing on the ceiling, and i got fraked
out. i
decided to go to sleep. while i was asleep, i dreamt about a demon that
looked
exactly like me. it was scratching, biting, and tormenting me. i woke
up
sweating and crying.. after we moved from the house, i stopped having
these
dreams.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is the first
time I've
visited your site and was taken aback by the story of the Old Spaghetti
Factory
in gastown vancouver. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A strange thing
happend to me
about 2 years ago there that I never could explain:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>my family had gathered at the spaghetti
factory to celebrate my parents 35 yr wedding anniversary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our table was right next to the trolly car. I
was sitting on the very last seat basically touching the car.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We had finished our lunch when suddenly I
heard my name called clearly. Everyone was busy in conversation and I
was sure
it wasn't anyone in my family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly
I started to feel very cold and nervous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I excused myself and walked to the woman's bathroom in the back
of the
restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was walking , I felt
like I was being followed by a prescence and a feeling a dread fell
over me. By
the time I got into the bathroom I was having a full blown panic
attack. I
didn't understand what was happening to me. I drank water but felt
frozen with
fear. When I came out of the bathroom, my husband asked if I was
alright. I
said I was and then he tells me that I was in there for 20 mins!!!<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I have no recollection of being in there for
so long, all I remember was the cold enveloping me and the fear...<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I've never been back to the Old Spaghetti
Factory since that day... and now I read this story on your site!! <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Im positive there
is
something paranormal going on there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We live in Catoosa
Oklahoma
and live on a farm back in the woods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
husband has lived here since he was little and has always said he has
seen and
heard things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said when he was
younger he was playing near the woods and suddenly heard a woman
shrieking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked up and saw a woman
in a red victorian style dress running and screaming, then he saw
another woman
running after the other in a long black cloak.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She caught up to the lady and cut her throat with a long silver
knife
and ran off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He says his mother's music
boxes have gone off all at once with noone touching them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We at one time were living in a small mobile
home and one night we suddenly heard banging on the outside of our home.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It sounded like something was hitting it on
all sides very hard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finally got the
courage to look out the window and saw nothing. The banging noise
stopped soon
after that.We have both heard a man scream for help out in the woods
over and
over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have asked neighbors if it was
them and all said no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man says over
and over HELP ME SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME PLEASE! It always seems to come
from
the same spot in the woods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have taken
pictures and have many with weird images, bright lights, orbs,
including one
that looks like a young boy looking around the corner at me while I was
taking
the picture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have a spare bedroom
that you can heard noises in sometimes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It sounds like the cabinets opening and closing, someone
scraping
something across the desk and banging on the wall.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have also gone in there to find the lights
on even though i had turned them off and noone goes in there, the
closet doors
wide open and things moved. Its a very spooky place!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This was a story my
grandmother told to me. This story was about my great grandparents and
I feel
you will find this interesting,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">After my father
died, I was
lonesome for him. On my way to the kitchen to get a drink in the middle
of one
winter night many months later, a strange thing happened. As I walked
by the
piano where there was a music box sitting, "You light Up My Life"
began to mysteriously play. No one wound the music box.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It just started playing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I made me
feel warm and happy because he
always sang that song to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My mother died a
few years
ago after my father had been gone for some time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
her death, I did feel her arms around
me sometimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The feeling was very cold,
but it warmed my heart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also came to
me in a dream on the next Mother's Day after she died.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was walking toward me and said something
like "everything is wonderful and do not worry about me at all."<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">These were strange
happenings
and very real to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am happy that I
connected with my parents like this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
miss them so much.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

about ghost story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1978, I was 6
years old as little boy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents, my
little brother and I lived in our old house on Earl Avenue in (Wrigley
area)
Long Beach, California since my father bought our old house in 1976.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Our old house built in 1938.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It has a large family living room with big
mirror, big dining room, 2 big bedrooms with walk in closets, 1 rich
pink
bathroom with mirrors, middle yellow kitchen, laundry room, garage
along
driveway, very large backyard with biggest garden beds, fruit trees and
desert
plants area with 2 palm trees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a
very lovely home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">About the late
August or
early autumn of 1978, my father worked at the fish factory.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>In the afternoon, at my old house, my little
brother slept in his crib at the living room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother talked with her phone at the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I stood at the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked
toward my parents&#8217; bedroom, and then
I noticed and saw a shadow wandered and moved on the floor at my
parents&#8217;
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said, &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; at the
shadow on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A shadow looked
alike small child crawling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt windy
by itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I checked up and saw no one
there on the floor, but a shadow was gone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was very confusing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In few
minutes later, I told my mother about who was a shadow was alike small
child
shaped-up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother nodded, &#8220;No, there
was nothing,&#8221; to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">About late autumn
of 1978,
the weather was rainy, my mother and I sat and watched TV at the living
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the kitchen, a frame flew off
the wall to fell down by itself on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Crash noises).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother got
scared to what happens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother and I
walked quickly to the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We saw to
find a frame was on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother
put back a frame on the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn&#8217;t
know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In the early
December of
1978, in the middle of the night, I slept and dreamt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I walked slowly in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
my mom was very sick, and had her green
fever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I worried about she&#8217;s worst
ill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My uncle and people laughed at
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I saw a blue baby crawled from
the corner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was very freaked and
scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The blue baby doesn&#8217;t have eyes,
nose and mouth as faceless and looked blue skin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
blue baby wore small cloth pajamas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
blue baby looks alike Casper shaped-up
about 18-month-old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I screamed,
&#8220;AAH!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The blue baby started coming
quickly to grab me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I woke up and the
blue baby clung my right leg on my bed about 20 seconds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I felt very eerie and panicked as my hair
stood up and my right leg felt very chill cold spot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The blue baby left from me, and then a blue
baby hopped and hopped noisy around my bedroom caused noises made me
scary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt noise and shaking on my
bed and smelled a strange odor like taco scent (bad smell) of the blue
baby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I felt continuing shook up on
my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I screamed and yelled,
&#8220;Mommy&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In few seconds, my mother ran
and turned on the light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Short time, my
mother saw and worried at the blue baby held the top corner walls.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The blue baby flew quickly into a closet
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hugged my mother because my
nightmare was worst.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But my father went
to working early.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 5:00 AM, I sat
on my bed and my mother cleaned up the closet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The blue baby faded away.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
mom
turned off the light, and then I was trying to fell asleep and felt my
bed
began shaking again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I woke up and felt
uncomfortable, and then my mom turned on the light.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I told my mom about my bed shook.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
nodded, &#8220;No.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was calm down and waited
until sunrise
morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The next day, in
the late
afternoon, the weather was hazy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
father cooked meats on his BBQ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I rode
on my little bike at the front yard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then I smelt quickly a taco scent (a strange odor) and freaked
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran to my father.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I told my parents about bad smelling there at
the front yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents laughed at
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought about the blue baby will
come back?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents said, &#8220;not
sure.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was quietly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was weirdest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In few days later,
in the
evening about 6:30PM, my father went out with his friends at Queen Mary
cruise
boat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother and I stayed home.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother sat on a chair and I sat on the
floor to watch TV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The floor began to
knock noises to annoy me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My seat felt
noises (heavy footsteps) on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was panicked to tell my mom about noises something...<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mom nodded, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn&#8217;t
know that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In the mid February
of 1979,
in the early morning, I slept and dreamt. I walked on the long hallway.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat on the table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
smelt a taco scent and saw a blue baby
appeared by the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The blue baby
chased me on the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran through
the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I screamed and fell
down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My bed shook again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I woke up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother ran and turned on the lights.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother said, &#8220;What happened?&#8221; to me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I told her about another nightmare.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother carried me to my parent&#8217;s bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My father said, &#8220;You sit down,&#8221; to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
sat and lay on our big bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I talked about
blue baby with small cloth
pajamas with a strange odor like taco scent smelling.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother talked to my father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
father understood fully to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In early December
of 1979, in
the middle of the night, I was sleeping and had good dream in my bed.<span

</span>About 10 minutes later, I laid in my bed but can&#8217;t sleep to look
at the
dark bedroom what happened to next, I saw many white small orbs
appeared in the
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many white orbs look size about
less than 2 inches round.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was afraid
of many orbs, and then I yelled, &#8220;Mommy.&#8221; When many white orbs slowly
disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom came suddenly to
turn on the light and said, &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; to me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I told my mom about many white small circle
thing in my room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said, &#8220;Nothing
there.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I puzzled that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On December 31,
1979; New
Year&#8217;s Eve, in the late afternoon around 4:45pm, my family were staying
quietly
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw the tall Christmas tree was
beautiful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one hour later, I took
into the shower at the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
bathing and sat in a tub.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father sat

around the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father&#8217;s leg
hit the floor, and shouted, &#8220;Get Out.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was still in the shower and I was scared of heavy noises few times.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t know about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
father threw his shoe at the blue
baby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father shouted, &#8220;Please get a
wood spoon,&#8221; to my mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother
picked a wood spoon, and then she gave it to my father.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My father held his wood spoon to check up
around the living room against a blue baby might hide.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother didn&#8217;t know to happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While,
I came out from bathroom and walked
into my bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took my pajamas.<span

 style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t understand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
mother told me about a blue baby with
small cloth as a same ghost was here from last year.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was very shocked and panicked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My

house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father saw and kicked at blue

spoon at blue baby faded quickly away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My parents puzzled that...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
parents told me about blue baby was gone and it was over.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I told my parents about smelling a taco
scent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents nodded, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I can&#8217;t believe that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
were ok.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">About in mid spring
of 1981,
in the early morning about 4:00am, I awoke but can&#8217;t sleep in my bed.<span

dream.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next night, I fell asleep
when ghost continued to touch and play on my feet many times.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I was so frustrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every

1981.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In early September
of 1981,
in the middle of the night, I slept and dreamt enough.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I woke up when I saw many white small orbs
there in my bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 2 minutes

 style="">&nbsp; </span>Many small orbs faded away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I thought that orbs look alike friendly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was weirdest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On August 23, 1982,

</span>We went to my old house in the evening,
6:30pm, my friend chatted with my mother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What happened to next, I walked on the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My legs stepped on a solid ball at the floor
of the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I almost fell down at
the hallway toward my bedroom by bathroom&#8217;s door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
solid ball was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was checking and
looking at the floor of
the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was NO ONE on the
floor looked nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was very
confusing about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told my mother and
friend about a solid ball alike as weird thing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother was frustrated and said, &#8220;Stop it,&#8221; to me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt uneasy and worried about that.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I believed that a solid ball was like kind of
ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ghost solid ball rolled on the
floor as possible as a ghost small child did play with a ball.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Two years later
about the mid
August of 1984, I was 12 years old, in the evening, around 7:00pm, my
mother
and brother were outside at the large backyard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I stayed and watched TV alone in my old house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was surprised few strange objects and dark
purple little figure child rolled and passed by TV at the living room.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I was confused and turned to look at the
living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw a blue-purplish orb
flew around the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It faded
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt freaked out alike haunting.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>In 3 hours later, I went to bed to say, &#8220;Good
night,&#8221; to my mom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was smiling at my

blew at my head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt weird windy in
my bedroom but all windows closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
head felt to appear cold spot of an invisible ghost.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I said, &#8220;I felt windy,&#8221; to my mom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
mom said, &#8220;No, you are just dreaming,&#8221; to
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t understand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mom turned off the light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
slept.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Following another
one year
later, mid August of 1985, in the morning about 10:30am, the weather
was sunny
and hot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother and brother went to
store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father and I stayed home.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My father walked outside the driveway by my
old house all the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What happened to
next, I walked into the living room, and then I felt uncomfortable and
uneasy
toward the shelf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat slowly down on
the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was trying to pick one book
on the shelf, and then my hand touched into cold spot air (gray
invisible
ghost) by the shelf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An invisible ghost
slapped and flew around me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt very
eerie windy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw gray haze
object.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I GOT SCARED and freaked
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, I dropped a book on the
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran and got out of my old house.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I told my father about haunting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My father helped me show and walked into my
old house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father checked up the
shelf with many books at the living room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My father laughed at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
father said, &#8220;Nothing there, you had just dreaming.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, my mother and brother got home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
told my mother about haunting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother
surprisingly believed, &#8220;Oh really,&#8221;

dreaming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn&#8217;t know.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Finally, few months
later, in
the evening about 8:30pm, it was dark.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My parents watched TV in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
I walked on the hallway was very dark
when I felt uncomfortable and uneasy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
ghost small child&#8217;s hand touched and pulled my pants, and then I almost

&#8220;AAH.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got scary and ran to told my
parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents surprised to hear me
about another haunting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We still not
know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believed that my old house is
haunted in Long Beach, CA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The blue baby
was a little friendly ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was very
scary and sad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a very incredible
story and mysterious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believed maybe
it was Long Beach earthquake of 1933.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Was it true?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t know.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My family and I moved into our new house in
Lakewood, CA since January of 1986.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because of our old house had some haunts and weird noises as
like footsteps

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I am from Virginia
and have
been working at this quarry all winter. On April 9 2009 a worker told
me it was
haunted. Three of us worked there and were there late at night. The
generator
on our truck has a idle position. It should idle back up when you start
a power
tool, but it does not work. So we never use it. Three times this winter
(2009)
I was using power tools and it idled back down and I went to go see
what was
wrong and it was switched down to the idle. Two of us were working
around the
truck and my buddy was in the bucket in the air. The other guy was
working up
in the screen tower. I did not think anything about it at the time and
ask him
if he changed the setting and he said no. Thought I would tell you just
weird.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I work at Woods
Services and
on many different occassions you may hear or see something that is a
little
funny. I was in the basement of a Residential Unit one night before
leaving and
heard someone call my name. I yelled upstairs to see what they wanted
and no
one answered. I continued to do the stock on the shelves and get
supplies for
the next shift when I heard someone call my name again. I turned and
walked
towards the stairs and yelled upstairs to the staff again to see what
they
needed and still no response. Just as I walked towards the shelf again
I heard
someone say my name behind me again this time....needless to say I ran
upstairs
and asked if any of the staff were calling my name and they said no one
was
upstairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Another time in a
classroom a
teacher, staff and client were in the class doing work. The bathroom
door
opened up the client looked over at the door and then closed on its
own. If you
know the doors in the classroom they are heavy and big. The teacher
walked over
to the door with a ruler to open it and when she opened it there was no
one
there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
