<br><b>Fathers Grave</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:girty@surfglobal.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>On a hot summer day I went to my fathers grave and sat on the tomb
stone which is a bench.&nbsp; It was so...... hot, yet windy(at hot wind).
When I sat down on the bench the wind around the stone seemed to stop,
when all of a sudden I could feel someone sit beside me and put their arm
around me.&nbsp; Knowing that my father is my guardian angel I new who
was sitting beside me.&nbsp; In the same token I was scared and got in
my car and drove away and this isn't the first or last time my father has
visited me.</b>

a big ball of light coming upon us really fast. My friend turn off to the
side of the road. and it just disappear. we turn around and park under
this big tree, an waited a few minutes,and wasn't long at all, my friend
said here it comes. again this ball of light was coming around the curve
head straight for our windshield, my hair started to raise on my head,
I close my eyes for a second and when&nbsp; I open them there was a little

<br><b>The Talking Tree</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cleady@alaweb.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Back when I discovered The Talking Tree,I was living in a 3 story
house my grandfather</b>
<br><b>had built when he was about 20,21 or 22.He soon died at the age
of 35.My mum,</b>
<br><b>father,baby sister,and I had moved into the house shortly after
his death.And one night,</b>
<br><b>I heard a scream outside my window,a scream what sounded like,an
old man being put to</b>
<br><b>his death.I didnt think any more of it,so I went to sleep.In the
morning I was to scared</b>
<br><b>to mention anything about it to anyone.</b>
<br><b>So I got my bookbag,and headed to school,when I stepped outside
our house door,</b>
<br><b>there was a big oak tree outside of my bedroom window,which I hadnt
seen when</b>
<br><b>we moved into the house.So I went to school.In the evening I came
back home,and</b>
<br><b>right before i stepped inside of the house,I heard a wisper,not
a yell,not a scream,</b>
<br><b>just a wisper,that said "Help me."I turned back to see nothing,I
walked toward the voice</b>
<br><b>a little bit more,and I noticed I was in front of the big oak tree.I
thought I was</b>
<br><b>hullucinating,but then it said a second time,"Help ME."And then
at the time I couldnt think</b>
<br><b>of anything else to say but "help you with what?"</b>
<br><b>The tree didnt speak back.So of course you know someone would have
freaked out,</b>
<br><b>that was exactly what I did! I went into the house talking really
loud and i was saying</b>
<br><b>"go outside a talking tree help me now i heard a voice!!!!"But of
course everyone</b>
<br><b>thought I was crazy,and needed a therapist.But I told them to come
outside and hear</b>
<br><b>the tree.They still thought I was crazy.But after this things still
happended.After that I knew I was the only one that could hear the tree,but
the question is...................why??????</b>
<br><b>Of course things have changed now,and i am no longer living at the
house and no</b>
<br><b>longer feared by the tree.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Growing up with a Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Richduerr@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>The house I grew up in (in Hamilton, Ohio), from birth until I joined
the Navy at 18, always made me uncomfortable. There didn't seem to be anything
unusual about the house itself, it is even a little plain, nothing really
much to talk about, though I know little of its history. However, as early
as I can remember, I always felt uncomfortable being alone in any room
of the house, even when in sight of somebody in another room. When I was
about 5 years old, I would sit in my attic bedroom (which I shared with
two brothers) watching TV while everyone else was gone at school. While
watching it, I would swear I could see something looking like little black
fingers of flame flickering behind my brother's headboard (of his bed),
which was just a couple feet to the right of the television. Whenever I
would look directly at it though, I could see nothing unusual. I tried
to convince myself that it was my imagination, but I usually got nervous
and would go back downstairs.</b>
<br><b>One day, when I was about 7 years old, I headed up to the attic
bedroom and heard voices from the bottom of the stairs, and thought my
brother left his AM radio on. I headed up the stairs, and as my eyes came
above floor level of the attic, I could see a picture on the black &amp;
white TV and still hear voices. On my next step, and a blink of an eye,
the picture and sound instantly vanished. Knowing that the picture should
have shrunk to a bright dot in the center before fading away, and knowing
that the top of the television would be warm if it was indeed on, I decided
to investigate. I felt the top of the TV and it was cold, clearly I had
imagined the whole episode, though I didn't hang around in that room much
that day.</b>
<br><b>We had often heard floorboards creaking in the rooms (especially
at night), and were always told by my parents that it was "the house settling",
which we accepted for a while. Eventually I was moved to another bedroom,
just downstairs from the attic bedroom (my bed was right next to the door).
As the days &amp; nights passed, I began to notice a strange pattern that
took place every night. It would start with a creak in the attic floor,
then another on the attic steps near the top, and again near the bottom.
Then the attic door would make a slight cracking sound (as if lightly pushed
upon), then on the ultra-squeaky board near the head of my bed--just a
slight little squeak. Then my door would make a cracking sound, then a
squeak out in the hallway, and lastly on the steps headed toward the living
room. This would occur every night just after midnight (not kidding) and
would occur in the reverse order after 2 a.m.&nbsp; The sounds did not
go by in rapid succession, they moved quite slowly, perhaps even a bit
slower than a very old person would be walking. Until I got moved to another
bedroom (the only one I didn't feel nervous in) at age 16, I never got
a decent night sleep waiting for this apparent thing to pass through the
room.</b>
<br><b>These noises did not only occur at night when almost everyone is
asleep (they were just more noticeable), and they did not always follow
the same pattern. One night, I was lying there awake and heard a couple
squeaks coming from the floorboards in the attic. They were light and far
apart, not at all like the heavy and close together sounds of one of my
brothers getting out of bed and walking across the floor. Suddenly I heard
the sound which sounded like a small AA battery (something small, cylindrical
and heavy) fall to the floor, roll across the bare wood part, and down
three steps. Then, total silence.</b>
<br><b>My two older brothers’ beds were at the extreme other end of that
room, and they could not have knocked something over in their sleep that
would land anywhere near the steps (we're talking over 20 feet). The next
day when both brothers were in the living room, I asked them if they had
knocked over anything during the night, anything that could have rolled
down the steps, or had they found anything lying on the steps in the morning.
My mom heard me ask the question and said that she had heard it also, and
assumed that they had bumped into something while headed to the bathroom.
They said that they had not bumped into anything and didn't find anything
on the steps.</b>
<br><b>Sometimes, I would be sitting in the living room by myself, reading
a book and hear a floorboard squeak in the same room. I would try to ignore
it, though when you've witnessed some strange thing happen you become suspicious
of every sound you hear. Sometimes we would be sitting in the living room
and hear a couple dishes in the kitchen cabinets clink together, or hear
the sound of something falling over in the next room. Yet when we look
around that room for anything that might have fallen, everything is in
its proper place. Rarely (though it did happen a few times) we would find
something fallen over, but with no indication as to its cause.</b>
<br><b>One evening, my sister and I sat on the couch in the living room,
she was reading the newspaper and I was reading a paperback. We both noticed
movement off to our right and looked over to see a closet door open FULLY,
all by itself, silently. This was most unusual because the door was usually
stuck closed. It also dragged on the carpeting (because the door wasn't
trimmed when carpeting was installed) when you did open it, this allowed
it only to be opened about 3/4 of the way.</b>
<br><b>We knew we had just witnessed the most obvious display anyone had
seen that there was indeed something in the house. I got up and inspected
the door and closet found nothing unusual. Great force was necessary for
me to get the door closed because of the carpeting, and the hinges squealed
loudly while doing so. It took a couple bumps with my shoulder to get it
closed into its frame again. On top of all this, the screw on the door
handle was missing, meaning that when you try to turn the knob to unlatch
the door, you had to push the knob downward somewhat (so it could grip
the shaft) while turning it. If you turned it too far, the knob would slip
and the door would re-latch with a loud snap. Furthermore, the latch assembly
and the door hinges needed oiling and squeaked loudly when turning the
knob or opening the door. Yet when the door opened by itself, it opened
COMPLETELY silently.</b>
<br><b>Something interesting to note about this closet, is that it is only
about six to nine inches deep, and apparently was the front door at one
time. I did not think of that when this event occurred, but more recently
I remembered having noticed the faint outline of a doorway on our front
porch, and asked my mother why it was there. She said that the front door
was located in that position before the old front porch was replaced, and
that it had been filled in and a new doorway was installed to match the
new porch. Though they filled in the outside to look like the rest of the
house, the inside doorway was left there as a small closet. This is the
same closet whose door opened all by itself.</b>
<br><b>One Christmas Eve around 7:30pm, we were having our annual family
gathering and the living room was quite crowded. I decided to sit on the
floor next to my mom (sitting in her recliner). It was quite noisy as there
were two conversation taking place at once, each with several participants,
however, I was not in either one. As I often did, I sat there listening
to both conversations, waiting to hear something interesting.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly, I heard a noise off to my left, in the dining room (which
was dark because the light was off), it was just a little noise that got
my attention for a moment. My attention returned to the conversations,
though I was feeling a little strange. Then I noticed movement off to my
left and looked to see that the hanging macram&eacute;’ planter was swaying
gently (as if caught in a draft or lightly bumped). I thought that to be
odd, but I returned my attention to the conversations. Suddenly I felt
this cool draft on my back and my neck, and felt my hair being lightly
brushed against. This sent a chill down my spine, and I looked to my right
and saw the other hanging planter suddenly begin to lightly sway.</b>
<br><b>I had enough, I wasn't going to experience anything else that night
unless someone else did too. I got up, crossed the room, and sat between
my to older brothers who were also sitting on the floor.</b>
<br><b>One other occasion made all others pale by comparison. I sat with
my mom as I waited to depart for school (I was about 14) and watching the
"Today Show". It was just another typical weekday morning, all my brothers
and sisters were all at work or at school, and my dad was asleep upstairs
(we could hear his loud snoring from the living room).</b>
<br><b>Suddenly, we saw something to our left, we both turned to look,
and saw a styrofoam picnic cooler, that had been in the kitchen, flying
through the air. We saw it enter the dining room from the kitchen, as it
flew a strangely downward curving path (not natural looking at all). It
hooked downward from about 4 feet from the floor, and suddenly forward,
lodging itself under a dining room chair.</b>
<br><b>We gaped at each other for a second, then I hopped up and quickly
checked the kitchen to see if anybody could have somehow been there, but
as I knew, nobody was there. I even checked all possible avenues of escape,
but the back door was locked and the bathroom was empty. Nobody else was
home anyway, and there is no way anyone could have been there without us
hearing them.</b>
<br><b>I know others may wish to experience a ghost, but I swear to you
that I hate it. Nothing scares me more than something that is not alive
wandering through the house. None of my friends understand why I never
get homesick, but I never want to go back to that house, even for a visit.
Even now I suffer. The other night I tried to write this, and left a shirt
hanging near the window. In the middle of writing, a sudden breeze blew
and caused the shirt to move. I nearly jumped out of my skin when I saw
it move from the corner of my eye, but sure was relieved to see what it
was. I occasionally have nightmares about these experiences, and they always
involve objects suddenly moving, or pages of a book turning all by themselves,
only I am always the only witness. This was always, and apparently still
is my greatest fear, being alone when these things happen. When you are
with someone else, its not so scary, you know you are not going nuts and
that others will believe you when you tell them. However, when you are
alone and suddenly witness evidence that you are not COMPLETELY alone,
that something not-alive is with you, its quite scary.</b>
<br><b>One night when I was about 15 years old, I was lying in bed (wide
awake as usual), dreading the beginning of the series of creaks and cracks
that made their way from the attic through my room, and down toward the
living room every night. Suddenly, it started with the usual creak on the
attic bedroom floorboards, then another closer to the top of the steps.
Then the slight cracking sound as if someone were lightly stepping onto
one of the steps. Then as usual, another sound near the bottom of the attic
steps.</b>
<br><b>I waited, expecting to hear the sound of the attic door (which was
only about three feet from my bed) to make its usual cracking sound as
if someone were pressing firmly against it. Then something happened which
I didn't expect, and which began to make me very nervous. That something
was silence. The pattern was suddenly broken, the sounds made their nightly
succession down from the attic, but stopped at the bottom of the attic
steps this time.</b>
<br><b>After what seemed like several long minutes of silence (time has
a way of slowing down when you're scared), suddenly the silence was broken
by a scratching sound against that door. It sounded like fingernails scratching
at the door. I was totally petrified, nothing like this ever happened before,
and I really wanted to wake up my brother who was sleeping soundly in the
other bed, but I figured he would think I was nuts, so I just listened.
As the scratching continued, I tried to think of ways that might scare
it off. I always tried to pretend to be asleep whenever those sounds would
pass through my room, so I decided to act like I was waking up. I started
tossing and turning making plenty of noise, but the scratching would only
stop momentarily, then continue.</b>
<br><b>I tried clearing my throat a few times figuring that if I didn't
scare it away, at least it might wake my brother, who might also witness
the scratching. Neither worked. The scratching continued, and my brother
continued to sleep deeply. By now my heart was pounding so hard that I
thought I might have a heart attack, my chest ached and my stomach felt
queasy, and I was sweating profusely. Still, the slow scratching continued
at the door just a couple feet from my head. I gathered my courage and
decided to sit up in bed (eyes tightly closed) thinking that the sudden
movement might chase it away. It did stop for a minute, but then started
up again. Next, I decided that I would have to sit up, pause long enough
for anything there to disappear, then turn and face the door with my eyes
closed (again to allow anything there to disappear), then slowly opening
them. The scratching continued, so I finally decided that I would have
to go over and open the door, though my biggest fear was the possibility
that something might be there. It was bad enough I had to witness a door
apparently opening by itself, and a picnic cooler flying through the air,
and the squeaky boards and the clanking dishes in the kitchen, the only
thing I was more afraid of is actually seeing this thing.</b>
<br><b>I went over to the door, looked all around the outside for anything
that might be causing it and found nothing. I then grabbed the handle and
slowly pulled the door open. As soon as I started pulling open the door
the scratching stopped. I looked all around the inside of the door, assisted
by the streetlight outside shining into the doorway. I could find nothing
unusual, but I figured if anything had been there, be it an animal, or
something else, I probably had scared it away and could expect to get some
sleep. My heart rate started to return to normal and I started to relax,
confident that my suffering was over for the night, but after a couple
minutes the scratching started again.</b>
<br><b>That was enough for me, I got out of bed and went all the way to
the basement where my dad was drinking beer and messing around with his
Radio Shack TRS-80 computer. He knew something was wrong but didn't ask,
and I didn't tell him what had happened, I just hung out with him down
in the basement until after 2:00 am before going back to bed.</b>
<br><b>Strangely, after that night I never heard the succession of floorboard
squeaks coming down from the attic or going back up. In fact, I never saw
or heard anything strange again. I waited for until a month had gone by,
then started asking the others if they had seen or heard anything in the
past month, and nobody had. For the next three years before I joined the
Navy and moved out, I never saw or heard anything strange again, and I
haven't heard from the others about any more incidents.</b>

<br><b>Cries for Help</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Amber N.</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This story may not seem freaky to you, but put yourself in my place
and you'll see why I think it's scary. I was at my friend Chelsea's house
and we were playing a game. We were getting tired of the game and decided
to go and play hide and seek in the woods. We got her brother Devin to
play. It was about 9:30pm. It was light enough to see but still dark. Devin
was the first to count. He sat on the trampoline and waited for us to hide.
I hid down by the river behind Chelsea's house. I was about to go back
to were safe was when I heard a noise. I turned around and looked for the
source of the sound. I couldn't find anything. So I knew I must've been
hearing things, so I turned around to go back. I heard the noise again!
It sounded like a little girl crying for help. I knew then that I definitely
wasn't hearing things. Chelsea and her brother had told me earlier that
there was a girl that once went swimming in the river and the undercurrent
was to swift for her to handle. She was swept underneath the surface. Whenever
her head came ubove the water she would scream for haelp. Unfortunately
Nobody could hear her cries for help. I turned around and raced back to
the trampoline to tell Chesea and her brother what had happened. We all
went back to the place where I heard the screams, The screaming had stopped
but there on the dirt was the word halp with a slash across it. You may
think that somebody could have been playing a joke on us but, nobody lived
clos enough to her for them to be able to play a joke on us. That is the
creepiest thing that has ever happened to me. The screams go on at her
house only once a month now. And they are just as creepy as ever.</b>

<br><b>Their Here--Haunting at my Folks Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: KateWa@homeproperties.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My parents still live in the same house I grew up in with my older
sister. My experiences with ghost began at about age 8. One night i had
just gotten into bed and was waiting for my dad to come tuck me in. The
lights were still on and the hole family was up stairs i wasn't alone or
anything. I was wearing a nightgown. Suddenly I felt two hands run quickly
undernieth my nightgown, up my legs and over my body. I screamed bloody
murder and my parents came running in. I don't remember if they believed
me but I never slept in that room again. I traded rooms with my sister.
Once she had begun sleeping in that room she would tell us in the moring
that someone would sit on the bed and say her name while they rubbed her
head, but she never opened her eyes during those encounters. A few years
later, I was getting my dad and I some ice cream in the kitchen. There
was a new bag of candy on the counter infront of me. Suddenly it flew accross
the counter. I ran and told everyone, they believed me when they saw the
candy on the other counter. Another time stayed home sick from school.
I was laying in bed watching TV, and I kept hearing what sounded like marbles
being dropped in the attic right above my bedroom. I was so scared I called
my mom and she sent her friend over to stay with me. To this day the TV
in our kitchen turns on and off by itself, and my aunt reported hearing
music being played in the family room when everyone else was outside. Last
weekend my family gave me a bridal shower at my parents house. When I got
the pictures back almost all of the pictures have orbs in them. I couldn't
believe it. Who ever it is is still there and still trying to be part of
us. Creepy!!!</b>

<p><b>Gettysburg War Cries</b><b></b>

<p><b>It was my first time going to the Gettysburg war site. First, we

<p><b>Ghost Children</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: grahamdellow@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My friend Will and his girlfriend Dawn moved into quite an old house
in Ipswitch about 4 years ago now. With-in 2 weeks of moving in, Will began
complaining to me about noises that both he and Dawn kept hearing. He said
it sounded like children running around the house. I was the 1st to visit
the couple in their new home. At about 11:30pm conversation was stopped
dead by the noise of footsteps from upstairs. It sounded like there was
more than one as they suddenly began running around in circles in the bedroom
directly up from where we were sitting. The footsteps got louder and faster
untill the ceiling light of the living room began to sway. The noise was
accompanied by childrens laughter and went on for about 2 minetes. Then
it stopped, with the biggest crash also comming from the bedroom. Dawn
suprised us both by darting out of the room and straight upstairs to investigate.
Me and Will followed, to find that the large heavy wooden wardrobe that
was already in the house when they moved in had been turned compleatley
upside down with its legs now pointing in the air. Although that was the
most physical thing that ever happened the noises continued. But about
a year later something happened that prompted Will and Dawn to finnally
move out. They often looked after Dawns nephew and had taken a photo of
him playing in the living room with his toys. After having the photo developed
they noticed the ghost of one of the children standing near the doorway
to the stairs. She looked older than we had expected, about 11.&nbsp; But
more disterbing was the childs stance. It looked as though she was pretending
to hold a gun to her head. Not too suprisingly Will and Dawn moved out
soon after. Im sure I have a copy of the photo somewhere. If I do find
it I will let you know. Well done on the site.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Reenactor</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: drum96pa@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;My name is Paul Boccadoro and I have been a Civil War reenactor
for about 4</b>
<br><b>years now, attending living history events and reenactments throughout
the</b>
<br><b>Mid-Atlantic States.&nbsp; I'd like to tell you about an experience
that my</b>
<br><b>reenacting group had at Antietam National Battlefield, MD.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My company, Company G, 96th Pennsylvania Volnteers, annually
has a living</b>
<br><b>history event at this famed Civil War battlefield.&nbsp; It was
here that in</b>
<br><b>September of 1862, one day's casualities amounted to 23,000 - more
killed,</b>
<br><b>wounded, or missing in one day than the casualities in all of America's</b>
<br><b>previous wars, combined.&nbsp; At one point during the battle, one
American was</b>
<br><b>injured with every second ticked by.&nbsp; I'd like to note that
this was the</b>
<br><b>ground upon which we were camping on.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;To continue my story, we traditionally take a walk into the
battlefield to</b>
<br><b>a small lane known as the Sunken Road.&nbsp; Here, Confederates
hunkered down in</b>
<br><b>a road that had been worn down by years of wagon travel, holding
off wave</b>
<br><b>after wave of heroic Union soldiers advancing upon them.&nbsp; Eventually,
the</b>
<br><b>Union forces swarmed over the Confederate's right flank and fired
into the</b>
<br><b>Rebels from down the road, driving them off.&nbsp; This is where
we annually took</b>
<br><b>a midnight tour, hoping to catch a glipse of energy left from 1862.&nbsp;
Please</b>
<br><b>note that even though the park closes around 10pm, the rangers often
allow</b>
<br><b>we reenactors to walk around - this is because if WE found ANYONE
defacing a</b>
<br><b>monument or even shifting a pebble, that person would be praying
for a</b>
<br><b>ranger to come by and save him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;So this night, about a dozen of us strolled down the Sunken
Road, and</b>
<br><b>eventually came upon a monument located in about the center of the
lane's</b>
<br><b>length.&nbsp; We sat down along the banks of the road to relax and
take in the</b>
<br><b>atmosphere.&nbsp; About 20 minutes passed with silence and a few
pictures taken</b>
<br><b>here and there of us around the monument.&nbsp; Soon, four of us,
myself</b>
<br><b>included, chose to walk the remaining distance of the road to an
observation</b>
<br><b>tower, climb it, take a few snapshots, then head back.&nbsp; So
we walked down to</b>
<br><b>the tower, ascended the few flights of stairs, and took a look around.</b>
<br><b>Meanwhile back at the monument, our Captain decided that everyone
had better</b>
<br><b>get back to camp, so he sent two men to go retrieve us from the
tower.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;No sooner had those two begun to walk down the road, when
the remaining few</b>
<br><b>men heard shoes and heelplates (horseshoe-like plate we wear on
our leather</b>
<br><b>shoes) on the gravel and earth down the road.&nbsp; First 2 pair,
then 4 pair,</b>
<br><b>then 6...and so on.&nbsp; Equipment could be heard rustling around
on the body -</b>
<br><b>knapsacks, canteens, cartridge boxes.&nbsp; If anyone knows what
it sounds like</b>
<br><b>to have men marching on a dusty road with full gear on, it's us.&nbsp;
The sounds</b>
<br><b>continually crescendo-ed until one man sat up, looked down the road,
and</b>
<br><b>stirred the other men to listen.&nbsp; Just as they began to sit
up and peer into</b>
<br><b>the darkness down the road, the sounds faded away just as quickly
as they</b>
<br><b>came in.&nbsp; Another man jumped up, went down the road and looked
over the</b>
<br><b>fences and banks only to find weeds and small shrubs.&nbsp; We figure
that if</b>
<br><b>this was some sort of 'ghost regiment,' it may have followed those
two men</b>
<br><b>who had begun to walk down the road to the tower to fetch us.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I also have another story I experienced first hand during
a sleepless night</b>
<br><b>in an old gun mill.&nbsp; We also used to have an annual event at
Jacobsburg</b>
<br><b>State Park, PA.&nbsp; On the land is the Henry Homestead, including
a mansion and</b>
<br><b>a house whose basement was the gun mill.&nbsp; The house now is
a museum to the</b>
<br><b>Henrys, and the mill below it is open to see the machinery and processes
of</b>
<br><b>old time gun making.&nbsp; The history of the homestead dates back
to flintlocks.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Our event took place very near the homestead, and since it
was going to be</b>
<br><b>extrememly chilly that night, the caretakers were kind enough to
allow us to</b>
<br><b>sleep in the house that night.&nbsp; Little did I know about the
death that</b>
<br><b>occurred in the house long ago.&nbsp; A young girl had contracted
a contagious</b>
<br><b>disease - one of those terrible, yet common, diseases of the old
days.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>had died, and since it was thought that her illness could be contracted
even</b>
<br><b>though she was dead, the viewing of her body was not a traditional
one.&nbsp; Her</b>
<br><b>body was placed on the large window sill inside the house, of a
'window</b>
<br><b>outlet' that protruded onto the front porch.&nbsp; This way, the
viewers could</b>
<br><b>stay out on the porch and peer in through the windows to see her
on the</b>
<br><b>window sill.&nbsp; Of course, now adays ghost stories fill the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;So now it was time to go to 'bed,' you could say, more like
hit the</b>
<br><b>hardwood floor.&nbsp; Of course, the lucky guy I am, I got a spot
directly next</b>
<br><b>to the large window and window sill.&nbsp; I lay there half the
night, listening</b>
<br><b>to each hour tick away on the clock in the next room.&nbsp; Eventually,
I had</b>
<br><b>enough so I moved to a spot farther away from the sill.&nbsp; I
laid there for</b>
<br><b>some time, and then heard something.&nbsp; The noise was coming
from - it sounded</b>
<br><b>like - downstairs.&nbsp; The best description I can give is it sounded
like an</b>
<br><b>older lady mourning, or crying.&nbsp; Possibly over the recent death
of her</b>
<br><b>daughter?&nbsp; It was not the house settling or creaking, as it
continued for</b>
<br><b>what seemed like years - ok, well maybe a few minutes.&nbsp; My
house also creaks</b>
<br><b>a lot, and it sounded like nothing I'd ever heard before.&nbsp;
Scared out of my</b>
<br><b>wits, I frantically tapped on the leg of my 1st Sergeant, laying
just a few</b>
<br><b>feet away from me.&nbsp; He awoke and I told him to listen.&nbsp;
He heard the sound,</b>
<br><b>too, but not even wanting to ponder over it, he nervously said "Wonder
what</b>
<br><b>that was," and quickly laid back down.&nbsp; The sounds soon died
off (no pun</b>
<br><b>intended).&nbsp; Sleep was pretty much out of the question now,
so I laid there</b>
<br><b>another hour or so until I heard something else.&nbsp; This one
is easy to</b>
<br><b>describe.&nbsp; Imagine being outside, and 2 other people are far
away from you</b>
<br><b>having a conversation.&nbsp; You can make out murmurs, and tones
in voice, but</b>
<br><b>not individual words.&nbsp; Almost like being underwater and someone
is talking</b>
<br><b>above surface.&nbsp; That's what I heard, only it seemed to be between
a lady and</b>
<br><b>a child - probably a young boy.&nbsp; Again, the sounds came from
below the floor</b>
<br><b>in the basement.&nbsp; These didn't last as long - possibly because
God answered</b>
<br><b>my prayers for them to stop.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;That night, I heard every single hour chime by, and every
minute crawl</b>
<br><b>past, and every second tick by on the clock.&nbsp; Needless to say,
the next</b>
<br><b>morning I wasn't a happy camper.</b>
<br><b>Hope you enjoyed my stories - and YES they're true.&nbsp; I told
them just as I</b>
<br><b>know them.&nbsp; Have a good one.</b>

<p><b>Ghost in France</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kim@brd.com.au</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is my first encounter with the paranorml but not the only one.</b>
<br><b>My family have close friends.</b>
<br><b>They have now moved to France though.</b>
<br><b>Before they moved the spent 3 weeks in their new France Mansion.</b>
<br><b>On their last day they got their professional photographer to take
a photo of them all at their breakfast table.</b>
<br><b>There were all there, Mike &amp; Michele (the parents), their 2
children, Debbie and Megan, their grandmother and even their dog, Selby.</b>
<br><b>They got their photo developed and they sent the first copy to us
and got another copy blown up and pinned on their walled now.</b>
<br><b>When they first got their picture there was an adult-like person
figure standing next to Mike.</b>
<br><b>It had (what they thought was) it's arm around Mike.</b>
<br><b>They got it checked out and it came back negative.</b>
<br><b>It wasn't a finger print.</b>
<br><b>Four months before Mike's father, John (Deb's and Meg's Grandpa)
had died of a heart attack.</b>
<br><b>John had owned the mansion and had passed it over to Mike in his
will.</b>
<br><b>I looked at the photo myself when I was about 9.</b>
<br><b>The figure (I'm sure if I can remember) was a glowy whitey-yellow
with a blue glowing outline.</b>
<br><b>It looked like a thumb print only it had an arm sticking out and
a hat on.</b>
<br><b>My mum thought it was John's sailor hat.</b>
<br><b>My mother can't remember where she put it though she does have it
online somewhere.</b>

<p><b>Ghost of a Friend</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MRI [mri@mri-vt.com]</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have really enjoyed the stories that have been contributed by so
many</b>
<br><b>people.&nbsp; It is comforting to have people who believe and understand
the fear</b>
<br><b>and self doubt that goes along with seeing a ghost along with the
disbelief</b>
<br><b>of others when conveying these stories.</b>
<br><b>For some reason I have had what I call warnings throughout my life.&nbsp;
They</b>
<br><b>are usually really simple and insignificant.&nbsp; Many of you will
laugh at the</b>
<br><b>first one that I can remember and I don't even know why I would
have this</b>
<br><b>'psychic premonition'.&nbsp; I was in the sixth grade at the time.&nbsp;
It is the</b>
<br><b>time when you start to have your first little romances.&nbsp; A
kiss here and</b>
<br><b>there and holding hands in the hallway on the way to class.&nbsp;
Such sweet</b>
<br><b>little kids we were.&nbsp; Well I went home from school one day
and I said I</b>
<br><b>don't know why but I know that two boys are going to ask me out.&nbsp;
(I told</b>
<br><b>you...it is really simple and insignificant)&nbsp; I knew which
boys they were</b>
<br><b>too.&nbsp; Well sure enough the next day they both did.&nbsp; They
had not previously</b>
<br><b>given me any indication that they liked me at all that is why I
hadn't</b>
<br><b>really believed that they would, until it happened.&nbsp; This is
how these</b>
<br><b>little warnings happen.&nbsp; They happen all the time.&nbsp; What
happens often is I</b>
<br><b>will be thinking something and whoever I am with will start talking
about</b>
<br><b>what I am thinking.&nbsp; It is just a strange thing, but I like
it.</b>
<br><b>I only state that because I believe they have something to due with
a sort</b>
<br><b>of psychic awareness that some people have.&nbsp; It is not a great
power at all</b>
<br><b>for me anyways, but I believe it relates to the reason that I have
had some</b>
<br><b>experiences with ghosts.&nbsp; Maybe I am open to them?</b>
<br><b>Anyways, my first experience was after a friend of mine had drown
at a</b>
<br><b>swimming place.&nbsp; I was walking across a parking lot to the
ATM machine when</b>
<br><b>I stopped to think about him out of the blue.&nbsp; I just thought
what a good</b>
<br><b>person he was.&nbsp; Out of the blue.&nbsp; I went along with my
business not really</b>
<br><b>thinking too much about it until late on that evening I found out
that he</b>
<br><b>had died.&nbsp; The time he had been at the swimming hole and the
time I had this</b>
<br><b>random thought were right on.&nbsp; It was a terribly sad time for
everyone who</b>
<br><b>knew him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following day we went to the water
where his body still</b>
<br><b>lay.&nbsp; They could not find him.&nbsp; I walked to a spot and
touched the water at</b>
<br><b>the spot where they eventually found him.&nbsp; I looked at the
stones and saw a</b>
<br><b>small gold peace sign.&nbsp; It looked as though it was from a necklace.&nbsp;
I knew</b>
<br><b>that it wasn't for me though.&nbsp; A friend of mine had been the
last person to</b>
<br><b>see him right before he jumped into the rough waters and I knew
it must be a</b>
<br><b>sign for him.&nbsp; But I thought he would think I was just being
weird.</b>
<br><b>A couple of days later we all gathered at a spot we used to like
to go.</b>
<br><b>Someone played the guitar and sang.&nbsp; I went home that night
to an empty</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; My parents were away in Maine for the week-end.&nbsp;
I layed down in my</b>
<br><b>bed when all of a sudden someone said my name.&nbsp; It was very
dark in my room</b>
<br><b>but a figure was sort of kneeling down next to my bed and when I
turned he</b>
<br><b>moved to sit on a toy chest that was next to my bed against the
wall.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was a really fluid movement.&nbsp; I was completely freaked out.&nbsp;
I couldn't</b>
<br><b>believe what was happening and I was extremely scared because it
is just so</b>
<br><b>overwhelming to find out that ghosts are real!&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned
back over and</b>
<br><b>covered up and kept saying over and over "just go to sleep, just
go to</b>
<br><b>sleep".&nbsp; Well I finally fell asleep and when I woke up in the
morning I</b>
<br><b>found my brother in the kitchen.&nbsp; I thought to myself ok there
that is my</b>
<br><b>explanation for last night, a logical explanation.&nbsp; And I asked
what he</b>
<br><b>wanted last night and whey he came into my room.&nbsp; He said what
do you mean?</b>
<br><b>I just got here.&nbsp; But don't tell mom and dad because I was
supposed to stay</b>
<br><b>here last night so you wouldn't be home alone.&nbsp; I knew it had
to be my</b>
<br><b>friend coming to say goodbye, but why me?&nbsp; Later I didn't tell
many people</b>
<br><b>but one person I told said that maybe he thought I was the most
open one to</b>
<br><b>this kind of visit and now I wish I had talked to him, and not freaked
out.</b>

<br><b>Ghost on the Road</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rich_farley@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was in a mechanized Infantry company in Germany back in 1989-1991.&nbsp;
We use what is called a Bradley Fighting Vehicle, it weighs about 51,000
pounds and looks like a tank.&nbsp; We were doing live fire exercises at
night and we finished about 2 am.&nbsp; I was driving a Bradley in a convoy
of about 10 other Bradley's, returning to the motor pool.&nbsp; The drivers
used a large night vision scopes to see by (it's like watching green TV)
and the Bradley commanders use one that attaches to their helmets.&nbsp;
While driving a commanders is to stand on his seat so that half of his
body is outside of the vehicle, so that he'll have a better view of the
surroundings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At about 3 am, I saw a man standing by
the dirt road we were traveling on.&nbsp; I figured he was one of the German
range patrolman and that he was just waiting for us to pass.&nbsp; Right
after the Bradley in front me passed, this (man) walked right out in to
the dust of that Bradley.&nbsp; I hit the brakes to avoid hitting him.&nbsp;
At exact moment my commander said watch out but it was to late. I new I
must have had hit him, I didn't see him come out on either side.&nbsp;
My commander then asked me if I had seen a man walk out in front of us
too.&nbsp; I said yes, and then he said that he had too.&nbsp; But when
he turned around to check for a body, there wasn't one any where on the
road.&nbsp; This dirt road was about 50 feet across and when we returned
to the motor pool, took a flashlight and checked the whole front end and
found nothing, no blood, no piece of clothing there was nothing.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghost, Spirit or maybe a Guardian Angel</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Woofswoof@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Onto the Cheesy Intro!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It all started one night.&nbsp; I
was ninteen or twenty, its been a while 5</b>
<br><b>years or so.&nbsp; I was driving home from by girlfriends house,
it had been</b>
<br><b>raining all day and in hte summer nights it would often get very
foggy, so I</b>
<br><b>thought nothing of the pachy fog all the way home.&nbsp; About a
mile or so from</b>
<br><b>home, it was a 10 mile drive, the fog suddenly got so thick that
the road</b>
<br><b>disapeard in front of me and I was having trouble seeing the end
of my hood.</b>
<br><b>Naturaly I slowed way down but I knwe this road had a reputation
for trucks</b>
<br><b>to just keep going through any thing that they encounreted so I
pulled to the</b>
<br><b>side of the road but kept moving.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It got so thick that I was forced
to determain taht I was still on the</b>
<br><b>road by finding the edge with my right front tire.&nbsp; Eventulay
it was too much</b>
<br><b>and I stopped.&nbsp; However not wanting to be in the car if it
was hit I got out</b>
<br><b>and went down off the road figuring if nothing else that I could
walk home</b>
<br><b>and come back and get the car the next morning.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where things get a little
weired.&nbsp; This is aslo where most of</b>
<br><b>the people that here this story scoff and walk away.&nbsp; The area
just off the</b>
<br><b>road has since become a wet land preservation arean and rightfully
so, it is</b>
<br><b>home to a very lage population of birds and various wildlife.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm walking along and things are
cool, a little creepy the way noises</b>
<br><b>echo in fog.&nbsp; I'm trying to keep track of the road off to my
left but its</b>
<br><b>late and the last car I heard was several minuts past.&nbsp; After
walking for</b>
<br><b>several minutes I realise I should have come to an intersection,
a big one</b>
<br><b>with lights and all that, stuff you can see through fog.&nbsp; I
stop turn about</b>
<br><b>45 degrees to my left and walk towards the road.&nbsp; After several
more minutes</b>
<br><b>I'm not there.&nbsp; Now I'm scared! I have no idea where anyining
is and even as</b>
<br><b>I go through a lilttle routine to calm my self I realise that that
moment of</b>
<br><b>panic erased all of the little sence of direction I had.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I paused to think.&nbsp; OK to my
north is a one of the roads I'm looking</b>
<br><b>for, to my west is the other one.&nbsp; To the south and to the
east is a housing</b>
<br><b>development.&nbsp; However there is a body of water aproximatly
fifty feet across</b>
<br><b>and mostly marsh in the middle.&nbsp; So what do I do? I walk, and
walk and walk</b>
<br><b>some more.&nbsp; After a while I feel like I should be in the next
county.&nbsp; At</b>
<br><b>this point I'm tired, the fog has me soaked and I just want to get
home to a</b>
<br><b>warm soft bed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I paused to consider this current
state I will remeber to this day</b>
<br><b>the following events in PERFECT detail.&nbsp; I saw clear green
grass, perfectly</b>
<br><b>dry and the whisps of fog avoiding it like there was a glass bubble
around</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; I natualy walk right in and as I look up I can see the
stars above me</b>
<br><b>like the eye of a huricaine, and moon light shining on one side
of this</b>
<br><b>tunnel above me.&nbsp; My attention was drawn back down to the only
objest in this</b>
<br><b>clearing, a branch that seemed to belong to no tree about four feet
in the</b>
<br><b>air.&nbsp; There were some leaves but as I thoght about aproaching
this hawk</b>
<br><b>landed on the branch.&nbsp; This is the only hawk I have been close
to in my life.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I almost lost control right there.&nbsp; It was huge at least
a five foot wing</b>
<br><b>span and standing no more than five feet fom me on this branch.&nbsp;
It never</b>
<br><b>made a sound. It looked at me, then looked arund then looked at
me again.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was completely captured by the image of this amazing creature.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may have been moments after it
landed maybe hours I don't know.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>spread its wings and in an amazing display of aerobatics it circled
me twice</b>
<br><b>in the maybe ten feet of area that we were in.&nbsp; It then flew
up in to the</b>
<br><b>tunnel, looped adn came strait for me, I was in shock, at the last
posible</b>
<br><b>moment I pulled off and shot strait away from me in to the fog.&nbsp;
I had no</b>
<br><b>choice.&nbsp; My feet ran after it and the rest of me followed.&nbsp;
I ran blind</b>
<br><b>through the fog expecting any second to hit something.&nbsp; Then
from the</b>
<br><b>distance I heard the hawk cry one time and presssed on and it cryed
again</b>
<br><b>and I stoped, I don't know why but is was like it was telling me
to stop</b>
<br><b>right there.&nbsp; I did and I realised where I had been.&nbsp;
I cant tel you how I</b>
<br><b>know or why it happened to me but I had taken a walk to the other
side.&nbsp; Its</b>
<br><b>the ony way I can expalian it I don't know what I was on the other
side of</b>
<br><b>but thats what it was.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standin there I noticed and change
in ghe fog, it became lighter and I</b>
<br><b>could see road right in fron of me I began to take a step forward.&nbsp;
Just as I</b>
<br><b>did the hawk swooped out of no where and struk me in the head with
a wing.</b>
<br><b>It knocked me back hard, I was sputtering for breath and realised
I had a</b>
<br><b>large feather in my mouth.&nbsp; I pulled it out and began to take
a step forward</b>
<br><b>again.&nbsp; As soon as my foot hit pavement a cement truck came
out of nowhere</b>
<br><b>and just about killed me.&nbsp; I looked at the fether in my hand
and considered.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after that the fog had lifted
enough that I found my car not</b>
<br><b>fifty feet from where I was standing on the road.&nbsp; The rest
of the drive home</b>
<br><b>was easy after that.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some other time I'll wright about
my other encounters with that hawk,</b>
<br><b>my friend.</b>

<p><b>Ghost Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lord-grail@home.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;My name is Heather and I live in Omaha, Nebraska.&nbsp; I have
only seen a</b>
<br><b>few ghosts or spirits in my life.&nbsp; Sometimes I do get the chills
though,</b>
<br><b>like someone or something is nearby.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The first spirit I saw was when I was younger, about 13 years.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>Mother told me to go into our basement to get some candles, which
wasn't</b>
<br><b>unusual.&nbsp; We spent a lot of time in the basement, playing slot
cars and</b>
<br><b>electric trains, and my Dad has a workshop down there for models.&nbsp;
As I</b>
<br><b>fetched the candles I felt watched.&nbsp; I scampered back upstairs,
startled</b>
<br><b>and panicked, and told myself not to be so silly.&nbsp; I gave Mom
the</b>
<br><b>candles, (I don't remember why she needed them) and felt the nagging,</b>
<br><b>watching feeling again.&nbsp; I opened the basement door, and a
round</b>
<br><b>green-white light was bobbing slowly up the steps, I think about
three</b>
<br><b>to four feet off of the ground.&nbsp; I grabbed my jacket and ran
outside, to</b>
<br><b>my Grandma's house down the hill.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I never saw it again, whatever it was, and everyone laughed
at me for</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; But I remember it clearly.&nbsp; It was green and glowing
with a soft</b>
<br><b>white light.&nbsp; Mom laughed and said it must have been a glow-in-the-dark</b>
<br><b>Halloween candy bucket, from the size and color.&nbsp; But she couldn't</b>
<br><b>explain how it was floating...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My house is quite old, a about 80 years, and nothing like
this has ever</b>
<br><b>happened again.&nbsp; We are the third family living here and nothing
violent</b>
<br><b>ever goes on.&nbsp; I still get the odd feeling, but it's never
been strong</b>
<br><b>enough to make me panic again.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;The second spirit I saw really floored me.&nbsp; I was 14,
and was riding my</b>
<br><b>bike around town, since it was a nice summer day, and I ended up
on 22nd</b>
<br><b>and Q, about three miles from my house.&nbsp; There's nothing there
but cheep</b>
<br><b>houses, and it's not a bad neighborhood, but it's not the nicest
in the</b>
<br><b>world.&nbsp; But it's not a cheep, run down area.&nbsp; Just...
relaxed, second</b>
<br><b>hand.&nbsp; Nothing violent ever happened there before (it's become
a</b>
<br><b>run-down area now) and there was no graveyard, or ancient indian
burial</b>
<br><b>ground or anything that I or anyone else know of.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I wanted to go to Dairy Queen on 24th and Q, and I was behind
it.&nbsp; As I</b>
<br><b>came to 22nd I saw a flat field where I knew there should be houses.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>was filled with what I can now describes a short, rectangular</b>
<br><b>tombstones.&nbsp; I saw a woman standing there, dressed all in browns
and</b>
<br><b>earth tones.&nbsp; I couldn't see her face or her hands - she had
a</b>
<br><b>head-scarf on and her hands were held in front of her, covered by
her</b>
<br><b>sleeves.&nbsp; I think she had on brown shoes, but I don't really
remember</b>
<br><b>her having feet or not.&nbsp; (I'm inclined to think not.)&nbsp;
I asked her what</b>
<br><b>this was, but she didn't answer.&nbsp; I turned back to the graves,
which had</b>
<br><b>vanished and replaced with the things that should have been there:</b>
<br><b>street, houses, sidewalk, trees...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I turned back to the lady and she was gone.&nbsp; I had a
very chilly,</b>
<br><b>uneasy feeling, and a few dead leaves fluttered by.&nbsp; I rode
away as fast</b>
<br><b>as I could.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I once saw a strange figure in the mirror, a girl my age,
13, but with</b>
<br><b>dark brown hair with thin bangs and braids past the bottom of the
mirror</b>
<br><b>frame.&nbsp; She just startled me, but caused no harm.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The last one I saw left me breathless and thrilled.&nbsp;
I was staring out</b>
<br><b>the window to our front window when I thought I saw something in
the</b>
<br><b>clouds.&nbsp; It couldn't have been lightning because it wasn't
fast enough -</b>
<br><b>it resembled very slow lightning.&nbsp; It was white and long and
crooked.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>got up and tried to stare out by the light was at a bad angle, so
I</b>
<br><b>stood up and walked to the front door.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;As I peered out the glass I saw a flash or lighting and a
giant pair of</b>
<br><b>silvery-white eyes, rimmed with blue, which then vanished in a flash.</b>
<br><b>The outside of the window was covered with condensation, like breath,</b>
<br><b>which smelled really sweet, like milk. I wiped it away.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I've come to the conclusion that the first three were just
random</b>
<br><b>encounters, but the last one was a kind spirit, one that was looking
in</b>
<br><b>on me.&nbsp; I haven't seen anything so clearly after age 15, but
sometimes I</b>
<br><b>see 'holes' in my vision, weird things.&nbsp; After rubbing my eyes
and</b>
<br><b>refocusing, they're gone.&nbsp; And sometime I can hear odd noises
and voices</b>
<br><b>no one else can.&nbsp; I don't think I'm psychic or anything, but
I do think</b>
<br><b>I'm a little more 'sensitive' then the people around me.</b>

<p><b>Nothing Too Unusual</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CNelson700@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am not sure how much I believe in the supernatural, I am a skeptic
- even</b>
<br><b>though I have experienced the two stories below.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am a 28 year old male now.&nbsp; When I was about 17 - 19 yrs,
living with my</b>
<br><b>parents in NW Indiana, I had a very frightening experience.</b>
<br><b>I was sleeping in my bed when I was awakened by a woman calling
my name, my</b>
<br><b>full first name, 4 or 5 times.&nbsp; My family members and close
family friends</b>
<br><b>are the only people who call me by my full first name.&nbsp; Nothing
seemed too</b>
<br><b>unusual - yet.</b>
<br><b>I was laying on my front side and lifted and turned my head in the
direction</b>
<br><b>of the female voice.</b>
<br><b>When I cracked my eyes open, I saw the most frightening thing that
I think I</b>
<br><b>have ever seen.&nbsp; A translucent human figure standing at the
side of my bed</b>
<br><b>with arms, palms up, reaching towards me.</b>
<br><b>I was frozen with terror by the site of this figure leaning over
me about 2</b>
<br><b>feet away.</b>
<br><b>As soon as the initial terror loosened it's paralyzing grip a little,
I</b>
<br><b>immediately stuck my face back into my pillow and pinched my toes
together</b>
<br><b>over and over as hard as I could saying "Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh
my God"</b>
<br><b>over and over as fast as I could.</b>
<br><b>The fear was so great, the feeling so intense, I don't think I could
ever</b>
<br><b>express with words how it felt.</b>
<br><b>As I regained some logical mindset, I slowly cracked open my eyes
once again</b>
<br><b>and slowly lifted and turned my head towards the figure.</b>
<br><b>I was gone.</b>
<br><b>My head fell back down with a sigh of extreme relief.&nbsp; I lay
there with my</b>
<br><b>face down and eyes shut wondering what just happened, and why.</b>
<br><b>I woke the next morning still wondering what happened.</b>
<br><b>My Grandmother, who was more close to me than anyone else, I think,
had died</b>
<br><b>in the recent past ( within a year ).</b>
<br><b>The figure was about her height, but had reddish hair coming down
to almost</b>
<br><b>half the way down its back.</b>
<br><b>The face did not exist, it was completely transparent.</b>
<br><b>The arms were transparent, but I could see the hands.&nbsp; They
were like the</b>
<br><b>hands of an adult white person (my family is white).</b>
<br><b>The shirt was striped.&nbsp; The stripes were about an inch wide
and were</b>
<br><b>vertical.&nbsp; They were in 3 colors, red, white, and transparent,
and followed</b>
<br><b>that sequence.&nbsp; The shirt went from about mid bicept to neck
to waist.</b>
<br><b>The voice stopped as soon as I looked up at the figure.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, that is story #1 and it is my most descriptive story.</b>
<br><b>Story #2 is less interesting.</b>
<br><b>I lived in a house in a Chicago suburb with linoleum flooring in
the finished</b>
<br><b>basement.&nbsp; The basement was basically a kids play room.&nbsp;
I used to hear the</b>
<br><b>kids playing, but not talking.&nbsp; I could hear them moving toys
around.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>noticed that sometimes I thought they were downstairs, but then
found that</b>
<br><b>they were not.</b>
<br><b>I thought nothing of it.&nbsp; Until one day I heard the 'big wheel'
being dragged</b>
<br><b>across the floor.&nbsp; I yelled at my children and told them that
they were not</b>
<br><b>supposed to be down there because they were grounded from the basement
for</b>
<br><b>poor behavior. Then I found out that there was nobody down there.&nbsp;
This was</b>
<br><b>frightening, but I was older and more informed about ghosts and
such - plus</b>
<br><b>it happened in the middle of the day - so it was not as frightening
as story</b>
<br><b>#1.</b>
<br><b>I am not sure if this next bit is associated with ghosts, but I
will tell it</b>
<br><b>to you.</b>
<br><b>In that same house as story #2, I came home to find a large crow
or raven in</b>
<br><b>my kitchen, even though the doors and windows were locked shut.&nbsp;
So, I went</b>
<br><b>downstairs to get a towel to shew it away and I found a second large
black</b>
<br><b>bird down there.&nbsp; I thought it was odd.&nbsp; Anyway, I opened
the door and shewed</b>
<br><b>them both outside.&nbsp; I still don't know how they got in.</b>
<br><b>Those are my stories.</b>
<br><b>Hope somebody figures (and proves) this whole ghost thing out someday.</b><b></b>

<br><b>'The First Wife Came Back'</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: PGalli8536@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>It was around 1981, my [then] husband was 19 when he met and married
a local</b>
<br><b>girl; when he couldn't find work in the area, he enlisted in the
Marine Corp.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;While he was stationed in San Diego, he got the horrible news
that his wife</b>
<br><b>had been brutally murdered.</b>
<br><b>After some years had passed, we met, became a couple, and eventually
I</b>
<br><b>moved in with him in his apartment which was a small apartment on
the 2nd</b>
<br><b>floor of an old house so many stairs to climb.&nbsp; Shortly after
we became</b>
<br><b>engaged, I had a dream, still very vivid in my memory and it went
like this:</b>
<br><b>One Friday evening, My fianc&eacute; &amp; I were relaxing on the
couch, watching TV</b>
<br><b>when there was a knock at the door - nothing too unusual. Mike went
to get</b>
<br><b>the door and all I heard was this joy in his voice of someone he
obviously</b>
<br><b>hadn't seen for a very long time; as he brought his guest into our
home, I</b>
<br><b>realized who it was - it was his deceased wife!&nbsp; She looked
very beautiful</b>
<br><b>and at peace: she had long brown hair and wore a beautiful white
gown that</b>
<br><b>drifted and flowed in the air as if she were standing in front of
a fan.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>two of them sat on the couch together, holding each other tightly,
laughing &amp;</b>
<br><b>talking as if nothing were out of the ordinary, and I sat on the
other end of</b>
<br><b>the couch feeling a little jealous and like a third wheel.&nbsp;
Finally, Sunday</b>
<br><b>evening came along and it was time for them to say good-bye; they
stood at</b>
<br><b>the top of the stairs, crying, hugging and saying their good-byes
- she</b>
<br><b>floated to the bottom of the stairs, drifted through the door, and
she was</b>
<br><b>gone.</b>
<br><b>I woke up and thought it was somewhat odd but didn't dare say anything
to</b>
<br><b>Mike since the death of his wife was still a sensitive subject.&nbsp;
Finally</b>
<br><b>after about a year, I told him the whole story of my dream. He got
very quiet</b>
<br><b>and looked down as if he were going to cry and said, "I had the
exact same</b>
<br><b>dream about the same time!"&nbsp; I made him swear that he was telling
the truth</b>
<br><b>and he did.&nbsp; I think we had been given the blessing of our
upcoming marriage</b>
<br><b>from someone we didn't expect.</b><b></b>
<p><b>'The Creepy Old House'</b>
<br><b>I never realized how ghosts actually existed, but since I've read
Echo</b>
<br><b>Bodine's 'Relax, It's Only A Ghost' I'm a firm believer of their
behavior.</b>
<br><b>The "symptoms" as she described in her book convinced me:&nbsp;
I lived in an old</b>
<br><b>two-story, three bedroom house, with a brick basement held together
with dirt</b>
<br><b>in the older part of town.&nbsp; The house was solid, built sometime
in the 1930s</b>
<br><b>but I never knew the history of my old house - I just liked it because
it was</b>
<br><b>old, it had history, and spacious, and underneath all that lead-based
paint</b>
<br><b>was some beautiful wood that I'd hoped one day I would uncover and
refinish</b>
<br><b>to it's original, natural beauty.&nbsp; I often felt the presence
of someone and,</b>
<br><b>of course, when I turned around no one was there - even when I knew
I was the</b>
<br><b>only one home, and often felt cold spots.&nbsp; One morning when
I was in my 8 &frac12;</b>
<br><b>month of pregnancy, I was resting in my recliner when I heard someone
walking</b>
<br><b>down the hall upstairs; I looked down on the floor thinking it was
just the</b>
<br><b>dog but she was lying on the floor beside me, and the most bizarre
part was</b>
<br><b>she was looking upstairs to see who was up there, too!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghost Story of Onyx</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ELitkowiak@zebra.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have one experience to share with you - you need to know that before
this</b>
<br><b>event, I was a confirmed skeptic. Never had anything funky happen
to me,</b>
<br><b>ever. I am not even religious.</b>
<br><b>About 17 or so years ago I was living in Evanston, Illinois and
I had 2</b>
<br><b>cats; Bibber (a.k.a. Blizzard) and Onyx. Bibber was all white and
Onyx,&nbsp; all</b>
<br><b>black.&nbsp; I'd found Onyx at a Sav-A-Pet tent event held at Old
Orchard in</b>
<br><b>Skokie. He was about 1-1/2 years old at the time and it was an instant
bond.</b>
<br><b>He also got along famously with Bibber.</b>
<br><b>Onyx was about 4 when one day, I couldn't find him. This was a Monday,
and</b>
<br><b>they're both indoor cats. I thought it odd, but went to work. Came
back home</b>
<br><b>and still couldn't find him, so I searched the house. Found him
in the</b>
<br><b>basement hiding on top of the duct work. Brought him down and he
advised me</b>
<br><b>loudly that he was in pain. He was ok once I put him down.</b>
<br><b>Called the vet and described what was going on, and the vet felt
that it</b>
<br><b>could wait until the morning. So, Tuesday am, I rushed him to the
vet.</b>
<br><b>Wednesday I get a call saying that Onyx had what was apparently
a hereditary</b>
<br><b>based kidney failure and was on dialysis, but was doing very well.
There was</b>
<br><b>hope for a complete recovery.</b>
<br><b>Onyx was to stay at the vets under observation at least until Saturday.</b>
<br><b>Friday night, I was sitting with my girlfriend Liz Condit, watching
TV.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was probably around 10:30 pm.&nbsp; All of a sudden, I had this
very distinct</b>
<br><b>impression that there was something forming about 2-3 feet in front
of me.</b>
<br><b>It didn't take up a lot of area, maybe only about 2 feet in diameter.
I</b>
<br><b>could not actually "see" anything, but I had the impression of something</b>
<br><b>slowly swirling, almost like smoke or cloud.</b>
<br><b>Then I had the impression that it was cold, extremely cold, like
dry ice. It</b>
<br><b>paused for a moment in front of me and then it came toward my chest
and went</b>
<br><b>directly through me, very fast. The cold was unbelievable and lasted
less</b>
<br><b>than a second.</b>
<br><b>Immediately I screamed and started crying uncontrollably; couldn't
stop. Liz</b>
<br><b>asked what was wrong with me and I told her that Onyx was dead and
he'd come</b>
<br><b>back to say goodbye. It was an absolute knowledge and it shattered
me.</b>
<br><b>This was so long ago and as I'm writing this, I'm crying again.
Can't help</b>
<br><b>it.</b>
<br><b>Well, to say the least, when I got a call at 8:30 the next morning,
I</b>
<br><b>already knew what they were calling to tell me - Onyx had passed
away around</b>
<br><b>11 pm the night prior.</b>
<br><b>Since then I have not changed my opinion about the existence of
a god, but</b>
<br><b>there is NO doubt that something does survive at least the immediate
death</b>
<br><b>of the body. Don't know if it lasts any longer than a few minutes,
but there</b>
<br><b>is at least, a brief hereafter.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Old House Noises</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cifer_x@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have always believed that ghost or spirits exist, but I'm also
a big</b>
<br><b>skeptic. Although I have never actually seen one, I think that I
might have</b>
<br><b>one at my new home. In an old house one would expect "old house
noises"</b>
<br><b>because moisture would get in the wood and it would expand and such.
So</b>
<br><b>weird noises never really bothered me. But sometimes I would hear
someone</b>
<br><b>trying to open and close doors or someone moving around in the dark
- so I</b>
<br><b>would grab a stick and look around the house to see if some one
is trying to</b>
<br><b>break in... nothing.</b>
<br><b>This happened very often so I just ingore them now. One night I
was sleeping</b>
<br><b>in my room then I suddenly felt very hot. I though I saw red lights
and</b>
<br><b>smoke coming from under my door. I thought the house was on fire
and I</b>
<br><b>started to panic, so I jumped out of bed and I noticed the smoke
was gone. I</b>
<br><b>opened the door and nothing, no fire, no activity.</b>
<br><b>My girlfriend is another strong believer of ghost. She was actually
the</b>
<br><b>first person who saw the moving shadows. One afternoon in broad
day light,</b>
<br><b>we were watching tv and she was sitting beside me. Then she just
suddenly</b>
<br><b>grabbed my arm and lifted her feet off the floor because she saw
shadows run</b>
<br><b>from the door and tried to grab her feet. I did notice there were
a lot of</b>
<br><b>shadows on the floor but I pretended it was nothing, so I told her
to calm</b>
<br><b>down and just ignore it. She never wanted to come back to my house
and took</b>
<br><b>me a whole month to convince her to return.</b>
<br><b>One night I was in the basement(my brothers room) watching tv. It
is always</b>
<br><b>unusually cold in the basement even in the summer(If this is cause
by the</b>
<br><b>ghost I definetly appreciate it). My brother has this toy that talks
when</b>
<br><b>you put it on your hand or anything that conducts. Well while I
was watching</b>
<br><b>tv this toy just started talking away. It did this several times
until I</b>
<br><b>walked up to it and picked it up it stopped - it was on a wooden
table.</b>
<br><b>Ever since I've acknowledge this presence it has been playing tricks
on me.</b>
<br><b>Now it has began hiding things from me, turning up the vol on my
tv, and</b>
<br><b>worse following me around. How do I know if follows me? I once read
this</b>
<br><b>article that sometimes the presence of a ghost will cause motion
sickness to</b>
<br><b>a person who is exposed for a prolonged period of time.</b>
<br><b>I had severe motion sickness and a doctor had to prescribe me pills
for</b>
<br><b>them. My doctor said that vertigo is very uncommon to people past
puberty.</b>
<br><b>As soon as I read the article about ghosts causing vertigo, it just
made</b>
<br><b>sense.</b>
<br><b>I think my house ghost is friendly, it keeps to itself most of the
time and</b>
<br><b>I've grown quite fond of it. I am definetly thankful for those cold
spots in</b>
<br><b>the summer because it is a relief from the heat.</b>

<br><b>Hopewell Park</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Salem@oknet1.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>It was around midnight.&nbsp; My friends and I were bored so we loaded
up into my</b>
<br><b>van.&nbsp; We didn't know where to go because everywhere was closed.&nbsp;
Someone</b>
<br><b>suggested that we visit Hopewell park, a supposedly haunted place
that I had</b>
<br><b>never visited before.&nbsp; So I drive us into the mountains, to
a 2 lane road</b>
<br><b>that goes through the woods.&nbsp; As we near, one of my friends
tells me the</b>
<br><b>story of how a family was murdered by a man in the 50's in the park.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>later asked around and found the story to actually be true.&nbsp;
It would</b>
<br><b>explain why no one went to the park anymore, and why the grass was
so high</b>
<br><b>that it was impossible to even see some parts of the park.&nbsp;
So we arrive at</b>
<br><b>the empty park.&nbsp; There are no lights anywhere except for the
headlights.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>are scared, but see nothing, so I keep driving.&nbsp; Then I hear
everyone</b>
<br><b>screaming and I look to my side and see a huge blue flame coming
from the</b>
<br><b>woods.&nbsp; At first I try to drive away because we are all scared
and don't</b>
<br><b>know what it is.&nbsp; Then we calm down some and I pull over.&nbsp;
By that time, the</b>
<br><b>light had gone out.&nbsp; Half of us get out, while the other half
stay in the</b>
<br><b>car with the engine running.&nbsp; We use the headlights as our
only source of</b>
<br><b>light as we walk toward where the flame had been.&nbsp; As the headlights
from my</b>
<br><b>van begin to fade behind us, we keep walking until we come to an
open fridge</b>
<br><b>that someone had abandoned.&nbsp; We realize the flame had come
from inside of</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; There was no one around and no reason it should have caused
a flame.</b>
<br><b>Since then, I've gone out there many times, and had many odd things
happen.</b>
<br><b>For some reason, every time I go out there, there is only one other
car</b>
<br><b>parked at the park, yet no matter how long I stay, or how hard I
search, I</b>
<br><b>can never find a sign of the other person.&nbsp; It is rumored that
cults/KKK go</b>
<br><b>to the park at night, though it is probably just a rumor...but one
thing I</b>
<br><b>do know is that lately, every time I go up there, cops are there.&nbsp;
We still</b>
<br><b>have no idea what the cops are always doing and why they are blocking
anyone</b>
<br><b>from entering.</b>

<br><b>Ghost and Things that Go Bump in the Night!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bear@inreach.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This took place during college while I was taking classes in both</b>
<br><b>anthropology (spirit healers) and parapsychology. The parapsychology
class</b>
<br><b>had gone to a little town north of Sacramento, California to investigate
a</b>
<br><b>supposed haunted (half-way) house. We, the class, were told that
a woman,</b>
<br><b>the original owner, had died there some years before and that many
people</b>
<br><b>had seen her. The half-way manager wanted some kine of confirmation
from</b>
<br><b>our group.</b>
<br><b>We went there and set up our equipment at 5:00 PM, and by 1:00 AM
nothing</b>
<br><b>had happened. We all decided that we would probably not see or experience</b>
<br><b>anything that night and all headed for various rooms to sack out.
My (ex)</b>
<br><b>wife and I were in the living room, she on a couch and me on the
floor. I</b>
<br><b>was abruptly awakened by something jumping onto my chest and then
running</b>
<br><b>out of the room. My wife said that she had been awakened by a small
dog</b>
<br><b>licking her face.</b>
<br><b>The next morning I asked if anything had occured with anyone else.
The</b>
<br><b>couple in the room next to us said that they were awakened by a
small dog</b>
<br><b>running by them making whimpering noises. The half-way house manager
said</b>
<br><b>there were no animals in the house, cat or dog.</b>
<br><b>Later research of the woman who had died explained this mystery.
She had</b>
<br><b>died and it was about a month before anybody discovered her body;
laying</b>
<br><b>with her was her small dog that had apparently died of starvation
and/or</b>
<br><b>dehydration.</b>
<br><b>This event proved to be a beginning point for me in seeing animal
ghosts.</b>
<br><b>Human apparitions I've seen and documented, but I haven't really
heard too</b>
<br><b>much about people who see and/or interact with animal spirits.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghostly Encounter</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: thenorrells@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi Dave,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years ago, I was at the house of a friend
whose children went to the Catholic school I was then teaching at.&nbsp;
She told me about a ghost who resided with them.&nbsp; I was interested
in the stories that she told, but was somewhat skeptical.&nbsp; I come
from a large Irish-Catholic family and ghost stories are not that unusual.&nbsp;
At any rate, we were standing on her front porch as I was readying to leave
and I felt something heavy and cold put it's arm on my shoulder.&nbsp;
Theresa was on the other side of me...no one was on my left wrapping their
arm to the right, which is what I felt.&nbsp; Theresa stiffened and said,
"He's here."&nbsp; I guess that my face had gone ashen because she told
me later that it was obvious that the ghost had let me know of his presence.&nbsp;
After the "hug", (this sounds weird, I know...)it felt as though something
was trying to "put me on" like a jacket.&nbsp; I remember being very frightened
at that point and saying to myself, "You're scaring me, please stop."&nbsp;
It went on for a second longer and then the feeling vanished.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you'd like, I'll give you the name of the
family that originally lived in the historic house.&nbsp; The ghosts in
the house have a reputation for following people home.&nbsp; I have 2 children
and don't want them involved in this.&nbsp; The family has quite a history
in Fort Worth.</b>

<p><b>Hi My name is Andrew. I'm a big fan of your website. A few years
ago I went</b>
<br><b>to Gettysburg. While I&nbsp; was there, I had a few weird things
happen to</b>
<br><b>me.First,when I was visiting Lee's HQ, I had a feeling that something
was</b>
<br><b>watching me from behind. But every time that I turned around, no
one was</b>
<br><b>there. Well, I thought it was pretty weird. Soon after that, I forgot
all</b>
<br><b>about it ands moved along. But later that day, something more physical</b>
<br><b>happened to me....</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was at the high water mark area (the place were the</b>
<br><b>North defended the center position from the South, also known as
Picketts</b>
<br><b>charge). I was looking at a sign about what happened, and someone,
(or</b>
<br><b>something) touched me on the shoulder. But it wasn't any kind of
touch. it</b>
<br><b>was like someone was looking over my shoulder at the sign. I had
thought it</b>
<br><b>was my Grandpa, who I had run ahead of, when I turned around to
say something</b>
<br><b>to him, he wasn't there. He, and everyone else around there, was
20 feet</b>
<br><b>away. Pretty weird, huh!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Well, that is a true story about what happened to me at Gettysburg.
BELIEVE</b>
<br><b>IT, OR NOT.</b>

<p><b>Unexplainable Sightings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:janet_beers@madasafish.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Ever since childhood I have encounted strange unexplainable sightings
of which nobody</b>
<br><b>I've told really believes me. They interpret what I see as my Imagination
and generally</b>
<br><b>laugh which in turn makes me doubt myself. I just tend to keep it
to myself for fear of</b>
<br><b>being branded as an Idiot.</b>
<br><b>As a baby I can remember waking in the night as I lay in my cot
beside my mothers bed.</b>
<br><b>The bedroom door which was directly in front of me was ajar and
this woman was standing</b>
<br><b>in the doorway looking at me. She did not frighten me, in fact I
felt quite comforted by her</b>
<br><b>appearance although I obviously wondered who she was. She was dressed
in blue, the</b>
<br><b>the strangest blue I have ever seen, I cannot really describe the
colour in depth as it seemed</b>
<br><b>to give off a luminous light. Her hair was shoulder length and dark
and she appeared to have</b>
<br><b>a beam of light above her head. She had a kindly expression on her
face. I feel she was an</b>
<br><b>angel. In the morning I questioned my mother as to who the lady
was and she was completely</b>
<br><b>confused. We never found out.</b>
<br><b>Years later when I was married with children we moved up north to
oldham, and stayed there</b>
<br><b>for a number of years before moving down south again. When selling
our house a family came</b>
<br><b>to view it and stayed for a couple of hours, they were husband and
wife quite elderly and their</b>
<br><b>grown up son and daughter - in - law. On their departure I asked
my husband where the older</b>
<br><b>man was and made him search the entire house looking for him even
though my husband</b>
<br><b>insisted that only three people came and he didn't see an elderly
man. This really upset me</b>
<br><b>and to this day I cannot explain it, he was very quiet and let his
wife do all the talking.</b>
<br><b>When I gave birth a few years earlier to my first daughter we were
living in a flat and one</b>
<br><b>morning when she was a few weeks old I opened my eyes upon waking
and the whole of my</b>
<br><b>head was surrounded in a kind of fog, so dense I couldn't see through
it at all. After closing my</b>
<br><b>eyes and looking again it was still there, in confusion I wasn't
sure what to do, so I closed my</b>
<br><b>eyes again only to find it had vanished.</b>
<br><b>Presently where we live I occasionally see sightings of a man, at
least I assume its a man</b>
<br><b>because he won't reveal himself, I just think he must be shy. Usually
its just a glimpse of a foot</b>
<br><b>at the top of the stairs, although the other day he dashed into
our small bedroom while I was making</b>
<br><b>the beds and I saw him as I turned around. My son has seen other
sightings. We do not normally</b>
<br><b>discuss these sightings or talk about ghosts in general, but I often
wonder about them and what</b>
<br><b>they mean.</b>

<p><b>Ghostly Happening</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: haidee@thot.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi Dave:&nbsp; Many years ago we had invited an elderly uncle into
our home because he was alone and ill in the town hotel.&nbsp; We also
gave room to his longtime friend Ol' Pup who was milky eyed and rheumatic.&nbsp;
Uncle became more ill and the doctor said he was in the last stages of
heart failure and sent him to the hospital.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; About 3 days later I was home alone reading and suddenly
I felt like someone was watching me.&nbsp; I looked up and what was even
weirder, Ol' Pup raised his head, wagged his tail, gave a joyful little
yip and acted as if someone was patting his head.&nbsp; His eyes were clear
and shiny for just a moment.&nbsp; Then he sank down and whined for a moment
and I also felt as if the room was now empty.&nbsp; Within a half hour
my mother arrived to say my uncle had passed away in the hosp but then
Ol' Pup and I already knew that as my uncle had already been there to say
goodbye.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Hope you find this little tale of interest</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghosts and My Life</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: carolinec@aiglon.ch</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My name is Caroline, I'm half english half usa. All my life i have
been</b>
<br><b>seeing ghosts it has become part of my daily life. here are a few
of my</b>
<br><b>experiences with them:</b>
<br><b>The first time I ever saw a ghost was when i was 3 years old, i
still have</b>
<br><b>very vivid memories of it, this was when i still lived in England
in a place</b>
<br><b>called Letherhead ( its near London) we lived in a converted pub
from the</b>
<br><b>16th century. There was this huge mirror outside my bedroom on the
hallway</b>
<br><b>on the second floor. i had just come from eating supper (thats dinner
to you</b>
<br><b>guys) and was going to my room to go to sleep for the night, anyways
as i</b>
<br><b>looked into the mirror i saw a boy that was a few years older than
me, he</b>
<br><b>was smiling at me in the mirror, he was dressed in rags and was
really</b>
<br><b>dirty. not guessing that this was something people would be scared
of i</b>
<br><b>smiled back, i saw him from then on at the same time every night
and would</b>
<br><b>feel his presence in my room sometimes. I still feel it now.</b>
<br><b>My second experiences were right here in the house i am in now,
the first</b>
<br><b>one was at 6 in the morning, i was going off to a swimm meet and
was waiting</b>
<br><b>for a friend by the stairs, a girl came walking down the stairs,
she was</b>
<br><b>dressed in a long white nighdress and had long dark hair, when she
reached</b>
<br><b>me she looked up and smiled and wished me good luck, still being
tired and</b>
<br><b>somewhat dazed i smiled back and thanked her. a few seconds later
i</b>
<br><b>recovered and thought that i had never seen her before in my life
i went</b>
<br><b>down the stairs to the main floor and looked aroung there was no
one there,</b>
<br><b>the second one in this house was quite scary,at about 2 in the morning
i</b>
<br><b>woke up suddenly and sat upright, i looked around the room and saw
the door</b>
<br><b>was open when i got up to close it i saw a "thing" there is no other
way to</b>
<br><b>describe it, it was on the floor on all fours its head was angled
and it was</b>
<br><b>looking straight at me it face was twisted and horrible, least to
saw i</b>
<br><b>quickly jumped into bed and turned away from it hoping it would
go away.</b>
<br><b>I see them all the time, my mother and father too, i hope you find
use in my</b>
<br><b>experiences to continue your studies.</b>

<p><b>Ghost Everywhere</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Elke_Eastaugh@hines.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Ever since I was a little girl, I have had contact with spirits.&nbsp;
No matter</b>
<br><b>where I've gone, they've been around; my mother thinks I'm psychic.&nbsp;
I know</b>
<br><b>from my grandmother that when I was a little girl I would say "strange"</b>
<br><b>things, and for a time I said so many "strange" things that my mother
kept</b>
<br><b>a diary of them!&nbsp; She burned it in the mid 1980's, apparently
I'd said some</b>
<br><b>things she didn't want to remember - she still won't talk to me
about them.</b>
<br><b>The only things that I remember myself are the death and violent
acts</b>
<br><b>predictions that stopped when I was in high school.&nbsp; I used
to wake up and</b>
<br><b>tell my mom and dad that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; something
horrible was going to happen, and</b>
<br><b>it always did - the assassinations of John Lennon, Anwar Sadat,
Lord</b>
<br><b>Mountbatten; the shootings of the Pope and Ronald Reagan; and the</b>
<br><b>Challenger disaster were some of the more memorable experiences.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>apparently cried for two days before they found the Jonestown cult
dead in</b>
<br><b>the jungle.</b>
<br><b>The first encounter with a ghost that I remember is when I was about
6</b>
<br><b>years old.&nbsp; We were in a drugstore in Bowling Green, Ohio,
and I saw my</b>
<br><b>grandfather a couple of aisles away!&nbsp; I ran over to see him,
and gave him a</b>
<br><b>big hug; he told me he loved me, and to tell my father that he loved
him</b>
<br><b>too.&nbsp; My mom called my name, very angrily, and I ran back to
her and told</b>
<br><b>her to come quick, Grandpa Sten was there!&nbsp; She told me that
he couldn't</b>
<br><b>be, he was in Louisiana.&nbsp; I was adamant that he was there,
and my parents</b>
<br><b>got really annoyed with me.&nbsp; They started treating me differently
the next</b>
<br><b>day, though - after I went to bed that night, my uncle called my
dad to</b>
<br><b>tell them that Grandpa had had a heart attack on the kitchen floor
that</b>
<br><b>afternoon, alone, and died.</b>
<br><b>A couple of years later we moved into a new-ish townhouse in La
Crosse,</b>
<br><b>Wisconsin.&nbsp; As far as I know, they were pretty average places
with no bad</b>
<br><b>history.&nbsp; Not long after we moved in, SOMETHING started hanging
around me,</b>
<br><b>especially when I was alone, which was a lot since both my parents
worked.</b>
<br><b>I vividly recall this thing picking me up and taking me across rooms
and</b>
<br><b>even down stairs.&nbsp; It wasn't mean to me, it never hurt me at
all.&nbsp; As a</b>
<br><b>matter of fact, I got so used to it that I would tell it where to
take me!</b>
<br><b>I would stand at the top of the stairs and wait for it to float
me down.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>would sometimes even fly around the living room!&nbsp;&nbsp; One
day I came home to</b>
<br><b>find the whole living room full of flies - I mean literally hundreds
of</b>
<br><b>them!&nbsp; Shades of Amityville Horror!&nbsp; I was much to young
to have seen that</b>
<br><b>film, but I remember the flies - they were mating all over the living
room,</b>
<br><b>it was the strangest thing I've ever seen.&nbsp; I called my mother,
and she</b>
<br><b>came rushing home after yelling at me on the phone to stop lying
- she</b>
<br><b>freaked out when she saw what happened, and we moved out soon after
that.</b>
<br><b>There was a really creepy basement in that townhouse that I used
as my</b>
<br><b>playroom, and I think that there was something not so nice down
there - I</b>
<br><b>would be happily playing records down there, and suddenly come running
up</b>
<br><b>the stairs, scared to go back down.</b>
<br><b>We moved away from there, and not much happened to me from about
14 years</b>
<br><b>old til I was about 21; that's when I moved into my grandmother's
house in</b>
<br><b>Houston.&nbsp; Weird stuff happened there - I'd wake up and see
shadows in my</b>
<br><b>room, strange lights would fall from the ceiling to the floor, and
my</b>
<br><b>closet scared me to death!&nbsp; I had lots of dreams of devils
in the closet,</b>
<br><b>crouched up on the top shelf waiting to get me, but I never saw
one while I</b>
<br><b>was awake.&nbsp;&nbsp; The oddest thing that happened to me there
was a night I came</b>
<br><b>home late from work, and my grandfather was still awake.&nbsp; He
showed me that</b>
<br><b>they had just bought two hedgehogs (this was during the hedgehog
breeding</b>
<br><b>craze of the early 90's) and they were spending the night in a covered
box</b>
<br><b>in the garage.&nbsp; Fast forward a couple of hours, and I'm asleep
in a</b>
<br><b>Laz-e-boy in the living room, having fallen asleep watching TV.&nbsp;
Suddenly</b>
<br><b>SOMETHING with a commanding male voice shouted in my ear, GO LOOK
IN THE</b>
<br><b>GARAGE RIGHT NOW!&nbsp; I was scared to death, I jumped up and ran
into the</b>
<br><b>garage just in time to find one of the hedgehogs falling over the
side of</b>
<br><b>the box and onto the garage floor, with the other one right behind
it.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>put them back in and placed a weight on the lid so they couldn't
get out</b>
<br><b>again!&nbsp; My grandmother, who is very hard of hearing and sleeps
through</b>
<br><b>hurricanes, asked me the next morning if something had happened
with the</b>
<br><b>hedgehogs - I told her Yes and asked how she knew - she said she'd
heard a</b>
<br><b>loud male voice telling her to go look at the hedgehogs, but that
when she</b>
<br><b>was putting her robe on the voice told her to go back to bed, I
had taken</b>
<br><b>care of it!&nbsp; We have no idea who it was, but my grandfather
slept through</b>
<br><b>the whole thing.</b>
<br><b>Fast forward again to a rented house I shared with my now-husband
in</b>
<br><b>northwest Houston.&nbsp; I have no idea what had happened in this
house, but</b>
<br><b>from the moment we moved in I felt a very strong male spirit presence</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; I knew it was male because it liked to get into bed
with me and</b>
<br><b>snuggle up behind me while I was sleeping.&nbsp; It would wake me
up and scare</b>
<br><b>the hell out of me, because my fiance would be lying with his back
to me,</b>
<br><b>right in front of my face!&nbsp; The first time it happened I thought
it was a</b>
<br><b>prowler, and I screamed&nbsp; - my fiance woke up and found me curled
up in a</b>
<br><b>little ball!&nbsp; As soon as I had screamed the thing had disappeared.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>thought I was dreaming, but them it started getting into bed with
me while</b>
<br><b>I was awake - I could feel the sheets behind me moving, and then
it would</b>
<br><b>press itself up against my back.&nbsp; I would ask it to go away
and it would</b>
<br><b>disappear for a while.&nbsp; Then it started coming up behind me
while I was</b>
<br><b>cooking dinner; I would think it was my fiance coming to kiss me
on the</b>
<br><b>neck, but I would realize there were no hands or arms to go with
the</b>
<br><b>feelings.&nbsp; It got worse when my fiance would travel on business
- the</b>
<br><b>dining room lights would rattle, and I started inviting my sister
over to</b>
<br><b>keep me company, or I would go stay at my mothers house.&nbsp; Whatever
it was</b>
<br><b>would sometimes stand on the stairs and watch us - our parrot would
go</b>
<br><b>insane for a while, and then he would be fine; sometimes he would
attack an</b>
<br><b>unseen person, pecking and flapping at SOMETHING that we couldn't
see.</b>
<br><b>After one particularly close encounter while I was lying awake in
bed, I</b>
<br><b>finally stood in the dining room and told whatever he was that he
was</b>
<br><b>scaring me, and that I wasn't whoever he thought I was, and I would
be most</b>
<br><b>appreciative if he would PLEASE leave me alone for good.&nbsp; The
dining room</b>
<br><b>light started to sway slightly, and then it stopped.&nbsp; I never
had another</b>
<br><b>problem.&nbsp; After we moved out, I asked the landlady if anyone
had died in</b>
<br><b>the house that she knew of - she said that her husband had died
there only</b>
<br><b>3 years before!&nbsp; She and I have very similar builds and are
both blondes -</b>
<br><b>I wondered if the spirit thought I was his wife.</b>
<br><b>We don't seem to have any spirits in our current house, although
I still</b>
<br><b>have the occasional run in with a ghost when I travel - just two
weeks ago</b>
<br><b>I was in Scotland with my husband, and we had a ghost in two of
our hotel</b>
<br><b>rooms.&nbsp; They were pretty funny, they seemed to just want us
to acknowledge</b>
<br><b>their presence, and when we did they left us alone.</b>
<br><b>Luckily, I haven't had any run ins with any malevolent spirits lately
- I</b>
<br><b>hope it stays that way!&nbsp; Thanks for reading my story, weird
as it may be.</b>
<br><b>I'm going to submit some wedding photos as well, so you can see
all the</b>
<br><b>orbs at our reception (I think they're my father!)</b>

<br><b>Ghosts in My Childhood Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Wookette19@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just found your website a few days
ago and I wanted to tell you</b>
<br><b>about my experiences.&nbsp; For 18 years, I'm 19 now, I lived in
a town in</b>
<br><b>Massachusetts.&nbsp; My house was only about 50 years old but the
land was a part</b>
<br><b>of the farm, in fact we have found old farming equipment in the
ground.&nbsp; Well</b>
<br><b>anyway my first experience was when I was about 4 or 5 years old.&nbsp;
My brother</b>
<br><b>and I were playing with some of his toy cars when he had to go to
the</b>
<br><b>bathroom.&nbsp; As I was sitting there playing with the cars I happened
to look</b>
<br><b>into the kitchen and I saw an elderly woman in a dress float across
the</b>
<br><b>kitchen into the cabinets.&nbsp; I ran to the other room where she
should have</b>
<br><b>come out but she didn't.&nbsp; For some reason I don't remember
really being</b>
<br><b>scared.&nbsp; My next experience was a little more freaky.&nbsp;
It was Christmas Eve</b>
<br><b>and it was around 2 or 3 in the morning.&nbsp; Being only around
9 or 10 I was</b>
<br><b>very excited about Christmas.&nbsp; Anyway, I turned to my door
and I saw an old</b>
<br><b>man in my doorway.&nbsp; I thought at first it was my grandfather
but then I</b>
<br><b>realized my grandfather was at my uncle's that night.&nbsp; Anyway
the spirit was</b>
<br><b>wearing a farmers outfit.&nbsp; The overalls and a hat.&nbsp; He
looked at me and it</b>
<br><b>almost looked like he was sad.&nbsp; He motioned for me to follow
him I was too</b>
<br><b>scared and I just shook my head no.&nbsp; He looked sad maybe even
worried but he</b>
<br><b>just turned and walked away.&nbsp; That was the most a spirit has
really</b>
<br><b>interacted with me.&nbsp; The next time I was living upsatirs and
I had my cousin</b>
<br><b>over.&nbsp; We both woke up around the same time which was odd all
in of itself.</b>
<br><b>ANd we looked over to my wall and we saw 2 shadows on my wall kneeling</b>
<br><b>looking like they were praying.&nbsp; The weird thing is that our
shadows weren't</b>
<br><b>anywhere.&nbsp; And I didn't have anything in my room that could
have made a</b>
<br><b>shadow of let alone 2 human shadows praying.&nbsp; The last memorable
experience I</b>
<br><b>have is of a couple of years ago.&nbsp; I had to get ready for school
but school</b>
<br><b>started really early and I was grumbling to myself about having
to wake up</b>
<br><b>and get out of bed.&nbsp; All of a sudden my door opened right up.&nbsp;
I jumped out</b>
<br><b>oof bed and said "Ok Ok I'm up I'm up."&nbsp; THe spirits in my
house really never</b>
<br><b>seemed to want to harm me.&nbsp; My friends and I think that I remind
the spirits</b>
<br><b>of a granddaughter or daughter thaat died and they try to protect
me.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>don't know if it's true or not because I'm the only one in my immediate</b>
<br><b>family who has had these experiences.&nbsp; Any advice might be
helpful.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Michelle.Robertson@gfsinc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am 23 now. As a child in our home. My mother, younger sister and
I have witnessed a few sightings in our home. We have never recorded them,
but we believe since we have all seen the same one. Also one time these
people came and told my mom that there were a presence of Dominican preachers
in our home. My mom went and blessed all the rooms.</b>
<br><b>When my younger sister was a baby, she was ill and asleep in the
bed where my mom and dad were sleeping. My mother was awakened by a presence
and she opened her eyes to see what looked like the grim reaper. She has
seen it another time since then.</b>
<br><b>My sister and I were always affraid to be in my parents room or
to pass by it. It was like we sensed something that we didn't want to be
a part of.</b>
<br><b>When we were about eight or ten we saw the ghost for the first time.
It was a shadow the size of a young child. It would pass from one room
to another. We never caught a sight of this while in the rooms but only
if we were at the other end of the hallway.</b>
<br><b>Also in our own rooms we have experienced different things. Things
being moved from where we left them. And a face that would always peer
at us from within the closet. All the little things that make you so scared
to get out of bed.</b>
<br><b>Now that my sister and I have moved and we are years older. We live
in a house together and have experienced some things where we are currently
renting.</b>
<br><b>On our home we have security gates and a security alarm which goes
off when a door or window is opened in the house. One day my sister and
her husband had left to go to the store. I was still lying in bed, and
I heard all the locks on the door unlock, and the beep from the alarm that
the door was opened. I looked out the window. There were no cars in the
driveway. I then walked into the living room to find nobody there. And
that the locks werent unlocked, it was just as if it were just locked.
It was frightening.</b>
<br><b>We have also witnessed some noises and occurances in one of the
rooms in the house. The television has come on and no one was in the room,
the volume starts low but ends up at high volume. I have also heard noises
coming from that room like someone was hammering something. I had the only
hammer at the house in my hand and as soom as I opened the door it quit.</b>

<br><b>Beach Story</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;One time me and my family stayed in a house on the beach in
Lincoln City, Oregon. Well one time me and my sisters and one of my cousins
found this secret door in the closet in the room that we stayed in. Once
we found it we went inside the secret room.When we were up there we heard
some knocking under us. (because we were upstairs) We went down stairs
and nobody was there. We went back upstairs to the secret room and the
knocking came back. We went down stairs again and we found two footsteps
on the bed.</b>
<br><b>My dad and aunt had something happen to them too.&nbsp; My aunt
and my dad were staying in the same house by themselves in the winter.&nbsp;
In the middle of the night my aunt heard my dad talking in the living room.&nbsp;
After a while she got up to see what he was doing.&nbsp; She heard the
voice as she went around the corner but when she got into the living room,
no one was there and my dad was sound asleep in his room.&nbsp; The next
night my dad heard the drawers in the kitchen being opened and closed.&nbsp;
Then he heard the noise in the bathroom.&nbsp; When he got up to see what
the noise was it stopped and no one was there.&nbsp; My aunt was sound
asleep in her room.&nbsp; We know of two other people that have had strange

<p><b>Grandma's Ghost?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: markandcharlotte@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>From 1996 to 1997, during a span of about a year and a half, I lived
with my aunt and uncle, who are siblings, in my Grandmother's house, which
was the house they grew up in with my mother who is the eldest of them.&nbsp;
My Grandmother died in 1989 of cancer, when I was about 12, and my Grandfather
had remarried by the time I took up residence there, but lived elsewhere
with his new wife. They lived only a few months in the house, but my grandfather's
wife was always complaining that she felt as if she were competing with
my grandmother's ghost all the time.&nbsp; I am pretty sure she meant that
figuratively, but maybe she sensed something and did not realize it.&nbsp;
My aunt is a nurse, and my uncle was a cross country truck driver at the
time, and I ended up spending a lot of time alone at home.&nbsp; The home
is a large tri-level ranch style built in the mid sixties, with four bedrooms,
2.5 baths, laundry room, two fireplaces, with the garage and laundry room
on the lowest level. The long main part has the four bedrooms--two on each
side of a long hall which terminates in a bathroom at the end of the house.&nbsp;
The hall is in a direct line of sight of the flight of stairs that leads
to the top floor of the house where the family room, kitchen, dining room
and den are.&nbsp; This is where the story really starts.</b>
<br><b>I was not living at my grandmother's house when the activity first
started.&nbsp; I was visiting my aunts and uncle for the weekend.&nbsp;
My other aunt, the second eldest, was living there with her children, who
were about four and two at the time. We were all sitting upstairs in the
family room watching TV when the two year old, who had been looking down
the stairs into the hall suddenly asked, "Mommy, who is that lady?"&nbsp;
My aunt got this stricken look on her face, and slowly turned her head
to look where my cousin was pointing, but she saw nothing.&nbsp; We had
all stopped talking, because there was no one in the house but the six
of us, and my aunt asked my cousin to tell us what the lady looked like.&nbsp;
To our shock, my two year old cousin described a woman that sounded like
my grandmother--a woman that had died years before she was born. And without
prompting, she told us that the lady walked down the hall, looked into
my uncle's room, and then went into the master bedroom.&nbsp; Nobody but
my little cousin saw anything. Of course, we hadn't been paying attention.</b>
<br><b>Later that night, after my aunt and I had put the children to bed,
we were back upstairs, and my aunt told us that her husband had seen my
grandmother's ghost two weeks earlier.&nbsp; He had been going down the
stairs into the hall and had seen exactly what my cousin saw.&nbsp; He
had been the only one in the house at the time, and the experience, in
his words, had "scared the crap" out of him. He knew immediately what he
saw. That is the reason my aunt looked so upset at what my cousin had said.&nbsp;
Her husband had told no one but her what he had seen, and they had agreed
not to say anything about it because they had not wanted to frighten the
children. This was the first indication that anyone had had that my grandmother
was checking up on us.</b>
<br><b>Now, during the time I lived there, I slept in the master bedroom,
where my grandmother had spent most of her illness.&nbsp; In fact, I slept
in the same bed.&nbsp; She hadn't died there, though.&nbsp; I don't think
I could have stayed there if that were the case.&nbsp; I am as afraid of
the supernatural as I am fascinated by it.&nbsp; I know that sounds weird
but it's true.&nbsp; But back to the matter at hand.</b>
<br><b>When I moved in my aunt told me that first night to leave the door
of my grandmother's closet ajar and keep the light on.&nbsp; I instantly
remembered the events that had occurred two years previously, and being
the coward that I am, I did not argue, only did as I was told.&nbsp; I
did not sleep well that first night, but noticed nothing.&nbsp; It was
not until a week later that I, still with the closet light on, could hear
the sound of the coat hangers in that closet clacking and shifting around.&nbsp;
I assure you, I was frightened!&nbsp; As I said before, when it comes to
the supernatural, I haven't got much courage. I could not get up for fear
of what I might encounter.&nbsp; I pulled the covers over my head and eventually
fell asleep.</b>
<br><b>This scenario happened many, many times over the next year and a
half.&nbsp; Four to five nights a week, I would hear the hangers in grandma's
closet banging around.&nbsp; When I told my father, he said it sounded
cool (He would. He prides himself on not being afraid of anything).&nbsp;
So he came over and sat in the closet for several hours.&nbsp; He saw nothing.&nbsp;
However, when he came out of the closet to talk to me, and this time he
shut the door, several minutes later we both heard the sound of the coat
hangers shaking.&nbsp; I looked at him and he looked at me and he went
over and opened the closet door.&nbsp; I held my breath.&nbsp; But when
the door opened, we both saw the hangers swaying slightly.&nbsp; It was
so weird.&nbsp; At least he believed me.&nbsp; I never felt threatened
though.&nbsp; I was just scared of seeing something I really didn't want
to experience.&nbsp; The coat hangers were enough for me, thank you!</b>
<br><b>I know this is not really scary, except to me and my relatives who
were there, but this is the only experience I've had that can be corroborated&nbsp;
by several people, so I thought it was worth sharing.&nbsp; Thanks for
taking the time to read this.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Growing Up With Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: martialman_1@netzero.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am intrigued so far about this site. Here is my true story. I grew
up in a small NJ town in Mercer Co. called Pennington. This town was on
the cusp of leaving its' agricultural roots when my family first moved
there in the early 1960's. We moved into an old two story farmhouse built
in the early 1800's. Even as a small child I could "feel" energy or prescences
in the house...sometimes just an uneasy feeling, sometimes cold spots,
but also incidents. Incidents included dogs looking up at the ceiling and
cowering and whimpering while running from certain rooms on occasions;
dog adamantly refusing to go up the staircase into the attic even when
being beckoned by a family member at the top of stairs and encouragement
from family member standing with dog at bottom of the stairs...dog would
look up at the top of the staircase, whimper, take one or two steps, then
back down and often run downstairs. Other happenings included books flying
off of bookshelf, stamping feet going up and down the stairs, knocking
on closed bedroom doors, turning of doorknobs, heavy wooden doors swinging
open, heavy curtains blowing in the room on a breezeless day, chairs rocking,
sightins of black cat and black raven in the house when we had neither,
lights flickering on and off, ect. I hope this offers enough of a flavor
of my childhood haunted house.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Leggygirl00@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was about 9, I lived in a big two story house in my current

<br><b>in illinois.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had found out from my mom that
a older man had died in that</b>

some of the weird</b>
<br><b>happenings I am going to tell you about.&nbsp; All of this is real.</b>
<br><b>If you sat in our living room, to the right of you was our kitchen,

would come</b>
<br><b>back down the stairs and go back into the kitchen.</b>
<br><b>In our bedrooms, our music boxes would play by themselves.&nbsp;

<br><b>One night, my sister actually had her fan fly off the desk and land

<p><b>Haunted House Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sburke152@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in Topeka, Kansas. In the late 70s I took a job babysitting
for a fellow nurse friend of my mother. She had the graveyard shift which
is appropriate because her house was near the Rochester Cemetery, one of
the grounds for sightings of the famous Albino Lady ghost figure. From
the beginning she offered her bedroom as a place for me to sleep but I
always said I'd just sleep on the couch. This went on for a few months.
The reason she needed a sitter was because she was going through a divorce.
She asked me testify on her behalf as to her psychological condition the
months I sat for her because her husband was asking for sole custody of
the children accusing her of having Delusions of Grandeur. I agreed and
took the stand and answered the questions of both lawyers. She won her
case and was allowed to keep the children with full custody. Now she still
insisted I sleep in her room every night and getting fed up with her plying
and fed up with my foolish misgivings I did it. Everything seemed like
it was ok and I fell asleep. The next thing I remember was waking up with
my eyes still closed. Waking up so much that I was not the least bit drowsy
but something was wrong and I knew it. I felt someone was there but I also
told myself I was being ridiculous. I went back and forth a few times debating
on whether to open my eyes or just stay frozen like that not knowing until
someone came. So I decided to do it and get it over with and disspell my
crazy imagination so I opened my eyes. Right up close in front of my face
was a hand with fingers splayed out of a normal size and there was nothing
else in the way of a body part. I immediately closed my eyes and started
praying that I would make it through the night without more terror. Now
this is stranger than the hand that I saw and that was fast as my heart
was beating and pounding in my chest and with much labored breathing and
fright and not being able to believe what was happening to me I somehow
fell back asleep. I did not mention what happened to the nurse until some
months later but I stayed on the couch and never ever slept in her room
again. So finally I told her what happened to me and the look on her face
told me she wasn't surprised or unbelieving. Then she told&nbsp; me in
her room sometimes the walls would disappear and she would be able to see
all of her large backyard and that Jesus would come and talk to her. Well
after what happened to me I was not about to doubt her. Was it mean of
her to insist I sleep in her room knowing this all the while. Yes, I think
it was because it was after the divorce was final and there should have
been no reason to want me to know she had a valid cause for her Delusions.
Was it the Albino Lady's hand, I don't know but it was white. I will never
set foot in that house again and I pray the people who live there now are
not frightened out of their wits, but I never had a problem when I slept
on the couch after that incident happened it was only that room and the
girl's bedroom upstairs which I will convey at another time. Yes, I stayed
on for several months more because I felt sorry for her situation, she
didn't have any friends that came over to her house the entire year and
a half I sat for her and she was bitter about the divorce and in a lot
of mental pain. I know she saw some strange things in her room and was
not making them up just for attention. Maybe she just wanted someone to
believe her and that's why she wanted me in her room without warning me
for if she did she knew I would never go in there for any amount of nudging.

<p><b>Haunted Theater</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MORG244@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I used to work at an old movie theater in San Francisco.&nbsp; It
still stands</b>
<br><b>there but is now a banquet hall.&nbsp; I worked there in my first
year at college</b>
<br><b>until it was sold to some yuppies and was renovated.&nbsp; It was
called the</b>
<br><b>Regency 1 and it was a single screen theater that took up a whole
block on</b>
<br><b>Van Ness.&nbsp; It was about 4 stories high and has 3 floors below.&nbsp;
On the second</b>
<br><b>floor was an old Masonic club of some sort that performed strange
theater</b>
<br><b>plays.&nbsp; The third floor was an old dance hall with extremely
old toilets,</b>
<br><b>they said "John Company."&nbsp; Which I was told that's how the
name for a toilet</b>
<br><b>is also a "John."&nbsp; And the top floor had a cathedral, which
was pretty much</b>
<br><b>closed because we had to use a small spiral staircase to enter it.&nbsp;
It was</b>
<br><b>complete with huge wooden chairs, a pipe organ and stained glass.&nbsp;
The First</b>
<br><b>bottom floor had a huge fan room in it in which was soiled with
about 100</b>
<br><b>dead pigeons.&nbsp; Every night, someone had to turn it off by flipping
a huge</b>
<br><b>Frankenstein switch.&nbsp; We didn't take turns, we did rock paper
scissors. (I</b>
<br><b>usually made my girlfriend come with me).&nbsp; And the last floor
contained a</b>
<br><b>ballroom that extremely resembled the "Golden Room" from the Shining.</b>
<br><b>Everything in this whole place was original, the rope barriers,
the couches,</b>
<br><b>the balconies, the curtains and carpets.&nbsp; The boss was an ancient
woman named</b>
<br><b>Pearl Stimmel.&nbsp; She always had her Chihuahua named Chibi walking
after her.</b>
<br><b>She told me that 3 people were killed in the theater since she's
been working</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; One woman fell from the balcony while trying to get
her friends</b>
<br><b>attention.&nbsp; A woman fell down these really steep iron stairs
that lead from</b>
<br><b>the back of the screen and a man was beaten to death in the bathroom
during</b>
<br><b>the movie "Jesus Christ Superstar."&nbsp; Everybody including me
has seen things.</b>
<br><b>Shadows walking on the balconies, I would walk up thinking it was
people</b>
<br><b>sneaking up to have sex and there would be nobody there.&nbsp; Walking
into the</b>
<br><b>screen room and there would be dust flying everywhere...I would
tell my boss</b>
<br><b>and she pointed out that the chandeliers were swinging back and
forth.&nbsp; These</b>
<br><b>things were from the 20's and were huge.&nbsp; I don't believe that
a small</b>
<br><b>earthquake could do that without us feeling it.&nbsp; There was
a knot in the wood</b>
<br><b>on the back of one of the bathroom stall doors that looked like
a man.&nbsp; And</b>
<br><b>we used to find really old things on the tables in the lobby in
the morning,</b>
<br><b>like a rocky keychain from the 70's, Stamps and dollar bills from
the 40's</b>
<br><b>and the coolest one was a box of cigarettes with a tax stamp from
1921. It</b>
<br><b>think it was either ghosts or roaches.&nbsp; I would like an e-mail
from anyone</b>
<br><b>who had been to this place and had experienced anything.&nbsp; There's
a lot more</b>
<br><b>to tell about this place but I have to walk my dog.&nbsp; I would
also like to see</b>
<br><b>a group of investigators check that place out.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: butterflyanw@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>To begin with, I have always been somewhat "gifted", ever since I
was</b>
<br><b>little. Let me say I have never seen an apparition, but I do have
unusual</b>
<br><b>dreams. I will get a slight headache that gets worse and worse,
until I am</b>
<br><b>forced to lie down and sleep just to get away from it (and being
a college</b>
<br><b>student it kind of hampers the social life). When I dream I will
have vivid</b>
<br><b>dreams, sometimes of places and people I have never seen or known.
When I</b>
<br><b>wake up I find out my dream has come true. Two examples for you
: 1) I</b>
<br><b>dreamt about the Oklahoma City bombing 2 weeks before it happened,
and</b>
<br><b>being little then (only 13) the children crying disturbed me greatly,
and</b>
<br><b>2) I dreamed my uncle would have to go to the Gulf War, and he did,
exactly</b>
<br><b>as I dreamed it.</b>
<br><b>I also have had dreams of ghosts, and even though I cannot see them
awake,</b>
<br><b>they are quite vivid and seem real in my dreams...</b>
<br><b>I am working on developing my talents, and I now do some tarot and
readings</b>
<br><b>(mostly just for friends, and ALWAYS for free) and I belong to a
ghost</b>
<br><b>investigation team.</b>
<br><b>Just a little background for you...Now on to my house. I live in
a "normal"</b>
<br><b>ranch style home in Michigan, that is haunted. We (my mother, stepfather,</b>
<br><b>and I) hear strange footsteps coming up from the basement, through
the</b>
<br><b>hall, and stopping right outside my bedroom door. The floor creaks
so I</b>
<br><b>always know if someone (even the dog) is outside my door. There
are noises</b>
<br><b>almost every night that sound as if someone is breaking in to the
house,</b>
<br><b>but whenever we go to check,there is no one there.</b>
<br><b>We will leave to go out to dinner or something, and come home with
every</b>
<br><b>light on in the house (and you would have to know my parents to
know that</b>
<br><b>NEVER would happen). There are taps on my window (and the guest
bedroom</b>
<br><b>window) at night, with no one there.</b>
<br><b>The worst (maybe scariest ) incident was last summer (June 2000).
My family</b>
<br><b>and I have noticed that the noises are the most frequent in June,
July, and</b>
<br><b>August, tapering off in the fall, and are completely gone by early</b>
<br><b>December, only to return again every summer.</b>
<br><b>I was lying in my room, trying to fall asleep with another one of
my</b>
<br><b>strange headaches. This one was so bad I was practically in tears.
I</b>
<br><b>finally had drifted off into sleep when I heard a THUD and felt
my bed</b>
<br><b>shake slightly. Jumping up (as I was alone in the house) I opened
my door</b>
<br><b>and went to go investigate the noise (taking my dog with me, of
course).</b>
<br><b>The hallway was clear, and then I heard a STOMP, STOMP STOMP and
then a</b>
<br><b>dragging noise coming from the stairs leading down&nbsp; into our
basement. It</b>
<br><b>sounded like the kitchen windows were shattering, with a breaking
noise and</b>
<br><b>then the sound of glass falling on the floor. I was standing in
the</b>
<br><b>kitchen, and not a window was broken. I stood there in the middle
of the</b>
<br><b>kitchen trying to calm down (I had read that fear antogonizes ghosts)
and</b>
<br><b>refused to move. The last straw was when I heard a faint whispering
in my</b>
<br><b>right ear. I whipped around and nothing was there. That was it!
I ran into</b>
<br><b>my bedroom with my dog and called my boyfriend. I put him on speakerphone</b>
<br><b>so he could hear the stomping outside my door. After it stopped
(about 2</b>
<br><b>hours later) I finally drifted off to sleep. That morning (it was
like 4 am</b>
<br><b>when I finally went to sleep again) I had a strange dream. I dreamed
about</b>
<br><b>a man with glowing skin like parchment and eerie gray eyes who was
wearing</b>
<br><b>black gloves, and a plaid shirt and torn up jeans. I SAW him (in
my dream)</b>
<br><b>dragging a body of a woman (I think but I can't tell b/c I can only
see the</b>
<br><b>head and the legs) up my basement stairs and then dragging her through
the</b>
<br><b>kitchen into the bathroom, where he was sawing at her with a hacksaw
and</b>
<br><b>washing her in the water...It seems like I was standing in the doorway
to</b>
<br><b>my bedroom watching, and as i watched in horror, he turned and smiled
at</b>
<br><b>me. The next thing I remember is waking up in my bed, drenched in
sweat,</b>
<br><b>with my dog trembling in bed next to me.</b>
<br><b>I told my mom and my step-dad the next day, and we tried to research
it at</b>
<br><b>the library. The problem is, the city I live in was undeveloped
forest with</b>
<br><b>cabins dotted throughout the land all the way until about the 1960's,
so it</b>
<br><b>can't really be traced who he was.</b>
<br><b>I am convinced, though, that what i saw was real. Ever since my
dream, I</b>
<br><b>have had a bunch of other strange dreams about the same man, and
he still</b>
<br><b>pulls the same pranks, plus new ones.</b>
<br><b>On a side note, when I went to my friends' mom the other day for
a reading</b>
<br><b>(she is Lebanese, and does tarot, palms, and aura readings) she
asked me</b>
<br><b>who the man was standing behind me. When I loked puzzled she explained
to</b>
<br><b>me she saw a man standing behind me in a plaid shirt and gloves
with gray</b>
<br><b>eyes. She said she kept getting the name "Arthur" and that he was
a very</b>
<br><b>bad man, very wild and nasty. She said he had attached himself to
me b/c I</b>
<br><b>looked like his sister, and b/c i was more "attuned" to the spirit
world</b>
<br><b>than others.</b>
<br><b>I'll keep you posted and let you know what goes on in the future,
b/c as of</b>
<br><b>today, May 31, 2001, I still hear the noises and still have the
dreams....</b><b></b>

<p><b>Many Signs of Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: the_goddess_bastet@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I read of your personal experience with ghosts and I have one
to share</b>
<br><b>which terrifies me still.&nbsp; My house is/was haunted.&nbsp; There
are footsteps,</b>
<br><b>voices which sound muted and far away as if they are being funneled</b>
<br><b>through something.&nbsp; And I have had grim experiences with black
figures</b>
<br><b>which scurry animal-like across the floor and another entity which
it</b>
<br><b>seems is harmful/evil.&nbsp; At first I thought I was imagining
it all, and</b>
<br><b>then when I met my fiance and invited him over to my house he confirmed</b>
<br><b>what I was feeling.&nbsp; Being somewhat mystical, religious, and
possessing a</b>
<br><b>kind of psychic connection that is not as strong as my own, my fiance</b>
<br><b>told me that he felt as though there were several presences in and
around</b>
<br><b>my house, one of which may be harmful or evil.&nbsp; My fiance practiced
wicca</b>
<br><b>for a while, and is a deeply spiritual person.&nbsp; He has told
me to tell</b>
<br><b>the forces that they are "unwelcome" and that only God, angels,
positive</b>
<br><b>spirits are welcome here.&nbsp; My fiance says that if it isn't
invited then</b>
<br><b>it can't come in--those are the rules.&nbsp; He also put a kind
of protection</b>
<br><b>around myself and my house.&nbsp; Since then, most all of the experiences
have</b>
<br><b>gone, but my fiance says that he still feels very uneasy in my house
as</b>
<br><b>do I.&nbsp; Even though I have the ability to say YOU'RE NOT WELCOME,
STAY</b>
<br><b>OUT, I still feel as if certain spirits/demons (whatever they may
be)</b>
<br><b>want to hang around.&nbsp; I've considered having my house blessed
by a priest</b>
<br><b>but I'm not catholic and I'm afraid I might be viewed as "eccentric"

<br><b>Mini Haunt</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By:Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>Your site is very well done and extremely fascinating.&nbsp; I have
a mini story and a few questions, if you can help me out.</b>
<br><b>I just moved into a basement apartment last year and have often
sensed some kind of "presence".&nbsp; At first, I would just shrug it off,
thinking it was my nerves.&nbsp; But in March, I started experiencing some
relatively freaky stuff.&nbsp; I pretty much knew we had a ghost, but never
said it out loud really.</b>
<br><b>I was asleep one morning when all of a sudden I felt myself falling
into some kind of trance.&nbsp; I was wide awake, but couldn't open my
eyes.&nbsp; I found myself in my parents' home, in the basement.&nbsp;
(I live in Toronto, they live out in Ottawa) I looked over to the staircase
and saw a young man sitting on the stairs.&nbsp; I never saw him before
in my life but immediately knew it was "the ghost from my apartment".&nbsp;
I sensed that he wanted to say something and I was majorly freaked out,
so I ran away.&nbsp; (I have always been able to control my situations
in dreams, like running away, or grabbing a weapon for protection.&nbsp;
Don't ask! :)&nbsp; I woke up wondering what it was all about.</b>
<br><b>Exactly a week later, I was sleeping and again, found myself falling
into the trance.&nbsp; This time, I was in my roommate's bedroom, except
it was furnished differently.&nbsp; I noticed a brown wooden dresser with
an intricate design in green wood.&nbsp; Next to it stood a young man with
dark hair.&nbsp; I knew it was the same guy from the other dream and he
wanted to talk.&nbsp; Again, I freaked out and woke myself up.&nbsp; I
went and talked to my roommate about it.&nbsp; He said that he woke up
that morning (around the same time I had the dream) and saw a shadow cross
over his bed.&nbsp; Freaky, huh?&nbsp; He wasn't going to tell me about
it for fear I would think he was nuts.</b>
<br><b>Then, a month or so later, I found myself for the third time, falling
into a trance, and I saw the brown and green dresser.&nbsp; I was accepting
this time, and was willing to hear the "spirit" out.&nbsp; However, I lost
the dream and woke up.</b>
<br><b>I was talking to my housemate a week or so later.&nbsp; She brought
the matter up, saying that the girls who used to live in my apartment,
now live on the 3rd floor.&nbsp; They have often asked her if she ever
met the ghost.&nbsp; They said it was a young, good looking man.&nbsp;
He sometimes goes up to the 3rd floor and appears to them.&nbsp; Keep in
mind, I never spoke of my experience to these people, and never told anyone
that I knew our ghost was male.</b>
<br><b>I have yet to see him when I'm not sleeping.&nbsp; Other things
have happened, subtle things.&nbsp; I was once very sad, in bed, and I
felt someone holding my hand, and this warm feeling ran through me.&nbsp;
Perhaps it was just my imagination.</b>
<br><b>Anyways, sorry to ramble on so much! :)&nbsp; I'm just wondering
if ghosts are known to act that way.&nbsp; He hasn't tried to contact me
since, and I kind of want him to, now that I'm not so afraid to listen.&nbsp;
I know some people have had weird dreams involving ghosts, but I'm wondering
how wise it would be to actually say "I'm ready to see you now, Mr Ghost"?&nbsp;
I guess I'm just curious now, since he went to so much trouble to rob me
of my sleep before!&nbsp; I'm thinking that he's harmless, but it would
be best to leave it alone, because it's never good to mess with the supernatural.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Apartments May be Haunted</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Mommy2Makenzie@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Apartments Oshtemo, Michigan, I believe are haunted. I</b>
<br><b>lived there for my first 18 years of life. I've had things happen
to me, and</b>
<br><b>to neighbors. That's why I believe it's the apartments in whole.
I've been</b>
<br><b>upstairs in my room, alone in the house, and I'd hear women talking</b>
<br><b>downstairs. I'd go downstairs thinking it was my mom, nobody was
there,</b>
<br><b>nothing was on. I've been woken up out of my sleep to something
pulling my</b>
<br><b>sheet off and it being on the floor, I'd go to pick it up, something
would</b>
<br><b>hold the sheet down. My mother has woke up to feeling a presence,
and not</b>
<br><b>been able to move or speak, and barely open her eyes, and see a
male figure</b>
<br><b>(she believed to be her brother who had recently died) standing
at her</b>
<br><b>bedroom doorway. Neighbors have spoke of things too. One told me
that one day</b>
<br><b>she and her infant daughter were alone in their apartment, only
a candle</b>
<br><b>burning in the living room. These apartments have sliding glass
doors, and</b>
<br><b>hers broke from the inside . . . although nothing hit it. The outside
pane</b>
<br><b>was still in tact. Another time in that same apartment, she and
her husband</b>
<br><b>were in the living room, their front door was locked. It slammed
open,</b>
<br><b>although nobody was there. I've been in a lot of these apartments
in this</b>
<br><b>complex, and could feel a presence in just about every single one.
These are</b>
<br><b>just some of the stories that stick out more.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Helen</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Nomad122@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hello. I've bean reading the stories which other visitors to The
Shadowlands</b>
<br><b>have posted and have decided to share my own experiences, which
in retrospect</b>
<br><b>are downright amusing (but still eerie). Both my parents are believers
in the</b>
<br><b>spirit world, so I guess that's why I am more open to these experiences
than</b>
<br><b>some. When I was a kid I used to sit up at night and beg my dad
to tell me</b>
<br><b>ghost stories- he's had more than a few encounters of his own. However,
I</b>
<br><b>consider myself a rational person not easily spooked and approach
stories of</b>
<br><b>the supernatural with a healthy dose of skepticism. With that in
mind, I'll</b>
<br><b>tell you about my experiences last year. I am a college student
originally</b>
<br><b>from Florida but going to school in VA, and last summer I decided
to stay in</b>
<br><b>VA to work instead of going home. I rented a bedroom in a house
outside the</b>
<br><b>small town of Montpelier, VA, about 20 miles west on Route 33 from
Richmond.</b>
<br><b>The house was a two-bedroom cottage with no indoor shower- there
was an</b>
<br><b>outside enclosed camp shower by the back porch. Anyway, I shared
the house</b>
<br><b>for three months with my current roommate, and we both had numerous</b>
<br><b>unexplainable experiences there. We often heard unusual noises-
footsteps,</b>
<br><b>etc- or had a feeling of presence, particularly in the bedrooms.
When lying</b>
<br><b>on the couch in the living room, reading (usually when I was alone,
but my</b>
<br><b>roommate was frequently gone anyway), I would hear human sounds-
a man and a</b>
<br><b>woman talking in low voices, a child giggle, a woman laugh, a man
cough-</b>
<br><b>coming from my roommate's bedroom, on the other side of the wall.
No</b>
<br><b>television other than the one in the living room, no radio, and
the area is</b>
<br><b>very rural, so it is doubtful these sounds could have carried from
even the</b>
<br><b>closest neighbors. The landlady and her husband lived next door,
but they</b>
<br><b>were usually away or asleep when these things happened, and their
house was</b>
<br><b>on the other side of the property anyway. At the time I didn't have
a bed, so</b>
<br><b>I was sleeping in a sleeping bag on the floor of my room and had
plugged my</b>
<br><b>alarm clock into the outlet on the wall next to me. On several occassions
I</b>
<br><b>woke up to discover I was late to work because my alarm clock was
either</b>
<br><b>completely unplugged or blinking as if it had been unplugged and
plugged back</b>
<br><b>in- could have been a power surge, but all the other clocks in the
house were</b>
<br><b>fine, and the house was so small that most of it ran off one circuit.</b>
<br><b>Thinking to put a stop to this (maybe I had unplugged it in my sleep?)
I</b>
<br><b>moved the clock to the other side of the room, where I couldn't
possibly</b>
<br><b>reach it except to turn it off. I found it unplugged again the next
morning</b>
<br><b>and on several occassions after that. Well, about this time I heard
from the</b>
<br><b>landlady, via my roommate, that the house was supposedly haunted
by a ghost</b>
<br><b>named Helen, a previous owener of the house who had raised a family
of seven</b>
<br><b>children there decades before. Helen liked to play tricks on the
tenants to</b>
<br><b>make her presence known. Mind you, I hadn't told my roommate about
any of the</b>
<br><b>things I had experienced because I didn't want to seem crazy. I
told her</b>
<br><b>then, and she told me she had also been hearing things in the house
when I</b>
<br><b>was out, although Helen's practical jokes seemed focused me for
a while. She</b>
<br><b>also dropped a kick-knack on my head once from the shelf above the
back door-</b>
<br><b>I was standing looking out the window and happened to look up at
the shelf</b>
<br><b>when this ceramic thing came crashing down and hit me square between
the</b>
<br><b>eyes. It didn't hurt (much) but it certainly stunned me. I know
very well</b>
<br><b>this object had not been close to the edge, because a few hours
before I had</b>
<br><b>moved it back from the edge where it had mysteriously and gradually
slid over</b>
<br><b>the past few days (from the door vibrations, I thought, even though
nothing</b>
<br><b>else on the shelf had moved). No one had been out the door since
I moved it</b>
<br><b>back, so that can't account for how it suddenly fell on me. Anyway,
I guess</b>
<br><b>Helen just didn't like that particular knick-knack. When my roommate
had told</b>
<br><b>me about the supposed haunting, she'd mentioned that the ghost liked
to "run</b>
<br><b>on the rafters". I didn't understand what she meant at the time
and put it</b>
<br><b>out of mind until one night, almost a month later I was trying to
go to sleep</b>
<br><b>and I heard a very strange noise in the hall, quite unlike any normal</b>
<br><b>house-settling sounds. It sounded almost like a small dog pattering
up and</b>
<br><b>down the hall between my room and the living room, except there
was no sound</b>
<br><b>of toenails clicking on the hardwood floor. My roommate has a small
dog, but</b>
<br><b>she swears that the dog was in her room and asleep all night, and
I never</b>
<br><b>heard her bedroom door open (the doors are very squeaky, and her
room was</b>
<br><b>right next to mine). Anyway, the steps sounded like they came up
to my door</b>
<br><b>and retreated to the living room at least a dozen times, but they
never</b>
<br><b>passed my doorway and, being too petrified to go look for myself,
I never saw</b>
<br><b>anything. Later I talked to the landlady myself about it, and she
laughed an</b>
<br><b>told me that it was Helen "running on the rafters" (even though
it sounded</b>
<br><b>very much like it was coming from the floor). I never heard it again.
Anyway,</b>
<br><b>aside from the oddness inside the house itself, the woods surrounding
the</b>
<br><b>house had a "strange" feel. I always felt horribly naked and unprotected
when</b>
<br><b>walking up the path to the front door, like something was watching
and</b>
<br><b>waiting in the shadows of the woods on my right. I often heard strange</b>
<br><b>noises- sometimes almost like moaning, sometimes unidentifiable
animal</b>
<br><b>noises- coming from them. Taking a shower (outside, remember) after
dark was</b>
<br><b>always an ordeal. My roommate and I would actually sit on the porch
and</b>
<br><b>"stand watch" while the other was in the shower. Once while doing
this I</b>
<br><b>heard a sound like young children laughing and talking in the woods
behind</b>
<br><b>me, and this was at 11 pm. What kids would be out in the woods that
late? And</b>
<br><b>we didn't have any nearby neighbors on that side. I think part of
it was just</b>
<br><b>the heebie-jeebies from the woods being dark and spooky, but I'm
sure of what</b>
<br><b>I heard and felt. Some weeks later my roommate and I got brave and
decided to</b>
<br><b>explore the woods at night and face our fears. We went out with
flashlights</b>
<br><b>and explored as much as we could without getting lost. Didn't see
anything</b>
<br><b>but a lot of old, rusted-out stoves and paint cans and unusually
dead and</b>
<br><b>bare trees (it was the middle of summer) but I swear I heard footsteps
in the</b>
<br><b>leaves behind me; when I told my roommate to stop because I heard
something,</b>
<br><b>they continued for a split second and stopped. Well anyway, the
landlady said</b>
<br><b>she when she acquired this property the cottage was all overgrown
with woods</b>
<br><b>and the house itself was in a shambles- hadn't been lived in in
decades. The</b>
<br><b>cottage was originally 3 or 4 tiny bedrooms, but she tore down the
walls to</b>
<br><b>make a larger living room and 2 larger bedrooms and completely remodeled
the</b>
<br><b>place to make it rentable. My theory is that doing this disturbed
whatever</b>
<br><b>spirits or residual energies inhabited the place and made "Helen"
(who may</b>
<br><b>not have been the only spririt there) more active, and eager to
make it known</b>
<br><b>to the living residents that she was still there. Plenty of other
strange</b>
<br><b>things happened- noises, shadows from the corner of my eye, objects
being</b>
<br><b>moved- but after a while it became so commonplace that I stopped
taking</b>
<br><b>special note. I actually talked to Helen sometimes, when she was
doing</b>
<br><b>something especially irritating (like the thing with the clock),
and I think</b>
<br><b>she listened and eventually respected my right to live there too.
In the last</b>
<br><b>month or so I lived there, she didn't make much of a stir. It was
almost</b>
<br><b>disappointing, because having her around, asserting her presence,
was fun and</b>
<br><b>challenging in a way, but I guess by that time she had come to accept
us as</b>
<br><b>we accepted her. One thing is for certain- Helen made a believer
out of me!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Come on Over to My House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lala1@citlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have a true story to tell. If anyone thinks that it is fake, then
let them come to my house. Anyway, I was walking along in my house a while
ago and happened to look at the screen door.(It was night and I was home
alone.) I saw a figure standing there looking at me. It was way darker
than the night outside. I slowly moved over to the knife rack and picked
up the sharpest one. But my eyes must have left the screen for one second
because it wasn't there anymore. Then, about a couple of days later, I
was just about to fall asleep and I heard something. I put the covers away
from my ears and tilted them up to hear better. The noises I heard was
voices of some little girls. They sounded like they were coming through
the wall, which is my brothers room. I sat up, thinking that my brother
snuck out and was talking to one of his girlfriends. But there was no boys
voice and the voices were distant. They were saying this:</b>
<br><b>"Cousin! Where are you? Does she still live here?" The last question
seemed to be aimed at another girl, who sounded older.</b>
<br><b>"She should. Do you think that she'll remember us? Hey! I wonder.
Is that her?" I think that they were talking about me.</b>
<br><b>"No that's not her. That's someone else in her bed. Man! I want
my cousin!" I heard a different voice cry, getting fainter and fainter
as it started sobbing.</b>
<br><b>By that time I was wide awake and a little scared. The next thing
that would happen would scare me half to death. I was looking at my poster
on my wall as I thought that they had left. In the very dim kitchen light,
I saw something white sitting on top of it. I got out of bed, I have no
idea how and why, and slowly walked to my poster. Staring at it, I saw
that it looked like a really small person. By then I was freaked! I had
to put my hand on my mouth to keep from screaming! Then the tiny person
left as I crawled back to my bed. Just when I was about to fall asleep
again I heard a tiny voice in my ear. It said:</b>
<br><b>"Don't be afraid. We're not&nbsp; here to hurt you." Then I felt
warm and fell asleep instantly.</b>

<br><b>2 Years of Being Spooked</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Dixie090186@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we first moved in
I felt uneasy about the whole thing.&nbsp; Not really</b>
<br><b>uneasy like scared.&nbsp; I don't know it is hard to explain. You
feel like</b>
<br><b>someone is here with you, and you look back and around to see if
someone is</b>
<br><b>there, but no one is.&nbsp; Well, when we first moved into the house,
we'd lived</b>
<br><b>here probably about 6 months.&nbsp; My brother and dad were gone
to baseball</b>
<br><b>practice and my mother and I were here at home.&nbsp; My mother
was cooking dinner</b>
<br><b>in the kitchen and I was in my room doing homework.&nbsp; I got
that feeling, like</b>
<br><b>someone was there with me, and I looked up.&nbsp; Everything was
quite and no one</b>
<br><b>was around.&nbsp; Soon as I looked up, something, sounding like
it was right in my</b>
<br><b>ear said my name "CARRIE."&nbsp; It was a whisper, but one of the
loud sharp</b>
<br><b>whispers, like it was trying to get my attention.&nbsp; I sort of
freaked me out,</b>
<br><b>so I left my bed room.&nbsp; Well, nothing else happened again until
one night</b>
<br><b>when I was laying in bed.&nbsp; My bedroom door was open.&nbsp;
All the lights in the</b>
<br><b>house were out except the bathroom.&nbsp; We have a floor heater
in our house that</b>
<br><b>is in the middle of the hall way.&nbsp; When someone steps on it,
it goes down and</b>
<br><b>you can hear it.&nbsp; It makes a rather loud boom sound.&nbsp;
Well, my bedroom door</b>
<br><b>was open and I woke up.&nbsp; The house was silent and everyone
was in bed. I</b>
<br><b>could see into the hall from here I laid, and I heard something
in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen.&nbsp; You know when people wake up, and walk, and they
are still tired,</b>
<br><b>and when they walk their feet drag across the floor making a sound?&nbsp;
Well,</b>
<br><b>that's what I heard.&nbsp; It just was silent, and then I heard
it on the tile</b>
<br><b>floor in the kitchen.&nbsp; Then I heard the footsteps fade unto
the carpet in the</b>
<br><b>living room.&nbsp; Seeming it was getting louder and closer, then
it was right in</b>
<br><b>front of my room.&nbsp; It sounded like someone was walking right
through the hall</b>
<br><b>way.&nbsp; Even the heater went down and made that boom.&nbsp; But
the thing is, no one</b>
<br><b>was there.&nbsp; I could see into the hallway.&nbsp; The hall wasn't
even dark because</b>
<br><b>of the light shining in from the bathroom.&nbsp; No one was there,
but something</b>
<br><b>was making footsteps.&nbsp; Then, they faded on into my brother's
room where he</b>
<br><b>was asleep and the house grew silent again.&nbsp; I laid in bed....thinking.."what</b>
<br><b>in the world was that?!"&nbsp; It was the strangest feeling.&nbsp;
Then about 5 minutes</b>
<br><b>later, my brother left his room and came to me and said, "Carrie,
is it all</b>
<br><b>right if I stay in here and sleep with you tonight?"&nbsp; I told
him yes, but I</b>
<br><b>didn't ask anything about it.&nbsp; If he heard it to or anything.&nbsp;
He is a lot</b>
<br><b>younger than I am.&nbsp; The other night I was talking to my cousin
at my</b>
<br><b>grandmother's house and I told him in front of my brother that once
I heard</b>
<br><b>footsteps in my house late at night and my brother started crying.&nbsp;
(he is 9)</b>
<br><b>My grandmother told me not to talk about it anymore so I haven't.&nbsp;
But the</b>
<br><b>third time something has happened was late at night not too long
ago.&nbsp; About</b>
<br><b>8 months ago.&nbsp; My brother and I had switched rooms, and I now
had his bed</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; I woke up one night with a feeling like I wasn't alone.&nbsp;
It was such a</b>
<br><b>strong feeling.&nbsp; Very strong.&nbsp; I scared.&nbsp; It was
late again, and silent and I</b>
<br><b>was alone, and I heard something.&nbsp; It seemed to be coming from
the attic</b>
<br><b>above me maybe?&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; But it was above me.&nbsp;
It sounded like someone</b>
<br><b>had a rake in the attic and was scraping the rake across my ceiling.&nbsp;
I'd</b>
<br><b>wake up and it would do it a while longer and stop.&nbsp; I laid
there and decided</b>
<br><b>that I shouldn't be afraid.&nbsp; So, I tried to go to sleep, since
it had</b>
<br><b>stopped.&nbsp; When I went to sleep, I immediately got woken by
the same sounds.</b>
<br><b>Again I tried to sleep but was waken.&nbsp; This happened about
5 times.</b>
<br><b>Everytime I woke it would stop.&nbsp; I had gotten pretty scared,
and the feeling</b>
<br><b>was over welming and I felt like crying.&nbsp; But then I said....STOP....I
am</b>
<br><b>sleeping....Dont bother me...leave me alone.&nbsp; It quit, and
it didn't wake me</b>
<br><b>again.&nbsp; I have just told my mother about this.&nbsp; She hasn't
had anything</b>
<br><b>happen to her.&nbsp; Things have only happened to me.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Chicago Chills</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DorothyBiron@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I lived in a haunted house in Chicago, Illinois for 11 years, and
this was</b>
<br><b>one of many of the frightening experiences that happened to me,
. We moved</b>
<br><b>into this house when I was 9 years old and we were only the second
family to</b>
<br><b>live in it.</b>
<br><b>I awoke one very hot summer night to the hissing and growling of
my very</b>
<br><b>pregnate Calico cat who slept next to me all year long. We were
sleeping in</b>
<br><b>my parents bedroom, and as my cat started growling and howling I
felt someone</b>
<br><b>take my mattress and give it a violent shake it was so hard that
I remember</b>
<br><b>my cat's howls sounding choppy from the sudden shaking motion and
at the same</b>
<br><b>instant I felt a large hand wrap around my wrist and squeeze.The
odd thing</b>
<br><b>was that even though I felt the impression of a large hand there
was no</b>
<br><b>substance, you know skin for one thing!!!!</b>
<br><b>I know that the two events were happening at the same time although
even in</b>
<br><b>trying to relate this story it sounds weird. As quickly as the grabbing
of my</b>
<br><b>wrist and the mattress shaking started it ended, but not before
I was able to</b>
<br><b>scream for my mom who still believes me and was witness to seeing
our very</b>
<br><b>lazy and fat cat move as if her tail was on fire out of the room
. As soon as</b>
<br><b>my mom and dad made it into the room who ever was there left.</b>
<br><b>I left home ten years later but I never slept in that room again.
As a</b>
<br><b>footnote my folks sold the house when I left and the lady that is
still</b>
<br><b>living there to this day is even afraid to mention the events that
have</b>
<br><b>happened to her because she feels that it makes the house mad. I
for one</b>
<br><b>believe her !!</b>
