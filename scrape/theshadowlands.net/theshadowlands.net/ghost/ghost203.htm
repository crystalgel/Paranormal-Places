<br><b>Wooded</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Kisses3506@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I would like to share with you some things that happened to me when
I was</b>
<br><b>younger living in my parents home. Im not sure if it would be trully</b>
<br><b>considered a "haunting" but I believe that there was some sort of
spirit</b>
<br><b>activity in that house and after a breif stay in that house in recent
months</b>
<br><b>I still believe that there is somthing in that house.</b>
<br><b>When I was about 5 years old my mother, father and I moved into
a house that</b>
<br><b>we had built. The area was wooded and had never been developed in
recent</b>
<br><b>history. We had to clear out the trees to build there.</b>
<br><b>I dont remeber much about my younger child hood in that home. Everything
was</b>
<br><b>pretty normal. The only thing I remeber was this feeling of never
being</b>
<br><b>alone. No matter what I always felt like there was another presence
with me,</b>
<br><b>as a child I remeber that at night I would sleep with a nigth light
and the</b>
<br><b>covers over my head because I felt some one was watching me and
I was scared</b>
<br><b>I would wake up and see them.</b>
<br><b>As I grew up this sense of being watched never left me. As a teen
a few</b>
<br><b>things happened to me that scared me terribly. One of the things
that</b>
<br><b>bothered me was the way my pets acted especially in my room. My
cat would sit</b>
<br><b>on my bed and stare up at the ceiling as if she was watching somthing
move</b>
<br><b>around my room, however there was nothing ever there. Both my dog
and cats</b>
<br><b>where also often drawn for some reason to the celler door. One day
while baby</b>
<br><b>sitting a couple neighbors children my 2 cats and my 2 dogs all
sat at the</b>
<br><b>celler door just staring at it. No one was down there and there
was no way</b>
<br><b>anything could have gotten down there from outside. I had this sudden
sense</b>
<br><b>of panic come over me and the kids did also. SOmthing about the
way the</b>
<br><b>animals where acting just was not right. I took the children and
ran from the</b>
<br><b>house to my grand mothers down the road and my grandfather came
to my house</b>
<br><b>and found nothing in the house.</b>
<br><b>Another incedent happened one night when I was having a sleep over
with a</b>
<br><b>couple friends. We had stayed up late and where lying there talking
in the</b>
<br><b>dark. For some reason I looked over at the window and when I did
I saw what</b>
<br><b>looked like the image of a face, just the face though no body. The
face was</b>
<br><b>kind of white and blurry. I&nbsp; asked my friend if she could see
it also but</b>
<br><b>when she looked it was gone. We all got scared and decided it was
time to</b>
<br><b>cover up and go to sleep FAST!</b>
<br><b>My last and final and most disturbing incedent I can recall happened
when I</b>
<br><b>was about 16. My friend (who was living with me at the time) was
on the</b>
<br><b>telephone in another room with her boyfriend. I was standing near
my dresser</b>
<br><b>doing my hair. Suddenly this white thing flew past me. I could feel
the air</b>
<br><b>near me move and it felt like the object touched me. I turned to
look and see</b>
<br><b>what my friend had thrown at me but she was still in the other room
on the</b>
<br><b>phone.&nbsp; I looked all over to find what se had thrown but I
could find nothing</b>
<br><b>that would even slightly resemble what I saw. I asked her if she
had thrown</b>
<br><b>anything at me and she said no. I beleieved her and we both got
very nervous.</b>
<br><b>Another thing that happened to me was things would just apear or
fall from</b>
<br><b>no where. Usually small odd things like coins, screws, little chips
of wood,</b>
<br><b>and other small things. It seemed like they would usually just fall
from</b>
<br><b>above. And no there was no place for them to come from. I would
also find</b>
<br><b>small things in my room moved from where I kept them.</b>
<br><b>After the thing flew by my head I became very upset and that is
when I</b>
<br><b>talked to my mother about it. My mother was a very dedicated christian
and</b>
<br><b>she told me to remove anything from my room that I thought had bad
spirits</b>
<br><b>connected to it and she and anotehr very religious woman brought
a bible in</b>
<br><b>my room and prayed over it that the spirits would leave and let
me have</b>
<br><b>peace. It seemed like it worked a little but I still never had an
easy</b>
<br><b>feelign as long as I was in that house. I returned to live at&nbsp;
my moms house</b>
<br><b>this past fall and the house still had a creepy uneasy feeling to
it. I still</b>
<br><b>had that feeling of not being alone in that house.</b>
<br><b>So I dont know if this is all coinsidence, a young mind playing
tricks or</b>
<br><b>somthing else, but to me it was some sort of spirit at work. Thank
you for</b>
<br><b>listening to my story.</b>

<br><b>Window Monsters</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LGodzilla1@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi</b>
<br><b>I'll say my name is "J" for now;I am ten years old and my mom is
typing this</b>
<br><b>for me.</b>
<br><b>A few months ago I was in bed supposedly sleeping, when I heard
a very,very</b>
<br><b>light tapping on my window;My windows face the front porch of our
home so I</b>
<br><b>hear a lot of things happening at night.&nbsp; Anyway,I heard the
light tapping,so</b>
<br><b>I just ignored it for a while since I thought it was maybe a branch
from the</b>
<br><b>tree in our front yard.&nbsp; A little</b>
<br><b>while later I heard knocking on my windowl. I looked outside (again)
to see</b>
<br><b>if it was a branch from the tree but the tree branches were blowing
in the</b>
<br><b>opposite direction.</b>
<br><b>So, I went back to bed and tried to go to sleep again when I heard
even</b>
<br><b>louder and harder knocking on my window.&nbsp; This time I just
ignored it and</b>
<br><b>tried to go to sleep.</b>
<br><b>Then I heard a light pounding on my window.&nbsp; Now I was really
scared,but I</b>
<br><b>did not get out of bed to tell my mom (She would just say it was
the wind)I</b>
<br><b>stayed in bed,</b>
<br><b>ignored it the best I could and finally fell asleep.&nbsp; I did
not sleep very</b>
<br><b>well needless to say until I heard my daddy come home from work.
So,this is</b>
<br><b>my story.Anybody want to offer any suggestions/comments??Thanks
for listening.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Whispering</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Twistedcndycane@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in an old house and I used to be home alone and hear voices
and</b>
<br><b>whispering down stairs and then this happend a few months ago. I
was sitting</b>
<br><b>in my room and my cat was walking in when I notice he stopped and
stared at a</b>
<br><b>corner. He started to back up and wouldn't go past the corner. When
I went to</b>
<br><b>pick him up and bring him into my room he freaked out. Days after&nbsp;
he would</b>
<br><b>still stare at the corner and run into my room quickly.</b>
<br><b>On day I home from school and sat on my bed. I asked for a sign
from the</b>
<br><b>ghost, that it was still there. I then heard a loud thud like some
banged on</b>
<br><b>the wall so I called my friend. While I was talking to her I was
walking down</b>
<br><b>the stairs. On the wall there was a muddy child's hand print. It
was a</b>
<br><b>perfect print (not smudged or anything). I was told my friend I
would call</b>
<br><b>her back and washed the handprint off the wall. Later I tried bringing
my cat</b>
<br><b>into my room and he started freaking out again and when I put him
down he</b>
<br><b>stared at the corner. I sat on my bed again and said aloud, "If
you are still</b>
<br><b>here, and I think you are, please stop scaring my cat!" the next
day my cat</b>
<br><b>walked in and out of my room ignoring the corner.</b>
<br><b>Since then I haven't seen&nbsp; or heard anything from the ghost
since.</b><b></b>

<br><b>When I was a Child</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Dreemweever@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I lived in this apartment house (we owned) and lived on the second
floor. I</b>
<br><b>always had a very uncomfortable feeling in this house and still
do to this</b>
<br><b>day when I drive by.</b>
<br><b>When I was a child and I would be asleep I would feel someone tap
me on my</b>
<br><b>shoulder and it would awaken me. This went on for years. I didn't
let it</b>
<br><b>bother me until I got older. I decided one night after it stopped
happening</b>
<br><b>for a while that if it happened again I would wake up quickly and
look to see</b>
<br><b>who it was. I had a feeling it would be my brother playing a joke
on me, it</b>
<br><b>wasn't.</b>
<br><b>I felt that tapping and turned around very quickly to see an energy
field of</b>
<br><b>a night in armor. Just standing there looking at me.</b>
<br><b>That energy field (I didn't know that was what it was until recently)
stayed</b>
<br><b>there in front of me for about 3 minutes then slowly evaporated.</b>
<br><b>I wasn't afraid at all. After that it stopped happening.</b>
<br><b>More things happened in that house. That's the only story I would
like to</b>
<br><b>share for now. I have many more.</b>

<p><b>What do you Think?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: alexxross@juno.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My wife and I went to
visit my father-in-law at this house in</b>
<br><b>Valrico, Florida.&nbsp; We stayed the night in one of his guest
rooms.&nbsp; In the</b>
<br><b>middle of the night, while I was sleeping, I felt the pressure on
someone</b>
<br><b>next to me at the edge of the bed and felt a hand stroke my head.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>didn't get scared because I figured it was my wife that maybe couldn't</b>
<br><b>sleep.&nbsp; I woke up while this was happening so I know I was
not dreaming.</b>
<br><b>The door of the bedroom was locked. I was very aware of my surrounings</b>
<br><b>since I am a very light sleeper.&nbsp; Turning over I saw that my
wife was</b>
<br><b>still sound asleep who on the contrary is a heavy sleeper.&nbsp;
I then got</b>
<br><b>scared and put the covers over my head and waited until I fell asleep.</b>
<br><b>The next day we asked my wife's father if anyone had died in the
house</b>
<br><b>and he said it was a brand new house and they were the first people
to</b>
<br><b>live there.&nbsp; This is my first experience of anything like this.&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>was younger, I would always have to cover my ears when in a dark
area of</b>
<br><b>any house that I am in because I would truly sense fear that something</b>
<br><b>was arround me or following me.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Figure in the Picture</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ambergodin@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>you may find this hard to believe,but my friend and i were taking
pictures of our goofy selves at my great grandmas house. we are 14 years
old so we are pretty goofy and decied to go in the attic. my great grams
attic is a little square door on the ceiling with a latch you need a broom
to pull on,and a little folding wooden ladder pops out. anyways. we climbed
up,and i always loved my grams attic,i loved climbing up into it. it was
something to do! so we went up and took a nice picture of us in front of
a pitch dark room for the heck of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few days later,we had
them developed.....</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;and what we saw on this picture still today makes me shiver.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well,lets see,we were lookig
at the pics and finally got to the one with us in the attic. to our horror,a
strange outline with a huge grin and beady eyes was in the picture emerging
from the pitch dark room.oh my god! i was so terrified when i saw its freaky
face!still. i will never go in the attic again because of..that thing..that
figure in the picture coming behind me and my friend.in fact the pic was
true evidence to people about the monster. my gram saw it and moved out
instantly! i am not kidding. we also ruined the picture becaues&nbsp; me
and my friend believed it had a curse on it!</b>

<p><b>Townhouse Spirit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Jewelrylady540@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>It's September, 1990, my husband and I had only been married a year,
and he</b>
<br><b>was out of town on business.&nbsp; We lived in a townhouse and had
just gotten a</b>
<br><b>new puppy to keep me company while he was gone.&nbsp; I was in our
kitchen making</b>
<br><b>some muffins and Beau was in there with me, when I heard this</b>
<br><b>"booonnnnngggggg" on my piano down the hall.&nbsp; A little nervous,
I peeked</b>
<br><b>around the corner to see what it was and Beau started to bark.&nbsp;
I didn't see</b>
<br><b>anything, so I just kind of blew it off and thought to myself that
some</b>
<br><b>little knick knack had fallen off the top of the piano.&nbsp; I
dismissed it for a</b>
<br><b>while, but after walking down the hall later, I noticed that nothing
had</b>
<br><b>fallen off.&nbsp; Also, if something had fallen, it would have hit
more than one</b>
<br><b>resounding note, right?&nbsp; Nothing else happened that night.</b>
<br><b>About a week later, my husband was home from a trip and we had gone
to bed.</b>
<br><b>About 3:00 am, he comes straight across me and points to our bedroom
door and</b>
<br><b>says, "Who are you?"&nbsp; Needless to say, I was frightened!!&nbsp;
I asked him what</b>
<br><b>he was talking about and he said that he had seen a woman in a blue
dress</b>
<br><b>with blonde hair standing in our doorway.&nbsp; He said he thought
that maybe he</b>
<br><b>was dreaming.</b>
<br><b>Throughout the next few weeks, our dog, Beau, would be sleeping
and would</b>
<br><b>suddenly wake up and go stand at the hallway and just bark and the
hair on</b>
<br><b>the back of his neck would stand straight up.&nbsp; We would get
up and go down</b>
<br><b>the hall and try to get him to come down there, but he never would.&nbsp;
A little</b>
<br><b>spooky to say the least.</b>
<br><b>Here's where it gets a little wierd.....in October of 1990, my husband
and I</b>
<br><b>were out at this bar that a friend of our had opened up.&nbsp; While
sitting</b>
<br><b>there, Andy introduced us to his partner, Roy.&nbsp; Well, Roy and
I started</b>
<br><b>talking and he looked at me and said, "You kissed the moose."&nbsp;
(This is a</b>
<br><b>whole other story, but in fact, on spring break while in college,
I had</b>
<br><b>actually had to kiss this stuffed moose on the wall in front of
this whole</b>
<br><b>bar!!).&nbsp; I looked at Roy and said, "What?"&nbsp; He repeated
himself and I asked</b>
<br><b>how he knew about that.&nbsp; He said that he had been tested at
a very well-known</b>
<br><b>parapsychology department and was somewhat psychic.&nbsp; He looked
at me and</b>
<br><b>said, "You have a spirit in your house."&nbsp; Well, needless to
say, that got my</b>
<br><b>attention!!&nbsp; He said that her name was Susan or Susie and that
she was</b>
<br><b>harmless.&nbsp; Then changed his mind and told me not to trust her.&nbsp;
This freaked</b>
<br><b>me out a little.&nbsp; He said that our townhouse had actually been
built over</b>
<br><b>some old roads and that there was an accident there and a young
woman had</b>
<br><b>been killed.&nbsp; I told him about the things that had happened
recently and he</b>
<br><b>told me that she would probably do something big and then be gone.&nbsp;
On the</b>
<br><b>way home, I was telling this to my husband and we were both kind
of looking</b>
<br><b>over our shoulder until we got into bed.&nbsp; Nothing happened
that night.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>next morning, my husband went downstairs to let Beau out and I heard
him say,</b>
<br><b>"Oh my gosh!!!"&nbsp; I went running downstairs and when I got there,
there were</b>
<br><b>spices all over the floor in our kitchen.&nbsp; We kept our spices
in a corner</b>
<br><b>cabinet on a lazy susan and guess what?&nbsp; The door to the cabinet
was closed!!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;We never experienced anything again after that.</b>
<br><b>Here is the strangest part of the story.........one night before
I graduated</b>
<br><b>from college, a bunch of us got together because we wanted to try
the Ouija</b>
<br><b>board.&nbsp; I never believed anything about this, but when the
little piece</b>
<br><b>started to move, I had a very strange feeling.&nbsp; One of the
girls' mother was</b>
<br><b>an astrologist and warned Kim not to participate because she said
that you</b>
<br><b>never know what kind of spirit you will let enter into this world.&nbsp;
Of</b>
<br><b>course, we didn't listen!!&nbsp; Anyway, the piece just kept on
going in a circle,</b>
<br><b>the "leader" asked if the spirit was upset with someone in the room.&nbsp;
It went</b>
<br><b>to "Yes."&nbsp; She asked who it was and it spelled out "B-R-O-O-K,"
which is my</b>
<br><b>name minus the "E".&nbsp; Needless to say, it scared me to death!!&nbsp;
Guess what the</b>
<br><b>spirit's name was?&nbsp; Susan........</b>

<p><b>This is Our Story</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
hi there,my name is Tom and i have a story for you ,I and my family had
just moved from one town down south to a town up north looking for work.
we had lived in a small apartment at first then we moved to a trailer near
the edge of town when things at first seemed normal,but quickly turned
wierd i had bought a dog for the kids for company as there was not many
people living right near us the girls age,so i thought that id have him
for company.Things were awesome until our dog would sit and freak by the
hallway in the trailer ,our kids seen cups sliding across the counters
and hear strange sounds by the bedroom doors.we could hear shuffling in
the kitchen when it was bed time you could hear cupboard doors and utensils
being used from time to time we could hear our kids talking like they were
scared when we asked what it was they replied they had seen someone walking
towards them down the hallway me and my wife could see shadows across the
door like as if some one was in our house.We knew that it was an entity
of some sort and contiplated moving but was in hopes that it would leave
us in peace and not harm us. Until one night after the children had went
to bed my wife and i were relaxing on the couch watching some show on t/v
when she replyed to me tom did you hear that i said what and i had said
to her you go and look ok.She laughed and said forget you go so i sat up
teasing her to go when i turned and looked down the hallway i seen a shadowy
figure staring right threw me it seemed i saw his whole body shape his
arms on his side and his head off to the side as if looking around our
indoor fire place it sent shivers threw me instantly. i was choked at this
point alls i could do was get mad at it i yelled ill burn this home to
the ground if you freak me or my kids again.the next morning i had a bite
mark on my leg that was visible to everyone you could make out his teeth
with the bruises on me i was doubtful that the entity had did this but
my wife was certain it was. things were quiet after that night for awhile
until one saturday morning when i was in my bed asleep well at that almost
asleep stage my wife was in the kitchen doing kitchen things and i was
tired so i layed down when i was almost asleep i had heard a mans voice
say hey,tom just like that hey,tom i awoke realizing i was having a conversation
with some one i yelled to my wife whos there but she replied no one baby
whats wrong i told her and she was amazed with my story this is all true
and theres much more that had happened but he was not really a mean ghost
he just wanted me to know he was there and was real.after i had threatened
to move the spirit was really nice&nbsp; meaning quiet and respectful but
when we would try and find out what had happened to him our phone would
go dead and leave us with nothing but curious so our land lord sold the
trailer and we left i think that it stayed there cause nothing else happened
after that......i think any ways lol this story is true and was quite an
experience especially when i never believed in the super natural much before
but im a believer now man thats for sure thank you for your time and believe
it or not i seen and heard him since.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The White Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: fboily@sympatico.ca</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have had lots of experiences with the paranormal in my life and
this</b>
<br><b>is my first one.&nbsp; I must have been 15 or 16 at the time.&nbsp;
I was living</b>
<br><b>with my parents and my older brother in a relatively big house by
the</b>
<br><b>St. Lawrence River (I come from the province of Quebec in Canada).&nbsp;
One</b>
<br><b>night, I happened to be alone in the house, my parents and brother
were</b>
<br><b>out.&nbsp; I was in the dining room doing my homework.&nbsp; At
one point, nature</b>
<br><b>called and I had to go to the bathroom.&nbsp; To get to the bathroom
I had to</b>
<br><b>cross the kitchen which was right beside the dining room.&nbsp;
When I came</b>
<br><b>back from the bathroom, I had a most amazing sight.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well, right in</b>
<br><b>between the dining room and the living room was standing this large
and</b>
<br><b>tall white shadow.&nbsp; It was the typical ghost (as portrayed
by</b>
<br><b>cartoonists), that is, white, transparent and shapeless (it had
a round</b>
<br><b>shape, but no legs or arms).&nbsp; It was very tall, it must have
been over</b>
<br><b>six feet.&nbsp; I was so surprised that I just stood there looking
at it.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>looked up and gazed at what seemed like its head.&nbsp; Then it
bowed its</b>
<br><b>head towards me.&nbsp; It was actually bowing down towards me!&nbsp;
It was then</b>
<br><b>that I started freaking out.&nbsp; I ran to my bedroom and my heart
was</b>
<br><b>pounding like crazy.&nbsp; I never saw or heard anything else in
that house</b>
<br><b>afterwards.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for reading my story.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Unexplainable Night</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Lovelynhot@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Ever since I could remember, I have always known that I am not ever
really</b>
<br><b>alone.&nbsp; I would see shadows and other unexplainable things.&nbsp;
As I got older</b>
<br><b>thing would happen more and more.&nbsp; See the figures better,
became able to</b>
<br><b>hear and speak to some of them. A few friends would be telling me
about</b>
<br><b>someone they knew who had died and the spirit of the person would
be there</b>
<br><b>with me as they talked.&nbsp; Also, the dreams started.&nbsp; I
would have dreams of</b>
<br><b>something horrific was going to happen to either a friend of mine,
or to</b>
<br><b>someone that was in my wide circle of friends. I was even attacked
by an evil</b>
<br><b>spirit.&nbsp; The evil and demonic happenings didn't start until
my younger sister</b>
<br><b>came heavy into devil worshipping.</b>
<br><b>One night my friend asked me if I wanted to come over and stay there
for the</b>
<br><b>night to get away from my two out of control nephews.&nbsp; Needing
a night away</b>
<br><b>from all the screaming, I took him up on the offer.&nbsp; So I packed
up my</b>
<br><b>daughter and was on my way.</b>
<br><b>After laid my daughter down to sleep in the living room we went
into the</b>
<br><b>bedroom.&nbsp; We were laying on the bed talking when we both felt
something enter</b>
<br><b>our bodies and leave.</b>
<br><b>Then other spirits came, many of them as a matter of fact.&nbsp;
It was if we were</b>
<br><b>in some kind of gateway, but we weren't.&nbsp; I could see them,
but I could not</b>
<br><b>hear them, even though they could hear me.</b>
<br><b>For some strange reason a light had to be on in order to protect
my daughter.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I could sense that there was some kind of fight going on the
balcony out</b>
<br><b>side the bedroom window.&nbsp; This really freaked me out seeing
how my daughter,</b>
<br><b>who was still in the living room sleeping right next to the door
leading out</b>
<br><b>to balcony.&nbsp; I knew who one of the spirits was.&nbsp; The thing
from my dreams.</b>
<br><b>Each time I would have dream of something terrible is about to happen.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>would wake up to a cold chill in my room.&nbsp; A dark figure standing
in my room</b>
<br><b>looking at me and always left with a strange grin. Later I learned
the fight</b>
<br><b>was between that and a Guardian angel of mine, who just so happens
to be a</b>
<br><b>friend of mine that died in car accident some years before this.&nbsp;
What they</b>
<br><b>were fighting about I don't really know.&nbsp; All I know that it
had something to</b>
<br><b>do with my daughter.</b>
<br><b>Despite my every effort to move my daughter into the bedroom, I
was unable</b>
<br><b>to.&nbsp; I could hardly go check on her there was some kind of
force keeping from</b>
<br><b>doing so.&nbsp; Each time I went to go check on her.&nbsp; I had
to push my way from</b>
<br><b>the force keeping me from doing so.</b>
<br><b>Each time I would check on her there was no evil in the room or
around her.</b>
<br><b>It was outside and in the bedroom with my friend and I.&nbsp; Also,
There would</b>
<br><b>always be a circle of spirits standing in circle around her.&nbsp;
A few looking</b>
<br><b>at her and few looking elsewhere as to see who or what was coming.&nbsp;
They</b>
<br><b>wouldn't stop me from going to her.&nbsp; They would move to let
me in and then</b>
<br><b>circle the two of us.&nbsp; Even though more then life its self.&nbsp;
I wanted to be</b>
<br><b>near her while all of this was going on, I felt that she was safer
were she</b>
<br><b>was.&nbsp; The spirits around were protecting her.</b>
<br><b>So many spirits were there that night.&nbsp; More of them had no
real purpose to</b>
<br><b>being there.&nbsp; They just popped into see what was going one.&nbsp;
Ever since this</b>
<br><b>started I could see cloudy figure standing in the doorway of the
bedroom. He</b>
<br><b>was the explaining things to my friend.&nbsp; I could see the figures,
but not</b>
<br><b>hear them.&nbsp; My friend could hear them, but he couldn't see
them.&nbsp; Seeing how</b>
<br><b>I was unable to hear what any of them were saying, he would tell
what was</b>
<br><b>being said when I needed to know something. The spirit in the door
way was</b>
<br><b>some kind of teacher for my friend.&nbsp; Not a dead teacher from
the past, but</b>
<br><b>his teacher to the gift or power he found out that he was to gain
control of.</b>
<br><b>After almost a whole night of this, I was laying on the bed.&nbsp;
All of a sudden</b>
<br><b>I had strange feeling come over me.&nbsp; I can't explain it better
then it was</b>
<br><b>strange, heavy and as if I was leaving my body.&nbsp; I heard my
friend yell out</b>
<br><b>my name once and then everything went black.&nbsp; Then next thing
I knew I was</b>
<br><b>laying on the bed and my friend was on top of me.</b>
<br><b>My friend told me that he was talking to me when my eyes rolled
to the back</b>
<br><b>of my head, my body started to rise, my arms lifted to my side and
my head</b>
<br><b>fell back.&nbsp; My friend described me as if I was being raised
as Christ was on</b>
<br><b>the cross.&nbsp; He called out my name at least ten times and I
never responded.</b>
<br><b>He said he tried to pull me back down but the force pulling only
got stronger</b>
<br><b>the more he tried to pull.&nbsp; When he noticed that my skin changing
to a gray</b>
<br><b>color and gasping for air, he jumped on me with all of his strength.&nbsp;
That</b>
<br><b>was when I came to again.</b>
<br><b>After he told I started to freak out.&nbsp; That was when I saw
the room get</b>
<br><b>bright, warm and peaceful.&nbsp; Then I felt hands rest on the top
my head.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>closed my eyes until all the fears were gone. (About 30 seconds)
When I felt</b>
<br><b>the hands come off my head, I opened my eyes.&nbsp; I saw a man
walk from behind</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; He was bright and was flouting across the room.&nbsp;
I didn't see the front</b>
<br><b>of him, but he had long sandy hair and was wearing a long white
gown.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>turned to my friend and said "Jesus is here!"&nbsp; My friend straightened
up, the</b>
<br><b>fear in his eyes died and he said to "Yes he is."&nbsp; At that
moment everything</b>
<br><b>was felt heavenly and peaceful.&nbsp; I have felt the presence of
a heavenly</b>
<br><b>spirit before, but never before was it Jesus himself.&nbsp; No longer
did we feel</b>
<br><b>as if were in danger and I didn't feel that my daughter was in danger.</b>
<br><b>All my friend and I know about that night is what we learned to
be true.</b>
<br><b>Both of us for as long as we could remember knew that there was
something</b>
<br><b>special about us.&nbsp; Also, after that night we both have been
visited by</b>
<br><b>someone telling us that we have some kind of power and our souls
will always</b>
<br><b>find away to meet in each lifetime.</b>

<p><b>My name is Amy.......I have been to the Summerville Light. A bunch
of us not</b>
<br><b>believeing in this happening went out there to see if this was true
and to</b>
<br><b>see if there was anyway that someone could be playing tricks. We
showed up a</b>
<br><b>few hours before dark and went walking threw the woods to see if
there was</b>
<br><b>anyway that anyone could come out there to scare us. We saw noway
that anyone</b>
<br><b>could do this. When night came we all had our seats where we could
watch from</b>
<br><b>every angle. When 12:00 came there was a light in the far distance.
( getting</b>
<br><b>nervous just writing this) We all watched it as it started toward
us slowly</b>
<br><b>as if someone was walking. And of course you have to have that one
dumb ass</b>
<br><b>in the group that has to confront it. When he did it turned a red
color and</b>
<br><b>started after him until he was off the tracks. As if she was warning
and</b>
<br><b>telling him to get off the tracks incase a train comes. When he
was off the</b>
<br><b>tracks it turned and started back to where it came from. It went
on for about</b>
<br><b>an hour then the light just faded away. I am very much a believer
now since</b>

<br><b>The Sullivans</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SweattyTedy@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have not yet started my complete investigation of the USS Sullivans
I</b>
<br><b>needed time to open the ship up and am working on approval to do
an overnight</b>
<br><b>paranormal investigation on the ship. I did however gather a bunch
of</b>
<br><b>information over the internet and through local sources, since I
do live in a</b>
<br><b>suburb of Buffalo, New York.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although as a warm up so to speak, I did
a small scale investigation</b>
<br><b>with a fellow ghost hunter to a famous cemetery located in Grand
Island, New</b>
<br><b>York. The cemetery is next to that famous Holiday Inn in Grand Island
which</b>
<br><b>the entire 4th floor has a paranormal history so active that they
have to</b>
<br><b>seal it to the public from time to time. The activity is believed
to be from</b>
<br><b>a little girl that died in a house fire many years before the Hotel
was built</b>
<br><b>in its place. There have been poltergeist experiences in there even
violent</b>
<br><b>outbreaks at times with ashtrays and other small items being hurled
at the</b>
<br><b>unsuspecting help and guests. It is room 422 where the phenomenon
originates</b>
<br><b>and most of the time is open to the public to rent if they dare
for</b>
<br><b>approximately $89.00 per night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That very same little girl is buried
in the cemetery next door. There</b>
<br><b>are also reports of a military veteran and a young mother with infant
in hand</b>
<br><b>that wander the cemetery, even during daylight hours. My good friend
that</b>
<br><b>went with me also heard a story of a glowing grave when a someone
looks into</b>
<br><b>the cemetery at night and claimed to see it himself.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I needed proof so this past Saturday,
May 19th we set out at 2:00AM to</b>
<br><b>record any possible activity. Armed with only a Sony Cam Corder
with Night</b>
<br><b>Shot and make shift dowsing rods we proceeded to our first mission.
When we</b>
<br><b>began our voyage I did not know what to expect but our first mission
was a</b>
<br><b>success in my eyes.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we entered the grounds I witnessed
the glowing headstone almost</b>
<br><b>immediately, unfortunately I could not see it on my camera due to
the fact it</b>
<br><b>was in the rear of the cemetery. My assistant was holding the dowsing
rods</b>
<br><b>getting a response as soon as they sat in his hands. They appeared
to guide</b>
<br><b>him across the lot as he kept saying that they were leading him
somewhere. We</b>
<br><b>had a brief pause about 10 minutes in, where the temperature dropped</b>
<br><b>drastically and an overwhelming smell of flowers surrounded us,
at which</b>
<br><b>point we saw our breath but the only temperature device we had is</b>
<br><b>incorporated in his truck and read 53 degrees, much to warm to see
thick</b>
<br><b>breath. We then stopped briefly at a grave which had the dowsing
rods</b>
<br><b>swinging heavily, clicking and separating with force. But we continued</b>
<br><b>forward to an even more unexplainable sight. In the distance appeared
the</b>
<br><b>figure of a man wearing white, hanging in a tree, arms spread out,
feet close</b>
<br><b>together. It was again to far to get on camera. But about 5 seconds
after we</b>
<br><b>saw the figure a bizarre hissing noise in bursts of 2 was clearly
audible</b>
<br><b>from what seemed to be generated from the figure. We took that as
our cue to</b>
<br><b>leave abruptly and vacated the premises. On our way out a light
turned on</b>
<br><b>that didn't when we first past it and the truck was mysteriously
unlocked</b>
<br><b>with the interior light turned on, even though we knew that we locked
it</b>
<br><b>tight before we entered. When my assistant reached his home base
his dog of</b>
<br><b>five years growled at him and left the house, which he never did
before.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We waited to the following morning
to review the tape. It appears that</b>
<br><b>I was able to capture the sound that we heard, and what appears
to be 2</b>
<br><b>glowing graves that we could not see with the naked eye. But the
most</b>
<br><b>disturbing to me was a figure that appeared after the sighting of
the man in</b>
<br><b>the tree but right before we heard the eerie sound. It is a mist
right in</b>
<br><b>front of me that had a small ball like figure travel back and forth
then it</b>
<br><b>swung around and formed a solid line with a figure of some sort
surrounding</b>
<br><b>it. To tell you the absolute truth I had my doubts about this type
of</b>
<br><b>activity but am a true believer now with a renewed enthusiasm to
find out</b>
<br><b>more. I am already in the process of upgrading my equipment and
have a long</b>
<br><b>list of local sites to examine. I would appreciate and advise you
may have, I</b>
<br><b>know what equipment I need but I need the tools to keep the spirit
from the</b>
<br><b>possibility of it following me to my home.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Snake</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Snake</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happened towards the end of the 1980s.&nbsp; I used to take
the subway a</b>
<br><b>lot in those days.&nbsp; I was going down some escalators in a subway
station</b>
<br><b>in Montreal.&nbsp; Upon arriving at the end of those escalators,
I happened</b>
<br><b>to look to my left, on the floor and there, on the floor, was a</b>
<br><b>snake-like creature!&nbsp; It was no ordinary snake at that!&nbsp;
It was bright</b>
<br><b>yellow (almost fluorescent) with royal blue stripes and had a funny</b>
<br><b>nose(sort of like the nose of a Concord airplane, but a large one).</b>
<br><b>Moreover, it was really short.&nbsp; Now a snake is usually quite
long.&nbsp; This</b>
<br><b>one was in no way lengthy at all!&nbsp; Let me tell you that even
if this</b>
<br><b>happened during the summer season, there are no snakes in Montreal.</b>
<br><b>Plus, this part of Montreal is very much the city.&nbsp; I have

<br><b>The Shadow Man</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: abbiem@apexmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Hi! Love the site! I've been a regular visitor since about
1997. I've tried a few times to post a story, with no luck...hopefully,
this time it will go through.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I guess I should start by saying that I've had countless experiences
with the "unknown", and I'll be happy to share them all with my friends
here at the Shadowlands! Now, I consider myself to be a very reasonable
and down to earth (no pun intended!) person. I know that what I have experienced
was real, and I have been lucky enough to have witnesses around when most
of the things have happened. That helps you know that you aren't going
crazy!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; My first recollection of ever experiencing a "ghost" happened
when I was 10. I will NEVER forget it! In 1985, My mom,younger sister(8
at the time), and I moved into a basement apartment in Charlotte,NC. This
place was always very dark and dismal. I remember thinking that it really
gave me the creeps. As a matter of fact, if our mom wasn't home, my sister
and I refused to be there! We didn't know why we felt that way, until late
one night... My sister and I shared a fairly large bedroom there. Her bed
was directly facing the door. My bed was on the opposite side of the room,
with a window at street level behind it. One night, I couldn't sleep because
my sister was snoring so loud and I decided to put on a set of headphones
and listen to music until I fell asleep. Well, I did this for awhile, humming
along with my favorite tunes, when I suddenly felt a spine tingling fear
for no reason. I then felt the distinct sensation of being watched from
the open doorway. I recall turning off the headphones and slowly turning
to face the doorway. What met my gaze nearly stopped my heart! There, standing
in the open doorway, at the foot of my sister's bed, was the dark, shadowy
figure of a man. Even though I couldn't make out any distinguishing features,
it looked as if he were wearing a long trench coat and a Fedora style hat.
It reminded me of a Dick Tracy kind of look. This thing had no feet, no
face, hands, anything. It looked like a pitch black cardboard cut-out.
That's when I noticed that you could see the thermostat for the heat/air
on the hall wall directly behind "it". I was relieved, thinking that it
was really just a shadow of someone out on the street whose shadow was
being cast into my room by the streetlight. So, I turned to look behind
me at the window, expecting to see the outline of someone through the shade.
Imagine my horror when there was nothing there! I whipped my head back
around to the doorway. "It" was still there! I don't ever recall being
so scared in my whole life! I didn't know what to do. I was scared for
my sister, who was closer to this thing, seeing as how it's right at the
foot of her bed! That's when I noticed she was no longer making any noise.
I whispered her name, not expecting her to answer me, but she did! So I
asked her, "Do you see it?"&nbsp; Imagine our shock at realizing that we
were BOTH seeing this figure in our room! She started crying (can't say
as I blame her) and I decided to be the brave one. I told her that on the
count of three (I know, but hey, I was only 10), We'd make a mad dash for
our mother's room. This, of course, meant that we'd have to run THROUGH
this thing. Well, terrified or not, we weren't staying in there a moment
longer, I assure you. So, we took off with our eyes closed and made it
safely to our mom's room. I don't think my mom ever asked us why we came
running in there together so scared. Maybe she didn't need to ask. All
I know, is that we moved shortly thereafter, and thank God we never saw
the Shadow Man again. My sister and I never spoke of what had happened
until 1997, when during a phone conversation, I casually mentioned that
I thought my new house was haunted. She then asked me did I recall seeing
the thing in our bedroom that time. Of course I remembered, how could I
forget? All those years later, both of us had the same details of the figure
in our memories. It was nice to know that I had someone on my side that
believed too. As it turned out, there would be many more believers after
I moved into my house in 1997. But that's another story, for another time.
I thank you for letting me tell you about my first experience.</b>

<p><b>The Rustling</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ngicust@emirates.net.ae</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi. I hope you belive this because as time passes this is the one
story</b>
<br><b>of my early teen years that gets more and more crisp in memory.</b>
<br><b>I live in the United Arab Emirates which is a smallish country way
out</b>
<br><b>in the gulf states.When I was a kid i used to live in a small 2</b>
<br><b>bedroomed apartment there with my sister and my parents.</b>
<br><b>My mother has a very strange habit. She doesnt believe that towels
are</b>
<br><b>really clean and usable unless they have been kept outside so that
the</b>
<br><b>sunlight sanitizes them, as a result (Since my room had a balcony
and</b>
<br><b>french windows i.e. floor length windows) she would hang all the
towels</b>
<br><b>in the balcony attached to my room.</b>
<br><b>Now this was rather inconvenient for me since she was an early riser
and</b>
<br><b>would bang into my room every morning, slide open the balcony door
and</b>
<br><b>remove the towels. This would always wake me up for a minute or
two</b>
<br><b>after which I'd go back to sleep again.</b>
<br><b>Now that particular morning (at least I thought it was morning;
it was</b>
<br><b>actually the middle of the night), I heard the the balcony door
slide</b>
<br><b>open again. Now since my mind had gotten used to hearing it slide
shut</b>
<br><b>before it would go back to sleep mode, I was waiting for it to do
just</b>
<br><b>that... but it didint.</b>
<br><b>I guess the mind, once used to a particular stimulus will jar if
there</b>
<br><b>is a change in the routine. Since the balcony door didnt slide close
I</b>
<br><b>awoke and opened my eyes. It was as if someone were peering close
into</b>
<br><b>my face , about a centimetre or two away. But as soon as I opened
my</b>
<br><b>eyes I saw the face draw away. Due to the lack of light all i saw
a a</b>
<br><b>hooded face where only the nose (petite, pointed) was visible. I
was</b>
<br><b>afraid and I quickly shut my eyes again, It wasnt my mother. Then
I</b>
<br><b>heard the person draw away and walk out of the room. She was wearing</b>
<br><b>robes (probably made of silk) because I didtinctly heard them rustle
as</b>
<br><b>she walked away.</b>
<br><b>How do I know its a she? In the&nbsp; arab world women cover their
heads with</b>
<br><b>a scarf sometimes in a hooded fashion, and wear full length robes.</b>
<br><b>All I know is after I heard her leave , I was suddenly so sleepy,</b>
<br><b>although I had been frightened ouit ofn my wits earlier that I fell
at</b>
<br><b>once into a dreamless sleep. When I woke up later, the balcony door
was</b>
<br><b>open.</b>
<br><b>Ofcourse I went directly to my parents room and questioned my mother.</b>
<br><b>She replied that due to my&nbsp; constant whining , she was using
the other</b>
<br><b>balconies to hang the towels ( we have four balconies).</b>
<br><b>The building we live in is one of the oldest in the region. Once
when</b>
<br><b>one of my moms friends (who claims to be a medium) came to visit
but she</b>
<br><b>stayed only for a few minutes saying that the house has another
guest</b>
<br><b>and she(my aunt) was not welcome. Funnily enough my mother never
really</b>
<br><b>liked my aunt very much.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Old Man</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cadysmola@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My first experience with the old man (we don't know his real name)
happened when my mother and I were in her room in our old beat-up house
in the middle of the night getting ready to go to sleep. I was about to
close my eyes when I heard a noise from the attic. My mom heard it too
but we didn't say anything. The noise sounded like step, tap... step, tap...
it sounded like someone was walking with a cane all the way across the
ceiling. When it stopped, my mom was half asleep but she said she heard
it too so it couldn't have been my imagination.</b>
<br><b>A couple weeks later I got up from my room to go to the bathroom,
when I felt a sudden chill. I brushed it off and went on walking. Even
though I didn't grab my glasses I'm sure I saw something or someone. The
shape was blue-white and was walking with a cane! Thinking it was a burglar,
I hid behind my doorway. I looked out there again but it disappeared. There
have been many more experiences with the old man. One time, my mom saw
and old blue man walking up and down our driveway. Another one is when
my little two-year-old sister was in the kitchen and she came zooming out
saying she saw a man in the window. We all got up and ran to see what happened
and who it was but we saw nothing and my little sister was shaking.</b>
<br><b>We later discovered that the old man was the owner of our house
and had died of a heart-attack in the driveway!</b>
<br><b>My family said that we were going to move for a while and have the
house torn down for a new one. My mom and I were in the apartment already
and my dad was getting some last things from the attic late in the night
when he said he heard what sounded like little girls playing. He looked
out the attic window but saw nothing. He got scared so he grabbed the things
and left quickly. When he came home he was pale. That was the end of our
sightings and hearings. The old house is being re-built and we should move
in soon. Hopefully we won't have any more visits.</b>

<br><b>The House on Ontario Road</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>I swear that everything that you are about to read is 100% true.
It's a little lengthy but it's worth the read.I grew up in a house in Welland,
Ontario that my family and I believe to be haunted although we don't talk
about it often. I lived there for over half my life (I'm 26 now) so I have
many experiences to share. I guess the haunting began shortly after my
father began renovations to the house. He planned to add a basement, a
new dining room and kitchen on the main floor and two bedrooms above it.
As the workman were digging up the ground for the basement they uncovered
many odd things such as bones, a pair of eyeglasses, some coins, and some
sort of plastic toy dog. I clearly remember playing in the backyard with
my two sisters and my grandmother when the workman yelled out that they
found something pretty odd under the house referring to the bones. My grandmother
said (by God Joe,(referring to my dad), those are human bones...my dad
denied it saying they belonged to some animal. Anyhow that's when things
started to get strange. Footsteps in the middle of the night, feelings
of constantly being watched especially in one particular walk in closet
in the main bedroom and on the main staircase leading upstairs. Climbing
that staircase was always the worst feeling in the world. It was one of
those wrap around staircases so you could never see what was at the top.
I fell down that staircase more times than you could count but I never
had a cut or a bruise to show for it and never once felt even a little
sore even though the staircase was quite tall. No matter what room I was
in in that house I always felt a feeling of complete terror and dread but
I particularly hated being in the basement or in a certain bedroom on the
second floor. My parents constructed the basement for the soul purpose
of it being a playroom for my siblings and me and not one of us would go
down there on our own free will. Whenever my mother sent me down there
for anything I would run like the devil himself was chasing me. Everyone
complained of a strange scratching noise that sort of echoed through the
entire house as if someone was scratching their fingernails along the walls.
My father had every exterminator in the city come to our house searching
for signs of a rat or a mouse but of course they turned up nothing. Often
after returning home from a day out my dad would take one step inside the
house and say to my mom, keep the kids outside I think someone may have
broken into the house which was totally ridiculous because who would break
into a house and turn a light or a TV on or move one of the kitchen chairs
on top of the table, etc. Something was always "missing" at my house, my
mother would yell about not being able to find her car keys, and my sisters
were constantly at each others throats about missing clothing...you get
the idea. I remember everyone being ready to go to my dear great grandmothers
funeral and my father being unable to locate his car key. He always hung
his keys on the exact same nail every time he walked through the door.
Everyone searched the house high and low. After about a half hour of cursing
and swearing my mother said "Joe, they are right on the nail where you
always leave them." Sooner or later everything would turn up in pretty
much the same place as it was left in the first place.Our two dogs were
constantly spooked. Sometimes we would return home to see that they had
literally tried to scratch/chew their way right out the front door. I will
never forget my dad trying to calm them down one specific evening after
we returned home from a lengthy day out, there's no way to describe it
except to say they had a look of fear to their eyes and it was impossible
to get their attention, they just kept looking nervously around or maybe
at something that we couldn't see. My parents knew the house was haunted...I
often heard my dad telling my mom stories like when he would get up in
the morning to find the dining room table all set for breakfast, or when
he went downstairs in the middle of the night to find my clown (which had
a red glowing nose that would play music) sitting on the middle of the
living room couch when he had tucked me into bed with it only hours before.
My mother would relate with her own stories. Once she was in the house
all alone and she could hear someone talking/whispering in one of the bedrooms
upstairs. Guarding herself with a knife she climbed the stairs. When she's
almost at the bedroom my brothers radio turns on full blast practically
scaring her to death. She ran from the house and was indeed sitting on
the front porch with our two dogs until my father and I returned home some
four hours later, refusing to go inside until my father took a look around.
I've seen "something twice" Once I awoke to see some kind of dog/wolf like
creature at the end of my bed. It was kind of grayish and transparent and
just kept bobbing it's head. Being a child I reached out my hand to pet
it. It bit me...hard...got a kind of panicked look on it's face...and disappeared.
I will never forget the sting of that bite. Often, my oldest sister, who
I think suffered the worst from the haunting, (she has stories that would
scare you to death) made me sleep with her because she was too frightened
to sleep alone. Her bedroom was still being built at the time so it didn't
really have a ceiling just rafters. I remember lying in bed for hours watching
hundreds of crocodiles walking around on those rafters. I wasn't really
afraid, just fascinated and eventually fell asleep. Many times I would
be awakened in the middle of the night by a high pitched voice calling
my name. Sometimes I would lie in bed at night too frightened to sleep
and watch my dolls blink their eyes or watch one of my music boxes start
up on it's own.Sometimes I would hear heavy footsteps coming up the stairs
praying that they wouldn't stop at my door. I used to fall asleep with
the covers over my head and to this day I need to be fully covered when
I sleep. So you're probably wondering how this story ends right...two key
things happened that literally made us run from the house. An unexplained
shadow of a man's profile appeared on the wall. No matter what you moved
around or shook in front of it, it was always the same and appeared every
night. Sometimes it would disappear for an hour or two and then would reappear
in the exact same spot with nothing being moved. The second, that scared
the hell out of my father was one night after returning home the dogs seemed
particularly spooked. He opened the door to walk upstairs and saw a light
burning upstairs. I think the entire family was scared at that point so
we all climbed the stairs together. The lamp in my parents room was on
and had kind of burned the wall behind it. There was no mistaking that
the burn on the wall was that of some kind of demon complete with two horns.
We moved into a new house a couple of weeks later and I can't tell you
the feeling of peace that every member in my family felt. It was a new
concept to me to not feel afraid all the time or to not be terrified at
the though of being left alone for any period of time.Don't forget I was
born into that house in Welland. Although no one was ever seriously hurt
in that house there's no mistaking that "something" was there and that
"something" was evil...it's just a feeling you got every time you walked
through the door. To this day I still have nightmares about that house
as does my two sisters who suffered more then I did. My mother won't even
talk about it. Sometimes when I go back to Welland to visit my family I
drive past that house and stare it in fascination. My sister who has lived
in Welland for 32 years often drives by and often sees a "for sale" sign
posted on the front lawn. I'm not surprised...</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Erseangeltearz@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>We stood in the grave yard as the clock made the sound, we looked
up. 11:45,</b>
<br><b>only a few minuets left before the Witching Hour.... midnight. Jenna
held the</b>
<br><b>necissary items we would need to complet the task we witch in training
were</b>
<br><b>about to do. 6 black candels, a pentical rug, 66 rosemary herbs,
and a dagger</b>
<br><b>so that we could mix our blood in the herb. The grave yard sat not
to far</b>
<br><b>from the school.&nbsp; We sat up all the things. Marcey and Jenna
sat at the two</b>
<br><b>end points of the pentical, Elsa and Daina sat at the side ones,
me at the</b>
<br><b>top and Stacey stood in the middle with her arms crossed on hr chest
like a</b>
<br><b>vampire when it rested as she looked up with eyes closed at the
night sky.</b>
<br><b>Ding, Dong, Ding, Dong. Finally, 12:00.</b>
<br><b>We chanted after our blood was shed,</b>
<br><b>Hear now the word of witches, the creatures take flight</b>
<br><b>what once we brought only darkness but now bring forth the light.</b>
<br><b>Little did we know that we were bringing forth a ghost from the
past.</b>
<br><b>It turned cold so we stopped chanting.... it was summer, how could
it get so</b>
<br><b>cold? We thought. As all of us looked around Stacy started to say
things in a</b>
<br><b>language we've never heard. All I caught was; shevet, kill, shevet,
blood.</b>
<br><b>And to this day I know naught what it is. She was shaking as she
sat down,</b>
<br><b>rocking back and forth. Elsa and I ran but the others stayed behind
as if</b>
<br><b>mesmerized. We watched from the woods. Elsa took out her camera
and started</b>
<br><b>taing pictures every which way. I told her to stop because if someone</b>
<br><b>noticede the flashing they would call the cops and we would be in
som major</b>
<br><b>shyt, but she didn't listen. We heard whispering everywhere and
by now it was</b>
<br><b>getting colder. "Come on Elsa, we have to go!" I told her, giving
her my</b>
<br><b>leather trech coat.</b>
<br><b>"But what about the others?"</b>
<br><b>"Forget about them, if we go back who knows what might happen!"
Someone</b>
<br><b>ttapped us on the shoulder but when weee turned, nothing and no
one was</b>
<br><b>there. We looked back over at the place we started our "seyance"...
they were</b>
<br><b>gone. "Run... now." Elsa told me, but we were both frozen in fright.
Where</b>
<br><b>could they have gone? We didn't even see them go! One minuet they
were there,</b>
<br><b>the next.. vanished without a trace. We bolted for the highway as
fast as we</b>
<br><b>could. Finally shee and I got to her house and fell asleep with
crosses form</b>
<br><b>the basement in a circle about us along with a red pentical made
from grained</b>
<br><b>chalk, we slept inside of it.&nbsp; The next orning when we went
to school it was</b>
<br><b>quiet, no one talked and their eyes were filled with tears. Finally
someone</b>
<br><b>told us that the three o our friends were dead, they went mad and
comitted</b>
<br><b>suicide and murder. We couldn't say a word... dead? No way.</b><b></b>
<p><b>*Three Years Later*</b>
<br><b>It was the night of our drama performance, our teacher... we'll
call him Mr.</b>
<br><b>Thomas told us to go to the fourth grade hallway and wait until
we were</b>
<br><b>called upon to enter on stage left. So we made our way down there.
We looked</b>
<br><b>down the hall, all the doors were open and the lights were on. But
the room</b>
<br><b>we were supposed to go into was locked. "Elsa coem with me to get
the</b>
<br><b>janitor." Mel said tugging her sleve. "No, I stay with Raven." She
said,</b>
<br><b>becase ever since that day she never went to a place without me
(excluding</b>
<br><b>bathroom and showeer , ect.) So nina and janet with her. Elsa, Joan
and I</b>
<br><b>sttood in the hall walking around being our humorus selves until
the lights</b>
<br><b>went out and all the doors slammed shut. She stopped and turned
one of the</b>
<br><b>nobs. Locked.... but how? They weren't the kinds that if you shut
ttthem they</b>
<br><b>locked, and just a second ago they were unlocked. Fog appeared on
the galls</b>
<br><b>windows of the doors while it looked like someone was writting on
them. But</b>
<br><b>wheeen the janitor and the others came abck, everything was as it
was. We</b>

<br><b>The ghost of 15 La Paloma</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Nicchiclv@gateway.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>heres the story of a ghost haunting that took place five years ago.</b>
<br><b>A little girl, haunts a house that we use to live in. We found out
through</b>
<br><b>many questions that she died from heart complications and soon after
her</b>
<br><b>death her mother and brother moved from the house.&nbsp; We came
to the conclusion</b>
<br><b>that she came back to the house looking for her family.</b>
<br><b>When we moved in different things would disappear, and in her former
bedroom</b>
<br><b>it smelt of death.&nbsp; My grandmothers room, the little girls
former room, had</b>
<br><b>the most activity. Her jewlery would go missing for months and then
we would</b>
<br><b>find it in her little trashcan.&nbsp; At night my grandmothers bed
would move as</b>
<br><b>though someone were jumping on it. And in her walk in closet the
clothes</b>
<br><b>would move around as though someone were searching for clothes to
wear.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>brother would get his hair pulled and get scratched when playing
with his</b>
<br><b>toys in the living room. I myself had some personal experiences
with her. she</b>
<br><b>would converse with me at all times of the day including when i
was asleep.</b>
<br><b>One night when taking out the trash with a bunch of cousins and
my brother we</b>
<br><b>heard her crying for her mother from the attic on the third floor.&nbsp;
And since</b>
<br><b>there were no other children living in the house we concluded it
was her.</b>
<br><b>During the day breezes would enter the living room bringing first
a rose sent</b>
<br><b>and then a rotten meat smell.&nbsp; My grandmothers door, when locked
from the</b>
<br><b>inside would open and close while still being locked.</b>
<br><b>The area fan we had in the living room would turn on and off by
itself</b>
<br><b>without being plugged in.</b>
<br><b>And my grandmother one night well watching t.v. had an experience
where the</b>
<br><b>little girl went inside her body and stayed there for a few minutes.&nbsp;
When my</b>
<br><b>grandmother was finally able to regain control of her body, she
let out a</b>
<br><b>scream and ran out of the room and once she was out of the room
you could</b>
<br><b>hear the giggling of a little girl.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Door that Opened by Itself</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: fboily@sympatico.ca</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>One night I was in the study room of our appartment (the study room
was</b>
<br><b>a bedroom that we transformed in which was our computer, library,
table</b>
<br><b>and armchair).&nbsp; I was sitting comfortably in the armchair reading
a</b>
<br><b>book.&nbsp; I had closed the door; now it was really closed, I had
made sure</b>
<br><b>to hear the clenching sound while closing it.&nbsp; Anyways, as
I was sitting</b>
<br><b>and reading, I heard the door unclenching itself.&nbsp; At that
moment, I</b>
<br><b>turned my head and saw that the handle was turning slowly.&nbsp;
The next</b>
<br><b>thing I knew, the door was opened!&nbsp; At first, I thought that
maybe my</b>
<br><b>cat got the door to open and when I saw that this wasnt the case,
I</b>
<br><b>checked out on my husband.&nbsp; He was in the living room.&nbsp;
I asked him if</b>
<br><b>he had opened the door of the study room as sometimes this is what
he</b>
<br><b>would do when I was in there reading or something.&nbsp; He said
&laquo; no &raquo; and I</b>
<br><b>told him that the door opened by itself and that it wasnt our cat!&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>was very surprised!</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Disappearing Lady</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:fboily@sympatico.ca</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>One day (it must have been in 1985) I went with a friend to St. Josephs</b>
<br><b>Oratory which is a religious shrine in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.&nbsp;
At St.</b>
<br><b>Josephs Oratory, there is a place where people can sign a petition</b>
<br><b>demanding the canonisation of Brother Andr&eacute;, who is the founder
of the</b>
<br><b>shrine.&nbsp; Well, my friend and I were signing the petition when
a lady</b>
<br><b>presented herself to me and started begging me for money to feed
her</b>
<br><b>children.&nbsp; I only had five dollars in my wallet and I thought
that if I</b>
<br><b>gave it to her, if something happened on my way back home then I
would</b>
<br><b>have no money left.&nbsp; Moreover, being used to beggars in Montreal,
I was</b>
<br><b>a bit skeptic as to who to give my money to.&nbsp; A lot of beggars
use the</b>
<br><b>money they obtain from people for drugs and cigarettes.&nbsp; Even
those who</b>
<br><b>present themselves in churches and shrines.&nbsp; Anyways, I refused
(and</b>
<br><b>felt bad nonetheless).&nbsp; Not far from the petition area, in
the shrine,</b>
<br><b>there is a hallway.&nbsp; However the hallway is not accessible
from that</b>
<br><b>side of the shrine and is closed off by a huge iron gate.&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>refused to give her my money, the lady left me and started walking
down</b>
<br><b>towards the iron gate.&nbsp; Upon her arriving at the iron gate,
and, to my</b>
<br><b>utter amazement and surprise, she disappeared!&nbsp; It was as if
she</b>
<br><b>disappeared in the iron gate!&nbsp; Whom did I talk to?&nbsp; Who
was that and</b>
<br><b>why?&nbsp; Did I meet a ghost, or an angel?&nbsp; To this day, I
still dont</b>
<br><b>know.&nbsp; This is a true story.</b>

<p><b>The Chair</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hartford@norfieldassociates.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happened about 10 years ago, I was 13 at the time but I believe
very much so, that it was real.</b>
<br><b>My sister, my female cousin and I were watching a silly scary movie.&nbsp;
Even at the time the movie seemed silly but we were having fun.&nbsp; Of
course we had the lights out, and were overreacting to the scary parts
with screams and giggles.</b>
<br><b>All of sudden the screen went blood red and garbled noise, which
sounded similar to several voices all at once trying to speak, came from
the set.</b>
<br><b>Across the room&nbsp; there was the old rocking chair and it was
slowly rocking back and forth.</b>
<br><b>And as sudden as it started, the chair stopped moving and the movie
resumed.</b>
<br><b>The house we were in belonged to my aunt which is in Meriden, CT,
which is also part of the historical society.&nbsp; The house is supposedly
over 200 years old and built on an old cemetary (of course...?).&nbsp;
Which makes my story seem somewhat unbelievable, but I have been a very
strong believer in the living impaired.</b>

a while, I felt a cold dark presence in the room.&nbsp; I got up and left

playing.&nbsp; One got in my face and teased ma as if he knew I were terrified.&nbsp;

<p><b>Supernatural Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:dmv6@rocketmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, I stumbled across your website recently as I</b>
<br><b>was trying to find information on hauntings.&nbsp; This</b>
<br><b>research was due to what I now acknowledge and firmly</b>
<br><b>believe to be a haunting that I experienced.&nbsp; This</b>
<br><b>experience has brought back many memories that upon</b>
<br><b>further inspection I found to be a little too</b>
<br><b>coincidental.&nbsp; I am 22 years old and this is my story.</b>
<br><b>My first strange experience occurred when I was 3</b>
<br><b>years old.&nbsp; My grandfather is a minister so I was</b>
<br><b>brought up with a belief in the supernatural, spirits,</b>
<br><b>and by common reasoning, ghosts.&nbsp; For some reason I</b>
<br><b>was deathly afraid of shadows when I was small, which</b>
<br><b>I did grow out of.&nbsp; My mom wonders about that.</b>
<br><b>Anyways, my mother had left our small apartment to</b>
<br><b>take a load of laundry to the laundramat a couple of</b>
<br><b>buildings over.&nbsp; I distinctly remember watching Scooby</b>
<br><b>Doo on TV and it was an episode about vampires.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>turned my head and saw the handle of our front door</b>
<br><b>shaking and then turning... and then I remember</b>
<br><b>nothing until a few hours later when I wake up in my</b>
<br><b>mother's closet, on top of a box.&nbsp; My mother said she</b>
<br><b>returned home from the laundramat and I was gone. She</b>
<br><b>immediately searched the house, including the closet</b>
<br><b>that I was later found in.&nbsp;&nbsp; She searched the house</b>
<br><b>repeatedly and I was not there.&nbsp; She called my father</b>
<br><b>and my grandparents and asked them to pray. The police</b>
<br><b>were called and they even sent out a helicopter</b>
<br><b>looking for me.&nbsp; There had been a rapist in our</b>
<br><b>apartment complex all during that week that was raping</b>
<br><b>children.&nbsp; My grandmother called my mom after a few</b>
<br><b>hours and told her that she had had a vision of me</b>
<br><b>alone in a room and I was okay.&nbsp; My father returned</b>
<br><b>home from work and they searched some more and awaited</b>
<br><b>any phone call.&nbsp; My mother and father both swear to</b>
<br><b>this day that I was not in the house.&nbsp; Then my mom</b>
<br><b>searched a final time and found me lying in her closet</b>
<br><b>on top of a box by the wall.&nbsp; I remember her picking</b>
<br><b>me up and crying.&nbsp; This struck me as kind of an odd</b>
<br><b>event.</b>
<br><b>When I was 7 we lived in a small rented house.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>remember I had my own bedroom ( I had 2 younger</b>
<br><b>sisters)and I thought I was so grown up.&nbsp; At night</b>
<br><b>there was always a weird tapping sound on my window,</b>
<br><b>although there was no tree outside that window.&nbsp; One</b>
<br><b>night I saw someone walk past that window.&nbsp; My window</b>
<br><b>was in the back yard so someone would have had to</b>
<br><b>climb the fence.&nbsp; Then there was a loud bang against</b>
<br><b>the glass.&nbsp; I ran to my parents' room and slept with</b>
<br><b>them that night.&nbsp; That next sunday I was still so</b>
<br><b>afraid so I had my grandfather pray for me.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>remember he prayed that angels watch over and be with</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; And I know that they do. Of course that's another</b>
<br><b>type of story.</b>
<br><b>When I was 10 we moved to our home that I lived in</b>
<br><b>until recently.&nbsp; The hosue was fairly new, built in</b>
<br><b>the 80's.&nbsp; For a long time the only odd thing that</b>
<br><b>happened was a school ID card that belonged to the boy</b>
<br><b>who lived in my bedroom before me.&nbsp; Sometimes when you</b>
<br><b>opened the closet door that card would fall down off</b>
<br><b>the shelf in the closet and hit you.&nbsp; The odd thing</b>
<br><b>aout that was that although I did keep the card, I</b>
<br><b>always placed it in a drawer in my desk.&nbsp; So I don't</b>
<br><b>know how it kept ending up in the closet or why it</b>
<br><b>would fall down at you.&nbsp; My bedroom was on the second</b>
<br><b>floor and me and my sisters were always afraid to go</b>
<br><b>up there alone.&nbsp; Then when I was about 18 me and my</b>
<br><b>youngest sister would hear strange noises in the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; One morning when I was home alone I heard a</b>
<br><b>voice say hello.&nbsp; It was a scratchy kind of voice,</b>
<br><b>almost like what you would imagine a cat would sound</b>
<br><b>like if it could talk.&nbsp; Anyways it was very quiet at</b>
<br><b>first.&nbsp; It said hello and I thought maybe someone had</b>
<br><b>come home.&nbsp; I said hello and it said hello again,</b>
<br><b>louder this time.&nbsp; By this time I had looked around</b>
<br><b>and knew noone was there.&nbsp; Then the voice said how are</b>
<br><b>you?&nbsp; and I ran out of the house and left.&nbsp; A couple</b>
<br><b>days later my sister was putting clothes into the wash</b>
<br><b>machine and saw a face looking at her from the corner</b>
<br><b>of the garage.&nbsp; My whole family was in the house and</b>
<br><b>we looked to try to see if anyone else had been</b>
<br><b>around, but didnt find anyone.</b>
<br><b>Recently I have moved in with my fiance.&nbsp; we now have</b>
<br><b>a little boy.&nbsp; We moved into an apartment that is in a</b>
<br><b>complex that had a fire several years ago.&nbsp; I don't</b>
<br><b>know if anyone died in the fire or anything, but this</b>
<br><b>is the place where the events transpired that I am</b>
<br><b>certain is a haunting.&nbsp; When we first moved in we were</b>
<br><b>very excited but both noticed that sometimes we were</b>
<br><b>distictly uneasy and felt like someone was watching</b>
<br><b>us.&nbsp; We commented on how we had both never heard of a</b>
<br><b>haunted apartment(which we have now)though.&nbsp; Within</b>
<br><b>the first 2 months we lived here things started</b>
<br><b>happening.&nbsp; It started one night in the middle of the</b>
<br><b>night.&nbsp; I was lying in bed, still awake and my fiance</b>
<br><b>was half asleep.&nbsp; Our son was sleeping in his crib&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>was 18 months old at the time.&nbsp; Everything was very</b>
<br><b>quiet and then all of a sudden a door in our apartment</b>
<br><b>slammed shut.&nbsp; My fiance and I were bother very alert</b>
<br><b>and thought that someone had broken into the</b>
<br><b>apartment.&nbsp; we searched the apartment and found</b>
<br><b>nothing.&nbsp; Our son remained sound asleep.&nbsp; Two days</b>
<br><b>later my keys turned up missing.&nbsp; I didn't think much</b>
<br><b>of it until I started doing research and found that</b>
<br><b>many ghosts like to take and hide objects, often keys.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I had begun researching because by this point,</b>
<br><b>although very little had occurred, the recent events,</b>
<br><b>combined with our instincts and first impressions were</b>
<br><b>pointing that way.&nbsp; The day after my keys were missing</b>
<br><b>my fiance's mother came to visit.&nbsp; She brought her</b>
<br><b>little dog over.&nbsp; He behaved normally most of the day</b>
<br><b>and evening but ten at one point started watching</b>
<br><b>something move around the move.&nbsp; My fiance, his mother</b>
<br><b>and I watched for several minutes as he stared</b>
<br><b>intently at something we could not see.&nbsp; Then he</b>
<br><b>suddenly yelped and winced as if he had beeb kicked.</b>
<br><b>He curled up in a ball and started shaking. This shook</b>
<br><b>us all up and My fiance's mother took the dog and left</b>
<br><b>shortly after that.&nbsp; The next day she came back over</b>
<br><b>while my fiance was at work.&nbsp; She was using our</b>
<br><b>computer in the bedroom and the dog and my son were</b>
<br><b>playin in the bedroom next to her.&nbsp; I went and made a</b>
<br><b>pot of coffee and then came back to talk to her for</b>
<br><b>awhile.&nbsp; When I went to get a cup of coffee I found</b>
<br><b>that the coffee had been poured all over the</b>
<br><b>countertop.&nbsp; The pot was sitting back on the burner</b>
<br><b>and the burner and the pot were bother dry, which</b>
<br><b>meant that the coffeepot had not leaked.&nbsp; The coffee</b>
<br><b>had somehow been poured all over the counter.&nbsp; A week</b>
<br><b>later I was complaining to my fiance about my lost</b>
<br><b>keys.&nbsp; we had searched the house from top to bottom</b>
<br><b>and couldn't find them.&nbsp; I was very upset because I</b>
<br><b>had a keychain that I recieved the day my son was born</b>
<br><b>that has extreme sentimental value.&nbsp; The next morning</b>
<br><b>I awoke to find the keys sitting conspicuously in the</b>
<br><b>middle of the couch.&nbsp; I called my boyfriend at work to</b>
<br><b>thank him for finding them and he told me that he had</b>
<br><b>not put them there and had not found them.&nbsp; Our son</b>
<br><b>was still sleeping so it could not have been him.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>had also noticed our son watching something we could</b>
<br><b>not see on seeveral occassions.&nbsp; Then recently the</b>
<br><b>biggest event occurred. By this point I was certain</b>
<br><b>that there was some type of presence in our home.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>got a dog, part german shepherd part pit bull, to make</b>
<br><b>us feel safer.&nbsp; For 3 nights I would lay there unable</b>
<br><b>to sleep because I could hear footsteps in the</b>
<br><b>hallway.&nbsp; This happened at about 1 am every night, by</b>
<br><b>which time my fiance was always asleep.&nbsp; The dog was</b>
<br><b>always lying in a corner of the bedroom and our son in</b>
<br><b>bed.&nbsp; One Saturday night I was sitting in the living</b>
<br><b>room and my fiance was putting our son in bed.&nbsp; Our</b>
<br><b>son's bedroom was to my right.&nbsp; I was looking straight</b>
<br><b>ahead into our kitchen.&nbsp; Out of the corner of my eye I</b>
<br><b>saw a movement in the huge mirror on that wall.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>mirror reflects the hall between my bedroom and the</b>
<br><b>living room. The hallways goes by the kitchen.</b>
<br><b>ANyways, I noticed a movement and glanced at the</b>
<br><b>mirror.&nbsp; I saw the shape of a person, which at first I</b>
<br><b>thought was my fiance until I recalled he was in our</b>
<br><b>son's bedroom.&nbsp; The figure was tall and dark, like if</b>
<br><b>someone was standing in front of a bright light.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>couldn't make out the features.&nbsp; The figure moved</b>
<br><b>quickly down the hall towards the living room where I</b>
<br><b>was sitting. I looked from the mirror to the hallways</b>
<br><b>and nothing was there. I yelled for my fiance and he</b>
<br><b>came runnig I started crying and told him what I had</b>
<br><b>seen. We grabbed the baby and left the apartment.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>noticed it was around 1 am.&nbsp; We talked about it for a</b>
<br><b>long time.&nbsp; By this point we had read the shadowlands</b>
<br><b>webpage and we knew there was some type of spirit in</b>
<br><b>our home.&nbsp; We prayed for a long time together and then</b>
<br><b>decided to go back to apartment and try to tell the</b>
<br><b>spirit to leave.&nbsp; I was terrified but my fiance was</b>
<br><b>very brave and after we had prayed and&nbsp; asked God to</b>
<br><b>remove the spirit and protect us and our son, I felt</b>
<br><b>much better.&nbsp; We arrived back at the apartment and sat</b>
<br><b>down in the living room.&nbsp; We made sure to speak to the</b>
<br><b>spirit as we would another person, told it that we</b>
<br><b>acknowledged that it was there and that we had no</b>
<br><b>choice about living here, we have to stay here.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>told it that we had prayed and that God was protecting</b>
<br><b>us and that it scared us when it moved things and</b>
<br><b>especially when we could hear or see it.&nbsp; We asked it</b>
<br><b>to leave and if it would or could not leave to not</b>
<br><b>make itself known to us in any way anymore. Then we</b>
<br><b>prayed some more and went to bed.&nbsp; I'm not certain if</b>
<br><b>the spirit has left or not, a couple questionable but</b>
<br><b>in no way definate events later happened, but we have</b>
<br><b>had no more scary events.&nbsp; We feel alot more</b>
<br><b>commfortable and safe here and are much happier.</b>

<p><b>Strange Happenings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: zazu_k@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was looking at your site which was recommended to me</b>
<br><b>by my boyfriend, who has submitted a story before, and</b>
<br><b>i thought i would tell you about the strange</b>
<br><b>happenings in my very own house.&nbsp; I live in Scotland</b>
<br><b>Aberdeenshire and my house is a very old cottage.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>house used to be two separate halves and my bedroom is</b>
<br><b>located above the kitchen and a small living room.</b>
<br><b>About a year ago i was on my bed reading and i had my</b>
<br><b>dog at the bottom of my bed i turned off my light and</b>
<br><b>she started growling at something so of course i</b>
<br><b>turned the light on really quickly to see what was</b>
<br><b>wrong.&nbsp; There was nothing there at all and my dog was</b>
<br><b>pushing me back into the corner of my room away from</b>
<br><b>something and she wouldnt stop growling, her hackles</b>
<br><b>were up and she was drooling and snarling, snapping at</b>
<br><b>nothing but she has never behaved like she had then,</b>
<br><b>as soon as i took her out of the room she wouldnt let</b>
<br><b>anyone into the room as she was still growling at</b>
<br><b>something.&nbsp; When she finally let me and my mother look</b>
<br><b>into my room she walked in searching for whatever it</b>
<br><b>was she had been previously growling at and she</b>
<br><b>settled down as it was obviously not there anymore.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>tried to forget it and put it to the back of my mind</b>
<br><b>til i started seeing things out of the corner of my</b>
<br><b>eye, like someone behind me or stading staring at me</b>
<br><b>from my blind spot.&nbsp; I also have (quite heavy) chimes</b>
<br><b>along my curtain rail, and now and then they will go</b>
<br><b>wild as though a wind is blowing them about or like</b>
<br><b>someone has brushed past but it is not my window or a</b>
<br><b>draft or anythign like that as there are no drafts and</b>
<br><b>even when it has been blowing a gale outside the</b>
<br><b>chimes have been still.&nbsp; I have the biggest radiator</b>
<br><b>in the house and even when they are on full blast my</b>
<br><b>room can be freezing, yet when there are off even in</b>
<br><b>winter it can be abnormally warm in ym room.&nbsp; I can</b>
<br><b>hear noises downstairs and my dog wimpers but not like</b>
<br><b>she is dreaming or wanting attention but more afraid</b>
<br><b>and panicking, once i have gone downstairs and let her</b>
<br><b>out of the kitchen where she sleeps at night and she</b>
<br><b>has run out with her tail between her legs whihc she</b>
<br><b>only does when intimidated, and she isnt that small a</b>
<br><b>dog.&nbsp; When my boyfriend was up staying at my house he</b>
<br><b>was sleeping alone in my double bed and he felt</b>
<br><b>someone climb into bed and lie next to him with an arm</b>
<br><b>across his shoulder or back, so of course he thought</b>
<br><b>it was me til he tried to return the holding and find</b>
<br><b>no-one there, this would happen several nights in a</b>
<br><b>row.&nbsp; One night i was awaoken by the corner of my</b>
<br><b>matress dipping down as though someone had sat down i</b>
<br><b>could see the depression print, then it rose again as</b>
<br><b>though whatever it was had stood up.&nbsp; My chair at the</b>
<br><b>bottom of my room (which has wheels) has moved on its</b>
<br><b>own accord at times not much but slightly forward by a</b>
<br><b>few inches and there is nothing behind it to fall and</b>
<br><b>push it forward or anything like that.&nbsp; We are</b>
<br><b>currently uplifting the floor of the small living room</b>
<br><b>and have a hole in the floor boards at present as we</b>
<br><b>are re-flooring it, the dog dropped her toy down the</b>
<br><b>floorboards and it wasnt dark or anything like that</b>
<br><b>and it wasnt a big drop at all, yet she would not</b>
<br><b>retrieve her toy.&nbsp; We (my boyfriend, myself and the</b>
<br><b>dog) were alone in the house once and we heard a</b>
<br><b>thump, and we were all sat in the front room including</b>
<br><b>the dog, when we went to check it out the hoover which</b>
<br><b>had been standing firmly up against a wall for days in</b>
<br><b>the small living room had somehow managed to fall down</b>
<br><b>into the hole in the floorboards.&nbsp; These strange</b>
<br><b>happenings are among a few that have happened, and</b>
<br><b>still continue.</b>

<p><b>Whats in the Bushes</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: irenevasquez@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>The other day I went over my friends house.It was about 10:30 p.m.
when we</b>
<br><b>started hearing these noises coming from the bushes on this hill.We
started</b>
<br><b>to hear this kind of russling sound coming from</b>
<br><b>the plants below us.We knew it wasn't a cat because we hit the bushes
with a</b>
<br><b>stick,and if it was a cat it would've hissed at us or something.The
moment</b>
<br><b>we heard the sounds the lights from the house down the hill went
on.But I</b>
<br><b>know nobody turned on the lights because they were those motion
sensure</b>
<br><b>lights.After a while we heard the noises again,this time his dog
started to</b>
<br><b>go crazy,so my friend dropped the stick,the one he was used to hit
the</b>
<br><b>bushes with,on the floor and we ran like hell.A few minutes later
we went</b>
<br><b>back to the back yard.But as soon as we went back there we noticed
that the</b>
<br><b>stick he had thrown on the floor was standing right back up leaning
on the</b>
<br><b>wall.I had seen him throw down the stick,and we were together the
whole</b>
<br><b>time,so it wasn't us who picked the stick up,plus we were home alone.After</b>
<br><b>that I couldn't sleep all night.</b>

<p><b>...she never left..</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sucrotic@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Your website's awesome. I always check the stories out whenever I
get the</b>
<br><b>time to do so. Oftentimes, the stories would reduce me to this</b>
<br><b>frightened..jumpy person:), but I like getting a good scare every
now and</b>
<br><b>then.</b>
<br><b>For as long as I could remember, whenever we have family over, we
always</b>
<br><b>talk about our supernatural experiences. My cousins and I never
get tired of</b>
<br><b>hearing these stories. It's "customary" for us to sit around in
the living</b>
<br><b>room and listen to our relatives ghostly experiences. Well anyway,
here's a</b>
<br><b>few of them.</b>
<br><b>Back in the early 70's, my Mom and her siblings lived in this old
apartment</b>
<br><b>in the city. Their real house is up in the countryside but they
rented this</b>
<br><b>place because it's close to the university they go to. Well, their
Aunt and</b>
<br><b>her husband used to live there. The Aunt died of aggravated asthma
(yes she</b>
<br><b>did) in that apartment and her husband had long since moved out.
Well, my</b>
<br><b>Mom and her siblings would live there for the next 2 decades or
so and with</b>
<br><b>it their ghostly experiences about their Auntie.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The Chair</b>
<br><b>When my aunt was still in college and was just dating her husband,
they</b>
<br><b>would always 'chill' by the living room and talk. According to my
aunt, they</b>
<br><b>were sitting on the couch talking and right across from them was
this old</b>
<br><b>wooden chair that had been there long before they moved in. The
chair was</b>
<br><b>about 3 feet away from them. My uncle was saying something when
my aunt</b>
<br><b>happen to glance at the chair. The chair was slowly turning&nbsp;
(as if to face</b>
<br><b>them) and at first she thought it was my uncle's feet that was nudging
it.</b>
<br><b>When she realize that the chair was slowly turning on its own, she
was so</b>
<br><b>shocked she couldn't speak. She couldn't take her eyes off the chair,
all</b>
<br><b>she could do was tap my uncle by his thigh and gesture towards the
chair. My</b>
<br><b>uncle just kept on talking..when my aunt finally found her voice
she said "</b>
<br><b>Look at the chair!!". My uncle reached out for it and even before
his hand</b>
<br><b>could touch it, the chair lurched towards them!! They were so freaked
out</b>
<br><b>they ran out of the place. My aunt always jokes about how my uncle
took off</b>
<br><b>way faster than she did.:).</b><b></b>
<p><b>The Lady</b>
<br><b>Same apartment. The girls bedroom had a bunk bed and another queen-sized
bed</b>
<br><b>(my mom has 4 other sisters and 3 brothers).One night,one of my
aunts who</b>
<br><b>sleeps in the queen-sized bed woke up and turned on her side (facing
the</b>
<br><b>bunk bed).She opened her eyes a bit and her eyes drifted up the
top bunk.</b>
<br><b>She saw one her sisters sleeping peacefully (at the top) but right
next to</b>
<br><b>her was this lady. All that my aunt could see was the upper torso
of her</b>
<br><b>body and the lady was watching her sister sleep. My aunt quickly
turned her</b>
<br><b>back towards the bunkbed and shut her eyes and din't dare crack
them open</b>
<br><b>again until she woke up the next morning. She kept thinking that
the lady is</b>
<br><b>now right behind her or in front of her and she really didn't want
to 'see</b>
<br><b>her again'. The next morning, she told her family about what she
saw over</b>
<br><b>breakfast. She really freaked her younger sister out. And for us
second</b>
<br><b>generation members, we just get a kick out of hearing it and clown
my</b>
<br><b>aunt(bunk bed) because she always screams every time they remind
her about</b>
<br><b>it.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Shadow</b>
<br><b>Eventually, my mom and her siblings moved out of the place and the
last</b>
<br><b>occupants of the apartment were my uncle and his family. My cousin
shared me</b>
<br><b>this experience:</b>
<br><b>When she was about 9, my cousin remembered waiting for her mom to
come up</b>
<br><b>the stairs with her.It was bedtime and she was waiting for her at
the top of</b>
<br><b>this L-shaped stairs. From the top of the stairs, you could see
the first</b>
<br><b>flight until it reaches the landing, so you could see whoever's
coming up.</b>
<br><b>Well, as my cousin sat at the top of the stairs, she saw a shadow
of a lady</b>
<br><b>by the wall where the first flight of stairs is and it started to
'climb</b>
<br><b>(glide)' up the stairs and disappeared before it reached the landing.
She</b>
<br><b>called out to her mom in earnest and told her mom about what she
saw.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Breathing</b>
<br><b>Over the years, they have heard this labored breathing in the girls
bedroom.</b>
<br><b>They thought it was the neighbors but soon dismissed such an idea
because</b>
<br><b>the walls between the apartments were made of about a foot and a
half of</b>
<br><b>concrete. Sounds as light as breathing couldn't easily penetrate
through</b>
<br><b>those walls.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The dresser</b>
<br><b>Before my uncle and his family (the last occupants) moved out of
the</b>
<br><b>apartment, my Dad came over to help them. My uncle said to my Dad
to take</b>
<br><b>whatever furniture he fancys (since we also just moved in a new
house at</b>
<br><b>that time)for our new house. My Dad took fancy over this old dresser
(owned</b>
<br><b>by the late Aunt)in the girls bedroom. As he was looking it over,
he opened</b>
<br><b>one of its drawers a little bit. Can you imagine how surprised my
poor Dad</b>
<br><b>was when the drawer slid back in. Dismissing it as some</b>
<br><b>'old-wood-swelling-up', he opened the drawer again, only wider this
time.</b>
<br><b>The drawer slid all the way back in again as if some unseem hand
had pushed</b>
<br><b>it. That shook my Dad up pretty much that he went downstairs and
didn't tell</b>
<br><b>my uncle about it--until years later.</b><b></b>

<br><b>House of 1920</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tamblin@grantspass.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My family and I moved into our house with the knowledge that it was
built in the 1920's.&nbsp; After a few weeks we noticed that our freshly
painted white bathroom walls were peeling and a pickish drippy moldy substance
was seeping through.&nbsp; We didn't think much of it, just concluded that
it was an old house and the moisture from showers and such must be causing
the mold.</b>
<br><b>About a month after we moved in one of my friends were dropping
me off, when her mom said that she used to know a guy who lived there.&nbsp;
It was about seven years prior and he was one of her friends boyfriends.&nbsp;
He had problems with depression, and ended up shooting himself in the temple...her
friend found him in the bathroom.</b>
<br><b>I explained her story to my parents, and they wondered if that had
something to do with the wall, they even wondered if the pink substance
on the wall, it did kind of resemble blood, or atleast the way blood would
have hit the wall.</b>
<br><b>W contacted the previous owners of the house to ask them if anything
strange had ever happened to them, after explaining my friends mothers
story.&nbsp; They never had problems with the bathroom walls, infact they
said the walls never molded.&nbsp; They did say that they ended up putting
their entertainment center in front of the fireplace, due to weird whispering
and high pitched noises they claimed were coming from there.&nbsp; After
that we only heard high pitch noises, but only a few times, and everything
in the house has to be completely silent...we heard it in the middle of
the night.&nbsp; We now have our center in front of it also.</b>
<br><b>About five months went by with nothing happening except for the
persistant mold.&nbsp; I actually began to forget about the mans suicide
in our bathroom, until I started hearing the knockings.&nbsp; At first
thought they were coming from outside on my window, then I realized they
were from the wall beside my window...my window is right next to the chimney.&nbsp;
I woke up to tell my dad, but he was already awake, he heard them too.&nbsp;
He thought that it might have been my boyfriend, but when I assured him
that it wasn't, he thought someone might be watching me.&nbsp; This ideas
soon changed after setting "traps" for the intruder and having police servalence
for many weeks.&nbsp; The knockings never stopped and we still hear them
frequently.</b>
<br><b>One morning my father was getting out of the shower, and he reached
for his towel.&nbsp; When he brought it up to his face he was surprised
by it's repugnant smell.&nbsp; He had grabbed it from the shelf clean...but
it still smelled sour like really bad body odor.&nbsp; He thought that
perhaps it was washed with some extremely smelly clothes or something...but
when he checked the other towels they all smelled fine, even the one that
it was folded on top of.&nbsp; Since then numerous sparatic articles of
our clothing will smell bad.</b>
<br><b>We've had two unexplainable experiences with earrings.&nbsp; My
mom had bought a pair of earrings for a gift for one of her friends.&nbsp;
She set them on her dresser while she went to find a box.&nbsp; When she
was placing them in the box one of them dropped.&nbsp; She went to pick
it up but couldn't find it.&nbsp; She ended up going through all of her
drawers wondering if it fell in a cracked open drawer.&nbsp; When she couldn't
find it there, she moved the dresser and the surrounding furniture...the
earring was no where to be found.&nbsp;&nbsp; Six months later my mom was
getting a pair of shorts from my fathers summer dresser (which hadn't been
opened since the previous summer) and brought them to him.&nbsp; Later
that day he found the earring in his pocket.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other experience
happened one day when I was getting ready for school.&nbsp; I put my earrings
on and pushed the back of mine in real tight against the lobe as i always
do, when i went to put the other earring on.&nbsp; I felt something fall
and noticed that it was the earring I had just put on.&nbsp; Thinking that
the back must have fell off, I leaned down to pick it up.&nbsp; I then
noticed that the back was still on.&nbsp; Frantically I checked my ear
to see if the hole had slit, but it was normal.&nbsp; I still don't know
how the earring ever fell out of my ear without the back being removed.</b>
<br><b>The most recent things that have happened have been in the bathroom.&nbsp;
I was home alone and reading in my room when I thought I heard a big crash
coming from the kitchen area.&nbsp; It sounded like our computer had fallen
off of the desk.&nbsp; I walked out there to see what happened, and found
everything as normal.&nbsp; I reasoned I was just hearing things so I walked
back to my room. When I passed the bathroom, the toilet flushed...I was
only one home. Scared I decided to go visit my boyfriend, and call my mom
and tell her from his house.</b>
<br><b>A few nights later I was showering when the water became suddenly
freezing cold. I turned around fast to turn it off when I saw a man's face
staring back at me...I will only shower in the other bathroom now.</b>
<br><b>We don't plan on moving. Our disturbances have only been minor.&nbsp;
I just thought I would share this with you.</b>

<p><b>A Couple of Ghosts Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jennifer.bennetts@gte.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>i am kind of new at this and must admit that i am very nervous so
i apologize if i sound a little off. i am afraid</b>
<br><b>people will make fun of me if i tell of my experiences. i don't
want people to think that i am a head case. i</b>
<br><b>actually have a few stories to tell. the truth is things happen
to me everyday, in front of people, total strangers</b>
<br><b>or family. it can be a little unnerving, but i have gotten used
to it over the years. my name is jenny... sorry i</b>
<br><b>guess i should mention that.</b>
<br><b>this is the first story. this person has followed me from virginia
to california and my husband has heard him in</b>
<br><b>our house:</b>
<br><b>when i was about 17 i was living in fort lee, virginia and on a
certain day we had gone to a native american</b>
<br><b>pow wow. well, when i had gone home that evening i did not think
anything was unusual until about 7 p.m.</b>
<br><b>my brother and i were watching unsolved mysteries and i was passing
some rude comments. i left the living</b>
<br><b>room to go use the restroom. i shut the door when all of a sudden
the door started to shake and it sounded</b>
<br><b>like someone was banging on the door. they did this three times
and needless to say i was irritated. i opened</b>
<br><b>the door when i looked quickly to the right, thinking it was my
younger brother being a jerk when i saw a</b>
<br><b>man. he was about 5 8' with dark hair and dark eyes. i looked right
at him and looked away to the left. when</b>
<br><b>i dared to look back he was gone. i could see my brother down the
hall laying on the bed with a horrified</b>
<br><b>look upon his face. my father was on the phone looking at me like
what had happend. i then accused my</b>
<br><b>brother of playing games with me and he denied it. then i walked
angrily into the living room. then a loud</b>
<br><b>indian war cry was heard throughout the house my my father and brother.
i was stunned and even my</b>
<br><b>grandmother on the phone heard it. come to find out that night we
were adopted into a native american tribe.</b>
<br><b>one of the gals that my father works with did this out of friendship.</b>
<br><b>......this is not the end.....</b>
<br><b>strange things continued to happen and i did move to.... i moved
to visalia in california..... ever since i have</b>
<br><b>lived here a few strange things have happend. my husband was in
the shower and i was laying in bed waiting</b>
<br><b>to talk to him when he got back when i felt someone in the room.
i looked up and i saw a shadow of a man.</b>
<br><b>at first i thought it was my husband, but i realized that this person
was my height. my husband is 6 1' and very</b>
<br><b>wide. this shadow was my height and not broad. i then looked away
and back like most people do to find</b>
<br><b>that the person had dissappeared. about 3 mintues later my husband
walked out of the bathroom. i asked</b>
<br><b>him if he had come out of the bathroom at all and he said no. needless
to say i was a little spooked.</b>
<br><b>then, when my husband and i were in out bedroom we were talking
someone said , "it didn't matter anyway,</b>
<br><b>because it wasn't going to happen". my husband jumped up and left
the room. also earlier in the winter we</b>
<br><b>were using the buck stove when my husband went to check on it when
the wood was thrown in front of him.</b>
<br><b>that spooked him also. latley i have seen out of the corner of my
eye the same shadow watching me in the</b>
<br><b>hallway.</b>
<br><b>now here are the other people:</b>
<br><b>i have a 2 year old and i used to have an intercom for her. well
i stopped using it because some strange things</b>
<br><b>starting happening. once my daughter was crying and we specifically
heard a women say "be quiet now".</b>
<br><b>needless to say my daughter started to cry more. i have left her
room door open and have litterly heard it shut</b>
<br><b>and walked up to it to see it shut. my husband is a truck driver
so there is no one in the house with us. i have</b>
<br><b>come into the room to see her standing up cooing and trying to talk
to someone that is not there. also about 2</b>
<br><b>months ago my daughter was being a real pain&nbsp; and was crying
a lot . i told her to be quiet and she would</b>
<br><b>not. then in a loud voice a man said "be quiet". my daughter shutted
up and was staring at nothing.</b>
<br><b>the last one that i will mention is this and it also happend in
front of my husbad. it was about 7am and my</b>
<br><b>husband was getting ready for work . he was sitting on the bed next
to me putting his socks on . i opened my</b>
<br><b>eyes&nbsp; to say something to him when i saw face of a man looking
at&nbsp; me. he had red hair and green eyes and a</b>
<br><b>round face. i only saw the face.i cried out and josh asked me what
was wrong. he was trying to calm me</b>
<br><b>down because i was shaking i was so unnerved. it through me off
guard.</b>
<br><b>i know this is a lot and i apologize. there are so many stories
that have happend with my brother,</b>
<br><b>grandmother, etc. i feel like i am haunted. i feel like they follow
or are attracted to me and i don't know how</b>
<br><b>to deal with it . i am sane. i am a mathematics major and a wife
and mother. i would never ever lie and i must</b>
<br><b>admit that this is very difficult for me to write.</b>

<p><b>Brush with Spirits</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: talbain_784@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hiya. My name is Ben K., and well, i love the supernatural. I have
had my own little brush with spirits before, too.</b>
<br><b>1.Apr. ??, 1996--I was with my older brother in my living room.
He could not get any reception on the tv.INT HINT!) I was look out a large
window in the room, when i saw what i believe is a ufo or apparition. my
brothher saw it too. it was in a forest at the bottom of the hill in our
backyard, and it looked like a sphere, with rays (4 of `em,) comin g out
of it, all pointed at the end, and the bottom one was signifacantly larger
than the rest. it floated up until it was out of the forest, then flew
over our house, then was gone.</b>
<br><b>2.1998--I was lying in bed, reading a magazine. My father had died
last year. Suddenly, a spray of something, i don`t know what, was shot
on me. I looked up and saw what i believe to be my father. I ddidn`t get
a very good look.</b>
<br><b>3.2001--I had begun to grow my hair out a little, and you can get
a good grip on it. Anyway, i was about to fall asleep, when i felt something
like a hand run through my hair. it happened 5 more times, the, suddenly,
there was a quick, hard tug at my hair, but i experienced nothing more
that night.</b>

<p><b>Hello! My name is Joe, I have been a resident of Beverly all my</b>
<br><b>life- 47 yrs. I would like to relate an occurrence that happened
to</b>
<br><b>myself &amp; a good friend Doug Borden. We were about 14 or so,
Doug was</b>
<br><b>asked to care for a family friend's pets while they were on vacation.</b>
<br><b>One evening Doug &amp; I were in the&nbsp; kitchen opening the food
for the dog &amp;</b>
<br><b>cat, when we heard the sound(s) of something like a bowling ball
rolling</b>
<br><b>down steps. We ran out of there!</b>
<br><b>OK! Now flash forward about 5 years in time. Doug's family's friends
are</b>
<br><b>moving to Dallas, their friend from across the street was into the</b>
<br><b>paranormal. She had a medium (is that right?); come into the house
due</b>
<br><b>to the fact that we &amp; everyone always got a freaky feeling being
in that</b>
<br><b>house. Myself included. There was an article printed in the Burlington</b>
<br><b>County Times concerning the findings of the medium. Here, I came
to find</b>
<br><b>out that:</b>
<br><b>*1. Every family that lived there, the youngest son died.</b>
<br><b>*2. A bedroom in the back of the house was always cold, the medium</b>
<br><b>described several forms sitting on the bed. She described the youngest</b>
<br><b>son of the family, among others; that recently moved that had passed</b>
<br><b>away some months ago.</b>
<br><b>*3. On such an occasion where someone died, while removing the corpse</b>
<br><b>from the aforementioned bedroom, the corpse slipped off the stretcher,

because alot of people I know don't believe but here we go. When i was
5 years old my parents moved into a nice big house in town. There was a
long driveway and the house was set way back from the road. It was a beautiful
home with a large oak staircase and separate stairs which I guess were
used for the servants at one time. There was a basement off the garage
and a wine cellar. For some reason I never went down there. I was always
afraid. The second floor had 3 bedrooms, a bathroom and a second kitchen.
My room was at the end of the hall by the kitchen. Every night at bedtime
I would make sure my closet door was closed. It gave me the creeps. Strange
things started happening in my room and it got to the point I didn't want
to go to bed. I can remember begging my parents to let me sleep anywhere
else. My parents told me I'd be okay that I was just having nightmares.
I believed them and went back to my room to sleep. Well later on that night
I woke up and my room was bright. I looked out my window and it was daylight
and the birds were singing. No sooner did I turn to go to my door the daylight
disappeared. It was still the middle of the night. My closet door was open
and I could see a shadow of someone in there. This had happened a few times
before but this night I screamed bloody murder and ran down the hall to
my parents room. Now they were also a little concerned and decided to move.
On the day of the move, my Dad went ahead with a load and my Mom and I
were upstairs. We finished what we were doing and started down the stairs.
Halfway down the closet door at the bottom of the stairs opened on it's
own. We ran back upstairs and waited for my Dad to come back. We left that
place and never went back. When I was around 12 I was talking to my Mom
about that house and she told me the people that had leaved there previously
moved because their son in his 20's had hung himself in the basement. Guess
where he slept? MY ROOM! This is a true story. I still get goosebumps when
I think about it but I would love to go back to that house and see if things
still happen now that i am older.</b>
