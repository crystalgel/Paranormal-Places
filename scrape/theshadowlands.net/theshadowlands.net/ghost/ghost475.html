&nbsp;well around the year of 2004 myself, my dad,my sister,my
stepmom,stepsister,and two stepbrothers lived in a trailer around
spotsylvania county.in Virginia,home of many civil wars.i was 9 years
old and we had always played with a wigi board and got scared and stuff
for fun.till one night we asked him for a sign that he was rele with
us.and out of no where the chains we use to tie our dogs up with would
start shaking and rattling while both our dogs where inside and it was
nice weather..no wind what so ever.after it stopped we even looked out
to find that there was no one out there.here is another time when
myself and stepbros where sleeping in the living room,it was pitch
black and quite around 11 o clock.i was looking around and saw three
blue legs in front of me ontop of the couch i was laying on.i than
freaked out and whispered hey you guys look do you see those blue
things ontop they couch.i dont remember what they said but i remember i
wasnt scared at all.calm.but so thats the end of my real life
encounters.but other than that theres only one reason i could think of
those spirits to be there.i heard that there was supposedly a hidden
cemeterie back in the woods and even asked neighbors about it and they
said yea weve heard. but no ones ever found it that i know of.we now
live in a old civil war house and have not yet had the chance to make
an encounter. i would like to. and as soon as i do i will post it right
here. thank you for reading.<br>

Phone Jacks<br>

I have been reading these stories, for so many years. I am 40 and have
experienced paranormal activity since I was about 6 years old. I like
to add my stories as they come to me. My 16 year old Daughter just
asked me to add her story.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Last year (2008) my Daughter had her bedroom in the basement of our
house. Before she took it over, it had been a home office. She had her
best friend Kirsten sleep over one night. They spent a majority of the
night screwing around down there. At 3am they decided to go to bed.
They shut everything off and fell asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
4am Kirsten wakes up, and hears a slow clicking noise. She said it was
just a click-click-click. She woke my Daughter up, and asked her if she
knew what that noise was. They sat and listened to this click sound,
when they figured out what it was. The clicking was coming from two
separate phone jacks in the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
At this time we had no land phones in the home, no phone connections.
The entire Family used cell phones. The girls finally fell back
asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; 4:45am Kirsten wakes again, this time the clicking
is going in a rapid succession very fast. She said she just felt this
uneasy feeling come over her.Thats when she saw it. There was a shadow
or outline of what appeared to be a masculine form. She said it stood a
few feet away from the end of the bed. Kirsten called out for my
Daughter. They both sat and just looked at this thing. The figure just
stayed there for about a 30 seconds and vanished. They flipped on the
lights and then <br>
they noticed that the phone jacks just stopped clicking.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Never again did the phone jacks click after that.<br>

Indian College<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; underdog_1001@yahoo.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
When I was in college, this was a primarily indian college, it was a
friday evening and I and a couple of other friends were going to join
others from the college primarily students who lived on <br>
campus since we mostly hung out together since we lived there; anywho,
we were going to join others who were already at the river
partying.&nbsp; I don't remember why we hadn't gone with the <br>
main group but it must have been about 10pm or later and already
dark.&nbsp; I and the other couple of people who were fixing to leave
lived on the ground floor, which was actually a little below <br>
ground. our windows were ground level and in our rooms head
level.&nbsp; while in one of the double rooms with a couple of the guys
telling them to hurry up or everyone would be drunk before we <br>
got there, we heard someone knocking on the window of their room.&nbsp;
It was one of our friends who was supposed to be at the party and he
looked totally sober, which if you knew him, was <br>
odd.&nbsp; We knew that he was one of the ones to go get the liquor and
beer and thus one of the first ones out there and we were sure he
started the celebration as soon as his feet hit the ground and wouldn't
stop till he hit "coma".&nbsp; He motioned us next door to the windows
in the common bathroom so we went over there.&nbsp; When we got there
he asked us to follow him out the windows <br>
to go to the party.&nbsp; Normally that would have been normal, that is
if it had of been after hours.&nbsp; Those bathroom windows were the
best exit and entrance points for the dorm for after hours.&nbsp; If
you didn't sign out for the night by a certain time you came and went
from there, or if you were sneaking girls into your room or back out
this was where you wanted to do it because they were the largest
windows on that floor and like I said ground level.&nbsp; As he
urgently motioned for us to follow him we just kind of looked at each
other and shrugged because it was still early enough to <br>
just walk out the front doors and not go wriggling out any windows. We
told him we'd be right out and then went up to the next floor and out
the doors.&nbsp; We couldn't find him and gave up <br>
after just a minute and went on to the party spot at the river. We
figured he had went on over to the girls dorms.&nbsp; When we got
there, there was a big&nbsp; bon fire and there he was sitting beside
it in the middle of everyone as drunk as a skunk.&nbsp; We asked how he
got back so fast and before us and also looked so sober when at the
dorms a couple of minutes ago.&nbsp; Everyone around him asked what we
were talking about because he had been there all evening.&nbsp;
everyone we asked&nbsp; said the same thing, he'd never left.&nbsp; The
other guys and me knew we had seen and spoken with <br>
what we thought was him but it wasn't.&nbsp; That was freaky.&nbsp; I've never figured out what happened.<br>

Rainier<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; underdog_1001@yahoo.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This took place shortly after I had turned 16.&nbsp; My dad was working
up in oregon and washington but was based out of rainier.&nbsp; I went
up to live with him I guess just to do something different.&nbsp; I was
used to being around the city type of atmosphere and it wasn't to <br>
long before I grew bored.&nbsp; (not that the oregon country girls in
that area didn't stir my blood, it's just that they mainly wanted to
waste their time getting high, or drunk, tipping cows, or shooting the
passing ships going down the columbia river.&nbsp; which I didn't mind
at that time I just missed the city lights or something)&nbsp; Anywho,
I'd been out partying with a friend and drove off the side of a
mountain, (another story which would take a while to go <br>
through), and I thought my dad was probably going to kill me anyway,
without benefit of blindfold and a last smoke, so I decided to
hitchhike back to oklahoma.&nbsp; Needless to say I <br>
lacked the understanding of just how far I was from oklahoma.&nbsp; My
new found compadre decided to go along because he had gotten in recent
trouble with his folks and wanted out of <br>
town too so we took off.&nbsp; somewhere between portland and the
dalles, on I-84, which was only a two lane at that spot, we were really
tired and looking for a place to sleep.&nbsp; By this time I had found
out that this hitch hiking thing wasn't for me, and it really should be
called,&nbsp; hike hike hike hike hike hike,hitch, hike hike hike
hike.&nbsp; Or something similar.&nbsp; And what seemed weird was&nbsp;
that out in the middle of no where the fences were really well kept, <br>
and I didn't want to get cut up climbing one.&nbsp; No houses, no
anything, but nice fences.&nbsp; who would have thunk it?!&nbsp;
anyway, we found a rather peevish looking fence about 3/4 of a mile
before a bend in the road.&nbsp; The moon was out and actually lit up
the area pretty well.&nbsp; there was about 3/4 of a mile behind us
from the last turn in the road and like I said about the same in front
of us before the next one.&nbsp; we were in a valley or what ever there
called that <br>
the road went through and it was really a beautiful site.&nbsp; just as
we were fixing to jump the fence a car came around the bend from in
front. of course it was to far off to see us when it rounded the bend
but we didn't want it to see us climbing the fence when it came abreast
of us, ( like the owners of the land were out cruising in the middle of
the night).&nbsp; The sides of the road in that area sloped down at a
very sharp rate and were gravel, at least on our side of the road, so
you didn't have to go far to be below the grade of the road and out of
site of passing motorist.&nbsp; It went down probably 15 feet though,
well below the road .&nbsp; come to <br>
think of it I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like that
since.&nbsp; just as we were sliding down the slope out of site I
caught site of something way down the road just this side of the curve,
the lights of the oncoming car caught it just as it was making the
curve. What ever it was went down the embankment on the opposit side of
the road from us.&nbsp; I asked my friend if he saw it and he said he
saw something.&nbsp; After the car passed we peeked over the top of <br>
the road and right when we started to climb back on to the roadway,
because we decided we didn't want to sleep in that area anyway,&nbsp;
we saw what appeard to be two guys pushing a <br>
motorbike climb up where we saw it go off before.&nbsp; This was still
about 3/4 of a mile at least off, down the hill near the curve.&nbsp;
We slid back down the slope out of site.&nbsp; I really don't know why,
then we kind of looked at each other.&nbsp; A motorbike? We both looked
at the incline behind us.&nbsp; If you pushed a motorbike off the side
of the road down this embankment you'd have a heck of a time stopping
it before it went all the way down, and the river was on their side,
and even a harder time getting back up.&nbsp; I couldn't imagine trying
to get it back up to the road, assuming it didn't go into the
river.&nbsp; We both peeked over the top breathing really quiet and
shallow watching for another couple of minutes <br>
when all of a sudden it stood up.&nbsp; it wasn't two guys pushing a
motorbike, it was something that had been on all fours and stood up and
it was huge.&nbsp; at least twice as tall as us, and by the way, we
weren't midgets.&nbsp; I almost shat myself.&nbsp; I started looking
around and the fence by this time was looking mighty small.&nbsp;
thinking really fast in that fight or flight mode, and the flight was
definetly the way I was leaning toward, I realized that, thank god it
had been his turn to carry the back pack which would slow him down and
had the only food we had in it, and on top of that I thought I could
out run him.&nbsp; Maybe it wouldn't want both of us.&nbsp; I <br>
looked at him, saw the panic in his eyes and knew he was thinking along
the same lines.&nbsp; I knew I couldn't run.&nbsp; I also knew that it
had to sense us when it got directly across from us.&nbsp; <br>
I pulled out my little pocket knife, and I think he pulled out a
fork.&nbsp; I knew then, we're going to die, and all I could think of
was lord please let it be quick.&nbsp;&nbsp; I peeked over the top
again and it was almost even with us.&nbsp; I might have whimpered,
silently of course, but I also noticed that the wind was blowing in my
face, from his direction.&nbsp; there might be hope.&nbsp; we ducked
back down and we could here it stop almost right across from us for a
moment or <br>
two, then start on up the road again.&nbsp; It was almost to the curve
up the hill from us from the direction we had originally came from when
another car came around the bend downhill.&nbsp; I thought about
jumping out in front of it and yelling for help but if it didn't stop
then what ever that was would know that we were there.&nbsp; We waited
and it dissappeard below the other side of the road like before when
the other car came.&nbsp; this time it didn't come back up.&nbsp; <br>
I don't know how long we waited but we finally climbed back up and
continued down the hill and around the curve.&nbsp; We didn't say a
word of breath anything about a whisper till we'd cleared that bend in
the road and was a mile or two away.&nbsp; When we got the "the dalles"
we called our parents to come and get us.&nbsp; We'd had enough of the
open road in oregon.&nbsp; I don't know what that was, but I still
think about it sometimes.&nbsp; I've had a few other things happen to
me in my life but that really scared me.<br>

Oakwood Harbor<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; underdog_1001@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
In the early 90's I lived in Oakwood harbor and the guard at the little
guard shack was a rather attractive tall slim woman and I happened to
pass by on several occasions late at night on her <br>
over night shift. One night, don't remember what day but it was a week
day in the summer time, This car came flying in off the highway (I-40)
and a guy jumped out and was all panicky and <br>
saying to call the police or someone, something was out by the bridge.
''which ran across Eufaula lake just west of lottawatta road on
I-40.&nbsp; I went with her because he really had me curious and <br>
we went the 1/4 of a mile to the bridge and there was several cars
parked on the side of the road.&nbsp; The people had gotten out of
their cars and was just standing on the shoulder looking up in a eerie
weird sort of way.&nbsp; we got out and looked at them each other and
then up. it took so long to look up because there was no noise or
anything until you did look up and then you could tell that there was a
black total void a good 100 yards across or more hanging in the sky.
The stars were all around it and the moon was bright enough to light up
the shore line as far as the eye could see but in that large spot there
was nothing. less than nothing. You could just tell. I was horrified in
a way that I couldn't recognize and still don't understand now. I don't
know how long we stood there but the next thing I knew it moved, slowly
started to lift and drift some and then just took off at an
unbelievable speed. Everyone came <br>
out of the trance like thing we were in and just got back into their
cars and left. When we got back to the Guard shack I just walked back
home (which was very close) and went to bed.&nbsp; We never talked
about that and as a matter of fact I don't recall if I ever spoke to
her again since she left for another state soon there after.&nbsp; I
started believing it was a dream. Now I'm not so sure. <br>
But I'd like to know.<br>

Carnton Plantation General<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sluggishfirewolf@yahoo.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
My family and I took a trip to Tennessee in the summer of '08. We went
to all over the place, such as Jackson and Nashville. On our second to
last day before we left to go back home, my <br>
family decided to go to Franklin, because we had picked up a brochure
of haunted places in Tennessee, and so we went to humor me because I
was interested in hauntings at the time. This <br>
city, not known to most people, is actually the sight of the bloodiest
battle of the Civil War- even worse than Gettysburgh. There are two
houses there that were main sights. One of them was the Carnton
Plantation, which is the setting to my story.&nbsp; <br>
The plantation was creepy enough when we drove up to it, without even
knowing the history. When I got out of the car I looked up at the house
and noted how beautiful it was. Then my <br>
attention was averted to the balcony on the second floor. There,
standing on it, was a man. He was clearly dressed in a Civil War
uniform, though I can't quite remember which color, and I could clearly
see that he had a beard covering his jawline. He stood there with his
arms behind him, as if he was gazing out overlooking troops. Of course
at the time, not knowing any of the history, I thought it was just a
tour guide taking a break out on the balcony. I even hoped he was going
to be my family's guide. Later, once we were on the tour, I noticed
that none of the <br>
employees were dressed like 19th century citizens.&nbsp; <br>
Of course then we got the history of the place and I understood why
this place was considered haunted. When the battle itself was both
going on and when it was over injured soldiers were <br>
treated inside of the house.So many, in fact, that there are stains of
blood inside of the house that will not come out of the floor. Many
soldiers, obviously, died inside of the house. When we continued our
tour upstairs where we entered a room with a door to the balcony. This
is where I learned that no one was allowed out on the balcony. This
confused me since I had seen that man out there. When the guide took
the group into the room across the hall and began talking I couldn't
pay attention. The closet&nbsp; in the other room kept grabbing my
attention because it had a piece of black cloth in it. Finally I tried
to keep myself focused, and it was going well until a gentleman in the
group got bored and decided to go out into the hall. I watched him
leave, thinking that he was very rude and should come back. For some
reason, when he left, I <br>
noted that the sun was in a position that didn't cast a shadow of the
man's head on the hallway wall. Once again I turned my attention back
to the guide but the man in the hallway began to <br>
wander in the hall and that distracted me. When I turned to watch the
man there was suddenly a very clear and defined silhouette of a man's
head and shoulders (with a bearded face) that traveled <br>
across the hallway wall then just disappeared. <br>
It startled me at first, then I got excited because I thought I must
have seen a ghost. Then I thought, "No I have to be practical about
this because that man is out in the hallway." Once the <br>
tour guide was done talking I went outside into the hallway way. The
first thing I noticed was that any shadow from the tourists on the wall
wasn't that dark or defined. Then I noticed that the way the sun was
facing caused the shadows to be cast on a completely different wall.
The silhoutte I saw couldn't have been from anyone on the tour.&nbsp; <br>
Then I noticed that there was an upstairs, where I thought maybe an
employee could be working. That theory was quickly dismissed when it
appeared no one was up there. <br>
There was no logical explanation for the silhoutte.&nbsp; <br>
It wasn't until my family returned home a few days later that I decided
to research what I had seen. After discovering that there was a
frequent spirit there that was called The General I made <br>
the connection. The details from past eye witness accounts were
identical to mine. He stands out on the porch, has a Civil War uniform
on, and has a beard on his face. I was and still am convinced that I
saw The General on that day. <br>

My Ghost Story<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bcowdry@charter.net<br>
<br>
Hi, my name's Christy C. first off, my bedroom is located in our
basement, and I was getting ready for vacation with my grandparents.
While I was packing, I found my mascara on my bed, which was kinda
weird because I always place it on my nightstand. Then when I was
packing, I put a pair of sweatpants into my duffel, after that I was
looking around for another shirt, or something like that. When I
returned to my duffel, my sweatpants looked like someone literally
threw them on the ground, where as I had them folded in my duffel bag.
After that, I went up stairs to get some thing to drink, and I felt
like I was being followed, even when I returned to my bedroom I still
had that feeling of someone watching me.&nbsp; I don't know if this is
a haunting, but it was kinda strange.<br>

Haunted House<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; musser46@rcn.com<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My sister rented a house in
New Caanan, Ct.&nbsp; It was the 2nd oldest house in the town.&nbsp;
The owners thrugh the years added on to the house.&nbsp; There was an
old section of the house that I slept in.&nbsp; I slept in three
different rooms when I encountered my
experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
first time I was w/my husband and we slept in this room facing the
front of the house next to the original staircase.(there are two).
During the night I kept getting woke up by slamming doors.&nbsp; In was
coming from the closet.&nbsp; It felt like people or ghosts were going
in and out of the
closet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
second time was me and my daughter came to visit and my daughter was
very young.&nbsp; There were two single beds in the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;
during the night&nbsp; I had woke up to three strong blows to my
bed.&nbsp; I checked on my daughter and notices she had peed the
bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third
time my sister had asked me to watch her son while they went somewhere
for a week.&nbsp; Everything went well except for one night we were in
my sister's bed and I woke up to someone saying "Hailey I love
you."&nbsp; I wasn't quite asleep yet.&nbsp; So that was very
weird.&nbsp; I was never scared in the house. Also the kids would
always want to play hide and seek in the old part. By the all way my
expierences were all around Thanksgiving vacation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also my
nephew would always have to sleep w/the dog. He felt it too.&nbsp; I
hear now that the house has been gutted to
renivate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

My Experience<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trishc@atmc.net<br>
<br>
I was 6 years old when this happened. i still remember it as if it just
happened last night.&nbsp; my mom had put me to bed around 8:30. but i
had trouble seeping, so it was on and off through the night. i remember
getting up for a glass of water and going back to my room around maybe
10. after that i fell back asleep for maybe 2 hours. and when i woke
up, there was a guy in my room.<br>
he was mildly transparent but i could make out very distinct details
about him. he was wearing brown pants and an old time white shirt. he
was a white male maybe in his early 30's and he had black hair that
was&nbsp; slighly receedng. he was facing towards my window and i was
looking at him from a side view, <br>
his right side to me. the room went cold and i remember being
scared.&nbsp; i asked him "are you ok?" and at this point he turned
fully towards me and i will never forget what i&nbsp; saw next.<br>
the left half of his face was rotting and part of his skull was
missing,&nbsp; revealing his partially exposed brain. but he didn't
look like he wanted to scare me, it was more like he was sad.<br>
i didn't feel threatened at all, i was just shocked at what i saw.<br>
i screamed and jumped up, running toward the door. i compleatly ran through him and in to my parents room shouting about a man <br>
in my room. alarmed, they went into my room and checked my room from
top to bottom.&nbsp; they didn't find anything.&nbsp; no evidence that
he had ever been there.&nbsp; come to find out, that the land i used to
live on was an indian burial ground.&nbsp; we had recently done
construction work on.&nbsp; i'm not 100% sure, but i think that the
land had something to do with this. sometimes we would find bones, but
my uncle hunted different things, so we&nbsp; always thought when we
found them that they were animal. maybe we were wrong.<br>

Personal Experience/Haunted Places<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; samanthasenior@hotmail.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>
I wasn't sure what to entitle this as the story I have is regarding my college, which is well known for being haunted. <br>
It's Hemsworth Arts and Community College in West Yorkshire, England.
The schools history can be traced back to the Doomsday Book of 1086 as
a small manor house and it was a manor house right up to 1921 when it
became Hemsworth Grammar School, then Hemsworth High School from the
60's onwards I believe then it became the college as it is now in 2001
I think. In the Georgian period, it was in its prime as a manor house.
It was from then the ghost of the school is meant to have came from:
The Blue Lady. Unfortunately, I am unaware properly of the story behind
her creation. There's two I have heard (But I can't be certain they are
true). These are: 1) The Blue Lady was a maid and she fancied the
gardener. He suggested that maybe they should run away together because
they couldn't get married (for some reason) but she refused so one day,
whilst she was getting some wine for the Master of the Hall, he hit her
over her head with a wine bottle, killing her. 2) That the Blue Lady is
the daughter of one of the Hall's owners and she committed suicide <br>
for some reason. Like I said, I cannot validate either story but they
are the ones I have heard. The Blue Lady haunts primarily the upper
corridors of the oldest part of our school but <br>
experiences have been reported in the other parts of the oldest
buildings on the campus. (I have experienced them too in other parts of
the campus along with other students). It is very common to hear of
people experiencing doors slamming on their own, cold drafts and foot
steps if you are up there on your own at night. Actually sightings of
the ghost however is uncommon. <br>
I know the occurrences are common in many ghost stories but the
regularity of these occurrences and the fact that these are experienced
by every single member of staff and every student has experienced
these, past and present, makes it all the more believable in my
opinion. I have experienced all of the above occurrences except
actually seeing the ghost. <br>

<br>
&nbsp;hi my name is branden&nbsp; i am form york last year me and my
cousin went to ray myers hallow we didnt know how to get there&nbsp; so
we asked at this rutters when we asked the lady behind the <br>
counter how to get there she said " we dont talk about that here" and
she would not tell us where to go so we just drove around and still
didnt find it well by that time&nbsp; it was late about 3am we <br>
went back to the rutters and asked a man behind the counter about
it&nbsp; he told&nbsp; us he didnt knwo but i really didnt beleave
him&nbsp; so i asked him again and he told us so we drove and we came
to a bridge the passed over 83 and there is a cematary&nbsp; with a
billborad&nbsp; in it as soon as we crossed the bridge the lights int
the sing went off&nbsp; then when we came up to the two churches&nbsp;

When I was 17 yrs old I was living with a teacher and I would stay home
alone at night often. So every night I would sit n living room and I
cud see a black shadow in the hall way going from room to room. They
had a dog and he would bark and growl at it the whole time but would
never go down the hall he was very frightened. I was so scared I
wouldn&#8217;t get off the couch.<br>

The Ghost Named "Bob"<br>
<br>
<br>

&nbsp;<br>
I&#8217;ve had some paranormal experiences throughout my life, but working at
a haunted business back in 2003 made me a true believer in the
supernatural.&nbsp; My first ghostly experience happened on my third
day of employment&nbsp; in Santa Ana, CA.&nbsp; I was in the back stock
room looking for my timecard to swipe and heard three boot-like steps
walk up behind me.&nbsp; I felt a male presence peering over my
shoulder as if he wanted to see what my name was on my timecard.&nbsp;
I swiped my card in such a way that he could see it and went to turn
around to introduce myself, <br>
but no one was there.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t until a week later after another
new employee had had their first experience that I learned the place
was haunted by a ghost that past workers had named &#8220;Bob&#8221;.&nbsp; Some
people would leave at that point, but it intrigued me enough to stay
part-time for another year and I had many more experiences over that
period of time. Bob loved to stay in the men&#8217;s restroom back in the
stock room area.&nbsp; He would constantly turn the faucet on full
blast.&nbsp; One time I heard it on, so I went to go turn it off.&nbsp;
I opened the door and went to turn on the light, but I heard him
murmuring in there.&nbsp; So with my foot keeping the door pried open,
I jokingly said, &#8220;Bob, you know you&#8217;re supposed to conserve
water.&nbsp; Please turn it off.&#8221;&nbsp; Well, he actually did!&nbsp;
It&#8217;s one of those stiff turning kind too, but I heard him turn it off
until there <br>
was no more than a trickle of water coming out.&nbsp; Needless to say, I nervously thanked him and took off!&nbsp; <br>
He also loved to open and close the restroom doors.&nbsp; When I worked
back in the cash office I would always hear them opening and closing,
but no one would ever come out.&nbsp; The door handle to <br>
my office would shake as well, but when I&#8217;d go to look at the security
camera monitors to see if someone wanted something, no one was
there.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t until about six months later that I actually saw
him one night while the store was closed.&nbsp; I <br>
was straightening up an end-cap and felt someone staring at me.&nbsp; I
looked to my left down the aisle towards the wine section and there he
was staring right back at me!&nbsp; At first I thought it was a <br>
customer who didn&#8217;t get out of the store before we locked the doors,
but then I realized that I could see the wine racks through him!&nbsp;
He was an older balding man and was wearing blue jean overalls and what
looked like a long-sleeve flannel shirt.&nbsp; We just stared at each
other for about a minute and then he vanished.&nbsp; I told another
co-worker that I had seen him and our descriptions of him matched
perfectly!<br>
He did many things while I worked there&#8230; he pushed one co-worker over
and grabbed another co-worker&#8217;s shoulders.&nbsp; I felt him around me
numerous times, but he never seemed mean.&nbsp; I always felt that he
just wanted to see what I was doing or wanted to let someone know that
he was there.&nbsp; I noticed that the more we talked about him, the
more things he would do to get our attention.&nbsp; At one point I was
sweeping a back breakroom floor and he started to swing one of the
clipboards on the wall to get my attention (he did this to another girl
a week prior and she quit) and I angrily told him to stop, reminded him
that he was dead, didn&#8217;t belong there, that I was just doing my job and
didn&#8217;t need to be scared while doing it, and that he really needed to
go towards the light.&nbsp; Looking back on that I have to laugh&#8230; I
guess the broomstick I was holding gave me new found confidence, not
that it would have helped me any though with him being a ghost and
all.&nbsp; lol&nbsp; Any way, the clipboard stopped swaying and he
left, but he didn&#8217;t leave permanently.&nbsp; He just stayed a little
further away from me after that, but I could always tell that he was
there watching what I was doing.&nbsp; I wonder if the current
employees are still having issues with him?&nbsp; If so, I wonder why
he&#8217;s stuck there and won&#8217;t leave?<br>

Haunted Home<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; mrvowell@paragould.net<br>
<br>
I've lived in my house for about 3 years now, and I've thought from the
day we moved in that it was haunted, or at least really creepy. It's an
older home (built in 1952). The couple that built it, lived in it until
the man died sometime in the late 90's (In the house,I believe), then
his widow lived here alone until her son decided she needed to be
closer to him, so he sold the house (to me), and we moved in. I have
seen things out of the corner of my eye. We had a cat that pretty much
went crazy living here, and just weird feelings. The most annoying
thing is when things will<br>
disappear from a spot that I KNOW I put them only to turn up in that
exact spot, minutes, hours, or sometimes days later. The most recent
event was just this past weekend. My 16 year old step daughter had been
here for the summer but it was time <br>
for her to go back home. She gathered up all of her belongings and we
all got in the car to head out on the 5 hour road trip to take her
home. At the last minute she realized that she had left<br>
her wallet in the house so she ran in to get it. Only it was no where
to be found. We all got out of the car and came into the house and
searched and searched the entire house. We emptied clothes baskets
looked under couch cushions, Moved furniture...everything. We looked
for it for nearly 2 hours. The wallet was no where to be found. We then
assumed that she had left it in the car earlier in the day and that
someone had <br>
walked by and helped themselves to it. We don't live in the greatest
neighborhood, so this was a feasible explaination. There was nothing we
could do about it at that point so, we headed off to take her home,
talking nearly the entire way about how brazen someone had to be to
take it out of our car in broad daylight, but still convinced that was
the case. My husband, myself and our 5 year old returned home the next
day and I still just couldn't get the idea out of my head that the
wallet had to be somewhere in <br>
the house. So I looked some more, and everytime I went into a room I
would move stuff around and just do a "sweep" of the area to see if it
turned up. It did not. Until two days later. I walked in the front door
from work at around 4:30 pm. and right in the middle of the coffee
table sticking out from under a hat (that had not been on the table at
all the day the wallet was originally missing)<br>
was the wallet. It was sticking out enough for me to see it, so I know
if it had been there originally I would have noticed it. I had been
home sometime around noon for lunch that same day and the wallet was
not there, and NO ONE else had been home all day. I was the last one to
leave that morning and the first one to <br>
get home that evening. Let me tell you, it totally creeped me out. My
theory is that our ghost took a liking to my step daughter and didn't
want her to leave so he hid the thing he knew she would not want to
leave without. Everyone (even ghosts I suppose) know <br>
that 16 year old girls do not like to part with their wallets which
contain two of the most important things in life.....money, and a
drivers license.<br>

Haunted Trailer<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ghostmagnet1975@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
i thought i would send this in for your page .first, i have had
problems with ghosts all my life,i say problems because i have never
had a "good experience" with a ghost. i have lived in this <br>
trailer for the last 9 months. and for the last 4 have had nothing but
problems. that i admit i might have brought some on myself. it started
by locking the bathroom door, with no&nbsp; one in it,except i <br>
saw shadows under the door and no one ever came out so i tried the knob
an ended up that no one was in there.i guess he used the bathroom an
then unlocked the door. then almost everyone <br>
here has heard people calling their name with no one there. then my son
has seen someone walking real fast from the hallway past him into the
kitchen. then this is what i mean by bring it on myself,me an my son an
soon to be daughter in law got a <br>
deck of cards then we "told the ghost" we were using black for no an
red for yes,we asked alot of questions and got yes an no answers, we
figured ok it was just us an the cards so we asked the same questions
again an got the same answers,one question being was he trying to scare
my daughter,answer was no. then we asked do you come in her room when
she is not in it answer <br>
was no and she is the only one that never gets scared by him. by the
way we asked if it was man or woman. it keeps getting worse and worse.
these last few days alone he has called my daughter <br>
in laws name,whispered at me 2 times,but so fast i couldnt understand
him,walked by a mirror,messed with my comp. screen in a way i have
never seen, made a noise beside my comp <br>
which made all the dogs bark but we could not figure what noise it
was(never in my life heard that before) sounded like a doorbell and a
foghorn mix) we found out he killed himself in the <br>
house. though newspaper files. which scares the crap out of me.also
yesterday my daughter in law was laying on the couch half asleep an she
said she saw a little girl or boy with black hair an a girl with blond
hair walk into the kitchen,she asked me if my daughter an one of her
friends came in but they were at her friends house. then i walked by
the heater in the hallway ,which has vents on the wall, i could have
swore i saw a man with black hair looking at me from inside the heater
vent. i flew in the bedroom an made my son put a cover over the vent.
one of my sons thinks i am nuts,my husband said it never bothers him
but he don't think i am lying because we have had a ghost in another
place an he DID see those.even the dogs bark ,they will be sitting
staring at the hallway or a certain spot in the living room an just
howl or bark. i don't know what else to do.so i am looking for another
place. if anyone wants to talk about spirits or have any ideas email
me.also i have many more experiences with haunted houses/trailers an
other things i will write later.<br>

Haunted Victorian<br>
<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; julie.ohmert@citi.com<br>
<br>
I grew up in rural Missouri, in a small town, the last of four girls.
My mother went to an Assembly of God church and I was taught at a young
age, that God and the devil were very real, and spirits of all kinds
dwelt among us. I was the youngest of four girls and there was seven
years between myself and my next sister. .<br>
I left home at seventeen, and by the age of 23, I had a 4 yr.old and a
newborn. I was dead set, that my husband of one year, and I were going
to have a nice house. We bought a delapidated trailor with one acre and
set about saving for our dream home. We both worked and after four
years of <br>
scraping/saving, every penny, we finally had enough for a down payment on our dream home.<br>
&nbsp; We started our search, looking at a lot of homes that were new
and pre-owned. We had collected antiques from auctions and various
sales. What we really wanted was a charming little house that we could
display all of our "finds".<br>
Then one spring day in 1988, we visited one of our local real estate
offices when we had found the perfect home. We thought it was out of
our price range, but to our amazement and after a little bit of
haggling we closed the deal. It was a three story Victorian that needed
a little TLC and some elbow grease to make it shine. Complete with a
three seater outhouse/hourse barn in the back. It was in what was the
oldest subdivision in the town of Troy Mo. <br>
Purched on a hill and used to be surrounded by a small farm. Now the
school was a block away and it only had one house next door that was
older on that street. Long ago the couple that lived in the older home,
built mine, for their daughter in 1894.<br>
When we finally got the keys, it was like moving into a hotel. <br>
Everything we owned fit into the dining room. There were no curtains on
the windows and only some had shades. Voices would actually echo when
you spoke. It looked like a spooky old house and it took some
convencing, to reassure my 7 yr. old, that there was nothing to fear.<br>
It wasn't two weeks before the first occurance happened. We had bought
a grandfather clock that sat in our livingroom. It was set to "gong" on
every hour and chime on every half hour. That night we a slight storm.
After living in a trailor all those years it was amazing that we
couldn't here it but could see the trees swaying in our curtainless
windows. We had all just went to bed and my daughter called, "Mommy, is
that you in the doorway"? We all left our doors open because I didn't
want her to be afraid, and her voice carried clear as day into my
bedroom. The hair stood up on the back of my neck. I was struggling to
answer her. I am ashamed to say, I was too scared to get up. I just
said,"No, baby, mommy is in bed, it's probably just my robe hanging on
the back of my bedroom door". I knew it wasn't. It was just hard to
think that I could actually have a ghost in the house that I was in
love with.<br>
&nbsp;Jess, my daughter had many experences. My husband and I had none.
Jess had what was called, the maids quarters, off her bedroom. It was
located right above the kitchen and was said at one time to have a
staircase that ran down to it. She would complain that the light would
be on when she went to bed <br>
and then again in the middle of the night or in the morning when she
woke. For the longest time I thought they had forgotten and left it on
since they both played in there. It was a toy room.<br>
&nbsp;We would all see shadows. Little movement out of the corner of
your eye. Why is it that we brushed it all off as nothing. A figment of
the imagination. Lights that would turn on, doors that would
unlock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As time went by, we
all came to accept the little quirks our house/ghost had to dish out.
Nothing harmful happened. Here are just a few examples of who/how some
relatives came to believe......<br>
It was Thankgiving and I had all the family over to celebrate the day.
My rooms where large and we had a large pocked door that opened to
expand the space. My niece was in her mid to late twentys, she hung out
late,talking and helping me clean up. We had just spent about five
grand fixing up the (fireplace) bedroom with a colossel canapy bed,
couch, entertainment center, <br>
luxery curtains and linen. I must say it was beautiful. The next
morning with bags under her eyes she announced that never again would
she stay in our house. She woke in the night with a amber light moving
in front of the fireplace. The only words to explain it, is that it was
dancing. She wasn't scared and she went back to sleep. Then a few hrs.
later something was pulling <br>
the covers over her body. She jumped up and ran to the door and it
wouldn't open. The knob just turned in her hand. Finally she got out
and didn't go back to bed. Her 8 yr.old daughter that was in bed w/her
slept right through it.&nbsp; <br>
Years later, my sister was on hard times. She came to live w/me. The
spare room was the "fireplace" room. She announced that she didn't
believe in ghost so there would be no problem. I was working the
3-midnight shift when I recieved a call. It was my sister-could I come
home right away!! After calming her down she said she experienced a
glowing in the room by the fireplace. It <br>
made her bed vibrate. I told her I could not come home. When my shift
was over, I arrived home to her holding a bible and a crusifix
(spelling??). It took her several days before she decided no ghost was
going to take her room. She would talk to her and tell it to leave it
alone.&nbsp; You might wonder why I always refer to the ghost as she.
Jess was 10 and my son was 6. They were sitting on the couch one
evening and saw the ghost walking down the hall, past the livingroom
and out the front door. She wore a long dress not poofy and her hair
was up. When they were grown I asked them if <br>
it was true- Did they actually see it- both of them said they saw the
exact same thing. Sometimes I think she didn't let me see her cause I
would have demanded to move or maybe childern are more perceptive.
There are many more stories about my old house. We lived there for 18
years. My childern grew up there. One neighbor who had lived across the
street for 67 yrs. told me things. Why I personally didn't experience
more, I don't know. I <br>
firmly believe the "she ghost" existed. One family member told me there
were two. I don't know. Just.... next time your son or daughter tell
you things, maybe you should take it in and try hard to believe them. I
wish I had...............<br>
I didn't want to get to long winded. There is so much more to tell. I
would appreciate it if you wouldn't use my e-mail address since it is
my work e-mail. Please don't print it. Thanks for the web site and the
stories. Before the internet it was hard to hear of things that
happened to ordinary people.<br>

Stories from Rockford, IL<br>
<br>
By: griffen55@gmail.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Born and Raised in Rockford, I went to East High school and was a tech
theater student.&nbsp; I got to know Haddy pretty well actually, During
one performance.. I forget the name of the play.. I saw a bright
yellow/white orb running through the grid, well above the stage where
there are no lights.&nbsp; Another instance we we're doing a different
play alltogether.&nbsp; And of course we had our two casts.. our main
cast was perfect.. but the understudies... well.. to be kind they
sucked, and Haddy didn't like that very much... Lots and lots of
banging and pounding and things being thrown about in our costume shop
which is in the upper balcony and always kept locked.&nbsp;&nbsp; And
Twin Sisters... that place used to be pretty wild, just over the trees
you can see the cross from a church on one of our main roads.. gives it
a real creepy feeling.. but as of recently <br>
everytime we've been there the activity, or even the feelings have been almost nill..<br>

Sweet Hollow Road&nbsp; Huntington Long Island New York<br>
<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; medic5329@optonline.net<br>
<br>
3 or 4 years ago this happened and it still spooks me out.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I used to give blood in Melleville Long Island, at the LI Blood Supply
place.&nbsp; It ws near Sweet Hollow Road so when I went to give the <br>
blood I would cruise SHR [Sweet Hollow
Road].&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My 2 daughters , one a
senior in High School and the other a freshamn at the time, wanted to
go down the road so bad so one night I took them.&nbsp; It had snowed
and the fields were totally covered with snow but the road was pretty
clear so off we went.&nbsp; By the cemetery, past the underpass and
sown to Mount Misery Road via Chichester Road.&nbsp; About 3 house down
Chichester Road my oldest started talking ina strange monotone, no
inflection just flat as if a computer talk.&nbsp; She told me of a
child drowning in the house and when I asked how she knew she was
confused , maybe in school or in the papers, she never read the
news.&nbsp;&nbsp; She could not see the little pond or lake at the
corner of SHR and Chichester as it was night and covered in snow, I saw
it driving in the daylight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We got to Mt
Misery and I went down to the end and while doing a U Turn my oldest
said she saw a bear in the woods with glowing eyes.&nbsp; There have
not been a bear in this section of NY for decades.&nbsp; I went to get
out and look when they both got very upset.&nbsp; I had finished the U
Turn so I wnet to go back and do another U Turn.&nbsp; I went to the
end again and did a third U Turn, this time my younger daughter said
she saw a walking doll with glowing eyes, agauin I went to get out and
they got panicky so I said we'd go home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I
turned back onto SHR from Chichester all flet fine then I got a spooky
feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <br>
woods looked strange, I am an ex paramedic so we lived on observation
and I am no slacker to doing a survey of the area.&nbsp; I had been
down this road 10 times or more before and knew it well <br>
but tonight it felt foreign.&nbsp; The ride to the Underpass is about a
10 - 15 minute ride but feeling spooked I pushed the speed a bit,&nbsp;
I was speeding but getting no where, the field looked strange <br>
and time had slowed down.&nbsp;&nbsp; I kept getting more spooked and
drove faster.&nbsp; I was doing aroundd 75 MPH down the road and it
felt like I was going 30.&nbsp; The landmarks I used were not there,
the bridge was not coming up.&nbsp; Now I was flying with the girls
crying and asking when we will be off the orad.&nbsp; I didn't say a
word, just drove faster and faster.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After around a
half an hour I then saw the large yellow reflective sign for the
overpass and as soon as I saw the markers time seemed to get back to
normal.&nbsp;&nbsp; The drive home was uneventful but that time on SHR
is indellibly etched in my mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have taken many
photos of SHR and the overpass and every time I take one it has
something in it like orbs etc..&nbsp;&nbsp; I have taken photos with
different cameras and still get the strange orbs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Many say the 1 mile leading from NY Route 110 to the overpass is the
most haunted, they don't go further because people live there and they
do not want to disturb the living nut for me this is the strangest. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also have a photo with one of the SHR Shadow
People, he is a black shadow of a many with a 1600-1700s black hat in
his hand.&nbsp;&nbsp; People say maybe it is the shadows of the trees
and the <br>
woods yet if you look at the area above the hat, in his&nbsp; right
hand and the coresponding point on the left there appears to be a white
cuff below the jacket.&nbsp; Both hand areas as if drawn in.&nbsp; He
is <br>
&nbsp;similar to the other peoples shadow people on SHR and I would put
the hatr and clothes at around late 1600 or early 1700s and in the
style of the puritans or Quakers.&nbsp; Oh by the way the Quakers were
big in this area at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If wever in
the3 area take a run down SHR from Route 110 to Jerricho Tpk and make
the trip <br>
to Mt. Misery via Chichesater Road [north side ] or via Old Country
Road [this is the next block after SHR going west].&nbsp; Take photos
under the overpass fo the walls.&nbsp; </big><br>
