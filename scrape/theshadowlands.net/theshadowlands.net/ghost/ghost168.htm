<b>Neighborly Haunting</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: dormay2@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>It was in the mid-summer of 99. One sun. morn. I was on the computer
when I</b>
<br><b>thought I heard a gun shot. I looked out the window but didn't see
anything.</b>
<br><b>A few hours later the police and an ambulance arrived at my neighbors
house</b>
<br><b>across the street. All the neighbors were gathered in front of my
house so I</b>
<br><b>went outside to find out what happened and was told that the man
across the</b>
<br><b>street from me was found with a bullet in his head. To this day
no one knows</b>
<br><b>whether he committed suicide or was murdered. The night of the day
he was</b>
<br><b>laid to rest strange things started happening in my home. I would
wake up to</b>
<br><b>find my livingroom light on, one night I was standing in my kitchen
when it</b>
<br><b>came on. This went on untill one night I got angry and yelled at
it to stop</b>
<br><b>and it did, but then I'd wake up and my computer monitor would be
on and</b>
<br><b>this still happens. Also I have a cell phone which I turn off each
night to</b>
<br><b>charge,I wake in the mornings and it would also be on. Just recently
I had</b>
<br><b>the charger sitting right in front of me and I turned the phone
off and set</b>
<br><b>it in the cradle, it came right back on. I repeated this three or
four times</b>
<br><b>in a row and each time it came back on. I finally told it to stop
it and it</b>
<br><b>stayed off.</b>

<p><b>Ghost Cat</b><b></b>

<p><b>I have no practical proof of this, but...... my white 2 year old
cat disappeared, and my husband said he thought he seen it up on a road
close to our house, dead in the road of course... well now we see the (ghost)
of our white cat everyday at dinner time.&nbsp; We have an all black cat,
and when he goes to our laundry room at feeding time at night, we see the
white cat walking back and forth in front of the laundry room door, as
if he is waiting his turn to go in and eat dinner.&nbsp; We thought for
the longest time that it was just (our) imagination, but we now have a
roommate that says he also can see the cat, and</b>
<br><b>lots of times you'll be sitting here in our house and see a white
shadow out of the corner of your eye, and I have had the sensation of a
cat jumping up on my bed at night also....Anyway... Just something kinda
creepy I thought I would share.&nbsp; I</b>

<br><b>Ghosts of germantown!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: baxley@wfeca.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I would like to tell you of the ghost of Mary Buth. I lived in Germantown
Wisconsin from age 9 to 16. I had two older brothers who used to enjoy
nothing more than to see me curl up in the floor board of the car.First
of let me tell you I was on none believer, Yet a scardey cat! One night
my brothers and some of there friends decided to go to this old house.
Known very well as Mary Buth. Located on a road called Lovers lane.I was
not aware of the story at this time. That night there were many of us so
we had to take several cars. I was placed in a car with 3 guys. When we
turned onto the road the house was on. You could see the police tape all
over the trees and the drive way was blockaded. There was&nbsp; a field
next to the house that went back to a thick tree line. I was already scared
and thought this was stupid. So I was rushing them to do what they came
to do and to go home. The mocho football player type guys wanted to into
the house. I didn't so all the guys went into the but one guy stayed with
me in the car. We drove up and down the road incase police would come buy.
When all the sudden the guy driving the car stopped in the middle of the
rode. He seemed to be in a trans of some sort. He was gazing out the window
next to me on the passenger side. When I turned my head to see what he
was looking at. I seen a little white glowing oval shape that was way back
by the tree line. It was moving towards us. Very fast. I was screaming
like a maniac. But the guy was out of it. Finally I did all I knew to do.
I reached my foot over to the gas pedal. He quickly came thru and began
yelling at me for almost killing him. Mean while the guys were still in
the house. I didn't want to go back and get them. So we waited far down
the road. The next thing we knew all the guys were running down the road.
We quickly went a picked them up. They said they never made it into the
house. But while they were trying to enter a woman appeared in the window.
We decided to see if the figure would come back from the woods again. After
sitting there for a long amount of time we decided to leave. We started
the car up. And to our amazment it did appear. But this time it was right
at the car</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;window looking at us. I have never been so frieghtend in my
whole life. I was closest to the window. I quick got into the floor board
. Praying god to get us out of there fast. But as I was down in the floor
and the guys screaming like girls. I dont think I have ever seen a woman
so beautiful or sad before. She had tears on her cheeks and was wearing
a long white gown. She glowed like a christmas tree. And to this day. I
still dream about that night. I have found out a lot on that haunting.
It seams that that night there was 2 ghosts. One on the outside of the
house and one on the inside. I never went back to that place. In fact I
convinced my parents to move south. I have now been living in Florida for
the last 6 years.But it seems she is still with me in some ways!!!</b>

<br><b>He Called my name... Johanna</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JEEZABEL25@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I was about six years old when I first encountered ,my&nbsp; ghost.&nbsp;
I was up late</b>
<br><b>watching some t.v.shows. At the time my parents were in the military,
so we</b>
<br><b>lived in military housing. Unfortunately I don't remember what base
it was.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, I felt as though someone were watching me, thinking it was
my mother</b>
<br><b>I turned around and called to her....nobody answered. I turned back
around</b>
<br><b>and continued to watch the show. Not ten minutes later I felt the
strange</b>
<br><b>eyes on me again and this time I turned around to face a figuare
made of the</b>
<br><b>shadows itelf and burning red eyes. It moved slightly from the dark
in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen and sort of leaned over mouthing something I couldn't hear.
Then it</b>
<br><b>was gone. Needless to say that was the last time I stayed up late
by myself.</b>
<br><b>Some years later at anthor post , My parents had told me I was too
young to</b>
<br><b>remember , but we were haunted even then. My small black and white
color</b>
<br><b>television set used to turn on and off&nbsp; byself during times
when I was</b>
<br><b>asleep.</b>
<br><b>Some years later,&nbsp; I was about&nbsp; eleven and we had moved
to a new</b>
<br><b>base...Howard AFB, Panama. (Which was given back to the Panamains
in 98 I</b>
<br><b>think). It was 11:00 pm and I had just finished unpacking. I grabbed
a book</b>
<br><b>and settled in bed. When I heard this scratching noise coming from
my</b>
<br><b>window...at first I ignored it knowing that Panama has bats and
some tend to</b>
<br><b>nest in the houses. The noise continued two more times, what to
see them I</b>
<br><b>looked out my window to see the same black figure with burning red
eyes ,</b>
<br><b>that I saw years before.&nbsp; Only this time I could hear what
it said, "</b>
<br><b>Johanna"&nbsp; He knew my name , he called my name. Then he walked
down the</b>
<br><b>sidewalk and disappeared in to the shadows.&nbsp; Some years later
, I was 17 I</b>
<br><b>was talking to my aunt about this and she that some people can see
angels and</b>
<br><b>others can see demons. To this I firmlly believe that is what I
saw.&nbsp; I have</b>
<br><b>tales of true hauntings which I'll sumbit at a later date. In the
meantime</b>
<br><b>...what do you think it was I saw all those years ago .</b>

<br><b>My Brother..I Hope</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lizi1desi2@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've been a believer of ghosts since I was about 9 or 10 yr's. old,&nbsp;
when I came across my first encounter with a ghost.I was staying over night
at my aunts house and myself and 3 of my cousin's were sleeping out in
the livingroom on the couch, floor etc., I slept on the floor and for some
reason I woke up, just tossing and turning and noticed a tall man standing
in front of the dining room table, very still, hands at his side, his face
darkened, he worn a dark suit and just watched over us, I laid there scared
stiff and never took my eyes off him then as the light was coming in threw
the big livingroom window with a blink of an eye he was gone. Some time
later at that same home which was an old farm house, I looked out the window
one night while my cousins and i were playing pool and there down in a
field area next to there land was a saucer like object with colored lights
all around, I walked away from the window and never said a word about it
until years later.As an adult later on&nbsp; I had something grab me and
I&nbsp; turned&nbsp; to see nothing there, That was about it ,until I lost
my only brother who died suddenly at the age of 38 yrs. old. My mom , dad,
and myself had phones going dead while were talking to someone, I was waking
up each night at 4:03am and one night I had just turned off the tv at 4am
and turned over to fall asleep when I heard my roommate I thought sneak
in and come to my bedside table to get a cigerette, I lived upstairs at
the time so I waited for my roommate to get a smoke and I then opened my
eyes to see nothing there and yet the floor creaked</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;and walked towards the side along my bed and it stopped at
my head. My brother had passed in the bathroom with water&nbsp; running
and my dad, still gets out of nowhere his phone answering machine a message
when no one has called he gets a message with only running water, doors
open without help, a photo of my brother, just his face is in the bottom
of the dish sink thats filled with water and yet its on the bottom, not
floating and it did not go down the drain it came to my hand and no one
knows how it ended up there. There was so many other things that happened
in the first months and now</b>
<br><b>a year and ahalf later hardly nothing.</b>

<br><b>My Haunted House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: palpn13@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Cari and I am a nurse from Pittsburgh PA.&nbsp; I decided
to do some research about ghosts and spirits after some strange things
have been happening at my new house.&nbsp; I have lived here less than
a year and I've had many unexplained things happen here.&nbsp; My email
address is palpn13@yahoo.com.&nbsp; Thank for listening.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of days after moving into my new
house, I took my kids to school and when I came home I decided to go back
to sleep instead of finishing the unpacking.&nbsp; I had only been lying
there for a couple of minutes when I heard someone walking up and down
the attic steps.&nbsp; Thinking that my Aunt had come over to help me finish
unpacking, I got up to go help her.&nbsp; I called her name but she didn't
answer.&nbsp; I went to the attic door but the door was locked from the
outside.&nbsp; Not knowing what it was I chalked it up to new house noises.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few weeks later I was lying on the couch
one evening after the kids had gone to bed, watching television when I
saw a shadowy figure walk across the kitchen doorway and pass through.&nbsp;
I got up to look but there was no one there.&nbsp; A couple of days later
my Aunt was watching the kids and told me that she was watching television
and saw someone in the kitchen walking around, she thought it was my brother,
although she had not heard him come in, and she got up to go talk to him
but there was no one there.&nbsp; She didn't mention this to me for about
a week after it happened.&nbsp; In the meantime I had been hearing other
strange noises like someone walking in the attic, and up and down the hallway.&nbsp;
I had never told any one about any of my experiences so far because I was
skeptical and sure that there was some other explanation for this.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Aunt then mentioned to me about&nbsp;
her strange experience in the kitchen.&nbsp; I just got chills because
I had seen the same thing and that's when I told her about everything else
I had experienced.&nbsp; She already believed in ghosts and spirits, but
I did not, although I was starting to believe.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after moving in my four year old started
having an imaginary friend that she played with in her room.&nbsp; I thought
this was sort of out of character for her, but I thought that I may have
had to do with the move.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many other little things started happening
but they didn't seem menacing.&nbsp; At Christmas we invited over some
people that have lived behind us for 16 years.&nbsp; I didn't tell them
what had been happening, because I didn't want them to think I was crazy,
but I still wanted to find out some history about the house.&nbsp; They
said they think an old woman named Agnes had lived here but she died.&nbsp;
They are not sure if she died in the house or in the hospital though.&nbsp;
Then after Agnes another couple bought the house but the wife died of cancer
very young, like 36 or something.&nbsp; She died in the hospital but she
had loved the house very much.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After those people left I started thinking
about my daughter and her imaginary friend so I asked her about it.&nbsp;
She said her friend was a lady like me.&nbsp; I asked what they did.&nbsp;
She said they played in her room.&nbsp; I asked her where she went when
they were done playing and she said she flies down the steps.&nbsp; This
gave me chills because my daughter is a very serious child and doesn't
usually make things like this up.&nbsp; Her friend stopped coming to see
her soon after this.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything stopped for awhile.&nbsp; Then
one morning I went into the living room and turned on the switch for the
overhead light but it didn't go on.&nbsp; It was then that I found that
someone had turned the light out by the switch on the ceiling fan.&nbsp;
My brother had been staying with me and I made a mental note to remind
him to turn the light out by the wall switch.&nbsp; Later that evening,
I mentioned it to him but he said he hadn't touched it.&nbsp; That's when
he asked me why I was moving boxes at 2:30am.&nbsp; I said that I wasn't.&nbsp;
He was staying in the basement game and said that he had just gone to bed
when he heard someone come in the front door, drop what sounded like boxes
on the floor then back out and close the door.&nbsp; Whoever this thing
was, it was back.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started hearing noises again and one
night the cat went behind the nightstand, hissed at nothing, then ran out
of the room.&nbsp; Another time I felt something sit on the side of my
bed while I was trying to sleep, but when I turned over there was nothing
there.&nbsp; Another time I was cleaning the kitchen floor and the kitchen
was pretty chilly, but when I reached for something on the counter I put
my arm through this intense heat.&nbsp; It was just a small area of heat
because my arm was could on either side except for the middle where the
heat was.&nbsp; Then again after that, there was nothing for awhile.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then one night I came home from work very
late, at midnight, and my Aunt was on the verge of hysterics.&nbsp; All
of the lights were on in the house and she was crying.&nbsp; When she calmed
down she told me that she had just finished the dishes around 11pm and
she went into the living room to sit and watch the news when she saw this
bright purple glowing figure peak out from around the dining room wall.&nbsp;
It then stretched out it's arms and started floating into the living room
toward her.&nbsp; She was paralyzed with fear but managed to run outside.&nbsp;
When she came back in the figure was gone.&nbsp; A couple of weeks after
that I came home late again and I was talking to her when the light above
the sink in the kitchen went out.&nbsp; I turned to ask her if she saw
that and the light went back on.&nbsp; I went in and shook the light thinking
that maybe the bulb was loose or there was a short but it didn't go out
again.&nbsp; After this I went next door to talk to my other neighbors
about the happenings.&nbsp; They said that the people who lived there before
me described some of the same things I have.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to look on the web for some help,
when I was home recently and I heard what sounded like heavy furniture
being dragged across the floor upstairs.&nbsp; The cat heard it too because
he ran to the steps but wouldn't go up.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my strange experiences.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Legend of the Ghostly Lantern Light</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: NovemberGirl22@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;This is a true story about a mysterious ghostly light that
appears on some</b>
<br><b>railroad tracks that I myself and other people who live here that
I know have</b>
<br><b>also witnessed themselves. It all started when I was in the first
grade at my</b>
<br><b>school that our class went on a field trip to this playground in
another</b>
<br><b>nearby city here and at that time, we rode a train to the station
to get to</b>
<br><b>this playground on our field trip. I remember when it was time for
us to go</b>
<br><b>back home, our teacher rounded up all the kids in my class to get
ready so we</b>
<br><b>would not miss our train back home. We were standing at the station
on a</b>
<br><b>platform and I, my teacher and my class kept seeing from a distance
down the</b>
<br><b>train tracks, a flickering light. This was late in the afternoon
and it was a</b>
<br><b>cloudy day and the light would flicker on and off for awhile then
stop only</b>
<br><b>to continue to flicker again. The teacher thought it must be the
light of our</b>
<br><b>train that was soon to come but this flickering light did not move,
it just</b>
<br><b>stayed in one place on the railroad tracks but it was too far away
down the</b>
<br><b>tracks for us to figure out what it was. This light continued for
at least I</b>
<br><b>would say for about a half an hour and I remember us all standing
there</b>
<br><b>thinking our train was on it's way but the train was late and the
mysterious</b>
<br><b>light that was flickering stopped way before our train arrived.
I told my</b>
<br><b>brother about it and he was not a bit surprised because he himself
had</b>
<br><b>witnessed this flickering light at this same train station and some
of his</b>
<br><b>friends. One of his friends was skeptical about it and they decided
to drive</b>
<br><b>out there to this now old train station and they parked near the
train tracks</b>
<br><b>and waited for awhile and sure enough, they both saw this strange
flickering</b>
<br><b>light that night and his friend became a believer but they couldn't</b>
<br><b>understand what this was. We found out later as years went by that
other</b>
<br><b>people who had witnessed this light said that a long time ago, a
man was out</b>
<br><b>walking with a lantern one night by the railroad tracks and it was
very dark</b>
<br><b>out there in the country with all the trees and when the man was
walking with</b>
<br><b>his lantern in his hand, tragically, he was accidently hit by a
train and</b>
<br><b>killed. I have heard different versions to this story and the ghostly
lantern</b>
<br><b>light that we saw that time is supposed to be the light of the man's
lantern</b>
<br><b>he was carrying on that tragic night he was hit by a train. I am
36 now and I</b>
<br><b>don't know if this old train station is still there but perhaps
the railroad</b>
<br><b>tracks where this ghostly light appears is still there. I still
remember that</b>
<br><b>strange flickering light to this day. I also recall that the light
was white</b>
<br><b>and it would get bigger and then smaller as it would flicker. Some
say it is</b>
<br><b>the spirit of the man who was hit by the train and some say it is
the ghostly</b>
<br><b>light of his lantern.</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a white t-shirted man who walks
by our den windows outside and</b>
<br><b>sometimes, but not always, makes it to the sliding glass back door.&nbsp;

<br><b>My House Haunted</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sthompson@ionet.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have lived in my house for about five years now when I first moved
in me</b>
<br><b>and my roomate were sitting in the living room&nbsp; when my 3 year
old Dalmation</b>
<br><b>jumped up and began staring at the corner of the living room the
hair on the</b>
<br><b>back of his neck began to stand up and he started to growl he did
this for</b>
<br><b>about one minute then he slowly turned and began to look over the
television</b>
<br><b>as if he was following something and he continued to growl for another
30</b>
<br><b>seconds. Afew months later during the middle of the night we could
hear the</b>
<br><b>dishes in the cabinets shaking. We didnt think to much of this since
we knew</b>
<br><b>there was a quarry a few miles away and we figured that they may
be</b>
<br><b>blasting. Until we talked to them about their blasting times and
they stated</b>
<br><b>they only blasted in the early afternoons a few years later My roomate
moved</b>
<br><b>out and I got married our young daughter was sleeping in her room
one night</b>
<br><b>when I was awakened by her screaming when I went into her room I
saw her</b>
<br><b>light flashing on and off rapidly. I then turned the light off and
the light</b>
<br><b>went off but immeadiatly came back on while the switch was off and
began</b>
<br><b>flashing again since then items would disappear and reappear in
strange</b>
<br><b>places. the cabinets in the kitchen would be open in the morning
when I had</b>
<br><b>shut the the night before and during the day I would shut the cabinet
doors</b>
<br><b>only to find all of them wide open again a few minutes later when
I was the</b>
<br><b>only one in the house. We recently had a baby and he slept in our
room for</b>
<br><b>the first few months. We attatched a Mobile on his bassinet one
night while</b>
<br><b>my wife was asleep and I was watching TV inour room the mobile turned
on by</b>
<br><b>itself. The mobile played a series of songs then turned off. This
happended</b>
<br><b>three times that night. The next night I was telling my wife about
this and</b>
<br><b>while I was talking about it the Mobile bega to play again on it's
own while</b>
<br><b>it was turned to the off posistion. Since then we moved the baby
into his</b>
<br><b>room and monitored him through a baby monitor which is a top the
line highly</b>
<br><b>sensitive type. Several times while awake at night You can hear
a womens</b>
<br><b>voice on the monitor however you can't make out what she is saying.
Whatever it</b>
<br><b>is seems has been helpful at times one night we left the windows
open and a</b>
<br><b>storm came in over night while we were asleep when I got up the
next morning</b>
<br><b>all the windows were shut neither me or my wife had closed them
during the</b>
<br><b>night. When the Mobile played by itself one of the times the baby
had just</b>
<br><b>began to cry when the mobile started and quickly stopped when he
heard the</b>
<br><b>music. The few thing that I had forgotten to mention the first time
I sent this</b>
<br><b>was the Knocking sounds which just sounds like someone knocking
on the door</b>
<br><b>this usually happens in the early evening around 7-10 Pm. Occasionally
it is</b>
<br><b>later at night but when it happens later it is usually louder and
sounds like</b>
<br><b>it might be in the attic. My daughter has come out of her rooms
numerous times</b>
<br><b>asking if we had called her name and each time both my wife and
I have been in</b>
<br><b>the living room and we hadnt been talking let alone calling her
name. One night</b>
<br><b>I was lying in bed still awake while every one else had been asleep
which is</b>
<br><b>not uncommen since I am used to working night shifts and had recently
changed</b>
<br><b>to days about 6 months ago so I am somewhat of a night owl. anyways
I see a</b>
<br><b>shadow in the living room which you can see the light from the living
room from</b>
<br><b>my bedroom. I figured that it was my daughter who happens to sleep
walk so I</b>
<br><b>went in to check on her and she was not that part of the house.
So I Figured</b>
<br><b>that i was just mistaken then I see a little girl walk right past
my room which</b>
<br><b>looked just like my daughter but I had just looked all over for
her so I got up</b>
<br><b>and looked into her room where she was sound asleep in her bed.
The eerie thing</b>
<br><b>about it was that when the girl walked past my room she looked directly
at me</b>
<br><b>while she was walking but the way the light set up in my house is
I could not</b>
<br><b>see her face clearly and she appeared to be fully dressed however
when I</b>
<br><b>checked on my daughter she was in her nightgown. We have given the
incidents in</b>
<br><b>our house a name"Gertrude" she has never harmed us and on many ocassions
been</b>
<br><b>helpful. Events like these continue to happen almost on a dailey
basis some</b>
<br><b>smaller than other The most recent event happened when we were getting
ready to</b>
<br><b>go to Texas and since there were two cars going down there we were
going to use</b>
<br><b>some radios that I had. I had set them out on the computer desk
the morning</b>
<br><b>before we left but when I got home from work about 1:00pm one of
them was</b>
<br><b>missing I searhced the entire house including the kids room and
even the attic.</b>
<br><b>But it was nowhere to be found. and noone had been home since we
had left for</b>
<br><b>work at 8:00am. So we gave up the search and went on our trip when
we returned</b>
<br><b>my wife was getting her nightgown on and found the other radio in
a drawer in</b>
<br><b>our dresser that I had searched twice and my wife had searched once.
but it was</b>
<br><b>there sitting on top of everything as if someone had placed it there
for us to</b>
<br><b>find. little stuff Like that happens frequently and continues to
this day.</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: M00NDRIFTER@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have several stories to tell, two actually.&nbsp;
For years I thought I was</b>
<br><b>nuts.&nbsp; At times, since my first experience was at the age of
seven, I brushed</b>
<br><b>it off as the boogie man.&nbsp; But my second experience, as an
adult, was</b>
<br><b>experienced by my husband and son too.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) When I was seven years old, we lived in a
three story row home in</b>
<br><b>Philadelphia. I occupied the middle bedroom on the</b>
<br><b>second floor. I know this sounds strange cause in the most famous</b>
<br><b>stories of we usually hear, it's always the third floor that</b>
<br><b>gets haunted.&nbsp; But that wasn't the case.&nbsp; My bed was in
the corner to the</b>
<br><b>left&nbsp; of the doorway.&nbsp; Straight ahead from the door was
a corner</b>
<br><b>containing the doors to my&nbsp; closet, and one leading to the
front bedroom (which had been locked</b>
<br><b>by a skeleton key we&nbsp; did not have.&nbsp; We did not own the
house, we rented it.)&nbsp; My dresser</b>
<br><b>was against the far wall, and the only window was in the far left
corner, adjacent to the door</b>
<br><b>leading to the front room.&nbsp; I'd wake up every night, in the
middle of the night, to see a</b>
<br><b>shadow of human form&nbsp; standing in the middle of my room.&nbsp;
I would scream, and my Mother's</b>
<br><b>boyfriend would&nbsp;&nbsp; come rushing in (at first) .&nbsp; After
a while,</b>
<br><b>this became routine: "Nothing in the closet, nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
under your bed,</b>
<br><b>see that?&nbsp; It was just the boogie man.&nbsp; Go back to sleep."&nbsp;
When he found us</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;nother home to rent in a better neighborhood, we moved out,
and the</b>
<br><b>shadow stopped.&nbsp; I would often sleep in my sisters room when
she was at</b>
<br><b>a friends house, or up on the third&nbsp; floor with my older brother,</b>
<br><b>nothing ever happened in either of those two places.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) This next experience, involves a house on
Fort Bragg, NC.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; We&nbsp; had lived there for about a year or two when</b>
<br><b>this all started.&nbsp; It began with the scent of&nbsp;&nbsp; Baby
powder, and I</b>
<br><b>was the only one experiencing it, at first.&nbsp; After a while,
it involved the</b>
<br><b>computer turning on by itself (and staying on).&nbsp; My husband
and I heard</b>
<br><b>scratches on our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dining room window, he'd go out
to chase the "cat"</b>
<br><b>away.&nbsp; But when we'd look out the back&nbsp;&nbsp; door, a
straight look to the</b>
<br><b>outside of the window, nothing was ever there.&nbsp; (there was
also a</b>
<br><b>screen over both the lower windows that could only be removed from
the</b>
<br><b>inside.&nbsp; Yet they&nbsp;&nbsp; were never damaged.&nbsp; When
I would walk into my and</b>
<br><b>my husbands bedroom, things&nbsp; would fall off my dresser.&nbsp;
At first</b>
<br><b>we thought it was the floor.&nbsp; But when he walked in a&nbsp;
couple of</b>
<br><b>times on HIS side of the room, things still fell off MY dresser.&nbsp;
The shade</b>
<br><b>on the dining room window flew up on its own when my husband and
son</b>
<br><b>were sitting in the living room, I was not at home.&nbsp; There
was also the</b>
<br><b>time the scent of flowers (I didn't have any in&nbsp; the house),
moved</b>
<br><b>through the dining room, from me to where my husband had just</b>
<br><b>entered.&nbsp; Each of us smelled it for just a brief second, me
first, then him.</b>
<br><b>I was sitting at the computer at this time, and he had just entered</b>
<br><b>the dining room.&nbsp; There were also the scents of different types
of</b>
<br><b>cologne, smelled by my husband in the living room in a single day,
and</b>
<br><b>only on that day.&nbsp; My husband does not wear cologne, and my
son didn't start</b>
<br><b>till a few&nbsp; months later.&nbsp; On day, while looking into
my mirror on</b>
<br><b>the dresser, I saw the image of a&nbsp; woman.&nbsp; She was in
white with</b>
<br><b>curly brown hair (light brown) and it was as though she was standing</b>
<br><b>next to me.&nbsp; She seemed to be looking at me, but when I turned
to look at</b>
<br><b>her, there was no one there.&nbsp; My son, who occupied the other
of the</b>
<br><b>only two bedrooms of this town house, saw a shadow at his doorway
on</b>
<br><b>many nights.&nbsp; He told me that sometimes it would disappear,
and at</b>
<br><b>others it would just go down the stairs.&nbsp; He'd told me that
he has seen</b>
<br><b>this shadow since he can remember, but I thought it might be</b>
<br><b>important to this incident. There was also the incident where I</b>
<br><b>was sitting alone in the living room one Halloween, I had my eyes</b>
<br><b>closed just trying to meditate and relax.&nbsp; I felt the cushion
next to me</b>
<br><b>move, as though someone had sat down.&nbsp; I thought it might be
my</b>
<br><b>son, so I turned to tell him to go&nbsp; back to bed.&nbsp; But
no one was there.</b>
<br><b>Sometimes, in spite of everything.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I often wonder if imagined it, or if I somehow
infected my whole family</b>
<br><b>with insanity.&nbsp; But I want to know.&nbsp; Is it possible for
an individual to be</b>
<br><b>haunted?&nbsp; Even though the apartment we now live in on Fort
Jackson in South</b>
<br><b>Carolina seems "clean" (I don't really think of spirits as "dirty,"
its just</b>
<br><b>for lack of a better word), I still live with the fear that one
day I am</b>
<br><b>going to turn around and this horrible looking being is going to
be standing</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; So I want to learn as much about this as I can.&nbsp;
I have been</b>
<br><b>considering going to collage, taking up paranormal psychology.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Shadow Figures</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SB1302s@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well let me start by saying im no stranger to ghosts , when i was
a child my</b>
<br><b>mother &amp; i used to go and have picnics in the local cemetarys
and we would</b>
<br><b>hang out there till dusk and watch the shadows cast by the tomb
stones. Ok on</b>
<br><b>to the present, My mother was the first to experiance the shadowy
figure.I</b>
<br><b>was away at school &amp; she slept in my room,when she was awakened
by a</b>
<br><b>smuthering feeling,she opened her eyes and saw a figure hovering
over her and</b>
<br><b>she asked what it wanted ? but all it did was float back into the
closet. She</b>
<br><b>didnt tell me about it until i ased her about a figure</b>
<br><b>i saw in the hallway at 2am,a week later i have since moved into
my own home,</b>
<br><b>the house was made in 1971, and my family are the 2nd owners &amp;
they know the</b>
<br><b>builder/owner, and they dont know what they are talking about.Nor
have they</b>
<br><b>experianced any thing like this in the time they lived there.</b>
<br><b>I still enjoy going to graveyards and looking at the old headstones,</b>
<br><b>theres a old grave yard in sanford fl. That has a story of the old
keeper of</b>
<br><b>the land would walk around with a lantern and check the property
for looters</b>
<br><b>back in the 1940's and to this day you can still see the light swinging
back</b>
<br><b>&amp; forth around the graves. Me and some friends decided to check
it out and</b>
<br><b>parked and wlked in about 12am on a wed.morning and saw the light
and felt a</b>
<br><b>bitter cold,like it was freezing but it was summer hot &amp; humid,
we where</b>
<br><b>scared and ran so none of us will ever go back&nbsp; due to the
strange feelings</b>
<br><b>like we where not alone ,hair standing up for fear on the back of

<br><b>Spirit or ghost??</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: stweety1015@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I'm glad there is someone out there that i can tell my story to.&nbsp;
I don't</b>
<br><b>know what is going on, if it is a spirit of my loved one or a haunting.</b>
<br><b>Anyway let me tell you and you can tell me what you think.</b>
<br><b>The last house that i lived in which is in NJ, i have came across
alot of</b>
<br><b>interesting things happening.&nbsp; The first thing was i was putting
christmas</b>
<br><b>stickers on the window when i got this erie feeling someone was
watching me</b>
<br><b>so i turned around and the lights started flickering and i got goose
bumps</b>
<br><b>all over.&nbsp; The second thing i was in the basement wrapping
christmas gifts</b>
<br><b>and my boyfriend called on the phone, while on the phone he had
said he was</b>
<br><b>going to sneak home to see what i was wrapping, i said ok and we
hung up.</b>
<br><b>Alittle while after i hear these boots walking across the floor
and they</b>
<br><b>stopped at the beginning of the steps to the basement.&nbsp; I said
out loud "</b>
<br><b>What are you trying to do see what i bought you"?&nbsp; Then i waited
and i</b>
<br><b>thought he was trying to scare me so i didn't say anything else
to see how</b>
<br><b>long he would stand up there, well like 10 minutes went by and i
got up and</b>
<br><b>went to look to see where he was and he wan't there,&nbsp; NOBODY
was there.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was so scared.</b>
<br><b>I also have a siamese cat that would NEVER go into the basement
unless</b>
<br><b>someone was done there with him.&nbsp; He would always be sniffing
around and</b>
<br><b>jumping at nothing.&nbsp; The hair on the back of his back would
stand up.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>one time me and my boyfriend heard footsteps coming up the basement
stairs</b>
<br><b>but there was no one there.&nbsp; We used to hear phones ringing
but it was't</b>
<br><b>like the regular phone it was really faint.&nbsp; My son seen this
guy on my bed</b>
<br><b>who he describes as a white haired man with a white body.&nbsp;
He calls him</b>
<br><b>"Aldi".&nbsp; And one time while laying in bed with my son he just
comes out with</b>
<br><b>there mommy there is a ghost over by the window, look mommy now
he is over</b>
<br><b>by the door.&nbsp; Scared the day lights out of me.&nbsp; I always
had this</b>
<br><b>overwhelming feeling that someone was always watching me.&nbsp;
And while i am</b>
<br><b>driving in my car i smell smoke but i don't smoke and neither does
anybody</b>
<br><b>else in my car (it's new).&nbsp; And last but not least - me and
my boyfriend had</b>
<br><b>a fight one night, well after we had made up - a couple of weeks
go by and</b>
<br><b>he goes into a cedar closet we had upstairs to get his bow to go
hunting,</b>
<br><b>well the bow string was sliced down enough not to break it but just
to</b>
<br><b>almost where if he had pulled it it would have broke in his face.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>thought that i did it, but i know that they are under ALOT of pressure
so i</b>
<br><b>wouldn't chance getting hit in the face, plus i totally forgot it
was there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; It seems that everytime we argue things of his are missing
when they were</b>
<br><b>right in front of him.&nbsp; Things always happen to his stuff.&nbsp;
I can't explain</b>
<br><b>what all this means.&nbsp; My godfather died in 1992, so i thought
it was him,</b>
<br><b>this all happened in trenton, NJ in 1998.&nbsp; So i don't understand
if it was</b>
<br><b>him why he would wait until then.&nbsp; If you could give me any
information as</b>
<br><b>to what this may be i would much appreciate it.&nbsp; Thanks so
much for</b>
<br><b>listening.</b>

<br><b>Spirits in my house?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DarkestAngel7@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am quite young, and my mother says it is because
of my innocence that I</b>
<br><b>can see the things I see...I'll tell you about the first time. When
I first</b>
<br><b>moved into this house I was 13, and it was December. I remember
that it was</b>
<br><b>closer to January because Christmas was over. I was sick, I think
it was</b>
<br><b>bronchitus, don't remember exactly. Anyway on to the story...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My fever was worsening and I was only to be drinking
sprite, 7-up, flat</b>
<br><b>sodas, water, etc. I got up out of my bed... walked through my hallway
into</b>
<br><b>the dining room and into the kitchen. I got a drink and figured
I would watch</b>
<br><b>some TV and just nod off on the couch.. I walked into the living
room, and as</b>
<br><b>I saw someone standing in the door way to the music room( Our living
room</b>
<br><b>Music room and kitchen are in a cirlce)She looked just like a friend
of mine</b>
<br><b>at the time. Tall and lanky with dark brown hair and glasses...
But I knew it</b>
<br><b>wasn't Jody... I dropped my sprite and ran back to wake my mom.
I thought</b>
<br><b>maybe it was her sitting in our music room going through boxes.
By the time I</b>
<br><b>gto back to the room and woke my mom and convinved her that I was
scared</b>
<br><b>enough for her to come out and say something... she was gone. Needless
to say</b>
<br><b>my mom thought I was seeing things. She sent me to bed after she
cleaned up</b>
<br><b>my mess. And sat with me for a bit. After she left I woke up again...
and</b>
<br><b>looked out into the dining room and once again I saw her. Sitting
there</b>
<br><b>talking on the phone! Our phone wasn't hooked up so at this time
I just left</b>
<br><b>it go and figured my mom was right. I went back to sleep and awoke
the next</b>
<br><b>morning to her in my room. She began to be a regular thing to me.
My mom</b>
<br><b>thought I was nuts, but I followed her one day out into the woods
behind our</b>
<br><b>house... to find her sitting in a clearing crying. I still can't
figure out</b>
<br><b>what she needed... but I havn't seen her since at the clearing.
Do you think</b>
<br><b>it was my mind playing games? Or a spirit?</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ohter than that I have seen ghosts in my school...
which used to be a</b>
<br><b>hospital.</b>

<br><b>Strange Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Ptoker@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>My grandmother died in September of 1995 from bone cancer.&nbsp;
We buried her in</b>
<br><b>a cemetary in East Petersburgh, PA.&nbsp; I have often visited the
gravesite since</b>
<br><b>then, but one such situation puzzles both my friend and I.</b>
<br><b>One night, in 1997, I was with my friend Meagan and I was very distraught,</b>
<br><b>due to upsetting circumstances.&nbsp; We drove to my grandmother's
grave around 9</b>
<br><b>pm, so that I could calm down and collect myself.</b>
<br><b>I had visited the grave often, as I said before, and I knew exactly
where the</b>
<br><b>grave was.&nbsp; It was dark, but I had found it before even in
the dark.&nbsp; That</b>
<br><b>night, I couldn't find the gravestone, no matter how hard I tried.&nbsp;
Finally,</b>
<br><b>I heard Meagan call for me, she was about 10 feet away from me.&nbsp;
When I found</b>
<br><b>her, she was standing right next to the gravestone.</b>
<br><b>Later that night, I asked how she found my grandmother's gravestone.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>replied that she had seen a stone right next to it that said "Stair",
she</b>
<br><b>looked next to it, and there was the grave.</b>
<br><b>To this day, neither one of us can find the tombstone that says
"Stair".&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>have since returned to the grave several times, looking for that
tombstone,</b>
<br><b>and I have never found it.&nbsp; There aren't even any stones near
my</b>
<br><b>grandmother's grave that start with the letter "S".</b>
<br><b>I am convinced it was my grandmother who led Meagan to her grave.</b>

<br><b>Strange Things</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Deseria1@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;My husband and I had purchased his</b>
<br><b>grandmothers house 2 yrs ago and I have heard noises from day one.
It first</b>
<br><b>started the week we moved in, My husband had left for South Dakota
for his</b>
<br><b>yearly trip with the guys and I was home with my son,&nbsp; He was
8yrs old at</b>
<br><b>the time. I started to fall asleep on the sofa and I heard a loud
crash from his</b>
<br><b>room, It sounded like glass shattering,&nbsp; so I ran in there
and he said he</b>
<br><b>heard it come from the living room then I thought I heard walking
in the</b>
<br><b>attic and I figured it must have been a critter up there so I went
to check.</b>
<br><b>needless to say I found nothing I searched the whole house and found
no</b>
<br><b>broken glass anywhere, nothing was out of place. I felt then that
something</b>
<br><b>was wrong but tried to forget it. after all the only family that
ever lived</b>
<br><b>in this house was my husbands grandparents and my father in law.&nbsp;
then every</b>
<br><b>so often I would hear noises and I know I heard the basement door
open on</b>
<br><b>many occasions but when I would look it was still closed. Then last
year on</b>
<br><b>Thanksgiving my nephew was in the basement bathroom looking in the
mirror</b>
<br><b>shaving and he said he seen someone walk past the bathroom through
the</b>
<br><b>mirror but when he turned around no one was there.&nbsp; when he
told me this he was so</b>
<br><b>pale and scared and I never told him of the other situations in
the house so</b>
<br><b>I new he was telling the truth. I asked him to describe what this
person</b>
<br><b>looked like and he said all he could really see was a skinny arm
with a</b>
<br><b>short sleeve plaid shirt on, he couldn't say whether it was a man
or women. the</b>
<br><b>only ones that have that lived here that past away are my husbands
grandpa</b>
<br><b>and father, Grandma is still alive and living in a nursing home.
We only</b>
<br><b>purchased the house because grandma's sister was going to sell it
and we</b>
<br><b>wanted to keep it in the family, after all we did have family times
in the</b>
<br><b>house, we spent every holiday here with gandma. after my nephew
told me what</b>
<br><b>he seen I talked to my husband about it and he laughed at me and
told me</b>
<br><b>there is nothing to worry about, So I called his sister and explained
to her</b>
<br><b>what was happening and she told me that when there Dad had passed
away the</b>
<br><b>family was sitting here at grandmas house in the dining room going
over his</b>
<br><b>funeral will and so forth when they heard some one walking down
the attic</b>
<br><b>steps, when they&nbsp; opened the attic door to no one was there.
She told me</b>
<br><b>that they all heard it including my husband but he says he doesn't
remember that</b>
<br><b>and when we hear a noise together he says it was the wind or the
house</b>
<br><b>settling. We actually heard a cabinet in the kitchen open and close
one</b>
<br><b>night as if someone was getting something out of it.&nbsp; I always
thought that who</b>
<br><b>ever was in my house would never hurt us so I would just try to
ignore this.</b>
<br><b>for the past 2 months my son who is 9 now has told me that he hears
someone</b>
<br><b>talking to him in his room but he cant hear what they are saying
because</b>
<br><b>they whisper to him. this did scare me and my son but I told him
if there was a</b>
<br><b>spirit it was probable grandpa watching over him because he loves
him so</b>
<br><b>much. and this did make my son feel better but not myself, I have
been</b>
<br><b>hearing this myself but not as often as my son, and sometimes I
write it off</b>
<br><b>as my imagination but the last few night have been horrible. last
night my</b>
<br><b>son woke me up screaming and I ran to his room but didn't see him
I thought</b>
<br><b>I seen him in the living room as I ran past so I went back but the
figure I</b>
<br><b>seen was gone. I found my son screamed again and I found him under
his</b>
<br><b>blankets he was crying and shaking and told me that a man was in
his room</b>
<br><b>and was telling him to come to him now. I asked him if he was dreaming
and he</b>
<br><b>said "no Mom I heard a noise and woke up and was trying to go back
to sleep</b>

<p><b>Terrifying Dreams</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am a firm believer in ghosts, the supernatural and anything with
no</b>
<br><b>"logical" explanation.&nbsp; I am half Navajo, born and raised on
the Navajo</b>
<br><b>reservation and my grandfather was a Medicine Man for as long as
I can</b>
<br><b>remember.&nbsp; So he never thought anything I would tell him and
my father was</b>
<br><b>too weird or completely crazy.</b>
<br><b>My mother and father split up when I was in my teens and I moved
with my</b>
<br><b>sister, neice and mother to Woodland Park, CO.&nbsp; One place we
rented was an</b>
<br><b>old apartment just off the highway.&nbsp; There were six small apartments
all</b>
<br><b>together.&nbsp; Some nights I would wake up in my room and there
would be a dark</b>
<br><b>shadowy figure in the corner just outside of my closet door.&nbsp;
It would scare</b>
<br><b>me and I'd go into my sisters room and ask her to sleep with me.</b>
<br><b>I thought maybe it was just me, having to deal with the brake up
of my</b>
<br><b>parents and moving from the town I'd been in all my life.&nbsp;
I mean, I'd seen</b>
<br><b>and heard some strange things throughout my earlier childhood, but
nothing</b>
<br><b>frightened me like this.&nbsp; However, one night my sister woke
me up asking me</b>
<br><b>who that was in the corner.&nbsp; I explained to her that it was
why I wanted her</b>
<br><b>to sleep with me most nights.</b>
<br><b>Well, the sightings continued to happen and so did something else.&nbsp;
Besides</b>
<br><b>the shadow in the corner, I started waking up to a glowing on the
ceiling.</b>
<br><b>It appeared right over the area where the dark figure always appeared.&nbsp;
For</b>
<br><b>some reason it scared me more than the figure.&nbsp; My sister noticed
it one</b>
<br><b>night and the next morning we hung posters all over the ceiling
to try an</b>
<br><b>cover it up. (I guess we thought that would keep it from appearing).&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>posters didn't help.&nbsp; I would still wake up with the figure
in the corner and</b>
<br><b>the glowing on the ceiling.</b>
<br><b>Not long after the figure appeared and the glowing started, I started
having</b>
<br><b>terrifying nightmares.&nbsp; My room had huge windows on two sides.&nbsp;
In the dream</b>
<br><b>I would wake up with the curtains blowing inwards and a very stong
feeling</b>
<br><b>that something dark and evil was coming.&nbsp; There was no sound,
just the winds.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My heart would be racing and I would sit up in my bed and
reach for the</b>
<br><b>light switch, nothing would happen.&nbsp; I would wake up again,
reach for the</b>
<br><b>light switch, nothing would happen.&nbsp; This would happen a few
times, before I</b>
<br><b>would actually wake up with the light on.&nbsp; I started having
these dreams</b>
<br><b>nightly, each night growing more intense than the night before.&nbsp;
I started</b>
<br><b>sleeping with the lights on.&nbsp; I never saw the figure and the
glow with the</b>
<br><b>lights on, but I continued to have the dream.</b>
<br><b>I had never before told my mom, I figured she had enough on her
mind.&nbsp; But</b>
<br><b>finally, it got to be too much, I wasn't sleeping at all.&nbsp;
I was afraid to,</b>
<br><b>afraid that I wouldn't wake up.&nbsp; That is how dark the presence
was in the</b>
<br><b>dream.&nbsp; I was 15 years old and completely afraid of the dark!&nbsp;
Of course, mom</b>
<br><b>blew it off as just a kid thing.&nbsp; I continued not getting any
sleep and</b>
<br><b>growing more and more scared by the day.</b>
<br><b>One night I had the dream and after what seemed like forever, I
awoke</b>
<br><b>drenched in a cold sweat and tore open my bedroom door leading into
the</b>
<br><b>livingroom.&nbsp; My neice and sister who had been sleeping on the
hide-a-bed were</b>
<br><b>awake staring at my room with sweat running down their faces.&nbsp;
They had the</b>
<br><b>same dream.&nbsp; My mom finally listened.</b>
<br><b>She called my aunt in New Mexico and asked her to please have my
dad and</b>
<br><b>grandfather call.&nbsp; They did right away and when she told them
everything I'd</b>
<br><b>seen my dad said he was coming up to visit.&nbsp; My dad had been
attending my</b>
<br><b>grandfathers ceremonies and learning each one, he's now a Medicine
Man.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>came and blessed the apartment and my room.&nbsp; However the dreams
and sightings</b>
<br><b>continued.&nbsp; Finally he told my mom to find a new place to live.</b>
<br><b>My grandfather told my dad that there are spirits everywhere.&nbsp;
Some are good,</b>
<br><b>and as long as they don't scare you and make you uncomfortable,
you are okay</b>
<br><b>and can live with them.&nbsp; He told my dad that something bad
had happened in</b>
<br><b>this apartment and if the spirits wouldn't leave, or calm down,
with the</b>
<br><b>blessing and prayer, then we needed to leave before something happened.</b>
<br><b>I never have forgotten that apartment and the dreams.&nbsp; They
still send a</b>
<br><b>shutter through me just thinking about it.&nbsp; A few years ago,
I went to a</b>
<br><b>friend of my sister-in-law who is into astrological reading and
tarot cards.</b>
<br><b>I wasn't really impressed with what she had to say, because the
things she</b>
<br><b>told me were obvious observations.&nbsp; But she mentioned something
about "night</b>
<br><b>terrors".&nbsp; I'd never heard about that before.&nbsp; Maybe someone
could enlighten</b>
<br><b>me.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Antique Organ</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MM.MOON@mindspring.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in North Cobb County in Marietta, Georgia. I have a story
I would like to share with you and some of your other viewers. My wife
(Meg) and I and our friends Dee and Paul like to browse Antique Shops.
One fall weekend in late August,</b>
<br><b>We visited a shop called Autumn Oaks Antiques in Ringgold, Georgia.
It is located in North Georgia about 30 mile from Tenneessee. It was still
quite warm for the early part of fall. As we were looking around I went
on ahead aways as I usually do and came across a beautiful old antique
pump organ. The detail work was beautiful. When I got to the organ no one
was around. I looked around for my wife and friends but they were busy
looking at other things. As I turned my back to look at the organ closer
a sweet voice ask if I played the organ. I turned and looked and there
stood a lady dressed in what I would say was clothes of the same era as
the organ.I told her I didn't know how to play the organ but loved it for
its beauty. I ask her if she played the organ and she said she had one
just like it at home. I turned back to look at the organ again and at a
glance I saw her walk away. This is where it got strange. You see the area
she went to was wide open. It seems she just disappeared before my eyes.
I went all over the shop looking for her and she was not there. I also
ask the owner and his wife if they saw her, but they never saw her come
in or leave. We were the only couples in the shop at the time. One other
thing the clothes she was wearing was a long black skirt with pleats and
a white blouse with ruffled sleeves (long Sleeves) unusual for a hot day.
Her hair was done up like they wore it in the 1800's, And her perfume was
like something that would have been worn in her time. This all took place
in August of 1996. We have been back to the same Antique shop on several
ocassions. The organ was sold not long after we were there. I know who
ever bought it got the Lovely Organ Lady with it. I believe with all my
heart this was her organ. I wish I could have bought it. I still think
about her today and everytime we go to that shop.</b>
<br><b>I believe in Ghost and I believe in Angels.</b>

<p><b>The Ghost That Came To Visit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Angylic1@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>My mother inlaw, who lives in Long Island NY, told me of a strange
dream she</b>
<br><b>had about 10 or so years ago... She said it was so real and so vivid,
that</b>
<br><b>only later, did she realize it may have been real. She dreamed that
this red</b>
<br><b>haired young man showed up at her door looking for one of her twin</b>
<br><b>sons...David. No, she said Im sorry he is out but should return
any</b>
<br><b>moment...would you like to wait...yes he said, I will wait for him.
She</b>
<br><b>invited him in, but noticed he didnt take off this unusual teal
green coat he</b>
<br><b>was wearing. She went into the kitchen to get him a drink and some
snacks and</b>
<br><b>when she returned, she realized he was just sitting there staring
into space.</b>
<br><b>So when she asked him if he'd known dave long, he said no...not
a long</b>
<br><b>time...but he has been a good friend and I want to make sure he
is ok.</b>
<br><b>Thinking this was a little odd...she excused herself and left the
room. the</b>
<br><b>dream ended abruptly and when she awoke...she remembered that her
son was</b>
<br><b>living in Florida for a few months for work. She told him of the
strange</b>
<br><b>dream about the young man with red hair and the teal coat...and
he said, yes</b>
<br><b>that sounds like my old friend Pete..from college. You never met
him.</b>
<br><b>Remember the guy I told you about? the one that died a few years
ago in the</b>
<br><b>boat accident? Well, my mother inlaw got this chill up her spine.
And so did</b>
<br><b>David...for he remembered the teal green coat he gave his friend
for his</b>
<br><b>birthday just weeks before his death.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Haunted Field</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: aphroditie25@juno.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi. My name is Wendy and I have had many experiences with the unknown
one</b>
<br><b>is the most recent , not to mention the scariest one yet. It happen
right</b>
<br><b>at the beginning of this summer. My fiance and I went camping up
in</b>
<br><b>Holland,MA. The woods in Holland are old Indian territory. We went
pretty</b>
<br><b>deep in the woods that day about an hour or so in Let me say that
the day</b>
<br><b>started out almost to perfect and I should have sensed something
was</b>
<br><b>going to happen and I think in a way both my fiance and I did. Anyhow
we</b>
<br><b>found what we thought at the time would be the perfect camping spot.</b>
<br><b>There was a place to pull our '79 suburban into and like a very
big</b>
<br><b>separate(by trees an over growth)area to set up camp in. First thing
that</b>
<br><b>would have normally creeped me out and I know that I would have
said lets</b>
<br><b>get out of here was that there was what appeared to be a grave site
right</b>
<br><b>in our camping area. It was just an oval shape of piled rocks. The
reason</b>
<br><b>we noticed it was because we were looking for rocks to build or
camp fire</b>
<br><b>with. It was off to the side maybe ten feet or so from were we set
up</b>
<br><b>camp. The day was so perfect we did some biking and hiking in the
area.</b>
<br><b>On of the strange things that happen early on in the day was when
my</b>
<br><b>fiance was talking about cooking over the camp fire. He said he
wish he</b>
<br><b>had some kind of flat metal grate to put the pots on. About ten
minutes</b>
<br><b>later he found one in a pile of old junk. Well there was a field
about</b>
<br><b>200 feet from our campsite. A very beautiful field with one tree
right in</b>
<br><b>the middle of it. With knee high grass and wildflowers everywhere.
My</b>
<br><b>fiance and I decided that later that night we take our lawn chairs
up</b>
<br><b>there to look up at the stars. Well I had pretty much kept our campsite</b>
<br><b>pretty picked up not to much out. I think it was a sign of what
was to</b>
<br><b>happen. Anyway we saw 2 people go past our camp site right before
night</b>
<br><b>fall. The were ion dirt bikes one of them had stopped and looked
at us</b>
<br><b>real funny. We thought nothing of it. Night started falling. The
sun just</b>
<br><b>going down but in the middle of the woods its pretty dark. Now normally</b>
<br><b>in the middle of the woods you have a ton of animals making night
time</b>
<br><b>noises. That night it was really quiet. We had just got done eating
and</b>
<br><b>we had heard kids partying up in the field,music playing,talking.
We were</b>
<br><b>a little disappointed that we couldn't go watch the stars. But then
all</b>
<br><b>of a sudden we heard this really strange noise about fifty feet
from our</b>
<br><b>campsite. Only way to describe it sounded like a person being tortured</b>
<br><b>without a tounge.Well My&nbsp; fiance grabbed the ax and the flashlight
to see</b>
<br><b>if it was the kids partying(by this time the music and talking was
at a</b>
<br><b>dull).Then the noise we were hearing quickly moved into the field.
So we</b>
<br><b>walked up there to see what was going on. As soon as we entered
the field</b>
<br><b>the noise now was across the woods somewhere. And we hear very quiet</b>
<br><b>talking and a old car radio flipping trough stations(the kind you
have to</b>
<br><b>turn by hand).One thing before I forget earlier in the day we had
noticed</b>
<br><b>a big circle of dead grass on the side of the field that is hidden
from</b>
<br><b>the top where we were. So we walk the length of the field on the
top</b>
<br><b>trying to see if there is anyone in the field. The bottom of the
field</b>
<br><b>were the circle is a lake behind about twenty feet of woods. We
could</b>
<br><b>hear a women talking but couldn't understand what she was saying
it was</b>
<br><b>getting closer and closer to us finally with me freaking out my
fiance</b>
<br><b>decides to shine the flashlight down to the part on the field we
couldn't</b>
<br><b>see figuring someone was in there. Just as he did with our discover
that</b>
<br><b>we were the only ones on the field. We heard whispering all around
us in</b>
<br><b>every direction. We ran back to our campsite packed up and got out
of</b>
<br><b>there in about 20 minutes. It took us an hour to get in there 20
minutes</b>
<br><b>to get out. What every it was that night wasn't good and i am glad
I can</b>
<br><b>tell the story today. Thank You</b>

<p><b>The Lady</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: a.r.cline@worldnet.att.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>It all started about a year ago, my husband and I moved into a house
that</b>
<br><b>was old, I'm not sure how old, but it still had the gas pipes in
the wall</b>
<br><b>when they had no electricity. I was home alone sick and I was laying
on the</b>
<br><b>couch when I heard the door slam shut, I thought it was my husband
coming</b>
<br><b>home from work, we have two dogs and it got them barking. Well,
it was not</b>
<br><b>my husband. I heard it about 5 more times until finally it was him
coming</b>
<br><b>home. I told him about it, and he just smiled at me and said that
we had a</b>
<br><b>ghost in the house. He had seen her before, but didn't say anything
to me</b>
<br><b>because he did not want to upset me.&nbsp; He said it was a old
woman in a cream</b>
<br><b>colored nightgown. After that it was just the door slamming shut,
nothing</b>
<br><b>was really happening, then one night my husband and my 6 year old
son were</b>
<br><b>watching T.V. and my son said "did you see that?" Well she had moved
one of</b>
<br><b>my candles that was sitting on an end table.&nbsp; I have only seen
her once, she</b>
<br><b>has done nothing to hurt or scare any of us. She likes to play with
us, for</b>
<br><b>example, one night my husband cleaned out his wallet and set it
on the</b>
<br><b>coffee table, well we left it there and went to bed. the next morning
we got</b>
<br><b>up and he couldn't find his wallet, he didn't think anything of
it and we</b>
<br><b>both went to work, well that night when we got home, we searched
the house</b>
<br><b>up and down, looked in the garbage, lifted the furniture up on end
we looked</b>
<br><b>everywhere. Well we gave up and I went on the computer and my husband
was</b>
<br><b>watching T.V. My son was upstairs playing, well we have this 10
gallon water</b>
<br><b>thing for the dogs to drink their water in the kitchen. My husband
heard</b>
<br><b>this commotion and thought it was my son doing something, so he
got up and</b>
<br><b>went out into the kitchen to see what he was doing, well it wasn't
him, the</b>
<br><b>water thing was out in the middle of kitchen floor, and it was completely</b>
<br><b>full so there was no way the dogs could have moved it. So I got
up and went</b>
<br><b>to go see what he was doing and he told me that the water had been
moved out</b>
<br><b>into the middle of kitchen, so I told him since he has her out here
in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen to ask her what she did with his wallet, he would like it
back. So</b>
<br><b>he did, and I went back into the computer room, and he got himself
a snack</b>
<br><b>and was walking back towards the living room and I heard him stop,
put down</b>
<br><b>his snack, and he asked me to come here, so I went walking out there
and he</b>
<br><b>pointed to the living room, sure enough there was his wallet sitting
on the</b>
<br><b>couch. I started laughing, and he was just amazed that she did that.
We had</b>
<br><b>looked under the cushions on the couch and lifted the couch up on
end</b>
<br><b>looking for it. Well recently we have moved into his mom and dads
house, and</b>
<br><b>they have had ghosts in their house in the past, but we think our
friend has</b>
<br><b>moved with us, the same things are happening that happened when
we first</b>
<br><b>noticed her in our house. the doors are shutting, things are being
moved. We</b>
<br><b>are happy that she is here if it is her.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Lost Child</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rickjane@indosat.net.id</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I am writing about an experience I recently had at the Novotel Hotel
in Surabaya, Indonesia. I have always believed that ghosts probably existed,
but never, until now, had I seen one.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My family and I were visiting Surabaya for my husbands work. We have
3 girls aged 16, 12 and 9 and a boy who is 7. As we could only get a three
bedroom apartment the two younger girls shared a room and my son had a
fold out bed in the corner of our room, and our oldest was downstairs on
her own.&nbsp; Our first few days there passed rather uneventfully. On
our third night in the room we went to bed as usual. I had not been drinking,
nor was I taking any sort of medication. I mention this as I usually would
have some wine with dinner, but this night had not.</b>
<br><b>I was sleeping facing the wall of the hotel room when I became sub-consciously
aware that I was very cold. My arm that was outside the covers of the bed
was extremely cold. As I came into consciousness I could sense that someone
was in the room. It is not unusual for one of our smaller children to stand
at the end of our bed saying "Mum" until I wake up when they need something
at night, so when I turned over, I was not surprised to see a child standing
at the end of my son's fold out bed. I looked carefully to try and see
which child it was, and I was waiting for him/her to speak to me first.
I could see by looking at the child's height that it was about the height
of our 9 year old daughter so I assumed it was her. As I continued to look
and become more awake I realised that this child appeared to have no feet,
I also realised it was facing my son. I continued to stare and then realised
that this child was hovering off the ground at the end of my son's bed.
It was shimmering a sort of greeny colour. By now I was totally confused,
and still trying to rationalise which child of ours this was. My rational
mind was still trying to make sense of what I saw. Then it turned around.
I saw the face of a small toddler sucking it's thumb, and I knew immediately
it was a ghost, not one of my children. I reached over and grabbed my husband
shaking him furiously, the ghost just hovered looking at me. My husband
woke after what seemed like ages and as soon as he spoke the ghost disappeared
through the bathroom wall. My first instinct after it was gone was to leap
up and see if my son was sick or dead, but he was fine. I told my husband
about what I saw. He believes me as I was very cold and "looked like I
had seen a ghost". My husband and I are very down to earth 'no shit' people,
so he knows I was telling the truth. Again we looked for rational reasons
for what I had seen, but with the absence of drinking, or medication it
was hard to believe I was hallucinating. Also I was definately awake -
it was not a dream.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My husband and I sat up late into the night, (it was about 1 o'clock
when I saw it) talking about what the child may have wanted. I walked over
to the lobby of the hotel and spoke with the night supervisor, he said
that no one had ever reported a ghost in that room before. He asked me
if I wanted to change rooms. Strangely, I didn't, I hoped that the child
would come back so I could ask it what it wanted, it looked so sad and
lonely. For the next few night I waited in anticipation, but it did not
return. Although I was frightened at the time, I am still curious to know
why it came to us. Did it mean to wake me? Was it trying to tell us something,
or was it just seeking the company of another child? I have thought about
it a lot, and this is the first time I have sought the advice of an expert
in the field. Are you able to answer any of my questions? I will be going
back to Surabaya in October, should I stay in the same room? Tell me as
much as you can!</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Man In My Mothers Room</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kdk@wwnet.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother rented an apartment in an old duplex
style house in Elida ,Ohio from 1987 to 1993. She had several strange experiences
there that she only recently told me about , all occurring in the back
bedroom where she slept .</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; She would hear noises like footsteps and boxes being moved
around in the attic above during both day and night.When she went up to
investigate she always found nothing. Thinking she had raccoons or squirrels,
she told the landlord who repeatedly checked the attic, and found no evidence
of any animal or human intrusion.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The two most disturbing experiences happened at night
when she was in bed. She would sleep lying on her side in the middle of
the mattress .One night she woke up after feeling a sudden pressure on
the mattress as if someone had just sat down behind her. At first she thought
it was one of her cats, but she could see both of them on side that she
was facing. Terrified, she thought someone had broken into the apartment
and was going to rape or kill her. Then whoever was on the bed began to
gently stroke her hair. At this point she was so horrified that the just
lay completely still, trying her best not to scream .Then the pressure
on the mattress stopped as if whoever was sitting there had suddenly gotten
up. She then quickly turned around to see who the would be attacker was,
and saw the figure of a man dart around the end of her bed and run through
a door in the room that was once used as a rear entrance. The only problem
was, that the door was boarded shut, and the man passed right through it
!!! She screamed and turned on the lights and checked the door, but it
was still closed tight, and no boards had been disturbed. Thinking that
she had just imagined the whole thing, she wrote it off to too much stress.&nbsp;
A few weeks later the same thing happened again !! This time she got a
better look at the intruder. Even though the room was dark, there was enough
light to make out some of his features. He was a slightly built man in
his forties with a long face, black hair which was heavily greased and
parted down the middle. He was wearing suspenders and one of those high
collared white Arrow dress shirts from the 1920's. He wasn't transparent
or glowing or anything like that. He appeared to be flesh and blood like
anyone else. He repeated his previous performance and ran though the closed
door.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; My mother would not tell anyone about what had happened to
her because she did not want to be branded a lunatic, and did not want
to leave the apartment because this was the only place in town that she
could afford, and she actually liked the place, ghost and all !! After
the second incident, she started sleeping in the other bedroom, and the
disturbances ceased.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of months after my mother moved, my aunt rented
the same apartment . She had been living there for a couple of months when
she called my mother asking if anything&nbsp; "weird " had happened to
her there. My mother replied with "What do you mean by weird?" My aunt
then started yelling at her saying "You knew there was a ghost here,didn't
you ?!" They then exchanged stories and sure enough, they had both seen
the same man in the bedroom at night. The only difference in their stories
was that he was completely nude when visiting my aunt !! My aunt then used
the living room for her sleeping quarters and has not been bothered since.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; She also did some research on the apartment and discovered
that a man who matched their descriptions lived there in the apartment
with his family from the 1920's until he died in the 1940's.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The whole thing sounded pretty disturbing , and neither my
mother or aunt had any reason to fabricate any of this information.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Stigini</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ethylmerman@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Okay, so I don't know exactly how to spell it, but "Stigini" is how
it's</b>
<br><b>pronounced.&nbsp; My name is Francesca, and I'm 18 yrs. old.&nbsp;
As far back as</b>
<br><b>I can remember I've always gotten a thrill out of being scared.&nbsp;
My dad</b>
<br><b>took me to see my first scary movie when I was just four, and always</b>
<br><b>took me on roller coasters,etc. since I was old enough.&nbsp; So,
I guess you</b>
<br><b>could say that I have a strong interest in paranormal phenomena.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>story begins in Ada, Ok., where my boyfriend is from.&nbsp; Last</b>
<br><b>weekend(9/9/00) we went up to Ada to visit with his family.&nbsp;
I had been</b>
<br><b>bugging him all day about taking me to Centrahoma, where this famous</b>
<br><b>haunted house is suppose to be.&nbsp; Well, he never took me, from
fear of</b>
<br><b>getting us lost in the dark, since he didn't really know the exact</b>
<br><b>location of the house.&nbsp; But later that night, we called up
one of his</b>
<br><b>brother's friends and he told us about this bridge in Maud, Ok.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>story goes that if you go there late at night, and park on this
bridge.</b>
<br><b>You're suppose to see a Stigini, which is an old legend/myth about
an</b>
<br><b>Indian Spirit that takes on the form of an animal(a hugee 6 ft.
owl in</b>
<br><b>this case).&nbsp;&nbsp; And the way an Indian would go about taking
on the form of</b>
<br><b>an animal, was he would have to kill someone, rip their heart out,
and</b>
<br><b>bury it next to tree.&nbsp; Sounds kind of crazy to me.&nbsp; But
anywho, me, my</b>
<br><b>boyfriend, and this friend loaded up in the car and headed down
there.</b>
<br><b>We got lost a few times, because it was a very dark, wooded area.&nbsp;
With</b>
<br><b>nothing but old, dirt, rocky roads.&nbsp; And a few houses spread
out through</b>
<br><b>the area.&nbsp; We finally found the bridge.&nbsp; As soon as we
pull up, my</b>
<br><b>boyfriend swears to see a glowing light up in one of the trees,
sort of</b>
<br><b>swaying in a figure eight sideways.&nbsp; He turns to me and Troy
and asks if</b>
<br><b>we were playing with a flash light, trying to spook him.&nbsp; Turns
out that</b>
<br><b>I did have a mini flash light in my hand at that very moment that
he saw</b>
<br><b>the light in the tree, but I hadn't turned it on yet.&nbsp; By the
way, I was</b>
<br><b>driving, my b-friend was in the passenger seat, and Troy in the
back.</b>
<br><b>We were all looking out the right side windows of the car(windows
rolled</b>
<br><b>down).&nbsp; I turned the car off, as well as the lights.&nbsp;
We sat there for a</b>
<br><b>few minutes, just looking over the bridge into the dry creek bed.&nbsp;
Sure</b>
<br><b>enough, these green, glowing lights started popping up way down
at the</b>
<br><b>bottom, first there were only a few, and then more and more.&nbsp;
They would</b>
<br><b>come on for a minute, and then disappear.&nbsp; My boyfriend claimed
that</b>
<br><b>they were getting closer.&nbsp; Then we began to hear the branches
and leaves</b>
<br><b>shaking as if there was a strong wind, but the air was at a dead
calm.</b>
<br><b>We started hearing twigs and such break, pretty close to the car.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>thought maybe it was just an animal or something, but were never
sure.</b>
<br><b>So we sat there a bit longer, still seeing these green lights.&nbsp;
When all</b>
<br><b>of a sudden we see a large bird fly out of one of the trees, fly</b>
<br><b>sideways and then back into the tree.&nbsp; Of course that scared
the bejesus</b>
<br><b>out of us.&nbsp; Not too long after that, about five minutes, the
green</b>
<br><b>lights just disappeard all together. And this noise came out from
that</b>
<br><b>deep trench where the dry creek bed lay.&nbsp; A sound that came
out of</b>
<br><b>almost dead silence(except crickets chirping),It started out as
a growl,</b>
<br><b>then worked its way up to a cross between a howling, and a bird
sound.</b>
<br><b>But the thing was, it didn't sound quite animal, and didn't sound
quite</b>
<br><b>human.&nbsp; It was right then that we decided, "Okay!&nbsp; That's
enough for</b>
<br><b>us!!".&nbsp; So I turned the key, slammed it in drive and we hauled
butt out</b>
<br><b>of there for about half a mile.&nbsp; Then I realized that we were
going in</b>
<br><b>the wrong direction, and that I would have to turn around and go
back</b>
<br><b>over that bridge in order to get back home.&nbsp; Well, we went
back over the</b>
<br><b>bridge, I was so afraid of what I was going to see waiting there
for us.</b>
<br><b>But to my delight, we didn't see a thing.&nbsp; So, I don't know
what</b>
<br><b>happened that night, if we were seeing something of the natural
world,</b>
<br><b>or our eyes and ears were playing tricks on us, or if it really
was</b>
<br><b>something paranormal.&nbsp; But we got our scare for the night,
I was happy.</b>
<br><b>Might I just add, I don't go out looking for ghosts/paranormal phenomena</b>
<br><b>out of disrespect/just to get a good laugh and try to cuss at whatever's</b>
<br><b>out there(I'm not a teenage guy,haha).&nbsp; When I go out looking
for these</b>
<br><b>things, I try to come, and leave as peacefully as I can, and I go</b>
<br><b>because it interests me and I want to experience it fist hand. Not
just</b>
<br><b>a story my grandpa tells me.&nbsp; Well, thank you for your time!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Through the Swinging Doors</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: PottsN@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most blatent experience with the supernatural
I've had occured about</b>
<br><b>8 years ago.&nbsp; My best friend and I were watching TV on the
1st floor of my</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; It was a bright hot afternoon in August.&nbsp; There
is a bar area and</b>
<br><b>bumper-pool table in the front of the room with swinging cowboy-style
doors</b>
<br><b>leading to the "basement" on the same floor.&nbsp; The basement
is in a sort of</b>
<br><b>"U" shape, and is actually on ground level.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard a sudden loud cracking sound, and turned
my head in time to see</b>
<br><b>the swinging doors fall shut.&nbsp; A lampshade was knocked crooked
on a light</b>
<br><b>which stood on a cabnet near the doors, and the framed rules for
the</b>
<br><b>bumper-pool table had been knocked off the wall.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am guilty of having an over-active imagination,&nbsp;
and feel a certain</b>
<br><b>sensitivity tward the paranormal, but I had to get up from my chair,</b>
<br><b>straighten the lampshade and put the framed rules back on the wall.&nbsp;
I wasn't</b>
<br><b>scared at the moment, just confused.&nbsp; The fear came later.&nbsp;
I tried running</b>
<br><b>through the doors to get the same effect of what happend, but was
unable to</b>
<br><b>knock the shade crooked or the rules off the wall.&nbsp; My mom
wondered what the</b>
<br><b>hell I was doing.&nbsp; Someone suggested this event could be explained
by ball</b>
<br><b>lightning.&nbsp; What do you think?</b><b></b>

<br><b>An Angel In Disguise</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was about 16 I was at this park one night with my boyfriend
and his</b>
<br><b>friends. Well my boyfriend and I got in a fight, so I went to sit
in the</b>
<br><b>gazebo. While I was sitting there this girl that looked about 14
came up to</b>
<br><b>me and started talking to me. She kept telling me I had to leave.
I started</b>
<br><b>getting mad. I mean who was this girl to tell me what to do. I told
her leave</b>
<br><b>me alone. I didn't want to talk to her. She looked at me very sadly.
She got</b>
<br><b>up and started walking away. But just before she went through the
trees she</b>
<br><b>turned around and said " Please leave before the same thing happens
to you</b>
<br><b>that happened to me." I was really starting to get annoyed and confused
at</b>
<br><b>the same time. About a minute later my boyfriend showed up saying
police were</b>
<br><b>asking everyone to leave the park and we left. The next morning
I was reading</b>
<br><b>the newspaper. One headline caught my eye. It said "Girl raped and
murdered</b>
<br><b>and Killer caught same night." Underneath the caption was a picture
of the</b>
<br><b>girl who spoke to me in the gazebo. According to the article she
had been</b>
<br><b>raped and killed in another section of the park about an hour before
I was</b>
<br><b>there. And her killer was caught at the gazebo 20 minutes after
we left. I</b>
<br><b>believe she was trying to save me and I thank her everyday for it.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Haunted Down Under</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hlg_garf@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, my name is Heather and I'm from Sydney, Australia.&nbsp; and</b>
<br><b>a BIG believer in the paranormal. I've had some expierences, none
very big</b>
<br><b>and all in different houses at different ages.</b>
<br><b>My first was when I was around 3 years old in an apartment in Bankstown.
My</b>
<br><b>mother has told me that I usually woke up screaming from nightmares
about a</b>
<br><b>man with a gun and a country-looking hat. And I do remember looking
accross</b>
<br><b>my room at the wall where the moonlight shone. I definitly remember
seeing</b>
<br><b>the shadow of a man with a gun and the wierd hat.</b>
<br><b>The second was when I was around 4 and me and Mum lived in Macquarie
Fields.</b>
<br><b>We lived in a townhouse/villa complex right at the end of Railway
Parade.</b>
<br><b>Beyond the dead end where the road ended was a dirt road and a park
where we</b>
<br><b>used to go and watch my friend Daniel play soccer. on the way to
the park on</b>
<br><b>the dirt road were the burned remains of 2 old houses. Mum told
me years</b>
<br><b>later that a fire had started in one house and it had spread to
the next</b>
<br><b>house, and everyone died. The first house was just torn down, but
the second</b>
<br><b>remained. One day when me and Mum were on our usual late Sunday
afternoon</b>
<br><b>walks, we were walking past the house and I looked up to the top
left window</b>
<br><b>and I swear I saw an old woman staring down at me (just like that
scene in</b>
<br><b>Psycho when you could see the "mother" looking out of the window).</b>
<br><b>When I was around 10 I think, we lived in a house in Padstow. It
was built</b>
<br><b>in the 70's and was near the local shops. One night, our very loud
next door</b>
<br><b>neighbours were having a party. I was looking in my mirror, which
faced my</b>
<br><b>window. My curtains were open and suddenly I saw a boy about 12
with dark</b>
<br><b>blonde hair and wearing denim. I quickly spun around, but he was
gone. I</b>
<br><b>looked back into my mirror and he wasn't there either.</b>
<br><b>My most recent one was in the house I'm in currently. It was a couple
of</b>
<br><b>months ago. I was trying to get to sleep and I was facing the wall
(I always</b>
<br><b>have my bed against a wall because I constantly feel as if someone
is</b>
<br><b>watching me). The all of a sudden, I heard a male voice whisper
my name. I</b>
<br><b>went totaly numb and couldn't move--but it was a different kind
of numb.</b>
<br><b>Before the whisper, I was pretty cold because it was winter, but
after the</b>
<br><b>whisper when I went numb, my body went the same temperature. It
was kind of</b>
<br><b>a luke warm. After about 15 seconds, my body went back to normal
and I</b>
<br><b>thought "Well, whatever the hell that was, it's gone now". I was
totaly</b>
<br><b>freaked out!! I've always been a believer in the supernatural, so
much that</b>
<br><b>I want to be a parapsychologist. So I'm thankful of my expierences,
even if</b>
<br><b>they did scare me half to death!</b><b></b>

<br><b>That Was My Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Mousie32370@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;When my husband and I first met, he described incidents that
had witnessed</b>
<br><b>in his home.&nbsp; We met casually, through a mutual friend.&nbsp;
I believed in his</b>
<br><b>stories, because I have always believed in "ghosts", but other than
a scary</b>
<br><b>experience with a Ouija board, I myself had not witnessed anything.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>next time that I saw Joe was about 6 months later,&nbsp; and he
was living in a</b>
<br><b>different home.&nbsp; Again, he told me of&nbsp; strange happenings,
that had</b>
<br><b>occurred recently at his ex-girlfriends apartment, and at the home
he was now living</b>
<br><b>in.&nbsp; He said that the spirit had moved with him. Shortly after
we began</b>
<br><b>dating, he said that his ex-girlfriend was coming over to get her
dog.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>hadto work that night, and would not be there when she came, and
that kind of</b>
<br><b>bothered me.&nbsp; That night after I got home from work, we were
laying in bed</b>
<br><b>and I decided I would ask about her visit.&nbsp; I asked "How long
did Stephanie</b>
<br><b>stay?"... as soon as I said her name, we heard a music box, it sounded
like</b>
<br><b>the old fashioned kind that rolls over the notes, and it played
very, very</b>
<br><b>slowly.&nbsp; It sounded like it was in the corner of the bedroom,
and I knew</b>
<br><b>thatthere was absoluteley anything in the corner.&nbsp; I sat up
in bed with</b>
<br><b>goosebumps, and he said "See, that was my ghost"&nbsp; I was terrified.&nbsp;
I made</b>
<br><b>him get up and walk around the house with me, but there was not
one music</b>
<br><b>box or toy anywhere that could have made that noise.&nbsp; The next
morning, we were</b>
<br><b>at the breakfast table with his mother and his children, who had
spent the</b>
<br><b>previous night in an upstairs apartment, in the upstairs of the
house.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>had decided to wait until the kids went outside to tell his mother
what had</b>
<br><b>happened.&nbsp; Only she beat us to the punch, by asking Joe&nbsp;
if he came upstairs</b>
<br><b>that night.&nbsp; He told her no, that the door to the upstairs
was locked.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>said that about 1:00 a.m. Joey, his son, woke her up and said that
his dad</b>
<br><b>was playing tricks on him, and he was scared.&nbsp; He said that
his dad was</b>
<br><b>wearing all white, and that he was peeking around the corner at
him, and</b>
<br><b>then going away.&nbsp; When he couldn't find his dad around the
corner, he got scared</b>
<br><b>and went to bed with his grandma.&nbsp; That was about the same
time that Joe and</b>
<br><b>I heard the music box downstairs!&nbsp; We had drawers open, and
things slide</b>
<br><b>across the counter top, Joe told me that the night Stephanie was
there, all</b>
<br><b>of the sudden it sounded like the kitchen faucet turned on high,
but they</b>
<br><b>looked, and it wasn't on.&nbsp; After working 12 hours, I was home
sleeping one</b>
<br><b>day, and thought I heard Joe open the door to our bedroom, I could
hear the</b>
<br><b>exact squeak.&nbsp; I didn't open my eyes for a minute or two, but
when he didn't</b>
<br><b>say anything, I opened my eyes to find that noone was there.&nbsp;
This happened</b>
<br><b>a couple of times, but I always dismissed it as my being overly
tired and</b>
<br><b>imagining it.&nbsp; Then one day, I heard the noise, and even heard
footsteps</b>
<br><b>aproaching the bed, and even felt the waterbed sink at the foot
end.&nbsp; Sure</b>
<br><b>that Joe was home, I opened my eyes, and noone was there.&nbsp;
When I told him,</b>
<br><b>even he didn't believe me.&nbsp; He told me that I was going crazy.&nbsp;
Until about</b>
<br><b>a week later, the same thing happened to him.&nbsp; When I talked
to his friends</b>
<br><b>wife about the happenings, she suggested that maybe if it was a
ghost, that</b>
<br><b>it was around because of Stephanie, and explained to me that Stephanie's</b>
<br><b>estranged husband had been previously married, and his first wife
was killed</b>
<br><b>in a terrible boating accident.&nbsp; She said that Stephanie had
taken some of</b>
<br><b>the first wife's china when they split up, and that all of Joe's
experiences</b>
<br><b>began shortly after he started dating Stephanie.&nbsp; One weekend
when Joe left</b>
<br><b>town, I used my pendulium and began asking questions.&nbsp; I asked
if she was</b>
<br><b>"so and so" and it moved forward and backward for yes, I asked if
she was liked</b>
<br><b>Joe, and again it moved the same way.&nbsp; I asked if she liked
Stephanie, and</b>
<br><b>it went the opposite way, back and forth left and right, for no.&nbsp;
I asked if</b>
<br><b>Stephanie had something that belonged to her and it "said" yes.&nbsp;
I asked if</b>
<br><b>she was looking after Joe and it "said" yes.&nbsp; After using my
pendulium, the</b>
<br><b>happenings quit.... Sorry that my story was so long, but I thought
I would</b>
<br><b>share it with you.&nbsp; Since we have moved, we haven't really
had any</b>
<br><b>occurances, but last year my husband and I were walking our dog
near some</b>
<br><b>railroad tracks by our house, and we have one picture, that has
peaked our</b>
<br><b>interest, it appears that there is a haze, that almost looks like
a ghostly</b>
<br><b>image.&nbsp; We don't have a scanner, but I was wondering if you
have any</b>
<br><b>knowledge of ghost pictures, or if you may be able to put us in
touch with</b>
<br><b>someone who would be interested in checking it out??? Thanks for
your time!</b>

<br><b>Creepy Things</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kickcass@excite.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend and I have experienced many strange
and overall creapy</b>
<br><b>things happening at his house and old farm roads close to his home.&nbsp;
(he</b>
<br><b>lives in Salem Idaho, near Rexburg) and we would like some possible</b>
<br><b>explanations.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend lives in an old house given to
his family by his</b>
<br><b>grandpa.&nbsp; In the backyard his grandpa recovered and placed
an old church</b>
<br><b>cornerstone, from the ashes of a burt-down local church, it is still</b>
<br><b>there. With that said we would like to tell you about our situation.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It mainly started with strange low-pitched
wisperings, just loud</b>
<br><b>enough to hear, that sounded like a whole group of people, we could
not</b>
<br><b>make out what it was saying.&nbsp; When this happened the first
time we were</b>
<br><b>at his house alone, and after hearing this left promtly. Every time
it</b>
<br><b>is around evening and night, if we go outside we always get the</b>
<br><b>strangest feeling that I have never had at other places.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another particular event happened not to
long ago when my friend</b>
<br><b>and I were traveling down the road by a farm(about 1 mile from his</b>
<br><b>house) to go to my house, each in our own car, I was in the lead.
It was</b>
<br><b>a clear night but as we approached the road, a heavy fog set in
that</b>
<br><b>could barely be seen through causeing us to drive alot slower as
I</b>
<br><b>neared the start of the farm I began to see a bright light comming
down</b>
<br><b>the road that I thought was a motorcycle headlight. It ended up
getting</b>
<br><b>so bright all I could see was fog and a huge light behind it. when
I got</b>
<br><b>to the edge of a corral I had to slam on my brakes, I saw three
figures,</b>
<br><b>almost siloettes jumping and running across the road.&nbsp; The
first two</b>
<br><b>appeared to be small children, and the third was a tall large figure</b>
<br><b>that looked like it was chasing them.&nbsp; after slamming on my
brakes I</b>
<br><b>coasted right through them in a state of shock, the light was gone,
and</b>
<br><b>as I neared the end of their proporty across a bridge the fog was</b>
<br><b>completely gone.&nbsp; I then pulled over to the side in a state
of shock, to</b>
<br><b>calm down and ask my friend what he saw.&nbsp; To my suprise he
said he saw</b>
<br><b>absolutely nothing,but the fog which gave me a very strange feeling,
he</b>
<br><b>didn't even see the light.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides all the many other times of hearing whispers,
we had another</b>
<br><b>coccurance down the same road right before the bridge mentioned</b>
<br><b>earlier(by this time we decided if we travel past there at night
we do</b>
<br><b>it in groups).&nbsp; It appeared to be a normal night, except that
it was wet</b>
<br><b>and rainy. We were ready to drive across the bridge, as soon as
we were</b>
<br><b>over it, my friend very startled anounced what he just saw, it was:</b>
<br><b>while staring into a puddle along the road, when he saw a weird</b>
<br><b>reflextion, it made him look up at the road in time to see a small
burst</b>
<br><b>of blue flame, about a foot and a half across and two feet high.&nbsp;
and a</b>
<br><b>small puff of smoke after it was gone.&nbsp; I then, also startled
looked</b>
<br><b>into my rear-view mirror and the road in the spot he described ,
from</b>
<br><b>what I could see that far away, was exactly again what he described.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some other minor occurances, but I
figured these would be</b>
<br><b>most helpful and we are very curious about them.</b>
<br><b>anything you or anyone else could tell us, opinions, or whatever,
but we</b>
<br><b>would very much appreciate a thorough response.</b><b></b>
<p><b>thanking you ahead of time.</b>
<br><b>please respond to this letter by e-mailing me at kickcass@excite.com</b>
