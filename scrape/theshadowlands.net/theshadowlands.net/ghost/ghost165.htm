<p><b>My friends house is built over a piece of larg land back in the woods,
were</b>
<br><b>it is said that alot of Civil war victims were buried, and died

<br><b>One night me and amber were laying in her bed, and joking about

a large</b>
<br><b>white light came in her room and shone on her wall, it circled the

<p><b>Wyoming Haunt</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Author Unknown</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Wyoming, Evanston- The outpost resturant what is now Don Pedros Mexican</b>
<br><b>Resturant. I worked for Pedro in the summer of 1999 remodling the
old</b>
<br><b>outpost. There was me, a High school senior named Ryan and two mexicans
who i</b>
<br><b>forget their names. On July 22 1999 Ryan had a dentist appointment
in Salt</b>
<br><b>Lake City. I went to work at 6:30 as usual and the mexicans came
at the same</b>
<br><b>time. Work was normal until the mexicans left for lunch. I stayed
to finish a</b>
<br><b>little work before I left for lunch. I was in the dishwashing room
when I</b>
<br><b>heard voices coming from the basement. I could not understand them,
I think</b>
<br><b>it was just mumbling sounds. But, at the time I thought it was kids
playing</b>
<br><b>in the basement who got through the back door. I went over to the
doorway</b>
<br><b>leadind down to the basement and turned the light on for down stairs
and they</b>
<br><b>tunred off. I turned them on again and they wouldnt work. So I went
and got a</b>
<br><b>flashlight out of a toolbox and went back to the stairwell and asked
who was</b>
<br><b>down there and I heard a voice that made my hair stand up and my
eyes water. The</b>
<br><b>flashlight wouldnt work and I turn around to go turn the light on
and</b>
<br><b>something caught my eye at the bottom of the stairs. I turn around
and there</b>
<br><b>was a lite candle floating in the air. There was nobody carrying
this candle</b>
<br><b>for the whole basement was lite up. Then, it started up the stairs
at me! I</b>
<br><b>ran out of the room and locked the door. I was in the washing room
again.</b>
<br><b>There, pots and pans started flying off the wall and me. I ran out
of the</b>
<br><b>resturant and got in my truck and left. I went to lunch, smoked
almost a pack</b>
<br><b>of cigarrettes, and I tried to figure out what happened. After about
two</b>
<br><b>hours I returned to the outpost to find my two companions there.
I asked them</b>
<br><b>what they thoght of the mess in the dishwashing room and one of
the mexicans</b>
<br><b>said "What mess" I walked into the dish room and all of the pots
and pans</b>
<br><b>were cleaned up, the mexicans had no idea what I was talking about.
Well, the</b>
<br><b>next day I quit and got a Construction job that requires outside
work. This story is very</b>
<br><b>true, all of it happened to me and I hope it never happens again.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Wisconsin</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: drcrane@thehaunting.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Brighton, WI: Bong Recreation Area (Former RI Bong Air Base)</b>
<br><b>A Brief History</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The township of Brighton is a sleepy farm community located
in SE</b>
<br><b>Wisconsin. The parcel of land in particular was frequented by indian
trails</b>
<br><b>traversing a north to south path between present day Hwy 142 and
Country</b>
<br><b>trunk JB. Bong was also home to the last remaining pioneer log cabin
in the</b>
<br><b>county of Kenosha.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; In 1958 59 farm families were ejected from the land in NW
Kenosha County to</b>
<br><b>make way for the Bong Air Force Base. After one yer of intesne construction</b>
<br><b>the plug was pulled on the project, thus leaving seven square miles
of land</b>
<br><b>horribly altered and abandonded for the next twenty years.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; During construction of the base the pioneer cemetary (at
the now</b>
<br><b>non-existent intersection of 18th ave and trunk "LM") was removed
from the</b>
<br><b>site, with many of the bodies being distributed to cemetaries either
in</b>
<br><b>Silver Lake or Milwaukee. presently tunnel structure from the Air
Base still</b>
<br><b>exists intact and just happens to run directly through the plot
of land where</b>
<br><b>the cemetary had been located. Nice touch.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; In 1963 prominent Kenosha business man Anthony Biernat was
abducted by</b>
<br><b>Mafia members outside the Northshore train Station downtown and
was broguht</b>
<br><b>to the abandonded base in theory to frighten the jukebox dealer
into dealing</b>
<br><b>with the Mob. Something went wrong, Biernat was murdered, and his
corpse was</b>
<br><b>left to decompose in a lime pit in the basement of the Rutledge
house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The mid sixties and early seventies gave rise to activity
involving biker</b>
<br><b>gangs and assorted miscreants raiding the base, using old base buildings
for</b>
<br><b>target practice, destroying remaining farmhouse on the property
and other</b>
<br><b>assorted events.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; In the mid-seventies the park was deeded to the Wisconsin
Wildlife</b>
<br><b>Commission, the entity now known as the DNR, and was eventually
turned into a</b>
<br><b>large park by the early eighties.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Alleged Paranormal Activity (and I can't stress alleged enough)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; -Spectral lights witnessed in the woods NE of the Dog Trial
area</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; -several UFOs (and that does NOT connotate flying saucers,
but merely</b>
<br><b>unexplainable lights over the park) have been seen either at the
boundary of</b>
<br><b>the park or inside. A witness and myself pursued a light that hovered
over</b>
<br><b>farmland off of old 296th Ave on the SW corner of the park and gave
chase for</b>
<br><b>approximately five miles to the west. Unexplained white lights also
have been</b>
<br><b>witnessed moving through the sky at night, first mistaken as stars
or</b>
<br><b>high-flying jets, but far too eratic in nature.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; -conspicious signs of cultist activty, NE section of the
park in the "No</b>
<br><b>Vehichle Zone" may be occasionly found off of existing trails traversing
the</b>
<br><b>woodlands off of old Hwy 75. This is the second most dangerous section
of the</b>
<br><b>park and should not be taken lightly: there are no DNR patrols and
there is</b>
<br><b>not a house within miles. Remember that no person has ever been
officially</b>
<br><b>injured by a paranormal force yet to date, but the threat of the
human</b>
<br><b>element is one that must be recognized. I repeat, this is not to
be taken</b>
<br><b>lightly.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; -The most dangerous section of the park is the fully intact
and sometimes</b>
<br><b>sealed underground network of sewers and tunnels remaining from
the Air Force</b>
<br><b>Base. Many wild rumors surrond activity repoted below the park ranging
from</b>
<br><b>cultist activty to spirits, mists, and unidentifiable noises or
lights, but</b>
<br><b>little can be confirmed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; For safety and liability reasons the locations to access
ports will NOT be</b>
<br><b>divulged. Access to the system is strictly forbidden by Federal
Laws.</b><b></b>

<p><b>What was that?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:student@bsu.edu</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have experianced many things that seem a little out of the ordinary.</b>
<br><b>I live in a haunted house after all, but the story i am writing
does not</b>
<br><b>invovle my house.&nbsp; I decided to save those stories for another
time.</b>
<br><b>To get to my story.&nbsp; I worked at a fast food resteraunt for
three</b>
<br><b>years.&nbsp; I often had to close, which meant I wasn't allowed
to leave work</b>
<br><b>until Midnight on the weekends.&nbsp; One night I left work about
12:30am,</b>
<br><b>and was driving towards my home.&nbsp; I always took the same route
home</b>
<br><b>which was a busy highway.&nbsp; Highway 22 to be exact.&nbsp; As
I was approaching</b>
<br><b>an intersection I noticed a person standing in the middle of the
road.</b>
<br><b>I thought it quite strange since it was very late.&nbsp; As I continued
to</b>
<br><b>get closer to this person, I sort of sped up, unsure of what to
do.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>figured the person would move out of the middle of the road but
as I</b>
<br><b>came closer I realized the person had no intention of doing so.&nbsp;
I got</b>
<br><b>close enough that I could see the persons clothes.&nbsp; It seemed
their</b>
<br><b>clothes were old-fashioned.&nbsp; The man was wearing a long brown</b>
<br><b>treanchcoat, with a brown plaid old style hat.&nbsp; Sort of what
I think was</b>
<br><b>worn in the forties.&nbsp; As I got closer, I realized that I was
going to</b>
<br><b>run over this man if I didn't stop.&nbsp; I had just enough time
to slam on</b>
<br><b>my brakes.&nbsp; I was on a highway so after I slammed on my breaks
I checked</b>
<br><b>my rearview mirror to see if I was going to be hit from behind.&nbsp;
It only</b>
<br><b>took a moment to see that I was on the road alone, but when I looked</b>
<br><b>back the man was gone.&nbsp; There was no sign of him anywhere.&nbsp;
I don't know</b>
<br><b>for sure what I saw that night, but I knew if it was a person I
would</b>
<br><b>have seen him running away.&nbsp; There was just open fields&nbsp;
on both sides</b>
<br><b>of the road, he could not have ran without being seen.&nbsp; I never
saw him</b>
<br><b>again as I still made the same trip nearly every night, but I surely</b>
<br><b>never forgot him.</b><b></b>

<p><b>WEIRD</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CinBart25@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Compared to some of the stories that I read, my expierences do not
seem that</b>
<br><b>scary, but I'm not sure what we have.</b>
<br><b>To start off, I alwats felt uncomfortable in my parents house growing
up. I</b>
<br><b>was always scared to go up stairs alone and in the dark.My parents
always</b>
<br><b>used to tease us kids about a ghost in our house named Mrs. Reynolds.
She had</b>
<br><b>lived in the house years before. I always felt like there was a
presence in</b>
<br><b>the house...like I was being watched. The eyes in pictures would
follow me,</b>
<br><b>etc.</b>
<br><b>When I was about 10 years old, my father would go away for days
at a time for</b>
<br><b>his job, and I would always sleep with my mother. This one particular
time</b>
<br><b>that my father went away, I decided to sleep in my own room. That
night, my</b>
<br><b>mother was awoken to find a dark shadowy figure at the foot of her
bed. She</b>
<br><b>said the she felt extreme hatred and evil coming from the form.
She said "In</b>
<br><b>the name of Jesus Christ leave me," and instantly it disapeared.
Now my</b>
<br><b>mother is very religous, and I know that she would not lie about
something</b>
<br><b>like that.</b>
<br><b>The next thing happened years later. I was about 17, and my parents
were away</b>
<br><b>on vacation, and on the first night they were gone, my best friend(she
lived</b>
<br><b>up the street) came to spend the night with me. I hated being in
that house</b>
<br><b>alone. We were sitting in the living room, just talking, when there
was a</b>
<br><b>knock at the door. Now this seemed a little weird to us, seeing
that it was</b>
<br><b>about12:30 am. My dog started freaking out, barking and growling,
hair raised</b>
<br><b>on his back(he is usually very calm, loves people.)</b>
<br><b>So I went to the door to answer it, and there was noone there. With
my dog</b>
<br><b>still freaking, I backed away from the door, and the knocking started
again.</b>
<br><b>I went to the door again, and looked out, but again there was noone
there. So</b>
<br><b>my friend called her parents, up the strtte and asked them if they
could come</b>
<br><b>down and see if they could find anyone, perhaps someone was playing
a joke.</b>
<br><b>Her parents called the police and came down. In the mean time, my
dog had not</b>
<br><b>stopped barking, not until her parents came down. The police came
and</b>
<br><b>searched all around our neighbourhood and found nothing. Go figure.</b>
<br><b>The next incident happened about&nbsp; 5-6 years later. I was at
work, I was</b>
<br><b>running and embroidery machine, and I was sitting at my desk, which
has a</b>
<br><b>mirror in front of it so that I can see my machine(my back it toward
the</b>
<br><b>machine if I sit at the desk.) I saw and felt a figure walk behind
me.</b>
<br><b>Thinking it was my sister who I worked with, I thought nothing of
it. About 5</b>
<br><b>minutes later, the same thing happened again, only walking in the
outhe</b>
<br><b>direction. Again, Thinking it was my sister returning from the bathroon,
I</b>
<br><b>thought nothing of it. The third time, I felt and saw the figure
walk behind</b>
<br><b>me again, and felt as if it were standing at my machine, out of
view from the</b>
<br><b>mirror. Not turning around, I could feel the presence standing there.
After</b>
<br><b>about 10 minutes, I turned, expecting to see my sister there, I
turned to aks</b>
<br><b>her what she wanted, but there was noone there. I could still feel
the</b>
<br><b>presence there, but I don't know what it was.</b>
<br><b>It was this incident that lead me to reading tarot cards. I actually</b>
<br><b>perdicted my sister getting pregnant.</b>
<br><b>And just a few months ago, in my new apartment, the water turned
on for no</b>
<br><b>reason.</b>
<br><b>I was in my bed, and my boyfriend was in the bathroom, I could hear
him</b>
<br><b>running the water, taking out his contacts, and I heard him turn
off the</b>
<br><b>water and go into the computer room. I could hear him typing...when
all of a</b>
<br><b>sudden the water turned on. I got up to see if it was my boyfriend,
but he</b>
<br><b>wasn't in there, but the water was on full blast. I walked into
where he was,</b>
<br><b>and asked him if he had left the water running, and he said no,
he had heard</b>
<br><b>it start running butthat he thought that I had gone in to use it.</b>
<br><b>Nothing has happened since, and I don't feel anything bad, but it
just freaks</b>
<br><b>me out.</b>
<br><b>I don't know what all of these things mean, I don't mind them happening,
but</b>
<br><b>I just wanted you opinion.</b>

<p><b>Hi I have several differnt experiences i want to share with everyone
but</b>
<br><b>right now I will share a few and if you want to know more you could
ask me</b>
<br><b>later. One night me and my brothers ex were sitting in my room which
by the</b>
<br><b>way is where most of the activity any way we were sitting there
talking</b>
<br><b>about how we think the house is haunted and then we heard a mans
voice dont</b>
<br><b>remember what it said but we both sat there scared to death then
when we</b>
<br><b>finally came to we ran to my brother and told him he said maybe
it was the</b>
<br><b>tape we were playing so I went back and rewinded the tape and listened
but</b>
<br><b>there was nothing. some other stuff happened like voices,cring late
at</b>
<br><b>night, shadows, footsteps, the felling of being watched, my friends
and</b>
<br><b>family both have seen and heard things.One day I had just got out
of the tub</b>
<br><b>and went to my room my friend was in there fixing her hair in front
of the</b>
<br><b>mirror any way when I shut the door she said why did you close the
door on</b>
<br><b>him I asked her who she was talking about and she said someone was
right</b>
<br><b>behind me and I shut the door on them so I opened the door and looked
out in</b>
<br><b>the hallway and there was absolutley no one upstairs with us.</b>
<br><b>One time we called the priest to bless the house and he was asked
to bless</b>
<br><b>my room the best because like i said it was the most active and
while he was</b>
<br><b>doing that I started feeling really wierd and very disturbed I could
not</b>
<br><b>understand it. It bothered me so much I had to leave the room. The
last</b>
<br><b>thing I want to tell you is when I was washing the dishes I felt
a strong</b>
<br><b>presence behind me I tried to turn but couldnt I only got a glimpse
of a</b>
<br><b>shadow like person I started praying and the more i rayed the stronger
it</b>
<br><b>got until the plate i was holding fell and broke then I ran. My
bed shakes</b>

<p><b>Tulsa Office Building</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; CarolsStones@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Oklahoma-Tulsa-Office Building&nbsp;&nbsp; This information is</b>
<br><b>authenticated by my husband and some of his coworkers who experienced
some of</b>
<br><b>the haunting incidents.&nbsp; Some years ago, a construction worker
was apparently</b>
<br><b>killed on the 2nd floor during the construction of the office building
my</b>
<br><b>husband works in.&nbsp; The midnight shift of workers have reported
seeing a man</b>
<br><b>on the 2nd floor (with a hard hat and tool belt) who walks down
hallways or</b>
<br><b>disapears around corners.&nbsp; When someone calls out to this worker,
he never</b>
<br><b>responds.&nbsp; A security guard standing in the parking lot of
the building saw a</b>
<br><b>worker walking around on the 2nd floor late at night when no workers
were up</b>
<br><b>there (the 2nd floor is vacant and used for storage).&nbsp; Finally,
my husband,</b>
<br><b>(who is VERY skeptical of hauntings) reported hearing rustling noises
in a</b>
<br><b>office cubicle next to the one he was in (he works midnights and
was up on</b>
<br><b>the 2nd floor doing repairs - no other workers were up there).&nbsp;
He found a</b>
<br><b>desk drawer open in the cubicle, but no one there.&nbsp; He closed
the drawer and left</b>
<br><b>the cubicle.&nbsp; A few minutes later, he heard more noises and
found the drawer</b>
<br><b>open again.&nbsp; At that point, he left the 2nd floor!&nbsp; He
also says there are</b>
<br><b>times he feels he's "not alone" when working on the 2nd floor.&nbsp;
My husband is</b>
<br><b>a very "down to earth" guy whom I obviously know and trust, and
because of</b>
<br><b>this, I really believe this to be a true haunting and not just a
"ghost</b>
<br><b>story".</b><b></b>

<br><b>Here's my story. It's 2nd hand but it's a good one.&nbsp; I am now
getting ready to</b>
<br><b>graduate with a degree in Chiropractic.&nbsp; In the winter of '96
I was in upstate</b>
<br><b>NY attending a small comm. college.&nbsp; My organic chem teacher
was Dr. Joe Peone.</b>
<br><b>An all around great guy. Anyway I had heard from some of the students
about an</b>
<br><b>experience of his.&nbsp; I wanted to get the whole story, so I asked
him myself. This</b>
<br><b>is how it goes. When he was about 20 (he's now in his 60's) he began
having</b>
<br><b>these reoccurring dreams of the Battle of Gettysburg.&nbsp; He said
that he probably</b>
<br><b>had 1 or 2 a month. In these dreams, he was a soldier actually fighting
in the</b>
<br><b>battle.&nbsp; As the dreams continued into his mid 20's and early
30's, they became</b>
<br><b>much more detailed. The battles were very bloody with distinct faces
and he took</b>
<br><b>on an identity. He was a solider by the name of Clem Johnson. At
the age of 40</b>
<br><b>(still having the dreams) Dr. Peone decided to take a trip to Gettysburg,
PA to</b>
<br><b>visit the field where the battle had took place. Lined on the field
are the</b>
<br><b>headstones of all who fought and died there.&nbsp; While looking
through the names,</b>
<br><b>he came upon the marker of Clem Johnson who died on August 8, 1865
(I can't</b>
<br><b>remember the exact date)&nbsp; but it was the same date that Dr.
Peone was born on in</b>
<br><b>1936.&nbsp; His deathday was Joes birthday.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I got goosebumps when he told me that story. He's a very believable
guy. It was</b>
<br><b>almost as if he didn't want to tell me the story cause I'd think
he was crazy.</b>
<br><b>To this day I believeable his story, and I hope that you believable
it too.&nbsp; By</b>
<br><b>the way, the last time I spoke with him he was still having the
dreams.</b>

<p><b>Family of Spirits</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>First of All, Thank you Dave, for referring me to Rick Fisher from
PA.</b>
<br><b>He in turn referred me to the Mon Valley Ghost Researches who I
STRONGLY</b>
<br><b>recommend to anyone who is living in the Pennsylvania area.&nbsp;
They helped</b>
<br><b>me to understand not to be afraid, how to understand, and most of
all,</b>
<br><b>how to live with the spirits in my home.</b>
<br><b>It all started long before my husband and I bought the home on Westmont</b>
<br><b>Avenue.&nbsp; I had a dream one night in 1994 (We bought the home
this year</b>
<br><b>2000), that we were in this house the exact house that we bought.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>dreamed that my sons were older, and I had a daughter, (she wasn't</b>
<br><b>concieved until 1997 born in April of 1998), and they were playing
in</b>
<br><b>the exact yard that we have now.</b>
<br><b>This house meant something to me when I bought it, little did I
know</b>
<br><b>what was in the package deal, although I was very soon to find out.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>all started with an uncomfortable feeling in the bathroom, like
someone</b>
<br><b>was there, watching, stalking, waiting......</b>
<br><b>Then one day, as I was taking a well deserved hot bath after a long
day</b>
<br><b>of three beautiful children ,&nbsp; I got pinched.&nbsp; Really
hard.......&nbsp;&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>got afraid after that, and sought advice.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't the
only one with</b>
<br><b>experiences in this house, my sisters had their back end grabbed
on</b>
<br><b>numerous occasions, heard singing in the house, and felt a horrible</b>
<br><b>grief.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got horrible smells and saw shadows out of
the corner of my</b>
<br><b>eye.</b>
<br><b>My sister and I went out one day for a walk , came back to every</b>
<br><b>cupboard door wide open and freaked!!!!!!!!!!!</b>
<br><b>I should also add that before we bought this home,&nbsp; I NEVER
EVER</b>
<br><b>believed in ghosts.&nbsp; I thought it was all malarchy.&nbsp; There
was only</b>
<br><b>heaven and hell in my mind, no in between, I used to CHALLENGE people
to</b>
<br><b>try to make me believe.</b>
<br><b>I recently had a history done on my home.&nbsp; There was one family
that</b>
<br><b>lived here for over eighty years.&nbsp; It was built in 1910 by
the father of</b>
<br><b>the 73 year old woman who was the last to die here.&nbsp; They had
their</b>
<br><b>wakes in my dining room, WITH THE CORPSES IN CASKETS.&nbsp; That's
just the</b>
<br><b>way they did it back then, the laid the family out in the home.&nbsp;&nbsp;
There</b>
<br><b>was at least six people that died here, ALL OF THEM related.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And I</b>
<br><b>just think that they aren't ready to leave their family home.</b>
<br><b>I want to also add that the feeling I had in the bathroom.......
I found</b>
<br><b>out that the last family member of the man that bought this home,
died</b>
<br><b>in the bathtub, and was left there for two weeks in the blistering</b>
<br><b>summer with the windows and doors closed, no air conditioning before
she</b>
<br><b>was found.........</b>
<br><b>Thank you Dave, For letting me share my story.</b>
<br><b>And thank you for getting me to the help I need to understand that
I</b>
<br><b>wasn't living with hellbound creatures, just humans, with their
own</b>
<br><b>personalities, like you and me.......</b>

<p><b>Some years ago I was babysitting with an ex girlfriend.&nbsp; Things
were pretty much as normal, and I needed to visit the little boys room.&nbsp;
After using the toilet - I popped my head in to the children to make sure
they were asleep, which they were - and whilst in the room I went very</b>
<br><b>cold and heard a voice, which I can only describe as being of an
old lady and it said "What are you doing here?" Obviously I ran - although
I dreaded turning round.&nbsp; After that downstairs we constantly heard
the kids running around upstairs for ages - despite them seeming to be
fast asleep when I looked.&nbsp; I didnt bother to check againI was way

<br><b>about 10 seconds before they arrived.&nbsp; The only conclusion

<p><b>Hello again. Here is the second story, this time it takes place at

<br><b>Friend ,Karen, (s) Mum and Dad's cottage in Yeldam.</b>
<br><b>My Mum, Dad, Karen and her old boyfriend David were visiting her
parents.</b>
<br><b>My Mum had to go upstairs to the toilet, she was on the toilet when
she</b>
<br><b>felt sure someone was watching her (No one else was upstairs with
her.) She</b>
<br><b>was absolutely freaked. She finished what she was doing very quickly
and</b>
<br><b>ran down the stairs, (That go straight down.) She said she could
of</b>
<br><b>literally jumped the last few steps down. Then in the living room
(It has a</b>
<br><b>glass pane and you can see into the kitchen.) Dad said he saw someone</b>
<br><b>standing near David and Karens Dad. And they were the only ones
in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen. Dad says that the figure was almost like a shadow but it
was</b>
<br><b>certainly a person. The strange thing is it only happened when My

<br><b>some other things that my grandma had like her make-up mirror and
stuff.</b>
<br><b>When i came out of the play room and into the living room, my parents

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later i found out that the man who built

<p><b>Family Frights</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Ladybug_babe16@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have a few stories that have happened to my mother and my sister.
When my mother was a little girl about 12, she stayed up&nbsp; one night
watching her favorite show. Her parents went to bed, so she was the only
one up. As she laid down with her cat she heard this scratching sound!
Her cat went to the window but a second later ran out eyes as big as apples,
and his fur stuck out as far as it could go Well my mom just laid there
for a little bit thinking should i look, or just get out? well my mom went
under the covers and out the other end out the door! She woke up her parents
and her dad checked out the window! No one</b>
<br><b>could have played a joke on her because the way the house is set
up is the house and the garage is put together by a porch in&nbsp; between.
there's a gate that goes up stairs and to the front door! She had this
dog that barks at anything it hears or sees But the dog did not bark. The
gate can't be opened with out a load creaking sound. It had to be someone
or something flying over the gate so quite that the dog can't even hear
it move. In the morning her dad woke up to go to work and he found the
screen to the window all ripped up. When he checked it out at night when
my mom first woke him up the screen had not been</b>
<br><b>ripped up! Is that weird or what? For my next story begins way back
about when my sister was 5 and i was 4. When my mom put us up for a nap
she set my sister and I's p.'s on our dresser in the closet. and left for
about ten minutes then running to the door of our room with my sister screaming
bloody murder! My mom ran it finding our p.'s all around my sisters bed!
To this day my sister swears her p.'s where dancing all around her in a
frightful way! I do not remember this at all but my sister does! I think
to myself things</b>
<br><b>have happened to my sister and my mom! But nothing has happened
to me and I'm into scary stuff like that and sometimes I wish that stuff
could happen to me but for some reason it won't.</b>

<p><b>How do I begin,&nbsp; I am now 25 years old, my boyfriend and I were
watching a</b>
<br><b>TV show on ghosts and it reminded me of something that happened
to me when I</b>
<br><b>was younger.</b>
<br><b>No I wasn't possessed, I didn't see anything, but I did hear something.</b>
<br><b>When my sister and I were younger we shared a room.&nbsp;&nbsp;
She kept me up half</b>

wake her up ,like</b>
<br><b>I did every night before, to tell her she was keeping me up.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I slept next</b>
<br><b>to her so I could just push her and wake her up.&nbsp; I was about
to get up when</b>
<br><b>I heard a deep voice "Hello Becky" (that's my sister's name) she
answered</b>
<br><b>him back, "Hi".&nbsp; "Do you want to come with me?" he said.&nbsp;
"What" she</b>
<br><b>answered.&nbsp; I was under my covers covering my ears to not hear
what he was</b>

He kept asking</b>
<br><b>him to go with him and she kept telling him "what" and she was also
giggling</b>
<br><b>in her sleep.&nbsp; I was so scared I donna know how I slept.&nbsp;
In the morning</b>
<br><b>when I woke up I asked her if she remembered talking to anyone in

<p><b>A Ghost In My House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: spacy1976@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>i have a ghost in my house we have lived here for about 5 years now
and when we bought it i had no idea that the man that lived here before
us died on the living room floor. The first time i saw him i was prego
with my first son i was about 8 months along and one night at around 3:00
i woke up for no reason and i saw a man in the corner of our room as i
was watching him (at first i thought it was my husband) he seemed to be
looking for something on our dresser well it scared the HECK out of me
anyway as i was watching him he faded away very slowly like so slow i didnt
realise until he was gone.&nbsp; Another time</b>
<br><b>was in the kitchen and i was prego with my second son i got up about
3:00 in the morning went to the kitchen to get a sandwich and in the kitchen
window i saw 2 men standing in front of it talking well i didnt think anything
of it ate my sandwich and went back to bed well the next morning my nabour
was standing wear the two men were standing and i had to look down to see
her (we have a basement so it is higher on the main floor) anyway i realised
that the men i saw would have to be 10 feet tall to be level with my window
i was so scared to move that when my nabour saw me there in the window
she came</b>
<br><b>right over thinking that something was wrong when i told her about
the nite before she told me that it was impossible because she was also
up at around that time to let the dog out and she didnt return to bed until
an hour later well i damn near gave birth right there when she said that
anyway about a year and a half later i was sitting in the living room with
the kids when all of a sudden my youngest went pale white and stared at
soming by the door when i looked at the door there was no one there he
started following something across the room and when he stoped looking
i figure that it must have disappeared he started crying even though i
know that he is not here to hurt us of scare us away i still get freaked
out just thing that there is a ghost living with us it has now been at
least a year since the last time we've seen him i still fell he is here
and every once in a while i fell a gust of wind when im doing dishes i
hope that one day he finds what he is</b>

<p><b>A Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Cleatus1999@gateway.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>At the time I was 16-17 years old. Let's say (my brother and friends)
found a</b>
<br><b>head-stone of a young girl who had died when she was 13. She died
in October</b>
<br><b>of what year I don't know, but her untimely death and what follows
still</b>
<br><b>sends chills down my body.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The head-stone was painted
with florsecent orange and black paint. I</b>
<br><b>won't say the words they put on it, but apparently she was not happy
with</b>
<br><b>what it said or the fact that it was no longer on it's resting place.
My most</b>
<br><b>vivid memory of her wrath was when I had walked in the front door
and dishes</b>
<br><b>that were in a hutch flew across the room and landed at my feet.
There was 4</b>
<br><b>other people in the room that saw this.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another time I was there in
the house by myself to clean it. My</b>
<br><b>brother's friend's bedroom was at the top of the stairs. He had
a bed that</b>
<br><b>was attached to the ceiling with 4 very large thick ropes. There
was nothing</b>
<br><b>between the bed and the wall nothing to keep it in place, yet the
bed was</b>
<br><b>very heavy and hard to swing. But the day I was there in that room
collecting</b>
<br><b>dirty clothes I heard some one calling my name from downstairs,
I thought it</b>
<br><b>might have been my mom so I went to see what she wanted. No one
was there yet</b>
<br><b>I heard my name being called again from the stairwell. Of course
no one was</b>
<br><b>there and at first it really did'nt scare me until I went back into
the</b>
<br><b>bedroom and the bed was swinging from side to side as if someone
were on it</b>
<br><b>pushing it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are

<br><b>A Haunted House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Shor517828@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I never thought too much about ghosts until I moved here....the
house was</b>
<br><b>built in 1915.&nbsp; Its an old 3 story victorian style.&nbsp; We
have two spirits</b>
<br><b>here...a small girl about 6 and a gentleman about 40. Both my daughter
and I</b>
<br><b>see them, and they try to speak to us, but as yet we don't understand
them.</b>
<br><b>The girl delights in running barefoot through a freshly mopped floor.&nbsp;
There</b>
<br><b>are times you can see our cat chasing an imaginary string all through
the</b>
<br><b>house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lately...these two, the child and man have been
a protector for my</b>
<br><b>daughter and I.&nbsp; A person visited a few months ago. I can only
say that</b>
<br><b>something evil was left behind.&nbsp; Something pushed me down the
stairs....(16</b>
<br><b>solid oak steps)&nbsp; I was abruptly stopped from the fall.&nbsp;
When I looked back</b>
<br><b>the gentelman was holding me.&nbsp; At night, my daughter would

<p><b>Images</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cheryl</b><b></b>
<p><b>About 10 years ago, I worked in a small bar in an historic district
in SW Pennsylvania.&nbsp; One night, 4 patrons and I were closing up.&nbsp;
I was sitting at the bar talking.&nbsp; Suddenly, behind me I felt something
odd.&nbsp; Without looking around, I sensed a slender tall man with black
hair wearing a plaid workshirt and jeans at the pool table about to make
a shot.&nbsp; The 4 patrons all froze at the same time and one of them
said that, while he was afraid to turn around, he could see the image of
what was there in my eyes.&nbsp; We all made a pact never to mention this
to anyone...for obvious reasons.</b>
<br><b>Shortly after that, I was in the bar all night cleaning for a health
inspection.&nbsp; All through that night, I heard "people" in the bar shooting
pool, coming in and out of the locked door, and even "saw" someone sitting
at the bar..an elderly gentleman with a plaid hunting cap on and a brown
jacket.&nbsp; I came out to tell him the bar wasn't open when I realized
he wasn't there, just a reflection in the mirror was there.&nbsp; Then
he disappeared.&nbsp; Was I dreaming this?&nbsp; The bar is no longer there.&nbsp;
The property is now part of a lumberyard.&nbsp; I have never told anyone
about these encounters until now.&nbsp; Is this a natural occurrence?&nbsp;
I was not drinking or anything on either occasion.&nbsp; I have had some
very strong psychic experiences in the past that could not be explained
rationally and have been "visited" by my deceased relatives.&nbsp; Are
these dreams?&nbsp; Or is</b>
<br><b>it something else?There were many places in this town that were
reputed to be haunted.&nbsp; I can believe it...please don't use my full
name.&nbsp; You and I may know all this to be true, but my family would
not understand.</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Lifetime of Haunting</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: jolee@piasanet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I guess I should start by stating that my family is weird, for lack
of a better word.</b>
<br><b>I am a believer extreme in ghosts and such.&nbsp; The family joke
is that six generations</b>
<br><b>of clairvoyants can't be wrong...</b>
<br><b>My first experiences began in my grandparents' house.&nbsp; I guess
I was about three or four when I first encountered "Bill".&nbsp; The circumstances
surrounding his arrival and timing are quite sketchy.&nbsp; This was the
summer of 1977, my grandfather was inthe hospital after suffering a heart-attack.&nbsp;
My mother was on the phone and looked out into the hallway and saw a figure
of a man standing there, looking at her like, "Get off the phone!"&nbsp;
My mother quickly hung up with her friend and called thehospital, fearing
the worst, that it was her father standing in the hallway looking at her.&nbsp;
Mom called and talked to my grandma and grandpa, everything was as fine
as could be expected, but, who was the guy in the hallway?Mom did not realize
that she was not the only one who could "see" Bill.&nbsp; My sister and
I would see him walk through the hallway, walk through the kitchen, hear
him walk up and down the stairs, open doors and all other sorts of nonsense.&nbsp;
One night, I was in the bedroom watching t.v. with my grandpa and heard
my grandma call for him.</b>
<br><b>"Bill, (my grandfather as well as our vaporous house guest's name)&nbsp;
what did you go into the kitchen for?"</b>
<br><b>"I wasn't in the kitchen, I'm in here with Jo and Mis."&nbsp; My
grandpa answered."I'm telling you, I saw you in the kitchen."&nbsp; my
grandma insisted.All my mother could do was laugh, she knew who was really
in the kitchen...We saw "Bill" on a regular basis til February of 1980.&nbsp;
The last sighting by someone other than "the weirdos" occurred then.&nbsp;
"Bill" was seen leaving, wearing an overcoat, which was not his regular
wardrobe. Grandma and Grandpa joked that he went out to dinner with them
and found another family to go home with.&nbsp; "Bill" evidently checked
himself out in the mirror before he left.&nbsp; My mom and a family friend
were sitting in the living room and saw "Bill" reflected in the mirror.&nbsp;
They watched him walk down the hall and into my Grandparents' bedroom.&nbsp;
The family friend yelled, "Mom, you've got company!"</b>
<br><b>It was a while before any research was done to determine the origin
of our "resident spook".&nbsp; I don't know if this is the truth or not,
but, here goes...&nbsp; According to the testimony of a few neighbors and
a&nbsp; gentleman who was on staff with the fire department, there had
been a suicide several years prior to the sighting.&nbsp; Sometime in the
1950's.&nbsp; The scoop is that a middle-aged man discovered that his wife
was being unfaithful.&nbsp; He got ready for work as usual, kissed her
good-bye, walked down to the basement and through the garage.&nbsp; When
the wife didn't hear him leave, she&nbsp; went downstairs to the garage
and check and make sure everything was okay.&nbsp; She found him swinging
from the rafters.&nbsp; There are theories as to why he appeared when he
did.&nbsp; Perhaps my grandfather having a severe heart-attack "aroused"
something in the spirit of the perpetually wronged husband.&nbsp; It could
be that he waited for the right oppertunity when the</b>
<br><b>family would be more receptive to him.&nbsp; Or maybe he was waiting
for "sensitives"to validate his haunting.</b>
<br><b>I would like to say this is the end of "Bill", but it's just the
beginning.&nbsp; He's been heard playing the piano in my Grandma's basement.&nbsp;
He started a lawnmower that did not have a spark-plug in it.&nbsp; (don't
ask, I'm not a mechanic.)&nbsp; Several people have heard him open a door
that has since been sealed shut.&nbsp; It has a very distinct slam to it.&nbsp;
I've had friends scared to death to stay longer than fifteen minutes in
my grandma's home when I lived there during my teens and early twenties,
because they just "knew" something was there.&nbsp; Watching.&nbsp; Waiting.&nbsp;
Wanting to be seen.&nbsp; And, boy, has he been seen.&nbsp; As I mentioned
previously, the haunting kinda slacked off around 1980.&nbsp; Not to say
that we didn't all experience that familiar chill from time to time, but
nothing much manifested.&nbsp; Until 1988...1988 Was a bad year.&nbsp;
My grandfather passed away.&nbsp; He wasn't very old, and that added insult
to injury as well.&nbsp; It seemed like the events coincided with his passing.&nbsp;
I was now living with my grandma.&nbsp; My sister Missy had come to visit.&nbsp;
We were in the kitchen doing dishes, listening to the radio.&nbsp; Normal
teenage things.&nbsp; We heard the door between the garage and basement
swing open and close.&nbsp; We heard the distinct sound of footsteps on
the concrete floor, the slow tread of someone walking up the stairs.&nbsp;
Sounds pretty normal, right?&nbsp; Wrong!!</b>
<br><b>We had not heard the garage door open.&nbsp; Grandma was gone.&nbsp;
No one was in the basement.&nbsp; My sister and I stood in the kitchen
and watched as the door-knob turned.&nbsp; We didn't stand around to ask
questions, we were out of there! That's where it began and lasted for ten
years.&nbsp; Things would move, a voice would be heard.&nbsp; I mentioned
the piano playing and such.&nbsp; There was a lot more materializing.&nbsp;
As my sisters and I began to have children, we would notice my niece or
my son looking into the hallway and giggling.&nbsp; We would catch something
moving out of the corner of our eyes.&nbsp; My niece told me about the
face that she would see in the mirror of my grandmother's antique wash-stand.&nbsp;
She said there was a man in there</b>
<br><b>trying to get out.&nbsp; Try as we might, we couldn't get a better
explanation than that.&nbsp; I awoke one night to see "Bill"&nbsp; looking
into my son's crib.&nbsp; This angered me for some reason.&nbsp; I sat
straight up in bed and said, "Look, you've messed with me all my life,
leave my son alone!"&nbsp; He disappeared and reappeared in the hallway.&nbsp;
(My sisters and I always saw something in the hallway).&nbsp; As far as
my family is concerned, "Bill" is still there.&nbsp; In addition to the
"ghosts" of two dogs and a cat that like to chase my Grandma's cat through
the house.I don't think I've actually gone in somewhere and not felt that
twinge, that something was there that couldn't be seen by the human eye.&nbsp;
I guess it's residual things I've picked up on.&nbsp; Nearly ever place
I've lived, with the exception of my current residence, has had something
there.&nbsp; My husband jokes that I'm a "spook magnent".&nbsp; What makes
it worse is that I work in a hospital, and I sometimes get that, "twinge"
when heading to the cafeteria or whatever.</b>
<br><b>My sisters are the same way, as are our children and spouses.&nbsp;
In fact, two ghosts "suckered" us when my younger sister went to buy her
house.&nbsp; We went on a walk-through, looked at each other and said,
"Nothing here, this is cool.&nbsp; Clean as a whistle!"&nbsp; Yeah right.&nbsp;
Within one week of my sister and her family moving in, cabinets opened
and shut, she saw someone standing in her kitchen that didn't quite belong.&nbsp;
She was sitting on the couch, reading.&nbsp; The couch faces the kitchen.She
had the sensation that someone was watching her.&nbsp; She looked up, no
one there.&nbsp; However, when she closed her eyes, she "saw" a short woman
wearing a pink dress standing near her sink.&nbsp; She had silver hair
pulled back in a bun and did not seem</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;very happy over being seen.&nbsp; My sister put down the book
and said to her "renter" that she didn't care if she was there, she was
there long before she and my brother in law signed the papers.&nbsp; As
long as she behaved and did not scare anyone, nothing would happen.&nbsp;
About that time, she heard things in the basement.&nbsp; She walked downstairs
and sensed a little boy.&nbsp; That little boy is my son's "buddy".&nbsp;
The boy is very mischievous.&nbsp; He likes to rewind movies, change radio
stations and likes to play darts.&nbsp; My middle sister watched in amazement
one night as one whizzed past her and hit the board.&nbsp; She said, "well,
if you wanted to play that bad, all you had to do was ask!"&nbsp; As you
can see, we take these things real seriously.</b>
<br><b>Since my youngest sister has moved in with my younger sister, the
happenings have been more pronounced.&nbsp; It sounds like furniture is
being moved in the basement, someone walks down the hall every night to
my youngest sister's room and "checks" on her.&nbsp; I was there last night
(10/19/00) and was in the basement with my middle sister.&nbsp; We were
sitting at my brother-in law's computer, shopping on line.&nbsp; The computer
desk is right outside the laundry room, making it unbearably hot.&nbsp;
I looked at my sister and said, "Jeez, it's hot in here.&nbsp; Almost makes
one wish for one of the spooks to show up and cool the place</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;down."&nbsp; My sister looked and me and shook her head, "I
can't believe you said that, you idiot!"&nbsp; About three minutes later,
the temperature dropped in the basement, dryer still on.&nbsp; I looked
at my sister and the hair was standing up on her arms.&nbsp; I had goose
bumps.&nbsp; I started to laugh, "Now, that's service.&nbsp; What are you
going to do for an encore?"&nbsp; No sooner where those words out of my
mouth than I felt something tug at the back of my hair.&nbsp; I looked
at my sister, eyes wide, and said, "If I'm lyin, I'm dying, but something
just pulled my hair!"&nbsp; She simply looked at me and said, "Maybe now
you'll learn to be careful of what you ask for!"</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Mothers Love From Beyond the Grave</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: GaryGARYW@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a true story. What I am about to tell you occurred during
the summer</b>
<br><b>of 1980. My wife and I had bought a mobile home and had it placed
in a very</b>
<br><b>nice park in Southeast Fort Worth Texas. We had one daughter age
three.</b>
<br><b>Everything went fine until early one morning around three am. "Gray,"
"Gary,"</b>
<br><b>I was suddenly awakened by a woman's voice calling my name. I sat
up and</b>
<br><b>listened to the stillness. I must have imagined it I thought. The
stillness s</b>
<br><b>was broken by the Erie sounding voice again. This time I was wide
awake. By</b>
<br><b>then my wife was awake too, she grabbed my right arm,"that's your
mother</b>
<br><b>calling you," she said in a shaky voice. "That just can't be, you
know she</b>
<br><b>died three years ago." "Gary," the voice called out again causing
the hair on</b>
<br><b>the back of my neck to stand up. Maybe I should have asked who it
was or what</b>
<br><b>it wanted, but I thought someone was in my trailer uninvited.&nbsp;
The voice was</b>
<br><b>coming from next to our daughter's room down the hall. I jumped
up in my</b>
<br><b>underwear and ran from our bedroom into the hall, turning on the
light as I</b>
<br><b>did. Lisa was setting up in bed pointing at a picture of my mother
in the</b>
<br><b>hall. As I carried Lisa to our room I thought I could smell my mothers</b>
<br><b>perfume in the hall. I asked my daughter why she was pointing at
mama's</b>
<br><b>picture and she said, "Mama here, in my rood daddy."&nbsp; Later
that night we</b>
<br><b>could here her calling my name scaring us badly. I had checked the
place out</b>
<br><b>so I knew it was secure.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning I went out to get the
paper and as I came back towards</b>
<br><b>the trailer I saw that our daughters screen was bent and lying on
the ground.</b>
<br><b>I saw where someone had pried it off. I called the police and they
said</b>
<br><b>something must have scared him off because a locked window would
not have</b>
<br><b>stopped this pervert. He had raped other young girls. He was shot
that</b>
<br><b>morning later on around daybreak just down the street. He must have
been</b>
<br><b>trying to get into Lisa's room around the time my mother woke us
up. She had</b>
<br><b>told me on her death bed that she would always watch out for my
family.</b>
<br><b>Thanks Mom.</b>

<p><b>A Visit From My Bother</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: joycevradenburg@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Me and Frank were always very close to each other. He was my
youngest brother, and I loved him dearly. When we grew up, he married my
best friend Jane.</b>
<br><b>I lived in SouthLyon, Michigan at the time I had a visit from Frank.
He and Jane plus their four boys all lived in Portland Oregon.</b>
<br><b>It was the early morning, November 10th, 1992. Around 6am. I was
suddenly awaken, by a tap on the shoulder. I looked up and there stood
Frank my brother! He backed up a little and I got a better look at him.
"How did you get here Frank?" I asked, but he just stared at me and, said.
"Tell Jane I love her." I look closely at Frank and notice he had shaven
his beard off, something he had never done before.. His appearance was
very clean, which seem odd, for he had a drinking problem. And would get
drunk often. He wore a red pladed shirt and blue jeans. His front tooth
was no longer missing. So, I thought he also had his teeth done.</b>
<br><b>But when he told me "To tell Jane he loved her." I replied back.
"Why don't you? What's going on Frank?" I continued to ask. He said nothing
back, but started towards the kitchen. I told him as he was walking away.
"You might as well put on a pot of coffee, and I'll get dress. Just than
I heard the front door shut and he was gone.</b>
<br><b>It made me a little angry, and I thought since my older brother
Mike was renting the house next door. Frank might of went there. I called
over at Mike's and told him Frank was in town. To my surprise. Mike said."He
never seen him. But he had to go to work and couldn't talk right now."
So, I tried to get into my regular choirs of house work. When suddenly
as I went back into my bedroom. A cold chill went right thru my soul. Something
I can't explain! But it made me go to the phone and I called Jane in Portland
Oregon.</b>
<br><b>I thought I dialed a wrong number, for a woman's voice answered
the phone. I said "Is this Franks house?" She replied. "Just a moment,
I'll get Jane on the phone!"&nbsp; When Jane got on. She said in a low
voice "Joyce? I answered back. "Hey Jane. How did Frank get here in Michigan?"
She was so surprise, because I never call long distance. But I almost fainted
when she replied. "He couldn't have been there, Joyce. I have some terrible
news. Last night or early this morning. I found Frank, he had hung himself
late last night or early this morning. What do you mean you seen Frank
this morning?" I told her the details and, she had told me, that last night
Frank had shaven his beard off. Took some sad country music. Titled "In
the real world." Went out into the barn. She thought he was just going
on one of his drunks, and feeling sorry for himself. He never mentioned
suicide to her. In the early dawn, she could hear the music, for it was
blasting, and you could hear it all</b>
<br><b>Out there in the barn, as she tried to open the door, it would hardly
budge. She yelled for Frank to open it, but when he would not. She push
it open, to find she had also pushed his body as it was swinging near the
door, with his eyes gazing at her,. She ran for the house, but told me.
It was like running thru mud. In her mind this had to be a nightmare.</b>
<br><b>Later on she told me Frank was wearing a red pladded shirt, and
blue jeans. I gave her his message. "Tell Jane I love her."</b>
<br><b>My older brother Mike. Believes me, for I had already told him,
Frank had visited me this morning. Also Jane was very religious, and they-
{Her close} friends were saying a prayer, for Jane to get the courage to
call the family. When I called I interrupted the prayer! It was already
answered. Than I had to give the horrible news to my Parents and, other
brothers and sisters...</b>
<br><b>Jane was also on The good morning America. For people helping others
thru times as these.</b>
<br><b>I remember we, had an Memorial service for Frank of our own here
in Michigan. I was sleeping. My husband who was awake noticed a lovely
Hawk standing on a branch of our pine tree. Only 5 ft from the window.
My husband knowing how Frank loved Hawks and kept a lot of them on his
place. Thought he should wake me up, before the Hawk flew away. I got up
to see what was the big deal, and with my coffee in one hand. I watched
Frank's favorite bird. He folded his wings and wouldn't move for around
30 minutes. Than as waking up. Off he flew! We never see Hawks this close
to the house. I knew in my heart, this was God's way of letting me know.
"Frank is as free as his friends the hawks were. That very same day in
Oregon, Jane also released Franks hawks. Except they didn't want to leave,
and it took a few days, than slowly they left.</b>
<br><b>I left South Lyon since than. But I have had a lot of experiences
with ghost and sprits ever since I was very young, but that's another story...</b>
