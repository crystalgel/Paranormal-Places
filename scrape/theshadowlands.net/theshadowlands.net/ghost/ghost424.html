very big panther).standing up right. it's eyes looked to be a red &amp;
yellow.&amp; a mouth like a saw by that time her little brother thought
we was playing with him or trying to scare him to death, but before we

More Info on WMA<br>
<br>

<br>
I was a cadet at WMA from 2003- 2005 and most of what you have said on
your site I have seen or heard of from other cadets. One story that you
don't have though is about the newist barracks at the school, Tillitson
Hall. In<br>
2004 I was an officer and was good friends with the TAC on my floor.
One night he called me into his office and asked me to watch some
camera footage taken earlyer that night. The screen I was watching
showed the images taken from 4 different cameras at the same time, 2
inside on my floor and 2 on the outside of the building at opposit
corners. As I watched I saugh a glowing orb fly out of the woods behind
the building and hit the side of the barracks. At that instant the orb
appeared in the hall and was picked up by both of the inside cameras.
It moved very quickly down the hall and then went out through the side
wall again and was instantly picked up by the outside camera again. It
then moved back into the woods and was gone. My TAC thought he was
going crazy, but there it was on camera. This video was also seen by
several of my fellow cadets and they also could not come up with any
logical answer to what it was or how it could have been faked. What I
find even more strange about this is that Tillitson has only been open
since 2002 and nothing bad has happened there unlike most of the other
buildings at that school. Anyway I hope this story is helpful you you
guys.<br>

I Have Also had My Share of Spirit Encounters<br>
<br>
By: BroadwayDepp@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I've always been sensitive to spirits being present. For as long as i
can remember there have always been someone there in the cornor of my
room at night or creaking in the walls.&nbsp; My house was built during
the great depression. My mom, grandfather and great grandfather(who
built the house) have all lived there.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember one night, i was five or six, i think,
and it was summer.&nbsp; I was in my backyard, it&nbsp; was pretty
late, and i looked in the bushes and saw a face.&nbsp; Being the curius
little kid that i am i nudged alittle closer.&nbsp; The face was weird
looking, almost unhuman, and was a weird tint of green and almost
transparent.&nbsp; As i drew closer it just popped out of the
bushes.&nbsp; I screamed and ran to the front porch where my mom, dad
and brother were.&nbsp; I never told anyone about that face.<br>
Eventually that incident was drawn out of my head.&nbsp; I hadnt
thought about it and what with other things going on, frankly, i just
didnt care.&nbsp; Until one day, my second grade class when on a feild
trip to the historical society.&nbsp; One of the exibates was of a
small bedroom in 1850's time.&nbsp; It was in an atticy kind of bed
room with the ceiling slanted, and i went towards the bed.&nbsp; And
for a few seconds, this person was lying on the bed.&nbsp; She looked
up at me and then she was gone.&nbsp; i was so frightened i just ran
out of the room and hid downstairs till my teacher and the rest of the
class came down.&nbsp; <br>
There would be sightings every now and then.&nbsp; Mostly in the
basement.&nbsp; I would hear someone hiding behind the water heater and
bookshelves and would eventually just refuse to go down there.&nbsp;
When my mom asked me about this i told her there was someone down
there.&nbsp; She refused to beleive this and i just stopped trying to
convince her.&nbsp; The only time i can say that a spirit just scared
the crap out of me was when i was in 5th grade.&nbsp; I was in the park
with my dad and was visiting the memorial.&nbsp; While my dad was doing
something (i dont remember what) i went off to one of the stones
farther away.&nbsp; I leaned up next to the stone and was reading the
description on it. And while i did so, a man came up to me.&nbsp; He
looked very frightened.&nbsp; He bent down next to me and asked me
something, i think about the weather, and he looked like he wanted to
cry or something, i dont know.&nbsp; He kinda looked like...Like when
your dying to ask someone something but you dont know how to ask them,
thats what his face looked like.&nbsp; I remeber asking him if he was
okay and he just burst into tears.&nbsp; He said something like i had
to help him, i was the only one who could help him.&nbsp; He looked so
frantic and desperate that he was scary looking.&nbsp; i didnt know
what else to do so i just ran towards my dad shaking from head to
foot.&nbsp; Looking back i wish i would have helped him...i just didnt
know how.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know there are sceptics out there who will go
around saying "its your mind playing tricks on you" or one of my
mothers personal favorites "its just your imagination" But if we let
that take over our better judgement, no one is going to help these lost
souls.&nbsp; And somebody has to, you just have to be willing to
beleive.<br>

Heidelberg College Ghosts<br>
<br>
By: maerain08@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
<br>
Hi. My name is Christine and I was a student at Heidelberg College
(which is located in Tiffin, Ohio and far from any other places of
civilization). As a Freshman and Sophomore I was lived in France Hall.
France Hall is and has always been an all girls dorm. Another fun fact
about Heidelberg College is that it was one of the first colleges to
allow women to attend. <br>
As a new resident of France Hall, I was told about our most famous
ghost, Ellen. There were a few odd occurrences for example: the normal
cold spots in the Dungeon (aka the basement/laundry room), noises and
whatnot. <br>
During my sophomore year, I pledged into one of the oldest societies on
campus. It was during my pledging process that I learned about the
story of Ellen. Shortly after the Hesperian Society split into two new
societies in 1913 (Euglossian Society and the Philalethean also known
as Eugs and Phis) Ellen wanted to go through the pledging process.
(FYI: Women have to place bids (or asking permission) to join a Greek
Organization. If the group does not believe a woman will benefit from
the society she can be rejected.) <br>
Ellen was rushing Phi and would wear their colours everyday before the
Bidding Day. Sadly, Ellen was not invited into the Philalethean
Society. Greatly upset by this, she went into the attic, wrote and
carved 'Phi or Die' on the walls and rafters. Near the doorway she hung
herself. <br>
Today the door to the attic is locked (I've tried to get in). Normally
Ellen just likes to play around. She has fondly locked me out of my
room when I was in the shower a few times, turned on the TV at all
hours of the night during exam week, and (my favourite) turned the
radio to a different station when a song that my Oma would call dirty
would comes on.<br>
I've also been in the Catacombs under Founders Hall and visited the
'haunted' Meat Room.. It wasn't spooky or anything but I can understand
why a lot of the halls are blocked off now. Easy to get lost. And the
hooks that used to hang in the Meat Room are no longer there. <br>
Brown Hall is haunted now by a young man who killed himself on the
railroad tracks right behind the campus a few years ago. He likes to
goofy off on the girls floor of that dorm and watch over some of the
students who were close to him before he died. He also likes playing
around in the bathrooms.&nbsp; ???<br>

up&nbsp; off&nbsp; the&nbsp; floor&nbsp; and&nbsp; danced&nbsp;
around&nbsp; the&nbsp; other.&nbsp; things&nbsp; would&nbsp; lift&nbsp;

Another Spooky Encounter<br>
<br>
By: ladymadison22@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
Well I'm back again with another experience, but this time I'm
including one of brother's encounters as well. This may get a little
long so please, just bare with me! :)<br>
My boyfriend (we'll call him Steve) works at his family's farm that's
been around for 124 years. So basically, it's been in the family for 5
generations. There have been a lot of changes, which is expected when
you have a piece of property that's that old, but there are buildings
that remain the same. These buildings (along with a creek that runs
right by the property) I believe are not haunted, but replay things
that happened long ago. Steve has seen these images and explained them
to me. For instance, the "milk house" is an old building that still
stands but is now used as a work shop. At the right moment, you can
watch Steve's great grandfather working in the building. (He passed
away many years ago.) Also, in the old part of the barn, he's seen
"helping hands" (or "workers") from the past walking around. They never
seem to notice that Steve is even there. <br>
These encounters seem pleasant. And if you knew they were past
relatives I can understand why you might be glad to see them. But the
experience I had was NOT pleasant and I was definately NOT glad to see
it. Back in the 1920's, one of Steve's relatives had a 2-year-old girl.
This poor little girl wandered away from the house, fell into the creek
by the garden, and drowned. She wasn't discovered until the next
morning...her body had floated down-stream. This story is important
because it plays a part in my encounter.<br>
About a year ago, I decided to take the row boat out onto the creek. I
have a little girl...2-years-old at the time...whom I left in the care
of Steve since we didn't have a life jacket for her. This was my first
time in the boat and I was excited about seeing mother nature since the
land scape was beautiful around the area. I must have been on the water
for only fifteen minutes before I heard a loud splash close to the
bank. I looked to my right but didn't see anything...not even ripples
in the water indicating that something had fallen in. This made me
extremely curious so I decided to row the boat closer to the bank. Now
the bank is about a foot above the water level, and the water is
roughly about 3 feet deep. Before I could even grab a hold of the oars
I saw (what I thought was my daughter since she was small and had brown
hair) splashing around in the water and swinging her arms desperately
back and forth as if trying to hold onto something. What I didn't
realize at the time was that there was absolutely no sound of the
splashing. Being deathly scared for my daughter's life, I didn't think
about it. I jumped into the water and began swimming desperately
towards the bank. I can't even begin to explain how I felt. All I can
say...is that I was more determined than ever to reach her. I remember
stopping once my feet could touch the bottom and searching for her, and
to my horror I didn't see her anywhere. The creek was a brown color and
so I couldn't see the bottom. I was diving down and grabbing anything I
found to see if it was her. I seriously was hysterical at this point in
time. I kept saying, "No, no, please God, no." And shouting my
daughter's name. Now Steve, along with my daughter, heard me splashing
into the water and then heard me calling to my daughter. He could see
the empty boat a little ways down the creek and started running to find
out what was wrong. Also, Steve's grandmother was in the garden (which
was located just behind the brush of the bank where I was at) and heard
me as well. She too, got up and headed towards me to investigate. I
remember hearing her asking me what was wrong. To that I just kept
repeating that my daughter was in the water and asking where she was. I
believe I was on the verge of fainting until I saw Steve holding my
daughter on the bank. Then confusion kicked in. I was so thrilled to
see my daughter but at the same time dumbfounded about it. He helped me
onto the bank and I held my daughter like there was no tomorrow. While
I was doing that, Steve's grandmother was explaining to him what she
heard and saw. I had them both confused as well. I told them what I saw
and Steve slid into the water and began to look around but said he
didn't see or feel anything. His grandmother was silent while this was
going on, but then spoke up with this grief-stricken look on her face.
She said, "Oh my, it must've been Hariette." Both Steve and his
grandmother hung their heads but I was still clueless since I had never
heard the story before. That's when she explained to me what happened
all those years ago. Slowly it all started to make sense: why I hadn't
seen the ripples in the water, why I didn't hear the splashing, and why
in the seconds it took me to get to her she had vanished. Since that
day, I have never gone near that part of the bank and I make sure my
children do the same (I have a son as well). It's horrorfying what I
had seen and went through and I pray that no one has to go through
that. <br>
My brother's story I'll keep short. Once again, I know this is long but aren't the long ones so much more interesting? :)<br>
My brother (David) is a semi truck driver. He runs his rounds all week
long and comes home for the weekends. As some of you may know, there
are times when you're driving long into the night. On one particular
night, David was driving down a road heading back towards the
interstate with a buddy of his in the truck. He was making good time,
wasn't tired yet, and decided to wait and stop at the next rest area
down the interstate. I believe he said it was between 10 and 11pm when
they saw her. His buddy saw her first and started screaming (as David
would say, "like a little girl"). When David turned to look at his
buddy, is attention went immediatly to the passenger-side window.
There, a woman had some how clasped onto the outside of the door and
was staring at him through the window. He described her as pale white,
shoulder-length blonde hair, and dark eyes. He said she kind of glowed,
but claimed the full moon could've made her look that way. The woman
was there for only a couple of seconds before she disappeared. David's
buddy said he'd had enough fun for one night and crawled into the back
of the semi and onto one of the bunks.&nbsp; <br>
A few weeks later (during daylight hours) my brother found himself on
that same road and stopped at a local truck stop to eat. There were
other truck drivers there and out of the blue he asked, "I know you're
all gunna think I'm crazy, but have any of you seen a woman on the side
of your truck? Late at night, while you're driving down this road?" <br>
This is the story they told him:<br>
About 10 years ago, a woman was standing on the side of the road. She
was alone and having car trouble late at night. She spotted a semi down
the road, heading in her direction. In an attempt to wave him down, she
walked out into the middle of the road and started waving her arms.
Apparantely, the truck driver was so exhausted that he didn't even see
her(or so people think). He ran her over and didn't stop...just kept
going. To this day, no one has been pressed with charges for the crime.
Now they say that any semi that drives down that road at night, could
be a suspect to the woman. She'll peer into the passenger-side window,
looking for the driver who ran her over. And seeking justice.<br>
Thanks for your time.<br>

Animal Ghosts<br>
<br>
By: ghosthunter1984@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I read the article on animal ghosts and I have a story to share. Post
it if you wish. I had an old dog named Mutley who lived for 14 years
before having to be put down back in 2002. Let me tell you almost
immediately afterwards her spirit came back. In life the dog had the
habit of sitting in the hallway and banging her tail against the doors
when walking by which I heard for a solid year ot so after putting her
down. Very loud and unmistakable. Then one summer I was mowing my lawn
and I saw her standing by the shed in broad daylight before she walked
behind the shed and vanished. Cold breezed and just the sense the dogs
spirits was still around were commonplace. The daylight incident was
the only sighting, it was mostly felt and heard. What is strange is
that after getting a new pup the incidents stopped completely and it
has been about 2 years or so since the last incidents occured. Animals
can and do return after death. I kept my eye out for the dog for some
time after the backyard sighting, it did not frighten me, it was never
frightening or un-nerving, strange yes, bizarre and mind jarring, yes.
The backyard sighting was actually one of the liftime memories that
just chills me, it was as clear as day. The dog is not buried in the
yard but the ashes were scattered. I do not know to this day what it
all meant but I am sure it had something to do with maybe getting a new
animal for the home.<br>

Getting Used to Ghosts<br>
<br>
By: BRUTHERFORD124@aol.com<br>
<br>
my name is billy and i live in houston, tx. i have had strange
experenices since i was a child. my family comes from tenn. mountain
people are very superstitious people and i had heard strange stories
since i was a child. some years back my grandmother amy passed. she
lived in ind. and i couldn't attend the services. two days after her
passing, i was almost asleep in the bedroom and my wife was watching
t.v. in the living room. the bedroom door opened and as i looked up i
saw what i thought was my wife in a blue robe and walk past me into the
bathroom. no lights where truned on and no lights where truned on in
the bathroom. i layed there thinking just how long she was in there and
got up to see if there was a problem. after seeing that she wasn't in
the bathroom, i&nbsp; had a strange feeling. maybe she came out and
walked passed me and i just didn't see her. i went out into the living
room and there was my wife still laying on the couch and then she
looked up and asked, how long have you been standing there?? i said,
just a second and she went pale white and said, somebody had been
standing there for a few minutes and she thought it was me. then we
both knew something very strange had just happened to the both of us.
we where very unerved. after a few minutes i went back to bed. the next
day, weird things began to happen. noise's through out the house,
things being knocked off of book shelves, opening and closing of doors.
videos being scattered on the floor and this became the norm for along
time. it didn't scare us an my aunt said i was my grandmother had came
to see me since i couldn't go to her. i loved my grandmother very much
and a part of me liked the idea of her being there. my daughter became
very used to it and would say things like, grandma if your going to
make a mess atleast clean it up yourself.. she stayed with us for a
long time and then one day it was just over. my aunt said she had made
her point. we had moved and was waitng for our place to be ready, so we
stayed in a local inn, for a few weekes and then strange things started
to happen at the inn and we knew it wasn't my grandmother. objects
would levitate and fly across the room and who ever this was, liked to
tear&nbsp; up the bathroom. rolls of tolite paper would fly out of the
bathroom and roll across the floor, right before our eyes. and still we
wern't scared, even though we knew it was the same ghost.. as time went
by and everywhere we moved these things would still happen and we could
tell when the ghosts had change by the way they did things. somemore
time had passed and we thought that it had ended. now myself and my
wife and daughter live in a small apt. and have lived here for 3 years
and in the past few months, these strange things started happing again.
now we see, full figures of people walk through the apt. rearanging of
items througout the place and everynight, items being knocked off the
frig, and set in the floor. my wife triped over a candy bowl sitting in
the floor by the front door the other day and we know for a fact that
there was no way it was there the night before. we never get scared,
ever with the ghost shadows and noise and so on. we don't know way this
happens to us and don't ask.. i am a pro. musician and my best frien
and drummer died in a car wreck when we were 18. i am now 47, and he
comes to me in my dreams, every so often. and i always ask the same
question, what are you doing here, your dead. he always says he is just
checking on me. here's the weird thing. this has been going on since
1978 and i grew older, so did he. he's not the 18 year old kid i
remember. he only come once or twice a year, but he always shows up.
mountain people say if you touch the dead, you won't dream about them.
maybe i should have or maybe i didn't for a reason??????<br>

My Aunt<br>
<br>
By: kellybellyyxoxo@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Hello.&nbsp; I have experiences to share with you. My aunt passed away
this February and it has been a big loss to everyone in my family. For
some reason she has been haunting me. Well, my aunt was a fashionista
and loved makeup and nail polish. I keep all my nail polish including
some she gave me all together on my nightstand next to my bed. I would
always hear clanking around there and my nail polish would go missing.
Nobody in my family ever took any without my asking so I figured it was
just my aunt. She never presented herself; I would just get cold sweats
here and there and nothing out of the usual. One night, I lay wide
awake in my bed and I found myself staring at the wall, like deeply
entranced in it. After a few moments, I could see a little light on the
wall. It looked as if someone had a projector across the room and was
playing a movie on my wall. All I could see was a blurry image of my
aunt. I could hear her voice saying something but I couldn&#8217;t understand
what. I eventually fell asleep and had a dream that she was trying to
tell me goodbye. Never again have I heard from her however just a few
moments ago before I started typing this, I felt a presence next to me
and could see black out of the corner of my eye. Not sure who it was&#8230;
maybe my aunt saying hello?<br>

TOLD ME THISI GOT REAL FREAKED OUT. NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO ME SINCE
THAN UNTIL WE MOVED INTO OUR NEW HOUSE. I WAS A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
AND I HAD MET A FRIEND THAT COULD ACTUALLY SEE SPRITS. WHEN SHE SEEN
THEM THEY WERE ALAWYS LIKE HEAT WAVES AND SOMETIMES THE TEMPERTURE
WOULD DROP. I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT KNEW ABOUT HER ABILITY CAUSE OUR
OTHER FRINEDS THOUGHT WE WERE CRAZY THAT WE BELIVED IN"GHOSTS". I
LEARNED ALOT ABOUT WHAT I HAVE THROUGH HER AND HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM.
SHE WAS BORN WITH HER PSHYIC ABILITIES AND ME I WAS SLOWILY STARTING TO
UNDERSTAND WHAT I HAD.ONE PARTICULAR DAY I HAD A HUGE FIGHT&nbsp; WITH
A FRIEND AND I BROUGHT THAT NEGATIVITY BACK HOME WITH ME. I HAPPENED TO
BE SITTING ON MY BED WHEN A POSTER OF MINE BEGAN TO CHANGE FORM. THE
FACE ON MY POSTER STARTED TO LOOK SINISTER...KIND&nbsp; OF LIKE THE
DEVIL. I FREAKED OUT. I INSTANLY CALLED MY PSYIC FRIEND AND SHE
QUICKILY TOLD ME TO READ PSALMS OUT OF THE BIBLE. AS I DID THAT AS
QUICKILY IT HAD APPEARED IT WENT AWAY. I TORE UP ALL OF MY POSTERS SO
THAT "IT" COULDN'T COME BACK. AS I STARTED TO CALM DOWN MY FRIEND TOLD
ME THAT WHATEVER IS IN MY HOUSE THRIVES ON NEGATIVITY AND I NEED TO TRY
NOT TO BRING IT INTO THE HOUSE. I WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE HOUSE THAT
EVER SENSED ANYTHING.AS I GOT OLDER MY ABILIYT GOT STRONGER. I WAS NINE
MONTHS PREGNANT WITH MY FIRST DAUGHTER WHEN MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER
PASSED. WE WERE REALLY CLOSE AND BEACUSE OF ME BEING SO FAR ALONG IN MY
PREGNACY I DIDN'T ATTEND HER FUNNERAL WHICH TORE ME UP. AS I WAS HAVING
HER I FELT HER PRESSENCE IN THE DEIVERY ROOM WITH ME. IN A CORNER OF
THE ROOM WAS THIS REALLY BRIGHT LIGHT THAT WAS UN EXPLAINABLE BECAUSE
IT WAS NOT THERE BEFORE THE DOCTORS STARTED ON MY C-SECTION BUT AS SOON
AS THEY WERE CLOSE TO GETTING THE BABY OUT I SEEN THE LIGHT. HER
PRESENSE WAS REALLY CALIMING. AFTER THAT MY ABILIYT WHICH I NOW KNOW AS
BEING A "SENSITIVE" WAS REALLY POWERFUL. AFTER MY DAUGHTER WAS BORN HER
FATHER AND I TOOK HER TO NHIS GRANDPARENTS FARM. WE DECIDED TO SPEND
THE NIGHT AT HIS AUNT'S HOUSE INSTED OF GOING BACK TO HIS GRANDPARENTS
HOUSE.HIS AUNT HAD MADE UP A SPARE BEDROOM FOR ME AND MY DAUGHTER&nbsp;
SINCE HER FATHER AND I WERE NOT MARRIED SHE DIDN'T ALLOWED US TO SHARE
A ROOM TOGETHER. AFTER BEING IN THE ROOM FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES I
STARTED FEELING REAL FUNNY. I ALSO STARTED GETTING FLASHES WHAT SEEMED
TO BE VISIONS OF WHO WAS IN THE ROOM WITH ME. I HAD SEEN A GIRL IN HER
TEENS IN MY VISIONS AND BY THE WAY SHE WAS LOOKING AT ME SHE DIDN'T
WANT ME THERE. I FELT IF I STAYED IN THAT ROOM THAT SOMETHING BAD WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME. I STARTED ASKING TO SEE MY BOYFRIEND AND I TOLD
HIM THAT I WANTED TO GO BACK TO HIS GRANDMA'S HOUSE AND NOW. HE COULD
TELL I WAS FREAKING OUT SO WE GATHERED UP OUR THINGS AND LEFT.WHEN WE
GOT TO HIS GRANDMA'S HOUSE IHE ASKED ME WHY I DIDN'T WANT TO STAY THERE
AND I EXPLAINED TO HIM WHAT I FELT AND SEEN. I COULD TELL I FREAKED HIM
OUT CAUSE HE GOT PALE AS A GHOST. HE TOLD ME THAT THE ROOM I WAS IN WAS
HIS DEAD COUSINS ROOM BEFOR SHE DIED YEARS AGO. I WENT TOTALLY
BLANK.NOBODY NEVER TOLD ME WHO ROOM IT WAS SO THERE WAS NO WAY FOR ME
TO KNOW THAT. FROM THAT POINT ON HE BELIVED THAT I HAD SOME KIND OF
ABILITY.AS I GET OLDER AND WISER MY ABILITY DOES TOO. I'VE BEEN TOLD BY
A RELIOUS PERSON THAT I HAVE A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT THAT ATTRACTS
"SPIRITS"TO ME AS WELL AS MY CHILDREN.WHATEVER I HAVE I GAVE TO MY
CHILDREN AND I BELIVE THAT MY OLDEST DAUGHTER MAY ACTUALLY SEE
"SPIRITS" SHE IS ONLY 6 BUT I HAVE SO MANY STORIES BOUT WHAT HAVE
HAPPENED TO HER THAT I PROBALLY SHOULD WRITE A BOOK ABOUT IT.<br>

My Own Ghostly Experiences<br>
<br>
<br>
By: angel_eyz_17_2006@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I could not have been more than 2 years old when it started. I
obviously dont remember it, but my family does. i was down for a nap
when it happened. in my dead sleep i started speaking italian, i didnt
even know english that well yet, and none of my family spoke italian
near me. out of fear of me being possesed my mom called my grandmother
and let her hear. my grandmother recognized the words right away and
said i was speaking italian. when i woke up my mom asked who i was
talking to and i told her that i was talking to her nanu (grandfather).
he died long before i was born and i saw no pictures of him, but i
described him to a T. <br>
The strange things stopped until i got pregnant. this time i dreampt i
was in a car accident. i was driving and i had a green light. just as i
was passing the intersection someone hit me on the passenger side door.
i was very badly hurt my left ear was cut off and my liver cut in half.
my face was badly hurt and close to death. then i had another dream
that my brother and i were crossing a bridge, and he was playing on the
edge and fell. in my dream he did not die he was just in a lot of pain.
exactly one week after the dream of my brother he was diagnosed with
cancer. my family believe this dream was a warning to get him help. the
same day we found out he had cancer we also found out my uncle was in a
car accident. before i knew the details i described it to my mom. after
she got off the phone her face was pale white. i had described
everything correctly. <br>
the next thing happened two days after my miscairage. i had just fallen
asleep the first time since the miscairage. i was asleep for about two
hours when i suddenly woke to a baby crying, there are no babies
anywhere near my house so i automatically assumed i was going crazy.
then i started dreaming of a baby being held by my family and my
fiancee's. i may have imagined my family, but there was no way i
imagined his. i never met any of the members of his family that died
but i knew exactly what they looked like and even sounded like. now the
baby cries are every night for atleast an hour. sometimes i even feel
something laying between me and my fiancee and no one is there. i
truely believe this is my daughter telling me that she is ok.&nbsp; <br>

New day Different Story<br>
<br>
By: wizard_of_oz_123457@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok a new day a different story well my story still sends shivers up my
back and my mother's. Well my little sister who now is 6 will out of
the blue say that she sees our grandfather (we called him Pop-pop).
Yeah nothing strange about that but see when Pop-pop passed away from a
stroke not only did my mother know exactly the time when she was
driving to the hospital but she was pregnant with my sister. Now one
might say that my mother had a connection with my Pop-pop (her father)
but I don't know. well about last year, my siblings and I were cleaning
the playroom where all the toys were put into bins in the corner of the
room when my sister (the 6 year old) said that there was a man in the
corner and she pointed to the bins and she told us that he said he was
sorry. For what we have no clue, but we don't have ANY pictures of him
around the house and so when I was looking through my photo album I
came accross a picture of my pop-pop and myself on my first day of
school. Erin (the 6 year old) came into my room and said "That's the
man Brittany the one that said he was sorry!" we ran downstairs and
told my mom this of course. Now right after that we started watching a
comedy movie when Erin said "mommy the man from today is in the chair
and he looks sad" that's what I find scary but it makes me feel safe to
know he's watching us (for as long as I know.). Well that's my story
for you and it always creeps out my friends which I find VERY funny
because I'm used to it and they aren't so it's like a whole new
experience.<br>

Real Orb Story<br>
<br>
By: cecilia_zepeda@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
I was two months pregnant and on an evening of January 07, my husband
and I were in our bedroom with the kids. It was around 9pm and one of
my boys was asleep and the other was laying in my bed starting to drift
but then i seen him starring at the blankets and i was looking hard,
trying to figure out what he was looking at. I asked him what he was
seeing and he said he was looking at a star. His eyes followed
something across the room and at this point I really wanted to know
what hes seeing. I look infront of me while im sitting on the bed and
this point I see the most beautiful ball of white light, floating
around and sitting on my bed next to me and slowly it fades until i
cant see it. Two days later I had a misscariage, it was sad. I just
tell myself maybe that was his or her angel or maybe it was the babys
spirt. What ever it was it was, I have never seen anything like it in
my life, and it wasnt scary to me. My husband was too busy watching tv
so he missed this, but my son and i got to see this awsome thing, I
guess some people call them orbs.&nbsp; <br>

I Don't Really Mind Now<br>
<br>
By: debs41203@kymail.com<br>
<br>
My name is Austin, i&nbsp; have had several experiences, the most
memorable ones i am about to share. First, me, my mom, and my sister,
moved to mason in magoffin county kentucky,(the year is the last little
bit of 2006, and continues into now) and while we were living there
something strange happened.&nbsp; The first couple of weeks were ok,
nothing happened, but then i started getting woken up by a deep voice
that sounded like it was calling my last name "Slone, Slone, wake
up"&nbsp; and i felt someone shaking me, at first i brushed it to the
back of my thoughts because i figured i was dreaming or something, but
then it began to happen every morning between 3:00 and 3:20.&nbsp; I
didn't really mind the company or anything, i just wish they wouldn't
wake me up so early.&nbsp; It happened until i moved again, (to where i
live now) and then a couple of days after getting everything unpacked
and set up, it started happening again, it still happens.&nbsp; Then
one night on my way back home from my tae kwon do class (my grandma was
driving) it was just me and her, and we were talking about my dad, whom
died when i was about 4 or 5 years old, and i got to thinking and asked
my grandma if "Slone" and "Son" sounded anything alike, and she said
they did to her, so im guessing it is my dad telling me everything is
all right.&nbsp; It still happens to this day.&nbsp; I really don't
mind now.<br>

ABOUT CHILDREN AND GHOSTS<br>
<br>
By: vavacious_v@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I HAVE FOUR CHILDREN. THREE GIRLS AND A LITTLE BOY. MY OLDEST DAUGHTER
WAS BORN CHRISTMAS EVE IN 2000. SINCE SHE HAS BEEN TURNED ONE, ALOT OF
CRAZY THINGS HAS HAPPENED TO US.ONE EXPERIENCE WAS ONE NIGHT HER FATHER
AND I WAS SLEPPING AND SHE WAS IN HER ROOM.I HAD THIS DREAM THAT TWO
ANGELS HAD CAME DOWN TO TALK TO ME. I KNEW THEY WERE ANGELS CAUSE I WAS
AT PEACE NOT SCARED AT ALL.AND THERE WERE ALOT OF BRIGHT LIGHT. ANYWAY
THEY WERE TALKING TO ME THROUGH THEY'RE MINDS AND SENDING ME THEY'RE
MESSAGES. THEY TOLD ME NOT TO LEAVE MY DAUGHTER IN HER ROOM BY HRESELF
TOO LONG CAUSE IF I DO HER DOOR WOULD LOCK AND I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
GET TO HER UNTIL ITS TOO LATE.THEY WERE TELLING ME OF A PRESSENCE THAT
WAS IN HER ROOM THAT WAS KIND OF JUST DWELLING THERE JUST WAITINTG.WHEN
I AWOKE I WAS STARTLED AND SHAKEN.IT FELT LIKE I WAS NOT EVEN SLEEP AT
ALL. KIND OF LIKE JUST DAYDREAMING. NEEDLESS TO SAY I NEVER LEFT HER IN
HER ROOM FOR LONG PERIODES AT A TIME.THEN AFTER THAT HAPPENED SHE
STARTED HAVING NIGHTMARES. AGAIN MY DAUGHTER WAS ONLY ONE AT THE TIME
AND ITS NOT COMMON FOR KIDS THAT YOUNG TO HAVE NIGHTMARES BUT IT CAN
HAPPEN. WELL HER NIGHTMARES WERE SO BAD TO WHERE WE ,HER FATHER AND I,
COULDN'T WAKE HER UP. SHE WOULD BE FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE. KICKING AND
SCREAMING.WHEN WE DID GET HER TO WAKE UP SHE WOULD LOOK AT US LIKE
WHAT'S GOING ON AND BE HER HAPPY SELF.THIS SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME.
IT'S ONE THING FOR ME TO HAVE "THEM" MESS WITH ME BUT NOT MY BABY.AS I
EXPLAINED TO YOU BEFORE I HAVE A FRIEND WHO HAS PHSYC ABILITIES. I HAD
BECAME PREGNANT WITH MY SECOND DAUGHTER AND SHE HAD CAME TO STAY WITH
ME AND HELP ME WITH ADJUSTING TO BEING A YOUNG MOM OF TWO.AFTER A
COUPLE OF WEEKS SHE LFET AND WENT BACK HOME. SHE CALLED ME LIKE TWO
DAYS LATER AND TOLD ME WHILE SHE WAS IN MY HOUSE SHE CONDUCTED HER OWN
INVESTIGATION OF MY HOUSE. SHE EXPLAINED TO ME THAT I HAD ALOT OF
SPIRITS THAT SEEM TO BE BOUND TO MY HOME, ESPECIALLY IN MY DAUGHTER'S
ROOM. THIS SCARED ME TO DEATH. SHE HAD TOLD ME HOW MY DAUGHTER WOULD GO
TO THE TOP OF THE STEPS AND JUST LOOK DOWN THE STEPS. AT FIRST I
THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST WAITING FOR HER FATHER TO RETURN HOME BUT REALLY
SHE WAS LOOKING AT A SPRIT THAT WAS BOUND ONLY DOWNSTAIRS.SHE ASKED MY
DAUGHTER WHAT'S WRONG AND SHE WOULD JUST POINT TOTHE SPIRIT WHICH
INDEED MY FREIND SAW. SHE NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT WHAT SHE EXPERIENCED IN
MY HOUSE WHILE SHE WAS THERE CAUSE SHE DIDNT WANT ME TO BE OPENED TO
THEM MORE THAN WHAT I WAS AT THE TIME.ONE THING I FORGOT TO MENTION WAS
WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS BORN SHE WAS BORN WITH WHAT SEEMED TO BE LIKE BOTH
OF HER EARS WERE PIERCED. MY MOTHER TOLD ME THAT MY GODMOTHER TOLD HER
THAT YEARS AGO OLDER PEOPLE BELIVED THAT KIDS THAT WERE BORN WITH
THEY'RE EARS LOOKING LIKE THEY WERE PIERCED WERE ABLE TO SEE GHOSTS. I
DID SOME RESEARCH ON THAT BUT I CAN'T REMEBER THE SCIENTIFIC WORD THAT
SCIENTIST CALLED IT.BUT I DO REMEBER WHEN I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL HAVING
HER THE DOCTOR'S TOLD ME WHAT IT WAS AND FOR ME NOT TO WORRY ABOUT IT.
SHE IS NOW SIX, AND SINCE WE HAVE MOVED TO OUR NEW HOUSE NOTHING HASN'T
HAPPENED..YET. I BELIVE ALL MY CHILDREN EXCEPT MY SON CAN SEE THEM OR
AT LEAST FEEL THEY'RE PRESENCE. SO WHENEVER THEY GET REAL FREAKED OUT
AND DONT WANT TO GO TO THEIR ROOM I LET THEM SLEEP IN THE LIVING ROOM
WITH NO PROBLEM. JUST CAUSE I DONT HAVE THE EYE TO SEE THEM I KNOW THEY
ARE AROUND. I ALSO TEND TO PRAY OVER MY CHILDREN EVERY NIGHT TO MAKE
SURE THEY ARE SAFE AS WELL AS BLESS OUR HOUSE BEFORE WE MOVE IN. WE
STILL GET "VISITORS" BUT THEY DON'T STAY...THEY JUST PASS THROUGH.<br>

Stevens Steak House<br>
<br>
<br>
By:marians@cox.net <br>
<br>
I went there with my mother to have a early super. Was seated at a
table on the second floor next to the fireplace. I could feel someone
watching me the whole time. After we finished the meal we went down to
the bar which was below level, and my mother preceded to take picture
of the bartender and bar. I saw the bottles move behind the bartender
on the back shelf's. When my mother developed the pictures you can see
the bottles in the first shoot were all line up neatly, and then in the
second shoot they were all forward out of line. The story goes that
there was a cemetery there and when the owner decided to build he was
supposed to remove all gravestones and bodies but found it too
expensive, so he just moved most of the stones and others were thrown
to the side. When the workers discovered some of the bodies that were
still there, they called the authorities to remove them properly and
were shocked that the man that came out just put them in a garbage sack
as though they were garbage. They decided not to tell the authorities
when they discovered more of them, but moved them closure to the water
front so that there would be some dignity for the poor souls. Now the
ones that were still left on location under the building haunt it at
all hours. There has been said that a lot of the employees quit because
of the things they have heard and seen, all through the building.<br>
