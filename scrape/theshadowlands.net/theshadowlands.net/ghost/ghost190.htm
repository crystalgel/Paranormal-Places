<br><b>Bedroom Visitor</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bootsie00@netzero.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I had an experience with a nightly visitor that happened to me over
18 years ago that I am still trying to figure out if it was real or not.</b>
<br><b>I was ten years old at the time and I was living with my mom, my
little sister (Danie), and my step-dad in a little town called Lebanon,
IL. My mother used to work the afternoon shift (3pm-11pm) at a hospital
in St. Louis and I always wanted to wait up for her, even though she wouldn't
arrive until after midnight. On one of these particulat nights, my step-dad
allowed me to wait up for her.</b>
<br><b>I tried everything I knew to help me keep my eyes open. Nothing
helped. The next thing I knew, my step-dad was lifting me off the couch
and carrying me to my bedroom. On the way down the hallway, I pleaded with
him to let me stay up for her but he said that I had school in the morning
and I needed my rest. He laid me down on the bed and covered me up. He
then went over to my sister and put the cover back on her and he left the
room, closing the door behind him.</b>
<br><b>I was mad at first but I quickly settled in and drifted off to sleep.
I have always been a light sleeper. Any amount of noise and I would come
completely out of my sleep. My eyes flew open when I thought I heard&nbsp;
the front door slam. See, at this time we lived in a small two bedroom
apartment and any amount of noise was easily heard. The walls were so thin,
if you put your ear to the wall in certain areas of the apartment, you
could hear the entire conversation of the people who lived downstairs.
Well, like I said, I heard the front door close and I thought it was my
mom. I started to get out of my bed when I looked up at the door to my
bedroom and there was someone standing in the corner!!!</b>
<br><b>It took me completely off guard. I started to wonder why was someone
in my room just standing in the corner. Then I really started to look at
it.&nbsp; The room was completely dark and this thing was darker than the
darkness, a shadow within the shadows. It was very tall. It started to
just sway back and forth. The weirdest thing about it was that it had those
strange reflective eyes like a cat. You know how when you shine light in
a cat's eyes and they start to shine. That is exactly how they looked.
I was starting to get really scared.</b>
<br><b>I laid back down in my bed and just stared at it. I watched it walk
from the corner then over to my sister's bed. It had bent over and picked
something up off of her bed and walked over to the foot of my bed and stood
there for a little while then it walked back to the corner of the room
by the door.&nbsp; I was completely terrified. I was too scared to leave
the room because it was standing by the door. I didn't want it to touch
me!! So, I yelled out for my mom and my step-dad. It seemed like I was
screaming at the top of my lungs, but no one came. Then it occurred to
me that my sister didn't budge when I was yelling for our mother. It was
like she was in a very deep sleep. I felt too paralyzed with fear to even
reach over there a shake her.&nbsp; When I started calling her name, the
shadow walked over to Danie's bed and stood right beside her!! It looked
as if it was kissing her cheek!!!&nbsp; I then screamed for Danie to wake
up. She started to stir a little and then she finally came out of her sleep.</b>
<br><b>I whispered, "Danie do you see someone standing by your bed?"</b>
<br><b>She looked puzzled. She got up on her elbows and looked around the
room. "What are you talking about? I don't see anything. Stop all that
screaming and go to sleep."</b>
<br><b>"You don't see anything! There is something in this room and it
just kissed you on the cheek!"</b>
<br><b>"Shut up!"</b>
<br><b>She threw the covers over her head and refused to hear what I had
to say. I pleaded with her to listen to me. I pleaded with her to go get
mom, but she didn't want to hear it.</b>
<br><b>I then decided to talk to it. I asked it all sorts of questions,
but it never answered me. Since, it wouldn't communicate. I told it to
leave my room!! It just stood there swaying back and forth with those glowing
eyes looking at me.&nbsp; I gave up on Danie because she thought I was
crazy. So, I just laid there in my bed and stared at it until I dozed off.</b>
<br><b>As soon as I woke up the next morning, you wouldn't believe what
I saw!! Everything in my room had disappeared, even Danie!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;
When I say everything, it looked like we were robbed and someone kidnapped
my baby sister!!!&nbsp; I bolted out of my bedroom and ran down the hall
to my mom's bedroom. I tried the doorknob, but it was locked. I banged
on her door and screamed, " Someone broke in our house last night! They
took Danielle! They took all of our furniture! Mama please!"&nbsp; She
finally came to the door and calmed me down. She said, "Erika, no one can
get in here without knocking down the front door. Look at the front door,
baby, it's bolted shut from the inside."&nbsp; I was like forget that!
I took her hand and lead her to my bedroom and I couldn't believe it!!
Everything was back like it was and Danie was sitting up in her bed looking
very frightened.</b>
<br><b>At that moment, I thought I was losing my mind. I know what I saw.
Danielle proceeded to tell our mom about how I was scaring her and talking
about it was a man in our room. My mother scolded me for making up stories
but I insisted that it was true. The events of that night have bothered
me to this day.</b>
<br><b>My mother and sister still talk about that night sometimes. They
always ask me about what happened that night.&nbsp; I have never changed
my story. Something was in that room. I am sure of it.</b><b></b>

<br><b>An Unexplained Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Tfra151718@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Let me start by saying that I have never witnessed a ghost or any
other</b>
<br><b>paranormal experience for that matter. I am not claiming now to
have</b>
<br><b>witnessed a ghost but I have no reasonable explanation for what
happened and</b>
<br><b>will let you be the judge.</b>
<br><b>On December 5, 2000, I accompanied my 28yr old son to Lockport Memorial</b>
<br><b>Hospital in Lockport, NY where he was to have surgery. I was in
a basement</b>
<br><b>surgical waiting room and after about an hour I decided to go to
the main</b>
<br><b>entrance of the hospital and step out side to have a cigarette.</b>
<br><b>Upon returning, I walked down the hallway leading to the elevator
at which</b>
<br><b>time an elderly hospital volunteer dressed in the hospital pink
smock that</b>
<br><b>the volunteers wear, entered the hall from an adjacent hall also
walking</b>
<br><b>towards the elevator and was about 30 to 35 paces ahead of me. The
volunteer</b>
<br><b>entered the elevator and turned and pushed a button for the floor
that she</b>
<br><b>wanted and the elevator door began to close at which point I tried
to hurry</b>
<br><b>to get in before the door closed but arrived at the elevator when
the door</b>
<br><b>was only open by about 6". I decided to let it go and push the call
button on</b>
<br><b>the wall outside of the elevator at the same moment that the door
finished</b>
<br><b>closing against the door jam. When I pushed the button, the door
immediately</b>
<br><b>began to reopen and I was about to apologize to the volunteer for
delaying</b>
<br><b>her trip but was instead stunned to find the elevator empty. I stopped
in the</b>
<br><b>doorway to examine the elevator and looked to the rear to see if
there were</b>
<br><b>another door on the back wall as some elevators have. This was the
only door.</b>
<br><b>The woman looked as solid and normal as any one else and I did not
observe</b>
<br><b>anything strange prior to the incident. After having thought about
it for a</b>
<br><b>while, I decided to check with other volunteers who worked there,
giving them</b>
<br><b>a description of the woman and asked if they new where she worked
in the</b>
<br><b>building. No one I spoke to knew the woman and from the description
stated</b>
<br><b>that I must be mistaken about her working as a volunteer.</b>
<br><b>I have no reasonable explanation for any of this, but a woman in
a volunteer</b>
<br><b>smock did enter the elevator and then disappear.</b>

<p><b>My Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: eja@w-link.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was in high school we had a visiting presentator.&nbsp; She
read</b>
<br><b>auras.&nbsp; I've never seen an aura to this day.&nbsp; Anyway,
she told me I</b>
<br><b>could speak to the dead if I chose because my aura was so white
almost</b>
<br><b>clear.&nbsp; I asked if I could choose not to.&nbsp; Not really
taking any of this</b>
<br><b>seriously.&nbsp; I was writing my friend a note when she interupted
me with</b>
<br><b>this news.&nbsp; Years later I thought about what she said to me....</b>
<br><b>My oldest son had been born and we were living in Vancouver, WA.&nbsp;
His</b>
<br><b>dad's town.&nbsp; His father and I (without my prior consent) rented
a</b>
<br><b>duplex.&nbsp; It was the other half of the building my son's father's
brother</b>
<br><b>rented.</b>
<br><b>I didn't like Matt's (my son) room from day 1.&nbsp; It was painted
a peach</b>
<br><b>color and had two pretty good sized windows in it.&nbsp; Even with
the lights</b>
<br><b>on and the drapes open.&nbsp; That room was DARK!!!!</b>
<br><b>I was always afraid of that room.</b>
<br><b>I should tell you we lived across the street from a cemetary.&nbsp;
I'm not</b>
<br><b>really sure that has anything to do with this, though.</b>
<br><b>I never shut my son's door as I was afraid of crib death.&nbsp;
I had him</b>
<br><b>sleeping in my room until he was 6 months old.&nbsp; Awake every
hour on the</b>
<br><b>hour.&nbsp; He was now 8 almost 9 months old.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, I started noticing that I would hear voices at night in
the</b>
<br><b>living room.&nbsp; Like there was a party going on.&nbsp; I couldn't
understand</b>
<br><b>the words but just hear voices.&nbsp; Several of them.&nbsp; Nothing
disticnt. I'm</b>
<br><b>a little hard of hearing so not understanding the words didn't shock</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; That happens all the time.&nbsp; The problem was no one
but my young son</b>
<br><b>and I were there at the times.&nbsp; I would also hear footsteps
in my living</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; Just going back and forth.</b>
<br><b>Well, my son's dad went to jail for 2 weeks at one point.&nbsp;
I had my</b>
<br><b>cousin staying with me.&nbsp; She would have her boyfriend (also
a friend of</b>
<br><b>mine) stay with her.&nbsp; Being that they were young and single
and</b>
<br><b>childless they partied alot.</b>
<br><b>I have to regress about a week.&nbsp; One DAY I decided to take
a nap because</b>
<br><b>my son had FINALLY fallen asleep.&nbsp; I was in a stage between
asleep and</b>
<br><b>awake when I heard someone distictly snoring on the floor of my</b>
<br><b>bedroom.&nbsp; My son and I were, again, the only ones there.&nbsp;
I rolled over</b>
<br><b>and there was nothing there and the snoring stopped.&nbsp; I rolled
back to</b>
<br><b>my side of the bed.&nbsp; It started again.&nbsp; I rolled over
again.&nbsp; Nothing</b>
<br><b>again.&nbsp; I decided I was scaring myself as I do have a very
active</b>
<br><b>imagination.&nbsp; I heard it again.&nbsp; This time I held my breath
as I lay</b>
<br><b>there thinking maybe it was just me, but no I could still hear it
quite</b>
<br><b>clearly.&nbsp; I rolled over again and it stopped again.&nbsp; I
decided to do the</b>
<br><b>dishes.</b>
<br><b>About a week later.&nbsp; At this point I'm sleeping with all the
lights in</b>
<br><b>the house on at night.&nbsp; I had finally fallen asleep.&nbsp;
My son was</b>
<br><b>sleeping in his crib as usual.&nbsp; I don't know how long I had
been asleep</b>
<br><b>but the next thing I new my cousin and her boyfriend were both in
my bed</b>
<br><b>yelling, "Get up! Get up! Somebody's in the baby's room!"</b>
<br><b>I jumped out of bed ran to my son's door.&nbsp; It was shut!&nbsp;
I opened it</b>
<br><b>grabbed my son and came back to my room.&nbsp; I very angry with
them for</b>
<br><b>shutting the door so I immediately started yelling at them about
that.</b>
<br><b>They knew better!</b>
<br><b>I really looked at them then.&nbsp; They were both white as sheets
and their</b>
<br><b>eyes were just huge.&nbsp; They both swore his door was closed when
they got</b>
<br><b>home.&nbsp; They said they had been laying in the living room watching
T.V.</b>
<br><b>when they heard a rattling sound.&nbsp; They looked up (my son's
room was</b>
<br><b>right off the living room) and my son's door was rattling and the
handle</b>
<br><b>was shaking like someone was trying to get out but couldn't open
the</b>
<br><b>door.</b>
<br><b>I moved two weeks later.</b>
<br><b>I did ask my son's aunt, who lived in the other half of the duplex,</b>
<br><b>about the footsteps and voices.&nbsp; Of course, I asked before
any of this</b>
<br><b>other stuff happened.&nbsp; She had been there 2 years.&nbsp; She
said she heard</b>
<br><b>someone walking up and down her hallway all the time and she, herself,</b>
<br><b>had heard voices from my side of the duplex before we lived there.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>had been empty for a month.&nbsp; She thinks and ederly woman died
of old age</b>
<br><b>there when it was just one home.&nbsp; I don't know and I was NOT
going to</b>
<br><b>wait to find out.</b>
<br><b>The presence in my son's room was not nice.&nbsp; I always felt
fear!</b>
<br><b>ALWAYS!!!</b>
<br><b>I've had other experiences but nothing like this.&nbsp; I do thank
GOD.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghost story?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: RJour71691@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>About 2 years ago, my 2 year old daughter and myself moved into a
mobile home</b>
<br><b>in Willis,TX.&nbsp; My boyfriend had lived there for about a year
and half and</b>
<br><b>before that an old man (landlord's father) lived in the trailer
for 20 years.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;This mobile home was haunted.&nbsp; Before I moved in my boyfriend
saw an old man</b>
<br><b>walking down the hall a couple of times.&nbsp; Well, when I moved
in I knew right</b>
<br><b>away there was something in this place.&nbsp; The first day, while
I was still</b>
<br><b>bringing stuff to the house, moving in, a favorite ceramic cow skull
I had</b>
<br><b>got broken while moving.&nbsp; I was very dismayed about it , my
boyfriend was</b>
<br><b>outside measuring windows and called me out there to help him.&nbsp;
So I went</b>
<br><b>outside and was telling him about the broken cow skull, when I came
back in</b>
<br><b>it was fixed.&nbsp; You could still see the crack where the horn
was broken, but</b>
<br><b>it was glued together, we didn't have any super glue or anything
at that</b>
<br><b>time.&nbsp; Noone else was there.&nbsp; Then another time I was
napping on the couch,</b>
<br><b>and I distinctly heard some one say "It's me!!"&nbsp; It was in
like a loud</b>
<br><b>whisper, it woke me up and even my cat was startled, he jumped in
my lap as</b>
<br><b>soon as I heard that voice.&nbsp; Another episode was one night,
I was in the</b>
<br><b>bedroom and my boyfriend heard his name called.</b>

<p><b>GHOST/HUMAN</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Packy408@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a story that me and 50 something odd women and children witnessed
in</b>
<br><b>1987</b>
<br><b>in a battered woman's shelter in California.</b>
<br><b>The shelter was an old Spanish looking hospital built at the turn
of the</b>
<br><b>century. It was nice. Each one of the women had their own rooms
and</b>
<br><b>bathrooms, even baby beds. We had chores and even had a library
and movie</b>
<br><b>room for recreation.</b>
<br><b>Some of the women kept complaining about odd sounds at night and
horrid</b>
<br><b>nightmares. Everytime they would tell the 3 staff memebers, they'd
say since</b>
<br><b>the women are depressed from their battered situation that a lot
of what</b>
<br><b>they're experiencing is their imagination or own fears.</b>
<br><b>There was this one woman she was African -American, but looked like
she could</b>
<br><b>be a fair-skinned woman from another country. She was tall small
frames, and</b>
<br><b>very pretty. She was 21 at the time. She had a little boy around
2 years old.</b>
<br><b>She was always laughing and when we were crying about our situations
in our</b>
<br><b>group meetings she would just look at us as though it was no big
deal. A lot</b>
<br><b>of the women though this was strange. She kept the place jumping
though. She</b>
<br><b>had us laughing at ourselves instead of sulking in our miseries.
She taught</b>
<br><b>some of how to dance and always had the happy-go-lucky attitude.
She had come</b>
<br><b>from a pretty bad situation herself. She even had ovarian cancer
at the time</b>
<br><b>and we didn't even know it at the time......and still made no big
deal about</b>
<br><b>it.</b>
<br><b>There was these 3 women in the shelter that was always trying to
preach to</b>
<br><b>us. They were "sanctified" and was always trying to get everyone
to go to</b>
<br><b>their church on Sundays. They would constantly ask this African-
American</b>
<br><b>girl to go and she would say no, I can't go, one day, not right
now. They</b>
<br><b>took it as though she was a lost soul.</b>
<br><b>She would laugh at them whenever they got upset when she would tell
them that</b>
<br><b>she does not play around with religions but that she only believes
in God and</b>
<br><b>what Jesus did.</b>
<br><b>One day a Mexican woman came into the staff office and said that
when she had</b>
<br><b>went down to the lower part of the shelter (which used to be a morge,
but was</b>
<br><b>now a place to put donated clothes for the women who were leaving
the shelter</b>
<br><b>soon)...and someone literally booped her in her eye. The woman's
eye was</b>
<br><b>actually</b>
<br><b>swollen. The Mexican woman made a big deal about it. It was the
talk around</b>
<br><b>the shelter. The staff of course felt it was getting out of hand
since some</b>
<br><b>of the women were going to the staff throughout the day frightened
out of</b>
<br><b>their wits.</b>
<br><b>That did it, the staff was so tired of hearing these stories that
they called</b>
<br><b>a meeting-that there will be no more nonsense. There are not ghosts
or evil</b>
<br><b>spirits in the shelter. We were even threatened that if we said
anything else</b>
<br><b>about it we would have to leave in 24 hours. One of the staff wanted
to prove</b>
<br><b>us wrong, so we all made a single file line from the kitchen leading
to the</b>
<br><b>morge. She went down there by herself. The light was on downstairs
(it stays</b>
<br><b>on). We all huddled to watched her slowy walk down the stairs, as
she was</b>
<br><b>taking one step at a time. She said to us, "I am going to go down
here and I</b>
<br><b>am going to come back up and you will see that there is nothing
down here."</b>
<br><b>Just as she got mid way down the steps a shadow (that we all saw)
came pass</b>
<br><b>quickly. She flew up the steps in horror. Of course it was funny
to us but</b>
<br><b>not to her.</b>
<br><b>We had another meeting where the staff continued, it's all of our
energy of</b>
<br><b>depression.</b>
<br><b>The following day the most unbelievable thing took place.</b>
<br><b>The African-American woman who'se always up later than anyone, decided
to go</b>
<br><b>to sleep early, around 8:30. She put her baby down and an Ethiopian
lady</b>
<br><b>asked her why she's going to sleep so early. She said that she was
sleepy.</b>
<br><b>Everyone was up watching tv or a movie, eating, talking, laughing,
reading</b>
<br><b>books in the library. etc.</b>
<br><b>All of a sudden there was this terrifying scream coming from the
library. The</b>
<br><b>satff on duty that night went in to see what was going on. There
were 3 women</b>
<br><b>in the libray casually talking amongst themselves when an evil form</b>
<br><b>materialized and began to physically come after them. The woman
(staff) would</b>
<br><b>not speak of what she saw alone after the 3 women ran out of there.
As a</b>
<br><b>matter or fact She left the next moring and said that she'll never
speak of</b>
<br><b>what she'd saw.</b>
<br><b>Simutaneously, There were multiple sounds footsteps on the roof
of the</b>
<br><b>shelter. The children of the women were being tied up in their sheets
by some</b>
<br><b>invisible forces. Some of the women were being puched and thrown
across the</b>
<br><b>rooms. A white man looked about 30, and shabby around 170 pounds-
on a</b>
<br><b>ten-speed bike came to the front door and said he had some donations
which</b>
<br><b>was odd since men aren't suppose to know about the battered woman
shelter.</b>
<br><b>They said that his eyes were not that of a human. The staff assured
him that</b>
<br><b>they are not a shelter and that they don't take donations. The man
would not</b>
<br><b>leave but stood there.&nbsp; The whole scene was so frighteneing
that the police</b>
<br><b>was called. When they arrived, literally could not open the door.
They tried</b>
<br><b>to bust through windows, kick down the doors, but still nothing.</b>
<br><b>One of the staff went and checked all the womens' rooms to try and
gather</b>
<br><b>them in the midst of the hall in front of the office.</b>
<br><b>The African American woman was sleeping peacefully. She was the
only one not</b>
<br><b>affected. The staff member thought this was strange when we later
asked, but</b>
<br><b>said that she was glad that someone was not being harmed.</b>
<br><b>Doors were swinging open all over the shelter and this one huge
door that is</b>
<br><b>like a vault swung open and all sorts of dark silluetes, began to
come out in</b>
<br><b>mases and glide towards the rooms&nbsp; and througouht the shelter.</b>
<br><b>The women and children and staff were trying to get near the staff's
office</b>
<br><b>at the same time. ....while the police still not able to get in
the shelter</b>
<br><b>because of some force that would not allow them in. All the police
could hear</b>
<br><b>was screaming and crying from the outside.</b>
<br><b>All of a sudden The African American girl comes down the hall, all
white like</b>
<br><b>a spirit. She has on her usual-type clothes, long skirt with a long
sleeve</b>
<br><b>body suit, but her hair was down to her behind. (Her hair is usually
a little</b>
<br><b>past her shoulder). As she walks all the spirits are now screaming
and</b>
<br><b>literally leaving the shelter. They were making thumping sounds
against the</b>
<br><b>walls as they tried to exit through walls and windows to get to
the outside</b>
<br><b>of the shelter . She calmly walked passed us and to each room in
the shelter.</b>
<br><b>Everytime she came to a room she would motion her head around the
corner and</b>
<br><b>the dark spirits would scream and run towards the windows and out
to the</b>
<br><b>street. She went to every room except the one that she was sleeping
in. All</b>
<br><b>the evil activity stopped. One of the staff who had been at the
door all</b>
<br><b>along finally was able to open to door for the police to come in.
By this</b>
<br><b>time she walked back down the hall to her room.</b>
<br><b>In the moring, would you believe she did not know what we were talking
about.</b>
<br><b>One of the children, a little boy was crying when he saw her and
said that</b>
<br><b>she was in his room when all the monsters came out. She told the
little boy</b>
<br><b>that she wasn't in his room. He insisted. The little boy's mother
was present</b>
<br><b>and told her that she had stopped some evil activity. the little
boy's mother</b>
<br><b>and the staff had told her what happened the night before.The staff
assured</b>
<br><b>her that it was alright because one of them checked on her during
this</b>
<br><b>activity and that she was sound asleep. She said that she was asleep
and that</b>
<br><b>She did not hear a thing....but we all assured her that it was ok.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>looked at us at though were were off our rocker.</b>
<br><b>One of the sanctified lady's told here that she was a small remnamt
of angels</b>
<br><b>that were part angel and part human. She said that she will give
her life to</b>
<br><b>Jesus Christ soon. and not to be afraid of herself. She also gave
her a King</b>
<br><b>James Bible.</b>
<br><b>1 year later. I saw her and asked her wha she was doing know she
said She</b>
<br><b>gave her life to Jesus and that she was instantly healed from cancer.</b>
<br><b>Later I saw pictiures of people who said that she would appear in
thier rooms</b>
<br><b>whenever there was a ghost or evil presence, One was of a guy who
just got</b>
<br><b>out of prison, one was of a lady with 2 children. She said that
some more</b>
<br><b>people would say that she stands in their rooms at night and guards
them. I</b>
<br><b>asked her Isn't this frightening to you? She said she asks them
isn't that</b>
<br><b>frightening to them and they say not at all like it's no big deal.
At first I</b>
<br><b>was a little leery about strangers telling me that I stand and guard
their</b>
<br><b>homes, but what the women saw in the shelter that night sounds about
the same</b>
<br><b>as what they're saying. I can't change what they insist that they
saw.</b>
<br><b>They're not afraid of me. They say that they pray to God in the
name of Jesus</b>
<br><b>so I'm not afraidat all." Then she told me to look at a scripture
in Hebrew</b>
<br><b>11:1, Be not forgetful to entertain angels for some have entertained
angels</b>
<br><b>unawares."</b>
<br><b>Now before you not believe me. I personally know this woman and
have more</b>
<br><b>friends that will prove to you this is all true. And as God is my
witness,</b>
<br><b>she was in an accidental gasoline fire, she was buring a large bundle
of</b>
<br><b>paper. For some odd rerason the paper wouldn't burn. She decided
to drip a</b>
<br><b>tad bit of gasoline from a 1 gallon can. Some fire caught hold of
the can,</b>
<br><b>the can exploded, fire was everywhere, all over her and she just
stood, put</b>
<br><b>the can down, looked at her hands, ran her fingers through her hair,
casually</b>
<br><b>looked around in the flames, and stepped right out the fire, and
an outline</b>
<br><b>of her body was in the fire from where she was standing in the fire.
She went</b>
<br><b>to the house to get a water bucket to put the fire out. then went

<br><b>it again.</b>
<br><b>Her step father saw this. Who is alive today. It freaked him out

<p><b>Something Happened To Me</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: [canadagirljackie@yahoo.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>I honestly never, ever in my life ever thought I would</b>
<br><b>be writing to you. My name is Jackie Giles and I am 19</b>
<br><b>years old. I live in Saskatchewan Canada. I found out</b>
<br><b>about your website on the radio. I was listening on</b>
<br><b>halloween and they said that the coolest website to go</b>
<br><b>to on halloween was yours. I started reading the</b>
<br><b>stories in my spare time. Right now I am about half</b>
<br><b>way done the second page. I havn't been reading much</b>
<br><b>for about 2 weeks. Well anyway here goes my story and</b>
<br><b>I speak NOTHING but the TRUTH.</b>
<br><b>(sorry but it is gonna be long)</b>
<br><b>Last night I was hanging out with my friend at her</b>
<br><b>house and my boyfriend called and said my Grandma was</b>
<br><b>feeling very sick and that my Dad and Mom wanted me to</b>
<br><b>spend the night there incase anything happened. So I</b>
<br><b>called my Grandma and she told me that she was going</b>
<br><b>to bed and that I didn't need to rush over. She said</b>
<br><b>she would leave the door unlocked and that I could</b>
<br><b>come in at anytime. I got to her place about 12am and</b>
<br><b>I stayed up until 1:30am. Then I went to bed in the</b>
<br><b>room across the hall from her. It helped me that I</b>
<br><b>could hear her breathing cause then I knew she was</b>
<br><b>okay. I woke up in the morning and my arm was numb</b>
<br><b>because I had been lying on it. I woke up and stared</b>
<br><b>to shake it out. I opened my eyes and looked up. The</b>
<br><b>blind was almost shut but I could see out the last two</b>
<br><b>inches that it was getting bright out. Then I got a</b>
<br><b>weird feeling because I couln't hear my grandma at</b>
<br><b>all. I also couldn't hear her up. I was just thinking</b>
<br><b>I should roll over and look towards the door and the</b>
<br><b>clock and see what time it was and get up and check on</b>
<br><b>her. Just as I was about to roll over. (by this time I</b>
<br><b>was VERY awake!!). AND A CAT JUMPED UP ON THE BED!!! I</b>
<br><b>did not see it. I was facing the window with the</b>
<br><b>blankets over my head. It jumped up just behind my</b>
<br><b>knees. My grandma does not have a cat. I knew right</b>
<br><b>away that it was Slippers. Or as my grandma likes to</b>
<br><b>say 'Good Ol' Slips'. Slippers died about 15 years</b>
<br><b>ago!!!. Well anyway, she jumped up on the bed and</b>
<br><b>walked up to my shoulder and layed down on my upper</b>
<br><b>arm. I TOTALLY felt that. I was thinking "NO WAY! This</b>
<br><b>is NOT happening to me! I remembered from some of the</b>
<br><b>stories that there is often a cold spot where the</b>
<br><b>ghost is. I wanted to reach out and see if it was</b>
<br><b>cold. At this time I was not scarred. I thought I was</b>
<br><b>cool cause she was a good cat. So I tried to reach out</b>
<br><b>to touch my shoulder and I COULD NOT MOVE!! I was</b>
<br><b>totally paralized! I couldn't open my eyes or even</b>
<br><b>wiggle my fingers. Then there was a VERY loud sort of</b>
<br><b>rushing noise in my ears. It was like a cross between</b>
<br><b>a blank t.v. station and the furnace times 100. I was</b>
<br><b>not paralized with fear because up until now I wasn't</b>
<br><b>scarred. Then when I couldn't move I felt totally</b>
<br><b>terrified. I thought maybe somthing had happend to my</b>
<br><b>grandma in the night and this was a way of saying</b>
<br><b>goodbye or somthing. Then I totally forgot about the</b>
<br><b>cat and I thought that I REALLY wanted to get up and</b>
<br><b>check my grandma. But the cat and the noise were still</b>
<br><b>there and I still couldn't move. When I couldn't move</b>
<br><b>I was thinking about you website and I totally</b>
<br><b>understood how terrified people can be when this</b>
<br><b>happens. I was trying to think if there could be a</b>
<br><b>rational explaination for why I couldn't move. I know</b>
<br><b>that I was not so scarred that I couldn't move. I just</b>
<br><b>couldn't move. Then noise went away and the cat was</b>
<br><b>suddenly gone and I could move again. I quickly</b>
<br><b>currled up in a ball and layed there for a few minuts</b>
<br><b>until I was sure that what ever it was was gone. I did</b>
<br><b>NOT want to see a shadowy figure in the room. Then I</b>
<br><b>quickly flew out of bed and into the hall. By this</b>
<br><b>time I heard a radio on so I knew my Grandma was up. I</b>
<br><b>was standing in the hall and I realized I had no pants</b>
<br><b>on. So I turned around a quickly flipped on the light.</b>
<br><b>I put my pants on and ran into the kitchen. I sure</b>
<br><b>scared my grandma because it was 8:00am and I didn't</b>
<br><b>have to work until 11. As soon as I got into the</b>
<br><b>kitchen the phone rang. My grandma could tell somthing</b>
<br><b>was bothering me so she rushed my aunt off the phone.</b>
<br><b>I told her everything and she totally believed me.</b>
<br><b>Then she started to tease me a bit and say</b>
<br><b>"kittygonnagetyou" over and over. But she told me that</b>
<br><b>she has never seen or felt Slippers but she has heard</b>
<br><b>my dog Finnigan scratching at the door and</b>
<br><b>breathing.(he has been dead for about a year.)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;At 9:30am I drove my Grandma to my aunts house. I</b>
<br><b>went in and my aunt said that it looked like I was</b>
<br><b>sick too. I told her that Slippers had come to visit</b>
<br><b>me and she thought that was SO cool. She told me about</b>
<br><b>all the stories of how her cats that died come to</b>
<br><b>visit her. She told me that she feels cats come up the</b>
<br><b>bed and purrr in her ear and there is no one there.</b>
<br><b>And she also told me that she was down stairs and she</b>
<br><b>looked at the steps and saw one of her dead cats</b>
<br><b>sitting there and another one of her dead cats run up</b>
<br><b>past it. She told me that she had a cat that would</b>
<br><b>drag stuff around the house and leave it in weird</b>
<br><b>places. After it died she started finding stuff in</b>
<br><b>weird places like mitts on the steps and shoes in the</b>
<br><b>living room. Just like the cat did when it was alive.</b>
<br><b>Then she asked my Grandma to remember about how for a</b>
<br><b>long time after their dog Sandy died they could hear</b>
<br><b>his nails tapping up and down the hall floor. Once</b>
<br><b>they BOTH heard it at the same time.</b>
<br><b>My aunt felt bad for me that my experince was so</b>
<br><b>spooky. She said she has never not been able to move.</b>
<br><b>She said that poor Ol' Slips must have felt really bad</b>
<br><b>that she scarred me. She also said that I must have</b>
<br><b>scarred the CAT!. And that it was too bad that we</b>
<br><b>couldn't have comforted each other like she does with</b>
<br><b>her cats.</b>
<br><b>I went to work and told my friends. They ALL believed</b>
<br><b>me. Two of them started telling me super weird stuff</b>
<br><b>that happend to them. One girl never told anyone in</b>
<br><b>her life what happens to her because she was scarred</b>
<br><b>no one would belive her. She decided to tell me</b>
<br><b>because it was obvious I would understand. I will have</b>
<br><b>to get them to write to you. On girl even has a book</b>
<br><b>about everthing that happend to her.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Thanks so much for reading this. I know you will</b>
<br><b>understand. Writing to you was the first thing I</b>
<br><b>thougt of when it happend. Maybe reading your stories</b>
<br><b>hightend my sense of awareness of somthing. IT DID NOT</b>
<br><b>HIGHTEN MY IMAGINATION. Thanks again.</b>

<p><b>Haunting or Overactive Imagination</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: a_carlpathory@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in London Ontario Canada, I moved into a complex near the
beginning</b>
<br><b>of September with a very very tiny history all together.&nbsp; The
complex itself</b>
<br><b>is fairly new and as far as I have been able to find out, only has
had one</b>
<br><b>death; and the house it happened in has no report of any mysterious</b>
<br><b>incidents.</b>
<br><b>With my stay at unit #40, I have experienced a couple of things
that seem</b>
<br><b>quite odd, and I am not alone-my mom has experienced a few things
as well.</b>
<br><b>All that has happened has seemed to be directed toward the entire
family,</b>
<br><b>where in contrast to your story, the spirits seemed to be focused
on you.</b>
<br><b>The things that have happened have not been harmful or even seemingly
of</b>
<br><b>evil intentions-if there is a spirit at all it seems to only want
to be</b>
<br><b>recognized as being there.</b>
<br><b>I picked up the feeling of something being "out of place" first
I think.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>all started with the basement door.&nbsp; Someone would close it
tightly and go</b>
<br><b>upstairs or to another part of the house, but whenever someone would
return</b>
<br><b>to the door it would be open only an inch and a half-everytime.
At the top</b>
<br><b>of the stairs (on the upper floor of the house) there is sort of
a wall that</b>
<br><b>is only about four feet in height, whenever standing there I would
get the</b>
<br><b>odd feeling as if I was standing in someone else's place. Sometimes
to the</b>
<br><b>point of feeling naucious or over whelmed with an intense throbbing
in my</b>
<br><b>muscles-lots of headaches.</b>
<br><b>When informing my mom that I felt someone or something was also
with us she</b>
<br><b>sort of shrugged it off, but it wasnt untill she told me that the
reason for</b>
<br><b>the door opening was that people weren't closing it tightly-that
the door</b>
<br><b>openings stopped completely.</b>
<br><b>After that things that weren't so easily put off started happening.&nbsp;
One</b>
<br><b>night I went downstairs to do the laundry.&nbsp; By our washer and
dryer we have</b>
<br><b>2 sinks. One (the closest to the washer) is always filthy-the one
next to it</b>
<br><b>is spotless, and out of habit I took a glance into the sinks, to
make sure</b>
<br><b>nothing was there-and of course nothing was.&nbsp; Well before I
could finish</b>
<br><b>putting the laundry on my dad came to the door. (My mom and dad
are not</b>
<br><b>divorced just seperated)He stayed for no longer than 30 mins seeing
as the</b>
<br><b>only other member of the family besides my mother and I, my brother
(10</b>
<br><b>years old, 11 in March) was not there.&nbsp; When he left I went
back down to</b>
<br><b>finish the laundry, taking another glance in the sink, I saw-which
quite</b>
<br><b>frankly terrified me, a tiny footprint pressed into the dirt...Seeing
as no</b>
<br><b>one besides me had been in the basement in the brief 30 mins I was
away I</b>
<br><b>got quiet scared.&nbsp; Trying to think of all things logic.&nbsp;
I kept coming to</b>
<br><b>the question "why?" It was most definetly a footprint, slightly
smaller than</b>
<br><b>my brothers (the footprint is still in the sink, we are keeping
it untill we</b>
<br><b>can take a photograph of it) and even if a little kid did it and
I just</b>
<br><b>didnt notice it before with the bad lighting and all, why the sink?&nbsp;
There</b>
<br><b>are no windows in the basement and the only to get to the basement
is</b>
<br><b>through the house, and with 2 150 lbs Rotties not too many little
kids are</b>
<br><b>happy about going through our house.&nbsp; Another thing that bothered
me was</b>
<br><b>that it was only one foot.&nbsp; If a little kid did it how did
it get into the</b>
<br><b>sink in the first place? the edge of the sink comes up to my little</b>
<br><b>brother's neck.</b>
<br><b>Another happening was one my mom experienced.&nbsp; She was upstairs
sleeping and</b>
<br><b>I was sleeping on the futon in the livingroom.&nbsp; The next morning
my mom came</b>
<br><b>downstairs and complained about not being able to sleep last night
due to</b>
<br><b>the fire alarm repeatedly going off.&nbsp; She said it happened
twice, the first</b>
<br><b>time she stayed in bed the second she went downstairs to investigate
and</b>
<br><b>noticed nothing.</b>
<br><b>The latest happening was involving my mother as well.&nbsp; I was
down in the</b>
<br><b>livingroom once again and she was upstairs half asleep.&nbsp; She
informed me the</b>
<br><b>following day that the night had been stressful to her due to hearing
what</b>
<br><b>she thought was me going up and down the stairs all night.&nbsp;
She told me that</b>
<br><b>she was about to call out to me seeing if I was coming to bed when
she heard</b>
<br><b>"me" stop outside her door (which was only opened slightly) and
act as if I</b>
<br><b>was "trying to hear" what was going on in the bedroom.</b>
<br><b>I sleep in the livingroom because I cannot fall asleep in my mother's
room</b>
<br><b>(I dont sleep in my room because the cats have taken it over hehe).</b>
<br><b>Whenever Im in my mom's room I hear scratching on the wall, well
more like</b>
<br><b>fingernail tapping and creaking, it's so bad and so realistic I
fear turning</b>
<br><b>my head towards the sound, thinking I will see someone standing
there.</b>
<br><b>With all that has happened and all the pets I own (2 dogs, 2 cats,
1 rat, 1</b>
<br><b>parrot, and fish) the only one that has responded to anything was
my one cat</b>
<br><b>Spooky, who is black and about 6 or so years old.&nbsp; Whenever
Spooky is out</b>
<br><b>and about the livingroom area, she becomes quite ajetated, her motions
are</b>
<br><b>as if there is a fly or bug pestering her, the way her back jumps
and hair</b>
<br><b>stands only on the certain parts of her body.&nbsp; She growls and
hisses then</b>
<br><b>jumps away from the area, then she seems to act fine.</b>
<br><b>Im not sure if there is more to what is happening that I am not
seeing or if</b>
<br><b>Im seeing too much into everyday things...but whenever I put off
our</b>
<br><b>"experiences" my mind drifts back to the footpoint in the sink.</b>
<br><b>My mom and I get the feeling that the spirit (if one) is one of
a young</b>
<br><b>girl, about the age of 12 or 13.</b>
<br><b>When asking someone that has had a few ghost experiences of her
own (an</b>
<br><b>older woman) she says nobody has had anything happen to them in
#40, but one</b>
<br><b>time one of the previous owners took a picture of a porcelin doll
on a couch</b>
<br><b>and in the photo the doll was glowing, like brighter than the flash
itself,</b>
<br><b>to the point that the doll was just a blur, but the woman said that
the</b>
<br><b>people were just weird themselves and not to worry about anything.</b>
<br><b>Please email me back with your opinion on if we should ignore the
happenings</b>
<br><b>as house shiftings and bad batteries and such or if we should try
to learn</b>
<br><b>more about our adopted phantom friend</b>

<p><b>My Cousin Brian</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: HugsNkisseSxO36@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My cousin Brian and I were extremely close for as long as I could
remember.</b>
<br><b>He was about 12 years older than I am. He would go camping with
my family a</b>
<br><b>couple times a year, and play santa for me during xmas. I have alot
of great</b>
<br><b>memories with him. In October of 92 Brian died of a drug over dose.
My family</b>
<br><b>suspected that he had been using drugs because he wasn't as involed
with</b>
<br><b>family like he had been..stopped going camping and spending xmas
with us so</b>
<br><b>he could play santa. He was very into boxing and was pretty popular
among</b>
<br><b>people in Scranton Pa. When he died I took it the worst. I was in
5th grade</b>
<br><b>and had to get counseling from officials at school because I cried
all day</b>
<br><b>and I even mentioned to people that I wanted to be with him , so
my family</b>
<br><b>thought I was thinking about suicide. At Brians funeral I never
went up to</b>
<br><b>his coffin. I couldn't face the fact that he was laying in there
dead. He</b>
<br><b>love pulling pranks and I remember throughout the whole wake wishing
he would</b>
<br><b>jump up and say it was all a joke. For a while I felt guilty of
his death</b>
<br><b>because I thought that if I knew about him using drugs I would be
able to</b>
<br><b>talk to him and he would have ended his addiction because of me.
After</b>
<br><b>suspecting his drug use for a while my family found out it was true
but they</b>
<br><b>kept it from me because I looked to him as my role model and they
didnt want</b>
<br><b>me to hate him. My cousin Chip, Brians older brother&nbsp; got married
in 97 and I</b>
<br><b>was a brides maid. In the church there was one section of the pews
that was</b>
<br><b>blocked off so the photographer had easy access for taking pictures.
In the</b>
<br><b>middle of the ceremony I saw Brian sit down in the section that
was blocked</b>
<br><b>off for the photographer. I couldnt believe I was seeing him because
well he</b>
<br><b>was dead and had been for a while now. I kept looking at my mother
to see if</b>
<br><b>she noticed him but it was obvious that she didnt from the looks
of concern</b>
<br><b>on her face towards me. All I did was look at Brian and look at
my mom and</b>
<br><b>tears would stream down my face. My mom kept mouthing to me "whats
wrong?".</b>
<br><b>Brian stayed for most of the ceremony and when it was almost over
he looked</b>
<br><b>at me smiled and left. After ceremony was over and the bridal party
had</b>
<br><b>exited the church, I ran out of the church hysterical crying, but
I did so</b>
<br><b>that no one noticed. I'm sure people assumed I was crying because
of the</b>
<br><b>joyus occasion, not because i saw a ghost. My mom&nbsp; met me outside
and asked</b>
<br><b>me what was wrong. I told her Brian was there and she didnt believe
me. She</b>
<br><b>asked me what he was wearing thinking if I was lying, I couldnt
come up with</b>
<br><b>just anything. I told her what he wore from head to toe. She didnt
belive me</b>
<br><b>until she realized the suit I described to her was what he wore
in his coffin</b>
<br><b>the day he was burried.&nbsp; I belive totaly that he was there
and he only let me</b>
<br><b>see him because he knew I wasnt over his death and he wanted me
to be ok. It</b>
<br><b>was his way of showing me that he was ok and I didnt have to worry
about him,</b>
<br><b>and to show me that he still thought about our family and that no
matter what</b>
<br><b>he would be there for all of us on our special days. I always had
a hard time</b>
<br><b>talking about him so if he was brought up on holidays or when my
family was</b>
<br><b>together, I had to leave the room if I didnt want to burst into
tears. I've</b>
<br><b>had alot of closure since seeing him. I am now able to talk to people
about</b>
<br><b>him, and even go to his grave site with out breaking down. Now that
I am in</b>
<br><b>college I chose a profession where I am able to work with&nbsp;
people with</b>
<br><b>addictions and that need counseling, hoping that I could save other
people</b>
<br><b>from experiencing the pain I went though.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Paranormal Bound</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: twaltz@comwares.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'd like to tell you about my life with ghost. See ever since I was
5 I have live with ghosts. Every house that me and my family moved in to
there was a ghost. So I plan for my future to be a ghost hunter. And that
is exactlly what I am going to be. See when i first moved into my house
when i was 5 there was a ghost dressed all in black and was colored. He
had looked as if he just got married or something. The second ghost or
should I say ghosts unstead of&nbsp; second were babies crying. I mean
TONS! Then the next one was a little girl that when it was night she would
come out and say,"Mommy, mommy, mommy! Where are you?" I would hear snow
crunching when we were inside and I would tell my mom and so she would
check outside and nothing would be there. So I would check outside and
once I looked out there and start screaming. Because there would be outside
the ghost of an old man covered ALL IN BLOOD!!</b><b></b>

<p><b>An online friend of mine sent me your site when I told her about
the</b>
<br><b>experiences in the home I now live.&nbsp; I find it so interesting,
the work you</b>
<br><b>are doing.&nbsp; I am always afraid that people will think I am
CRAZY!</b>
<br><b>I am 47 years old and live in a home that was built in 1955.&nbsp;
So many</b>
<br><b>unusual</b>
<br><b>things happen in the house, whistling in one bedroom, a strong smell
of the</b>
<br><b>perfume, White Shoulder in my guest bedroom.&nbsp; And the constant,
Thinking</b>
<br><b>someone is coming down the hall sound, day and night.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The whistling is</b>
<br><b>always in the early morning.</b>
<br><b>The most eerie unusual experience I had was I was playing the piano,
the</b>
<br><b>hymn, Amazing Grace. It was as if, someone had opened the back door,
and was</b>
<br><b>standing in my living room beside me.&nbsp; Even the dog refused
to go to the</b>
<br><b>back</b>
<br><b>hall and in the room.&nbsp; Something she had never done before.</b>
<br><b>Late I told the daughter in law about the experience, she said that
was the</b>

lot, she said,</b>
<br><b>every morning.</b>
<br><b>The house was lived in by he, his first, wife, his second wife and
his</b>
<br><b>sister.&nbsp; He died in the master bedroom, the first wife died
in the middle</b>
<br><b>bedroom and the sister in law died in my now computer room. Her
scent, Of</b>

<br><b>Ghost or Not A Ghost? That is the question.</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi.&nbsp; I have long avoided writing to someone about this</b>
<br><b>experience.&nbsp; Reason being is I'm a skeptic, and don't</b>
<br><b>want to rush to judgment.&nbsp; To this very day, we have</b>
<br><b>NO idea what caused the ruckus.&nbsp; So anything is</b>
<br><b>possible I guess.</b>
<br><b>The experience actually happened to my mother, not me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I'll try to recall it to the best of my memory from</b>
<br><b>what she told me.&nbsp; This happened over a year ago.&nbsp; May</b>
<br><b>of 1999.&nbsp; We had moved into a brand new house (no one</b>
<br><b>else ever lived in it, and it was a newly developed</b>
<br><b>area) a month before.&nbsp; One morning, I got up as the</b>
<br><b>norm, getting ready for work, and waiting for my mom</b>
<br><b>to finish.&nbsp; All of the sudden, very unlike her, she</b>
<br><b>poked her head out real quick and asked if anything</b>
<br><b>fell/broke in my room.&nbsp; I told her that everything</b>
<br><b>seemed fine..nothing out of the ordinary.&nbsp; Then all of</b>
<br><b>the sudden she blurts out, "Then we must have a ghost</b>
<br><b>then!".&nbsp; I must've gotten pale!&nbsp; lol..reason being is</b>
<br><b>since moving into our home, I've gotten back into</b>
<br><b>looking up info on the supernatural.&nbsp; That's how I</b>
<br><b>even came across the Shadowlands site.&nbsp; In fact, the</b>
<br><b>night of the incident, I had been reading stories,</b>
<br><b>looking at photos, etc..&nbsp; It felt like a real weird</b>
<br><b>coincidence.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, I asked her what had happened.&nbsp; Apparently,</b>
<br><b>the night before, she had her back to her doorway,</b>
<br><b>reading a book in bed, trying to fall asleep (I was</b>
<br><b>already fast asleep in my room with the door closed).</b>
<br><b>When all of the sudden she heard a massive crash!&nbsp; I'm</b>
<br><b>an extremely sound sleeper, so I never heard it.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>jumped out of bed thinking her cat had knocked down a</b>
<br><b>plant or something (he was constantly getting into</b>
<br><b>things).&nbsp; When she came out, she looked all over and</b>
<br><b>couldn't find anything wrong!&nbsp; Since the weather was</b>
<br><b>nice, I knew she had her window open, and asked if</b>
<br><b>maybe it came from outside.&nbsp; She said she had thought</b>
<br><b>of that, but the noise came distinctly from inside the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; She said it didn't sound like it came from the</b>
<br><b>way of the window.&nbsp; We also didn't have anything</b>
<br><b>outside that would've cause the noise.&nbsp; Our garage is</b>
<br><b>FULL of all sorts of stuff she brought back after her</b>
<br><b>father passed on (grandma was gone a year before him).</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I thought maybe something crashed in there...which to</b>
<br><b>be honest would surprise me.&nbsp; We had stuff packed in</b>
<br><b>there well.&nbsp; She said maybe so (though she was still</b>
<br><b>doubtful on it), but still..the noise was EXTREMELY</b>
<br><b>loud..and she remembers that to this day.</b>
<br><b>Since then, we've been in the garage milling around,</b>
<br><b>and never have we come across anything down or</b>
<br><b>destroyed.&nbsp; We never have figured out the source of</b>
<br><b>the noise, and we never had any other experiences</b>
<br><b>happen since.&nbsp; I'm still very skeptical as to what</b>
<br><b>happened.&nbsp; I've heard of stories of ghosts "passing</b>
<br><b>through".&nbsp; I don't know if that's what it was or not,</b>
<br><b>but it remains a mystery for us.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for listening!</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Supernatural Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rr296992@hvcc.edu</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was 11 years old and my sister was 4 we went out for a walk
where</b>
<br><b>we live. We live in the country and have a lot of woods surrounding
our</b>
<br><b>area. We also live on a dead end road. Well we were walking up the
road</b>
<br><b>to the dead end when my sister started to act silly like little
kids do</b>
<br><b>and I got really annoyed at her. So I told her to go home.Well she
was</b>
<br><b>too afraid to walk home alone.&nbsp; I told her that she was a little
cry</b>
<br><b>baby(as older kids say to younger ones) and that she better get
home. At</b>
<br><b>that point she started to cry and and said that she'd tell mom.
At that</b>
<br><b>point we turned around and started to walk home. I looked up and
saw my</b>
<br><b>mom coming toward us looking really mad. I thought that she must've</b>
<br><b>heard my sister crying but that seemed unlikly because we were to
far</b>
<br><b>from the house for her to hear. My sister saw her also and said
to me</b>
<br><b>that now i'm going to get in trouble with mom. So i took her hand
and</b>
<br><b>started to walk toward my mom. We both had seen her and commited
on it</b>
<br><b>to each other. But as we started walking toward our mother she</b>
<br><b>disappeared. It was really strange. So we walked the reast of the
way to</b>
<br><b>our house and there was mom washing the dishes. I asked her if she
had</b>
<br><b>gone outside and started to walk to us but she said that she was
inside</b>
<br><b>the whole tome washing the dishes. I told her what we saw and she
said</b>
<br><b>that it most of been one of the neighbors. But the figure looked
just</b>
<br><b>like our mother. The same build, hair, way of walking. Plus the
figure</b>
<br><b>had on a sweater that is quite unique that my mom use to wear a
lot back</b>
<br><b>then. I also told this to my mom but she just said that I was seeing</b>
<br><b>things. That I just looked up to fast and thought that I saw her.
But</b>
<br><b>that would not explain my sister seeing "her" and my sister saying
"</b>
<br><b>here comes mom, you're in trouble now."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;It was a really strange experiance.My family has a lot of
beliefs and</b>
<br><b>we don't believe in jokes persay but in demons that can disguise</b>
<br><b>themselves as those who are either alive or dead. That is the only</b>
<br><b>explanantion that I can come up with for this experiance. If anyone
has</b>
<br><b>had a similiar experiance or has a suggestion please e-mail me.</b>

<p><b>&nbsp; My Ghost Tale</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: brigadoon1@prodigy.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Stephanie. About 4 years ago me and my husband had rented
our first house. Well, the first incident was when we had some friends
come look at the house before we started moving in. It was night and there
was no lights on yet, and we were joking about how it looked haunted at
night. When we were leaving, my friends truck wouldn't start!! This was
a new truck and after about 30 minutes, it started and we all left without
thinking much about it. A few weeks after we had moved in and were settled,
some friends were over late and night and woke me up at about 3 am. They
were in our kitchen area and were throwing food around. When I went into
the kitchen for a rag, the oven door was off and lying against the cabinets.
They all denied removing the oven door and I think they were too drunk
to do anything like that.&nbsp; Other times, our 2 dogs would sit at the
entrance to the hallway that led to the bedrooms (4 bedroom house) and
would not enter no matter what I did or said.&nbsp; Zeus, our boxer was
the worst. He would whine and flatten his ears against his head, then growl
like there was someone in the hallway. Needless to say when I looked, there
was nothing there. Now my husband is a loud snorer, and occasionally I
would have to sleep in our guestroom to get some quiet. One night I woke
up in the dark and I distinctly heard the sound of fingers running up and
down the miniblinds (they were the thin metal kind). When I turned on the
light, nothing was there.&nbsp; And I always had vivid, sometimes horrible
nightmares when I slept in that room.&nbsp; When our friend moved in with
us, he took that room and often complained of nightmares. One day he told
me that he saw a person standing in his doorway, and he was alone in the
house at the time. But when he checked the house, nothing was wrong.&nbsp;
The room we turned into another guestroom had a couch that I would sleep
on when the snoring husband forced me out of our bed. Well, up until now
I had accepted the ghost because it never did any harm, just making itself
known. I would actually acknowledge it and greet it. I had the impression
it was a young girl and that the original guestroom was her room.&nbsp;
Well, one night I was in the other room on the couch. Lying on my stomach,
I was almost asleep when suddenly I couldn't breath and I felt something
pressing my shoulders to the couch to where I couldn't move. The whole
rooms atmosphere changed and I had an overwhelming feeling of dread and
evil. I am not a religious person in the least but that presence was evil.
I can't explain it any other way. I felt myself struggling and I couldn't
help but call out, "PLEASE LET ME GO." sounds corny I know but at the time,
well, what else could I say? The pressure on my shoulders lessened and
I bolted out of that room and huddled in the dark next to my husband until
the sun came up. He thinks to this day that it was a nightmare but I was
awake..I know I was.&nbsp; Ever since that night, if I came anywhere near
that room, I got a chill and started to shake.&nbsp; No one else in the
house felt anything like that, but they had seen a few things that I think
was the young girl ghost.&nbsp; She seemed benevolent and made more appearances
in that house.&nbsp; For some reason I always felt safer when I had my
dogs with me, being that they can sense things on a different level than
people can.&nbsp; Thank you for letting me share my story and if you post
it on your site, I thank you.</b><b></b>

<p><b>I grew up on an old farm in NH, with 60 or 70 acres of property,

the "little hill" where we planted bulbs and other flowering plants.&nbsp;
Sally was her name, and I believe that she visited often.. My uncle napped
in the late afternoon one time, and was terrified to find a young woman
looking down on him.&nbsp; I found, after discovering that there was no
Santa for real, that&nbsp; someone had enjoyed my piano playing.&nbsp;

<br><b>We all felt an affinity with Sally, and our kitchen was always warm,

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Camp Zama</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: slymmer69@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I wrote ya yesterday, well I suppose that I should start out with
my</b>
<br><b>first experience.&nbsp; It was when I was around 5 years old.&nbsp;
I was out side</b>
<br><b>under the car port of the house we lived in and a group of friends
were</b>
<br><b>talking when not one of&nbsp; us but all of&nbsp; us saw a lady
looking at us from</b>
<br><b>the attic opening&nbsp; needless to say the kids that&nbsp; were
with me scattered</b>
<br><b>into the four winds and&nbsp; when I told my parents about it my
Dad quickly</b>
<br><b>dismissed&nbsp; the whole thing, but he did not hesitate to close
the</b>
<br><b>opening.&nbsp; I never saw anything there at that house again.&nbsp;
A couple of</b>
<br><b>years later, I over heard&nbsp; my parents talking to some friends
about the</b>
<br><b>old haunted property we used to live at in Arizona though and I
knew</b>
<br><b>what he was talking about.&nbsp; He related to his friends of the
crying</b>
<br><b>babies he and my mom would hear only to find my sister and I sound</b>
<br><b>asleep in our beds.&nbsp; He also told them of a full body apparition
(sp.)</b>
<br><b>that he had conversations with in our house.&nbsp; He also told
them of a</b>
<br><b>strange habit I had that I did not know of at the time, apparently
I</b>
<br><b>used to bang my head against the walls while I was sleeping, enough
so</b>
<br><b>that I put a hole in the wall one night.&nbsp; I think thankfully
for all of</b>
<br><b>us we moved.</b>
<br><b>I never had any kind of experience again until I was 12,&nbsp; My
grandmother</b>
<br><b>was a diabetic and by her own will decided not to take of herself.</b>
<br><b>Before they pulled the plug on her my parents flew down to where
she was</b>
<br><b>and the day they were going to pull the plug I was in school.&nbsp;
Around</b>
<br><b>10:30 am I got this really bad feeling&nbsp; and began to cry uncontrollably</b>
<br><b>my teacher sent me to the counselors office.&nbsp; While sitting
there with</b>
<br><b>the secretary putting up with my crying I got this sudden feeling
of</b>
<br><b>calm and just stopped crying.&nbsp; It was about 12:30 when this
happened.</b>
<br><b>The counselor asked what had just happened.&nbsp; I told him about
my</b>
<br><b>grandmother and told him that they had pulled the plug but she didn't</b>
<br><b>die but when I had stopped crying I was sure she had passed.&nbsp;
Later that</b>
<br><b>night, my parents had called the friends we were staying with and
told</b>
<br><b>them what had happened to my grandmother, it matched down to the
min.</b>
<br><b>the crying fit and sudden feeling of calm I had experienced.</b>
<br><b>Later that summer, we went to visit my grandfather, while I was
there I</b>
<br><b>saw my grandma sitting at a chair of hers brushing her hair, this
was in</b>
<br><b>her private bedroom that we had never been let into before she had</b>
<br><b>died.&nbsp; When we were leaving to return home my grandfather was
giving</b>
<br><b>everything my&nbsp; grandmother owned to my mom I told her not to
take the</b>
<br><b>brush.&nbsp; She left it behind and I have never seen her again.</b>
<br><b>I am going&nbsp; to stop at this point lest you think me nuts.&nbsp;
I will tell</b>
<br><b>you more about the other experiences&nbsp; and about being here
in Japan in</b>
<br><b>another letter but I want to get your read on it so far.&nbsp; Sorry

<br><b>not&nbsp; tell a great embellished story but I figure the straight

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another story - I got a million</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: EngelT@sosmail.state.mi.us</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have lived in my current apartment for going on 2 years.&nbsp;
Nothing ever</b>
<br><b>happened until my roommate moved in in May.&nbsp; We are both very
spiritual</b>
<br><b>people and that is the only reason I think something would be attracted
to</b>
<br><b>us.&nbsp; We constantly see what I call "shadow people".&nbsp; You
see them out of the</b>
<br><b>corner of your eye, but when you look straight at it, nothing is
there.</b>
<br><b>Things don't happen all the time; it's actually quite sporadic.&nbsp;
One weekend</b>
<br><b>in particular, whatever it is became violent.</b>
<br><b>I had a beautiful blown glass bottle of cherry vinegar hanging on
a stand on</b>
<br><b>top of the refrigerator.&nbsp; It was directly in the center.&nbsp;
To the left of it</b>
<br><b>were a bottle of soy sauce and a bottle of Worchester.&nbsp; This
bottle of</b>
<br><b>vinegar was very special to me.&nbsp; It had been a Christmas present
from</b>
<br><b>someone I had lost touch with and it was basically all I had left
of the</b>
<br><b>friendship.&nbsp; I went out to the kitchen for a glass of water.&nbsp;
It was about</b>
<br><b>June so I was barefoot.&nbsp; I reached into the cupboard for a
glass when I</b>
<br><b>heard a wobbling sound behind me.&nbsp; When I turned I saw the
vinegar bottle</b>
<br><b>hit the counter, bounce off and shatter at my feet.&nbsp; After
the initial shock</b>
<br><b>wore off I looked up at where the bottle had been and noticed that
the 2</b>
<br><b>sauce bottles were in exactly the same place they had been prior.&nbsp;
The way</b>
<br><b>they were situated, they should have been knocked off by the vinegar
bottle</b>
<br><b>and stand.&nbsp; I really began to freak at this point.&nbsp; I
could not move out of</b>
<br><b>the kitchen.&nbsp; There was glass all around me.&nbsp; I knew if
I stepped anywhere,</b>
<br><b>I'd slice my feet open.&nbsp; My roommate was not home from work
yet, so I stood</b>
<br><b>terrified and trapped by broken glass in my kitchen until he got
home.</b>
<br><b>Needless to say, we decided to eat out that evening.&nbsp; I spent
the night at</b>
<br><b>my neighbor's.</b>
<br><b>The next day, I had gone to the pool with my neighbor.&nbsp; I locked
the doors,</b>
<br><b>closed the windows and turned on the AC before we left.&nbsp; When
we came back I</b>
<br><b>noticed my roommate's framed picture of Tiger Stadium (one of his
prized</b>
<br><b>possessions) was not on the wall in the hallway.&nbsp; We walked
towards the</b>
<br><b>hallway where we found the picture, face down on the carpet.&nbsp;
All the other</b>
<br><b>photos around it were skewed at different angles as if someone had
run down</b>
<br><b>the hall and hit both walls.&nbsp; We also noticed that the nails
that held the</b>
<br><b>photo up had broken in half.&nbsp; These nails were drywall nails.&nbsp;
There is no</b>
<br><b>way the weight of that photo alone could have broken them.&nbsp;
We picked up the</b>
<br><b>photo and the glass had been broken.&nbsp; Most of it was on the
floor underneath</b>
<br><b>the photo.&nbsp; We noticed a couple more strange things.&nbsp;
On closer inspection,</b>
<br><b>the glass was broken in a circular pattern, as if someone had hit
it with an</b>
<br><b>elbow or fist.&nbsp; There is no way that it would break like that
on impact.</b>
<br><b>The scariest thing though was that when we cleaned up the glass,
there was a</b>
<br><b>boot imprint in the carpeting under where we had found the photo.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>imprint stayed in the carpet for almost a week.&nbsp; I had vacuumed
over it</b>
<br><b>twice, but it remained.&nbsp; Also, the apartment had still been
locked up tight</b>
<br><b>but the AC had been turned off.&nbsp; There is no way anyone could
have come in</b>
<br><b>and done this.&nbsp; My apartment complex only has two maintenance
guys and they</b>
<br><b>were on vacation that weekend, so it couldn't have been them.</b>
<br><b>We were all pretty freaked about this.&nbsp; I can handle living
with a spirit</b>
<br><b>(I've done it before), but when it begins to destroy treasured personal</b>
<br><b>items and terrorize my cats, then we have a problem.&nbsp; I have
been studying</b>
<br><b>candle-burning rituals for some time, so I did a cleansing ritual
and we</b>
<br><b>burned some sage.&nbsp; We did this 2 nights in a row.&nbsp; After
the second night,</b>
<br><b>the boot imprint disappeared.&nbsp; We still see things every once
in a while,</b>
<br><b>but it hasn't been violent since.</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp; A Visit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: memal@racc2000.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had several experiences in my life that I believe to be ghosts..&nbsp;&nbsp;
I live about 350 miles away from my family.&nbsp; I don't see them or talk
with them as often as I would like.. I am only pointing this out so you
understand that I was not aware of any problems that my aunt may have had.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was at work in the summer of 99.&nbsp; At the time I was a seamtress.&nbsp;
I heard someone call my name.&nbsp; Susan!&nbsp; I turned to look and no
one was there.&nbsp; I had the feeling someone needed me and something&nbsp;
was wrong.&nbsp; I heard (Susan again), this time I thought the only people&nbsp;
who call me that are my mother and my Aunt.&nbsp; I thought it's not my
mom.&nbsp; What could be wrong with my Aunt,&nbsp; why does she need me.&nbsp;
This time I heard SUSAN,&nbsp; It was so loud I turned to look to see if
someone had called me.&nbsp; My boss was standing behind me and I said
did you call me?&nbsp; She said no.&nbsp; About a half to one hour later
they called me to the office for a phone call.&nbsp; It was my daughter
she said my Aunt had died a couple of hours ago.&nbsp; In my heart I believe

<br><b>Sharing My Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bradm@epix.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was at my dad's house one weekend in march
of 00, I on the comuter at night. the computer is in the dining/kitchen
and 10 meters behind it is a door leading to the outside.&nbsp; I got a
weird feeling that someone was watching be from outside the door,but I
just shook it off. And then an hour later all of a sudden I froze.&nbsp;
I didn't expect, i couldn't move at all, but i could breath ok.&nbsp; I
then heard two voices whispering.&nbsp; I couldn't make out what they were
saying but for some reason i could tell (I don't know why) that they were
talking about me. this went on for about two or three minutes. Then as
soon as it came, it was gone.&nbsp; REALLY SCARED, i turned the computer
off and I ran to my room.&nbsp; But as soon as I got into the room and
shut the door, a feeling a peace and calmness.&nbsp; I got into bed and
imeadiatly I rememberd something.&nbsp; My grandmother died almost exactly
a year ago (in march of 99).&nbsp; I then thought she might have been one
of the voices, wether she was trying to me that she was ok or if she was
checking on me.&nbsp; As to the other voice I don't know who it was.&nbsp;
It might have been my grandfather who died in '94 of a severe heart attack.&nbsp;
During my grandmothers final days her lung cancer spread to her brain.&nbsp;
She had to spend her last week in a hospital bed in her room.&nbsp; She
would say things that made no sense at all. She would forget the names
of her grandchildren, but every time I visited her in her final days she
wouldn't forget my name and knew who I was.&nbsp; I got the phone call
at&nbsp; around 7:00 pm on a Thursday at my mothers place just as I was
leaving to visit her at what I thought would be the last time I would see
her alive again.</b>

<p><b>George</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: laurial@jps.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grew up in a house which was built in the 40's
and always felt cold spots upstairs in my bedroom and the guest room. Our
cats were often spooked and refused to go upstairs too. Anyway, a friend
of mine advised me to talk to "it" (that weird icy feeling liek something
not there but present) and that I should give it a name i wouldn't be afraid
of. I started calling it George, after an old plow horse I once knew. It
got easyier to deal with things suddenly comming up missing. I would claer
a space on my dresser and tell "george I really needed the item back. I
would turn my back to the dresser and ask George to return the item, then
I would turn around, and it would be there on my dresser where I'd cleared
a place for it. I know it sounds wierd, but it would happen. Also, if George
got angry, like the time a friend of mine brought over an Ouigi board to
try out, the whole house filled up with flies. I killed over twenty, but
there were more than that. They came out of nowhere, and disappeared once
I begged Gorge to make it go away. The flies came with a humming sound,
not like wings beating.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once my mother was very ill and the family was
concerned about cancer. I was feeling very frightened and alone, and was
up late crying in my bed. A light came from my hallway, and I turned to
see a thin man in a brown suit standing there looking at me. I said, "dad,
what are you doing here? It's (here I turned and looked at my clock) 3:00
in the morning" when i tuned back, the hall was dark and empty. My dad
is heavy set, and thought it fun to tease me about "Casper" for months
afterward. I don't think George liked my dad making fun of him. Later,
my parents tried to sell the house, and it didn't want to be sold. Any
time someone was shown the house, it would start to produce a horrible
acrid smell, worse than a catbox that's never been cleaned. The smell would
only last while strangers were in the house, and would dissipate after
they left. When My mum disrespected George, he took an aniversary clock
she'd earned at work and threw it from the wall into the middle of the
room. George will not leave the house. He's still there when I visit. I
don't like the house I grew up in, But I've figured out how to accept George.
I'm just not sure he accepts us. I still feel unwelcome upstairs.</b><b></b>

<br><b>passed the age that her parents were when they died.&nbsp; My Grandmother
was 62.</b>
<br><b>When she first got out of the hospital, I thought she would never
be right</b>
<br><b>again.&nbsp; She didn't want to do anything anymore.&nbsp; You have
to understand, my</b>
<br><b>Granma was very active.&nbsp; She rarely ever stayed at home.&nbsp;
After my Granpa</b>
<br><b>passed away, she even went out dancing with dates.&nbsp; Anyway,
a few months</b>
<br><b>later, she began to be her old self again.&nbsp; My Aunt was getting
married on</b>
<br><b>August 20 and my Granma became very busy again, helping with the
last minute</b>
<br><b>preparations.&nbsp; My Granma encouraged me to sing at the reception.&nbsp;
She said</b>
<br><b>she wanted to share my voice with everyone she could.&nbsp; She
told me to be</b>
<br><b>proud of my talent and that I should show it off every chance I
get.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>wedding went off without a hitch and my parents and I went back
home.&nbsp; On</b>
<br><b>August 25 my Granma passed away of a massive heart attack.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>devastated.&nbsp; That night we drove up north to my Granma's house
to stay there</b>
<br><b>for the funeral.&nbsp; That night I went to bed early but couldn't
sleep.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>began to sing a song called "Another Lucky Star", it's a song about
how the</b>
<br><b>one's you love become your Lucky Star after they pass.&nbsp; As
I sang the song,</b>
<br><b>sobbing, I saw a glimmer of light out of the corner of my left eye.&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>looked, I saw my grandmother come into focus.&nbsp; She sat down
on the bed next</b>
<br><b>to me and wrapped her arms around me.&nbsp; I can still remember
the warmth that</b>
<br><b>radiated into me from her touch.&nbsp; She leaned close my ear and
told me to be</b>
<br><b>strong; that now she could always be with me, in my heart.&nbsp;
She told me to</b>
<br><b>help my mother get through this and to always speak of her with
happiness.</b>
<br><b>She would not tolerate us being sad.&nbsp; She then said goodbye,
she said she</b>
<br><b>had a lot to do and a lot of people to see.&nbsp; Then she faded
away.&nbsp; The next</b>
<br><b>morning I spoke to my father about my experience.&nbsp; His faced
expressed</b>
<br><b>complete amazement.&nbsp; He grabbed my hand and took me outside
away from my</b>
<br><b>mother and her sisters.&nbsp; My father told me that my grandmother
had also come</b>
<br><b>to him to say goodbye.&nbsp; Later we found out that my mother had
a dream about</b>
<br><b>my grandmother.&nbsp; I don't think it was a dream though, I just
don't think my</b>
<br><b>mother could handle thinking of it in any other way.</b>
<br><b>I have more stories about my Granma, but I will share those another
time.</b>
<br><b>Story #2</b>
<br><b>When I was about 22 I was still living with my parents.&nbsp; I
was working 2</b>
<br><b>jobs and was in a band too (my grandmother wanted me to share my
talent).&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was enjoying one of my few days off at home alone as mom and dad
were both</b>
<br><b>at work.&nbsp; I was getting ready to get in the shower to finally
start my day</b>
<br><b>when the phone rang.&nbsp; It was my mother calling from work.&nbsp;
I was trying to</b>
<br><b>get off with her when a strange buzzing sound came over the phone.&nbsp;
The TV,</b>
<br><b>remote, and table lamp began flickering, and I saw a bright flashing
out the</b>
<br><b>living room window.&nbsp; I stood there just paralyzed, trying to
figure out what</b>
<br><b>was going on.&nbsp; At that moment I heard a deep, familiar, soothing
voice say</b>
<br><b>to me (in my left ear), "Stay calm, drop everything and get out!"&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>immediately ran outside and just as I hit the aluminum screen door
a power</b>
<br><b>surge came through the house and my right arm got zapped (the current
came</b>
<br><b>through the siding and the door).&nbsp; One of the power lines at
the pole was</b>
<br><b>coming down and sending surges through our house.&nbsp; After the
power company</b>
<br><b>came to investigate and left I told my mother about the voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I didn't</b>
<br><b>think she believed me.&nbsp; Later she told me that when she was
at work a man's</b>
<br><b>voice told her to call me.&nbsp; She couldn't figure out why, but
did so anyway.</b>
<br><b>We were told later by the investigator that the surges even went
through the</b>
<br><b>water pipes.&nbsp; Had my mother not called me, I would have been
in the shower</b>
<br><b>when the surges hit and I would have died.&nbsp; We have discussed
the event many</b>
<br><b>more times over the last few years and we realized that the voice
belonged</b>
<br><b>to my Grandfather (my mom's dad) .&nbsp; He had passed away 4 years
prior.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>saved my life.</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My friend Eddie and I had just left the movies.&nbsp; It was cold
and we huddled</b>
<br><b>in our coats while we smoked a cigarette before getting into his
car.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>were discussing the movie we had just seen "Unbreakable" and how
similar the</b>
<br><b>thrill was to that of "Sixth Sense."</b>
<br><b>"Yeah I know how that kid must have felt seeing dead people,"&nbsp;
Eddie joked</b>
<br><b>nervously.</b>
<br><b>I looked at him inquiringly and he just smiled and said nevermind,
but my</b>
<br><b>curiousity had been peeked.&nbsp; "How would you know how the boy
in the movie</b>
<br><b>felt?"&nbsp; I asked.</b>
<br><b>"Because I live in a haunted house," he laughed.&nbsp; "Now you
think I'm crazy."</b>
<br><b>That is when I got to smile and I also informed him that I am a
paranormal</b>
<br><b>investigator so I didn't think him crazy, but I could tell by the
look on</b>
<br><b>his face that he was surprised that I not only believe in ghosts,
but that I</b>
<br><b>also investigated them.</b>
<br><b>"Well, come investigate my house then," he asked.&nbsp; "You can
come over</b>
<br><b>tonight if you want."</b>
<br><b>And so my adventure began.&nbsp; We got in his car and on the way
over there he</b>
<br><b>tried to tell me about the activity in the house, but I asked him
not to.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>wanted to "feel" the place out myself.</b>
<br><b>When we pulled up outside of his house I didn't feel weird and nothing</b>
<br><b>seemed abnormal.&nbsp; We went in the back entrance through the
basement and then</b>
<br><b>he took me on a tour of the house.&nbsp; Everything felt fine until
we entered</b>
<br><b>the upstairs hallway.&nbsp; The hair on the back of my neck and
on my arms stood</b>
<br><b>up and I felt myself getting short of breath.&nbsp; All I knew is
that I didn't</b>
<br><b>like that hallway.</b>
<br><b>I turned to Eddie and I said, "She's here."</b>
<br><b>He got a funny look on his face and asked, "How do you know she
is here?</b>
<br><b>How do you know the ghost is a she?"</b>
<br><b>"I'm sensing a woman's presence.&nbsp; She doesn't like me being
here."&nbsp; I took a</b>
<br><b>deep breath and walked down the hallway, "Most of the activity happens
here</b>
<br><b>in this hallway and in the kitchen," I whispered.&nbsp; Eddie just
nodded his</b>
<br><b>head.</b>
<br><b>I continued walking the upstairs hallway and then entered the computer
room.</b>
<br><b>I turned on the light, but just as quickly it blew.&nbsp; I stood
in the room for</b>
<br><b>a moment before hurrying out, closing the door behind me.&nbsp;
I walked back up</b>
<br><b>the hallway and then through the kitchen.&nbsp; In the kitchen it
was very cold.</b>
<br><b>At that point I was wishing that I had my equipment with me.&nbsp;
I asked Eddie</b>
<br><b>quietly if he had a camera.&nbsp; He nodded yes and then went to
get it.&nbsp; As I</b>
<br><b>was standing there in the dark kitchen I felt a kind of anxiety
settle over</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; A feeling that I needed to get out of there before something
terrible</b>
<br><b>happened, but I also knew that these weren't my feelings.&nbsp;
They were hers.</b>
<br><b>Eddie came back with the camera and took some pictures of the kitchen
and</b>
<br><b>the living room.</b>
<br><b>I left that night and haven't been back since, although I would
love to do a</b>
<br><b>full investigation on the house.&nbsp; I just know that she is there
and would</b>
<br><b>like to know the reason.&nbsp; Eddie is supposed to research some
of the</b>
<br><b>background on the house and get back to me.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Regular Haunts!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: thailiavigue98@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is the first time writing my experiences here.</b>
<br><b>I have quite a few.&nbsp; But I will start with the first</b>
<br><b>on that happened.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;When I was 12 (1992) I lived in Montana.&nbsp; I was really</b>
<br><b>sick.&nbsp; The doctors thought it might have been from the</b>
<br><b>soldiers bringing back some weird stuff back from</b>
<br><b>Desert Storm.&nbsp; But to me I felt like I was going to</b>
<br><b>die. I remember, the night I was going through the</b>
<br><b>worst of what I had.&nbsp; My parents were carrying me to</b>
<br><b>bed cause I had no energy to walk, and barely speak.</b>
<br><b>But when they got to my room, I saw a woman sitting in</b>
<br><b>the corner.&nbsp; I asked me mom who she was.&nbsp; She thought</b>
<br><b>I was hallucinating because I was so sick.</b>
<br><b>Later that night, I was awakened by something watching</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; I looked over and saw a woman sitting with me on</b>
<br><b>the bed.&nbsp; She was wearing all white and had long curly</b>
<br><b>hair.&nbsp; She saw just looking at me and had a smile on</b>
<br><b>her face. I feel back to a peaceful sleep.&nbsp; After that</b>
<br><b>I got better REAL fast.&nbsp; It was almost like my</b>
<br><b>guardian angel watching over me.</b>
<br><b>My second experience didn't come to me until my family</b>
<br><b>and I moved to Washington State, in a little suburb of</b>
<br><b>Seattle called Auburn.&nbsp; We lived in a brick duplex.</b>
<br><b>As soon as you walked into the house you'd be in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen and you'd see the darkness beyond that.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>house my family now call "the dungeon" because it was</b>
<br><b>so very dark.</b>
<br><b>The first ghost I saw in that house wasn't until 6</b>
<br><b>months after we moved in.&nbsp; My parents had just left</b>
<br><b>for work and my school was less than a block away.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was getting ready for school that morning.&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>walking out my room and was in the threshold of the</b>
<br><b>door when "she" walked right in front of me.&nbsp; She was</b>
<br><b>wearing a long black late 1800s dress and had her long</b>
<br><b>black hair down.&nbsp; She had walked through the hall</b>
<br><b>wall, stopped, looked at me, turned back and kept</b>
<br><b>walking right into the bathroom.&nbsp; She was so pale and</b>
<br><b>translucent!&nbsp; I was petrified!&nbsp; But I had to get ready</b>
<br><b>for school, so I went into the bathroom anyways, and</b>
<br><b>got ready.&nbsp; I thought I had a hallucination and didn't</b>
<br><b>think about it after that.&nbsp; UNTIL..... One night my</b>
<br><b>mom and I got to bed really late, a little after</b>
<br><b>midnight.&nbsp; We turned off all the lights.&nbsp; It was pitch</b>
<br><b>black in the house.&nbsp; Not even the light from outside</b>
<br><b>shown in. (That's why we called it the Dungeon) We</b>
<br><b>were almost to the hall when I saw a flash of light</b>
<br><b>and saw a little boy about 7 or 8 years old run right</b>
<br><b>in front of us.&nbsp; He was wearing knickerbockers and a</b>
<br><b>little cap.&nbsp; I soon as he dissappered.&nbsp; I asked my mom</b>
<br><b>if she saw it.&nbsp; In a shaky voice she said no and said</b>
<br><b>she saw that kind of stuff all the time at work.&nbsp; How</b>
<br><b>could she know what I saw, I didn't tell her.</b>
<br><b>Too go on with my true story, I saw a man in my</b>
<br><b>bathroom with a knife in his hand.&nbsp; When I looked at</b>
<br><b>our knife holder, there was a knife missing and not in</b>
<br><b>our dishwasher.&nbsp; To this day there is still a knife</b>
<br><b>missing.I saw a girl walking around my room, I had</b>
<br><b>forgotten I had set my clock and when it went off at</b>
<br><b>6:30am I got up and saw her.&nbsp; She too was wearing</b>
<br><b>black and had the same black hair.&nbsp; She started to</b>
<br><b>come toward me.&nbsp; After that I don't remember anything.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I just remember waking up a while later. Then, there</b>
<br><b>was a time when I had just went outside and had</b>
<br><b>forgotten something inside.&nbsp; When I went back to get</b>
<br><b>it, everything in the room looked like a tornado went</b>
<br><b>through the living room. The very last thing that</b>
<br><b>happened in the house. It was about a month before we</b>
<br><b>moved.&nbsp; I was in the pantry getting some macaroni on</b>
<br><b>the top shelf.&nbsp; When I felt pressure on my chest and</b>
<br><b>was thrown against the wall behind me. The force was</b>
<br><b>so great, that I had bruises on my chest from what</b>
<br><b>ever pushed me and bruises on my back from hitting the</b>
<br><b>wall. But you know, every time I told my mom and dad</b>
<br><b>about it and they never believed me.&nbsp; I told them</b>
<br><b>about a month after we moved and they said they</b>
<br><b>believed me the whole time.&nbsp; So, whatever it was I</b>
<br><b>think it's still following me.&nbsp; The house I live in</b>
<br><b>now, is pretty scary too!</b>
<br><b>Just in the past year and half I have heard chairs</b>
<br><b>moving, the table with the glass in them moving like</b>
<br><b>someone is walking and accidently hitting it as they</b>
<br><b>walk by.&nbsp; I have also heard "him" walking in and out</b>
<br><b>of my room and night and seeing nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>boyfriend who WAS a non believer has heard "him"</b>
<br><b>walking by him and has heard the chairs move and seen</b>
<br><b>the dishes move.&nbsp; "He" has banged on the walls in my</b>
<br><b>room and the garage.&nbsp; Now, I'm just really scared and</b>
<br><b>I can say, " I see dead people."&nbsp; Cause I have seen</b>
<br><b>"him" walking in my house! I feel it is a he or a him</b>
<br><b>just the way he watches me, the way he walks in the</b>
<br><b>house, and just the way I feel when he's in the room.</b>
<br><b>My mom has heard this stuff, but keeps denying it.</b>
<br><b>Maybe someday I can solve this mystery.&nbsp; But for now</b>
<br><b>I'm just really scared!</b>

<p><b>Ghost And Hauntings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Geosmurf@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>an experience i found&nbsp; for a greater part of my life, was when
my grandfather</b>
<br><b>died. He lived in a semi detached house, and after his passing,
experiences</b>
<br><b>were found in the house, from that of myself and my mum to my granmother
who</b>
<br><b>lived there.&nbsp; My grandfather was paralysed on the left side
adn had&nbsp; a</b>
<br><b>caliper on his leg so he could not walk in a proper manner even
with aide,</b>
<br><b>when he passed at night time my granny could hear the thumping noise
of the</b>
<br><b>paralysed leg and caliper coming up the stairs, on every other step,
this</b>
<br><b>happened fairly often until one night we all stayed in my grannys
house, she</b>
<br><b>had wakened and was screaming and making noises and frothing at
the mouth, my</b>
<br><b>mum ran in and seen the state she was in and trying to calm her
down my</b>
<br><b>granny turned and said that my grandfather was standing there with
a knife</b>
<br><b>,when my mum came in she was in front of him .</b>
<br><b>My mum had also seen his face in the mirror on the dresser with
what she</b>
<br><b>called the devils face or mask beside him.</b>
<br><b>I always experienced coldness in the house especially aftert he
death, you</b>
<br><b>could feel the atmosphere and nothing could heat the house . The
feeling</b>
<br><b>could more felt upstairs near the bedrooms especially the back room
where he</b>
<br><b>used to sleep. There was sometimes rappings at the front door and
i</b>
<br><b>experienced this myself, 3 knocks at the door came one summers afternoon,
and</b>
<br><b>i walked out to answer the door, no-one was there or in the street
no wind</b>
<br><b>nothing to knock the door at all.</b>
<br><b>Strang as it may well be but sceptics will always have a side to
answer with</b>
<br><b>no matter what the evidence from paranormal to possible cover-ups.</b>
<br><b>To even look at my grannys front bedroom window from the outside
you can</b>
<br><b>picture almost a ghostly figure just waiting to appear as she used
to stand</b>
<br><b>years ago. Everytime i come down that street it feels like you are
drawn to</b>
<br><b>look up 2 or more times to see what you feel is there, but lacks
nothing.</b>

<br><b>The Old Man</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mbono@cecom.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I can honestly say I have only seen a ghost once in my life. Unlike
the</b>
<br><b>experiences of many people, this was not a wispy dark shadow caught
out</b>
<br><b>of the corner of my eye. I actually looked him in the face and he
was</b>
<br><b>only a couple feet away from me. It happened when my husband and
I had</b>
<br><b>finally saved enough money to move out of our apartment and into
our own</b>
<br><b>home. It was a small brick bungalow in a neighborhood of brick bungalows</b>
<br><b>in southeast Warren. The city touches the northern boarder of Detroit.</b>
<br><b>The neighborhoods were built more than 50 years ago to house all
the new</b>
<br><b>employees the growing auto makers were hiring. We purchased the
house</b>
<br><b>from an elderly polish couple who had somehow raised five children
in</b>
<br><b>that tiny house. They told us that they had acquired the home after
the</b>
<br><b>death of her cousin -- the original owner.</b>
<br><b>The house was very well kept and impeccably clean. Though it needed
to</b>
<br><b>be updated from it's 70's decor, you could feel the love that permeated</b>
<br><b>it. My husband and I spent a lot of sweat equity fixing it up and
making</b>
<br><b>it our own. Our most recent accomplishment had been turning one
of the</b>
<br><b>downstairs bedrooms into a computer room/office. The door to the
room</b>
<br><b>directly faced the short hall leading to a three-way junction with
the</b>
<br><b>kitchen on the left, the living room on the right and the archway
of the</b>
<br><b>narrow staircase&nbsp; that led to the upstairs bedroom directly
facing it.</b>
<br><b>My husband had just bought a new computer and was enjoying his new
toy</b>
<br><b>in the room we had just finished. I had been watching him play a</b>
<br><b>computer game, but not nearly enjoying it as much as he was. Computer</b>
<br><b>games are just not spectator sports. I decided to read a book I
had on</b>
<br><b>the dresser up stairs and took off to walk down the short hall and
head</b>
<br><b>up the stairs.</b>
<br><b>As I launched myself onto the staircase, I turned my head into the</b>
<br><b>living room and distinctly saw and old man. It looked as though
he had</b>
<br><b>just stood up from sitting on the couch, since he was slightly hunched</b>
<br><b>over. The ghost was out of focus, like I was looking at him without
my</b>
<br><b>glasses on. Through I only saw him for a few seconds, I remember
every</b>
<br><b>detail. He was overweight and bald with short cut hair on the sides.
He</b>
<br><b>was wearing a white V-neck t-shirt and black dress slacks. By the
look</b>
<br><b>on his face it was clear that he was as much surprised by my presence
as</b>
<br><b>I was by his. As I passed the archway to the living room and hit
the</b>
<br><b>stairs, I stopped -- jerking back as quickly as I could, but of
course</b>
<br><b>he was not there.</b>
<br><b>Besides that, only one little thing kept happening that could be</b>
<br><b>attributed to ghostly activity. We had just bought a brand-new electric</b>
<br><b>stove. The knobs were on the back and, being brand new, they were
a</b>
<br><b>little stiff to operate. You had to push the know in and turn in
order</b>
<br><b>to turn on a burner. Right after we got the stove, I would come
down in</b>
<br><b>the morning and the very back left burner would be turned on low,
like</b>
<br><b>someone was keeping a pot of coffee warm. The first time it happened
I</b>
<br><b>turned it off and forgot about it. The next time I yelled at my
husband,</b>
<br><b>who of course denied it. The third time, I knew something weird
was</b>
<br><b>going on. The night before the fourth day, I checked that stove
all</b>
<br><b>over. Checked the knobs and everything to make sure it wasn't on.
But as</b>
<br><b>you can guess, when I got up in the morning it was on. That did
it. I</b>
<br><b>had it. I snapped the knob back to the off position and addressed
the</b>
<br><b>thin air. Angrily I said, "If you don't stop turning this stove
on</b>
<br><b>you're going to burn the whole house down! Now quit playing with
the</b>
<br><b>knob!" Amazingly enough, it never happened again.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Great-Grandfather</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: folkerbs@notes.udayton.edu</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>OK, here it goes.&nbsp; When I was younger I was very close to my</b>
<br><b>great-grandfather.&nbsp; I would constantly be over at his house
helping him</b>
<br><b>clean or just talking with him.&nbsp; And around the holidays I
would help him</b>
<br><b>cook, set up his Christmas tree, and wrap presents.&nbsp; However,
when I was</b>
<br><b>eleven my great-grandfather become fairly ill.&nbsp; His heart was
begining to</b>
<br><b>fail.&nbsp; My great grandfather stayed at the hospital for two
weeks.&nbsp; Since I</b>
<br><b>was only eleven my parents didn't want me going to see him at the</b>
<br><b>hospital...they wanted my memories of him to be pleasant</b>
<br><b>ones...anyways...After several weeks the doctors said that there
was</b>
<br><b>nothing more that they could do so we took him to Hospice (a place
where</b>
<br><b>you take someone that you know is going to die, and they help you
go on</b>
<br><b>peacefully).&nbsp; Within a couple days of going there he slipped
into a coma</b>
<br><b>and then died.&nbsp; However, before he went into the coma he said
bye to</b>
<br><b>everyone that was there.&nbsp; Since I was not allowed to be there...he
couldn't</b>
<br><b>say goodbye to me.&nbsp; As you can imagine I was devistated.&nbsp;
But then for some</b>
<br><b>reason several weeks after he died I decided to stay the night at
my</b>
<br><b>grandmothers.&nbsp; I was sleeping the the guest room (which has
its own</b>
<br><b>attached bathroom) when I was awoken by someone in the bathroom.&nbsp;
I knew</b>
<br><b>that only my grandparents and I were there, and since they had their
own</b>
<br><b>bathroom they wouldn't be using the guest one.&nbsp; I was too scared
to move.</b>
<br><b>I heard water running and then being turned off...it was then that
I saw my</b>
<br><b>great-grandfather leave the bathroom and walk towards the door.&nbsp;
He turned</b>
<br><b>towards me and mouthed out the words good bye and I love you!&nbsp;
Ever since</b>
<br><b>then I have had total closure over his death.</b>

<p><b>Haunted or Not</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cntrynaturals@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This story happened to me while I was staying at my mothers house
in Humboldt Az.It was about eight o' clock at night when my mom informed
me that she was going to go up to the local tavern for kareeokee night,
and that if I went anywhere I needed to lock the front door. About ten
minutes or so after she left I left locking the front door on my way out,
but beafore I left I turned the T.V off and shut off the kitchen light.
Around Twelve o' clock Returned to find the T.V and the kitchen light on.
I didn't think anything of it I figured that my mom might have come home
to get something and while she was there she turned them on. After getting
something to eat I went to bed. So I made sure the door was locked and
shut the Kitchen light and Telavision off and went into the back room where
I stayed when I was visiting. As soon as I layed down I heard the T.V click
on and then off it would do this about ten more times on and off until
i got up to look. As soon as i opened my door it went off. i passed it
off as my imagination and went back to my bed. About five minutes later
it clicked on again this time with the volume full blast. so i jumped out
of bed and went to the living room to find the kitchen light on as well.
i looked around to make sure no one was in the house maybe joking around
with me or something, and checked to make sure that the front door was
still locked and it was. so i turned of the T.V. again and went back to
bed. i layed there in my bed restless for a while then managed to fall
asleep, only to be awaken again at the sound of someone stomping down the
hallway. i thought maybe it was just my mom coming home. the stomping stopped
at my room and the door handle started to move so i yelled out "is that
you mom" when no none answered i got up and opened the door only to feel
a cold draft that felt like it went all the way to my bones. i got a little
freaked out and closed my door and layed down in my bed again trying to
fall asleep. well finally i did fall asleep when around two thirty in the
morning my door flew open and hit against my wall causing me to shoot out
of bed i looked up to find a kind of human figure standing in my doorway
staring at me. I just figured that it was my mom so i said goodnight and
told her i loved her and went back to sleep. when i awoke the next day
and went outside my moms car was still gone. When she came home i asked
her if she had been there at all that night after she left to the bar,
she told no and that she had stayed with a friend that night. Was this
just my imagination playing games? I don't think so.</b>

<br><b>I have been seeing ghosts since I was 15. I've had experiences with
smell,</b>
<br><b>clocks, orbs, animals, people, voices, you name it, it runs the
gamut.</b>
<br><b>Here's my story for your files. This was the first of what would
many</b>
<br><b>experiences. By now, I have accepted my unusual gift and learned
to work</b>
<br><b>with it. I recognize the signs and feelings of presences and have
found I</b>
<br><b>can tune in or out as needed or desired.</b>
<br><b>My Story:</b>
<br><b>My best friend and next door neighbor's brother died tragically
when I was</b>
<br><b>14. He and I were the same age and had grown up in each other's
houses as</b>
<br><b>all neighborhood kids tend to do. He wasn't a friend but more of
a brother.</b>
<br><b>His death was very hard on all of us. (He was accidentally killed
by a</b>
<br><b>mischarge from a loaded hunting rifle indoors. To this day, I can't
be</b>
<br><b>within eyesight of a gun. Even a gun on a policeman's waste makes
me</b>
<br><b>uneasy.)</b>
<br><b>Our town was very small at the time. There were less than 2500 people
and</b>
<br><b>our high school had 250 kids. Two summers after the accident, I
was taking</b>
<br><b>care of the family's cats while they were away at their summer cottage.</b>
<br><b>In the middle of the afternoon, I walked down the hill to their
house next</b>
<br><b>door to feed the cats. As I was halfway down the path, I felt a
strong</b>
<br><b>buzzing in the air. The closer I got to the house, the more the
energy</b>
<br><b>seemed to vibrate until I felt as if the entire area were pulsating
with</b>
<br><b>life.</b>
<br><b>It was a beautiful summer day. The sky was brilliant blue with puffy
white</b>
<br><b>clouds and the day was pleasantly warm and dry. As I reached the
back yard,</b>
<br><b>I could feel myself growing scared and panicky. It was as if someone
were</b>
<br><b>watching me. I even looked at the windows and screens of the house
to see if</b>
<br><b>someone had broken in because I could tell something wasn't right.
The</b>
<br><b>funniest thing to me, in hindsight, is I can hear myself saying
"Go on. Your</b>
<br><b>a big girl. What are you afraid of? You babysit!"</b>
<br><b>By the time I opened the back door, I was a nervous wreck. Out of
the corner</b>
<br><b>of my eye I kept looking to see what was wrong. Was there a burglar
in the</b>
<br><b>house? Was someone inside hiding somewhere?</b>
<br><b>I opened the door, called the cats and went to the cellar steps.
The cats'</b>
<br><b>dishes were kept in the basement by their litter box. I tuned on
the light</b>
<br><b>switch and I went downstairs to feed them. The entire time, I could
feel</b>
<br><b>someone over my shoulder. I looked around the cellar and talked
a mile a</b>
<br><b>minute to the cats trying to reassure myself that everything was
fine. I</b>
<br><b>remember looking at the basement bulkhead door to see if it was
open but it</b>
<br><b>was just as it should have been.</b>
<br><b>All I wanted was to get out of there, go home, and fast!</b>
<br><b>I fed the cats and started to walk up the stairs towards the kitchen.
About</b>
<br><b>halfway up the stairs, I looked up to the landing and there was
Dave* (name</b>
<br><b>changed, I never told his family)</b>
<br><b>I thought, "Oh look. Its Dave." I walked up 2 more steps. My momentum
was</b>
<br><b>going and my feet kept walking up the stairs.</b>
<br><b>"Dave is dead." 2 more steps.</b>
<br><b>"Dave is a ghost." 2 more steps and I was walking right through
him. I have</b>
<br><b>never forgotten that sensation of feeling a curtain of energy pass
through</b>
<br><b>my body from head to foot. At this point, I couldn't stop. My next
thought</b>
<br><b>was "Oh my god! I've just seen a ghost and I've just walked through
him!"</b>
<br><b>I was completely and utterly freaked out. I couldn't take my eyes
off the</b>
<br><b>kitchen back door. I stared at the door knob and just kept repeating
to</b>
<br><b>myself, "Please God, let it open. Please God, let it open. Please
God, let</b>
<br><b>it open. Please God, let it open. Please God, let it open."</b>
<br><b>I flew out the door and ran home to my house. I never ran so fast
in my</b>
<br><b>entire life. I didn't feel safe even at home and jumped on my bicycle
and</b>
<br><b>rode to an ice cream shop where a friend of mine was working that
day. It</b>
<br><b>took me hours to calm down.</b>
<br><b>It would be almost 10 years before I told anyone what had happened
that day.</b>
<br><b>It wasn't until my brother told me he had seen our grandfather one
night. I</b>
<br><b>felt for the first time I could open up about what had happened.</b>
<br><b>Many ghosts and experiences later, I'm not afraid or embarrassed
to discuss</b>
<br><b>them with friends. I've helped a friend or two "see" what was in
their</b>
<br><b>house. I can accept that there is a lot more to the world than our
linear</b>
<br><b>and forward moving experience of it.</b>
<br><b>I have one regret. To this day, I wonder, could I have helped Dave?
Is there</b>
<br><b>something he needed from me and my own cowardice and fright prevented
me</b>
<br><b>from helping him? I wish I could have been strong enough to say
"Dave, its</b>
<br><b>ok. You can go home now. We're ok. Its time for you to move on."</b>
<br><b>I've never forgotten that day.</b>
