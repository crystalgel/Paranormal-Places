<p><b>Mrs. Foley</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cis@oneimage.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was 22 yrs. old, my best friend and I "moved out" to live
on our own.&nbsp; We rented a townhouse with several units attached to
one another.&nbsp; From the day we moved in, we began to notice "odd "
occurances.&nbsp; For instance:&nbsp; when I wanted to use the phone, I
would pick up the receiver, and it would be dead.&nbsp; If I was upstairs,
I would go down stairs and find the receiver off of the hook, and vice-versa.&nbsp;
Since my friend worked days, and I worked evenings, we didn't get to talk
till the weekend. I&nbsp; told her what was happening, and nicely asked
her to remember to hang up the phone she started talking on if she switched
to the other one.&nbsp; She looked at me as if I had lost my mind, and
said "I was going to talk to you, and ask you to do the same!"&nbsp; After
that, all sorts of things started happening.&nbsp; We would go out, and
come home and our door was standing open.&nbsp; We noticed a "cold spot
" in our living room.&nbsp; (It was summer in Illinois,with 90 degree heat,
and 95% humidity, no air conditioning, and yet, whichever one of our friends
happened to be sitting on the lefthand side of our couch always pulled
the afghan down over them!)&nbsp; The clincher came one Saturday evening.&nbsp;
I was laying on the couch with my back to the room.&nbsp; I was NOT asleep.&nbsp;
All of a sudden, someone, who I thought was my roomate, ran through the
living room, and up the stairs.&nbsp; She was breathing really heavy, and
making kind of a "strangling" noise.&nbsp; I was alarmed, and jumped off
of the couch, and called up to her asking her what was wrong.&nbsp; My
roomate came out of the kitchen, panickey, asking me why I was yelling!&nbsp;
I told her what happened, and since all of this other stuff had happened,
she was scared as well.&nbsp; About a week later, recovering from "The
party of the night before", my friend and I were sitting on the back stoop
to get some air.&nbsp; Our next-door neighbor came over to introduce herself.&nbsp;
She asked us if we by any chance noticed anything "wierd" in our unit.&nbsp;
We briefly told her some of the things that were going on.&nbsp; She said
that "the other two girls" who had lived there before us had much the same
thing happening.&nbsp; It seems that "The Foley's" used to live in the
unit some years before.&nbsp; Mr. Foley was an alcoholic, and would come
home and beat his wife senseless.&nbsp; As a result, she lost most of her
hearing.&nbsp; When she needed help, she would call her daughter, and since
she couldn't hear well enough to talk, she would LEAVE THE PHONE OFF THE
HOOK as a signal.&nbsp; The neighbor also told us that she would see Mrs.
Foley walking down the street on the way home from the store, and she would
stop to give her a ride.&nbsp; It seems Mr. Foley would come home drunk,
and demand something for dinner that wasn't in the house, and Mrs. Foley
would have to walk to the store for it... the neighbor felt sorry for her
because "She had ASTHMA so bad that she could hardly breathe"!!&nbsp; So,
from then on, we just accepted Mrs. Foley, and for some reason&nbsp; we
were not afraid of her.&nbsp; However, some of the stunts she continued
to pull really ticked us off!!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Millermore Mansion-Dallas, TX</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: shyllanoon@juno.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I saw the entry in here for the haunting at the Millermore Mansion
@ Old</b>
<br><b>City Park in Dallas, TX and I would just like to confirm that it
is</b>
<br><b>indeed true. I've always had the ability to sense things, something
that</b>
<br><b>has been passed down thru generations of women in my family. I grew
up in</b>
<br><b>the Dallas/Ft. Worth since I was 4 but I had never heard of this</b>
<br><b>particular haunting. I don't normally go looking for them, know
what I</b>
<br><b>mean?? Anyhow, the first and only time I ever visited Old City Park
was</b>
<br><b>in Nov 2000. I had a friend visiting me from London who wanted to
see all</b>
<br><b>of Dallas. I knew nothing about the place really expect that is
was a</b>
<br><b>bunch of historical homes from around Dallas. As we were walking
up to</b>
<br><b>the Millermore mansion it immediately came over me that I was sensing</b>
<br><b>something, just not sure what. As we walked inside the mansion the</b>
<br><b>feeling hit me so hard it almost knocked me over. I kept quite as
we were</b>
<br><b>looking at the rooms on the 1st floor listening to the tour guide.
Then</b>
<br><b>as were turning to walk over to the bottom of the staircase there
was a</b>
<br><b>bench sitting by the back door. I looked at it and looked at our
tour</b>
<br><b>guide and said "There is someone sitting in that bench". The tour
guide,</b>
<br><b>looking panicked and not sure of what I had said asked "Dear, what
did</b>
<br><b>you just say?" I told her that there was a ghost in the house but
that</b>
<br><b>she didnt need to worry b/c the lady was good and would not harm
anyone.</b>
<br><b>The tour guide almost starting crying and then went on to tell me
that it</b>
<br><b>was believed that the ghost of the Mrs. Millermore was in the house
and</b>
<br><b>that people had claimed to see her sitting in the window at night
as they</b>
<br><b>drove by. My friend, who was speechless, never doubted me again
on things</b>
<br><b>like this. Needless to say the tour guide would not go upstairs
w/ us and</b>
<br><b>waiting outside of the house until we were done looking around.</b>

<br><b>Letting Go</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gailhellmann@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I`d like to start by mentioning I`ve only told this to a small number of
people, and as expected would look at me funny.......</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was about six years ago it was a hard time for me for some reason I
was plagued with terrifying dreams. For a week it was the same thing the
dream ended the same way,.... I`d die . It was always at the hands of&nbsp;
some scary looking person. As each new night arrived I just did not look
forward to blissful slumber as I normally would.&nbsp; Actually I was terrified.
What does this have to do with ghosts you ask?&nbsp; Let me continue,....On
the seventh night it was the turning point, in the dream again I`d been
chased down and just as I was to meet my end I awoke in a cold sweat, panting
for breath.&nbsp; As I motioned to sit up in my bed I noticed a form ,a
small form beside my bed.&nbsp; At first I thought it was my older of my
two sons."Hey what are you doing out of bed?". No answer.&nbsp; I took
a sip of my water, finding I was dehydrated. Then I noticed that there
was another form beside the small form, alittle taller. I felt it was male
just like the other form.&nbsp; He motions towards the foot of my bed for
me to look and there was another form, now what I mean by form is that
there were no features, no details</b>
<br><b>no mass, it was like they just used&nbsp; the air around them to
be used,. to be in a form.So they could be in a shape. They were like shadows.&nbsp;
If that makes sense to you , well I`m surprised.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway I must say
I wasn`t afraid for some reason.I offered some water to who I thought was
my son. He didn`t answer me. I asked again. The taller of the two motioned
"No it was okay,....." I looked at "him".&nbsp; Again he motioned "It`s
okay , it`s okay ,... everythings okay,......." .I don`t think I saw a
mouth for him to get that message across , but I "heard " him say that.Then
in a more meaningful way he said it again, until I understood he meant
my dreams, my terror not to worry anymore.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I felt
my body tingle then lights, tiny lights appearing at my abdomen , gathering
then they started to shoot out toward every limb of my body.And it felt
like every light was charged electrically and it burned , my whole body
burned. Then I felt myself moving across the bed .I don`t just mean "I"
got up and moved.&nbsp; I mean my body while lying on my back started moving,...shooting
toward the foot of the bed ,then toward the head of the bed , to the side
, to the other side, etc,...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was moving everywhere.
I heard my body rubbing on the sheets as I moved so it wasn`t my imagination,
my skin was still sensitive the following&nbsp; day.&nbsp; Then it felt
like my body was shooting at an incredible speed&nbsp; backward the G force
was incredible. A few minutes of this and I couldn`t take it anymore and
I shouted "Enough! Enough I can`t take this anymore! This has to stop!"
Then I stopped moving and slowly the lights began to slow in their progress
and dissipated until there was a little glow at my abdomen.Then it faded.
Full of sweat and understandably shaken , bewildered. I looked up at the
figures again he said "Everything will be okay,......" Then they faded
I felt an over whelming sense of peace&nbsp; and exhaustion and I lay down
and fell asleep.</b>
<br><b>The next day I felt like a new person, full of energy&nbsp; and
I felt relief and a sense of peace.&nbsp; My take on the situation , after
a conversation with a close friend, was that I was at a crossroads with
my life and I didn`t want that part of me to "die" , but those friendly
spirits helped me accept what was to be,...and it was okay. But as far
as the shooting lights from my body are concerned I researched&nbsp; enough
to find that there is a name for what I went through,...Kundalini experience.
If there is anyone out there whose had a similar experience. Please let
me know so I know that my sanity isn`t questionable.</b>

<p><b>Lee Cemetary Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: acid_freeze_@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My name is Travis&nbsp; and I heard about Lee Cemetary from a couple
of my friends, so I thought I might take a trip up there. I was in for
more than I bargoned for. It was about 11:00PM and we all stepped out of
our cars leaving them running as my friend that had been up there once
before told us to do. We all started to walk around and nothing odd happened
except for my sister throwing acorns at one of my friends and scaring the
crap out of him. We decided to take a walk through the cemetary and as
we came to the back gate where there is nothing but a minor dug up field
and a forest. We were walking back as one of my friends said that one part
of the forest was glowing, I didnt believe him until I looked and sure
enough it was glowing.</b>
<br><b>Me and a couple of my friends went to the edge of the forest where
it was glowing to check it out. It looked to be part of a foundation we
started to walk towards it and then we all heard a girl scream and keep
in mind no one lives behind Lee. I ran as fast as I could completly jumping
the fence and went back to the car to catch my breath as everybody followed.
Then we all decided to take a walk down the road a little ways, we got
about 300 yds. down the road and this horrible smell like something rotting
came apon us. We immediatlly turned around and walked back and the smell
decided to tag along about 200yds. and then the smell was just gone.</b>
<br><b>Then the wierdest thing of all, the road seperates the cemetary
from where the chuch used to be and on the cemetary side the fence was
dripping wet with dew and on the church side the fence was completly dry
and about 30 degrees less in temperature, and that is everything that happend
when I was in Lee Cemetary located in Verona, MO.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Hello. I'm really not sure what this was, but maybe you know.</b>
<br><b>It was evening, my husband was in the shower and I was watching
TV in the livingroom. Suddenly, from my periferal vision, I saw what I
can only describe as a ball of light. It zoomed through the livingroom
and dissapeared into the hallway. I thought that I had imagined it until
I noticed the plant that it zoomed passed was moving as if someone had
brushed up against it when walking past.</b>
<br><b>I found it kind of comforting because I had been thinking of my
baby daughter who had passed on, and I thought maybe it was her spirit
telling me that she lives on. Thanks.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Great Granpa....</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: thresher9@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are 2 different stories about 2 different
great grandfathers. It has occurred to me that over the years I have meet
many people whom have great ghost stories, hence I fully believe in ghost.
The two stories I would like to share are from my grandmother and my wife.
The first of the two stories starts in Fredrick, Md. My grandmothers mother
and sister lived side by side on a little one car street that my cousin
Matt refers to as Mayberry. The houses were small but had an upstairs and
were built long ago (I'm not sure how long ago, but they are old) Apparently
my great grandfather whom I never meet died of an aneurysm. Not long after
this my uncle Herman was sitting up late watching television. After he
finished the news he turned off the T.V. and as he did he noticed a figure
sitting in the opposite chair (Which was my Aunt Jones). He immediately
sat down and sat with the figure. Apparently he new right away that this
was his father in law and never became scared. Well this went on and on,
night after night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well one night late after everyone went to sleep including Uncle Herman,
he was shaken awake by my Aunt Joan. He ask her what was the problem and
she told him that there was a man at the end of there bed. Uncle Herman
replied that he was her father and went back to sleep. I guess because
Aunt Joan got so upset that to my knowledge they have never seen the ghost
again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The second story is from my wife. And she will write her story right know
here! I first saw a man in my minds eye when I was eight years of age.&nbsp;
It was around three in the morning and I was asleep.&nbsp; I woke up with
great fear and looked out my bedroom door.&nbsp; There with my minds eye
I saw a tall man 6 foot maybe just a little taller, he had silver hair
and wore&nbsp; a black suit with a white dress shirt.&nbsp; I say I saw
him with my minds eye because I could not see him as I could one of my
brothers or sisters but I could see him.&nbsp; I was so scared I could
not move.&nbsp; He came into my room through the open door and walked up
to the foot of my bed.&nbsp; My heart beat so fast I thought it would break.&nbsp;
When I got that scared the man moved backwards away from the bed.&nbsp;
Finally after what seemed like an eternity the gray hair man was just gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I ran down stairs to my parents bedroom door but would not go in.&nbsp;
This is the sad part of my true story,&nbsp; I was more afraid of my parents
than this man that work me in the middle of the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Both my parents were alcoholics.&nbsp; My mother was mentally cruel and
my father was physically mean.&nbsp; I was not alone I have seven sisters
and brothers.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This silver haired man came maybe twice a month in the night until I was
thirty-two years old.&nbsp; Everywhere I moved he was there.&nbsp; I married
and moved out of state, he was also there visiting me in the middle of
the night and my fear of him was less but still there.&nbsp; This went
on for years and his visits were always in the night when everyone was
asleep.&nbsp; I would wake in the night with fear and he would come to
visit me.&nbsp; If I got to scared he would always back away.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After many years and two wonderful son's I felt it was time to leave my
husband who had not worked in seven years but always had time to drink,
take drugs and be cruel to our boys&nbsp; and myself.&nbsp; It was after
this decision that my spirit came for the last time.&nbsp; He came in the
middle of the night again but this time I was not afraid.&nbsp; He not
only came to the foot of the bed but around to the side and kissed my forehead.
I knew right then and there who he was.....he was my great grandfather
O'Doud.&nbsp; he died just before I was born.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After three or four years i went to my mother about this.&nbsp; Please
note at this time she was clean and sober for fifteen years. I told her
about the many years of seeing who I think was great grandfather (her grandfather
whom she knew very well). Mother got up,&nbsp; went to the closet went
through some boxes came back and has a picture of grandfather O'Doud.&nbsp;
It&nbsp; was him.&nbsp; All those years greatgrandfather was with me. "Why?"&nbsp;
I asked mother.&nbsp; Because...........Great grandfather has nine children,
he loved each and everyone but his favorite was Aunt Thelma.&nbsp; I was
told I look just like her, I act just like her, and I love life as much
as she did.&nbsp; Mother felt greatgrandfather was there all those years
to help me through such bad times.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I no longer see greatgrandfather but my life is good now.&nbsp; I have
a wonderful husband who loves me for me and would never even say a mean
word to me.&nbsp; Mother says because I have john I no longer need grandfather.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
let me leave you with this bit of info.&nbsp;&nbsp; My son Chris who is
like myself in many ways has seen grandpa O'doud from time to time.</b>

<p><b>Control The Feelings</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found
your web page, read your personal</b>
<br><b>story, and was deeply impressed with the courage you</b>
<br><b>showed in facing your problem. I wish I could tell you</b>
<br><b>that I had been as brave. While I was on my school's</b>
<br><b>trip to Greece, I had a disturbing experience. We were</b>
<br><b>on a tour of the country side and one of our sites was</b>
<br><b>the Tomb of Agammemnon. It was a huge grave cut into</b>
<br><b>the side of a hill. As soon as we approached it, I</b>
<br><b>began to feel uncomfortable. The tour guide told us</b>
<br><b>the history of the place and then said that we could</b>
<br><b>go inside if we wanted. I knew that there was no way</b>
<br><b>that I could do that. Even as the guide had been</b>
<br><b>talking, my feeling became stronger. It is so hard to</b>
<br><b>describe. I think of the words dread, unwelcome, etc.</b>
<br><b>The atmosphere was just suffocating. No one else</b>
<br><b>seemed to notice anything, so I just moved as far away</b>
<br><b>as I could and tried to focus on the beautiful scenery</b>
<br><b>around me. Even with my back to the tomb, I still felt</b>
<br><b>the pressure, and it was getting worse. I was really</b>
<br><b>beginning to panic and all I wanted was to get away. I</b>
<br><b>sank to the ground, pulled my knees to my chest, shut</b>
<br><b>my eyes and tried to tune out whatever was happening.</b>
<br><b>I don't know for how long, but I stayed like that</b>
<br><b>until one of my teachers came to check on me. I was so</b>
<br><b>turned into myself that I hadn't noticed him coming up</b>
<br><b>behind me, and I jumped, startling us both. When he</b>
<br><b>asked me what was wrong, I was too upset to really</b>
<br><b>explain, plus I wasn't sure how. I just kept repeating</b>
<br><b>that it was the place. He told me not to worry because</b>
<br><b>we were leaving soon, and then our other chaperone</b>
<br><b>walked me back to the bus. I will always be grateful</b>
<br><b>to them both for being so calm when I was practically</b>
<br><b>hysterical with fear. As soon as we departed from the</b>
<br><b>place, I was fine. I wish that I could say that it was</b>
<br><b>knowning that I was visiting a tomb that upset me so,</b>
<br><b>but I have been to other such places and have been</b>
<br><b>perfectly allright. Now, I am embarrassed by my</b>
<br><b>reaction, but this was the first time that I has ever</b>
<br><b>felt something this powerful. I am not sure if it was</b>
<br><b>a spirit, or if an event of the past had merely left</b>
<br><b>its imprint in the atmosphere.</b>

<br><b>Information of a Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Paul.Hannah2@btinternet.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I was hoping you could take some time to give me</b>
<br><b>some information about a possible haunting I may be</b>
<br><b>experiencing.</b>
<br><b>It started about four days ago when I woke up at about</b>
<br><b>3:00am.&nbsp; I felt that there was a women standing on the</b>
<br><b>landing watching me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The next night I heard someone whisper my name.</b>
<br><b>Directly after the whisper my cat hissed and ran out of</b>
<br><b>my house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The night after that I was sitting on my chair and went</b>
<br><b>to pick up my lighter to have a cigerette and I found my</b>
<br><b>lighter to be missing.&nbsp; I stood up and look on my chair ,</b>
<br><b>but it was not there.&nbsp; I turned around for about five</b>
<br><b>seconds then turned back to find the lighter directly in</b>
<br><b>the middle of the chair.</b>
<br><b>Last night I went to bed thinking that I had no unusual</b>
<br><b>happenings for the first time for a few nights.&nbsp; When I</b>
<br><b>awoke in the morning something did'nt feel right.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>looked at my hand and saw all of my rings were gone.</b>
<br><b>I looked on the bed side cabinate and found them</b>
<br><b>neatly placed there. There is no way I would have taken</b>
<br><b>them off in the night as one of the rings will only come</b>
<br><b>of with great force.</b>
<br><b>I have found out today that my father in laws blood</b>
<br><b>pressure is up again for the first time after his heart</b>
<br><b>attack last year.&nbsp; I thought that maby his father, who</b>
<br><b>past away last year, may be trying to let me know that</b>
<br><b>something was wrong.&nbsp; He was a pratical joker who</b>
<br><b>would have found it very funny when hidding a lighter or</b>
<br><b>removing rings.</b>

<br><b>Summer Break</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Achernar0462@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi.&nbsp; My name is Ashley.&nbsp; About 3 years ago, over summer
break, I was laying</b>
<br><b>in my room listening to music and writing in my journal.&nbsp; It
was about 2:45</b>
<br><b>am and I was getting ready to call my boyfriend when I heard a tapping
on the</b>
<br><b>window. And since it was summer, my curtains were open.&nbsp; and
when I look</b>
<br><b>over, this glowing hammer shaped thing was tapping on my window.&nbsp;
So I</b>
<br><b>half-scream/half gasp.&nbsp; And ran out of my room into my older
brothers room</b>
<br><b>who was in the room next to mine. I wake him up and tell him what
was going</b>
<br><b>on.&nbsp; He called me a Drama Queen and told me to get out of his
room.&nbsp; So I sat</b>
<br><b>in the kitchen for a while, then I decide to go look in my room.
When I get</b>
<br><b>to my door, I stop because I hear a "clown laugh"&nbsp; And me being
deathly</b>
<br><b>scared of clowns, I freak out and go sit on my parents floor.&nbsp;
Then about 15</b>
<br><b>minutes later, I go back in my room and a tall figure walked past
my window.</b>
<br><b>I don't really remember what happened after that.&nbsp; But the
next day I woke up</b>
<br><b>on my Mom and dad's floor. So I call my best friend to come over
and we were</b>
<br><b>checking out my room.&nbsp; and by my window, my Mom had grew some
plants or</b>
<br><b>something and they were bent down like someone had stepped on them.&nbsp;
and then</b>
<br><b>over by my brothers window was a really big foot print that didn't
match</b>
<br><b>anyone in my family's shoe</b>

<p><b>I Have a Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: OO7MoonDancer@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Lauren and I live in Louisville, KY, and my house is haunted.
It</b>
<br><b>all started when we bought the house. The couple we bought it from
wouldn't</b>
<br><b>let us view what was in the shed or let us see in the fridge. They
seemed</b>
<br><b>like extremely strange people. Within a week of our moving the girl
of the</b>
<br><b>couple was in a horrible accident, leaving her in a full body cast.
They man</b>
<br><b>was never to be heard from. They left all their clothes and some
belongings</b>
<br><b>here. A couple months later, our dog was digging under the shed
and found</b>
<br><b>large bones. We concluded it was either from a large animal or even
a person.</b>
<br><b>We didn't think much of it till one night I rented some scary movies
and my</b>
<br><b>friends and I decided to do a sayonce (spelling)? The next day,
all out door</b>
<br><b>knobs broke. And my door to my room even fell off. Then slowly all
our doors</b>
<br><b>stopped working. Most of them either can't be shut all the way,
locked all</b>
<br><b>the way, or don't have a door knob. Then a couple months later,
all the</b>
<br><b>phones broke. I'd say within a year we go through 10 phones. All
breaking and</b>
<br><b>no apparent reason why. Then one night it all made sense. A couple
of my</b>
<br><b>girlfriends and I were laying around watching movies that night.
We decided</b>
<br><b>to go to sleep, so my friend and I laid down on the floor facing
the hall</b>
<br><b>way. (Note: We live in a shotgun house so by sitting in the living
room you</b>
<br><b>can see all the way down the hall.) There was a storm that night
and when it</b>
<br><b>lightening it lights up the hall way. OK, so we were laying there,
and it</b>
<br><b>lightening and we both saw this tall man standing at the end of
the hall way.</b>
<br><b>He was tall and was largely built. No one else saw him that night.
I told a</b>
<br><b>couple of people about it and told them if they see him let me know.
The next</b>
<br><b>sighting was by my friend Josh. I was walking towards my room (which
is where</b>
<br><b>we saw the ghost) and he said he saw someone following me so he
went to see</b>
<br><b>who it was and when I turned around to talk to him, Josh said that
person was</b>
<br><b>gone. Everyone who has stayed in my house has their own little story
from</b>
<br><b>"him" handing my friend a pillow to helping another friend from
falling off</b>
<br><b>the couch and hitting her head. He makes out garage door mess up
and once he</b>
<br><b>even finished off some cokes we left on the table. I could go on
forever with</b>
<br><b>little stories. I just wanted to share my own little ghost story
with you. We</b>
<br><b>accept "Little Buddy" which is the nickname we gave our ghost to
make him</b>
<br><b>seems less "scary". He just freaks us out some times. Thanks for
letting me</b>
<br><b>share my story.</b><b></b>

<br><b>and my family have heard closet doors open and slam shut. but whats
so funny</b>
<br><b>is that my family hears the things as well as i do , but ive seen
white</b>
<br><b>apparations that kind of dance some what around me. i was frightened
at</b>
<br><b>first. i dont see them to where i can stare at them . its very quick.
i see</b>
<br><b>them out the corner of my eyes. or some times&nbsp; i will scan
a room and see</b>
<br><b>something, but wont realize it until ive taken my eyes off of it,
and its</b>

ago. i</b>
<br><b>woke up out of my sleep and was able to see but was unable&nbsp;
to move, speak,</b>
<br><b>and could hardly breathe. it was very frightening and still is to
that</b>
<br><b>matter. since then it has happened maybe a total of 7 or 8 times.
once when i</b>
<br><b>went on a trip to see my ex-boyfriend in new jersey. i thought i
was being</b>
<br><b>possesed. i dont even know if thats what it was. im scared to walk
in the</b>
<br><b>dark at my house. and i shouldnt have to be. these have increased
some what</b>
<br><b>more in the past year or so. but i havnt had an "episode" recently.
the last</b>
<br><b>one i could say was about 3 or 4 months ago. at one point i was
sooo scared</b>
<br><b>that i was sleeping with my bible. i believe in god, and have faith
in him.</b>
<br><b>it like this ghost or ghosts follow me. my last apparation was maybe
4 days</b>
<br><b>ago. i have asked if they wanted something from me. they dont show
themselves</b>
<br><b>to me when i ask.&nbsp; i just want help as to how to deal with

<p><b>Hotel Tower</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Patricia_San_Martin@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>When I first arrived to Florida, I worked in the well known hotel
that is</b>
<br><b>known to be haunted. This hotel during the war was a hospital which
had a</b>
<br><b>morgue and a psychiatric ward. Well, I use to work in the food and
beverage</b>
<br><b>dept. of this hotel and one day at work I had to deliver an amenity
to a</b>
<br><b>guest who was staying in a special suite. To get to this particular
suite</b>
<br><b>you had to take the stairs&nbsp; because there was no elevator that
went to that</b>
<br><b>floor. (I am going to describe the stairway to you: it took like
those</b>
<br><b>stairway that lead to the dunges in those Robin Hood type movies.)
When I</b>
<br><b>started going up the stairway I was a little scared because of the
way that</b>
<br><b>it look but I thought everything is going to be o.k. just go deliver
the</b>
<br><b>stuff and get back to the kitchen asap. Well, I dropped off the
amenity and</b>
<br><b>on my way down I felt something real weird but I tried to brush
it off. When</b>
<br><b>I got to the end of the stairs I could not open the door, mind you
the door</b>
<br><b>was not locked because I was able to move the knob. It felt like
if someone</b>
<br><b>was holding the door close on the other side. I was pushing the
door but it</b>
<br><b>wouldn't open up. I remember my aunt telling me once that if you
insult the</b>
<br><b>spirit by use the God's name that it will disappear because he is
scared of</b>
<br><b>God. So me being the Latina that I am I started insulting it in
Spanish and</b>
<br><b>in English (in case the ghost was bilingual!). At first it didn't
work but</b>
<br><b>as soon as I started saying that God is going to be anger the door
flew</b>
<br><b>open. I got out of the stairway quickly to see if maybe one of the
guys that</b>
<br><b>I work with were paying a trick on me but I soon realize that there
was no</b>
<br><b>one around. The distance between where I was standing and to the
service</b>
<br><b>elevator was about 1 block away so I know that I would have seen
someone if</b>
<br><b>that was the case and there are no little hallways that they could
have hide</b>
<br><b>in so I know that what I had just experience was real. I ran to
the service</b>
<br><b>elevator and headed back to the kitchen. I never went back to the
tower and</b>
<br><b>I tried to always have someone with me when I had to walk the floors.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Paranormal Events</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: AWindansr@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I've visited here many times.&nbsp; I have had "paranormal" events
happen many</b>
<br><b>times in my life.&nbsp; I have always been open minded, but the
one outstanding</b>
<br><b>witnessed event was when my Grandma in Texas died.&nbsp; I live
in Calif. but</b>
<br><b>went with my dad and brought my 18 month old son, because she was
dying, after a</b>
<br><b>long battle with cancer.&nbsp; I was her favorite grandchild and
she asked to see</b>
<br><b>her great grandson, by the time my dad and I arrived, she had slipped
into a</b>
<br><b>coma.&nbsp; She was home having hospice care, my Grandpa, aunt and
cousin were</b>
<br><b>with her.&nbsp; Having a nursing background I had intended to ease
her death and</b>
<br><b>see her once more.&nbsp; When we were picked up at the airport in
Texas, my aunt</b>
<br><b>said that my Grandma had been in a coma for at least 24 hours.&nbsp;
They thought we wouldn't make it to see her. This is what happened when
I got to the house.&nbsp; My grandpa was sitting in</b>
<br><b>The room talking to her, we always believe that our words could
reach her.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>picked up my son, and hugged him.&nbsp; My son, wanted to see his
"Amma", I went</b>
<br><b>in first, I was worried that the sight of her, hairless and so frail,
would</b>
<br><b>scare him.&nbsp; Then my son followed me, and ran up to her side
of the bed.</b>
<br><b>"Amma, Amma" he said.&nbsp; She opened her eyes and actually sat
up with her arms</b>
<br><b>open and hugged him and said</b>
<br><b>"Oh I love you".&nbsp; It was momentary, it was unexpected.&nbsp;
For the next few</b>
<br><b>days she was in and out of the coma-like condition.&nbsp; Every
morning my son would</b>
<br><b>run in and call her, "Amma, Amma", when she could swallow I fed
her, when she couldn't</b>
<br><b>I crushed her meds up and found "other" ways to keep her out of
pain.</b>
<br><b>For five days, we talked to her, we read to her, we talked around
her...we</b>
<br><b>used a baby monitor to hear what was happening in the room where
she slept.</b>
<br><b>The night of the fifth day, I could hear the "gurgling" sound, I
used the patch hopice</b>
<br><b>had left to dry up the secretions so the rest of my family couldn't
hear.&nbsp; For the last</b>
<br><b>two days her temp soared to 106 or more, her body could no longer
control</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; I told my family that the time was soon.&nbsp; We all
would take turns telling</b>
<br><b>her that it was okay to let go, that we would take care of each
other,</b>
<br><b>especially grandpa.&nbsp; We urged her on the fifth day to go where
there was no</b>
<br><b>more pain, to go where there was light not dark, to go yet be with
us</b>
<br><b>always.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;That night, she died.</b>
<br><b>I knew her time was immediate, I sent my grandpa in to be with her.&nbsp;
My dad,</b>
<br><b>myself, my aunt and my cousin were out on the patio (facing the
living room</b>
<br><b>into the house), the door was open and we were listening to the
moniter as</b>
<br><b>my grandpa told her it was okay and loving led her to freedom.&nbsp;
My son, slept</b>
<br><b>in the room across the hall.&nbsp; We all heard my grandpa say,
she's gone.&nbsp; We sat</b>
<br><b>there in grief but belief that she was in a better place.&nbsp;
We didn't speak</b>
<br><b>but stared into the house.&nbsp; As we watched in silence, a bright
glowing ball</b>
<br><b>of light out from the hallway where my son slept and thru the livingroom
as</b>
<br><b>we watched in awe, it was about shoulder height if you were standing
in the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; Then it swept between my father and I, it was like
seeing the</b>
<br><b>essence of Tinkerbell, but when it flew by or thru us we felt a
warmth, a peace an</b>
<br><b>overwhelming love.&nbsp; We all said, did you see that, feel that.&nbsp;
I knew</b>
<br><b>instantly who it was.&nbsp; I checked on my son, who was sleeping
with such a</b>
<br><b>sweet smile.&nbsp; The next morning he ran into see her...."Amma,
Amma" and saw</b>
<br><b>that the bed was empty and the linen was gone.&nbsp; I told him
that Amma flew</b>
<br><b>with the angels and wouldn't be sick anymore.</b>
<br><b>There was discussion between my cousin, aunt and I, my dad never
believed</b>
<br><b>before.</b>
<br><b>It took him a whole year before he brought it up.&nbsp; He now believes.</b>
<br><b>There have been other events, but non so touching and moving and
peacefully</b>
<br><b>awesome as this one.</b>
<br><b>So, I started to tell you how much I love your new "look" on the
website and</b>
<br><b>ended up sharing a wonderful secret.&nbsp; I DO love your site,
I DO believe.</b>
<br><b>Thank you for listening, thank you for offering this kind of information
on</b>
<br><b>your site.</b>
<br><b>Perhaps more will become believers. Perhaps more will recognize
events in</b>
<br><b>their lives with the basis you have offered them.</b>

<p><b>Heres A Story For you!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: vipergirl_16@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It all started in August of 2000,
our parents were gone away on a vaction and we were home alone.&nbsp; It
was around 3 o'clock in the morning and we were sitting in our room just
talking before we went to bed just like we do every night, and we started
to hear something playing with our basement door.&nbsp; All of a sudden
the door started to shake.&nbsp; We didn't think anything of it.&nbsp;
So then a few days later, this cop came to our door, I know that doesn't
sound weird but it was 1 o'clock in the morning she asked for some Chad
guy.&nbsp; Ashleigh answered the door and said that there wasn't anyone
here by that name and she was like are you sure, because he is involved
in a murder.&nbsp; Well the next day Ashleigh went to one of her friends
who knew the people that lived here and she said there was never anyone
here named Chad that she remembers living here.&nbsp; Then a week after
the first time, we heard the door shaking again, but this time we were
on the computer.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden our music in the basement turned
on and really really loud, then it just stopped.&nbsp; Then we heard books
fall on the floor up stairs, and our parents door slam.&nbsp; The same
night the phone rang and the person on the other end of the phone was only
breathing heavily and then hung up.&nbsp; That happened 2 or 3 times that
night.&nbsp; All of this happened for the rest of the summer, and then
stopped.&nbsp; We are just waiting to see what happens this summer, we'll
keep you posted.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Here is my true story!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: palazzo6@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi my name is Tony , I live in&nbsp; Connecticut.
I lived in a haunted house,&nbsp;&nbsp; when I was 8 years old My father
baught the house from a woman. She was about 55 yrs. old. Her and her husband
lived in the house alone for 22 years. When we first talked to Mrs. Starace
she said her husband comes to her every night and stands at the foot of
her bed. We were like yeah ...ok! We payed no attention to it. The very
night we moved in we went out for fast food. We came back home and different
lights were turned on than the ones we left on. We payed no attention to
it again. 3 nights later I fell asleep in the tv room, my mother brought
me upstairs to the refinished attick, this was my room, this is where her
husband died. I was awake at the time she layed me on my bed. Then the
door slammed behind her and it was pitch black. Pitch black and 8 years
old don't mix so I froze. Then there was a very loud bang. I flew up out
of bed and broke through the child protecting stair gate and went straight
into my parents room. Guess what...my parents were sleeping, it wasn't
my mother who brought me upstairs.&nbsp; My father went upstairs after
i woke him up and found a picture of my family that WAS downstairs, in
the middle of my floor face down with no broken glass. Now my father is
getting pissed. Another night the three of us were sleeping in the tv room.
I woke up and playboy was on tv. So i started watching it. Come on I was
eight. Anyway as i'm watching it and a shadow walks ok? walks into the
doorway and stands there. It was tall and black with no hands and no feet
with overalls and a hat. I woke my mother up and she freaked out. It just
stood there with no movement at all. She covered me up for like 30 seconds
or so crying and then it wasn't there anymore. I know man i still get chills
too and i had to live through it. There were so many things that happened
but it would take me 4 ever to tell you everything. The last night we were
in the house me, my father, my mother and her sister were in the kitchen.
My mother's back was facing the stove which had cabinets above it. I was
playing with my Sweet Pickles animal cards on the floor. All of a sudden
the cabbinet above the stove opened and a cup that had pens, pencils, rulers
etc. fell over and a pair of scissors flew out of the cup and landed in
the back of her chair and stuck there. That takes some power. We moved
out the next day and guess who bought the house.... She said "I guess he
just doesn't want me to go." This is a 100% true story no lies. I just
wanted to share it with you.</b>

out,</b>
<br><b>she jumped into my hatch back looked out the window, just growling

<p><b>Haunting Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lisaderwin@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My name is Lisa and I am a young professional living in Boston, Mass.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>moved into my apartment in September and immediately felt uncomfortable</b>
<br><b>whenever I was in the bathroom, especially when I had my back to
the door or</b>
<br><b>my eyes closed.&nbsp; I just felt as if there was someone standing
behind me in</b>
<br><b>the doorway.&nbsp; However, I just ignored this feeling.</b>
<br><b>This past weekend my boyfriend was sleeping over and he had a series
of</b>
<br><b>disturbing dreams.&nbsp; At one point he woke up shouting "he's
dead!"&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>startled, but soon went back to sleep.&nbsp; In the morning he said
that in one</b>
<br><b>dream he was being beaten violently by a ghost.&nbsp; This was all
he said at the</b>
<br><b>time, but was pretty shaken up by it for the rest of the day.&nbsp;
Then, just</b>
<br><b>last night i felt a strong presence when i was brushing my teeth
and washing</b>
<br><b>up in the bathroom.&nbsp; I had difficulty falling asleep because
the side of my</b>
<br><b>face itched, as if someone was breathing on it.&nbsp; (also, my
two kittens who</b>
<br><b>usually sleep with me would not come into the bed).&nbsp; Finally
i spoke to the</b>
<br><b>presence firmly, saying "please get out of my room so my kittens
will come</b>
<br><b>to bed."&nbsp; At that moment I felt the presence leave and my kittens
jumped</b>
<br><b>into bed (without any signal from me).&nbsp; When I told my boyfriend
about my</b>
<br><b>experience, I described the presence as an older man, unfriendly
but not</b>
<br><b>really scary.&nbsp; He reminded me of his dream, and agreed that
the ghost was an</b>
<br><b>older male.&nbsp; He said "it started with me standing up from the
bed and</b>
<br><b>blocking shots from the ghost.&nbsp; Then he knocked me down into
the corner of</b>
<br><b>the room by the closet, he had me trapped there and just kept hitting
me."</b>
<br><b>It just seems all too coincidental and all too invasive to ignore
any longer</b>

<br><b>Many Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By; Unknown</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been so many experiences
that I really don't know where to start.I have tried to explain them away
but it seems that I cannot find reasons for all of them.I guess I will
start with the first time I seen something.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1972 my brother got a ouija
board for his birthday.We invited a friend and went to the basement to
try it out.We lit candles and sat around the board and started asking questions.The
pointer moved easily and we had great fun using the board.We "talked" to
a spirit of a man hanged for killing his wife.He told us that I looked
like his wife and I thought that it was "cool".We took turns asking questions
and at one point I looked up from the board and saw a shadow of a man standing
by the stairway.I pointed and my brother saw it too.We blew out the candles
and ran upstairs.Soon after I started feeling something "sit" on my bed
at night.I would look up thinking it was my mother and nobody would be
there.I thought I was crazy so I invited a friend to spend the night and
she felt it too.We never saw anyone or anything but the bed would have
an indentation as if someone was sitting on it.This lasted until 1974 when
I got married.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One time I was doing the laundry
and I heard my named called.I was home alone.Another time I was doing laundry
and something patted my back several times.My children were all in the
livingroom watching tv.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last few years we have seen
"shadows".Vague outlines of a man in our kitchen and diningroom.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years there have been many
times when things would be moved from the spot it was placed.Things would
fall on the floor when no one was near them.Our front door will open on
its own,no one near it and no wind blowing.The bathroom door will creek
open and then closed.I have heard someone call my name when I am the only
one home.I have been "touched" when I am the only one home.My daughter
has heard and felt the same things.She has been upstairs alone and called
down asking me what I wanted and I didn't call her.My husband and I will
be sitting on the couch and suddenly we both are cold and shivering while
our children are on the other side of the same room are warm,or they will
be cold and we will be fine.All of us have seen shadows where there shouldn't
be any.Our cat chases unseen things and meows at nothing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the hoilday season (Thanksgiving
through New Years) these strange things happen most often.</b>

<p><b>Grandmas Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tammystreasures@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Okay I feel a ltttle odd writing about this but I am curious!</b>
<br><b>My grandmother passed away about 21 years ago. Since</b>
<br><b>about a week after her death I have felt and even seen</b>
<br><b>strange things that I have come to call Grandma's ghost.</b>
<br><b>The first experience was seeing her in the kitchen, sort of</b>
<br><b>out of the corner of my eye. I really only see her as if she has</b>
<br><b>walked by, I see the side or back of her head or polka dot dress.</b>
<br><b>Usually when I see this I also feel sort of a wind go past me.</b>
<br><b>There have been times that I have gone past the bathroom and</b>
<br><b>found the faucet running in the bathroom.(At first, in the house</b>
<br><b>we lived in when she passed away) I would shut it off and leave</b>
<br><b>the room, the next time I'd go by I'd find it on again. This happened</b>
<br><b>quite a few times. Finally, I said okay Grandma stop turning the</b>
<br><b>water on please...it stopped!</b>
<br><b>We moved to another house about 9 years ago, I still see her and</b>
<br><b>feel her usually in the basement (where I keep her china cabinet</b>
<br><b>and china as she left it) though the water incident has only happened</b>
<br><b>once here while I was in the shower. I turned it off and it stayed
off.</b>
<br><b>Once while watching t.v. I seen her out of the corner of my eye
in</b>
<br><b>the dining room in the polka dot dress. No one else did and there
were</b>
<br><b>three others there.</b>
<br><b>Recently my husband has been working in the basement or on the</b>
<br><b>computer and says that he feels like someone is watching him. I
asked</b>
<br><b>if he has felt something cold around him. He says he has...I then
told him</b>
<br><b>possibly next he will feel his hair move as I have twice. He is
very uncom-</b>
<br><b>fortable with that. I tell him it's okay it's only Grandma but I
guess since</b>
<br><b>he never met her it scares him...I'm not frightened because I am
convinced that</b>
<br><b>it is my beloved grandma...but how can I be sure!!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghost in the Mirror</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Canolinda@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>when my son was 9, his aunt and uncle were expecting a baby. they
were</b>
<br><b>preparing a room in the upstairs of their home as a nursery. my
son was upset</b>
<br><b>about them putting the baby in that room. when i asked him why,
he said, "</b>
<br><b>because there are people in the mirror"! I asked him to tell me
about it. He</b>
<br><b>said that when he and his dad were taking a nap one day in that
room,{his dad</b>
<br><b>died when he was 5,} he sat up and he saw 2 people looking at him
from the</b>
<br><b>mirror and other people in the background standing around looking
like they</b>
<br><b>were talking to each other. well, naturally i got chills but i asked
him to</b>
<br><b>describe the 2 people looking at him. he said that there was a pretty
lady</b>
<br><b>with long dark hair and an old man who wore glasses and was bald,
then he</b>
<br><b>said "i think there was something wrong with the old mans legs because
he had</b>
<br><b>wooden shoes" His aunt died 4-5 years before he was born and she
had long</b>
<br><b>dark hair. His great grandfather died 10 or more years before that
and he</b>
<br><b>knew nothing about him. he had desribed both of them . his grandfather
had</b>
<br><b>his legs amputated due to diabetes and had wooden legs! He also
told me that</b>
<br><b>the fire in the fireplace was on in the mirror but there was no
fire in the</b>
<br><b>fireplace in the room. I asked him what he did when he saw that
and he said"</b>
<br><b>i didnt do anything, i just went back to sleep with dad"!&nbsp;
I believe my son</b>
<br><b>had a visitation by dead relatives . he said he wasnt scared but
hasnt had</b>
<br><b>any more experiences like that. what do you think?&nbsp; im wondering
if his aunt</b>
<br><b>and uncle were not planning to put their baby in that room, he might
not</b>
<br><b>never have told me, but he didnt want the mirror to scare the baby.
I told</b>
<br><b>his uncle about my son's experience and he told me it was bull----.
But he</b>

<p><b>Ghostly Touches</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: BCOADY4412@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Seems like everybody has a ghost story.&nbsp; Here is mine, and who
knows how its</b>
<br><b>going to end up?&nbsp; (we still live here)</b>
<br><b>My husband and I bought our first townhouse 2 years ago.&nbsp; It
is actually #13</b>
<br><b>who knows if that has anything to do with it.&nbsp; Things started
as I noticed</b>
<br><b>when I was up alone at night I would feel a heavy presence.&nbsp;
It was like</b>
<br><b>someone was standing right behind me staring at the back of my head.&nbsp;
Made</b>
<br><b>the hair on my neck stand up.&nbsp; Generally I would run upstairs
and bolt into</b>
<br><b>the bedroom and hide under the covers.&nbsp; I didn't tell my husband
about it</b>
<br><b>because I felt it was the product of an overactive imagination.&nbsp;
So every now</b>
<br><b>and then I'd get this feeling and it did feel like the thing chased
me too</b>
<br><b>when I ran up the stairs.&nbsp; I chuckled to myself in the morning
on what an</b>
<br><b>idiot I was.</b>
<br><b>Then I felt something touching me at night.&nbsp; Typically, I would
be alone with</b>
<br><b>my husband staying up late downstairs,&nbsp; I would be just falling
off to sleep</b>
<br><b>and I would feel a something rub gently up on my calf.&nbsp; I figured
it was the</b>
<br><b>cat and when I looked, no cat.&nbsp; I thought okay, just the covers
moving or</b>
<br><b>settling.&nbsp; But it happened fairly regularly and it was a significant</b>
<br><b>pressure, I couldn't really explain it off.&nbsp; When it would
happen I would lie</b>
<br><b>still and without looking try to say, okay is this the just covers,
but I</b>
<br><b>wasn't crazy, something was definitely touching me but when I looked
-</b>
<br><b>nothing.</b>
<br><b>Then one day (yes who'd guess, during the day) I was bent over drying
my hair</b>
<br><b>and I was definitely finger poked in the center of my back.&nbsp;
I leaned up and</b>
<br><b>looked behind me to see what my husband wanted, but nobody was there.</b>
<br><b>I haven't really seen anything, the odd thing out of the corner
of your eye,</b>
<br><b>a flash of movement, when I look of course there is nothing there,
so I can't</b>
<br><b>say I've seen anything.&nbsp; As for hearing things, not really.&nbsp;
Sometimes it</b>
<br><b>sounds like movement down our hallway upstairs but nothing significant.</b>
<br><b>The temperature&nbsp; I noticed is odd.&nbsp; The house will be
warm downstairs and</b>
<br><b>frigid upstairs.&nbsp; Or all of a sudden it gets very cold.&nbsp;
So who knows.</b>
<br><b>If there is a ghost here let me be the first to say that I would
die of</b>
<br><b>embarrassment if I knew a person in the spirit was hanging around
watching</b>
<br><b>you and seeing everything about you including the times when you're
a jerk.</b>
<br><b>Of note, though I did not mention this to my Aunt prior to her coming
here to</b>
<br><b>visit the first time, I noticed she kept looking at the stairs and
I would</b>
<br><b>look too.&nbsp; I asked what she was looking at she said nothing
but that she</b>
<br><b>didn't like our stairs and after digging a bit more she confessed
that she</b>
<br><b>didn't like our new place - it scared her, she felt a presence and
especially</b>
<br><b>didn't like the stairs.</b>

<p><b>Collection of Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Moodindig0@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Story #1: The Peppermint Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>Back in 1991, I lived in an old brownstone apartment building in
the South</b>
<br><b>End of Boston. These buildings are usually 100's of years old and
have</b>
<br><b>history attached to them. I was a 21 yr. old girl who was just starting
a</b>
<br><b>career in cosmetology, and had found the apartment through the receptionist</b>
<br><b>who I worked with at the shop, who needed a roommate. The apartment
was huge,</b>
<br><b>at least 4 bedrooms on the bottom floor, and one huge attic room
with a</b>
<br><b>beamed ceiling, which became my area of living. It was a nice, inviting
place</b>
<br><b>that had a benevolent air about it, as if it was just a good place
to be.</b><b></b>
<p><b>One my first night there, my new roommate and I sat on the top of
the stairs</b>
<br><b>that led to my attic room. We are both good hearted people, and
we enjoyed</b>
<br><b>each others company very much as we held a rather nice conversation.
As we</b>
<br><b>were speaking, an overwhelming scent of peppermint surrounded us.
We weren't</b>
<br><b>eating candy, and none of the roommates downstairs were home, so
no candles</b>
<br><b>or incense was lit. Also, we were so high up that no scent from
the</b>
<br><b>apartments below us could emanate through the floors. My roommate,
Faith,</b>
<br><b>smiled and told me it was the ghost. Whatever it was, it decided
to sit right</b>
<br><b>next to me, because to my left side I could smell nothing but peppermint.
In</b>
<br><b>a minute it was gone, but only to move about to sit next to roommate.
The</b>
<br><b>scent was very solid and did not drift about the room, it only stayed
in its</b>
<br><b>own little section, and you could not smell anything else around
it. But when</b>
<br><b>it moved, it was as if a very distinct presence was around you,
wearing a</b>
<br><b>peppermint perfume.</b><b></b>
<p><b>During the time I lived there, The Peppermint Ghost would sneak up
behind me</b>
<br><b>and just hang out for a bit, only to vanish. I got the feeling that
it was a</b>
<br><b>very happy, cheerful personality, and it made my stay enjoyable.</b>
<br><b>Story #2: The Blue Light</b>
<br><b>Sometime in the mid 1990s I was invited to partake in a tour of
an actual</b>
<br><b>haunted house in Weymouth, MA. I went with two friends who fancied
themselves</b>
<br><b>as wiccan, and knowledgeable of the occult. I am an open-minded
person by all</b>
<br><b>means, but also very rational, and will only believe what I see
for myself.</b>
<br><b>So I went to this house with a healthy dose of skepticism.</b>
<br><b>The house was an average house, perhaps built in the 40's or 50's,
inhabited</b>
<br><b>by a father and his 20 yr. old daughter. They were very average
people with</b>
<br><b>no real idiosyncrasies or love of fancy stories. It was a 2 family,
and the</b>
<br><b>supposed hauntings were so bad that they moved all of their belongings
to the</b>
<br><b>top floor, and never went into the bottom floor, which was the epicenter
of</b>
<br><b>the hauntings. They complained of faces coming out at them from
the dark,</b>
<br><b>temperature changes from cold to hot, and the channels on the TV
switching or</b>
<br><b>the screen losing reception. They also complained of a general,
malevolent</b>
<br><b>presence in the house, and also of voices and other unpleasant occurrences.</b>
<br><b>They believed their were multiple ghosts, and most weren't very
nice.</b>
<br><b>Upon entering the house, I did not feel anything out of the ordinary,
except</b>
<br><b>for an unease and tension. My two friends and I went downstairs
to the</b>
<br><b>supposed hotbed of supernatural activity. It was small, cold, and
with no</b>
<br><b>furniture. My friends took it upon themselves to hold a seance in
one of the</b>
<br><b>rooms, so they lit a candle and tried to converse with the spirits
there.</b>
<br><b>They did not get any response, so they started to provoke the spirits
out, by</b>
<br><b>using idle threats and insults. This was no way to talk to anyone,
dead or</b>
<br><b>alive, is what I thought, so I decided to visit another room. The
room I went</b>
<br><b>to was very dark, with the only light source coming from the hall
outside.</b>
<br><b>The only window was small and had a shade pulled down. I did not
feel any bad</b>
<br><b>feelings so far, so I talked out loud to whatever could be in the
room beside</b>
<br><b>myself. I told "it" that I wanted to know if it was there, and that
I would</b>
<br><b>not hurt it, that I just wanted to know if it was really there.
Suddenly in</b>
<br><b>came a small, bright, clear blue light, that shined itself on the
wall in</b>
<br><b>front of me. Curious, I looked around for an obvious light source
it could</b>
<br><b>logically come from, but I couldn't. I was moving about a bit and
had on many</b>
<br><b>silver rings, and noticed that the light on the wall followed exactly
the</b>
<br><b>movements of my hands, as if the hall light shined onto my rings
and casted a</b>
<br><b>reflection. I could not explain why it was such a vibrant blue in
this dark</b>
<br><b>room, but I moved my hands more and watched the light follow. Satisfied
that</b>
<br><b>it was just a reflection, I dropped my hands still by my sides,
only to see</b>
<br><b>the blue light grow more animated on the wall. It almost danced
there, flying</b>
<br><b>about in circles of increasing speed. Excited, I tried to call my
friends in</b>
<br><b>too see it, but once they came in, the blue light vanished.</b>
<br><b>To me, the blue light reminded me of a mischievous boy, not anything
evil or</b>
<br><b>mean. To those reading this story, I offer some advice...don't do
a seance</b>
<br><b>unless you are very experienced, and do not treat spirits with disrespect.</b>
<br><b>After all, they are people who have merely passed on to another
plane. And if</b>
<br><b>what you are dealing with has bad intentions, disrespect will only
irritate</b>
<br><b>them further.</b><b></b>

<br><b>England</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: citytillidie43@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi i'm from the north west of England and I would like to share my</b>
<br><b>experiences. It first started when I was about 10 years old maybe
younger.</b>
<br><b>My granddad would come round to baby-sit when my mum and dad went
out. I</b>
<br><b>would go into the kitchen to get something to eat and I would notice
in the</b>
<br><b>corner of my eye someone stood on the stairs watching me. I was
not the only</b>
<br><b>person who noticed this happening as my cousin noticed someone stood
near</b>
<br><b>her in the back room. Then when I was about 11-12 I noticed in my
back room</b>
<br><b>one day someone was sat next to me on my bed. When I looked in the
corner of</b>
<br><b>my eye I noticed it was a woman wearing a a red jumper and black
leggings.</b>
<br><b>When I described her to my mum she could not believe it as the woman</b>
<br><b>described was her mum (my nanna) who died when my mum was 10 years
old.&nbsp; Now</b>
<br><b>some times when I dream of her,and in my dreams I talk to her.</b>
<br><b>My most scary excperince was last year. I suffer from astma, and
one day I</b>
<br><b>had a really bad cold which spred to my chest and made my breathing
bad. I</b>
<br><b>was in bed fast a sleep about 12.30am I suddenly woke up. As I sat
up I</b>
<br><b>looked in the corner of my room near the window and I saw what it
looked</b>
<br><b>like a person stood there in a black figure. I lay back down a bit
scared</b>
<br><b>but felling I could not be bothered with it and put my quilt over
my head.</b>
<br><b>As I started to fall back a sleep my breathing started to slow down
as I was</b>
<br><b>ill. All of a sudden it felt like the person stood watching me lay
on top of</b>
<br><b>me and started to go through me. It made me open my eyes wide and
let out a</b>
<br><b>big scream. My mum was down staris at the time and didn't hear a
thing. When</b>
<br><b>i discussed with her she said it could of been my nanna trying to
keep me a</b>
<br><b>wake before I fell into a deep sleep and stop breathing. This is
what I now</b>
<br><b>belive which makes me not scared any more.</b>
<br><b>What is also weired when i go to peoples house I can tell if people
have</b>
<br><b>ghost because of the feelings I get. I know I'm not daft as I can
describe</b>
<br><b>ghost that people have already seen in there homes.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My family and I had been out to a restaurant in the city (Melbourne,</b>
<br><b>Australia). On the way home we went down a deserted, back street
in the</b>
<br><b>suburb of Brooklyn. As we were driving, we noticed an elderly lady
in</b>
<br><b>the gutter with her arm raised as though she needed assistance.
We drove</b>
<br><b>past about 10 meters (30 feet) and suddenly stopped in order to
offer</b>
<br><b>help. Upon reaching the exact spot of seeing the lady, she had vanished.</b>
<br><b>We drove around the area for about 10 minutes with finding her.
No</b>
<br><b>elderly person could have possibly moved that fast from a lying
down</b>
<br><b>position. In addition, 6 people could not have imagined the same</b>
<br><b>apparition. Totally freaked out, we speed home. Upon talking to
a friend</b>
<br><b>who is a resident of the street, we were informed that that particular</b>
<br><b>area is predominantly senior citizens, with ambulances constantly</b>
<br><b>collecting elderly people who have died in their homes.</b>
