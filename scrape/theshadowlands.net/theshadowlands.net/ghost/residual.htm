<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">Do you see the same apparition doing the same
things all the time?&nbsp; Do you hear the same noises, possibly at the
same time of day, each time they are heard?&nbsp; Does that ghost seem
to not even realize that you are there?&nbsp; If the answer is yes to any
of these, you may be witnessing what is known as a residual haunting.&nbsp;
Some of the most famous hauntings appear to be residual ones.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">A residual haunting is a playback of a past
event.&nbsp; The apparitions involved are not spirits, they are "recordings"
of the event.&nbsp; I believe that this will be the first type of haunting
that main stream researchers will recognize and study.&nbsp; There are
numerous theories on how these residual hauntings come to be.&nbsp; The
main one will be discussed here.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">Video and audio tapes capture sounds and images
on a film of special material that has been oxidized or rusted.&nbsp; Certain
building materials, such as slate used in older castles and stone structures
and iron nails used in many older buildings, have properties similar to
that of the tapes.&nbsp; When a traumatic event occurs or a time of heightened
emotions, these materials record the event for future playback.&nbsp; Everything
is made up of energy and energy cannot be destroyed.&nbsp; The materials
store the energy created by these traumatic events and plays them back
at a later time.&nbsp; The Tower of London's ghost of Anne Boleyn and the
Brown Lady of Raynham Hall are two famous examples of residual hauntings.&nbsp;
We are not sure what causes the playback of the events, that still remains
a mystery.&nbsp; Is it the right weather conditions, the witness's energy
or sensitivity or some type of energy release?&nbsp; That is the question
that we as researchers are trying to answer.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">As I said, in a residual haunting, there is
no spirit involved.&nbsp; This type of event is not dangerous at all so
if you ever have the chance to witness one, do so without fear and enjoy
it. This type of haunting has to be considered when investigating a haunting.&nbsp;
When my group goes to a haunted location, we spend the first hour split
into two teams.&nbsp; One team maps out the area, noting any EMF readings
and Temperature readings so we have guidelines to judge other readings
by.&nbsp; We also make note of how the building is constructed and set
up.&nbsp; The other team is conducting interviews with witnesses.&nbsp;
The questions are setup to find out if the activity sounds like a spirit,
poltergeist, residual haunting, etc.&nbsp; If we feel the activity is a
residual haunting we will set up a stakeout in the location the ghost is
often seen or heard.&nbsp; This is the best way to observe and possibly
capture evidence of the event.&nbsp; It may take many return trips and
hours of sitting there staring at nothing.&nbsp; It is very tedious but
if it something occurs, you will forget very quickly about all the time
you sat waiting for it to happen.</font></b>
