<b><font size=+1>Here is What I Went Through</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>February, 2000.&nbsp; .&nbsp; I'm a 43 year old caucasian male,</b>
<br><b>married over 12 years and I have 2 children.&nbsp; I have a college
degree, work</b>
<br><b>as a professional and have no particular religious beliefs.&nbsp;
My only</b>
<br><b>experience with "ghosts" or entities (I don't know what the heck
it was)</b>
<br><b>happened to me over a period of about 10 months while living in
New</b>
<br><b>Hampshire... about 3 years ago.&nbsp; I had purchased a large, 2
story, 10 room</b>
<br><b>farm house which needed extensive repair.&nbsp; Before we moved
in, each night</b>
<br><b>after I got off of work,&nbsp; I would spend several hours painting,
wall papering</b>
<br><b>and performing the needed repairs.&nbsp; My first experience was
this:&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>painting in a closet.&nbsp; There was no one else in the building.&nbsp;
I was just</b>
<br><b>doing my thing, when I heard one distinct "bong".&nbsp; It was the
exact sound</b>
<br><b>that an older mantel clock would make.&nbsp; I looked at my watch...
it was 1</b>
<br><b>o'clock.&nbsp; (...like most people, I know what it sounds like
when I hear song</b>
<br><b>refrains running through my mind... as generated by my mind.&nbsp;
I've also</b>
<br><b>experienced "dead ear"... where one ear will suddenly go deaf with
a loud</b>
<br><b>ringing sound... which fades away after a few minutes... these sounds
are</b>
<br><b>internal, again; generated by my mind and are familiar to me.&nbsp;
This "bong"</b>
<br><b>was EXTERNAL and was NOT generated by my mind.)&nbsp; I KNEW that
the house was</b>
<br><b>completely empty of furniture... I had carted all the rubbish to
the dump</b>
<br><b>myself.&nbsp; I continued to paint and soon after, ended my night's
work at the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; The next evening I was again painting in a closet,
when I heard what</b>
<br><b>could best be described as an old fashioned, electric door bell...
the kind</b>
<br><b>with a hammer that quickly strikes at the bell continuously until
the button</b>
<br><b>is released.&nbsp; I looked at my watch... it was 1 o'clock again.&nbsp;
I put down my</b>
<br><b>brush, stood up and made a thorough search of the house for doorbells
(I had</b>
<br><b>never looked for a doorbell until this point).&nbsp; I also searched
the basement</b>
<br><b>around the furnace, thinking it might have been an alarm bell or
some such...</b>
<br><b>but my search turned up neither bells, wires or any front or back
doorbell</b>
<br><b>buttons on the house.&nbsp; I heard nothing more that evening.&nbsp;
About 3 weeks</b>
<br><b>later, I moved my family into the house.&nbsp; About a month after
moving in, my</b>
<br><b>son (who was about 3 at the time) told us at breakfast that a "woman"
was in</b>
<br><b>his room the night before.&nbsp; "What kind of woman?" I asked...
and he went on</b>
<br><b>to tell us, with his limited vocabulary, that a woman "with white
clothes"</b>
<br><b>came in and sat on his bed.&nbsp; I asked if she looked like mommy
and he said no.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I asked if she talked to him and he said no... she just sat
there.&nbsp; I asked</b>
<br><b>if she walked in or walked out but he told us that she just sat
on the bed.</b>
<br><b>My wife and I looked back and forth at each other and then at our
son who</b>
<br><b>continued to eat his breakfast.&nbsp; He wasn't upset or disturbed
and we simply</b>
<br><b>moved on to the business of the day...&nbsp; He never mentioned
any other visit</b>
<br><b>again.&nbsp; (today, at 6 years old, he says he does remember the
woman, but can</b>
<br><b>offer very little about her)&nbsp; About a week after this, my wife
confronted me</b>
<br><b>when I came home from work... and told me that all afternoon she
heard the</b>
<br><b>continuous rattle of dishes being moved about in the kitchen while
she was</b>
<br><b>either upstairs or at the other side of the house.&nbsp; She also
heard the</b>
<br><b>cupboard doors slamming shut...hard.&nbsp; She told me that she
would go to the</b>
<br><b>kitchen to see what was going on but would find nothing out of the
ordinary.</b>
<br><b>(In all the time we lived in the house, I never heard the dishes
or cupboard</b>
<br><b>doors.)&nbsp; Over the next month or so... my wife told me that
she would also</b>
<br><b>hear various doors in the house slamming shut but again, when she
went to see</b>
<br><b>or walked through the house, the doors were as they had been.&nbsp;
(I had taken</b>
<br><b>pains to insulate against the New Hampshire winter cold and wind...
this</b>
<br><b>house was not drafty.&nbsp; We had candles lit on many winter nights
and never saw</b>
<br><b>them so much as flicker.)&nbsp; My last personal experience in the
house was the</b>
<br><b>most dramatic.</b>
<br><b>My wife had taken the children shopping and had been gone for about
an hour</b>
<br><b>or two... it was a Saturday afternoon.&nbsp; I grabbed a book next
and lay down on</b>
<br><b>top of my bed to read a few chapters.&nbsp; After a bit of time,
I heard the door</b>
<br><b>at the bottom of the stairs open (doorknob rattle, a bit of hinge
work) and</b>
<br><b>heavy footsteps coming up the stairs.&nbsp; Our bedroom was at the
top of the</b>
<br><b>stairs and I could see the landing from my bed.&nbsp; As I heard
the first few</b>
<br><b>steps... I thought to myself that my wife must have come home, but
I KNEW</b>
<br><b>that I hadn't heard the car entering the yard, car doors slamming,
kids</b>
<br><b>talking, etc... all the normal sounds of my family's arrival from
a shopping</b>
<br><b>trip.&nbsp; I dropped the book flat onto my chest and looked over
my feet towards</b>
<br><b>the bedroom door and stared at the top landing space... all while
the</b>
<br><b>footsteps continued to climb the stairs.&nbsp; Clump, bump, clump...
to what would</b>
<br><b>have been the top... but nothing!&nbsp; I got up and went to the
landing...</b>
<br><b>nothing.&nbsp; I went straight down and through the house... to
the kitchen.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>looked out to our driveway... just my car sat there.&nbsp; I made
some coffee...</b>
<br><b>went back to my room and about an hour later my wife and kids returned</b>
<br><b>home... I told her my story... as I've just told you.&nbsp; I had
no other</b>
<br><b>personal experiences with this sort of thing in this house, nor
at any time</b>
<br><b>before or since.&nbsp; We moved away about a year later to Florida.&nbsp;
We moved for</b>
<br><b>the weather, the financial opportunities, to be closer to other
family</b>
<br><b>members but NOT because of any hauntings or the bizarre.&nbsp; The
farm house we</b>
<br><b>lived in still stands and is well known in the town we lived in...
and it</b>
<br><b>continues to be known locally as "The Cheever Farm" and is located
on the</b>
<br><b>Cheever Road in Dorchester, New Hampshire, about 20 minutes west
of Plymouth</b>
<br><b>New Hampshire.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Workboots and Indian Drums</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: dawngillan@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've lived in my house since I was born 34 years ago. When I was
about 5 years old, I was sleeping on my Grandmother's couch upstairs, when
I kept being awakened by the sound of heavy footsteps going up and down
the stairs loudly. I was really scared but when I reached for the doorhandle
to have a look the sounds stopped and afterward I was too scared to try
having another look, so I just listened until falling asleep.....When I
was 8, my mother and my older foster sister were returning home one night
from seeing the exorcist movie at the movie</b>
<br><b>theater when things got really out of hand. My younger sister and
I shared a bedroom and our brother had the room on the other side of the
wall at our heads. We frequently played games of knocking in code and this
night we didn't want to play so we didn't knock back. Sometime after the
knocking began we heard my brother call to my foster sister and tell her
to have us stop knocking, he was tired and wanted to go to sleep. My sister
and I said "What!" When she came in to tell us to stop, we told her that
we were not knocking and that we thought it was</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;him and we were tired and wanted to go to sleep. She almost
believed us and went back to the kitchen with my Mom. The knocking continued
and my sister and I called to my foster sister to have my brother stop
knocking. When she went to tell him he was sound asleep. We told her that
he wasn't sleeping that he was knocking and she insisted he was really
asleep. The knocking occurred in rhythyms as if it was an indian drum kind
of tapping. It even got louder and faster and moved to different walls
in the room and to the ceiling. My older foster sister and</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;my aunt each slept in me and my sister's beds until we fell
asleep. We were so scared listening to the indian drums we wanted to run
out of the room but they made us stay there and lay in the beds and listen
to it until we fell asleep. After we fell asleep, they got up and went
back to the kitchen, probably to discuss the events, when we woke back
up to the same noises. Finally they put a mattress on the middle of the
floor in the living room and we all slept there together for the entire
night. If you know when the exorcist was in the movie theater, you know
that was a long time ago and we haven't had any indian drums since then
but I have heard of 2 other houses on my street who had the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;same noises in them. Me and a lot of my friends have had lots
of different kinds of encounters with ghosts in my house over the years.
This story is true and this house really is haunted!</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>My Fathers phone Call</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: miya_aug@bellsouth.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Let me start off by saying I never met my real father he died when
I was</b>
<br><b>a baby. Any how I have always known about my deceased father his
name</b>
<br><b>was Jerry, now no one in my family talks about my deceased dad and
we</b>
<br><b>don't know anyone by the name of Jerry. One day when I was between
the</b>
<br><b>ages of&nbsp; 8- 9, my cousin my mother and myself were down stairs
the</b>
<br><b>basement singing. the phone began to ring and even though we had
a phone</b>
<br><b>in the basement I went upstairs ( one flight ) to our library to
answer</b>
<br><b>the phone so as to not disturb my mothers song. When I answered
the</b>
<br><b>phone I noticed immediately the static on the line and I knew it
wasn't</b>
<br><b>our phone so I asked the caller to speak louder now from here on
out it</b>
<br><b>gets weird the caller asked to speak to Re-C&nbsp; My moms nickname
I then</b>
<br><b>asked who was calling and&nbsp; the caller replied Jerry. I immediately
knew</b>
<br><b>my mother knew of no other Jerry so I repeated the name and the
caller</b>
<br><b>acknowledge that that was his name. I tell him to hold on. I&nbsp;
run down</b>
<br><b>stairs to where my mother and cousin were and tell my mother to
pick up</b>
<br><b>the phone that she had a phone call and that the callers name was
Jerry.</b>
<br><b>My cousin looked up shocked as did my mother and simultaneously
said</b>
<br><b>Jerry. This all happening within a minute or so. So my mother picks
up</b>
<br><b>the phone and answers the call only there is no one on the line
now. I</b>
<br><b>run back upstairs to the library to hang up the phone and I go back
to</b>
<br><b>the basement and both my mother and my cousin are trying to figure
out</b>
<br><b>if I got the name right. I assure them I did and tell them about
the</b>
<br><b>connection and the static. We all just kinda dismissed the call&nbsp;
only</b>
<br><b>later when I started thinking about it did I realize that my father</b>
<br><b>never knew me and died very tragically when when he was struck by
a car.</b>
<br><b>I think he wanted to hear my voice and hear my mothers voice. What
I</b>
<br><b>didn't tell my mother or my cousin is that that caller addressed
me by</b>
<br><b>my name I never told the caller my name but he knew my name.</b>

<br><b><font size=+1>Black Figures</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jhough@highfiber.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Hi, I have sent info before, but I am using a friend's computer
today</b>
<br><b>since the battery in my car is dead...nothing to do with ghosts,
I don't</b>
<br><b>think. Anyway, having read about people seeing "black figures" I
thought I</b>
<br><b>would add my two cents.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The first time, I was 16, lining in L.A. with my grandparents,
who were</b>
<br><b>out of town at the time. I wasn't drinking, just alone, when I left
my</b>
<br><b>bedroom, crossed the hall into the kitchen, when a figure stepped
out</b>
<br><b>infront of me. I saw the legs and arms, kinda like that famous "Big
Foot"</b>
<br><b>photo. It was creepy, I got a baseball bat and turned on all the
lights in</b>
<br><b>the house and called a friend. Nothing else...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Then just less than 2 years ago, I had since moved to Corrales,
NM.</b>
<br><b>I was living with another woman. I got up in the middle of the night
to use</b>
<br><b>the restroom. As I came out, through the door, there was another
"Shadow</b>
<br><b>being" right in front of me. I saw it's head and shoulders. Taller
than me.</b>
<br><b>I put my hands up as if to gesture, "Excuse me" or not to run it
over.</b>
<br><b>Since then, here in Corrales I have felt things in the corners,
rushing</b>
<br><b>around the room...and such.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought my own house in July of 1999, and my dog barked
incredibly at</b>
<br><b>one particular corner. My rommmate at the time immediatley burned
sage and</b>
<br><b>he stopped. What are these things ?</b>
<br><b>I have not seen anything at my place, and the dogs haven't acted
weird</b>
<br><b>since...any ideas ? Someone did say that I might have been "Dimension</b>
<br><b>Jumping" have you heard of this ?</b><b></b>

<br><b><font size=+1>The church ghost?</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: TLHZKH@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>While reading electric meters for ComEd, I had my one and only experience
in</b>
<br><b>a long history of believing in ghosts.&nbsp; I had to read a meter
in a church</b>
<br><b>that I had never been to before. In many buildings the electric
meter is</b>
<br><b>inside and out of the way, which means if you have never been there
before</b>
<br><b>they can be hard to find. I went into this church while working
on Saturday</b>
<br><b>hoping to find a janitor or someone to help me find the meter. The
parking</b>
<br><b>lot was empty but I hope to find someone anyway. After looking around
and</b>
<br><b>calling hello for a little while I decided to look around for just
a couple</b>
<br><b>of more minutes.&nbsp; I walked down a hallway of classrooms looking
in each one,</b>
<br><b>not finding anyone.&nbsp; All of the classrooms looked the same,
two folding</b>
<br><b>tables end to end with folding chairs pushed in around them. As
I came to the</b>
<br><b>end of the hallway I heard a noise behind me. It sounded like a
metal chair</b>
<br><b>scraping on a tile floor. I thought to myself "Finally someone is
here" I</b>
<br><b>returned to the room I thought the sound had come from and looked
in.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>chair at the head of the table had been pushed back as if someone
had gotten</b>
<br><b>up from the table. Knowing that the chair had been pushed in just
a minute</b>
<br><b>ago and that no one had had a chance to get out of the room before
I turned</b>
<br><b>around, I decided it was time to get out of there as quickly as
possible.</b><b></b>

<p><b><font size=+1>My Tell...</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sam@dragonbbs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>At one time I never believed in ghosts or spirits or anything that
is "supernatural". That is until I went over to my friend Sarah's house.It
all started back in "96". I had been friends with Sarah all my life (which
would have been 15 years then) and she had told me about her house, being
the skeptic that I was, I would laugh st her and call her crazy. I never
went over to her house much, and when I did it was only for a short amount
of time. Well during the summer of "96" I started staying the night with
her about every weekend. I noticed when I first went into her living room
it was very cold in one particular spot. Right in front of the stairway.
The hairs on the back of me neck</b>
<br><b>stood on end and my arm and leg on the right side got goose bumps
on them My friend Sarah and her fiance saw them too.My second experience
was about a week later. Me and Sarah decided to call it a night. She slept
on the couch at that time because her waterbed mattress had a hole in it.
So she pulled out a twin size mattress for me to sleep on. Well the mattress
was facing the stair way which they had a sheet over, because Sarah said
it felt like someone was starring at her from the top step when she would
try and sleep. Anyways as I laid there I looked over at the sheet and all
of a sudden it pushed out in the middle. Well at first I thought it was
just a</b>
<br><b>draft or something so I sat there and watched it and it did it again,
but this time it shot out even furthur in the middle. I sat there andwaited
to see if it would do it again, but it didn't.</b>
<br><b>My second experience happened 2 weekends later. Me, Sarah and her
fiance at that time were the only ones home. Sarah and her Fiance decided
to take a shower&nbsp; and I was still tired from staying up so late the
night before that I decided to take a nap while they where showering. I
was almost asleep, when I heard the squeak and then a bang of, well like
a cabinet door. Thinking it was Sarah and Jake I sat up and walked into
the kitchen and I heard it again. So I walked back to the bathroom and
asked if either of them were out of the shower. They said no that neither
of them had gotten out at all. Well when I got back to the living room
I heard it again and I</b>
<br><b>knew where it was coming from then. Upstairs, in the attic part
of the house. See the upstairs to this house is made weird. The Attic and
the room upstairs are one big room with a wall cutting it in two. Well
the door on the attic is a very small square door that they always keep
locked because a bat or two has been known to get into the house. Anyways
when I got upstairs I saw the door closing with my own eyes. Needless to
say I did freak a little. Well, Jake and Sarah get out of the shower come
in the living room and see that I am white as a sheet.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I tell them and my friend goes and checks it out and says.
"you won't believe this when I tell you." I said "what" and she said "the
door is locked" (the door has a bolt lock on it that slides side to side)</b>
<br><b>My third experience turned me into a believer. Me and Sarah where
the only two there, besides the dog who was asleep at Sarah's feet. We
were talking and all of a sudden we heard a pop can getting knoked around
under the couch, we got a little nervous and then to our relief a mouse
darted out from underneath the couch. We started laughing and I made a
comment about a big old mouse must be what causes the noises we hear ect...
Next thing we know we hear this footsteps I mean loud footstep going from
my friends' parents bedroom to her brothers bedroom</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;at the back of the cabin. It sounded like someone had work
boots on and was just stomping on purpose. Well my friend looks at me and
says "Now THAT was one big f___g rat!" I said "Lets go outside!"</b>
<br><b>Thank you for letting me share this few experiences that I have
encountered. What I told is just the begining. If you would like to know
more, just let me know, every word I just wrote is 100% true! though no
one will/wants to believe me!</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Christmas Vacation</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: dmouat@ccllabel.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My husband and I took our 2 children to Florida to visit his parents
this</b>
<br><b>past Christmas. Since his parents live in a small 2-bedroom condo,
there</b>
<br><b>wasn't room for all of us to sleep there. My mother-in-law has some
friends</b>
<br><b>with a condo about 3 or 4 miles from her building and they primarily
use it</b>
<br><b>for furnished rental. It happened to be unoccupied at the time,
so she made</b>
<br><b>arrangements for my husband and me to sleep there.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The first night we went over to go to bed, I noticed some dark shadows</b>
<br><b>moving around the apartment, but just out of the corners of my eyes.
I have</b>
<br><b>seen spirit shadows before and they do not look like regular room
shadows.</b>
<br><b>They are darker and more solid appearing. I didn't pay too much
attention at</b>
<br><b>first (didn't realize what I was seeing, I guess), until I got up
early the</b>
<br><b>next morning and went outside onto the apartment's small balconey.
I saw</b>
<br><b>something light colored go through the kitchen behind me and assumed
my</b>
<br><b>husband had come out of the bedroom. But when I went back into the
apartment</b>
<br><b>he was in the bathroom and had not come into the kitchen at all.
While I was</b>
<br><b>getting dressed I saw something small and black retreat under the
closet</b>
<br><b>door in the bedroom. I thought at first it was a roach; rare as
they are in</b>
<br><b>nice 5th floor Florida condos it was not impossible. I pulled back
the</b>
<br><b>closet door and there was nothing in the closet but pale gray carpeting
on</b>
<br><b>the floor and empty hangers on the rod. I began to have my suspicions,
but</b>
<br><b>kept them to myself.</b><b></b>
<p><b>That night my husband stayed at his mother's with our younger child
and my</b>
<br><b>oldest son, age 13, came back to the borrowed apartment with me
since we</b>
<br><b>were going fishing very early the next morning. He put his stuff
down in the</b>
<br><b>smaller bedroom then came out in the hallway and asked me who else
was in</b>
<br><b>the apartment. I said we were alone, why did he ask? He told me
he had just</b>
<br><b>seen something go through his bedroom. Well, that clinched it for
me, but I</b>
<br><b>kind of brushed it off, not wanting to scare him. I did leave my
light on</b>
<br><b>all night, though! I saw the dark shadows up near the top of the
bedroom</b>
<br><b>door several times.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The next night when my husband and I arrived I went into the master
bedroom</b>
<br><b>and as I entered the room I felt this wave wash over me - sort of
a</b>
<br><b>combination of curiousity, irritation and loneliness.&nbsp; "Who
are you, why are</b>
<br><b>you here and where oh where have you been?" I decided I did not
feel up to</b>
<br><b>trying to communicate with this entity on its terms - not that I've
ever</b>
<br><b>been very successful with that anyway. So I sat on the bed and spoke
aloud</b>
<br><b>and told it I was just visiting, with permission from the owners.
I promised</b>
<br><b>to clean everything up before I left (for some reason I had the
feeling that</b>
<br><b>my "travel clutter"&nbsp; was making it upset) and in return, please
would it not</b>
<br><b>scare me by materializing unexpectedly.</b><b></b>
<p><b>After that evening the place just felt "empty". I didn't see the
shadows</b>
<br><b>anymore and had the feeling that whoever it was had vacated or was
just</b>
<br><b>staying out of the way. I guess we reached some sort of compromise.
I told</b>
<br><b>my husband that I thought there was a ghost in the apartment and
while he</b>
<br><b>scoffed and told me I was crazy, I notice he spent the remaining
3 nights at</b>
<br><b>his mother's and sent our son back with me. No one has died in that</b>
<br><b>apartment that I know of but it's in a large building full of retirees
and</b>
<br><b>I'm sure many residents have passed on over the 30 year life of
the</b>
<br><b>building. Maybe someone was just wandering around. I will never
know.</b><b></b>

<p><b>I was stationed at ford island, pearl harbor hi. in the early 80's.</b>
<br><b>I was a corpsman assigned to the hospital there, which at the time
was only</b>
<br><b>an aid station, keep there because of the brig on the other side
of the</b>
<br><b>island.</b>
<br><b>I spent many nights in this large hospital, alone. They only used
a small</b>
<br><b>area in the ER. All through the night you could hear people moving
around, and doors opening</b>
<br><b>and windows closing.I would walk around looking for the source of
the sounds but no one else was</b>
<br><b>there. Many people died there DEC. 7 and many years after that.</b>
<br><b>More then one night i woke up tinking someone was watching me, and
a few</b>
<br><b>nights i was awakend by the sound of the ER doors closing by them
selves. Ive</b>
<br><b>never written about this before. There were about 20 others who
had duty</b>
<br><b>there, and some men and women would pay me to take there duty so
that they</b>
<br><b>would not have to sleep there. I was shocked to see that no one
had reported</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was twelve, my family moved to a
newer house about ten miles away</b>
<br><b>from where i grew up.&nbsp; The house was seven years old and no
one had ever died</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; From the start, I would hear footsteps in the carpeting
and I always</b>
<br><b>felt that I was being watched, especially when I played our piano.&nbsp;
That was</b>
<br><b>the extent of my experiences until I was in my early twenties.&nbsp;
One evening,</b>
<br><b>my sister and I were sitting in the den talking.&nbsp; It was spring
and the</b>
<br><b>temperature was perfect, so all the windows were closed and the
air was off.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly, in the back of the room where there were a lot of plants
sitting</b>
<br><b>together, one plant in the middle started shaking furiously.&nbsp;
My sister and I</b>
<br><b>looked at each other and went into the other room.&nbsp; A few weeks
later my</b>
<br><b>mother and I were sitting alone in the house, when it sounded like
someone</b>
<br><b>very roughly raked fingernails down a couch in the back of the room,
which</b>
<br><b>was in sight, and again a plant that was sitting at the end of the
couch</b>
<br><b>started shaking furiously.&nbsp; My mother just would not admit
that we were being</b>
<br><b>visited, even though she'd witnessed it first hand.&nbsp; The last
time anything</b>
<br><b>paranormal happened was on a friday afternoon.&nbsp; I was in my
mother's room</b>
<br><b>talking to her when I noticed the atmosphere had seemed to have
grown heavy</b>
<br><b>and I got chills.&nbsp; As the afternoon wore on, the feeling increased
until I</b>
<br><b>couldn't stand to go into the room any longer.&nbsp; That evening
my sister and I</b>
<br><b>were alone and watching tv.&nbsp; I had gone to the fridge for a
snack and felt</b>
<br><b>the heaviness with the goosebumps on the left side of it.&nbsp;
I told my sister</b>
<br><b>that the ghosts was in the kitchen, I could feel it.&nbsp; A few
minutes later, a</b>
<br><b>picture that was hanging in the kitchen fell off of the wall.&nbsp;
When we got</b>
<br><b>the nerve up, my sister and I went around to another door in the
kitchen on</b>
<br><b>the opposite side of the room.&nbsp; We walked in and stood there,
seeing and</b>
<br><b>feeling nothing.&nbsp; Suddenly the hair on our arms literally stood
up and we had</b>
<br><b>to run out.&nbsp; Immediately afterwards it left and hasn't been
back.&nbsp; I don't</b>
<br><b>even feel like I'm being watched while playing the piano.&nbsp;
I guess whatever</b>
<br><b>it was only wanted to communicate, but I was too frightened.&nbsp;
I have felt the</b>
<br><b>heaviness with chills in other places, but until the last few years,
I hadn't</b>
<br><b>seen any entities.&nbsp; I have moved twice, and really don't believe
the houses</b>
<br><b>were haunted, but intermittenly and for short periods of time, I
believe</b>
<br><b>there were entities present.&nbsp; I have seen a man with long salt
and pepper</b>
<br><b>hair with a dark cloak looking at me with bright, colorless eyes(it
looked</b>
<br><b>like a negative of a photo).&nbsp; Also, I've seen&nbsp; a bright
elongated white shape</b>
<br><b>out of the corner of my eye around my bed several times.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The most profound</b>
<br><b>experience I've ever had was when I was visited by the spirit of
a friend who</b>
<br><b>had died a week before his sixteenth birthday.&nbsp; Almost ten
years later, I</b>
<br><b>started having dreams with him there and I would wake up&nbsp; with
the most</b>
<br><b>wonderful feeling of being loved.&nbsp; During one of these dreams,
I was at home</b>
<br><b>alone during the day and had to sleep because I was working nights.&nbsp;
It was a</b>
<br><b>little warm, but not enough for the air.&nbsp; I had two blankets
on my bed and</b>
<br><b>threw one in the floor, and the other was a mess because I had been
tossing</b>
<br><b>and turning.&nbsp; I finally made it back to sleep and dreamed of
my friend.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>got too hot and woke up to find the blanket I tossed on the floor
laid over</b>
<br><b>me very neatly.&nbsp; I've had too many experiences to discount
anything to just</b>
<br><b>chance and my mother is finally admitting that she has experienced
the</b>
<br><b>paranormal.</b><b></b>

<br><b><font size=+1>Mt. Lemmon Arizona</font></b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I live in Tucson Arizona.&nbsp; Shortly north of the City Lies Mt.
Lemmon.&nbsp; This</b>
<br><b>peak is a great pine forested 7000 foot get away from the desert
city. I had</b>
<br><b>my brother and two friends over at my place at about 1AM a few months
ago,</b>
<br><b>and after a few hours of boredom, We decided to go up to Mt. Lemmon
and enjoy</b>
<br><b>some nice cool night air.&nbsp; (I would often take the 45 minute
trip to wind</b>
<br><b>down and watch the stars, so this is a very familiar place)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trip started off very normal.&nbsp; Our first
stop was without</b>
<br><b>occurrences.&nbsp; The next stop, I became mildly aware of a presence.&nbsp;
This is</b>
<br><b>nothing new to me, however, so I ignored it.&nbsp; By the third
stop, we got out</b>
<br><b>again.&nbsp; My brother and our friend Steve stayed in the car,
and my friend Thea</b>
<br><b>and I went for a walk.&nbsp; After a short discussion about friend
trouble, she</b>
<br><b>interrupted and said she kept seeing a shadowed figure from the
top of a</b>
<br><b>nearby peak.&nbsp; I told her that something was watching us, but
not to worry</b>
<br><b>because I didn't sense hostility.&nbsp; We started to walk back,
and kept hearing</b>
<br><b>the sound of scattering gravel and an extra set of foots steps on
the other</b>
<br><b>side of me.&nbsp; This was at first amusing because we knew at this
time, we had</b>
<br><b>gained a friend that was not from around here.&nbsp; By the time
we got to the</b>
<br><b>car, Thea panicked, and when we got in, my brother and Steve spoke
of</b>
<br><b>shadowed figures they saw.&nbsp; We smiled, started the car, and
drove down the</b>
<br><b>mountain.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we spoke about what we saw and felt and heard,
it was decided we would</b>
<br><b>stop again.&nbsp; We pulled off at a scenic view of a canyon area,
where we found</b>
<br><b>a newer model ford Bronco, with the engine idleing, the dome light
on, and no</b>
<br><b>one in or around the vehicle.&nbsp; This was unsettling, but could
surely be</b>
<br><b>explained, no matter how far fetched the explanation.&nbsp; We stayed
here for</b>
<br><b>about 10 minutes.&nbsp; After the first couple of minutes, my brother
and I</b>
<br><b>simultaniously noticed a large dark mass above the peak were we
were being</b>
<br><b>watch earlyer.&nbsp; Thea saw shadow figures on top of the peak.&nbsp;
I could see the</b>
<br><b>mass disappear as if moving down the mountain toward us.&nbsp; Thea
said the</b>
<br><b>figures were walking down the mountain side.&nbsp; No one was scared
at this</b>
<br><b>point, we were all very amused.&nbsp; When I could no longer see
the mass (I was</b>
<br><b>only able to see it above the mountain because the sky posed as
a backdrop)</b>
<br><b>we all got a wave of panic.&nbsp; Gravel started swirling around
everywhere, and</b>
<br><b>Thea and Jason ran for the car.&nbsp; I was stunned, so I was the
last to get</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; Jason entered the car from the other side, but his
heavy trench coat</b>
<br><b>was flipped over his head as he opened the door.&nbsp; We started
the car and sped</b>
<br><b>down the mountain.&nbsp; We spoke with Steve about what we saw,
he saw the same</b>
<br><b>shadow figures Thea had seen.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We Pulled over one last time without getting
out of the car to show steve</b>
<br><b>the black mass that was causing all of the commotion.&nbsp; We then
kept driving</b>
<br><b>until we reached the city again.&nbsp; The whole way down, seeing
cars pulled of</b>
<br><b>to the side, some with dome lights on, never with anyone in or around
them.</b>
<br><b>(This is very odd for 3AM on a Thursday morning, further more, vehicles
are</b>
<br><b>not allowed to park on the road after 10PM)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next night, THea and I returned.&nbsp; We
never got out of the car this</b>
<br><b>time, however.&nbsp; Every time we cut the engine and all power,
we hear a</b>
<br><b>scratching underneath the car, and eventually, it would start to
rock.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>pulled over 4 times, this happened every time.&nbsp; Finally, the
fifth time we</b>
<br><b>decided to get out of the car before that happened so we would have
enough</b>
<br><b>guts to see what else would happen.&nbsp; Once again we didn't make
it.&nbsp; We opened</b>
<br><b>the doors and pointed our flashlights out side and as soon as we
did, gravel</b>
<br><b>started swirling around louder than before, there was no wind, and
we watched</b>
<br><b>it jump around as if someone was kicking it right in front of us.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this trip, it turned out that the breaks
in the front left of the</b>
<br><b>car (Where we heard the scratching from when the car was off) were
worn down</b>
<br><b>badly, however the rest of the breaks were fine.&nbsp; We stumped
the mechanic,</b>
<br><b>but once again, this is something that may be explained, I just
don't know</b>
<br><b>how.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am planning a return trip, well equipped now.&nbsp;
I will bring a camera,</b>
<br><b>several flashlights, and a video recorder.&nbsp; Depending on the
out come of this</b>
<br><b>trip, I will forward any eventful images to your site.&nbsp; I am
stuck wondering</b>
<br><b>two things now.&nbsp; First off, what is this entity?&nbsp; There
are no local legends</b>
<br><b>that I have found yet about Mt. Lemmon.&nbsp; Second off, will it
be there again</b>
<br><b>when I visit next week?&nbsp; I hope so.&nbsp; There is so much
more I would like to</b>
<br><b>learn before it becomes just a memory.&nbsp; If anyone has any suggestions
about</b>
<br><b>this incident, or what it could be, please e-mail me at MDragon53@aol.com</b>
