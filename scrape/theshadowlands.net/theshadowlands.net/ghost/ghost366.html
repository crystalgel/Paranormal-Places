<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">What is in the
closet?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I have read many of
your stories and decided it was time to tell mine. This was many years ago and
in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="">Plano</span></st1:City><span style="">, </span><st1:State><span style="">Texas</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style=""> on (get this) 420 Apollo road. The house was a corner lot and green but
from the beginning things weren't right! When I first entered the house in the
first bedroom I reached I found many satanic books strewn around the room ( my
spelling is just as bad as most). Also, weird at the end of the hallway of the
house was were what looked like a book shelf closed off as I entered the next
room the bathroom was competely boarded and had to be pryed with a hammer to
get in (this became my mothers room) the third bedroom was to be my sisters and
I. One night my mother was on a date and we were three sisters left to be good
and take care of each other by the way their was many cold spots but lets get
back to the story&#8230;I was watching the stars in the driveway on top of a yellow orb
every night it seemed three lights would pass across the field from our house
and disappear you could hear dogs howling as if someone was beating them I
wonder if this still goes on. Anyway, I went to bed early as all three of us
had. During the night my sister who had her own room shook me awake telling me
she saw someone in the house. You must believe me when I tell you I was pissed
that she woke me up and asked to trade rooms with me but I thought you know I
don't mind sleeping in my own room cool lets switch. I immediately noticed the
chill in her room and the closet door wide open and when I turned the lights
out I saw what looked to be yellow-reddish eyes and hoved feet looking from the
closet I felt scared but got the nerve up to close the door. I actually
remember falling to sleep fast like putting your head down and bam your out.
Last I remember I woke up what really felt like I had one of the best sleeps
ever to a police office standing at the foot of my bed. I looked at him as why
are you here kind of thing and he explained that our oldest sister had called
and that she saw a shadow in the hallway so, we all were carted out to the
living room and us sisters sat there on the couch with me holding the dog and
being pissed that I was really enjoying my sleep. As, I was brushing off the
sleep I noticed that their was loud banging noises coming from the attic and
just a month earlier I had been up their with my brother helping install
installation and knew their was nothing in the attic it sounded like loud wind
and boxes being thrown. I also, noticed the officers I think two maybe three
wouldn't go into the attic and would just dismiss the noise when they came back
to the living room they gave their card and what not to my sister and told her
to call if anything else occurred. It, did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Might I tell you know that the previous owners of the house were bikers
and something happened in the garage and family members were killed just a side
note mind you. Their was not even a breeze outside you could beg for one but
anyway to the story after the police left I scorned my sister for waking me up
and as I was still holding the puppy proceeded to go back to bed as I was
walking toward the hallway to my room I looked down and so that our dogs eyes
were wide and stooped with absolute fright shaking I stood between the living
room and hall way looked up and saw the black shadow that my sister was talking
about going straight across and the rest of the shadow on the refridgerator
side. I couldn't move and just about then my sister pulled me by the arm out of
the house my other sister stayed but that was a horrific nightmare the puppy
died two-weeks later with a broken neck. To this day and more happened I will
never forget. Thank you, for letting me tell this encounter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">STRANGE THINGS AFTER
DAD PASSED AWAY<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">By: Got2camp@aol.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Dad was told he had
cancer in May of 1999. He had always taken care of my mom. Mom had been sick
most of my life. Dad passed away July 14 of 1999. The ball was dropped in my
lap into what to do with mom. She had always asked me not to put her in a
nursing home. So I left my job and brought mom to live with me and my husband
Sam.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The night my dad
died we went back to my parents house to stay . My son Brad and my husband got
a beer and went out to the patio to set. My dad had never drank a beer with Sam
and Sam took the beer and made a toast to my dad saying " here is to the
beer we never had together Walter"<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">at the time they
popped the cans of beer the 2 coach lights on the garage flashed blue and shots
of blue came from them and they went out!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Sam and Brad never
did take a drink of their beers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">After the funeral
and we was able to put our thoughts together. We brought mom to our home to
live. We have a manufactured home no one had ever lived in it but us. Things
had been so crazy in our lives that I felt I had not been giving my husband the
attention he needed. So I made a bed in front of the TV after mom was put to
bed and a little soft music . Things started to heat up when we heard this very
loud thump on the wall beside us. At that same time my mom says in a loud voice
" did you just see a man coming down the hall way" ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Needles to say the
night was over for Sam and I. A week later Sam and I had been in bed when Sam
says<span style="">&nbsp; </span>" Deb, Deb all I could say was
I see it. There was a shadow on his side of the bed and then moved to my side.
We couldn't believe what we had just seen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The next morning my
mom says to us " did you see your dad last night" we both said, yes.
The phone rang and it was my son who was with a friend down in </span><st1:place><span style="">Southern Illinois</span></st1:place><span style="">. He says MOM , last night I woke up and
grandpa was standing over me right by my bed. The only thing I could say was I
know he was here also. Now during this time mom became very sick and was put
into the hospital. She was put in a room across where my dad had been . She said,
she heard him calling her and got out of bed and tried to walk to the room
across from hers. She fell and broke her arm. I woke up at home to our ceiling
fan lights on and the fan on high speed. The phone rings and its the hospital
telling me of my mom breaking her arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Other strange things
started to happen like lights coming on in parts of the house. TV coming on. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I think the
strangest of all was New Years Eve of 1999. My dad had always been so worried
about the year 2000. He was worried what if mom wasn't able to get he pills and
her insulin shots. Sam had to work and I was watching<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a show on TV. When the clock struck </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="0"><span style="">midnight</span></st1:time><span style=""> the movie I was watching that was in
color,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>went to a black and white room
with two men in it. There was a desk and both men had on the same cloths. One
man looks at the other and said, ARE YOU MR WILSON? THE OTHER MAN SAID, YES I
AM. My parents last name was </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="">Wilson</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="">. This froze me to my chair not being able to
move. Then the movie I was watching was right there before my eyes. Back in
color.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I was hit with the
flu bug really bad in the winter of 2000. As I lay there in bed crying because
I just could take care of mom as I felt I needed to I felt this soft kiss on my
lips and a hand touch my cheek. Mom was in her bed and couldn't walk and I was
the only other person there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Mom started to see
someone setting beside her bed at night. She had a potty chair in her room. she
said, the man would set there for hours and look at her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night she screams out SAM &lt; SAM &lt;
SAM oh god he is pulling me by my arm. As we run to her room and turn the light
on you could see the fear in her eyes. Sam asked her where the man was and she
says right beside you by the stairs. We didn't have stairs in our home. I felt
so bad for mom as I started to think Dad was there to take her with him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I called a
paranormal group from southern </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="">Illinois</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style=""> to come to the house but was ask by my son
not to do this. Things was just to far gone in my mind. And I needed help to
keep my mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Mom was put in the
hospital so Sam and I cold take a break. She had a stroke the next day and was
in coma. I was at the hospital everyday with her. The fourth of July came upon
us and I told Sam I was not going to the hospital that day. As he was getting
ready for his 2nd shift job<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started
thinking yes I will go even if it was for a short time. I got to the hospital
around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="16"><span style="">4:00 pm</span></st1:time><span style=""> and
was setting there holding her hand<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and
she passed away. I think she was waiting on me to come to her so she wouldn't
die alone. As she was taking her last breath mom looked to the door, open her
eyes and smiled. All the pain that had aged her face all those past 35 years
was turned to a soften and free of pain. She was with daddy and I new it in my
heart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Dad and Mom had been
married for 50 years. During that year I tried to get grass to grow on dads
grave it wouldnt do anything just dirt. After mom was laid to rest beside him
the green grass grew. Dad Died ....</span><st1:date year="1999" day="14" month="7"><span style="">July 14, 1999</span></st1:date><span style="">.. Mom Died....</span><st1:date year="2000" day="4" month="7"><span style="">July 4, 2000</span></st1:date><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">God I miss them
both. But I no they are both watching over us together now. Strange thing still
happen from time to time and I just kind of give a smile and say OK&lt; I will
be careful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">You see its not the
first time I have had things happen to me like this. It has happen most of my
life. Its like I draw a power knowing someone is going to pas away in my dreams
or a smell. I would love to talk to you about these things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My father lives in
my grandmother's old house and he is taking care of my cousin. Before he got my
cousin I would always go over there to feed his dog while he was at work (on
the nights he worked late, he'd call around 11 pm and tell me to go feed his
dog) well I would, on occasion, go through the house instead of around the
house to the back door, and when I would, my father's bedroom door would SLAM
shut, or I would feel something like a "sheet" move past my arm or my
face. I never have actually SEEN anything but the sounds are unbelievable. I do
not believe in ghosts, or I should say I didn't until this last few months.
Even-though I said I haven't really seen anything, I do believe that at one
point in time there was a child like figure watching me clean my car one day
back in August. My father had blinds on his windows, and for a while they were
half way up the window and during this period of time I would THINK that I seen
a little child peaki down at me but when I would blink, it would no longer be
there. In September, I was going to my father's to get some DVDs to take back
with me to my dorm room, and I hear what sounded like someone running backwards
and forwards upstairs in the bedroom area of the house. THAT was just plain
SCARY so like the lil' scared shit-less, all the time in the night. person I am
, I slammed the door behind me and didn't stop running until I reached the sofa
in my basement. I haven't been the only person to hear it either, my mom heard
it one night, so my dad asked her if she heard it and her words to me were,
"how can I not hear it, it's right above my HEAD........do you hear this
all the time?!" and according to her, my dad had said that he was used to
it, that he hears it all the time. He thought it was rats but that house is
completely clean of any animals at all. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">When I was a child,
my father told me that my aunt had seen a woman in a white dress floating above
her bed, but when she realized that my aunt was looking at her, she floated up
and through the ceiling into the upper level of the house. I cannot remember
how many times someone's actually seen a woman in white float through solid
objects such as the refrigerator, walls, doors, and etc. This house is one
HAUNTED house, and I know I'll never stay over night there without SOMEONE ELSE
there with me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Thank you for your
time, and for reading this e-mail. This house is haunted. That I know for a
fact. I know that when you're perfectly sane, your mind doesn't play tricks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My family bought a
house on </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="">Park Ave.</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style=""> in the 1970s. My sister and I were the only ones in the house one
evening ,in the den when the door handle slowly turned, the door opened , a
cold draft wafted in and the door closed again all on it's own. We also heard
an old man praying in the front upstairs bedroom and hav seen a white dog
running down the upstairs hallway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">In a related story I
was at the hundred anniversary of </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="">Bostian</span></st1:PlaceName><span style=""> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="">Bridge</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style=""> in '91. No people saw any ghosts but the 2

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I deilver papers at
Madison Barracks in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="">Sackets Harbor</span></st1:City><span style="">
 </span><st1:State><span style="">NY</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="">. There old Millitary Barracks. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">When I was in one
building to drop off a paper, I was walking up the steps to the apartment
when<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt a hand on my shoulder. I
turned around and nobody was there. As I started back down the steps I saw a
figure walking downstairs in front of the door. He was dressed as an old army
soldier and hand his rifle over his shoulder. As I walked down the steps toward
the door, he turned and looked at me, as I went to open the door it opend by
it's self. Ever since then when I have been in that building I have gotten the
feeling like I'm being watched or fowlled by someone. It's not a bad feeling,
it's a very safe feeling. I feel that it's an old soldier still doing his job,
like he did back during the wasr of 1812.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:place><st1:City><span style="">Sackets
  Habor</span></st1:City><span style="">, </span><st1:State><span style="">NY</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style=""> is knowen to be filled with history from the
war of 1812. There are a lot of old buildings in Madison Barracks that are
being remoldled. It's been said that a man with a light can be seen on one of
the belconies. I drop a paper at another buliding, I believe this is where the
man with the light is seen. I feel very safe when I'm at Madison Barracks,
because I know I'm being watched over by the long since dead soldiers, who once
lived there. I believe they still patrol the Barracks to this day, to keep them
safe. I know their watching me and are keeping me company, when I'm in the
bulidings that are now used for apartments. I would like to hear from anyone
who has ever been to Madison Barracks in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="">Sackets Harbor</span></st1:City><span style=""> </span><st1:State><span style="">NY</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I was about 7 - 8
years old when this happened to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We (
my brother and I) were visiting a friend who lived on a farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After breakfast we headed of the the old barn
where we, as boys would attemp to build a go-kart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 30 minutes into the construction an old
man by the name of Johannes aproached us and started assisting us in the
construction of the vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
complesion, we ran back to the farm house to reveal our go-kart to his
dad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His father commented that we as
children ( being only 5,7,8 me being the oldest) could not in a milion years
construct such a contraption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then
asked if we had any help, whereto we replied that an old man by the name of
Johannes helped with the construction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Course there was no man by that name living on the farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We left it there and entered the living
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we all were sitting around (
His parents included) I looked up and noticed the old mans portrait hanging on
the wall. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I walked over to his father
and convirmed with him that the man on the wall was the same man that helped us
build the kart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As all three us children
aggreed on this, they laughed and replied that that was his great grandfather
who passed away more than 20 years ago.............<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm 18 years of age now and till today when I
visit </span><st1:PersonName><span style="">Rich</span></st1:PersonName><span style="">ard, we talk about that day and yes the
portrait is still hanging there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
meantime they have added 2 new siblings who are according to them also
interacting with old Johannes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My sister and her
husband have lived in this house with their children for 7 years now and wierd
things have happened over time, I will mention a few things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One was when my brother-in-law was alone in
the house and he was sleeping, and felt a cold air in the room, the next minute
he feels a real pressure on his stomach and sees a mist near him, this was to
let him know the family is not alone, I think, another was a worker was doing
their basement and he heard footsteps upstairs when no one was home, then a
year later I was there for two weeks visiting and everyone was in bed asleep, I
was just about to fall asleep, when I heard someone fall down the stairs, this
was not a sound of a child and my sister and her husband were sleeping, the
next dayI spoke to my sister and she told me everyone was asleep, and then she
told me some woman died falling down the stairs waiting for her husband to come
home, she died of her injuries, and the last incident happened two months ago,
I was watching tv and I heard footsteos walking down the stairs and into the
bathroom, the tap went on, I assumed it was my brother-in-law so I did not
think of looking, but just as the footsteps went upstairs I saw no one there, I
went up to ask Pete if he went downstairs to wash his hands and he said he was
upstairs all the time, I told him what happened and he said it is not the first
time this has happened, this house is bad luck, everything breaks down or
animals are living in there, they are thinking of moving next year and to this
day I am scared of stayin there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I live in Luling,
Louisiana, a town 30 minutes outside New Orleans that is about as fun as a
retirement home. I've lived my entire life and in 20 years I've had two
experiences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The scariest
happened when I was about fourteen or fifteen. I was staying at my friend
Corrie's house with my cousin Davlyn. Corrie lived in low income housing-it was
a really old and small place. We were sitting in the living room one night just
talking. It was summer and it's very humid down here, so there was a fan
blowing directly on us. I was sitting on a table, Davlyn was sitting in an
armchair facing the hallway. We were bored and taking Polaroids. I took one of
Corrie and Davlyn standing by a dollhouse. When it developed, there was this
strange fog next to Corrie's face. It looked like someone had poured acid on
the picture, but no one had. Almost seconds after that, Davlyn screamed. I
looked to see what she was screaming at and immediately starting howling too.
There was this tall black figure in the hallway. It was blurry, but I could see
that it was wearing sort of a 20's style fedora and long black coat. It's face
was shaking and let me tell you, it didn't look happy. So, all three of us ran
like hell for the door. The fan shut off by it's own. We started pulling on the
door, screaming our fool heads off. We didn't dare look behind us but there was
this sense of great pressure in the room, like it was bearing down on us. All
three of us were yanking on that door, but it wouldn't come open, and those
locks weren't on. We finally got it open and hauled butt down the street. We
turned around and saw the black shape in Corrie's window. We ran a few blocks
down to where my Nanny lives and slept by her place, if we could sleep at all.
The next morning we went back to Corrie's, feeling safe since it was daylight.
There was no sign of any disturbance in the house, but when we opened Corrie's closet,
there was a black fedora and coat on the floor. Corrie was a cheerleader. She
didn't own those things. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The second, more
mild event happened about 5 months or so ago. My friend Scott and I decided to
go take pictures at a Thibodeaux cemetary, since I enjoy photography. It was a
very, very hot day. We walked around the cemetary until we found an open tomb.
There was two compartments in it and the bottom one was very deep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a board blocking the bottom half of
the tomb. I looked at it and saw that there seemed to be a water stain that was
the shape of what seemed to be a pregnant woman. (picture attached) Scott is a
daring sort of person so he decided to get into the bottom half of the tomb to
take a picture. I agreed and he got into it. There was a small box at the back
of the tomb (there were no coffins, obviously) and Scott said that when he
touched it, the hair on the back of his neck stood up and he turned freezing
cold. Even from where I was standing, I got cold, and mind you, this was a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="">Louisiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style=""> summer day. Since that day I haven't gone
back to that cemetary, but I believe in ghosts like I believe in God, and
that's saying something.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My grandmother's
house in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="">Ottumwa</span></st1:City><span style="">, </span><st1:State><span style="">Iowa</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="">, always seemed a bit spooky to me when I visited it every year as a
child from my home in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="">Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not a terribly old house,
but it was perched up high upon a landscaped double terrace and there was a
thick, brooding forest across the street.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>My grandmother had lived there for decades with her middle-aged son, my
uncle, who suffered from some ill-defined mental problems.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not a particularly happy home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But my mother insisted I pay them a visit
every year and I complied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">When I visited, I
was usually placed in the room that I liked the least, an upstairs bedroom that
seemed ordinary yet always made me uncomfortable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was in that room, I had the definite
sensation of being watched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could
never really relax there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, one
year the tensions built up so severely that I experienced vague, but severe,
pains in my stomach and I wound up in the hospital for three nights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those pains never occurred at any other time
of my life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctors had no
explanation for the cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The last night that
I ever spent in that house was by far the scariest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the middle of the night, I was awakened
because my bed was shaking very roughly, practically flying off the
ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sensed a spirit hovering above
my bed, but I could not see it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an
act of bravery, I struck the invisible entity with my fist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shaking immediately ceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lay in bed, still scared but also vigilant,
until daybreak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I walked into the
kitchen, my mother looked at me and remarked humorously, "You look like
you've seen a ghost!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I must have
still been pale and shaken by the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not wanting to upset my grandmother, I said nothing about the
experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother and I drove home
to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="">Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style=""> that morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next time I stayed in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="">Ottumwa</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="">, many years later, I stayed at a comfortable
motel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I'm glad that I had
made an effort to "fight" the ghost.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ghosts enjoy scaring us; it can be like a game for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But that doesn't mean that we humans have to
play along.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not have to consider
ourselves helpless in an encounter with the supernatural.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we choose, we can give them a scare!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I have just returned
from travelling on the London Underground railway (we call it &#8220;The Tube&#8221; &#8211; Americans
would call it &#8220;The Subway&#8221;).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I changed
trains at </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="">Leicester Square</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style=""> and managed to get on board a southbound
Northern line train just before the doors closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I sat down I realised that there was only
one other person in the carriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took
no notice of him and started reading my newspaper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we approached the next station (</span><st1:place><span style="">Charing Cross</span></st1:place><span style="">) I looked up and realised that I was
alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have tried to tell myself that
the other person had got off the train but of course he couldn&#8217;t have,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as the doors remain closed until the trains
stop in a station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>London Underground
trains and stations are reputed to harbour several ghosts,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and despite my often voiced scepticism, I am
now wondering whether I encountered one of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I had a red healer
puppy named Ali. She was the runt of the litter and was born with a weak heart.
She was my little angel. She was a ball of energy just for me;she would lay
around and sleep when I was not around. When I ended up with the flu, I was so
sick I couldn't even get out of bed. My little Ali would lay right next to me
and cuddle as best she could. I ended up with a very high fever and one evening
Ali gently crawled up on my chest and layed her head on my shoulder. The next
morning I felt good enough to get out of bed and go watch tv. Ali climbed up on
my lap and slept. She was 9 months old when she passed to the next plain. Every
year when I end up with a cold, I wake up sometime during the night with the
feeling of her on my chest. I consider her my guardian angel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Before I tell you
these storys I will go over a little backround. I live on one of the oldest
streets in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> and years ago in Salem Witch times actully before Salem Witch times
Giles Corey beat Jacob goodale a farmhand to death. Also there is a cemertary
on the corner of wildwood drive and Goodale st which is where my first story
begins. Me some friends and my neighbor and his brother decided after going to
the streetlight (that is my second story) to go to Needhams cemetary we joked
along the way my neighbors brother being an idiot banged on streetsigns and
kicked leaf bags. Before we reached the graveyard I was more scared of police
then ghosts since it was about </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="21"><span style="">nine pm</span></st1:time><span style="">. We got there and I took pictures of
gravestones including Sally Morses the little girl who haunts the area and got
nothing. My friend took a picture of one of the windows in the house next door
( a modern tropy home but it was built on haunted land) when I heard her say
" Oh my god what is that" another on e of my friends said "It's
moving!". It was an orb and we caught it on camera. We started to hear
noises from behind some of the gravestones near the rock wall. My neigbor said
we should leave so we did and my grandfather picked me and some of my friends
up (two wanted to walk home with my neighbor and his brother) when we where all
back and started eating pizza and throwing m&amp;m's at each orther my neighbor
said he had seen a ghost him and his brother had seen a little girl with long
hair staring at us crouched behind the tiny rock wall staring.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Now my second story
that started early that same evening when my neighbor said lets go to the light
it was a haunted street light that turns off when people stand under it and
once he saw a dark figure in the tree. So we cut though peoples yards one guy
threatend to call the police if we cut though his yard again and saw the light
right past a small graveyard and sure enogh it turned off when we got near it .
I thought it was just defected but you never know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Well first of all I
would like to say I think your site is cool and well I have never thought that
I would ever tell anyone about my storie except for my friends. But I think
this site is legitimite enough so I will entertain you with something that
happened to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">In 2001, I was going
to school In Rosthern, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="">Saskatchewan</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="">. This school has been around for more then 100 years, so it is pretty
old. The school has a set of dorms in the back where the students can eat and
sleep and make many friends. I guess there were a couple of stories going
around about how the dorms were haunted in the girls side. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">It was said that
there was a girl that hung herself on the third floor in room 313. I guess one
time a girl got up late one night to go to the bathroom and she got a weird
feeling and looked down the hallway and saw a girl walk from the room at the
end of the hall to the bathroom (which is in the middle of the hallway). <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Anyways, that's one
story but I have heard many others, and felt that I have witnessed an encounter
myself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My friend and I were
told about a specific night where if you stay at the dorms you will see a ghost
or at least feel a presence. We weren't really believers, well I don't think my
friend is too much, but I always have believed and still believe in the
paranormal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">So, we stayed at the
dorms on </span><st1:date year="2001" day="3" month="3"><span style="">03-3-2001</span></st1:date><span style="">, and
we stayed up until </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="3"><span style="">3 a.m.</span></st1:time><span style=""> or
later. We were hungry so we went up to the third floor and made some food at
the microwave at the end of the hall. We were talking and at this time it was
about 1 or 2 a.m., and we figured we would walk down the hall to the back end
and see if we could see anything, but we didn't but when we got to the end of
the hallway and started down the back stairwell we could hear the dormroom
doors sound like they were being closed. So we kept walking to the second floor
and we just figured it was the Deans coming to check on everyone. So we went to
our bedroom and had our food, then around 3 we started to feel hungry again, so
we decided to go back up to the third floor. Well this time we were a little
more scared about the noises because when we were microwaving our food we
suddenly heard soft music coming from down the hall, so we went to go see where
it was coming from and my friend stopped at the first door and said she
couldn't hear it anymore. I went afterward to see if she was just making it up
but she wasn't and we listened hard to see if we could still hear it, but we
couldn't until we went back to the microwave. So then we were talking again and
we suddenly heard the doors at the end of the hall sound like they were closing
again, so we checked down the hall and didn't see anyone. After that we kinda
started to get spooked and we quickly walked down the hallway to the back
stairwell and then down to the second floor. Again we heard the doors closing
and we figured it was just the Deans again checking but we waited for a bit to
see if they would come to the 2nd floor but they didn't. We just figured it was
the wind after that and went into our room and talked. We grew silent after
awhile and we could hear the doors on the second floor near the end of the hall
(were we just came from) start to close. So we, went and stood by the doorway
and were looking out I looked down the hall toward the back stairwell and my
friend looked the other way, then we switched sides and looked the other way
but we still couldn't see anything. Then I looked back at the backstairwall and
suddenly I saw a white half circle in the window at the end of the hall. I
thought i was imagining it so I looked down to the other end to see if it was
our own reflection but from the angle, it wasn't. So I looked back at the
stairwell and the form moved right into the middle of the window so I could
clearly see the form of the head and shoulders. It also had stripes on its
chest that looked like our rugby shirts that we wear for school, but I don't
really know if I was just imagining it cause it was so late at night or if it
really happened. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">So anyways after
that I freaked and told my friend to close the door and lock it. We jumped on
her bed and I just sat there shivering uncontrollably and the hair on the back
of my neck wouldn't go down for over a couple hours, I even scared my friend
cause she couldn't figure out what was wrong, so I told her what had happened.
We finally went to sleep and then in the morning we were getting ready for the
day and I was going to go to the washroom, when I had the urge to look at the
ground. When I did I noticed the little white flakes from the ceiling all over
the floor, weirder yet they were perfectly set in-between the door of the
bathroom and the bedroom door. We looked at the ceiling and didn't see any
signs of people dragging their hands along it, so we couldn't figure out why
the flakes were like that, but we suspected that maybe I wasn't just imagining
things. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">So that's my story
and if you don't believe it that is fine, I don't think many people do, so
that's why not too many people know about it. If you have anything to say about
it, that would be great, but if not, thanks anyways for listening, or reading I
guess.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I was 17 years old
at the time and I lived on the post at </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="">Fort Riley</span></st1:City><span style="">, </span><st1:State><span style="">Kansas</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The way the post is set up is
the new side, where all of the lower ranking soldiers and their families
lived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the historical side where all
the Officers and their families lived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
lived on the new side with my mother and her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was late September and my next door
neighbor worked at the Kings Field Gym located in the historical part of the
post.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And he had been telling everyone
for weeks that there had been strange happenings going on when he would close
the gym at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said it all started
when he started to talk to Col. Patton, who had died nearly 20 years before, in
the basketball court and tell him how bad the army has become.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And he would do that night after night until
he weird things started to happen like the lights coming on when he had just
turned them off, or visa versa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't
believe him, so he took me there one night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We went in and all the lights had been turned off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There's an excerise room about 20 ft long
50ft wide on the second floor that over looks the basketball court on one side
and over looks the racket ball courts on another, and the other two sides are
filled with windows that over look the street and parking lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was around dusk and the sun had just set,
so it was still light outside. But when we went up to the second floor, we
could see anything, and when I mean anything I mean it was so dark that I
couldn't see my hand 2 inches in front of my face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started to freak out a little bit and told
him that we shouldn't go in any further, I just had this bad feeling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we went back to the first floor and began
to cross the basketball court to the far exit behind the building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We could see the excersise room from the
basketball court just fine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we
crossed and made it to the other side, the sound of a pebble being thrown
across the floor echoed through out the court and I was like, ok, it's time to
go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But my neighbor noticed that there
was a service on that was shinning through the ceiling right above us, and
course he had to check it out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He didn't
find anything except for the fact that the light was on and he couldn't explain
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we exited the building, the
church across the street began to toll and the full moon behind it with cloud
crossing over it made for one creepy ending to that story!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as we were driving we also noticed that
across the street, next to the church was Patton Hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My neighbor said he'd never noticed that
before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We also noticed that there is a
street lamp right next to the corner window where the excercise room is, but we
didn't see any light all while were up there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Creepy.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I just wanted to
share something that happened to me 2 nights ago. At about </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="22"><span style="">10:30pm</span></st1:time><span style=""> i was up at the school parking a car. I
pulled my car up to the curb to empty some garbage out of my car. The whole
school was completely dark but out of the corner of my eye i saw something
glowing on the top floor. i looked up and there was a woman staring down at me.
The way that she looked at me completely gave me cold chills all down my body.
Her face was completely white and her hair was long and very black. I looked at
my friend and asked her if she saw something in the window up above me and she
said no. So i ran to get into the car and we left. We circled back around and
she wasn't there anymore still.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
have been many reports of this school being haunted. It was built on a
graveyard and many people believe that not all of the bodies were taken up. Two
days later i came to school and a girl came up to me and said that she was
telling her boyfriend(who goes to college now and i don't talk to) about what i
saw.. she hadn't got to the description yet and he interrupted her. He said
that about 2 years ago him and his friend<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>were riding around town and they went by the school and it was
completely dark until they saw the staircase. He said that there was a pale
woman with really dark hair standing there. They both saw her. Then they came
back around and she was go When my friend heard him say that she freaked out
because that sounded like the same woman that i saw. Now i have researched this
and talked to many people. and there isn't anyone that works at our school at
night that has dark long hair like that. This has really affected me and every
time i talk about it i get really bad cold chills and my eyes water really bad.
Many people do believe me and many others think that i am weird.. but my
teacher said that she has herself over the years heard several students talk
about seeing something in that same room at night. I was also talking to some
women from school that work there and they said that they were in the office
one night really late and they were watching the monitors to the cameras and
one of them looked at the other 2 and asked if they saw something in the
monitor and they did.. They said that they saw a girl kneeling and praying
outside. (As if at a grave) They went outside and there wasn't anyone or any
trace of anyone being there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">A Disturbing
Occurance<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I was about 16 years
old ( i am 20 today) and living with my mother,her boyfriend, and my sister and
brother in our small two bedroom apt. I had just gotten home from school and
decided I would relax on the couch and read a book for a while to unwind from
the pressures of being a normal high school student. I had had experiences with
inhuman entities before but not for some time and never like this before. As i
was reading silently to myself I began to drift off to sleep, but before I
could close my eyes I looked over to see something strange going on. You know
those tall skinny lamps people have that are about 6 feet high and and have
like a bowl at the top with a light bulb inside. Well my mom had one<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a few feet away and it began to lift up off
the ground. When i realized what was going on I was shocked, but I didn't have
time to take it in because after it had lifted a good foot of the ground it
then began to swing left and right like a pendulum. I knew at that point that
something wasn't o.k. And as soon as i could rationalize the situaton into an
actual thought I became paralyzed and started to panic.For some reason I had no
control over my body and suddenly coudn't move or speak. Then, out of the
corner of my eye a black, smokey, shadowy figure emergered. It came out of my
perifial vision into plane sight. This figure scared the crap out of me and I
wanted badly to scream and alert someone in the apartment of what was happening
to me but i couldn't speak much less move. The black figure seemed to talk to
my mind and sounded as tough it were using a language unknown to me prior to
this incident and its voice sounded like many voices all speaking at once yet
saying the same thing. Blasphemy and evil things were spoken and I felt like i
would suffocate. Meanwhile, I told myself that I was awake and to prove it I
started to move my eyes<span style="">&nbsp; </span>over to the
direction of the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>clock on the wall. I
began watching the time go by...I min, 2 min., 3 min., I wanted this to be over
when I remembered something my grnadmother told me when i was young. At that
time i had no idea why she was telling it to me. She said if i ever come in
contact with an evil spirit or a demon, to say the name of Jesus Christ and the
spirit would have to leave. Apon realizing this I said in my mind " help
me jesus" " jesus christ" and all of a sudden like nothing ever
happened, the thing was gone and the episode was over. I felt myself able to
move and felt relieved that I could speak. I was sweating and still watching
the clock. The whole thing had lasted no more than 10 min., but seemed like an
eternity. The entity came back a few times after that and become sexually
abusive. For some reason it always chose to show up when I was alone somewhere
wether it be in my place or someone else's. Well, I'm 20 now and have been
married for almost a year. I am also muslim now and every since I became a
muslim and got married, i haven't experienced any thing from that particular
entity anymore thank God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I have always felt
some odd connection to the spirit world.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Like somehow I have a deeper involvement than I know about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I feel an odd connection to the past and
often wonder if I lived another life in the past? I don't have any major
encounter's like some of the stories I have read here but I still feel what I
have experienced<span style="">&nbsp; </span>is worth noting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is long because it has great sentiment
to me and to do the experience justice you need the whole story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My family history
wasn't by any means the picture of perfection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother was never very maternal and when I was a child I was fortunate
to have my grandmother to provide me with love and nouturing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandma Avis (my dads mom) lived with us
when I was little. In </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">England</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> the cost of living is high and so when my
parents married they purchased a house with her so that everyone could have a
big spacious house.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Anyway my dad ran
his own business and was never home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
know he loved me very much but he was so driven to succeed and be wealthy--to
live the wealthy lifestyle that it was all he did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On many occasions he had asked my grandmother
to "make sure </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="">Petra</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style=""> is O.k" as my mother would be side-tracked by her horses and
animals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember hearing this
statement many times in the first 11 years of my life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Now as you may of
guessed my mother eventually tired of a marriage to a workaholic alcoholic and
decided that she need to start a new life for herself and me in Canada.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was planned for us to leave and come to
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Canada</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
was excited about the move, the thought of hot summers and winter snow in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Canada</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> was very cool to an eleven year old girl who
lives in rural </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="">Cornwall</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style=""> </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">England</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">As the time
approached I spent more time with my grandmother who was devastated that her
only grandchild be leaving her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
remember one morning my dad coming into my grandmas side of the house with me
and saying "mom you'll take care of her right? I can always count on you
to take care of her right?".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both
grandma and I had heard him ask this many times before and so she agreed as
usual and he left for work after giving us kisses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Later that afternoon
I was playing house with my dolls in my grandmas caravan and listening to the
song "fame" on tape. ( 1981) I suddenly had a thought ( it was very
matter of factly) dads dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just like
that I thought it, and my response to the thought was nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like someone telling you "the toasts
ready"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>well of course the toasts
done, I heard it pop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went back to
what I was doing and about an hour later the police arrived to tell my mother
and grandmother of my fathers suicide.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That moment in the caravan is etched in my mind some 25 years later, I
knew all along and was not surprised by the thought of his death or the actual
news from the police.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">After all was done
with we did still come to Canada, we had nothing as my father had made some bad
business decisions and lost everything which was the reason for his
suicide...pride. We left behind my poor grandmother with a husband lost to the
war, no son, and no grandchild to seek comfort in.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was twelve and really did not appreciate
what she must of suffered in this dark time of her life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a rough go of it over the next ten
years of my life as grandma was across the ocean in the most important years to
guide me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We kept in touch of course and
as the years passed and I grew mature we became close again as we where when I
was little.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She wasn't like your typical
"old lady"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>she never passed
judgement on my mistakes but instead encouraged me to learn from them and be
stronger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She saw me through some really
dark hours when I thought my destiny would be the same as my fathers.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We spoke every other weekend on the
phone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was overjoyed by the arrival
of her first great grandchild James (one of those mistakes she never judged)
and told me that she felt me growing stronger everyday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two years later I married James' father but
she was too sick to travel for the wedding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then when our son was 3 I found out I was pregnant again, she was excited
for us and again went on about how strong I was becoming with my husband<span style="">&nbsp; </span>at my side.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As my pregnancy came close to end I told her I would call her as soon as
I got out of recovery (caesarean births) and she said not to worry about that
and to focus on the baby, she said you are so strong now, I'm so proud of you,
and your dad would be proud too of the woman you have become.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a touching moment for me as my heart
always ached for the father I never got to have.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">One week later my
grandmother died and my world fell apart.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One week after her death I gave birth to a baby girl and with this I
found her again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I came home from the
hospital and sat nursing the baby in the rocking chair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt a coldness behind me to the right and
the hairs on my neck stood up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the
most intense feeling I have ever had in my life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was her and I have no doubt in my mind
about that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I spoke out loud and told
her I knew she was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I fed that
baby for the next month with that feeling around me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only in that chair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know why she was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told my dad she would always take care of
me and she did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She spent her whole life
thinking of me once he died. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I found out later
that she had been sick for some time before her death but did not want to cause
me worry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was 97 years old and I
honestly think she lived that long because of that promise she made to my
dad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She came back after she died to
make sure that I was o.k and that I had the strength to live out my life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I did not have that strength I honestly
think her ghost would have stayed with me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She only came around during the first moth of my daughters<span style="">&nbsp; </span>life till she had the answer she needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was right, I am strong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm strong because of her love over the
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hope she has all the lost loves
of her life back, her husband and my dad.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I still miss her and it was 4 years ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Amazing how love can
have such power over us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">This is my long tale
of love and in my heart I believe that there is still more to come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I was laying on my
bed watching TV with my husband a few nights ago when I rolled over and asked
"What?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My husband gave me a
strange look.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked me who I was
talking to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told him my 15-year-old
daughter had just called me mommy like she was going to ask me something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She always calls me mama or mommy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked at me strange again and told me my
daughter had just left for the store and wouldnt be home for at least 20
minutes more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard her voice clear
and as if she were standing right behind me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">This morning, right
at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="6"><span style="">6am</span></st1:time><span style="">, I woke to my 10-year-old daughters voice
calling me mama loud and clear as if she were in my room and was looking for
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in a dead sleep, heard that
and sat right up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I noticed that there
were no lights on in the main floor of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went upstairs and saw her light on, called
her and asked if she had just called me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She told me she hadn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
just climbing out of bed and even if she had called me from her bed I wouldnt
have heard her from mine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I wanted to thank
you for posting my story....it's not everyday you can tell someone that and
have them believe it......much less...put it on a website so others can see
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wonder if you have had much
experience with all of the many sightings in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="">St Augustine</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many
of the ghost stories there are not only shocking but amazing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I have another
experience I would like to share with you.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It happened to a friend of mine and because I have shared an interest
about phenomenon, she shared her story with me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It happened several years ago while we were still in school around 1992
I believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She shared this with me after
an episode at her own house which she also believed to be haunted by a little
girl...I could share that story as well, but I don't want to come across as
somone who is making this all up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>even
to myself to have so many experiences without being a full fledged ghost hunter
is pretty rare...maybe I attract them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyways....the story she shared with me disturbed me very deeply....She
told me one morning as she walked to the bus stop....back then we had to be at
the bus stop very early..it usually was just before dawn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her bus stop happed to be about a half mile
from her house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told me as she
walked about half way she noticed a few things....the street lights which were
usuallu on at this time were going out....it was still dark.....they started
behind her..and then they started to all go out....having a slight fear of the
dark already, she quickened her pace only to be stopped dead in her tracks by
fear....she heard a voice whisper her name from somewhere off to the
side.....she froze....but then got the courage to put one foot in front of the
other, she began to walk again....then she heard it again....louder and more
distinct....she froze again..this time she couldn't move at all...whatever it
was had her frozen stiff....she turned to face it...not by her own power. what
she described to me was to me the epitome of absolute evil...she described a
man shape in the bushes....blackish in color with deep eyes....no clothes.....a
voice that could stop time......I believe she was in the presence of an actual
demon..she said that he started by saying her name again......he stared at
her..almost straight through her....he told her that he had come for
her......if it had not been for the car of a friend that stopped to ask her if
she wanted a ride, I nelieve he would have taken her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told her friends mother about the figure,
and she called the police..they came out and of course found nothing but a
burned patch of grass where he was standing.....Until that day I had always
believed that if you were singled out by a demon that wanted you ...there was
nothing you could do to stop it...from that day...she has had no contact again
by that same entity......<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I can't really
describe my experiences with ease, because most people in my own family say I'm
nuts and things like that..But I've read all of your stories so I'll share some
of mine. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The first experience
I had was just after the christmas of 2004, I was watching tv in my brother's
room. My room was 'attached' to my brother's, it was just a door at the end of
his room. I'd left the door open, and it made me uneasy, it felt like there was
something in there. (my brother wasn't home then) Suddenly, I heard heavy
footsteps and breathing coming from in there. I tried to ignore it, but it just
got louder. So I shut the tv off and ran downstairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I 'accidentally'
fell asleep on the couch that night,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was too afraid to go back upstairs. I woke up at 4 in the morning and my fat
cat, Cajun was sitting on my stomach. I pushed him off onto the floor, when I
noticed how cold the room was. My arm was covered in goosebumps and Cajun
started acting funny. A transparent-looking cat appeared, and walked across the
room, all the while looking at me. Cajun's fur was on end, so I knew that he
saw it too. The ghost cat vanished suddenly, but the room remained icy cold..Maybe
it was just the cold winter night, but I believe I saw something. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">And that wasn't the
last strange thing to happen..The ghost cat apparition appeared two more times,
and items disappeared and reappeared. The most recent thing to happen was this:
One day, I had gone up to my room to get something, when Heard it. It sounded
like something was rummaging through the drawers in there. The door was closed
so I couldn't see in, but I blamed mom. I opened the door, and the noised
stopped..nobody was there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My little sister
told me once that she had heard a loud smashing noise once when she was home
alone. She said that she had run downstairs to see what it was, but nothing
appeared to be broken. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Me and my sister
seem to be the only ones who have seen or heard this entity. But I believe
something besides my family resides in this house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">We say that my house
is haunted and here is why...<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">One day my dad was
home with my brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My two sisters,
mom and i were shopping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents
don't think that ghosts are real and don't think of that stuff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My brother was
upstairs on the computer, playing a computer game that he can't get away
from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My dad was downstairs in his work
room making something (Can't remember).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyways he has a saw that has a guard on the end of the cord that so you
can't start it, and it wasn't plugged in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He has many other tools too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
the sudden the saw started going and my dad told Chris to cut it out and stop
turning it on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brother walked to the
top of the steps and asked my dad "Wha are you talking about?<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have been up here the whole
time."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So my dad walked in his work
room and the saw was plugged in and running!!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He turned it off and stopped working rest of the day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Another story...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">One day my oldest
sister just got home from high school.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My parents were gone and she was home alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She makes home-ade bread for communion Sunday
at church and was making some just for the heck of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the sudden she heard someone walking down
our hallway so she went and checked what was up. She didn't find anything so
she started baking again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she heard
someone talking in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
she set the bowl of bread on the door of the oven that was on and laying down
so it was horizontal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went to go
check and nothing, again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went back
in and the bread was sitting on top of the stove and the oven door was shut!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She ran to church until my parents came
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Another...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My middle sister
sleeps in our basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She has seen
ghosts in our house before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night
she was sleeping and awoke to a little girl standing on the end of her bed
looking out the very small window at the top of the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister wasn't scared at all, but when she
told me what she looked like i got VERY scared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">She said she looked
like she was 6 or 7 and she was wearing a white gown (actually all of her was
white). She had long hair too but she never showed her face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister said that she was never scared
because she said that she has seen her a lot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told my sister
that one time I have seen her too. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I was downstairs
watching TV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned to a commercial
and I had to go to the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So i
got up and was going to go into my sister&#8217;s room (downstairs she has a bathroom
connected onto her room).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When i walked
in I saw a girl with no feet floating there in the doorway with long hair and a
gown on.&lt; AN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She wouldn't show her face then i turned
around and ran upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister says
she can here her do stuff at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is really scary.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well
those are all true stories. There is more but I will tell them later.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Emily K<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The house located
near the </span><st1:PlaceName><span style="">Flat</span></st1:PlaceName><span style=""> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="">River</span></st1:PlaceType><span style=""> in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="">Greenville</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style=""> has had three fatalitys. One shot himself in
the type basement and another hung himself inside one of the bedrooms. The last
died of a sudden desease. In the ball room a chair rolled across the floor and
the same with a few toys. We checked to see if the floor was level and just
like we expected it was level. Our doors started slamming, knocks on the wall,
cold spots and many more. I expirenced something I will never forget in this
house. Up our steps they creaked, every single one and voices saying "Who
is this?". My stereo system blared suddenly as they were speaking. The
stereo play "Highway to Hell" by ACDC. I checked the station and it
suddenly unplugged. A couple years after I switched my bedroom and moved my
stuff near a bathroom were a mirror was in sight. I took one glance at it and I
saw a body, not dead but checking out its clothes and it was a person in a
black tuxedo and suitcase. Then I looked away because the door slammed shut. I
scared myself to sleep and the next day the door was open again with the mirror
moved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The Hensel Haunting<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My grandfather was
in the Air Force so growing up, my dad and his siblings moved around a lot.
When my dad was about 16 years old, my grandfather got re-located to a very small
town called Hensel (which is near </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="">London</span></st1:City><span style="">,</span><st1:State><span style="">Ontario</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="">). They ended up living in the biggest house in Hensel; a mansion with a
huge wrought iron fence going around it, a lovely nice cut green lawn and the
house was pretty much eye candy for the locals and visitors of Hensel. So when
my dad's family moved in, the real-estate agent let them know that the house
used to be a funeral parlour circa early 1900's (explains why the house is so
large). This didn't bother my grandma or grandpa (espescially my grandpa, a
very stern,cold man). However, it wasn't long after they moved in that strange
things started happening...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">For starters, the
house always had a "creepy feeling about it" (according to my
grandma) and my grandma, dad,aunts and uncles all agree that the house was
DEFINITELY haunted (my grandpa simply refuses to believe in anything
supernatural so everytime we talk about the Hensel house he always scoffs at us
and brushes all the ev ts off as "crap"). <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Strange things would
happen like hearing clear,pronounced footsteps from the back-stair case (there
were two staircases: the main one and the back one that led from the kitchen to
the 2nd floor). My grandma says this happened frequently and she'd always wake
up my grandpa to go check it out. He'd go and always come back reporting that
all the kids were in bed so she must have been hearing things. Other things
would happen like the lights going on in the living room in the middle of the
night. The lights were the type that were directly on the wall and were very small,
glass tear-drop shaped lights. Out of nowhere, they'd just come on. Since my
grandparents room was on the 2nd floor and right at the top of the staircase,
anytime the lights in the very big living room came on, they'd illuminate the
whole stairwell, the 2nd floor hallway and of course my grandparents bedroom.
This would obviously frighten my grandma since she knew everyone was in bed and
of course she or my grandpa would go check it out and they'd find no one down
there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Another time my
grandma said that she was lying watching TV in the family room one night when
she heard a knock at the front door. She thought this was pretty strange since
they have a doorbell but she figured maybe she didn't hear the doorbell over
the TV. She heard my aunt Lori coming down the stairs to answer the door and
after a few seconds Lori came in into the family room. My grandma asked Lori
who was at the door and Lori said no one was there. They didn't think anything
of this incident until it started happening frequently.My grandpa obviously
brushed it off as just teenagers playing pranks but that theory went kaput when
my dad was heading upstairs one night when he heard the same knock at the door.
My dad went to answer the door but before he could open it, my grandpa came in
the front door,startling my dad. My dad asked him why the hell he was knocking
on the door and my grandpa replied that he wasn't. My dad explained to him that
he just heard a knocking on the front door and my grandpa said that's totally
crap because he saw no one there as he was heading up the front steps. This is
when my grandma and my aunts and uncles really started to figure that the house
was indeed haunted. Things started getting a little scarier because soon
apparitions started to form. One night, my aunt Christine (who was about 5 at
the time) ran crying into my Aunt Lori's room (who was about 11-12 at the
time). She said that she was lying in her bed when suddenly a young boy
appeared at the foot of her bed. Christine turned on her bedside table lamp,
hoping the apparition would go away but he didn't. Christine (who is now in her
late 30's) said that the boy was very sickly looking; pale,veiny and was
wearing what appeared to be a nightgown. My aunt Christine said she was too
terrifed to even speak and the boy was just staring at her and apparently
mouthed the words to her "Am I Dying?". The boy then turned and left
the room and that's when Christine noticed that the boy wasn't life-like...in
the sense that he seemed to almost glide out of the room instead of walk. This
happened a few other times to Christine but one that was very interesting was
my dad (who is the oldest sibling) was babysitting his younger siblings (my
aunt Lori, my twin uncles Bob and </span><st1:PersonName><span style="">Bill</span></st1:PersonName><span style="">, my aunt Christine and my Uncle Steve, who was
a baby at the time). My aunt Christine said she was upstairs playing in her
room when the young boy appeared in her doorway. Christine got up enough
courage to ask the boy what his name was and the boy whispered in a shaky,weezy
voice "Joseph Cremwall". The boy then turned and disappeared. This
was the last time my aunt ever saw the boy but she did run downstairs and tell
my dad what she saw. My dad mentioned it to my grandma when my grandparnets got
home and my grandma said she'd look into it. My grandma asked the real-estate
agent if she could check up on any re rds of a young boy named Joseph Cremwall
who either lived in the house before them or was a boy whose body had been kept
at the funeral parlour. The real-estate agent reluctantly agreed to check
records and after a week or so she notified my grandma that indeed a 7 year old
boy named Joseph Cremwall's body had been kept in the mortuary and his funeral
was held at the funeral parlour in 1921. The boy had died of tuberculosis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Other strange apparitions
had been seen over the course of their 3 years living there, one of a teenage
girl, a young woman and an older man. Heavy footsteps were heard on a regular
basis coming from the back staircase and muffled talking and moaning could be
heard coming from the basement. Things would happen like cold spots, getting
goosebumps for no reason and hearing the TV go on in the middle of the night.
The only thing that my grandpa will even admit to is that sometimes the aroma
of copper (and if you'd ever tasted blood, it tastes like metal) would come out
of nowhere. My uncle </span><st1:PersonName><span style="">Bill</span></st1:PersonName><span style="">
said that one time the unexplicable taste of blood happened in his mouth and
when he went to spit to see if maybe he actually was bleeding, there wasn't any
blood but the taste was so strong, he actually vomited. The whole family (minus
my grandpa obviously haha) says that on more than one occasion, they'd feel
someone either tap their shoulder, grab their arm or touch their feet if they
were lying in bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">They lived in this
house for 3 years and my grandma says that it was 3 years of pure unexplainable
events and that there was no doubt in her mind that the house was definitely
haunted!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Two years ago, my
aunt Lori and uncle Larry were driving up to </span><st1:City><span style="">London</span></st1:City><span style="">, </span><st1:State><span style="">Ontario</span></st1:State><span style=""> to
visit my cousin Jordan at the </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceType><span style="">University</span></st1:PlaceType><span style=""> of </span><st1:PlaceName><span style="">Western Ontario</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place><span style="">. Lori decided they'd stop off in Hensel so
she could show Larry the haunted house she lived in. They went to the house and
lucky for them, the owners of the house (a young couple with 3 children) were
very gracious and let Lori and Larry come in and look around. Lori finally got
up the courage to ask the owners if they ever had anything strange happen in
the house.. When the young woman asked Lori what she meant by that, Lori
explained that when she lived there, they found the house to be haunted. The
young woman's face grew very surprised and she and her husband admitted that
they thought the house was definitely haunted too! She said that one day, a
couple of days after they moved in, she was moving in a desk into one of the
guest bedrooms and was startled to see the apparition of someone lying in the
bed. She thought it to be one of her children and when she got closer she
realised it was a young boy (and they have 3 daughters). The woman got too
scared and backed out of the room yelling for her husband. When her husband ran
upstairs, they both heard the sound of what they think to be a young boy
yelling out "Don't leave me!". They approached the guest bedroom and
when they looked in, the apparition was not there anymore. The woman claims
this is the most bizarre thing that has happened, the others are just events of
things like lights turning on for no reason, hearing heavy footsteps coming
from the back staircase(!!!) and sensing a presence. My aunt Lori thinks that
maybe the apparition the young woman saw was the ghost of Joseph Cremwall
again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Anyways I'm sorry
that story is long but I wanted to include details for you. Hope you enjoyed
it!:) It's pretty spooky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">This might come
under the above heading as a poltegeist, but here's a personal experience I had
at my father's home in </span><st1:place><span style="">West Roxbury</span></st1:place><span style="">
MA..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>West Roxbury is part of the city of
</span><st1:City><span style="">Boston</span></st1:City><span style="">, which is in the southwest corridor of the
city and this also borders the town of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="">Dedham</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well
this is what happened, it was during the winter of 2000 and I was getting ready
for work one morning that I think that a poltegeist might have picked up a
coffee mug which sitting on the second shelf against the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now mind you we do live down the street from
a commuter rail station,but now train had gone by when this incident had
occurred.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">This coffee mug was
somehow picked up and dropped onto the floor in our pantry, I was no where near
the pantry when this had occurred.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Earlier that year my mother had just passed away in the spring of the
year 2000, this may and may not have any significance to this occurance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although my mother did like to have cup of
coffee and a cigarette as she read her books, she would read all night at our
kitchen table or on the couch in our living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I just thought this
would be an interesting story to share with someone, any way its a good story
for Halloween.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ghost light<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">By:
lfsim@gbronline.com <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I have always loved
ghost stories whether true or false they are always fun to hear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I really believe there is something out there
but never have been lucky or unlucky enough to have had my own experience with
the supernatural.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is until I was
about 20 years old (1990).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had just watched
an "Unsolved Mysteries" show on ghost lights and was amazed that
after all I watch and read on supernatural occurrences that I had never heard
of these.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had told my friend
"Terri" about the show because she likes that kind of stuff too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not a month or two later she returned from
college in Northeast Oklahoma and she told me her roommate and some friends
took her to see a ghost light and if I would come visit they would take me
there to see it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was apprehensive when
she told me and can't say that I really believed her too much.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said ok and that was it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next visit I made up there they took me
to a place way out in the boonies. Way out on the horizon was a light that
looked like a street light that looked several miles away. We were on this back
on the border of </span><st1:State><span style="">Oklahoma</span></st1:State><span style=""> and </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="">Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style=""> and this light just was not that
impressive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sat there for a little
while and suddenly the light was getting closer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before I knew it, it was so near to the car
that it had lighted the interior and I could see everything in the cars floor
board with out any other light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
trees outside the car were lit up and it was glaring off the car hood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was speechless!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a flash the light had returned to its
original spot looking several miles away!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It started dancing back and forth on the horizon and then to our
amazement it started shooting little balls of many different colors out of it
like a roman candle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The little balls of
light sort of shot out of the top of the large ball of white light and fell
down the sides of the large ball extinguishing after a few seconds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The little balls were red, yellow, green and
blue and in no exact order as they came.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All the while the large ball kept approaching the car and would come all
the way to the front edge of the car and illuminate the interior again and
again but zip back to its original location after a bit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was so fast you didn't even realize that
it had moved until you saw it way off again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I asked my friend if it was always this active.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They said they had been out there several
times and it had never shot off the balls of light before nor was it ever this
active.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were there for 45 minutes to
an hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They said it only lasted about
20 minutes before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I like to think it
was showing off for me but even so it is the most spectacular thing I've ever
seen!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not sure of the exact
location of the place and my friend "Terri" said she always let her
room mate drive so she is not exact on where it is either so I have not been
able to go back out there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Terri"
said the last time they went out there someone in a pick up truck chased them
off and tried to run them off the road so she really doesn't want to go back
anyway!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oh well, I will never forget the
night I saw my one and only spook light and it was great!!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My Grandma's House<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Hi again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I submitted a story about the apartment I
used to live in a few weeks ago, but I have another story about the house my
family and I are currently living in, which is my grandmother's.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I'm not sure what to
make of it, but I think the house my family and I currently live in may be
haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We've been living there almost
two years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">First of all, my
great-grandparents (my dad's grandparents were living there, then passed away
at that house before I was born. Then, when I was 7 yrs. old, my grandfather
passed away in the same house of cancer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I remember that, because my parents and I spent the night there the
night he died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm not sure, but
sometimes I think the house is haunted, and other times I'm not so sure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's been months since I've heard any noises
or felt anything unusual, but that's how it's been.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another important note:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my grandma doesn't live there, she lives with
her boyfriend in Castroville (a small town 30 min. away).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She's only there every few weeks, and stays
for one night, then goes back to Castroville.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyway, a couple weeks after we moved in, my husband said he wasn't sure
if it was his imagination, but he sometimes heard footsteps in the kitchen late
at night, after everyone was asleep, and he was the only one up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hadn't heard anything-yet, until a few
weeks after he told me that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Another thing that
happened was I found a cabinet door opened in the laundry room, when no one had
been in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My son couldn't have
reached it, because it's too high.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
early one morning, I heard noise in the kitchen/laundry room, and footsteps
too!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was really scared, too scared to
investigate, so I just sat up in bed, and listened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, everyone else was sleeping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband was also awake in bed one night
(while everyone was asleep), and I happened to wake up too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked me, "Did you see
that?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't see anything, so I
asked him what he saw, and he said he saw a something round and black hovering
about 4 ft. from the ground in the doorway.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said he thought it was a spider, but it was too big.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he said after a few seconds, it kinda
vibrated and dashed away real fast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">He dismissed<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as his imagination, due to the fact he was so
tired, and so did I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few months later,
my 7-yr. old son said he saw a "foot shadow"<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">floating back and
forth in front of his door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His door was
closed, and we were still in bed, but he said he saw it through the crack under
the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I told him he was
dreaming, but he said he was awake, and insisted that's what he saw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've never SEEN anything directly, but
occasionally I've seen a figure walk by in another room from my peripheral
vision, when I know I'm the only adult in the house. (The figure is too tall to
be my son, but a little shorter than my husband.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And of course, when I look directly at where
I saw it, no one is around.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I told a friend at
work about my grandma's house, and she let me borrow her digital camera for the
evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took several pictures (all at
night), and several orbs came out in some of the pictures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'll have to send those if I can find
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one of them, there's an orb
that appears to have a face resembling my grandfather's!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Then late one night
when my husband was away at a DJ gig, I was asleep and woke to the STRONG
feeling that I was not alone in the room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I didn't have a dream or anything, I just suddenly awoke, startled, and
my heart was pounding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It felt like
there was another presence in the room with me, and I scanned the room good,
but I didn't see anyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was really
weird, and I've never had that happen to me before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't like that feeling at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt scared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">It's been months
since anything out of the ordinary has happened, but recently while I was lying
in bed (my kids were alseep and my husband was at work), I kept hearing noises
in the kitchen/laundry area again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
took me a while to fall asleep, and I was a little scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was worried someone was trying to get in
the house, but was too scared to get up and look, so I took a golf club and put
it next the the bed!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The weird thing is,
we finally purchased a digital camera recently, and took several photos in the
house, with no orbs appearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, the
pictures were all taken during the day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I'm going to take a few pictures at night to see if anything comes
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked my grandma about the house,
and she said it's not haunted, and nothing's ever happened there, and she's
never heard nor seen anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I even
told my dad, and he says the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Does
anyone have any ideas?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The Spirit Photo<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">By:
medium12003@yahoo.com.au<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">This took place at
my daughter's wedding in May 2005.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Her grandad died
back in 1986 and I have felt him and heard him communicate with me a few times
over the years. His side of the family are sceptics which is a pity because he
has tried to communicate with them directly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">After the wedding
ceremony both sides of the family posed outdoors for informal digital photos
taken on my new camera. My sister in law (grandad's daughter) took 3 photos,
seconds apart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Weeks later I went
to look at the photos to print out. I decided the first photo looked the best
in the thumbnail sample so I printed that one. I looked at it and noticed a
translucent white partial sphere next to my daughter -the Bride's- head! It has
a slightly chubby shape to it and is at the height grandad was. The two photos
taken seconds later don't have the sphere in them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I did wonder at the
time if it was my deceased dad in the pic or my father in law (grandad) but
when I started showing it around I soon got the answer. I literally just met a
Korean lady at the shops via a mutual friend and she took one look and said
"It's your father in law, he looks like your husband" just like that!
It made sense. The sphere appeared next to the bride, on the side of the
in-laws and was snapped by the appropriate daughter!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Another week went by
and I had<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a dream that featured my dad
who let me know he was aware of the wedding in a different way. I knew then
that the sphere was indeed grandad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">We do get our messages
in funny/strange/interesting ways.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Unfortunately, the
in-laws are still sceptical, but that's the nature of scepticism, they deny any
evidence in front of them. Over the years I have done many things to convince
them that grandad exists post-death. Dreams, channellings, visions, verbal
messages and synchronicities. Now there's a photo, perhaps the most precious of
anecdotal proofs. Alas, I can't do more than that, grandad, but you are now on
the wall along with the rest of the family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Memoir number 19 &#8211;
the haunted office<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">We moved our
business premises to another office in the same town. It had been built as a 2
storey house with the option of residential or office in the 1950s.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The previous
owner/occupier was also a business and one of the rooms had been sublet to a
counselling practice. There may have been several owners before that. We
cleaned the place before moving in. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">While I was cleaning
downstairs I got a picture in my head of a thin, dark haired woman with a
rather stern face. She gave me the nonverbal impression that I must get every
spot of dirt up and gone. She was rather like a stern school ma&#8217;am from decades
ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I didn&#8217;t tell anyone
anything for a few days until a report got back to me that the painters had
seen a face n the window during there lunch break from the other side of the
street. The face appeared upstairs, and they knew that no one had entered the
building while they were there. Their description matched what I had &#8216;seen&#8217;
psychically.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Then I talked about
it. I found out later that the previous occupiers had secretaries who were
afraid to work at night because they would hear noises like a broom handle
banging on the ceiling (from upstairs) if they had the radio on too loud. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I felt that the room
that was haunted was one that ended up, after a few years, being my husband&#8217;s
office. I had already worked on the room by placing Scrabble letters in a
circle and some lavender and asking the spirit to leave a message like her
initials. I felt the initials were ND. The letters that had moved ever so
slightly overnight were MB &#8211; similar and maybe correct, as when I
"heard" the letters it could have been MB as it sounds similar. Later
I went to see the spiritualist church leader from next door (someone I actually
don&#8217;t have a lot of respect for) and she claimed the lady had died of stomach
cancer in the late fifties and she confirmed my description too. she said the
lady needed peppermint tea to soothe her (a bit late now since it was a spirit
not a body !).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I didn&#8217;t sense
anything after that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">A cleaning fetish
and stomach cancer might go together since they describe and fanatical type of
personality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My husband&#8217;s own
stomach played up more and more with work stress until he eventually left work.
He drank a lot of peppermint tea to soothe his stomach. I haven&#8217;t heard any
more about a haunting at that office. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Interesting
confirmation of sightings at least.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">When I was little,about
two years old.My family and i moved into a house in VanBuren,AR.We had the
house built and while it was under construction my mother took some
pictures.After the film came back my mother noticed that there was the shape of
an old coffin in the ground.After six or seven years living in the house it
started.In the middle of the night my sister heard footsteps going down tha
hall.But when she looked no one was there.Then when i was moving into her room
I had a sleepover.Everyone but my cousin and I went to another room.We both saw
a shadow like figure go past the doorso she sat down beside me on my bed.THen
out of nowhere we hear this sqeak coming from the other side of the room.It
sounded like someone sat down on the other bed in my room.So we turned on the
light and we saw dent in the beds mattress.About a month later the water in the
kitchin sink came on by its self.Pictures fell and drors opened with no
explanation.My mother even claimed that she heard the sound of children
laughing and running down the hall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I really love your
website and have been debating sending you my story for some time. I have
always been fascinated with hauntings and ghosts, but have never had any desire
to have direct contact with them myself. However, recent events have confirmed
that I have been in direct contact, whether I like it or not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">We came to the
conclusion that our apartment was haunted shortly before we moved out. We had
already made the decision to leave based on a number of other factors, but
realizing it was haunted sealed the deal. We'd lived there for 2 years, and
experienced stuff that can be chalked up to living in an old apartment, but
we've experienced so much of it that it just doesn't make sense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">When we first looked
at the place, I was not into it at all. I felt that it had a really creepy vibe
and the landlady was crazy. But, my husband really loved the place. So, I
agreed to move in and we both worked really hard to make it a home. The first
day we moved in, some neighborhood kids had scrawled "This is the scary
ghost house" in permanent marker on the front steps. It may seem silly,
but it certainly gave me some reservations. We rented the whole first floor and
the basement. I had been petrified of the basement since we moved in, and would
not go down there alone for months. In an attempt to 'cleanse' the apartment we
lit sage smudges and clapped out the corners, and we sprinkled holy water
everywhere. I'm sure it helped, but I'm scared to think of how things would be
if we hadn't done any of that. Every major appliance broke when we moved in. We
had inexplicable computer problems. We could never seem to get the house
'clean'. We were burglarized TWICE. We're both people with lots of riends and
we love entertaining - strangely, people wouldn't come to the apartment. Bands
would stay over, but they always stayed over once and never came back. Whenever
I put something down and then looked for it later, it was never where I put it,
and I would spend 10 minutes looking for it before it re-appeared right where I
put it down in the first place. Our bed shook in the middle of the night -
which is FRIGHTENING. It always happened when I was almost asleep, and I tried
to write it off as my imagination. We'd both had inexplicable health problems.
We were constantly tired and worn out, and we become very depressed and
negative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Finally one morning,
my husband confirmed all of my suspicions. I'd asked him before if he thought
the house is haunted, and he always said 'no'. Uncategorically denied any such
thing. So, I stopped mentioning stuff to him because I didn't want to freak
either of us out any more than we already were. However, all the same things
had been happening to him, and he confirmed that the bed shaky thing happened when
I was out of town and he was sleeping alone, too. In fact, he has seen whatever
'it' is at the top of the basement steps at least 3 times. He describes it as a
crouched old man heading back down the basement steps. He fell down the
basement steps when we first moved in, and the first weekend he was home with
crutches, I had to be out of town and he was home alone. There was no way he
could get around without the crutches, and when he woke up one morning, the
crutches weren't in the bedroom. He found them in the living room, at the other
end of the apartment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">During the last
summer we lived there, the upstairs apartment was unoccupied and being
renovated. No one was up there. One night when we were lying in bed we heard
footsteps upstairs in the room overhead. We went up to check it out and there
was no one there. We kept our cat's water and food bowls at the top of the
basement steps. The cat started waking us up at 4:00 or 5:00 and would want me
to stay with her while she ate. I think that whatever was in the house was
harassing her when she tried to eat, and if I was there it would leave her
alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Knowing all this
confirmed and explained a lot of stuff. We felt like we were struggling to keep
our heads above water. We both felt lethargic and depressed. When we would come
home, we both did a full walk of the apartment and checked every room before we
felt like we could settle in. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My only other
experience (that I am sure of) is a much more positive one. I am very close to
my stepfather and I was very close to his mother as well. I consider her my
third grandmother. She died last year, and my stepfather was devastated. We
planned to bury her ashes in the same cemetery her husband and mother are
buried in. My stepfather was in a relationship with a woman for 9 years who
died in his arms, and she is buried there as well. When we got to the cemetery,
we discovered that a plot had not been dug for my grandmother's ashes and my
stepfather couldn't remember where they were buried, or whether or not they had
head stones or flat stones. My whole family was wandering around the cemetery
reading all the head stones and trying to find where the family was buried.
Finally I asked my grandmother's mother to help me find them - where were they?
I turned around and tripped over a buried flat stone - it was the marker for my
stepfather's girlfriend who had died in his arms. All three graves were in a
row, and they were so overgrown with grass I doubt I ever would have found them
without help.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
