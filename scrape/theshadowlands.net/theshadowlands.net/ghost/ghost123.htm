<b><font size=+2>House in Ontario</font></b>
<br>By: sdheih@telusplanet.net
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I am 40 years old and have many stories to relate of personal experiences
with the supernatural since I was 12.&nbsp; Almost all
<br>have occurred in Canada; one in Montana.&nbsp; The first concerns a
house in just outside the tiny village of Ida, Ontario.&nbsp; In
<br>1972 my family was on vacation and spent a couple of nights with my
father's foster parents in their (then) 150 year old
<br>brick farmhouse.&nbsp; The room I slept in was an upstairs study in
the huge two-storey house and I remember being awakened by the sound of
footsteps walking through the room, causing the fine china and crystal
in the room to rattle.&nbsp; I distinctly remember
<br>opening my eyes to see a pair of black shoes or boots and lower pants
pass by, with nothing at all visible above them.&nbsp; I was
<br>not afraid that night; only annoyed because it had been a very long
journey that day and I was very tired.&nbsp; After I awoke in
<br>the morning and thought about it over breakfast, I went upstairs again
to check the place out.&nbsp; Whatever was haunting the
<br>place was waiting for me in the upstairs hallway and though I coudn't
actually see it, I could definitely feel it's presence
<br>between me and the library.&nbsp; I stood there for a while trying
to decide what to do; I knew for sure I wasn't going forward
<br>but I did not want to back down, either.
<br>The room I had spent the night in had two doors, one of which was adjacent
to me and the other down the hall past the
<br>presence.&nbsp; I decided I would just go around it through the room
and get to the library that way.&nbsp; As I passed through the
<br>room there was the usual noise of china rattling from the many beautiful
items on display that were disturbed by my footsteps
<br>.&nbsp; When I re-entered the hall I looked back to where the presence
was and could not feel it there anymore.&nbsp; I found out why moments
later as the sound of footsteps retraced my path through the room I had
just exited and were coming my way.&nbsp; At this point I abandoned my
exploration of the upstairs and bolted down the now empty hallway to the
stairs.
<br>I got little sleep that night as the presence decided it would be amusing
to walk back and forth past me all night,
<br>occassionally stopping to stare (glare?) at me.&nbsp; Just before we
left the next day I asked the owner about the presence
<br>upstairs, and he said that in the fifty-odd years he had lived there,
the presence had always been around.&nbsp; Him and his wife
<br>just ignored it as it never did anything dangerous.&nbsp; He figured
it was likely the ghost of the previous owner who had died
<br>years earlier, shortly before their purchase.&nbsp; There was no mention
of the house being haunted before then.&nbsp; I've never been
<br>back since, and the owners passed away several years ago.&nbsp; I do
not know the current status of the house.

<br><font size=+2>My Wifes Fathers Goodbye</font>
<p>By: Steven_Harrison@pancanadian.ca
<p>In about March of 1996 my future wife was reading in bed in her house
<br>around eleven o'clock at night.&nbsp; The kids had gone to bed and
she was
<br>not sleepy as she knew her father in Montreal, some 3 thousand miles
<br>away, was dying of cancer and she could get a call at any time to return
<br>east for the end.&nbsp; She suddenly looked up and saw her father pointing
at
<br>her from across the room, and disappearing quickly thereafter.&nbsp;
Minutes
<br>later she received a phone call from her family telling her that her
<br>father had just passed away.&nbsp; She was told that the last thing
he said
<br>(to someone) as he slipped away was "that's my daughter over there..."

<p><font size=+2>A Brief Encounter in Las Vegas</font>
<p>By: wyndrose@softhome.net
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>My experience took place in July of 1999 at the New York New York Hotel
&amp;
<br>Casino in Las Vegas. I'd heard stories of other casinos and hotels
in Las
<br>Vegas being haunted but never anything about the NYNY so I was a bit
<br>surprised.
<p>My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary by spending a night
away
<br>from the kids and by seeing the "Lord of the Dance" show at the NYNY.
We
<br>were lucky enough to also have gotten a room there for the night. We
had a
<br>great night and went to bed around 1:30 am. At 3 am I woke up to have
a
<br>cigarette and as I sat up I saw a tall dark figure standing about a
foot
<br>away from the end of the bed. I blinked a few times to make sure I
wasn't
<br>imagining it, I even rubbed my eyes but it was still there. I could
feel my
<br>husband beside me but I looked to make sure anyway. When I realized
it
<br>wasn't him I turned to look directly at the figure. It was about 6
feet tall
<br>and looked to have the build of a stocky man. I couldn't discern any
<br>features and it didn't move for several seconds. As I stared it seemed
to
<br>dissipate, fading away from the head down. Oddly, I wasn't afraid nor
did I
<br>feel threatened. I felt a sense of peace from it as though whoever
it was
<br>had only our safety and best interests at heart.
<p>I know that I was awake because I was sitting up, my eyes were open
and I
<br>could hear my husband snoring away. I've had other experiences in the
past
<br>involving hearing footsteps and seeing doors close but this is the
first
<br>time I've ever seen a figure. Both of my parents have had experiences
with
<br>spirits but I seem to be the only child of theirs that has too.
<p>By the way, the NYNY is a very nice hotel and the show was amazing,
if you
<br>get a chance don't miss it!

<p><font size=+2>A Few Weird Experiences</font>
<p>By: brenda.carradus@sympatico.ca
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Like many other people's stories that I've read, I've had my share of
<br>experiences with the paranormal. The first time was when I was about
7,
<br>I was lying in bed, not quite asleep, I watched a disembodied green
hand
<br>with long sharp nails float in through my bedroom door and just sort
of
<br>hover there and then it turned around and disappeared. Needless to
say I
<br>screamed until my mother came. Another experience that I had was also
<br>when I was little. I&nbsp; lived in an old house, about 50 yrs old
. I would
<br>be again lying in bed and I would watch my doll high chair float and
<br>spin, even if there was a doll left in it, the doll wouldn't fall out.
I
<br>know it seems strange but when this happens as soon as my mother would
<br>put me to bed and then leave, every night for 2 years. I learned not
to
<br>mention it to my mother because she just doesn't believe in this sort
of
<br>thing.
<p>Another experience, my dog Cappy had just been hit by a car and died.
I
<br>was distraught and couldn't stop crying in bed that night (I was 18).
I
<br>went to bed that night and I heard his collar faintly jingling as though
<br>he was walking down the hall. All of a sudden I felt something jump
on
<br>the end of the bed and could see an indentation as though Cappy was
<br>walking on the bed. It finally stopped and looked like Cappy had laid
<br>down beside me and was saying goodbye. I fell asleep comforted thinking
<br>he was with me.
<p>I also have those black apparatitions out of the corner of my eyes that
<br>disappear when you look at them. I freaked out and went to the eye
<br>doctor and he didn't seem too concerned but I still have them. They
are
<br>unsettling.
<p>Premonitionary dreams are my forte. I feel like Nostradamus. Everything
<br>I dream, either happens the next day or a couple of days later. This
is
<br>the scariest. Because no matter what happens, I'm powerless to stop
it,
<br>even though I know something is happening that I've dreamt about. I
have
<br>had too many experiences to recount here or you would never receive
<br>this.
<p>I have always thought that I was a little different and don't quite
fit
<br>in with everyone else that I was growing up with, especially when I
used
<br>to describe their auras. I could see people's energies radiating off
<br>them and in such brilliant colours. As I've gotten older I have to
<br>concentrate and sometimes just see a faint glow. When I was little
I
<br>thought everybody could see them. But I was wrong.
<p>I have one last story to relate to you about my daughter. I really think
<br>that she could be psychic or something. When she was about 2 years
old,
<br>I separated from her father. He moved out of our house and into the
<br>basement apartment of his friends townhouse. I should explain that
at 2
<br>years old my daughter couldn't speak well because she was tongue tied,
<br>she had too much tissue holding her tongue down and as such couldn't
<br>pronounce very many words that involved moving her tongue. When I used
<br>to bring her over to her father's on the weekends she would run to
one
<br>particular corner of the room and talk to the corner. She would call
it
<br>ghostie and babble to whatever it was for the entire time we were there.
<br>Nothing could drag her away from that corner. Everytime we went there,
<br>this went on. I was getting a little spooked because she would talk
to
<br>it, having actual conversations and she would pause and answer
<br>questions. This went on for about 4 months. Then she started talking
to
<br>"ghostie" at our house. Always in a corner. I was getting really spooked
<br>at this time. After awhile she started running away and screaming that
<br>the ghostie was following her, and I mean she was terrified, screaming
<br>and crying all the time. For about a year this "ghostie" followed her,
<br>from her dad's to my house to my mother's and even to school. and then
<br>it stopped. About 5 years later I had found out (after my ex's friends
<br>moved out of the townhouse) that a previous owner of the house had
hung
<br>himself in that exact basement corner she had started talking to
<br>ghostie.
<br>Even now, my daughter refuses to talk about it and she's 13. She can
<br>also find an injured animal from a mile away. They gravitate towards
<br>her. I have seen rottweillers who attack their owners run up to her
and
<br>lay down on their backs waiting for her to rub their stomach. Any wild
<br>animal just lays down in front of her. Very strange.
<p>Anyway I should stop taking up so much space and time. Thanks for
<br>listening.

<br><font size=+2>My Birds Goodbye!</font>
<p>By: cmcmillen@earthlink.net
<p>We were living in Beverly Hills at the time and I was 10 or maybe 9.
Anyway, my parents were out buying a car. I'm a bird
<br>person and I've always had one, but he was too loud so I took him to
my parents room and locked him in there. With the door
<br>shut and locked, I watched TV until I was ready to sleep. It was dark
and my parents weren't home yet. I walked into my room,
<br>&nbsp;turned on the light, and saw a blue bird singing to the mirror
on the floor. I was freaked, because he didn't have the
<br>markings MY bird had. I went into my parents room to see if he had
escaped and my eyes were playing tricks, but my bird was
<br>still there, on the bed, resting. I went back to my room and there
was nothing there. The thing is, it wasn't mine, no one
<br>had one such as mine in the building, and the bird by the mirror looked
exactly like the one that had died 2 years before.
<br>So, was I visited by a ghost? I think so.

<br><font size=+2>Ghost in Conn.</font>
<p>By:info@ritscars.com
<p>&nbsp;I know about 3 ghosts not on your list.One is in the Bristol Polish
American
<br>Citizens Club in Bristol,Conn. He hangs out in the bingo room and some
times moves chairs around.I know about it becouse I
<br>am a member of the club.I have never seen him but many others have.Another
[actually 2] are in the mile long railroad tunnel
<br>in Terryville or Plymouth,Conn.I know about these 2 becouse I saw them
once.They are the silloettes of 2 men digging with
<br>shovels,and when you get close enough to start making out detail of
them they disappear.I have been in this tunnel about 50
<br>&nbsp;times when I used to ride a dirt bike but only saw the ghosts
once and that time I was walking.Against your advice I have
<br>taken my neice there to look for them but havn't seen them again.I
later found out that 2 men were killed by a cave in while
<br>&nbsp;they were digging the tunnel.I didn't believe in ghosts until
I saw these 2.There was also another ghost in Masssechusettes
<br>&nbsp;in a house on Rt.8 near Colebrook Dam.One time I was driving
by,by myself when a bottle in my car jumped into the air and
<br>crashed onto the floor of my car.This house was later moved and heard
stories from others that the house was haunted,thus
<br>being vacant.Also they told me that one or more people were murdered
in this house and buried in a local grave yard with
<br>tomb stones describing them as murder victims.

<br><font size=+2>Ghosts In My Life</font>
<p>By: lisamayer@home.com
<p>I feel like I've been visited by many ghosts in my life. When I was
<br>about four, I slept on the top bunk sharing a bedroom with my brother
<br>and sister. I cant even tell you how many times it happened because
it
<br>happened a lot. But I would wake up in the middle of the night and
call
<br>out for my mom and dad. Instead, usually I would witness a
<br>figure...sometimes man, sometimes woman, walk to the edge of my bed
and
<br>then disappear. I was never afraid of this. Being a kid, I think I
<br>thought this was just normal. When I got older, it was then that I
<br>realized what I was experiencing. The supernatural.
<p>When I was about 20, I lived with a boyfriend in an apartment in the
<br>city real close to six flags over Texas. We moved there during the
night
<br>and I spent most the night unpacking. My boyfriend went to work about
<br>6:30 am and after that I decided to finally sleep. I curled up in my
bed
<br>and was asleep for about an hour when I drempt of walking through the
<br>apartment and hearing a loud noise, like a storm or something. I watched
<br>as a huge demon rose out of the floor and said in his ugly, demonic
<br>voice, "I want you, lisa." I tried to shake myself awake but instead
<br>drempt the same scenerio again. When I finally woke up I felt like
I
<br>couldn't move. It took several moments until I could regain myself.
<br>My sleep was continuously restless there. I usually was by myself when
I
<br>had these experiences, but not always. I would here people talking
to
<br>me, or hear my boyfriends guitar playing unusual music (the house was
<br>always silent during these times...at least I didnt have any noise
<br>going) Sometimes I would hear hot breath on my ear as "it " whispered
to
<br>me as I slept. One time during my sleep the bed started shaking up
and
<br>down like a scene out of the excorsist.
<p>Several times the television would come on by itself. My brother and
<br>sister stayed with me sometimes and they began to experience the same
<br>kind of things. We would feel "someone was behind us." as we sat on
the
<br>couch...and later we began to see apparations. One time a yellowish
<br>figure, another time a greyish color. It got to the point where all
of
<br>us were getting really scared. I even went to church and talked with
a
<br>priest. He told me to anoit the place. So my sister , boyfriend and
I
<br>prayed over oil and then decorated the walls in it. Praying as we went,
<br>as if we were in a trance of some kind. After about 15 minutes of us
all
<br>walking around praying, we all three automatically went to the front
<br>door to "let the spirit out." The ghostly&nbsp; activities diminished
some,
<br>but not completely. We moved out shortly after. (we found out at one
<br>point that somebody had committed suicide in our building...Im guessing
<br>that was whom the ghost was! )
<p>One of my favorite stories happened in a spooky house my boyfriend
<br>(then) and I moved into. The house was so creepy that there was a door
<br>to the right of the garage that had all this junk in it. The room was
<br>huge! But as much as I wanted to explore...I never could...something
<br>kept me from it. I believe this place somehow "drew" spirits to it.
<br>It was only a couple weeks after Kirt Cobains death, singer of Nirvana.
<br>I was not really much into them but thought that Kirts death was a
<br>stupid, stuipid thing. He had so much going for him...so much! And
it
<br>just reminded me how I thought that anyone whom killed themselves was
<br>doomed to "something worse." So I wrote a poem about it in the silence
<br>of the night. The boyfriend was asleep and so were the dogs, and as
<br>unusual as it was I didn't even have any rock n roll going. I finished
<br>the poem after about fifteen minutes and then read it aloud to myself.
<br>As soon as I finished it, I heard three raps coming from what sounded
<br>like it was inside the wall. I freaked out and went downstairs near
the
<br>"spooky hidden room, with all the junk," and curled up in bed&nbsp;
next to
<br>my boyfriend and fell fast asleep. About an hour later I woke up to
<br>hear, "LISA...LISA!" I swear to you to this day it was Kirt Cobain
<br>hovering over my head, about four inches from my face...with his whispy
<br>blonde hair and boyish face! I shook my head as if to shake myself
from
<br>the image but it never faded! Finally I fell back asleep...even though
I
<br>was totally tripped out. Later I told my little brother who went to
high
<br>school then, and he was saying that kids in school were saying they
were
<br>seeing him too. I dont know if this is true about other people seeing
<br>him...but I know I seen him...because I seen him twice after
<br>that....basically the same scenerio.I'd wake up to find him hovering
<br>over me. I think he was p****d off about my poetry!

<br><font size=+2>More Ghosts in my Life</font>
<p>By: lisamayer@home.com
<p>&nbsp;First off...I had a
<br>dog I called Noey...she was a true love...so full of life and happiness.
<br>But she had this problem with getting out of the back yard, and I tried
<br>everything to keep her from being a bad dog. We lived on a busy street
<br>and it was so busy it was like a highway...and I worried constantly
<br>about her. (it was very frustrating). It was about noon time and I
had
<br>slept in, when my( x) husband came running in to say Noey had been
hit.
<br>A truck working the construction outside had hit her..you could see
it
<br>by the tire tracks in our driveway and the blood....We assumed though
<br>that she would be alright. Two hours later when I was by myself, I
made
<br>a comment to my best friend who was on the phone with me..."Maybe she'll
<br>learn her lesson." Just as I said that she came wandering in my bedroom
<br>wobbling, and then fell to the floor. I screamed in panic. Somehow
she
<br>ended back in the living room and I was trying to feed her milk as
I
<br>cried, she passed away then. And we took her to the trees behind our
<br>house to bury her. We noticed later that a warn spot in the carpet
had
<br>appeared right where she died. But what's better than that is Noeys
<br>presence was constantly there. I'd drive up to the house and she'd
be
<br>sitting on the porch. Or she was sitting under the table or in the
back
<br>yard...I seen her all the time... but as time when on and eventually
we
<br>moved, her visits became sparce. But I knew all along what she was
<br>telling me...she was telling me it was okay...she loved me. I had
<br>carried so much guilt about her death, but she was letting me know
she
<br>was just fine.Besides that, I have Noey's son, and I swear my Smokey
is
<br>also inhabited spiritually by his Mother! Smokey&nbsp; does the same
EXACT
<br>things as Noey once did!
<br>The second story is about my grandfather who was a watchmaker and a
very
<br>spiritual man, as well. He died about 3:15 on a summers day in June...he
<br>was out swimming in the lake that he had swam in constantly since he
was
<br>a boy. Meanwhile, my uncle was living in Maine. He had just bought
a
<br>pocket watch about 10 days before...a brand new pocketwatch. At precisly
<br>the minute and hour of my Grandfathers death, the watched stopped
<br>forever. Remember, my grandpa was a watchmaker! My uncle knew he had
<br>been there to say, "I'm with you all!"

<br><font size=+2>Grandmother Wants To Play</font>
<p>By: THEMS1@prodigy.net
<p>When my daughter was about 5 years old she claimed to have seen an old
woman who always wanted to play with her in the
<br>&nbsp;middle of the night, and since we had construction going on the
house, she would try to play peek-a-boo over the wood.
<br>This happened and my daughter decided to share it with me, and of course
I just said to pull the covers over her head.
<br>But the woman would continue to bother my daughter and get her to play
around the construction. This began to disturb her.
<br>&nbsp;She consulted me again about it, and I told her to tell the woman
that she couldn't play and it was time to go to bed.
<br>My daughter did as she was told and the spirit went away. About 1 year
later, my Aunt gave me a picture of my grandmother.
<br>&nbsp;I showed this picture to my daughter. With a surprised voice
she said " Mom, that's the lady that used to try and play
<br>with me at night." I'm not sure that it was my grandmother, but if
it was I hope she knows I still love her.

<br><font size=+2>Hutchinson House</font>
<p>By:&nbsp; mrchafin@aol.com
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This beautiful,old, victorian home is on the corner of Market and Union
Streets across the street from the town's auditorium.
<br>&nbsp; We lived in this home for 2 years 1983 &amp; 4. We were looking
for a place to rent.&nbsp; I saw this location in the paper.&nbsp; Went
<br>to the house, walked up to the door, knocked, tried the door and it
was locked.&nbsp; Went to the car to tell my son come look
<br>through the windows with me.&nbsp; I tried the door again and it was
opened. Almost immediately after we moved there I began
<br>noticing that when I was cooking that I would sit down a spoon, bowl,
etc. turn to the stove or leave the room for and minute
<br>return to my cooking and the item would be gone.&nbsp; I would look
around for a few moments and turn back to the place that I
<br>last placed the item and there it would be!&nbsp; Our two sons, ages
9 &amp; 15 had experiences in the basement of the house of
<br>hearing footsteps walk over to them and even follow them up the steps.&nbsp;
The house was heated by an old fashioned boiler
<br>system.&nbsp; My husband would have to occasionally adjust the water
level that involved turning a certain knob.&nbsp; He would see
<br>that knob turn to the off position.&nbsp; As we continued to live there
more and more things would happen.&nbsp; I always felt these
<br>spirits were friendly and peaceful and glad that we were there b/c
we are a very loving and happy family and enjoyed the
<br>house so much.&nbsp; At times I would catch a quick glimpse of a child
or a small man in the dining/kitchen and pantry area.
<br>Guests would often remark of hearing our little daughter (then two)
crying in the night.&nbsp; She slept in our very large bedroom
<br>and we knew she never woke up once all night.&nbsp; I would often hear
laughter of a child other than my own.&nbsp; One morning after
<br>I got my family off to school and work I slipped back to bed for a
few extra minutes of sleep b/4 my daughter awoke.&nbsp; 20 -30
<br>mins passed of sleeping. I awoke and saw a small stature man standing
beside my bed.&nbsp; My first reaction was that it was my
<br>son returning for a forgotten school book.&nbsp; I blinked and soon
realized it wasn't him.&nbsp; I closed my eyes thinking my
<br>imagination was going overtime.&nbsp; I opened them and he still stood
there.&nbsp; I could see through him. I just kept looking at
<br>this man.&nbsp; I wasn't afaid at all of him.&nbsp; Finally he faded
away.&nbsp; The last night we were in the house I couldn't sleep at
<br>all and was sitting in my favorite chair watching TV.&nbsp; Around
3:00 a.m. I got up, went into the kitchen and returned to my
<br>chair.&nbsp; There sat our daughter's favorite teddy bear that she
always slept with.&nbsp; I thought she must be awake looking for me.
<br>&nbsp; I went to her bed and she was sound asleep.&nbsp; I felt this
was a way of this little spirit telling me goodbye.&nbsp; After we
<br>moved from the house my husband told our Sunday School class during
a lesson of "good and evil spirits"&nbsp; about his testing of
<br>this and not telling me until that moment.&nbsp; He would place an
item on purpose in a very hard place to find.&nbsp; Return from
<br>work and check and it would be gone.&nbsp; He would look the next day
and it would be back.&nbsp; He also told of times he would wake
<br>up and see a mother holding her child in the doorway of our bedroom.&nbsp;
Thinking it was me and our daughter. He would turn to
<br>check on us and we would be beside him with our little girl in her
bed beside us.&nbsp; When our daughter was about 9 she asked
<br>me one day who the little lady was that use to visit us when she was
little.&nbsp; She described in detail a little lady that
<br>would come to the Emporia house and just sit beside her or walk through
the room and wave at her.&nbsp; We vividly recalled her
<br>at that age waving and saying, "bye bye little lady".&nbsp; We thought
it was just childhood play.&nbsp; She wrote a paper about it
<br>for her English class and made an A on it.&nbsp; The house has many
many rooms we lived on the main street level and had full
<br>access to the basement except for one room.&nbsp; The owner kept civil
war relics in that room and would occasionally come over
<br>and go through those things letting us browse over them, too.&nbsp;
There was an old horse drawn wagon in one room of the basement
<br>and on occasion the seat of that wagon would bounce up and down for
at least 5 minutes.&nbsp; The day we finally moved out I went
<br>back in for one last moment and told our little family goodbye and
thank you for letting us share their earthly domain.&nbsp; I
<br>never shared any of this with the owners or heard of anyone that lived
there that experience anything.&nbsp; I only know that the
<br>real estate lady that was in charge of renting the house said it was
very hard to rent and to keep rented.&nbsp; I wonder if that
<br>was why.We are devoted christians and did not nor would we ever do
anything to "conjure" these spirits.&nbsp; I know some
<br>christians feel that it is evil to even believe in such things.&nbsp;
But you cannot deny a personal experience.

<br><font size=+2>Haunted Van</font>
<p>By: dignacio@pacbell.net
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Here is my one and only first person haunting story:
<p>About 6 years ago, my husband bought a 20 year old van at an auction.
We
<br>found out that it had been owned by an old man who lived in it,
<br>traveling around the country in his retirement. My husband fixed it
up,
<br>and he started driving it around. When he drove it, there were no
<br>problems. Whenever I drove it, there were always problems. The engine
<br>would die (no pun intended) for no reason. I slammed my hand in the
door
<br>three times on one errand. My clothes caught in the door, in the seat
<br>belt, even around my arms when I tried to put the key in the ignition.
<br>Of course my husband thought I was being silly. None of that stuff
<br>happened when he was around.
<p>The only time he witnessed anything was one time on our way to a camping
<br>weekend. We had our two dogs with us, and while we drove, they were
<br>sitting on the bed in the back of the van. We stopped at a mini mart
for
<br>something to drink. My husband got out of the car, locking the door.
I
<br>got into the back to settle the dogs before getting out of the van
<br>myself. I heard the engine start again. I turned around, and my husband
<br>was outside, frantically trying to open the locked door. I went to
the
<br>drivers' seat, and reached to the ignition turn it off. No key. Oh,
<br>yeah, my husband had it with him outside the door. My husband had
<br>trouble getting in, even with the key. So I reach over and open the
<br>door. He slid into the seat, then drops his keys. I don't know why,
but
<br>I decided to say something. I said, "You need to stop this right now!
If
<br>you keep this up, we will turn around and go home. Then you won't get
to
<br>go anywhere, and that's what you want to do, isn't it?" Right then,
the
<br>vans' engine stopped.
<p>After that, my husband never again laughed at me when odd things
<br>happened in that van. A few years ago, my husband replaced the engine,
<br>and we never had any sort of trouble from that van again.

<br><font size=+2>Hillbarn and Another</font>
<p>By: susangypsy@email.msn.com
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I am an actress who works in local theatres in Northern California.
Late
<br>last summer I was cast in the neil simon comedy "Biloxi Blues" at the
<br>Hillbarn Theatre in Foster City.&nbsp; One evening, as we were trying
on costumes
<br>and showing them to the director, I went upstairs to the costume room
to
<br>look for another actor, and had a distinctly uneasy feeling that I
had not
<br>noticed in this building beforehand.&nbsp; Something was in the room,
and it
<br>wasn't manifesting itself, but the feeling of needing to flee was palpable.
<br>Some weeks later, well into the run of the show, it was my custom to
go out
<br>into the back parking lot to smoke since I had such a long wait between
call
<br>and my entrance.&nbsp; As i walked from the dressing room area I had
to pass
<br>through the set shop to access the back door to the lot.&nbsp; When
I stepped
<br>into the set shop, which had a blue light burning and adequate light
<br>spilling over from the dressing room area, I saw what I thought was
another
<br>actor pass by in front of me, also headed out to the parking lot, dressed
in
<br>the same World War Two khakis our actors were costumed in.&nbsp; This
man,
<br>however, was not one of the small cast.&nbsp; I said "hello, where
are you
<br>going?" and thought that perhaps they had had someone understudy a
role for
<br>this one performance, since I was only in one scene myself I would
not
<br>necessarily have known a substitution had taken place for a performance.
<br>The man did not notice me, and proceeded forward toward the door, seemingly
<br>talking to himself.&nbsp; It was only when he walked straight THROUGH
the door
<br>that I realized he was no ordinary member of our cast.&nbsp; I was
intrigued, and
<br>followed.&nbsp; The parking lot was empty, and I lit a cigarette and
inhaled.
<br>Suddenly the door opened as wide as it would to allow an adult to walk
<br>through, and was pulled shut from inside.&nbsp; No one was there, the
entire cast
<br>was onstage and the crew was waiting for set change immediately backstage.
<br>Later that night, I was consumed with a vision as I left the theatre:&nbsp;
fire
<br>in the dressing room.&nbsp; It was seen clearly, like a movie.&nbsp;
I blinked, it
<br>disappeared, and I was feeling faintly unruffled.
<br>The next week, a friend and her husband came to this show, and we talked
in
<br>the parking lot until I noticed that everyone else had left.&nbsp;
Suddenly I was
<br>filled with a striking desire to leave the area immediately, and hurried
<br>away, as if some terrible event would occur.&nbsp; As a matter of fact,
alone in
<br>my dressing room I had the unnerving feeling that I was under constant
<br>observation at all times.&nbsp; It wasn't necessarily bothersome, it
was just
<br>THERE.
<br>Further investigation has turned up that 1) the original founder of
the
<br>theatre was in World War Two, and naturally in uniform, but I have
seen his
<br>picture and this is not the man I saw, but the theatre was active during
<br>that time, and our show had a World War Two theme,&nbsp; and 2) the
original
<br>theatre had burned to the ground, though not at the same location.
<br>I don't feel that the man I saw was in the same dimension as I, and
I don't
<br>think the man was related to the ominous fire vision , or the watcher
in the
<br>dressing room or the evil presence in the costume room and parking
lot.
<p>The second event occured around 1994 in San Mateo County.&nbsp; There
is a
<br>locally well-known legend on the Peninsula about a former estate there.
<br>Allegedly a night watchman went insane and murdered two young women
who were
<br>prowling around on the property, and tales were told of demons hanging
from
<br>the trees.&nbsp; Naturally it seemed worth a look.&nbsp; I went over
there on a Sunday
<br>night with my boyfriend, in my car.&nbsp; We drove around and could
not see it,
<br>but we were on the original property, we had driven through the original
set
<br>of boundary gates on the perimeter, which were clearly marked.&nbsp;
Up and down
<br>the subdivisions we went, until we both had a feeling that we should
desist
<br>from this excursion.&nbsp; I dropped him off at his car, and he followed
me back
<br>to my house in Oakland.&nbsp; On the way back, driving across the San
Mateo
<br>Bridge, I had this sudden feeling that there was someone sitting in
the
<br>backseat of my car.&nbsp; It was alarmingly strong, it was malevolent,
and I
<br>didn't dare turn around, not even to check if my boyfriend was still
behind
<br>me.&nbsp; It got stronger, and the air was heavy.&nbsp; I raced home,
and lept out of
<br>my car.&nbsp; My boyfriend pulled up immediately and raced out of his
<br>car.......and he looked terrified.&nbsp; Said he felt that someone
evil had been
<br>in the back of his car all the way home.&nbsp; I hadn't said a word
about my
<br>drive.&nbsp; We determined to exorcise the cars and we did, there were
no further
<br>problems.&nbsp; I won't even name that estate, we made a pact never
to say that
<br>name again, but anyone living in San Mateo County will know what I
refer to.

<p><font size=+2>Stanley Inn</font>
<p>By: jrosales@bwn.net
<p>&nbsp; I stayed at the Stanley Inn in Estes Park and my boyfriend and
I slept in the building that isn't the main house, but the
<br>one right next to it.It was like a guesthouse or something.It was its
own seperate building. There is no front desk or
<br>anything,when you first enter, just empty rooms off to your right and
left.I recall a library/sitting room off to your right.
<br>And directly in front of you is a staircase.It wasn't tourist season
, so we were very much alone.It was in the late spring
<br>Anyway, you do get an eerie feeling when you go into the library.And
the mirrors on the back walls don't help the atmosphere
<br>It's kind of like a victorian,once upon a time luxury hotel.It reminds
me of Titanic.We slept on the second floor, and in
<br>the middle of the night, after I'd consumed alot of vodka(it was our
vacation!),We retired to bed.That night I apparently
<br>awoke from sleep telling my boyfriend very urgently that there was"
blood on his shirt". I have no recollection whatsoever of
<br>this? That's the scary thing.My boyfriend was half asleep and so he
just went back to bed, and told me about it in the
<br>morning. He's not scared of anything;he's soo calm!! We had also went
swimming in the pool in the front of the hotel, that
<br>night. Don't ask me what possessed us?the weather was certainly not
right for swimming, but not bitter cold yet , either.We
<br>couldn't resist the big ,deep old pool.Very different from ones today.I
was scared then because the lights weren't sufficient
<br>&nbsp;for the pool area and the water looked soo black.I had to go
to the bathroom and the bathrooms had no lights.But I really
<br>had to pee, so my boyfriend stood by the door.I wouldn't recommend
the Stanley unless your in a big group of people. I'ts
<br>certainly not cozy, but you can feel the history all around you when
your there. The bathrooms are even pretty, but
<br>uncomfortable. The bathtubs are old fashioned and sit on feet.And the
floors very cold.That is my experience, just thought
<br>I'd share.

<p>By: Kbkb24@aol.com
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been viewing your site for atleast 2 hours
tonight and finally
<br>brought myself to send this.&nbsp; My husband and I just bought a house
in april
<br>99, and thats when I noticed somehting wasnt right.&nbsp; We closed
on the house
<br>and before we went for our girls we came by the house.&nbsp; We left
open the door
<br>fromthe house to our garage and stepped out on to the back patio leaving
that
<br>door open also, well the garage door slammed shut!&nbsp; Very,very
hard!&nbsp; My
<br>husband and i look at eachother and went to investigate, finding nothing
<br>ofcourse.&nbsp; That has happend a few times sincebut, the thing that
gets me is,
<br>when we first moved in our neighbor told us the woman we bought the
house
<br>from used to hear loud music late at night, every night,but none of
the other
<br>people in the houses around our home hear it.&nbsp; I blew it off,
but came to
<br>hear it myself every night around 11 pm.&nbsp; I have gone outside,
cant hear it.
<br>Its loudest in the master bedroom, but audiable in the rest of the
house.&nbsp; I
<br>always hear unexplained little noises that seem to loud for the house
<br>settling.&nbsp; My youngest daughter, the first night here screamed
the most awful
<br>scream, saying there was a man looking at her from the window.&nbsp;
We had to
<br>back porsh light and and there was nothing in the window to resemble
someone
<br>or somehting.&nbsp; My kids and I avoid the back room, originally their
bedroom
<br>and actually We all sleep in the master bedroom due to their fear and
mine.
<br>My husband is not at all bothered by this, his childhood home is very
much
<br>haunted, next door to a cemetary, also. Since living in this home our
family
<br>life has taken a turn for the worst, frequent fights, just general
discord
<br>approximately starting the 1st month.&nbsp; My mother says its the
house, she sees
<br>the bad luck we've had since being here.&nbsp; My cat came close to
death when we
<br>moved here and we took him to my mom's and he bounced back. My health
has
<br>gotten so so, I am more moody, as long as I am out I feel fine just
the
<br>thought of coming into the house gets me moody and snappy.&nbsp; I
appologize for
<br>such a long letter, I tried to make it as short as possible.&nbsp;
I hear the
<br>music now, it isnt something you hear like a radio, it's more like
a loud car
<br>stereo with alot of base. One more thing, the way the lady had our
alarm
<br>installed it covers the windows in the master bed adn the sensor is
right
<br>above the hall in front of the door and also a sensor on the garage
door.&nbsp; My
<br>home was built on 78 and I dont know much about the history except
that
<br>approximately every 7 years there are new owners.&nbsp; I hope it is
my
<br>imagination but please tell me what you think.

<p><font size=+2>My Ghost Story</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: chrisa079@hotmail.com
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The entire paternal side of my family has a history of psychics and
<br>hauntings. In my house, where I lived with my grandparents, I was the
<br>focus.&nbsp; Other people in the household had creepy experiences as
well, but
<br>it seemed as though most everything occured in my bedroom upstairs.&nbsp;
It
<br>started when I was about thirteen or fourteen, as just an almost tangible
<br>feeling of creepiness.&nbsp; Before long, when I would lie down to
sleep, I
<br>noticed a glowing greenish spot in one corner of the room, where there
was
<br>a doorway to an unused back room.&nbsp; At first I just thought it
was some
<br>glow-in-the-dark paint, like I had used to put designs on my walls.&nbsp;
Until
<br>it started moving.&nbsp; It started by just getting bigger and smaller,
kind of
<br>pulsing, but after a week or so of this, it actually began moving around
on
<br>the wall.&nbsp; Then other spots appeared.
<p>Thinking that it might be light coming in from the window, I blocked
the
<br>window off, then brought my sister and cousin (who also lived with
us) into
<br>the room to see if I was the only one seeing it.&nbsp; I turned off
the lights,
<br>and just asked them to look around and tell me if they saw anything.
<br>Needless to say, they did.&nbsp; I hadn't told them where I had been
seeing the
<br>spots, but they pointed out the exact same spot.&nbsp; Over the weeks,
I had
<br>other people come look at it too, to make sure it wasn't a fluke.&nbsp;
It
<br>wasn't.&nbsp; I had about fifteen people total point out where they
saw the
<br>spots, so I know it wasn't my imagination.&nbsp; It didn't stop with
the spots,
<br>though.&nbsp; Soon they started moving around the entire wall, splitting
off and
<br>almost dancing around the posters I had up.&nbsp; Then suddenly, after
a couple
<br>of months, they disappeared.&nbsp; That's when the REALLY crazy stuff
started
<br>happening.
<p>As I mentioned before, my family has a history of psychics.&nbsp; Though
I don't
<br>claim anything spectacular, I am a bit clairsentient, like most of
us.
<br>Well, my cousin Angie (a different cousin than the one aforementioned)
and
<br>I are like amplifiers for each other; we sense things more strongly
when in
<br>each other's presence.&nbsp;&nbsp; She used to spend the night quite
frequently,
<br>which is when what had been a tolerable presence in my room became
<br>unbearable.&nbsp; Dark shadows would be visible in my room at night,
shadows
<br>that moved and split off.&nbsp; Initially it would start as a man-shaped
shadow
<br>coming out of the corner where the lights had appeared.&nbsp; As it
would
<br>approach the bed where Angie and I were, the air became almost suffocating.
<br>&nbsp;It would get to&nbsp; the footboard, then split off into two
indistinct shapes,
<br>slide up the wall where the lights had appeared, and onto the ceiling,
<br>where it would join together again above my bed, where the pressure
on our
<br>chests would become almost unbearable.&nbsp; At this point, Angie and
I&nbsp; created
<br>a psychic bubble of sorts (some of you may know what I'm talking about),
<br>and believe it or not, it was actually visible at one point.&nbsp;
You could
<br>actually see the shell around us, almost as a red static.&nbsp; The
spirit would
<br>disappear, only to reappear a few minutes later out of the same corner
to
<br>start all over again if we hadn't already turned the lights on and
left the
<br>room.&nbsp; There are other witnesses to this phenomenon as well; I
had some
<br>creepy-ass slumber parties!&nbsp; Sometimes curious friendly acquaintances
would
<br>actually come over to the "batcave" (as my room had been dubbed) to
see if
<br>anything would happen.&nbsp; Rarely were they disappointed, though
I won't say
<br>that that never happened.
<p>Most everything happened with the lights off, but occasionally things
would
<br>occur with the lights on (though always at night), such as poltergiest
<br>activity, though this was rare.&nbsp; I remember one time when I was
sixteen or
<br>so, I was standing next to my dresser, when a pencil at the end of
the desk
<br>next to it flew off and hit me on the shoulder.&nbsp; A few seconds
later, a
<br>small jewelry box (one of those little treasure chests) flew off of
the
<br>radio it had been sitting on and hit me in the head.&nbsp; I ran screaming
into
<br>my sister's room, which was right next to mine, where she told me I
was
<br>just imagining it.&nbsp; I told her to walk in there and tell me she
didn't feel
<br>anything, and a few seconds later she ran out screaming as well, saying
she
<br>had just walked through something that wasn't there.&nbsp; She herself
<br>experienced a man-shadow in her room around that time, but that's a
story
<br>for another time.
<p>As I mentioned earlier, my room wasn't the only place to be afflicted.&nbsp;
My
<br>sister's room, my cousin's room, the bathroom, the laundry room,&nbsp;
the back
<br>room next to mine, and the front and side yards all had creepy things
<br>taking place there; as well as my aunt's house and two of my cousin's
<br>homes.&nbsp; That's not even including the stuff that happened in the
homes that
<br>we had moved from.&nbsp; The apartment that I moved into with my fiance
a while
<br>back had occurances, as well as the house we just moved into recently.&nbsp;
But
<br>the thing that I noticed?&nbsp; Once I became a bible-believing Christian,
and
<br>told the spirits to leave in the name of Christ, they did.&nbsp; Flat
out, no
<br>more little scare tactics.&nbsp; They just left. Amen.

<p><font size=+2>My Ghosts</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: djyow@one.net.au
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I live in a house with my parents and its about 80 - 100 yo. (haven't
got
<br>the exact date but we had a flood in the area in 1929 and the house
still
<br>bares scars of that). Our house is occupied by ghosts we assume around
three
<br>but that is undetermined.&nbsp; The house is built on a reclaimed swamp,
and we
<br>put most things down to movement from vehicles but a when somethings
are
<br>just to unnatural to be put down to mundane things.
<p>Now as a kid I never really noticed them but I was always scared of
the dark
<br>because I thought something was watching me, and I was right, when
I reached
<br>puberty one ghost stood out, it was a female unknown age and dressed
in
<br>white gown of some type.&nbsp; What happened and still happens with
her is when
<br>I'm alone or sitting in bead thinking or reading she calls out, now
the
<br>funny thing is that usually when she call out I'm listening to music
through
<br>headphones and I can distinctly hear my name between tracks, also she
stands
<br>at the foot of my bed watching over me.
<p>The other two mischevious and like to play pranks, both (that we've
seen)
<br>are old men and one is chinese we believe as a few years go we placed
a
<br>chinese wind chime at the back door to keep spirits away (we checked
the
<br>insriptions just to make sure) and some nights a male figure could
be seen
<br>standing near the chime but not going any closer.&nbsp; Now both like
to do
<br>simple things like move objects open doors and drop plates also they
like
<br>making nightime visits and showing there forms and pissing of the dogs.
<p>Now you might think that these are all in the imagination of a pubesent
male
<br>but I'm now 23 and after returning home to study at uni, the visitations
<br>reoccured and the 'pranks', well they never stopped after I left.

<p><font size=+2>My Ghosty, George</font>
<p>By: AirRsis@aol.com
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have always been sensitive to the "other side",
although I didn't know
<br>what it all meant when I was younger.&nbsp; I would talk to people
who I thought
<br>were angels.&nbsp; Most of my family just thought that it was the common
<br>adolescent phase of keeping an imaginary friend.&nbsp; When I turned
fourteen, I
<br>proved them wrong.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My dad wasn't home yet from his night shift, so
I was sitting at home
<br>alone, playing a computer role playing game.&nbsp; I was fending for
myself in the
<br>common teenager fashion.&nbsp; I became aware of the sound of water
running.&nbsp; I
<br>let it go for about ten minutes until I finally got fed up with it.&nbsp;
Thinking
<br>it was the game, I turned off the sound on the computer.&nbsp; I still
heard the
<br>water.&nbsp; I crawled under the computer and pulled the plug on the
speakers.
<br>Still heard water running.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I ran downstairs and shut off the fish
tank bubbles.&nbsp; The fish
<br>will survive until I finish the level on my game.&nbsp; Halfway up
the stairs, I
<br>still heard the water running!&nbsp; I ran to the bathroom at the top
of the
<br>stairs and twisted the cold water knob hard.&nbsp; It had been the
faucet.&nbsp; I
<br>didn't remember turning it on, nor hearing it when my father had left
a few
<br>hours before.&nbsp; I shook of the feeling of being watched and went
back to the
<br>computer in the bedroom.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I played another few minutes, trying to solve a
puzzle, and heard a
<br>squeak and more water sounds.&nbsp; I cursed and spun around in my
chair.
<br>Charging across the hall, I yanked the faucet shut again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After several minutes of alternating playing the
game, yanking the
<br>faucet, and scratching my head, I figured that the place was haunted.&nbsp;
Was I
<br>scared?&nbsp; Heck yes!&nbsp; I ran to my dad's room and cowered under
the covers until
<br>my dad came home.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, I came to call my resident spirit George.&nbsp;
I have no clue why; I
<br>just decided he seemed like a George.&nbsp; As I came into more contact
with
<br>George, I began to feel things clearly, even seeing fleeting glances
from the
<br>corner of my eyes, or the shadowy outline of a man in front of me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George liked to play games.&nbsp; Caught between
being a full blown teenager
<br>and a kid, I decided to play along.&nbsp; Sometimes he would hide things
from me
<br>while I wasn't home, then I would find it later sitting on my stereo
or some
<br>other obvious place.&nbsp; My father denied taking my things, even
went as far as
<br>to say I was taking drugs and hallucinating.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After another of my arguments with my dad about
George, I went home to my
<br>mother's house and told her about my day.&nbsp; Her eyes got wide as
she exclaimed
<br>"You feel them too?"&nbsp; Apparently, it runs on my mother's side
of the family!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For quite a while, George and I played the hide
and seek game with my
<br>things, until I finally gave up and told him it was childish.&nbsp;
Yes, I would
<br>talk to him and almost hear him answer back.&nbsp; I would tell him
my entire day
<br>as I went about my chores or studied, or at least until I went into
my
<br>father's room.&nbsp; For some reason he wouldn't, or couldn't, go in
there.&nbsp; We
<br>bonded (or at least I think we bonded), because he often followed me
to my
<br>mother's house.&nbsp; How, I have no clue.&nbsp; I've never heard of
a spirit who's
<br>bonded to a place following a living person across town.&nbsp; (If
anyone has
<br>heard of such a thing, please share!)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I contacted a psychic friend after finding nothing
on the history of the
<br>apartment or its occupants.&nbsp; She told me that George was an English
<br>professor.&nbsp; "He knows he's dead, but when he died, there was something
there,
<br>blocking his way into the other side.&nbsp; Your ghosty is afraid that
the thing
<br>is still there." she wrote me one day.&nbsp; That was when I started
to leave
<br>books on my bed for George to keep occupied while I was at school.&nbsp;
Maybe
<br>then he'd leave my stereo settings alone!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often he would be on the stairs or on the top of
the stairs.&nbsp; Sometimes I
<br>would feel him by my stereo.&nbsp; Even a few friends thought they
felt someone
<br>watching them as they were sitting in the living room.&nbsp; "That's
just my
<br>ghost, George.&nbsp; Don't pay attention to him and he'll leave you
alone" I'd
<br>tell them when they'd start to shiver.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My dad's moving out of the apartment now.&nbsp;
All of my old things are being
<br>packed up and shipped to the next apartment.&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp;
Maybe George'll
<br>follow me to the new place, like he did before when I went to my mother's!

<p><font size=+2>My House in Italy</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: harvey@flash.net
<p>In 1994 or 95, I don't remember exactly.&nbsp; I lived in a house in
La
<br>madalena, Italy.&nbsp; I was in the U.S. Navy at the time.&nbsp; I
was dating a
<br>girl named Shannon from New Jeresy.&nbsp; The House I lived in was
old, I'm
<br>not sure how old really but I think it was built around WWII or sometime
<br>after.&nbsp; Many odd things had happened before that were explainable,
but
<br>on one particular night something happened that neither I or Shannon
<br>could explain.&nbsp; On one of the few nights that Shannon stayed with
me is
<br>when it happened.&nbsp; We were in bed, and had been there for quite
a while
<br>and I was having a hard time falling asleep.&nbsp; Finally thoagh it
took a
<br>while I began to fall asleep,then I started to feel cold, and tingly
<br>around my feet.&nbsp; I tried to reach down and pull up the covers,but
I
<br>could barely move and the tingling got stronger.&nbsp; I started to
get a
<br>little nervous and then tried to open my eyes.&nbsp; I could barely
get them
<br>open thoagh (just a crack).&nbsp; Mostly the tingling was around my
feet, but
<br>it started to move up my legs.&nbsp; Soon it was around my midsection.&nbsp;
That
<br>is when I tried to wake Shannon, But it was still impossible to move.&nbsp;
I
<br>could only shake out of fear.&nbsp; I could'nt even speak when I tried.&nbsp;
The
<br>only noises I could make were very soft groans.&nbsp; By this time
the
<br>tingling sensation had covered me almost completely.&nbsp; With my
eyes only
<br>cracked open I saw what seemed to be a gray illuminated haze. This
was
<br>the straw that broke the camels back, and I passed out.&nbsp; The next
thing
<br>I remember was Shannon jumping out of bed.&nbsp; She turned the bedroom
light
<br>on, and walked towards the door.&nbsp; I asked her " What's wrong ".&nbsp;
She
<br>said, " Nothing. Leave me Alone!" and went to the kitchen for a glass
of
<br>milk.&nbsp; I tried to ask her if she felt the same thing I did and
she just
<br>kept saying " don't talk to me!" as thoagh I had done something wrong.
<br>Later that morning on our way to work she apologized and said that
the
<br>same thing had happened to her that very same night.&nbsp; Needless
to say
<br>but she never stayed there again.&nbsp; She said that there was obviously
a
<br>female ghost that lived there, and it had taken a liking to me, and
<br>did'nt much care for her being around.&nbsp; I tried for the longest
time to
<br>come up with another more logical explanation, but I could'nt.&nbsp;
It seems
<br>to me that maybe Shannon was right. One thing thoagh.&nbsp; If what
Shannon
<br>thinks is true, then why did it happen again when I was sleeping
<br>alone.

<p><font size=+2>My Poor Husband</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: Freddiefan68@aol.com
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I come from a family of woman who reluctantly have certain "gifts" (for
lack
<br>of a better word).&nbsp; My mother can tell on the spot the personality
of a
<br>person, even if he/she seems to be the most genuine of souls.&nbsp;
Also, if my
<br>mother remembers her dreams - watch out!&nbsp; My grandmother is a
very devout
<br>Catholic woman who you can surprisingly tell your deepest, darkest
secrets
<br>to.&nbsp; She is very open-minded about all things paranormal, and
encourages you
<br>to use your gift.
<p>My gift deals with places.&nbsp; I can walk into a place and tell if
something is
<br>or was wrong there.&nbsp; When we tried to tell my fiance about this,
he did not
<br>believe us.&nbsp; He thought it was all either in our imaginations
or being told
<br>to him as a joke.
<p>He decided to turn the tables.&nbsp; He has a friend who is a ghost
hunter, and
<br>very open to dealing with spirits.&nbsp; Of course, my new husband
told me nothing
<br>of this before he took me to this guy's house.&nbsp; When we left this
house, I
<br>was so shaken that my husband got worried.&nbsp; I told him that the
whole time
<br>that I was there, I felt a presence that was not good that continually
stared
<br>at me.&nbsp; Later, he called his friend.&nbsp; It turns out that there
were actually
<br>three spirits at this house.&nbsp; One was of a small girl who was
harmless and
<br>whom they had in fact gotten very used to.&nbsp; The other was of an
old man that
<br>stayed to the upper floors of the house.&nbsp; Once again, a harmless
sort.&nbsp; Then,
<br>he hit us with the "wanderer."&nbsp; This man walked around the outside
of the
<br>house, and avoided contact with our "ghost hunter."
<p>Needless to say, I only went back to that house once more and for a
VERY
<br>short time.&nbsp; Also, I convinced my doubting Thomas husband of my
"gift."&nbsp; He
<br>has agreed never to surprise me with a house I have not looked at first.

<p><font size=+2>The Old Lady</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: dyarbrough@cor-tech.net
<p>Atlanta, Georgia circa 1981
<p>I graduated from High School in 1981. For the final two years of that
<br>experience, I had the same girlfriend and spent many, many hours at
her
<br>house with her and her brother who was a year older. For the longest
time,
<br>when I would leave at night (usually much later than I should have)
I would
<br>have to walk out of the kitchen door of this typical tri-level house,
down
<br>a short path to the garage then through the garage and out to my car?
It
<br>always petrified me. I could never explain it nor did I try (why face
the
<br>laughter of being afraid of the dark). I spent many times by myself
at the
<br>house seeing as it was a second home and many things happened while
I was
<br>there?things that could be explained away. The house had the kitchen,
<br>living and dining room on the "main" level, upstairs were four bedroom
and
<br>downstairs was the den (right below the kitchen) with a bathroom, laundry
<br>room and recreation room off to the side. Candles would fall out of
their
<br>holders?often. That can be explained by a number of things. The house
was
<br>noisy. But never in the area you were in. If you were downstairs, the
<br>creaks would come from upstairs and if you were upstairs the sounds
came
<br>from the laundry room or the rec. room.&nbsp; Many times I felt chills
and cold
<br>in the rec. room, but that could just be poor insulation?Finally after
a
<br>year and a half, I was at the house one day by myself and walked from
the
<br>kitchen into the dining room and stopped cold. Out of the corner of
my eye
<br>to the left was an old woman sitting in one of the chairs in the living
<br>room. When I turned my head, she was gone. My heart pounding, I stepped
<br>backwards into the kitchen determined to step back through and see
if it
<br>was a trick of the eye that I could duplicate. I took a deep breath
and
<br>stepped back through looking straight ahead. She was again but just
for the
<br>faintest of second, then gone when my eyes turned. I was stunned.&nbsp;
When I
<br>told everybody that night I was not ridiculed, but no one came rushing
<br>forward with any stories of there own.
<br>Later that month I was there alone at night (yeah, I know)?I was upstairs
<br>and there were creaks coming from downstairs that sounded something
like
<br>someone coming up the stairs from the den to the kitchen. The sound
was
<br>deeper, not a groan, but not a creak from a wooden stair. I was on
the top
<br>level in a bedroom and was almost breathless. The sound continued up
the
<br>carpeted stairs, muffled, but definitely there, and definitely the
sound of
<br>something large. I pleasantly called out, "Hello?" Nothing, then&nbsp;
after a
<br>long silent pause the cat walks around the corner and into the bedroom.
As
<br>much as my imagination could have gotten away with me I know, even
now
<br>almost 20 years later, that the cat while slightly overweight, could
not
<br>have made the sounds. Still I said something to the cat along the lines
of,
<br>"Thanks a lot." Then I felt the chill and the cat sat perfectly in
front of
<br>me and started meowing?but with no sound?zero!&nbsp; I felt every hair
on my
<br>neck stand up as I felt this chill and watched the cat open and close
its
<br>mouth like it was meowing, but nothing coming out. I slowly stood up
walked
<br>out of the room down the stairs and out the front door? I refused to
go out
<br>the back and waited until my girlfriend got home? There was a basketball
<br>outside and I dribbled in the dark so when she pulled in I had a good
<br>reason for being outside? Why I hadn't gone into the garage and turned
the
<br>light on I couldn't explain. I've never told that story, as you can
imagine
<br>why.
<br>&nbsp;A month or two later my girlfriend was awakened late one night
by some
<br>presence, when her eyes opened she plainly saw the dark figure of a
woman
<br>in a wide brimmed hat. She called, "Mother?" But her Mother answered
her
<br>from her bedroom at the end of the hall. My girlfriend rolled over
and
<br>focused, but nothing was there. She said later that she could feel
the
<br>presence, more than see it.
<br>&nbsp;A week or so later her brother, home from school awoke to "feel"
something
<br>in his room?He refused to roll over or open his eyes. A year later,
home
<br>again from school he was sitting in the den watching MTV and the light
<br>clicked on in the laundry room. He didn't remember his mother coming
<br>downstairs and it was 2 in the morning anyway?After she did not respond
to
<br>his calls, he (like me) slowly got up, went upstairs and crawled under
the
<br>covers.
<br>&nbsp;I don't know of any other "happenings" but someone finally asked
the
<br>former owners if they ever had an experience in the house and they
said no,
<br>"But our Grandmother passed in the upstairs bedroom."
<p>Every bit of this story is true.&nbsp; I will never forget that feeling,
and
<br>felt it again while helping my Mother look for a house in Hendersonville,
<br>North Carolina?She felt "odd" and decided not to buy?thank goodness

<p><font size=+2>Our Guard</font>
<p>By: alveyfamily@worldnet.att.net
<p>We discovered we weren't the only residents to move into our brand-new
house
<br>after living there a few weeks.&nbsp; I was taking a photograph of
our house and
<br>the camera malfunctioned.&nbsp; The picture of a civil war soldier
briefly
<br>appeared in the polaroid picture that half developed.&nbsp; There were
other
<br>signs as well...disappearing and reappearing objects, cold spots, shadowy
<br>outlines and electrical equipment working itself.
<br>It soon became evident that our spirits had come in a group.&nbsp;
Some where
<br>friendly.&nbsp; Some where not.&nbsp; I found a book on clearing out
spirits.&nbsp; We
<br>persisted in clearing out till only one was left.&nbsp; This one was
a soldier.
<br>I never was sure which side he was on but I came to depend on him and
the
<br>family came to love our guard.
<br>As other homes were built around us people would prowl at night.&nbsp;
This was a
<br>problem for me because my husband was gone a lot.&nbsp; But we had
our guard.&nbsp; He
<br>would flip on light switches when someone was outside.&nbsp; He would
bang
<br>objects around to make noise as well.&nbsp; One morning after a night
of banging
<br>and lights switching on we found footprints outside the basement door.&nbsp;
Our
<br>neighbors would swear someone was watching out our windows when we
were
<br>gone.
<br>When the kids were up past their bed time I would feel an icy brush
against
<br>my cheek until I would get up and get them back to bed.&nbsp; At night
my son and
<br>I could occassionally see a thin white outline pacing up and down the
hall.
<br>I would always sleep easier when I saw that.
<br>This past year the guard decided to leave.&nbsp; Our house is now ghost
free.&nbsp; We
<br>do miss that one ghost though.&nbsp; He sure helped when I needed it
the most.
