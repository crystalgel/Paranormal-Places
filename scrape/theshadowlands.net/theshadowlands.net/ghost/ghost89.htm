</H3><P>
<P><B>By: Tuwanda@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've sent this website several stories of my own experiences, but
here</B>
<P><B>is an account of the very real experience of one of my friends.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Being a tour guide in Charleston, SC, my friends and I have been
privy</B>
<P><B>to enumerous stories of apparitions and things that go bump in the</B>
<P><B>night. One of the most repeated ghost stories in Charleston is that
of</B>
<P><B>Mary Bloomfield, better known as Charleston's "Lady in White." She
was</B>
<P><B>the wife of a merchant during the Victorian era in the later part of
the</B>
<P><B>1800's. Tradition has it that her husband had business in Boston and</B>
<P><B>boarding a ship, he set sail for Massacusetts. At some point during
his</B>
<P><B>voyage, he became seriously ill and died. Mary never found out what</B>
<P><B>happened to her husband for, as she was awaiting his return, she also</B>
<P><B>became very sick and passed away. Her husband was buried in Boston
while</B>
<P><B>she was buried in Charleston in the Unitarian cemetary. It's said
that</B>
<P><B>she walks the grave yard in the late afternoon and evening, seeking
the</B>
<P><B>whereabouts of her poor, ill-fated husband. Here's where the story
ends</B>
<P><B>and reality takes over...</B>
<P>
<P><B>My friend works for one of the many walking tour companies in
Charleston</B>
<P><B>and spends the majority of his afternoon and evenings leading
tourists</B>
<P><B>through some of the oldest city streets in America and telling the</B>
<P><B>legends and tales of </B>
<P><B>the haunted South. One of the highlights of the tour is the old</B>
<P><B>Unitarian grave yard. It's an old graveyard full of crumbling
headstones</B>
<P><B>and choked with weeds which dates back to the 1700's. My friend leads</B>
<P><B>dozens of tourist through this cemetary daily and has done so for</B>
<P><B>months, without incident. So, when he lead twenty tourists through
the</B>
<P><B>maze of vines and granite in the twilight of a February afternoon,
he</B>
<P><B>expected to find the grave yard as he normally did - quiet and empty.
He</B>
<P><B>walked into the middle of the grave yard and as the tourists gathered</B>
<P><B>around him, listening to his tale, he became abruptly aware of an
eaves</B>
<P><B>dropper. She walked slowly among the graves, making no noise but</B>
<P><B>intently watching with great curiousity the small, huddled group.</B>
<P><B>Perhaps she listened to hear the guide's account of her sad demise,
or</B>
<P><B>maybe she was searching the faces of the small assembleage for one
that</B>
<P><B>she recognized as that of her lost love. But for those who witnessed</B>
<P><B>her, the woman with the upswept , dark hair and white dress with the</B>
<P><B>high collar was, without a doubt, Mary Bloomfield. But what gave her</B>
<P><B>away was not the antiquated style of her hair or gown. It was the</B>
<P><B>unnatural way her eyes followed the visitors, for no matter where she</B>
<P><B>moved to or what angle she stood at, she never took her eyes off of
them</B>
<P><B>for a second. My friend told me that as long as he lives, the thought
of</B>
<P><B>how she watched them will always give him chills. </B>

<P><B>The Hospital Haunting</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: SDear17156@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I wasn't sure I believed in ghosts until recently.  I live in NYC and
about a </B>
<P><B>year ago a friend of mine had a mild heart condition.  Well one day
after </B>
<P><B>alot of stress in his business he had a massive Stress attack.  Well
because </B>
<P><B>of his condition he ended up in the hospital.  I decided to visit him
one </B>
<P><B>morning before work.  I went into his room and noticed the bathroom
door </B>
<P><B>slightly ajar.  I heard shuffling sounds and water running, so I assumed
that </B>
<P><B>someone was in there. I saw the bed from the door way and naturally
assumed </B>
<P><B>since it was empty it was my friend.  I being female and he being male
I just </B>
<P><B>automatticly told him I was in the room and not to come out indecent.
 </B>
<P><B>Something  was mumbled back but I didn't understand it.  I sat down
and </B>
<P><B>waited.  His roommate was soundly sleeping and snoring away.  I still
heard </B>
<P><B>sounds from the bathroom.  And then the door opened and I distinctly
heard </B>
<P><B>slippers  shuffling out of the room.  But the sounds were  unacompanied
by a </B>
<P><B>body.  I got up,FAST,  And went out to the nurses station to ask where
my </B>
<P><B>friend was.  They told me he hadn't been brought back up from a precedure
</B>
<P><B>being done yet.  Well needless to say I didn't stick around to wait
for him.  </B>
<P><B>I visited him after he was out and asked if he had noticed anything
unusual </B>
<P><B>in his room.  He said he was on too many pain killers to notice anything.
 I've </B>
<P><B>never felt the same about BETh Israel Hospital again.         </B>
<P>
<P><B>Calming Touch</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: DaFintz@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've had an experience with a ghost of some sorts.  It happened about
five </B>
<P><B>years ago when I used to live with my parents.  I must have been 16
or 17.  </B>
<P><B>One night I was having trouble sleeping. (which wasn't unusual since
it was </B>
<P><B>during the spring and daylight savings time always messes up my sleeping
</B>
<P><B>habits.)  I was lying in bed wide awake and suddenly had the strongest
</B>
<P><B>feeling that something was in the room with me.  I looked around in
the faint </B>
<P><B>moonlight, but nothing was there.  Then all of a sudden I could hear
and feel </B>
<P><B>a hand brushing across my covers.  I was petrified.  I could hear my
pulse in </B>
<P><B>my ears from my heart beating so fast,  but I could still feel the
hand </B>
<P><B>moving.  Then it came up under my pillow and cradled my neck with it's
hand.  </B>
<P><B>Oddly enough,  I was comforted by it and fell asleep soon after.  I
never had </B>
<P><B>anything like that happen to me again,  but my father says that sometimes
he </B>
<P><B>feels a faint breeze comming from the closet door. (which is completely
</B>
<P><B>sealed off from the attic no air can move in there)  One time a hand
touched </B>
<P><B>him on the forehead not unlike the way you would feel a child's forehead
to </B>
<P><B>see if they have a fever.  He said he was scared for only a few seconds
and </B>
<P><B>then felt very calm and went back to sleep.  It seems initial fright
is </B>
<P><B>inevitable when something like this happens to one.  However,  what
I find </B>
<P><B>most interesting is the calming effect it had when it actually touched
us.  I </B>
<P><B>can only guess that this presence or spirit ins't malevolent or evil,
 but </B>
<P><B>perhaps some kind of guardian or just a lonely person that has passed
on </B>
<P><B>looking for some contact with the human world.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>A FEW HAUNTINGS</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: morphix_911@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have a few short ghost stories to share.  My first takes place when
I</B>
<P><B>was ten.  My room had two doors.  One leading to the bathroom hall
and</B>
<P><B>one into the living room.  The bathroom hall and living room are</B>
<P><B>connected.  I woke up and had to go to the bathroom.  I was scared
that</B>
<P><B>night because of a movie I watched, so I woke up my mom to take me
to</B>
<P><B>the bathroom.  As we walked closer to the bathroom door a tall man
came</B>
<P><B>out of my bedroom door that is next to the bathroom and walked right</B>
<P><B>through me and into the living room.  The next day I told my mom and</B>
<P><B>she didn't see a thing. </B>
<P><B> My second story takes place in the shower.  It was about 9pm I'm</B>
<P><B>getting ready for school the next day.  My shower curtains are a
light</B>
<P><B>blue and you can see through them.  I was washing my hair when all
of a</B>
<P><B>sudden I see this black figure walk from the window to the door and</B>
<P><B>exit with out unlocking or opening the door.  Needless to say I got
out</B>
<P><B>of there in a hurry.  The last event and the few others I will tell
you</B>
<P><B>about happened since I turned 16.  I'm 17 now.  </B>
<P><B>I was at my cousins house during the summer of 1998.  We were in the</B>
<P><B>living room watching TV.  Next to the TV is a huge picture window</B>
<P><B>looking out over into the driveway.  I could see the reflection of
the</B>
<P><B>kitchen in it.  I just stared at it for a while.  Then I saw a figure</B>
<P><B>of a man with white eyes looking at me.  I turned around but found
no</B>
<P><B>one in the room except for my cousin and me. The day before I was at
my</B>
<P><B>grandma's house next door to my cousins house and saw some man walk</B>
<P><B>down the hall way and into the bathroom.  No body was up and there</B>
<P><B>wasn't any sound as he walked over the carpet.  Usually the carpet</B>
<P><B>makes a swishing sound when you walk on it.</B>
<P><B>In my house when I'm alone I can see people out of the corner of my</B>
<P><B>eye.  I can't make out faces because it is just a black figure.  I
hear</B>
<P><B>people walking around or talking when no one is around.  My basement
is</B>
<P><B>the scariest place.  Ever since I moved there in 87' I always felt
as</B>
<P><B>if someone is down there with me.  One day I was getting fire wood
that</B>
<P><B>was stacked up down in the basement.  I turned around because I felt</B>
<P><B>someone was watching me and saw a man with deformed face.  As quickly</B>
<P><B>as he came he disappeared.  I ran like hell to get out of there.  </B>
<P><B>Another time I was getting ready for bed and I saw a white figure
walk</B>
<P><B>from one door the other and walk through the wall.  These apparitions</B>
<P><B>never harmed me yet.  The only thing that it or they have ever done
is</B>
<P><B>throw a cup at me when I was in the shower.  I have told my parents</B>
<P><B>about the sightings many times but they never believe me.  The only</B>
<P><B>ones that believe me are my friends.  I wish I could find out about
the</B>
<P><B>history, but I have no idea where to start.  If someone can help me</B>
<P><B>please email me.</B>

<P><B>Long Island Stories</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Kimba</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, I just looked at you site.  It's great.  I am not an investigator
or </B>
<P><B>anything like that, but I have experienced some strange happenings
at my </B>
<P><B>house here in Long Island New York.  </B>
<P><B>( story 1 )</B>
<P><B>We've lived in this house for about 9 yrs and from time to time I would
wake </B>
<P><B>up and see a blurr hovering by the ceiling.  When I say blurr, it's
like </B>
<P><B>looking at your hand while holding a clear jelly fish ( your hand looks
</B>
<P><B>blurry ) yet I look around it and everything is clear.  This always
happens </B>
<P><B>in the middle of the night.  One time I even saw it float toward my
daughters </B>
<P><B>room and I jumped up and ran in there but then it disappeared. </B>
<P>
<P><B>(story 2)</B>
<P><B>One night my son was sleeping on the sofabed in the livingroom.  I
have a </B>
<P><B>huge painting over the couch.  The next morning he asked me what I
wanted in </B>
<P><B>the middle of the night, I had no idea what he was talking about. 
He said I </B>
<P><B>was calling his name. I told him I didn't.  He said he woke up because
he </B>
<P><B>heard me calling his name and he said I called him around 3 or 4 times
and I </B>
<P><B>kept telling him " come here" meaning my bedroom.  Well he was too
tired and </B>
<P><B>just kept yelling back "what do you want" and he said I never answered,
so he </B>
<P><B>figured the heck with it..he'll just find out in the morning. 2 seconds
later </B>
<P><B>the painting fell off the wall and hit him in the head.  For 9 years
that </B>
<P><B>painting never fell off the wall and hasn't fell off since. </B>
<P>
<P><B>( story 3 )</B>
<P><B>My cousin and I were sitting in the diningroom talking.  No one was
home </B>
<P><B>except my son who was asleep in bed with a fever. He is 6 feet tall.
In the </B>
<P><B>middle of my sentenced I stopped short because I thought I saw someone
or </B>
<P><B>something flash by me quickly. I think most people have seen that happen,
</B>
<P><B>it's kind of like something flashes by you and you catch it with the
corner </B>
<P><B>of you eye. Well this is what this was.  It distracted me and my cousin
said </B>
<P><B>"what's the matter", so I told her "nothing, I thought I saw something
pass </B>
<P><B>me.  She said, wait! I saw that too, wasn't that Joe? ( meaning my
son ) I </B>
<P><B>said, no..he's in bed sleeping, he has a fever.  She said, no way..I
saw it </B>
<P><B>too, I thought it was Joe quickly going in the kitchen.  I said no
it wasn't. </B>
<P><B>We both got up and went in Joe's room and there he was sound asleep
still.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>(story 4 )</B>
<P><B>One night my younger son and daughter were sleeping on the sofabed
in the </B>
<P><B>livingroom.  I woke up during the night to go to the bathroom and I
saw a </B>
<P><B>shadowy figure run toward the steps to go downstairs.  I yelled out
my sons </B>
<P><B>name because I thought it was him sleep walking.  I ran in the livingroom
</B>
<P><B>toward the stairs and when I turned I saw both him and my daughter
still </B>
<P><B>sleeping.</B>
<P>
<P><B>(story 5 )</B>
<P><B>One night I saw that blurr again, this time it looked as if it had
a brown </B>
<P><B>outline.  This was a first! Never saw that before. I woke up around
1:30 am </B>
<P><B>to see this hovering in my room again.  I shrugged it off ( because
I'm use </B>
<P><B>to it now ) and the next morning I was telling my sister ( she and
her </B>
<P><B>daughter live here too ) that I saw that blurr again. I told her that
I woke </B>
<P><B>up at 1:30 which was unusual.  She said that at approx. 1am, her daughter
</B>
<P><B>woke up and came in her room and told her she felt wierd and that she
didn't </B>
<P><B>want to sleep alone. She said she had a strange feeling and crawled
into my </B>
<P><B>sisters bed.  Meanwhile this kid ALWAYS sleeps alone  ( she's 13 )
and always </B>
<P><B>sleeps in the dark.  Never happened to her before or after...so far.
 Seems </B>
<P><B>strange we both woke up within a half hour of each other and she had
a </B>
<P><B>feeling and I saw something.</B>

<P>
<P><B>When I was 30 yrs. old my husband of ten years passed away and I feel
his</B>
<P><B>presence often.</B>
<P><B>I'm not afraid, but I know he had love in his heart for me.  We had
two</B>
<P><B>daughters together and</B>
<P><B>they also feel him near at times.  For example, in 1988 we bought a
new</B>
<P><B>pick-up truck a Ford</B>
<P><B>F-250, he just loved his truck.  He passed in 1990, and I had to sell
it to</B>
<P><B>buy a car for our remaining family.  Recently, I purchased a new 1999</B>
<P><B>Explorer also black like his truck, when</B>
<P><B>I drove it I felt his presence and smelled the same smell as when we
were</B>
<P><B>together.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is just one example of many stories I have to tell.</B>

<P><B>Pikake Flowers</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: roulett@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was young I used to spend alot of time in my backyard. When
I</B>
<P><B>play back there I usually smell a faint odor of pikake flowers which
is</B>
<P><B>a hawaiian flower that is used in leis. When I was practicing my</B>
<P><B>baseball swing one day I thought I saw a person in the bushes so I
waved</B>
<P><B>and when I caught the person's eyes I could see it was an old woman.</B>
<P><B>Well she started to walk toward me and as she passed the smell of
pikake</B>
<P><B>became overwelming and I couldn't move. as the old woman neared the</B>
<P><B>neighbors house I started to realize what she was because she moved
so</B>
<P><B>smoothly like a ballerina only she was an old wrinkly woman. Then she</B>
<P><B>went to the driveway and dissapered. after that I never went out into</B>
<P><B>the yard by myself again.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Not Sure What I am Seeing</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: B4UR2B1@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>A real skeptic here.  About ten years ago, I was in Acapulco, MX
vacationing </B>
<P><B>alone.  In my hotel one night I awoke and was startled by the face
of a </B>
<P><B>Mexican Indian intruder.  His face was within inches of mine.  I swung
at him </B>
<P><B>but there was no body.  The face rose back and upwards away from me
and just </B>
<P><B>disappeared.  I turned on the light and reflected on what had just
happened.  </B>
<P><B>I brushed it off and had a wonderful vacation.  About a year later
- almost </B>
<P><B>to the date, I was at my apartment in my room sleeping when I awoke
to find a </B>
<P><B>grayish figure levitating directly above my head.  I panicked and it
slowly </B>
<P><B>dissolved before my eyes.  Thereafter, the appearances have been different
</B>
<P><B>everytime but usually consisting of head, shoulder and torso.  The
same </B>
<P><B>pattern - I awake suddenly from my sleep and the figure is there almost
as if </B>
<P><B>studying me.  It always takes about 10 seconds to disappear or walk
away.  </B>
<P><B>The figures have been at the foot of my bed, above me and they have
even </B>
<P><B>walked across the room away from me.  I never see the faces and at
times they </B>
<P><B>are shadowy.  I am now living in another apartment and the apparitions
still </B>
<P><B>visit.  Could there be a logical explanation?  The figures may be carried
</B>
<P><B>over from my sleep?  It is scary because I always think there is an
intruder </B>
<P><B>in my room when I see them.  </B>
<P><B>What promped me to write and visit this Web sight is even wierder.
 A good </B>
<P><B>friend of mine, like a brother,  spent the night yesterday (shared
the same </B>
<P><B>bed with me and my dog).  I awoke and saw the appartion again while
he was </B>
<P><B>fast asleep.  I was slightly startled but made no commotion.  It
disappeared </B>
<P><B>and I went back to sleep.  I never discussed this with him although
a few </B>
<P><B>years ago I told him about it other sightings.  He's a bigger skeptic
than me. </B>
<P><B> The next day while driving in his car, he turned to me out of the
blue and </B>
<P><B>asked, "Do you still see those ghosts at night?"  I asked him if I
had </B>
<P><B>awakened him when I saw it last night.  He was surprised, having had
no idea </B>
<P><B>that it appeared to me.  He told me that he had a vivid and very real
</B>
<P><B>nightmare.  In his dream, we were in bed in the same positions (the
dog in </B>
<P><B>the middle), I woke him and pointed to the bottom of the bed where
he saw a </B>
<P><B>figure with an hideous smile.  It was the devil.  I begged my friend
to make </B>
<P><B>it go away and I told him that he visits and scares me all the time.
 I </B>
<P><B>handed my friend a wand and he swung it to no avail.  The devil remained
</B>
<P><B>defiant and grinning.  My friend then made a cross with his fingers
and </B>
<P><B>started praying, "Hail Mary, full of grace....." and the figure vanished.
 </B>
<P><B>After discussing this in the car, we were both astonished.  How can
this be?  </B>
<P><B>Why both in the same night?  My friend told me that he has never had
a more </B>
<P><B>realistic dream in his life and that he never feels afraid in his apartment
</B>
<P><B>but his skepticism is wearing thin.  </B>
<P><B>Any input would be appreciated.  I want to beleive there is a logical
</B>
<P><B>explanation.</B>

<P><B>The Beautiful Blonde Girl</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Kitten4915@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Hi, my name is joyce, and i too have seen and even HEARD  ghosts. 
My husband </B>
<P><B>and I built our own house on an empty lot in NY  back in 1985.   One
night  I </B>
<P><B>was awaken  and I looked to the doorway of our bedroom, and there stood
a man </B>
<P><B> just as plain as day.  He stood in the doorway, and just looked at
me.  I </B>
<P><B>must have gasped, I dont remember, but my husband sat up in bed ( I
was also </B>
<P><B>sitting up by this time), and asked what was wrong.  I said that someone
is </B>
<P><B>in here.  He jumped up , and ran right through the man.  My husband
didn't </B>
<P><B>even see him.  Then he just disapeared.  My husband came back and looked
at </B>
<P><B>me like I was crazy.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another time, I was sleeping in bed, and I was awaken to a small child
</B>
<P><B>calling, MOMMY, MOMMY.    My daughter was about 5 at the time, so I
opened my </B>
<P><B>eyes and listened , to make sure she was okay.  Again  the lil girl
called </B>
<P><B>out, MOMMY, MOMMY .    The voice was getting closer and closer, so
I looked </B>
<P><B>to the foot of my bed  to see my daughter, but it wasn't her that was
coming </B>
<P><B>toward me.   It was a beautiful  blonde haired girl that was about
8 years </B>
<P><B>old.  She wore a long white gown and had  her arms extended out to
me, and </B>
<P><B>she was calling to me, saying--mommy, mommy.   She got about 5 feet
away from </B>
<P><B>me, then she disapeared.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another time, in the same bedroom,  I woke up in the middle of the
night, and </B>
<P><B>i noticed  something at the foot of the bed.    Small round balloons
started </B>
<P><B>to rise from the floor, and a very small little boy was holding on
them, </B>
<P><B>rising up.  Then all of a sudden, the child disapeared. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I was talking to a few friends of mine, and I told them that  on our
deed to </B>
<P><B>the land that we have,  is part of the civil war  battleground.  I
didn't </B>
<P><B>realize that it came all the way up here in NY, but in the woods near
our </B>
<P><B>house is a wall made of stone, and a fence that has grown into the
trees.   </B>
<P><B>This friend of mine told me  that  maybe that man was the father of
the </B>
<P><B>children, and that they were killed there sometime way in the past.
 There </B>
<P><B>was no woman  that I saw,  and my friend said that they were looking
at me as </B>
<P><B>the wife/mother.   I haven't seen anything in about 6 years now, and
they told </B>
<P><B>me that maybe the mother came and got her family.   </B>
<P>
<P><B>Another time, way back when I was a child, I grew up in a haunted house
in </B>
<P><B>Cortland,NY.     I was washing my hair once in the kitchen at the sink.
When </B>
<P><B>I turned around, there was a very tall white  (thing)  standing in
front of </B>
<P><B>me.  It was very tall, that it towered over me.  For what seemed about
15 </B>
<P><B>seconds, it stood there, then it disapeared.    In the same house,
my brother </B>
<P><B>had seen a man croutched down in front of the toilet  like he was vomiting.
  </B>
<P><B>Once my mother was in the bathroom (that is next to the stairs that
lead to </B>
<P><B>the attic), and she heard someone wallking down the stairs, and she
was the </B>
<P><B>only one in the house.  They knocked on the wall to the bathroom. 
She </B>
<P><B>ignored it, and they kept knocking.  She got mad and opened the attic
door </B>
<P><B>(which she saw nothing), and yelled up to the room--I WANT YOU TO STOP
THAT </B>
<P><B>RIGHT NOW!!       Nothing more was done  to her.   I lived in this
house </B>
<P><B>until I was  19.  I have felt a presence in my bedroom constently.
 But it </B>
<P><B>was a pleasent feeling.   After my parents moved out and sold the old
house,  </B>
<P><B>the new people who moved in- tore apart walls and just ruined the place.
  </B>
<P><B>After they did that, the house has become very very cold.  It stays
cold all </B>
<P><B>the time, even in the winter.  I talked to a man that lives in there
now, and </B>
<P><B>he has seen the man by the toilet, has seen a small boy at the foot
of the </B>
<P><B>stairs that lead to the second floor, and his dog has gone to the stairs
and </B>
<P><B>barked and barked for no apparent reason.</B>

<P><B>Sensing the Supernatural</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Dandylyun@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>     Since I was very small I would see and hear things that no one
else </B>
<P><B>could. My earliest memory of this was when I was about two to three
years </B>
<P><B>old. I remember playing with an old man with a white beard. He would
come in </B>
<P><B>my bedroom and he had a white glow around him. I remember that he never
</B>
<P><B>talked but I knew how he was feeling all the time. I knew he was sad
for some </B>
<P><B>reason. My most vivid memory of him is the time he touched me. He felt
cold </B>
<P><B>and lonely. Yet I remember that it was like when someone holds ice
near </B>
<P><B>enough to your skin that you could feel the cold air against you. I
thought </B>
<P><B>it was weird that his hand on my hand was weightless. That was also
the last </B>
<P><B>time I saw him. We moved about a year later. I thought he was a part
of my </B>
<P><B>imagination until my mother and an aunt of mine were talking about
ghosts and </B>
<P><B>my mother mentioned, " The house on Prize Street was haunted. The lady
we </B>
<P><B>bought it from was a widow. She sold the house two weeks after her
husband </B>
<P><B>died in the small bedroom (my bedroom). Yes, I often saw a shadow in
the hall </B>
<P><B>and I think Andy used to see him. I stopped seeing him when I saw in
the </B>
<P><B>paper that his wife had passed on. After reading that I went in the
hall and </B>
<P><B>said to him that his wife was dead and he needed to look elsewhere."</B>
<P><B>        We moved to a new house and nothing unusual happened. When
I was </B>
<P><B>seven years old I had a best friend named Bridget. She always wore
fancy </B>
<P><B>shoes with anything she wore because she said she liked the tapping
noise </B>
<P><B>they made on the floor. Our families were very close and we were more
like </B>
<P><B>sisters. One night I woke up from a nightmare and decided to go to
bed with </B>
<P><B>my parents. I walked down the hall and told my dad to roll over so
I could </B>
<P><B>have room. On the edge of the bed I began to fall asleep until I hear
tapping </B>
<P><B>footsteps coming down the hall. I was scared because the hall was carpeted.
</B>
<P><B>In came Bridget wearing her favorite dress and shoes along with her
little </B>
<P><B>sister. They held hands and came near me standing next to the bed.
Bridget </B>
<P><B>and her sister giggled and for some reason I felt obligated to giggle
too. </B>
<P><B>The next morning my mom and dad woke me to tell me that Bridget and
her </B>
<P><B>sister were killed. Later I would learn that their father was the one
who </B>
<P><B>killed them and then himself after his wife asked for a divorce. I
think </B>
<P><B>Bridget was telling me goodbye and that she was ok now.</B>
<P><B>          As I got older I would sense things in places such as sadness
and </B>
<P><B>confusion. When I was twelve my great aunt died. She was 94 and blind
and </B>
<P><B>deaf. A week before she died she regained her sight and hearing. She
asked </B>
<P><B>many questions about her siblings (who had been dead for years) and
she </B>
<P><B>thanked my grandmother who had cared for her. My grandmother, thinking
my </B>
<P><B>greataunt was recovering was crushed when she fell asleep one night
and never </B>
<P><B>woke up. After the funeral the whole family slept at my grandparents
at the </B>
<P><B>request of my grandmother. She asked that my mother and all of her
other </B>
<P><B>children slept together in the living room. My cousin, Marcie, and
I decided </B>
<P><B>to join in so she slept on the floor next to the couch where I slept.
</B>
<P><B>Sometime in the night I awoke and sat up to see a hunched figure of
an old </B>
<P><B>woman glide across the floor slowly. Marcie was sitting up too. The
dark </B>
<P><B>figure went to my grandmother and kissed her head. It did the same
to all my </B>
<P><B>grandmother's children. It came over to the couch and sat on the edge.
</B>
<P><B>Frightened, I darted to the other side. My cousin held my hand tightly.
Then </B>
<P><B>the figure went down the hall and into my great aunts bedroom. In the
morning </B>
<P><B>Marcie and I avoided each other. She came up to me and said, " I had
a weird </B>
<P><B>dream that Auntie Marisol came and . . ." She must of saw my eyes widen
cause </B>
<P><B>she then said, "You two?" I said yes and then she left shaking.</B>
<P><B>         I would like to tell you of my most recent experiances which
are so </B>
<P><B>truly frightening that I cannot tell you right now. I must have more
strength </B>
<P><B>and time. I fear that I am indesperate need of help. I will try to
contact </B>
<P><B>you to tell you more. I am soo glad I found this place. Lately I have
felt so </B>
<P><B>alone and like a big freak . I am glad to see that others share some
similar </B>
<P><B>experiances. </B>

<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>My family &amp; I have had many supernatural experiences, dating from
the</B>
<P><B>1950's, some which I have directly experienced, others which come via
my</B>
<P><B>mother, who's grandmother was reputed to be "a witch"....</B>
<P>
<P><B>Possibly the most vivid experience happened when I was 12 years
old.....we</B>
<P><B>lived in a house built in 1880, and my bedroom was the room where my</B>
<P><B>father's uncle died, after an unhappy stage in his life....</B>
<P>
<P><B>Two years previously a friend of mine (Phillip ) &amp; I came back
from the</B>
<P><B>park, and on entering the house found it to be very cold, and with
a musty</B>
<P><B>smell...we started up the stairs to my room, when a misty appearance
began</B>
<P><B>to form at the top of the stairs...seemingly to emanate from my
room....I</B>
<P><B>can tell you we were scared...and fled the house. Phil never</B>
<P><B>returned....and I waited until I knew my parents were back from
work...</B>
<P>
<P><B>Then came the sequence of events which culminated in the most vivid</B>
<P><B>experience....</B>
<P>
<P><B>My parents had gone out for the evening and I was at home, having
watched</B>
<P><B>Tv etc and finished my homework I went up to bed...my room was always</B>
<P><B>cold...despite having central heating...and I turned out the lights,
got</B>
<P><B>under the sheets and lay there awaiting sleep...</B>
<P>
<P><B>Suddenly the lights in my room came on...the switch was by the door
on the</B>
<P><B>far side of the room...without anyone being by the door...I got up,
and on</B>
<P><B>opening the door discovered that every single light in the house was</B>
<P><B>burning (despite the fact that I had turned them all off (expect the</B>
<P><B>downstairs hallway light)....going round the house I turned all the
lights</B>
<P><B>off....and returned to bed....huddled under the sheets and
blankets....this</B>
<P><B>happened twice that night...ad I can tell you it really freaked me
out...</B>
<P>
<P><B>It seems that our family were followed by spirits, as every house we
moved</B>
<P><B>to we expeienced psychic  activity of some sort....</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well thought I'd relay that one to you...see what you think...I can
tell</B>
<P><B>you more about my experiences if you are interested.</B>

<P><B>Spirit Security</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: MarkMa@fox.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>With a Spiritualist background, I have become most understanding of
the Spirit world and have</B>
<P><B>some memorable experiences, one of which I should like to relate to
you.   For approximately</B>
<P><B>fourteen years, from 1978-1992, I lived in a single apartment in Burbank.
 It contained a </B>
<P><B>bed-sitting room, a kitchen, a dressing area and bathroom.  It had
a large picture window which</B>
<P><B>overlooked a garden courtyard, and next to the window was the front
door.   The kitchen and </B>
<P><B>bathroom area was over a carport, so it was technically one floor above
the ground level, while </B>
<P><B>the bed-sitting area opened directly onto an obviously filled courtyard
at ground level.   </B>
<P><B>Many times, around one or two o*clock in the morning, I would be awakened
by a noise near the </B>
<P><B>doorway, followed by a clicking of the lock.   Whenever I checked to
see if anyone was there, I </B>
<P><B>would find the entry and the courtyard empty.  One evening,  I was
up late at 1:30AM and reading</B>
<P><B>on the sofa in front of the window, when I heard the lock on the door
click, and I noticed that</B>
<P><B>the doorknob was turning slightly to the left and the right.  Quickly
pulling open the curtains</B>
<P><B>of the window, I was surprised to find no-one standing outside the
door or in the courtyard.   </B>
<P><B>This phenomenon went on every night for limited periods.   As years
progressed, I observed that </B>
<P><B>it would happen in the months of September thru October, then again
from February thru March.</B>
<P><B>Being psychically attuned, whenever these phenomena would occur, I
could progressively sense a </B>
<P><B>presence, first moving from the kitchen area, into the bed sitting
area and finally to the door.</B>
<P><B>The door handle would slightly move, the locks would click, and the
presence would move back in</B>
<P><B>to the kitchen and be gone.   One evening, I borrowed a neighbor's
cat, having it stay with me </B>
<P><B>through two successive nights.   When the phenomenon occurred on those
nights, the cat's eyes </B>
<P><B>were quite wide as it followed a spirit presence moving from the kitchen,
into the bed sitting </B>
<P><B>room to the door.  The cat reacted when the locks clicked, then it
watched the presence move back</B>
<P><B>toward the kitchen area, finally settling down when the spirit left.
   </B>
<P><B>Within the week of that particular visitation, I did some research.
 I discovered that the </B>
<P><B>apartment complex I lived in; one which is comprised of over 18 separate
buildings, sits on what</B>
<P><B>once was the extended portion  of the Columbia Studios ranch, a movie
lot of exterior sets and a</B>
<P><B>few stages.  The movie lot is now greatly reduced from its original
size and when much of its </B>
<P><B>land was sold, the apartment complex and a shopping center was built
on the former studio </B>
<P><B>property.   The remainder of the Columbia Ranch lot is now owned by
Warner Bros. and still stands</B>
<P><B>about one block to the east of my former apartment complex, which has
recently been remodeled,  </B>
<P><B>When doing my research, I discovered that the apartment building in
which I had lived sat on a </B>
<P><B>portion of the Columbia Ranch which contained the back lot exterior
set of Shangri-La, from the</B>
<P><B>original production of *Lost Horizon.*  This set had several platform
levels and behind it was</B>
<P><B>a row of scene docks and a guard house which opened to an exit from
the lot.  </B>
<P><B>This gave me a clear insight as to what may have been going on in my
apartment.   It is common </B>
<P><B>practice for studio guards to make the rounds of the lots and check
for locked doors, and </B>
<P><B>specialized movie sets are often given additional security treatment,
usually if it is a *hot* </B>
<P><B>set with expensive props and other accouterments left intact and overnight
throughout an extended</B>
<P><B> period of filming.   I instinctively felt right away that my periodic
visitor may have been a </B>
<P><B>Spirit security guard who was checking my door, checking the locks
and then moving on to his </B>
<P><B>other *rounds.*   I sensed a male energy from the spirit, an aura of
the spirit*s last </B>
<P><B>incarnation, and he may have very well been a former studio security
guard.   He always entered </B>
<P><B>from the kitchen, one floor above the driveways and carports, but this
is probably due to the </B>
<P><B>fact that the set which once stood on the property had several platform
levels.   The routine was</B>
<P><B> always the same: a light touch on the door, a slight turning of the
handle, then a very audible</B>
<P><B> click of the locks.   </B>
<P><B>Needless to say, the experience gave me quite a feeling of security.
 I always felt safe in that </B>
<P><B>apartment, and when I moved out of it in 1992, I did a blessing of
all the rooms, so that the </B>
<P><B>next tenant would enjoy its ambiance as much as I had.   I also did
a blessing for my Spirit </B>
<P><B>security guard* letting him know that he could *retire* when he wished,
for he was, indeed, in </B>
<P><B>Spirit.  I hope that he has moved on into the Light.    </B>
