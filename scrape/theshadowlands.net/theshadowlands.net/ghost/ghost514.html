<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Not Sure But I Saw<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hi,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I&#8217;ve been living in my home since 1999 an
nothing really happened for years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do
know<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the owner died in the driveway on a
prep trip for vacation suddenly of an undiagnosed aortic aneurysm.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Years later his wife died of Gallbladder
cancer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we went to to the viewing
of this women there was a small box. White, wrapped in pink fabric and
we
learned that this women had had a stillborn many years before.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing seems to have caught my attention
until my nephew his two year old daughter and pregnant girlfriend moved
in. I
heard running in the house when no one was around and I heard
disturbances like
doors slamming and opening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do know,
the wind picks up in the afternoon, but on days when I would water the
yard it
seemed like the house was full of people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One time after my nephews girlfriend gave birth<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I came home the kids were crying and it was a
very hot day so they decided to go to a small park for relief.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>As they left and I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>stood
at the doorway and I heard a small
child laugh almost a giggle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked
out side the doorway and saw no one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
I just thought,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They really need a
break. One day I came home from work and sat on a chair that faces the
small
hallway in the front door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I took off
my shoes and sat back I saw a weird object in the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>looked like doll hair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m 53
years old and I know fake doll hair when I see it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was about four feet off the ground and it
was moving ever so so slowly towards the front door.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I looked at my nephew he was on the couch and
talking to his girlfriend as she was making dinner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But I could still see this blob of shiny
golden doll hair going towards the front doorway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
looked at my nephew and his girlfriend and
thought, they have to have seen it but they were too much into
themselves it
didn&#8217;t seem to be noticed. I sat back and thought<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that&#8217;s
weird.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I didn&#8217;t say anything at first, but a couple of days later I
asked my
nephew if he remembered that day and he said &#8220; yes&#8221;,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was surprised but he told me he could tell
I was looking at something and looking at them and he didn&#8217;t see
anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have moved out. but<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I still hear noise like I have a full house
and
children running in the hall way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
night as I was watching TV<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and it was
windy there was a definite three knocks on the patio window.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I just asked they coma back later.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Then o bought a fake flower arrangement to
put in the back yard for decoration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
about 11:30pm<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw a shadow at the
sliding glass doorway to the backyard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was static,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I definitely
looked like the shadow of the flowers I bought.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>when I looked away to put a drinking glass down it was gone.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>At first, I thought someone was playing a
trick on me but then when I went to see.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>there&#8217;s chairs and a small table this person had to hover over
and make
noise to get the angle the flowers I saw<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>show as a shadow on the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
my nephew and his little family lived with me I got engaged but he died
four
months later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few day later after the
service for him a very good friend of his who eulogized for him wrote
me a
letter that said I was a very good influence on my departed
Fianc&eacute;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After I read the letter,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in the backyard and for some reason I
decided to water the plants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I stood
and watered I realized that I could see the color blue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My house color is green and the grass was
green , What was the blue?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t
really look at it, but my eyes could make out only the front part of
blue
colored pants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No feet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then I could make out there was a top
part,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>like the front of blue scrubs,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>no arms and no head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
suddenly thought,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>this was the favorite
scrubs my fianc&eacute; liked
to wear to &#8220; Thank You &#8220;, I really think he came back to say Good bye
and that
he agreed with his friends letter.More has happened but I doesn't scare
me I
just fell like some ones keeping an eye one me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thanks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Athens,
Louisiana<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I grew up in an old
two story
house in Athens, Louisiana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There have
been several strange thins that have happened there. This is only one
of
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several years ago my wife and I
were visiting my parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember it
was winter and very cold. My mother was visiting my aunt so it was only
my dad,
my wife and myself there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>retreated to "the big room" to play
the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>piano. The room was ice cold. I
played for about fifteen minutes when I felt my wife put her hands on
my right
shoulder. I felt her body against my back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I smiled and turn to look at her..... there was no one there. I
quickly
left the room and went back to the living room where my Dad and wife
were
sitting. I didn't say a word about what happened in "the big
room".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then suddenly the entire
room filled with the intense fragrance of roses. We all smelt it and
were
asking each other where is that smell coming from. We searched the room
and
couldn't find a thing. Mind you this was in the dead of winter.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>As quickly as the fragrance came it left.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I
would like to share my Grandmother's brief
story. I will write it, since she doesn't speak much English. She has
always
told the story, and has never found an explanation for her experience.
In 1937,
she was 16 years old, and decided one day to lie in bed for a while, as
she was
tired from the morning activities. She lay down in bed, and after a few
minutes, she put her arms up and behind her head, sort of laying them
on her
pillow next to her head. Once she did that, she felt as though she was
floating,
sort of. She could not move her arms, could not scream, talk, move her
head, or
anything else that could let her parents know how she was feeling. She
saw
nothing, but felt a strong pressure on her arms, as if impeding her
from
moving. She felt like this for what she thought was over 30 minutes.
Finally,
she slowly started to regain the ability to move and speak, and got up
and
never told anyone but her mother, who shrugged it off and attributed it
to a
dream. Shortly after she was married, in 1943, she had forgotten the
incident,
and made the same movement of placing her arms up behind her head in
bed, and
the same thing happened to her. My grandfather was asleep, and again
she could
not move or speak or anything. It wore off slowly once again, and she
never
shared it with him. It has never happened again, but she has never
again to
this day, made that<span style="">&nbsp; </span>gesture, because she
has been afraid ever since those two incidents. Plus, she couldn't do
it now
anyway, because of a torn shoulder ligament.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Experience<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">How about another
story?...I
also had a near death experience, before kindergarten. We lived in a
houseboat
on the Washington side of the Columbia River and I was jumping between
houses,
little chunks of driftwood floated all over; I decide to add more
thrill to the
game and place my foot on a black plastic pipe. Then I decided to put
some
weight on the pipe and...SWOOSH! Down I go and I remember vividly
looking up
through the water and seeing the sun shine through the many small
pieces of
driftwood. Next thing I can remember, I'm in the extra bedroom (my toy
room) in
a panic because I didn't want my Mom to catch me with wet clothes on
then she
would know I fell in??? Also around the same age at same location, my
soon to
be stepdad was on the top of the bank with a friend; both had chainsaws
and
were cutting loose logs from high water. Well they didn't notice my
five year
old frame until the log started rolling down the bank as I'm toodling
along the
waterline! This next part happened so fast- they scream at me to move,
I look
up and start running back the way I had come...the length of the log.
I'm
watching that log get bigger and bigger and next thing I know I'm
running into
the river and that log rolled right over me but in the water...so I was
not
hurt???I have more ghost stories if your interested? I really got a
charge
after reading ALL the different experiences on your Shadowlands
website. A
couple of those stories and many of your folks photos definitely gave
me the
heebie-jeebies! goose bumps! and the shiver me timbers! Kudos to you
all!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I am not quite sure
why I
crossed this topic after 20 years.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
worked at Humboldt Brewery when I was 18, bottling beer and then moving
into
the kitchen on dish duty, quite busy Saturday nights and I was one of
two people
in the place at closing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night my
coworker was in the bottling room and I was in the dish room, on
opposite ends
of the building and I heard some of the cabinets closing in the
employee lounge
immediately next to the dish room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
acknowledged the presence and had a conversation with a male spirit who
had
died in the building though the reported cause of death was not
actually what
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He expressed his
disappointment that someone he loved and trusted did not share his
feelings.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have never researched
the articles but I
intend to find out.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Michigan Update
on Mcmoran Theater<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My Uncle is a
Janitor at the
theater, and we have had personal investigations there. Since we were
beginners
it was more of personal experience because the equipment that we
brought, which
all had full batteries and extra batteries, ended up all draining. It's
said
that in the left side of the balcony, there is a workers that has been
seen
walking around that section. When we sat in the section and started
asking questions
about having lost seats, my group( of 5 people) started hearing
shuffling and
the seats started moving behind us. We moved from that section and did
not
return. As we walked around the theater, my Uncle discussed how there
is said
that a young boy<span style="">&nbsp; </span>plays tricks on the
stage at night. In the first two seats in the middle section of the
theater,
there is said that when the theaters openig day two sisters sat there
and by
the end of the show, they were dead. Nothing was really felt or seen in
that
section. When we went into the basement into the women's dressing room
we
started asking questions again. As we waited there, the elevator that
is no
longer in use turned on and opened its doors in the basement. Obviously
nobody
was in the elevator cause we where the only ones there , on top of my
Uncle
locking all of the doors so we would not have any interuptions. Then as
we sat
in the dressing room, circus music<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>started playing, with some kind of mumbling. It lasted for more
than a
minute. After this my Uncle checked all the speakers and surround
system, which
was off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also because the building was
once a firehouse station, sometimes pennies are heard thrown from the
side
balconies, people say its some fire fighters who died in the fire that
hit the
building. We did experience something paranormal ,but my Uncle has
stories that
even happen during the day. If you ask, the owners are more than
welcome to
show people around. Usually activity is the highest, after a play or
performance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From my own experiences, I
would say this is a place that is very active. If you have any
questions I am
more than happy to help answer them for you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My husband and I
bought a house
through HUD in 1989. I was the only one working (which was most of the
time) in
Gaston, South Carolina in the area right off of Hwy 321. The house was
about
20yrs old I guess and we had heard that several years ago a family
lived there
in which a grandmother had past in the Master Bed Room in which we were
sleeping in.Of course, I am very open to Spirits, reincarnation and all
of a
lot of earthly incarnations that (most) people say is just in our minds.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>One night, my husband was having a nightmare.
I shook him several times calling out his name and all he did was just
toss and
turn back and forth. It took me several times trying to wake him with
no luck.
While he was dreaming, he kept on saying "No, I don't want to go
there". All of a sudden he just stopped. When he opened his eyes, they
scared the (excuse me for saying this) HELL OUT OF ME) They were wide
open and
fire red. At that point, a beautiful elderly lady came drifting out of
our walk
in closet went floating above him and I'm assuming she was
communicating to
him. As she stayed afloat above him, his eyes slowly turned back to the
original color of brown. He said to her;Thank you for saving me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, the most beautiful smile came
over her face and she drifted back into our walk in closet. It took
several
days for him to speak of it because I wanted to make sure he actually
seen this
or if he thought it was in his mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
we finally were able to talk about it, he (my husband) explained that
the Devil
was trying to turn him and with that take his life. He said he had a
very
strong pressure on his chest like someone was putting a clamp on his
heart to
stop it and the elderly lady made the Devil vanish into the Brightest
Light he
ever saw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this day, even though I am
not married to this man any longer, we are still good friends and every
once in
a while we bring that elderly lady to mind and how she saved his life.
Thank
God for our Guardians.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>irdunnick@frontier.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My family moved
into a new
house in Sunnyvale Cca 1963. We across the street from Pippin school.
The first
night there was tapping on the window stills. Over the course of 22
years, my
parents lived there we had activity all the time. i had pinecone lift
out of a
basket and were hurled at me. The door would bang and knocking from the
inside
of the header room. Dolls in my room would move their arms and blink
their
eyes. The bathroom room door would open ans shut all night by it's
self. On
several occasions we heard voices, once turning the day music was
coming from
the fireplace. The last time I was alone in that house was 1984, I went
to
water the plants while my folks were gone during my lunch break. I
walked in
sat my mcdonalds bag down on the kitchen counter, went to the back
bedroom bath
to water a plant. When I came back the pullout type stove top was
pulled out
and all burners were red hot. I shut them off close the element drawer
walked
out and never was alone there again. My parents sold the house in 1985,
those
people lasted about a year. I have been by the house several times
always want
to knock on the door and ask about the house. Since I moved out of
there in
1970 it took almost 10yrs to get rid of ghost activity, light coming on
by
themselves in the middle of the night, being slapped in the back of the
head
and no one around, just can't risk starting that stuff up
again....everyone in
our house and visitor had these experiences.If anyone else in the area
had a
ghost, demon whatever experience would love to hear about. My house was
about 1
mi from the haunted Toys are Us store.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Lonesome Patient<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>murasakix2@msn.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I work at a
hospital in N.C.,
about 20 miles from my home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I work on
the 2nd Floor, with 90% patients in their 80's on up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I looked after a patient that was in her 90's
for almost a month.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eventually, she
was
put on "Comfort Measures", a title given to patients that were not
getting any better and the move to a hospice would hurt them.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Day in and day out she lived air it seemed,
not being able to eat, and seemed like she was waiting for someone.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Turned out her only son was on the other side
of the world and it was taking him a couple of days to come<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>to say his last farewell.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The nurses said that he was coming the next
day and told me a very vivid story of the lady's life.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lady was about 4 foot 5, with a fluffy
crown of white curly hair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had the
prettiest blue eye---on one side, but had a cataract in the other eye,
giving
it a milky, strange hue and gruesome character---most definitely that
could be
described in depth in Edgar Allen Poe's THE TELLTALE HEART. Oh the
lighter
side, she had also been a military wife that had travelled all over the
world
with her husband, who had been in TWO World Wars: I and II as a pilot.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She died only 6 hours before her son finally
showed up. All during her stay at the hospital, I talked to her as I
turned
her, gave her drops of juice, or bathed her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I talked to her as my partner aide helped me put her in a body
bag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As her room was cleaned and made
ready for
another patient, I felt weird like she was still occupying that room
but then
pushed the thought from my mind and resumed my duties on my floor and
got ready
to go home. The rest of the morning was uneventful as I hopped into my
car and
headed down the highway to go home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was 7:30 in the morning and the skies were over-cast so seemed a lot
like dawn
instead of around 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I noticed a
movement in my rear view mirror and when I focused in the back seat,
imagine my
surprise and horror at seeing the same lady sitting, and smiling at me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Man, my arms jerked from the surprise and I
almost went off the road so I had to pull over.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"WHAT IN GOD'S NAME ARE YOU DOING IN MY CAR?!"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I bellowed in fright to the specter. "I'm
going home with you since you were so nice to me all during my stay at
the
hospital, " the specter answered with what she could mimic as a
smile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"You're more nicer to me
than my son, you know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He never visited
me when I was sick!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The specter
looked so sad that my heart went out to her and I forgot that I almost
had a
heart attack and wrecked my car at the same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Granny,&#8221;
I said a bit more softly as
she looked at me with such a sad longing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"You do know that you are dead right?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granny
nodded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"When you are dead, the world is
your
oyster.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have heard that you can travel
all over the world in a blink and do what you've always wanted to do
but
couldn't in this world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why would you
want to hang around me in a small town when you can go visit all the
people
you've missed in your life? "<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"That's
true!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The specter exclaimed, her
visage much less scary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"You are
right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will take your
advice!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said and POOF--- faded
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had to sit there for a couple of
minutes since it wasn't always that a person has a conversation with a
ghost in
her vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I breathed a sigh of
relief, put the car in gear, and drove back onto the highway towards
home and
promptly forgot about the incident a couple of months later......until
a
patient one night hysterically called me into her room and begged me to
pull
back the drapes, look in the bathroom, and open the closets in her room
because
she was convinced that there was a person hiding in her room.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The patient had been getting alot of heavy
duty drugs and knew that maybe she could be hallucinating but told me
that this
lady kept constantly coming up to her and waking her up, trying to tell
her
something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I know I must be
imagining it but seriously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was just
so REAL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the lady keeps waking me
up!!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told me, her voice
rising.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"What should I do?"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The next time she comes, let her finish
her story to you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe she feels that
she needs to tell you something," I told the patient.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Two hours later and the patient frantically
called me again to come into her room and search it top to bottom.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>This time the patient told me that she
listened to the lady, who told her that her husband had been a pilot in
both
World War I and II and she had a son that she had been waiting for but
never
showed up to see her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WAIT A MINUTE!<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>"What did the lady look like," I
asked (already knowing what the patient would say.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"She was a short lady with white cottony
hair and had a weird eye..."I put the lady at ease by saying that the
noisy visitor was a patient on the floor with Sun Downers--a kind of
Alzheimer's that happens to older people during the evening and night
hours--
and that I would make sure that the lady stayed in her room from then
on and
quickly went out in the hall to pray for the ghost, since I felt her
presence
and lingering anger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told the ghost
that her son did indeed come to see her, but too late and why it took
him so
long to come to NC to see her and say goodbye.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I also told the ghost that she needed to get over her anger and
move on,
maybe visit her son to say HER goodbyes, then go from there because all
this
haunting was a waste of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I nor any
of the patients on my floor ever saw the lady ghost again.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Witches of
Tularosa<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>killerdee187@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Legend has it that
Tularosa,
N.M. is full of witches, witchcraft, and other assorted dark arts.
There was a
little girl that was so beautiful with her black hair and blue/green
eyes that
she looked like a living doll that went to school in 1950 to 1st grade.
She was
only there for a couple of months before she got very ill with
Rheumatic fever.
She was so ill that she was not expected to recover. For 2 years the
little
girl laid in her bed, loved and nursed by her family, she eventually
did get
better and returned to school. Because she was as tiny as she was
beautiful,
she fit right in with the other 1st graders on the surface. All the
kids were
sure that she was a witch and that was why she had survived her near
fatal
illness. (Back then most did die of the disease.) They gave her the
nickname
Wanda the Witch and there was a rumor that began to circulate that
there were
to be 3 "Witches of Tulie." That they would be the most beautiful
girls in town born from a witch and that they would enchant all the men
in town
to their doom. This little girl they suspected was to be the mother of
these witches.
Because she had already survived the illness, they were afraid to do
anything
to her, so she grew up and eventually did marry a man. The first of her
3
children were all girls, and all very beautiful but very different from
each
other. These girl came to be know as the Witches of Tulie even though
they
themselves do not understand why. It is said that when their youngest
brother
was very ill with cancer and surviving only because of the life support
machines, they went to visit him. Although hospital policy stated that
only 2
people were allowed back at once, they convinced the staff to allow all
3 of
them back at the same time. He wasn't responding to any stimulus
whatsoever
before thier visit, but he was trying to wake up before the staff came
in and
made them leave saying that they were upsetting the patient. The
patient woke
up that night and was back in his hospital room on Thanksgiving Day. He
made a
full recovery and is now married for almost a year. They have been seen
walking
in the wind all together (and seperately), with the wind not touching
them in
any way, they have also been seen walking all together (and
seperately), with
the wind not blowing but seeming to blow only them. Time slows down or
speeds
up in their presence, things happen around them that don't normally
happen,
there have been several skeptics that were far less skeptical after
spending
time around these women. Yet they themselves claim NOT to be witches,
that they
don't know or understand the why of things happening or not happening
(such as
the case may be), around them. The health of the oldest of them seems
to affect
the weather, if she is very ill, it's cloudy and cold, the wind blows
and it
rains. (weird for the desert). There have been people that after
harming or
trying to harm these women that those people's lives have fallen apart
in all
kinds of ways, the person might seem to profit from it at first, but it
has
turned on every single one of them. They are not evil women, just
dangerous.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Ghosts Above Our
Bed <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">by: Kevin James Shay<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This incident
occurred about
14 years ago in October 1997 at the Chaska House, a bed and breakfast
in
Waxahachie, TX.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m a journalist who
formerly worked for The Dallas Morning News and now works for papers
owned by
the Washington Post. So I like to get my facts straight before I write
anything.I haven&#8217;t written about this before, but reading some items
about the
Catfish Plantation in Waxahachie sort of inspired me to tell this, for
what
it&#8217;s worth. The Catfish Plantation, a nice restaurant that serves good
food,
has long been written about as a haunted site.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There are basically three ghosts seen, heard or felt there,
according to
reports: a farmer named Will Anderson who built the Victorian house
around 1900
and died there in the 1930s; Elizabeth Anderson, the daughter of Will
who was
reportedly strangled in the dwelling on the day of her wedding around
1920,
perhaps by her ex-boyfriend or an old girlfriend of her husband; and a
woman
named Caroline Mooney, who lived in the house from 1953 until 1970. <span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>The house was also the birthplace of Paul
Richards, a former manager of the Baltimore Orioles and Chicago White
Sox who
played for the Detroit Tigers and other teams.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Restaurant workers have reported wineglasses being broken a lot,
perhaps
by Caroline who didn&#8217;t like people drinking. The place burned in 2003
but was
renovated. During renovations, workers said tools disappeared or were
moved. As
one worker put up a pane of glass, he noticed writing on dust on the
window
that read, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be scared.&#8221; The Catfish Plantation&#8217;s owners,
customers and
even police officers have reported seeing objects in the restaurant
moving
around by themselves, clocks resetting by themselves, and other
mysterious
sights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My ex-wife and I ate at the
Catfish Plantation several times when we were married between 1995 and
2006.
But we didn&#8217;t see or hear anything paranormal. However, we did have an
experience at the bed and breakfast not far from the Catfish Plantation
that we
haven&#8217;t forgotten.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1997, I worked for
the Morning News and was writing a Halloween-themed article about how
cities
such as Waxahachie used haunted attractions to draw visitors and pump
in money
to local restaurants and other businesses. On this evening, we visited
several
haunted attractions, including Screams in Waxahachie, for the story I
was
writing. And we slept at the Chaska House, a Victorian Revival-style
bed and
breakfast in the middle of downtown Waxahachie that was built in 1900
and
listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was just down
the street
from the Catfish Plantation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went to
sleep before midnight not expecting anything unusual. But around 2
a.m., I woke
up for some reason and looked over at my ex-wife. I was surprised to
see her
eyes wide open and a look of fear on her face as she fixed her gaze
above the
bed. Then I heard the distinct sound of laughter. It was high-pitched
like an
adolescent. I heard a voice say something like, &#8220;Look, she&#8217;s scared."
And
then laugh. I looked up and observed three ghostly figures flying in a
figure
eight motion above the bed near the ceiling a few feet above us. Two
had female
faces, with the third a male, similar to the three ghosts seen by some
at the
Catfish Plantation. Perhaps they had traveled down the street to our
room. Needless
to say, I was surprised. But I was not abnormally frightened as my
ex-wife was.
I had read about ghost stories since I was a kid and heard a few tales
from my
mom that were interesting, including she believing she had seen the
spirit of
my older sister, who had died when she was only nine. I had also
covered
stories of haunted houses, stayed in a few at night and known some
psychics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I hadn&#8217;t really seen or
heard a ghost
until this incident in the bed and breakfast. I was fascinated and sat
up,
trying to look closer to make sure I was really seeing some ghosts.
They looked
like wisps of light for their bodies, with detailed faces. I then
realized how
scared my ex-wife was and didn&#8217;t think to ask the ghosts any questions.
I just
told them to leave in a fairly loud, firm voice, and they did,
seemingly
vanishing in the air. I looked outside the bedroom and didn&#8217;t see
anything. The
following morning, my ex-wife and I told the bed and breakfast host
what we had
seen and asked if others had ever reported any similar incidents. He
said they
had, but unlike the Catfish Plantation, they didn&#8217;t like to publicize
their
ghostly visits. He said similar reports came from several other
century-old
homes in the Waxahachie area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I haven&#8217;t
heard or seen anything like that since then &#8211; at least nothing that
clear. But
each year around Halloween, I remember the incident in the Waxahachie
bed and
breakfast. It helps me believe that life continues after we die.<span

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">UPDATE on Haunted
Woods in
Florida<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>mustang-girl85@apnranch.com<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is an update
to a story
I posted a while ago on here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have
learned of some interesting information about what my haunting in those
woods
was and it is something that either was or is still attached to me. I
have
looked up demonic haunts and this sounds like it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had to think back and re trace steps into
my child hood in N.H to really notice some interesting incidents.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was a child, I don&#8217;t really remember
my age I was possibly 8 maybe and I used ot sneak into my <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">parents bed on the
2nd floor
next to my room. One maybe early morn or evening I spoke to a something
in that
closet saying &#8220;Don&#8217;t be scared, you can come out.&#8221; Now as a typical kid
I was
scared of the dark and normally hide my face so this was odd. Another
few
happenings as I started to think back and speak of my encounter of
thinking I
saw my dead Dog Vixen in the house, I realized that the shadow of the
dog
couldn&#8217;t have been unless Vixen had learned to stand up right.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Another happening was I felt like a hand
touched me in my parents bedroom I could distinctively feel four
fingers and a
thumb touch my back in their bed, my dad wasn&#8217;t in the room but as soon
as he
entered to lay down I told him what I felt, he told me it was my
imagination
but that feeling still stuck with me. This was the first house I lived
in until
I was 11 yrs old. There were some times I felt uneasy but never thought
anything of it.. I was a kid so I really didn&#8217;t put much thought into
it.
Florida 1996 June,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was 11yrs old and
moved ot South Worth nothing really happened. I felt good until
Christmas
of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1998 and felt that this wouldn&#8217;t
last. Now from 1999 to 2000 I don&#8217;t know why<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>but I really can&#8217;t get all the events in order or remember what
could
have really started it becoming more prominent I just know it did. I
know I was
in Middle school at this time in North port Middle. I had about 4
friends I
hung out with when home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know I wrote
the events in the other note I sent. Here&#8217;s a recap. I experienced our
woods
moving with nothing really there crashing and sounding like breaking of
tree
limbs in the dark, The smell of something dead only in one spot the
wind
doesn&#8217;t carry it. We have smelt it normally in the woods. But I have
experienced something feeling like it wanted in my house. My dog would
attack
the windows and sliding glass door like something was there. My dog is
another
GSD (German shepherd Dog). I felt like something was peering into the
windows
from the outside. For a GSD she was pretty laid back and was friendly
to all
animals I had never in my time seen her get aggressive and snarl the
way she
did. I would feel a heaviness and a feeling of something coming if we
were
outside so I would bring her in with me. Once my friend of mine was
over and
she and I were to stay in the guest bedroom it had two beds and I
didn&#8217;t like
staying in my bedroom anymore the one of the windows blinds came
crashing down
without a slam or anything. I still was a bit skeptical in some ways of
what
was going on and trying to ignore it until the woods incident which
caused the
most fear and anxiety. I felt like I was being watched everywhere and I
have
seen eyes in the woods looking back at me. I even once felt as though
something
was behind me chasing me. My friends had accounts of a dark shadow with
glowing
red eyes when they came running but I really wasn&#8217;t there and don&#8217;t
know if
they really did or were feeding off of my fear. At some point I must
have
gotten a bit tired of being afraid and getting anxiety attacks when I
thought
something was near I guess. I found my bible I had (not very religious)
and
took it with me to the woods and sat down in a clearing where I read to
myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t feel anything
unwelcoming when I entered or exited I was expecting to see something
but to no
avail. It did go quiet for a bit. Year 2000 was when everyone was
worried of
the end. I then had another feeling that my Dog Star my GSD would not
make it
to see 2001. Who knew how right I was. She had to be put down before
the year
was over as her over protectiveness and a friend who didn&#8217;t want to
stop
taunting her and a faulty leash all came into play as she bit him. Now
with no
dog to let me<span style="">&nbsp; </span>know of intruder at the
windows I was alone. My mom feeling I was lonely go with her to find a
new dog.
No more of the GSD we always had but a rat terrier a puppy on my summer
vacation. The first night with her I slept on the floor which was kinda
where I
had been sleeping for a while as I was to worried of going ot any room
where a
window is too close to a bed. The terrier started growling at nithing
but
stared out to the sliding glass door. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Before
Christmas in 2000 we moved to a new home where I hoped the thing would
stop. It
did for a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>time. Now this where I started
to realize something as I went through my memories and realized that
maybe
something goes dormant only to come back after some time. Once again I
had a
lull in happenings. Not until high school when I remember my grandma
came to
visit one of her times to our house. My grandma stayed in my room as
dad hadn&#8217;t
at the time fixed up the other room down the hall to be a guest room. I
was
lying in bed when I started seeing this black mass over the bed that
grandma
was sleeping in. I thought it was my eyes I rubbed them blinked and it
was
still there at this time a feeling of dread came over me and chills. I
ran out
of the room took some water and splash it on my face hopeful it
wouldn&#8217;t be
there when I returned it was still there. I stayed under my covers, I
didn&#8217;t
want to disturb grandma in fear it was my imagination. I woke up and
grandma
had woken up before me to get breakfast I was relieved she was alright.
I
should say my terrier pup stayed with my mom and dad while my grandma
stayed
with us so I had no way of knowing if she saw anything. This was only
one
occurrence of seeing something but the feeling was back. Once again I
would get
feelings of something was going to happen just didn&#8217;t know what. In my
last
year of high school I lost my nephew to drowning in our pool. He then
walked
our house for some time. He followed my sister and his dad to their new
home. I
then went into myself and wasn&#8217;t as outgoing as I once was. Somehow got
my self
back with horse riding and training and got my first horse to own and
train. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I haven&#8217;t experienced anything but
I wonder if
that&#8217;s only because I haven&#8217;t stayed too long in any place as I have
now left
and am living the army life. I do own a home in Texas and sometimes
when home I
do experience un easiness and my dogs now 2 a Chihuahua and a GSD who
is the
most friendliest dog I have met allows anyone in my house but<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>sometimes gives the scariest growl of
something outdoors. We do have 8 acres and one time our Donkey who has
always
only bray if there is danger has done so without us finding evidence of
anything outside. When riding I have a mustang that I trained and he is
the
first horse I owned I have taken him out for a ride and sometimes he
doesn&#8217;t
want to enter the back woods we have. He is never a spooky horse or
scaredy cat
of any wild animal we have come across a lynx and no flinch or reaction
or even
an alligator that has given us a growl.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He sometimes persist that we shouldn&#8217;t go back after some urging
he will
go back there but with veering side to side and not wanting to stop and
look
around. Other times we can go out there with no problems. I asked
around the
area if they have seen any large cats or anything but nothing in the
area we
are located in Texas Mountain lion or Puma are not found too much in as
we do
not have the right environment for them. When I am inside I do
sometimes when
home get the urge to leave all lights on to get rid of any shadow play.
Sometimes I can feel safe and sleep peace full and other times I
cannot. I am
starting to notice a pattern and now trying to keep a log of events and
when I
am home permanently I will definitely write more on the events if any
more
should come up in the future. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This
could be what someone called a demonic haunt as it will/can<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>follow a person and try to tire someone out
maybe this is why it hasn&#8217;t shown so much anymore as it is realizing I
am a bit
stronger than I was before as well as I was told since I was a novice
at witch
craft and was practicing it for the first time this could have caused
it to
think it could get a hold of me hence why it started all the things it
did. I
have since that time never tried witch craft again but I am still open
to all
religions and never set to one. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I
can
tell when there is a spirit of my nephew and when something else comes
in. My
nephew I feel no fear come over me, I still get anxieties as I had
dealt with
the other, so when my nephew thought it funny to try and take my
blankets off I
asked him to stop as he was scaring me a bit. He stopped and set at the
foot of
my bed. I explained to him that I love him but please don&#8217;t scare your
aunty. I
am glad that what I have been learning is that it wasn&#8217;t able to get as
aggressive as I heard that it could get and that I am glad that it
never really
or I don&#8217;t think it entered the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Except the time in the second house. The third place me moved
into was a
trailer park and we/ I didn&#8217;t live there for too long before I left for
the
military. I hope maybe it has been slowly getting tired of me. My
parents have
been oblivious to it all which has always made me feel like I was going
crazy.
I should say in my time in N.H I had used a Ouija board but for fun
never
really used it as it was to be used as we screwed around messing with
it as we
were kids not really thinking it could really be used in that way at
the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am writing everything f=down
to hopefully
figure this out and maybe add more to the puzzle that seems to be
getting
clearer. I want to say thank you to all that contacted me the last time
I
posted great help.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nothing listed on
the
"Retlaw Theater" Fond du Lac, Wisconsin posting is true.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First, Bravo Theater and Fusion opened at the
same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, I was in charge of
the Bravo Theater (look me up).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I opened
it in the late afternoon and locked it for the night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Many nights I was there until
10:00pm-midnight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was physically there
in the theater directing musicals and preparing the stage, cleaning the
dressing rooms, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am sensitive to
paranormal activity (and work for a paranormal investigation team) and
in the
theater there were no footsteps, clapping, chairs creaking or stage
doors left
open...I know because I opened and closed the building and checked it
daily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The owner made up a story that
there was a
ghost there named "Walter" to scare the kids, but never (for years)
did myself or my staff witness any activity even though we would have
liked
to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have never in the years that I was
there heard any of these rumors, or heard any of my staff talking about
it, so
I don't know who would post something like that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
currently have no attachment to the
building, but it bothers me to see non-factual statements.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I would remove the posting, because it's not
true...If it were true, I'd be the first to give you better insight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Something Evil
Inside the
Attic <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>pecky1404@gmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">To start of I was
never a
believer of ghost stories until it happened to me... I live with my
mother and
older brother and one nigh my mother was away in a trip so I decided to
sleep
in her room since her bed is very comfortable anyhow it was around
2:00am and I
was reading a book when I started to hear steps coming from the attic
which is
above my moms room . That alone was not scary but then I heard bags
being moved
around ( my mom has plenty of stuff inside bags in that<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">attic) in my head I
thought
it might be an animal so I continued with my read after a few minutes
heard
knocks small at first but they grew louder to the point it seemed
someone was
really trying to get my attention so I started to pray and asked to be
left
alone and it seemed my wishes had come true for a minute there but then
I heard
a laughter and words in another language<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>at that instant I was scared out of my mind and called my
brother from
my cellphone even though he was inside his room in that same house . He
said it
had been him making those noises but he was still trying to calm me
down when
the attic door started to move up and down like there was someone
trying to get
out<span style="">&nbsp; </span>at that moment my brother and I
looked at each other and made a run for his room after that I had the
house
blessed and everything stopped until recently my step sister moved in
with us
and she all of a sudden suffers from " seizures" that throw her into
walls , she burned herself once and my mom still doesn't believe
there's
something evil inside the house<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The little town of
Viola in
SW Wisconsin has some strange things happening there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For one thing, their population hovers around
666 people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They use to have that on the
sign as you entered town, but people use to crash their cars near the
sign.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now the sign reads 667. <span

apartment B above the Henthorn Memorial Center (funeral parlor) in
Viola.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All was peaceful there at first but
after the
only funeral service while I lived in that apartment, things were never
the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The funeral was sometime in late
October / early November.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was alerted
there would be a funeral in the building, so I left for the weekend.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My apartment windows sealed up tight.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>When I returned Sunday evening, I found at
least a dozen dead flies on the kitchen window sill.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>None anywhere else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the
beginning of bizarre activity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first I
started thinking I heard footsteps
in the living room at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started
leaving the living room light on all night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The apartment had no stove so I had a toaster oven and a
microwave.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One evening I cooked a
pizza in the toaster
oven, then sat and ate my pizza at my computer desk in the front
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've always been very<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>careful to turn toasters and heating
appliances off when not in use.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I
ate my pizza I heard what sounded like glass drinking glasses clinking
together
in the kitchen sink, but the only drinking glasses in the apartment
were plastic.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I went to the kitchen
to investigate the
noise, thinking maybe a mouse was running around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
mouse, but I found the toaster oven was
turned back ON. My apartment had electric heat with a dial in every
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never had electric heat before and
because
I was afraid of fire, I never left it on when I wasn't home.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>One day I came home from work to find my
bedroom was warm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was certain I'd
turned the heat off before leaving for work, but it was turned ON.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I contemplated turning it off but because the
sun was going down I knew it would be getting cold in the apt soon so I
left
the heat ON, but later that night when I went to bed, I found the room
ice cold
and the heat turned OFF.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
time I
left for the weekend and double checked to make certain everything was
OFF when
I left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I returned home to find my
bedroom heat was turned ON and the room toasty warm.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Once I woke up in the middle of the
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My eyes were closed but I was
fully conscious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard an audible
voice with a Minnesota type accent say "Hello there!".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I laid very still and thought to myself
"I'm not going to acknowledge hearing that."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
use to listen to Christian broadcasting on
the radio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night I was listening and
the radio reception was clear as a bell.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then Charles Stanley's "In Touch" ministry came on the radio
and his topic was Demons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The radio
reception grew increasing static and remained that way until his
program
ended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once that show was over, the
static left and the radio returned to normal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I kept my winter coat on the back of the desk chair in the front
bedroom
where it stayed for 3 weeks because the weather was still warm that
fall and I
hadn't needed it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was leaving town for
Thanksgiving weekend and forgot my coat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I went back to get my coat, it had been moved to the back
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I only went back to that
apartment once
after that....the day I moved out!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
I rented the apartment, the landlord told me that the apartment had
been vacant
for a year, she said the previous tenant had disappeared and never came
back
for his belongings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now I understand
why!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The groundskeeper of the funeral
home told me the assistant funeral director had lived in the apartment
at the
back of the building, but he moved out because things in his apartment
kept
moving from where he'd left them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My first
thought was "It has to take A LOT to frighten a FUNERAL DIRECTOR!"<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>PS.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The groundskeeper also told me that during singing practice
she's seen
the ghost of a little girl at the Viola Methodist Church.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hi, Shadowlands
readers, I'm
contractually obligated to send you this story, which regards Saint
Anthony of
Padua, the patron saint of lost items.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've
got to preface this by saying my credibility is very, very high. I
spent many
years as a newspaper reporter, then college professor, now mom of four
and
minister's wife. I've never tried illegal substances--not even a
cigarette--though I'll have a glass of wine now and then. As you'll
see,
though, that's not a factor in the occurrences I'm about to describe.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>This morning, I saw my husband and kids off
to work and school and was rushing around, getting ready for my own PTA
meeting. The house was empty except for me. The night before, I'd
loaded my
purse with everything I needed for the day and placed it in the
driver's side
seat of my car (where I can't possibly miss it!). So I'm running
around,
running *late*, and finally I open the door of my car--and my purse was
missing! My kids had strewn the contents of my purse around the car to
find
snacks and candy, and my driver's license and credit cards were *gone*.
I
absolutely needed them to buy groceries and for errands. I threw the
purse in
the *passenger's seat*, for sure, and made sure I hadn't thrown the
cards/license in the driver's side seat anyway-- it was completely
empty. I'm
sure. I ran around the house to find the cards and license, ransacked
the car,
my purse, everywhere. Nothing. In exasperation, I muttered, "Saint
Anthony, if you help me find my license and credit cards, I'll tell
more people
about you."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd run out of places
to search, so I returned to the car, figuring if the license and credit
cards
didn't turn up, there was nothing I could do. I opened the driver's
side
door--and there were my license and credit cards, neatly and squarely
placed on
the seat. It wasn't a creepy experience, just matter-of-fact, Saint
Anthony's
way of saying, "I'm here."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
here I am, writing this, interested that more people don't submit
stories about
saints to The Shadowlands. Whenever I talk shop with priests, if the
subject of
Saint Anthony comes up, I'm pleasantly surprised how many laugh
knowingly and
have their own stories about how active, helpful, and odd to say,
sociable he
is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was eight or nine, I remember
lying in bed and praying. I reached over to grab a pillow-- and brushed
the
coarse folds of a hanging fabric. My eyes flew open--my hand had been
feet from
any fabric, certainly none that was coarse. But I *had* been praying to
Saint
Anthony, who is always depicted wearing a monk's robe. Back to the
issue of
credibility--I could've been sleeping, right?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sure. But a couple days later, I was in church at Communion,
kneeling,
waiting for the priest to come my way. I shut my eyes to get some
prayers
in--and the same loose, coarse garment scraped my hands! I opened my
eyes, and
there was absolutely freaking nothing that could've created that
sensation
nearby. The priest was yards and yards away, and his robes were a
smooth and
fine fabric.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd be interested to hear
if other Shadowlands contributors have had saint experiences. Saint
Anthony is
an entity that people usually report feels very *there*, like a
flesh-and-blood
human, and I've always been very grateful for his help and
companionship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
