<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By:Anonymous<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<span style="font-size: 16pt;">A lady mentioned earlier that
her husband had experienced paranormal experiences at a hotel in Maryland that
I stayed in 30 years ago during a blizzard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was driving from Westchester County NY back to my college campus in
Towson, MD when I started getting disoriented in a terrible snowstorm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stayed at the Hampton and if it is the same
one she is talking about I am curious to know if some sort of &#8220;energy
signature&#8221; could be left behind by someone who is still living.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like me.<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">It was a terrible trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before I left New York I had gotten stranded
at a bus stop after my car ran out of gas in a previous snowstorm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the traffic stopped:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>cars, buses, trains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I actually got picked up about midnight by a
lone Checker Cab driver who just happened to be out looking to do a good
deed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would have literally frozen
death if not for him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I thought the weather was
clear when I left for Maryland; it was mid-January and as I said another bad
snowstorm forced me to get off the highway because I couldn&#8217;t see where I was
going.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stayed in Room 417 and kept
having nightmares of going off the road, getting turned around, getting lost,
the car breaking down and getting stranded, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thrashed all night long, waking up in a
cold sweat with my heart pounding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had
knocked everything off the bedside table, including a glass of water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had thrashed all the covers off me several
times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Early in the morning all the
howling winds had stopped and I left long before checkout time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Is there a possibility I
could have left something behind me as a result of that bad trip?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some sort of &#8220;presence?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in my 20s back then and I&#8217;m in my
mid-50s now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;ve always been
spiritually sensitive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">will never forget the summer
of 1956 just southwest of jarbalo, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">kansas</st1:place></st1:State>
while living in an old farmhouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as
usual, a hot summer night, sweating like a thief under interrogation from the
humidity and listening to my sister in the other bedroom suffering from an
asthma attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>well, mom stayed in the
room there and things calmed down but i always had heard varying noises both
inside and outside the home at night and always had the feeling of someone
being just around the corner of the next room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>there was total silence when sis went back to sleep then; i began to
hear footsteps, i counted 12 to the landing, two more up from the landing and 6
down to my room and this was not simply the squeaking of an old farmhouse and i
was terrified, i let out a scream, ran to the light switch, flipped it on and
absolutely no one was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my sister
used to also make regular treks downstairs in her sleep, mom would find her in
the kitchen, crying and then she would return her to bed and she had no
knowledge of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>very strange old home
on a hill with a beautiful view, overlooking a beautiful valley but i have no
doubt there was a demon inhabiting the home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>this was formerly known as the Enoch home, later the shoemaker home,
shoemakers later being local auctioneers in tonganoxie, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">kansas</st1:place></st1:State>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>had a scary old cellar off the old kitchen which scared all of us to
death and we kept nothing down there at all. to this very day i still wonder
about that situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i was able to
count each and every step and the location as well but nothing and nothing such
as that ever occurred again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">previous to this i had heard
unsual screams on a couple of occasions outside my upstairs window which
terrified me but these stopped also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
demons are still doing their dirty work around the entire earth and hopefully,
soon, jehovah will put a stop to all the badness they cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Hi my name is Donna, and I
would like to tell you my story about a ghost hunt we had just last week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A friend of mine asked it I had ever been to
dogsloughter in Corbin and I stated that I had not, so we dicided to go and
have a look, my friend knew that I,m a sensitive as are my two aunts that live
in In. So we went there and they said that they have gone there meny times and
every time they have heard things, so this time I went with them and what
happened was something that scared them a lot, we got to the trail that leads
into the woods, I,m not sure where it gose, but we crossed a little bridge and
that was as far as the others would go so I stopped on the other side of the
bridge, that is when I heard footsteps in the woods and asked the others to
please quite down and they did, just as I was talking to the footsteps I took a
picture and when I got back in the car there was an orbe in the middle of the
path just right where I was talking to the footsteps, my daughter took a pic,
right at the start of the trail and there is a lot of mist in the pic were as
all these pic were talken one before we heard anything and one after and the
only pic to catch anything was the one in the middle. So if you every wont to
see anything try going there at night, but let me worne you take a good
flashlight becouse the battiers may not last long. If you would like to see my
pics let me know, I would be glad to show them to you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Hi. I live in Puerto Rico and
I remember two experiences that I've had when younger. I'm 17 now and the first
one happened when I was 14. I was in el Morro, the old fort in the capital of
the island with my cousins at night. The old national cementery is right next
to it and you have a clear view of it from one of the guard posts. I had just
come out of the post and decided to look down at the cementery. I then saw what
looked like a man dressed in traditional jibarito clothes sitting at the steps
of one of the mausoleums with what looked like a lit torch. I turned around to
tell my cousins about it, but when I looked down again, the man was gone. I
looked around to see if I saw him wlak away but I didn't. And on the ground in
front of the mausoleum I could tell that there was an object that looked like an
extinguished torch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The other one happened in my home a year
later. I was sitting on the floor of my bedroom with my back against the wall,
facing my younger sister who was sitting on the bed. It was daytime but we had
the room in darkness to see some glow in the dark items. I suddenly looked at
the corner of my closet and I saw a black mass coming straight at me. I quickly
got terrified because I felt threatened and I started kicking at the air and
screaming cuss words at it for it to get away. At the same moment my sister
felt someone come behind her and grab her shoulders. She says she felt at first
calm, then got a sensation to cry. She quickly turned on the light and the
feeling was gone. Afterward our mother did a prayer and hung a crucifix in our room.
Since then I had not felt anything. I've had other experiences like seeing what
I've assumed is my mom's guardian angel, sitting on the sofa next to the main
door when she's been in the hospital waiting for her.It's also been proven
because years before I was born, another woman who worked with my mom told her
that there was a young boy with her, and she saw like a young boy run into her
room; the boy was described as the way I saw him: blond, light skinned, and
wearing old spanish clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've also
felt the presence of a young indian girl with a white dress, who I think is my
angel. My sister has also felt the presence of a young spanish girl, wearing
the same dress as mine, but with a black ribbon around her waist. There was
also the presence of a spanish soldier, who I had also seen the reflection of
on themicrowave door. I double looked and I didn't see him again. But ever
since mom put the crucifix everything is calm and we haven't felt any presences
or seen anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I was doing some messing
around on your website when I came across the information on the haunting at
West hall on the UND campus in Grand Forks North Dakota.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This caught my attention, because ten years
ago my former suite mates and myself had a very strange experience in this
dorm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I was a resident of West hall
during the 1999-2000 school year, where I lived with five other guys in <st1:address w:st="on"><st1:Street w:st="on">suite</st1:Street> 212</st1:address>, myself
and one other living in room 212B.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now
212 is the closest suite to the east entrance to West hall from the Wilkerson
parking lot, just inside the door, up the stairs and directly on the left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An important aspect of my story is the layout
of West hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dorm is set up with
each level and each wing having a centralized Commons area surrounded by
suites.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each suite has a front door much
like an apartment that separates the suite from the common area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each suite then has to double rooms and one on
each wing has a single room, which typically houses the floors R.A..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our suite had two doubles and a single,
though we did not have an RA living in our unit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now most of the time we leave our bedroom
doors open, only shutting them when we went to bed, or when no one was in our
rooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now 212b the room I lived in was
farthest from the suits front door to the common area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to get to our room you need to walk
in the front door, pass by 212a and 212c.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The resident of 212c kept to himself and was not social with the rest of
us, but Eric and myself (yes, and Erik, and Eric living in the same room...go
figure)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but Ryan and Nate in 212a where
ALWAYS there, and ALWAYS had their door open.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Now its been so long I don't
remember the exact day that this occurred on, but I know it was early second
semester, I am guessing mid February.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was about 5:30am and I remember Eric had just shut off his laptop at his desk
and climbed into his loft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The room was
quiet for just a few minutes when we hear a loud pounding on our dorm room door
with a voice shouting "let me in" repeatedly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't remember what I said in response, but
I know I was thinking that it was a friend of ours named Jackie who has been
known to be a bit annoying after a night of partying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the knocking and yelling had not
stopped for three seconds when our phone rang.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was our suite mate Ryan, Ryan had been drinking in his room with his
roommate Nate, with their door open when all this occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eric answered the phone and immediately hung
up and jumped down from his loft, flinging open the door to the dorm room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We met out in the suite and Ryan and Nate
explained to us that a girl had just appeared seemingly our of nowhere and
started pounding on our door wanting in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At this point the four of us left the suite and went into the Commons
area looking for this girl that Ryan and Nate did not see come in or
leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the west end of the commons
area there was a group of guys playing card at a table and on the right was the
heavy steel door that lead to the staircase that led to the east entrance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The door that is at the end of the Commons
area that leads to the staircase is very heavy, and can be heard opening and
closing without any sort of problem, in our suite(as it was closest to the
door) and throughout the Commons area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The guys that where in the Commons did not see anyone walk past them and
definitely did not hear anyone go through the door leading the the
stairwell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that point we all thought
it was strange, but just chalked it up to that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">It was not till a year or two
after I lived in West hall that I learned about the girls Death and the
subsequent haunting of the tunnel and dorm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now I am not convinced that what we experienced was this same
phenomenon, but It would be virtually impossible for someone to open the front
door to our suite in full view of Ryan and Nate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then walk in and walk by Ryan and Nate's room
to get to ours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This person again would
have to walk by Ryan and Nate's room, walk out into the Commons area and either
exit by walking by the guys playing cards, or though the loudest door known to
man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">To my knowledge the
experiences have all taken place in the tunnel that links the Wilkerson
complex, but what we experienced that night was at the very least strange.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Take from it what you will but the proximity
to the location where this girl supposedly froze to death (much closer than the
tunnels to the location) and the fact that there where numerous witnesses, and
two who would have surly seen someone coming or going out of our suite, all
that really makes this hard for me to explain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I've been wanting to send my
story in for several years now and finally getting around to doing it. I have
been sensitive to spirits as long as I can remember, however I haven't really
cultivated it, because emotionally it can be draining.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">The most recent experience
went on for 6 years. My mother and I are both from Chicago, however in 2000 she
deiced to buy a place in Southern Illinois and move down there. She moved to a
town called Golconda located in the National Shawnee Forest. She bought a
commercial building that was built in 1894 and was located on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Main street</st1:address></st1:Street>. The
building had been many things, hardware store, supermarket and when she bought
it, it was a art gallery up front, with a second story and had a one bed and
bath apartment in the back. The first time my mom took me there, I didn't feel
anything in the front, but felt something in the apartment in the back and
upstairs. We went upstairs and there was a bathroom and shower up there and
just a few pieces of small furniture. I walked around and I got a picture of a woman
in my head, dressed maybe from the 30's or 40's with red hair. I said to my mom
"there is a woman up here and she wants to know what we're doing up
here?" "Can't you feel her presents?" I asked my mom. She said
she couldn't feel anything. Well as I was explaining what I was feeling, there
was a big picture that was leaning against a counter (one of those pictures
that have a persons body and the face in cut out, so a person can put their
face in there and take a picture) and the thing slid halfway down the counter.
Startled us and we left.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My mom moved in and opened up
a gift shop up front, had antiques upstairs and lived in the apartment in the
back. After a month my mom started telling me that the stereo in front had a
bad habit of turning on in the middle of the night. She put new cabinets in
behind the counter in the shop and she would find them opened when they had
been closed before, and she would hear furniture move upstairs while the shop
was open.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">In 2003 I moved down to
southern Illinois, thinking I would be there for a year (so far its been 6) and
my mom ended up moving upstairs and opening the back apartment as part of the
gift shop. My mom and I lived upstairs and it was basically like a huge studio
apartment, needless to say it was pretty cramped. I remember my mom's friend
came over and they wanted to go to lunch, so she closed the shop for an hour
and I decided to take a nap. I heard all this noise, as if my mom and her
friend decided to move a few things in the shop before they went to lunch. I
thought "what the hell are they doing down there, I thought they were
going to lunch?" Later I asked my mom if they were moving things around
and she she said "no", they had left right away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Weird. I night I would feel
if as if something was laying on my legs or some sort of pressure on my legs. I
thought it was my cat, only to find out she was across the room from me. Not
only did the stereo have a life of its own but the computer in the back of the
shop would turn on by itself. We thought customers were turning it on. Why
would they do such a thing, how rude! Only to come back from being gone all day
and it was running.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Later I ended up opening a
cafe down stairs and my mom and I put in walls, a industrial kitchen, major
changes in the place. Things started to get a little more interesting. We did
fined out who was haunting the us down stairs. It was a guy named Joe, he was
shot in the back room in the 1940's. Apparently when the place was a hardware
store, Joe's uncle owned the place and he was working there. I was told Joe
wasn't the sharpest tool in the shack, lived with his mother and was ransacking
places all over town and stowing it away in his mother's garage. His uncle
started noticing things missing and but there was no breaking and entering. He
decided to stay late and wait to find out what was going on. Joe was coming
thru the skylight in the back and leaving thru the back door. While he was yet
doing another break in, his uncle shot him on the spot not knowing who he was.
Joe died right there on the floor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Strange things started to
happen when I opened my cafe in Sept. 2004.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">The first thing that happened
was one of the most bizarre things ever.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I will have to explain the
layout of the cafe. The front was known smoking and the middle room was a wine
room, were we had bottled wine and gourmet foods and the back was part of the
kitchen and the other half was the smoking dining room. In the middle room to
the left was the door way to the kitchen, from the doorway was a small hallway
and to the right was the opening to the kitchen. Across from the kitchen
doorway was the door way to our special little 2 seater dinning room called the
"Bella Room". Beyond that was the smoking area. I had bought a dry
eraser board that was a calender, one that had stickies on the back and you can
place it on the wall and its supposed to stick (it didn't). I placed it in the
hallway leading to the kitchen. This thing was alway falling, it drove me nuts!
One morning I woke up and went down stairs to the cafe to make coffee and start
prepping to open. I walk to the kitchen and in front of the door way the dry
eraser board is laying face up stuck to the floor. The night before it was on
the wall 6 feet away. It would normally fall straight down right below were it was
hanging and fall face down. How did get from 6 feet away and stuck to the
floor? My mom later told me she had heard some noises that night, but didn't
think anything of it. Small things would happen, orbs were always showing up in
our photos taken upstairs and downstairs, huge orbs at that!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">When I hired my servers, the
night before we opened my mom and I was doing some last minute training. My mom
was with our servers rolling silverware and telling them about Joe, when the
stereo, which was located in a storage closet, started to play one of the CDS.
They thought I went in there to turn it on, when I came out from the kitchen.
They asked me if I had turned it on and I told them I had been in the kitchen
the whole time. I think Joe like playing jokes on both my servers. One night
one of the servers, Blake blew out the candles lit on the tables in the back, 5
minutes later they were all lit again as if he had never blown them out. On
another night Tina my other server was working and closing up. All our customers
had been up front in the non-smoking area, the only people that had been back
in the smoking area was Tina, two customers looking back there and I. I was
showing these two people the back and then they left and I went to clean the
kitchen. On all the tables I had olive oil and parmesan cheese for dipping
french bread, so each night they had to be taken off the table and put away.
Tina asked me to come and look at something. On one of the tables in the back
one of the parmesan shakers had been unscrewed, cheese had been poured over the
table and the shaker was placed right next to it. Tina swore she hadn't done
it, she said she had been in the front the whole time. Many times I would see
shadows in the corner of my eye, feelings of being watched while I was alone in
the kitchen, sometimes I felt my hair being gently pulled, and one time I saw
two blue orbs flash before my eyes in the dark. Several other people have told
me they've seen shadows, as well as my husband when we first started dating.
Joe was very much a prankster and as time went on he became less active,
although it seemed that there was more activity during the fall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I have other stories but not
so much of a big deal. When I was little we lived on 57th and <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Archer Ave</st1:address></st1:Street> in <st1:City w:st="on">Chicago</st1:City>, a couple of blocks away from <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Resurrection</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cemetery</st1:PlaceType>,
being from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City><span style="">&nbsp; </span>every one knows about<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Resurrection Mary. My mom had
to drive past the cemetery everyday and<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I would drop down to the
floor of the car and ask "Did you see her mom? Did you see her!?"
She'd say no, you can get up now. It was kind of a joke.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Later, we lived in a suburb
of Chicago, a town called Villa Park. The library was known for being haunted.
I heard<span style="">&nbsp; </span>there was a catholic church on
the lot were the library was built. I always felt as if I was being followed
while looking at books. A very distinct feeling. I had a paper due in class and
needed to type it out. This was a time where not everyone owned a computer, the
college was closed so I couldn't go there, so the next choice was the library. They
had a very small room were they had 2 type writers. I was the only person in
this room, with the door closed, and all I could think about was this feeling
of someone behind watching me type. I kept looking behind me to make sure no
one was there. It was actually more irritating then scary. I finally finished
the paper and got out of there! I know it was long but thanks for reading!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I am 49 yrs old and have had
paranormal experiences my entire life. When I was very little my grama told me
it was just my imagination and there were no such things as ghosts. For many
years I tried to explain things away but have finally accepted them for what
they are.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was 9 my parents moved
to a new house which was about 70 - 80 yrs old at that time. Many freaky things
happened in that house and to this day my brother, sister and I all refuse to
be in that house alone as we believe it to be haunted. Here is just one of my
experiences: <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">When I was 17 the rest of the
family went to my Gramas in WV. I stayed home because I had to work. I was
standing at the kitchen sink washing some dishes and heard shoes falling down
the wooden steps going upstairs. (We normally put our shoes on the side of the
stairs). I figured the cat was running up and down the stairs playing as I knew
I had not let him out and we had no doggie door. I put the shoes back, called
"kitty, kitty", but he did not appear. Went back to the sink and
again the shoes came tumbling down the stairs. I went back to the stairs, put
the shoes back, called for the cat who did not come, then went back to the
sink. When I got to the sink and looked out the window, the hair stood up on
the back of my neck. There went my cat, running across the yard. I slowly
turned around thinking someone was in the house besides me. I searched the
entire house only to discover I was alone but it sure did not feel like
it!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will send more of my experiences
later, thanks for letting me share.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I'm just a young girl in high school who
believes strongly in the paranormal and spiritual experiences. I feel that
spirits are around us, even I have had my fair share of experiences. The most
recent one, which frightens me is of a young girl. I merely had to record a
video for an english project, and a friend of mine told me the location of this
old building that would be perfect. He said it was haunted, and I doubted this
since he does like to joke around at times. But, ever since he told me, I've
had dreams of walking on a dirt road with a young girl following me and causing
me pain. Not only that, the day we went to make the video was unbelieveably
real and exact as my dream. I had 3 friends with me when it happened but there
was a red room in the building. We didn't go to the upstairs like 2 of my
friends had previously done but there was a red, almost blood colored room. I
would've investigated to see what was up with it but I felt as if I was under
the spirits grip. She wouldn't leave me alone, as if she was trying to possess
me or at least cause me pain. When we were leaving, I saw the same little girl
from my dream in the windows. She watched as I was walking off and after a few
minutes of walking, I turned to find her following me. I haven't slept so
easily since for she likes to pop in all of my dreams, even if it doesn't
involve the house or dirt road. I'm unsure if this could be classified as
paranormal but to me, it was an experience of the after-life trying to communicate
with us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By: FFergholhou@aol.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">The story is somewhat lengthy
so I&#8217;ll shorten it a bit. If it strikes your interest, you can contact me for
more detail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Many years ago, when I was a
small boy, I had a most unusual experience<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>which makes me ask is there such a thing as ghosts?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was born at 2309 Summit and in 1948 my
family and I moved two doors down to 2317 Summit. The two story, five bed
room<span style="">&nbsp; </span>home had been built around 1914.
There was a full walk-up attic on the third story. Many times I played up in
the attic when the weather didn&#8217;t allow me to go out. Now that I think about
it, the attic was a dark old place. It was a fully floored attic. There was one
window that had metal blinds that were rusted<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>with time only partly opened. There was a single naked light bulb strung
from the ceiling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Nothing appeared to be
unusual at the time we moved there. There was a large attic fan that was used
to cool the house in the summer. Nothing foreboding, just a dark place to place
for a little boy to play on rainy days. Oh yes, there were two boxes the size
of old wooden coffins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We put our winter
blankets and stuff there. The<span style="">&nbsp; </span>other one?
Well, I never found out. It was nailed shut. Dad said he thought that many
years ago the house either used it as a vent or there was pipe organ in the
house. Neither explanation satisfied my curiosity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">It wasn&#8217;t until the mid 1950s
that something unusual occurred. It began late one night when I was in bed that
I heard something or someone walk across the floor in the attic. The next
morning I told my dad. He advised that since large oak trees grew close to the
house, it could possibly be a squirrel that climbed into the attic. I reasoned
in my mind that &#8220;squirrels make a jump, jump sound or maybe a scratch, scratch
sound&#8221; not a walking sound like a human. A few nights later I heard it again. I
again told my dad. He set a trap - the result? Nothing was caught. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I began to have repeating
dreams. In the dreams I would wake from my sleep and go up into the attic.
There I met an ex-Confederate soldier. He was friendly and we would sit on one
of the boxes and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>visit. These dreams
continued for a number of nights. Then one night as the dream was ending, the
old<span style="">&nbsp; </span>soldier said; &#8220; Well, it&#8217;s time for
you to go back to sleep. I won&#8217;t be seeing you again<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for a long time. Be a good boy.&#8221; I said, &#8220;So
long.&#8221; Then I walked to the stairs. At that moment I woke up. When I woke I was
standing in the door way of the attic, with my back to the door and the attic
door<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was open and I held the door knob
in my hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that incident, the
dreams stopped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">To this day, I don&#8217;t know if
I was dreaming, sleeping walking,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>or was
it real?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

is no longer there when i visited family here a few years ago there was only 1
field at that location but now there is a walgreens drug store there i've been
in it but have not heard anything or heard of anyone hearing anything even tho
i didn't ask.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Also in <st1:City w:st="on">Caldwell</st1:City>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By: ketchristmas@hotmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Since about the age of 6, I've been very
sensitive to the supernatural. This started with visions of my aunt's early
20th century home in ballard, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Washington-</st1:place></st1:State>
then progressed to actual sightings in a cemetery near my Port Orchard home.
This is the cemetery where several family plots dating from the early 19th
century are located, and I'm sure I've seen at least one figure dressed not of
this time in this cemetery, and I'm sure it's no teenagers playing jokes on us.
Although it's yet to be proven, I also think that there is something not of
this world inhabiting a riverfront home that I visited during the summer, which
belongs to a close family friend. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">It is liekt he others on the
road near the beach in Ocean Shores, washington- secluded by trees and water, a
small boat dock out in front, next to a river. The floor plan includes stairs,
which leave the livingroom and go up to a small loft (Where the other younger
children and I stayed for the time we were there) which looks over the living
room and some large windows looking out at the river.The kitchens and other
bathrooms and bedrooms are on the ther side of the house, not visible by
looking over the edge of the loft, which had no windows, walls or doors seperating
it froom the rest of the house, except for a small wall to keep people from
falling over the edge of the loft.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Anyway, the house is about 30
years old or so, and I'm not sure if anyone owned the house before her family
did. But since we knew nothing about the history of the house, there is one
thing I'm sure of- there has been many boat crashes along the river since the
beginning of socioty's reign in this area. Most have not been fatal, though I'm
sure a few were- tthe river is quite deep, and I'm sure at least 2 or 3 people
must have drowned. But back to the story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">It was about 12:30 pm, and
most everyone was asleep. I had stayed up to finish reading, so I sat up in the
loft along with the kids. I was just getting ready to go to bed ( I was exsausted
from a day of shopping and boating, ironically) when I heard a puttering, like
a motorboat engine. I sat in silence for a moment, cursing the fact that I
didn't bring earplugs to block out the noise of the boat, which was becoming
louder, as thiugh the boat was coming closer to our dock. I was surprised to
find that I could hear muted bits of coversation, though none of it I remember.
I'm sure of this next part, though- as I snuggled into my sleeping bag to try
and sleep, I was overcome with a terrible sadness- a horrible feeling of
hoplessness. I heard a sickening crashing noise, something falling into the
water- then silence. The puttering noise of the boat was gone in an instant,
and so was the feeling of sadness. I walked slowly to the edge of the loft, to
look out at the lake, in case anyone was out there who might've needed help.
But I was confused and slightly worried when I looked at the dock and saw
nothing- no boat or person. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">The water near the dock is
filled with mud and about 3 ft. deep- nothing someone could get their boat out
of within 3 miutes or so, and certainly not enough to drown in. But I'm sure
that during some time in history there was enough to drown a person in. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">The next morning, I walked to
the breakfast table and asked anyone if they had seen or heard anything last
night. Everyone said that they did not, and though no one else had seen it, I
know that i was neither asleep or imangining it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">If anyone can help me with
this, figuring out who or what was at the house that night, please contact me
ASAP.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I have been looking around
your site for nearly 2 years now. Im 14 and i have moved from 4 houses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">We moved into a house in
Blaxland, Australia. According to our no-life neighbours, a couple had lived
here before us. Now the mans fiance had breast cancer and in hopes of fighting
it, she lost and died at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Nepean</st1:place></st1:City>
hospital (date unknown). They had been living here for over around 5 years. The
widow sold and moved away. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Our lease of the house is
nearly over and I am totally miffed about some of the happenings my family,
friends and I have encountered. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">The first encounter was about
1 month into our lease. I was looking after my 2 sisters. My folks had gone out
to a party and where due back in half an hour. I went to bed at around 12 after
watching Predator on 7. As I was dozing off, the screen door outside slid open
and as did the sliding door. I knew it was my Parents. So i got up to say Hi.
To my shock, there was no one there, the cats where looking menacingly outside
and my little sister was up completely oblivious to what had happened. I told
her to go back to bed. My parents came home 10 mins prior to that. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My second encounter happened
under the same circumstances apart from it was later at night. Around 3 i awoke
to my cat meowing histerically at the same sliding door. my mother got up and
let him out. i heard her curse and run back to bed. then my father came out
with my mother and i heard her say: ' he was right near the bike'. I asked my
mum about it and she said it was nothing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My third and last encounter
happened when my mate James was sleeping at my house. We were asleep around
10pm and i woke up to feel footsteps on my bed. I thought it was my cat but
alas nothing there. I thought nothing of it and went back to sleep. I awoke
later to hear James mumbling at me. He pointed out towards the shed that is
right opposite my room. There, standing over there was a ghastly image of a
woman. She was young and pretty. I only caught a glimpse when she dissolved
into nothing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">It sounds naff, but I swear
this is true.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Courthouse Clock<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By: kbrock3@gmail.com <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Hello - I wanted to submit a
very credible and true story of a haunted courthouse clock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Desha County Courthouse located in
Arkansas City, Arkansas is haunted by a man nicknamed "Willard".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the story goes, around 1900 or so a man
lost money gambling in a hotel in the city and was, supposedly, so enraged he
set fire to the hotel and other buildings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was arrested, tried, and convicted of arson and was ordered to be
hanged on the courthouse grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
declared his innocence and stated that as proof of his innocence the new
courthouse clock would NEVER keep time again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was executed and now, more than 100 years later,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>this clock still does not work properly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes it runs fast other times it runs
slow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes the long hand reads the
hour and the short hand reads the minutes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The hour chime also malfunctions regularly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes it doesn't chime at all and others
it chimes but not the correct number of times or at the correct time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night a few years ago, the hour chime
started ringing constantly and kept the town residents awake for hours until
the current judge was able to shut the clock off completely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The town has tried many times, in vain, to
fix the clock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They switched it from a
weight driven system to an electric system, the current judge has worked on the
clock personnally many times, and they recently hired a clock company in
Florida to completely clean and refurbish the clock, however, it still does not
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another interesting note is that
the tower clock is not the only clock that doesn't always work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The modern courthouse staff phone system
clocks will often either show the wrong date or the wrong time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, the courthouse itself has had reports
of slamming doors and footsteps etc.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Maybe "Willard" was innocent afterall!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">This story is so well known
and publicly witnessed that it was recently featured in our state newpaper
"The Arkansas Democrat Gazette".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the reporter and photographer were there to do the story the clock
gave them "proof".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They stood
outside the courthouse with the clock in view and were interviewing the current
judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he relayed the tale of the
clock, it chimed one loud and firm chime - it was 11:57 am - three minutes
later at 12 Noon - it was supposed to chime twelve times - it stayed silent!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I have been here and this is

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Everyone in our town seems to
try and cover up the tragic accident that occured in the 1800's on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Livingston street</st1:address></st1:Street>
at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Tewksbury</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Hospital</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.
The Hospital was originally built as a pshych ward and the Doctors who treated
the patients also lived on the street in 3 specific houses. The place was a
lock down and it tragically burnt down and nobody could get out and most if not
everyone died. They buried the people still on the same road right behind the
corn fields in the woods. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">They I'm guessing could not
identify anyone or had no clue of who was who exactly, they are buried with
chrome headstones with no names just numbers sadly there must be like 200-300
of them if not more for I've trespassed this private property to see for
myself. The Hospital has been since rebuild. No one can build on the land where
the doctors houses were located for a poltergiest supposably haunts them, I
know for sure one of the houses are for it was in the paper years back that the
Deacon at our church Deacon Bill went down to the houses to try and send the
spirit or spirits on their way but failed. The houses are boarded up and are
now State and private property with No Trespassing signs everywhere. So sad so
tragic who were these people and why No Names? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">A ghost of unknown origin
seems to enjoy playing around in my shop. While people are sitting in the back
of the shop, objects in the front of the shop get tossed around. It also enjoys
messing with the bathroom door... you can leave it open and sometimes it will
stay open, but other times, it will slam shut on you. There have been multiple
reports of someone whispering in my customers ears and of someone playing a
piano next door at the old theater (which has been closed since the early
60's). There was also a report where my business partner spent the night up
there and woke up surrounded by 4 ghostly figures who quickly disappeared
before his eyes. At night, when the customers are gone and while we&#8217;re in the
front of the store getting ready to close, you can hear footsteps and a door
slamming in the back of the building.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My name is Suzanne and I
thank you for giving me the opportunity to share my story. I have actually in
my life lived in two haunted homes and am currently working in an office that
has a spiritual presence. The second haunted home I lived in was the most
frightening. I had just turned 20 and had moved to Portland, ME with my best
friend from high school. The entity made its presence known immediately but
through a way that was easy to dismiss, at first. What happened was this: If
you were on the phone and even when you were not, and this would occur
everyday, many times a day, and at all hours of the day, you would first hear a
click, then a static like sound like when you are watching a TV channel that
you do not actually get (watching a "snowstorm").Then it would
happen. At first it started as a loud piercing ungodly scream. It was a blood
curdling scream. If you were on the phone the person on the other end could
hear it too. If you were not it would permeate the whole apartment. It always
started the same way. Once you heard the click and static you just had to brace
yourself. It was like nothing I have ever heard before or since. It would chill
you to the bone. After about a month the entity went from just screaming
through the phone to screaming the words GET OUT. The voice although unlike
anyone or thing I had ever heard before I associated as female. My roommate and
I were friendly with the neighbors across the hall and directly below us. We
asked if they had a similar problem with their phones too. They of course, said
no, but also told us that they from time to time could hear screaming and a
strange loud voice from our apartment. We contacted the phone company about it
and they told us that we must be picking up feedback from another line. We
never believed that to be accurate. After about six months we moved out. Some
time after that the building burned down. Some people have theorized that we
were being warned. I do not believe that. The feeling I would get when I would
hear the screams and "GET OUT" was that of fear the likes of which I
have never felt before. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I do not talk about this or
my interest in haunted places much with anyone. Unless someone has actually
lived through it or experience it first hand they really just don't understand.
It is not real to them. In the years since I have studied a lot of occurrence
and locations. I have seen a lot of commonalities within these occurrences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">back in 1966 in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Addison</st1:City> <st1:State w:st="on">IL</st1:State></st1:place>.
when I was 8 yrs old my two sisters Vicki 13 and Dawn 12 were walking along
Lake Street with two other girlfriends when a car full of teenage girls who had
been drinking ran off the road and hit only one of the four girls my 12 yr old
sister, the 16 yr old driver was from a prominent wealthy family and had only
been driving for 2 wks , the witnesses said the girls were passing around a
bottle of liquor on that hot August night when they saw my sisters and their
friends walking on the side of the road, the driver being the unpleasant person
she was decided to try to scare the girls and drive onto the gravel when she
struck Dawn sending her into the air and onto the hood of their car, the girls
were walking to a amusement park named Adventure Land. we moved from our
apartment and into a new house because of the bad memories and people, and
childhood friends of my sisters said that a young girl resembling my sister was
seen wandering from apartment to apartment looking for her family. Dawn was the
neighborhood babysitter and would teach the neighbor children how to cross the
road, they say they have seen her on the curb looking both ways as though she
was trying to cross. I myself would see and hear her in our new home she would
appear at the door and the foot of my bed, sometimes the front door knob would
turn and you could look out the window outside at the door and no one was
there. I would hear footsteps on the stairs and cold air rush past me in
certain rooms. I have since moved to Missouri and wonder if the home we had is
still haunted by her or if the old amusement park still stands where people
have said that they swear they saw her standing in line at the rides. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Last june my friend andy and
i went to manganese, there are many sidewalks covered in grass, where city
blocks used to be, foundations lie naked, no floors or walls, walking through
the old deserted town felt eerie, andy said there was a graveyard somewhere
where we were walking. we couldnt find a thing. just very old antipue cans and
things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">After an hour of searching we
decided to go back to the car, it was dark. andy locked his keys in the car.
thats when i heard a loud noise in the woods next to us where a foundation was,
i looked..and there where the noise came from was a glowing figure!! we both
saw it and freaked out! meanwhile he's frantically searching for something to
open his car with. then we saw conveniantly placed next to us was a heavy
guaged wire. i took a stick and wedged it in the door. the figure looked like
there was two people in one. kind of dancing up and down. it was so scary!! we
eventually got the door open and drove off as fast as we could. havent been
back since.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
