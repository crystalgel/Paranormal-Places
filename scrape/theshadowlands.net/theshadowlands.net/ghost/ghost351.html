<p class="MsoNormal">Hello, I have a story that still gives me shudders and makes
me look behind me when I walk home at night. Last summer, 2004, my bestfriend
and I were walking home from work around <st2:time hour="0" minute="30">12:30am</st2:time>.
We were walking home, which only took about 10minutes, when we got to the
beginning of my road. My road is probably the scariest road to begin with, with
only on street light at the beginning- it's a long dark dirt road which I
always regretted for walking down at night. My friend and I were right at the
beginning of my road when we both stopped dead in our tracks, and without a
word to each other- turn around and looked down the road we were just on. What
we saw that night terrified me... About 100ft away from us was what looked like
a woman, dressed in white and had long dark hair. At first I thought it was
some teenager drunk stumbling around but as we looked again, we could see that
this was no drunken teenager. It looked as though see was dancing around on the
sidewalk, but moving closer to us at the same time. Immediately I was
frightened, which is odd because I don't usually frighten easily. We both
decided to keep walking and to get home as quick as we could. By the time we
got to the lawn of my house we were calmed down- not seeing any trace of the
woman following us along the way. We went inside and got some food from the
kitchen. About 5 minutes later as we were chatting in the kitchen we heard what
sounded like someone walking up the front porch steps. I had left the porch light
on and when I poked my head out of the kitchen doorway I saw nothing. But
instantly the hair on the back of my neck was up again. All of a sudden my cat
(who is VERY lazy.. ) bolted up the stairs. I took that as a bad sign and then
ran up the stairs myself, my friend aswell. We got up to my room and my friend
got into bed and I was getting something out of her backpack when I heard
someone walk to my door (which was closed) and stop (the floor creaks right at
my door). I then took one look at my friend and walked to the door and locked
it. I climbed into bed (the lights were out now) and reached down to grab a
pair of shorts that I use to cover my alarm clock (the light bothers me) and
just as I covered the alarm clock, my bedroom door opened. Immediately
following that there was a loud bang on the window above the bed and then there
was a very detailed buzzing sound which seemed to be right between my friend
and I. I was scared out of my mind and almost started hyperventilating (nervous
reaction I guess). After about 5 minutes of laying there motionless I asked my
friend to open her eyes to see if she could see anything. She replied "
They've been open the whole time". My friend saw nothing. In the morning
the phone rang and I got out of bed to get it. The door was wide open, but the
door was still locked. Now everytime I walk home that way, I always look behind
me... more than twice...</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Weird happenings in my Home</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: msuarez@ohmite.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In 1980-81 I lived in a apt. (actually a house converted) </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my children &amp; I lived there alone. Amanda my baby was
about 4 mos. old &amp; this ghost (we all saw her) was after Amanda. You could
hear her at her crib (after the 1st time she never slept alone she slept w/me)
She jerked her from my other daughters' arms &amp; she was thrown to the floor
she almost died. I called a priest in to bless Amanda &amp; our apt. he told me
to get her baptized &amp; watch her closely cause this being was after her. We
were all praying the rosary &amp; we forgot the words to our prayers. One night
we heard noise in the attic &amp; we called the police they came &amp; went up
to see. My oldest daughters belongings were gone.Less than 2 wks later we went
upstairs to get the Christmas stuff &amp; there sat all my daughters stuff all
dusty &amp; in the same place. Than one night about 6 we were all sitting in
the kitchen when we felt a cold breeze &amp; when we looked up she was going
into the bedroom we all ran in there but, she was gone. She was sorta floating
&amp; wearing a long white dress very fancy. Well needless to say I was scared
&amp; so was my kids. I asked my 2 brother-in-laws to stay over &amp; my one
brother-in-law woke us all up screaming as he was being levitated up over the
couch, when we came running he was sorta just dropped it was so weird. They
refused to stay again. There was a very steep set of stairs that led to our
front door so we kept the inner door closed and locked so my daughter &amp; my
grandson (who she never bothered) couldn't fall down the stairs. We were all
sitting in the living room talking &amp; watching the babies in their walkers
when they began to laugh &amp; head towards the than open door we just caught
them before they got there. We finally were able to move &amp; the day we were
moving out the bathroom ceiling caved in &amp; we heard a weird undescrible noise.
I was never so happy to be gone in my life. We were fine until we bought a
house in 1998</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">&amp; Amanda was getting a bag off the back stairs when she
screamed &amp; said, later that something pushed her down the stairs injuring
her leg &amp; back. The drop was so far that I just knew she broke her neck.
Since than she has had a few falls that she says feels as tho she is being
pushed. Also we hear doors close &amp; walking upstairs when we are all
downstairs. This all probably sounds<span style="">&nbsp; </span>crazy
to you as it does when I tell others but, it's true. The 1st time we lived
behind St. Boniface Cemetery this time we live down the street from a funeral
parlor. Also a visitor to our home (her husband was doing plumbing work for us
&amp; she drove him) she &amp; I were sitting in the kitchen talking about
Thanksgiving dinner when she turned in her chair &amp; said, very comely
"did you know you have a old man &amp; woman sitting in your living
room" &amp; just about that time the door opened &amp; she said,
"they just walked out, are they your family?" Please don't think I am
nuts but................. it all happened</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi! My name is Shae and I have always been intrigued by the
supernatural and while the thought of having a ghostly experience scares me shitless,
a part of me still longs to be able to recount an encounter of my own. That
hasn&#8217;t happened yet, at least, nothing that I can say was surely a ghost, so I
will recount stories from my family.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">What is really funny, is that my father still explains away
what happened to him as tricks of the mind, but I am not so sure. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Apparently my dad and his siblings had lived in several
haunted houses, but the one that used to stand on the corner of Butternut Ridge
and <st2:Street><st2:address>Great Northern Blvd.</st2:address></st2:Street> in
<st2:place>North Olmstead</st2:place>, <st2:State><st2:place>Ohio</st2:place></st2:State>.
There still is the Butternut Ridge cemetery right behind where the house was.
(There is a nice housing complex there now. I wonder if people there have had
any experiences.)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Many years ago, when my dad was a young boy, he was home
alone on New Years&#8217; Eve in this house. Now, there was this hall closet that had
always been a source of discomfort. It was very difficult to open on a normal
basis, but my dad watched, amazed as the door started to open. He thought he
heard voices saying his name. &#8220;Jeff&#8230;Jeff&#8230;&#8221; and he felt like he was being
watched. He freaked out and ran into the kitchen, towards the back door and he
noticed that the kitchen light was swaying back and forth. He ran out of the
house and met one of his brothers (I don&#8217;t remember which) walking back with
his girlfriend. Now my uncles and my dad were tough children and this brother
he ran into (I think it was my Uncle Russell) was scared too. When they got
back home, they couldn&#8217;t close the door. They had to take the pins out of the
hinges to get it to close again. How can you explain that away?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That&#8217;s not the only story about that closet. Their mother
(My Grandma Joy) was religious, but she also had experience with the
supernatural, as she is very psychic. She decided to put a statue of the Virgin
Mary in that closet. Whatever was inside broke the statue. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I don&#8217;t know if the following stories took place in that
same house. There was one night when my uncles Leonard and Russell were trying
to go to sleep. Leonard was terrified for some reason, and despite Russell
teasing him, we went to find Joy. Joy came in and sat down on the bed and
started to pray. All three of them watched in amazement as the bed moved like
someone had gotten up. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In that same room, one night my uncle Russell was thrown out
of bed. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My dad&#8217;s sister Theresa apparently had some problems with
some of the ghosts in one of their houses. I am not able to get specific
stories out of any of them, but Uncle Leonard admitted that some &#8220;freaky stuff&#8221;
happened and that these spirits were male and they liked to touch Theresa when
she was in the bathroom. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There have also been some instances of indistinct voices
between the rooms and apparently posters dripping blood. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My uncles seem reluctant to talk about it, which makes me
believe that they are not just telling tale tales. When I am able to catch them
in a state when they talk (usually when they have been drinking) they still
manage to skate off the subject by just admitting that yeah, stuff happened. I
am determined to get more stories, but my family is such a down-to-earth
family, which makes no sense to me, because like I said, my grandmother is very
psychic and according to her, so is my dad. But Grandma Joy has given up that
life and my dad is the most down-to-earth out of all of them. But you can&#8217;t
explain away some of that stuff as mere &#8220;tricks of the mind&#8221;.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">ok well my grandpa died in my house and we have this old
grandfather clock that hadn't chimed for like 10 years and then the morning that
he died it chimed and then it stopped chiming a week after and then it didn't
start chiming again until a week before the anniversary of his death and then
it'd stop a week after. it did this for like 5 years and then one night i was
at my house and my grandma at hers and we were both in bed and we botha saw a
figure of a man standing in our doorways at around the same time and he just
put his hand up as to wave goodbye and dissappeared.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Open Door -- But No One's There</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: garnetts2000@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I grew up in a small two-story house on the northwest side
of <st2:City><st2:place>Chicago</st2:place></st2:City>. The place was built in
the 1950s; as far as I've been able to discover, there were no unexplained
events or deaths on the property or in the house. Besides, it's a very small <st2:City><st2:place>Chicago</st2:place></st2:City>
city lot -- no forests behind it, no large tracts of land, or anything like
that. The house itself is also fairly small, as houses go; it's about 1250
square feet, all told.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Throughout my family's time in this house (about 30 years),
I constantly heard odd noises. I figured most of them out after a while ... but
there was one that continues to puzzle me. Whenever I was alone -- and doing
laundry -- I would hear footsteps pacing the length of the kitchen (which is
directly above the laundry room). This would go on for about four or five
minutes, then stop. I never had a chilled feeling or a sense of an evil
presence -- but I also never saw anyone or anything.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The oddest episode happened when I was about fourteen. It
was very cold outside, and all the upstairs windows were closed and locked.
(And had plastic stapled over them.) One evening, I was working on a paper; I'd
shut my bedroom door against any intrusion. At one point, I looked up at the
door. The knob turned slowly, the door opened about three inches, then stopped
-- as though someone were holding it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I got very angry; my family knew I was convinced there was a
presence in the house, and I just knew they were trying to spook me. I leaped
up and checked every hiding spot outside that room that I could think of.
Nothing! But I ran downstairs and confronted my family, just to make sure. My
parents and sister were in the kitchen, watching TV; they insisted they hadn't
moved from that room in over an hour. My father agreed to come back upstairs
with me and check things out. I stood there while he examined the examined the
doorknob -- and we both got very nervous.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There were two dirty prints on the knob (a thumb and an
index finger), apparently from a very large hand. We did another check of every
hiding spot we could think of; there was nothing and no one upstairs but my
father and myself. Nothing else happened that night, and I never experienced
that again.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">To this day, I have no idea what happened, or what/who was
outside my door. I didn't hear any footsteps, or breathing, or anything else
... but that knob turned; I saw it, and it was not a trick of the light, or
anything else. (I had three lamps turned on in the room.) I also know the door
had been securely shut; I heard the latch click as it did. I also know there
was no one else upstairs with me. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Does anyone have any ideas of what happened, or what MIGHT
have been occuring?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have been reading the stories on this site for a while and
decided to share my encounters. Now, to kind of paint a picture for you, I live
with my family in a single story, three bed room, house that sits directly
behind a cemetery. The only thing separating my back yard and the cemetery is a
fence. We moved into the house 18 years ago after my grandparents passed away
(yes they died in the house due to natural causes). Now, the story I have to
share I cannot actually remember so I will tell you what happened according to
what my mother remembers. I was about four or five at the time, and my mother
had awoken from her sleep at about <st2:time hour="1" minute="0">1 am</st2:time>
when she heard voices coming from our kitchen, and decided to investigate. When
she walked out to the kitchen she said that I was sitting at out table talking
to someone across from me who wasn&#8217;t there. Since I had a history of
sleepwalking, (I actually woke up in out front yard once) she figured I was
dreaming and had wondered out into the kitchen. However my eyes were wide open
and was responsive to her being there, and when she asked what I was doing, I told
her that I was talking to grandma. She got a little scared and told me to get
back to bed and go to sleep. I agreed, said goodbye to my grandmother and
followed her back to my room, but she says I never made it back to bed. Instead
I turned around, walked out the front door, and headed for the back yard. She
said that by the time she made it outside I had climbed over the fence and was
walking through the cemetery toward my grand parents&#8217; grave. Of course she
freaked out, brought me back inside, and put me to bed. When I awoke in the
morning I didn&#8217;t remember a single thing.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then when I was about seven, I had another encounter. I was
awoken at around <st2:time hour="3" minute="0">3 am</st2:time> to the sound of
voices in my room. When I opened my eyes and looked around I saw a dark gure
kneeling at the foot of my bed, holding its head in its hands. I got really
scared and hid under my blanket. After the voices stopped I poked my head back
out from under the blanket, and the figure was gone, and I heard footsteps
leading out to our kitchen, then all was quiet again. Since then I have not
spoken to or seen any spirits, however I still hear footsteps throughout the
house and things moving around in the attic.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: [allisin666@hotmail.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Ive only seen things 3 times in this house which ive been
living in for 7 years, the townhouse ive lived in previous to this ive never
seen any spectres but ive heard noises and voices. I'll start with the first
house where ive expierenced supernatural behavior.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was 11 maybe 12 and i always felt like something was
constantly watching me, just got really strong bad vibes, my family and i were
constantly fighting in that house, just a lot of negative energy....<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night on my birthday, i had gotten a
balloon and i had it in my room, keep in mind that the door was closed and so
was the window so theres no way any air could have done this, but my balloon
just started spinning in circles gliding across the ceiling slowly then fast
then slow again, i dont know when it stopped or even if it did, i was scared so
i slept on the couch downstairs that night. another thing i remember is i was
in the kitchen eating and on the couch i had a few trolls that i was playing
with earlier cuz i used to collect them, well anyway i saw one moving it did
like a 180 degree turn, that scared the shit out of me. We didnt stay at that
house too long.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now we live in a bigger townhouse minutes from the other one
we resided in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This house is 8 years old
and we've lived here for 7 years, before we moved in here there was a family
here and their little infant died in my sisters room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I always feel like im being watched in that
room. So in this house ive expierenced 3 ghostly experiences. first one was
on<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a summer night my mom and i were in
the basement watching tv and we let my dogs out in the backyard and we see our
swing swinging very hard for a few minutes then it just stopped as if someone
jumped off and held the swing until it was still... The next thing that
happened was a few years later my friend was spending the night and she was
sleeping on the floor by my door and i woke up and looked to see what time it
was and above my friend was this man floating over her he didnt have legs but
had like a pale blue aura surrounding him and he was wearing a long nightgown
with a cap they were both white with blue stripes. I thought i was imagining or
just seeing things so i just rolled over on my side not realizing what just
happened, then i turned back around to see if it was still there and i saw the
back of him fading away into my door. i didnt feel scared or frightened. I
didnt tell anyone about that until the same thing happened to my mom the next
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next apperance was that same year, my fathers aunt had
died. Before i was told that she passed away i saw her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was preparing for bed and i always kept the
light in the hallway on because im paranoid and i like to sleep with lights
on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The light in the hallway went out so
i walked out into the hallway to check if the light had burned out so i kept on
switching the light on and off and it had infact burned out but as i was doing
that i saw a woman with white light surrounding her and she just starred at me,
this lasted about 2 seconds, again i was not frightened this time i had
recognized the spectre, it was my fathers aunt who had died a few days before i
saw that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That was the last thing ive seen, but i often feel like im
being watched. My boyfriend has claimed to see black orbs floating around my
living room which is where he feels he is always being watched. Weird things
happen like my boyfriend and i get almost the same dream. One night we both
dreamt we were at <st2:City><st2:place>Glendale</st2:place></st2:City>
(abandoned mental hospital), in his dream he was there with me and one other
person he couldnt tell who it was he just knew that it was a male. and he dreamt
that we were being chased by black shadows that looked like dogs. In my dream i
was there with him and my friend pj and we were just walking around, my dream
seemed harmless and not at all scary unlike my boyfriends, he woke up and was
frightened.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello, my name is Sabrina, and I want to tell you kind of a
scary experience that happened to me. I had just moved into a new apartment
with my mom and my dog, Roxy. Just as soon as I got comfortable in my bed, Roxy
jumped out and whimpered into my mom's room. When I opened my eyes, I thought I
saw a pair of shoes on the ground. From the shoes grew legs in long, black
pants, and a body in a tuxedo. I couldn't see any facial features or colors,
just black and grey. I saw a gun in his hand. And, since I"m only 10, my
only reaction was to stay still, don't breath, and close my eyes. Just before I
closed my eyes, I saw a shadowy black bullet come from the gun. Soon, as I
dared to look again, I saw nothing, so, being the scaredy cat that I am, I hid
under the covers and cried. The next day, I asked my friend, Amanda, who lived
on the same street before, If anything bad happened there. Amanda, with a sad
look on her face said, "when i was 7, my mom sent me to my grandma's
house. that night, my moms boyfriend came over and killed my mom. He wanted to
kill my brother and I, too, but we were at our grandmothers. So he killed
himself so he wouldn't have to be sent to jail. Why did you ask?" I
replied, "I think i saw the killer</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">the opposite darker corner at the end of the buffet by the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pantry had two

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were

<p class="MsoNormal">I not sure about haunted places, but I do believe in what
some people may call Ghost. I see people in my house, or maybe I should say
like a passing and get up from the chair and go see and no one is there. I have
had experience of after my Dad passed away he came back, and was standing in my
kitchen like he always did and when I called his name and walk in he just
vanished. I have seen my sister come into my bedroom with my Aunt and she sit
in a chair and my sister which passed away one year ago stood beside her. I was
a wake watching TV and did not say a word and they did not say anything. After
a few minutes they walked out of the room and was gone. I have also seen my
Mother. I know that the man I am dating which is a very sensible person was
very upset. He was watching a western on TV when he gasped for breath on asking
what was wrong he said his sister Betty that had passed away about three years
ago said she had been trying to get in touch with him, I said how did she do
that he said she was here. At this point we had her ashes in my house and took
them to be buried beside her Mother and this was about two weeks later. It seems
that these things are happening to more people lately than ever before as if
souls are coming back to earth. I do not know the answer but I do know what I
see and what others tell me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My fiance and I moved into our home in November of 2003. It
is a small, 2 bedroom house. It was built either in the 18 or 1900's, I really
don't know much about the house. I was pregnant when we moved here and we were
in a hurry to find a house and after a lot of looking we found this one that
was in our budget and would accommodate the addition to our family.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Nothing weird started until a few months ago. I have always thought
I had some kind of connection into the "spirit world", if you will.
When I lived with my parents I would hear voices, but ONLY if I listened
hard...I don't really know how else to put it. But if I would lay in my bed at
night and be perfectly still and quiet I would start to hear a lot of people
talking at first, and then a few voices would be singled out and they were
talking to me. They would say my name, or other weird things. I have not done
that in a long time.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway, back to my house. Early one morning I was waiting
for my fiance to shower and then I was going to drive him to work. He came out
of the shower with bloody scratches all over his arm. I asked him what in the
world happened and he said he didn't know. He said he didn&#8217;t even touch his
arm, but that it burned and he had not noticed until I pointed it out to him.
That was the first time I was really scared. I took our daughter and stayed at
my parents house for the rest of the day.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A month or two ago I took a shower and I was wearing my
towel as I brushed my teeth. My fiance came up behind me and asked me what
happened to my back. I looked in the mirror and I had scratches all over my
back every which way. I did not make them and I was sure for 2 reasons. 1)I
bite my fingernails down to nothing, I always have 2)In order to have made
those scratches myself I would have had to seriously strain to reach parts of
my back and I did no such thing.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It really scares me but I try not to think of it. I never go
into our basement because it just freaks me out. I hear noises down there
sometimes, but I think it's just from the house, or at least I would like to
think so. The scratches have not happened for a while, and I'm hoping it wont
happen again. If anything like that ever happened to my daughter I would want
to move out of here ASAP. We are planning on moving in 2 or 3 years to make
room for a bigger family, but I already feel very uneasy in this house,
especially at night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 1990 my mom had seen and felt the presence of a ghost.
She was laying in her bed upstairs in the Cottage house, (at the time before we
moved in it), and a ghost lady came out of the closet, and put her hand on my
moms hand, and my mom can feel what she was saying. The ghost said, "Your
safe here with me." In 1999 we moved into the Cottage house. I sometimes
hear talking at night as I lay in bed. My mom and my brother heard music in the
closet in my moms room where the ghost came out of during the middle of the
night. It was soft, instrumental music.</p>

FOUND BABY CLOTHES THAT SEEM TO BE FROM THE 1900'S BABY COVERED IN VERY DRIED

CHILD THERE HAS BEEN ONE APARITION THAT HAS ALWAYS ATTAINED MY ATTENTION. HE OR
SHE HAS KNOCKED ON DOORS AND NOT STOPPED TILL DOOR WAS OPENED. NOW THAT I LIVE

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i just wrote you about my boyfriends ghost, now i am going
to tell you about my ghost. well, the ones i grew up with.i was raised WAY out
in the boonies. our house was built by my grandfather(which raised me) in the
pasture of the previous land owners. the spot where thier house sat (when it
was erect) is the corner of our front pasture. all that is left are a
wheel-barrow full of bricks.(we leave them out of respect)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">anyhow, onward and upward! the first time i remember having
any experience with them ----- there were four of them, mother, father, son,
daughter ---- was when i was 5 and was starting school. the mother would watch
me out of the window until i got on the bus, which picked us up in our
driveway. i didnt know i should be scared, and so i wasnt. over the years they
became more and more active. the kids would play with my brother and i(i.e.
hide and seek with objects). we had a hurricane come through in about 85 or so,
and that was the first time we really got a good look at the parents..we heard
a very loud and alarming noise from the barn(alarming because we had horses
that might be hurt) so we ran out the back door with flashlight in hand. what
we saw would forever be cememted in our( my bros and my) mind. there was a 3ft
by 3ft hole cut into the inside wall of the barn for pass-through ease for my
grandfather, and it was the ONLY way to get from the barn yard to the from
pasture when the gates were closed.we stood in the middle of the back yard,
well able to see the barn yard and the pasture at the same glance, and what we
saw was this. the barnyard, where our horses were suppose to be was empty( e
had an appelousa and a throughbred, both VERY tall horses). the app. was in the
front pasture standing under the biggest tree in the center of the pasture. he
was being held by a man with rain gear of some sort on. a very large blue aura
surrounded the man and our horse. the man was petting him and laying his head
on the horses shoulder. our horse had his head droped and leaning into the man.
he looked very calm and happy to be with the man. the same night we saw the
wife running from room to room as if she was checking on everyone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">from that time on we saw them many, many more times. when my
brother and i moved out in 93, we no longer saw or heard them when we would
visit. we were saddened as our new family members who owned the house then were
NOT by any means a loving family. i guess our ghost didnt like them. when i
stayed in the house for a 3 months in the spring of 2003 i didnt hear a peep
from them until very late one night when my son was running around the house. i
heard him playing with his toys, but all of the sudden, i hear so much laughter
and none of it was from my son. the laughter came from all rooms of the house
at some point. i just cried. i was so happy to hear them again. i can only
imagine that they were happy that i was back and broght with me, love and a new
child to play with. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the house has since been sold again, to a non relative. i
hope the new owners are a loving family and are good company to our beloved
ghost.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: DBooth8633@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The legend says that deep in the woods of Mulberry Grove,
lived a very old man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a widow and
lived with no one, not even a pet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
house was made of stone, and nestled deep in the woods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night, his house caught on fire and in a
couple of hours burned to the ground.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The neighbors saw the flames and called the fire dept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They arrived to late, but the firefighters
still searched for the man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple of
minutes searching and some of the firefighters saw the man wondering in the
woods by his house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They went over to
him but when they got to his side, he disagreed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They called over the Chief and they started
searching again where they had once saw him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a while, the Chief sent them home to get some rest "Too much
smoke in your lungs" the chief had said and sent them on their way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A couple of days later, a neighbor called the police saying
that she had seen the man wondering around the ruins of his home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police got there and looked around, but
saw no one, and saw no indication that someone had been there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police left shortly afterward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That night the woman looked through her
window and saw the man wondering about the house ruins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went outside to look for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she got outside she heard this horrible
noise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like someone in very deep
pain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About a year later, the same woman
heard the same sound again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went
outside and saw the man wondering about.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She went to him, but as soon as she got to him, he disagreed.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night as I was coming home from school, I took the road
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What I heard was a sound as of
someone was in excruciating pain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
said that the man comes out to look for something in the ruins of his house
each year to the date that his house was burned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each time he tries to look for something that
he lost in the fire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And each time he

<p class="MsoNormal">Location: <st2:place><st2:City>Fairfield</st2:City> <st2:State>PA</st2:State></st2:place>,
(8 miles south west of <st2:City><st2:place>Gettysburg</st2:place></st2:City>)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was babysitting for some friends of the family, they live
in a very large farm house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know
how old it is but it was built before the civil war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's large and it's old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sadly it's owners have yet to experience
anything unusual, but they've had a hard time keeping baby sitters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are some things about old houses that
I'd like to point out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've spent nights
in that house for many years so I'm used to it character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also grew up in a old house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For starters they make noise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lots of noise, if you walk they creek, if the
wind blows they creek.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plus they contain
a large volume of air so they breath as pressure inside equals itself with the
air pressure outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plus being alone
in a big old house can be creepy.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was baby sittings for friends, they're little girl had
been asleep for around 2 hours and I was in the living room watching TV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a open door that led out into a
hallway and a door leading to the dining room, the door to the dining room was
normaly kept shut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That room was being
renovated at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So there I was
watching TV, I didn't feel anything no chills, no breeze none of the classic
6th Sense stuff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly I heard a door
handle jiggle, my gaze shot over to the dining room door and I gawked as it
shook up and down for around 10 seconds straight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>OOOOKAY.....going up stairs to check on the
kid.....she was fast asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Went back
to the living room and resumed watching TV.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>20 minutes later it happened again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nobody else was in the house, had it been the little girl I was
babysitting I would have known, I'd be able to hear her trying to sneak down
the steps, those floors creek like mad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've babysat there several times after, nothing odd ever
happened again...kinda disapointing hehe. Though I was definitly freaked out.</p>

 <st1:Sn>University</st1:Sn></st2:place> (not a college</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">anymore) for four years (staying in the dorms) and felt I should
add</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">to the listing.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">First of all, <st2:place><st1:Sn>Saint</st1:Sn> <st1:middlename>Leo</st1:middlename>
 <st1:Sn>University</st1:Sn></st2:place> has transitioned over the years</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">from a military academy to a university.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of it's dorms was a</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">convent for many years before the university bought it from
the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">sisters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Holy Name
Monastery where the nuns live is next to the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">freshman dorm, the building that used to house the nuns, and
Saint Leo</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Abbey where the monks reside is on the campus).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My freshman year I lived in the Marmion/Snyder Hall
dormitory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">that time the girls lived in Marmion, the guys in
Snyder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lived on</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the third floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
the hallways were indoors I left my door open. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The dormitory is very small and you easily know everyone who
resides</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">on your floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
roommate and I had several occurrences of hearing</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">footsteps and shuffling in the hallway and when we'd look
out to see</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">who was coming or going nobody was there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In Snyder Hall there are four floors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bottom level is called</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">'Garden Level'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nobody was housed on the Garden Level in my year. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Several of us would go down there, however, and an eerie
feeling</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">inevitably overcame you.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I never ever wanted to be alone down there. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Also, the doors of the rooms to this floor had what looked
like evil</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">faces in the grain.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Other students told me about weird experiences they had as
well. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Several talked about the nun that would tap your shoulder
while you</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">were in the shower (the Marmion dorm).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One girl spoke about a blue</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">orb floating in the corner of her room (also in Marmion).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The other side of the campus wasn't free of intrigue either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rumor</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">was that back when Leo was a military school one of the
cadets hung</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">himself in his dormitory rather than go to war in WWII.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Saint Leo</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">never housed students in that room to my knowledge.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I don't know if you can use any of these occurrences when
you update</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the index of hauntings, but I felt compelled to share.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I am writing on a
personal experience at Ocean Pier One. My family always takes a trip to the
beach each summer. We always take a trip to Pier One. This time I took a friend
with me. We had to go to the bathroom, so we entered it. It was one where it
isn't just like one restroom but like 5 stall restroom. It didn't have a lock
on any of the sides. We went to the bathroom and when we were heading out, the
door was locked. My friend and I tugged and tugged on it. We started to freak
out. Then when we thought any thing wasn't going to get worse, it did. The
lights went out. It was pitch black. I had a shopping bag on my arm. I felt
either it slipping off or someone pulling it off. I told my friend that I
couldn't find it. We felt everywhere but still no sign for it. We then started
to cry. Apparently no one heard us. I looked through my purse to see if
anything could get us out of there. It was sooooooo scary. I found a big
flashlight in my purse. I had never had a flashlight in my purse. That was
freaky. I turned it on and it started flashing. Finally, about 10 minutes after
that we got out. We ran out screaming and crying. My mom asked us what had
happened and we told her the whole story. We couldn't find our merchandise any
where. We put the flashlight into the ocean(what a stupid thing to do).So we
went back to our lodge. It was at the end of the week and we were about to
leave when we went to the rest room. We found a bag on the toilet seat. It had
all our merchandise with it!!!!! We were amazed. It had a typed out letter in
the bag. It read:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I think this belongs
to you. Another of your belongings is on the porch. Signed, Anonymous. The
lodge we were staying in was more of a hotel. We were on the sixth floor.
Overlooking the ocean. We went out on the porch when we found the flashlight
untouched. It was not wet, it had the exact same batteries and it was in
perfect shape. When we got home, we looked in our documents and it had
something we had never written. It's title was: The Letter. We looked into it
and it said exactly what it said on the letter. Today, still, we get weird and
unusual emails and documents.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My father is from Douglas,Az and throughout my teens we have
attended many social funtion in Douglas in which being a large family we have
always stayed at the Gadsen Hotel.I was aware of the stories featured in
magazines and certain T.V programs dealing with the haunting possibility.I
never really bought into the ghosts idea.Until one occassion when after
attending a wedding and returning to my room with my girlfriend at the time I
undressed out of my suit and due to lazyness and fatigue I didnt hang my suit
on a hanger.The recliner in the room would be good enough until the mourning.At
approx 3 am I heard a noise as did my girlfriend,we thought it sounded like a
slamming door. In the am when I woke up my suit was not only hung but put in
dry cleaners plastic and put in the closet. This is something I would never
have done nor would my girlfriend because she was unaware that I had traveled
with the plastic from cleaners</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">i have a strong belief in these kinds of things. i have
experienced a few things myself and have heard of a few from my parents and
other family members...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i have so many stories, id like to share a few of them...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">a sort of funny one my dad told me when i was younger... we
lived in my great grandparents house, my pappy grew up next door, he had moved
in with his grandmother when his mom died, because he didnt get along with his
stepmother... when he married my grama, they moved back into the house he was
born. my dad and my aunt told me that my grama didnt allow any males in her
room, except my pappy. my room growing up was her old room. one night when i
was just a baby, my parents got into a fight and my dad came in my room to
sleep in the extra bed. he was just about to fall asleep when a picture hanging
on the wall behind his head suddenly crashed to the floor... he just got up and
said "alright alright mom, im leaving.." i thought it was pretty
funny. also, when i was little, after my grama died, my parents took care of my
pappy who had a stroke. they would always push an ottoman in the doorway of the
living room where his bed was so i couldnt bother him. but every single night
while they were sleeping (keep in mind, pappy was paralyzed, and could not
walk) they would hear banging downstairs in the living room, below their room
and when they would go downstairs, the ottoman would be moved from the doorway.
my dad was angry because it would always wake them up in the middle of the
night.. once, he said "mom, if your here, then show us now!" and then
suddenly a spider dropped down right in front of him. : ) after a while they
decieded grama didnt want them to block me from playing with my pappy : ) </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">another story is many years later... my dad died from
lukeimia and my mom was having health problems. the doctors said that she was
under extreme physical and emotional stress, from taking care of my dad for so
long and then he died. so she was in and out of the hospital. when she was in
the hospital, my aunt (dads sister) would stay with us during the week (so we
could go to school) and we would stay at her house on the weekends. one night,
when she was there, i was getting ready for school. i was in my room decieding
what to do w/ my hair the next morning. my sister and i shared the room (still
gramas old room). i turned on my curling iron, and sat on the toychest my dad
made us when my sister was born and talked to my sis who was laying in bed.
when i decieded it should be hot enough, i got up, picked it up and put it to
my hair and it was cold. i figured i didnt turn it on, like i thought, so i
turned it on this time and made sure i did, and sat back down. this happened 3
or 4 times. i even told my sister. i held it up, showed it to her, said
"it IS on this time!" and waited again. i just thought i was going
crazy. the last time, it was off AGAIN! i told my sister and we both started
screaming. we ran down to my aunt and told her and she asked are you sure u
didnt just bump it? but the button was hard to push over when you were trying
to switch it on and off. so i knew that wasnt the case and told her. we told
her that we werent sleeping in our room that night, and she insisted we were
being silly... it was just grama playing with us. she just wanted us to know
she was there. now this was the first time she had ever made her presence known
to us, and i was 15 years old, and she died when i was a few months old. we
slept in the room that night beacause my aunt was convinced it was grama and
there was no reason to be afraid of her. she hadnt made her presence again
after that. maybe she didnt want to scare us..</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">another night years later, my mom was taken to the hospital
w/ heart problems. my sister went with her and my brother and little cousin
stayed with me. my brother was in the living room in the back of the house
playing with his game boy. my cousin and i were sitting at the kitchen table
playing "triominos", my dads favorite game. there is a hall leading
from the kitchen to the front door. we had a metal door that needed oiled badly
koz when it opened and closed it creaked loud. suddenly i heard it open and
close. i thought maybe my mom had come home. but noone walked in. i didnt know
if i was hearing things or if i really heard it but i didnt wanna scare the
kids so i decieded not to say anything. but my cousin looked up at me and
whispered "did you hear that?!" and i casually answered "hear
what?" and he said "someone just came in the front door.." and i
freaked! i ran into the living room, told my little brother (who tends to be
braver than me) and we all grabbed a weapon. my brother a hockey stick, my
cousin a baseball bat and me a baton. and the cordless phone. we decieded
whoever came in had to have gone staight up the stairs, since they didnt come
into the kitchen. so we were going to investigate. the door was locked as it
was since the moment my aunt left to the hospital and told us to leave it
locked. we never made it past the first step. we kept counting "1..2..3..
" to coax us up the stairs but we couldnt move, we were so scared. suddenly
the phone rang and scared us to death. it was my neighbor calling to check on
us and i was crying and told her someone was in the house. i knew it wasnt a
human person but she was scared and told us to meet her out in the street and
she was going to call the police. he came and searched the whole house...
nnoone was there.. i knew.. i knew it wasnt a person. i knew later it was silly
to be scared. maybe it was daddy or grama or pappy checking on us since we were
home all alone. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i moved out on my own when i was 19 years old. i got an
apartment with a friend. our bedrooms were connected by a door. we kept it open
just a crack when we first moved in, it kind of made us feel more secure... it
was both of our first times on our own.. one night while i was sleeping, i had
wokeup suddenly. there was a sound like a wind in my room. i wasnt sure what it
was and was a little creeped out but usually when im creeped out like that, i
try to ignore it... "pretend you didnt even notice. pretend you dont even
know its there.. just roll over and go back to sleep.." and this time, i
thought the same thing... but i couldnt. i couldnt move. i couldnt roll over.
there was wind and i was stuck right where i was. i was so scared. i wanted to
call to my roommate for help.. but i couldnt speak... nothing but barely a
whisper came out.. i kept trying and trying but nothing. finally i just thought
over and over "just leave me alone! just go away, leave me alone!"
and suddenly-it sopped. the wind was gone, and the pressure was gone... just
like turning off a switch. and somehow i just rolled over and went back to
sleep, somehow. i dont know how! it still scares me when i think about it,
though it never happened again. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the only other thing that happened there was that i would
always see a little black cat in the corner of my eye. running away. it never
really occured to me right away cause i was used to having a cat, but he didnt
live with me, we werent allowed animals there. i would suddenly think
"that wasnt mr. kitty.." but by the time id look it would be gone. i
never told anyone but my little brother was visited a few times and he told me
he saw a little black cat in the corner of his eye a few times when he was
there. i told him i see it too then.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">one fall, my sister, her boyfriend Jay and i visited a
graveyard, just for fun. we took along his moms little camcorder for kicks, see
what we could see. we were following Jay around and he was taping and talking a
bit, focusing on a few cool looking headstones and that kind of thing.. my
sister and i were holding hands... we were a little nervous :<span style="">&nbsp; </span>). suddenly not half a foot away from me, i
heard someone walking beside me, like they were dragging their feet through the
grass and leaves. my sister heard it too, and we grabbed eachother and jumped
over to the side a bit and told Jay what we heard. but we kinda laughed it off,
we were there hoping to see and hear things like that. when we were leaving we
saw a yellow ball fly past us and disappearon the roof of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the car. like it went into the car. Jay said
that if you look in the rearview mirror when you get in your car, youll see
someone sitting there in your backseat. so he videotaped it. and he did see
someone.. of course i was in the backseat, there was someone sitting right next
to me, he told me he could see the head and shoulders. i was so freaked. i saw
it on the tape later, btu not then, thank God. when we got back to my apartment
we watched the tape and saw so many things we didnt see while we were there..
like when he was focused on a headstone of a child that was probally about 4 or
5 when they died, i cant remember, suddenly, in the video, a small figured had
run past, from behind him, past the stone, and then over to the side and was
gone. sooo creepy, cause we didnt see it when we were there, but we saw it in
the video. we also saw some orbs in the video. i hope to do that again
sometime. it was really fun.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">im sorry its so long, its just really exciting to share
these kinda of stories... : ) good job on your site by the way. lots of
interesting reading... </p>

myself. I was only 7or 8 when I first saw a ghost/spirit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was my grandmother, and she came to tell
me that she was okay now and that I was supposed to be a good girl. I later
learned that she had passed away 20 minutes before that.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Also for the better part of a few months I had this shadow

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunted House in MA</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: barrudaki@comcast.net</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've been reading the stories on your site and decided to
share one of many occurrences that I have had through out my lifetime. I was
about 26 when I moved in with my boyfriend (now my x) and his parents. Prior to
moving in, at times I had gotten feelings of being watched. The house was well
over 150 years old maybe more. It had been used back in the colonial days as a
safe house for the Underground Railroad. There is a secret room in it and the
only way to get to it now, is if you get on the roof and climb down the chimney.
The chimney has footholds going down the inside of it. From what I understand
the room was used as a safe room in case the Indians attacked and tried to burn
the house down, the family would be able to get to the room from inside the
house. The house would burn around them but they would be safe and then could
climb up the chimney to escape. It is believed that at the beginning of the
stairway on the first floor is where the original access to the secret room is
located though no one was really sure. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The house has gone through several renovations over the
years and the original design is no longer known. The house while I was there
was divided in to two halves. One side my boyfriend and I lived on that had a
living room, bedroom, and a back room/ kitchenette of sorts. There were two
ways to enter his side. One way was; as you walked in the front door you took a
left and walked into the double doors that lead into his living room. Or you
could go through the small hallway between his parent&#8217;s dining room and his
room. The hallway was set up more like a closet with doors on each end, that
space use to be where the stoves were located when the house was first built.
The stairway up to the second floor is very steep; it is built over the area
where the fireplace use to be. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The first thing to happen to me was an innocent teasing. I
was sitting at my boyfriend&#8217;s computer, which is in his living room, playing a
video game and listening to my cd player. The desk had an L shaped return where
I was resting my arm. While I was playing the game I felt and heard a slight
taping on the return. At first I didn't think anything of it, but then thought
that maybe my boyfriend was trying to be subtle about wanting my attention. I
turned my chair around to face him and I was saying,"Did you want
something." But when I turned around there was nobody there. So I turned
back around and started playing the game again. A few minutes later the taping
started again. Each time I turned and no one would be there. By this time I was
thinking that maybe my boyfriend was playing a trick and moving out my line of
sight. the next time the taping started, I whirled completely around. No one
was there and my boyfriend had just walked into the living room from his room,
in time to see me spinning in the chair. I told him what happened and he said
that it was just one of the ghost that playing with me. He then told me that
the house had several ghost and they had one confirmed sighting of a little
girl. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I guess overtime I had become the target. Occasionally I
would place something down and it would disappear end up in a different room.
At first I thought it was I just not remembering where I put things. Then one
night my boyfriend had placed his wallet on the dresser in his room and went in
his living room to read a book. There is a doorway between his room and the
living room but no door. He was sitting on the couch and out of the corner of
his eye he watched his wallet lift up off his dresser float in mid air and
place itself on the other dresser across the room. He went into his room and
confirmed that his wallet was now indeed on the other dresser, not where he put
it before.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There would be other odd occurrences that would go on. His
toilet flushing by it self, every once in a while I would see a dark shape near
the heater in his kitchenette. The one thing that was most interesting is that
I would be sitting in the living watching TV and I would see a black and white
cat run across the doorway between the living room and his room. I once told
his older sister about the cat and she then told me that they use to have a
black and white cat named Patches.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I only lived there for about a year when him and I had
broken up and I moved out. We got back together but that is where things
changed. There were nights that I would stay over; he would have to go to work
earlier than I (before sunrise). After he left some mornings I would be half in
and out of sleep but I would feel the weight of someone curled up on my back
laying next to me. The first time I thought that my boyfriend and come back
home feeling ill or something. I turned over and nothing was there. The weight
had gone. I thought maybe again one of the ghosts was just playing a trick on
me. Then another time the same thing happened but this time; I felt the slight
weight of someone hand caressing my side. I got out of the bed. This went on
for a few weeks to the point that I no longer wanted to stay in the house
without him there. I told him about it but neither one of us could come with an
explanation. (Until later which I won't get into right now.) It kept happening
until one morning, I bolted up and yelled, "Your not Ken so stop it!"
It stopped for a time, but then I changed jobs and didn't have to go in until a
later time and somet ng else started to happen.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The first time I stayed over after changing jobs, my
boyfriend left at his usual time. I was lying awake in bed trying to get back
to sleep. My boyfriend had left the hallway doors open so I could see down the
hall way and into his parent&#8217;s dining room. I was facing the hallway when
suddenly what looked liked someone holding a lantern up walking; crossed the
doorway on the dining room side and go into his parent&#8217;s kitchen. I was alone
in the house; his parents were away. My initial thought was that someone had
broken in, but I had not heard any sounds. I remained still my heart pounding.
I saw the light again cross the doorway; it came from the kitchen, like someone
was looking for something. I decided to mustard up the courage to go out there
and see what was going on. My boyfriend keeps a dagger under his bed, so I
grabbed the dagger and walked out the room. I was shaking; I thought for sure
someone else was in the house and trying to rob it. I turned on the closet
light switch to me. But found nothing. I checked all the doors; they were
locked. Shaken and quite awake, I dressed, left the house and hung out at the
local coffee shop until I had to go to work. When I told my boyfriend about it
his response was, "Oh that's the caretaker, he may have just been
wondering what you were doing still in bed." Until that day I had never
encountered that ghost, and it terrified me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After that day things escalated with that ghost. My
boyfriend&#8217;s parents headed down south for the winter and left him in charge of
the house. I would still stay over at times but after he left for work I would
migrate to the couch in his living room, in hopes of avoiding the caretaker. A
series of incidents caused me to finally break and get mad. I was sleeping on
the couch and I would hear and feel the vibrations of pounding footsteps that
would start from the dining room, go through my boyfriend&#8217;s room and end at the
doorway of the living room. I had it and yelled, "I don't have to be up at
that &lt;bleep&gt;ing time anymore so leave me alone."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The caretaker continued with his antics.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I stayed less and less during the week. If by chance I did
stay; I would stay up after my boyfriend left and watch TV or work on the
computer. His parents came back and things calmed down a bit except for the
times when I would stay on a Friday and my boyfriend had to work the next day.
I would still get visits from the caressing ghost even with if his parents were
there. The house was eventually sold but by that time, we had broken up. I have
other encounters with the paranormal but I will save those for another time.</p>
