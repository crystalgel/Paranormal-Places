<P><B>So Many Paranormal Things Happen to Me</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Banjaboo@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hey, just wanted to share a few experiences i've had.... enjoy!</B>
<BR><B>Experience #1</B>
<BR><B>I'm pretty sure this was the beginning of it all, bacause I can't
remember anything strange from before it. I was about six or so and I watched
the movie "chuckie" for the first time with my grandmother ( excellent
supervision, I might add )&nbsp; and it scared the living crap out of me.
I always remember being in the bathroom at odd hours of the night, waiting
for something to come get me. I don't even know what it was, I just knew
it was coming whatever it was. I would then see sort of little things passing
through the hallway (from the bathroom you can see just the hallway) and
they always would do this, never going away. Knowing these things would
be there when I went to the bathroom, I developed the habit of not going
in there without my grandmother or sister. To this day I have never told
anyone about many of my scary experiences (except for you, Shadowlands!)
because I thought that by validating them they would return to hurt me
or someone I knew, but I now know that I have the power to tell who or
what can and cannot be in my house or presence. :-)</B>
<BR><B>Experience #2</B>
<BR><B>Around halloween I was watching television, sitting on the couch,
alone, while everyone was in the kitchen "helping" with dinner. I was about
nine or ten at the time. All of a sudden one of the couch cushions seeped
in slowly, like someone was sitting down. I was very freaked out but not
scared. I knew immediatly that it was my deceased great grandmother (of
whom i don't remember, she passed when i was two) sitting down to be with
me. I just sat there looking at the couch wondering if anything else was
going to happen. About five minutes later it pulled back up again like
she was getting up, and I knew she was gone. A little later I found out
that the day she had done that was October 30, her birthday. I was glad&nbsp;
that i had gotten to spend a little more time with grakamother (the nickname
we gave her).</B>
<BR><B>I hope that you will post these stories for me, or drop me an email
if you want another experience story. I'll never run out of them, because
paranormal things happen all the time to me!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Sleeping Problems</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: princessgirl77598@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My family and I have been expierencing encounters with a spirit for
years. I am going to tell you when it all started, I am not sure if it
is more then one ghost but here goes:</B>
<BR><B>It all started when I met my husband (then boyfriend), he would
come stay with me at my moms' house a couple of nights a week. It first
started happening to him, then me a couple of weeks later. We would be
sleeping and wake up, unable to move, or make any noise. It was like something
was holding us down, we would have to make ourselves breath very hard to
wake on another up so we could shake eachother to get out of it. After
this happened for a few months, about every other night to one of us.</B>
<BR><B>We moved about an hour away and got our own place. After we were
done unpacking and everything situated, we hung up everything on the walls
which included my boyfriends surfboard, on two very sercure surf racks,
we hadn't moved our bed in yet so we were sleeping on a palate on the livingroom
floor. Well the first night we went to sleep, at 3am on the dot, the board
flew off the wall and landed about 1 inch away from our heads. We thought
that was wierd, but hung it up the next day and then the very next night
at 3am, the board flew off the wall again, again landing right by our heads.
After this night, needless to say we didn't hang it back up after that.
I would also have a re-accuring dream about a little boy being locked in
one of the closets. About 3 weeks later, we moved out of there and moved
in with his dad.</B>
<BR><B>We were going to stay there for about a month until we got money
for a down payment on an apartment. Nothing really scarey happened while
we lived there except the occasional feeling when you are walking down
the hall and you just feel something behind you. My boyfriend in 6'4, 200
p nds and it was a sight to see him run into the bedroom scared out of
his mond becasue he felt a pressence behind him. Well after we got the
down payment, we moved out in one day. It was quick and then we had our
own place. That is when things at the house started happening. After we
left, it was his dad there by himself. One day he come home and went up
stairs to the room we used to stay in and found the most craziest thing.
It had a large closet with thick metal shelves and metal brackets. Everything
in the closet was placed out in the bedroom and all of the shelves were
bent in half and torn off the wall. This house had an alarm and all and
there is no way someone came in when he wasn't home and did this. Then
about a week later, he was downstairs in his bedroom and had his patio
door open doing paperwork for his business. He had his home phone and cell
phone laying on the bed right next to him. He just hung up the phone and
was going through some papers when he looked and his cell phone was gone.
He searched for about 2 hours, everywhere, in the house and his truck thinking
there was no way, but maybe he missplaced it. No luck. Then the next day
he is out side in the back yard and hears his phone ringing, he looks and
at the very back of his large backyard, sitting straight up in the grass
is his cell phone. Then about a week after that, it was about 5pm and he
was in his room watching t.v. The floors up stairs are old and sqeaky and
you can hear someone walking up there very well. He heard someone up there
walking around the kitchen and then up and down the stairs. He went upstairs
and no one was there. He said "I am sick of this, this is my home, I will
not be scared away, quit this!" He went downstairs and sat on the bed,
and sure enough if the shower in his bathroom didn't turn on! He was freaking
out, there was no way this could happen. He walked slowly to his bathroom
and pushed open the door, and the water turned off. He slid open the shower
door, water was dripping and steam was bellowing out. Ne less to say, this
freaked him out so he went and stayed at his girlfriends for a week. Then
he came home and was home for about 3 days when he was in his room watching
t.v. again, and heard the noises upstairs, this time it was stomping around
hard. He screamed at it from downstairs saying "I am not going to let you
scare me this time. " He turned up the t.v, and that t.v. just turned off!!
He ran out of there and went to his girlfriends again for a week. He called
us and said "Look, I think this ghost is mad that ya'll left it here, I
want you to come over and take it home." So we went over there and were
all sitting downstairs, it was summer and it was hot and stuffy down there.
Right before we left we said "OK, we are leaving, if you want to come let's
go" We sat for a second and then the room became ice cold. It was the scariest
thing I have ever felt. We jsut got up and went outside and got in the
car. Nothing has ever happened since, and I am not sure if it is still
with us, but after all of these happenings, I truly believe in ghosts,
and anyone that we tell sometimes doesn't belive us. But it was all real.</B>

<BR><B>Seeing Shadows</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kurtsstuff@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi. I have been visiting your site for a while now and i wish to
submit my</B>
<BR><B>own expeirence. I never thought these things could be ghosts untill
i read</B>
<BR><B>some of your other stories. Now I wonder just how many are ghosts.
Well,</B>
<BR><B>here goes. I moved into my new house when I was in the third grade.
It</B>
<BR><B>looked perfect for us at the time, but after a while I began to
see strange</B>
<BR><B>shadows. They started upstairs. When I walk upstairs sometimes I
am able to</B>
<BR><B>see a shadow receding into the corner of my moms bedroom, which
is directly</B>
<BR><B>visible from the staircase. If I move in to the room where the shadow
was</B>
<BR><B>headed I find nothing. I know it is not an outside light causing
it because</B>
<BR><B>my moms shades are closed. I also see the shadow when its dark.
It is</B>
<BR><B>slightly darker than the rest of the room and always used to head
for the</B>
<BR><B>same place. But now it is moving around the house. Sometimes when
I go</B>
<BR><B>downstairs to get a drink I see a person who looks just like my
mom turn</B>
<BR><B>around the corner and go into the kitchen, but as soon as I enter
there is</B>
<BR><B>no one there. Oh, the person who looks like my mom looks like my
mom looks</B>
<BR><B>like they are in shadows, even though the kithchen always has a
light on.</B>
<BR><B>I've also seen the look alike go upstairs and to the laundry room.
I think</B>
<BR><B>it can go outside too. On some nights I can hear people in my yard
below my</B>
<BR><B>window. It sounds like they are using the basketball net out there.
I can</B>
<BR><B>hear the ball hit the pavement over and over, but its when theres
a foot of</B>
<BR><B>snow outside!!!!!! I can also cleary hear voices outside, but I
cannot</B>
<BR><B>understand a word they are saying. I know they arnt speaking any
language i</B>
<BR><B>know. And i know a lot. I also have cold spots in my house. And
sometimes I</B>
<BR><B>get an evil feeling out of nowhere.</B>
<BR><B>It is really starting to get creepy. If anyone knows whats happening
please</B>
<BR><B>contact me.</B><B></B>

<P><B>"Roderick"</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: tofujoe@sunny-net.ne.jp</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was 16 years old, I spent the summer at My Aunt Dorothy's
House in Manassas, Va. My Cousins lived closeby and since we were always
close, I spent lots of time over Ron and Donna Sue's House. They had a
beautiful house, in a newly devloping part of Manassas (around 1980)</B>
<BR><B>They told me about some of the odd things that happened around there
and everyone one of them have called their ghost "Roderick" (Just a nickname
that my Cousin Pam called him one day) He didn't seem to be a violent ghost,
he just made his presence known from time to time.</B>
<BR><B>Before I begin though, a little History about my hometown of Manassas,
Va. The 1st and 2nd Battle of Bull Run were fought there. Although the
main Battlefield is where the Major Part of the Battles took place, there
were skirmishes all around that area. It's a very historical area.</B>
<BR><B>One day Pam was waxing her car in the garage and she heard footsteps
coming right behind her. It sounded like boots walking on the cement. She
turned around and there was no one there. Thinking it may have been an
echo from someone walking down the street, she resumed waxing and the steps
came right up behind her. She turned around and said "Dammit Rodrick, I'm
not in the mood!" She went back to waxing her car and the steps started
again....This time going away from her.</B>
<BR><B>She told all of us about what had happened and soon everyone else
was talking about what had happened to them. My Cousin Donna Sue was taking
a nap one day in her room and someone brushed his hand across her cheek.
She said "Hi hun" thinking it was her husband Ron and when she didn't hear
him say hello, she opened her eyes to discover that no one was there!</B>
<BR><B>Another time, in the same room, My Cousin Ron was watching T.V.
on the bed and saw the door to the closet open up right before his eyes.
Then, a few minutes later it closed.</B>
<BR><B>Same room again, Donna Sue discovered a coat hanging up one day
that was far too big for Ron. It was just hanging in the closet along with
the rest of the clothes. She decided maybe the dry cleaners had made a
mistake, so she took the coat out of the closet and sat it aside so she
could return it and ask them about it. The coat (Blue) had no tag on it
from the dry cleaners, nor did it even have a manufacturer's tag, size
or anything. The next morning, the coat was missing.</B>
<BR><B>Their dog would go out to the yard and dig in the same spot all
the time, over and over, they constantly had to keep filling in the area
where the dog had dug. (Please note that all of these occurances happened
while there was construction going on a lot nearby)</B>
<BR><B>There were studs that appeared to be poking out of the walls, all
around their house. They showed me and we counted about 219 of them. They
didn't break through the walls or anything like that, but they protruded
out enough that the paint was starting to crack a little around a few of
them, you could clearly tell that they were poking out some.</B>
<BR><B>Then, the most bizarre thing happened one night....The footsteps
that woke up everyone in the house. Their house had wall to wall carpet.
So there's nothing to really explain this, but....Around the early morning
hours (probably about 12:45 or so) There was a loud sond like someone pacing
up and down the hallway wearing boots. The sound was that of boots walking
down a long wooden floor corridor. It woke up everyone in the house. Finally,
my Cousin Ron got up and walked to the door and said "Dammit Roderick,
we're trying to get some sleep!" Then the steps they heard stomped down
the stairs to the front door (which was locked, deadbolted and chained)
and the door opened and slammed with such force, it seemed to shake the
whole house!</B>
<BR><B>A few weeks later, the construction of the new house next door was
complete and "Roderick" never showed any type of presence there again.</B>
<BR><B>We all talked this over. We believe that this Ghost was that of
a Civil War Soldier that was probably buried in their yard in an unmarked
grave. The construction nearby disturbed him and he got restless. Once
the construction was completed, he was finally able to rest in peace again.
The studs returned to their original places and the cracks in the paint
even disappeared too.</B>
<BR><B>Well, that's my story, Thanks for reading it.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Poltergiests in my Apartment</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>I lived in an apartment a few years ago that I was certain was haunted.</B>
<BR><B>I say this with great conviction. At first, I passed it off as nothing
and even after the fact, I had not really considered it to be a poltergiest
as the idea had never occurred to me.</B>
<BR><B>My girlfriend came to Texas to stay with me for awhile. After a
month, we decided to elope. When her conservative, Chinese parents found
out, I thought I was in for it. Her father flew down immediately and took
my back with her. They bought us a condo and moved us in right away. I
was working at Burger King and even though the rent was extremely low,
we had trouble making ends meet. Lots of stress between the two of us.</B>
<BR><B>After some time there, we bought a hamster. They're cute and easy
to maintain, so we figured what the heck. I thought I would be doing the
right thing by letting the hamster roam free around the house for a couple
hours a day. Turned out I was right in doing so, she lived for quite some
time and was the healthiest hamster ever.</B>
<BR><B>Now that the stage is set: While at my computer, I'd notice something
whisk by in my peripheral visiop. I would always pass it off as the hamster
running by. She was quite fast. Anytime I would look, I saw nothing.</B>
<BR><B>After several times of this happening, it dawned on me eventually,
"Hey, wait a second... the hamser's in her cage...." I again took it to
be my own imagination. No big deal.</B>
<BR><B>Meanwhile, my wife and I are having arguments almost on a daily
basis. The stress is getting to the both of us and we each find ourselves
becoming more enraged with the other person as the arguments continued.</B>
<BR><B>The black shadows in my peripheral vision got larger.</B>
<BR><B>In bed, my wife had gotten up and exclaimed she didn't know who
I was. I thought she was playing at first and playfully told her to shush.
Her antics continued and I was getting agitated. I turned around to get
out of bed, and she attacked me. She was for stronger than usual, but still
relatively easy to sustain. She started kicking me rather hard in the ribs,
and I had to end it. I head-butted her good and hard. My vision went white
and my ears rang. She seemed to have come to and she was crying. She knew
I had hit her and she was very scared. I was crying and I tried to convince
her of what had happened. She didn't readily accept it, but my tears and
pleading voice seemed to have provided sufficient proof.</B>
<BR><B>I carressed her hair and she dozed off. She woke up in a start and
said, "You won't get off the hook so easily next time." She tried getting
up to get dressed. Apparently, she had friends she wanted to visit. I managed
to lay her down again and get her back to sleep. When she came to, she
was herself again.</B>
<BR><B>These manifestations were numerous. There were several different
"personalities" that introduced themselves. They all seemed to know each
other and they all had one thing in common. They hated me.</B>
<BR><B>I spent the better part of the next few months sleeping with them,
rather than my wife. I conversed with them and plead my case with them.
I had tried to convince them that I wasn't the terrible husband they thought
I was. The manifestations disappeared for awhile, but the black shadows
were getting worse. I could never see them directly, only outside my field
of vision.</B>
<BR><B>The manifestations came back, but fewer different ones. I believe
only two. They had threatened that if things didn't improve, they would
take over and my wife would be no longer. I cried at the prospect of losing
the person I fell in love with to something else like that.</B>
<BR><B>The times when my wife was herself, we talked about it and she was
aware that she wasn't herself. She could only remember being asleep most
times. Occasionally, events that transpired while she was "asleep" she
would remember as being a dream.</B>
<BR><B>The only good thing to come from these manifestations were the secrets.
They told me things about my wife that my wife had either forgotten about
or she had never wanted to tell me. One of which was her being bi-sexual.</B>
<BR><B>I did something dangerous at that point.... I left for Texas to
get a decent job. I ran away, so to speak. The stress was getting to be
too much and it was to the point that I was afraid these other beings were
going to end up harming me.</B>
<BR><B>My wife, as well as myself, were heartbroken. I had lied to her
to get away, and to this day I regret having done that (we're still together).</B>
<BR><B>While in Texas, I confided in some friends about the black shadows
I had seen. One friend told me that black was bad and that could be the
presence of some sort of poltergeist. He embellished a bit.</B>
<BR><B>He went on to say that poltergiests feed off of negative energy
and generally cause mischief by the throwin of objects, tapping, etc. If
you recall at the beginning of this story, there was plenty of negative
energy going around.</B>
<BR><B>I stayed in contact with my wife during my time in Texas both via
phone and email. One time while we were talking online, she suddenly said,
"What the hell, someone's knocking." Checking the door, there was no one
there. The knocking continued and she traced the sound to the kitchen.
Something not visible was slamming the cutting board. The cutting board
was, however, was giving way to the weight. The cutting board has four
little rubber legs and my wife noticed that it was indeed giving ever so
slightly.</B>
<BR><B>She was extremely scared and locked herself in the bedroom for the
rest of the night talking to me.</B>
<BR><B>I paid for my wife to fly down to come stay with me. She was fine
and there was no evidence of those other personalities being present. We
moved together back to Canada and got another apartment. We've never been
happier.</B>
<BR><B>Only recently having heard of this Web site, it reminded me of my
past experiences. I read some of the stories here and have discovered that
other people have witnessed similar things. The House in Germany being
one:</B>
<BR><B>http://theshadowlands.net/ghost/ghost-a.htm#house</B>
<BR><B>I regret that day I ever hit my wife and it still saddens me to
know that I have done such a thing. My wife is still skeptical about the
whole poltergeist thing, and in the back of my mind, so am I. We have nothing
else to really explain the events that happened though.</B>
<BR><B>I've been told that poltergeists aren't even really visible, so
the black shadows may have been something else. I did some research on
the Internet and came up with this though:</B>
<BR><B>"Other investigators have also investigated agents finding that
those in poor mental and physical health are vulnerable to stress. Patient
having unresolved emotional tensions have been associated with houses where
poltergeist activity occurred. When studying the personalities of agents
psychologists found anxiety reactions, conversion hysteria, phobias, mania,
obsessions, dissociative reactions, and schizophrenia."</B>
<BR><B>Here's the source: http://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/p/poltergeist.html</B>
<BR><B>I did a bit of detective work about the tenant who lived in the
place before my in-laws bought it. She kept to herself and she was very
odd. She put locks and dead bolts on every door in the house, and the front
door had an extra lock on it (the kind the slide in place and can only
be undone from the inside). She was described as being someone who was
very paranoid.</B>
<BR><B>My in-laws rented it out fairly quick, and I haven't really thought
of "interviewing" the new tenant, but I'm strongly considering it. If I
find anything out, will I be able to post it?</B>
<BR><B>We now live in an apartment that doesn't appear to be plagued by
evil spirits and my wife and I rarely argue, if at all. We've been married
for four years and are still very much in love, and we expect to stay that
way.</B>
<BR><B>If we ever get our own house, we're going to do more research before
moving in ;)</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for your time,</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One early morning around
4:ooa.m. I was leaving my soon to be husbands home.Coming down Low water
bridge,in the middle of the bridge stood an older woman dressed in the
pioneer fashion.It seemed if she was looking straight into my eyes.I was
so scared that I rode my bike as fast as I could back up the hill.At the
top I stopped and turned back and she was gone.I waited, but she never
reappeared.I took of on my bike riding as fast as I could down over the
bridge sence the only other way back to my home was acrossed the swinging
bridge (thats another story) or go acrossed town which I couldn't do in
fear of being caught(I had snuck out).The scariest thing that happened
though was a couple of days after that I was going home after it had rained.Thinking
I could cross the flooded bridge,I went ahead.I had almost made it half
way when I was drug under by the rushing water.All I remember doing was
praying not to die as it drug me around the bend of the creek.I finally
hit dirt where I was able to pull my self out.Walking home (since my bike
was gone) crying and thanking the Lord for saving me, I remembered the
old woman. I like to think she had shown herself as a warning to me. I
have been back there a couple of times,but have never seen her again</B>

<BR><B>Our family "ghost" saved a life.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: marybouchard2003@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I grew up in a very old home in Conn. that had what was referred
to a family ghost. We would hear footsteps and he would take things and
change TV and radio channels and things would leap across the room.</B>
<BR><B>As I grew up we took him in stride till on day I left my daughter
upstairs with my dad and went to work with my mom.&nbsp; I came home to
a very shaken dad that said as it was late let Missy my daughter stay as
she was asleep.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning my dad told us he had put her to bed when it sounded
as if all hell was breaking loose upstairs, he thought she was jumping
on the bed as the banging was so loud so he went upstairs to yell at her.&nbsp;
(she was 2)</B>
<BR><B>As he entered her room he found her eyes fixed to the ceiling and
blue she had stopped breathing and was limp.&nbsp; He shook her and started
CPR. she started breathing and crying.</B>
<BR><B>We had her checked with our family doctor and he found she was fine
but could not rule out sids.</B>
<BR><B>To date we still thank the ghost for saving Missy and he has intervened
through out my life during troubled times.</B>
<BR><B>My grown children will call and ask me to retrieve my ghost as he
is hanging out reeking electrical hijinx with TV and the stereo. My grandchildren
frequently talk over my shoulder to him and I know they too see him.</B>
<BR><B>I didn't know about orbs but have many family pictures full of them,
(I thought I was a very bad subject and picture taker!)&nbsp;&nbsp; I have
moved many times and he has always been at my side he is a truly loved
member of our family as he saved it several times.</B>
<BR><B>Once I was driving on the highway with my children to see there
father and the car radio went off and I "heard"&nbsp; and felt the strongest
urge to change lanes and just swerved and did.&nbsp; The gas truck that
had been in front of me rear ended someone and exploded into flames it
was such a close call that I had to take an exit.</B>
<BR><B>My father once joked I take after my Hungarian grandmother so I
truly wonder if he came with our old house or if he is really a family
ghost.&nbsp; I know a fortune teller once told me I was blessed by god
as I had a strong spirit looking out for me!</B>
<BR><B>And my mother swears she saw three black angels when I was born.</B>
<BR><B>I used to wonder what that meant as I grew up, but my ghost has
always been with me and looking out for me and mine.</B><B></B>

<P><B>New Friends Spirit</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: h-red@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I just bought an old Ford, 1923, Model T from an 86 year old man
that I've know for just a few years. He had it in his garage since 1960.
It belonged to his maternal Aunt. I don't tell even my wife about these
things, and I hope none of my friends frequent this sight. I am in the
process of restoring the old Flivver, and while I'm alone in the shop working
on it, I often feel the presence of the old guy's Aunt Libby. This car
was an important part of her life and I feel she's watching me, and even
helping me bring it back to life. Several of her old belongings were in
it when I got it, an old comb, a finger nail file, her sun glasses, and
a few more personal things, including two sticks of her favorite chewing
gum. Many times now, I feel there is someone in the shop with me, only
momentarily, and I feel strongly that I know who it is. It is a small shop,
twenty feet by twenty feet and I would know if someone came in. I am taking
many pictures of the restoration, and in one picture I captured one of
those, "Orbs," I've been hearing about lately. Once, I know that I didn't
have a certain tool to do something particular, it was in my other shop,
and I looked towards the work bench and there it was. I know I didn't have
it down there because I just used it on something else, in the other shop.
The electric was off another time because of a storm and I did what I could
do without electric, there is natural lighting in there. I got to a point
where I just had to use a grinder to continue what I was doing and move
on. I picked up the grinder and it worked, but the electric was still off.
I used it for a couple of seconds and laid it down when I was done. just
for kicks I picked it up again and tried it and, you guessed it, nothing.
After this restoration is complete I am going to hold a, "T" party and
the old fellow is going to come start it for the first time in forty three
years. I'm pretty sure Aunt Libby is going to be there too. She use to
sit in the "T" and write all of her letters. There were eight, empty bottles
of ink inside and two quill pens. I daydream that this must have been a
very cozy spot for her to just sit, write, and do some of her best thinking.
Her entire family remember her and always think of her, with the "T'. I
am not threatened or afraid of her being there and if she wants to help,
well she just can. It's okay with me. I find myself even talking to her
now and then, and watching what I say when things aren't going right. I
even feel she makes things happen and include this in my developing a familiarity
of her personality. I mean, for one thing, I got the car for $600 when
he knew the value of it. I was in a re-use-it store and found a whole roll
of just the right upholstery and it was marked, ten cents a yard. What
are the chances of that happening? Then I thought that I should re-do the
seats in a different color just for a nice contrast. Don't you know I found
just the right material for, you guessed it, ten cents a yard. I bought
the whole roll for a dollar. I have a lot to put into the project and I
feel she's watching over the budget. The car smells like her, the family
is drawn to always telling me stories about her when I don't even ask.
Even when I don't say it out loud when I leave the shop, I always find
that I smile and think to myself the words, "good night Aunt Libby."&nbsp;
I hope this isn't her just hanging around for the sake of some unfinished
business. I want her to ride with me when it's done too. I wouldn't mind,
(I don't think) actually seeing her spirit. Surely the one that's been
hanging around the, "vintage tin," is the one everyone's been talking about.
I never saw a picture of her but if I soon did, I think I would have put
the right face already on my imaginary friend, I think I already have.
The stories I've been hearing about her are assuring me that she was an
amusing,&nbsp; spirited old gal. Even in the late 1950's when model T's
were not on the road so much, the local police would hear her putting up
the road in it and stop traffic in all directions so she could just breeze
through the intersection. She use to show up at her great-niece's school
and have a discussion with the teacher to make sure she was, "getting a
proper education." She's my, "Little old lady from Pasadena." and, my new
friend. Reminds me of the show, "My Mother The Car." I will make another
posting if she does let me see her.</B>

<BR><B>Manchester NH ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: shannondriggers@lycos.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I first saw my former apartment in Manchester NH I knew somthing
was wrong. Two weeks after moving in things began to happen. I would be
sitting in my living room when I would smell a really horrible smell with
a very cold breeze. Numerious times I would see a mans shadow moving along
the wall in the hallway going from the living room/kitchin into my childrens
room or vice versa. At night while in bed I would hear footsteps going
back and forth in the hall. While watching TV in my bedroom one time the
TV shut off by itself about 3 seconds later it turned back on by itself
only it was blaring. The worst thing that happened was one night I will
never get over. I had gone to bed when I woke to feel a painful pressure
on my chest that felt like a hand, when I tried to get up I found myself
unable to move after finally using all of my strenth I was able to finally
sit up when I did I heard this man's wailing that seemed to come from every
corner of my place, the only I could th</B>
<BR><B>ink to do was grab my children and get out of there. When I got
to my car I relized that I was covered in sweat and my body was freezing
cold. One night going out with my neighbor my mother babysat for me, when
I got home my mother was as white as a sheet when I asked what had happened
she told me that while in the kitchen table she felt someone had walked
into the room thinking that it was my 3 year old she just said ok go back
to bed but when she turned around no one was there so she got up and went
to look in on him he was still asleep. So she went back to the kitchen
to play a game of solitare while playing she felt a cold breeze come over
her with a very foul smell when she looked down at the cards they were
being moved she finally told it to leave her alone and to go away it stopped.
I had lived with all of this for 3 years. Where I lived was in a very big
complex that was built in the early 1920s. Talking to other people there
some have said that they as well have dealt</B>
<BR><B>with strange things happening. Some of us have come up with one
possiblity that the complex may be built over an indian bural ground. Not
to far from us a river but to get there you need to go down a very steep
incline where the complex is all flat ground. Reading about the history
on the native americans in the Manchester NH area they always lived close
to rivers and lakes. But this is just a possiblity. All I know for fact
is that what ever is there is very angry and shows it.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Make Her Stop</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: silentsweetie18@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was seven years old my parents bought a 100 year
old house off my great grandparents.One night about three months after
we bought house my brother, Joe, and I were getting ready for bed, we had
to share a room on the account that the house was being fixed up and my
parents were re-doing the bedroom in the attic for me. Well any way Joe
and I had bunk beds at the time. Well after the lights went out we both
fell asleep. About two hours later I awoke to a strage coldness in the
room. I turned and looked and Joe, or at least I thought it was him, was
hanging his face over the side of the bed. I went to push his face up out
of mine but realized he was icy cold. I freaked out and flipped on the
lamp next to my bed never taking my eyes off the face. Well as soon as
the lights went on it dissappeared. I got up and looked at Joe who was
fast asleep. I figured I would leave him alone and just go back to sleep.
About a week later I was working on homework when I heard the bed room
door open and I seen a shadow with long hair looking over my shoulder as
I sat at my desk working on what I had to get done. Thinking it was my
mother I asked her for help. When she didn't reply I turned around to find
a girl in a white dress standing over me, her face pale and her eyes filled
with saddenss, her hair was long, about to her waist and she was crying.
She opened her mouth to say something, reached out her hand to touch my
face, and I screamed. Quickly she dissappered. After that I started to
see a young man walking around the house. Only he stayed by the bedroom
door and never scared me, after my 8th birthday I moved into my new room
and he started to sit in my room more often. I would watch tv and he would
sit on the corner of the bed tching it with me, he never really talked,
only showed facial expressions, and I never tried to talk to him, as I
got older he came around only when I was alone which wasn't very often,
getting ready for dates, or getting ready to hang out with my friends he
would watch me put on make up, pick out my clothes, or just simply wait
for my ride. After that I hadn't seen him for about two years. Then one
day when I was about sixteen out of no where Joe got sick. The doctors
weren't sure what was wrong with him. Well one night while he was sleeping
on the couch, his breathing became shallow, and his skin grew pale and
icy cold. Suddenly he screamed. "MAKE HER STOP!" my mother ran over and
sat next to him. She asked who and his reply. "The little girl in the corner,
she is wearing a white dress, she wont' stop crying" I suddenly felt sick
and went to my room. I had never said a word about her no less told anyone
about her, how would he know? Sitting on my bed I buried my face in my
pillows. I felt something smoothing out my hair, and turned to find the
young man, for the first time he talked to me. He told me everything would
be alright, just to keep the girl away from Joe. He told me to get him
to my room, and that "she" wouldnt' come up there. We did and with in a
week he was better. The young man is around almost 24/7 he still doesn't
talk much, just at times, and no matter what he does, he tells me to stay
away from the girl. I've looked into it several times and came to the conclusion
that the young man is a past cousin of mine. I'm not sure who, but I found
him in several family photos and I know he was killed when plowing a feild
and fell off the plow.....enough said.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Johns' Dad</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Tomospillman@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was younger, about 22 years ago, I had a friend named John.&nbsp;
He lived in Malverne, NY, as did I.&nbsp; If any place on this earth would
be haunted, it's Malverne - a true small country town in Nassau County,
NY. We had made plans to go out on the town that night. I got to John's
house around 9:00 P.M., but he wasn't ready yet.&nbsp; He gave me a beer,
the first of the night (yes it's the truth!), and preceeded to iron his
shirt; you had to look good for the grils, it was the early 80's.&nbsp;
The house was layed out with the kitchen ahd living room seperated by a
doorway.&nbsp; On the other side of the doorway was a stairway gotin up
stairs along the wall.&nbsp; I was standing in the kitchen next to the
wall.&nbsp; On the other side of the wall was the stairway up stairs.&nbsp;
I was facing the doorway but looking and talking to John, who was ironing
away in the center of the kitchen.&nbsp; All of a sudden I saw this guy
come around the corner, as if he came down the stairs, and squeeze between
me and the wall.&nbsp; As he did so, he hit me in the elbow and the knee,
spilling my beer.&nbsp; I immediately said "excuse me" and noticed that
it was impossible for anyone to have passed between me and the wall.&nbsp;
There was only around 10 inches between me and the wall.&nbsp; My friend
said "Who are you talking to ?"&nbsp; I expained what happened to me and
he said "what did the guy look like ?".&nbsp; I had actually got a good
look at the guy.&nbsp; I told him "He looked like your brother, only with
red hair, no shirt, no shoes and blue jeans on".&nbsp; I had, at first,
thought it was his brother, but only the two of us were in the house.&nbsp;
Ih asked me to follow him.&nbsp; We went into his mothers room.&nbsp; He
said to me "Is this the guy you saw?", as he pointed to a picture on the
mothers dresser.&nbsp; I said "yep, that's him!".&nbsp; He said "don't
worry, thats just my dad.&nbsp; He comes back from time to time to say
hello".&nbsp; I was a beever before, but this experiance confirmed my beliefs</B>

<BR><B>I Haven't been Back</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Patricia.Meneses@BellSouth.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well, I've seen many ghosts. I've also on occasions just felt their</B>
<BR><B>presence.&nbsp; There is a hotel in Coral Gables, Florida called
the Biltmore</B>
<BR><B>Hotel. Everyone had always told me it was haunted. The hotel has
gone</B>
<BR><B>through many transformations. It started off as a hotel in the roaring
20's</B>
<BR><B>with many gangsters visiting, turned into a hospital, remained as
a VA</B>
<BR><B>hospital for quite sometime, I believe it was also an asylum at
one point.</B>
<BR><B>I had always seen it from afar and got chills when I would look
at it.</B>
<BR><B>I finally decided to go in one day.&nbsp; I went with 2 friends.
We separated</B>
<BR><B>when we got into the lobby. I went straight through to the back
balcony</B>
<BR><B>which overlooks the pool.&nbsp; I was frozen in place. I felt claustrophobic
from</B>
<BR><B>all the spirits I felt around me. Pressing up against me. Hearing
what</B>
<BR><B>sounded like a party. Although there was no one around. It felt
like I was</B>
<BR><B>on a train in the New York subway system during rush hour.&nbsp;
I couldn't take</B>
<BR><B>it anymore and decided to go through a banquet hall to my right
to find my</B>
<BR><B>friends. The room was completely empty, lights turned off, chairs
on top of</B>
<BR><B>the tables.&nbsp; As I was walking to the other door to get out
of the room,</B>
<BR><B>music started.&nbsp; I ran out very quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't

<P><B>Hauntings in St Louis</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Jitterbug1103@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Not any concerns.&nbsp; I just want to relate an experience I had
several years ago, when I lived at a different location here in St. Louis,
MO.</B>
<BR><B>When I had first moved in the apartment in South St. Louis I was
single.&nbsp; One night I was sitting in bed reading (I'm a bookaholic).&nbsp;
I heard my name called by a voice that sounded male.&nbsp; There was no
one in the apartment but me.&nbsp; My neighbors upstairs worked nights
and were not home.&nbsp; I decided it was just my imagination working overtime.&nbsp;
I continued reading.&nbsp; It couldn't have been more than a few seconds
later that I heard my name being called again.&nbsp; I know it wasn't too
long after I settled back down to read as I was still on the same page.</B>
<BR><B>However, this time the voice sounded different.&nbsp; It sounded
evil.&nbsp; Now, here I'm am, a single female, by myself and scared silly.&nbsp;
What did I do?&nbsp; I crawled under the covers and started saying the
Lord's Pray and the 23 Psalms.&nbsp; I said them until I fell asleep.</B>
<BR><B>No more problem until 1991 when I got married.&nbsp; My husband
was changing the light bulb in the kitchen fixture one evening.&nbsp; He
was standing on one of the kitchen chairs.&nbsp; I must explain that the
chairs are not the tippsy type.&nbsp; The legs angle out to make the chair
more stable.</B>
<BR><B>I had taken the light cover from him to wash.&nbsp; I was standing
about five feet from him drying it when the chair was pulled out from under
him.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; The chair did not turn over.&nbsp; He was
not moving on the chair.&nbsp; The chair was PULLED out from under him.&nbsp;
By this time I had turned Catholic.&nbsp; I got the Holy Water and started
sprinkling the house.&nbsp; Things calmed down.</B>
<BR><B>Several months later I was in the living room watching TV.&nbsp;
My husband was in the kitchen on the CB radio.&nbsp; I hear a crashing
sound and he is calling me to come in there and bring the Holy Water.&nbsp;
I did.</B>
<BR><B>In the kitchen I had som melmac plates stacked on top of the cabinet
above the sink.&nbsp; There sere souvineer plate and of no real value.&nbsp;
I watched as one plated would be lifted up and sent flying across the room
like a fresbee.&nbsp; Then another and another.&nbsp; I started sprinkling
the room with Holy Water and blessing the room in the name of Jesus.&nbsp;
Everything stopped.</B>
<BR><B>The last instance happened late at night when we were in bed.&nbsp;
Only my husband&nbsp; and I lived there.&nbsp; We had an apartment size
washer and dryer in the kitchen.&nbsp; The washers wheels were in bad shape.&nbsp;
It was difficult for us to roll the washer over to the sink and when we
did, the wheels made a whole lot of noise.&nbsp; Even my husband had a
difficult time moving the washer.</B>
<BR><B>We had not been in bed very long when we heard the washer moving
across the kitchen floor or rather we heard the wheels squeeking.&nbsp;
My husband said he wasn't going in there.&nbsp; I told him I was planning
on going in there either.&nbsp; We ended up saying the Lord's Pray and
23 Psalms until we fell asleep.&nbsp; The next day I practically soaked
the kitchen with Holy Water.&nbsp; Oh, by the way, the washer had been
moved from the wall where we normally kept it when not in use and was sitting
by the sink.&nbsp; What moved it?</B>
<BR><B>That's my experience.</B>

<P><B>Gabby</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sue-allyson-doggies@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ok for anyone reading this I have stories scattered everywhere on
this site as I have so many. Well any way I have a spirit and her name
is Gabby. ( I forgot how I found out but I did) And&nbsp; I have two stories
the scariest one is when I was about 3 or 4 and I slept with a baby blanket.&nbsp;
Well anyway was sleeping with it , had it right next to me and I had my
arm over it so no one could grab it without me noticing. It was morning
and it was during breakfast when I said, "Mommy, where's my blanket?" And
she said "you slept with it right?" I nodded and got up and checked in
my room. It wasn’t there. Around 12:00 my mom was making her bed an noticed
my blanket neatly folded straight across the top of her bed and until I
was 10, a year ago, she never told me how it got there and when she did
she said to me, "honey, remember when your baby blanket ended up in my
room?" I nodded and she continued, "I didn’t put it there, and I know you
didn’t because you loved that thing so much." I nodded and said, "I know,
it was Gabby." My mom has this confused look on her face and I clarified
it by saying, "Our ghost." Well then a year later, there was this sponge
bunny rabbit thing that I hadn't played with for years, and it was sitting
upright of my dresser.&nbsp; It scared the crap out of me because the last
time I saw the sponge thing was in the garage. But now, I just laugh at
it knowing my friendly ghost did it.&nbsp; She is not mean, or anything
like that she just plays jokes and stuff. Basically she moves things. She's
cool.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:G313@howecadets.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>In Fayetteville north Carolina, of course, when I was in 3rd and
4th grade I lived in a neighborhood called whispering pines, there are
a few actually.&nbsp; This one was located off of ramsey street turn by
a citgo and there is a big field.&nbsp; The house was on east winds lane
and ive had numerous experiences there.&nbsp; All the other kids in the
neighborhood seemed to experience the same type of thngs.&nbsp; My room
was painted black for some reason when mea dn my mom moved in.&nbsp; On
a few occasions my room shook as if there ws an earthquake when my moms
room, across the hall was just,,, normal.&nbsp; My closet doors opened
while the room seemed to shake, and things fell, but not like an earthquake,
like quiet except for the hinges of the closet doors.&nbsp; One ngiht in
my moms room she was gone and we live together alone.&nbsp; I came out
of the bath and sat down with my cat watching tv on my moms bed while I
cooled off.&nbsp; So im sitting there naked and my head is turned left
watching the tv, I hear her keys jingle and I realized her purse which
was in the middle of the bed, fell over, I picked the keys up, put em’
in and put it right side up.. It happened 2 more times before I turned
my head back to the left slow enough to see it fall with out any tilting
or force.&nbsp; This is when I put it up ionly to find a hand sized object
pushing up from under it,&nbsp; fuckin unbelievable, I got that panicky
lightheadedness adrenaline rush but I didn’t believe in ghosts so I threw
the purse, it continued bobbing up and down, and I lifted all the covers
except for the tight sheet, but it was under it all it seemed, I went under
the bed and pushed all the rolly-drawer boxes out of the way and looked
up through the slats, nothing, I kicked the mattress and it was just regular,
it was there, but it wasn’t sorta, I ran outside naked holding my cat,
naked.&nbsp; My mom pulled up, and consoled me while laughing at me.&nbsp;
I never slept alone again in that house.&nbsp; I finally convinced her
to move b/c I was traumatized from the event.&nbsp; It is fairly new looking,
green shutters, 2 car garage on the right side of the lane.&nbsp; I definitely
know the place is haunted, and I believe you should check it out.&nbsp;
I drove by it once more and got an odd feeling.&nbsp; It doesn’t LOOK haunted
at all though.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Evee</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: annvath1980@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Growing up I had always felt like something was missing from me but
I wasn't sure what it was. Now, most kids or small children have imaginary
or make believe friends correct? Well I was one of those kids. Ever since
l could remember I had an imaginary friend, her name was Evee, she had
the same birthday as me as well as looking exactly like me. I told my parents
about her and they said that there was no one named Evee and to go out
and make some real friends. When ever I would talk about her my parents
would try to hush me and make me stop talking about it. It seemed really
weird for when my real friends told there parents about there 'friends'
there parents would play along acting like someone was really there where
as mine acted like I was crazy, which was really hard for a four year old
to understand at the time. On the day of my eight birthday Evee told me
that she had to go away for a little while but she would be back and not
to worry.</B>
<BR><B>Years passed, I got older, and soon Evee was forgotten, and yet
I still felt as if something was to be missing from me. The day of my 16th
birthday I awoke to find Evee sitting at my vanity, she had grown and looked
just like me only with long brown hair that seemed as if it were never
cut, and she wore a white floor length gown. At first I tried to run out
of the room but when my hand hit the knob it was icy cold and made me jump
back in shock, (It was August 3 and 101 degrees out that morning). Evee
then spoke to me. She told me that she had been watching over me during
all those years and seen my greatest accomplishments and when there were
sad times and I needed someone she was always right next to me. Then she
told me something that made me uneasy. She told me she knew what was missing
and to go ask my parents, and if they would not tell me then to walk two
blocks down the road, turn at the next right, make a left from there, walk
down two blocks, and what I needed to find was off to the right.</B>
<BR><B>I asked my parents and they told me to stop being silly and to go
get ready that guest for my sweet 16 would be arriving soon. I walked back
into my room and Evee stood there, she looked at me smiled and told me
I had to go and to look for the willow. Quickly I threw on my shoes and
in my lacy little tank top and underwear I ran out the front door. When
I came to where Evee told me to go my heart stopped....A cemetery....and
off to the far left corner stood a willow. I walked to the back and pushed
the long branches out of the way and there it was, a little tomb stone.
Kneeling down I read it.</B>
<BR><B>August 3, 1980 - August 5, 1980</B>
<BR><B>Beloved Daughter and Sister</B>
<BR><B>May her young soul rest in peace</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Reading the words it was almost unbearable for me to think
of. For 16 years something was missing from me, and now I knew what, my
twin sister, someone I shared my soul with was gone. Tears streamed down
my cheeks and I looked at the fresh flowers laid over the grave. Tiger
lily's, my favorite and then something caught my eye. A small half a heart
pressed into the stone of the tomb. My hand flew to my neck and I yanked
at the thin gold chain which held the other half of the heart. I pressed
it into the stone, and felt a strange happiness over come me and for the
first time in years, I felt whole again. I got up, smiled, and whispered
I love you. Turning to leave a small breeze blew and I knew she was there
with me. When I returned home my parents explained. Evee, my sister older
then me by two minutes had passed away from pneumonia when she was two
days old, she had it when she was born, and the doctors found it extremely
odd that I had not even the slightest trace of it.&nbsp; After a long talk
I went into my room to get ready for my party. Evee was there with me,
although I could not see her, I knew she was right by my side looking after
her little sister like she did for those sixteen years, and those nine
months that we shared our only real time together. Later on that night
while everyone was at the party, friends, family, everyone, my parents
got up and told the truth, as I sat there next to my three other sisters
and my four brothers, I felt Evee leave. I knew she would no longer be
with me, but she would now be watching over me in heaven.</B>

<BR><B>Encounter with a past life</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: VVvEnigmavVv@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>I know that this website is all about acceptance and such of people's
ghost stories and such, but what I'm about to relate is very, very hard
to believe.&nbsp; To this very day I'm not sure that I believe it myself.&nbsp;
While staying at a motel off some dirt road in Missouri, I encountered
the ghost of myself in a past life.&nbsp; It was about 2 in the afternoon
and I was watching t.v. when I heard a very strange sound unlike any sound
i'd ever heard before coming from the bathroom.&nbsp; Upon entering the
bathroom, I found nothing, however as I was turning to leave I caught my
reflection in the mirror, only it wasn't me.&nbsp; It had a very uncanny
resemblence to me, but it was definately not me.&nbsp; It's very hard to
describe, but the best way I can put it is that I could see myself (my
real reflection) yet, over my reflection was another, translucent reflection
that I could see almost as perfectly as my reflection in any other mirror.&nbsp;
So it was as though this reflection and my own were in the exact same space
as eachother, yet I could discern them both from eachother.&nbsp; I stared
in a terrified amazement at this "other" reflection.&nbsp; It looked very
much like me, only it was just a bit taller and had a beard.&nbsp; It was
wearing a blue, colonial army uniform and as I stared at it I felt extremely
cold.&nbsp; Gazing to this reflection, I somehow "knew" that it was myself
that I was looking at, that this was the ghost of myself from a past life.&nbsp;
After about 3 minutes of just staring at it I heard what sounded like a
very faint gunshot and it felt like a small rock hit me in the chest.&nbsp;
I stumbled back, not expecting something like that to happen and the reflection
vanished, leaving my normal reflection.&nbsp; My only guess is that, in
a past life, I served in the Union army in either the Revolutionary or
Civil War, and was shot in the chest in a skirmish or battle that must
have taken place near the motel.</B><B></B>

ago.I had meet a new kid in the neighborhood and we became very close,always
hanging out and all.That first year nothing really happened over at his
house,but that ended up changing.</B>
<BR><B>It started up all of a sudden.The first incident I wasn't their
for but my friend has no reason to lie plus his dad verified it too.They
were watching a movie and all of a sudden the pictures in the hallway flew
and hit the opposite wall with a load bang,they just shrugged it off.Then
I started experiencing thing over there too.Their would be a load bang
in the back room but when we would check nothing would be wrong.Then the
smoke detectors started going off all the time for no reason,first it was
the one near the door,it would go off at least 10 times a day so after
a week Alfred(my friends dad)unplugged it and this next part still makes
the hair stand up on the back of my neck,the second one started going off
and we finally had to unplug that one too.</B>
<BR><B>Things went quiet for a couple of months and then one night we were
watching TV and the microwave just came on by itsself.We messed around
with it for about a minute and it just shutoff by itsself.I can't forget
about the footsteps,we only heard them twice but ill never forget it.My
friend and I were in the back yard and no one was in the house,it was getting
dark and we were whating for my friends parents to get home.I heard a noise
and looked at the house the same time my friend heard it.It sounded like
THUMP THUMP THUMP from were his parents room is through the kitchen,across
the living room and into the back hallway,we thought hi parent got home
and we didn't notice so we went and opened up the door,well to our surprise
their wasn't anybody there.The second time we heard them we were in his
room tal ng when we heard them again walking through the house(actually
it was a single wide trailer so it amplified footsteps pretty well )and
once again we went and checked and their was no one there.NOTE:(I want
you too bear in mind that he didn't own any pets and the footsteps were
pretty load,it sounded like his dad walking who weighed about 250 lb.)</B>
<BR><B>The last incident was up close and personnel and I don't think Ill
ever forget it.It was dark and my friend had to drive to the store so I
told&nbsp; him I'd watch his little brother and sister because they were
in bed.He pulled out of the drive way and I stepped in and closed the door
and you know what the first thing that pops in my head is?all the weird
stuff thats happened in there.So I'm standing there in the living room
and you can see right into his parents room and all of a sudden the closet
door open by its self,I just stared as the door slowly opened,man I was
like S@#$.I just stood in the living room just staring at the closet door,I
wasn't going to walk over their too see up close,and I really don't freighten
easy but that got my blood pumping.When my friend got home we went and
checked it out and tested the door,their was no windows open so their wasn't
a draft and I rolled a ball in the kitchen and found out the hose tilted
a little bit IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.We messed with and came to the conclusion
that it couldn't open by itself even with a draft so who knows.All the
things I've said are true and I swear on my whole family and god its true.I
don't know if it was a ghost but that was a spooky trailer and it was brand
new.I think it was the land and after they moved out some new people moved
out that trailer and put a double wide on the land.I've been think of going
and asking them if they've had any strange experiences there.But I wanted
to are that and everyone take care.</B><B></B>

<P><B>About 10 years ago,when I was 24 years old,after only</B>
<BR><B>2 years of marriage,my husband was killed in an accident involvinng
a train.I was very hurt and angry at him for leaving me all alone in this
world,and I kind of was angry for not having the chance of saying goodbye.</B>
<BR><B>One night,about a week after the accident,as I was laying in bed
crying,I felt that I was not alone in my room.Suddenly it felt as of somebody
was sitting down on my bed and I felt a light touch on my cheek.My husband
always touched me on my cheek whenn he use to say goodbye and went to work.At
that moment,I was not angry nomore and The lonely feeling,and the pain
in my heart where gone.I knew that he was here to say goodbye and that
no matter where I was in this world,he would always watch over me.I miss
you Ricky.</B>

<P><B>I moved into an old villa three years ago with my partner.&nbsp;
It was set on 30 hectars which was great as I have horses.</B>
<BR><B>When we went to look at the house the landlord didnt come with us
instead he left the key in the mail box.&nbsp; I didnt think anything of
it at the time.&nbsp; We feel in love with the house and moved in a week
later.</B>
<BR><B>After we had lived there for a few days the landlords ex wife arrived
and told me that I needed to get the house blessed becouse it was haunted
and horrible things happen here.</B>
<BR><B>In the short time that I had lived there nothing strange had happened
so I brushed it off and thourght nothing of it until that weekend.</B>
<BR><B>My partner and I were out side feeding calves and had left our three
dogs (chihuahua's) in the house.&nbsp; After about ten minuets the dogs
were out side with us.&nbsp; I thourght nothing until it happened a third
time in the hour and I knew nothing was left open and there was no way
the dogs were big enough to jump through the only open window in the lounge.</B>
<BR><B>After a few days doors in the house would open by them selves and
then shut gently.&nbsp; Curtins would open and close by them selves and
things would often get lost only to be found again in the strangest places.</B>
<BR><B>The lights in the hall way would turn off two seconds after I turned
them on .</B>
<BR><B>The dogs refused to go down the hall at all and would cry if I did.</B>
<BR><B>There was a story that a little girl was killed at the house before
her father shot himself in the barn.&nbsp; Both the house and barn still
stand today.</B>
<BR><B>I didnt belive in any thing like this until it happened to me.</B>
<BR><B>I lived there just over a year and loved it.</B>
<BR><B>Visiters refused to stay the night so it got pretty lonley at times
but I had my ghost freind to keep me company.</B>
<BR><B>This took place in Waingaro Springs 30 minuets west of Huntly, Waikato,
New Zealand</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;My Father-in-Law</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sabrinar@sasktel.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>This story isn't my experience, it happened to my best friend (the</B>
<BR><B>mother of my step daughter). My husband's father died a little better</B>
<BR><B>than a year before my step daughter was born. My best friend didn't
know</B>
<BR><B>yet but she was pregnant. One night she woke up because she could
feel</B>
<BR><B>someone watching her, it was my father in law. He was sitting on
the</B>
<BR><B>foot of their bed. She tried to wake up my husband, but he's a heavy</B>
<BR><B>sleeper. She thought she was dreaming so she pulled the covers over
her</B>
<BR><B>face and waited a minute. When she pulled them down my father in
law was</B>
<BR><B>standing at the end of the bed staring at her. She's not easily
scared</B>
<BR><B>because things like this have happend to her before so she asked
him</B>
<BR><B>what he wanted. He just smiled at her and disapeared. A couple weeks</B>
<BR><B>later she found out she was going to have a baby!!!</B>
<BR><B>To continue this storie I met my husband when his daughter was three.</B>
<BR><B>She was an only child then and was very good at amusing herself.
One day</B>
<BR><B>I heard her talking to someone, an imaginary friend, no biggy. When
I</B>
<BR><B>asked her who she was talking to she said the man. I told my friend</B>
<BR><B>about this and she told me that she got the same answer. To this
day we</B>
<BR><B>both think that it was my father in law playing with his granddaughter.</B>
<BR><B>She doesn't see him anymore but it is very comforting to know he's</B>
<BR><B>watching because I just had a son.</B>

<BR><B>Spooky College House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pjs268@psu.edu</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am a 20 year old Junior at Behrend College, a division of Penn
State</B>
<BR><B>University, in Erie, PA.&nbsp; I transfered from another college,
so I was placed on</B>
<BR><B>the waiting list for the dorms and forced to rent.&nbsp; I found
a place a few miles</B>
<BR><B>from campus that was nice and clean, but very old.&nbsp; The first
night I stayed</B>
<BR><B>there, only one of my roommates had arrived.&nbsp; His bedroom is
the entire 4th</B>
<BR><B>floor attic, while mine was on the 3rd floor (our landlord lives
on the first 2</B>
<BR><B>floors).&nbsp; It was very hot that night.&nbsp; That plus the fact
that I was in strange</B>
<BR><B>surroundings, I could not sleep.&nbsp; Around 1:00 am, I heard my
roommate come down</B>
<BR><B>to my floor and move around in the kitchen . . . making noises as
if he was</B>
<BR><B>cooking.&nbsp; I could specifically hear kitchen drawers and cabinets
opening and</B>
<BR><B>closing, and the sound of silverwear and glasses clinking together.&nbsp;
I figured</B>
<BR><B>that I might as well get up and talk to him since i couldn't sleep
either and I</B>
<BR><B>didn't really know the guy very well at that time.&nbsp; So I got
up out of bed, and</B>
<BR><B>when I opened my door, the noises stopped and the rest of the house
was pitch</B>
<BR><B>black with not one light on.&nbsp; I still went into the kitchen,
but nobody was</B>
<BR><B>here.&nbsp; The door to his steps was shut and there was no light
coming from around</B>
<BR><B>it.&nbsp; I thought "well thats strange" and went back to bed.</B>
<BR><B>AS SOON as i shut the door to my room, I heard the noises again.&nbsp;
I layed back</B>
<BR><B>down in bed, but could not sleep because of the noise.&nbsp; Now
I was freaked out.</B>
<BR><B>I got up again, looked out, and nobody was there, the house was
dark.&nbsp; I closed</B>
<BR><B>the door, went back in bed, and the noises started up again.&nbsp;
This went on till</B>
<BR><B>about 4:00 in the morning and I could not sleep because of the noise.&nbsp;
Finally</B>
<BR><B>it stopped at almost exactly 4:00 am.&nbsp; The next night, my other
roommate had</B>
<BR><B>arrived.&nbsp; His room is on the same floor as mine.&nbsp; I heard
the noises start up</B>
<BR><B>again around 1:00 am and again nobody was up, the house was dark.&nbsp;
Again the</B>
<BR><B>noises kept me up till 4:00 am.&nbsp; I asked the roommate on my
floor if he had</B>
<BR><B>heard anything, but he said all he heard was his door opening and
closing and</B>
<BR><B>assumed it was the wind.&nbsp; I decided to get a fan which effectively
drowned out</B>
<BR><B>the noise.</B>
<BR><B>About a week later, my roommates both went home for the weekend.&nbsp;
I heard the</B>
<BR><B>noises again, this time over the fan I had bought.&nbsp; Now they
sounded as if they</B>
<BR><B>were IN my room.&nbsp; I layed in bed, scared to death, until I
finally got up,</B>
<BR><B>turned on all my lights and said "Shut the @#%&amp; up I'm trying
to sleep!"&nbsp; and</B>
<BR><B>it stopped.&nbsp; the next night I was home alone again, so before
I went to bed, I</B>
<BR><B>said out loud "I don't care who you are or what you're doing here,
but I do not</B>
<BR><B>want to see you, hear you, or even know you are here in any way,
so keep the</B>
<BR><B>hell away from me."&nbsp; I felt REALLY FREAKED OUT while I was
saying this and felt</B>
<BR><B>serious chills.&nbsp; Nothing happened after that.</B>
<BR><B>Nothing happened until a few days ago.&nbsp; i was watching The
Wedding Singer on TBS</B>
<BR><B>around 9:00 pm when something caught my attention.&nbsp; I looked
up to see a hazy</B>
<BR><B>misty figure standing in the doorway to my living room.&nbsp; It
looked like the</B>
<BR><B>heat waves coming off a grill in the summer, like that wavy type
distortion of</B>
<BR><B>the air or whatever.&nbsp; I wasn't scared, just like "what the
hell?"&nbsp; I watched it</B>
<BR><B>for a few seconds as it moved out of the door way and out of sight.</B>
<BR><B>Thats all that has happened so far.&nbsp; I definately know I'm
not imagining this.</B>
<BR><B>My roommates don't seem to believe me.&nbsp; I always have a knack
for attracting</B>
<BR><B>this sort of thing.&nbsp; I think its because I just freak myself
out.</B>

<P><B>We Call Him George!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cekite@adams.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>My husband and I live in an older modular, I'd say 60's model in
the country that we have worked hard to update. Since day one, we have
both had very odd experiences. Although, I will say we have yet to SEE
a ghost.</B>
<BR><B>I work midnights alot, so I'm used to the creaking of the floors,
that really sound like someone walking down the hall. I try to rationalize
everything:)</B>
<BR><B>My first experience, was when I woke up and heard my husband home
early one day (at least I assumed it was him). I was so tired that I didn't
even open my eyes. I felt him lay down next to me and back to sleep I went.
I just figured he came home sick or something. When I awoke in the afternoon,
NO ONE was there. And my husband had been at work all day. Then my husband
went on to tell me that the original owner had died in the house and in
our bedroom.</B>
<BR><B>Since then, he has had more experiences than I. He wakes up and
hears the kids turn on the bathroom light. So he gets up to check on them
and they are both in the their rooms sound asleep. So he shuts the light
out and goes back to bed. Then while he was still awake, he hears the light
turn back on. (You can see it in the hallway) So he jumps up to punish
the kids for getting up over and over and no one is awake. They are both
still in bed in the same position as before. Then one night, my husband
was sound asleep (we have a waterbed) and he was startled by someone running
over the bed. He said the bed was still moving while he was trying to think
about what had just happened.</B>
<BR><B>But a couple of weeks ago, my husband went to California on business
and my kids went to stay with a sitter. As I said before I rationalize
everything! Well, I had turned on the laundry room light so that when I
returned from dropping the kids off I wouldn't be in total darkness. I
know I was the last one out the door. But when I returned the light was
not on. I tried to tell myself that one of the kids just turned it off
is all. So I switched it back on so that I would have light after my short
nap before work.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I also made sure all doors were locked.&nbsp;
I slept only and hour because the footstep sounds kept me awake. And when
I got up and opened my bedroom door I was SOO freaked out! The light was
off again! Then I told myself, well maybe it's burned out, so I went to
check it and the switch was literally turned OFF. Explain that, because
no one was here and no one could get in!&nbsp; That's my story for now.
I'm sure it's not over.</B>

<BR><B>The Meeting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mmurray@rscj.org</B><B></B>

<P><B>This account happened when I was in my early teens. My best girlfriend
at</B>
<BR><B>the time was spending the weekend at my home in a rural part of
Missouri.</B>
<BR><B>She and I were in the front yard that early afternoon when we heard
my</B>
<BR><B>alarm clock going off inside the house.&nbsp; Odd, because we had
not set it. We</B>
<BR><B>went in the house, turned it off and returned to the yard outside.</B>
<BR><B>While we were gabbing (as only teenage girls can do), a pickup truck
and</B>
<BR><B>car pulled up alongside one another on the road in front of our
yard. They</B>
<BR><B>seemed to be talking back and forth between the two vehicles.</B>
<BR><B>My friend and I recognized most of the boys in the vehicles as they
were</B>
<BR><B>Seniors at our High School. We, as Freshman girls,had the worst
of crushes</B>
<BR><B>on some of these upper-classmen who most likely did not even know
our names</B>
<BR><B>at the time.&nbsp; Needless to say we were quite excited....we attempted
to get</B>
<BR><B>their attention by calling out the name of the driver in the pickup
- but</B>
<BR><B>he didn't seem to hear us or acknowledge us. About that time, a
motorcycle</B>
<BR><B>came down the road and so the truck and car had to move. The truck
backed</B>
<BR><B>into our driveway to turn around and the motorcycle, car and truck
all then</B>
<BR><B>headed down the country road.</B>
<BR><B>Most of the guys out of the 6 (3 were in the car, 3 were in the
truck). we</B>
<BR><B>recognized and knew their names.</B>
<BR><B>We bragged to our friends about seeing them when we returned to
school</B>
<BR><B>following that weekend...</B>
<BR><B>However, as it turned out - that past weekend in the early afternoon,
a</B>
<BR><B>funeral had taken place for a guy that had graduated from our high
school a</B>
<BR><B>year prior.....the guy had been killed riding his motorcycle.&nbsp;
The 6 guys</B>
<BR><B>whom we had seen in the truck and the car had consequently been
the</B>
<BR><B>pall-bearers at his funeral.</B>
<BR><B>The funeral would have taken place near the time that my alarm had
gone off.</B>
<BR><B>Later, I began dating one of the guys we thought we saw that day...and
he</B>
<BR><B>had no recollection of ever being on the road that led by my house-ever.</B>
<BR><B>My girlfriend and I got together once after graduation - almost
10 years</B>
<BR><B>had passed since that occasion, - I asked her "Do you remember.....?--she</B>
<BR><B>just said "yes"- and by the look in both of our eyes, we just left
it at</B>
<BR><B>that.&nbsp; It seemed all we needed 10 years after that event, was
just</B>
<BR><B>re-confirmation that it had actually happened. -And it did. (we
both</B>
<BR><B>remembered)</B>
<BR><B>I can't explain it.&nbsp; I can't even try to understand why......
Just all</B>
<BR><B>seemed like a normal day (at the time). Outside of the fact that
we did get</B>
<BR><B>a little freaked out over the alarm clock.&nbsp; Later, we realized
by checking</B>
<BR><B>with the local paper when the obituary and funeral write-up came</B>
<BR><B>out.........that it would have been physically impossible for those
guys</B>
<BR><B>(and maybe even the motorcycle rider?) to have been two places several</B>
<BR><B>miles apart at the same time.</B><B></B>

<P><B>It was about 11pm when I woke up. My mom was asleep on the couch
after watching murder cases. All of a sudden there was a older woman with
a really white face who&nbsp; walked over to me and sat on the couch. It
looked as if she were crying for a long time, because her hair was knatty
and her eyes had the 'crying' look in them. She reached out her arms to
me as if she was asking for a hug. Then she started to get a worried look
on her face and kept looking back to my stairs. (I was in my basement.)</B>
<BR><B>Then she touched my face and it was so cold I screamed but my mom
didnt wake up. Then the lady stood up and ran up my stairs. I never saw
her again.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Someone Watching Over Me</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: AngelRaven20613@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was younger (much younger) I had an imaginary friend (So my
Mother told me)&nbsp; My Mom told me I would sit for hours in my playroom
carrying on full conversations with someone or something.&nbsp; It was
only after my Mom told me this years later that I remembered my special
friend.&nbsp; Let me stop for a second and tell you before I go on that
I have always loved the Military Branch of the Marine Corps.&nbsp; I wont
say that this particular friend was harmful, he and yes I said he was as
I would call my guardian angel.&nbsp;&nbsp; The night after my Mom told
me about my days talking to someone she couldnt see I sat for hours going
back and remembering my special friend "BobbyE"&nbsp; He was a very handsome
soul, very kind and always smiled at me.&nbsp; I remember it clearly as
if it happened yesterday.&nbsp; He wore a uniform which I connect as Marine
Corps now.&nbsp; As I got older things happened to me I have no explanation
for.&nbsp; I would be able to hear things, see things or feel different
during different times.&nbsp; Im not saying Im special, but I do know that
people are able to do that.&nbsp; Growing up in a Roman Catholic Family(My
Mom was not catholic, my Fathers family was and I was raised to be Catholic)...I
was never to mention I saw a ghost or anything like that...It was not tolerated
in my family.&nbsp; I didnt want people labeling me as "crazy" or "nutty"
so I just let it be.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got older I noticed being able
to detect negative energies, to which the hair on my neck would stand up
and I would get really cold to where I shivered.&nbsp; Even if it was 90
degrees outside it would happen.&nbsp; Doors would slam in my home scaring
the witts outta me.&nbsp; Other times things would fly off a bookshelf
and even one time my fish tank itself exploded into a millon pieces with
glass all over the floor.&nbsp; I know this wasnt my "BobbyE" but the souls
of someone or more than one.&nbsp; There were nasty spirits with their
attitudes for the mean things they did to scare me.&nbsp; I was what you
would call a "Book Worm" and I began reading about the history of the land
my home was on.&nbsp; After reading it all made sense to why things were
going on that were happening.&nbsp; My Home was built on Indian Territory.&nbsp;
If anyone is a History buff and American Indian history check out the Piscataway
Indians.&nbsp; My Home was built right on land that they resided on many
years ago.&nbsp; However it seems no matter where I lived I always attracted
the Paranormal activity around me.&nbsp; I have many other stories about
things that I have witnessed, but they are for another time.&nbsp; I am
going to finish about "BobbyE"&nbsp; It seems no matter where I am now,
I am always calmed by a warm feeling when things start going weird around
me.&nbsp; Like I said I am a research buff and I began doing research about
a POW/MIA that I have a bracelet for that I have had for many years.&nbsp;
Upon researching for this particular individual I came across a name on
the Vietnam Wall...Robert E. I sat there and tears started rolling down
my face, but I had a warm feeling about it...I felt sadness as I stared
at the name...Complete sadness, but in an instant I felt as if someone
were looking at the back of my head&nbsp; (Let me back up for a sec) I
was on my home computer looking thru the Vietnam Wall on the Internet and
I was home alone.&nbsp; I clicked on the information for Robert E. and
noticed that his date of his death in Vietnam was identical to my birth
date 08/09/70.&nbsp; I flew out to 29 Palms California to stay with my
then Boyfriend who was a Sgt in the Marine Corps.&nbsp; He had to leave
one night to go pick up his intoxicated room mate.&nbsp; I was alone in
the house that they rented and I felt the covers on my leg come off and
I felt the mattress go down as if someone was sitting on it.&nbsp; At first
I was frightened because I knew I was the only one in the house while "Mike"
went to go pick up his roomate.&nbsp; I laid there and then again felt
the warmth come over me I then heard the words as if someone was in the
room with me "He isnt truthful" I heard the same thing repeated to me several
times before the mattress when back to normal as if the spirit got up.&nbsp;
I found out several days later after I got home from a mutual friend that
"Mike" had been cheating on me the whole time we were dating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I often wonder if this was the spirit of my "BobbyE" that looked over me
as a child and protected me during some rough times and now he is still
looking out for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sometimes wonder if somehow as
I was being brought into this world and he was leaving somehow we passed
by one another...Im not sure, but if someone has an explaination I would
love to hear it.&nbsp; Even though I am 33 now, I still keep "BobbyE" in
my mind and in my heart for he truly did look out for me even if majority
of my family dont believe it now...Who cares?&nbsp; I feel as though I
have a special person watching over me.&nbsp; Thanks for letting me share
this, even though it isnt scary like most of what I have read on this site.&nbsp;
By the way this is a great site and I love reading all the stories people
send in.&nbsp; I will post more experiences later on.....</B>

<BR><B>Together for Eternity</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Crouching_Tiger_Hidden_Kou@MSN.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hey. My names Nik and I'm a 16 year old girl; Junior Class art major.
The incident I’m about to tell you happened a few years ago. It was in
our old apartment on Hwy. 80 west. My mom had always been the paranormal,
superstitious figure. She’d wake up in the middle of the night with dreams
of her relatives in bad situations only to have them call but a few minutes
later. She sees things and gets bad feeling associated with them. Well,
I think her somewhat of a 6th sense had brushed off on me. I too get strange
dreams of events and such only to see them happen a few days later. But
anyway, onto my chronicle.</B>
<BR><B>As I’ve stated, this happened in our old apartment. We lived in
apartment 805 in Wyndmere on Hwy. 80 west. It was the top apartment and
at the time, a couple lived underneath us. A week or two later, the couple
underneath us had to move due to military issues. So, the lower apartment
was vacant for a few months. After I think the 4 month had passed since
the military couple, three SCAD students rented out the apartment. SCAD
stands for Savannah College of Art and Design just so you know. These three
were visual art majors too.</B>
<BR><B>Two of the three were together. While the third one was usually
busy and came home late into the night. My mom and I often talked to the
couple. They were nice young people I’m guessing maybe early 20’s. The
boy had straight brown hair tied back in a pony tail and the girl had somewhat
frizzy hair but was well kept. They said they were getting engaged and
planned to move very soon. Well, I can tell you now, that that did not
happen.</B>
<BR><B>The day after the last time we spoke to the couple, the third roomy
rushed in and out of the apartment constantly. An elderly couple came buy
as well as Ryder, taking out all of the things in the apartment. My mom
and I had went down stairs to talk to the elderly couple. They were the
parents of the girl who lived in the apartment. The mother told us that
last night, the couple had been driving along a highway, only to collide
unexpectedly into a truck that was on the wrong side of the road. Apparently,
there were no survivors and both died of broken necks.</B>
<BR><B>After that was when the happenings began. The third room in our
apartment was just a play-room which, underneath, was the room of that
couple. In the room, it’d be cold and the electricity wouldn’t work. Also,
when we’d leave and return, the TV in that room would be on. Even if it
wasn’t plugged in. My mom also mentioned when she was up late one night,
she saw the boy’s head floating along the hallway then disappear. I had
seen the girls face in the static of the TV in the room that was always
cold.&nbsp; My mom said they meant no harm.</B>
<BR><B>After we caught word that the two lovers had been buried together
at the city where they planned to wed, the happenings stopped. Possibly
they had been put to rest in the city where they planned to be together
for eternity...</B>

<P><B>Not Happy</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: green_eyedmama_84@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I believe in ghost and I have always love true ghosts stories. my
boyfriend on the other hand thinks I am stupid. I work at Taco Bell and
so my manager hired this girl named Britt. B. I soon found out that she
lived in the apartment complex as I did. So she and I became good friends
because she just moved to town with her boyfriend. Well she told me that
she is in contact with ghost all the time. She says that sometimes she
cant tell if they are human or not and often makes a fool of her self.
Well me being very interested, I ask her to do a siance with me. We lit
candles and she said to just wait because she already seen ghost near me
since she first met me. well we were just talking and she stopped and said
that there was a woman sitting across us on the floor on the other side
of the coffee table. she didn't give me a description of what she looked
like or what she was doing. She just told me that she was looking at me.
well Britt left to go to the bathroom and I didn't like it one bit but
I didn't say anything. I looked to where she said the woman was sitting
and my eyes started to water and it wouldn't stop so I turned away. Britt
cam back to sit down and she goes Whoa what the hell...and soon after that
she told the ghost that she wasn't welcome here and the ghost woman left.
Britt turned to me and said "that wasn't a happy ghost" she told me that
as soon a she sat down the ghost woman looked at her and her eyes started
to water really bad. I didn't tell her about that happing to me I just
acted like nothing happen. but now I know that ghost follow me around it's
just a sense of not being alone. but my boyfriend thinks I am trying to
g attention to my self. who knows</B>

<BR><B>Rispin Mansion</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: BrettJEstes@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
9-28-03</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Armed with flashlights
and cameras, three of us went in with a</B>
<BR><B>mission: to get inside Rispin Mansion in search of ghosts. Among
us was a scottish</B>
<BR><B>druid(and also a "sensitive" named Chris, longtime colleague Justin,
and me:</B>
<BR><B>Alex.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we walked along the path to the mansion, right
away we detected</B>
<BR><B>activity. First, we heard what sounded like children giggling torwards
the back of</B>
<BR><B>the house, then we heard what sounded like window shutters slamming.
Once we</B>
<BR><B>were down at the front of the house, Chris began a druid prayer
with Chris</B>
<BR><B>directing Justin and I when and where to take pictures. Almost immedietly,
we felt</B>
<BR><B>we were being watched and heard footsteps.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rispin mansion has a outdoor concrete staircase
leading around the</B>
<BR><B>left side of the house that swings around and leads to the back
of the mansion.</B>
<BR><B>So, down this stair case we went in such darkness we had to break
out our</B>
<BR><B>flashlights(a bummer when trying to operate in stealth). We swung
around to the</B>
<BR><B>back and up the padio stair case we went. This padio has the remains
of a old</B>
<BR><B>holy fountain dating back to the 1930s and a altar which was probably
at one</B>
<BR><B>time used for catholic ceremonies when it was a convent(it is also
rumored</B>
<BR><B>nowadays to be the basis of satanic rituals and be the scene of
a brutal murder).</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once we were at the thge padio, Chris immedietly
told us to point our</B>
<BR><B>cameras to two upstairs windows, warning one of us not to use a
flash. We took</B>
<BR><B>the pictures and Chris went into a meditative-like prayer state,
leaving Justin</B>
<BR><B>and I to sit and wait. Almost immedietly we felt we were surrounded.
I saw a</B>
<BR><B>flash of light, and we heard footsteps all around. Then almost in
sync, Justin</B>
<BR><B>and I got the impression someone or some thing DEFINETLY did not
want us</B>
<BR><B>there. Justin whispered to me that he did not want to go inside
because he felt</B>
<BR><B>something didn't want us to go inside. I agreed.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Chris stopped praying and ordered Justin and I to take
pictures of the</B>
<BR><B>stairs that lead up to the padio(the way we came). Justin removed
a fresh new</B>
<BR><B>camera from it's package without the flash turned on yet when he
snapped a</B>
<BR><B>picture the flash went off. Chris then invited us to join him in
a druid prayer and</B>
<BR><B>while this was occuring I began to feel a icy breeze right on my
face. It felt</B>
<BR><B>as if it was coming from very close yet I couldn't pinpoint where
it was</B>
<BR><B>coming from. Then it intensified: I felt someone touching my face
and shirt(Justin</B>
<BR><B>later said he felt the same thing).I got the impression that one
of the</B>
<BR><B>spirits was of that was a young nun in ages 20s-early 30s(a photo
taken a month</B>
<BR><B>before showed the figure of a nun!). Anyway, we continued to feel
movement all</B>
<BR><B>around and finally Chris had us out of the prayer and asking if
we were ready to</B>
<BR><B>go and we all thought it was best if we left IMMEDIETLY.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later after we left the mansion, Chris told us
he got the impression of a</B>
<BR><B>young nun in her 20s, when in fact I had not told him of what I
felt. Now,</B>
<BR><B>usually, out of the whole group, I'm the enthusiastic "let's go
get 'em!" type</B>
<BR><B>of a guy who doesn't get scared easily but after last night, you'll
never find</B>
<BR><B>me there at night alone, even if my life depends on it!</B>

<P><B>Still Have Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: daughter_judy_05@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have several ghost experiences and feel that I am sensitive to
paranormal activities.</B>
<BR><B>I had my first paranormal experience when I was six. I was in my
basement before my birthday party and looking at an old civil war book,
and I heard a very deep laugh. I ran upstairs at the speed of light, and
no one had been laughing. My parents had in fact been arguing.</B>
<BR><B>When my family moved to West Virginia, we bought this beautiful
log cabin surrounded by 52 acres of woods dirt cheap. Everyone called the
house "The Murder House" because of the murder/suicide that took place
there. A husband killed his wife and then himself. My bedroom was there
old bedroom. One summer, I was staying up late reading. And, out of nowhere,
I hear footsteps walk up to my door. I thought that it was my sister, who
had a tendency to sleepwalk. So, without looking up, I said, "What do you
need Sarah?" and I got no reply. So, I looked up at my door and no one
was there. I thought that I was hallucinating. So, I went beck to my reading.
I then heard the footsteps come into my room. I was so scared that i hid
my face in my book and turned off the light. I then heard all the stuff
being slammed off of my dresser. I looked up, and nothing had fallen.</B>
<BR><B>We have this brown rocking chair in our house now, and when we still
lived in our house in WV, it used to be in our loft. One afternoon, my
mom was working, and my sister and I were downstairs waiting for her to
come out of her office(she worked from home) so that we could meet my dad
for dinner. Well, it was storming, so we had all of the windows closed,
and our dogs were afraid of storms, so they were curled up with us on the
couch. All of a sudden my sister and I hear this strange creaking sound.
We both look up towards the loft rail and see that rocking chair rocking
back and forth by itself.</B>
<BR><B>When my parents divorced, my mom, sister and I moved back up to
Toledo. Now, in our house, we still have strange happenings. Our phone
will turn on by itself, or the computer will boot up or dial the internet
(before we got DSL) by itself. One day, I had my friend over, and we were
screwing around with my electric organ, and my sister was on the computer.
All of a sudden, my picture frame slammed down on the table hard enough
to shatter the glass. We even heard shattering glass. When we picked up
the frame, it was all in tact.</B>
<BR><B>Last Saturday night, my sister had a friend over, and I was in my
room. I fell asleep, and I woke up with a start. It sounded like my door
had slammed shut. I have my Homecoming Dress hanging up on my closet door.
I looked up and saw someone standing in front of my Homecoming Dress. I
said, "Come on, I know you`re there, I can see you." I thought it was my
mom, because the figure was of her same height and stature. I looked away
for a second, and it was gone. Since then, I cannot find a sleep mask that
I use to block out light.</B>
<BR><B>My mom woke up this morning, and let our dog out. She was still
tired, so she reset her alarm and went back to sleep. After about a half
an hour, she woke back up because she heard music. She walked out into
our living room, and our boombox was on playing the first track in a new
CD that my sister had bought.</B>
<BR><B>I still continue to have strange paranormal experiences even tonight.
It is like I said, I am sensitive. Even at friends houses I sense it.</B>

<P><B>THE GHOST TRAIN</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:trainriderofthemeadow@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Once upon a time lived a very happy family , they lived in North
Carolina but we will not tell you where, just in case the person who lives
there ever reads this. Anyway, about 40 years ago, this house was made.
The people who lived there, Lets just call them the Burdocks, had this
house made and moved in. The man of the house was a train driver. In fact,
one of the train stops to the train he drove, stopped right behind their
house. This one, was the most commonly used train stop. Anyway, one night
when the man was out driving that very train, it was Halloween, October
31st 1961. It was packed to the overflowing with people. There was a little
less than 1,000(it was a huge train for back then) people. So, they were
almost there, they were slowing down and about to stop, going trough the
path in the woods behind these peoples house (very overgrown now), when
a woman carrying a baby appeared in front of the train. The train came
to an abrupt stop while rain poured outside its windows. Mr. Burdock couldn
t e the woman or the baby anywhere, so he stepped outside of the train
to look for them. Mr. Burdock was no more. The train started again and
people thinking that it was Mr. Burdock driving the train thought nothing
of it, until they passed their stop and doubled back into the woods. "What
is this?" they thought as the train stopped at the very place they had
been before. "What are we doing?" they asked eachother. Suddenly, the train
door swung open. Each compartment door swung open in turn. A sudden flash
of lightning illuminated the man who got on the train. The passengers screamed
for the man was carrying an axe above a bloody head. The doors shut, and
the man disappeared, and the train started going again. As they looked
outside the window, they saw fire. They screamed again and tried to get
out but it was no use. Each of the passengers died that night on Halloween,
except for the woman, her baby, and the man with the axe. Each Halloween,
the passengers come back for a celebration of being out of the fire. They
dance all night until the morning, but sometimes, the man, the woman, and
the baby come back, and all the celebrations end. I am the engineer s son,
and Halloween, is my birthday.</B><B></B>

the side of the street like on mission blvd and the San Mateo bridge that
was the most scariest encounter with the unknown i have ever had and i

<BR><B>Ghost Story about my Brother</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Screamtotakeme@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I live in Lake View South Carolina and Here's my story. In 1962,
my great uncle Arthor Kirby died in my current bed room, the room I'm writing
in this very second. Ok well about 7 years ago my brother lived here with
his current wife. Well he got up in the middle of the night to get something
to drink out the kitchen (because wendy want some to, he had had 2 glasses.
He walked out the kitchen and back to my current bedroom and the light
to the kitchen turned off all by itself. He goes into the bedroom and tell
his wife that he think someone is in the house. He gets his gun out of
the closet and walks back tot he kitchenand turns the light back on to
chech if anyone was in there. There was noone in sight after a through
investigation and so he left out the kitchen again, without cutting off
the light. The light turned off again as it had done the lasttime. He turned
around and a white figure of a man sat looking at him holding his chest.
My brother ran like crazy back to the bedroom. He didn't sleep allnight.
About 2 years later, my Great Aunt come by for a visit and was told me
that a relative had dies in my bedroom. I asked her who and she told me
my great uncle Arthor. I asked her how and she told me of a heart attack.
Remembering the story of my brother, I asked her if she had a picture and
she told me yea in her picture book in her pocket book. I asked her to
stay were she was for an hour were I could go get my brother from down
the street to show the Picture to him. I didn't tell him anything untill
he got to the house and I asked him to look at the picture my great aunt
was holding. He turned Pale white and started crying.</B>
<BR><B>I personally have been in the living room and in the late night
in the middle of summer with the A/C off and the room get so cold the I
would blow the mist out of my mouth. I have also hired a Psysic to come
here and she fainted when she hit the door with out me telling her a thing,
described Uncle Arthor.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghost in my House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: underdog250@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My house is haunted.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure of that now. I don't believe
in "that" sort of stuff but out of all the things I've seen in the last
four months it's pretty hard not too.&nbsp; There is about 5 people living
in the house and everything that's happend is when several people have
been there.&nbsp; Let me just list the things that go on.&nbsp; Upstairs
lots of times the doors will open up and slam by themselves right after
footsteps are heard running around.&nbsp; I go up to investigate and no
nones there.&nbsp; Several other roomates have expirenced the same thing.&nbsp;
The strange part is that all three doors will all be open at the same time
or shut at the same time.&nbsp; I put shoes behind one when they were doing
it and the shoes just got knocked out of the way and the door opened again.&nbsp;
This was after all the windows had been closed upstairs.&nbsp; Several
people have heard and seen cabinet doors open and slam shut again for no
reason.&nbsp; There is a presents felt by all.&nbsp; One week during the
first month in the house 4 pictures were found by different roomates of
an old man in front of the cemetary in the driveway.&nbsp; I have digital
versons if you want them.&nbsp; Also doors will lock by themselves. What
makes this story really interesting is when we moved in the rmer tenetes
had left a bunch of there stuff behind.&nbsp; Even there big screen TV
and plates and dishes.&nbsp; A close friend of mine after soon learning
about the location of the house told me it was haunted and had a good friend
live in the house four years ago.&nbsp; After tracking the former tentate
down they said that the after storing objects in the basement like drum
sets they would be violently thrown from one end of the house to the other
if left against a certian wall.&nbsp; Also the former tenate told of the
ghost not liking shut doors which would explain what we were going through.&nbsp;
Nothing has been moved in the basement so far but a very cold pesence can
be felt and we've found many small bones in the dirt floor area of the
basement.&nbsp; This house has been known by quite a few people as being
haunted I later found out by talking to several people.&nbsp; It's on the
corner of Kimbrough and National in Springfield MO.&nbsp; It's a rather
old house and mostly from what I've heard either there was someone murderd
and barried in the basement under the dirt floor area or there is an old
man that died in the house and refused to leave.&nbsp; Either way the ghost
doesn't seem&nbsp; to be too violent or shown any violents towards us other
than a roomates window being smashed for no reason.&nbsp; I don't know
for sure it it's haunted but overall six people have personally witnessed
unexplained things since we moved in at the beginning of the summer.&nbsp;
If you have any suggestions on dealing with "Big Gay Al" ( that's what
I named him becuase I figured I can't be afraid of anything called that)
just let me know.&nbsp; I guess you can feel free to put that on the list
for Springfield's known hauntings becuase apparently lots of people know
about this house</B>

and a door between. My granddaugther was sleeping in an extra bed in the
sittingroom. I could see her through the open door.&nbsp; At 3 nigth I
waked up by the feeling somebody looked at me, and a white grand lady stod
in the door with her arms crossed over the breast.&nbsp; I could see my
grandchild through her.&nbsp; I went very careful and slow out of bed for
see her closer, but she disappeared like a soapboble.&nbsp; I did not told
any about it before we was home from the christmasholidays.&nbsp; But I
did it later to the owner as colect all stories.&nbsp; One day he called
me and asked me if I would come as ITV from England would come and make
a film about ghostes there.&nbsp; O did - and they had a psyky women with
them as did not knew where she should go and the stories at all. When I
had told my story to TV sitting at the edge of the bed. The psyky women
was keeped at the office far from us, came and when she entered the sleepingroom
she told it has always been a bedroom for kings and royal persons. There
has been born a child in this room - and when she got close to the door
between the two rooms she said: There is a lady standing in the doorway
in white with her arms crossing in front of the breast. Its the nurce who
toke care of the child, and she tells its absolutly forbidden to enter
the room for anyone else but the family.&nbsp; There was great wars between
Denmark aqnd Sweden and Dragsholm was the only castle they had not invaded
and never did, so if they could get the child they could easely get the
the castle as well.&nbsp; The owner never heard about that lady, as people
seldom get to sleep in these suite as is in the middle of the mainbuilding,
all other rooms sleepingrooms is in the wings. Its the same castle James
Hepburn who murded Queen Mary of Schotland&acute;s husband was a pisinor.&nbsp;
He is offen seen.&nbsp; I have more stories from that castle. my son have
seen fantastick things as I will tell some other day. OK ???</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Different Occurances</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>okay... here is my story.&nbsp; I'm going to try and keep it brief
because I could go on and on with different experiences I've had</B>
<BR><B>My Husbands House:</B>
<BR><B>My first experience was at my boyfriend (now husband) house.&nbsp;
We always felt that there was something around, we would fall asleep on
the couch and I would wake up in pitch black at 3am realizing it was time
to go home (I am an unbelievably heavy sleeper and dont wake up for anything).&nbsp;
This would happen every weekend Fri and Sat night for two years.&nbsp;
My Father-in-law claims he saw his father standing in the corner of the
room a year after he died.&nbsp; My husband claims he saw his grandfather
(same guy) standing in the doorway a month after he died.&nbsp; We would
sit in the living room and hear people walking and running upstairs (we
were the only ones home)</B>
<BR><B>My Best Friend</B>
<BR><B>When I was 17 my best friend died in a car crash.&nbsp; Strange
things started happening.&nbsp; My stereo would turn on by itself, switch
to a particular song play 30 secs of it then turn off, then turn back on
again and change radio stations then turn off.&nbsp; This same thing happened
to my best friends younger sister and our other mutual friend.</B>
<BR><B>College</B>
<BR><B>This was by far the most scary experience I have had.&nbsp; I lived
in a house in college which was haunted by two spirits I believe.&nbsp;
I had two roomates, we would hear people running up and down the stairs,
we would all be sitting in the living room and hear doors slamming at look
at each other in question.&nbsp; It always seemed to be really really bad
in the winter time and the end of the second semester.&nbsp; It was always
worse with me</B>
<BR><B>Story 1.&nbsp; I was sleeping in my bed (again I am an extremely
heavy sleeper) on my stomach and woke up to the sound of (sounded like
feet rubbing the carpet of our all weather carpet) shuffling.&nbsp; It
sounded to be circling my bed.&nbsp; I tried to open my eyes and all of
a sudden, my head was hitting the pillow someone or something was jumping
on my back and I was being thrown onto my pillow.&nbsp; I just closed my
eyes and prayed until it stopped.&nbsp; different things like this would
happen to me throughout the years, but not this severe.</B>
<BR><B>Story 2. I was in the shower and would get out and the mirror would
be steamed the initials HP were writted on the mirror.&nbsp; We thought
it was a practical joke someone had made.&nbsp; Another time my roomate
tried to trick me and drew an "evil" face on the mirror, well I got out
of the shower and there were handprints through it, I freaked out then
she freaked out because she didn't make the hand prints.</B>
<BR><B>I can feel spirits and phenomina everywhere I go, I recently went
to New Orleans, I will never go back there.&nbsp; I can walk into a house,
restaraunt, bar, business, and I know</B><B></B>

<P><B>Biker Blues</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ripley@edenstone.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am the member of an old school motorcycle club; you know the ones
you read about in the paper that terrorize small towns. So we have no time
for ghosts , hauntings or the like. Last winter we were kicked out of our
club house, the club house that we had been in for over 30 years. It was
a small old farm house that had suited our needs just fine. The rush was
on to find a new place, we knew that we wanted to stay in the country so
as not to be bothered by the towns’ people but where do you find farm land
for cheep these days? Ok so now you know what I do, now let me tell you
a little about me. I’m weird! My mother did automatic writing, the good
kind! As a child I was told all about spirit helpers, guides, and how to
talk to the strange things. I was schooled on how not to open doors that
you can’t close and that garlic won’t help keep anything away except your
friends. So nuff said about me. One day in desperation I stopped at the
club house, opened the curtains, got a beer, sat down at the card table
and started talking out loud to the house and whom / what ever was buried
in the grave we had out back. I said; we have been friends for years our
club has partied here and kept up your property, hell some of us have even
slept on your grave and now we need help! If you can make this land deal
fall through than please do so and we’ll stay and respect your land but
if we must leave than can you help us find another place in the area? Well
can you? Hay are you listening to me? Boy some help you are! I don’t know
what I was expecting but for sure it wasn’t the cold shoulder! No thunder!
no lights flashing! no news paper flopping open to the add page! nothing
just as I thought no ghostly help…Thanks for nothing! So I finished my
beer and headed for home, now I only had one beer but boy did I feel drained
kinda like I had been up all night it was even hard to concentrate on my
driving. I had gone about four miles when I turned on some road that I
had never even knew was there and I’ve been this way numerous times before,
as I traveled down this road in a stooper I came across an abandoned farm
house with some out buildings, I stopped wrote down the fire number and
went in search of the owner. After a few calls to real estate people I
get a name, I wrote a letter explaining who we were and what we needed
and put it in the mail. The following Saturday my wife and I and another
couple decide to “TRESSPASS” on the property to have a look see! Wow what
a place! The yard (about one and one half acres) was completely over grown,
big trees had fallen and had never been removed but you could tell that
someone had been working out there and quit before much had been done,
The house was in fantastic shape for it’s age other than it had become
a haven for raccoons. The out buildings were in good shape also, no vandalism,
no broken windows and there was stuff it the house and out buildings not
just old farm junk but furnishings and cars and a nice old truck, one building
had a work shop complete with tools! Now I figure that someone must be
leasing this place for farm work or something and we had better get before
we get caught on the property. I no sooner get home and the phone is ringing,
and it’s the owner of the property calling!! Wow again she loved my letter
and states that she was wondering how or who was going to help her take
care of her property. She says that no one has or can live or even stay
there for any length of time because of the ghosts and ,,,,,Woohhh I, say
the what’s?&nbsp; Oh the ghosts every one in the area knows that the place
is haunted and has been since the war. WW II the big one I ask? No she
says the civil war! .Well needless to say now she has my full attention,
she tells me that her son tried to stay on the property a few years back
to record the happenings but couldn’t take it so he left and won’t return
and how some people feel sick and get head aces and have to leave. I asked
her what she knew of the history of the place? Not much, but what she did
know was that a ghost that they called Emily would be seen leaving the
house and drift (yes I said drift) off in the direction of the old out
house, a full figured, floating apparition. Than there is the farmer who
is seen walking from the house to the out buildings early in the morning
and one time while her son was having a loud party in the barn the old
farmer started the hay-fork to swing and spin and then knocked both of
the doors off the building! Since that happening the hay-fork had been
cut down and the doors nailed shut. But the creepiest thing was the civil
war solder that will hover over you while you sleep and when you wake up
he’s staring you in the face. It was about now that my mothers stories
and training start to creep back in to my head and I ask in my professional
ghost hunters voice; have you actually seen these ghosts your self these
full form, with clothing and tools in hand ghosts? Yes she says but they
never tried to hurt me, well except for the time that something locked
me in the chicken coop! I talked with her like we were best friends for
a couple of hours and she fell in love with us and told us that for the
ridicules sum of one dollar a year the place and all the stuff in the house
and buildings was ours! She figured that if anyone could stay it would
be us. The next week I told the guys about the place and the deal and the
ghosts, no problem since no one believes in ghosts. They figure that it’s
just the insipid ramblings of an old woman. So we moved in, and guess what
the place is haunted! What a surprise? I have not seen any ghosts yet,
it seems that things only happen to the people who don’t know that the
place has ghosts. Things will move around, once a beer was fond sitting
on the bar open and cold only minutes after it had been put in the fridge.
Warm and when your in the house alone there is that creepy raise the hairs
on your arms feeling that something is watching you. Some people here voices
and not like far away spooky Hollywood voices, these voices say stuff like
“nice weather ay”. One member saw a figure in a dark robe cross the road
carrying a red lantern, my wife saw the swoosh of a dress as it passed
through a doorway. So haunted yes, dangerous not yet. But were new at this
haunted living stuff and I still would like to take some pictures and do
some investigating. We have a Halloween party scheduled on the property
this year and we’ll see what happens than. As for me not believing that
talking to the spirits can help, I should have known better all I needed
to do was ask and the spirit led or forced me to this place and maybe he
told his ghost friends that we were good humans to have around.&nbsp; True
story and it’s not over yet!</B>

<BR><B>A Few Canadian Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>1. This occurred at a tourist attraction on Highway 3, between St.
Thomas and Blenheim Ontario...The place is called the "Southwold Indian
Earthworks".&nbsp; My wife and I decided to take the scenic route to Essex,
Ontario, where her parents live, and so we were enjoying a pleasant drive
along Highway 3.&nbsp; This highway runs along the edge of Lake Erie, and
the vistas are quite beautiful, especially if you are driving west in the
late afternoon-early evening.&nbsp; Well, we saw this sign for the Southwold
Indian Earthworks and decided to make a little side trip.&nbsp; We parked
the car, and walked back a manicured path leading to the site&nbsp;&nbsp;
This all occurred during a bright sunny afternoon at around 2:00 P.M.&nbsp;
As we arrived at the actual site, we could see this encircling mound...actually
two parallel encircling mounds...where there had been a palisade of pointed
sticks erected some 400 years previously.&nbsp; There was also a porta-john
on the premises, and my wife decided to make a quick pit-stop there.&nbsp;
We were the only ones at the site...While she was in the porta-john I stepped
up onto the top of the double mound.&nbsp; I can only describe what happened
next as a very oppressive-feeling impression...as I stood there, I became
aware of chanting-softly at first, and increasing in volume.&nbsp; My wife
came back and said to me, "Ok, Let's look around"...and I replied, "I don't
have a really good feeling about this place!"&nbsp; She said "Oh, nonsense"
and I thought, "yeah, probably" so I started to follow her into the centre
of the clearing, where at one time there had been a sizeable Native settlement.&nbsp;
You could see where individual buildings had once stood...especially outstanding
to me for some reason were two parallel mounds a good sixty feet long.&nbsp;
I later asked a native friend about these, and she said to me that "Oh,
yes, that would have been the foundations of Longhouses!"&nbsp; At any
rate, I became aware of movement around me...not actual beings, but more
like unformed dark blobs of shadow undulating like they were almost dancing!&nbsp;
Even the sky began to look different...it appeared to take on a yellowish
hue...I said to my wife "I'm getting out of here!"...my heart began to
hurt very badly, and she and I both walked away.&nbsp; As we left the clearing,
not only did the pain in my heart stop, but the sky turned blue again,
and the chanting disappeared.&nbsp; It was a very moving thing, and I had
to pull over on the side of the road, and shed a few tears.&nbsp; I had
not been drinking or using drugs...this all happened in broad daylight,
and I always was a bit skeptical of this sort of thing!</B>
<BR><B>2. At one point in my life, I had a wood-working shop set up in
a building which had, in the mid-1800's up to the 1940's, been a Hotel.&nbsp;
This place was reputed to be haunted, although I never once saw, heard
or felt anything...and I had been in there at 2:00 A.M. in the dark!&nbsp;
My brother though, got one of the great thrills of his life in there one
stormy night...This building belonged to a friend of mine, and it was all
wired up...still recently enough used, that the wiring was reasonably up-to-date.&nbsp;
All he asked of us was that we shut the hydro off when we were leaving.&nbsp;
To get to the hydro switch, one had to walk out of the main part of this
old building into a back-kitchen area, switch off the switch, then turn
around and walk out the door.&nbsp; Between the switch and the door outside
was another door which led up a set of steps to the upstairs of the Hotel.&nbsp;
Well, this one wild night, my brother was getting ready to shut everything
down, and he walked up to the switch.&nbsp; As he stood facing it, he suddenly
heard very loud heavy footsteps come across the floor upstairs, stomp down
the staircase, and "something" flung the door open so violently it crashed
against the wall beside it!&nbsp; The "something" then stomped across the
floor to the door going outside, flung it open with equal force and disappeared
into the wild rainy night!&nbsp; My brother said that at this point, every
hair on his body was standing at attention!&nbsp; You see, he then had
to shut off the power switch, and follow whatever had gone out the door
out into the darkness...Well, he steeled himself, threw the switch, and
began to sing religious music at the top of his lungs, and bolted out the
door, locking it behind him!&nbsp; He got to his car, and made it back
to my house all right, but I think he managed to lose about 10 years off
his life in that brief encounter!&nbsp; (Incidentally, if you would like
to see pictures of this old Hotel, it IS online.&nbsp; It has been restored,
and is now a Bed-And-Breakfast just north of Goderich Ontario.&nbsp; It
is called "The Exchange Hotel" Bed-And-Breakfast.)</B>
<BR><B>3. This is the worst of the bunch...my aunt used to own a house
in Meaford, Ontario that had something very violent living in the upstairs...something
very violent AND invisible most of the time!</B>
<BR><B>Interestingly, I had myself slept in the room where this happened
dozens and dozens of times and never encountered anything mysterious, but
a cousin of mine in the process of waking up early one morning came face
to face with a midget or dwarf, male, which dematerialized right before
his eyes!</B>
<BR><B>What happened at my aunt's house, which I am about to tell, happened
to the same brother who had the encounter in the old Hotel...We had taken
a trip to see my aunt-we had a couple of cousins who lived there who were
around the same age as my brother and I, and we were close friends with.&nbsp;
The first night we were there, I got dibs on the bedroom (what with being
the "oldest" and all), and my brother slept on the couch...In retrospect,
I bet he wished he'd stayed with the couch!&nbsp; The second night we were
there, my brother said to me, "Ok, You got the bed last night, I want it
tonight!"&nbsp; Allright, turn about is fair play, so I bunked down on
the couch in my aunt's living room...</B>
<BR><B>About 2:00 A.M., my brother showed up at my side and asked me if
I would trade him couch for bed again!&nbsp; I said no, that I was comfortable,
and being the hard-as-nails person that my brother was at&nbsp; this period
of his life, he said, OK, and went off and spent the night "who knows where",
but it wasn't in that Bedroom!</B>
<BR><B>Next morning, at the breakfast table, my brother showed up with
his upper body very bruised and battered.&nbsp; I asked him what on earth
had happened, and he told me a story that just made my insides freeze...He
had been lying there in bed feeling very uneasy...looking into the closet...when
suddenly the clothes all swept sideways on the rod and the entity burst
out, grabbed him and put a full Nelson on him!!!&nbsp; My tough little
brother fought like mad, but the thing would only let go of him when he
prayed out loud to God!&nbsp; At that point, he had come downstairs and
asked me if I'd trade beds with him (which kind of creeps me out in retrospect...)&nbsp;
Of course, we never willingly spent another night in that house!&nbsp;
We later found out that before my Aunt and Uncle purchased the house, it
had been gutted by fire, and a little boy had burned to death in it.&nbsp;
Someone had later re-framed and rebuilt the place...</B>
<BR><B>My brother and I are both in our 40's...running our own successful
businesses.&nbsp; The Southwold incident took place in 1994, the Hotel
incident in 1993, and the apparition at my aunt's house occurred in 1981...Personally,
we both feel that these incidents were demonic in origin.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Magic Talking Grill</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:joepublic77@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I live in Laredo, TX on a street called Broadcrest.&nbsp; My wife
and I love to go to flea markets</B>
<BR><B>and the big one in Laredo is called Bordertown.&nbsp; About two
months ago we were shopping</B>
<BR><B>at the flea market when my 4 year old son saw a toy that he had
wanted for a while, "The Magic Talking Grill"&nbsp; This toy is a plastic
grill that would talk and move it's eyes and say thing like "fire it up"
and "put another hot dog on the fire", ect. The guy at the flea market
was selling it for something like 5 bucks, which was a great deal because
regular price is something like $50.&nbsp; I was barley used, so I thought
I was getting a great deal.&nbsp; What I was really getting was the scare
of my life.</B>
<BR><B>Everything was fine with it until about three weeks ago.&nbsp; My
wife had told me it went off by itself in the middle of the night.&nbsp;
I figured it was just one of those fluke things and I really didn't pay
it much mind.&nbsp; A few nights later it went off again and this time
I heard it.&nbsp; It freaked me out a little bit, so the next day I would
always keep it within earshot to see</B>
<BR><B>to see if it would go off again.&nbsp; All day and night nothing
happened til 1:34 am when it went off and continued to go of evey 20-30
minutes until about 4:30 in the morning and then it just stopped.&nbsp;
I thought "..how strange it would go off only at night"&nbsp; so I took
a real close look at it.&nbsp; Nothing seemed strange about the toy except
for the fact that it would go off only if I moved it with some force; appearantly
it has some kind of motion trigger built into it..&nbsp; Well the next
day I checked the batteries to make sure they were still ok and they were.&nbsp;
All that day nothing happened.&nbsp; That night I was laying in bed when
all of a sudden I got the chills from head to toe.&nbsp; The one overpowering
thought that suddenly entered my mind was "god, I hope that thing doesn't
go off..."and then i went off. It continued to go off sporatically till
just before sunrise then it stopped.&nbsp; Next day I pulled out the batteies.</B>
<BR><B>If anyone wants this toy, e-mail me. You can have it for free.</B>
