</H3><P><B>by fba!mramsey@fbamail.attmail.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>when i was about 9 yrs old, my mom, sister and I moved into my</B>
<P><B>grandparents' house after my mom and dad divorced.  well, my mom</B>
<P><B>went to work w/the airlines, and worked many night shifts. well, i</B>
<P><B>remember one night (i was about 10 yrs old), my sister and I were in</B>
<P><B>my gparents' room talking to them.  it was about 8:00 p.m., and my</B>
<P><B>mom didn't get off work until 10:00. anyway, we lived in a tri-level</B>
<P><B>home, and so, that night, at about 8, we heard the garage door open</B>
<P><B>and close, then the den door do the same. these two rooms were on</B>
<P><B>the 1st floor. the garage door was very hard to open, and was very</B>
<P><B>heavy.  then, we heard the sound of someone coming up the stairs (13</B>
<P><B>of them to be exact) up to the 2nd floor (where the kitchen, lr, dr,</B>
<P><B>front door, and sliding glass door to back patio was). my grandpa</B>
<P><B>said "girls, it's your mama! she's home!" so my sister and i ran to</B>
<P><B>the top of the 4 stairs leading from the 3rd floor into the</B>
<P><B>livingroom, which around a corner was the kitchen, right by the 13</B>
<P><B>stairs.  well, to our suprise (and my gparents' surprise), no one</B>
<P><B>was there. My gpa went downstairs to see what had gone on, and the</B>
<P><B>doors were all still locked.  that was the first time anything weird</B>
<P><B>like that had happened there.  that we'd noticed, at least. anyway,</B>
<P><B>things just got weirder from there. every night after that, we heard</B>
<P><B>the same sounds of someone coming in downstairs and coming upstairs.</B>
<P><B>always from the garage door. well, my grandpa found out that someone</B>
<P><B>had died during building that house (fell off the roof, broke his</B>
<P><B>neck), so we just named it "Charlie", since that was the only thing</B>
<P><B>we could figure to do, and figure who "it" was.... well, we moved to</B>
<P><B>another state when i was 14 years old, and left the big house</B>
<P><B>behind.  well, a few weird things happened over the years no matter</B>
<P><B>where we moved. we figured maybe he'd came w/us.  but nothing as</B>
<P><B>weird as the footsteps.  well, my grandpa died when i was 16, now</B>
<P><B>i'm 22.  nothing's happened over the past few years now, until</B>
<P><B>recently. my t.v will come on for no apparent reason, my vcr will</B>
<P><B>also turn on and a tape will start playing on my t.v.  i hear</B>
<P><B>whispering sometimes.  also, my t.v. will just start changing</B>
<P><B>channels, sometimes really fast, other times, not, when im not even</B>
<P><B>holding or sitting on the remote.  so, i don't know it im a little</B>
<P><B>crazy, or if it's "Charlie", or maybe perhaps my grandfather's</B>
<P><B>spirit (since we were really close), or maybe not something i'm</B>
<P><B>familiar with at all. it's begun to do it alot lately, too.  and the</B>
<P><B>thing is, it only happens when im alone at home. when my roomate is</B>
<P><B>there, i haven't heard or seen anything at all.  and he totally</B>
<P><B>doesn't believe me, or just blows me off when i try to talk about it</B>
<P><B>to him.  what do you think? i could really use some advice or</B>
<P><B>feedback from someone.  when i've tried to talk to my girlfriends</B>
<P><B>about it, they just seem to freak out about it, so.... thanks.</B>

<H3><A NAME=light>Starboard Light</A>
</H3><P><B>by Slynch4@ix.netcom.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I have enjoyed the stories on the webpage so far and I wanted to contribute
some of my </B>
<P><B>own.  This particular story is not one that happened to me, though
I also lived through </B>
<P><B>a personal haunting.  This is about my Great Grandfather Lynch.  He
lived in a beautiful </B>
<P><B>Tudor Mansion that was built in Greensburg, PA and he named it "Starboard
Light".  My </B>
<P><B>Great Grandfather had been in the Navy and retired a Commander.  He
was a veteran of WWI </B>
<P><B>and WWII.  He died at home the summer of 1963 and "Starboard Light"
was sold to the </B>
<P><B>University of Pittsburgh where they established a branch campus in
1964.  Unfortunately, </B>
<P><B>my Great Grandfather died 3 years before I was born, so I never had
the honor of meeting </B>
<P><B>him.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Since then, the University has turned the home into the Administration
Building and it </B>
<P><B>is now called Lynch Hall.  I had always heard stories about the house
but never knew </B>
<P><B>what to believe.  It wasn't until I had experienced a haunting myself
that I was able to </B>
<P><B>make sense of what is going on at Lynch Hall.  Recently, my father,
stepmother, sister </B>
<P><B>and I went to Lynch Hall and got our first tour since my sister and
I were small kids.  </B>
<P><B>I found that the school had painted the interior woodwork with an awful
gold paint.  I </B>
<P><B>was floored by the paint job when I walked in the house, I plan to
complain to the </B>
<P><B>University regarding this issue in the future.  It is my belief that
my Great </B>
<P><B>Grandfather probably objects to it as well and that may be one of many
reasons that he </B>
<P><B>is still there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One of the security guards showed us around the house.  My father told
us about what it </B>
<P><B>was like there when he was a kid because he spent an ample amount of
time there.  One </B>
<P><B>portion of the house was for living quarters and the other section
was my Great </B>
<P><B>Grandfathers office.  The guard told us that most sightings have occurred
in the office </B>
<P><B>section.  It is where there is a spiral staircase, and a huge office
on the first floor </B>
<P><B>and 2 bedrooms on the second in that section.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The guard proceeded to tell us how she walked into the bathroon on
the second floor to </B>
<P><B>close and lock the window and as she started to walk out she saw something
move in the </B>
<P><B>tub.  She looked and saw a gray figure sitting in the tub with legs
pulled close to him. </B>
<P><B> She said that he had sunken eyes and said to her telepathically "What
are you doing in </B>
<P><B>my bathroom?"  She looked away because she couldn't believe what she
was seeing and then </B>
<P><B>looked back.  He was still there.  She left to get another security
guard.  When she </B>
<P><B>left she left the door open, when she had arrived earlier the door
was cracked.  When </B>
<P><B>she came back with the other guard the door was cracked again and the
window in the </B>
<P><B>bathroom was open again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another time, she walked up to the house and came in the door where
either the main </B>
<P><B>entrance or the spiral staircase entrance is (this I'm not sure about).
 She saw a </B>
<P><B>figure standing at the top of the stairs leaning on the railing in
older clothes and </B>
<P><B>again he said to her "Well, are you coming in?"  She basically said
that she froze, and </B>
<P><B>refused to go in the house.  She said that she did not feel threatened
by him.  My </B>
<P><B>father had been told that one of the men that works in the building
turned around once </B>
<P><B>and saw my Great Grandfather in full dress uniform (Naval).</B>
<P>
<P><B>The security guard told us that they had a Psychic enter the house
and that as soon as </B>
<P><B>she walked in she could feel his presence.  She even noted the bathroom
incident, and </B>
<P><B>told the guards that the spirit was not a mean spirit and that he liked
to play jokes on </B>
<P><B>people.  According to other relatives that have been told these stories,
they don't </B>
<P><B>believe that it is my Great Grandfather.  They seem to think that he
would identify </B>
<P><B>himself.  I don't think that is the case.  I felt something in the
house before I was </B>
<P><B>told that he spent most of his time in that particular section.  I
could feel something </B>
<P><B>in one of the bedrooms and it made me catch my breath and my eyes water,
I could feel </B>
<P><B>something or someone there.  I was face to face with him, but could
not see him.  </B>
<P><B>Although, I did see some motion in the air.  It had kind of a fluid
look, and I'm sure </B>
<P><B>it wasn't my eyes.  I simply said, "Why are you here Great Grandfather,
you need to go </B>
<P><B>on".  Then I left the room to catch my breath.  I know someone or something
is in that </B>
<P><B>house.  I would like to help him make his peace with God.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had taken some pictures while in the house and I picked up something
near the spiral </B>
<P><B>staircase.  I'm not sure if it was my camera or if it was something
else.  However, I do </B>
<P><B>know that when we all walked back into the room where I felt a presence,
I didn't feel </B>
<P><B>it in that room anymore, but I could see the fluid motion in the main
second floor </B>
<P><B>hallway.  I believe that if it was my Great Grandfather, he did not
want to frighten us, </B>
<P><B>as we are family and I know he knows my father.  If anyone goes to
the Univ. of </B>
<P><B>Pittsburgh and knows of any true sightings that have occurred there,
I am interested in </B>
<P><B>hearing about it.  It must be true, I'm not interested in the jokes
and rumors. </B>

<H3><A NAME=paranormal>Paranormal Experiences</A>
</H3><P><B>by whyddah@AOL.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've had an interest in the paranormal since I was very young, and
also some "encounters" from that time on, so I've often put my experiences
somewhere between overactive imagination and possibility. </B>
<P><B>In 1987 my husband and I bought our first house in upstate NY.  A 45
year old brick house with one significant modification;  one wall between
the livingroom and a bedroom was  removed to enlarge the livingroom, and
an additional bedroom was built on with it's doorway opening into the old
bedroom's window.  This  new room was built complete with a full basement
under it.  Only two previous sets of owners, no deaths, or other health problems
in either family, according to the neighbors who originally owned the land
the house was built on and who knew both sets of prior occupants.</B>
<P><B>During the time we lived in this house, my husband was being treated
for depression, and I was beginning to take psychic development classes at
the local Spiritualist Church.  So we had some unusual energy in that
house.</B>
<P><B>The experiences that my husband and I had here were often focused in
this back corner of the house where the old bedroom was and in the added-on
bedroom.</B>
<P><B>First of all,  the light in the new bedroom would turn itself on any
number of times during the evening.  I would leave the room, turn off the
lightswitch next to the door, see the light go off and, presto, it would
be on again almost in the same instant that I would be turning around.  The
switch itself did not flip.  I actually got to the point of Monitoring  my
lightswitching activity at that doorway.  This game could go on 2 or 3 times
in a row before the light would stay off.  My husband never had this problem
with this switch. I have never had obsessive-compulsive tendencies, but this
game made me wonder.  I had the feeling of being "watched" in the old back
bedroom area.  I am not normally afraid of the dark, but never felt comfortable
walking through this area at night, in the dark. I had the feeling of being
watched from that corner of the basement when I would go down cellar to do
laundry.  The cat would get very nervous when I was down cellar, meowing,
demanding to be picked up, demanding that I follow her upstairs.</B>
<P><B>One afternoon, when I was alone in the house, I went into the new bedroom
to change.  I sat on the bed to rest for a moment and was quite suddenly
engulfed by feeling that Someone wanted to communicate with me.  I saw nothing,
there was no temperature change, but the room suddenly felt as if it were
crammed tight with people, the atmosphere seemed to get very dense.  I was
not really afraid, but was uncomfortable with what was happening.  In a firm
tone I said aloud, "I don't have time to talk with you right now, you have
to leave."  It did.  I never felt that again, but I didn't go back into the
room until bedtime and  my husband was with me.</B>
<P><B>Three episodes were more frightening. They are not here in order. 
One was a dream that I had. In it I sat on the cellar stairs while a "ghost"
repeatedly "flew" at me from that corner of the cellar.  It's sole purpose
was to terrify me,  It was male, with hugely wide open, unblinking eyes,
and it's body seemed to dangle under it's head. It would fly right up into
my face.  I just repeated calmly to it over and over that things were O.K.
and that it could go into the light (it's a dream, right?).  I only mention
this dream because it happened in the new bedroom.  Another occaisson I woke
up in bed with the feeling that something was lying on top of me (not the
cat) crushing me.</B>
<P><B>It was a very threatening presence.  Although my husband was asleep
right next to me, I couldn't move or talk to try and wake him.  Again I just
kept on repeating to this presence that everything was going to be O.K. and
that it could leave if it wanted to.</B>
<P><B>I don't remember the end of this episode.  The final scary incident
involved my husband in the cellar.  His wooodworking shop was down in that
corner and also in the small basement room under the new bedroom.  As he
turned on the light in the smaller basement room, something whitish and about
the size of a pigeon flew at his head.  He claims to have felt it brush the
top of his head as it flew out the doorway he was entering.  He screamed
and turned and ran for the stairs.  Upstairs I heard that scream, I thought
he had cut his hand off.  It was that kind of scream.  I went running...and
met him at the cellar stairs.  I've never seen him so frightened before or
since. I went down to investigate (it may have been a pigeon, and I was the
animal person).  There was nothing.  The cellar windows are fixed shut in
that house.  Nothing would have come down the gas furnace vent and lived
to tell the tale, the chimney trap was shut.  He calmed down, and worked
down there for the rest of the night without incident. We moved from that
house in 1991, by the way, we loved that little house, and still love to
drive by and look at it.  No experiences of this particular type have happened
since.  </B>
<P><B>If you have any comments about these experiences, I would truly like
to hear them,  some of this activity almost sounds poltergeistic to me, some
of it almost sounds possessive.  All of it sounds crazy in writing.</B>

<H3><A NAME=childhood>Story from My Childhood</A>
</H3><P><B>by cald1lb@midusa.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was a child we lived in my great uncle and aunt's farmhouse
(they </B>
<P><B>lived in a different house).  I used to tell my mom that I saw an old
</B>
<P><B>lady roaming around our house.  She began seeing things out of the
corner </B>
<P><B>of her eyes.  Then, one day I told her that the lady told me that she
</B>
<P><B>made the curtains in the livingroom.  My mom called my grandma, and
she </B>
<P><B>said that a lady who used to live there named Mrs. Urban made the </B>
<P><B>curtains.  I was only about 3 or 4 years old, and there was no way
that I </B>
<P><B>could have known that, and nobody told me. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Mrs. Urban's husband, Ben, stole tombstones from a cemetary about half
a </B>
<P><B>mile away from the house and walled them up in the basement.  Who knows,
</B>
<P><B>maybe some of those people haunt the house?</B>

<P>
<P><B>i am a civil war re-enactor  for northern va. and have been on many
battlefields but the one that will always stay in my mind is henry hill in
manassas va the sight of  one of the bloodiest battles of va.my fellow
re-enactors and i were camped out for a living history{ which is just camp
life basiclly} when we decided to walk around we went into the woods maybe
a mile or so when we heard a fire crackiling as far as we knew we were the
only re-enactors here or were we? we approached the fire only to see a
confedarate battle flag hanging limply from a tree upon futher investigation
we saw an  officer cleaning his rifle and talking to men we didnt see a few
moments ago he looked up and asked us what outfit we were with  we told him
we were the southern grays ( lees army of northern va ) he offered us a seat
and began to say how badly we {whooped} the yanks today we were just stunned
speechless  the apparition then just vanished  poof  like it had never been
there we vowed we would never  discuss this because people would think we
were nuts as we turned to leave we noticed a large tree with three headstones
overgrown with smaller trees and roots etc. and we knew we were probably
the first to see this  upon inspection of the headstones  we read the names
of 3 rebel officers who died. we investgated the names and read their histories
and learned they were killed by a night raid in their  camp right near where
we saw them that night it may sound weird but its true</B>

<H3><A NAME=williamsburg>Williamsburg Stories</A>
</H3><P><B>by kbhigg@maila.wm.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am a sophmore at the College of William and Mary-the second oldest
in</B>
<P><B>the USA, and keeper of the oldest building in the country-the Wren</B>
<P><B>Building. First some historical notes about Williamsburg:</B>
<P><B>Williamsburg is one of the most visited sights in the USA-It's the</B>
<P><B>largest working museum in our country. Williamsburg is a complete Old</B>
<P><B>colonial town with original buildings and new old style ones.  THere
are</B>
<P><B>houses here from the 1600's, and there are about 20 TRUE ghost
stories</B>
<P><B>associated with the place. All of the stories have been researched,
and</B>
<P><B>can be backed up by old documents such as police records, books,</B>
<P><B>journals, etc.  THe first story I shall relate has to do with the
Peyton</B>
<P><B>Randolph house-It is the most haunted house on the east coast,and it</B>
<P><B>ranks 2nd in the nation. THe Peyton Randolph House has been linked
to 23</B>
<P><B>unnatural deaths (3 of which were men lynched to its imposing tree
out</B>
<P><B>front) and I will never go in front of that house alone-It emits such
an</B>
<P><B>evil force that I am scared just writing about it-LAst night I went
on a</B>
<P><B>ghost tour of the place, where a professionally trained student had
been</B>
<P><B>versed in all the TRUE stories of Williamsburg, and the last stop was</B>
<P><B>this place...here are some of the stories...</B>
<P>
<P><B>When the first inhabitants of the house moved into their dwelling
around</B>
<P><B>the turn of the 18th centuary, they were pleased with the stately
home</B>
<P><B>and knew that they-the mom, dad, and three sons, ages 6,8, 16 would
like</B>
<P><B>it there. However, two weeks after moving in, the youngest fell
gravely</B>
<P><B>ill and died about a month later. THe eight year old, prone to
climbing</B>
<P><B>the many trees out in the backyard, had a tragic accident one</B>
<P><B>afternoon-he fell, snapped his neck, and was found some 5 hours
later,</B>
<P><B>dead and cold. THe last son, being 16 and of age, was in the militia
and</B>
<P><B>during training,was struck in the head by a stray musket ball and was</B>
<P><B>killed instantly. The parents were devasted and moved out of the
house</B>
<P><B>as quickly as possible. Some years later, a new family moved in, with
3</B>
<P><B>boys-aged 6,8, 16.  Within the first two weeks of living there, the
6</B>
<P><B>year old boy grew ill and thus dies very quickly and painfully within</B>
<P><B>two weeks. A couple of days later, the 8 manages to drown himself in
a</B>
<P><B>foot and a half of water behind the house while his playmate is with</B>
<P><B>him. THen, the oldest boy, who was NOT in the militia, was attending
a</B>
<P><B>parade at the main street, and was struck in the head by a stray
bullet</B>
<P><B>and died...THe family moves out, and more live in the house----</B>
<P>
<P><B>One of these families was one that consisted of a mother, father, and</B>
<P><B>daughter named Anastasia, being 8 years old. Very well mannered and</B>
<P><B>quiet, Anastatsia developed a special friendship with an imaginary</B>
<P><B>friend named Elizabeth. Anastasia was very considerate of her new</B>
<P><B>friend-She always warned peopel "Elizabeth is sitting there, please</B>
<P><B>don't squash her,"or "Elizabeth is the nicest friend in the world."
</B>
<P><B>However, within a months passing, Anastasia grew mean and hatefull
with</B>
<P><B>her friend, saying, "Elizabeth hates you. Go away, I hate you, too!"
and</B>
<P><B>things of a related nature. THe parents, being concerned, grew very</B>
<P><B>tired of her meaness one nihjt, amd sent her to her room without
supper,</B>
<P><B>saying that she was not allowed to play with anyone, not even
Elizabeth.</B>
<P><B>ABout an hour later, the parents hear maniacal and screaming, and
load</B>
<P><B>crashes, the sound of glass breaking...</B>
<P><B>THey run up and try to open the door, but it was much harder to</B>
<P><B>open-When they finally do, the are horrified by what find-blood is</B>
<P><B>everywhere, and the window, being on the second story above the steps</B>
<P><B>ouside, was broken. Anastasia had flung herself out the window, and
when</B>
<P><B>her body was inspected, they found that her wrists were slit,and a
small</B>
<P><B>crest was embedded into her shoulder. AN old woman, who was witness
to</B>
<P><B>the crest, knew that this was the crest of a familiy that had lived</B>
<P><B>there before-A girl, aged 15 was the only daughterof that familiy.
She</B>
<P><B>had fallen in love  with the stable boy, and when her parents
banished</B>
<P><B>her from seeing him, she slit her wrists and flung herself out of the</B>
<P><B>same window as Anastasia-on her ring finger was the crest  of her</B>
<P><B>family!</B>

<H3><A NAME=angela>Angela Revisited</A>
</H3><P><B>by kelpie@erols.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello,</B>
<P><B>It seems that a lot of people like my story, "Angela" and have been</B>
<P><B>asking me for more of my experiences.  I've had quite a number of
them</B>
<P><B>over the past 12 years.  I guess it's these stories that make your
page</B>
<P><B>so popular.  Anyhow, I'm certainly willing to share my experiances,</B>
<P><B>so... as people ask for more... I'll share more.  Unless you'd rather
I</B>
<P><B>didn't.</B>
<P><B>Anyhow, here's one of my encounters with something less pleasent than</B>
<P><B>Angela.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Since I was about 19, I've hung around with people who were psychicly</B>
<P><B>active (I'll be 32 next month).  One day, one of my friends who was
just</B>
<P><B>becoming aware, came to me with a concern about a park near her house.
</B>
<P><B>She said that it had previously been a very pleasent place.  It was
a</B>
<P><B>big wooded area with lots of hills and paths and a creek or two.  She</B>
<P><B>told me that recently, something had changed about the place.  It no</B>
<P><B>longer felt friendly and she felt as though something unpleasent was</B>
<P><B>watching her.  She was particularly concerned about one spot.  I
offered</B>
<P><B>to go check it out, along with another friend.  So the three of us</B>
<P><B>trundled out there, to see what boggie men had been stirred up.  When
we</B>
<P><B>got there, there was deffinately an unpleasent and meanacing feel to
the</B>
<P><B>place.  As we made our way to the spot she was concerned about, Jenny</B>
<P><B>got kind of confused and couldn't find her way there.  This was
unusual</B>
<P><B>as she had been to this spot many times before.  I said that it was
ok,</B>
<P><B>I would find it.  I reached out with my non-physical senses and tried
to</B>
<P><B>find the source of the disturbance.  I got a lock on it and we went
that</B>
<P><B>direction.  As we homed in on it, it seemed to shift and try to lead
us</B>
<P><B>off in another direction.  "Oh No," I said, "I know this game.  My</B>
<P><B>ancestors called it 'being lead astray'"  I eventualy zeroed in on
the</B>
<P><B>spot and led us there.  It was the exact spot that Jenny had been
trying</B>
<P><B>to take us to.  It was at the top of small hill, and there was a sort
of</B>
<P><B>depression in the ground.  There were the remains of a low, stone
wall</B>
<P><B>around it.  In the middle of this area were a beat up old sofa,
lazyboy</B>
<P><B>and coffee table.  We surmised that this was a teen hang out. At that</B>
<P><B>time, there had been a rash of occult related vandalism and crimes
in</B>
<P><B>Fairfax County, where the park was.  We did find a few objects in the</B>
<P><B>area that could have been occult related, but no diffinitive evidence.
</B>
<P><B>So... by this time, at least three entities had shown up.  They tried</B>
<P><B>scarring us away but we would have none of it.  We were basically,
like,</B>
<P><B>"Ok... Bring it on"!  One entity attacked and another ran off into
the</B>
<P><B>woods.  My other friend took off after it and I dealt with the</B>
<P><B>attacker.  The third just sort stood there waiting to see what</B>
<P><B>happened.  Understand that this was not an unusual thing for us. 
We'd</B>
<P><B>been doing this sort of thing for a couple of years, by this time.
</B>
<P><B>So... I managed to bind the attacker, and my friend got the one that
ran</B>
<P><B>away.  The third one still just stood there.  We then discovered that</B>
<P><B>there was indeed a gate of some sort in the area.  We forced the two</B>
<P><B>bound entities back through it and the third went along quietly.  We</B>
<P><B>then sealed off the gate.  That was about 7 or 8 years ago, things
have</B>
<P><B>been pretty quiet in that area since then.</B>

<P>
<P><B>I have been reading this web page for about 4 months now... I really
do</B>
<P><B>enjoy it.  I just read the story titled "Grandpa Rides Shotgun" and
I</B>
<P><B>thought about my story...</B>
<P><B>My grandfather taught me piano lessons ever since I was a little
girl.</B>
<P><B>He became very ill, colon cancer.  I can not say that I was very
close</B>
<P><B>to him but I loved him alot.  On the night of his funeral my sister
was</B>
<P><B>babysitting my cousins and I was home alone.  At 3:00am, I awoke to
a</B>
<P><B>strange feeling in my room and noticed an indentation on my bed, as
if</B>
<P><B>someone was sitting on my bed.  I was initially frightened but then
fell</B>
<P><B>back to sleep.  I woke up again around 3:30am feeling a bit nervous,
for</B>
<P><B>whatever reason I do not know.  I wanted to call my sister, but I
didn't</B>
<P><B>considering how early in the morning it was.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I did not say anything to my sister at first.  But it came up in</B>
<P><B>conversation one time.  My sister told me the identical experience
at</B>
<P><B>the same time of the night.  After telling each other the story we
both</B>
<P><B>said "Why didn't you call me !?!?".</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have realized through the years that my grandfather was just saying</B>
<P><B>good-bye and that he loved us.  I know he is in a good place, and I
love</B>
<P><B>him too.</B>

<H3><A NAME=civil>Civil War Spirits</A>
</H3><P><B>by Pyncheon@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was a gorgeous fall afternoon here in Georgia when I decided to
play sick at my job so I could leave early. I went home to where my sister
Teresa was babysitting my 4 year old son Wesley, and suggested we go somewhere
nice to enjoy the beautiful weather. We decided to go to a local Civil War
National Battlefield Park. It is a gorgeous place with the typical numerous
trails and various sites where soldiers were were buried before they were
relocated after the war, monuments, and the famous places where the battles
were held. We went to a site where one of the most gruesome battles of the
war took place. We were walking along one of the trails when we came upon
a stream. Wesley had some toys that he brought with him, so he wanted to
play in the water for a bit. We stayed there for about 15 minutes when I
heard some voices. I asked my sister if she heard them too, and she did.
My son heard them as well and asked me who it was. I picked up Wesley and
told Teresa that we should follow the sounds of the voices to see who it
was. It sounded like about 20 people that were marching and chanting like
they do in the old war movies. I can't describe how errie it sounded. The
closer we got to these voices, the further they seemed away. We started running
so we could find out what it was, when the sounds just stopped completely.
I dismissed it at first, thinking that is was maybe some reenactors, or maybe
that it was some kids from a school field trip. But then that seemed odd.
It was around 2 o'clock in the afternoon on a Wednesday, and the reenactors
were usually there on weekends...not in the middle of the day. Before we
left the park, we went to the information desk and asked if there were any
reenactments going on or any field trips there on that day, and the lady
said no. We told her what we had heard, and she told us that other people
had heard the same thing in about the same place that we did, and that she
couldn't explain it. I truly believe that Teresa, Wesley, and myself experienced
a supernatural occurance from the souls of those killed there. It is a memory
I will always cherish.</B>

<H3><A NAME=flushing>Toilet Flushing Spirits</A>
</H3><P><B>by smith-williams@digital.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Greetings from England!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi, I was wondering if you were interested in my story.  Just to let
you</B>
<P><B>know that whenever someone tells ghost stories or I hear of ghostly</B>
<P><B>goings-on, I tear up and feel that I cannot breathe and it has always</B>
<P><B>bewildered me.  It also happens to my brother but I only found that
out</B>
<P><B>the other day!  My psychic friend has told me the reason that I tear
up</B>
<P><B>and get claustrophic, is because I am a very spiritual person and am</B>
<P><B>surrounded by spirits all day, and when we hear ghost stories, they
come</B>
<P><B>closer to us to try and contact us.  I don't know whether I believe
that</B>
<P><B>or not, but that is one explanation.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway here is my experience, no visual sightings though!</B>
<P>
<P><B>It always happens when I am in a half awake, half asleep kind of
state,</B>
<P><B>like when I am dozing off, and mine have only happened during the
day,</B>
<P><B>like if I have a lie in or something.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I start to doze off and then I can hear movements in my bedroom and
feet</B>
<P><B>shuffling on the carpet and whispers around me, sometimes children,</B>
<P><B>sometimes adults.  I can hear wardrobe doors being opened in my
bedroom</B>
<P><B>and have even heard my toilet flushing!  One day, I heard adults tell</B>
<P><B>their children to hurry up and get the toys and not to wake the
sleeping</B>
<P><B>woman.  (This was odd in itself, as I was living in Germany at the
time,</B>
<P><B>but the voices were in English!!) </B>
<P>
<P><B>On every ocassion, I am trying so hard to force myself to wake up but
am</B>
<P><B>paralysed.  I seem to be awake in my mind, but my body doesn't want
to</B>
<P><B>respond.  I am almost screaming in my head for me to wake up, but
still</B>
<P><B>I remain silent and motionless.  I have even felt someone(thing) sit
on</B>
<P><B>my bed and tell me to wake up on numerous occasions, all to no avail.
</B>
<P><B>Eventually I will sink into a deeper sleep and wake naturally some
time</B>
<P><B>later.</B>
<P>
<P><B>These experiences started when I lived in a small apartment inside
a</B>
<P><B>house in Germany, the house being the oldest one in the town left</B>
<P><B>standing after the war.  My husband and I were living in the attic
of</B>
<P><B>this house in a two bedroom apartment.  The only way up to the
apartment</B>
<P><B>was up some really creaky stairs, and boy were they creaky.  My</B>
<P><B>experiences only ever happen when I am alone, like when my husband
has</B>
<P><B>gone to work and I jump back into bed for an extra half hour's sleep!!
</B>
<P><B>The door to my apartment was always locked, so these experiences
could</B>
<P><B>not be intruders.  To get to our bathroom in this apartment, you had
to</B>
<P><B>go through an unrenovated part of the attic with a small flight of</B>
<P><B>stairs leading into the very top of the house.  This was always</B>
<P><B>unnerving walking past these stairs at night, nothing concrete, just
a</B>
<P><B>feeling, which my husband also picked up on.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When we moved out of the house, the experiences kept happening in the</B>
<P><B>new apartment (still in Germany) and our bedroom was next to the</B>
<P><B>bathroom.  The bathroom had no windows, so thirty seconds after you
turn</B>
<P><B>the light on, a fan would start in the bathroom to rid the room of
steam</B>
<P><B>and condensation.  Some mornings I would hear the toilet flushing</B>
<P><B>several times and also hear the fan going; once again, frantically</B>
<P><B>trying to wake myself up, without success.  Once again, only way into</B>
<P><B>the apartment was through the locked front door, and you even had to
be</B>
<P><B>buzzed in to the main reception area!</B>
<P>
<P><B>On moving back to England the experiences are still with me, but not
as</B>
<P><B>strong.  I am busy at work now, so I don't have too many lie-ins, but</B>
<P><B>you can guarantee, once in a while, if I am on my own, and in that
half</B>
<P><B>awake-half asleep stage, someone(thing) will be with me in the
bedroom,</B>
<P><B>telling me to wake up.  I don't really know what kind of feelings
this</B>
<P><B>brings on in me, I am not scared or frightened, but it makes me a
little</B>
<P><B>apprehensive and I would like to see what is causing this.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have asked many people about this, even psychic friends of mine,
but</B>
<P><B>they have no answers.  I tell everyone I know about it, trying to
work</B>
<P><B>it out, but eventually have come to the conclusions, that I must be</B>
<P><B>delusional, or due to the fact that I am half-asleep, I must be</B>
<P><B>dreaming.  I have never felt anything else, or seen anything for that</B>
<P><B>matter, so I am wondering just what is going on.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Looking forward to hearing your comments in the near future. </B>

<H3><A NAME=church>Aquia Church Ghost</A>
</H3><P><B>by Kathryn.McAlpine@peostamis.belvoir.army.mil </B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi ... I ran across your homepage .. very interesting!!  I found the</B>
<P><B>Haunted Places Index and saw Aquia Church in Stafford County.  I live
in</B>
<P><B>Stafford, Virginia and run Rescue at Aquia Harbour Rescue Squad which
is</B>
<P><B>located by the church.  About two years ago, myself and another guy
were</B>
<P><B>on duty one nite... We were at the movies (we get to see the movies
for</B>
<P><B>free at the local movie theater since it never fails that we don't
see a</B>
<P><B>whole movie before getting called out.) .. Anyway .... we were seeing</B>
<P><B>the movie "Seven" ... very scary movie, if you've seen it before.</B>
<P><B>Anyway .. we get punched for a call in the Harbour for a woman
choking,</B>
<P><B>but was told to stage before entering the scene. . So we staged the</B>
<P><B>ambulance at the end of the street that the emergency was on.  It was
a</B>
<P><B>raining nite and very muddy out.  It seems that a lady was in her</B>
<P><B>kitchen and was by the sink and saw out her kitchen window a woman
in</B>
<P><B>her backyard, holding her throat.  She was said to have long blonde
hair</B>
<P><B>and in a white gown. So the dispatchers told the lady to stay inside</B>
<P><B>(since it was night time outside and really wasn't sure what was
going</B>
<P><B>on) and wait for the police to arrive. The police arrived and after</B>
<P><B>about 10 minutes we were put back in service, cause they couldn't
find</B>
<P><B>anything.... Thinking this was rather strange, we went back to the
Squad</B>
<P><B>and I called dispatch for times and asked them what was that all
about.</B>
<P><B>They proceeded to tell me that the police arrived and went into the</B>
<P><B>backyard.. they searched the small wooded backyard and didn't find</B>
<P><B>anything.. also they stated that there were NO footprints at all back</B>
<P><B>there.... and with the rain and the soggy/muddy ground there should
have</B>
<P><B>been some prints in the backyard, but found none or the young lady
in</B>
<P><B>white.   I thought that was rather weird... So in a couple days ..
I was</B>
<P><B>talking to some of the other squad members there and told them of my</B>
<P><B>previous nite and the call... ( up to this point I knew nothing of
the</B>
<P><B>Aquia Church ghost) ... One of the members proceeded to tell me of
the</B>
<P><B>murder that had occur back in the civil war time (or something like</B>
<P><B>that) and of the young woman with the blonde hair and white gown that</B>
<P><B>has been spotted numerous of times over the years in Aquia.   Well
I was</B>
<P><B>very freaked out hearing about this .... I couldn't believe that this</B>
<P><B>was happening right in our backyards.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I may not have seen anything.... but to go on a "ghost call" as my</B>
<P><B>friends call it was very strange to say the least.  Just thought I
would</B>
<P><B>share that since you had the Aquia Church haunting on your site!!</B>

<H3><A NAME=eyes>Demon Eyes?</A>
</H3><P><B>by mfrueh@mdp.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>My husband and I bought our first house on 214 SE 8th St in Ankeny,</B>
<P><B>IA.  (We've since moved.)  I don't know when I first noticed this,
but if I</B>
<P><B>stood in our living room and looked through the east side window, I</B>
<P><B>would see a pair of red lights shining eerily in the middle of our</B>
<P><B>neighbor's yard at night.  It would be when they weren't home, so
their</B>
<P><B>backyard was pitch black.  I remember getting the most uncomfortable</B>
<P><B>feeling when I first saw them, because there was no reason for them</B>
<P><B>to be there.  I thought perhaps somehow it was a reflection or</B>
<P><B>refraction of light from our house, but no, after turning off living
room</B>
<P><B>lights, the stereo and shutting the front window drapes to eliminate</B>
<P><B>these possible light sources, the pair of red lights remained.  They</B>
<P><B>were 7 feet off the ground at least, and when they appeared, they</B>
<P><B>always appeared in the same spot.  They glowed a very bright red, yet</B>
<P><B>did not illuminate the darkness around them.  They were spaced too
far</B>
<P><B>apart to be human eyes, but they were not far enough apart to be a</B>
<P><B>car's tail lights.  Besides, they appeared in the middle of our
neighbor's</B>
<P><B>backyard,  far from any street.  They would be there for several
hours.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I got the impression of evil from this, as thought this might be a
spectre</B>
<P><B>of some kind, so I never ventured outside to get a closer look.  They</B>
<P><B>were puzzling, because they didn't appear all of the time, so I
didn't</B>
<P><B>make out any pattern of when they would appear,  the only common</B>
<P><B>factor was that the neighbors weren't home on those nights.  I got</B>
<P><B>used to seeing them after awhile, so I would avoid looking out the</B>
<P><B>window for the rest of the evening, or would close those curtains.
</B>
<P><B>Somehow, which is very odd, I never told my husband about seeing</B>
<P><B>them either, until after we moved.  I'm glad I didn't, because he said
he</B>
<P><B>would've gone outside for a closer look!  I wonder if the new owners</B>
<P><B>have seen them?  I'd like to ask them, but I don't suppose I will.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This just happened to me recently, at our new house:</B>
<P>
<P><B>Two past Midnight</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've been spending a lot of time on our new computer reading ghost</B>
<P><B>stories.  I put my computer on suspend instead of a complete</B>
<P><B>shutdown.  I decided to read some magazines, so had been sitting</B>
<P><B>there reading with the cat on the back of the chair, and the husband
in</B>
<P><B>bed sleeping for about 45 minutes, when I heard the computer turn</B>
<P><B>itself back on!  Ok, maybe somehow the wire to the mouse had some</B>
<P><B>tension on it, causing it to move.  I happened to look at the clock
to see</B>
<P><B>what time it was...it was 12:02 a.m.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next evening, my husband asked me to make jell-o with fruit in
it.  I</B>
<P><B>set the timer on my microwave for 90:00 minutes, to remind me when
to</B>
<P><B>put fruit in.  We remained in the kitchen, my husband and I, talking
about</B>
<P><B>the day's events, when I had this compelling feeling to look at the</B>
<P><B>microwave.  I whipped my head around to look at the microwave, and</B>
<P><B>the time remaining on the timer said...12:02.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That night, I had drifted off to sleep, when my husband woke me up</B>
<P><B>suddenly.  He told me he'd heard a sound, like our cat had barfed</B>
<P><B>behind the stereo in our bedroom.  I got up and looked, nothing was</B>
<P><B>there.  He apologized for waking me up.  I told him that it was okay,
that</B>
<P><B>I was used to it by now.  I sensed even as I asked him the
question...by</B>
<P><B>the way, what time is it?  You guessed it, the clock said 12:02 a.m.!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Strange coincidence, huh?</B>

<H3> <A NAME=basement>Haunted Basement</A>
</H3><P><B>by pritchek@hilly.apci.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Curently,I work with a woman who as a child lived in a haunted house
in</B>
<P><B>Belleville, Illinois.  The house is on Orchard Drive.  She asked me
not</B>
<P><B>to post the exact address with the web site out of consideration of
the</B>
<P><B>present owners, friends of her parents.  The house in question once
had</B>
<P><B>a ceramic business in its basement owned and operated by a married</B>
<P><B>couple, one being "Arthur".  Arthur was a long-distance trucker.  One</B>
<P><B>night he was killed in a car-truck accident.  The wife was</B>
<P><B>grief-stricken.  After the accident, she felt his presence standing</B>
<P><B>behind her and breathing whenever she went into the basement's
ceramic</B>
<P><B>shop area.  Odd things would happen in the basement.  There is a cold</B>
<P><B>spot in the basement.  Also, cupboard doors would be open when the
wife</B>
<P><B>had closed them during the prior evening.  My friend as a child shared
a</B>
<P><B>bedroom with her sister.  In the room, there was a overhead attic</B>
<P><B>pull-down stairs.  Several times during her childhood she and her
sister</B>
<P><B>would awaken by loud thumping and vibrations being emitted by the
door.</B>
<P><B>My friend's family had a dog which refused to enter the basement. 
She</B>
<P><B>stated that she had felt someone behind her, breathing in the basement.
</B>
<P><B>After this experience my friend told me she truly believes in ghosts
and</B>
<P><B>haunted places having had first-hand experience with the supernatural.
</B>
<P><B>According to my friend, the house is still haunted.  By the way,</B>
<P><B>Belleville, Illinois is an old german community which is rumored to
have</B>
<P><B>several haunted houses and places situated within the city.</B>

<P>
<H3><A NAME=apartment>Haunted Apartment</A>
</H3><P><B>by SisterFix@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have been wanting to share this experience for quite some time. 
This happened about 15 years ago, but lives in my mind as if it only happened
yesterday.  This all took place over a six month period of time.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My best friend, Jackie, and her brother, Mike, moved into an apartment
together.  I basically lived there too, I didn't have a room, but I was always
there (the couch was my bed).  When they first moved in little things happened
which we thought were coincidental - or we blamed the dog.  They had a very
mild mannered dog who suddenly began ripping the apartment to sheds when
left alone during the day (or at least we thought it was the dog).  We thought
that it was just upset over the move.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Mike started having very peculiar dreams.  He would dream that a short
(about 4 feet tall) hooded person, with bright red eyes would stand beside
his bed and watch him sleep.  He would wake up - very upset - to always find
the front porch light on.  He would get up - turn it off - go back to sleep
- and have the same dream again.  Then he would awake again to find the light
back on.  This was only the beginning of many things to come.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night we were all sitting in the living room talking.  We could
see into the kitchen from where we were seated.  Suddenly a plastic cup -
which was sitting on the counter - flew across the room and hit the wall
with great force.  We started to get a little concerned.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>A few days later we heard a loud THUD which sounded like someone had
hit the wall - somewhere.  After investigating the whole place - we found
a spot in the hallway that looked like it was punched from the inside.  It
was a bulge about the size of a fist protruding outward.  Whatever was in
that place was not to happy that we were there.  Things starting picking
up rapidly - more frequent - until we were all scared to death.  No one wanted
to be there alone - sometimes not even together.</B>
<P>
<P><B>There are many little things that kept happening, voices, scratching
sounds on the carpet - but I want to get to the two big things which sent
all of us packing.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night I had fallen asleep on the couch.  I had on a black outfit
- and Jackie had put a white "fuzzy" cover over me before she went to bed.
 When I woke up the next morning I had white fuzz all over me.  I was sitting
there picking the stuff off when I noticed a shadow on the wall across the
room.  The way the living room was situated - the person making the shadow
would have to have been right behind me.  So I thought Mike had gotten up
and was standing there getting ready to scare me.  I decided to beat him
to the draw and turned around and yelled "Gotcha".  To my surprise - no one
was there - and when I looked back at the shadow it lingered there for a
moment - then flew away.  I ran screaming into Jackie's room.  That was the
first time any of us had actually "seen" the ghost.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The last straw - - - Jackie was alone one day in the kitchen.  She
was making herself a peanut butter sandwich, spreading the peanut butter
on using a steak knife.  Before she knew what was happening - her arm and
hand took on a life of their own.  Her right hand started trying to cut at
her left wrist.  She was fighting it with all of her strength.  It grazed
her wrist twice - deep enough to make it bleed.  She was finally able to
break free of the force, throw the knife down and ran like crazy out of there.
 It was trying to kill her!  </B>
<P>
<P><B>It wanted us out - and we were - the next day.  Jackie found out who
some of the previous occupants were and asked them if anything similar had
ever happened to them.  It had - - and that's why they left too!!</B>
