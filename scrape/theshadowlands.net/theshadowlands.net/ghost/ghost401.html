Ghost in Lisbon<br>
<br>
By: CTWOMAN37@aol.com<br>
<br>
In Lisbon, Ct my son was driving to pick me up from work. I get out at
12 midnite. When he got to my work he told me that he had almost hit a
lady and he was pretty upset. I was furious. I asked him how could he
hit a lady, and that he had just gotten his license and he needed to be
more careful. He explained to me that she was walking right in the
middle of the road on this one stretch where there is nothing. No
houses no nothing but there she was walking on a foggy nite right in
the middle of the road. A few months later I was coming home it was a
foggy nite, but not bad and I saw a woman with dark rimmed glasses
climbing over the embankment with a shovel in her hand with a brown
tweed looking trench coat on , she had short brown hair with black
rimmed glasses on , byt no eyes. She was not concerned about me being
there at all. She had no flash light, it is a deserted part of the
road, but yet there she was. I told my son of what I had seen . It was
the same woman!.A few days later me and my girlfriends went up there
climbed the hill she was walking down to see what was there. We did
find a small pile of bones, and I still have one. I am sure that it was
animal bones. We did not have enough time to look, but I still wonder
why she was coming down off that hill after midnite with a shovel in
her hand on a foggy nite dressed like it was the 50's.<br>

Having a Gift<br>
<br>
By: deborah.parker@STDC.govt.nz<br>

Hi my name is Deborah and am from Australia but have resided in New
Zealand for over 20 years. I have seen ghosts, spooks apparitions
people &#8211; whatever you want to call them since I was small. My heart is
pounding as I&#8217;m writing this and have no idea why. I was just wasting
time at work and googled ghosts. I work in a library but I also milk
cows for a living. I don&#8217;t know how you do it in the states but here
the cows walk into what is known as a &#8220;stall&#8221; which resembles a long
concrete elevated path with kick rails and metal bars so you don&#8217;t lose
vital pieces of anatomy if the cows decide to kick or are upset. Cow
sheds are designed so the cows walk in on a slight angle in a file. The
other day at about the fourth row (we do 14 rows) I saw a man sitting
on a chair with his leg crossed over the other in the stall. I got the
distinct impression he was really happy to be there &amp; was enjoying
watching me bring the cows into the stall, the cows were already coming
in when I &#8220;saw&#8221; him so it&#8217;s impossible that he was there. The cows were
very calm and well behaved that day &amp; there was a very jovial
atmosphere among the three of us working that afternoon. <br>
I often felt my grandmother around after she had passed away. She sits
on my bed as she often would when alive, &amp; I smell her too. Of
tobacco lavender &amp; what I know now is brandy!!! Her special tea she
drank out of a lovely china cup. My husband &amp; I had shifted to the
first property we purchased together &amp; he started kicking at the
covers to get the &#8220;cat&#8221; off the bed &#8211; it was nana. I had told him about
this previously &amp; wasn&#8217;t fully convinced until he saw the cat on
the outside of the window &amp; nana stayed sitting there even after
the light was put on &amp; he could feel her sitting on his feet. I
think she was telling him to look after me.<br>
Now for the ugly stuff. As a child the man in the hat would come
sometimes wearing a cape very black &#8211; scared even as I type this.
Really malignant feeling when he is around &#8211; always at night, very
menacing. He sometimes approaches or lifts his coat/cape apart &#8211; more
often than not just stares full of hate out from under his hat. He
stands between the wall and the open door usually but have caught
glimpses of him in odd places like a small pot cupboard or suchlike. My
older brother mentioned he had seen the same man who acted in the same
way. I have read or heard of many people experiencing a similar thing.
He hasn&#8217;t really shown himself since I&#8217;ve lived with my husband &#8211; we&#8217;ve
been together 21 years this year.<br>
These experiences stopped for a while in my mid twenties I think.<br>

Chased after Florida Hunting Trip<br>
<br>
By: paul.e.wilson@navy.mil<br>
<br>
A friend of mine told me about something strange that happened to him
after a hunting trip in Florida.&nbsp; It happened on a dirt road
coming out of the everglades.&nbsp; It was late in the evening, between
9:30 and 10:00pm.&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend was riding in the back of a
pick-up truck with three of his buddies.&nbsp; It was a 4x4 pick-up and
they were driving at a fast pace, with everyone in the back bouncing
around all over the place.&nbsp; You know, a crazy, typical teenage
outing.&nbsp; About twenty yards back behind the truck, something came
out of the dense foliage onto the shoulder of the dirt road.&nbsp;
whatever it was, it was big, muscular, and was on all fours.&nbsp; It
was so dark in color that it was hard to see it, and It was facing away
from their truck.&nbsp; Someone decided to throw an empty beer bottle
at it, which shattered upon the ground at its feet.&nbsp; This seemed
to startle it and made it quite mad.&nbsp; It then turned and started
to run after the pick-up truck.&nbsp; At this point they noticed that
it had glowing red eyes, and to everyone's dismay, it was rapidly
gaining on the moving 4x4 vehicle.&nbsp; It finally got close enough
that it appeared to reach out and grab the rear bumper of the
vehicle.&nbsp; At exactly that same moment, the truck sharply turned to
the right, off of the dirt road, and onto highway U.S. 41.&nbsp; The
momentum of the turning vehicle&nbsp; flung whatever it was into the
air, where it came down and tumbled across the higway into the brush on
the left hand side, where it disappeared.&nbsp; At no point in time
were any of the witnesses clearly able to make out just what this thing
was.&nbsp; It was as if the shadows were chasing them.<br>

Acts of Revenge<br>
<br>
<br>
By: tripletnana1021@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
In 1993 my husband committed suicide.&nbsp; Our son was 14 yr. old at
the time.&nbsp; We had been married 18 years and had talked twice about
life after death and vowed that whoever went first would come back, if
possible, to let the other know they were there.&nbsp; Two weeks after
his death I had gone to a friends house.&nbsp; I took one of the 4
packs of cigarettes that my husband had left.&nbsp; I left instructions
for my son not to leave the house since a friend of his was coming
over.&nbsp; When I could not reach him by phone I returned home to
check on him.&nbsp; I could not find my cigs after that either in my
purse, the car, or my friends house.&nbsp; So I opened another pack of
his.&nbsp; The next morning I went to the grocery store.&nbsp; When I
returned home I sat my purse on a bench in the kitchen and put the
groceries away.&nbsp; I went back to my purse for a cig and found not
only the 2nd pack that I had opened but also the first one that had
disappeared laying on the top of my purse where they weren't 10 minutes
before.&nbsp; And, of course, I was the only one at home.&nbsp; I was
sure that it was my husband so I asked him to stop.&nbsp; Nothing
happened...for a while.&nbsp; As time went on, little things would
happen that neither my son or I had done.&nbsp; About 2 or 3 years went
by when one day my son was playing a baseball game on his Sega Video
and came to me very upset and said that the word "Die" scrolled across
the bottom of the TV screen.&nbsp; Now this was a video game that he
had played many times with no problems.&nbsp; I went to check it out
and found nothing unusual.&nbsp; He was so u pset that he went outside
and would not come back in the house till about midnight.&nbsp; He
spent almost 11 hours outside before his girlfriend could persuade him
to come in.&nbsp; Two years later he and his new wife were living with
me until he was to leave for Basic Training.&nbsp; He was at work one
day and I had just laid down for a nap when my daughter-in-law came to
my door and asked me to please get up and come into the living room and
see "something".&nbsp; She wouldn't tell me what so I went in and sat
on the couch.&nbsp; I looked around the room and when my eyes landed on
the front door I immediately noticed that there was a skull on
it.&nbsp; I walked over and found that it was UNDER the varnish!!&nbsp;
My jaw fell open and I immediately covered it with newspaper.&nbsp;
When my son had his next day off he put in a new door and took the old
one out to the curb and even the neighbors saw it.&nbsp; There had
never been so much as one mark on that door before and there was
nothing on it when I went to lay down so in a matter of 15-20 minutes
it had become ingrained in the wood under the varnish.&nbsp; I found it
hard to believe that my late husband would do these cruel things to us
but I was convinced it was him since we had never had any occurances
before his death.&nbsp; Several years later I went to live with my son
and his 2nd wife.&nbsp; She informed me that she is physic but I really
didn't believe it too much without proof so I just said, "ok".&nbsp;
One night she and my son had friends over and they started talking
about "ghosts" and we started telling about the many things that
happened to us when all of a sudden my daughter-in-law says, "It's not
who you think it is!"&nbsp; I asked her what she was talking about and
she said that she'd tell me later.&nbsp; The next day she told me that
when we were talking about the skull on the door she began to get
really fast flashes of an older woman who was acting like she was
EXTREMELY mad.&nbsp; It was going so fast that it was like watching a
movie in fast forward.&nbsp; She said that she had never seen this
woman before but that she was the cause of all the things going on back
home.&nbsp; This woman was mad that my husband had killed his self and
was blaming me but that the best way to get to me was to go through my
son!!&nbsp; As we talked about it and she gave me the little bit of a
description that she had of her I realized that it was my husband's
sister that had died a year and a half before he had!!&nbsp; My
daughter-in-law tells me that since she has told me about her that she
seems to have calmed down but that she dwells in a dark place and may
never be able to go on but may still be in that house.&nbsp; I have
sold that house and only hope that the owners now don't have any
problems.&nbsp; And as far as my husband coming back....he has come to
me through my daughter-in-law and given me a message through her Spirit
Guide.&nbsp; Among other things, he said that he is sorry....and I
believe him (and her).&nbsp; All is forgiven.<br>

A True Believer<br>
<br>
By: bassplayer_ss_2002@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I've been reading all of these great stories on your site for almost a
year now. I thought I would share some of my own experiences. My family
has always been firm believers in ghost. We've all had encounters
somewhere at some point. I had my first encounters at a very young age.
Let me set the stage.<br>
The year was 1989. I was five years old. My mother and me had to move
in with my aunt and her three kids because she was struggling a bit
with money being a single parent and all. My aunt owned this two story
house. It was sturdy, but it was starting to show it's age. The main
thing that you really need to know about the house was that there was
only two bedrooms upstairs. One that was to the right and one to the
left.<br>
A couple of months of living there. I started to hear noises up stairs.
Just rustling and footsteps whenever nobody would be up there. Well
unfortunately my mother and I slept up there in the room on the right.
We slept in the floor and my cousin slept in the bed.<br>
One night my cousin and my mother was talking. It was really late
possibly going into the early morning hours. Everyone was asleep, but
us. My mother all of sudden tells everyone to be quiet. So we all
quieted down. We heard someone walking up the stairs. There was no door
to the rooms and our heads were pointing right at the entrance. Anyway
we heard someone walk into the room, but we couldn't see anything.<br>
All of sudden the pillow that we were using in the floor flattened down
like someone was standing on it. Me being five years old. I didn't know
what to think of this. I started asking my mother what was it. Then we
heard the footsteps move over to my cousins bedside near the window. It
was then we seen a shadow on the floor reflecting from the moonlight,
but there was nobody there. My cousin was almost in tears asking my
mother what was there. My mother just kept telling her to be quiet. We
then heard this "shadow" walk out of the room and back down the stairs.<br>
I don't remember much after the experience except my heart was racing.
I finally got back to sleep. My other experience is more simple, but
more frightening. This one was a few months after that other experience
in the same house. My mother and I had gotten the other bedroom all to
ourselves after my cousin moved out. One night as we were trying to get
to sleep in the bed. We heard someone walking up the stairs. My mother
was facing the entrance of the room. I had my back turned to it. <br>
All of sudden I feel this hand reaching under my neck and moving around
like it's looking for something. I told my mother to quit. She said she
hadn't done anything. Me being five years old. I didn't believe her. I
said you touched my neck. She again denied that she ever did. We both
then heard something walk out of the room and back down the stairs
again. We never did see anything though. The odd thing about that room
was that the corner of the room was pitch black at night. I've never
seen a place so dark before. It was unnerving even to me and I was only
five years old.<br>

Bright Light<br>
<br>

<br>
My name is Kizzy at this time I was only about 9 or 10 years old. But I
remember it just like it was yesterday. My mom and I were going threw
alot and she just started to date someone new. My mom and my real dad
never got married just dated when they had me and my brother which is
now 19 lives on his own. My mom has had 5 of us me, my 3 brothers and
my older sister. But one of my brothers passed away really young he was
only about I say 4 to 5 months old he died cause his heart and lungs
weren't fully developed, He died 4 days before my birthday October
14th. Anyway...My mom and step dad and my other brother were gone out
to eat and I was in the living room waiting for them to come home. I
was sitting there infront of the T.V. watching cartoons.....when all of
a suddun the kitchen light started to flicker a lil then stopped, and
the T.V. all of a suddun went off. I reached to the remote and tryed to
turn it back on, but the T.V. wouldn't go back on so I checked to make
shure that it was plugged in all the way, it was! Then out the corner
of my right eye I see a light and didn't know if it was comming from
the back of the T.V. again. It kept comming closer and closer. I got
really scared and started to tear cause i didn't know what to do. It
stopped infront of me (the light was like a small flash-light), but it
became a figure and it appeared to be holding something, I don't know
what or who the figure was but it was holding a baby, and I reconized
that it was my baby brother that had died and it was eather a angel or
something else showing me that he was ok and safe. I started to cry, my
mom had walked in and the light disapeared. I didn't know what to do or
how to explain it to my mom. But everytime I try telling my mom she
just gets mad at me. I really don't know how to explain this but all I
do know is that it wasn't a dream and now every year I see that light
appear all of the time now on the day he died and every time/year i see
him he always is older. Im 20 years old now and this happened to me
about 11 years ago. I still freak out a little bit everytime i see him
but i know he's there to show me that he is protecting us meaning me
and my mom and the rest of us. Thank you so much for reading this I
really hope someone reads this!!!<br>

HAPPENINGS AT THE HOUSE I GREW UP IN<br>
<br>
By: James56435@cs.com<br>
<br>
Around Christmas of 1952 we moved into a house in a mill village in
Rome, GA.&nbsp; The name of the village was Celanese.&nbsp; The company
made Rayon.<br>
I didn't see or hear anything in this house before I went into the U.
S. Army but one of my brothers did.&nbsp; He said one night as he lay
in bed he saw an older man standing in the small hallway between the
living room and the bedroom.&nbsp; He said he had a round brim hat on
like older men wore during that period of time.&nbsp; He thought it was
our dad's dad because he wore a hat like that.&nbsp; He said he got up,
turned the light on, he wasn't there anymore.&nbsp; He said he did this
three times before when he turned the lights back off he wasn't there
anymore.&nbsp; We later heard a story about an older man living there
with his granddaughter and her husband.&nbsp; We were told they
mistreated him and took money from him.<br>
When I got back from the service I heard the story about how in the
middle of the night a loud bang woke everyone in the house up.&nbsp;
They said it sounded like somebody dropped a large logging chain onto
the floor.&nbsp; Dad had got up and could find nothing that could have
made the sound.<br>
When I divorced from my first wife I stayed a few weeks with my
parents.&nbsp; One night as I was in bed going to sleep something hit
my ashtray stand very hard.&nbsp; I think every hair on my body stood
straight up.&nbsp; I got up and could find nothing.&nbsp; I just got it
out of my mind and went to sleep.<br>
My mother was laying in bed one night on her back.&nbsp; She said
something or someone was pinching her toes.&nbsp; She thought it was my
brother who was living with her at the time.&nbsp; She called out to
him but he had been in his room the whole time.<br>
My father was bedridden for a number of years in this house.&nbsp; He
used a walking cane hook-end to pull the drapes back so he could look
outside.&nbsp; After he died (he died in the hospital) my wife and I
were at the house.&nbsp; We were in the kitchen and I could see into
the living room where my dad had his bed set up.&nbsp; My wife, mother,
my brother who was living with mother, and I were all in the
kitchen.&nbsp; I just happened to look into the living room and noticed
the drapes moving slowly.&nbsp; I asked the others to look and they saw
the same thing I saw.&nbsp; It was like the hook-end of the walking
cane was moving the drapes.&nbsp; There was no fan, window, or door
that could have caused this.<br>
My wife and I visited my mother one day.&nbsp; They went for a walk, I
was alone in the house.&nbsp; I was watching TV and I was very
interested in what I was watching.&nbsp; All of a sudden I could feel
the presence of someone or something standing next to my chair.&nbsp; I
just turned the TV off, got up and went out on the front porch.&nbsp; I
left the front door open but I didn't feel the presence anymore.<br>
My brother that was living with my mother took his own life in February
1993.&nbsp; After that when my wife went to the bathroom at the house
she didn't want to close the door so she would have me stand close by
so no one else would come in on her.&nbsp; While I was standing there I
could see through the small hallway into the bedroom.&nbsp; I just
happened to look and see in front of chest-of-drawers was something
like I had never seen.&nbsp; It had two box shapes and a source of
energy was coming out of each box.&nbsp; The energy looked sort of like
heat coming off pavement but not vertical, it was going
horizontal.&nbsp; The top box started just above the chest-of-drawers,
where it ended the bottom box joined it at the bottom right of the top
box, left top of the bottom box.&nbsp; I read where other people have
seen sightings like this one.&nbsp; People didn't believe me until they
found out other sightings had been made.<br>
There are a few others but maybe I may send them later.&nbsp; <br>

Space Cowboy...<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; brooks04@nctc.com<br>
<br>
This is my story of the space cowboy...In May of 2005 my family and I
rented a place not knowing what was hiding behind closed doors...We had
been living there a couple of months when I started seeing different
spirits but the one that stands out the most is the space cowboy (as I
call him)...It first began as just a glimpse from the corner of my eye,
then to shadows on the wall in the hallway, then one early morning
(2:00-3:00) I got out of bed to go to the bathroom and as soon as I
opened my bedroom door there he was at my daughters bedroom door he
acted like he was turning the door knob to enter her room where she was
fast asleep and the instant that he saw me it was just as though he
vanished right into her room right through the door...He has also been
seen coming out of my bedroom he always has a black trench coat and a
big black cowboy hat wearing black cowboy boots...He is always dressed
in black...When I say something about the events to my companion he
just acts like I've totally lost my mind, but I know what I see and he
is there...I have experienced a couple of other ghostly encounters as
well...One morning again around (2:00-3:00) I was awakened by some
unknown reason and standing by my companions side of the bed were two
little girls with their arms around each other they looked about
6&amp;10 years old...They both were just standing there looking
straight at him they stood there for seems like forever but it was
probably just a few minutes and they both just vanished but the little
girls wasn't a dark spirit they looked just like two normal little
girls...So it makes me kinda wonder if maybe these spirits in my home
may be some what connected?<br>
I do know that years ago the place we live in had caught fire but that
is all I know...Thanks for taking the time to read my story...<br>

The Ghost of My Grandparents' House<br>
<br>
By: mboharsik@gmail.com <br>
<br>
First off here is a little bit of history. My grandparents bought a
house up in York, Maine, right on the coast (litterally). They have had
it for around 10 to 15 years. When they first moved in, they found
letters in a trunk in the attic, all of which were signed by a Brad.
Now back to the present. I have had two experiences with who my family
calls Brad. They both happened in the same week I stayed up there. The
first accurance was when I was going to sleep. I had just gotten into
bed and I could see light through the crack between the door frame and
the door. I naturally assumed that my grandfather had stayed up late to
watch a football game or some golf, be cause I could here that faint,
piercing sound the television makes when it is on, and I could also
here some kind of sportcaster giving updates to the fans. I went to
sleep before the television was turned off. The following morning, I
told my experience to my grandparents and my two cousins, who stayed up
there also. No one had heard anything like a television, but one of my
cousins said she did hear a faint, whispering voice calling here name
and saying things she couldn't make out. We were all spooked. The
second accurance actually happened the evening of that very day. We
were having the usual conversation at dinner and my cousin (the same
one who heard the voice) brought up the voice again. She said the
following: "Everyone, are you sure you didn't hear any voices last
night?" And out of nowhere, the lights went out. All of our nerves were
a little rattled again. They came back on within the next 10 minutes,
but we were all freaked out. From then on out, all I have had in that
house that had to do with ghosts are freaky dreams. But everything that
happened, we knew that it was Brad that did it. We aren't sure if he is
hostile or peaceful, but we are a little happy he is there to give us a
little excitement once in a while.<br>

At Grandma's House<br>
<br>

My name is Amy and i live in South Dakota.&nbsp; A year or so ago i was
at my grandmas house with my cousin Miranda and my grandma. Miranda and
i were sitting in her kitchen at the counter table watching tv and
eating chips. It was a little windy but not like crazy wind and all of
a sudden the window that was open slammed shut. I just sat there and
stared at my cousin and she just looked at me and was like what the
heck. And my grandma was like of that's just my friend. At that point
Miranda and i were just like ok whatever just thinking she was joking
with us. But she was serious. We're like what? And she told us it was
some guy...i don't remember his name, so i'll just call him Bob for
now! She was like oh that's just my friend Bob. And we're just like
what are you talking about? And then she told us like when she was
little every night before she went to bed like an indent was put in the
end of her bed like someone was sitting there...but nobodywas there. We
were freaked out at that point thinking she was crazy! But she's just
like all natural about it and she's like he won't hurt you...he's nice.
We're just like okay and just changed the subject. Then one day when i
was at my grandmas this year during school break i was at my grandmas
house on her computer...i thought i heard some one walking around
upstairs, but i just ignored it. Then a few minutes later i was sitting
there talking to some friends on MSN and listening to music, and the
drawer to my right slowly opened all the way. I was also on the phone
with my friend Mikayla. i freaked out and ran out of the house and sat
outside for like an hour. Then i went back in and went over to the
computer and shut the drawer...and did a little experiment. I shut it
and then i shook the desk to see if i like accidentally bumped it or
something...and i wouldn't open and when i opened it...i noticed it was
kind of sticky! So i was pretty freaked out about that! And then my
cousin Ashley, Miranda's older sister, said she was sleeping downstairs
on the couch, in the basement, and she said she saw someone standing in
the door way to another room right beside the stairs. But i haven't had
anything happen to me recently at my grandma's house. But at my own
house sometimes i feel like someone's just watching me when i'm on my
computer...it's kind of creepy. Then when our couch is in a certain
spot every few nights i sleep on it my left side of my face get's very
cold. But when i turn my head so it should be my right side of my face
getting cold...it never does. So then i just pull the covers over my
head! But even my cousins and friends that come out to my house say my
house is creepy. But nothing has happened recently either so that's a
good thing! I just ignore them all the time...and they just kind of go
away. But anyways just thought i'd share that with you. It's just weird
ya know.<br>

Voice in the Night<br>
<br>
By: Emma.Lehman@bunge.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Several years ago, my husband and I lived for a couple of years in an
extremely strange house.&nbsp; The entire time that we lived there you
would hear strange noises in the other part of the house.&nbsp; When
you were in the bedroom, it would sound like someone was turning the
television in the living room off and on and walking around.&nbsp;
Sometimes it would sound like someone was opening and closing the back
door.&nbsp; We pretty much ignored all of the strange noises.&nbsp; We
weren't the only ones to hear them - everyone that came over to our
house would hear them if they stayed long enough.<br>
After a while, my husband started hearing someone call his name.&nbsp;
I just thought that he was hearing things - it would always happen when
he was in a room alone.&nbsp; The voice always just called out his
name.&nbsp; The voice would call out his name frequently when he was in
the shower and a couple of times he thought that whatever he was
hearing was in the room with him.&nbsp; I made fun of him until one
night it happened to me.&nbsp; I got up in the middle of the night to
get something to drink.&nbsp; I didn't turn on any lights since there
was a street light right outside our kitchen window.&nbsp; While I was
reaching into the freezing compartment, someone said my name from right
behind me.&nbsp; I even felt the hair on the back of my neck move from
the sound.&nbsp; Whoever or whatever said my name was right behind
me!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; Of course, when I turned around to look there was no
one there.&nbsp; I have asked myself over and over again if the voice
was male or female - if it was someone that I recognized, but I have
never been able to answer those questions.&nbsp; After me moved from
that house, we have never heard voices anymore.<br>

A Series of Events<br>
<br>
By: gamer_froggy85@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what's going on with my house - if it's haunted or not, but here is some of the things that have happened me... <br>
First off I've lived in this house for 16 years. When I was younger and
even to this day everything I get up in the middle of the night to use
the bathroom I always had a feeling like someone was watching me. It
always started from the back of the front room and seemed to follow me
all the way to the bathroom. The feeling was so strong sometimes I felt
like I had to run before something caught me. <br>
Once when I was about 7 my sister and I were laying in our beds late at night. <br>
My sister had always been scared of this one baby doll my grandma
bought her for christmas, so she sat it up on the TV. Well as we were
getting ready to sleep the doll on the TV began to get up and walk
around. My sister and I was scared to death but we didn't bring it up
until years later. That experience gave me a permanantly phobia of
dolls. <br>
I've heard voices when no one was there, a lot of the time they seemed to be coming from the ceiling. <br>
I've heard my grandma (Who lives with us) call my name but when I've replied she tells me she never called me. <br>
One of the weirdest things is the little girl (or what I am assuming is
a little girl) that you can frequently hear sobbing in the hallway;
after my husband moved in, every time he sits down in the front room to
watch tv or write, he always sees a small shadow-like creature (the
little girl?) peeking around the corner at him out of the corner of his
eye.<br>
One night my sister saw and similar shadow crouching in the corner of her room. <br>
Later that night while she was sleeping she awoke feeling like someone
was holding her throat. Her best friend (Who was there that night) Said
she jumpped up gasping from air. <br>
Doors open on their own, voices can be heard when no one has said anything. <br>
Things move from one place to another or disappear competely. <br>
We've seen what some people have discribbed as "Shadow people" out in our back yard. <br>
In the garage things have touched my shoulder when&nbsp; no one is
there. When you turn the washer and dyer on, and come back the lids
will be back up. <br>
The lids open and bang by themselfs and something knocks on the garage door. <br>
Sometimes you can hear what sounds like my mom and dad in the bedroom singing <br>
opera but when you ask them about it they have no idea what your talking about. <br>
Things like this have happened for over 15 years, sometimes the house
is really active others times nothing will happen for months on end.<br>
Believe what you will and decide for yourself, to this day none of us have any explanation for this....<br>

Attic Footsteps<br>
<br>
By: nicoleritaju@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
For most of my childhood I was raised in a large victorian mansion,
with an expansive history that was hundreds of years old. I lived with
my younger brother by three years, and my parents. We all had seperate
bedrooms on the second floor of the house, and for the first ten years
of our life in the house our play room was on the third floor of the
house, in the attic. It was a tiny corner room with clown wallpaper,
and ancient blue carpeting. Since both of my parents were
buisnesspeople they were away on trips alot, and thus we hired a
move-in babysitter to care for us. Well, whenever we wanted to play
upstairs in the playroom our babysitter would sit on the steps and
watch us play, never entering the room itself. She later said that she
felt a presence there, like she was being constantly scrutinized. "Like
someone was constantly peering over her shoulder, watching her every
move." Although we were too young to pay attention to her, as I grew up
I began to realize the feelings that she had, and eventually I stopped
going up to the attic altogether. As my brother and I entered our
teenage years, there was no need for a babysitter. That's when the
"footsteps" started. For as long as I can remember my mother has told
us a story about the house's previous owners- a newly wed couple who
kept a farm in the expansive stretch of land that was now our backyard.
One day a horse bucked off its rider, the man who owned the house, and
the new groom, and then kicked him- delivering a deathblow to his body
that proved fatal. Apparently, my mother tried to talk to other owners
of the house in vain attempts to retrieve more information about its
vague history. There was only one family that had lived in our house
that was still in town, and when she attempted to ask them about it in
the restaraunt they owned, they only shook their heads and walked off.
As if it was something they dared not talk about. As if the house had
even more bad history. During a yard sale one summer a strange old man
came by and asked to see the inside of the house. As my mother gave him
a tour she discovered that he was once a young boy who had lived with
his many siblings in the house inside the attic, our playroom. My
mother explained the peculiar feelings people got when they entered
that room, and the man recalled that yes indeed there were strange
happenings up there. He claimed that he and a couple of his siblings
shared a room up there, and that at night sometimes they would feel as
though someone were staring at them, and would even see a shadowy
figure walking about. It was around this time that my parents trusted
my brother and I enough to leave us alone in the house. At night I
would hear footsteps not just in the attic but also on the second
floor, always one floor above my head. They were heavy, and rhythmic,
sounding like a man in boots, perhaps horse-rider's boots. After about
a month of keeping silent and wondering whether or not I was going
insane, I questioned my mother who was relieved to find that she wasn't
the only one noticing the noises. We agreed to contact her friend, a
priest to perform an exorcism. The priest arrived and did a ritual, and
I expected the footsteps to stop. They were getting louder and louder
each night, almost as if with a growing confidence. The last straw for
me was when my brother and I (my brother a non-believer at the time)
were alone while my parents were out one evening. We heard the heaviest
thumps above us. As if someone were not only walking across the floor
but stomping angrily above our heads. My brother was scared and I took
a china angel off the mantle and handed it to him. Stay here, hold her,
and pray. I'll be right back. I told him. I carefully walked up the
steps and looked around the rooms on the second floor. I called out,
"is anyone here?" wondering if perhaps it was a worker (my mother had
hired some painters). Nobody answered. I looked out a window and saw
that the driveway was empty. There was nobody in this house except us.
I went back downstairs and prayed with my brother as the thumping
continued. Finally my parents came home. The thumping continued months
after that but we all became accustumed to it. It was apparent that the
ghost was making no attempt to harm us, so we ignored the noises. As
we've recently moved into another house, a large colonial built only a
couple years ago but that sits on Indian land, the footsteps appear to
have followed us. In the attic, mostly at night, we still hear the
gentle patterns of "John" as the ghost is called walking about.<br>

Baby Ghosts<br>
<br>

<br>
My story takes place in Ireland, where I live. I now live in the Dublin
but until I was 17 I lived in my family home in the countryside. My
house is about sixty years old. When we bought it, it was just a
bungolo, we built an upstairs on to it that contained a bathroom and
three bedrooms. My parents and two sisters slept upstairs in the new
part of the house. I slept in the only bedroom downstairs, in the old
part of the house. <br>
My bedroom, was always unnaturally cold. Summer or winter it was always
icy. It would not matter how much I turned up the heat or plugged
electric heaters in, it would always be freezing. As I was the only one
sleeping downstairs I tried not to think why it was always so cold,
when the rest of the old part of the house was always warm and cosy.
What used to freak me out so much was when I would be in bed at night,
nearly asleep I would feel something sit on my bed by my feet. This
scared me so bad and would happen nearly every night. The nights it
would happen I would kick at it and it would go. I would be so scared
that I would sleep with light on or not sleep at all.<br>
My brother died four years ago from a heart disorder that no one knew
about until it was to late. He was the only boy and the youngest. We
were all terribly upset when he died. He died three weeks before his
second birthday. He died in the sitting room (which is in the old part
of the house). Anytime someone would go through the sitting room in the
early hours of the morning (to get to the kitchen you had to go through
the sitting room), they would all see something in the corner of their
eye, or catch a glimpse of a light or even smell milk! (As my brother
was so young when he died he still drank bottles). It would always be
in the part of room were he sat playing. However his presence was felt
after his death, the one in my room had been there since we moved in.<br>
Another presence felt was in the kitchen, also in the old part of the
house. My mam was a housewife and would be home alone during the day
while we were at school and dad was at work. The presence in the
kitchen would follow her while she cleaned and cooked. She always felt
the presence strongest, when she baked, especially whilst baking apple
pies. This presence was also there long before my brother died. <br>
Well just a few weeks ago my parents moved out of the house. I had
moved out a while now and my family were moving to Spain. On my parents
last night in the house they slept in my old room, the cold room. My
mam was nearly asleep when she felt an amazing presence behind her, on
what would be my dads side of the bed. She kept her eyes close and
begged whatever was there to go away. It was not a bad presence, none
of them were but she still did want to see it. The next morning she
told my dad what happened. He said that at that time he felt something
small rub his leg. It was just before they left my dad decided to tell
us about our houses history. Apparently one of the previous owners had
been an old lady who lived in the house for most of her married life.
She died on day in the Kitchen. The couple who lived there before us
had a baby girl who died in her sleep at 8 months old. She died in my
room.<br>
We figured the old lady liked to watch my mam work and the baby was the
one who sat on my bed but there was one thing we never figured out.
When my youngest sister was baby and right up until she was 3, she used
to stare at a spot in the sitting room ceiling. We know she did see
something because she used to giggle, laugh and stare for ages at it.
Stranger still is when she was 3 she got cancer and nearly died. The
doctors said her recovery was a miracle. <br>
If anyone thinks they know what this was, please email me. I&#8217;d love to know what it was. All comments are invited.<br>
