<b>Grandfathers Haunted Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CandieHalli00@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I do believe in the supernatural. I have had several experiences
with this</b>
<br><b>subject. At firstI thought I was imagining these things or that
I was crazy.</b>
<br><b>I later learned that I was not the only one that was experiencing
these</b>
<br><b>things. For as long as I can remember my grandfather's house has
been</b>
<br><b>haunted. I and many other family members have seen, and heard stranges</b>
<br><b>things. I know for a fact that there are three ghosts living in
the house</b>
<br><b>with my family. There is a woman and two men. They never have physically</b>
<br><b>harmed us or done anything bad so we have been believing that they
are there</b>
<br><b>to protect us. They do things like open and shut doors repeatedly,
the rooms</b>
<br><b>get cold at times, the lights flicker, we hear voices, etc. One
time in</b>
<br><b>particular I was sitting in my mother's room watching T.V.. I suddenly
heard</b>
<br><b>someone call out my name.&nbsp; At first I thought I was just hearing
things, but</b>
<br><b>it happened again, and then again. I knew that no one was home so
I thought</b>
<br><b>it might be someone at the door. I got up to check the door. It
was closed,</b>
<br><b>and when I looked out there was no sign of anyone. Another time,
more recent,</b>
<br><b>my little sister had a lamp that was sitting on her dresser. She
had draped a</b>
<br><b>little blanket over it so that her room would be dim. My mom told
her that it</b>
<br><b>might start a fire, but my sister didn't listen. As she was sitting
on her</b>
<br><b>bed about to go to sleep, the lamp flew off the dresser and broke
in half. My</b>
<br><b>little sister has told me many times that sometimes at night when
she is</b>
<br><b>sleeping she will look up and see the two men sitting there watching
her.</b>
<br><b>Everyone that comes to visit has experienced some sort of wierd
happenings. I</b>
<br><b>don't know why they are there, or even who they are. I have often
wondered</b>
<br><b>that. I do know that they did not start haunting the house till
after my</b>
<br><b>grandmother passed away.</b>
<br><b>Another experience was at my mother's boyfriends house. I was sitting
on a</b>
<br><b>chair in the corner of the living room, and from that chair you
could see the</b>
<br><b>bathroom mirror. My moms' boyfriend's sister was sitting with me.
It was late</b>
<br><b>at night, and we were just watching a movie. Suddenly from the corner
of my</b>
<br><b>eyes I saw a white light coming from the bathroom. I turned to look,
and I</b>
<br><b>saw a white face in the mirror starring at me. Of course my reaction
was that</b>
<br><b>I was seeing things, so I tapped the girl's lap that was sitting
with me. I</b>
<br><b>asked her if she saw it, and she said yes. She looked harder and
said that it</b>
<br><b>looked like her grandfather. I got scared and ran to the couch to
sit by my</b>
<br><b>mom's friend. After a couple of minutes I heard a knock on the door.
I told</b>
<br><b>my mom's boyfriend, and he told me to get it. I opened the door,
and standing</b>
<br><b>there infront of me was a huge German Shepard. I got scared and
ran to tell</b>
<br><b>my mom and her boyfriend. My mom's boyfriend's mother advised us
to set food</b>
<br><b>out for it, and leave the door open so it could come in. We did
as she said</b>
<br><b>and I ran back to the couch. The dog did not touch the food, instead
came</b>
<br><b>into the house. He went into every room in the house except that
bathroom. He</b>
<br><b>just stood at the door growling. The dog stayed there all night
and in the</b>
<br><b>morning it was gone. We never saw that dog again. I don't know what
the</b>
<br><b>meaning of all that was, or even what was going on. I just know
from that day</b>
<br><b>on I never used the bathroom there.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Children are Sensitive</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: freakygirl2006@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I read your artical on children and ghosts. It reminded me
of a horrifing</b>
<br><b>experience that happened to me about 3 years ago when i was 10.
i was</b>
<br><b>setting in the dinning room with, I think my father and my brother.
they</b>
<br><b>where playing around and wrestling on the floor, when a dark image
apeared</b>
<br><b>in the corner. i looked around to make sure it wasn't the shadow
of our cat,</b>
<br><b>it wasn't. I looked away and told myself " it's just my imagination"
when i</b>
<br><b>looked back up it was still there, I was so terrified i just stared
at it</b>
<br><b>for, what seem like hours,but was only about 5-10 minutes until
it finally</b>
<br><b>fadded away....</b>
<br><b>My cat will no even set foot next to that corner anymore.</b>
<br><b>surprisingly that corner is unusually warm.</b>
<br><b>I get the chills when I walk through that room still, 3 years later.
I am</b>
<br><b>only 13 so i can't exactly go out and hire ghost hunters or anything.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, and there is something I haven't told you an experience
something</b>
<br><b>like this one happened 3 years earlier when i was 7. That experience
was not</b>
<br><b>as horrifing because i was not old enough to understand what was
happening</b>
<br><b>to me. I t started when i turned off mt walkie talkies and when
up stairs,</b>
<br><b>about 5 minutes later i went back down stairs to find my walkie
talkies on</b>
<br><b>making a very static noise. this happened about 3 more time until
i finally</b>
<br><b>removed the batteries from them.</b>
<br><b>It seems like a scary thing happens to me about every 3 years. I
only wonder</b>
<br><b>if someting will happen this year.</b>

<p><b>Spirits</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: d_martin@wmur.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Hello there. My name is Derek. I have experianced the paranormal</b>
<br><b>ever since I was a young lad. I'm 25 now. It all started where I
was born. I</b>
<br><b>don't remember the exact st. but it was in Queens NY. Our old house
always</b>
<br><b>kept the family buisy. Constant doors opening , slamming shut, noises
you</b>
<br><b>can't explain even visual sights such as the Spring day when my
mother was</b>
<br><b>going down the basement to do laundry (standing at the top of the
staircase</b>
<br><b>from the top step you could see a window. The staircase was a single
spiral</b>
<br><b>staicase) Well, she was going down stairs not paying much attention
and</b>
<br><b>noticed the curtains on the window blowing . Not thinking of it
she passed</b>
<br><b>by thinking it must be windy today. Then it clicked in Wait, there
are no</b>
<br><b>curtains in the window. She turned around and nothing was there.Things
like</b>
<br><b>that happened alot. They ,( the spirits stayed with my brother alot)
My</b>
<br><b>brother always saw images when he was young He's three years older
than I</b>
<br><b>am. Such images as once we were playing in the backyard and my brother
came</b>
<br><b>running in the house screaming to my mother The plane is going to
kill us.</b>
<br><b>My mom calmed him down and that was that. Only that night I'm not
sure where</b>
<br><b>but out west a commuter plane crashed into the backyard of a farm
killing</b>
<br><b>two children playing and everone on board the plane. I kid you not
this is</b>
<br><b>true. Also when he was young he used to tell my parents and everone
that</b>
<br><b>they had colors around them. He knew when someone was mad or happy.
Red mad</b>
<br><b>blue happy yellow calm. I'm sure you picked up on this. He saw peoples</b>
<br><b>Auras. We now Live in New Hampshire. My brother and I have been
here the</b>
<br><b>better parts of our lives. Ive been here since i was four. But it
didn't end</b>
<br><b>here. All was quiet until 1991. My brother was sleeping and (back
then My</b>
<br><b>dad came home late and he always checked up on us. It used to piss
my</b>
<br><b>brother off because my dad had two zillons keys on his keychain
on his belt</b>
<br><b>and the noise the keys made used to wake us up.) Anyway, One night
as usual</b>
<br><b>he heard dad come home. The damn keys he just acted like he was
sleeping</b>
<br><b>then he felt my dad sit on the foot side of the bed. He put two
and two</b>
<br><b>together and wait, that part of the bed was against the wall. He
looked up</b>
<br><b>and saw a flash then turned on his light and a the corner of the
bed there</b>
<br><b>were imprants as if someone was sitting there. then they popped
up leaving</b>
<br><b>the bed back to it's normal state. (Now by now you might be getting
the</b>
<br><b>chills , I am just writng about it but the funny thing is my brother
went</b>
<br><b>back to bed and told us the story the next morning.(This stuff was
like</b>
<br><b>second nature to him and it didn't faze him much) The family believes
the</b>
<br><b>spirits are following my brother. Don't get me wrong my brother
is totaly</b>
<br><b>normal but when he's gone usually all is well. When he comes home
the fun</b>
<br><b>starts again. Although he is married now and stuff still happens
so we</b>
<br><b>decided to check up on the area. Just as I thought old papers say
the</b>
<br><b>cemetary about eight acres from our house used to be a lot bigger.
What do</b>
<br><b>you think? I just recently got married 10/16/00 and i'm moved out
now and</b>
<br><b>all is well for now and I hope it stays that way. This is a true
story and I</b>
<br><b>don't want others to think it's a hoax . This story does make you
think</b>
<br><b>though doesn't it?</b>
<br><b>Write back and tell me what you think</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By: angelwings211@lycos.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This ghost experience happened about
5 years ago. Me and my family lived in a big old house that was at least
80 or 90 years old.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had just moved to this little
town in California that not many people knew about.&nbsp; We knew our landlady
very well and she had told us that her husband (which had passed away not
long before then) grew up in that house with many brothers and sisters.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first few weeks we had lived
there nothing majorly paranormal happened..... but just a few little odd
things that we didnt pay much attention to.&nbsp; Like a few nights while
we were all eating dinner.... the dining room ligth kept on flashing on
and off.... but we didn't expect any paranormal activity... we just thought
it was because of the age of the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We first started getting suspicius when
in the middle of the night, all the sinks and faucets in the house would&nbsp;
turn on full blast and we would have to get up and turn them all off.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another time while we were all about to
go to sleep, our electricity went out.&nbsp; We all thought it was just
a power outage so my dad went back to turn the breaker swiches back on
.&nbsp; After we all got back in our beds we heard a big "FLIP" ... that
was the sound of someone turning off the breaker swiches.&nbsp; Me and
my sister went in the back room to turn them back on.&nbsp; While we were
heading out of the back room i screamed and my sister looked at what i
was looking at... it was a little boy standing in the corner of the back
room.&nbsp; We ran out of there and told our mom but you know how moms
are..."it was nothing".... but we both knew it was something.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few other things started to happen
that convinced my mom that our housse was not normal.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night when my aunt and uncle came over.me,
my sister and my aunt were sitting on the couch when we saw a little naked
boy run across the kitchen!&nbsp; We all thought it was my little brother
but then my brother came out of his room screaming because he saaw a figure
of a blck crow flying around his room.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We always saw this little boy but
we had a feeling he wasnt an evil ghost he was just a playful little boy.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of the times we would set something
on the table and the next minute it would be gone, we would look everywhere
but it wasnt anywhere! A few times our clocks would be set like 4 hours
off the real time, and&nbsp; our clocks would run even with no batteries
..and also our washer and dryer would be runnning with nothing in .nobody
would want to stay the nigth or come over for dinner.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of my friends and I ran over
to her house to get something that she needed....she lived next door...we
had never told her about our ghost...but while we were comeing back to
my house....she started screaming and ran into my house... i asked her
what happened and she said she saw a little kid sitting on my roof.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few times while stting down somewhere
we would feel a very cold draft run through the house.at that time we were
fully convinced that we had a little ghost boy living in our house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before we had moved from that house
we where cleaning out out garrage .me and my brother found a small set
of footprints..it looked like a little boys foot prints.it looked like
the footprints of a 3 or 4 year old child.... ingraved in the cement..and
unnder the footprints was a name, it was "Billy".</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had lived 4 full years in that house
with a little boy named Billy.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Mrs. Ellis</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:andy@casco.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have a story I'd like to tell. Just some details really. Apparently,
my</b>
<br><b>family lived in a haunted house when I was a baby. My Dad claims
that a lady</b>
<br><b>named Mrs. Ellis who had died in the house several years before
we moved in</b>
<br><b>haunted it. There was also a dog, I don't know wethor it was Mrs
Ellis' or</b>
<br><b>not. Mom and Dad have always told me stories about their expiriences
in that</b>
<br><b>house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; To start, we had two dogs. Dad would put them in the
garage whenever they</b>
<br><b>went to bed or when they went out. Witout fail, the dogs would be
let out of</b>
<br><b>the garage by an unknown entity.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Ellis seemed to be very attracted to me.
My grandfather had built a</b>
<br><b>crib for me that would rock. During the night Mrs. Ellis would rock
me,</b>
<br><b>somtimes she did it so hard that I would roll over on my side, waking
me up</b>
<br><b>and consequently waking up mom and dad. Dad would get up and put
in the</b>
<br><b>wooden pin which kept the crib from rocking. This usually lasted
only a few</b>
<br><b>hours before Mrs. Ellis would remove the pin and begin to rock me
again.</b>
<br><b>This eventually prompted my Dad to install a steel bolt which Mrs.
Ellis was</b>
<br><b>unable to remove.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mom claims that my room was always cold, even with
the heat on. But</b>
<br><b>strangely, I was always warm. There were several occasions when
a dog could</b>
<br><b>be heard snuffling through the hallway.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Once my grandmother came to stay with us. During the
night she was</b>
<br><b>awakend by the sound of a dog scratching and sniffing about just
outside her</b>
<br><b>room. She called out to my Dad, "Art, one of dogs is still in the
house." To</b>
<br><b>this my dad replied, "No Helen, both dogs are in the garage." Unsatisfied</b>
<br><b>with this, my grandmother got up and went to check the garage. Sure
enough</b>
<br><b>both dogs were there. Grandma became a believer that night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; My mom would lose her book sometimes. After some time
she learned that if</b>
<br><b>she stood in the living room and siad loudly, "Now where in the
world did my</b>
<br><b>book go? I know I left it here on the coffee table." Then leave
the room for</b>
<br><b>a moment, then return, the book (or whatever she was looking for)
would be</b>
<br><b>there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the things I remember my parents telling
me. The haunting did</b>
<br><b>end when my mom surmised that Mrs. Ellis was still in her house
because she</b>
<br><b>had died prematurly and was worried about her daughters she'd left
behind.</b>
<br><b>So before we moved, Mom sat in the middle of the room and waited.
Soon the</b>
<br><b>room grew cold and mom knew Mrs. Ellis was there. She then told
Mrs. Ellis</b>
<br><b>about each of her daughters, that they were doing fine and that
they were</b>
<br><b>well cared for. She told her that they did not need her anymore
and that if</b>
<br><b>she wanted to go to heaven, it was okay. After a moment the room
grew warm</b>
<br><b>again.</b>

<p><b>The Ghost of Henrietta, Okolona, Mississippi</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lydia@kfcu.org</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have never written about this but have told this story many times.&nbsp;
In Okolona, MS about 15 miles south of Tupelo on alt hwy 45 (Church St)
there is an old delapidated Antebellum home.&nbsp; I am sure it was quite
beautiful in its day.&nbsp; It is said that it is haunted by a ghost whose
the name of Henrietta.&nbsp; We are not sure about the last name but we
believe it was Gilliam.&nbsp; Mrs. Gilliam's husband was a high ranking
officer in the Confederate Army and was often away.&nbsp; They had no children
and her closest companions were her house slaves whom she treated well.&nbsp;
One day a trusted servant came to her to warm her that the field slaves
were planning an uprising and urged her to leave because they would kill
her.&nbsp; "Never will I run!" she said.&nbsp; She loaded all the guns
she had in the house and placed a rocking chair on the balcony overlooking
the front lawn.&nbsp; She waited and she rocked back and forth in her chair.&nbsp;
Late in the night she saw little glimmers of light in the distance.&nbsp;
As she watched these glimmers of light they came closer and closer.&nbsp;
She realized it was the field hand with torches coming to burn her house
down.&nbsp; Closer they came until she could see their faces.&nbsp; The
slaves were unprepared for what happened next.&nbsp; Henrietta shot every
one of the slaves who attemped to approach her house.&nbsp; Many of the
slaves ran away.&nbsp; It is said that she rewarded her house servants
handsomely for their loyalty but dealt with the remaining field hands severly.&nbsp;
It is also said that if you go to this house late at night and sit very
quietly you can here the sound of her rocking chair on the front balcony
because she is still protecting her home.&nbsp; One fact about this house
that is true is Nathan Bedford Forrest recupperated in this house after
suffering injuries from a battle fought near Okolona and that from time
to time is was used as a hospital for confederate soldiers.</b>
<br><b>About four years ago at Thanksgiving some family members and I were
discussing the history of the house and decided to go through it.&nbsp;
Yes, we were trespassing.&nbsp; The front and back doors were wide open.&nbsp;
I was amazed at the beauty of some of the architectural work.&nbsp; As
we went exploring we noticed two rooms that were extremely cold.&nbsp;
Cold enough to raise the hair on the backs of our necks like someone was
watching us.&nbsp; One small room off from kitchen and a large bedroom
upstairs on the southeastern corner of the house.&nbsp; A huge white owl
came out of nowhere scaring us half to death.&nbsp; We fled from the house.&nbsp;
Personally, I think Henrietta's spirit resided in the owl.&nbsp; The house
is listed on the register of historic homes and is currently owned by Gary
Carnathan, an attorney in Tupelo.&nbsp; The people who were raised in the
area would love to see the house renovated and preserved because it has
such a rich history.</b>
<br><b>Well, this is my story of a hauted house.&nbsp; On the folklore
of the house I don't know what is actually true and what is myth but I
do know that entering that house can wreak havok on one's nerves.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Sighting?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: leww1@fmtc.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About ten years ago I lived in Keno, Oregon, which
is about 12 miles</b>
<br><b>west of Klamath Falls.&nbsp; Keno is a small town (population &lt;
1000) that</b>
<br><b>sprung out of a logging community in the latter half of the</b>
<br><b>19th-century.&nbsp; Before this land was settled by the pioneers
it was</b>
<br><b>hunted and inhabited by the Klamath Indians.&nbsp; From what I understand
the</b><b></b>
<p><b>tribe suffered an epidemic of bubonic plague in the mid 1800's.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; In the house I lived in, which had been assembled from two
of the old</b>
<br><b>logger bunk houses and renovated for dwelling, I believe I had a</b>
<br><b>sighting.&nbsp; I used to be very skeptible about the existance
of ghosts.</b>
<br><b>About six months after I moved in I saw dark figure with a discernable</b>
<br><b>body figure that passed across an entry way wiith animated movement.</b>
<br><b>The sighting was preceede by a cold sensattion that made all the
hair on</b>
<br><b>my body stand up.&nbsp; Somehow I knew just where to fix my eyes.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>continued having these sightings, though not regulary but always
around</b>
<br><b>11:00p.m. and in the same location.&nbsp; I still was'nt convinced,
thinking</b>
<br><b>maybe the first sighting? predisposed me to the others by some sort
of</b>
<br><b>conditioning.&nbsp; It was'nt untill I was visiting with a friend
and we had</b>
<br><b>a simultaneous experience, ( cold, hair standing on end, sighting),
that</b>
<br><b>I became more assured that I had seen something.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp; My experiance with ghost is small, but i know enough to understand
what the heck is happening to me...</b>
<br><b>ever since i was a little kid, i have been plagued by hauntings
of all kinds, i have dreamed the dreams and seen the horrors.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; i think my own tale begins when i was four or five...</b>
<br><b>i was watching tv when my moms boy friend started talking to some
one i couldnt see, i thouht he was crazy but none the less i looked around
to see what the hell he was talking to. confused i saw a small blonde figure
siting in the nook of a door, but the only blonde person in my house at
the time was my mother, who was NOT in the house.</b>
<br><b>she was out side watering the lawn.</b>
<br><b>for years i have witnesed many things, too many, some to my horror,
some to my utmost confusion.</b>
<br><b>the most recent of my experiances happen to have started two or
three months ago...</b>
<br><b>i moved into a new house in a little town, and being the new kid,
hated it, i still do.</b>
<br><b>the occurences of the creatures suprised me at first, because most
apperations do not attack me.</b>
<br><b>i wondered why it would appear when i was takeing out the trash,
or looking in a mirror, the creature, being what it is, stands at least
3'4, totaly black, and crazy as hell.</b>
<br><b>my worst experiance happend when i was sleeping two weeks ago.</b>
<br><b>my dream started out as they all do, the figure standing there arms
crossed accrossed its chest, and stareing fixidly at a point in the gorund,
and try as i might, i cant get its attention. this dream though, took a
unexpected twist, the figure began to moan, and then scream as a blade
was stabed into its gut again and again until the ground was coated with
a thick layer of blood.</b>
<br><b>when i woke up, i heard the sounds, the foot steps, and the strange
garrgleing sounds, then the figure, standing to the side of my bed.</b>
<br><b>these occurenses have become common place for me, the sudden move
of a lifeless object, like a trash can, no longer scares me. but the Creature
deos, and so do the Dreams...</b>
<br><b>i have tried many things to make them go away, but none work.</b>

<br><b>Uncle Johnny</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Bwitt@destinypc.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was young, about kindergarden age , my uncle Johnny came to
live</b>
<br><b>with us. He was in poor health due to working in an asbestos factory.
He had</b>
<br><b>developed asbestotis. I used to go to Kmart to get the doctors bags
(for kids)</b>
<br><b>and made him eat all the candy pills to "make him better". I had
gotten&nbsp; to</b>
<br><b>the point that I would not go to school as&nbsp; long as he was
with us.</b>
<br><b>He used to take me around my fathers yard and hold me up to smell
all the</b>
<br><b>roses that my father had planted. my father was an avid gardner
;this was a</b>
<br><b>man who could drop a seed and it would bloom.</b>
<br><b>Anyway my dad and uncle would call me "skinny minny'" as I was so
pittifly</b>
<br><b>skinny.</b>
<br><b>On Christmas day we got a call from Johnnys wife saying that he
had died on</b>
<br><b>Christmas Eve. That was the first time I had ever seen my father
cry.</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>To get to the real part of the story,when I was 10 yrs old I developed
phenumonia.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I was in very serious condititon, I was placed in intensive
care</b>
<br><b>in the pediatric area.</b>
<br><b>I was in a room off the side, the premature babies were in the outter
room</b>
<br><b>and I was in a small room off to the right.</b>
<br><b>My room had paneling about half way up.The rest of the top of the
wall was</b>
<br><b>was glass so that the nurses could see me.I could remember that
I had a</b>
<br><b>heart monoter on me, the light would flash off and on. I remember
that I</b>
<br><b>had awaken to look at the light. The next thing I noticed was that
I saw</b>
<br><b>my uncle Johnny standing at the foot of my bed. I dont remember
being ]</b>
<br><b>afraid at all. He looked at me and said "dont worry Minny, you'll
be ok."</b>
<br><b>You have to understand that the next things that happened all at
the same</b>
<br><b>time.I was young and sick but I can recall this as if it happened
yesterday.</b>
<br><b>The heart monitor had a flashing light that caught my eye. At the
same moment,</b>
<br><b>I heard a woman scream. When&nbsp; I looked back Johnny was gone.</b>
<br><b>Outside my room I saw a nurse and a man helping a woman out of the
room.</b>
<br><b>I was up on my elbows to see what was happening. The next thing
I recall is</b>
<br><b>my mother comming to my room. The rules in intensive care were that
the</b>
<br><b>visits could be only 10 minutes every four hrs. She had just been
there not</b>
<br><b>10 minutes before. I asked what had happened to the lady?&nbsp;
Why was she</b>
<br><b>crying?&nbsp; My mother tried to explain that her baby had died
and that she was</b>
<br><b>in mourning. I never said anything to her about my visit from Johnny.
To this</b>
<br><b>day I dont know why.</b>
<br><b>When I got out of the hospital, I got up with my dad(he worked 3rd
shift}"</b>
<br><b>to see him off to work. I told him the story about uncle Johnny
comming to</b>
<br><b>see me before he came for the baby. He kept saying that I was just
dreaming.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The more&nbsp; I kept denying that it was a dream the more
upset he became.</b>
<br><b>After that I never mentioned it again.I always felt that</b>
<br><b>Johnny had made a pit stop to let me know that I would be ok. He
was</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;on his way to a more serious mission. His angel mission.</b>
<br><b>God love you Johnny!! You were always my favorite. When I smell
roses I think</b>
<br><b>of you.Whatch over my family. Please tell daddy I miss him everyday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b>

<p><b>Shots in the Dark,</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jascomp@cdsnet.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; In 1978,I was living in Santa Cruz California.I was hanging
out with 3 of my friends when we decided to head off into the Santa Cruz
mountains to have some beers and bong hits.We did this in different places
all of the time,it is peaceful in the mountains,and no police.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Anyway,we chose a road very close to Cabrillo college,in
Aptos(One of the small towns in Santa Cruz County).We headed up the road,and
took a few turns on unmarked roads.We drove for about 1/2 hour,ending on
a deadend dirt road,with trees infront of us.There was a house way up the
hill to the right of us,about 1/8 mile away,other than that there was no
other houses.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; We had a cuople of beers,and a buddy of mine noticed something
odd on one of the trees behind us,he couldn,t make it out because it was
very dark up there,and 11:30 pm.We turned on the headlights and moved the
car so the light was shining at the tree.What we saw scared the hell out
of us,which was not an easy task with the guys I hung out with.There was
an inverted cross on the tree,and an alter made out of one of the redwoods.Other
smaller stumps were cut up for seating,and the leafs next to the alter
were all stuck together,like they were wet,but there was no rain.We all
said this was a place we should get away from,it looked like an occult
worship place,we guessed anyway.These guys were all pretty tough,but all
believed in God too.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; About that time we heard two gunshots,muffled but unmistakable.We
all looked up to the house,because that is where the sound came from.The
house had a light on,in what appeared to be a carport,big enough for two
cars.It was a crystal clear night,and because there was no moon,and that
was the only light on(after the headlights were turned off)we could see
the place clearly.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; As we were all looking at the house,saying what the hell
was that,we saw a figure come out of the door under the light.He cleared
the steps,AND a 25 foot distance(that was what we all had guessed the distance
to be) to the opposite side of the carport slab!We could hear him coming
down the very steep hill in front of us,and could see the bushes moving,until
he got away from the shining path of the light.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; We were ALL looking at the scene at the same time,and everyone
screamed GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE NOW!!!!We were in the car and lit the
tires backing up,and used every inch of that 455 motor getting the Hell
out of there.No one said much for a couple of minutes,it was on a dirt
roadand we were sliding all over the place.Greg said later he hit 90 on
the dirt road,in short order.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; When we got a long ways away from that,we pulled over and
noone knew what to say.We were all in shock,and all saw exactly the same
thing.We contemplated calling the cops,because the shot was definately
fired in the house.But since we had all had a few beers,we decided it would
not be worth sounding like lunies to the cops,and smelling like alcohol.We
went to one of the guys house,and talked it out further.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I never heard anything about the shots fired that night,and
definately never went back up there to see what it looked like in the day.Actually,this
is the first time I have related the story in over 20 years,it sounded
too crazy.There was no way I could have made the move that figure did that
night,no way anyone could,but we all saw it.It makes no more sense to me
now ,than it did then.If I had seen it by myself,I might have been able
to discount the distance that figure cleared,maybe an over active imagination.But
we all saw it,and I listened to everyones account before stating mine.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Very strange ,and still unexplained.Thanks for the chance
to tell my story</b>

<p><b>Random Haunts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CindarellaMILL@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>HI. I am 18 years old. I have visited your sight and found it quite</b>
<br><b>interesting. I have a few experiences I would like to share with
you. Most</b>
<br><b>are not connected with each other. It is strange because the incidents
are</b>
<br><b>quite random. Sometimes several things will happen within a few
days of each</b>
<br><b>other.. then maybe months, even years with nothing. Anyways.. here
it</b>
<br><b>goes...My parents built my house. We were the only ones to ever
live there.</b>
<br><b>However,our house was built next to my grandmas... the family homestead
and the land</b>
<br><b>has been in the family for about 4 generations. The earliest experience
I</b>
<br><b>remember was when I was 3 or so. I had awakened in the middle of
the night</b>
<br><b>frightened. I rememberlaying there debating whether or not i shout
call out</b>
<br><b>to my parents. I was too afraid to get up and run across the hall.
I sat</b>
<br><b>there...trying to work out the nerve when all of the sudden I heard
a little</b>
<br><b>girl's voice scream "Mommy".I knew it had not been me.. and I was
an only</b>
<br><b>child.For years.things happened on and off. One night, when i was
about 11 or 12,</b>
<br><b>I woke up in the middle of the night, once again, frightened for
no reason. I</b>
<br><b>often slept with my door mostly closed, the latch resting on the
doorframe.</b>
<br><b>I heard it slide open, and light footsteps. I thought nothing of
it. I had a</b>
<br><b>cat.. quite capable of openeing doors and he was heavy and you could
usually</b>
<br><b>hear his steps. Then I felt an overwhelming presence beside me,
as if</b>
<br><b>someone was standing over me beside my bed. Sometimes, my mom came
in and checked on</b>
<br><b>me, but I knew it wasnt one of my parents because i could hear both
of them</b>
<br><b>snoring. (dont laugh! lol) (i could not see.. i sleep with my covers
over my</b>
<br><b>head. I always have and still do!)I layed there, terrified and perfectly</b>
<br><b>still for what seemed like forever. Suddenly, my afghan that was
over me</b>
<br><b>felt as though it was yanked off. I didnt sleep much that night.</b>
<br><b>another time i was sitting outside on my swing. We had a boy cut
our grass</b>
<br><b>for us. i saw him go behind my grandmas barn on the riding lawn
mower. all</b>
<br><b>of a sudden, I saw a green ball fly through the air. I thought maybe
I had left</b>
<br><b>it and the boy kicked it. BUt then it stopped in mid air, then began</b>
<br><b>floating towards me. It went right over my head. It seemed thin,
yet not like a</b>
<br><b>balloon. It didnt glow or anything..it was just green. I ran in
the house</b>
<br><b>crying and screaming to my dad, but when i came back it was gone.</b>
<br><b>I have heard things. Drawers slamming shut when i am by myself.
Doors too.</b>
<br><b>My mom as heard it. One time my parents said they were laying in
bed. i was</b>
<br><b>little and asleep. To get to their bathroom, u have to pass their
bed.</b>
<br><b>Often, i used their bathroom when i was little. They said they heard
footsteps run</b>
<br><b>past. They called out my name but I didnt anser. They checked the
bathroom</b>
<br><b>and no one was there. They checked on me and i was asleep.</b>
<br><b>I have several more disturbing things that are more recent.</b>
<br><b>When i was a sophomore in high school, i was sitting in class when
a student</b>
<br><b>came to the room with 3 white shirts. They gave them to me, saying
my dad</b>
<br><b>had brought them. I was confused. i called my mom during the passing
period,</b>
<br><b>wondering if for some odd reason she had told my dad to bring me
white</b>
<br><b>shirts. she hadnt. I called dad and he said that I had called and
told him</b>
<br><b>to get three white shirts from the left side of my closet and then
gave him</b>
<br><b>directions to the school office and who to give them to. I had never
called.</b>
<br><b>Scariest part was that being the anal person i am, i frequently
rearranged</b>
<br><b>My closet. No friends had been in my room since the last time I
had, and the</b>
<br><b>caller was right about the location of my shirts. My dad said the
caller</b>
<br><b>sounded exactly like me. The most recent is even stranger. I was
on the</b>
<br><b>phone with my friend Mary and my parents had gone out for ice cream.</b>
<br><b>I didnt want to go and opted to stay</b>
<br><b>home. I heard the car pull up, the car door slam. My parents voices,
the</b>
<br><b>front door unlock, open and close, and my parents footsteps and
voices up</b>
<br><b>the stairs. Usually, my mom peeks in to say hi when they come home.
I waited,</b>
<br><b>but nothing. After about 10 minutes of silence, i went to go check
on them . I</b>
<br><b>called and called and no one answered. I went to the door. It was
still</b>
<br><b>locked. I looked out the window., No car in the driveway. i ran
upstairs and</b>
<br><b>locked myself in the room, crying on the phone to mary. About 15
minutes</b>
<br><b>later, I heard the same noises.This time, it really was my parents.
I told</b>
<br><b>them waht happened, and they said they had not been home until that
time. My</b>
<br><b>dad admitted to having a similar experience once. I dont know what
these</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;incidents are or what they mean. Every so often, I</b>
<br><b>wake up frightened for no good reason. Or sometimes I just get scared
and</b>
<br><b>have an overwhelming feeling like I need to leave the house, or
whatever</b>
<br><b>room I am in.</b>

<br><b>Midnight Hauntings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Silentravensoul@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was two months ago, in a cool autumn night.
At 11:30 p.m. me and</b>
<br><b>James</b>
<br><b>was walking down this long gravel lane, discussing about stories
of</b>
<br><b>hauntings</b>
<br><b>in Kentucky, then all of a sudden it happened, it was silence all
over us.</b>
<br><b>Then as we looked to the right in this open field, fog seemed to
appear</b>
<br><b>above</b>
<br><b>the hallowed ground, as he heard something growl.&nbsp; We stepped
closer and</b>
<br><b>this</b>
<br><b>creature ran up to the fence and stood on its hind legs on the fence,
it had</b>
<br><b>horns like a deer, but it growled as we stepped closer.&nbsp; Then,
as I tried to</b>
<br><b>communicate with it, it dropped back down and ran into the fog,
to never</b>
<br><b>been</b>
<br><b>seen again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not sure what is truly going on around here,
but at times if you</b>
<br><b>listen real closely, you can hear the screams of men fighting in
a field by</b>
<br><b>my house. Its like a skirmish of some kind, like&nbsp; u.s. soldiers
ran into</b>
<br><b>trouble. Where I live has been known to have different kinds of
hauntings.</b>
<br><b>But most of all, its part of the evil superstition of shadow demons,
I call</b>
<br><b>them.&nbsp; They are demonic like creatures that will lurk in the
shadows and</b>
<br><b>watch you.&nbsp; Sometimes you can feel their cold presence watching
you, and</b>
<br><b>following you.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 10yrs I have studied the paranormal in different
parts of kentucky,</b>
<br><b>and sometimes I think that us being not alone, is not always a good
thing.</b>
<br><b>Kentucky was also known for the werewolves, so I really don't know
what to</b>
<br><b>expect next, or if I'll survive the next encounter, but if I do,
its</b>
<br><b>something I'll always remember. But since I'm writing you this,
I'll also</b>
<br><b>tell you another encounter.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two years ago I was by Lafayette in this old
house. Me and Brent heard</b>
<br><b>noises, I thought it was some person. So we went to the well, and
we saw</b>
<br><b>floating heads, it startled us so much, so we went back inside.
Then,</b>
<br><b>without</b>
<br><b>warning we heard people screaming like it was a struggle..then it
got</b>
<br><b>silent.</b>
<br><b>I'll never forget it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I hope this proves that everywhere we go,
there is someone always</b>
<br><b>watching you...welcome to the spirit world..and be true wherever
you go</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Rispin Mansion,Santa Cruz California.</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: jascomp@cdsnet.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Hi Dave,I really enjoy your site,very well done.Anyway,....I
was reading through the list of haunted places in California,and I ran
across a place I know very well,The Rispin mansion.I have never heard it
called that,it was about 4 blocks behind my house,when I was a child.We
always called it"Poor Claire,s Retreat",as it was called when the nuns
were there.It was a very foreboding place,and noone would go near it when
we were young.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; As a teenager,I talked some freinds of mine into going in
there.There was 4 of us,all guys.We snuck over the fence(heavy wooden one,the
guy who lived near it had pitbulls,so we were really quiet.)He watched
over the place.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Anyway,we peeled back a piece of plywood that was nailed
over a window on the main(ground level floor,back side of house.)We had
a flash light,and it was very dark.We entered a small room,and through
a doorway,entering the main room in that part of the house.Vaulted cielings,very
large room.There was a fireplace,with book cases on either side of it.As
my freinds walked down the hallway,I remembered something I had read somewhere,and
walked up to the bookcases.They slid open,and there was a small room behind
either one of them!Enough room to hide someone,or somethings!Nothing in
there but splashes of ink on one of the walls,could not make anything of
them.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Anyway,we went over every inch of the place,very careful
to damage nothing.In the basement there was a red brick hallway,perfectly
square,and very long.At the end it looked like a solid brick wall,sort
of funny that it ended there.We rested up against the back wall,and it
moved!There was a secret room behind it,about 12 foot by 8 ft&lt;I think.(it
was in 1978 or 79).The wall was on a hinge,very strange.Our batteries were
dead by now,so could not see a whole lot.It did not seem scary at all though,just
interesting.We did hear what sounded like footsteps a bunch of times,so
thinking it was the guy watching the place,we were very quiet.Never saw
anyone,spooky.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; There was one room,that seemed like it must have been the
main quarters for mother superior,or whoever.It had a white marble fireplace,and
very ornate decorative trim,and very large windows,and a balcony overlooking
the Soquel Creek,and facing what used to be a department store,and the
doughnut store that my Grandparents used to run.You cannot see the business,because
it is probably an 1/8 of a mile,and the trees blocked the view.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; This room sounds like the one where someone saw a lady in
the black dress.I never saw anything,did not take pictures,but it felt
icy cold in that room,and it was probably 75-80 degrees that day.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; We all felt things,heard things,but never saw anything.There
was something in there,but what,I do not know.I went back quite a few times,it
was a very cool place.Unfortunately,some idiots from San Jose saw our car
parked outside the gate,and went in there,as we were leaving.They destroyed
the fireplaces,and basically trashed the place.We would have trashed them
if we knew what they were going to do,but we did not know it until we came
back the next day.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Someone stepped up the security of the house,and we heard
the dogs inside of the house,so we split in a BIG HURRY,and did not go
back.I will always remember that place,and I was very glad to hear it is
being turned into a bed and Breakfast place.It was beautiful,with facades,and
balconies,and looked like something right out of a horror novel.</b>
<br><b>We talked about the place for years,and then I moved to Oregon,so
I have not been there for a long time.I will go there next summer,to see
what it looks like now.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Thanks for the site,hope this helps tell a bit more of the
story of Poor Claire,s Retreat(Rispsin mansion).</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haunting in Nebraska</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: louda_99@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi! I've loved reading these stories. I keep getting</b>
<br><b>goose bumps though! I figure it's about time that I</b>
<br><b>tell our own story.</b>
<br><b>Although it isn't as dramatic as some of those listed</b>
<br><b>here, it was real enough for me. Right out of college,</b>
<br><b>my husband and I moved to a rental in a small Nebraska</b>
<br><b>town. This house was very cute and well-maintained. It</b>
<br><b>had two strange features, though. In the</b>
<br><b>bathroom/laundry room, there were three doors – one to</b>
<br><b>the hallway and out the back door (on the south end),</b>
<br><b>one to the basement (in the center), and one to a</b>
<br><b>closet room (on the north end). The basement was one</b>
<br><b>of those spooky basements: one big room; creaky, old</b>
<br><b>stairs; dimly lit. The closet room was a strange room</b>
<br><b>about 12 feet by 12 feet, lined with cabinets from</b>
<br><b>floor to ceiling on three sides.</b>
<br><b>Throughout the rest of this house, I felt very</b>
<br><b>comfortable and relaxed. It had a warm feeling to it.</b>
<br><b>But as I would turn down the hall and head to the</b>
<br><b>bathroom, the feeling of dread would increase. I was</b>
<br><b>never comfortable in the bathroom (the only one in the</b>
<br><b>house) and would rush through showers and getting</b>
<br><b>ready and all the other duties done in the bathroom.</b>
<br><b>And I would never go in there in without a light on.</b>
<br><b>But the experience wasn't based just on my hunches.</b>
<br><b>The bathroom door leading to the hallway would never</b>
<br><b>stay open. Eventually, my resourceful husband rigged</b>
<br><b>up a rope that we used to tie the door open. I would</b>
<br><b>blame this on the house settling or a crooked doorjam,</b>
<br><b>but the door to the basement – right next to the</b>
<br><b>hallway door – would never stay closed. It would</b>
<br><b>randomly open itself, even if you weren't in the room</b>
<br><b>or were across the room no where near the door.</b>
<br><b>Eventually, we learned if we slammed the door shut and</b>
<br><b>locked it, it would usually stay closed. But even</b>
<br><b>then, it occasionally opened after we had locked it.</b>
<br><b>My husband worked strange hours with his job in</b>
<br><b>Nebraska, so often times I would be getting ready by</b>
<br><b>myself in the morning. I'm the first to admit I have</b>
<br><b>an active imagination, but I also don't like others to</b>
<br><b>know when I overreact to something. One morning when I</b>
<br><b>was getting ready for work and my husband had already</b>
<br><b>left, I was in the bathroom curling my hair when I</b>
<br><b>distinctly heard footsteps coming up the stairs. I</b>
<br><b>stopped what I was doing and stood perfectly still to</b>
<br><b>see if I actually was hearing what I thought I was</b>
<br><b>hearing. And the footsteps continued, very slowly,</b>
<br><b>almost as if someone was trying to sneak up the stairs</b>
<br><b>without making any noise. I tried to write it off as</b>
<br><b>an over active imagination – until I saw the door knob</b>
<br><b>turn on the basement door. Thank God I had locked that</b>
<br><b>door! Well I bolted out of that room so fast! But, not</b>
<br><b>wanting to appear the fool, I called my mom instead of</b>
<br><b>leaving the house. I was so scared! Mom assured me, if</b>
<br><b>I heard what I did, to get out of the house (better</b>
<br><b>safe than sorry) and get some help. Well, we were new</b>
<br><b>in the neighborhood so I wasn't comfortable doing</b>
<br><b>this. But my fear over-rode my shyness. So I headed to</b>
<br><b>our neighbors house and met one of our new neighbors –</b>
<br><b>a big, strong fireman. (Well, if anyone's going to</b>
<br><b>give me confidence to go back into the house, he did!)</b>
<br><b>So I explained what I had heard, and he escorted me</b>
<br><b>back to the bathroom. Together, we opened the basement</b>
<br><b>door – and found nothing! There was no way anyone</b>
<br><b>could have exited the house without me seeing him/her.</b>
<br><b>And even the neighbor was spooked down there. He</b>
<br><b>walked around the room, making sure no one was hiding</b>
<br><b>down there. And after assuring that I was okay, he</b>
<br><b>beat it out of the house, with goosebumps on his arms!</b>
<br><b>That wasn't the only incident. From then on, I'd joke</b>
<br><b>with family and friends about our Casper. He didn't</b>
<br><b>mean harm, but he enjoyed scaring the bejebus out of</b>
<br><b>us. Even my husband left the light on over night. But</b>
<br><b>Casper didn't limit himself to the bathroom area. One</b>
<br><b>night, I had just finished the dishes and pulled down</b>
<br><b>the shade in the kitchen window. I walked out of the</b>
<br><b>room and sat down in the living room to watch TV.</b>
<br><b>About 2 minutes later, I heard a loud noise in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen. I got up to investigate and found the kitchen</b>
<br><b>shade still shaking from being rolled up. I would</b>
<br><b>shake it off as it snapping up, but it was 2 minutes</b>
<br><b>later.</b>
<br><b>The same reasoning goes for the "dryer" incident. My</b>
<br><b>husband was brushing his teeth in the bathroom and I</b>
<br><b>was changing batches in the washer and dryer. I moved</b>
<br><b>the clothes from the washer to the dryer and turned it</b>
<br><b>on. Then, I began putting clothes in the washer for</b>
<br><b>the next batch. Suddenly, the dryer door opened by</b>
<br><b>itself. Okay, I can attribute that to something in the</b>
<br><b>batch "hitting" the door open. But then the door</b>
<br><b>closed itself and the dryer started up again. Now, the</b>
<br><b>once the door opens on the dryer, the dryer turns off</b>
<br><b>and won't restart unless you push the button up top.</b>
<br><b>And the door was open too long for it to have just</b>
<br><b>sprung shut. I just looked at my stunned husband and</b>
<br><b>booked it out of that room, telling Casper that I</b>
<br><b>didn't like him scaring me. I guess he listened,</b>
<br><b>because from then on, the only incidents we had were</b>
<br><b>the bathroom doors opening and closing and the front</b>
<br><b>door opening by itself. We have sensed moved from the</b>

<br><b>Hospital and Nursing Home Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Fred@PeachNet.campuscwix.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I work in a nursing home,prior to 2 years ago the rural hospital
was attached,anyway we have many ghosts or haints as my elderly ones call
them,one of our favorite is "Gertie"one our nurses who was murdered in
her home but had worked with us,she visits often,still in her white iniform
and cap,even people whom have just came to live there or work there ask
about the lady in white who checks on them,I have worked there for 27 years
and truly it is amazing the spirits we have, when they tore the hospital
down I wonder where our "Dr.Martin"went he died one morning in the late
50s or early 60s during surgery,he couldn't complete the surgery and went
to the lounge after the other Dr. finished and went to check on him he
was dead, the last time I went to the old #1ER room before it was closed
for good it was so cold and I couldn't go in for the force I felt the maintenance
man that was with me thought I was crazy but I felt something that day,they
are building assited living rooms on the site of the old hospital,I wonder
will the Dr.Martin ghost move in there?I truly enjoy your site,happy hunting</b><b></b>

<br><b>Playing Tricks</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Ratnest9@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;One night, I was getting ready for bed.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>always tried to be IN bed at night before my husband left for work.&nbsp;
Silly</b>
<br><b>as it sounds, I could just pull the covers over my head when I started
hearing</b>
<br><b>noises.&nbsp; LOL!&nbsp; Well I had this pink nightie.&nbsp; I wore
this night gown every</b>
<br><b>night.&nbsp; I mean EVERY night.&nbsp; I had it for years and it
was comfortable.&nbsp; (I</b>
<br><b>washed it of course)&nbsp; anyway, one night Brian was getting ready
for work and</b>
<br><b>I was getting ready for bed and I pulled my night gown out from
under my</b>
<br><b>pillow and laid it on the bed.&nbsp; I went in the bathroom to brush
my teeth and</b>
<br><b>when I came back the night gown was gone.&nbsp; The bed was still
neatly made and</b>
<br><b>Brian was still down stairs getting ready.&nbsp; I looked under
my pillow and all</b>
<br><b>over the room for my nightie.&nbsp; I went downstairs and asked
Brian if he took</b>
<br><b>my night gown ... he said "no, I haven't been upstairs".&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, I went back</b>
<br><b>up stairs and checked all of my dresser drawers, looked under the
bed, and ALL</b>
<br><b>over again.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no sight of my night gown.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So I conceded to wear</b>
<br><b>one of Brian's old t shirts to bed since it was as close as I could
get to</b>
<br><b>mypink night gown.&nbsp;&nbsp; I put his shirt on and went down
stairs to kiss Brian</b>
<br><b>good night.&nbsp; I went back upstairs, pulled down the covers and
got into bed.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was sitting Indian style under the covers waiting for the news to
come on when I</b>
<br><b>looked down and there, in my LAP was my night gown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I just sat there</b>
<br><b>staring at it.&nbsp; I was unable to move and in total disbelief.&nbsp;
Brian came</b>
<br><b>upstairs to say "good-bye" and I just looked at him.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This episode didn't</b>
<br><b>scare me though, I felt like she was almost playing with me.&nbsp;
I just wanted</b>
<br><b>to tell you that story.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Shhhhh!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DexRed@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I have a story for you. 2 years ago, my parents got a</b>
<br><b>seperation and my mom had me live with her. We moved into this duplex</b>
<br><b>which used to be a barn in the early 1800's. On Oct. 30( 2 yrs ago),
my</b>
<br><b>mom went out to a party. I stayed home and watched my little sister.
My</b>
<br><b>little sister is 7 now. Well on that night while she was asleep,
I</b>
<br><b>stayed down stairs to watch TV. At about 9 that night, I heard a
soft</b>
<br><b>"Shh" sound. I looked upstairs from the first floor and standing
on the</b>
<br><b>top landing was a little girl in a communion dress(all white). At
first</b>
<br><b>I thought it was my sister so I told her to go back to sleep. I
could</b>
<br><b>not see the girls face though. As I took a step up, the girl walked
to</b>
<br><b>the side and disapeared out of site. I went upstairs and checked
on my</b>

<p><b>Kinda Spooky</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DMBushor@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure if my stories would be considered
"ghost stories" or not,</b>
<br><b>but they kinda freaked my family and me out.&nbsp; The first one
took place at my</b>
<br><b>grandmothers house in Missouri.&nbsp; She was packing the house
up so she could</b>
<br><b>move.&nbsp; One night when I was there with her and my, mom my grandma
brought out</b>
<br><b>this box that had all of this old jewelry in it.&nbsp; I love that
stuff and I was</b>
<br><b>rummaging around in it looking at lockets and rings and such when
I found a</b>
<br><b>watch with my great-great-great grandma's initials on it.&nbsp;
I thought it was</b>
<br><b>gorgeous and I put it on.&nbsp; I looked down at it and noticed
that it was still</b>
<br><b>ticking.&nbsp; I commented to my grandmother that it was cool that
this hundred</b>
<br><b>year old watch still worked.&nbsp; My grandma went pale.&nbsp; I
saw she was upset and</b>
<br><b>I asked her what the problem was.&nbsp; She told me that that thing
hadn't worked</b>
<br><b>in like 50 years.&nbsp; I didn't believe her until my mom told me
how they tried</b>
<br><b>to get it fixed in the 1970s and no one could fix it.&nbsp; They
decided that the</b>
<br><b>watch must have been meant for me.&nbsp; It still works.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another story was right after my grandpa died
six years ago.&nbsp; After he</b>
<br><b>passed, my grandma (same grandma, different house) had to sell the
house.</b>
<br><b>The last time I was there, I was in the kitchen alone while my grandma
was</b>
<br><b>getting some boxes from the living room when I heard this strange</b>
<br><b>humming/moaning sound.&nbsp; It kept getting louder and louder until
I said,</b>
<br><b>"Grandpa, I love you but you're scarring me."&nbsp; After that the
noise stopped</b>
<br><b>and my grandma came back upstairs.&nbsp; I wasn't scared because
I knew who it</b>
<br><b>was.&nbsp; I think he just wanted to say good-bye.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a few more, but I haven't been able to
put them in words yet.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for listening.&nbsp; You can email me if you want with comments.</b>

<br><b>Lifetime of Hauntings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:cdmc1@home.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My name is Nathan Black, I'm 23 years old I have had many supernatural
experiences, however one stands out in my memory.&nbsp; Five years ago
I started working for a family here in Victoria B.C., Canada.&nbsp; I was
the childrens caregiver.&nbsp; The first months I was seeing a ghost or
what I thought was a ghost. living in the house.&nbsp; I didn't want to
tell my boss in case it lead to an early dismissal in my part, however
after the 5 year old child woke up one morning screaming because, he said
a man was in his room talking to him, I felt I had to say something, it
was then that I learned the story that her father died in this house two
years before.&nbsp; I asked if my employer had seen any supernatural things?&nbsp;
The response was terriffing, the story goes that her father had cancer
and was very well off financially and had decided to lower her brothers
share of the inheritence.&nbsp; One day in late summer the brother showed
up when the rest of the family was gone and proceeded to yell and argue
with the father until he had a heart attack.&nbsp; The daugter had come
home to only find her father dead in his chair.&nbsp; since this a rash
of strange things have been happening, like dark "shadows" moving across
hallways and through bedrooms, a man with glasses appearing standing in
the kitchen, then fading away.&nbsp; Pictures with unexplained things in
them, from childrens birthday parties.&nbsp; And most terriffing actual
voices and whispers coming from apparently no where.&nbsp; at this ponit
I felt it was time to confront this situation and try anything to help
in any way i could, this lead me to my quest to find out what really happened.&nbsp;
I will forever regret that desicion.&nbsp; What happen in the days to follow
would lead to my break up with my girlfriend at the time, and questions
about my own mental health.&nbsp; In my quest for truth I found out that
this was more than an arguement and more like a murder.&nbsp; I was doing
the dishes one day after a meal and one of the children screamed at me
to look out! I spun around to see a full figured old man standing in front
of me.&nbsp; Thinking this was a real person who had broke in I dove at
him&nbsp; with so much force that I landed on the floor and broke my wrist,.......
he wasn't there?I no longer work for these people but still recieve phone
calls from the children who still see the ghost.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Lucky</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bbrad@hsnp.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi thought I must tell of some occurrences 1 1/2 yrs
ago.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I was staying at Henderson state university in Arkadelphia
Arkansas for a camp.&nbsp; My friend and I skipped a practice and fond
only a few people at the dorm and no one on our floor(we were on floor
4).&nbsp; We hit the 1st floor button as we were leaving and were sent
to the 2nd floor up to the 5th back down to the 3rd where the elevator
door open and closed repeatedly by this time we were both crying and in
shock.&nbsp; We ran out the door and headed to the stair case and when
we were at the second floor of the stairs the lights went out in the stairwell.&nbsp;
We sat down scared to death and they just came back on and a thin girl
in a dark dress "floated" past.&nbsp; When we told the counselors one said
she knew and then the others said they didn't know what we were talking
about but all turned about white when we spoke of the occurrences.&nbsp;
Another time I was walking up the stairs with the same friend and we heard
someone follow us we looked down and it was the ghost we hightailed it
out of there and went to the first floor we could get to.&nbsp; If someone
was playing a prank as some counselors said they were pretty good.&nbsp;
We held a "spiritual gathering" with two other friends there to find out
what was up.&nbsp; None of us were experienced and we just prayed for our
souls before.&nbsp; I was chosen to tell the story.&nbsp; Here boyfriend
cruelly broke up with here and told here by standing her up for someone
else and telling her to go where he met his new girl.&nbsp; She stayed
to haunt the girl who made her die of heart brake.&nbsp; I know it was
not smart to do the spiritual gathering but I am fine and was not bothered
this summer.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Grim Reaper</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>well um I guess I should start from the begining.this is going to
sound</b>
<br><b>really weird but I am sure you&nbsp; people have heard things stranger
than this.I</b>
<br><b>think what I experienced was what I believe a spirit takeing the
form of&nbsp; the</b>
<br><b>grim reaper.</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happened when I would have my cat in my room as I slept. One
night I was</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;sleeping soundly and I woke up cause I felt someone else in
the room. Iooked</b>
<br><b>beside me and my cat was gone. I looked at the corner of my room
and a figure</b>
<br><b>in all black was standing pointing at me it lasted maybe a min.
and</b>
<br><b>dissapeared. I had no clue what the figure was until the next day.
I was</b>
<br><b>rollerbladeing in my building's parking lot when I rolled over a
rock and</b>
<br><b>fell, my head also landed on a rock. when I realized what was happening
I</b>
<br><b>rolled out of the way of a car seconds&nbsp; before it would have
run right over</b>
<br><b>my head. I don't know why the car did not stop the person had to
have seen me</b>
<br><b>laying there. I took that visit the night before as warning.</b>
<br><b>I will add I am not a christian either.......I am full wiccan.&nbsp;
I believe</b>
<br><b>what I saw was a spirit takeing the form of the grim reaper....somehow
it</b>
<br><b>knew what was going to happen the next day and decided to help me.</b>
<br><b>That's my story and you don't have to believe it if you would not
like to but</b>

<p><b>My First Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DustWiebe@gateway.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This is the account of the first spirit that I encountered. Back
in 1980 I</b>
<br><b>was in the third grade, my family lived in a two and a half story
home. This</b>
<br><b>house is located near Vista Park Drive and Capitol Expressway in
San Jose CA.</b>
<br><b>My Mom back then was into collecting antique tea kettles. One day
several</b>
<br><b>weeks after we moved in this house, my Mom brought home an old world
war one</b>
<br><b>military tea kettle that she had bought at a garage sale. The tea
kettle was</b>
<br><b>taped shut with old dirty masking tape, the tape was almost as old
as the tea</b>
<br><b>kettle. My Mom asked me to take the tape off it and clean it up
so she could</b>
<br><b>resale it at the flea market. The following day, Monday, I walked
home from</b>
<br><b>school for lunch, my oldest sister Renee was the only one home and
she was in</b>
<br><b>the upstairs bathroom across from the staircase. I went and sat
down at the</b>
<br><b>top step to talk to my sister while she got ready for work. I had
asked her</b>
<br><b>if someone else was home besides her, she said that we were alone.
She asked</b>
<br><b>me if I needed a ride back to school, I said no, I had over 20 minutes
to get</b>
<br><b>back. My sister went on her way and locked the door behind her.
Moments after</b>
<br><b>she drove off, my mothers bedroom door started pounding as if someone
was</b>
<br><b>hitting it as hard as they could to get out. I pressed my hands
against the</b>
<br><b>door and the door was bouncing my hands back. I started screaming
for my Mom</b>
<br><b>telling her it was me and to wake up. Then I remembered what my
sister said.</b>
<br><b>The door stopped slamming, I heard the radio in my bedroom somehow
it turned</b>
<br><b>on by itself. I went in my room and turned off the radio, as I was
leaving</b>
<br><b>the room, it turned itself back on. I got very scared and ran down
the</b>
<br><b>stairs, the front door was wide open and I ran straight through
not touching</b>
<br><b>any thing as I sprinted by. When I jumped off the steps the door
slammed shut</b>
<br><b>behind me. I ran to the neighbors house across the street and called
my Mom</b>
<br><b>at work. I told her that I was not going to go home until someone
was there</b>
<br><b>with me. Of course my Mom thought I was dreaming the story up. She
picked up</b>
<br><b>my older brother Chip and proceeded home. During the drive my Mom
mentioned</b>
<br><b>the conversation we had with my brother, they both thought I was
nuts. When</b>
<br><b>they got home, some of the lights where already on. Mom got upset
and told</b>
<br><b>Chip that she had just got a notice to cut off the electricity cause
she</b>
<br><b>could not afford the expensive bill. When this conversation happened,
all the</b>
<br><b>lights in the house shut off at once. My Mom said well I guess PG&amp;E
shut us</b>
<br><b>off, but my brother noticed that the down stairs half bath half
laundry room</b>
<br><b>light was still on. Mom told Chip to go check the circuit breaker.
When Chip</b>
<br><b>started leaving the room, both him and Mom noticed all the lights
switches</b>
<br><b>where turned off. This opened my Mom up and she finally discussed
the ghost</b>
<br><b>problem with me.</b>
<br><b>For weeks I and some friends and family could hear someone pacing
back and</b>
<br><b>forth in the bath/wash room that was down stairs. At night I would
hear</b>
<br><b>someone walking in the hall scratching the wall I slept next too.
Many nights</b>
<br><b>I had Chip sleep with me. Items in the house where moved around
and nobody</b>
<br><b>could ever find the old W.W.I tea kettle again. I think this spirit
saved my</b>
<br><b>life one time, that's when I finally felt that he was friendly.
I was in the</b>
<br><b>half bath/wash room, I took a bottle of bleach and a bottle of ammonia
and</b>
<br><b>poured both of them into the toilet together to clean it. My lungs
felt like</b>
<br><b>they where on fire, that's when I felt someone grab my shoulders
and pull me</b>
<br><b>out of the room, I heard the toilet flush. I went out the garage
door for</b>
<br><b>some fresh air, nobodies cars where there. I went back into the
house and</b>
<br><b>searched around, no one was home but me.</b>
<br><b>One night about a week after, Chip and I slept in the den, that
is where the</b>
<br><b>half bath/wash room is also. When I woke up in the morning, I started
gazing</b>
<br><b>into the reflection of the TV screen that was off in front of me.
I saw A big</b>
<br><b>man, he stood almost as tall as the door jam. He looked like he
was wearing a</b>
<br><b>W.W.I. military fatigue the same kind I've seen in the old movies.
He was</b>
<br><b>looking right at me, I trembled in fear and spun my head around
to see him,</b>
<br><b>but nobody was there. I turned back to look at the TV screen, His
face was</b>
<br><b>all I could see in the reflection starring right at me. I pulled
my cover</b>
<br><b>over my head and started screaming as loud as I could. Every one
in the house</b>
<br><b>woke up and asked what had happened. My Mom and step dad found us
a new place</b>
<br><b>to live and we moved out about two weeks later.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Late Fiancee</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: shanae@alphaltd.com]</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Donny, my fiancee, was killed December 21, 1996. His funeral was
on Christmas Eve and that night when I finally went to bed, I tried to
sleep. I tossed and turned and I remember being so incredibly cold. At
the time I had a queen size bed and I was sleeping in the middle. I rolled
onto my left side and felt another body. I believe in apparitions so I
did not panic, yet I don't remember waking up. I do remember walking with
him to the waterfall where he first kissed me and asked me to marry him.
In this surreal dream he told me that I would be alright without him and
that I would meet only one other man that I would love as much as him.
He promised me he would always take care of me and never let anything happen
to me. I woke up about 3 am and my dog was barking and playing. I thought
he was nuts and should be sleeping, but when I looked over the foot of
my bed, Donny was sitting on my floor playing with him. He picked up my
dog and said how much he missed me and my puppy. During the next two years
of my life I saw Donny often. Usually in my bedroom laying next to me or
playing with my dog. He kept his promise about watching over me. He warned
me about an accident that I would be in unless I avoided this particular
spot. I took his warning, and two other cars were in an accident at that
very place. Everyone was killed. It was just this year that I met my husband,
Scott. The last time I saw Donny was on my wedding day, September 23, 2000.
He told me he had kept his promise and it was now time for him to go. He
kissed me and hugged me and vanished. I thank him every day for teaching
me how to love.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Go Away!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jimrat@ticnet.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>It has taken me a long time to write you, because there are so many
critics out there I feared no one would take me seriously.&nbsp; I have
admired your web site for over two years.&nbsp; I lived in many places
around Mesquite, Texas as a child.&nbsp; My father was a police officer
and still is, but when I was a child he worked alot of nights.</b>
<br><b>I remeber we were living in a nice little house on Sesame Drive
near an elementary school I attended.&nbsp; I am not sure how old it was
but I remember it had old hard wood flooring.&nbsp; I was about six years
old at the time and my sister and I shared a bed in a room right across
from our parents.&nbsp; They always left the door open at night.&nbsp;
I woke up from a deep sleep and looked over to the doorway.&nbsp; There
was a very light blue glow.&nbsp; I rubbed my eyes and looked again, and
I knew exactly what I was looking at.&nbsp; It was a woman, slightly heavy
set standing in the doorway.&nbsp; She was transparent, but the details
of her gown were displayed in darker shades of blue.&nbsp; She was smiling,
one hand on her hip, and the other on the door panel.&nbsp; She never spoke,
she didn't have to.&nbsp; Even though I didn't feel threatened by her,
I had seen plenty of scarey movies at my early age and expected the worst.&nbsp;
I nugged my sister but she only moaned, rolled over and feel back to sleep
again.&nbsp; I then knew that even if no one would believe me I needed
to believe it myself.&nbsp; I pinced myself, held my breath, and rubbed
my eyes again and again, but there she was still.&nbsp; I finally was so
frightened I began to cry.&nbsp; " Go Away, you're scaring me." I pleeded
with tears streaming down my face.&nbsp; No sooner did I speak that her
detail turned back into a blue haze and ascended up into the ceiling.&nbsp;
I don't remember a thing after that, but my mom said I came into her room
cold and shaking, and asked, " Mom, why were you in my room?"&nbsp; She
says she replied, " I wasn't."</b>
<br><b>Now, it was only a few months ago my father and I got on the subject
of the unknown, and I asked if he remembered that night.&nbsp; He said
no, but the funny thing was he remembered the landlord saying that he had
trouble keeping people in that house, and that they would give him no explanation
and they would leave.&nbsp; Also, he realized an odd thing, around that
same time the electricity bill was something like $650.00 !&nbsp; He fought
and fought with the electricity company, but ended up having to pay it
anyhow.&nbsp; I have heard that spirits can have an effect on such things.</b>
<br><b>The reason I am sharing this story with you is that ever since that
night I have been very sensative to the paranormal activity in any given
place.&nbsp; How can I use that gift for good, and how can I strenghten
it, and most importantly, how can I not be afraid of it.&nbsp; It can be
extremely overwhelming, at times I can feel nausea, or just a rush .&nbsp;
Mostly I pick up on awful vibes, the ones no one wants to feel.&nbsp; Please
tell me I am not psycho....I can't explain it any better.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><b>Campfire Tale</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JCONVY@advanceautoparts.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This happened when I was 16 (1991).</b><b></b>
<p><b>Our church youth group went to a camp on Bugs Lake on the VA NC border.
That</b>
<br><b>Saturday night we went up to the church/meeting hall that was located
about</b>
<br><b>a mile up a gravel road in woods with nothing around. I remember
that the</b>
<br><b>girls that my friend Gomez and I liked at the time had never been
snipe</b>
<br><b>hunting (a game where you have them sitting in the dark saying snipe
snipe</b>
<br><b>to try to catch one while you 'go scare them up'. You really sit
out there</b>
<br><b>laughing at them). We took them out there and sat on the porch of
the church</b>
<br><b>laughing at them sitting in the woods saying snipe. Well we heard
one of</b>
<br><b>them say to the other 'Wait a minute. There's nothing called a snipe.
You</b>
<br><b>guys are dead.' That stopped all laughter and we ran down the road</b>
<br><b>flashlights lighting our way. Our flashlight hit two people sitting
in the</b>
<br><b>ditch real close to each other shivering. Scared us to death. It
was two</b>
<br><b>more people from the youth group that were coming to scare us. I
looked at</b>
<br><b>one of them and asked 'Skip what are you doing there?' He looked
at me and</b>
<br><b>his face turned absolutely white and said 'A tree flew at us.' At
this time</b>
<br><b>the girls had caught up and paused their attacks at us when they
say the</b>
<br><b>other two. I laughed at Skip (who was a pretty big guy) and started
to mock</b>
<br><b>him. 'A tree? A whole tree uprooted itself and just flew across...'
At that</b>
<br><b>time (I am telling the God given truth) we heard a crack in the
woods and a</b>
<br><b>good 3 foot wide 7 foot tall tree was hurled across the road. I
grabbed the</b>
<br><b>girl I liked's hand and started running down the road with everyone
else</b>
<br><b>following close behind. We never looked back as we ran to camp.
Now to get</b>
<br><b>to camp you need to pass this small garden that only had tomatoes
and a</b>
<br><b>scarecrow. On the other side of the road from that was the owner's
trailer</b>
<br><b>who was gone cause she was pissed at all of us making noise. Well
as we</b>
<br><b>passed the garden I stopped and saw about 4 or 5 kids, about 3 girls
and 2</b>
<br><b>boys, holding hands dancing around the scarecrow. Everyone kept
running but</b>
<br><b>I couldn't stop looking at these kids. I still have nightmares about
this.</b>
<br><b>They kids were transparent like wearing dresses and overalls that
looked</b>
<br><b>old. They danced around 2 more times before they stopped and all,
in one</b>
<br><b>motion, turned and stared at me with angry faces. That is when I
ran to</b>
<br><b>everyone else who was sitting in the back of one of the pickup trucks
that</b>
<br><b>we had. We sat in the back of that truck all night singing stupid
happy</b>
<br><b>songs like Jesus loves me. I think that I did look up the hill once
to see</b>
<br><b>the kids looking down at us still holding hands.</b>
<br><b>The next morning we packed up everything and headed out. As we drove
down</b>
<br><b>the road we saw in the ditch two trees, that had been uprooted,
laying</b>
<br><b>there. We never went back to that place and I never want to.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Basement Door</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SwirlGrl2001@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This experience was the first and only so far.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night I was laying in my bed it was about
three in the morning. I was</b>
<br><b>a teenager then. As I was laying in the bed trying to fall asleep
I heard my</b>
<br><b>door open. Now I was very freaked out because I had two locks on
my door, and</b>
<br><b>one was a dead bolt and both were locked and no one had a key. I
was always</b>
<br><b>scared any way because my room was in the basement. After my door
had open</b>
<br><b>all the way I looked up and all I could see was an image of a young
woman</b>
<br><b>with a box in her hands. I couldn't move at all nor could I speak.
This was</b>
<br><b>the really weird part, I thought in my head "Is this really happening?"
and</b>
<br><b>the figure shock its head yes. I also thought "I am going crazy?"
and the</b>
<br><b>figure shock its head no. Then all of a sudden the figure started
to float</b>
<br><b>backwards towards the stairs and started to disappear.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the only thing that happened there when
I was living there but</b>
<br><b>my little sister says she hears things when it get to be late.</b>

I awoke in the middel of the night and thought I saw my mother and father.But
it wasn't I dont know what it was but there were 3 or 4 of them and they
were playing a card game. After two minets of staring one stood up and
said"Help me please I need help"and started walking twored me. I ran to
my older sister's room and she got up and went to the living room and nothing
was out there. Then she told meto go sleep with our perents and she went
to bed.I went to go to my perents room and the door was locked so I went
back to my sister's room and she was on the top bunk and something was
on the bottom.when I walked over there it looke dlike me unkel that died&nbsp;
when I was two.I tried to scream but nothing came out and I tried to move
but I couldn't.and them my sister woke up and I was just standing there
with my mouth so she went and got my mother and right when she left the
room I could move.I fell on the floor and was crying.When my mother got
in the room she turned on the light and I had marks on my arms that looked
like someone grabed my arms hard. I stoped for an while and we moved into
a two story 4 bed room house.It had two rooms down stairs and two up.On
the up stairs The big bedroom was my oldest sisters Lissa how at the time
was about 15 .I had the one across the hall and my older sister Jessica
and younger sister Tommi had one of the down stairs bedrooms.Well at the
very top of the stairs there was a little room that had nails in the walls.
The point of the nails were out so if you wanted to you could kill or inger
someone in that room. well we had pets like any normal family. We had six
cats,three dogs,four rats,and a fish. well when we moved in that is what
we had! The first week we were there one of our dogs dissapered and two
rats died.Well the little room at the top of the stairs we called the nail
room. Then one night I was the only one up I hered noises in the "nail
room"so I opend the door and there was omeone in there and I walked in

<p><b>Our Loved Ones</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: intim@sprynet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I guess I will start from the begining. My father left when I was
3 years old, and he married a woman with three children, and more or less
forgot about my self and my little brother.</b>
<br><b>When I was 16, I wanted to know who he was, and even more I wanted
away from my mother, so I looked him up.</b>
<br><b>I moved in with him and found out that one of his stepchildren had
recently died of lukemia, and at the same time his marriage had dissolved.</b>
<br><b>His wife, Jenny, came to our place and looked at me and said, "
Karen will get you"</b>
<br><b>Now I was scared to death as you can imagine, but everyone just
blew it off as my parinoia, until one night.</b>
<br><b>My father, whom I was living with at the time, was a truck driver
and was on the road, when the neighbor came over to check on me to see
if I was ok. We urned on the T.V. and started to watch it when the channel
turned to 13, which wasn't even a channel in New Hampshire at the time.
We both thought it was a fluke, but not matter what channel we tried, it
kept going back to 13.</b>
<br><b>Well to say the least, we were very scared and left the apartment
until my father came home, but it doesn't stop there.</b>
<br><b>The next morning, he was sleeping on the couch, because he got in
so late, when I heard him yell, " I am up Karen", this is the girl that
had passed away a few months before this. He was hit over the head with
a small table next to the couch. He told me who it was, and from that moment
on I was a wreck.</b>
<br><b>We had a priest come to the apartment and say a pray for me, but
that didn't work for me.</b>
<br><b>One night I prayed for my grandmother to help me from this awful
experience, and I SWEAR she came threw my body and told me she was there,
and I would be fine.</b>
<br><b>I was never one to put much into the belief of the supenatural,</b>
<br><b>but I am living proof that we all have angels, and we all being
protected from harm</b>
<br><b>I hope this helps someone out there because I KNOW with out a shadow
of a doubt, we all have help, and we just need to open our hearts and minds,
and our loved ones are there for us.</b>

<p><b>Night Light</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: p.j.vander.wielen@freeler.nl</b><b></b>
<p><b>I bought my house about seven years ago, and in the beginning I had
no curtains for the windows. Sometimes at night I saw a flashlight lighting
the room. I didn't care about it because I thought it was the lightning
outside, the beginning of a thunderstorm.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; And when the curtains arrived I saw the lightning several
times, but I was still thinking of the thunderstorm, till one night I was
lieing on my back because I couldn't sleep. Suddely I saw the flashlight
comming out of the lamp at the ceiling. I knew then that the other lightings
never were something of a thunderstorm. It worried me a bit because I thought
there was something wrong with the electricity of the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; From this time on I saw the light comming from several lamps,
the one at the ceiling, a standing lamp, the lamp on the toilet, in the
hall etc. It was like a little lightning.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I asked an electrician about it and he said that the thing
I described never could be something of technical kind. Lighting comming
out of a lamp was impossible.</b>
<br><b>Then a person I knew, who had something of a paranormal gift, told
me that this was the spirit of a soul that was never collected. I hope
you know what I mean, it's a bit difficult for me to describe this in English.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; That knowledge was it bit frightning in the beginning, but
I got used to it very soon, and it didn't bother me anymore.</b>
<br><b>Nowadays I don't see it anymore, so I suppose the lost soul is finaly
collected.</b>
<br><b>That it may rest in peace.</b>
<br><b>That's all I have to tell about own experiences. But I have a lot
of stories about haunted castles in the Netherlands, and I have made pictures
of all these houses; so...if you are interested, let me know.</b>

<p><b>Red Eyed Dog</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wreck19@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, Dave. Just thought I'd tell a story that happened to me when
I was about</b>
<br><b>ten years old. Also, I'd appreciate it if you'd e-mail me personally
and</b>
<br><b>tell me what you think it could have been. The story begins, like
I said,</b>
<br><b>when I was about 10 years old. I was with my best friend at the
time. We</b>
<br><b>were hanging out at his grandparents' house. Before I tell the rest
of the</b>
<br><b>story I'd better give a brief history on the house as told to me
by my</b>
<br><b>friend. The house is built in two parts. There's an older part and
a newer</b>
<br><b>part to the house. On the land surrounding the house there were
two ponds.</b>
<br><b>Rumor had it that a couple of people had died during fishing accidents
in</b>
<br><b>one of the two ponds a long time ago. Anyway, in the house, as best
as I can</b>
<br><b>remember, I would always get a very strange feeling whenever I would
go into</b>
<br><b>the old part of the house, which is where all of the bedrooms were.
It</b>
<br><b>always seemed foggy back there for some reason. Okay, here's the
story. We</b>
<br><b>were staying there alone one night. His parents and granparents
were out</b>
<br><b>together. We were watching TV in the livingroom which was located
in the</b>
<br><b>newer part of the house. I remember wanting to go play with a set
of old</b>
<br><b>drums that his grandfather had in a bedroom in the old part of the
house. So</b>
<br><b>we left the livingroom and went to the bedroom where the drums were.
And,</b>
<br><b>ofcourse, like everytime before, I felt very strange again. It was
as if</b>
<br><b>someone was watching me. I also remember having kind-of a sick feeling
as we</b>
<br><b>were walking towards the room down the hall. Once we made it to
the room I</b>
<br><b>sat down and started playing with the drums. The whole time my friend
and I</b>
<br><b>were talking and joking around. After a while I realized that my
friend was</b>
<br><b>no longer talking to me and that I was talking to myself. I turned
around</b>
<br><b>and he was gone. This in itself scared me as I was already scared
in the</b>
<br><b>first place for being in that part of the house. So I got up from
the drums</b>
<br><b>and walked towards the bedroom door. Now this next part really happened.
I</b>
<br><b>swear I cannot explain it but it sticks in my mind as if it happened</b>
<br><b>yesterday. As I was walking out of the door into the hallway I happened
to</b>
<br><b>look up into the room directly across the hall. In the darkness
I saw red</b>
<br><b>eyes looking at me. The body was, as best as I can describe, a black
dog</b>
<br><b>with eagle talons. It was sitting on it's hind legs and looking
at me like</b>
<br><b>dogs do. It's teeth were showing as if it were growling at me. I
saw all of</b>
<br><b>this from the reflection of the light from the bedroom that I was
leaving.</b>
<br><b>The main thing I can remember is it's shiny red eyes looking at
me. Then,</b>
<br><b>something in my mind told me to run. So, ofcourse, I did. I ran
all the way</b>
<br><b>back to the livingroom where my friend was sitting. On top of being
scared</b>
<br><b>to death, I was also pretty upset that he left me in that room alone.
It</b>
<br><b>just so happened that the next day my dad took us back to that house
so he</b>
<br><b>could do some medal detecting on the property. My friend and I went
back to</b>
<br><b>the bedroom where I saw the "thing", my friend thinking that it
could've</b>
<br><b>been a statue or something of his grandparents'. But there was nothing</b>
<br><b>there. Just that same wierd feeling and that foggy look in the air.
I have</b>
<br><b>never had another experience quite like this one again. So I'm thinking
that</b>
<br><b>it may have had something to do with the house.</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>The event which happened to me was on the 18/10/2000, I just came
back home from my girlfriends house at night about 11.15pm and as usuall
started falling asleep on the lounge, I fell asleep for 20 minutes then
I got myself up which I was fully awake then went into my bedroom to sleep
.</b>
<br><b>I got into bed with my duna sheet and 1 blancket very nice and warm
, I layed down on my back so just amagine your looking or facing directly
up at the seeiling . anyway I closed my eyes and started going to sleep
. I wasn't asleep but had my eyes closed ready to sleep .OK</b>
<br><b>I had my eyes shut completly , but after 5 minutes I felt like my
eyes could see the seeiling without me opening my eyes . I wasn't feeling
normal but I keeped my eyes shut , suddenly these small particals of black
looking balls formed into a shape and shadow of a human body , I couldn't
determine if it was a male or a female figure but it was a human shadow.</b>
<br><b>Once these fragment or particals made the figure of this body up
it was floating right above me in the same way I was lying down on my bed
, at this stage I was thinking what is this ?, anyway the next thing that
happened was the human figure droped into my body , firstly starting from
the feet droping or falling into my body , after this happened I instantly
didn't know what was happening, but I could feel this human body in me
, It was like I had someone else in my body .</b>
<br><b>After it entered me I felt 3 to 4 shocks of my body , I rised of
my bed 3 to 4 times like I was electricuted , I could feel that this human
wanted me to do something bad but I didn't let that happen.</b>
<br><b>I am Greek Nationality and my grandmother told me when I was small
that when you feel evil things are happening or see evil bad things happen
always say to yourself "I have always got you behind me satin", so when
this human shadow droped into me then shocked me 3 to 4 times I repeted
exactly that over and over again about 5 time during and after the shocks
and everytime I said it , it felt like the shadow was weakining and about
the 5th time I said it I felt it leave my body , I opened my eyes and started
crying , I was crying because I got scared and I then got my necklace cross
and prayed then slept ok during that night .</b>
<br><b>I also went to church a couple of days after it happened and lighted
up some candle for me and me family .</b>

<p><b>Spiritual Encounter?</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Mark.Johnson@pmg-awwc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>First of all, I want you to know how much I really enjoy your site.&nbsp;
I've</b>
<br><b>been reading the stories for a couple of weeks now and they have
helped me</b>
<br><b>to remember some specific instances from my childhood that I had
forgotten.</b>
<br><b>This really isn't a ghost story per se, but you might find it interesting.</b>
<br><b>I am 36 now, but while I was growing up in Los Angeles I can remember</b>
<br><b>several instances where I would clearly hear someone calling my
name.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>always assumed it was my mother calling me for some reason (which
she would</b>
<br><b>do quite often), but on those occassions she was on the other side
of the</b>
<br><b>house and would claim that she never called me.&nbsp; I just assumed
it was my</b>
<br><b>imagination or maybe it was someone yelling from one of the other
houses in</b>
<br><b>my neighborhood.&nbsp; But as time went on it happened frequently
enough for me</b>
<br><b>to realize that something wasn't right.&nbsp; I don't remember anything
unusual</b>
<br><b>happening to me during this time with the exception of being very
afraid of</b>
<br><b>the dark.&nbsp; I was always scared of waking up in the night and
seeing</b>
<br><b>something in my room.&nbsp; Getting up to go to the bathroom was
always a</b>
<br><b>frightening experience because I was always certain I would see
something in</b>
<br><b>my hallway.&nbsp; I don't remember ever actually seeing anything,
but that fear</b>
<br><b>was always present.&nbsp; I even picked up the habit of rocking
my bed and</b>
<br><b>singing to myself so that I wouldn't hear noises or see something
in my</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; I could just chalk it up to a child's overactive imagination
if it</b>
<br><b>wasn't for the fact that I would distinctly hear my name being called
on</b>
<br><b>several occasions.&nbsp; I wonder now if maybe a lot more happened
to me that my</b>
<br><b>mind is blocking out.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, when I was in my early twenties (and still living in the
same house</b>
<br><b>I grew up in) I woke up early one morning and was lying in bed when
I</b>
<br><b>clearly heard my name called again.&nbsp; It sounded like the person
was in my</b>
<br><b>room!&nbsp; I couldn't tell if it was a man's or woman's voice,
it seemed rather</b>
<br><b>androgynous.&nbsp; But I suddenly felt compelled to answer it for
the first time,</b>
<br><b>so I simply responded, "Yes."&nbsp; Immediately it felt as if I
was falling down</b>
<br><b>a large hole.&nbsp; My vision went black and it felt like I was
sinking deep into</b>
<br><b>the bed, almost as if I were going into a trance.&nbsp; I could
not move or</b>
<br><b>hardly even breathe!&nbsp; This scared the hell out of me and and
I did my best</b>
<br><b>to fight it off, repeating over and over, "go away...go away...go</b>
<br><b>away.....".&nbsp; After several moments I started to feel normal
again and the</b>
<br><b>pressure lifted.&nbsp; I had no idea what had just happened.&nbsp;
I quickly put it</b>
<br><b>out of my mind until just last year when I moved from Los Angeles
to be with</b>
<br><b>my fiance in New Jersey.&nbsp; We were driving cross country and
we spent one</b>
<br><b>night in a hotel in Indianapolis.&nbsp; We had just gone to bed
and my fiance</b>
<br><b>fell instantly to sleep when I thought I could hear voices in the
room next</b>
<br><b>to us.&nbsp; It almost sounded as if a party were going on next
door, yet I</b>
<br><b>couldn't make out anything that was being said.&nbsp; After listening
to them for</b>
<br><b>a moment I had a strange feeling come over me that something was
about to</b>
<br><b>happen.&nbsp; Then the same feeling that hit me several years before
began again</b>
<br><b>and I felt like I was being pulled deep into the bed.&nbsp; I know
I fell into</b>
<br><b>some kind of trance, but I didn't fight it this time.&nbsp; I was
extremely</b>
<br><b>curious and wanted to see what would happen.&nbsp; After what seemed
like a few</b>
<br><b>moments of blackness I could see strange geometric shapes floating
before</b>
<br><b>me, but they were unrecognizable and were glowing with odd colors.&nbsp;
One</b>
<br><b>shape would float before me for a few seconds, then change into
a different</b>
<br><b>shape.&nbsp; This went on for a several minutes until the next thing
I knew I was</b>
<br><b>back in my bed awake.&nbsp; I immediately woke my fiance and told
her what</b>
<br><b>happened.&nbsp; I slept the rest of the night without incident,
but I often</b>
<br><b>wonder what would have happened years before if I had not gotten
scared and</b>
<br><b>fought off that experience.&nbsp; I have not had anything happen
to me since that</b>
<br><b>experience</b>

<br><b>Minnesota Reservation</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: fuzzy1962@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Thank you for the wonderful site. One thing that makes the ghost
stories so</b>
<br><b>believable is that they're everyday. No sensationalism.</b>
<br><b>I grew up on an Indian reservation in northern Minnesota, and in
the 1960s</b>
<br><b>my family lived in a big house that was probably built between 1900
and</b>
<br><b>1920.&nbsp; It was a 2-story house that was weather-beaten on the
outside and had</b>
<br><b>a rusty tin roof.&nbsp; In the 1960s we still had an outhouse and
no phone.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>bottom floor of the house was one big room that was our kitchen,
dining</b>
<br><b>room, and living room.&nbsp; The top floor was another big room
that had all our</b>
<br><b>beds, 6 in all, lined up on either side of the room.&nbsp; The top
floor had two</b>
<br><b>large windows on either side of it, one facing west and the other
facing</b>
<br><b>east.&nbsp; To get from the top floor down to the bottom, you stepped
through a</b>
<br><b>large square cut in the floor of the second story and started down
a steep,</b>
<br><b>narrow, enclosed, L-shaped staircase.&nbsp; Two small stairs made
up the foot of</b>
<br><b>the L, and coming out of the stairwell brought you to the front
door, which</b>
<br><b>was on the right.</b>
<br><b>Around 1967, my family moved out of that house and into one that
actually</b>
<br><b>had indoor plumbing and a phone, thanks to the hard work of my aunt.&nbsp;
But we</b>
<br><b>could still see the old house from our new house.&nbsp; A young
couple with two</b>
<br><b>small children moved into our old house then, which was just a 5
minute walk</b>
<br><b>down a dirt road.</b>
<br><b>In 1967 I was 5 years old and my cousin Angela (not her real name)
was</b>
<br><b>around 17 years old.&nbsp; One night the young couple asked Angie
if she would</b>
<br><b>baby-sit and she said yes.&nbsp; So down the dirt road she went,
and when she got</b>
<br><b>to the house she found that the couple had made a significant change
in the</b>
<br><b>house’s arrangement.&nbsp; The house had been built in a time and
place where the</b>
<br><b>only heat source installed was a woodburning stove on the first
floor.&nbsp; This</b>
<br><b>made the house too cold for two small children.&nbsp; So the husband
boarded up</b>
<br><b>the stairwell to the 2nd floor and the family did all their living
on the</b>
<br><b>1st floor.&nbsp; Boards were now nailed up where the L-shaped stairwell
had</b>
<br><b>emptied out by the front door.</b>
<br><b>When it grew late, Angie put the 2 children to bed and sat by them
listening</b>
<br><b>to the radio.&nbsp; (At night we could get KOMO from Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma.)</b>
<br><b>At around 10 o’clock, she heard a THUMP up above her on the 2nd
floor and</b>
<br><b>thought maybe something had fallen over.&nbsp; Since the stairwell
had been</b>
<br><b>boarded over, there was no way to check.&nbsp; But the night grew
quiet again and</b>
<br><b>Angie went back to listening to the radio (she’s not a reader, not
even</b>
<br><b>magazines), until another THUMP sounded above her head.&nbsp; It
seemed to be</b>
<br><b>close to the 2nd floor’s large east-facing window.&nbsp; A second
or two later,</b>
<br><b>another THUMP, and then THUMP, THUMP, THUMP, THUMP.&nbsp; The sound
was moving</b>
<br><b>across the 2nd floor above her head like the footsteps of a man
wearing</b>
<br><b>boots.</b>
<br><b>Still, Angie dismissed the pacing sounds above her head.&nbsp; She
had heard a</b>
<br><b>story once where a family thought they had a ghost in their attic
and it was</b>
<br><b>only squirrels storing nuts.&nbsp; She paid no attention to the
steady thumps.</b>
<br><b>Could be squirrels, or . . . something more typical.&nbsp; Angie
was a popular</b>
<br><b>girl in high school and was always being asked for dates.&nbsp;
She wouldn’t have</b>
<br><b>been surprised for a moment if some boy from school had climbed
in the 2nd</b>
<br><b>floor window (my family used to keep a tall ladder outside for repairing
the</b>
<br><b>roof), hoping to scare her.</b>
<br><b>Angie stayed by the children, still listening to KOMO, Oklahoma
City, and,</b>
<br><b>as suddenly as they had begun, the footfalls stopped.&nbsp; For
a moment.&nbsp; When</b>
<br><b>they started again, Angie realized with alarm that they were no
longer</b>
<br><b>pacing back and forth on the 2nd floor.&nbsp; The thumping footsteps
were coming</b>
<br><b>down the stairwell, quietly and carefully.&nbsp; Suddenly Angie
laughed to</b>
<br><b>herself.&nbsp; If it was a boy from school, he was in for a rude
awakening.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>stairwell had been boarded over, after all, and he was going to
have to go</b>
<br><b>back up the way he came down.&nbsp; His plan was probably to jump
out of the</b>
<br><b>stairwell and surprise her.</b>
<br><b>The footsteps stopped at the end of the L, as if a person were standing
on</b>
<br><b>the other side of the nailed-up boards.&nbsp; Angie waited, amused,
for the boy</b>
<br><b>to retreat.&nbsp; But the night grew quiet.&nbsp; The house grew
quiet.&nbsp; Until all of</b>
<br><b>a sudden Angie heard a THUMP over her head, underneath the east-facing
2nd</b>
<br><b>floor window, as she had heard the first THUMP that night.&nbsp;
Another THUMP</b>
<br><b>followed, and then the footsteps started again, across the floor,
east to</b>
<br><b>west, and then, to Angie’s increasing alarm, down the stairwell.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>footsteps stopped again where the stairwell was boarded up.</b>
<br><b>Angie sat frozen in terror, next to the sleeping children, who were
unaware</b>
<br><b>of the thumping noises from above them or Angie’s terror.&nbsp;
The footsteps</b>
<br><b>didn’t belong to any person, or even an animal, because they never
turned</b>
<br><b>and went back up the stairs.&nbsp; The footsteps always stopped
where the</b>
<br><b>stairwell had been boarded up, and they always started again on
the east</b>
<br><b>side of the house under the 2nd floor window.</b>
<br><b>Angie’s first thought was to run, and run home, which, thankfully,
was so</b>
<br><b>close.&nbsp; And yet so far away.&nbsp; She couldn’t leave the children.&nbsp;
She couldn’t</b>
<br><b>carry them, either.&nbsp; They were little children, but not that
little.</b>
<br><b>And so Angie waited, terrified, for the young couple to return home.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>stayed with the children, listening to the footsteps over her head
start</b>
<br><b>under the eastern window, walk across the floor, down the stairwell,
stop,</b>
<br><b>and then start again.</b>
<br><b>When I first heard this story, I was a teenager in the 1970s, and
when I</b>
<br><b>looked back to around the time this ghost story happened, I remembered
that</b>
<br><b>my cousin Angie changed for a brief period in her life.&nbsp; Always
a pragmatic</b>
<br><b>girl, she suddenly became fearful – afraid of the dark, afraid to
be home</b>
<br><b>alone.&nbsp; I remember one time in particular when I was around
10 years old, my</b>
<br><b>family and I returned home at night to find Angie looking out the
screen</b>
<br><b>door, her face pale, and she cold on a hot summer night, watching
us drive</b>
<br><b>up, and saying&nbsp; Where have you been?, nearly hysterical.&nbsp;
She returned home</b>
<br><b>during the day to find the house empty and became more and more
afraid as</b>
<br><b>the sun faded from the sky and night came on.</b>
<br><b>This is the reason why I believe Angie’s story is true.&nbsp; She
changed for</b>
<br><b>awhile.&nbsp; Today she’s back to her old self – fearless and a
true skeptic.</b>
<br><b>Incidentally, that old house burned to the ground not long after
Angie heard</b>
<br><b>the ghostly footsteps.&nbsp; The house built in its place burned
down, also, as</b>
<br><b>did the house built after that.&nbsp; Today nothing stands there.&nbsp;
It’s an empty</b>
<br><b>lot overgrown with milk weeks, poison ivy, and tall grass.</b>

<br><b>Strange Happenings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jhitp@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>In the summer of 1999 my husband and I took a trip to the Upper Peninsula
of Michigan and visited Point Iroquois in Brimley, Michigan. This old lighthouse
was home to a few keepers that watched over Lake Superior. When touring
the museum ( a very small one at that) inside the lighthouse, I asked the
lady behind the desk if there was a ghost there. She gave me a funny look
and said, 'Yes, there is a "presence" here.' And I kid you not, as soon
as she said that all the smoke alarms went off and scared the heck out
of us! The lady went back to check it out and then they stopped. As soon
as she started walking back towards us, they went off again. We decided
to leave at that point. A year later, we went back to the lighthouse...the
same lady was behind the desk...I told her I was there when the alarms
went off and she replied, 'You know, that hasn't happened since that time.'
Looks like I roused him or her out of their slumber that year! Anyway,
I didn't see Point Iroquois on your list of Michigan Haunted PLaces....so,
maybe it's worth looking into. Thanks for letting me tell my story.</b>

<p><b>Sweet Dreams</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mmihnat@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Ever since I was a child I have always been able to sense any type
of presence no matter where I happen to be.&nbsp; Always without any warning.&nbsp;
Particularly in my bedroom I always felt a door would open and stay that
way until I moved into a new residence.&nbsp; Fortunately I have a husband
who can sense these occurrances as well so at least I don't feel like I'm
loosing it.&nbsp; I fully accept an after life of some sort but it is unsettling
to constantly feel someone there, feel pressure, or hear a voice or see
movement.&nbsp; Many times it is not negative but I won't say that is not
always the case.&nbsp; Even in in dreams I'll meet family members from
my husband's side who have long since past away&nbsp; way before we met
accepting me in the family and looking out for us.&nbsp; That I must admit
can be very much a comfort especially since some people living are not
always as accepting in some families.&nbsp; I will give you a perfect example
of this........ In a very clear dream I was at a beautiful lake.&nbsp;
On the edge of the lake there was a gazebo. It was not huge but it was
big enough to have a small table with 2 chairs. The set was all white.&nbsp;
There was an elegantly dress elderly man waiting there to greet me. He
was about 5'9", balding, blue eyes, large ears and a warm smile.&nbsp;
He gave me a hug and motioned me to the chair.&nbsp; I noticed that I was
dressed in a white laced victorian style dress.&nbsp; I could not remember
hearing a conversation, but when it was over I got up to leave and he then
gave me a black velvet jewelry bag.&nbsp; I hugged him and he gave me a
kiss on the cheek. As I left I woke up.</b>
<br><b>The next day I was to go to then my future in-law's house and on
the way, I told my fiance' the dream.&nbsp; He said that I should relate
the dream to his mom that evening.&nbsp; Fortunately we all hit it off
real well and as the evening progressed I related the story to his mom.&nbsp;
She asked me to see some family photos and I stopped cold on one.&nbsp;
There on a page was an elderly gentleman, balding, with large ears and
that beautiful smile. It turned out to be my fiance' grandfather on his
dad's side, referred to as Pop.</b>
<br><b>Pop has enjoyed visiting us and it has been 11 years that we have
been happily married.&nbsp; I guess he was happy to see that the second
time around for his grandson was a charm.</b>
<br><b>We have had many things happened but those are other stories to
tell.</b>

<p><b>Tall Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DCRAWFORD@ci.baton-rouge.la.us</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I've heard different accounts of "tall" ghosts in my life, which
reminds me</b>
<br><b>of something I don't consciously remember.</b>
<br><b>I am told that when I was a small child of about three or four years
of age,</b>
<br><b>I often announced to my mom "the man in the window is back!"</b>
<br><b>I grew up in a house in New Orleans of the traditional "shotgun"
house</b>
<br><b>style, a long, narrow house raised up off the ground a few feet
because of</b>
<br><b>occasional flooding, with shuttered windows.&nbsp; The neighborhood
was a typical</b>
<br><b>New Orleans turn-of-the century neighborhood, with many of these
houses</b>
<br><b>packed close together, separated by very narrow alleys, set so close</b>
<br><b>together that housewives would often gossip (or borrow sugar) through
open</b>
<br><b>kitchen windows. You could lean over the windowsill, stretch out
your arm,</b>
<br><b>and easily touch the neighbor's house.</b>
<br><b>My mother tells me that I would often be playing on the floor indoors,
in</b>
<br><b>the early evening, when I would suddenly go running into the kitchen
to</b>
<br><b>announce that "the man" was in the window.&nbsp; Once my mother
pressed me for a</b>
<br><b>detailed description, and I'm told I described a man in "raggy clothes"
and</b>
<br><b>mimicked the body posture of a person leaning forward with his hands
on the</b>
<br><b>windowsill, peering into the house.&nbsp; The only problem, of course,
is that a</b>
<br><b>real person would have to be eight or nine feet tall to do this,
or else</b>
<br><b>stand on a stepladder!</b>
<br><b>My mom says she originally theorized that I was simply seeing the
man next</b>
<br><b>door through the alley windows, but after awhile she realized that
the</b>
<br><b>neighbors often had their windows shuttered, so this convenient
explanation</b>
<br><b>had to be dismissed.</b>
<br><b>Also, the alley was closed off by a tall, latched gate on each end.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>mother, of course would immediately stick her head out to see if
there was a</b>
<br><b>prowler, but this was unlikely because often the windows were open
(she</b>
<br><b>would have heard someone lurking at such close quarters) and she
always</b>
<br><b>stuck her head out fast enough that the intruder would have had
to have run</b>
<br><b>awfully fast, to get away, and even if he did, the gate would always
be</b>
<br><b>closed.&nbsp; No fleeing prolwer closes the gate behind himself!&nbsp;
Besides, this</b>
<br><b>was the very early 1960s when crime was not a big concern.</b>
<br><b>Being Irish Catholic and easily spooked, these sightings upset my
mother.</b>
<br><b>She says the sightings continued until we moved away from that house,</b>
<br><b>shortly after my fifth birthday.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were pretty frequent,
a few times a</b>
<br><b>month, and I was always scared by this apparition.</b>
<br><b>Do you have any sources or stories about "tall" ghosts and what
they might</b>
<br><b>represent?&nbsp; I'm also part Cherokee and there is a particular
"tall spirit"</b>
<br><b>whose sightings presage the death of the viewer or a loved one,
but my</b>
<br><b>childhood description does not match this spirit.&nbsp; Incidentally,
my</b>
<br><b>grandmother died right before we moved from that house.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Family Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Belle695@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My parents have both passed away.&nbsp; My mother died in August
of 1999 in aan</b>
<br><b>assisted living facility.&nbsp; She was 62 years old.&nbsp; My father
died in 1990.</b>
<br><b>He had a heart attack at home.&nbsp; The death certificate said
he died in the</b>
<br><b>hospital, but my sister was present when they took him out.&nbsp;
They performed</b>
<br><b>CPR all the way out of the home and until they reached the hospital.&nbsp;
He was</b>
<br><b>administered "the shot" in the home.&nbsp; She says she thinks he
really died at</b>
<br><b>home.&nbsp; He was 52.</b>
<br><b>I moved into the house in June of 1999 with the blessings of my
mother.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>niece by marriage (a girl I had never met before, age 9) was sleeping
in the</b>
<br><b>den of the home.&nbsp; The next morning the girl told her mother
that she had met</b>
<br><b>the Man, and that she thought he might be a ghost, but that he was
very nice</b>
<br><b>and was smiling.&nbsp; Please note that my father collapsed in the
den, and that</b>
<br><b>this took place prior to my mother's death.</b>
<br><b>Since that time my husband was sleeping in our den.&nbsp; That night
a floor lamp</b>
<br><b>with a foot control (not a touch lamp) would slowly turn on any
then off.</b>
<br><b>It did this 3 time over a period of any hour.&nbsp; This occurred
in January 2000.</b>
<br><b>On mother's day 2000, I awoke and needed to go to the bathroom.&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>opened the bathroom door to climb back into bed, I saw my mother
standing in</b>
<br><b>the far corner of the room.&nbsp; I jumped into the bed and covered
my head so I</b>
<br><b>don't know what happened after that.</b>
<br><b>In June of this year, my husband was in a chair, in our den, bent
over tying</b>
<br><b>his shoes when he felt a light touch on his left middle back.&nbsp;
He leaned</b>
<br><b>back</b>
<br><b>in the chair, and felt the same touch through the chair.&nbsp; He
was alone.</b>
<br><b>In July of this year, my husband was in the den again, alone and
watching</b>
<br><b>tv.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;He noticed a motion to his left close to a window.&nbsp; This
window had a</b>
<br><b>shade, the cheap kind that you buy at a discount store.&nbsp; He
noticed that blind was</b>
<br><b>being pulled down a little and adjusted up.&nbsp; He discounted
this to the</b>
<br><b>extreme Texas heat.</b>
<br><b>Prior to all of the above, my mother, who scoffed a the idea of
ghosts, had</b>
<br><b>several encounters of a "swoosh" sound and then the feeling of someone</b>
<br><b>coming</b>
<br><b>to bed with her.&nbsp; My mother and I both were very skeptical
about any</b>
<br><b>supernatural activity, we even made fun of my sister who has always
believed</b>
<br><b>in ghosts.</b>
<br><b>The one thing that all of my sisters and me noticed in this house,
both when</b>
<br><b>we were there alone or together, was that when we were in our kitchen,
we</b>
<br><b>would notice out of the corner of our eye to the right a motion
or a light</b>
<br><b>in the living room adjacent to the kitchen.</b>
<br><b>I have since moved,&nbsp; I could not stand the pressure and was
extremely</b>
<br><b>frightened.&nbsp; You see I came from a dysfunctional family, where
any slight</b>
<br><b>mistake was considered a crime.&nbsp; Everything was wonderful if
you didn't do</b>
<br><b>anything to disappoint my parents, but if you did it was a harsh
beating or</b>
<br><b>an all night lecture and a list of everything you had ever done.</b>
<br><b>The reason for this letter is that we have this house up for sale.&nbsp;
It would</b>
<br><b>be a wonderful opportunity for any of my sisters (2) or brother.&nbsp;
One of my</b>
<br><b>sisters is considering buying this property but is apprehensive
if she will</b>
<br><b>be haunted.</b>

<br><b>The Green Man</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Autumnbreez88@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This story takes place in central Ft. Wayne, Indiana.&nbsp; My mother
and father</b>
<br><b>moved into what is believed to be a late 1800's or early 1900's
home. (Some</b>
<br><b>history had been done on the house, but unfortunately dead-ended
about the</b>
<br><b>late 1940's)&nbsp; My mother and father had just recently come back
to Ft. Wayne</b>
<br><b>after living in North Carolina, where my dad was stationed after
Viet Nam.</b>
<br><b>They had come across this two-story house, and began renting in
the early</b>
<br><b>1970's.&nbsp; After I came along in 1973, we stayed in the house
until I was</b>
<br><b>three, but while we were there, some strange things happened.&nbsp;
In one</b>
<br><b>incidence, my mother was upstairs in the bathing in the bathroom
at the end</b>
<br><b>of the hall.&nbsp; Suddenly the doorknob started to rattle.&nbsp;
Thinking it was my</b>
<br><b>father, my mother said for him to come in.&nbsp; The rattling stopped,
then</b>
<br><b>started up again a few seconds later.&nbsp; Again, she stated the
the door was</b>
<br><b>unlocked and he could enter.&nbsp; It stopped again.&nbsp; When
my mother told this to</b>
<br><b>my father, she asked him why he didn't come in, and he said "Come
in where?"</b>
<br><b>She explained to him what had happened, and he said he was downstairs</b>
<br><b>watching T.V.&nbsp; Another occurance happened one night when my
dad was working</b>
<br><b>third shift.&nbsp; He decided to sleep in the downstairs bedroom
located next to</b>
<br><b>the stairwell, like he did sometimes after work.&nbsp; He was not
in bed too long</b>
<br><b>when he heard footsteps coming down the wooden staircase.&nbsp;
He knew he was the</b>
<br><b>only one home because my mother had left for work already.&nbsp;
He didn't hear</b>
<br><b>anyone walking around downstairs, and chalked it up to overtiredness.&nbsp;
A few</b>
<br><b>minutes later he heard someone coming down the stairs again.&nbsp;
This time my</b>
<br><b>father grabbed&nbsp; baseball bat and came out of the bedroom to
see what was</b>
<br><b>going on.&nbsp; He couldn't find anyone, and my father was getting
upset.&nbsp; This</b>
<br><b>continued about a half of a dozen times.&nbsp; Always coming down,
but not going</b>
<br><b>back up.&nbsp; Finally my father became angry and yelled out "Look,
I am not</b>
<br><b>getting up again.&nbsp; You know where I am, if you want me come
and get me!"</b>
<br><b>After that, it stopped.&nbsp; On one occassion, according to my
parents, I was</b>
<br><b>asleep upstairs in my bedroom at the end of the hall opposite the
bathroom.</b>
<br><b>My parents were downstairs watching T.V. when they heard me hit
the floor and</b>
<br><b>run across the hall.&nbsp; My parents ran upstairs to make sure
I wasn't hurt.</b>
<br><b>When they got upstairs, they found me in my room, still asleep in
my crib.</b>
<br><b>My mother told me that whenever we would go away for the day or
night, we</b>
<br><b>never left any lights on.&nbsp; But every time we came home, all
the lights in the</b>
<br><b>house would be on.&nbsp; We moved out of the house in 1976, and
my parents'</b>
<br><b>friends and their son, who was only 11 months older than me, moved
in.&nbsp; So we</b>
<br><b>visited the houe alot.&nbsp; Our friends moved out of the house
and to Nebraska</b>
<br><b>when I was five.&nbsp; But not until about five years ago, when
my dad's friend</b>
<br><b>visited from Nebraska, he had told me a story about the house that
I hadn't</b>
<br><b>heard before.&nbsp; He said that shortly before they moved out,
his son was</b>
<br><b>upstairs in his bedroom, which used to be my old room.&nbsp; He
said that he heard</b>
<br><b>his son talking to someone.&nbsp; He started up the stairs and came
to the</b>
<br><b>landing.&nbsp; The stairs are positioned in such a way to where
you have to go up</b>
<br><b>about seven stairs and then you come to a landing where the stairway
makes a</b>
<br><b>turn to the left, and you go up the second set of seven stairs.&nbsp;
As he got to</b>
<br><b>the landing to make his way up the second set of stairs, he couldn't
move.</b>
<br><b>He said that he felt a force pressing against his chest, holding
him to the</b>
<br><b>landing.&nbsp; The whole time he could hear his son continue to
talk to someone,</b>
<br><b>he felt this force holding him, but could see nothing.&nbsp; Finally,
when his son</b>
<br><b>stopped talking, the force released him, and he ran upstairs to
his son's</b>
<br><b>bedroom.&nbsp; He asked his son who he was talking to, and his son
said "the green</b>
<br><b>man".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is the only one that we know of who has
seen whatever or whoever</b>
<br><b>is in the house.&nbsp; Sometime later, when I was about ten, my
mother and I were</b>
<br><b>going to neighborhood garage sales.&nbsp; It just so happened that
the people who</b>
<br><b>lived in the house were having a sale.&nbsp; I begged my mother
to go and talk to</b>
<br><b>the lady about the house.&nbsp; My mother went up and simply said
that we used to</b>
<br><b>live in the house and wondered if they had any unusual experiences
since they</b>
<br><b>moved in.&nbsp; And when the lady looked at my mom with somewhat
wide eyes and</b>
<br><b>said "Oh, you mean like the footsteps upstairs?"&nbsp; We knew then
that there was</b>
<br><b>definitely something, or someone, who still called the place home.</b>

<p><b>The Invisible Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: receptionist@RELSYS-INC.COM</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello.&nbsp; I have told a few people of this experience but never
written it</b>
<br><b>down.&nbsp; When I was 5, (1957) my parents moved our family from
a beautiful</b>
<br><b>home in Pasadena, California, to a new home in the then very small
town of</b>
<br><b>Costa Mesa , California.&nbsp; The house was one of 3 built at the
same time and</b>
<br><b>was surrounded by fields.&nbsp; At the corner of the block was an
old farmhouse;</b>
<br><b>possibly 50 years old or so.&nbsp; Please keep this in mind as I
believe that</b>
<br><b>some of the ghosts originally lived/died in this home.</b>
<br><b>My first experience that I remember ( I was about 6 or 7) was shortly
after</b>
<br><b>my father had the "dog catcher" take my dog to be put to sleep.&nbsp;
Of course I</b>
<br><b>was told he was going to a farm to live and believed it.&nbsp; My
grandmother had</b>
<br><b>recently passed away.&nbsp; I was sleeping in my bed when for some
reason, I woke</b>
<br><b>up.&nbsp; There was my grandmother sitting on the end of the bed
with Freckles,</b>
<br><b>my dog smiling.&nbsp; She said nothing as I recall and I felt no
fear, as she was</b>
<br><b>so familiar to me.&nbsp; I went back to sleep.</b>
<br><b>From that time on I would hear noises inside&nbsp; as well as outside
the house.</b>
<br><b>At night I would hear my mothers antique bottle collection moving
around and</b>
<br><b>the glasses in the bar moving.&nbsp; I would hear "things" running
between our</b>
<br><b>house and the one next door.&nbsp; We something like an alley between
their house</b>
<br><b>and ours and it might have been 12 feet wide at the most.&nbsp;
I would stick my</b>
<br><b>head up just far enough to peak out the window but I never saw a
thing.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>noise was so loud I could not believe no one else heard it.&nbsp;
I never told my</b>
<br><b>folks about it.&nbsp; I was the youngest and of course not to be
given and</b>
<br><b>credence.&nbsp; When I was alone, I never felt quite alone.&nbsp;
I always felt that</b>
<br><b>someone was there, watching.</b>
<br><b>By far the most terrifying experience was when I was about 10.&nbsp;
I had a bird</b>
<br><b>and it was my job to once a week to clean his cage.&nbsp; I did
this outside,</b>
<br><b>between the two houses where I could put the newspaper in the garbage.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>never liked going out there after dark, but my dad had a greenhouse
at the</b>
<br><b>time and to discourage vandals, he put a spot light, and I mean
a bright</b>
<br><b>spot light on the roof of the house so it would shine down not only
in our</b>
<br><b>yard but in the neighbors yard.&nbsp; It was so bright that I could
see the two</b>
<br><b>clotheslines at the end of the alley quite clearly.&nbsp; Anyway,
here I was</b>
<br><b>cleaning the bird cage when I hear the sound of running.&nbsp; I
had my back to</b>
<br><b>the noise so I turned around to see what was going on and as I</b>
<br><b>looked....well, this noise was running around the neighbors clothesline.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>was simply put, frozen in place.&nbsp; I was sure I was missing
something.&nbsp; This</b>
<br><b>can't be.&nbsp; Well, then it got worse.. the feet started running
toward me and</b>
<br><b>I still could not move.&nbsp; I just could not believe what I was
NOT seeing.&nbsp; As</b>
<br><b>it got closer, I guess self preservation kicked in because I ran
to the back</b>
<br><b>door and slammed it shut.&nbsp; I stood there waiting for the sound
to run by but</b>
<br><b>I don't remember if it did now some 40 years later.&nbsp; All I
do remember is</b>
<br><b>that I was amazed and scared all at the same time.</b>
<br><b>Years later, after I was married and my father had passed away,
my sister</b>
<br><b>and my niece, with whom I am very close, moved in with my mom to
keep</b>
<br><b>company.&nbsp; I found out recently that my niece would hear the
exact same</b>
<br><b>things in the house and outside of the house.&nbsp; She is the only
one of my</b>
<br><b>relatives who admits (or have heard; I not sure which one) to the
noises.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>once tried to bring the subject up after mom died but my siblings
just</b>
<br><b>laughed it off.&nbsp; It is still a subject between my niece and
myself.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>leave it at that.</b>
<br><b>My sister sold the house in 1976 and I have often wondered if the
new owners</b>
<br><b>have ever heard grandma moving moms bottles.</b>
<br><b>One footnote:&nbsp; my sister used to get mad and my niece and nephew
for moving</b>
<br><b>the bottles around.&nbsp; She never got the connection.</b><b></b>

<p><b>THE SHADOW</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: thomasne@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was about 6 yrs. old I lived in a duplex on State Avenue in
a town</b>
<br><b>called Coraopolis, PA. We lived in the bottom half of the home and
an</b>
<br><b>elderly woman lived upstairs. Anyway, one experience I had there,
and I can</b>
<br><b>still remember it so vividly, was with a gray floating figure. I
was asleep</b>
<br><b>in my room, my little sister was also in my room but she was in
her crib</b>
<br><b>sleeping, I was laying in bed with my dog when I woke up and looked
over to</b>
<br><b>the doorway of my room, there hovering in the doorway was this gray
figure,</b>
<br><b>it had holes through it and was oddly shaped, not like a human but
I could</b>
<br><b>tell it was a presence. I was frozen with fear, my dog also saw
it and began</b>
<br><b>growling, I laid there for such a long time afraid to move sweating,
I think</b>
<br><b>I tried calling out to my parents but was to frightened. I remember
telling</b>
<br><b>my family, and they just laughed, but I know what I saw because
I still</b>
<br><b>remember it to this day.</b>
<br><b>Also, my best friend lived next door to me, and my grandparents
lived next</b>
<br><b>door to her. Well, I know all 3 of these homes were haunted. My
best friends</b>
<br><b>mom was folding laundry when she went to check on her baby in his
playpen,</b>
<br><b>when she got back the laundry was thrown everywhere.</b>
<br><b>Now my grandparents had alot of experiences in there home. My grandparents</b>
<br><b>are very honest people and I know they wouldn't lie. They said that
before</b>
<br><b>they bought their house another family had lived there, a minister,
his wife</b>
<br><b>and their daughter. Anyway, they say the minister used to lock the
little</b>
<br><b>girl in the closet to punish her. well my grandparents said they
could</b>
<br><b>always her a little girl crying coming through the fireplace, it
stopped</b>
<br><b>once they bricked up the fireplace. Also, this mischevious ghost
used to go</b>
<br><b>into my youngest aunts room (she was still living at home) and toss
all her</b>
<br><b>records around her room. One night, my gram and aunt heard a loud
crash in</b>
<br><b>the kitchen, when they went out to see what had happend they found
a</b>
<br><b>grouping of little owls (home interior type, not real) that were
hanging on</b>
<br><b>the wall, all laying in a line on the kitchen floor with one of
them turned</b>
<br><b>in the other direction. My grandpap said one day he was having his
coffee in</b>
<br><b>the dining room when over top of his paper he watched as a picture
lifted</b>
<br><b>off the wall, cleared the fireplace mantel it hung above and went
crashing</b>
<br><b>to the floor. I had 2 experiences in this home, one was when I stayed
the</b>
<br><b>night as well as several of my cousins, anyway we were all sleeping
in one</b>
<br><b>of the bedrooms upstairs, on the one closet door hung a full length
mirror,</b>
<br><b>it was angled toward the hallway, I woke up and happend to look
at the</b>
<br><b>mirror (it was morning because it was light out) and when I looked
I saw a</b>
<br><b>man in all black with a black hood covering his face with a large
hatchet</b>
<br><b>(like a knight in one of those old castles would have), he was in
the</b>
<br><b>hallway outside the room and I could see him in the mirror. Another
thing</b>
<br><b>was I was visting one day when I was in the living room watching
tv, my</b>
<br><b>family was on the porch, I heard someone coming down the stairs,
I looked</b>
<br><b>over and saw noone so I got up and walked over to see who it was,
there was</b>
<br><b>no one there, I ran outside and wanted to leave immediately.</b>
<br><b>I am 28 yrs old now, and my husband and I bought this house I'm
in now off</b>
<br><b>of my other family member, none of my family ever lived here. I
don't know</b>
<br><b>of how old our home is or how many families lived here before, but
I know</b>
<br><b>the one before us. The husband and wife had passed away and thier
adult</b>
<br><b>children sold it to my relatives who live up the hill. Well, we
were here</b>
<br><b>only a few weeks, when our dog came running out of the bedroom carrying</b>
<br><b>something little in her mouth anand wagging her tail. When I grabbed
what</b>
<br><b>was in her mouth, it was a small little toy, it was a little sheep
made from</b>
<br><b>wool, and it was made in Germany. My husband and I have no idea
where it</b>
<br><b>came from, the bedroom was completely empty when we moved in, and
I know I</b>
<br><b>would have seen it. Maybe it was the former owner making peace with
our dog.</b>
<br><b>Who knows?</b>
<br><b>Anyways, I always felt very uneasy in that home of my grandparents,</b>
<br><b>especially upstairs, the bathroom was at the end of the hall and
I can</b>
<br><b>always remeber running to the steps from the bathroom and just a</b>
<br><b>overwhelming uneasy feeling when I had to walk past the bedrooms.</b>

<p><b>What Do We Really Know?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Ratnest9@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello.&nbsp; I'll give you a condensed version of what happened to
us.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>currently live in Florida but we owned a three family house in&nbsp;
Pa.&nbsp; We lived</b>
<br><b>there from 1992 to February of 2000.&nbsp; The house was built about
100 years ago</b>
<br><b>by a family of carpenters.&nbsp; The house was built for family
to live in with</b>
<br><b>their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sort of "the family home".&nbsp;&nbsp;
Anyway,&nbsp; after moving into</b>
<br><b>this house we had the feeling we were being watched.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our son was two at</b>
<br><b>the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well,&nbsp; one night I was in our dining
room and I just froze.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was stricken with fear that if I turned around, I'd see someone.&nbsp;
I was home</b>
<br><b>alone except for my son who was upstairs sleeping.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
was sitting at the</b>
<br><b>table typing a letter when this feeling came over me.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was so spooked that</b>
<br><b>I went outside and sat on the deck until my husband came home from
work.&nbsp; (he</b>
<br><b>worked nights)&nbsp;&nbsp; We agreed that we both felt "something"
in the house but</b>
<br><b>weren't sure if we believed in ghosts.&nbsp;&nbsp; My son would
get up in the morning</b>
<br><b>and tell me that "his sisters" were upstairs playing with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I could</b>
<br><b>hear him up there laughing and jabbering.&nbsp; I basically thought
noting of</b>
<br><b>this.&nbsp;&nbsp; When my son, Brian, was four, we finally got him
baptized.&nbsp; We had</b>
<br><b>finally found a church that we liked.&nbsp; I should also mention
that our shower</b>
<br><b>faucet was really old and made a squeaking noise when you turned
it on.&nbsp; Well</b>
<br><b>while eating dinner, often we'd hear the faucet turn but the shower
wasn't</b>
<br><b>wet.&nbsp; It was definitely the sound of the shower faucets turning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Anyway,</b>
<br><b>Brian was baptized on june 4, 1994 when he was four years old.&nbsp;
My sister was</b>
<br><b>staying with us for a few days.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said, this was
a three family house,</b>
<br><b>it was our house and we rented out two other apartments.&nbsp; We
occupied the</b>
<br><b>third apartment which consisted of the third and fourth floors.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The third</b>
<br><b>floor was our kitchen, dining room , living room and computer room.&nbsp;
Upstairs</b>
<br><b>(the fourth floor) was three bedrooms and a bathroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;
After the baptism, we</b>
<br><b>had family over and some friends and a small brunch.&nbsp; Everyone
finally left</b>
<br><b>except for my sister.&nbsp; That night, my sister and I went to
bed.&nbsp; My husband,</b>
<br><b>also Brian, said that he wanted to watch the weather and then he'd
come to</b>
<br><b>bed.&nbsp; I was in bed for about 20 minutes when Brian flew up
the stairs and</b>
<br><b>kneeled by the side of the bed obviously very shaken.&nbsp; I asked
him what was</b>
<br><b>wrong and he proceeded to tell me what he saw and felt.&nbsp; He
was laying on the</b>
<br><b>sofa watching the tv when he "felt" as though someone was coming
into the</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; Thinking it would be me or my sister, he leaned forward
and a woman</b>
<br><b>floated through the doorway between the dining room and the living
room.&nbsp;&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>said that she was wearing a night gown, she was all white and floating</b>
<br><b>although her legs were moving as it she was walking.&nbsp; Also,
she was carrying</b>
<br><b>something in her arms.&nbsp; He thought it may be a baby but he
wasn't sure.&nbsp; As</b>
<br><b>she passed the couch he was lying on, he said that he felt an incredible,</b>
<br><b>indescribable cold feeling.&nbsp; He said he was cold to the bone.&nbsp;&nbsp;
He said it</b>
<br><b>was almost paralyzing it was so cold.&nbsp; She drifted through
the room past him</b>
<br><b>and through the dining room wall and out.&nbsp;&nbsp; For a minute,
he was unable to</b>
<br><b>move.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he flew upstairs to tell me.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My husband, being a very credible</b>
<br><b>person had no problem convincing me of what he saw since we suspected</b>
<br><b>something anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp; At least now we knew.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The next few days were really</b>
<br><b>upsetting ... we didn't know if we should move, we didn't know if
our son</b>
<br><b>would be harmed, etc.&nbsp; I got in touch with a monsignor Essef.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We scheduled.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; He told me to try to be sure who she was so that we could
encourage her to</b>
<br><b>leave the house.&nbsp; In the meantime, he told me to leave her
notes telling her</b>
<br><b>to go home, that God was waiting for her.&nbsp; I left notes all
over the house</b>
<br><b>but nothing changed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I said out loud one day "Please,
if you won't leave,</b>
<br><b>just at least stay in the guest room because you're scaring me".&nbsp;
I really</b>
<br><b>believe she heard me because noises stopped for a while.&nbsp; Also,
we could hear</b>
<br><b>her walking upstairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Monsignor's visit coming
up I decided I needed</b>
<br><b>to call a family member who still lived in Dunmore.&nbsp; His name
is Paul and at</b>
<br><b>that time he was 67 years old.&nbsp; I told him who I was and that
we bought the</b>
<br><b>house from his brother's wife a few years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; I told
him that he would</b>
<br><b>think I was crazy but I needed to tell him my story.&nbsp; He believed
me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>thought for sure he'd think I was crazy.&nbsp; The next week, he
and his brother</b>
<br><b>came for lunch.&nbsp; They were both born in the house.&nbsp; In
fact, Paul was born in</b>
<br><b>our dining room which at the time of his birth, was a bedroom!&nbsp;
He brought</b>
<br><b>family pictures of people who lived in the house over the years.&nbsp;
As we were</b>
<br><b>looking through the pictures Brian saw the woman who floated through
the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; Her name was Jenny and she was Paul's aunt ... his
mother's sister.</b>
<br><b>In the picture, her arm was held in a sling.&nbsp; She had touched
a downed power</b>
<br><b>line in a storm and lost all use of that arm.&nbsp;&nbsp; THAT is
what Brian saw her</b>
<br><b>carrying.&nbsp;&nbsp; So at least now we had a name for Father Essef
when he came to</b>
<br><b>visit.&nbsp; We walked outside and they showed us the old grape
arbor and told us</b>
<br><b>stories about the house.&nbsp; His mother had lived in our apartment
and his Aunt</b>
<br><b>Jenny had lived in the apartment below us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While
we were chatting, Paul's</b>
<br><b>brother, Jimmy got me aside and told me that he definitely had the
feeling</b>
<br><b>that it was his mother in the house and not aunt Jenny.&nbsp; He
said that he just</b>
<br><b>"felt" her there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even tho Brian told him that he saw
Aunt Jenny, he felt</b>
<br><b>this way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we basically knew that it was
Aunt Jenny and felt</b>
<br><b>confident that we had the right name for Fr. Essef.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When Monsignor (Fr.)</b>
<br><b>Essef came into our home, the first words out of his mouth were,
"I sense two</b>
<br><b>presences here".&nbsp;&nbsp; We sat and prayed and prayed.&nbsp;
I also had invited my</b>
<br><b>pastor from my church to be with us.&nbsp; After about 10 minutes
of praying, we</b>
<br><b>definitely felt Jenny leave.&nbsp;&nbsp; We continued to pray but
nothing else</b>
<br><b>happened.&nbsp; That night, AGAIN we heard foot steps upstairs and
the shower</b>
<br><b>faucets squeaked.&nbsp; We also often heard a small closet door
slamming shut.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>heard this that night too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently Jenny's
sister (Jimmy's mother) WAS</b>
<br><b>in the house too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jenny left but Antoinette was
still there.&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW we knew</b>
<br><b>why my two year old son was telling us that he was playing with
his sisters!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The monsignor assured us that they were not evil and that
she would not hurt</b>
<br><b>us.&nbsp; Paul and Jimmy assured us that she loved children and
would never hurt</b>
<br><b>our son or us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that the reason she
was in the house is because</b>
<br><b>while she lived in our apartment (and Jenny in the second), Antoinette
had no</b>
<br><b>contact with anyone else in the house.&nbsp; She fought a lot in
past times and</b>
<br><b>never could see eye to eye.&nbsp; Our neighbor behind us knew them
all.&nbsp; I didn't</b>
<br><b>tell her what was going on but I asked questions about the family.&nbsp;
She said</b>
<br><b>that something happened and from that time on, they never spoke
to each other</b>
<br><b>again.&nbsp; (The family members, not the neighbor and the family)&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our neighbor</b>
<br><b>remained friends with the other siblings.&nbsp; Even her sons didn't
tell us about</b>
<br><b>this.&nbsp; While Fr Essef was in our home and we were praying,
he kept telling</b>
<br><b>Antoinette to "let go and forgive".&nbsp; Well now we knew what
that was all</b>
<br><b>about.&nbsp; We don't know why her sister Jenny, from the second
apartment was</b>
<br><b>there but at least she was gone now.&nbsp; From what we learned,
they will appear</b>
<br><b>to us to try to get help.&nbsp; I don't know if that's true or not
but we did get</b>
<br><b>her help getting "home".&nbsp; We sold the house last February and
as far as I</b>
<br><b>know, Antoinette is still there.&nbsp;&nbsp; (wow, did I say this
was going to be</b>
<br><b>short??)&nbsp;&nbsp; So basically, that's our story.&nbsp; We are
now believers and we don't</b>
<br><b>often tell this story.&nbsp; What we know really is much smaller
than what we</b>
<br><b>don't know!&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, thanks for listening.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghosts?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Sorensen@clds.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This story may sound really odd, at least it does to me but I sure
would like some insight if anyone has any.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; On October 3rd 1999 our beloved cat was found dead.
He always slept under the neighbors truck at night and on this particular
morning, the neighbor came out to go to town but our cat, Thomas, didn't
move like he usually did. To make a long story short, he had died in his
sleep from what the vet thinks may have been poisoning. That is upsetting
that someone would poison your pet but that was not the weird part.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after Thomas died, he would come
visit us. We were not freaked out about it or anything, just glad to see
him. He continued to come see us for about 4-5 months after his death then
he stopped. About a month or so after he stopped coming to see us, a person
started showing up in our house. We have a very small house and have lived
here for 3 years without ever a thing happening, until after Thomas died.
This person, was dressed in very dark clothes with a hat on like the hat
Indiana Jones wears. He would just appear in our hallway and walk down
the hall stopping at all the bedrooms and looking in. He never seemed to
enter the bedrooms but just stop and look in then after he checked them
all he would disappear. That was a bit spooky but nothing we were to freaked
out about until one night. He got to the last bedroom, my youngest daughters
room and this time he entered. I went running down the hall when I saw
him actually enter her room and there he was standing at the end of her
bed staring down at her. The hair was standing on end on the back of my
neck and I had a distinct feeling that this person was bad. I remember
trying to figure out how to get my daughter out of the room without causing
the man to do anything. I was really at a lose of what to do. At that point
I heard a meow and down the hall came Thomas. He looked like he was angry
and he stalked right past me, into my daughters room and up on her bed.
The dark man just disappeared then. He hasn't been back since but Thomas
comes back now and again. We don't see him anymore, just feel him. He climbs
in our laps or lays on us while we are in bed. My question is this, is
Thomas protecting us from the grave and if so, who was that man and why
was he interested in my 14 year old daughter?</b><b></b>

<p><b>Too Scared</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mikeun34@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I always hated Halloween.&nbsp; It's like being in a dark ally on
the west-side</b>
<br><b>of town or seeing the police behind your vehicle when your driving.&nbsp;
I'll</b>
<br><b>cut down to the point.&nbsp; I was about 19 years old when this
occurred.&nbsp; I had</b>
<br><b>my scary custom on and was ready to go Trick or Treating.&nbsp;
That day I felt</b>
<br><b>different, I ran over a black dog, got a speeding ticket, and my
girlfriend</b>
<br><b>dumped me.&nbsp; That night nothing was going to plan.&nbsp; A bunch
of friends and I</b>
<br><b>was suppose to attend a Halloween Party at a friends cabin, but
instead they</b>
<br><b>left me behind at home.&nbsp; I sure didn't want to drive up to
the cabin, but</b>
<br><b>that was my only choice.&nbsp; But that' not the worst part.&nbsp;
While heading up</b>
<br><b>hill to the party my sorry, piece-of-shit Ford Explorer died!&nbsp;
It was dark,</b>
<br><b>chilly night and nothing was staring except a full moon up high.&nbsp;
I tried to</b>
<br><b>stay in my car but unlucky me, my lights went dead.&nbsp; Nothing
would turn on.</b>
<br><b>While sitting silently in my dead car, I had no choice but to walk
up the</b>
<br><b>hill.&nbsp; I estimated that if I started walking I could get to
the cabin in 45</b>
<br><b>minutes.&nbsp; I grabbed my flashlight and headed my way up.&nbsp;
I tried calling the</b>
<br><b>cabin with my cell-phone but I couldn't get any signal.&nbsp; I
walked step after</b>
<br><b>step, heading higher and higher up the hill.&nbsp; Thirty minutes
passed by and</b>
<br><b>still not a car in sight. Now the weird things started happening.&nbsp;
As I</b>
<br><b>continue walking up the hill, I suddenly glanced to the road and
there lie a</b>
<br><b>body.&nbsp; I shined my flashlight upon that area and my eyes met
with dog lying</b>
<br><b>there half dead.&nbsp; I can see the dog taking his last couple
of breaths as he</b>
<br><b>waited for his death.&nbsp; I continue walking up the hill and all
of a sudden a</b>
<br><b>stroke of wind knock me off my feet. This was very scary because
there was</b>
<br><b>trees all around, no way a gush of wind could have blown by. And
the wind</b>
<br><b>was chilling cold. I thought to myself, should i run for the cabin
or the</b>
<br><b>car? The cabin was nearby and the car was way back down the hill.
This wind</b>
<br><b>chill was starting to really scare the pants off of me. I started
walking up</b>
<br><b>the hill faster. I started hearing what sounded like a car coming
up the</b>
<br><b>road. I thought to myself, ok good, i can hitch a ride up. I hear
the coming</b>
<br><b>up but i don't see any headlight!! The sound of a car got louder
and louder</b>
<br><b>but still no car show up. I shine the light down the road, nothing.
I</b>
<br><b>started walking again hoping the car will stop when it passes by
me. Now it</b>
<br><b>really got loud, like the car was right behind me, it's unmistakable.
Its a</b>
<br><b>car engine sound. I turned around, flash the light, nothing, but
as soon as</b>
<br><b>i spun around, the sound stopped. I was standing in the dead of
the night</b>
<br><b>with all my hairs pointing straight up. I got urge to run, so i
started</b>
<br><b>running up the hill with all the strength i had in me. This was
very scary,</b>
<br><b>as i'm running up the hill, things starting flashing by me. Cold
gusts of</b>
<br><b>wind, flashes of light from nowhere. Then i started to hear noises
like</b>
<br><b>moaning from the woods. I was almost in tears running up. I was
scared to</b>
<br><b>death, i could have gotten a heart attack. about 10 run up, i saw
the cabin.</b>
<br><b>Well lit from the inside with about 9 cars parked outside. I ran
straight at</b>
<br><b>the cabin screaming my lungs off. HELP! HELP! No one came out. I
could see</b>
<br><b>some people through the window but&nbsp; no one seems to look out
at me. I was</b>
<br><b>flashing my lights at them too. Now as I was nearing the gate to
the cabin,</b>
<br><b>i felt there was something following me. I can feel and hear something</b>
<br><b>running right behind me. But I didn't have the guts to turn at look.
I ran</b>
<br><b>straight up to the front door nearly breaking it down. Knocking
so hard they</b>
<br><b>shut off the music just to see what's going on. My friends open
the door and</b>
<br><b>i fell to the ground right in the doorway. They pulled me up inside
and ask</b>
<br><b>what was that all about. I was speechless. Every word i try to say
won't</b>
<br><b>come out. They said what happen why are your so cold. I couldn't
answer</b>
<br><b>them,&nbsp; i just pointed out the door. Few of them went outside
with</b>
<br><b>flashlights and looked around. At the same time i saw some people
laughing,</b>
<br><b>I guess they thought I was crazy. Crazy my ass, I was scared to
death.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>eyes wide awake, my body easily calming down, and my pants wet form
my own</b>
<br><b>urine.&nbsp; They laughed and criticize but what I experience that
day can never</b>
<br><b>ever be forgotten away.&nbsp; During the next morning I fetch a
ride with some</b>
<br><b>friends.&nbsp; We drove down the hill and stopped by my car.&nbsp;
It was totally</b>
<br><b>trashed.&nbsp; My tires slashed, my windows rolled down, and&nbsp;
frighten of all my</b>
<br><b>car was parked right beside the dead dog.&nbsp; Stained of blood
splattered all</b>
<br><b>over my front windshield as I stood there confused and scared.&nbsp;
I tried to</b>
<br><b>tell my friends that the dog wasn't suppose to be there and my car
broke</b>
<br><b>down about half a mile down from the stop where it was at.&nbsp;
While my car was</b>
<br><b>being towed back into town I got a bite to eat and Louie's House.&nbsp;
A local</b>
<br><b>restaurant that serve home made delight.&nbsp; As I began to slip
my hot co-co,</b>
<br><b>my eyes suddenly stop at a headline.&nbsp; I picked up the newspaper
which lied</b>
<br><b>on the counter.&nbsp; It reads "On this day, in loving memory of
my son, Jeffery</b>
<br><b>and his beloved companion Bifie, a black German Sheppard."&nbsp;
As I read the</b>
<br><b>article it listed these two lost their life while driving to a party
on</b>
<br><b>Halloween and droved off the cliff.&nbsp; No evidence was found
for what caused</b>
<br><b>their death.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Two Witnesses</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: foxie_kiss@hotmail.om</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have always convinced myself that the dark nights
hold&nbsp; creatures that</b>
<br><b>humans have never seen. Have you ever asked yourself what IS fear?
Fear is yet</b>
<br><b>simple. We only fear things cause we have not yet experience them
or Fear can be</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;we do not have knowledge of it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was only about a year ago when i was only
15. The streets were vacant</b>
<br><b>infront of my house and since I lived out in the country and not
really had a</b>
<br><b>curfew... I decided to take a little walk. I left my house not aware
what the</b>
<br><b>eerie night was going to show me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose it was about 12: 35 when I had
left my house. Very few cars drove</b>
<br><b>down at this time at night, and when they did I would sink into
the shadows not</b>
<br><b>to be picked up.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down the road from me, a new golf corse was being
constructed. They had not</b>
<br><b>clear all the forestry, but a&nbsp; few vacant pacthes here and
there of open fields</b>
<br><b>were exposed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is when I had my first encounted with fear.
It was quiet and still that</b>
<br><b>night. A car from on top of the hill was running down and I ran
off to the side</b>
<br><b>to hide that contained the golf corse construction. I watched the
car flash by</b>
<br><b>and finally I returned to the road's side.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I then heard breaking sticks and body movement
somehwhere not far from were</b>
<br><b>I was hiding. My first impalse was to turn to come across an animal
I&nbsp; would be</b>
<br><b>fimilar with. But my felt my heat sink way down with in me when
i did not see</b>
<br><b>anything. I walked a little closer towrds the the centure on the
left lain to</b>
<br><b>make sure I would not encouter it again. A few kilometers down the
road I felt</b>
<br><b>as though I was being wacthed from not a far distnace and being
followd. My</b>
<br><b>heart race just a little but I tried to keep myself under controll
and not to</b>
<br><b>panic hopefully over a obevies animal.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then came the heart renching sound. A cry
of a non-human non-animal rang</b>
<br><b>through the air as if it were waring or claming its attack. I jump
towrds the</b>
<br><b>centure line of the road. The scream went through my entire body
sending the</b>
<br><b>coldest chills possible down my spine. I could'nt think of any animal
it could</b>
<br><b>be. More scraping in the woods was heard. I swallowd hard and walked
on trying</b>
<br><b>to keep my distance from the open feild i was now paralle too. It
called out</b>
<br><b>again a few seconds later. I jump and ran to the opposite side of
the road.</b>
<br><b>Minutes past and i started to settle down. I had not heard anymore
sounds for a</b>
<br><b>mile or two.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I reached a lighted intersection of the street
where I stopped to&nbsp; calm</b>
<br><b>myself more before I continue on.&nbsp; Another car was in the distance
on the right</b>
<br><b>lane and there was no place to hid... Before I came into it;s veiw,
i ran across</b>
<br><b>the road to the opposit side. I&nbsp; slumped in the ditch and waited
for it to go</b>
<br><b>by. The car passed and continued out of sight. I brushed clumpes
of dried dirt</b>
<br><b>off of me and got back up. The right side of the street had more
house</b>
<br><b>bordering the road. The left side was vacant and contained more
fields to come.</b>
<br><b>I decided to stay on the left side to advoid coming incontact with
people and</b>
<br><b>there for getting repeorted to the police as tresspassing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had only just stepped into the shawdows when
the scream once again</b>
<br><b>returned. I almost lost my breath when another car speedliy was
coming towrds me</b>
<br><b>on the left lain and no time to run across the road. My only options
were to</b>
<br><b>hide in the ditch and hope that the noise wont come to close.. or
stand there</b>
<br><b>hoping I would not get picked up. I took my chances and hid the
the ditch. The</b>
<br><b>car seemed more slow then the others that had passed by earlier.
As it neared me</b>
<br><b>it slowed down. I held my breath hoping I was not sighted.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard leaves scattering and twigs cruching
under some weight. I encourage</b>
<br><b>the car to go on.. Why was it taking to so long.. Why was it almost
stopping at</b>
<br><b>this point. The scream wailed right behind me only a few feet away.
I screamed</b>
<br><b>out. I never thought I would. The car slightly passed me and I jump
out right</b>
<br><b>behind it and race to the other side. I was about 2 miles away from
my house now</b>
<br><b>and the screams still followd me on the ooposite side.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My fear died down again as I had not heard the
cries for some time again. I</b>
<br><b>was all well till I heard some groaning sounds on the right side
now as I passed</b>
<br><b>an open feild between two houses. It was coming towrds me.. The&nbsp;
that scream</b>
<br><b>called out. It seem like it had lavitaed over my head to the other
side. I</b>
<br><b>didn;t know how long I could bare it. I walked in the centure holding
my breath</b>
<br><b>waiting for more&nbsp; wailing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt releived when I saw one of my friends
houses up the road. I then</b>
<br><b>started running with out looking around or listening for the cries.
I approuched</b>
<br><b>his house not expecting to go up and accaully invite myself in since
it was now</b>
<br><b>2 o'clock. But luckiely he was just camping out in his back yard
with his</b>
<br><b>cousin. He heard my footsteps and suddenly appeard at the side of
the road. The</b>
<br><b>shocked expression on his face had me explain what i was doing out
this late...</b>
<br><b>Then when I explain to him I was being followd and he disbelived
me and said I</b>
<br><b>was just paranoide.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I realy don't know what encourged me to go on
but I told him I was going to</b>
<br><b>keep walking. He decided to go along with me not only cause at that
time he had</b>
<br><b>a slite crush on me but to keep me calm. Only a few yards from his
house while</b>
<br><b>walking on the right side again we come apon a grape vineyard. We
stood for a</b>
<br><b>few seconds&nbsp; while he tried to convince me to go back at my
house, but I turned</b>
<br><b>that option down. I did not want to return to my house by myself
now that I was</b>
<br><b>about 4 miles away from home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We saw a truck's head lights gradually move down
the paved road and we both</b>
<br><b>walked backwards into the grapevines. The cry yelled out again.
I saw his eyes</b>
<br><b>grow big with fear..."What the hell was that?" I saw him shake a
little too. I</b>
<br><b>did not reat the same way this time and i am not sure why&nbsp;
I was a little more</b>
<br><b>calm then him now. I told him I decided that I would walk a little
more and then</b>
<br><b>return home. The fact that he was a guy made it interesting that
I had to walk</b>
<br><b>him back espacailly when I was the one being followd all night.&nbsp;
I walked him</b>
<br><b>home and decided when I got there to return home before the sun
would rise. I</b>
<br><b>was about halfway between the two points when the sound was clearer
as a bell</b>
<br><b>and surrounded me. My heart hurt as it raced in my chest. I held
my hands over</b>
<br><b>my ears trying to drowned the sound out. I could still hear it .
I pressed</b>
<br><b>harder and took off in the middle of the roadand ran all the way
home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hit my drive way and ran into my lighted path
way. I ran inside of the</b>
<br><b>house and vowed never to return to the&nbsp; night road again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a true story and there has been two witnesses.
Although I had never</b>
<br><b>found out what makes those sounds.. I would be more prepared to
face it the next</b>
<br><b>time if I ever cross over it again.</b>

<p><b>&nbsp; Two Ghost Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: psyche_18@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Both of my ghost stories were very positive experiences and I hope
that they</b>
<br><b>all stay that way. My dad had this older lady friend who was part
of a</b>
<br><b>religion that is dying off. She was a very good friend of my fathers
and of</b>
<br><b>my family and of course we were all very upset when she died. When
we would</b>
<br><b>go visit her she would always be sitting in her rocking chair. She
loved to</b>
<br><b>sit in her chair. I had a rocking chair in my room and a few nights
after</b>
<br><b>she died the rocking chair just started to rock. There wasn't anyone
in the</b>
<br><b>chair that I could see but it was rocking on its own nonetheless.
It just</b>
<br><b>gave me a nice peaceful feeling to know that she was looking out
for me. My</b>
<br><b>second story concerns my beloved grandmother. My grandmother was
a wonderful</b>
<br><b>woman whom I loved very much. During the last year of her life I
helped take</b>
<br><b>care of her even though I was only eleven. I wouldn't trade any
of my time</b>
<br><b>with her for all of the money in the world. The last week before
she died my</b>
<br><b>parents would not allow me to see her because they were afraid that
I would</b>
<br><b>be afraid of her appearance. It makes me very upset that I never
got the</b>
<br><b>chance to tell her how much I loved her. A few years after her death
she</b>
<br><b>came to me, my mom and my aunt in a dream. She didn't talk to my
mom but she</b>
<br><b>talked to both me and my aunt. In my dream I was quite upset and
yelled at</b>
<br><b>her and told her that she was supposed to be dead and asked her
why she was</b>
<br><b>doing this to me? The only thing that she said to me was that she
was ok. I</b>
<br><b>don't know if this qualifies as seeing a ghost but I thought I would
just</b>
<br><b>share my experiences with the other side. Thanks.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Really Scary Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:techpilot@flashmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This wasn't really an experience with a ghost,
but it was</b>
<br><b>supernatural none the less. This happened only a few years ago,
and I</b>
<br><b>still remember all the details.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was traveling with my friend and my cousin
in law, to go dirt</b>
<br><b>biking. Well we had to travel through about a hundred miles (at
least</b>
<br><b>that's what it seemed like) of just barren desert, other than the
road.</b>
<br><b>Well after quite a while we came across a small town, when I say
small,</b>
<br><b>it was basically a mom &amp; pop restaurant, a small goods store
with two</b>
<br><b>gas pumps in front, and a motel.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we stopped and refueled the car and went
to go get something</b>
<br><b>to eat. While we were waiting for the food, I asked the owner if
he had</b>
<br><b>a restroom, he said just go through the food storage room, and the</b>
<br><b>bathroom was out back. So after I found it and was returning back</b>
<br><b>through the storage room, I had the first of two experiences.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt a little dizzy and after it had passed
the whole room had</b>
<br><b>changed, the large freezer that had once been closed was now open,
but</b>
<br><b>what had really caught my attention was the door, I had just passed</b>
<br><b>through. It looked like someone had just smashed it apart, it had
dents</b>
<br><b>protruding in and out. but what had caught my eye was the blood
stains</b>
<br><b>smeared all over it. After several seconds this had passed and</b>
<br><b>everything was like normal again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I had stopped shaking I told my friend
and cousin in law, they</b>
<br><b>laughed so hard they could've broken a rib, well after finishing
our</b>
<br><b>lunch we got up to leave, I was happy to leave that place, I just
had to</b>
<br><b>get away, but the most frightening experience happened when we got
to</b>
<br><b>our car.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dizziness had returned, but I refused to
open my eyes, because I</b>
<br><b>was just plain afraid of what I might see. Only this time when the</b>
<br><b>dizziness had gone away and I opened my eyes, I got the fright of
my</b>
<br><b>life.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The front of the small goods store (which was
roadside) was totally</b>
<br><b>collapsed, and the road itself was totally destroyed. But what really</b>
<br><b>scared me was all the dead soldiers laying about. They weren't shot,
but</b>
<br><b>just ripped apart by brute force. Then I experienced the worst part
of</b>
<br><b>it, at my feet was a dead soldier, he looked like something had
just</b>
<br><b>smashed him, and on the name plate pinned to his vest, it read "Sgt.</b>
<br><b>Justin Brimm" which of course almost gave me a heart attack.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure what happened after that but when
I finally came out of</b>
<br><b>whatever that was, I was laying across a table back in the restaurant,</b>
<br><b>with everyone standing over me, when I asked what had happened,
they</b>
<br><b>simply said I had ran off and never came back, and they found me
several</b>
<br><b>hours later passed out in the dirt in a small alley between the</b>
<br><b>restaurant and a house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no clue what any of that means though,
I don't plan on</b>
<br><b>joining the military, I'm not or never will be a cop, so I'm stumped
on</b>
<br><b>what any of that means.</b>

<br><b>Spirits</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JDAKOTADOG1@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I live pretty close to the Oglala Sioux indian reservation and I
know some</b>
<br><b>pretty crazy stuff.&nbsp; I've also had some srange experiences
too.&nbsp; Theres alot</b>
<br><b>of legends that come with living in that area,&nbsp; actually on
almost all of the</b>
<br><b>reservation.&nbsp; They're very spiritual.&nbsp; I'll just share
the scary stories.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>kow the main things they seem to see is what I like calling "little
people"</b>
<br><b>they're belived to live near water and usually in the woods.&nbsp;
They are</b>
<br><b>considered very sacred and your not supposed to look at them and
when you see</b>
<br><b>them.&nbsp; My grandmother, who's very spiritual, once told me a
story about when</b>
<br><b>she was younger she used to live in a small community on the reservation</b>
<br><b>called Red Shirt Table village.&nbsp; She told me that one day there
were two big</b>
<br><b>men building a fence for the water tank. While the men were shoveling
they</b>
<br><b>say two very small men, at most only knee height.&nbsp; One of the
men took his</b>
<br><b>shovel and killed one of the little men.&nbsp; The other little
man wasn't happy,</b>
<br><b>my grandma said that the little man only had too look at the man
and he just</b>
<br><b>died, then the little man picked up his partner and began to carry
him away</b>
<br><b>when he glanced up at the man, and of course all&nbsp; he did was
stand there in</b>
<br><b>shock watching,&nbsp; because he looked straight at the little man
he's paralized</b>
<br><b>from the neck down.&nbsp; I belive in them.&nbsp; I have heard tons
of stories on the</b>
<br><b>little men.&nbsp; They come around when there is a sweat and the
visit you when</b>
<br><b>your drinking too much.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down hear I've always been told not to wonder
out at night esspecialy</b>
<br><b>away from some type of light.&nbsp; They told me that if you walk
around at night</b>
<br><b>you could have someone walking with you and talking to you, like
a real</b>
<br><b>person only they're from the spirit world.&nbsp; They could even
follow you home.</b>
<br><b>My Uncle Mike,&nbsp; who live on the rez. in pine ridge told me
a story about a</b>
<br><b>back road from north ridge to east ridge&nbsp; at night.&nbsp; He
started walking and</b>
<br><b>when he had gotten about a fourth of the way a man walked up next
to him from</b>
<br><b>the side of the road.&nbsp; Mike started talking to this man like
he would to</b>
<br><b>anybody, and the man only answered in hmms and yes's, and looked
straight</b>
<br><b>ahead.&nbsp; So they walked almost all&nbsp; the way to the end
of the road and he</b>
<br><b>turned to say later and the man was gone, he just kinda disappeared.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>didn't think twice and he just took off. I remember one night when
I was with</b>
<br><b>one of my cousins for the night and we were just leaving from the
party and</b>
<br><b>as we reached the end of the porch at the top of the stairs I looked
towards</b>
<br><b>the left end of the yard past the bushes and behind the bushes there
was a</b>
<br><b>perfect tall man figure standing straight up faceing toward us.&nbsp;
He was all</b>
<br><b>black like a shadow.&nbsp; Even though it was raining I knew exactly
what he was</b>
<br><b>and just ran down the stairs and following my cousin across the
street I</b>
<br><b>looked over and the figure was gone.&nbsp; I didn't say anything
right away but</b>
<br><b>all the way to her friend's house we walked in the dark and I could
feel him</b>
<br><b>behind me.&nbsp; And thats when I told her what I saw and what I
was feeling.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>just gave me this crazy look and said she didn't see anything but
she could</b>
<br><b>feel him.&nbsp; When we reached the house light we couln't feel
it anymore.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Ghosts Meeting Place</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: josephinebrancati@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My story is so long, but i'll try to keep it simple. As a young child
i have always known when a person was going to die. These messages always
came to me in my dreams. I would often wake up to tell my mother to call
the famly concerned and see how the family members were. It never failed,
she would be imformed that&nbsp; a certain member of the family had just
died.&nbsp; This was never discussed further by my mother, it became an
accepted occurance, and never discussed with anyone.&nbsp; This sort of
thing i could deal with, except as I got older I stopped telling family
and friends that I had a dream of them, because they seemed to know why.</b>
<br><b>My problems began 18 years ago, when my husband and I bought our
first home. My eldest daughter was one year old and i soon had anouther
on the way. Many times I would see a man standing in the doorway to the
lounge room, but never dare tell any one. Many visitors would often turn
to look in that direction insisting that someone was there, but they never
saw anyone.&nbsp; I still kept things to myself.&nbsp; For many years this
went on, my children, i had three by this time , would often make comments
about the man in the white hat standing in the doorway, but I tried to
down play this because I did not want to frighten them.&nbsp; My husband
by this stage was aware of what I was seeing also.&nbsp; In 1998 we decided
this house was too small and three teenage girls in one bedroom was unbearable.
So we decided to seel the house. Somehow I could not do this, so I stopped
the auction and cancelled the sale.&nbsp; Our last resort was to add an
upper storey extension. This went without&nbsp; a problem. We noticed however
that the man in the white hat had gone. Somehow it was a relief but also
sad. The footsteps stopped, knicknacks stayed put, we even stopped losing
things. I even began falling asleep before the birds began singing.</b>
<br><b>BUT THEN.. I began seeing what I nicknamed the shadow man, I would
watch him wander around the new formal sitting room. I never mentioned
this to my husband or the girls, until my eldest daughter and then youngest
daughter began to tell me what they were seeing and feeling. As we quizzed
each other ( to make sure none of us were imagining this)we were terrified
at what was going on. Then as each new person began to show themselves
we would hesitate to tell each other until it became unbearable.Up until
this point we kept our secret very low key and never really showed our
real fear.Until three weeks ago. I was up with a dear friend of my middle
daughter playing tetris, it was about three thirty in the morning. We were
speaking about his dear mother who had passed away two years earlier. One
of the women I had been seeing in my bedroom every night appeared near
the staircase as plain as day. I could see her from the corner of my eye,
but this time I decided I would turn face on to look at her, knowing she
would disappear. Well, she didn't so in a panic I looked away and then
looked back. She was now walking towards me. I froze and was unable to
speak for a few seconds and then I finally yelled out to the young boy
"did you see that lady" I was convinced he could see her because she was
as plain as day. He did not answer, so I turned to look at him but he was
terrified, so I asked him again. He could not say anything except "please,please
don't talk about this now, wait for the birds to start singing then I can
tell you everything!"Being so terrified and being unable to move we sat
there not speaking until sunrise. He then told me that he had spoken to
my middle child days earlier and told her that he believed our house was
infested with spirits. He could not see them but he felt them. As the day
went on I decided to call in an expert.</b>
<br><b>She was a lovely lady who eased our minds a little and confirmed
three people who were constantly around us. She explained to us that my
eldest daughter, my youngest daughter and myself had very strong psychic
aura's and that the spirit world felt comfortable in our home, and we attracted
them.&nbsp; We were to get used to this because they will be with us where
ever we go. She helped us with our shadow man. He was here because he was
my eldest daughters husband from a previos life. He had followed her for
just over one hundred years because he loved her dearly and she was taken
away from him. They lived in Louisianna ( not sure on that spelling) He
was very reluctant to leave and pleaded with my daughter to stay, although
we had to make him enter the light. This was a very emotional and difficult
thing to go through, but we sadly sad our goodbyes and he left. The other
two were the young boy's mother and grandmother, who were making sure things
were OK for their son in our home ( he spends most of his time with us)</b>
<br><b>Although we are still having problems in dealing with what has happened,
and the presence of many more spirits(sometimes it's like a train station
here) we are trying to understand the full going's on. Our expert friend
sais she would be back to help us understand more about our gift, but she
has not. So now we feel even more terrified. OK, we have a gift, we have
to get used to it, but we need more imformation and explanations to help
ease our fear.</b>
<br><b>My sicerest apologies for this long letter, but I don't know where
else to turn. Also i must add, I have had to log on four times during this
letter because for some reason I am getting disconected, not to mention
I have spent two days trying to get on chat lines dealing with these experiences,
but have had constant problems getting on to any.</b>
<br><b>We truly hope you will read and reply very quickly. We need help
understanding all of this, and there's not too many people we can talk
to.</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I live in a pretty old house.&nbsp; About 20 years
ago a house burned down in</b>
<br><b>the same place my house is in now.&nbsp; They used wood that was
still intact to</b>
<br><b>build the house, along with fresh wood.&nbsp; I think there is an
explination as</b>
<br><b>to why I hear voices, and I think you know too.&nbsp; Let me tell
you of my recent</b>
<br><b>experience.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was on my computer in my room and I had just
logged off the internet.</b>
<br><b>I threw off my shirt and went to bed in my jeans.&nbsp; It was about
3am.&nbsp; A</b>
<br><b>little later as I dozed off, I kept hearing scratches on what seemed
to be on</b>
<br><b>the attic door.&nbsp; I'm not sure as to whether that door was original
or if it</b>
<br><b>was made from the previous house.&nbsp; So anyway, I got pretty
spooked.&nbsp; Finally</b>
<br><b>I grabbed my pocket knife and got out of bed.&nbsp; That's when
I heard the</b>
<br><b>voices.&nbsp; The scratching completely stopped.&nbsp; The house
was deadly silent.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly I heard maybe two toddlers, like maybe 4 or 5, calling
"Mommy."&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>happened over and over again.&nbsp; I thought I was hearing things.&nbsp;
Then they got</b>
<br><b>louder.&nbsp; I covered my ears.&nbsp; I could still hear the pleas
for help.&nbsp; Then I</b>
<br><b>heard crying.&nbsp; It was a woman's crying, and it sounded like
it came from down</b>
<br><b>the hall.&nbsp; Know what I did?&nbsp; I locked the door as fast
as I could and stood</b>
<br><b>up all night, clutching the knife.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's basicly my experience, or recent one.&nbsp;
I sometimes see a little</b>
<br><b>girl with curly blonde hair and a pink dress in my living room.&nbsp;
Sometimes I</b>
<br><b>also hear "Liar" coming from the basement.&nbsp; I don't know what
the hell</b>
<br><b>happened to the house before that, but I don't think I even want
to know.</b>
