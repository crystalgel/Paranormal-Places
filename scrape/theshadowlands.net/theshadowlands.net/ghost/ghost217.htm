<P><B>2 Ghosts in my Home</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: THEWOLFANDME@cs.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, I have two ghosts in my home.&nbsp; At first I thought, like
every one at</B>
<BR><B>first, I was nuts! The first ghost lives on the side of my house,
he is shy,</B>
<BR><B>has white hair and a white beard.&nbsp; He bothers on one.&nbsp;
The second is a bit</B>
<BR><B>more pushy.&nbsp; He is a large man, in a mustard color jacket,
with black hair</B>
<BR><B>cut "beetle" style, no face.&nbsp; He just stands by my bed, and
looks down at me.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Scares the bee geebers out of me.</B>
<BR><B>When I went on vacation, and my dog sitter who lives at my home
when I am</B>
<BR><B>gone, had been there for about a week. I never told her or anyone
about my</B>
<BR><B>ghosts.&nbsp; I called my usual call to see if all was well.&nbsp;
She said, I have to</B>
<BR><B>ask you something that is a bit odd.&nbsp; I said what's up?&nbsp;
She said, do you</B>
<BR><B>have ghosts here?&nbsp; I told her yes, what happened?&nbsp; She
said she was sleeping</B>
<BR><B>in my bed and it was about 2:00am.&nbsp; She felt someone take her
shoulder and</B>
<BR><B>roughly shake her.&nbsp; When she sat up she saw a white flash go
around the</B>
<BR><B>corner out of the bedroom into the living room.&nbsp; She got up
to look around,</B>
<BR><B>of course no one was there.</B>
<BR><B>Last week I went away again for 10 days.&nbsp; She was sleeping
in my bed again.</B>
<BR><B>She said she was sleeping and was woke up by the feeling of someone
sitting</B>
<BR><B>on her chest, she said she felt it was a women, she did not know
why, then</B>
<BR><B>she felt a pillow over her face. then it was gone.&nbsp; My ghosts
do not seem to</B>
<BR><B>bother me, but for some reason they do not like my dog sitter in
my room.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Just Wondering</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: JhonnytSteel16@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Ok I'm 17 year's old and I have lived in the same house all my life.
How ever</B>
<BR><B>through out my entire life I've seen some extremeley unusual thing's,
they</B>
<BR><B>seem to revolve around my sister. the first time I had ever seen
anything</B>
<BR><B>happen in this house was when I was 5 year's old at my sister's
8th birthday</B>
<BR><B>party me her and a few of her freinds were playing a game. Out of
no where</B>
<BR><B>they all dashed into my parent's room (the way the house is set
up is kind of</B>
<BR><B>odd the door to what used to be my parent's room was connected to
my sister's</B>
<BR><B>room) and I was left standing in front of a differant door way than
what they</B>
<BR><B>had used. I turned around and saw a large red figure, of course
I did'nt</B>
<BR><B>stick around long I followed suite and ran into my parent's room
as well, I</B>
<BR><B>remember it dimly glowing as it stood in the hall way it must have
been</B>
<BR><B>roughly 6ft tall perhap's a little larger.That was the first time
I had ever</B>
<BR><B>thought I had seen anything.The second I was 6 year's old and my
freind my</B>
<BR><B>mother and I were here, when I started hearing weeping from a window
in the</B>
<BR><B>corner.The weeping got began to get louder, our pet's began to walk
through</B>
<BR><B>the house as if making sure everything was alright my cat would
hop in all</B>
<BR><B>the windows and hiss every time it neared that particular window
(we had two</B>
<BR><B>dog's and a cat at the time) well it was about 8:00 in the evening
when my</B>
<BR><B>freind had to go home he was a bit scared so I told him I would
shine a flash</B>
<BR><B>light on him until he got to the end of the street, I did but when
he turned</B>
<BR><B>the corner I saw a flash of black run across the street I could'nt
even get a</B>
<BR><B>good look at it it moved soo quickly (there is a street light almost
in front</B>
<BR><B>of my house) the figure ran off into the distance.There has been
many times</B>
<BR><B>through out my live when my sister (who is now 20 and on occassion
still</B>
<BR><B>wakes me up to watch over her at night) has woken me up saying she
has seen a</B>
<BR><B>figure, to be specific there are three.A black one, A green one,
and a red</B>
<BR><B>one. Now the thing about that is we see them differantly, what she
see's as</B>
<BR><B>red I see as green what she see's as black I see as red and what
she see's as</B>
<BR><B>green I see as black.I'm just a tad worried about it becuase my
sister moved</B>
<BR><B>out had a kid and than moved back in and thing's started happening
again.The</B>
<BR><B>two encounter's I spoke of earleir are two out of the three I have
had in</B>
<BR><B>wich my sister was not involved,I was just wondering what you're
opinoin on</B>
<BR><B>all this is, there is alot more to it than what I have written.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Kansas</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gomemego@swbell.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>i used to live in a place called Fredonia , Kansas which is a small
town about 2 hours away from wichita kansas. My family moved into an old
house that was up for rent in town for an extremely low price and soon
we found out why. By the second week we had lived there we knew that there
were ghosts in the house. Things moved , Baby handprints were found all
over tvs in our home ( dust imprints) and once there was a cherub angel
( Crystal ) that flew across the room and hit the wall only breaking off
the head of the angel which was very odd being that crysal shatters at
impact. After all these things occured we confronted our landlord and were
shoved away with no answers. After sharing what had happened many town
people told us to go to the library and look up the adress and see if there
had been any thing of importence that occured at the house. Sure enough
by scanning through old newspaper scrappings we discovered something incredibly
disturbing. There had been an electrical fire in the west wing of the house
in 1921 during its construction and in the fire 2 children had been killed
. I want to add also I felt the scariest part was when we found out that
the oldest child killed a nine yr old boy. Was found dead missing a part
of his head. During the fire the boy supposably&nbsp; went to break the
window open and severed his head. After we linked the story to the angel
that had been decapitated and the scary things in the house happening we
moved. Recently we visited town and the house has yet to be occupied again.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>La llorona</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: achiu@prodigy.net.mx</B><B></B>

<P><B>my expirences have happend to me more than once and most of them
were with an old as mexican legend called "la llorona" my first expirience
was a long ass time ago thistookplace in mexicoasmall town called Chimaltitan
Jalisco i was about nine it was about 5 or 4 years ago it was during christmas

me and a cousin a good friend were playing a game it was like hide and
go seek its a very samall ass town so we were all playing all around the
town I was still young i was a little kid i had heard of La lloronabut
i didnt belive in any of that shit but anywayz we were hideing by the river
wich was off the limits according to the game we were just sittin on some
large rocks I was kindda scared but not cause of some dumn old witch i
was scared of a snake or a scorpion but i had nothing really to worry about
or so i thought. we were planing to go back and go finish the game or go
do something elseit was getting late it was like 11:30 almost midnight
it was on a weekend i think we didnt have to worry about somestranger kidnaping
us because it was a small and peacefull town. then just when we were about
to leave we saw someone in a bright white dress it was clearly visible
but the wierd thing was that person was in the middle of the river and
the river was pretty deet it was as if she&nbsp; was standing on the water
then she started to cry loud ass hell&nbsp; she was crying loud and it
soundes like if someone was beating her she was sayin something but we
couldnt even hear her I was so scared i couldnt move my cousin and friend
started to run and i just stood there than next thing i knew it was as
if she was saying something to me she was looking straight toward me then
i just ran and ran till i got home i told my grandparent they auctually
belived me I was soo scared but my cousins saw her but they ran i saw her
face thats what scared the hell out of me im still trying to forget she
looked like a middle aged woman with a pale face and long messed up hair,
that wasnt the only time i had an expirince with La llorona it was about
three months ago(this took place in my hometown in Aurora Illinois) I was
alone under a bridge graffin my name then i heard someone walk it was some
loud footsteps i thought it was a cop at first so i was ready to ready
to run but I heard someone crying First thing that came to my mind was
La llorona I stayed a while waiting to see if i got to see her but i didnt
I could hear her clearly she was crying loudly and i could hear her say
" &iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;mis hijos mis hijos!!"&nbsp; wich means my kids
my kids in eanglish I thought it was one of my boy painting on the other
side of the train tracks but then i realized i was compleatly alone I ignored
her and finished my peace then i just left I saw a lot of people who live
near the tracks come out of their homes and an old lady friend of my ants
asked what was that i said i was downthere alone then the crying disappered
and i just left and went home. those were my expirinces with La llorona
people say if you go by a river or a bridge sometimes at night you can
hear her.</B>

<BR><B>Lake House Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SummerAngel0402@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>~~~The Past~~~</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My story all starts about in 1934....This couple
lives in this nice 2</B>
<BR><B>story house on the lake.&nbsp; They have a little boat house that
they love to</B>
<BR><B>invite their friends children over to swim.&nbsp; They loved kids.&nbsp;
The couple</B>
<BR><B>tries for years and years to have children of their own but never
seem to</B>
<BR><B>achieve their goal.&nbsp; Well.. one summer night, the wife couldnt
take it no</B>
<BR><B>more and she walks off the end of the boat house.&nbsp; She tied
a big rock and a</B>
<BR><B>rope together to hold her down.&nbsp; The next day her husband finds
her and he is</B>
<BR><B>crushed by his lose.&nbsp; He goes throught the funeral like an
average day thing.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Well, about 4 or 5 years later, he cant take the pain and
lonesomness and he</B>
<BR><B>burns his beautiful house down to the ground while he is still inside.</B>
<BR><B>~~~The Present~~~Summer of 1999</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 3 or 4 days before the 4th of July at the
same spot where the house</B>
<BR><B>burned down.&nbsp; Time has taken its tole on the land and it has
growed over and</B>
<BR><B>new houses rest apon the land.&nbsp; I along with another girl and
2 other guys</B>
<BR><B>are spending the week up at this lake in this boat house.&nbsp;
It is about 2 or 3</B>
<BR><B>in the morning and we are all about to fall asleep.&nbsp; All of
a sudden the beds</B>
<BR><B>begin to shake.&nbsp; And none of us are making this happen.&nbsp;
So we all decide to</B>
<BR><B>push the 2 beds together and see if the shaking stops.&nbsp; It
does for about 20</B>
<BR><B>or 30 mintes and we begin to fall asleep again.&nbsp; The beds beging
to shake</B>
<BR><B>again and we all jump into one bed and all hide under the covers
together and</B>
<BR><B>huddle.&nbsp; So we are all holding on to one another and I ask
someone to look</B>
<BR><B>above the covers and see if anyone sees anything.&nbsp; Just that
same day we</B>
<BR><B>heard the story about the couple that lived in the house that burned
and</B>
<BR><B>about the wife that had drowned herself.&nbsp; Well anyway, I decide
to be the</B>
<BR><B>brave one and look above the covers. I look and see nothing for
a bit.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>continue to look around and all of a sudden i see a light out of
the coner of</B>
<BR><B>my eye.&nbsp; It is a brit white light standing in the window.&nbsp;
I ask someone to</B>
<BR><B>look above the covers and see if they see it and all 3 say no way.&nbsp;
I cant</B>
<BR><B>seem to get my eyes off the light when all of a sudden it dissapears.&nbsp;
I get</B>
<BR><B>my focus back and i return to my group under the covers.&nbsp; I
once again ask</B>
<BR><B>someone to look and see if there is anything in the boat house.&nbsp;
Once again</B>
<BR><B>everyone is to scared.&nbsp; And once again I look above the covers.&nbsp;
This is the</B>
<BR><B>freaky part.&nbsp; We had locked all the doors...there are 2 rooms
in the boat</B>
<BR><B>house and 2 doors leading to outside...we had locked all the doors
and the</B>
<BR><B>one shutter door the joined the 2 rooms together....&nbsp; When
i had looked above</B>
<BR><B>the covers...the shutter door and the door that was in the other
room the</B>
<BR><B>lead to outside was OPEN!!&nbsp; When i looked at the shutter door
open i</B>
<BR><B>screamed...one of the guys looked above the covers...said "OH SH**"&nbsp;
and ran</B>
<BR><B>out the other door and up the hill to the trailor...us others followed...</B>
<BR><B>You know what we saw??&nbsp; A black figure with the head of a demon
and the body</B>
<BR><B>of a strong man.&nbsp; We havent seen it since... If you ask me...i
think that it</B>
<BR><B>is the man looking for his wife that drowned herself...And i have
seen</B>
<BR><B>pictures of the couple...i am a decendent of this couple...and i
seem to look</B>
<BR><B>almost exactly like the wife...who drowned herself...</B>

<P><B>Lost Child - Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lildunbuggy@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This just happened the night before last.&nbsp; For the</B>
<BR><B>past three days, my husband, my two little girls</B>
<BR><B>(preschool age), my Mother-in-Law and I had been</B>
<BR><B>camping at Beachside Campgrounds in Oregon.&nbsp; A</B>
<BR><B>beautiful place caught between HWY 101 and the beach</B>
<BR><B>itself, just north of Yachets (pronounced 'Ya-hauts'</B>
<BR><B>for the curious).</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, that night was our last night there and</B>
<BR><B>somewhere in the middle of sleeping my youngest</B>
<BR><B>daughter woke up crying saying that she was scared.</B>
<BR><B>Not overly unusual for a preschooler, but after I</B>
<BR><B>tucked her back in she dropped right back into a deep</B>
<BR><B>sleep which for her is very unusual.&nbsp; She usually</B>
<BR><B>likes to snuggle and talk and generally keep me up as</B>
<BR><B>long as she can.</B>
<BR><B>As I was trying to get back to sleep myself I heard</B>
<BR><B>what I thought was my older daughter saying,"Mommy,</B>
<BR><B>mommy."&nbsp; I answered her but had no response.&nbsp; I heard</B>
<BR><B>the voice again, this time more insistent, "MOMMY,</B>
<BR><B>MOMMY!", though always at kind of a whisper.&nbsp; I got up</B>
<BR><B>and physically looked at my two girls who were</B>
<BR><B>completely sound asleep, the kind of sleep that is</B>
<BR><B>past dreaming.&nbsp; Which was very odd because, you</B>
<BR><B>remember, my youngest one had just woken up a short</B>
<BR><B>while before.</B>
<BR><B>Then as I laid down for a second time I heard the</B>
<BR><B>voice again only it seemed to come from all around me</B>
<BR><B>and in a constant stream, "mommymommymommymommymommy,"</B>
<BR><B>and it wouldn't stop, it just kind of kept</B>
<BR><B>reverberating around my head and seemed to have no</B>
<BR><B>specific point of origin.&nbsp; My husband got up (not</B>
<BR><B>hearing a thing, mind you) to 'relieve' himself and</B>
<BR><B>came back a few moments.&nbsp; While he was gone I said out</B>
<BR><B>loud,"Whoever you are go away, we're trying to sleep!"</B>
<BR><B>and the voice kind of faded away but always saying</B>
<BR><B>"Mommy, mommy."&nbsp; I asked my husband if he'd heard or</B>
<BR><B>seen anything outside the tent when he was out there,</B>
<BR><B>but he said he hadn't.&nbsp; This gave me the creeps in a</B>
<BR><B>SERIOUS way.</B>
<BR><B>The voice didn't come back and we were leaving the</B>
<BR><B>next morning anyway (that was yesterday).&nbsp; I told</B>
<BR><B>everyone about the voice the next morning and they</B>
<BR><B>looked at me as if I had lobsters crawling out of my</B>
<BR><B>ears.&nbsp; But I still wonder if something happened at the</B>
<BR><B>campsite.&nbsp; I feel it was a small child who'd gotten</B>
<BR><B>lost and never found it's way back to it's tent and I</B>
<BR><B>feel it was a small boy, but I know nothing for</B>
<BR><B>certain.&nbsp; If anybody knows about any 'ghostly'</B>
<BR><B>happenings at the Beachside Campgrounds in Oregon</B>
<BR><B>State, I'd surely like to hear back from you.</B>

<P><B>Meeting My Great-Great Grandfather</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mscoldtoz@earthlink.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Blessed Be</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not sure where to start, so here goes. I
am able to feel the energy around me. I have always feel weird things.
But the last 10 years of my life my abilities have increased. I was standing
in the garage in the daytime, getting ready to leave for work. Out of the
corner of my eye, I saw a man in a black and white suit. He was very tall,
about&nbsp; 6'2 his clothes were old fashioned. He reminded me of an old
western mortician. His hat was a broad band black hat. I blinked my eyes
to see if he would go away. He just stood there. He reminded me of death.
His form was solid, but yet not really. He was not transparent like the
others I have seen. I put my purse in the car and when I looked back he
was gone. I didn't get too close to him. When I went to my Tai Chi class,
I asked my Sifu about him. He asked "did I ask him what he wanted?" I said
no because I thought he was death, I was not about to invite death into
my house. A few months went by, and I was in the kitchen doing the dishes
when a shadow went by the window, I thought I was Ted from next door (he
is tall) I thought I would greet him at the front door, well there was
no one there. So I say out loud "very funny spirits" the next day, I was
in the garage going to work, again the man in the drive way. This time
I was sort of brave, and stepped closer, I could not feel anything from
him except a low vibration, on the cool side. It was weird, so I said,
"How can I help you?" He just tipped his hat and disappeared. When I went
home for vactaion (I am from Indiana) my sister and I were going through
my Aunts pictures since her death, she was 85. When I came across this
picture all the hair on my neck stood up and I got the willies, I said
"Oh my god, this is the man in my drive way!" My sister looked at me and
said "OH that is your Great Great Grandfather McNeely, he was a Quaker
and he shoed horses. Since I have found out who he is, he has never came
back. I was wondering, since he was solid (so to speak) could he have been
out of place in time, more than appearing as a ghost?</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for letting me share this story, my friend think I am weird.
I see and sense stuff there is no way you can convince people of what you
see, I don't even try anymore. When I see the ghosts in the casnio, I just
smile and keep on walking. I am from Las Vegas Nv.</B>
<BR><B>You may publish this letter, maybe it will help someone else, not
to think they are crazy.</B>
<BR><B>Blessed be</B>

<P><B>Michelle</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: princess_leia@iprimus.com.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>This house we lived in for about 6-8 months. Nothing ever happened
here though. It was a week before we were due to move into our new house
out in the country. It was a warm Monday, my sister came down to visit
with her son John. Her husband went to the new house along with my brother
and dad to help paint. Anyhow.. while we were having lunch, my sister and
I got talking about haunted houses for some reason. I knew of a house that
was supposedly haunted in Craigieburn. It sat alone, isolated. Anyhow...
my other sister Irene took me there when I was around 15 years old. Many
people knew about this house. It is a large single story house, and it
is quite old. People say that the electricity isn't linked up or connected
or something like that, yet people have seen light on in the house, yet
no body has lived in it as far as anyone knows. When Irene first took me
to this house, I remembered it looking quite scary. The gate was slightly
open, yet there was a sign that read "Trespassers will be prosecuted".
Anyhow.. I will continue to the say Sue came down. I was telling her about
this house. She started to get all excited and wanted me to take her to
this place. After considering the idea, I said "Okay".</B>
<BR><B>It took around 15 minutes to get there. I wasn't quite sure where
the place was, but I kinda knew and we found it quite easily. It sits alone
on top of the hill and the only way to see the house is when you are up
the hill. My sister parked the car and we sat there looking at the house.
It has become over grown with weeds, grass and more. It was basically impossible
to see the house, apart from the upper half. It's obvious no one'd lived
there for a long time. The nearest neighbour is all the way down the road.
We sat there for a few minutes. My sister said "I wonder if it is really
haunted. It doesn't "LOOK" haunted. I told her that looks can be deceiving
and not be too quick to judge.</B>
<BR><B>We noticed there there were lots of flies...but we were near the
edge of the counrty, paddocks etc. But there were quite a lot. We got out
of the car and I had brought my camera. I took a few snapshots. My sister
repeated again "I don't think it's haunted". I think she was scared and
was trying to convince herself. Anyhow... too many flies were bothering
us so we got back into the car. We stared at the house. I felt weird though.
I remember hearing a dog barking, and that was a little strange.</B>
<BR><B>My sister and I continued to argue whether the place was haunted
or not when all of a sudden, the glass in my sister's glasses popped out
and landed in her lap. I didn't quite see it happen, it happened too quick
but it took me a couple of seconds to see that there was no glass in my
sister's sunnies. They were on her lap. This is the first time this has
happened and she had those glasses for well over a year. Was the ghost
trying to convince my sister that there was indeed a ghost or more living
there? That is when I started having bad feelings. Like it was a big mistake
coming here. It took me a while to put the glasses back into the frame.
The weird thing was, not one but TWO of the glasses fell out. Spooky. My
sister and I decided it was a good idea to leave soon so she did a U-turn.</B>
<BR><B>We pulled up at the gate. I noticed that the gate stood a little
open like it did all those years ago. Perhaps willing unsuspecting passerbyers
to wander in? That same sign was still there as well "Trespassers will
be Prosecuted" My sister asked if one of us should go and knock on the
door. I said "NO WAY!!! What if that door slammed shut?" We decided to
leave. Anyhow, we stopped for some ice cream and went to the park in Craigieburn,
and that bad feeling was still with me. By the time we got home, I was
feeling quite nausious. I couldn't shake that bad feeling. I can't put
my finger on it "WHAT EXACTLY" but that feeling on being unwell was with
me. But worst things were to come.....</B>
<BR><B>I thought I had seen the last of the weird stuff, but it had only
started. Remember, we went to the house on Monday. When we came back, I
was quite ill. It was like a nausia unwellness. At the same time, I wondered
whether it was because "something had came back with us?" You see... I
can usually sense spirits. Well... in a way. I get this bad feeling and
it feels as though you are being watched. Ever since I was a baby, it appears
I can commincate.. (not so much anymore) but I will tell you about that
at some other time. :) Now, back to this story...</B>
<BR><B>This happened to me on a Wednesday night. Everyone had gone to bed.
I was up late reading, it was a usual thing for me. I love novels you see.
:) I don't recall what I had been reading but anyway, it was close to midnight.
I wasn't really feeling sleeping but I thought that it was a good idea
to go to sleep. I went to use the bathroom and brushed my teeth and all.
After I was done, I switched the bathroom light off and paused looking
into the kitchen. The toilet is connected to the bathroom and laundry so
the toilet had two doors. Anyway, toward my right was my parents room.
Down the hall straight ahead is my room to the right, the lounge room to
the left, my brother's room next to mine, also on the right, and the front
door straight ahead. To the left, is another short hallway, the kitchen
and dining room dead ahead and the laundry to the left of that small hallway
(that connects to the toilet). Anyhow... I suddenly had this very weird
feeling. It made me feel quite uncomfortable. I didn't see anything and
wasn't expecting to see anything.</B>
<BR><B>Anyhow, while I was standing there for probably only a moment, 15
seconds max, something told me to get back to my room. So I walked at a
fast pace down the hall. It really felt like something was a step behind
me. I arrived at my door and dashed inside. The bedroom door is a sliding
door. Now, what I was about to see sent shivers up my spine. As I was closing
the door, "something" moved swiftly past my bedroom door. I actually 'saw
it' I paused for a moment thinking "Who the HELL was THAT???" Was it my
brother?? Nope, it wasn't him. He had his bedroom door closed. And I would
have heard him. I also noticed that there was no sound by the figure that
moved past my bedroom door. It appeared to move so smoothly as though it
had floated by my bedroom door.</B>
<BR><B>I was so curious. I had the urge to check it out, but something
inside me told me not to. I decided to leave it. At this point, it didn't
occur to me that "something" followed us back from that house. But I did
find the experience quite weird and very strange. That 'thing' that went
past my door was a full person's height. Now to describe what it looked
like. Well, it was kinda off green/grey in color. Kinda like a glow-in-the-dark
color. Anyhow, that night, I didn't sleep too well.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning, while I was having breakfast, I was telling mum
that something really weird had happened last night. I told her what I
saw. After I told he my experience, she told me hers. This is her story....</B>
<BR><B>On Tuesday night (the night before my experience) she was in the
lounge room watching ALL TOGETHER NOW when from the corner of her eye,
she noticed something whitish in color hovering on top of my brother's
bed where the chandelear is. She ignored it but it seemed to still be there,
so she looked over to his room, it disappeared. Nothing was there. She
looked back at the TV and nothing flickered so she continued watching the
TV when about a minute or 2 later, the same thing happened. Mum knew there
was something obviously there because she saw it so well from the corner
of her eye. She glanced over once again, it disappeared. Mum was thinking
"What in the world is that?" It had never ever happened before. She was
starting to get annoyed. Anyhow, mum described it to look like someone
wearing a long white flowing nightgown or something. About 5 minutes later
( on ground level this time) again from the corner of her eye, mum saw
a girl in the white gown walk from the dark toward the door. Thinking it
was me, she looked over and was about to ask what am I doing in my brothers
room, but when she looked, no one was there. It didn't happen anymore that
night.</B>
<BR><B>So when I heard mum explaining that story, I was starting to put
the pieces together. Mum then gave me a lecture about how we shouldn't
have gone to that house in the first place. Well... that's true, but who
would have thought 'it' would follow us back home.</B>
<BR><B>Anyhow.. nothing much happened in that week before we moved out,
apart from the bad unexplained odour in the hallway between my room and
my parents room. It smelt like someone let one go, only worse. Worse than
rotten egg and cabbages. Oh course we all admitted that we could smell
it, but we all swore it wasn't anyone of us that caused it (know what I
mean).</B>
<BR><B>Anyhow, something else did happen in that house that neither mum
nor I knew about. It happened to my brother. But we did not learn this
until several months later while living in Wallan. This is how we found
out about his experience and how he found out about ours.</B>
<BR><B>One night, in Wallan, we were watching a ghost documentary. It was
quite interesting. It was a 2 hour special of real life ghostly accounts.
Anyhow... after the documentary ended, my brother shocked us by saying
"You know, just before we moved out, I think I saw a ghost". Mum and I
looked at my brother. He then told us his story.</B>
<BR><B>He told us that when he came back from fishing in the afternoon,
sometime around 3:00pm or 4:00pm, he saw a heavy looking woman from the
corner of his eye standing by his white wardrobe. He said that she seemed
to be wearing a dark servant dress, cap and was quite plump in build. He
noticed the dark contrast between the figure and the white wardrobe. That
is why it caught his eye in the first place. She moved and that's when
my brother glanced over and then saw nothing, she was gone. My brother
didn't think much of it at the time because he thought he was tired and
his eyes were playing tricks on him, even though he knew deep down he did
see something. But he didn't wanna say anything to anyone because he didn't
exactly know what he saw anyhow.</B>
<BR><B>When my brother told us what had happened (in the period a week
before we moved - around same week mum and I saw something) and learnt
of our encounter, he was quite shocked as well. We started talking about
what had happened to us when I remembered the camera I took the film with.
The film was still in the camera because I had some snaps left. As soon
as I brought the camera out of my room, dad told me to get rid of the camera.
He said he didn't wanna have any ghosts coming to our new house. I mean,
the spiritual/paranormal world is unknown and we didn't wanna risk having
the ghost find us or something. But I am not sure if it was my imagination
or not, but as soon as dad told me to get rid of the camera, the camera
in my hand felt warmer. It didn't burn, it just felt weird so the next
morning, I dropped it into a dumpster. I was afraid that perhaps the camera
captured a ghost or something. I really don't wanna go messing with this
kinda stuff. I've had my fair share of experiences and frankly, I've had
enough.</B>
<BR><B>There are so many other experiences but I will tell them later.
:) Hope you enjoyed the story. It is a little long though, but I wanted
to write it in as much detail as I can remember.</B>
<BR><B>I wonder if there were two ghosts or one ghosts. Because my brother
said the one he saw was plump (over weight in appearance) wearing a dark
servant outfit, hair in bun, possibly wearing a servant cap, but the one
mum saw seemed to wear a long loose white gown. I can't even begin to describe
what the ghost I saw was wearing. It was dark, it looked semi glow in the
dark, and it moved past my door so swiftly, but when I saw it, I looked
directly at it, and saw it, I didn't see if from the corner of my eye like
mum and my brother did. But the three of us did see something.</B>
<BR><B>The strange thing is... a couple of weeks AFTER we watched that
ghost documentary and I got rid of my camera, my dad and I drove past that
house, and it was empty. We were told that the landlord's son was moving
in two weeks after we moved out, yet.. this was easily 4 months later,
the place was still empty. Our landlord lived next door!! Either they weren't
ready to move in, or they did...but moved out in a hurry. It is all very
spooky. I wonder whether anyone is living in that house today. But I ain't
gonna go back to have a look, incase it follows us again.</B>

<P><B>Moms House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Jugalette18750@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I sent in an entree before but this is one of my favorite ghosts.
so I feel</B>
<BR><B>that I need to share this story, Its a little bit long so feel free
to break</B>
<BR><B>it up into pieces or chapters or whatever :)</B>
<BR><B>Well I'll start with meeting the house. My mom had been looking
for a house</B>
<BR><B>to buy for a while, and she was just not having any luck at all,
No one would</B>
<BR><B>finance her or anything like that, so when she did get this house,
it was</B>
<BR><B>like a miracle. Well of course she was very excited and wanted to
show her</B>
<BR><B>new house to everyone and I was one of the first people that she
invited.</B>
<BR><B>I'll just come out and say it, the house was creepy from the minute
that I</B>
<BR><B>walked in the house, I KNEW that someone had died there.</B>
<BR><B>There was pictures hung on the wall, there was dirty dishes in the
sink, all</B>
<BR><B>the furniture and the possesions of the former owner were still
there. There</B>
<BR><B>was even dirty laundry left on the floor, now this was all covered
by a nice</B>
<BR><B>thick coat of dust and spider webs, so the house was left just the
way that</B>
<BR><B>it was before the person had died. BASICALLY they came and took
his body out</B>
<BR><B>of the house, buried it and never went back. Which I think it really
sad</B>
<BR><B>because he had a daughter that he left the house to.</B>
<BR><B>(she is a *#($)% if you know what I mean!) Well My mom was showing
me around</B>
<BR><B>the house and the basement and I just kinda looked around and finally
I</B>
<BR><B>couldnt hold it anymore (I have a really big mouth and am very outspoken)
and</B>
<BR><B>I just blurted out, MOM I think someone died here!</B>
<BR><B>She just gave me a dirty look and told me that it was nonsense and
to knock</B>
<BR><B>it off. I just kept telling her, yeah I really like it, but I think
someone</B>
<BR><B>died in here (you can just kinda feel it when you walk in the door)
well</B>
<BR><B>after prodding her about it for about a week she finally admitted
to me that</B>
<BR><B>the old man that had formally lived there had died in his sleep,
in her</B>
<BR><B>bedroom. Well, that was enough to satistfy me and I shut up about
it. I just</B>
<BR><B>wanted her to admitt it.</B>
<BR><B>Well the house was in need of some repairs and so on, so they remodelled
it,</B>
<BR><B>Now I wont give you a whole discription of the setup of the house,
because I</B>
<BR><B>know that no matter how well I explain it, you wont see it the way
It really</B>
<BR><B>is, (not to be rude in anyway) WELL, They put a new floor in, they
tore down</B>
<BR><B>a wall between the livingroom and the kitchen where the stairs to
go into the</B>
<BR><B>basement are (remember this, its pretty important.) They tore down
a wall in</B>
<BR><B>my moms room (it used to be two rooms, but they tore the wall down
and made</B>
<BR><B>it one big room) Now the basement they totally redid, they added
walls, they</B>
<BR><B>added an extra room, they added everything, once upon a time it
was just a</B>
<BR><B>BIG room, now its several rooms.</B>
<BR><B>alright enough of that. My mom has lived there a while now and a
few months</B>
<BR><B>ago she and her husband were going on vacation for the weekend.
she called</B>
<BR><B>and asked me if I would stay at her house and babysit my little
brother and</B>
<BR><B>her dogs (toy poodles they are soo dainty its really annoying) and
I could</B>
<BR><B>have my boyfriend over seeing how it was our sometime-not really
sure of the</B>
<BR><B>actual date aniversary, so I agreed and invited him over for the
weekend.</B>
<BR><B>It was a lot of fun, my little brother left alot and we had bar-b-ques</B>
<BR><B>everynight on my moms back pourch and all that. Well the second
night it was</B>
<BR><B>time to go to sleep and me and him retired into my moms room since
she has a</B>
<BR><B>really nice large antique eithan allen bed. We were in there MAYBE
5 minutes</B>
<BR><B>when my boyfriend told me that he had a strong sense that we SHOULDNT
be in</B>
<BR><B>there. I didnt argue and we ended up sleeping downstairs that night.</B>
<BR><B>Well this is where I became I true believer.</B>
<BR><B>I had been spending the weekend at my moms house, because I was
moving out of</B>
<BR><B>my apartment, and I was sleeping in the basement, the first night
I heard</B>
<BR><B>someone walking around, but thought nothing of it because I just
thought that</B>
<BR><B>it was my little brother (he had a friend over and they were still
up)&nbsp; the</B>
<BR><B>second night was when all the action took place. I have two brothers,
one</B>
<BR><B>that is NEVER home, so he was gone, and the other one had gone to
sleep very</B>
<BR><B>early. Well I was the only one in the basement and my moms little
poodle was</B>
<BR><B>sleeping downstairs on the pull out bed with me. Then I heard it,
I heard</B>
<BR><B>someone walking around above me in the kitchen.</B>
<BR><B>I thought that it was just my little brother getting up to get something
to</B>
<BR><B>drink or eat and I blew it off. Well the thing walked around for
a while and</B>
<BR><B>settled into the living room for a while, then it walked into the
kitchen and</B>
<BR><B>then through the kitchen where the stairs are and began to walk
down the</B>
<BR><B>stairs, I thought that it was Rick (my stepdad) so I turned to look.
There</B>
<BR><B>was no one there.</B>
<BR><B>Hmm, I didnt hear anyone go back up.</B>
<BR><B>I started watching TV again,&nbsp; the dog napping next to me.</B>
<BR><B>Then I heard it again, only this time, I followed where it was coming
from,</B>
<BR><B>my moms room to the bathroom, to the kitchen for a minute then into
the</B>
<BR><B>living room for a while, and then into the kitchen and down the
stairs where</B>
<BR><B>is stopped at the bottom step and just stood there.</B>
<BR><B>I felt like there was someone there, so I turned to look,&nbsp;
once again there</B>
<BR><B>was nothing. The dog wasnt scared, he just kinda looked at the stairway
like</B>
<BR><B>nothing was out of the ordinary and laid his head down again.</B>
<BR><B>This time I was convinced that I was losing it, but I heard it again,
my moms</B>
<BR><B>room, the bathroom the kitchen livingroom and then back through
the kitchen</B>
<BR><B>to the stairs.</B>

<BR><B>My Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: hollyfreeze@tri-countyelectric.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>well i can say that my family has had a few experiences. the earliest
one was when my parents were first married. the previous owner had a club
foot and drug it so that it mad a step clump noise.&nbsp; several nights
my parents heard step clumps down the stairs which scared the dogs. in
another house things would fall but nothing would be out of place or things
would be moved around. in another house, my sister and i both saw an owl
outside our room. i know what your thingking an owl? what's so scary about
that. well it was floating not flying and it's eye were glowing red. those
eyes followed us to the next house where we would see them over our beds
at night and there were also a set of glowing blue eyes. and neither one
of us would go into the basement alone or when the light was out. it was
always very cold and we would hear moaning and animal noises. in this house
the doors open and close by themselves and i see shadows where there are
no people. in my friend's house there is still a ghost that plays with
the light changes the radio and cds and flushes the toilet and stirs up
her birds. anyway post it if you like and email me at roxannavader@aol.com</B><B></B>

<BR><B>"Geja"</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:blisfulbeauty@home.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;I have always been a firm believer in ghosts and the supernatural</B>
<BR><B>world.&nbsp; My mother told me an experience she had and I'd like
to pass it</B>
<BR><B>on to you.&nbsp; In the winter of 1982 my mother was pregnant with
her second</B>
<BR><B>child who was due in Spring of '83.&nbsp; One night she fell asleep
early and</B>
<BR><B>had a dream.&nbsp; She dreamt that she was standing in the foyer
of our house</B>
<BR><B>and my great grandfather, Geja (It's Ukranian for grandfather, i'm
not</B>
<BR><B>sure on the spelling), who died when my mom was in junior high,
was</B>
<BR><B>standing in front of her.&nbsp; He was wearing a grey hawaiian shirt
which</B>
<BR><B>was very unlike himself. In the dream he said "Your baby girl.&nbsp;
She will</B>
<BR><B>be born with a problem, but don't worry, the doctors can fix it."&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>mother woke up and was worried and curious, because she wasn't sure
if</B>
<BR><B>the baby was a girl or boy yet.&nbsp; She wanted to be surprised.
The doctor</B>
<BR><B>confirmed that the child was and girl and that everything looked
fine.</B>
<BR><B>My mother assumed that the dream was nothing important, but an</B>
<BR><B>overactive imagination... Then in May of 1983 her baby girl was
born.</B>
<BR><B>The doctors came to her later and said that I, the baby girl, had
a</B>
<BR><B>hernia that they could operate on when I got a little older.&nbsp;
It kind of</B>
<BR><B>makes you wonder if dreams can tell you something and if they are</B>
<BR><B>connected to the other world. Thanks for letting me share that with
you.</B>

<BR><B>My story in Mexico</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: erikikis99@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I want to tell you about the experience I had. I live</B>
<BR><B>in Mexico. One night, I was making some handcrafts for</B>
<BR><B>my baby's baptism party, since I had to make 100 of</B>
<BR><B>them, I had to work until 1 in the morning in the</B>
<BR><B>livingroom. It was 12:30, and I was very concentrated</B>
<BR><B>on my bussiness. Suddenly I began to feel a stange</B>
<BR><B>anxiety, nervousness. My husband's parents passed away</B>
<BR><B>a few years ago, and we have the picture of her mom in</B>
<BR><B>our livingroom. I kept on my work, but then I heard</B>
<BR><B>like a "breath", like if someone were next to me. I</B>
<BR><B>tried not to pay attention to that and thought maybe</B>
<BR><B>was the wind of an opened window. I checked every</B>
<BR><B>window and all of them were perfectly locked. I sat in</B>
<BR><B>my chair again a started to make my crafts, minutes</B>
<BR><B>later, I felt and heard the same thing, the same</B>
<BR><B>breath, but I tried not to panic.I turned slowly and</B>
<BR><B>tried to find out where that sound came from. I</B>
<BR><B>followed it and unbelieveble, it came from the</B>
<BR><B>picture!</B>
<BR><B>In that moment, I tried to clear my mind and convince</B>
<BR><B>myself that couldn't happen, but at the same time I</B>
<BR><B>knew that if it was my mother-in-law, she loved me in</B>
<BR><B>the past and she couldn't do any harm to me. But any</B>
<BR><B>way,I did not want to find out and I ran upstairs and</B>
<BR><B>went to bed.My husband was already sleeping. I woke</B>
<BR><B>him up and told him the story, and he said that ,maybe</B>
<BR><B>her mom came to visit us.</B>

<P><B>My Story of Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By Billie Robertson</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was just searching the web and came across this site.&nbsp; I cannot
tell you</B>
<BR><B>how happy hearing other stories makes me.&nbsp; For years i thought
that i was</B>
<BR><B>crazy.</B>
<BR><B>My story begins when i was 13 years old.&nbsp; My aunt had just
purchased an old</B>
<BR><B>Orchard house, that was dated to be at least 100 years old at the
time.&nbsp; This</B>
<BR><B>old house years ago was considered the mansion of the area.&nbsp;
The house itself</B>
<BR><B>was a two story with attic and basement.&nbsp; It was originally
built by a man</B>
<BR><B>who owned a huge orchard and employed many people.&nbsp; Well, time
was not good</B>
<BR><B>to the house and it had changed hands many many times during the
years.&nbsp; It</B>
<BR><B>was basically falling down and my aunt restored it to its old glory.&nbsp;
This</B>
<BR><B>house was about 1 mile up the road from where i was currently living
and we</B>
<BR><B>were getting ready to move into it and rent it off of my aunt.&nbsp;
I loved this</B>
<BR><B>house!&nbsp; My mother had one room, my sister and brother one room,
and i got the</B>
<BR><B>biggest bedroom.&nbsp; The staircase was very unusual in the fact
that it came</B>
<BR><B>straight up and then branched off into two different landings with
about 4</B>
<BR><B>steps each.&nbsp; One of those landings lead into my bathroom the
other into the</B>
<BR><B>main hallway.&nbsp; I feel it is important to give you all this
information</B>
<BR><B>because it is relevant later in my story.</B>
<BR><B>To skip a few months, we moved in everything was wonderful.&nbsp;
Then i started</B>
<BR><B>feeling uneasy about the house.&nbsp; The feeling was always there
with me but it</B>
<BR><B>started to get worse i guess.&nbsp; I felt an uneasiness, it really
increased when</B>
<BR><B>i was alone and i felt panic everytime that i would go up the stairs.&nbsp;
This</B>
<BR><B>feeling kept getting worse with the months that passed.&nbsp; No
one else felt</B>
<BR><B>this panic or fear.&nbsp; I was the type that loved the dark, we
lived in the</B>
<BR><B>country and i felt nothing of walking this mile from my aunts house
to my new</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; I had no fear of anything unnatural, I was not one
to spook easily.</B>
<BR><B>I went from this extreme to actually fleeing this house on occasion.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>remember when i would be alone in this house that i would go to
the main</B>
<BR><B>living room and back myself up into a corner because i felt evil.&nbsp;
I could</B>
<BR><B>feel something evil in this house.&nbsp; I was so paranoid of the
steps that i</B>
<BR><B>would lock the door to my bathroom which led into my bedroom.&nbsp;
I would lay in</B>
<BR><B>bed and hear someone actually coming up the stairs (this was the
only thing</B>
<BR><B>the others heard that they agreed with) and no one would be there.&nbsp;
Then the</B>
<BR><B>breathing started.&nbsp; I would lay in bed at night and hear a
person breathing.</B>
<BR><B>It would get louder like they were right beside of me and then get
more</B>
<BR><B>faint.&nbsp; I remember laying awake in bed terrified.&nbsp; I would
leave the light on</B>
<BR><B>and pray to god many a night.&nbsp; Everyone could see a change
in me, i was not</B>
<BR><B>happy anymore.&nbsp; I was withdrawn.&nbsp; I thought i was going
crazy, then i started</B>
<BR><B>to hallucinate. Now that i am older and wiser i don't think it was
a</B>
<BR><B>hallucination at all i think that it was really spirits that i was
seeing.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>started seeing a old man in overalls with a long white beard standing
at the</B>
<BR><B>top of the stairs always in the same place.&nbsp; He would not move
at all,&nbsp; i did</B>
<BR><B>not see him often but he was as real as i was.&nbsp; I would look
over and see him</B>
<BR><B>and then he would be gone. I did not really feel fear when i saw
him, just</B>
<BR><B>shock and surprise, he did not seem evil to me. That led me to start
locking</B>
<BR><B>my other bedroom door.&nbsp; I felt if i could barricade myself
it would stop.</B>
<BR><B>My mind had totally taken a turn to where i was suicidal, i was
dark, i was</B>
<BR><B>withdrawn, how could i go and act like everything was ok when i
was going</B>
<BR><B>crazy.&nbsp; I started to drink.&nbsp; Then i started seeing a different
man crawling</B>
<BR><B>up the stairs.&nbsp; I assure you this is not a fabrication.&nbsp;
I do not think about</B>
<BR><B>this often and have tears in my eyes right now revisiting this horror.&nbsp;
He</B>
<BR><B>was bloody, bald, and would always crawl up the stairs, never fast,
nice and</B>
<BR><B>slow.&nbsp; I of course would flip out and flee the house.&nbsp;
He would never reach</B>
<BR><B>the top, always stayed down in the middle of the main staircase.&nbsp;
I would</B>
<BR><B>always lock my bathroom door for this very reason.&nbsp; ONe day
i forgot and was</B>
<BR><B>doing my hair and looked up and there he was right infront of me,
he had</B>
<BR><B>reached the top.&nbsp; I bet i sure looked crazy because i jumped
up stool hitting</B>
<BR><B>the floor and was backed up into the wall of the bathroom when my
mother came</B>
<BR><B>up the stairs and seen me fall apart.&nbsp; That is when i went
to the shrink for</B>
<BR><B>the first time.&nbsp; By this time i was drinking very heavily.&nbsp;
I know this was</B>
<BR><B>not the cause.&nbsp; I could not go to sleep unless i was blasted
out of my mind,</B>
<BR><B>for the breathing would keep me awake terrified.&nbsp; I ended up
being 17 and</B>
<BR><B>putting myself in rehab for addiction to nerve pills and alcohol
and for</B>
<BR><B>feeling suicidal.&nbsp; I came back home and never seen a figure
again, but still</B>
<BR><B>heard the breathing and felt the evil.&nbsp; The next year i moved
out and became</B>
<BR><B>the happy person i once was.&nbsp; My sister 14 at the time moved
into my old room</B>
<BR><B>and started going crazy like i did.&nbsp; She had never had any
of these feeling</B>
<BR><B>until she moved into my room.&nbsp; She also saw a sighting of a
old man in</B>
<BR><B>overalls with a white beard.&nbsp; My mother moved them out of the
house within 3</B>
<BR><B>months.</B>
<BR><B>The other unusual thing about this house was the fact that before
we had</B>
<BR><B>moved in another family had lived there.&nbsp; (Before my aunt bought
the place)</B>
<BR><B>Their son was the juvenile delinquent of the ridge, he was always
into</B>
<BR><B>trouble, drank, was a very dark strange person etc.&nbsp; He had
my old room.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>remember when we bought the house the walls were the old kind with
the thin</B>
<BR><B>slats of wood (which we torn out) but the things that he had done
to those</B>
<BR><B>walls.&nbsp; He had records, knives, etc. sticking out of the walls
of the</B>
<BR><B>bedroom.&nbsp; He also had 3 slide locks on both of the bedroom
doors?&nbsp; I think he</B>
<BR><B>was going through the same things we were.&nbsp; To this day my
aunt still owns</B>
<BR><B>this house.&nbsp; Renters have no sightings of people, or feel evil.&nbsp;
But they do</B>
<BR><B>feel a noise like something is going through the walls in one of
the rooms,</B>
<BR><B>like a current.&nbsp; A buzzing noise.&nbsp; I am a grown woman
of 26 years old and you</B>
<BR><B>could never get me to set foot in that house again.&nbsp; It feels
good sharing my</B>
<BR><B>story with people who will understand and not doubt the things that
i saw.</B>

<BR><B>My Haunted House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: josh_haines_2000@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi this is the story of my, to what I believe, haunted</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; Well the first occurance was when I was about</B>
<BR><B>nine years old.&nbsp; I was laying in bed one night and I</B>
<BR><B>thought I heard the piano playing from the family</B>
<BR><B>room. I got up and went to investigate it but I found</B>
<BR><B>no one to be around and I looked in my parents room</B>
<BR><B>and they were both asleep.&nbsp; I went back to bed and I</B>
<BR><B>suddenly heard the same melodious tune coming from the</B>
<BR><B>family room but this time there were hushed wispers</B>
<BR><B>coming from down the hall.&nbsp; I closed my eyes and fell</B>
<BR><B>asleep shortly after that.&nbsp; Years later when I was</B>
<BR><B>sixteen I was out in my living room watching tv when I</B>
<BR><B>looked in to my hallway and saw a young boy of about</B>
<BR><B>six or seven years of age walk from my mothers room to</B>
<BR><B>the bathroom. I thought my mind was playing tricks on</B>
<BR><B>me so I went to investigate it and found that there</B>
<BR><B>was no one to be found there.&nbsp; I brushed it off and</B>
<BR><B>sat and started to watch the tv program again when I</B>
<BR><B>looked up the young boy walked from the bathroom back</B>
<BR><B>to my mothers room.&nbsp; I got up and walked into my</B>
<BR><B>mothers room and when I walked in my breath was taken</B>
<BR><B>away by the coldness of the room.&nbsp; It was a hot day</B>
<BR><B>and the room felt like it was 30 below!&nbsp; About a year</B>
<BR><B>later I had a series of strange occurances when I</B>
<BR><B>would sleep at night.&nbsp; I would wake up with the</B>
<BR><B>feeling of pressure on my legs and not be able to move</B>
<BR><B>them.&nbsp; Like someone was sitting on them!&nbsp; I would feel</B>
<BR><B>the bed shake slightly like someone had just sat down</B>
<BR><B>on it or had just gotten up from it.&nbsp; I would feel</B>
<BR><B>someone or something touch my legs or my head and</B>
<BR><B>start stroking it or patting it very lightly as if</B>
<BR><B>lulling me to sleep.&nbsp; Other times I would wake up and</B>
<BR><B>go to the bathroom at night and my room would be ice</B>
<BR><B>cold.&nbsp; But the strangest of experieces are the images</B>
<BR><B>or people that I see.&nbsp; I was lying in bed tossing and</B>
<BR><B>turning when I looked into my open closet and saw an</B>
<BR><B>old man standing in the opening to me closet staring</B>
<BR><B>at me.&nbsp; He was wearing black pants and a black vest</B>
<BR><B>with a white dress shirt and a black tie.&nbsp; He stared</B>
<BR><B>at me for about five minutes and I ducked my head</B>
<BR><B>underneath the covers and when I pulled them down he</B>
<BR><B>was gone.&nbsp; The other apparition or figure was not as</B>
<BR><B>plain to see.&nbsp; I was lying in bed again and I looked</B>
<BR><B>over to my doorway and saw a dark figure standing</B>
<BR><B>there staring in my direction.&nbsp; It looked as if he was</B>
<BR><B>wearing faded coveralls but I could not really see him</B>
<BR><B>clearly because he was severely transparent and I</B>
<BR><B>could not make out any good details. One of the last</B>
<BR><B>experiences I had before I left for college was I</B>
<BR><B>walked into my house after hours about 1:00 in the</B>
<BR><B>morning.&nbsp; My mom was at the lakes with her boyfriend</B>
<BR><B>and my brother was staying over with a friend and I</B>
<BR><B>settled down on the couch to watch a little tv before</B>
<BR><B>I hit the sack.&nbsp; I reached for the remote and suddenly</B>
<BR><B>I heard a moanig and groaning sound.&nbsp; It sounded like</B>
<BR><B>my mother and it was coming from her room so I darted</B>
<BR><B>in there to make sure she was alright but when I got</B>
<BR><B>in there I remembered she was gone and didn't bother</B>
<BR><B>to investigate any further.&nbsp; I stood in the living</B>
<BR><B>room flipping through the channels and I turned off</B>
<BR><B>the tv when I heard a person talking very faintly.&nbsp; It</B>
<BR><B>sounded very angry and I couldn't make out what it was</B>
<BR><B>saying but it was not happy about something.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>suddenly heard these creaks and groans and my dog</B>
<BR><B>started to go nuts and I knew I had to get out of the</B>
<BR><B>house so I called my dad and had him pick me up.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>last thing I remember hearing before I ran out of the</B>
<BR><B>house the sound of the angry person scream my name and</B>
<BR><B>was then followed by the slamming of my front door as</B>
<BR><B>soon as I was out.&nbsp; Had I not been runnig out the door</B>
<BR><B>I probably would have been shut inside with whatever</B>
<BR><B>it was that was doing that.&nbsp; When I went to get back</B>
<BR><B>in the house the next morning the front door was</B>
<BR><B>locked and I had to used my spare key to get in.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>never remembered locking the door before I left</B>
<BR><B>because I was too worried about getting out of the</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; From time to time you can hear the cupboard</B>
<BR><B>doors open and close and in the middle of the night</B>
<BR><B>you can hear faint whispers throughout the house.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>mother and brother think I am crazy but I think in the</B>
<BR><B>back of their minds they really belive me.&nbsp; Lets just</B>
<BR><B>say I am apprehensive on visiting when the semester is</B>
<BR><B>done at college!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Our Old House..</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rocket_queen2001@hotmail.com .</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hiya, Great site! I'd like to share my experiences of the paranormal
with</B>
<BR><B>you. I've written them in before and someone wrote back telling
me that it</B>
<BR><B>was possible there could be a paranormal explanation for what occured.
Right</B>
<BR><B>now I'm 18 but I remember the events as if they happened yesterday.
I've</B>
<BR><B>only ever had to move house once which was nearly two years ago.
My parents</B>
<BR><B>and I used to live in East Anglia, UK, which has its fair number
of haunted</B>
<BR><B>old houses but all that is totally un-related. We had a semi-detatched</B>
<BR><B>house. My dad told me it was about 30 years old. I always remember
an evil</B>
<BR><B>presence in that house, although I didn't notice it much back then.
First</B>
<BR><B>experience I had was when I was about 6, and it was late one night
after my</B>
<BR><B>parents had gone to sleep. Our neighbours were away on holiday at
the time.</B>
<BR><B>I had the smallest room which was situated above the garage and
the stair</B>
<BR><B>well. I was just falling asleep when I heard a loud knocking noise,
like</B>
<BR><B>someone rapping against a wall, and it was a rhythmatic rapping.
I ignored</B>
<BR><B>it (or tried to) at first, but then a few seconds later I heard
it again. It</B>
<BR><B>was coming from downstairs, and everytime it happened, it seemed
to be</B>
<BR><B>moving up the stairs, and eventually onto the landing. By this time
I was</B>
<BR><B>creeped out and turned my lamp on which flickered weirdly. Eventually
the</B>
<BR><B>knocking was right inside my room in the far corner, and I was suprised
my</B>
<BR><B>mum or dad didn't hear it. I called out a few times for my mum because
I was</B>
<BR><B>too scared to get out of bed, and she came in. I asked her to stay
with me</B>
<BR><B>and hear the noise for herself. She waited with me, and heard it
too, but</B>
<BR><B>naturally she didn't believe me and told me it was probably the
heating. Why</B>
<BR><B>would the heating make noises which sounded as though they were
coming from</B>
<BR><B>downstairs into my room? Another incident happened just after one
of my</B>
<BR><B>brother's left for University. He was the last one to go. I was
about 10</B>
<BR><B>when this happened, and I had swopped rooms with him anyway so I
was now in</B>
<BR><B>the back room and was alot bigger than the one I had before. This
incident</B>
<BR><B>terrified me the most, and I'll never forget it. I used to sleep
with my</B>
<BR><B>feet out the blanket at the bottom of the bed (obviously) and I
woke up</B>
<BR><B>after feeling cold fingers on my foot. Waking up groggily, I looked
down to</B>
<BR><B>the end of my bed and was suprised to see a black shadow in the
shape of a</B>
<BR><B>human figure. It was looking right my way, I could tell it didn't
have eyes</B>
<BR><B>or any human features, and eventually it turned swiftly and quietly
left the</B>
<BR><B>room. My bedroom door had been shut and it left my room without
the door</B>
<BR><B>opening. You can understand now why I sleep with the covers right
over my</B>
<BR><B>feet! I've had plenty more freaky experiences, they happened on
school trips</B>
<BR><B>and on two occasions we stayed in very old, possibly "haunted" locations.
I</B>
<BR><B>will write them in another time. All that I have told you now is
all very</B>
<BR><B>very true. I wish I had looked into the history of our previous
house, and I</B>
<BR><B>know before it was built, there was just old farmland. On other
times,</B>
<BR><B>especially when I was alone, I got the feeling I wasn't exactly
"all alone"</B>
<BR><B>if you get what I mean. The presence didn't seem very friendly in
itself...</B>

<P><B>THERE IS DEFINATLEY SOMETHING ON</B>
<BR><B>THE LANDING</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: keely027@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>The reason that I want to put my experiences on this</B>
<BR><B>page is so that any future residents of this house</B>
<BR><B>will know that they are not insane!</B>
<BR><B>When I was a student in Nottingham UK I lived in a</B>
<BR><B>shared house for two years, and actually the first</B>
<BR><B>year nothing really happened. Then things started</B>
<BR><B>going weird. It all started when we had a big dinner</B>
<BR><B>party and we invited people from university. We all</B>
<BR><B>had fun and then we went into the living room and</B>
<BR><B>chatted. One guy (who I secretly didnt know what</B>
<BR><B>quite a nasty piece of work and had designs on me</B>
<BR><B>which I did not know about) walked into the joining</B>
<BR><B>kitchen. Within seconds the fluorescent lighting came</B>
<BR><B>crashing down and glass flew everywhere. When we</B>
<BR><B>looked at the light fitting both end of the strip</B>
<BR><B>(which where metal) had been bent up in opposite</B>
<BR><B>directions.</B>
<BR><B>Then when I was in the bathroom air rushed past me so</B>
<BR><B>quick it ruffled my hair. Now I was sitting on the</B>
<BR><B>edge of an empty bath and the windows where painted</B>
<BR><B>shut. It went on to turn over my tv continually</B>
<BR><B>although the remote was over the other side of the</B>
<BR><B>room and there was nothing next to it. But the most</B>
<BR><B>frightening episode was when I was on the landing</B>
<BR><B>outside my room. I was staying there my myself, to</B>
<BR><B>paint the room for the up coming year. And I was</B>
<BR><B>dancing quite outlandishly to a record I put on. I was</B>
<BR><B>feeling good, no one could hear me sing and dance</B>
<BR><B>because everyone had left (end of the educational</B>
<BR><B>year) so I wasnt feeling spooked so I didnt</B>
<BR><B>imagine what happened next. I was dancing and I know</B>
<BR><B>something went through me, it was like time had</B>
<BR><B>stopped and I just felt my body stop. I shot into my</B>
<BR><B>bedroom and stayed there.</B>
<BR><B>Now my saving grace was that I like to make myself</B>
<BR><B>comfortable in my place, and so light a lot of</B>
<BR><B>essential oils and candles etc. my favourite smells</B>
<BR><B>are cinnamon and cloves. Christmas was coming. I</B>
<BR><B>brought myself this candle set that seated five</B>
<BR><B>candles. So for about a period of 5 weeks thats all I</B>
<BR><B>did light my candelabra and burn cloves. Then the</B>
<BR><B>disturbances just seemed to stop. My friend came to</B>
<BR><B>visit from the USA and she practices the craft she</B>
<BR><B>said by sheer accident I had cleansed the room.</B>
<BR><B>Apparently white candles (esp. in five) and</B>
<BR><B>cloves/sage repels spirit! So thats my advice to</B>
<BR><B>anyone who is suffering from unwanted and dangerous</B>
<BR><B>guests.</B>

<P><B>Never Go Back There</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cbarlow21@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This happened about 4 years ago, while I was a Senior</B>
<BR><B>in high school.&nbsp; A bunch of friends and I were looking</B>
<BR><B>for something to do and ended up riding out to a very</B>
<BR><B>old cemetary in the rural area of our small town.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>story goes that there was a young boy who was buried</B>
<BR><B>there decades ago and he has often been seen playing</B>
<BR><B>on the grounds.&nbsp; We, being arrogant kids, did not</B>
<BR><B>believe a word of it and just parked the car at the</B>
<BR><B>cemetary and stood around talking.&nbsp; Pretty soon the</B>
<BR><B>five of us started to wonder from tombstone to</B>
<BR><B>tombstone reading the names of those buried.&nbsp; I walked</B>
<BR><B>over to one that was under a small tree.&nbsp; I was busy</B>
<BR><B>reading it and someone walked up beside me.&nbsp; I was</B>
<BR><B>sure it was my cousin and did not look at him.&nbsp; I just</B>
<BR><B>said "Did you see this one Robby?".&nbsp; Just then, my</B>
<BR><B>cousin, Robby, said "Are you talking to me?" He was</B>
<BR><B>standing several yards away at the parked car.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>could tell in my peripheral vision that the figure on</B>
<BR><B>my left was still there.&nbsp; I did not look at it.&nbsp; I ran</B>
<BR><B>screaming to the car where my friends waited.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>spooked them so badly that they all just jumped in the</B>
<BR><B>car and we sped away.&nbsp; I heard later that the</B>
<BR><B>tombstone under the tree belonged to the boy who is</B>
<BR><B>said to still haunt the cemetary.&nbsp; I may still be</B>
<BR><B>somewhat of a skeptic, but I will never, ever go back there.</B>

<P><B>My Uncle</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: graham@gnowik.demon.co.uk</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I've been reading the stories on this site for about a year and think
the</B>
<BR><B>site is brilliant.</B>
<BR><B>This incident I would like to tell you about happened 3 years ago
now and I</B>
<BR><B>often try to rationalize it but cant.&nbsp; My Uncle had died rather
suddenly,</B>
<BR><B>nobody knew hw was ill he had kept it to him self.&nbsp; Two days
before his</B>
<BR><B>funeral my mum and I travelled to London to help get things prepared
(we</B>
<BR><B>live in Southampton England my uncle live in London) and help my
Aunt.&nbsp; One</B>
<BR><B>the first day there we went to the viewing of the body to say goodbye
but I</B>
<BR><B>couldn't bring my self to see him like that, I wanted to remember
as he was</B>
<BR><B>not lying in a coffin.&nbsp; After this we all went back to my aunts
and as you</B>
<BR><B>can imagine everyone was very upset.&nbsp; That night we were all
sitting in the</B>
<BR><B>lounge having a few drinks and I was sitting at the diner table.&nbsp;
we decided</B>
<BR><B>we should get some sleep as the next day (the funeral) was gonna
be tough,</B>
<BR><B>mum and me slept in the living room.&nbsp; Sitting at the table
I took my</B>
<BR><B>jewellery off and put it all on a coaster (I am always losing stuff
so I</B>
<BR><B>made sure I knew where it was). That night I couldn't sleep very
well I felt</B>
<BR><B>uneasy but just didn't think anything of it.&nbsp; The next morning
we were all</B>
<BR><B>getting cleared up and mum was collecting the glasses from the night
before</B>
<BR><B>for washing up.&nbsp; I went over to the table to put my jewellery
back on but</B>
<BR><B>they were missing.&nbsp; I shouted to mum in the kitchen to see
if she had moved</B>
<BR><B>them but she didn't hear me, my aunty was with me at the time helping
me</B>
<BR><B>look for them.&nbsp; Mum then came back from the kitchen with a
glass in one hand</B>
<BR><B>and my rings etc in the other.&nbsp; She had tipped the contents
from the glass</B>
<BR><B>which was almost full of Rum and coke and my rings etc had been
in the</B>
<BR><B>bottom of the glass when she emptied it and fallen in the sink.&nbsp;
To this day</B>
<BR><B>I cant figure out how they got there but in my heart I think it
was my uncle</B>
<BR><B>as he was always I joker.&nbsp; Other things did follow that day
such all the</B>
<BR><B>lights coming on in the kitchen when we were preparing food the
strange</B>
<BR><B>thing about that was that there are three switches and all came
on.</B>
<BR><B>Hope this was not to boring compared to some of the other stories
on this</B>
<BR><B>site.</B>
<BR><B>Bye</B>

<P><B>My Uncle's Still Here!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: guinness_4@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>In may of 99 my favorite Uncle, Brian died of Cancer. It was a big
surprise</B>
<BR><B>he had always seemed to be so fit and healthy for his age. (he was
61)The</B>
<BR><B>day he died was strange for me. I had gone down to his house to
see him and</B>
<BR><B>found his sister, my auntie Anne stood at the door of his house
talking to</B>
<BR><B>one of his neighbours. My mum looked worried, she had a right to.
That</B>
<BR><B>morning he had been taken in to Wrexham hospital in North Wales,
UK. He had</B>
<BR><B>been complaining that he had a pain in his back for months, for
nye on a</B>
<BR><B>year nearly. Anyway, I didn't know what was going on until I walked
closer</B>
<BR><B>to my mum and her sister talking about what had happened to my Uncle
Brian,</B>
<BR><B>it was then I could smell it. The terrible smell of death looming
over the</B>
<BR><B>house. I had read and heard of people smelling when death is comming
and had</B>
<BR><B>never believed it before, but I knew now that it was true. We visited
the</B>
<BR><B>hospital and I sat watching my limp, pale, Uncles body disintigrate
into</B>
<BR><B>nothing. That was a very sad day for me, and will always be inbedded
into my</B>
<BR><B>mind. As we were all sat around his bed, my mother asked me what
I wanted to</B>
<BR><B>do, In my heart of hearts I wanted to stay by his side, but couldn't
bring</B>
<BR><B>my self to watch him go. I decided to go home, as we arrived home
and I put</B>
<BR><B>my key in the front door I could smell the faint smell of, well,
of</B>
<BR><B>something. I knew that it was the same smell I had smelt in Uncle
Brians. At</B>
<BR><B>that moment I burst into tears, just as I did the telephone rang,
it was</B>
<BR><B>Brians son, Mike. Before anyone picked up the phone I told them
all that he</B>
<BR><B>had died. Mum picked up the phone and sure enough my favourite Uncle
had</B>
<BR><B>died. Minutes before we entered our own house. That is no ghost
story but</B>
<BR><B>this is. My Uncle Brian used to stay with us all the time for the
holidays</B>
<BR><B>(xmas and easter and sometimes birthdays), we had a dart board put
up under</B>
<BR><B>my room in the dining room especially for him, at night when he
was alive</B>
<BR><B>we, or rather I, could here the darts hitting the board with such
force that</B>
<BR><B>it used to run right through the floor of my room! He used to stay
up till</B>
<BR><B>late at night too watching the tele and switching channels on cable
TV!</B>
<BR><B>After he died however, that all stopped. Christmas was as quiet
as a mouse,</B>
<BR><B>there was no tele, no darts hitting the wall or the dart board!
Nothing,</B>
<BR><B>just complete silence. That was until New Year, as soon as it turned
2000,</B>
<BR><B>the noises started again. One night, I couldn't sleep, and thought
I heard</B>
<BR><B>someone moving about downstairs, I thought it was my dad, who suffered
7</B>
<BR><B>heart attacks and has a heiatus Hernear. I walked over to my door
and open</B>
<BR><B>it a little to listen to what was going on down there. As I listended
I felt</B>
<BR><B>a chill run up and down my spine. I could here the tele, I felt
curious so I</B>
<BR><B>made my way down the stairs. As I got to the living room I found
my self</B>
<BR><B>starring at a tele that wasn't even on. That hadn't been on for
hours. I</B>
<BR><B>shrugged and told my self that it was probably next door!</B>
<BR><B>But as I reached the top of the stairs I heard what I thought was
someone</B>
<BR><B>playing darts. I turned on my heel and walked downstairs, again
curious to</B>
<BR><B>find out who it was making these noises. I got to the games room
and looked</B>
<BR><B>at the darts board, it's doors were closed and locked. No one could
have</B>
<BR><B>played with that if they wanted to, without waking my father up
for the key</B>
<BR><B>first. For the record my Uncle loved his tea, his cup was still
hanging up</B>
<BR><B>on the mug tree, as I had gone back up stairs for the second time
I had seen</B>
<BR><B>it with own eyes, hanging there. Still and alone. I got to my room
and went</B>
<BR><B>to sleep, finally! But I had only been aseelp about 15 minutes when
my older</B>
<BR><B>sister, Rebecca, was waking me up. She looked terrified. I asked
her what</B>
<BR><B>was wrong and she told me the following creepy tale:</B><B></B>

<P><B>She was in her room, lying in her bed ready to fall to sleep when
she just</B>
<BR><B>happened to look at the bottom of her bed, there she saw him. My
uncle</B>
<BR><B>Brian. Stood there in all his glory. He was holding his mug in his
right</B>
<BR><B>hand and was starring at her. She couldn't move a muscle. It took
her all</B>
<BR><B>her time to make it out of her room to my room. By this time she
was crying</B>
<BR><B>her eyes out. I don't know what it was that made me do the thing
I did next,</B>
<BR><B>but I felt I had to check that his mug was still hanging up on the
mug tree</B>
<BR><B>like it was about 25 minutes ago. With my sister holding on to my
hand so</B>
<BR><B>tight we made it to the kitchen. His mug was not there. I went into
the</B>
<BR><B>living room and found a still warm cup sitting on the table. Half
full of</B>
<BR><B>steaming tea. To this day he still plays darts and visits my sisters
room.</B>
<BR><B>Maybe he wasn't ment to leave us as soon as he did hey?</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<BR><B>My Personal Experience with Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kinerfled@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello Im a 16 yr old from Ontario, Canada..&nbsp; I just wanted to
say i love your site....&nbsp; I would like to hopefully get my stories
posted on here.. i wrote here about two years ago i don't know if you got
my story???</B>
<BR><B>Anyways let me tell them again..&nbsp; First off by saying im a
very open minded person about lots of things ghosts being one of them.</B>
<BR><B>When i was about 2 almost 3 yrs old my parents and i moved into
an apartment building...</B>
<BR><B>At first i don't remember anything of being weird or paranormal.
but later on i started to have terrible nightmares evry single night.&nbsp;
Evry night my mom and dad would run into my room as i would be screaming
trembling with fear and after i stoped screaming i couldn't talk...</B>
<BR><B>i can't remember what the dreams were about but they scared me alot.</B>
<BR><B>One night i was sleeping and when i awoke there was a rocking chair
that my parents had put in my room and i saw and old man and it wasn't
only that&nbsp; he had a grin on his face and a blue light was sorta shimmering
around him i screamed for my parents by the time they came in he was gone.&nbsp;
I knew i wasn't dreaming my parents thought i had a wild imagantion i guess
cause they never believed me anyways i never saw that man again..</B>
<BR><B>About a year later my mom had a baby which was my baby sister we
had moved from that apartment&nbsp; this happend on the first floor all
those horrible dreams we moved from the first floor the the second floor.
Big move huh :)&nbsp;&nbsp; Well we moved cause the apartments were bigger
on the second floor had more room and since it was four of us now it made
sense.</B>
<BR><B>Well nothing unsual happend there at first till about 3 years later
i started to have more dreams but these dreams i can remember it was always
this one lady in the dream and she scared me for many years until i got
the courage to tell her to leave me alone when i was older in one of my
dreams. You may think im only talking about my dreams but i think there
was a spirit in there causing me to have these dreams my mom even said
someone might of died in the apartment... In my dream she would always
get me frozen and scare me she walked slowley as if not in a rush i could
sense she was out to scare me sorta like an evil spirit.. In my dreams
sometimes she would disguise as my mom that would scare the shit out of
me cause i would have twin moms but i knew it was her...</B>
<BR><B>Anyways thats not all sometimes i would be in my room ( this only
happend at night) and like i would the the only one upstairs i would have
my light and when i left my room for a second when i come back it would
be off or like if i have it off when i come back it would be on..</B>
<BR><B>and my parents don't play tricks on me like that cause they know
how scared i can get and plus they would be downstairs talking when this
happens..</B>
<BR><B>Other times i would see things moving out of the cornor of my eye..</B>
<BR><B>I accpeted this as just part of my life years went on My sister
got older she always told me she heard voices like a woman from a far distance
calling her name.. I didn't believe her at first stupid me cause she was
little and all i just thought she made it up in her head.</B>
<BR><B>Then one morning i was in the kitchen making breakfast for her and
my mom was at work and she called to see how we were doing. Anyways after
we hung up the phone we heard my moms voice scream my sisters name... both
of us&nbsp; my sister said thats not the voice i hear it's diffrent that
sounds like our mom and she asked me if i heard the voice i said yes...</B>
<BR><B>But it couldn't be our mom she just called us from work and this
voice came from upstairs..</B>
<BR><B>At the time our grandparents were living with us i asked them if
they called they said no they were both asleep and it couldn't be them
they have old voices this voice sounded exactly like my moms weird huh
....</B>
<BR><B>Anyways my sister said after that she never heard her name called
again..</B>
<BR><B>I have one more storie about the aparment. One day i was in the
washroom anyways the kitchen was long and had a washroom in it when i came
out of the washroom i saw my dad fixing the sink causing it was leaking
or something beside my dad i saw my little sister she was like talking
to him asking him questions i decided to go upstairs to take a shower.</B>
<BR><B>As i was making my way up the stairs i saw my sister coming down
the stairs with a grin on her face all the hairs raised on my body.. I
knew that couldn't of been her i had just seen her in the kitchen talking
with my dad. This was in the day time by the way so i was in no way sleepy
or imagining i saw it as she past me i just stood there and let her past
it all happend so fast.&nbsp; After my shower i came back downstairs and
asked my sister did she go upstairs at any time she said no and at first
i didn't believe her then i asked my dad did she go upstaris and he said
she was here with me the whole time..</B>
<BR><B>So i know for a fact that the one coming downstairs wasn't her it
was a ghost in disguise of her i believe it was the woman i saw in my nightmares..</B>
<BR><B>I have lived in that apartment for 9 yrs of my life we finally moved
december 28 1995 into the house im living in now this december i will be
living here for 6 years..</B>
<BR><B>I miss my old aparment that may seem strange but i lived there most
of my life 11 years counting the apartment i lived in before.</B>
<BR><B>Im not afraid of ghosts anymore im older i matured i accept them
as just part of my life i welcome ghosts.</B>
<BR><B>That aparment bulding was old and i believe it was haunted none
of my other family memebers ever saw anything only me&nbsp; ohh and only
my sister heard her name being called until that one time i heard it that
was creepy..</B>
<BR><B>The house i know live in is a new one i have had some experiences
in here too but i think ill leave that for next time..&nbsp; I hope you
post my storie i would really apreciate it...</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Orbs</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:dogsoul@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I read your account on orbs and would like to share a true story
that</B>
<BR><B>happenened to me:</B>
<BR><B>Back in 1990, I was 18 years old and staying with a host family
in Veracruz,</B>
<BR><B>Mexico as an exchange student.&nbsp; One day - I awoke to a lot
of bustling and</B>
<BR><B>nervous chatter around the household.&nbsp; I kept hearing the word,
"brujeria"</B>
<BR><B>repeated over and over.&nbsp; Unfamiliar with that word I inquired
about its</B>
<BR><B>meaning which was explained to mean witchcraft in spanish.&nbsp;
Apparently,</B>
<BR><B>someone found a cross laid down in granulated salt in the back yard
which</B>
<BR><B>according to the native residents was a clear sign of witchcraft.&nbsp;
Being the</B>
<BR><B>consumate skeptic, I just knodded and secretly chuckled at the genuine
worry</B>
<BR><B>this superstitiousness was creating.&nbsp; Later that evening, the
day's</B>
<BR><B>excitement culminated into a sort of ghost story session in the
kitchen area</B>
<BR><B>where it was explained to me that witches and spirits have been
known to</B>
<BR><B>travel in shadows or balls of light.&nbsp; "...What ever happened
to the</B>
<BR><B>broomstick?.."&nbsp; I belted as I laughed out loud.&nbsp; After
a few more stories, I</B>
<BR><B>had heard enough and decided to show them just what I thought of
their</B>
<BR><B>primitive beliefs.&nbsp; I ran out the back door and approached
the cross of salt</B>
<BR><B>that started this whole charade as the group clamoured after me.
I stood</B>
<BR><B>above the cross, unzipped my pants and starting urinating on the
cross -</B>
<BR><B>washing it away - all the while I raised my hands in the air and
yelled</B>
<BR><B>upwards something along the lines of, "...I challenge the spirits
of hell to</B>
<BR><B>DARE harm me!..." Anyway, they all thought I was taking a big risk
but I</B>
<BR><B>just laughed it off.&nbsp; Later that night, my host brother and
I were dropping</B>
<BR><B>off friends with the family flat bed.&nbsp; As the last one jumped
out from the</B>
<BR><B>rear I turned my head and watched him enter his household.&nbsp;
Before I turned</B>
<BR><B>my head back to a frontal view, I saw a ball of light not 10 feet
from where</B>
<BR><B>I was sitting.&nbsp; It danced around a small tree and had a plain
beige</B>
<BR><B>wall(side of the house) with no windows as a backdrop - it was clear
as day.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; It looked sort of like those bubbles made from soap that
kids blow only it</B>
<BR><B>had a bright center and the light seemed to STOP dead at the edges
of the</B>
<BR><B>orb - i.e. it didn't seem to light up its surroundings even though
it was</B>
<BR><B>quite bright.&nbsp; Anyway, I watched this thing intently for about
7-10 seconds</B>
<BR><B>as it danced its way over the tree, over the top of the house, and
then took</B>
<BR><B>off at an incredible speed.&nbsp; Now - this whole time I hadn't
turned around to</B>
<BR><B>my host brother but when I did - he was pale white and asked me.."....viste</B>
<BR><B>eso?"(Did you see that?)- to which I replied, "...la bolita de luz?"(the</B>
<BR><B>little ball of light?).... He knodded affirmatively and we sped
out of there</B>
<BR><B>scared half to death.&nbsp; The next day, our friend who we dropped
off just</B>
<BR><B>before the incident refused to believe us because he claimed that
we had</B>
<BR><B>obviously heard of the "witch" that lived in the direction we "claimed"
the</B>
<BR><B>ball to have sped off in.&nbsp; Now I'm not going to claim that
I KNOW for sure</B>
<BR><B>what that thing was... but I saw it clear as day AND I had a witness.&nbsp;
No</B>
<BR><B>drugs or alchohol were present in either of our systems.&nbsp; While
I am totally</B>
<BR><B>open - in fact leaning toward - an entirely physical(possibly geological)</B>
<BR><B>explaination - I can't ignore the timing of the whole thing.</B>

<P><B>Paranormal Happenings</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Angelinthefire43@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My first ghost experience started happening to me about 2 days after
my Mom</B>
<BR><B>and stepdad bought this house. We have a child proof door to keep
my little</B>
<BR><B>sister and the dogs from going downstairs. It only comes to about
3 feet high</B>
<BR><B>and it can only be opened from the other side. Since we had just
moved in and</B>
<BR><B>hadn't gotten any of the bedroom furniture into the house yet I
had slept out</B>
<BR><B>on a cot in our living room, where you can see the child proof door
that</B>
<BR><B>leads to the stair case. Anyway as I started to drift off I felt
as though</B>
<BR><B>someone was watching me and so I rolled over to face the door, only
to</B>
<BR><B>discover what seemed to be a solid shadow with one arm over the
door and head</B>
<BR><B>peering over at me. It soon disappeared and since it was dark I
just</B>
<BR><B>convinced myself that my eyes were playing tricks on me so I went
back to</B>
<BR><B>sleep. But it kept happening, and my mother soon started telling
me she's</B>
<BR><B>seen it too whenever she goes to get some water or go to the bathroom
and I</B>
<BR><B>hadn't told her that I'd seen anything. We could both swear to God
that</B>
<BR><B>there's someone there looking at us. Then after we finally got settled
in I</B>
<BR><B>started sleeping in my room instead of the living room. Since I
can't sleep</B>
<BR><B>without a little light and my bedroom is in the basement I have
a dull green</B>
<BR><B>light in my walk in closet which you can clearly see into from my
bed. So one</B>
<BR><B>night I had been reading my book and over the top of my book I saw
a solid</B>
<BR><B>shadowy figure in the shape of a man just walk through my closet.
I was so</B>
<BR><B>scared I ran upstairs as fast as I could. My Mom and step dad came
out and</B>
<BR><B>asked me what was wrong and so I told them. They looked irritated
and said</B>
<BR><B>that it was just my imagination and I should go back downstairs
and get some</B>
<BR><B>sleep. So I did until 1:30 in the morning. I woke up because I heard
someone</B>
<BR><B>calling my name and I thought maybe it was time to go to school.
Then when I</B>
<BR><B>was fully awake I realized school wouldn't start for another week
and that</B>
<BR><B>the voice calling my name was unfamiliar to me. So I froze in my
bed but I</B>
<BR><B>kept hearing my name until it was like a whisper in my ear and I
felt</B>
<BR><B>something that was almost like a cold finger running down my back.
I almost</B>
<BR><B>ran back upstairs to wake my parents again but remembered what their
reaction</B>
<BR><B>had been last time and decided that maybe if I just laid in bed
it would go</B>
<BR><B>away. Then the TV turned on to channel 60 (at the time we didn't
have cable)</B>
<BR><B>and on the TV was a televised add about contacting the dead, then
it shut</B>
<BR><B>off. I screamed and ran up the stairs as fast as I could and slept
on the</B>
<BR><B>couch for the rest of the night. To this day I refuse to sleep down
stairs,</B>
<BR><B>no matter how childish it sounds. Also another thing that has happened
to me</B>
<BR><B>was for a long time I was deathly afraid that the lights in my room
would go</B>
<BR><B>off and my door would slam shut so I couldn't get out, and one night
when I</B>
<BR><B>went downstairs to get something my door creaked and slowly started
closing</B>
<BR><B>and then my lights flickered. I went upstairs as fast as I could
and asked</B>
<BR><B>everyone if the lights had flickered upstairs and they all responded
no.</B>
<BR><B>Various other things still happen in my house, like one time when
I was</B>
<BR><B>wrapping a Christmas present I put down the tape and went to pick
it up again</B>
<BR><B>and it wasn't there. I asked my mother who was in the room with
me if she had</B>
<BR><B>taken it and she said no. We searched all over the house and finally
we found</B>
<BR><B>it on the kitchen counter. CD players go on and off, the dogs bark
and growl</B>
<BR><B>randomly like there's a stranger standing right in front of them,
the cats</B>
<BR><B>hair stands on end and they hiss at nothing and bolt in the other
direction,</B>
<BR><B>and sometimes when I go downstairs to do the laundry or something
I get the</B>
<BR><B>sudden urge that I need to run quickly or something horrible will
happen, and</B>
<BR><B>believe me I do.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Possible Ghostly Phenomena</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pinksirona2d@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello. My name is Brittany. I am not possible how my story will be
accepted,</B>
<BR><B>but a few things that have happened are something to consider.</B>
<BR><B>There are 3 parts to my story. The 1st part is my parent's personal</B>
<BR><B>encounters. The 2nd part is an encounter my parents and I both shared.
And</B>
<BR><B>the 3rd is my own personal encounters.</B>
<BR><B>Part 1.</B>
<BR><B>The Noisy Spirit</B>
<BR><B>When my parents first bought out house, it was very small. Only
a kitchen,</B>
<BR><B>dining room, and living room. Upstairs, there were 2 bedrooms and
a bathroom.</B>
<BR><B>My parents had been inspecting every room one at a time, to see
exactly what</B>
<BR><B>they needed to fix it up. My parents were upstairs in one of the
bedrooms,</B>
<BR><B>when they heard noises downstairs in the kitchen. When they got
downstairs</B>
<BR><B>*according to their story* to investigate, the cupboard doors were
swinging</B>
<BR><B>back and forth wildly.&nbsp; They walked over to shut them, and
voices yelled at</B>
<BR><B>them to just leave immediately.&nbsp; They didn't listen.&nbsp;
5 years later, I was</B>
<BR><B>born. By then they had built on two family rooms, 2 porches, a laundry
room,</B>
<BR><B>pantry, and they even built on a shop where they conducted their
business.</B>
<BR><B>They normally heard music playing and voices yelling at them, but
they</B>
<BR><B>ignored it *for whatever reason*</B>
<BR><B>Part 2</B>
<BR><B>The Attacks</B>
<BR><B>When I was 10 years old, a lot of very dangerous attacks started
happening.</B>
<BR><B>My dad started being ferociously attacked during the night by invisible</B>
<BR><B>forces. Now, my dad slept upstairs in his bedroom alone, because
the bed hurt</B>
<BR><B>my moms back, so she always slept downstairs on the couch. My bedroom
is</B>
<BR><B>directly beside theirs, so I could hear everything going on in there.</B>
<BR><B>Normally, my dad would wake up to feel as if he were being held
down,</B>
<BR><B>strangled, bit, scratched, cut with a knife, carried around the
room, ect.</B>
<BR><B>When he would wake up in the morning, he would have bite marks in
impossible</B>
<BR><B>places on his body, cuts, scratches, red bruises around his neck
and wrists,</B>
<BR><B>and long deep gashes across his chest. Now this didn't happen all
in one</B>
<BR><B>night, but things happened frequently. I was really starting to
get worried.</B>
<BR><B>My grandma and aunt phil taught be an Italian prayer to keep away
the evil.</B>
<BR><B>It went (and don't quote me on spelling because im not sure, but
it is</B>
<BR><B>PRONOUNCED this way)</B>
<BR><B>A Knock a Knock , a bone a deesh. Alla Virgin Alla Maria. San deeseema</B>
<BR><B>deer knee dah Vee olla voor.)</B>
<BR><B>That is a prayer to the Virgin Mary to keep all evil out. They told
me to say</B>
<BR><B>that 3 times every night and it would keep evil out. I said it three
times in</B>
<BR><B>dedication to my father, and things slowly started to get better.
It was</B>
<BR><B>still very scary because I never expected the entities to be so
violent</B>
<BR><B>Part 3</B>
<BR><B>My Personal Encounters</B>
<BR><B>Well, now that I am 16, certain things have happened to me. They
aren't</B>
<BR><B>violent or even frightening, more-so reassuring. To explain a bit,
my bedroom</B>
<BR><B>door is the kind of door that unless you prop it open, it swings
shut again.</B>
<BR><B>And fast, too!&nbsp; Well, for the past year and couple months,
I have noticed</B>
<BR><B>that there might be a spirit that is checking on me. When I sleep
or late at</B>
<BR><B>night, My door will swing open, wide enough for a head to look in
to check on</B>
<BR><B>me, to make sure I'm ok. I'll look because it creaks, and see nothing
there.</B>
<BR><B>It will stay open at that width for 2 minutes, as if someone is
checking on</B>
<BR><B>me. Then it will slowly shut, the door knob will turn, and it will
close all</B>
<BR><B>the way.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like I said, it was reassuring because I felt
as if someone,</B>
<BR><B>whoever it was, was checking on me to make sure I'm ok. And they're
just</B>
<BR><B>trying to tell me their here for me.</B>
<BR><B>I'm glad I have it. I look at it as my Spirit Guide. I am pagan,
so on my</B>
<BR><B>website you will understand my belief in Spirit guides</B>

<BR><B>Condo Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: KrAyZeEcYkO@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I just watched that movie "The haunted" with my brother (I don't
know if you</B>
<BR><B>have ever seen that movie?) but in the movie this demon makes itself
look</B>
<BR><B>like a black glob and my brother and Mom said that's what they saw
when they</B>
<BR><B>lived in this one condo in Florida. I guess everyone who had lived
there</B>
<BR><B>(with my Mom) had seen the ghost or whatever it was. They said there
would be</B>
<BR><B>doors opening and slamming shut, lights going on and off, footsteps
and one</B>
<BR><B>time my brother was in his room (he hates to talk about this) sleeping
and he</B>
<BR><B>woke up and at the foot of his bed this man was pacing holding a
real bowl</B>
<BR><B>whistling and from what I'm told it turned and looked straight at
him and</B>
<BR><B>that's when he jumped out of his bed and ran to my Mom crying. My
brother Ron</B>
<BR><B>would get so scared sometimes he would actually go and sleep at
rest areas. I</B>
<BR><B>guess that was the first time anyone had saw the ghosts look like
a man,</B>
<BR><B>everyone else had seen it like a back glob like on the movie. Finally
they</B>
<BR><B>had some Mormons come (we have a few in the family) and they just
moved out.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I have a lot of stories from things that have happened to
my Mom</B>
<BR><B>and family.</B>

<BR><B>England</B><B></B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I am 19 years old, work in the computer industry in</B>
<BR><B>London, England.</B>
<BR><B>When I was around 10 or 11, I used to live in another</B>
<BR><B>part of the country, called Dudley, West Midlands.</B>
<BR><B>Opposite our house was a pub called the Hangmans Tree.</B>
<BR><B>We found out later that this pub was were people in</B>
<BR><B>the late 18th Century hung people for crimes such as</B>
<BR><B>highway robbery, murder etc. Anyways, My sister was</B>
<BR><B>about 7 or 8, but didn't like the dark, so she always</B>
<BR><B>used to call mum to take her to the toilet in the</B>
<BR><B>night. One night my mum heard my sister go to the</B>
<BR><B>toilet on her own. In the morning said, "Well done,</B>
<BR><B>you went to the toilet on your own last night!!" my</B>
<BR><B>sister replied, "No I didn't, the black man took me".</B>
<BR><B>My mum panicked at this point, and thought someone</B>
<BR><B>must have got into the house! She said, "What black</B>
<BR><B>man??" My sister said, "he's my friend, he sits with</B>
<BR><B>me at night and tells me stories". We were all getting</B>
<BR><B>really scared now, my mum asked how she knew it was a</B>
<BR><B>black man? "Because when he smiles, I can see his</B>
<BR><B>teeth".</B>
<BR><B>We were all really freaked out by this, but my sister</B>
<BR><B>did'nt really seem all that bothered by it. So we</B>
<BR><B>decided, whatever it was it was friendly. A couple of</B>
<BR><B>weeks later, I walked into my sisters room to check on</B>
<BR><B>her and found that the rocking chair in the corner of</B>
<BR><B>the room was rocking on it's own, at a steady pace,</B>
<BR><B>and my sister fast asleep...............</B>

<P><B>In Tune</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jhilton@peakpeak.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Where to begin? This is Alex&nbsp; of Littleton, Colorado by the
way @</B>
<BR><B>jhilton@peakpeak.com. I have always been in tune with the supernatural.
My</B>
<BR><B>first experience that I remember was at my Grandmother's house,
and I think</B>
<BR><B>I was about five years old. My Grandfather had died long before
I was born,</B>
<BR><B>and when My mother was about six months old. I remember him coming
into my</B>
<BR><B>room, and telling me goodnight, and that he loved me and telling
me about</B>
<BR><B>the bedtime story of the three bears. I asked my grandmother who
the man</B>
<BR><B>was, and she said there was no one in the house but her, my mother,
my</B>
<BR><B>brother, and I. I told her the man's name, and she laughed, and
said my</B>
<BR><B>mother probably told me to tell her this. I said my mother was asleep,
and</B>
<BR><B>was about 20 feet from me, in another room, and I don't think she
could have</B>
<BR><B>heard him. Granny said that was true, and she called my mother in
and said</B>
<BR><B>"Hey, jacky, did you tell him about Pat?" my mother said no, that
she didn't</B>
<BR><B>remember him herself. My grandmother asked me to describe the man
to her. I</B>
<BR><B>said he was about six feet tall, and wiry, with brown hair, and
blue eyes,</B>
<BR><B>and he could imitate different accents. He told me in an english
accent that</B>
<BR><B>he loved me, and in an thick Irish Brogue goodnight. Then he told
me the</B>
<BR><B>whole story of the three bears in a very english accent. He didn't
seem like</B>
<BR><B>a ghost at all. He seemed completely real to me. He's still with
me down to</B>
<BR><B>this day. My grandmother was completely Awed by this. She said I
described</B>
<BR><B>my dead Grandfather Patrick Dona Peak to a tee. (I have had to move
from</B>
<BR><B>Oregon, and change my name to prevent ridicule of my abilities.
my true name</B>
<BR><B>is Patrick Nathan Peak, I was named after my grandfather. Please
refer to me</B>
<BR><B>as Alex in any e-mails, as no one here knows me as Patrick) I had
never seen</B>
<BR><B>my grandfather's picture before, and my Grandmother told me so.
My</B>
<BR><B>grandmother is very open-minded, but the rest of my family is not.
She got</B>
<BR><B>tears in her eyes, and she took me in her lap, she said "Patrick,
do you</B>
<BR><B>know anything about your family history?" I said no. She said "You
hail from</B>
<BR><B>a long line of Very powerful people. " She said that our family
was old, and</B>
<BR><B>went all the way back to England, Ireland, and Scotland. Back before
the</B>
<BR><B>Christians, and The Muslims, and back into time immemorial. She
said every</B>
<BR><B>generation had a special abiltity, and So did I. My grandmother
gets dreams,</B>
<BR><B>and they always come true. 2 years before MT. St. Helens blew it's
top, she</B>
<BR><B>told us it was going to blow. She's like that. She told me our family</B>
<BR><B>Practiced the Olde Religion. I said "what, Christians?" she said
no, she</B>
<BR><B>said Druidry, and Wicca. I was like what's that? and she said she'd
explain</B>
<BR><B>it to me when I was older. She told me to tell Pat She still loved
him after</B>
<BR><B>all these years. He came in the next night, and I told him what
she said,</B>
<BR><B>and he said he knew. He said he loved her too. I asked him what
it's like to</B>
<BR><B>be dead. He laughed, and said "Do I look dead to you son?" i said
no. He</B>
<BR><B>said he was alive, and just didn't have a body anymore. So then
I left after</B>
<BR><B>telling my grandmother about all that. she said "Patrick, don't
share with</B>
<BR><B>other people your abilities, as they'll not understand them, and
they'll</B>
<BR><B>ridicule you, and poke fun at you" I didn't listen to her. I told
some</B>
<BR><B>people about my abilities, and they said I was Crazy, and tried
to have me</B>
<BR><B>committed to a mental hospital. I got tired of being persecuted,
and</B>
<BR><B>villified, so I moved to Colorado, and changed my name to Alex summers.
I am</B>
<BR><B>not an escaped mental patient or anything. I had to do this. This
story is</B>
<BR><B>100% true. My grandmother is still alive, and she'll corroborate
it. I have</B>
<BR><B>never told anyone this story. Except my mother, and Grandmother.
My mother</B>
<BR><B>raised me as a christian much to my grandmother's dismay. My grandmother</B>
<BR><B>said one of my great-great-great, etc. Aunts was burned at the stake
in the</B>
<BR><B>salem witch trials. She said her name was Beatrice o'pecke. She
said she</B>
<BR><B>really was a witch, and they burned her because christians are afraid
of</B>
<BR><B>what they don't understand. I am sorry to deviate from my story,
but I</B>
<BR><B>needed to tell someone all this. I have been keeping this inside
a long</B>
<BR><B>time. This story is not fiction, or my imagination, it is true.
thanks for</B>
<BR><B>listening to me. I have had many more experiences, but this will
suffice for</B>
<BR><B>now your friend, Alex</B>

<BR><B>San Antonio River</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: stella.m.espinoza.h7gi@statefarm.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well here we go, I am not sure if what I am experiencing is an actual
haunting or if everything can be naturally explained. I live in south Texas,
out in the sticks, I am 17 years old and currently attend high school (I
will be graduating this year woo hoo!) Our house is very new, it is only
four years old, and built by us, so nothing bad has happened in the house.
However, we live directly on the banks of the San Antonio river, in fact
we are situated on a 75 foot cliff. On our property stands another house
where we also used to live while our house was being built. I never liked
this house and always felt VERY uneasy when staying there alone, or for
that matter, with others in the house. I do not know exactly how old this
house is, but I do now that when the were adding new boards to the siding,
they found old newspapers dating to the late 30's and early 40's in the
sides of the house. Now let me explain the lay out of the older house.
It has one bedroom, and one kitchen, there is a living room, dinning room
and "entertainment" area for guest, the living room used to be my room.
Between the bathroom, and the bedroom, there lies a closet, the closet
has two doors, connecting both rooms together. I always felt as if something
was watching me from everywhere in the house. But never really experienced
anything. Now that we have moved into our new house, things have intensified,
I always feel the "eyes" on me now, and sometimes I am forced to run downstairs,
because of the over-whelming sense of dread that occurs while I am upstairs
alone. I hear my shower door open and close during the night, and when
I am downstairs watching TV I can hear the water running in my bathroom.
When school is in session, I usually get up around 5:30 to get ready, because
I am Academics Editor for the Yearbook, as well as Class Treasurer, so
I usually have to be there early, so I can get everything in order for
the student body. Well once I was taking a shower, when I felt something
hit the back of my leg with extreme force, I turned to rub my leg and search
for the culprit, thinking maybe I had accidentally knocked over a bottle
of shampoo, yet directly behind me was a penny, I have no idea where that
could have come from. I haven't told anyone as I think no one would believe
me, and I am more than happy to keep this to myself, except, about two
weeks ago I had a dream that disturbed me greatly, and I feel someone needs
to know. I had a dream that I lived in the old house on my land, and I
was dressed in old style (late 30's) clothing, and I was washing dishes,
all of a sudden, a girl came running into the kitchen and kissed me, telling
me she was on her way to an Ice Cream social in town and that her boyfriend(
she gave me a name but I can't remember now) would be picking her up, and
taking her. she appeared to be my age now, and I am supposing I was her
mother, because I told her to take care and to wait to say goodbye to her
father. Something I would never say! Anyway, another girl appeared from
the back, and I was now outside standing on the porch drying my hands,
and waving at a man pulling up in and old style car, like you see in mafia
movies...from a long time ago...I kissed him, and he appeared to be my
husband, he was explaining to me about his recent business adventure, when
I suddenly realized who I was, I took the man by the arms and began to
shake him uncontrollably, telling him he was crazy because in a few months
the great depression would fall, and we would all starve to death, and
we should save our money and move to Florida . He took a hold of me and
told me that the heat must have gotten to me, kissed "our" two daughters
goodbye and took me inside to the house, only we went into the bedroom,
and continued to walk through a second door, and into a second bedroom,
that the house does not have today, and he laid me down on a cot like bed
and told me to get my rest, then he kissed me on my forehead, and when
I closed my eyes, I woke up in my room. It was the strangest dream I have
ever had. and as a result I have been not able to sleep for days, I usually
go to bed at 10, but lately I have been drifting off at 2 or 3 in the morning,
and I usually dream every time, except now I don't or do not remember when
I wake up. I still feel like I am being watched, and I have no idea what
is going on...if you or anyone can shed light on my situation please e-mail
me at DearPrudence@beatlemail.com I would greatly appreciate in</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Saying Goodbye</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: libbie.greene@sabre.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>In the winter of 1996 my mother called me from Georgia to let me
know</B>
<BR><B>that my Grandfather had slipped into a coma and he was not going
to last</B>
<BR><B>long. I was the first born grandchild and very close to my pawpaw.
The</B>
<BR><B>last words he spoke were of me. I was coming from Texas and it was
a two</B>
<BR><B>day trip. To complicate matters we had an ice storm only the night</B>
<BR><B>before so the roads were dangerous.</B>
<BR><B>My sister and I drove to Georgia and all the way I kept thinking
"Hang</B>
<BR><B>on Pawpaw, I'm coming home". We pulled in to Grandma's house and
went</B>
<BR><B>straight to Pawpaw's bedside. He was on hospice and wanted to die
at</B>
<BR><B>home. Momma and daddy set him up in the living room so he could
still be</B>
<BR><B>a part of the activity going on in the house. Anyway, Lynn and I
went to</B>
<BR><B>Pawpaw's bedside and I took his hand and said "it's ok now Pawpaw.
I'm</B>
<BR><B>here. I love you." I could hear the gurgling sound in his breathing
and</B>
<BR><B>I knew that it would not be long. I sat on the couch next to his
bed and</B>
<BR><B>kept a vigil by his side. Before the morning sun rose my Pawpaw
died.</B>
<BR><B>The people from the funeral home came later that morning and took
him</B>
<BR><B>away to prepare his body. When they were done they brought him back
and</B>
<BR><B>placed the casket in the front living room where he died. We held
a wake</B>
<BR><B>for him and we sat up with the dead. Now, Pawpaw died on a Wednesday
the</B>
<BR><B>day before Thanksgiving. So on Thanksgiving night he was all alone.
I</B>
<BR><B>sat up with my pawpaw so he would not be lonely. Now I am laying
on the</B>
<BR><B>couch in the living room with my dead Pawpaw at my head and the
long</B>
<BR><B>hallway at my feet. Pawpaw's bed room is at the end of that long
hallway</B>
<BR><B>and the kitchen door was just before the living room door. You can</B>
<BR><B>clearly see both of them at the same time.</B>
<BR><B>Pawpaw was an early riser and would start breakfast for us when
we would</B>
<BR><B>visit. You could hear him walking down the hallway (it had a hardwood</B>
<BR><B>floor that creaked with each foot step) it was a comforting sound
to me.</B>
<BR><B>Well, as I was lying on the couch reading a novel I noticed that
the</B>
<BR><B>radio station was playing all of my Pawpaw's favorite music. This
music</B>
<BR><B>is not found in very many play list. We are talking Minnie Pearl
and</B>
<BR><B>songs like "how to catch a man", "Too Old", "Little Jimmy Browm"
and I</B>
<BR><B>thought that was strange. Then I heard pawpaw's bed room door open,</B>
<BR><B>footsteps going slowly up the hall and toward me! I slowly peeked
over</B>
<BR><B>my book and felt such love and warmth all over me. I knew I was
getting</B>
<BR><B>a big hug from that wonderful man. Then the warm was gone and the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen door creaked open. I swallowed real hard and said "mornin'</B>
<BR><B>Pawpaw"</B>
<BR><B>He is still there. When ever go to visit I can feel him hug me real</B>
<BR><B>close and I know that he still loves me.</B>

<P><B>Home Alone</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: akbarmohommed@marijuana.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>You know how some people say that there is no such thing as the paranormal?
Well those people are all&nbsp; wrong. I've always had the gift of seeing
things. Good or Evil. It doesn't matter. My parents think I'm crazy but
I know that I see these things. It all statred after I found out that I
had a stroke early when I was baby. I was about 6-7 years old. But I'm
not sure. It was this kind spirit who visited me saying that he was trapped
between the other side and the human side. He was an elderly man about
70-75 years of age. He said that I am the person to hear/see him. The other
occurance. A bad one was when I was only 11. It would bang on my wall and
I usually found huddling in my room corner. When my mother would come in
my room she would find me screaming saying GO AWAY! LEAVE ME ALONE! Another
occasion would be when we moved into a house about 4 years earlier. There
was a pressence but I wasn't sure if it was a bad or good spirit. Not until
it happened. it was a Thursday and my parenst and brothers were out. They
left me alone (I was mature enough to stay home alone at 12) but anyway
it was a Friday and we have had a huge thunderstorm and Poor little me
alone in the house. I heard something coming from outside.. like a banging
noise. So I ran to lock all the doors and windows. The noise again. But
this time it was coming from the inside. I ran to my parents closet(walk-in)
hid there the noise or whatever it was&nbsp; getting closer It got to my
parents bedroom door and the noise got louder. But then the sounds of breaking
glass and screaming. I opened the closet door and saw a couple. A man and
a woman. They were fighting. he had a glass plate in his hand and smashed
it over the woman's head. This couple was a very young couple from well
by the looks of their clothes the eraly 1900's. The man beat his wife until
she lay on the floor in a pool of her blood. The man then turned to me
and said YOUR NEXT! all I remember is waking up to my mother shaking me.
I had some how got a bruise on my head. That was the most violent they
got. The occurances that I have now are only good. There is a lady(the
previous owner) who looks after me. She likes to spook the people who are
mean to me. She will bang on the walls until they left. Then I would say
Good one but next time more force. I am only 16 years of age I do not "see"
things that aren't there. These experiences are all real. To this day I
don't know who that couple was. and hopefully never will.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Various Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Zozama1321@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>When I was a little kid living in Columbia, MD, (about 6 or 7) there
was a</B>
<BR><B>car crash behind my best friend's house (there was a large hill
behind his</B>
<BR><B>house and a field behind that, the field is where the car exploded)
After the</B>
<BR><B>crash which killed the man who was driving, my friends and I gathered
up</B>
<BR><B>pieces of junk left over from the wreckage (glass, burnt money,
cards, ID-</B>
<BR><B>which proved useful later, and other useless junk) and took it home.
Nothing</B>
<BR><B>happened until one day my older brother's friend came over. He knew
nothing</B>
<BR><B>of the accident, and apparently had psychic abilities, I never believed
him</B>
<BR><B>until we brought him to the crash site. There he accurately gave
a</B>
<BR><B>description of the man who was killed, and how he died. He continued
to say</B>
<BR><B>that the man was still there and he wasn't the only one there were
many</B>
<BR><B>spirits, (there was a neighborhood legend that a farmer that originally
owned</B>
<BR><B>the area died in a bizarre way, and he wandered the field, woods,
and</B>
<BR><B>neighborhood.... I never believed it, though the man could have
lived there</B>
<BR><B>before the town was founded in the 1960s). All of us were pretty
scared and</B>
<BR><B>started to leave, when we heard rustling in the tall grass. We ran
faster</B>
<BR><B>than we had ever ran before that day. Later my brother and I went
to sleep</B>
<BR><B>over at the friend who lived near the crash site. We all went out
for a walk</B>
<BR><B>at around midnight, and walked on the top of the hill. My friend
gasped in</B>
<BR><B>horror as he looked below. There was a man walking at the site,
he didn't</B>
<BR><B>look like a regular man because we could see him in a pitch black
area. We</B>
<BR><B>never went for a walk like that again. Sometimes I wonder if we
really saw a</B>
<BR><B>ghost and if my brother's friend communicated with one, or if it
was our</B>
<BR><B>minds playing tricks on us. If anyone else has had an experience
around that</B>
<BR><B>area (Near the neighborhood Black Star Circle in Columbia, Maryland)
would</B>
<BR><B>you share it so my friends and I know we weren't seeing things that
night,</B>
<BR><B>and if anyone discovers the farmer legend is untrue or true that
would put my</B>
<BR><B>mind at ease.</B>
<BR><B>PA Story</B>
<BR><B>I moved to Bucks County, PA in 1995 (when I was almost 9), and my
family</B>
<BR><B>rented a house. It was a nice house, it had no basement, but it
had a loft</B>
<BR><B>which was my play area. My room in the house was always cold, which
didn't</B>
<BR><B>bother me much because it was summer when we moved in. The first
day we moved</B>
<BR><B>in my cat was with me in the loft (there was a door to enter and
an opening</B>
<BR><B>over the main staircase) my cat began to hiss (she never did that
ever, I</B>
<BR><B>would know I had the cat since I was 1 year old) She then ran down
the stairs</B>
<BR><B>and jumped on top of the opening and started hissing at something.
I ran</B>
<BR><B>after her and she jumped (luckily my brother grabbed her before
she could</B>
<BR><B>hurt herself, she was older and he fall could have killed her).
Nothing</B>
<BR><B>happened until a year later on Mischief Night (October 30th) my
best friend</B>
<BR><B>slept over my house, my brother was at a friend's house sleeping
over and my</B>
<BR><B>parents were out of town, they were coming back the next day (my
great uncle</B>
<BR><B>died and they were at his funeral in another part of PA). At around
1:30 I</B>
<BR><B>Left the loft where we were sleeping to get a drink of water and
watch TV Now</B>
<BR><B>this didn't happen to me but my friend said he heard footsteps coming
up the</B>
<BR><B>stairs (he assumed it was me) he heard someone lay down on the couch
in the</B>
<BR><B>room, and then the person got up and walked over to him. He said
it knelt</B>
<BR><B>down beside him inflatable bed did nothing. My friend turned over
to tell who</B>
<BR><B>he thought was me to go to sleep and stop making so much noise,
when he</B>
<BR><B>turned over nothing was there. I had fallen asleep downstairs in
the living</B>
<BR><B>room where I found him sleeping the next morning. He told me what
happened. A</B>
<BR><B>few other things happened in the house like things were moved around
(like I</B>
<BR><B>left my Necklace on a table then found it in the loft) but nothing</B>
<BR><B>threatening. My family moved out of the house in January because
we had</B>
<BR><B>bought a brand New home (which we waited for to be built, that's
why we</B>
<BR><B>rented the house)</B>
