<p><b>Drawn to the Supernatural</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: akemp@avis.com</b>
<br><b>I am writing to you because you had mentioned on your web page that
you have</b>
<br><b>supernatural experience.</b>
<br><b>Since I could remember, I always seem to be drawn to the supernatural.
When</b>
<br><b>I was younger I remember looking for shows</b>
<br><b>pertaining to the supernatural. I would sit down to watch these
shows and</b>
<br><b>say to myself "this is crazy, why am I watching this stuff". Then
later on</b>
<br><b>when I was about 26 I started to get these feelings, the only way
I could</b>
<br><b>describe it is, if you were in your house alone, and the tv was
on in the</b>
<br><b>other room you some how sence it, like you didn't feel alone, you
would go</b>
<br><b>around, saw that the tv was on and turn it off. And that feeling
would stop.</b>
<br><b>Well I get that same feeling when nothing is on in the house, only
the</b>
<br><b>energy sence is a little louder, and it feels like it is getting
closer. I</b>
<br><b>look in the hall to see if someone is coming, or if someone was
home and I</b>
<br><b>didn't know it. I also smell things, sometimes like very sweet flowers,
or</b>
<br><b>something old smelling like it came from the attic. One night I
fell asleep</b>
<br><b>on the couch, I opened my eyes and saw this smokey thing start small
and</b>
<br><b>grow in a matter of seconds, I made a little sound because I couldn't
belive</b>
<br><b>what I was seeing if you could imagine. Well its strange but it
was like the</b>
<br><b>smoke saw that I was awake, I scared it, and it went into reverse
and</b>
<br><b>disappeared. At the same time it was doing that, a thought came
into my head</b>
<br><b>right away "This is my daily check, no she saw me". What do you
make of</b>
<br><b>this? My father died in 1983, do you think that could of been him,
and if it</b>
<br><b>was, why couldn't I feel that it was him? I still get feelings,
sometimes</b>
<br><b>they leave me very uncomfortable. If this is happening to me, how
do I get</b>
<br><b>rid of it? Its not like I was asking all of this to happen to me.
I would</b>
<br><b>like to live my life like every other human being, and not feel
these</b>
<br><b>things. This is so not practicle for me.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Thank you...</b><b></b>

<br><b>Evil Eye</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: meecho2@juno.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Over the years, I've been told by several psychics&nbsp; I've seen
(regarding</b>
<br><b>my crazy life) that I have an evil spirit in my house, that I have
bad</b>
<br><b>luck, &amp; that I was given the "evil eye" as a child.</b>
<br><b>Indeed, my life has been horrible, with most things turning negative,</b>
<br><b>people turning against me, crazy timing, negative synchronicity,
machines</b>
<br><b>going haywire, deluges of cold rain suddenly pouring down on me...
you</b>
<br><b>name it. (Though I've never experienced dangerous voices nor</b>
<br><b>molestation; in fact, I've experienced sort of a special protection
from</b>
<br><b>dangerous phenomena, such as protection from potential criminals
or car</b>
<br><b>accidents.)</b>
<br><b>In the past, though, I've had scares from dogs, &amp; more recently
I'd get</b>
<br><b>the feeling that flocks of crows would hang around the house cawing,
and</b>
<br><b>every so often the toilet plumbing makes these flushing noises.</b>
<br><b>Have either of you ever heard from others regarding any of the above?
Is</b>
<br><b>there a solution for someone like me?Because I'm like a guinea pig
on a</b>
<br><b>treadmill, constantly running in place &amp; getting nowhere fast.
I'm tired</b>
<br><b>of being a guinea pig, &amp; I've reached the point where I've chosen
to</b>
<br><b>remain a passive pawn rather than an active pawn. That way I buffer</b>
<br><b>myself from being a "yo-yo". BTW, I also have fibromyalgia since</b>
<br><b>childhood, &amp; I'm close to 40. Though I dx'ed myself, I got my
"offical"</b>
<br><b>diagnosis about 10 years ago.</b>
<br><b>Note that the above doesn't even begin to express the stress that
my life</b>
<br><b>has been. There has been at least one psychic who seemed scared
to get</b>
<br><b>near me, probably realizing that he'd have to absorb my experiences
which</b>
<br><b>would be too overwhelming to handle.</b>

<p><b>My Shoppe Spirit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dsyll@pacbell.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>For the last year very unusual things have been happening, especially
on photos. Pictures taken of me or by me have orbs or lights in them and
we had the photos checked out and asked Fuji, the maker of our digital
camera, what could the problems be and were told none of the lights or
orbs were problematic of the camera or the photo, not lens flare, not "dust",
just orbs. Through some investigative work I found out that these "orbs"
might just be spirits or energy. So, I have been on an interesting journey
this year of orb or spirit hunting.</b>
<br><b>My girlfriend and I go to cemetaries at dusk and follow all rules
and regulations for a successful shooting and I have thousands of photos
of orbs, but am always looking for something different, be it vortexes
or mist, ectoplasm... Anyway. Last Friday, my friend and I went to three
old cemetaries here in our area. She used her 35mm camera and I my digital
camera. After about an hour of filming we came to my place of business,
a little shoppe in a very old Victorian building in an older Victorian
town, to download my digital photos, by now it was around 9:00 PM.</b>
<br><b>After we started downloading the photos we began to hear things
here in the shoppe, but I have gotten so used to the creaks and growns
of this old building that I just throw it off. As we downloaded the photos
of the cemetaries, more noises started happening. Through the side glass
window where the outdoor stairs are we heard what sounded like footsteps
going up the stairs, yet we could see through the window that there was
noone there. My friend, Sandy, was starting to get a little nervous and
I just kiddingly said it was probably just the Lady in White, but all in
jest. (We use that name because about a year ago, on a beautiful sunny
afternoon, Sandy said she went into the back room - where I have a cute
setup of white wicker furniture for customers to sit and rest - and she
said she saw something. She said she saw a transparent figure of a woman,
a young woman, in an older style high necked long white dress from the
Victorian era, with her brown hair styled in a soft bun, Victorian style
on top of her head, and she was looking wistfully, almost sadly, out the
window. So whenever I hear noises in the shoppe I talk to the Lady in White
and just assume, even if jokingly, its her.) Anyway, after a few minutes
of more downloading photos, we heard noise upstairs, like someone walking
around in the floor above us, and yet I knew there was noone there. I started
to get a little nervous and my friend and I decided to just finish downloading
quickly and leave. Then, in our back sitting room about 20 feet away, we
both heard what sounded like someone sitting down on the wicker furniture,
the wicker creaked, a looong creak .... Sandy and I just said time to go!
And then there was a quick creak, like someone getting up from the chair.</b>
<br><b>We shut down the computer and we proceeded to leave, but I went
towards the back room and suddenly felt a little chill. I remarked to Sandy
how odd that it felt chilly considering how warm it was today. Our shoppe
is inside a larger building, so it's pretty heat contained. Sandy walked
towards me to feel the air and she almost fell back because living in a
house herself that is pretty active with her own relative spirits she recognized
the coldness in the air. I was startled by her action and looked curiously
at her, at that point the coldest wind, icy chill started to envelope us,
it was almost like it was rushing AT us! I don't remember how but what
I remember next was standing outside the front door to the shoppe slamming
the door trying to find the right key to lock it, but I couldn't find it,
I was shaking sooooo bad and soooo cold! The back of my head was tingling
from the cold, my hair litterally standing on end!! My whole back of my
body felt like something icey just latched onto me! Sandy tried to help
me calm down so we could get the door locked and leave, and she put her
hand on my back and she shakingly exclaimed "My God your hair is ice cold!"
We locked the door and quickly went to the car. She then looked up to the
2nd floor of the building and was surprised to see noone there. We knew
it had to be a spirit, a ghost!</b>
<br><b>Now I have felt cold spots before, there was one other time a few
months ago in my shoppe that I felt a chill on my leg, like my leg was
being iced, and I took a digital photo and found there was an orb in the
area I was sitting. I have even seen orbs with my own eyes, but I have
NEVER felt a cold like this. It was colder than a freezer chill, it was
like the icy cold from dry ice! But then after that incredible occurance,
one people like us wait for, we couldn't believe we didn't use our cameras
which we both had in our hands at the time!!! That's how shocked and scared
we were!! Some ghosthunters we are!</b>
<br><b>I am writing from that exact same room of my shoppe. It is daytime
and sunny and beautiful in here... at this moment anyway. The feeling I
had that night, just two nights ago, was that it was nighttime and the
nighttime was her time to roam and feel free, and that she felt we were
infringing on her space. I can feel her presence during the day and it
has always been warm and kind. I also feel like someone is behind me, watching
me. But it doesn't scare me. But this energy Friday night was very strong
and pushy, I mean it rushed into us, like whooosh! pushing us out! I'll
never forget it. It was so unbelievable, so wonderfully scarey!!!!</b>
<br><b>We had her 35mm film developed and we got some wonderful photos
of mists... one photo is dark and nothing on it, but on the 2nd comparison
shot, in the exact same spot, mist or ectoplasm shows up! Beautiful shots!
I still can't believe we didn't get one inside my shoppe that night! Oh
well, one can only hope our spirit will show up again.. some night when
I'm brave enough to come back to my shoppe late in the night! Not yet anyway.
I will and I will let you all know what happens!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Mobile Home Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: HillbillyL4u@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>One day when we lived in our old mobile home. I told the kids to
go to bed</b>
<br><b>and they all went to bed. I went to bed and was laying there just
thinking</b>
<br><b>and looking down the hallway where you could see a light shining
on the wall.</b>
<br><b>I left the light on for the kids. I guess I had been there about
20 or 30</b>
<br><b>minutes when I could see shadows on the wall more than one and I
also heard</b>
<br><b>giggling. I thought the kids up out of bed. I went to check and
they were all</b>
<br><b>sound asleep. Never saw it again we soon moved.</b>
<br><b>After buying our new doublewide we had it put on the property. After
doing so</b>
<br><b>I heard our neighbor say that the old man that owned the property
had got</b>
<br><b>drunk and burnt up in his trailer.&nbsp; Well I never thought any
more about it</b>
<br><b>til on the day the power company turned on our power. That same
night about 1</b>
<br><b>in the morning it burnt to the ground. I was so scared. Afraid of
moving</b>
<br><b>another home here. But we did and haven't had anymore problems since.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Personal Experinece</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: RZADCABS@2mardiv.usmc.mil</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; The days within north county, st. louis can be very cloudy
with a slight</b>
<br><b>wind during the middle season of spring.&nbsp; The days are a little
longer then</b>
<br><b>that of winter yet have a little less activity outside with kids
then there</b>
<br><b>is during those humid summer days.&nbsp; I was fourteen years old
yet still in 8</b>
<br><b>grade at the time.&nbsp; There was little more than 7-9 weeks till
graduation.</b>
<br><b>This day was late one monday in which I would have the most unresting</b>
<br><b>experience of my life as of yet.&nbsp; Never in my life had I experienced
the</b>
<br><b>supernatural or yet been aware of any such existance.&nbsp; So this
was rather a</b>
<br><b>new beginning to such an experience and the only experience I've
had in my</b>
<br><b>life as of yet.&nbsp; My friends name was david peoples.&nbsp; He
lived about 1 mile</b>
<br><b>from my house across a major road called parker road located in
black jack</b>
<br><b>city.&nbsp; He also went to the same school as I, so we were pretty
close friends</b>
<br><b>hanging out alot of the time with eachother.&nbsp; On this particular
day, a</b>
<br><b>school day, I went home after school let out.&nbsp; My dad drove
me there with</b>
<br><b>his old blue ford van.&nbsp; Upon arriving home, I changed my school
uniform into</b>
<br><b>my occasional shorts and short sleeve shirt.&nbsp; I cleaned up
a little and did</b>
<br><b>alittle homework... I knew that I would have enough time to go outside
(up</b>
<br><b>the hill) so that I could hang out before it got dark.&nbsp; Now
I'll describe</b>
<br><b>the local environment.&nbsp; I'm slavic yet I live in a neighborhood
that is 75%</b>
<br><b>black, they consider me white but that doesn't really matter, except
that I</b>
<br><b>have no bios towards color since I'm of different origin then that
of</b>
<br><b>caucasions and africans and americans.&nbsp; David is black... furthermore
the</b>
<br><b>surrounding community is greatly trees and hills.&nbsp; This happened
back in</b>
<br><b>1994, so by now there could have been some changes but back then,
I was able</b>
<br><b>to explore miles of woods and old houses abandoned and unknown way
back in</b>
<br><b>the woods.&nbsp; To give a good description on house located back
behind my back</b>
<br><b>yard which is bordered by heavy woods and long fields (untouched
by humans)</b>
<br><b>looks just like the house the blair witch lived in.&nbsp; I was
11 when I</b>
<br><b>discovered it, and found some old bow and arrows contained in the
basement.</b>
<br><b>Well, there are hills&nbsp; around that area, so hilly that you
would look out at</b>
<br><b>some points and see everything or be at the bottem and see nothing.&nbsp;
So you</b>
<br><b>can understand that throughout the neighborhood that I lived in
there is</b>
<br><b>woods around everyhouse and far back, along with old abandoned hunting</b>
<br><b>houses, farm houses, shacks, treehouses used back in the early 1900's.</b>
<br><b>Shortley after I changed my cloths, ate, cleaned up and did a little</b>
<br><b>homework... I went to my friends daves house to hang out.&nbsp;
Upon getting</b>
<br><b>there I rang the door bell about 5 times till he answered.&nbsp;
Apparently</b>
<br><b>sleeping since after school.&nbsp; So I went inside and down into
his basement.</b>
<br><b>I haven't been around in his house all that long to look around
but soon saw</b>
<br><b>the ninja equipment he had.&nbsp; Stars, nunchucks, bo, etc.&nbsp;
He claimed before</b>
<br><b>numorous times about him being a great and powerful ninja in which
he knew</b>
<br><b>80 different ways upon the second that he could kill me in the spot.&nbsp;
To</b>
<br><b>prove himself he demonstrated much of his skill to me through doing
flips,</b>
<br><b>throwing stars and knowledge.&nbsp; Like he hit me in the chest
just the</b>
<br><b>slightest bit with his palm to my heart, by simply thrusting it
forward an</b>
<br><b>inch.&nbsp; It caused my heart to skip 3 beats.&nbsp; He even claimed
that he could</b>
<br><b>rip the heart out of someone running at him, like literally puncturing
the</b>
<br><b>ribcage with his hand- reaching in and pulling out the victims heart.&nbsp;
Later</b>
<br><b>he claimed his sensai (teacher) showed him how to see the portals
of hell.</b>
<br><b>He described to me how hell looked like a cave deep under water.&nbsp;
Instead of</b>
<br><b>glowing with algae it was lighted by the heat coming from the walls
of the</b>
<br><b>cave, and it was glowing.&nbsp; He indicated that spirits would
just have</b>
<br><b>presence there unaimously floating around.&nbsp; While lucifer was
not there,</b>
<br><b>there were spirits that had really no shape but existed as a cloud
of smoke-</b>
<br><b>that could take shape.&nbsp; I sat there thinking that this guy
who amazingly</b>
<br><b>demonstrated his skills of ninja to me was playing me with these
stories.</b>
<br><b>He showed me around his house, there was nobody there, except his
140 pound</b>
<br><b>dog chained and fenced in the back.&nbsp; I looked down and saw
a sword that</b>
<br><b>looked old as antique and marvelous to be a kings.&nbsp; I picked
it up from its</b>
<br><b>placement, immediately being told that it was cursed.&nbsp; David
said that in</b>
<br><b>order to down the curse I would have to say the hail mary 3 times.&nbsp;
I did</b>
<br><b>that and left the sword where it was.&nbsp; He showed me his room
and basement</b>
<br><b>where all his weapons of mass destruction were and soon I looked
at the</b>
<br><b>clock.&nbsp; 5:55, damn it's getting late, soon we'll have little
then 2 hours of</b>
<br><b>day light left and I'll have to go home.&nbsp;&nbsp; I went towards
his kitchen while</b>
<br><b>I was in the back storage room to get something to eat when I saw
a box that</b>
<br><b>had the words ouija board.&nbsp; I indicated to dave that I've never
used one</b>
<br><b>before but believed the game to be a fake.&nbsp; I looked on the
board and it</b>
<br><b>said it was made in 1984.&nbsp; David indicated that boards were
not blessed till</b>
<br><b>1988 so that if we used it it would possibly do bad damage rather
then good.</b>
<br><b>That would not become a factor till later, but I told him that I
didn't</b>
<br><b>believe it and that drove him to want to do it in order to prove
to me that</b>
<br><b>it worked.&nbsp; He indicated that first we needed a place, he knew
of one.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>place we had to go to took us through the back woods, at one time
we crossed</b>
<br><b>a backyard to some old store and there was a barrall with two large
massive</b>
<br><b>sticks in it.&nbsp; It was burned in the middle and there was a
rack behind it as</b>
<br><b>if it were used to tortore.&nbsp; David indicated that there was
a local devil</b>
<br><b>worshiping cult that used this place for worshiping services and
sacrifices.</b>
<br><b>That freaked me out so I said lets get the f**k out of here.&nbsp;
We skailed the</b>
<br><b>8 foot fence that surrounded us and we climbed down a 15 foot drop.&nbsp;
Soon we</b>
<br><b>reached a trail that other kids used in the deep backwoods to walk
around or</b>
<br><b>smoke at.&nbsp; Soon we left the trail and went through some thick
weed into an</b>
<br><b>opening of 30' by 40' . In that opening was a shack that was half
hanging</b>
<br><b>over, but still up enough to were you could climb in and stand in
it.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was about 15' across and 10 wide and 8 feet tall.&nbsp; You could
almost kick it</b>
<br><b>and it would fall apart, but rather it was sturdier than I expected.&nbsp;
We sat</b>
<br><b>down in indian sitting position with out knee's touching so that
the board</b>
<br><b>would touch both our legs.&nbsp; We both touched the eye piece with
two fingers</b>
<br><b>each.&nbsp; Something was moving it!&nbsp; I looked at him and said,
hey your freaking</b>
<br><b>moving it, stop shitting me.&nbsp; He replied that he wasn't and
he took off his</b>
<br><b>fingers and still it moved.&nbsp; I sat there wondering in total
amazement- what</b>
<br><b>the hell.?.&nbsp; Dave said that we have to chant or say an opening
prayer to</b>
<br><b>allow the device to spell something out for us.&nbsp; He proceeded
to say some</b>
<br><b>type of prayer.&nbsp; I only could recall a few parts, but this
is how it went...</b>
<br><b>God, mother, son.&nbsp; we call upon you as your servants.&nbsp;
give us the power to</b>
<br><b>communicate with the souls under your command....we love and suffer
for your</b>
<br><b>will, amen.</b>
<br><b>... is all the middle that I could not remember, that part of the
prayer was</b>
<br><b>directed to calling upon the spirits for us to hear them.</b>
<br><b>At that time, the air started to feel chilly, and the sun was looking
to</b>
<br><b>take it's dip into the sea.&nbsp; He proceeded to call out questions
one at a</b>
<br><b>time.&nbsp; The first question was this.</b>
<br><b>Are there any spirits present with us now at this time that are
willing to</b>
<br><b>give us necessary information?&nbsp; We waited for approximately
2 minutes when</b>
<br><b>the eye piece started to move (much to my amazement).&nbsp; It spelled
out yes.</b>
<br><b>Are you good or bad?&nbsp; Bad.</b>
<br><b>What's your name? Satan</b>
<br><b>right then I said satan like the cloth, and dave said satan like
lucifer.</b>
<br><b>As I stood corrected I sat there trying not to believe that this
was</b>
<br><b>happening.</b>
<br><b>What is your real name? Bob</b>
<br><b>that relieved me a little, but we had to keep questioning...</b>
<br><b>How were you killed? Swordpoint</b>
<br><b>Around what time? 12:00</b>
<br><b>No around what year? 1530</b>
<br><b>by then it was enough to freak me out and alot of time had passed
during</b>
<br><b>each question and the sun was actually half way dipping into the
sea in the</b>
<br><b>distance.&nbsp; I got up and while I was turning around I felt a
cold funnel</b>
<br><b>right behind me just by the swoshing of my hand.&nbsp; By then the
temperature</b>
<br><b>was about 77 degrees.&nbsp; I felt below and above and felt the
same thing.&nbsp; Like</b>
<br><b>77 to 20 degrees in a matter of inches.&nbsp; It seems to cover
a circle area in</b>
<br><b>diameter of 10 inches.&nbsp; It was like a portal of cold air going
up into the</b>
<br><b>sky and into the ground to hell.&nbsp; ( later I would recall this
as a portal in</b>
<br><b>which the spirits used to get to that particular spot.)</b>
<br><b>So there we were, almost dark walking real fast to get back out
of the woods</b>
<br><b>before dark or suffer being lost in the woods.&nbsp; While we were
on the way</b>
<br><b>back we occasionally glanced back as if someone were following us.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Due to</b>
<br><b>the wind blowing the leaves on the ground behind us we didn't think
much of</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; I just kept asking what the situation was about with the
answers we</b>
<br><b>got.&nbsp; So We got back to his house and still nobody was home.&nbsp;
No cars, no</b>
<br><b>people, doors locked and things were still as they were as we left
them.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>put the game downstairs with the rest of his stuff at the back of
the</b>
<br><b>basement on his bed and I went down to stay with him a little.&nbsp;
Now this is</b>
<br><b>where it all started...&nbsp; about 5 minutes later we heard the
basement door</b>
<br><b>slam.&nbsp; now to describe the stairwell going into the basement.&nbsp;
The staircase</b>
<br><b>turns halfway along with the wall at the very corner of the basement.&nbsp;
So</b>
<br><b>the one end of the staircase is the entire concrete wall of the
basement and</b>
<br><b>the other is dryboard.&nbsp; So to go upstairs you'll have to go
up&nbsp; steps-turn</b>
<br><b>and proceed up... then there is a door there, and then the door
for the</b>
<br><b>backyard is perpendicular to that.&nbsp; So if you open one you'll
bang it into</b>
<br><b>the other.&nbsp; We had it open (basement door) when it slammed
close the first</b>
<br><b>time.&nbsp; So we just figured it to be his parents.&nbsp; He called
out, no reply.</b>
<br><b>We went upstairs to look around, nothing.&nbsp; I searched every
single room</b>
<br><b>along with him.&nbsp; still nothing.&nbsp; Then there were no cars
and even dave</b>
<br><b>seemed amazed cause he kept yelling out for whoever it was.&nbsp;
but nothing.</b>
<br><b>So we suspected nothing and gave up.&nbsp; upon going downstairs
again we talked</b>
<br><b>for about 2 more minutes when we heard an even louder bang from
the basement</b>
<br><b>door.&nbsp; This time it was from the backdoor banging into the
basement door.</b>
<br><b>So he called out and no answer.&nbsp; We suspected intruders in
his house- so he</b>
<br><b>grabbed his si's and I grabbed a 32" double bladed sword.&nbsp;
Then I got really</b>
<br><b>scared knowing that again there was nobody up there and the door
that was</b>
<br><b>opened was locked by ME before we went down.&nbsp; Still no cars
and the dog</b>
<br><b>wasn't acting up either.&nbsp; I got serious and said that this
is unusual and</b>
<br><b>that maybe we should call the police.&nbsp; Then I took back my
comment when I</b>
<br><b>figured it would just make us look stupid.&nbsp; Plus there wasn't
really any</b>
<br><b>damage or anything stolen.&nbsp; Again after time we gave up and
this time we</b>
<br><b>propted a chair under the backdoor along with locking it.&nbsp;
searched the</b>
<br><b>house again including closets and showers, cubburts everything.&nbsp;
I left the</b>
<br><b>basement door open and sat at the turn of the stairs so I could
see what it</b>
<br><b>was that was slamming that damn door of his.&nbsp; I looked out
the basement</b>
<br><b>window and saw no cars on the driveway.&nbsp; Then I looked up and
still saw</b>
<br><b>nothing but as I looked the door of the basement slammed close so
hard it</b>
<br><b>knocked the bolting out of the door handle.&nbsp; I heard another
loud noise of</b>
<br><b>some kind and later would recognize that as the chair flying against
the</b>
<br><b>wall and the other door slammed against the basement door so hard
it left a</b>
<br><b>half dented hole of the door knob in the basement door.&nbsp; It
told me right</b>
<br><b>there to get the fuck out of the house and have a weapon as I go.&nbsp;
So I</b>
<br><b>grabbed the sword, dave grabbed his stuff and debated going up.&nbsp;
I went</b>
<br><b>first and immediately left the house with only 3 steps.&nbsp; He
was behind me,</b>
<br><b>this time the dog was barking and acting crazy when we got outside
and still</b>
<br><b>there was no cars and nobody around to indicate a person done this.&nbsp;
Plus</b>
<br><b>the fact that its impossible the way the door was knocked in due
to it being</b>
<br><b>locked and pressed close from the inside by the chair.&nbsp; I decided
then that</b>
<br><b>I needed to go home and he went to will andress's house down the
street.&nbsp; On</b>
<br><b>the way home I felt the presence but didn't give it much concern.&nbsp;
I stopped</b>
<br><b>at my girlfriends house (katie rodes)&nbsp; she was not home so
being desperate,</b>
<br><b>I ran home to lose whatever I felt was following me and told my
mom what was</b>
<br><b>happening.&nbsp; She was watching tv and didn't give it that much
concern.</b>
<br><b>Basically she didn't believe the details of the story so far or</b>
<br><b>circumstances.&nbsp; I went to sit in my room afraid of what was
going on.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>looked out my window which was adjacent to a pine tree outside.&nbsp;
I sat there</b>
<br><b>totally stunned at the presence that was before me.&nbsp; Right
next to the pine</b>
<br><b>tree which was 7 feet from my window was some type of cloud of smoke.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>outline of it was golden with electricity.&nbsp; Like if you ever
lite a paper on</b>
<br><b>fire and seen the paper burn back on itself the part that burns
has that</b>
<br><b>line of glowing to it, it also could be compared to a string of
light, or</b>
<br><b>lightning.&nbsp; I personally would refer to it as smoke with a
line of energy</b>
<br><b>going around it.&nbsp; I had a studio set up for light in my room
and attempted</b>
<br><b>to turn off and on the lights to make sure it was not a glare.&nbsp;
I dared</b>
<br><b>didn't go to the window for the fear of it.&nbsp; After much desperate</b>
<br><b>experimentation I eventually found that image I saw to be realistic.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>freaked out and ran to my mom once more explaining my situation.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>listened to me for some time and explained that the image I saw
was a</b>
<br><b>figment of my imagination and that my friend david may have possibly
played</b>
<br><b>a trick on me.&nbsp; I went back into my bedroom to find the image
not there</b>
<br><b>anymore, to my relief, I closed the window for it was fully dark
outside.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>layed on my bed thinking about the freakyness that surrounded me.&nbsp;
Like</b>
<br><b>earlier that year I saw the movie "communion" on tv.&nbsp; I read
the book when I</b>
<br><b>was 11, so it totally scared the fuck out of me when I thought about
the</b>
<br><b>circumstances if that story or movie was true that I may be encountering.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>feared my life at that point and I just layed there on my bed as&nbsp;
flat as a</b>
<br><b>board, occasionally under paranoia checking the sides incase some&nbsp;
"alien"</b>
<br><b>was there.&nbsp; Then the phone rang in my mom's bedroom and about
2 minutes</b>
<br><b>later she called me to her room and told me the situation.&nbsp;
The phone was on</b>
<br><b>hold at the time and she told me it was david peoples parents asking
for me.</b>
<br><b>My mom indicated that they were very mad and that alot of bad things
was</b>
<br><b>going on at the moment.&nbsp; I just looked at her blankly not knowing
what to</b>
<br><b>say.&nbsp; So she talked to mrs. peoples again to see what the problem
was.&nbsp; Then</b>
<br><b>my mom said that she wanted to know what inspired me to conjure
spirits from</b>
<br><b>the dead on an unblessed ouija board.&nbsp; I told my mom that I
would take the</b>
<br><b>call and not to worry about it.&nbsp; At the point I was bringing
the phone to my</b>
<br><b>ear I could hear noise of dave's sister yelling and his mom started
to talk</b>
<br><b>to me frantically, saying that her house was getting all messed
up due to</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; I explained to her that dave was the one who went about
the sayings and</b>
<br><b>that that was the first time I ever done that.&nbsp; She half pissed
said that</b>
<br><b>what we did was call out evil spirits from the underworld or wherever
and</b>
<br><b>that they were in her house destroying it at the moment.&nbsp; I
freaked and hung</b>
<br><b>up on her under pretences that one of the spirits had followed me
to my</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; I told my mom the situation and she just sat there
looking blanked</b>
<br><b>as I was when I saw the presence outside my window.&nbsp; Immediately,
the phone</b>
<br><b>rang again and I answered it was dave.&nbsp; He went on to tell
me that his</b>
<br><b>family was staying over at the andress's house and that he would
talk to me</b>
<br><b>in the morrow at school about the whole situation and not to worry
about his</b>
<br><b>parents or sister.&nbsp; I just went back to my room under intense
security for</b>
<br><b>myself, bat at hand and tried to sleep with the light on all night
long.</b>
<br><b>The next day at school I met with dave and he proceeded to explain
to me the</b>
<br><b>situation.&nbsp; Their family already had a priest coming up that
friday to expel</b>
<br><b>the spirits and to bless the house and to take the ouija board.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>explained what happened when his family got home.&nbsp; He said
that he returned</b>
<br><b>to his house after a couple hours to find his family halfway freaked
out.</b>
<br><b>His dad was in the basement drinking a beer watching tv when 3 figures
that</b>
<br><b>were gray in color, transparent and had a glowing outline- under
his</b>
<br><b>discription, walking like zombies but with their arms down, they
walked in a</b>
<br><b>straight row right in between him and the tv.&nbsp; He freaked out
and threw his</b>
<br><b>beer at them and they began to dissolve under his discription into
the</b>
<br><b>ground.&nbsp; Like they just sunk right into the ground.&nbsp; Then
he ran upstairs to</b>
<br><b>get the rest of the family.&nbsp; His family was already wondering
what happened</b>
<br><b>because dave wasn't home and the damage to the wall and door was
there.&nbsp; Yet</b>
<br><b>strange things happen all the time so they didn't do anything about
the</b>
<br><b>fact.&nbsp; Nothing was stolen and dave usually stays out till late.&nbsp;
Dave came</b>
<br><b>back and went into his room only to be locked in it.&nbsp; He had
to kick his</b>
<br><b>door down as soon as he went into the living room his own tournament</b>
<br><b>trophies were flying to him.&nbsp; As if the actual spirit threw
them at him.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>took him and his family no time to call me up and find out what
happened and</b>
<br><b>to then get out of that house.</b>
<br><b>Later we tried to tell the teacher what happened but even she didn't
believe</b>
<br><b>us due to the fact that we were "children" and yet the story sounded</b>
<br><b>fictitious.&nbsp; I wanted to see what happened to daves house.&nbsp;
He warned me</b>
<br><b>though that the spirits still resided at his house to the present
day and</b>
<br><b>that even he can't go into it.&nbsp; I didn't want the spirits to
know that I was</b>
<br><b>present when we called them nor did I want them to follow me to
my house.</b>
<br><b>It would only make the problem bigger.&nbsp; So at a distance I
saw his house,</b>
<br><b>there were a couple windows broken along with doors open and I could
see</b>
<br><b>things all around.&nbsp; I would feel extremely sorry for the robber
who decides</b>
<br><b>that house is primary to be robbed.&nbsp; Well, all in all I really
never talked</b>
<br><b>about it to people but on occasion.&nbsp; Like I would tell my friends
and kids</b>
<br><b>at summer camp and scare the bejesus out of them.&nbsp; I looked
back and studied</b>
<br><b>the experience and realized this:&nbsp; the board we had was quite
old so was not</b>
<br><b>blessed and that aloud the evil spirits to be called.&nbsp; The
3 times the door</b>
<br><b>slammed was the actual spirits coming into the house.&nbsp; I suspect
the first</b>
<br><b>slam the backdoor closed after being opened.&nbsp; The spirit that
followed me</b>
<br><b>home was a good spirit there to look over me, while the 3 remained
in his</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; Later his house was restored and the priest came that
monday, not</b>
<br><b>friday.&nbsp; Since then I graduated and rarely if never talked
to dave again</b>
<br><b>about the experience, yet I did mark it down as something that I
wouldn't</b>
<br><b>ever run across again or in a while.&nbsp; I tried using the ouija
board again by</b>
<br><b>myself a few years later, but was never successful at it.&nbsp;
My religious</b>
<br><b>beliefs were unchanged by the experience yet my whole attitude on
the world</b>
<br><b>changed significantly.&nbsp; Not that I am different since but rather
every</b>
<br><b>situation I become different in attitude towards then everyone else.&nbsp;
This</b>
<br><b>experience, story, documentary I tell you is as close to the truth
as I can</b>
<br><b>recall, for it has been nearly 7 years since then.&nbsp; All I can
do is warn</b>
<br><b>others that the main intent of the spirits were to destroy and to
cause</b>
<br><b>evil.&nbsp; To hurt and cause damage to a desent family.&nbsp; If
you ever live out</b>
<br><b>your life, live it to the basis that you don't deny yourself but
also that</b>
<br><b>you don't deny god.&nbsp; God does exist, he loves and is rightous.&nbsp;
Live "as</b>
<br><b>yourself" and you will exist as god loves you and you will be a
good spirit</b>
<br><b>in the end.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Little Prizi's Visits</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SoMfan1@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been having a fantastic little visitor jumping
on my bed at night</b>
<br><b>and walking up to my back.&nbsp; I know who it is.&nbsp; It's my
toy poodle, Aapri.</b>
<br><b>She died two years ago and ever since my father has allowed me to
get a cat,</b>
<br><b>"Prizi" has returned.&nbsp; At first, I noticed a small shadow like
cloud walking</b>
<br><b>against the wall in my home.&nbsp; Pri in her later life was blind
and she</b>
<br><b>literally used the walls to guide herself to and fro.&nbsp; What
was most</b>
<br><b>fascinating to me was that my new cat, Sassy, was laying on the
floor not far</b>
<br><b>from one of Pri's sleeping areas.&nbsp; From the corner of my eye
I saw the dark</b>
<br><b>cloud, very small and floating against the wall.&nbsp; At the same
moment, Sassy</b>
<br><b>turned her head in the same direction and we both watched it for
a few</b>
<br><b>seconds before it vanished.&nbsp; Later on, I noticed Sassy playing
and staring at</b>
<br><b>nothing that sometimes resulted in me catching the verticle blinds
shuffling</b>
<br><b>slightly in the livingroom while Sassy was right by me.&nbsp; I
still hear the</b>
<br><b>occasional "bump" in the night that we usually heard when poor little
Pri</b>
<br><b>would bump her head on the wall when she couldn't see her way.&nbsp;
Now, Pri has</b>
<br><b>taken it a bit further.&nbsp; My cat will lay on the bed with me
at times, but</b>
<br><b>when it's time to go to bed, she goes into her own little room since
she's</b>
<br><b>too playful at night and won't let me sleep.&nbsp; Pri now jumps
on my bed during</b>
<br><b>the evening while I'm very still.&nbsp; I am awake, too by the way.&nbsp;
I feel her</b>
<br><b>little paws walk over to me, but only once I thought I felt her
pressed up</b>
<br><b>against me.&nbsp; I'm not sure.&nbsp; I talk to her.&nbsp; I tell
her, "Hello Prizi, lay</b>
<br><b>down."&nbsp; It's happened twice now and everytime I welcome it.&nbsp;
She was 15 when</b>
<br><b>she died.</b>

<br><b>Conn. Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: priddle@snet.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Jay , and I live in a small&nbsp; in the state of Connecticut.&nbsp;
I am 18 years old.&nbsp; Everything I write here is true.&nbsp; Nothing
is second hand.&nbsp; All of these instances occurred when sober.</b>
<br><b>The majority of my town is haunted.&nbsp; It's getting out of control.&nbsp;
My friend is more sensetive to energy than I am, and he can see things
I can't.&nbsp; I may feel a spirit is nearby - I can tell whether it is
friendly, or not.&nbsp; He, however, can see them.</b>
<br><b>He has had encounters with our friends from the "other-side" for
most of his life.&nbsp; But, I haven't had these encounters until after
New Year's of 2001.</b>
<br><b>I believe the paranormal activity in our town has heightened since
the year has changed.&nbsp; Our schools are built on Indian massacre grounds,
our homes on Indian burial grounds, and our backyards on sacred walking
paths.&nbsp; There have been train accidents, floods that have killed hundreds
by the river, and the people in our town behave strangly.&nbsp; The negative
energy is interfering with life in this town.</b>
<br><b>I was in Indian Wells park with a friend, which is down by the river.&nbsp;
Train tracks pass through, but there hasn't been a passenger train through
there since the civil war.</b>
<br><b>There was a horrible train accident in the late 1800's there, killing
the entire crew of the train.&nbsp; In the early 1900's, a child drown
in the river there.&nbsp; Around that same time, 3 children were hit by
a train while playing jax on the tracks.&nbsp; Down the road is an Indian
burial ground and a spot where hundreds died from a horrible flood.</b>
<br><b>As I was saying... while in Indian Wells park around 4AM, we noticed
a man in shimmerring white waving, as if trying to direct our attention.&nbsp;
Out of the dark came fireworks (silent lights) shooting from the tracks
towards us.&nbsp; All of a sudden, a diamond shape of lights shown towards
us and a train appeared out of the air.&nbsp; It was silent; a ghost train.&nbsp;
It was a steam engine with passenger cars attached.&nbsp; It floated by
and out of site.</b>
<br><b>Soon, our cup holders began to go in and out of the slots, the windows
roled up and down, and we decided it was a good time to leave.</b>
<br><b>There was something in the car with us.&nbsp; My friend felt something
trying to get into his chest.&nbsp; We havn't been back since.&nbsp; He
has been clensed of this spirit since.</b>
<br><b>My car still attracts spirits, and usually sage seems to do the
trick in getting them to move out.&nbsp; Otherwise, my doors mysteriously
lock in a matter of minutes after unlocking, the child locks turn on by
themselves.&nbsp; What scares me, is this isn't electronic equipment in
my car - something more powerful is moving the mechanical objects.</b>
<br><b>We have had about 8 different spirits, that we noticed, enter and
leave my car at different times this year.&nbsp; Some evil, some sad, some
kind and gentle.</b>
<br><b>Things levetate in my car, CD's fastforward randomly, and figures
can be seen in my back seat by others when I am in the car ALONE.</b>
<br><b>The week of April 23rd has bothered me.&nbsp; An increase of paranormal
activity has been seen by myself and others.</b>
<br><b>We have been chased, thrown to the ground over an Indian massacre
ground (now a baseball field), and have had objects thrown at us.</b>
<br><b>They are everywhere - pool halls, bars (especially), homes, cars
- everywhere.</b>
<br><b>There must have been an alignment of the stars that week... the
Friday of that week was especially odd.&nbsp; Lights flickering, figures
moving past us, people appearing in the road and then dissapearing before
our eyes.&nbsp; This only seems to occur to my friend and I.&nbsp; We seem
to be the only ones who detect them.</b>
<br><b>We were at an old house of my friend's - empty; nobody living there
at the time.&nbsp; We went up stairs and I got a chill down my spine.&nbsp;
He yelled "Get the fuck out", and we ran out of the house.&nbsp; He stated
that since he was a child, there has always been one or two spirits in
that house - never giving off bad energy of any kind.&nbsp; That night,
around 2-3AM, he felt 5 spirits.&nbsp; The spirits that are usually there
always stay upstairs.&nbsp; This time, they began to work their way down
the steps.&nbsp; Luckily, they didn't follow us out of the house.</b>
<br><b>People don't seem to understand that spirits can latch themselves
on to objects, to people, and follow you anywhere they please.&nbsp; We
come across a lot of negative energy in this town.&nbsp; I have had 4 spirits
latched on to me at one point until I was cleansed.&nbsp; I have also learned
that sage is helpful in these situations, and invisioning yourself engulfed
in purple and white light will protect you for the most part.&nbsp; Ask
for guidance, and protection from the angels of light.</b>
<br><b>They are out there, and that week of April 23rd... a veil was lifted
so that we could see things that most people don't usually notice.&nbsp;
A doorway of some kind was opened that week, and there are a lot of lost
spirits wondering about in our town - needing guidance in to the light.</b>
<br><b>There are spirits in my friend's house.&nbsp; There used to be a
man named Hubbel in that house.&nbsp; He was tried for witch-craft, and
there is no record of his death, or tombstone.</b>
<br><b>There was also a mother and her child who died there too.&nbsp;
We feel their presence often.</b>
<br><b>Near my church are the old gallows where many people were hung.&nbsp;
This entire area is infested with supernatural activity.</b>
<br><b>It's amazing how much can happen in such a small town - but this
town has a lot of history, and a lot of terrible things took place.</b>
<br><b>I said earlier that I began to notice spirits around the beginning
of the year.&nbsp; This is when I completed my Reiki training (similar
to touch healing), and my intuition and spirituatliy has grown enormously.&nbsp;
But, at the same time, my energy seems to attract ghosts.</b>
<br><b>I think my friend and I have a lot of history in this town in a
past life.&nbsp; We have lived numerous past lives together, including
during the civil war.&nbsp; We expect to see some things at Gettysburg
- some startling things.</b>
<br><b>Let me know what you think about my town and my experiences - as
vague as they may sound at this time.</b>
<br><b>I would love to get in to furthur detail on this subject and find
out some more history on my town that could explain the paranormal activity.&nbsp;
Also, I intend to research the alignment of the stars and planets at this
current time, and especially the week of April 23rd.</b>

<br><b>Old Farm House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: PAWNGUY@INTELLEX.COM</b><b></b>
<p><b>Many years ago my parents purchased an old&nbsp; farm north of the
small town in eastern Oklahoma where I was raised.</b>
<br><b>The lady who had owned the farm previously was somewhat of a hermit
whom we suspected was not of sound mind.</b>
<br><b>The old farm house on the property was probably built around the
turn of the century and was quite dilapidated by the</b>
<br><b>time we got it. Over the next couple of years we cleaned it up and
dad had it fixed up to livable condition. All of us were</b>
<br><b>a little uncomfortable in the house but no one had ever had a frightening
experience.The house was never lived in by my family but was used as a
cabin with occasional overnight stays. When I&nbsp; was in my 20's and
single I</b>
<br><b>found myself without a place to stay due to selling my house. I
decided to stay at the farm until I could find another home.</b>
<br><b>I have never been an easily spooked person but some of the events
that occurred in the farm house left me somewhat shaken.</b>
<br><b>The first indication of anything strange was a week or so after
I moved in. I awoke from a sound sleep about 3:00 AM and found the house
extremely cold. The house had a fairly new Warm Morning gas heater which
my father had installed. I got up and found the pilot light out on the
heater and relit it. I went back to bed and slept through the night without
further incident. About 2 nights later the same thing occurred with the
heat going out between 2 and 3 AM. Once again I relit the heater and returned
to bed. After several occurrences of this I called a service man to check
the heater. He indicated that there was nothing obviously wrong with the
heater but he replace the thermocouple and pilot light anyway. About 2
nights later at about the same time I was awakened by noise from the living
room and it was extremely cold in the house. I got up and found that not
only was the heat off but the television in the same room was on and the
volume was very loud. I had owned this TV for about 2 years and never had
this occurred before. I relit the stove and turned off the TV and went
back to bed. About 4 or 5 nights later I was out late and did not return
home until about 1:00 AM. I parked and walked to the front door when I
noticed lights flickering in the house which I had left totally dark. I
also could hear voices coming from inside the house. I assumed someone
had broken in to the house. I picked up a board that was on the porch and
quickly opened the front door ready to do battle with whoever was in the
house. I was shocked to find that the voices were coming from the TV which
had been off when I left and the heat was off in the house. I called a
family member and told them I was coming to spend the night. I only stayed
at the house a few more nights after that. There was never any explanation
for the heater or the TV . I kept the TV for about 4 more years after leaving
the farm and it never turned itself on again after leaving the farm.</b>
<br><b>One other incident occurred at the same farm sometime later. I was
out in the yard after dark about 11:00 or 12:00 PM sitting at a picnic
table when I noticed a light in the woods on the other side of a ten acre
pasture next to the house. The light was traveling through the woods toward
the road which split the farm into two pieces. The light continued across
the road to the other side and disappeared into the woods. I didn't think
much about this as this area is full of coon hunters and night fishermen.
It was only the next day that it occurred to me that the light had remained
level with only a slight bobbing motion across two fences, a roadside drainage
ditch and an 8 foot deep wet weather creek bed! The light has never been
seen again by anyone who would admit it.The house was torn down several
years ago by the young couple that bought it. I always wondered if they
had similar experiences.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Unusual Happenings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ladywilde@mailcity.com</b>
<br><b>I have some stories to tell. It seems that all my life strange and
unusual happenings have occured when ever I was around. It might be intresting
to note that my grandmother is very physic and my father is to only to
a lesser degree. Though i would never begin to call myself a true phyisic
i would say that I am atleast " senstive" and very much so. My father would
love to explore old buildings and I would always go with him. There was
one house located somwhere in CT. I don't remember the actual location
for I was very young at the time around 8 or 9 and the house was old and
blue and falling apart. My father and I crawled through a window and as
soon as my father had set me down in the house. I got very very cold even
though it was the summer in in the 90's. My father told me not to move
and to say put while he looked around to make sure the house was safe.
I watched as he went upstairs and i stood there and started to shake. I
felt very cold still and almost sick to my stomache and I could feel something
tightening around my gut. Then I went and threw up out the window and started
calling for my dad. I wanted out of the house and i couldn't get out the
house without him since I was so little. My dad came running down the stairs
then, his face was very white and seemed disturbed.He just said " lets
go" and went to lift me out the window. He saw that I had gotten sick and
asked me if I was okay. As we walked away from the house I had the vague
feeling of being watched but the farther we got the bettr i felt. My dad
later told me that when he went up the 3rd floor there was a room at the
end of the hall that had a pentagram on the floor as well as the numbers
666 written all over the floor. My father told me that he had gotten almost
physical ill and suddenly very frightened for me though he felt like he
couldn't move. When he heard me call for him he was able to break out of
the trance that he felt and went to make sure I was alright. He said that
evil things have happened there and that we should not have gone in. That
was only the beginning and if anyone would like to speak to me personaly

<br><b>My Late Night Experience in Cheyenne, Wyoming</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Cadre500@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I can't honesty say I have ever "seen" a ghost but I wonder to this
day if I</b>
<br><b>didn't experience one.&nbsp; Back in the mid 1990's my husband and
I lived on Dey</b>
<br><b>Avenue, in Cheyenne, Wyoming (just north of Pershing Blvd. for those
of you</b>
<br><b>familiar with the area).&nbsp; F.E. Warren Air Force Base is just
west of there.</b>
<br><b>Our 2 bedroom house was built in 1929.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night
I was sound asleep and</b>
<br><b>woke for what seemed like no reason at all.&nbsp; I glanced at the
clock and</b>
<br><b>noticed it was in the wee hours of the morning.&nbsp; Even though
I had been sound</b>
<br><b>asleep I was now quite alert.&nbsp; Suddenly, I heard three footsteps
cross my</b>
<br><b>kitchen linoleum floor.&nbsp; They weren't particularly loud but
they were very</b>
<br><b>distinct.&nbsp; To the point that they I would describe them as
coming from a</b>
<br><b>heavy set male.&nbsp; They sounded just like my 240 lb. husband's
footsteps.&nbsp; In</b>
<br><b>my mind I am trying to make sense of what was going on.&nbsp; It
didn't take long</b>
<br><b>to realize that the sounds I heard couldn't possibly belong to my
husband,</b>
<br><b>since he was over 1000 miles away on a military trip and I was home
alone.</b>
<br><b>That was when I began to question whether I was actually hearing
something or</b>
<br><b>my mind was playing tricks with me.&nbsp; I only heard the three
footsteps,</b>
<br><b>nothing more.&nbsp; This all took place within a matter of about
3 seconds from</b>
<br><b>the time I awoke and I hadn't uttered a word.&nbsp; I decided my
mind was just</b>
<br><b>playing tricks with me and was trying to calm myself.&nbsp; Well,
I would have</b>
<br><b>dismissed and forgotten the entire incident if it were not for my
Rottweiler,</b>

<br><b>Living With Spirits</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was about 12 years old, I fell off of some 10-ft high baseball</b>
<br><b>bleachers.&nbsp; I was walking on the top and fell, knocking the
wind out of me,</b>
<br><b>and bruising my back.</b>
<br><b>Since that date, I have had the experiences of seeing and hearing
spirits</b>
<br><b>everywhere I go.</b>
<br><b>When I met my husband-to-be back in 1971, and was planning for my
wedding a</b>
<br><b>few months later, I was 21 years old.&nbsp; It was a quick courtship
and</b>
<br><b>marriage.&nbsp; I saw "John"&nbsp; for the first time, but I could
not hear him.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>was tall, with dark hair and eyes.&nbsp; When I could finally hear
him, he told</b>
<br><b>me he was asked, by a female friend of my husband's, to come out
of a Ouija</b>
<br><b>board, and follow him for the rest of his life, and that he would
not harm</b>
<br><b>us.</b>
<br><b>John was quiet as the years passed, and I seldom even remembered
he was</b>
<br><b>around, until after 1982, when he made himself visible to me.&nbsp;
We found out</b>
<br><b>in 1981 from the builder, that our house was built over an indian
burial</b>
<br><b>ground in south Texas, and he came to warn us.&nbsp; I felt John's
presence more</b>
<br><b>in my life after my husband and I were divorced.&nbsp; I could see
other spirits</b>
<br><b>standing around, and hearing John's voice, he stated that spirits
would</b>
<br><b>follow me because I could see and hear them.&nbsp; They called me
"The Chosen</b>
<br><b>One".</b>
<br><b>He talked about meeting my father, who passed away, in 1973, and
later, my</b>
<br><b>mother, who passed away in 1986.&nbsp; When I first woke up some
mornings, John</b>
<br><b>would tell me when I was not going to work that day, or if I was
going to</b>
<br><b>be working on a project, John would offer his suggestions, and tell
me</b>
<br><b>which times not to go forward with that day's plans, because something
bad</b>
<br><b>was going to happen.</b>
<br><b>In 1998, my boyfriend's mother, who was very religious, passed away
from a</b>
<br><b>rare form of stomach cancer.&nbsp; About a year after she passed,
I saw her</b>
<br><b>standing in the living room talking to me, asking me to leaving
the house</b>
<br><b>as she felt, I was not wanted there.&nbsp; A few months passed,
she again</b>
<br><b>appeared before me, this time telling me she had met my parents,
and that</b>
<br><b>they were both wonderful persons, and that I did not have to leave.</b>
<br><b>New Year's Day, 1999, was my first experience at seeing, the so-called</b>
<br><b>Midnight Train unloading spirit persons in various types of clothing,
at</b>
<br><b>the back door of my boyfriend's home.&nbsp; The voices called his
home, "a way</b>
<br><b>station" where spirits could stop and rest.&nbsp; My boyfriend has
never been</b>
<br><b>able to see or hear these spirits.</b>
<br><b>I felt the thought of all these spirits in this house, to be a bit</b>
<br><b>intimidating, since I could see and hear all of them.&nbsp; I have
seen spirits</b>
<br><b>of persons I knew from high school, and some of the victims in murders,
who</b>
<br><b>have come by the "way station" on the train, one of which was Jon
Benet</b>
<br><b>Ramsey.&nbsp; She only stayed a few minutes and left again.&nbsp;
Another two</b>
<br><b>spirits, were some friends of one of my nephews from high school,
who were</b>
<br><b>both killed and raped by a gang for an initiation.&nbsp; Also, there
is the</b>
<br><b>spirit of a young 13-year old girl who follows me.&nbsp; She drowned
in</b>
<br><b>Matagorda Bay, Texas in 1989, she had been consistently assaulted
by her</b>
<br><b>father before she died.</b>
<br><b>Today is Tuesday, May 1, 2001, and I see and hear the spirits everywhere
I</b>
<br><b>go, and the chatter is sometimes like in a noisy room.&nbsp; Some
of them, I</b>
<br><b>feel to be very dominating, and some are easy going, but listening
to the</b>
<br><b>conversations they have with one another, and me, makes me feel
like I have</b>
<br><b>been chosen to fulfill a need for them of listening to them as they
relay</b>
<br><b>the information they need to share.</b>
<br><b>I am not afraid of them any more.&nbsp; I have prayed many times
to God asking</b>
<br><b>what was the real reason is for me to know about them.&nbsp; I recently
found</b>
<br><b>out that there are others out there like me, and the one item we
all share,</b>
<br><b>is that we have been given a strange gift of hearing and seeing
spirits,</b>
<br><b>and we feel that this gift, is not from God.</b>
<br><b>I have prayed every day to God, asking Him to help me understand
and stop</b>
<br><b>the spirits from following me.&nbsp; I have not heard his answer
yet, and John</b>
<br><b>still follows me every where I go.&nbsp; Thank you for listening
to me share my</b>
<br><b>information.</b><b></b>

<br><b>GHOST IN THE WINDOW</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CrystalN.Dempsey@mail.state.ky.us</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;There is a town near my home in Frankfort called Millville.
Now this</b>
<br><b>town is one of the oldest in Kentucky and it has a very dark history.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>have been told that this was a place of racial lynching and harassment.</b>
<br><b>There are many myths and rumors about many places in this area and
my</b>
<br><b>friends and I have wandered through these places many times. I have
actually</b>
<br><b>only had one experience, though. It was a Saturday night at about
3 o'clock</b>
<br><b>or so. My friends and I had been partying that night and decided
that we</b>
<br><b>were not ready to go home. So we drove out to this distillery that
is</b>
<br><b>supposed to be haunted. One of my co-workers dated a guy who's father
owned</b>
<br><b>it. Well, his dad let him live in one of the warehouses up there.
She asked</b>
<br><b>him about all the rumors. He said that he had never seen anything,
but he</b>
<br><b>would often hear voices and things scooting around. My experience
was not at</b>
<br><b>the distillery, it was at this big, red building that looked like
an old</b>
<br><b>court house or something. I have been told that it was later used
for the</b>
<br><b>distillery as an office, but has long since been abandoned. We pulled
up</b>
<br><b>into it's large parking lot to turn around. As we were getting ready
to</b>
<br><b>leave one of my friends noticed a light in there and yelled for
me to stop</b>
<br><b>the car. I did so and backed up so we could see better. We looked
through a</b>
<br><b>very large window where the glass was broken out. Sure enough, there
was a</b>
<br><b>very dim, blue light coming from the back room. It was almost like
a light</b>
<br><b>from a TV. Now mind you, there was no electricity in that building,
hadn't</b>
<br><b>been for a long time. We sat quietly trying to figure out what it
was.</b>
<br><b>Sometimes I thought I could see movement, but I never could be certain.
We</b>
<br><b>may have been sitting there for 5 minutes when something went right
across</b>
<br><b>that window. It was very dark and didn't really have any type of
form. You</b>
<br><b>couldn't really call it a shadow because it had substance. I know
it wasn't</b>
<br><b>human, though. My friends and I looked at each and screamed our
heads off</b>
<br><b>and every time I screamed I hit the gas petal. My car kept lurching
forward,</b>
<br><b>it was almost comical. It wasn't funny at the time, I am embarrassed
to say</b>
<br><b>that at 19 years old, I had bladder failure that night! I really
have no</b>
<br><b>idea what that was, but we have been back since and never seen anything</b>
<br><b>else. I will never forget it.</b>

<br><b>Ghost from Toronto</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gusha@sympatico.ca</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My story;</b>
<br><b>Since I was 7 (I am 34 now) and moved into a newly built home, I</b>
<br><b>detected presences.&nbsp; Like most adults, my parents reassured
me that it</b>
<br><b>was my imagination.&nbsp; My haunting consisted of hearing someone
breathing</b>
<br><b>when I was the only one in a room, visions rather flashes on my
closet</b>
<br><b>door.&nbsp; Many of them, mostly materialistic (I can't remember
them now).</b>
<br><b>Actually I remember watching shadowing imagins ballroom dancing
on my</b>
<br><b>wall.&nbsp; I stoped fearing it (I think only one spirit - I'm not
sure) and</b>
<br><b>used to say 'Hi if your here and hi if your not'.&nbsp; I would
know if it</b>
<br><b>was around.&nbsp; I remember very often (especially in the evening
when</b>
<br><b>everyone was asleep) it walking around.&nbsp; It would climb the
stairs and</b>
<br><b>stop right at the landing leading to the stairs to the bedrooms.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>parents would often find me on my sisters bed (directly facing the
hall)</b>
<br><b>stooped on asleep gaurding my siblings.</b>
<br><b>When I was eighteen, I awoke to my hand being pulled by this spirit.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>scared me, really scared me.&nbsp; Here is a ghost that I know slept
in my</b>
<br><b>bed with me (I would feel it breath on me and just turn the other
way</b>
<br><b>saying good night) crossing the boundry of touch. Of course this
freaked</b>
<br><b>me out of my mind.&nbsp; I remember sitting up only to have this
spirit grab</b>
<br><b>my leg and try to pull me.&nbsp; I lost it and through myself into
my sisters</b>
<br><b>bed screaming.&nbsp; I have never sensed it again.&nbsp; I moved
out on my own</b>
<br><b>shortly after that never really detected it again (even though I
have</b>
<br><b>slept at my parents house since).&nbsp; I truly believe that it
did not want</b>
<br><b>to harm me and really felt bad for scaring me.&nbsp; I think it
left after</b>
<br><b>that evening.</b>
<br><b>My dad told me that shortly after I had left that a neighbour started
to</b>
<br><b>repeat the same stories I use to tell him.&nbsp; We thought perhaps
it went</b>
<br><b>to their home.&nbsp; Thay had a priest come to there home to bless
it.</b>

<br><b>My Ghost Ward</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: muddywaters@adamswells.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I recently divorced my husband and moved out of my beloved house.
This house always had a special place in my house and always will.</b>
<br><b>I always felt that it was *alive*.It was in poor repair when we
bought it and we put every cent we had into her to make her what she used
to be.In fact when the house was *gutted* stood in the center and asked
it what it wanted to be.</b>
<br><b>That same week my then husband was in the attic and under some insulation
he found an old art print dated 1897 of a little girl all dressed up for
the opera.The colors were absolutely VIBRANT. I took this as a sign and
used this as a basis for the colors etc.. for the house.</b>
<br><b>I often was awakened by the sounds of faint, happy laughter and
music.I used to think it was the neighbors but soon realized that it was
a residual haunting, especially after I had to return to spend 2 nights
recently to care for my epileptic ex husband.</b>
<br><b>I heard the music and laughing again.I also recently was putting
away some photos in my apartment and came across one I had hurriedly taken
from my house and never really looked at.</b>
<br><b>I simply wanted a photo of my beloved home.</b>
<br><b>I now realized that the front of my home is covered by a mist and
there are several small pinpoints of light near the ground.</b>

<br><b>Haunted Plachette Playhouse</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: PDL147852@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Dear Shadowlands I would like to thank you for including the Plachette</b>
<br><b>Playhouse in haunted places in Delaware. Myself and others who were
there</b>
<br><b>alot organizing plays and dances, before they sold the place out
from under</b>
<br><b>us, sent in info but got discouraged when it seemed it would not
be posted.</b>
<br><b>They say the governor's mansion is the most haunted place in DE
but I've</b>
<br><b>researched the mansion and to me the Playhouse makes the governor's
mansion</b>
<br><b>look like a Rita's Water Ice. For one people can actually live in
the</b>
<br><b>governor's mansion where the Playhouse is down right dangerously
active. It's</b>
<br><b>been almost about a year and 9 months since we lost the place but
the wierd</b>
<br><b>thing is all of us who used to run the place still have nightmares
about the</b>
<br><b>place. I could tell you so much because the place is an icon. I
was even at a</b>
<br><b>Halloween campfire story telling type thing and the historian told
this story</b>
<br><b>about this mansion in Delaware, he wouldn't say where, that was
haunted by</b>
<br><b>former patrons and possessed by demons. When the night was over
I went up to</b>
<br><b>him and shocked him by telling the location of the mansion. I also
told him</b>
<br><b>all the legends were true and then some and he knew I was the real
deal. To</b>
<br><b>me of everything in the Playhouse the most frightening was the Red
Lady. She</b>
<br><b>is very mysterious and when I was there she would torment me, more
in an</b>
<br><b>annoying then scary way, constantly. Some say she was a prostitute
murdered</b>
<br><b>on the second floor, others say she is a Succubus. I know she can't
be both</b>
<br><b>because a Succubus is a demon and demons were never human. I'd always
see her</b>
<br><b>on the first floor moving things, throwing things with her cloak
pulled over</b>
<br><b>her face like a monk. The Red Room on the second floor is where
she is</b>
<br><b>strongest and I NEVER went in there alone. If the prostiute theory
is true it</b>
<br><b>was where she was murdered. She is seen in that upper window alot
and</b>
<br><b>especially up close and personal by the telephone guy working on
the wires</b>
<br><b>just out side the window on the pole. To the telephone guy and others&nbsp;
saw</b>
<br><b>her human face. The telephone guy went as far as to ask one of the
nieghbors</b>
<br><b>who that pretty girl is in the house because he wanted to ask her
out . The</b>
<br><b>nieghbor said that nobody has actually 'lived' there in years. So
we have her</b>
<br><b>cloaked,as I have seen, and human but there is a third manifestation.
An</b>
<br><b>aquaintence of the mansions owner, if I haven't been clear my associates
and</b>
<br><b>I didn't own the place merely rented, didn't want to drive home
after a</b>
<br><b>construction job near the mansion so he asked the owner if he could
crash at</b>
<br><b>the empty, because we mostly only used it on weekends, mansion.
The owner</b>
<br><b>reluctantly agreed but told the man he would regret spending the
night there</b>
<br><b>alone but the worker said, "I don't belive in that ghost sh*t".
That night</b>
<br><b>the worker went there and slept in a bed in the room my associates
and I had</b>
<br><b>made the most accomidating that being the Red Room. In the night
he was</b>
<br><b>awaked by movement on the bed and not his own. He hadn't turned
the lights</b>
<br><b>off so when he looked next to him he saw in the bed the bare back
of a young</b>
<br><b>lady lieing on her side facing away from him twards the wall. This
guy was</b>
<br><b>thinking "Hey a hot chic just got in bed with me'' Why would he
think</b>
<br><b>anything else, right? When he touched her shoulder and said , Hey
you, she</b>
<br><b>rolled over. When he later told of the incident he said his feet
never</b>
<br><b>touched the stairs on the way out. I know I found the front door
off the</b>
<br><b>hinges and his gear, including most of the clothes he was wearing
that night</b>
<br><b>in the Red Room several days later. He also said when the girl rolled
over</b>
<br><b>her face was not human but what he described as that of a monkey/dog
which</b>
<br><b>gives more to the demon theory. I told you the place makes people
into</b>
<br><b>believers. What do you in your expert opinion think she is? Lastly
I'd like</b>
<br><b>to report that the Plachette Playhouse will be opening for business
again</b>
<br><b>under a different name and not by us. After the place was sold the
new owner</b>
<br><b>had plans to tear it down. We had the Historical Society intervene
to block</b>
<br><b>it and were successful the owner eventually realized that his knewly
aquired</b>
<br><b>property was useless if he couldn't tear it down and sold it to
a nieghbor of</b>
<br><b>the mansion. It was actually the same nieghbor who told the telephone
guy he</b>
<br><b>had seen a ghost. He's going to fix it up and make it into a bed
and</b>
<br><b>breakfast. There was a big write up about it in our local newspaper
recently.</b>
<br><b>Unfortunitely the article didn't mention me and my associates role
in running</b>
<br><b>the place then saving it from the wrecking ball. It also didn't
say anything</b>
<br><b>about the ghosts. I spoke to the owner personally who we knew from
since we</b>
<br><b>were running the place and said that he wants to keep the ghost
stuff from</b>
<br><b>those who don't already know. My theory on his keeping the ghost
thing quiet</b>
<br><b>is because an inn with a cute grandma ghost roaming the hall is
good for</b>
<br><b>business but these kind of pushy,literally, scary angry spirits
are not. I</b>
<br><b>plan to get a room there when the place reopens but not alone. If
you send me</b>
<br><b>a mailing address I'll send you a copy of the newspaper article.
I'm old</b>
<br><b>fashion so I don't do the fax or the scanning thing.</b>

<br><b>Ghosts in Deutschland</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: tim.keneipp@domail.maricopa.edu</b><b></b>
<p><b>Several years ago my wife and I were touring central Germany by car.
We</b>
<br><b>had started our adventure in Franfurt and for the next two weeks</b>
<br><b>explored the area around what is known as the Romantischstrasse
- the</b>
<br><b>Roman Road, the road built by the Romans which extends between Fusen
on</b>
<br><b>the Austrian border to near Nuremburg. The last night of our journey
was</b>
<br><b>spent in the medieval village of Miltenburg on the Mein River in
a hotel</b>
<br><b>(guesthaus in Germay) called the Zum Riesen - the oldest guesthaus
in</b>
<br><b>Germany! The Zum Riesen was built in the mid-Eleventh Century and
had</b>
<br><b>played host to numerous European dignitaries through the course
of time</b>
<br><b>including Queen Christina of Sweden. Think about it! The Zum Riesen
was</b>
<br><b>already nearly 350 years old when Columbus set sail from Portugal
in</b>
<br><b>search of a western passage to India. The then current owners were
a</b>
<br><b>lovely elderly couple of which the husband was a retired architect
and</b>
<br><b>had overseen much of the remodeling of the grand old half-timber</b>
<br><b>structure to include all the modern conveniences we Americans have
come</b>
<br><b>to expect in our accommodations. Anyway, sometime after dinner my
wife</b>
<br><b>and I were in bed reading and generally preparing to cruise off
into</b>
<br><b>Dreamland, when suddenly the windows flew OPEN and a floor lamp
turned</b>
<br><b>ON. We turned to each other and said, "Whoa!" We then theorized
that</b>
<br><b>Queen Christina (or somebody) had chosen to make their presence
known to</b>
<br><b>us. We never "saw" anybody and there were no further displays, but
we</b>
<br><b>definitely had the notion that we had observed a supernatural event.</b>

<p><b>MY TWO GHOSTLY EXPERIENCES</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: StarB8888@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have always been fascinated by the supernatural.&nbsp; Several
years ago, a</b>
<br><b>college teacher, who I was very close to, died suddenly.&nbsp; I
was terribly</b>
<br><b>depressed by this, because he had been such a mentor to me...a father
figure,</b>
<br><b>so to speak.&nbsp; The evening of the funeral visitation, I had
gone over to my</b>
<br><b>ex-boyfriends house for the night.&nbsp; I didn't want to be alone.&nbsp;
As I was</b>
<br><b>getting ready for bed, I sat down and started sobbing.&nbsp; My
boyfriend at the</b>
<br><b>time walked into the room and sat down on the edge of the bed to
comfort me.</b>
<br><b>I kept telling him how sad I was that I didn't get to say good-bye
to Jack</b>
<br><b>and how he'd never know how much he meant to me. Suddenly, we heard
a strange</b>
<br><b>noise and we looked across the room to the dresser where two greeting
cards</b>
<br><b>were standing.&nbsp; One of the cards started to move across the
dresser slowly</b>
<br><b>and as it moved, it made a scraping noise against the wood.&nbsp;
We sat there in</b>
<br><b>total shock as we watched this card slide at least 4 feet and then
come to a</b>
<br><b>complete stop while standing upright.&nbsp; My boyfriend was immediately</b>
<br><b>mortified, but it didn't affect me that way at all.&nbsp; I know
that noone will</b>
<br><b>fully understand what I felt at that moment, but I will try to explain.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>felt almost a tingly sensation, and then suddenly the most peaceful
calm</b>
<br><b>swept over me.&nbsp; The air felt thick with his presence and I
was suddenly no</b>
<br><b>longer sad at all.&nbsp; I will forever remember that night.&nbsp;
It truly changed my</b>
<br><b>life.&nbsp; Since then I haven't really had any other significant
encounters with</b>
<br><b>a spirit until last week.&nbsp; My husband works late at night and
I had put my</b>
<br><b>daughter in bed and was getting ready to do the same when the dog
jumped up</b>
<br><b>and started growling like crazy at the bedroom door.&nbsp; This
startled me,</b>
<br><b>because I had never heard the dog growl before.&nbsp; He's a very
mild mannered</b>
<br><b>animal.&nbsp; Anyway, I looked at the door and of course nothing
was there.&nbsp; By</b>
<br><b>this time panic had set in me, because the dogs eyes were following
something</b>
<br><b>across the room. Suddenly he started crying and backed under the
computer</b>
<br><b>desk.&nbsp; I couldn't get him to come out.&nbsp; He was completely
scared to death.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>had to physically pick him up to get him out of the room.&nbsp;
And he's a big</b>
<br><b>dog!&nbsp; I was going to force him come with me to check the house
out for</b>
<br><b>intruders.&nbsp; As we were walking down the hall, I saw a man's
reflection in a</b>
<br><b>picture on the wall staring at me.&nbsp; When I turned to see who's
reflection it</b>
<br><b>was, there was noone there.&nbsp; I was so scared that I thought
I was going to</b>
<br><b>have a heart attack.&nbsp; Whatever it was felt AWFUL!&nbsp; I hope
I never experience</b>
<br><b>anything remotely like that again.&nbsp; Does anyone know if a ghost
can just</b>
<br><b>randomly come through a home?&nbsp; This place has never felt spooky
to me before.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My 1st Paranormal Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Polterguist927@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was 8 years old at the time of this experience (im 13 now). One
night while</b>
<br><b>in bed I heard a noise that sounded like a&nbsp; pan smashing into
a window when I</b>
<br><b>went to check,there was nothing there or broken.So I went back to
bed and</b>
<br><b>when I lay down I saw a huge black figure staring at me and then
it</b>
<br><b>vanished,I screamed so loud my neighbors up,literally.So when my
parents came</b>
<br><b>in they told me I had a nightmare so I went to bed.The next night
the spirit</b>
<br><b>came back,but this time I didn't scream,I spoke to it.I asked it
questions</b>
<br><b>like "whats your name?" and "How did you die?" and last "What do
you want</b>
<br><b>from me?".His name was Robert,His cause of death was murder,and
he was</b>
<br><b>haunting me because he wanted me to find something for him,a small
velvet</b>
<br><b>chest,it was passed down through generations in his family.So the

<br><b>Ghost in Television?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ScorpLiz@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am 19 years old, writing in behalf
of my family's new ghost</b>
<br><b>experience.&nbsp; My family has been dealing and living with ghosts
since we were</b>
<br><b>small.&nbsp; My mother and her mother as well.&nbsp; I've come to
believe that our</b>
<br><b>family attracts spirits or something, because no matter what home
we live in,</b>
<br><b>there is always something with us.&nbsp; For me, it all started
in my last home,</b>
<br><b>when my sisters played with the oujia (spelling?) board.&nbsp; My
mother always</b>
<br><b>told us never to play around with it because she believed it played
with</b>
<br><b>evil--something not good.&nbsp; Well--we did, and what we got was
very weird.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>could tell you sooooo many stories.&nbsp; Not much ever happened
to me--only a few</b>
<br><b>things.&nbsp; Basically, enough to make me a believer.&nbsp; We
are a strong family of</b>
<br><b>Catholics, and we've always felt that our prayers have kept away
anything</b>
<br><b>terrible from happening, but a recent photgraph taken of my sister
and her</b>
<br><b>new baby has scared all of us.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've heard about the recent phenomenon
of spirits coming out through</b>
<br><b>the television on the internet and have seen a few photos that people
have</b>
<br><b>submitted.&nbsp; They're scarry, but not half as scary as ours.&nbsp;
My sisters child</b>
<br><b>is the first in the family, and Juli (my sister) has always feared
the</b>
<br><b>presence of the ghosts around us.&nbsp; She's actually the only
one who's seen the</b>
<br><b>ghosts.&nbsp; Anyways, a photo taken of her and her baby in her
apartment has the</b>
<br><b>television in the background.&nbsp; My other sister was the one
taking the picture</b>
<br><b>at the time, and swears that the tv is off.&nbsp; They both are
positive it was</b>
<br><b>off, because it's not like them to take a picture with the TV on
in the</b>
<br><b>background.&nbsp; Also--there is no lights on, on the TV, and other
then the face</b>
<br><b>in it, it's all dark around him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first glance at the picture, you
see my sister and the baby and</b>
<br><b>then you see a face, all red.&nbsp; My sister said it looked like
the devil.&nbsp; If</b>
<br><b>you look closer with a magnify glass, you can tell he is wearing
glasses.</b>
<br><b>So, we blew it up.&nbsp; Bear in mind, we were all looking for a
logical</b>
<br><b>explination for it.&nbsp; It's in the negative, the TV is off.&nbsp;
It's not a</b>
<br><b>reflection of anyone we know.&nbsp; Getting back to the point, we
blew it up and</b>
<br><b>our findings are creepy.&nbsp; You can see him so well.&nbsp; He
is wearing glasses,</b>
<br><b>he's wearing a suit, and he's looking right at my sister and the
baby.&nbsp; It' s</b>
<br><b>just of his head and l a little below his neck.&nbsp; He's an older
man and he's</b>
<br><b>all within the TV.&nbsp; You can see the reflection of&nbsp; the
apartment walls and</b>
<br><b>lights in the background in the TV too.&nbsp; The TV IS NOT ON!!!</b>
<br><b>`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SO--these last few days, it's all I can think about.&nbsp; I've shown</b>
<br><b>my friends--people who do not believe in ghosts, and they can't
believe</b>
<br><b>they're eyes.&nbsp; They're all freaked out by it.&nbsp; My dad
has never wanted to</b>
<br><b>believe the hauntings that we've all experieneced-even when my mom
swore to</b>
<br><b>him that she's been haunted.&nbsp;&nbsp; When he saw the picture,
he was pretty weirded</b>
<br><b>out by it too.</b>

<p><b>Haunted Room</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: psychicvessel@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>The reason I am writing this is not to freak anyone out, but to figure
out</b>
<br><b>just what I experienced during a two day period about five years
ago.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>have never heard of anyone else having an experience that is even
romotely</b>
<br><b>similiar to this one.&nbsp; I have been trying to find information
on this type</b>
<br><b>of supernatural experience but so far, I have found nothing.&nbsp;
I was hoping</b>
<br><b>that there was a possibility that you could shine some light on
this strange</b>
<br><b>occurance in my life.&nbsp; For five years now I have been carrying
this story</b>
<br><b>around locked up inside of me because I didn't want to relive the</b>
<br><b>experience.&nbsp; It hasn't been until recently that I finally disclosed
my</b>
<br><b>experience with some close friends, and they didn't know what to
make of it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Anyway, my story starts now.&nbsp; When I was in 5th grade,
I had a friend that</b>
<br><b>My mother forebade me to associate with for some reason or another,
so for</b>
<br><b>three years I didn't.&nbsp; This friend lived with his grandmother
on a farm.</b>
<br><b>His mother had never taken care of him, she moved to Alaska when
my friend</b>
<br><b>was an infant and he rarely saw her.&nbsp; His father was a druggy
and up until</b>
<br><b>recently had absolutely nothing to do with his son.&nbsp; Then suddenly
when both</b>
<br><b>of us were in 8th grade, his mother moved back into town, bought
a very old</b>
<br><b>house, (one of the oldest in my town) and forced My friend to live
with her.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; At about the same time, my parents&nbsp; had decided to get
a divorce, and</b>
<br><b>during that stressful time in thier lives, my mother became more</b>
<br><b>complaceant, apparently because her mind was on other things, and
I finally</b>
<br><b>reunited with one of my best friends after 3 years.&nbsp; To get
away from the</b>
<br><b>craziness of my own home, I frequently visited my friend and his
mother (who</b>
<br><b>was living with a man that she was planning to marry and his 3 sons
as well)</b>
<br><b>and had a good time.&nbsp; I would stay the night every weekend
and sometimes on</b>
<br><b>week days as well, which I had never been able to do with any of
my friends</b>
<br><b>before because of school.&nbsp; As soon as I set foot into the house
for the</b>
<br><b>first time however, I knew that there was something wrong with it.&nbsp;
As soon</b>
<br><b>as I stepped through the door, the horrible smell of rotting flesh
almost</b>
<br><b>bowled me over, however for some reason, I seemed to be the only
one that</b>
<br><b>noticed it.&nbsp; My 2 younger brothers would often accompany me
to my friend's</b>
<br><b>house because the man's three sons were roughly the same age as
my brothers</b>
<br><b>were and they knew each other from school.&nbsp; I know that people
get used to</b>
<br><b>the smell of thier habitat after a while no matter how aweful the
smell is,</b>
<br><b>but even my brother's smelled nothing.&nbsp; The first night that
I stayed with</b>
<br><b>My friend, he gave me a tour of the house.&nbsp; A large stone house,
two</b>
<br><b>stories, five bedrooms, two bathrooms, one upstairs and one downstairs.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>upstairs portion held the bedrooms of all of the children that resided</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; My friend's room was at the top of the stairs to the
left, there was</b>
<br><b>an open area at the top of the stairs that one of the boys slept
in.&nbsp; From</b>
<br><b>the stairs directly to the right was the upstairs bathroom, and
to the</b>
<br><b>bathroom door's left the was a dark hall; one room half way down
on the</b>
<br><b>right and one very odd octagonal room at the end of the hall.&nbsp;
The room at</b>
<br><b>the end of the hall was&nbsp; the youngest of the three boys' room.&nbsp;
It had a</b>
<br><b>very small mattress on top of a set of small box springs, a chandelier
in</b>
<br><b>one of the eight corners of the room that hung to the floor.&nbsp;
The window was</b>
<br><b>covered with a plastic storm window, the wallpaper was peeling to
reveal</b>
<br><b>strange writing and poems, none of which can I remember now, it's
been too</b>
<br><b>long.&nbsp; There were old plywood shelves that were more like countertops
that</b>
<br><b>lined the room all the way around and it was dark, cold and forbidding.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>would always avoid even looking at this room when I was upstairs,
that's how</b>
<br><b>scary it was for me.&nbsp; The child that slept in the room was
the youngest of</b>
<br><b>the man's three children, and was always very quite, in fact I never
heard</b>
<br><b>him utter a word at all.&nbsp; He would cry and was very skiddish,
almost like a</b>
<br><b>feral animal.&nbsp; About a month after I started visiting this
house, the little</b>
<br><b>boy moved away and I overheard his father and my friend's mother
talkin</b>
<br><b>downstairs one night about the boy.&nbsp; The boy's dad seemed to
be as puzzled</b>
<br><b>about the boy's behavior as I was.&nbsp; I overheard him saying
that he had never</b>
<br><b>seen the boy like that before.&nbsp; Apparently he had always been
very</b>
<br><b>articulate and friendly.&nbsp; A few days later I asked my friend
about the boy.</b>
<br><b>He told be that a week or so before, the boy woke up in the middle
of the</b>
<br><b>night wailing.&nbsp; He woke everyone in the house up.&nbsp; When
his father came to</b>
<br><b>see what was the matter he was shaking and he told his dad to take
him to</b>
<br><b>his mom's house that night.&nbsp; He never came back.&nbsp; That
night my friend</b>
<br><b>wanted to show me something about the house that he had been waiting
to show</b>
<br><b>me until his mother and her boyfriend was out of the house and it
was just</b>
<br><b>him and me.&nbsp; He showed me something that made me even more
afraid of the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; There were secret passages.&nbsp; One led from outside,
through the wood</b>
<br><b>closet on the side of the house and out through the wooden chest
in his</b>
<br><b>mother and her boyfriend's room.&nbsp; He also showed me one that
led from the</b>
<br><b>hall with the wierd room at the end into the upstairs bathroom.&nbsp;
When I was</b>
<br><b>visiting my friend another time, I had to use the bathroom at (conviniently)</b>
<br><b>around midnight.&nbsp; When I got to the bathrrom door I could hear
whispers</b>
<br><b>coming from down the hall.&nbsp; This worried me, so I finished
my business</b>
<br><b>quick, fast and in a hurry and went back to bed.&nbsp; The next
day, my friend,</b>
<br><b>another friend and I were outside.&nbsp; I had to go to the bathroom
and so I</b>
<br><b>went into the house, bypassed the downstairs bathroom even though
it was</b>
<br><b>unoccupied and made my way upstairs to use the bathroom.&nbsp; When
I had</b>
<br><b>finished my business, I came out of the bathroom.&nbsp; I remember
looking down</b>
<br><b>the spooky hall into the bedroom at the end of it and for some reason
felt</b>
<br><b>compelled to go down the hall into the room.&nbsp; This next part
is the</b>
<br><b>wierdest.&nbsp; I started cleaning the room.&nbsp; Picking up, rearranging.&nbsp;
I took</b>
<br><b>down the chandelier and the plastic from the window.&nbsp; I organized
the junk</b>
<br><b>on the counter and generally just spruced the room up.&nbsp; Why
is that wierd?</b>
<br><b>Well, I was conscieous of what I was doing but not really aware
of it.&nbsp; It's</b>
<br><b>hard to explain, but it was like my mind went blank and I was just
drawn</b>
<br><b>into the room by some unknown force.&nbsp; It definately was not
of my own</b>
<br><b>volition because I was terrified of the room.&nbsp; I refused to
enter it even</b>
<br><b>when my friends were with me.&nbsp; But this time I was by myself
and went down</b>
<br><b>there and spent an hour and a half cleaning it alone!!&nbsp; When
I got done and</b>
<br><b>back out of the hall, I looked back at the room.&nbsp; I remembered
cleaning it,</b>
<br><b>but it was like It just occured to me that that was what I was doing,
and</b>
<br><b>for the life of me I couldn't figure out why I had done it.&nbsp;
Anyways, that's</b>
<br><b>my story.&nbsp; I know it's long winded but thank you for reading
it.&nbsp; I woul</b>
<br><b>really like to hear from someone.&nbsp; I want to know what happened
to me and</b>
<br><b>why.&nbsp; I though that maybe you could shine a light on it.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Puerto Rico's Ghosts</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: carlosmeen@prtc.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Hy, my name is Carlos Mendoza and live in Puerto Rico. Since
my first experience with ghosts or the likes in a township known as Cidra
in this my country, I am having ghostic sightings almost daily elsewhere.
Among these ghostisms that</b>
<br><b>jot out are three stories.The reasons for these prominences were
durations of these.</b>
<br><b>The first was in the form of a tiny bright pinball but what it became
was shocking. As I was driving on the second lane of high way 1 home&nbsp;
late at night noticed what appeared as this ball bouncing a few inches
off the left side of the metal rail that divided this high way. Even thought
it advanced rapidly it took long time to catch up with my car. When it
did it became a dark cat, veered off to the left, and crossed across these
lanes and my car. I braked my car to avoid running it over. Logically,
and despite this cat ran into the left tires, I knew I did not run it over
because my car' tires did not mount on anything. Later I realized it was
a ghost.</b>
<br><b>The second was even more shocking because it involved a dead uncle
of mine. I have seen this entity before. However all previous times these
sightinings were brief. This time it lasted over 5 minutes. These facts
and story happened this way: I was computerizing on my laptop school stuff
in my bed room. Excepted for this room, the rest of the light was in darkness.
I stood up to place these documents into a folder in other room where I
have other computer- a Pentium 3. This bed room was built as a second story.
Outside of it there is an electric light pole, which illuminates dimly
this room. Across the door to this room, there is a window. This window
is different from the ones in the states. It is made of aluminum. It has
blades that opened or closed fastened in the middle by a bar. As I entered
this room I saw this entity head and shoulder showing off outside this
window. Upon seeing it, my mind went blank with&nbsp; fears. After staring
at each other, I stared this entity off. This entity turned around partially
and left. As I filed these documents and I did not bother to check what
is was or close&nbsp; this window. I went to bed and couldn't help thinking
about it. I reasoned that he has become a 20 feet giant for the height
between this window and the outlevel ground is approximant 20 feet. Also,
I also knew that ghosts can use electricity to appear or to become what
they want-this big ( The Shadowlands, ghosted weather station, Page. 1
) What I&nbsp; keep asking my self is why this relative of mine is in my
house spooking and bothering me? I am remembering that I saw him in life
in a few times. He belonged to the Latin King Gang in Chicago and was murdered
by them. Does any body know&nbsp; what does he want? Oh yeaht, I haven'
been able to find out my house history for lack of time. Anyway where do
I go for it?</b>
<br><b>The third experience is about a woman. This have appeared many time
to me in my mother's house, which is located in other town-Gurabo. This
lady hangs out by where there are a phone and a table lamp. She wears a
black night gown. Her facial features seem blurry. When she appears and
disappears I feel caressness on my head. I thought it was a bug. I realized
it was not. It was her. She does it when I visit my mother after work.
Who is her and why I have only seen it?</b>

<p><b>Here is my Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: RSweetiegrl352@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have always been sensitive to spirits and I have believed in paranormal</b>
<br><b>activity. I think my grandmothers house and my mothers house both
have</b>
<br><b>spirital preasenses in them. Here are just a few of my expirences.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was just a normal Saturday my sister and a
friend decided they wanted</b>
<br><b>to go to the friends house and grab some make-up and hang out. Before
leaving</b>
<br><b>we told our mom we would be back soon she informed us She was taking
david</b>
<br><b>our friends brother and our little sister to town with her and would
be gone</b>
<br><b>a while after spending some time at our friends house we came back
up to find</b>
<br><b>the house completely empty and as we started to enter a noise rose
from the</b>
<br><b>back bedroom it sounded somewhat like a child stomping his/her feet.
As we</b>
<br><b>proceeded to open the door little whispers began as the stomping
stopped as</b>
<br><b>my sister entered the continued until the time it was for me to
enter the</b>
<br><b>moment I set foot in the door the came to a stop of course us being
from the</b>
<br><b>neighbor hood we are from we thought it was somebody breaking in
of course</b>
<br><b>being the oldest and most stubborn I entered walking around to make
sure the</b>
<br><b>house was vancant before allowing the girls to enter, no other noises
as I</b>
<br><b>walked around checking then we all entered the living room, I proceeded
to</b>
<br><b>close and lock all doors after making sure they were all closed
and locked we</b>
<br><b>sat down to have a fun "what do you think about guys" coversation,
you know</b>
<br><b>typical Jr. High conversation, well as we were all giggling I felt
a cold</b>
<br><b>wind slowly go by me I rose from my seat sensing something was in
that room</b>
<br><b>and didnt want me there as I stood I heard a whisper and the door
that was</b>
<br><b>fully locked to my sisters bedroom opened fully and stood there
no movement</b>
<br><b>then shut and locked you could here the lock click and could see
it turn. I</b>
<br><b>told my sister and friend to stay seated and calm I went into the</b>
<br><b>bedroom,agian hearing whispers and no one was there then I turned
to see and</b>
<br><b>foggy image in a corner I knew I didnt want to mess with whatever
was there</b>
<br><b>so I turned and left I informed my sisters it was just the wind
and we didnt</b>
<br><b>speak of it agian.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My grandmothers house has always seemed
warm except in the bedroom when</b>
<br><b>you walk through it you get the sense something is watching you.
There is an</b>
<br><b>exceptionally cold area on the oppisite side of the bed toward the
window,If</b>
<br><b>you walk through that area or roll on the side of the bed it will
feel as if</b>
<br><b>someone is touching you on the back or shoulder.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And also in the hall
if you lie in the bed you will see a figure of</b>
<br><b>a young girl standing in the hall looking at you then she turns
and fades</b>
<br><b>then the light on the smoke detecter turns on every night at exactly
midnight</b>
<br><b>at one minute after midnight it turns off if you walk through the
hall at</b>
<br><b>night and look into the guest bathroom you will see a foggy image
this has</b>
<br><b>been since I was young enough to realize this.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Haunted House in Texas</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Dragracer007@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well there have actually been a couple of things that happened here.&nbsp;

after my</b>
<br><b>grandfather got back from WWII.&nbsp; My grandparents, father, aunt,
and uncle all</b>
<br><b>grew up here.&nbsp; My uncle was in the korean war and when he came

game in the mid</b>
<br><b>60's and found my uncle dead in the old barn that used to stand
right behind</b>
<br><b>the house.&nbsp; It was ruled a suicide but there was no note.&nbsp;
My grandmother</b>
<br><b>also died here from alhiemers in the late 80's.&nbsp; Right after
that happened is</b>
<br><b>when the first thing occurred.&nbsp; My mom came over to the house
to help my</b>
<br><b>grandfather find his contact he had lost.&nbsp; Well as my mom pulled
up in the</b>
<br><b>front yard she said something made her look up to the 2nd story
window</b>
<br><b>overlooking the front yard.&nbsp; She said she saw my grandmother
overlooking the</b>

of my sisters woke</b>
<br><b>up late one night in the same room that my grandmother had been
seen and said</b>
<br><b>there was a fog floating above her.&nbsp; When I was younger I was
playing like my</b>
<br><b>hand was a gun and shot at a reef on the wall and it fell off.&nbsp;
My sister</b>
<br><b>in-law woke up one morning and saw an old man by a tree in the front
yard</b>
<br><b>with a flanel jacket on and hat that has the ear flaps.&nbsp; That

<br><b>Ghost Story: Grandpa Joe</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: NickJansen3384@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My story starts off in Haw Branch, NC. It was right after my great
uncle</b>
<br><b>Joe's death. We always called him Grandpa Joe, he was 97 when a
heart attack</b>
<br><b>felled him just a day before his birthday. My cousins Trey and Amanda,
were</b>
<br><b>going to go with me to Grandpa Joe's house to help his wife May,
Granny May</b>
<br><b>to us, she went to stay with her family up in siler city while we
cleared the</b>
<br><b>house out. Grandpa Joe, always chewed tobacco and had a spittoon
which he</b>
<br><b>would hardly ever get any spit in, normally it would hit the floor,
making a</b>
<br><b>stain that would take hours to remove. Well we take the things to
put in</b>
<br><b>storage and I take the spittoon as a momento of my best friend in
the family.</b>
<br><b>After I got the thing at my house my girlfriend asks me if I've
started</b>
<br><b>chewing tobacco, of course I don't so I say "no, why ?" she points
to the</b>
<br><b>floor where I put the spittoon, and there are&nbsp; stains from
tobacco juice on</b>
<br><b>the floor around it..I get a bit worried there and I clean them
up but they</b>
<br><b>show up every time I clean them up. Finally I just put the thing
in storage</b>
<br><b>and now there's a picture of him up on the wall.</b>
<br><b>I know my story isn't scarey but I don't Grandpa Joe would ever
scare us, he</b>
<br><b>loves this family too much, he just wants us to know he's there
and to think</b>
<br><b>of him. The stains remain though from where it used to be.</b>

<p><b>Grandmothers Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kathicomstock1@charter.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is not an experience that I had, but one that my grandmother
told me about several years ago.&nbsp; She was born in 1903 I believe and
like most families did at that time, grew up on a farm.&nbsp; There were
17 children total so the house was quite full most of the time.&nbsp; As
the children got a bit older they were allowed to stay up later and for
entertainment they would play cards at night.&nbsp; During one of these
games there was a knock on the door.&nbsp; The mother got up and answered
it.&nbsp; There stood a man who was in need of shelter.&nbsp; He was told
that there was no room in the house but that he was more than welcome to
sleep in the barn.&nbsp; He was invited in to join in or watch the game
of cards they were playing.&nbsp; Everything was going well until one of
my grandmothers brothers dropped something on the floor.&nbsp; As he leaned
under the table to pick it up he noticed that the stranger had no feet.&nbsp;
Instead he had hooves.&nbsp; He obviously became frightened and made a
hasty retreat to his bed-most likely to pray.&nbsp; Early the next morning
someone, I don't remember if it was that brother, went to the barn to check
on the stranger and found that the barn door had not been opened nor was
there any sign of the stranger even being in the barn.&nbsp; I don't know
if this was true or not but my grandmother swore it was.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Shaking door</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: guinn001@tc.umn.edu</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My experience happened in Dallas, Texas about
15 years ago.&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>living in an apartment, on the second floor, with my father and</b>
<br><b>brother.&nbsp; My brother and I had just moved down there to live
with him</b>
<br><b>and he had not moved from his one bedroom apartment yet.&nbsp; My
brother and</b>
<br><b>I had got the pull out couches.&nbsp; Everyone was sleeping and
I was awoken</b>
<br><b>to hear our cat "Lady" yowling' at the door.&nbsp; He (yes! Lady
is a He)</b>
<br><b>always did that when he wanted to go out.&nbsp; It was about 2 Am
and I</b>
<br><b>wanted him to be quiet so I went to let him out.&nbsp; I got to
the door and</b>
<br><b>hear a funny noise coming from outside the door.&nbsp; We lived
on the second</b>
<br><b>floor with only one apartment across from us.&nbsp; The door started
to</b>
<br><b>wiggle, like someone was trying open it.&nbsp; I cold cold chills
and got</b>
<br><b>real scared.&nbsp; Lady was looking up at the door and still yowling'.&nbsp;
With</b>
<br><b>in seconds the door started to shake so hard that I thought it was
going</b>
<br><b>to come apart.&nbsp; I leaned forward to look out the peephole and
saw</b>
<br><b>NOTHING!&nbsp; You could see directly across the landing to the
other</b>
<br><b>apartment and partially down the stairs.&nbsp; The door was still
shaking but</b>
<br><b>I saw nothing!&nbsp; This all took place in a matter of seconds....&nbsp;
I ran to</b>
<br><b>the living room to wake up my brother and get his help.&nbsp; Just
as I</b>
<br><b>reached him the shaking stopped.&nbsp; I told him what had happened
and he</b>
<br><b>told me to leave him alone and that I was dreaming.&nbsp; I didn't

<br><b>Seen Things Most Don't</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jperessini85@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>throughout my life (hasnt been that long yet) ive felt things that
other people dont realize. i dont think its really an ability but a lot
of people say i have some sort of 'gift'. the first experience i had is
foggy, i dont remember a lot about my childhood cause it was pretty bad,
really bad, but i remember laying in bed and i had a basket of clothes
at the end of my bed, i was really short and my feet were no where near
it, but the basket somehow fell over off the bed against the wall, when
i looked over to see what had done it i saw a pair of red eyes. this really
freaked me out so i think i slept against the wall the rest of the night.
the next morning when i went to check it out, i saw that my toys and lego
that i had set up was scattered around the place, some even under my bed,
and i saw that the clothes hadnt touched it and neither had the basket
cause they were against the wall. i asked my sister if she ever felt anything
there and we both agree that the basement was creepy, i used to play done
there but then i freaked out and wouldnt go down there alone. next experience
i had was when we moved to an older house, about 30 years old. my sister
and i automatically felt 2 presenses and we felt watched all the time,
we would often sleep together, and my sister was 17 and i was 10 and she
was more freaked about it than i was. but she would never leave me alone,
even if she had a shower she would bring me into the bathroom with her,
and if she had to do her 'stuff' in the bathroom she and i would talk through
the door. after she moved out it got a little worse. the TV would turn
on by itself, i would hear my name called by my mom, and when i would check
she actually didnt call me. one night i was laying in bed and i looked
at the door and i saw an almost clear picture of a young woman, i looked
at her for about 5 seconds then hid under the sheets. i fell asleep like
that. the next night i saw the second one, it was older, and i didnt see
the face, but it was darker, and i didnt even bother for details, i hid
pretty fast. the very next day i rearranged my room and they seemed happy
and i kept my room in that arrangement for at least 4 years. also i began
collecting things like stones, fossils, feathers, and even elephants. i
now have a charm necklace that the first night i wore it i had the most
wonderful dream ever. often when i would sit on the floor in the basement
watching a movie i would feel something wrap its arms around me and it
was just a safe feeling. the major experience i had was with my sister
and her friend. her friend was house sitting and she asked if my sister
and i would like to go along cause she said the house was creepy, we agreed.
the moment we drove up to it i knew, i just knew something wasnt right.
when we got out the dog was barking madly out in the backyard. we went
to check on him and found he had no food or water but also that he was
barking at the second floor. My sisters friend Candia, said that she was
going to get some food for the dog and we were welcome to come inside with
her and explore a little. When we got inside Candia went to the basement
door and tried to open it and found it locked, which was rare because thats
where the dog food was and also the owners never locked, and third because
last time she was there it was unlocked. my sister decided that she wanted
to snoop. so we started to walk up the stairs to the second level, by this
time candia had given up on the lock. first was teri, than candia then
me. I started to get an unwelcome feeling about halfway up, and i wanted
to stop, but i was too scared to stand there bymyself, later, candia said
she felt it about all the way up the stairs, and teri said she didnt feel
it until she was in the master bedroom. then teri stupidly said 'it feels
like we're being watched', and thats when whatever it was chased us down
the stairs and out of the house. we even began to drive away with the front
door still open and teri told me to go and close the door, so i ran there
and back. later i found out that the house was one of the oldest one in
the town and that the house beside it had the basement painted red and
that devil worshippers lived there, not the regular kind that worship 'the
horned god', but people who actually thought they were evil etc etc...</b>
<br><b>i often feel energy in museums, places that took intense power to
create, like a valley, or a great example is the drumheller valley or mountains...</b>
<br><b>when i stayed at the famous 'Banff Springs Hotel', my parents were
at a christmas party and i was left to wander the hotel, i know that place
inside out and backwards thanks to four long and boring nights, it often
felt like you were being watched, in the lobby, in a particular area where
theres a spiral staicase that leads nowhere, on the 5th and 6th floors,
and around another spiral staircase. the swimming pool is heated, and usually
is pretty nice and warm, but theres a 'swimming' cold spot, dont ask me
about it cause i never read anywhere about banff springs hauntings about
the swimming pool. and finally in my sisters basement i think i accidently
brought a spirit there when i was writing on the walls. i was writing some
symbols and i felt the need to flee. ive only gone down twice since then
and i took my niece with me. she also complains about 'the blue ghost'
who gets mad if she doesnt keep her room clean. i asked her about it and
she just froze with fear and saying she doesnt like 'the blue ghost'. i
dont know if this has anything to do with ghosts or spirits, but i can
ask the wind to blow, and it will, and in the summer time i can make it
rain. sorry if this a bit long</b>

<br><b>Haunted School</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lovelybeck7@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My school, Kents Hill in Maine, is over a hundred and seventy years
old and</b>
<br><b>is haunted by many ghosts. The most famous ghost on campus is Louise
Green,</b>
<br><b>a ghost that haunts the fourth floor of Bearce, our main building.
As the</b>
<br><b>story goes Louise was a loner at the school and her favorite place
to hid</b>
<br><b>out was the bell tower. Louise was accused (rightly or wrongly)
of stealing</b>
<br><b>from a fellow classmate and she was dismissed from school. Louise
ran away</b>
<br><b>that night to the lake and killed herself. She still haunts the
bell tower</b>
<br><b>today, but she is not harmful. My story is about the night I first
saw</b>
<br><b>Louise.</b>
<br><b>We had a classic piano player come to our school to perform in the
Chapel,</b>
<br><b>which is on the second floor of Bearce. Bearce was hot that night
and it was</b>
<br><b>not long before the heat and soft music made me sleepy. I was half-awake,</b>
<br><b>aware of my surroundings but not focusing on them. My eyes landed
on the</b>
<br><b>doorway of the chapel and I gasped softly. There standing in a long
grey</b>
<br><b>dress was a figure of a hooded women. She looked sad and old, I
knew it was</b>
<br><b>Louise. I stirred my friend next to me and very quietly asked if
she saw the</b>
<br><b>women in the doorway and she nodded. I blinked and looked back at
the</b>
<br><b>doorway to see Louise was gone. All though I have never seen a picture
of</b>
<br><b>Louise I knew the ghost was her and she would not harm us.</b>
