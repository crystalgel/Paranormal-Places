<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>inside the cabin,which sounded like a dog

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">i
have never seen a ghost but have felt the presence of one a few times. it is at
my step brotheres house. i went there because my dad was taking my step mom
out. when i got there we were messing around for a bit , then we sat down to
watch t.v when we heard banging in the bed room above like a ball bouncing. we
experimented with a ball and found the sound was just like that. i was scared
and the room was freezing cold. not because of the ghost because she forgot gas
and couldnt get it anywhere. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">the
next time i went it was worse it sounded like some one had opend the door ran
upstairs the slamed a door shut agen. we both went in the kitchen and the
kitchen door was not open and was no longer locked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">i
went again and this time the telly kept on turning off and the volume kept
going up and down and off alltogether. then we heard shuffleing in the kitchen
like some one messing about in the cupboards but again no one there. that night
i slept over the night but was so scared we slept in the same bed. then in the
middle of the night her dog woke us up staring at a spot in the room then the
banging started again. i have to truley say i was so scarey i would never ever
stop the night again!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Me
and a group of friends went to a small college up in the mountains<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> called </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Mansfield</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-size: 14pt;">University</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At night there was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">nothing
to do so we would sometimes drive a half an hour to an hour or<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">so
to random graveyards in the middle of nowhere.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One night we drove<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">up
to a graveyard which is i think west of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">mansfield</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had been to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">that
graveyard before so we were familiar with the surroundings and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">the
sounds and phenomena that could take place there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">That
night there were a bunch of people who just went along because<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">they
were bored and my<span style="">&nbsp; </span>friends dan and dave,
the leaders of the group<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">believed
in ghosts but didnt really get that scared about anything. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Dave
had an emf detector.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were out in the
middle of nowhere and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">that
night there were no emf alerts from it at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Some
of the people we were with, mainly one girl was very<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">disrespectful,
and while we were there the emf detector started going<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">off
with strong readings, and right about that time we heard a growl<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">or
shaking or both, coming from the graveyard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Needless to say the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">people
that usually werent scared ran to the cars along with me and my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">girlfriend,
and we drove away as fast as we could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">It
turned out later that we found out that the disrespectful girl<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">couldnt
hold her bladder and went to the bathroom in the graveyard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">think
the spirits didnt like that and thats why it happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">the
freakiest night of our lives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We
went back to that cemetary again and nothing happened because<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">unlike
that girl we are always respectful of the spirits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
just wanted to relate this story to you and see if you have<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
was raised by my grandparents in a very small town north of </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Marshall</span></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Texas</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. At the time of my
grandmothers death, I was engaged to a man that I had been dating for a few
years. Obviously, she had known him. In October 1999, two-and-one-half years
after her death, my fianci and I split up and I started dating another man. He
moved in with me in the house I grew up in with my grandparents. About a month
into the relationship, he was sitting in our living room watching television.
He saw me walk by the doorway into the kitchen and asked me to get him a drink.
When I did not respond, he asked again. Once again, with no response, he got up
to see why I was ignoring him. To his surprise, the kitchen was completely
empty. He figured I left the room without his noticing. He came to the bedroom
where I was folding laundry and asked why I didnt answer him when he talked to
me earlier. I told him that I had been in the bedroom the entire time and had
no clue as to what he was referring. He asked if I had changed clothes as well.
When I said no, he became a little edgy. He told me he saw "me" walk
by him into the kitchen. Then he said I was wearing a green t and white shorts.
He also thought my hair was pulled back because it seemed short. What he was
describing to me, was how my grandmother usually dressed when she was alive.
She had short hair and she always sat at the kitchen table to read while my
grandfather watched television in the living room. I told him this and he got a
little nervous. About a week later, he was coming out of the bathroom and heard
his named being called from what used to be my grandmothers bedroom. I only
used this room as storage.. I couldnt yet bring myself to use the room. He
opened the door, thinking I was in there going through boxes and needed his
help. Once again, there was no one in the room. He slammed the door and came
running into the kitchen where I was. He told me he loved me, but my grandmother
was really scaring him. There were instances of us "misplacing" car
keys and the like. I thought long and hard about the things that were happening
and came to a conclusion. I figured that since my grandmother never got to meet
my new beau, this was her way of testing him to see if he was going to be a
good match for me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
had an experience with a friendly ghost for about 12 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I grew up<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">in

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">mid
1970's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a bungalow built in the
50's.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sometime around<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">1979,
may have been earlier than that, the ghost first appeared to my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">mom
during the night in my parents bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The ghost was a man, in his<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">30's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom was the only one who ever seen the
ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My dad and I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">did
not believe her at first, although, I would hear what sounded like<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">someone
walking around upstairs and going up and down the steps but I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">never
thought much of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom would not
tell anyone about the ghost<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">because
she thought people would think she was weird.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The ghost would<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">put
items in different places or she would not be able to find an item<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">for
a long time and then suddenly it would pop up where it was supposed<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">to
be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ghost would go to work with my
mom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She owned a hair salon<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">and

a teenager in the 80's I began to realize the ghost was real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">would
hear him walking around upstairs and going up and down the steps. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
always felt the ghost was around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
like I could feel his<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was never afraid of him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom was making cookies in the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">kitchen
early one morning and he appeared in the diningroom and she<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">would
ask him to go away and he would leave.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He came with us on<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">vacation
one year when we went to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Niagara Falls</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would turn on the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

room lights in the middle of the night while we were sleeping and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">turn
on the radio in the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the longest
time though, my mom was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">the
only one who seen him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, around
1991 when I was 21 years<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">old,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the ghost woke me up one morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was about </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="7"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">7:30am</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> and I woke<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">up
to something touching my face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I opened
my eyes and the ghost was at<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">the
side of my bed and he had touched my face.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My bedroom was now in my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">parents
old room where my mom had first seen the ghost.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was really<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">excited
that I finally got to see the ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
only stayed a few<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">minutes,
like he was just curious as to who I was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was probably in<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">his
30's and he was wearing a hat and had a moustache.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was always<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">with
us the entire time we lived in that house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I moved out in 1993 and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">then
my parents had a new home built in 1995, so since then we have not<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">experienced
any more ghosts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
do not know who lived in that house before us, but I did hear that<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">many
years before we lived in that house, that a young man, who lived in<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">the
house next door was working on his roof and fell off the ladder into<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">what
would be our backyard and died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I'm
thinking maybe that is who<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">the
ghost is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was never mean and never
scared us on purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">kind
of like he was hanging around to be part of a family or something.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
always wonder if he is still in my old house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My
parents bought some undeveloped land in the country in southern </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> in the mid-70s and built a
3 story house (two above ground, one below). Not far away from the land is a
small cemetery - it contained a few infants' and one older person's headstones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess I'm the first to experience our
friendly ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While up late at night
reading, I heard some cabinets in the kitchen right down the hall open and
close - but couldn't see the kitchen light on under my door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I immediately got up and went into the
kitchen and turned on the light. No one was there - and after talking to my
family the next day, no one had gotten up in the middle of the night...my
parents' room was above mine, so I always heard when they walked across the
room and down the stairs and my bros. room was right across the hall- I'd have
run into one of them if they had been up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My family started teasing me about hearing things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My next experience was when I was home alone
- I was in the living room reading . The couch was against the wall with the
stairwell going up.All of a sudden, I heard steps coming down the stairs....I
was so terrified, I slowly looked up, expecting to see a hand on the hand
rail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Getting up my nerve, I walked to
the front of the stairs and no one was there. My father claimed for years that
I was just hearing the walls creak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd
lived in the house for a long enough<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>time to tell the difference in wall creaking and stair walking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My family continued to tease me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Until the day of my brothers' experience.
They were alone in the house, down stairs playing pool.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They heard the front door open and close, and
heard someone walking into the kitchen (above them). They hollared at my dad -
whom they thought it was. When he didn't respond, they looked at each other and
walked upstairs to the first floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
front door was still locked and there was no one in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since that time, my mother has heard several
things, my father has heard a gonging in the house (something you just don't
hear out there), and my parents have both felt someone leaning or kneeling on
the foot of their bed while they were in bed - not asleep. When the light was
turned on, no one was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, they
don't tease me any more<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- we just joke
about </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Casper</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> our friendly ghost. We've never seen him/her, but
have heard plenty of noises he/she makes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Any time I'm visiting now, and am there alone- I always walk in with a
greeting, "Hello, </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Casper</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt;">! I'm home!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">As
the house was built by my parents, and we don't really know the history of the
land, we've no idea who it could be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, I have an experience I would like to share and perhaps
get some answers to my questions. Three of us went to check out the Amity Hall
Inn, listed in your <st1:State><st1:place>Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>
hauntings directory. Two adults and one teen. We didn't intend to enter the
building or take any photos, we just turned around in the parking lot and
shined the car lights on it. We didn't see anything there, but we smelled a
freshly opened can of coffee and an odd smell, like a decaying smell. We were
only there for about 5-10 minutes and left. We proceded back on the highway to <st1:place><st1:City>Lewistown</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>PA.</st1:State></st1:place> About 3-5 minutes after leaving the <st1:place>Inn</st1:place>,
we saw a bright light flash in the passenger side window, but there were no
other cars on the highway at that time. Almost immediately after that, I saw a
hand appear from my rear bumper as if to grab onto something and tag along. I
was startled and then saw an old man's face floating in my back seat. I was
crying and closed my eyes in hopes it would all go away. I calmed down and we
drove a little more. Another bright light directly in front of us zoomed up and
flew over the top of the car. We heard something let loose from the car that
sounded like a large rock hit the rear end. We continued driving and felt like
our hair was full of static like after a balloon is rubbed on your head. There
were tingly sensations all around. It lasted almost the whole trip home. We
pulled in at our local 24 hour grocery store and checked out the rear end and passenger
side of the car. My hub cap looked like someone put an autobody grinder against
it and sanded it in multiple places. We found some scratches on the paint and a
small hand print on the rear passenger window. The hand print was made from the
outside, so it was not made by the teen in the car because none of us got out
of the car until we got to the super market. I have had many ghostly
experiences like ghosts following you rom house to house, but never one that
tagged along on a moving car. Can anyone please tell me what may have happened
and why? </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe I
have been sensitive to ghosts since I was a child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I grew up in a rather odd family, seances,
tarot card readings, tales of the afterlife, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was taught to believe in what I saw and
felt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, here is a story, that truly
occurred back in 1988, in <st1:place><st1:City>Riverside County</st1:City>, <st1:State>CA</st1:State></st1:place>.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was living in a Domestic Violence Shelter in a old home
built about 1880.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night all of us women
were watching movies downstairs, and the restroom downstairs was busy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I went upstairs in the dark, to use the
other restroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well there at the top of
the stairs was a latching gate that was to remain locked at all times, because
of the small children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, I unlatched
the gate and ran to the restroom and proceeded to park myself on the toilet
with the bathroom door open onto the landing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As I was sitting there looking into the landing and hallway I saw the
figure of an elderly woman, in period clothes from the 1800's walk over and
latch the gate that I had left undone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was intrigued, and remained calm, just watching.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then turned to me and smiled, then just disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So when I went downstairs, I asked a counsler
if I could have a moment of her time, and I related what I had just seen to
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said that, yes the house was
haunted by an elderly couple whom they believed to be the original builders and
owners of the home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said that, she
hoped I would keep this to myself because she did not want the others to be
frightened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But she said, that many
people had seen the ghosts and they all felt that they were benign and only
watching out for the children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other
thing that occurred here was that my three year old son began talking and
playing with someone that I could not see.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But to him, this child was very real.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My son would sit out in the backyard apparantly talking to
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Entertaining himself.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">jThe counselers even remarked how well he played by himself
for his age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But upon closer examination
and observation and listening I began to think he could see something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I asked him on day who he was talking to
and he said my friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said where is
your friend and my son said can't you see him?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He's right there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I proceeded
to ask my son other questions<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and he was
adamant, his friend was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So this
leads to a question that I have.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once we
moved into out own apartment, my son insisted that his friend had come with
us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had me set a place at the table
for him and he was always talking to someone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Is it possible that this little ghost followed us to our new
home?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This took place for about a year and a half, then he just
was gone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">To this day, my son who is twenty years old now, and in the
Army, he still tells me his friend was real, at least to him.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I just wanted to share this, maybe get a little feedback.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I love your web-site, and enjoy wandering cemeteries and
takeing pictures of gravestones.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have had many paranormal experiences and would like to
share them with you and your readers from time to time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In June 2000, my husband and I moved into the Treehouse
Apartments in <st1:City><st1:place>Conroe</st1:place></st1:City>. I was four
months pregnant with our first child and really excited to move into a
two-bedroom place. We had the time of our lives decorating the nursery. I
started noticing strange things about three weeks after we moved. I was taking
my afternoon nap while my husband was at work when I suddenly awoke to a child
calling for "Mom." The sound was coming from the nursery. I opened
the door to find nothing out of the ordinary and just dismissed it as our
down-stairs neighbors. The thing was, I happened at <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00</st1:time>. The children downstairs were still in school. We had
a kitten at the time, and he acted as cats do. After that incident, he began to
act very strange. He would hide under the furniture of whichever room he was
in. I had to start feeding him under our bed! We didnt have a washer and
dryer, so we took our laundry to my in-laws house and stayed the night. When we
returned the next day, our television was on. This was strange because the
television was plugged into an outlet that was controlled by a switch. We left
the switch off. When turned on, the TV automatically came on to channel 3. You
had to turn it to channel 4 to get the cable box to work. Also, the channel on
the cable box had been changed. No one else (other than the apartment complex)
had a key to our apartment, so it was really strange that this had occurred. We
never saw anything like a ghost in the apartment, it was just those two
incidents. After that, I had to put the litter box under our bed as well. My
poor kitty would not leave the security of under the bed. One night while we
were sleeping, e cat jumped up onto the bed with us, yowling loudly. We could
not get him calm and he refused to come out from under the covers. We moved by
the end of the week.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have had a few encounters with what I consider to be
ghosts, but this was by far the scariest. In June 2001, my husband, son, and I
moved into Bay Harbor Apartments in <st1:City><st1:place>Baytown</st1:place></st1:City>.
The week before we came, there was a shoot-out between the police and a
resident and that apartment was still boarded up and had many visible bullet
holes in it. Our apartment was a few buildings over - closer to the back of the
complex. A couple of months after we moved in, we started noticing things
happening in our sons room. He was 1 = at the time and still slept in a crib.
The crib still had a mobile, and a toy that played songs and lit up when you
rolled a bar at the bottom of it. John and I were up watching TV one night when
we heard the toy start playing. We went in to see if our son was awake, and he
was sound asleep. We just shrugged it off and went to bed. This same thing
happened the very next night, and again, he was asleep. We decided to put his
crib in our room. It didnt happen again. We eventually took the crib down and
put him in a toddler bed. We put him down for the night and I left our door
open to hear him if he woke up or was getting into anything. I suddenly had an
irresistible urge to check on him. I did not hear any sound coming from our
room, but there was a weird odor in the air. As I came around the corner and
into the doorway, I saw my son standing against the wall. We had a very heavy
lamp on a night table between our beds. The lamp was lying in the middle of the
toddler bed, on its side. The bulb had burned through the shade and was
beginning to burn the top sheet of my sons covers. There was no possible way
the lamp had fallen or been knocked over and landed in that way on his bed. It
was equally as impossible for him to have picked it up and put it there
himself. I removed the lamp from the room and our son began sleeping in the bed
with us. I had his old room set up as a play-room and he would stay in there ll
day long. One morning, he fell asleep on the couch and I left him there for his
nap. I was making my rounds in the apartment doing my daily cleaning. When I
finished his play-room, I shut the door behind me. There was no person or
animal in that room when I left. My sons great-grandfather bought him a toy
that had a motion sensor in it. When it was activated, the toy would whistle
and say "I Love You." As I was in the kitchen washing dishes, I heard
it go off. Thinking my son was awake, I opened the bedroom door. I saw nothing.
I shut the door again and went to check on my son. He was still asleep on the
couch! During the course of his one-hour nap, the toy continuously went off. I
went into the room, grabbed the toy and changed the batteries. I thought this
would solve the problem. It did not. I finally took the batteries out and
removed the box entirely so there would be no way it could come to life again.
The majority of toys that he played with were moved into the living room. No
one ever really went into that room again. I remembered what happened before we
moved in and I went to ask the management if anything similar had occurred in
our apartment. I was told that "management" had recently changed and
the current people had no record of anything happening there. We stayed until
our lease was up and then got the heck out of Dodge!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello! I thought this experience was worth sharing as it
freaked the hell out of me and the few people I have shared it with......</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was nineteen at the time and me and my best friend, Sally,
had just moved into a flat in an old, dilapidated building block of flats.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The flat was a bit run down, but we were really excited
about redoing it and we were so happy to have a place of our own at last. It
was the middle of July, so we weren't thinking of school yet! </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Sally was working at her day job at the local department store.
I was alone relaxing with a cup of coffee in front of the TV in my bedroom.
Despite the hot day outside I found myself shivering, an intense cold air had
filled the room. Suddenly, the end of my bed sank as if someone had sat down
beside me. I was really freaked out and ran for the main room. It was warm
again and I was filled with relief. I didn't tell Sally because I didn't want
to sound stupid. This happened at least a dozen times in the next week. I was
so sick of it I even thought about calling an exorcist, but I knew that I
didn't have much to tell him.``</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night I woke up to find an old man sitting on the bottom
of my bed looking at me. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. Eventually he
disappeared. This happened several nights in a row. I was so freaked out I knew
there was only one man for the job, the retired priest that lived down the
road, Fr.Conway, exorcist extradonaire. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next evening when Sally was out I called Fr. Conway and
he arrived at once. He entered my room and immediately detected an entity. He
lit a circle of candles and placed them on the floor. He called on the spirit
and suddenly I realised I did not want to witness the exorcism. I suppose I was
scared. I waited in the living room until about fifteen minutes later I heard
Fr. Conway giggling and talking softly. I didn't know what to do so I waited
until about ten minutes later when Fr. Conway emerged. He said its going to
take a lot longer than expected and that he will return this time next week.
This went on for the next two months until I finally asked Fr. Conway what was
going on. I demanded to know, I had been afraid to sleep for the past eight
weeks, for gods sake! He finally confessed and told me he had been having an
intimate relationship with my ghost! I couldn't believe it I told him I wanted
him and the ghost out...NOW! He reluctantly agreed and entered my room. He
spoke gently and said, "come now, Albert, its time to go, by the way, I've
got a spacious bedroom...and a double bed." I couldn't believe what I was
hearing. Fr. Conway turned to me and said, "ok, he has agreed to leave
with me, sorry for your trouble." As Fr. Conway bent down to pick up his
candles, I saw a shocking pink thong protrude from his trouser and I saw a
ghostly hand move up his left trouser leg and lovingly caress his left buttock.
Fr. Conway giggled, patting the hand in appreciation, but softly murmured,
"I prefer it at the front." He stood up and left the room. As he
walked through the front door of the flat I noticed a swelling begin to emerge
in his private area... just as if a ghostly hand had answered his 'private'
request. I slammed the door, just as I heard him groan with pleasure with a
smug, self-satisfied expression on his face. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This was truly my freakiest experience EVER<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Man Upstairs</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: jasber666@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The story I am writing to you involves myself and many other
people as witnesses.There were many events that took place in the the same old
brick farmhouse outside of Black Earth, WI.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The first story is one that I will never forget. It was late
in the evening on a summer night, my friends and I were playing a game in the
old farmhouse. Beth, the girl who was living in the house at the time, decided
to go to bed. She went upstairs alone and the rest of us just sat around
talking. Moments later, I heard the most blood-curdling scream ever, and
immediatly after the scream, the wind chime (inside the house) chimed.
Bridget(another friend) ran up to see what was wrong.They both came back
downstairs and Beth told us what happened.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She told us that she was laying in bed and she saw a shadow
of a man in her doorway, she called out "John"? (that is her brothers
name who also lived in the house.) And there was no response. She said that she
thought it was her brother and turned over to go to sleep. Then what happened
next gave me chills down my spine, and I felt very uncomfortable. She said
(beth) that she felt someone crawl into bed with her and she was frozen. When
she reached over she said she could feel someone laying next to her! She tried
to speak but nothing would come out. Beth claimed that the "ghost"
told her to "get out of my room" and that was when we heard her
scream.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That is not the only instance, My sister lived in the same
for a while. She said she never saw anyone in her room, but there were imprints
in her mattress as if someone had been sitting there. She also saw a man with
his head bent down in an old car on the property.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One other night my sister a friend named scott and myself
were having a few beers and scott asked to use the bathroom. We told him it was
at the top of the stairs, so he relieved himself and came back down and told my
sister that she had left her curling iron on, but that he turned it off. A
little later, my sister went to use the bathroom and returned and said that
scott must not have turned off the curling iron because it was on when she went
in there. We didn't think much of it, but when my sister went to the bathroom
again it was turned back on, no one else was in the bathroom between her visits,
and no one else was in the house.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Little Girl Who Wants to Play</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By:ghosthunter001@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This is a personal experience that two of my friends</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and I experienced this phenomenon. I even discovered a</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">photograph of her on the internet. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>It all started about
5 months ago. It was then that</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my friend, Sammy, saw the apparition at his</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">girlfriend's house. While sitting on the couch, he</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">felt a cold draft and turned in the direction it was</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">orienting from. There, he saw a little girl about 4</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">feet tale wearing an off white dress, like the kind</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">that small ladies wore to church in the 1800's. Her</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">blank, black eyes stared at him as if looking into his</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">soul. Her mouth moved as if she was murmuring words,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">but no audible sound was heard. The little girl's</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">spirit pointed her long, narrow, bony finger at Sammy</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and disappeared. The gripping fear encumbered Sammy.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">His girlfriend had to snap him out of the trance.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The next day, he told
my friends Aaron, Brian, and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Steven. They were stricken with hair raising power as</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Sammy dictated his horrible experience.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The three later
decided that he was reciting</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">something from a Steven King novel. They laughed and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">told him their thesis. Sammy warned them that they</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">shouldn't taunt the little girl. They laughed and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">proceeded home. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>About a week later,
Brian was laying his bed deep</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">within sleep. Suddenly, he heard a blood curtailing</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">scream at his window. He looked over, for he had a</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">front row seat to the apparitions performance. She</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">just stood there, beating the window with the palm of</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">her ghostly hand. Brian jumped up, having in mind to</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">wake his brothers, for you see, the two other people I</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">mentioned are his them. They too had heard the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">screaming, and ran to Brians room. There, he</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">explained the chilling events. The brothers then</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">decided that maybe Sammy wasnt lying. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The next day, Aaron
told me what happened. Being a</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">ghost researcher, I decided to assist them in this</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">freak happening of the paranormal. There for about 2</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">months, I never even heard a bump in the night ,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">little lone the murmuring gasps of the little girl.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then, one morning at 5:00 AM, I awoke with a feeling</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">that I was not alone. Suddenly, a cold draft blew</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">through the room, making goose bumps erect upon my</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">skin. I looked in the area between my television and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my dresser. There, the apparition of a little girl</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">walked toward me, murmuring incomprehensible words. I</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">only stared at it, hoping I was deep within a surreal</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">dream. Only one thought came to mind: shine a light</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">upon it. I grabbed the flashlight beside my bed and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">shined upon the little girls face. She continued to</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">step forward, dissolving<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>into a mist from the feet up</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">until completely<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>invisible.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The little girl that
wants to play still haunts the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">four of us. Later, she became accompanied by a large</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">tall black thing in a monk cowl. He only appears</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">rarely, but it is not as hair raising as the little</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">girl that wants to play.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">FROM NOV. 1987 THRU NOV. 1989, I LIVED IN SPRINGHILLS
SUBDIVISION, RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF TOLEDO BEND LAKE, 21 MILES S. OF HEMPHILL,
TX.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I COULD SEE THE LAKE AND THE
LOUISIANA SHORELINE FROM MY BACK DECK.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">SOMETIMES DURING THE NIGHTS I WOULD AWAKEN TO THE SOUND OF
OLD BALLROOM MUSIC, LIKE DURING THE CIVIL WAR DAYS, AND HEAR PEOPLE TALKING IN
A VERY FLUID LANGUAGE I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND, AND I DECIDED IT MUST BE
FRENCH.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>AN OLD TOWN WAS FLOODED, ALONG
WITH THE RAILROAD TRACK THAT PASSED THRU IT, TO CONSTRUCT AND FORM TOLEDO
BEND.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>UPHILL FROM ME, A MILE OR TWO
AWAY, WAS A VERY OLD CEMETERY NAMED ROSEHILL, OR ROSEMONT, OR ROSE SOMETHING.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I WAS TOLD ABOUT ALL THIS, AND THAT THE AREA WAS VERY
HISTORIC, WHEN I RELATED WHAT I WAS HEARING TO A NEIGHBOR FRIEND.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">IT WAS QUITE COMFORTING WHEN I WOULD HEAR THE MUSIC AND THE
CONVERSATIONS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I FINALLY TOLD MY
HUSBAND, WHO LATER HEARD IT TOO, BUT WAS NOT COMFORTED BY THE EXPERIENCE.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I NOW LIVE IN DAYTON, TEXAS, 7 MILES WEST OF LIBERTY,
TEXAS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I AM SURPRISED YOU DON'T HAVE AN
GHOST STORIES INVOLVING LIBERTY, AS IT WAS SETTLED MAINLY BY SPAINISH LAND
GRANTS, THE SANISH AND THE FRENCH.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'VE
HEARD TALES OF SEVERAL HAUNTED HOMES AND THE OLD CATHOLIC "MERCY HOSPITAL
CONVENT".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I KNOW WHERE TWO OF THESE
HOMES ARE AND HAVE HAD AN ACCOUNTING BY A FRIEND OF MINE WHO ONCE LIVED IN ONE
OF THE HOUSES.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THEIR KITCHEN LIGHT WOULD
BE TURNED ON, WHITE POWDERY FOOTPRINTS WOULD BE DOWN THE HALL, AND SHE AWOKE
ONE NIGHT WITH HANDS PRESSING INTO HER BACK.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>THE OTHER HOUSE WAS SAID TO HAVE CHAIRS ROCK BY THEMSELVES, MUSIC HEARD
AND PEOPLE SPEAKING IN FLUENT FRENCH.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>LIBERTY IS A VERY OLD TOWN AND I'M SURE THERE ARE MANY MORE HAUNTINGS
THAN WHAT I'VE HEARD.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">DAYTON:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A BEST FRIEND
OF MINE DIED, AT THE AGE OF ABOUT 23, IN THE EARLY SIXTIES, FROM HODGEKINS (SP)
DISEASE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I HAD A LONG CLOSET ACROSS ONE
WALL IN MY HOME WITH CURTAINS HUNG ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE FRONT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>MY SON WAS AROUND 4 YEARS OF AGE AND HE HAD
THE HABIT OF COMING IN AT NIGHT AND STANDING BY MY BEDSIDE UNTIL I AWOKE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I FUSSED AT HIM FOR DOING THIS AND TOLD HIM
TO WAKE ME, NOT JUST STAND THERE BECAUSE IT SCARED ME WHEN I AWOKE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ONE NIGHT, SHORTLY AFTER MY FRIENDS FUNERAL,
I AWOKE, SAW A FIGURE STANDING BY MY BED, THOUGHT IT WAS MY SON AND IMMEDIATELY
FUSSED AT HIM FOR NOT WAKING ME UP, REALIZED IT WAS WAY TOO TALL TO BE MY SON,
ALL THE CURTAINS ON THE CLOSET WERE BLOWING AROUND AND I SAT UP AND THE FIGURE
DISSAPPEARED. I SEARCED THE ENTIRE HOUSE BUT NOTHING WAS THERE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I THEN REALIZED IT WAS MY FRIEND. I HAD HEARD
WHEN PEOPLE COME BACK TO YOU THEY NEED YOUR PRAYERS, SO, I PRAYED FOR HER AND I'VE
NEVER SEEN HER, IN ANY MANNER, AGAIN.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, again<span style="">&nbsp; </span>,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Point look out stays fixed In My Mind.
Because It was a Very Beautiful Place to work . But, at the same time their was
something really wrong . You Know when you are standing<span style="">&nbsp; </span>talking to someone &amp; for No reason at all
. You get Goose Bumps<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on the Back of
your Neck &amp; a Cold<span style="">&nbsp; </span>shiver washes
over you<span style="">&nbsp; </span>. I worked at Point look out
for Five Years , Under Rob Mathias , &amp;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ranger Hammett . I was employed In the Maintanece section of the Park .
I spent alot of time on a tractor<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&amp;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>working In the Campground
Loops . Hoffman's was where one of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
Main Original<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Burial Grounds Were
Located. .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A lot of the area that was
also Included Is Now under water . The Graves eroded into the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chesapeake Bay Before anything could Be done
to save them .In My first email ,I was referring to the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Old Part Of the Prison war Camp that was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Built to Quarenteen the Confederate Prisoners
that<span style="">&nbsp; </span>had contracted{ small Pox} from
Being Out In the Harsh Environment Of the Prison Camp life . I don't Know
exactly where those Prisoners<span style="">&nbsp; </span>were
Buried. ! All I Know is that day when I was On the Backhoe digging .I was
Renovating an old drainage ditch By the Seasonal Rangers Summer Rental Houses ,
That were Located Just<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1 Quarter Mile
Past the Entrance to the Main Camp Ground on your Left .If you were<span style="">&nbsp; </span>heading South on route<span style="">&nbsp; </span>5<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>.
Their use to be a Brick House that was Privately owned Just Before the two
Houses That I am referring two . , One was rented out &amp; the Other at the
time was vacant. It was waiting to be torn down . I was clearring out a ditch
that went right in front of the Vaccant house . That is the same Location ware
in 1863 the small Pox Hospital Or holding pen was .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had gotten Off the tractor to stop for
lunch . as I stepped onto the ground .I cought the worst smell . It smelled as
though someone had<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Killed a cow &amp;
left it to rot in the sun for a few days . God it was Bad<span style="">&nbsp; </span>, I got Back on the tractor &amp; razed the
Bucket up to see if I had dug up a sewer Line ,Or a dead animal that Had Gotten
stuck In the (Southern Maryland Concreate ) GRAY CLAY .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their wasn't anything their at all.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was told after wards By Joe Smith ,Who was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a Con Aid at the time .Now Retired . That the
Old Pox Hospital was right their . I got a very sick feeling after He told Me
that .<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The time I found the Glass
Marbles<span style="">&nbsp; </span>, I was in Greens with Jim House
. We were Planting<span style="">&nbsp; </span>trees &amp; digging
them Up with a tree spade, well we were about 30 feet over from the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Main Bath House In Greens , We Had just dug a
tree out of Hoffmans &amp; were relocating it to Greens . When Jim opened the
Spades Blades I saw a couple shinny Objects fall to the Ground . I told him to
stop &amp; He &amp; I had Just found three Glass Marbles . They were the size
of a Quorter .<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He Kept One &amp; I took
the others .{ That is when the trouble started<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>for me,&amp; I never thought about it till<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Years later when I was telling some friends
of ours about<span style="">&nbsp; </span>things I had seen when I
worked at the Point.Then I put the whole thing together } .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went Home that Night<span style="">&nbsp; </span>cleaned the Marbles off I Put them away . I
thought they were Neat But I didn't really<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>think any more about them ,except to show my wife what we had found.
That night me &amp; my wife had a vistor . It was about 12 o'clock AM. we lived
in a trailer at the time . In Vally Lee Maryland.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mind you,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>we were a good forty minute drive from Point look out . Well, I was Half
asleep &amp; I Heard foot steps comeing down our hall &amp; then something
grabbed the door<span style="">&nbsp; </span>handle on the Bedroom
door . The knob started shaking wildly!!. Both, me ,and my wife shot Bolt Up
right !<span style="">&nbsp; </span>after that we Had things Happen
off &amp; on<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, Never as Vilant as
that first night !!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finnaly , I Gave

<p class="MsoNormal">In May 2001, i got a job working as a dispatcher for a cab
company..adjacent to our office was the garage. was 10,000 sq feet..this
company also had charter buses....when i 1st started working there..the owner
told me i might hear weird noises..growing up, my father was a truck driver..so
i was aware of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>air brakes<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ticks...ect...but I didnt expect was the
added noises in the garage. This would be my 3rd ghost experience. It all
started on the 3rd night i worked there...my boyfriend had called me on the
phone, when all of a sudden..there was this loud banging noise coming from the
garage..so loud i could barely hear him on the phone..i was working
midnights..so he came up there...by the time he got there..the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>noise had stopped. But the fun had just
begun...we hung out there and about midnight..my boyfriend went to go lay down
in the garage..there was a futon bed just outside the office door...he was out
there about 2 hrs...then he come in the office..in a tad bit of a hurry &amp;
sat down...the look on his face.( Kodak moment )<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>he asked if i had just tried to wake him
up...i told him no...he said<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he was
layin there and someone kept saying " hello" ...then he said he sat
up to put his shoes on &amp; the voice was right in his<span style="">&nbsp; </span>face &amp; sternly said ": HELLO "
! also at that time a driver had called me &amp; asked if we had jumper
cables...i asked my bf to go look....he wouldnt go out in the garage till i
went &amp; turned on the lights....then he told me what happen....i was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>like<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>wow...to cool. then in days after this...i started experiencing...my own
little visits from whom we now called Casper.It was weird i could go out in the
garage and sit by myself....i could actually feel the energy moving..like a
sweeping<span style="">&nbsp; </span>around the room...then he<span style="">&nbsp; </span>would<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>go &amp; knock on things ..his best one was turning on the air
compressor...(.it was unplugged ). Then 1 day Casper must have gotten upset
about something...he started beating on the garage overhead doors...my
boyfriend &amp; my son &amp; myself were in there...between the 2 overhead
doors...was a regular door...when the beating started my boyfriend went out the
regular door...cuz he really thought someone was out there...he open the
door<span style="">&nbsp; </span>no one was there<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but the beating continued.After that..i was
working 1 night &amp; 1 of the bus drivers had come in...we were sittin there
talkin &amp; watchin TV...then all of a sudden the channel changed....the
driver asked why i changed it...i said i didnt...the remote was next to the
TV....i got up changed the channel back...a few minutes later..it changed again
....this went on for an hour....thats when the driver told me that he believed
there was a ghost. I was convinced already.....me &amp; my boyfriend use to
sleep in the garage...when things got quiet.....&amp;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Casper was there with us....back in a corner
of the garage was a portable basketball net....and we would go out &amp; shoot
hoops...then 1 day the basketball vanished...we couldnt find it
anywhere....about 2 weeks later at about 6:30 am...me, my bf,&amp; 2 other
drivers was sittin in the office talking...the door from the office to the
garage was open.....we were sitting there..and we starting to hear a basketball
bouncing...me &amp; my bf looked at each other<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>were<span style="">&nbsp; </span>like<span style="">&nbsp; </span>wtf....we ran out there the bouncing
stopped..and no basketball was anywhere to be found...the other 2 drivers heard
it too, then 1 night..my bf &amp; i<span style="">&nbsp; </span>( as
u can tell my bf spent alot of time with me there cuz of Casper) was sitting in
the office......we were asked not to smoke in the office so we would go out in
the garage...i was on the phone ..i saw my bf grab a cigarette &amp; go into
the garage...when i got off the phone i went out there to join him...but when i
got out there he wasnt there...above the office was rafters used as storage
space...i sat in the chair..i heard someone walkin around up there...i kept
callin for my bf<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>but he didnt answer
me...i thought he was tryin to scare me...i kept callin up to him<span style="">&nbsp; </span>then he came walkin out of the bathroom...i told
him to listen there was some1 in the rafters....he started to go up there ...
he got about 2 stairs up..&amp; Casper ran across the ceiling of the garage...i
mean we followed the sound with our eyes...the we looked at each other and ran
back in the office....there is so many other occurences...that i could be here
all night....but <span style="">&nbsp;</span>thats my story &amp; im
sticking to it....lol i quit that job at the end of summer....last i knew
Casper was still there. Thank you for reading this...Pixie </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't

<p class="MsoNormal">suggests that she did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I think I was three or four at the time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mom heard </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">me talking to someone in the bedroom so she<span style="">&nbsp; </span>came in and asked me who I was </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">talking with and I said Mindy (my twin).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mom wanted to know what we were </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">talking about so she asked what we had been talking
aobut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess it was </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">around our birthday, because I told Mom that Minday wanted a

<p class="MsoNormal">Just over two years ago my darling dad died from two
cancers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he finally died my sister,
mother and I were there holding him as he left this life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hospital window was filled with sunlight,
the radio was playing a classical piece and my father died the way he should,
with family holding him close and not leaving him to die in that sterile
hospital environment where most die unseen and alone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Dad was a Roman Catholic, but one who had lost his faith and
truly believed that after death there was nothing.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My family of three had spent four days and nights at
Southend Hospital, Essex, England, hearing the rasping breathing<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and waiting for my Dad to go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we finally returned to my mothers house,
we were, naturally, talking of what had occured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhausted and drained, my sister and I joked
about how Dad may come back as an angel (we don,t believe in those, we're
british after all!)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that moment, a
large, white feather came floating past the french windows, and landed, oh so
gently, upon the patio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We just looked
at each other and said 'Oh'</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Since then, my non believing father has come through
toharangue my ex partner in a dream. for his treatment of my daughter and
myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Has been seen walking in
Southend High Street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Has held me about
the shoulders after my heart attack (I was only 41 at the time, and when I
was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>recovering, asked him to be there if
I died).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the anniversary of his
death, my daughter saw a white feather and felf the presence of her grandad.
This<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was only after she realised the
significance of the date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My most
previous partner heard my dad telling him to 'Lay off' even though he had never
met him. This man was a total non-believer just like my Dad!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As a woman who has the shadow of the Grim Reapers blade
above her head, it has strengthened my belief that there is life after
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That when I do have that massive
heart attack and leave this earth, there will be someone waiting for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I might be in trouble with my dad, but at
least it will pass the time to be lectured and hugged while I make my way to
that next place!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I grew up in Hawthorne, NJ.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As kids, in the early 60's to late 70's my sisters and I heard doors
slam during motionless days and nights {no wind at all, usually humid and thick
air}. We'd block the attic door with a heavy chair, leave it alone and the
sound of the door slamming was still there after we left it for a few minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no one there to play a trick on us,
it would usually happen when the whole family was downstairs having
dinner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We'd run upstairs to see if the
chair had moved, but it was still propped up next to the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many times we'd hear a flute playing in our
attic, usually around 3 a.m.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever
we'd try to "talk to" the flutist, it would stop and disappear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Never saw any actual ghosts.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When i was around 17 me and my family lived in an old houes
and weird things happened. My mother noticed on the first night we moved in
that it was haunted.She heard someone running down the stairs and when my dad
got up to look me and my brother were both sound asleep.That wasn't to freaky
for me, i have always been interested in stuff like that but there were things
that happened there that did freak me .One time while i was laying in bed
reading my book the lights went out.When i told dad the next morning he was
like oh it was probably a loose wire or something like that.Oh but it wasn;t,
had it been a short in the wires then why was the switch down?? SOmething had
turned my light off.Anyway i moved out of that room and into another.Then a
couple nights later i was reading my book in the new room and the hallway
seemed to be brighter.I went and looked and the light in the bedroom i moved
out of had been turned on.This kinda thing went on for a long time.My brother
had a friend stay over one night and they were both so scared that they slept
downstairs on the coach...one on each end..lol..the friend never came
back.Anyway more about this house.When i was 18 my BF woke me up and he was
white as a sheet asking me if i had seen the man. He seen a man sitting in the
cornor ooking at us while we sleep.Come to find out the old man who lived there
years ago had drowned in the river out back.There was another night me and my
BF were sitting at the kitchen table and a loud and i mean load moan came out
of the bathroom, it was so loud it scared my dog and he ran over and hid under
my legs.Then something shoved the chair i am sitting in right into the table.I
told my parents this when they got home and my father went into the bathroom
where the moan came from to check things out.After that night the dog wound
never go into the bathroom.He followed my dad everywhere and always used to go
in the bathroom with dad when he was shaving but not after that night not even
when dad would call him, he would just stand outside the door and shake.And
also after that night my BF would never sleep over. One night my mom as
awakened but having the feeling someone was looking at her.When she awoke she
seen two red eyes on a brass plate she had got from an older couple that she
had hung on her bedroom wall.Only for a few seconds.When she got up in the
morning she looked at a plate she had dusted many times and never before seen
what she seen after seeing the red eyes....in the plates design she had seen
the face of the devil.She left that there when we moved.When we returned the
keys to the landlord my mom mentioned about it being haunted and they looked at
each other knowing that it was and asked us when we had first noticed it.Mom
said on the first night and that they should have told us before we moved in.My
father was never a believer in ghosts but after living with one and the
experiences we went through he is a believer now.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks for letting me share my story and i want to tell you
that i love your site!!This all happened in a small rural community in Brooklyn

<p class="MsoNormal">My family is one of strong Southern Baptist beliefs. I
myself seem to find myself in the center of supernatural events. One of the
most disturbing is when I lived with my family on Leigh Circle in Fort Smith,
AR. I have always seemed to know when there was something or someone from the
other side around. I just wished that I could have pin pointed what this
feeling was a little sooner. I wish, at least, I could have told my brother
about it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My brother, and we will call him Charles just for his own
sake, had a bedroom in the middle of this house. One night in July of 2002 he
went to bed at his normal time of 9:00 P.M. Suddenly at 10:30 we heard our dog,
Tramp, barking. He was going crazy at the base of the closet door. My brother
was laughing at him from the bottom bunk of his bunk bed. My step-father open
the door to cure his curiosities and he then fled up under the bed yelping. We
just decided to put him in his traveling kennel to calm him down. He then tried
to gnaw at th cage to get free. Once, again something we never thought we would
see from him. About 11:15 he settled down and the whole mess was over. Or so we
thought.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At 5:30 A.M. we were woken up by a shrill scream from my
brothers room. We all rushed in there to find him on the top bunk as far from
the closet as possible. He was almost green and he was shaking very badly. It
took about ten minutes before he could even spit out fragments of sentences. He
told us about a boy that came out of his closet and asked him to come into the
closet to play with him. He told the boy no and that he needed to sleep and
then the boy got angry. His eyes turned red and then demanded my brother to get
in. Charles then climbed the side of the bed to get to the top and as far away
as possible. He was crying and when he looked up he could see the boy's head
peeking at him from the foot of the top bed. This is when he screamed.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My parent's thought at first that he was hallucinating on
the medication he was on for his ADD. They dismissed his story as that and went
about their days. Charles wouldn't sleep again until three days later and it
took 2 months to get him to go back into the room. That very night he saw the
boy again this time he came out from under the bed. My parents then had him
seek counseling to try to correct his "hallucinations." The next day
after the counseling My mother was hanging some of his clothes in the closet
and saw a black shadowy figure slowly coming towards her from the back of the
closet. She heard whispering and she ran. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My brother never slept in the house again and a week later I
moved to Georgia to live with my father. My family moved into another house a
month later. My brother since then has had no "hallucinations." </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I later found out as I got older that my parents moved based
on the findings of a group from their church that knew a good bit about ghostly
phenomena. The scariest part is that this group is held a secret from everyone
except those who need their help. The Bible talks of ghosts and demonic forces
to ignore that these things do exist is to be as closed minded as those who
once believed that the earth is flat.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My story is true and I would like to express a couple of
words to those who disbelieve. Trust me, you don't want to see or experience
what I or my family have seen and experienced to believe the truth of the
spectral realm. It would behoove you to just believe and understand. That way
when it does happen you wont have to deal with your world closing in around
you.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've had two experiences.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first was around midnight when i was going to bed for the night. My
husband was already in bed asleep since he had to get up so early to go to
work.As I opened the bedroom door, I left it open as I usually do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went into the bathroom to change into my
gown so I wouldn't wake my husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
I came out of the bathroom, the door was closed shut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wondering how that happened, I grabbed the
knob to open the door again and as I tried to open it, there was a great
resistance on the other side of the door that wouldn't let me<span style="">&nbsp; </span>open that door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sure someone was in the house, I awakened my
husband and told him what happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
got up and tried to open the door and the knob turned and opened easily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I grabbed a bat and we searched the house
over and our house alarm was not alarming so we wondered how anyone could get
in with out the alarm sounding.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Second:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Around four in the morning I got up to go to the bathroom,
my husband had been gone to work about an hour or so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While sitting on the toilet, the dimming
switch turned the lights down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I reached
up to turn the switch back to brighter lights, I saw an older woman walking
away from me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had her white hair in
a bun on the back of her head with an apron tied around her waist in a neat
little bow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was a short kind of
chubby woman, whom I didn't recognize.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She never turned to let me see her face but I saw her walking into a
purplish, blue haze.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next thing I
knew, she was gone and I haven't seen her since.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but we have heard the toilet flush without
anyone being in there.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, my name's Sarah, i'm 18 years old, i'm from Melbourne, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Australia.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My house has been a constant for many ghostly and spiritual
experiences as </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">it is situated 100m from my town cemetary. Everyone in my
family has seen a </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">ghost although we have all seen different ghosts and non of
the others. For </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">example my dad and one of my sisters have seen (on different
ocassions) a </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">young girl. She appeared to my sister one night as she was
coming up our </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">driveway, the girl stood in the garage, in the dark. As my
sister drove </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">closer to her she disappeared as all our ghosts tend to do
when we look </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">closer or take a second look. My dad saw this same girl
standing inside the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">house at the front door. No other family members have seen
this young girl.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Myself and my mum have both seen an old man. When i was
little i was told to </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">go do my teeth before going to bed. To do this i had to walk
through one </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">doorway and across the hall. As i left the safety of the
doorway i saw and </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">old man in tweed walk directly past me and through the wall,
i haven't seen </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">him since. A few years later my mum was up late watching tv
when she glanced </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">beside her, an old man was watching tv with her. When she
looked again he </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">was gone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My other sister (the oldest) has only ever reported seeing
one ghost; she </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">woke one night to see a teenage girl watching her sleep. She
got a shock and </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">shut her eyes...only on this occassion, when she opened her
eyes again, the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">teenage girl was still there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am the most open-minded about ghosts and supernatural
experiences and so i </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">experience more 'strange happenings' than the rest of my
family. When i was </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">a very little girl i had a pet rabbit that lived inside, she
was very cute </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and unfortunately died a short time after i got her. A
couple of weeks after </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">her death i was standing in the kitchen when i had the urge
to look down at </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my feet, there, looking up at me, was my little bunny. it
didn't register at </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">first and i only realised that i has seen her ghost when i
went to do a </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">double-take...but she had vanished. i was happy to know she
came to say one </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">last farewell.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night i was in my usual light sleep in my bed when my
arm flopped out </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">from under the covers, quite normal for me! I awoke to
discover someone </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">poking my hand, as if they did not know what it was. When i
actually opened </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my eyes i saw nothing and the poking stopped. i had never
dared to speak to </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">these ghosts and so i decided this would be a good time to
start. "Can you </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">do that again please? That felt really cool..." i kept
my eyes open, nothing </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">happened. So i gave up and closed my eyes; as soon as my
eyes </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">closed...*poke, poke* on my hand. I smiled and went back to
sleep.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I also had quite an angry ghost in my room once, he stayed
for quite some </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">time. It was after doing a seance by myself (highly stupid
thing to do) when </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i was 15 and didn't research it fully and was just plain
stupid. Seeing as </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">though nothing happened on my make-shift board i lifted my
hand off the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">glass, therefor not ending the seance properly and forgot
about it. It was </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">only when i had a terrible flu that i realised that a man
was 'trapped' in </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my room. One particular night i was having a terrible
coughing fit when all </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">off a sudden a deep, gruff voice yelled "SHUT
UP!!" understandably my </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">coughing fit stopped! After that things in my room were
moved- a drink </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">bottle on my bedside table would suddenly be on my desk...i
would never see </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">them move, but the did get moved, and not by any of my
family members.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Also, sometimes early in the mornings i hear little feet run
up and down my </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">hallway outside my room, they stop at my closed door and i
sometimes hear a </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">little girl giggle mischieviously. i'm the only one in my
family that has </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">heard them and i'm the only one who has seen more than one
particular ghost.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i hope this has been an interesting letter and hopefully
i'll be able to </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">tell you another story of an encounter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I once lived at a house in Ventura California, on the corner
of Maine Street and the Avenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
called the Mission plaza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lived in a
two story town house with my mother and her boyfriend, my bedroom and my
mothers was right over our two car garage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother saw a man walking from my room to the bathroom upstairs when
she was the only one home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would hear
our cars honking in the garage, and dishing falling into the sink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They're was another time when I was younger
living in the house I woke up to the feeling of someone watching me, and woke
up to see a black figure, a man looking at me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was tall, had the shape of a Indian i can see the out line of
feathers in his hair and what seems to be a skirt he was wearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were times my bed would shake as i did
my homework, my lights would flicker and my friends felt a cold and
uncomfortable feeling when the spent the night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Visitors would see lights flash by from the stairs to the other side of
the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother pulled out of the
garage to see a man sitting in the passenger seat, a tall Indian looking man.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">wetumpka - older haunted house - the home of some of our
relatives has been in the family for about 3 generations some of our family
live in the house today. the first owners of the house were my great grandparents.
my great grandmother<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and grandfather
have been dead for abut 23 years. the man that lived there before my great
grandparents told of visits by a strange man that would greet him and knock on
the door then leave, but everyone thought that he was dreaming. then my
grandparents moved into the house and saw the man for themselves but the man
had been dead for a while and we still see him occasionally today. The
following is a list of occurrences that have happened:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">1. My grandparents also saw a black cat that would be seen
in the doorway of the laundry room still today see that cat in my house which
is 5 houses down.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">2. My grandmother was asleep and was awakened by a man
standing in the doorway of the bedroom and when she looked at him he said hello
Rosie and she could describe him well and he turned around and walked out.when
she got up to check the dorrs they were all locked from the inside.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">3. both my grandparents had company over and as they were
visiting in the living room the same man walked into the living room and said
good evening then turned around and walked out.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">4. At night they would see the chair rocking when nobody was
in it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">5. Skipping on to when both of my grandparents had died my
uncle and his family had moved in. my same grandmother that had died was
standing in the kitchen in her red apron when my cousin walked in. that
occurrence has happened more than once.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">6. My cousin who now lives there was sitting in her room by
herself when a shoe when flying across the room.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">7. My cousin also once saw the same man that my grandmother
had seen.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">8. At my house down the road I have had numerous occurrences
when it feels like someone is playing with my hair and straightening my covers
but there never is anyone there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">All of these things that<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>have happened still happen to day!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: pjmyer@yahoo.com </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have a couple stories that happened to me when i</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">first went to Camp Pendleton. The first two happened</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">in my barracks room in 1999. The first I was sleeping</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">one night and I woke up in the middle of the night</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">like I usually did, but this night I saw a figure</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">standing at the end of my bed, I automatically thought</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">it was my roomate being weird so I said what are you</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">doing go to bed. Then my eyes adjusted and I realized</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">it wasn't my roomate but a male figure that was just</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">pretty much a white powder like figure that dissapated</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">when I sat up. The second story took place in the same</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">room, it was a regular weeknight and my roomates and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">myself were sleeping well at least I was just drifting</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">off to sleep when while my eyes were closed it was</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">like someone flashed a red light in my eyes. Thinking</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">it was one of my roomates I was mad and when I looked</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">there was a bright white light in a orb form over the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">sink area. I was so shocked I couldn't speak to wake</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my roomates, the only thing I could do was stare. It</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">would get bigger and bigger then shrink back down the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">grow and shrink, I finally covered my head with my</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">covers and then looked again, it was still there. I</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">can't really be sure but it was there for at least 20</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">to 30 minutes, I actually didn't feel threatened or</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">anything and I actually went back to sleep. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The third is when I moved out of the barracks, I was</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">married and in base housing. This actually happened</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">mainly to my wife I only witnessed one account to her,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">we were watching haunted travels week on the travel</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">channel and my wife went to check on our son who was</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">sleeping and when she came back down the stairs the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">bathroom door slammed with a very hard force when she</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">reached the last step. Just to clarify that particular</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">door is light so you would have to use a lot of force</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">to slam the door the way it did. My wife also has seen</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">shadows looking into our room from the stairway and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">also walking from her closets to mine and figures</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">standing in our room, but no actual physical</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">encounters. I really haven't shared these accounts</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">except to a few people but I have heard other people</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">tell of ghosts while on Camp Pendleton. Thanks for reading.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I lived in a house there in Astor, and on 3 separate
occasions, there was a</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">ghost man in my house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The old timers confirmed what I saw, after I had asked a few
questions.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The first time was 3 days after my ex-husband and I moved
into the house,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and we were sleeping on the dining room floor, as we didn't
have our</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">waterbed hooked up yet. I woke to find a large man in
overhauls and a red</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">plaid shirt, leaning over on a pedestal, overlooking our
bodies, just</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">watching us sleep, and I was watching him.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The second time I walked around him in the bathroom, felt a
cold brush</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">against my shoulder and I said excuse me. (kind of freaked
me at this point)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The third time was when we were sleeping on the couch in the
room near the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">kitchen, I woke to see his wife was standing in front of us
on the couch.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She was hollering at him, I could not hear her, but she had
a gun. I saw her</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">point it at him, as he was standing at the other end of the
couch in the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">doorway, and she fired a shot at him that was like a
buckshot. It was ear</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">piercingly loud, and my ears were ringing. I looked at him
and there were</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">several holes in the wall and in him. When I looked back,
she was not there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">While I was watching this happen, I remember thinking that I
would lay</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">completely still, so she would not see us there. I was sooo
scared!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>My ears rang for a
couple days after that happened.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Later, I found out by the old timers in the neighborhood,
that this man</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">dressed the same way, and that his wife killed him because
she found out he</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">had cheated on him. I heard that it happened in the garage,
but when we</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">lived there, there was no garage.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We moved out the same week.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I'm not scared of ghosts, as there is always a story behind
them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">"Westfield - Pine Hill Cemetery - Something haunts the
back hill of this cemetery. During the day visitors have reported a mans voice
in the woods, and the feeling of being watched. At night, the watchful feeling
changes to one of absolute unreasonable terror. Even going on the public street
that runs right beside the hill will cause this...even some people who live on
that street have complained of feeling uneasy, as if something is watching out
for that portion of the cemetery and will not tolerate ANYONE trespassing. A
few reports of rocks being thrown at cars passing that area have also surfaced,
but are rare."</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I live in westfield ma, last
night around one, my friend and i were driving by the cemetary. we had both
read this a few months prior, so we thought we'd check it out for ourselves. we
walked in the opening to the far left side and made our way tword the back of
the cemetary. about the third or fourth path you can take into the cemetary we
took to look at this huge tombstone that caught our attention tword the center.
not five steps past that grave, my feet froze to the ground and a wave of utter
uneasiness came over me. my heart jumped and i looked at my friend. he was
looking back at me and said he felt cold and his arms were numb. we didn't stay
long to investigate, we kind of felt like we were being shoved out extremely
unwanted. both of us were numb but it was a beautiful night. this feeling
stayed with us untill we got off of the main road and into our car. when i
opened the door i swear i saw someone walking along the fence but when i looked
again it was gone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I have aother story to
relate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have had many paranormal
experiences in my life so far.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I enjoy this web-site and also
enjoy being able to tell of my experieces.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In 1987 my husband, seven year old son, and barely two year old son
moved into a house in Santa Ana, CA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
woman who rented to us, had a beautiful rose garden in the front yard and
wanted someone to tend them. That turned out to be my job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it turned out,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>this womans husband had very recently passed
away..While living he had done all kinds of special inovations to the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hidden doorbells, panelling the
family room, etc..</p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Anyway, this woman went out after
her husband died and went to Las Vegas for a weekend and ended up coming home
married to a man that I had the impression, was a gold-digger just wanting her
money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it seemed like she didn't
realize this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, we rented the house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">We signed a six month lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as we moved in and got settled
strange things began to happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it
seemed that I was the only one experienceing these things.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The first thing that happened
was, the headboard of my oldest sons bed, which was bolted to the frame of the
bed, started slamming against the wall.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This woke me up one night it was so loud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went into the kids room and they both were
asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the headboard was hitting
the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I got a couple of towels
and rolled them up and stuck them between the wall and the headboard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The I went back to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not even five minutes later I could hear the
headboard hitting the wall again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
husband was dead to the world,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
couldn't wake him.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">So I went back into the kids room
and the towels were on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
freezig in the room and I felt like someone was in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I said, Whoever you are, we mean you no
harm,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Please stop messing with my sons
bed, please leave my children alone, there innocent, we moved here because we
really like the house and if your the husband of the lady who rented to us,
please understand, we only want to take care of your special home.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">After that, there was no more
noise from the kids room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, The next
thing to start happening was that out clothes that my husband and I took off
before bed and laid on a chair or in my husbands case, the floor, began to be
wet and sticky every morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the
floor or the chair were never wet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just
the clothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This went on until we
moved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then<span style="">&nbsp; </span>one morning I was taking a shower,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the bathroom had a mirror over the sink and
also had a full length mirror behing on the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got out of the shower and was drying off
when I looked into the mirror over the sink, and i back of me was an old man
stareing back at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I fled the
bathroom, scared out of my wits.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">After that occurance, even
stranger things began to take place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
this time my husband had begun to believe me when I told him all of the stuff
that was taking place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first he
thought I was being mental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
livingroom and kitchen at the front of the house were always freezing
cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I always felt weird sensations
when I was in these rooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the
lights started going on and off whenever I was cooking dinner or doing
dishes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the cupboard doors began
opening and slamming shut, totally out of control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This scared me and I said in Jesus name
begone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still this continued to
happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So being completely creeped out,
and mind you I have all of my life had contact with different spirits, just
none as mean and evil as tha one was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
my husband and I decided that it would be best to move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believed the ghost to be the owners dead
husband and that he was angry at her for remarrying so suddenly and for renting
out their home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we found a new place
to live and moved out without letting the landlord know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We broke our lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing ever came of that thank God.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">But o the last day we lived
there, while I was waitting for my husband to come back with the U-Haul truck,
I was in the kitchen packing dishes, which I had left till last because I hated
being in the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of the sudden
the screen door slammed, the lights went off<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and all of the cupboards started opening and slamming shut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I freaked out and ran outside and sat on the
lawn until my husband came home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Never,
before or since have I ever experienced something so scary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This man ghost did not want us there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Period.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I think he was a poltergist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Things always came up missing.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The house was always cold.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">And I always felt like I was not
alone, even though I was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Creepy.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Well, thanks for letting me
share.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I have really enjoyed your web

I have been sensitive to spirits since I was 2 1/2 when my mother and I were in
a car accident and she was killed. I suppose some people would think I'm nuts
but I figure there's worse things to be :)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Originally I am from Tallahassee
Florida and for over 10 years I lived in my Grandparents house in a area of
town called Indian Head Acres. I think it was an old Miccosukee or Seminole
Indian village. When my Grandmother was alive she would see things in her
house. Of couse nobody would believe her and chalked it up to her age. I never
saw anything while she was living but after she died I lived there with my
daughter from 1989 to 1998. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">What we experienced were mostly
sounds and feelings at first. I would be outside and hear the old metal blinds
making noise like someone was climbing in or out of the windows. Sometimes I
would feel something touch me on my shoulder or catch glimpes of white
transparent things in the corner of my eye. I was telling a friend of mine
about it over the phone and the phone would make a terrible noise as long as we
talked about it. Once we'd stop the noise would too. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">We had a fire in 1989 and lost
everything but rebuilt the house pretty much exactly like it was before. The
house fire was purely an act of a living human. My ex-husband.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">After just me and my daughter
were there alone we both felt a presence there most of the time. And most of the
time it was a comforting feeling. I just felt like it was my Grandmother
watching over us. But one night while watching tv alone I got the strangest
feeling I was being watched from behind me. I turned around and saw a dark
figure sitting at my kitchen table looking at me. I was scared. So I just
turned back around and tried to ignore it. But very hair on my head and neck
was standing up. I ended up leaving the house that night because I was so
freaked out until I calmed down. Then I had a dream that night it was chasing
me through my house. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I was flying in a white gown and
it chased me all over the place until I turned around and flew right into it.
Then I woke up and never felt it there again. In my dream I was terrified.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The last experience I had there
was in 1998. I was getting remarried to a wonderful man and he and I were
surfing around on the web and I got tired of it and just happened to look into
my kitchen. The light was off in there but I saw a white globe like thing and
it got brighter. I told my soon to be husband to look (just to see if he could
see it too) and he did. As we looked at it I was so happy someone else could
see it and I felt elated and just felt happy. All of a sudden the globe got
bigger and we saw a man's face appear in the globe of light. He looked around
but never really looked at us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then it
was gone. My soon to be husband got scared I think and he closed his eyes. Then
I swear I felt it coming closer to me even though I couldn't see it. I felt it
pass right through me. It was cold like the other cold spots in the house. But
then it was gone. That was the strangest thing that I ever felt there. The
house has been sold now but I know there was something in there. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Another time I had a friend over
and we were talking and a small glass vase lifted up and smashed on the carpet
like someone did it on purpose. The carpet was very cushy so I have no idea how
it could have broken into so many pieces like it did. It was very odd. Like I
said most of the stuff wasn't very exciting and I wasn't sure if I was losing
it or it was really happening. Alot of the stuff was like things being moved
where I couldn't find them until later and just the glimpes of something moving
and my dog would follow them across the room. That made me feel better too
because I wasn't the only one seeing that either. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Then I moved to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Georgia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
We lived right next door to Kenesaw Battlefield. Once I saw what looked like a
soldier standing there. He grabbed his chest and fell to his knees then fell
forward and was gone. Another time I was home alone and very clearly heard a
girl's voice say 'hi'. No radio was on or tv. I looked around and saw nothing.
Where we live now has been quiet so far..knock on wood.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I wonder if I could just be some
kind of magnet to spirits or something because I have had stuff like that
happen to me most of my life. I don't tell most people about this because I
don't want them to think I'm crazy or something. Anyway, that's some of what
I've experienced.</p>

kinds of things happen around them if you would.</span><br>
