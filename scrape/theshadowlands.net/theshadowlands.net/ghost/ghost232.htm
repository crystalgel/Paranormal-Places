<BR><B>Murmers in the Night</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sweetmandalee@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>In the summer time, I go to visit my dad, step mother, brothers and
the rest of my family in Michigan. They live in a very small place as well
as I do. But now, when I visit, there is a new element that I expect to
happen other than seeing family and friend. My cousin and I hear the "not-so-there-people"
It really all began about 3 summers ago, we were up late one night and
we kept hearing people murmuring. We searched the intire house, looked
at all the t.v.'s, radio's, and checked for everyone to be in bed. Nobody
lives within a mile of them. And no one was around, it was about 1 am,
this nightly visit went on for about a hour and a half. This continued
the 2 months I was there.Until finally one night, the night before I left
back home, I got very brave, stood up and said," Where are you in a calm
soft tone" so I dont wake anyone up other than Amy &lt;my cousin> who was
already awake with me. All of a sudden the murmers stop and in a low throaty
tone we heard," Outside...come on, come out here." We both froze, but I
didn't feel threatend by them. Once again I heard murmers and laughter.
So, I went outside, as I walked out there, I froze once again. Out there,
about 200ft. I would say, there was a bright red truck with it's headlight
on, and about 5 teenagers sat there, pale, staring at me, until one of
them smiled and said," Come on." I could see them , but barely, they were
all very faint and see through, plus it was dark and ectoplaysm circled
them. All of a sudden, my Dad burst through the door, he startled me and
I turned to him, and looked back but they were gone. Amy told him what
was going on. Later, Michael, my other cousin and former owner of the home
had told me that a group of teenagers would come there late at night into
his barn and engage in premiscuise &lt;can't spell, sorry!> events. But
one night, they were all sitting in the back of the truck drinking, and
a drunk driver swirved and hit the car, killing them all of impact. This
made me cry. I am usually not a really emotional person in public, I am
still confused what made me cry. The fact that they were killed so young,
that they are unsettled, or what.Anyway's, it happend, to this day Amy
and I still hear them murmering, and laughing, but it get's fainter every
summer. Whenever I hear them, I go out to see if they are there, but they
never are. If you can tell me, why Amy and I are the only one's who hear
them, and I can no longer see them, please email me, I am despreate to
know.</B>

<P><B>She Could See</B><B></B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Before passing on herself my mother said she could see those who
had since</B>
<BR><B>passed on.</B>
<BR><B>She was very ill, and as such only had months to live.</B>
<BR><B>To this day I don't know if she was hallucinating because of her
illness, or</B>
<BR><B>if she actually saw people/ghosts. She would clearly name them.
That much I</B>
<BR><B>do know.</B>
<BR><B>It was quite unnerving at times to watch her.</B>
<BR><B>My mother in law has also passed away. She's been gone for about
13 years</B>
<BR><B>now.</B>
<BR><B>We have a portrait of her holding my wife when she was just an infant.
It was</B>
<BR><B>hanging in the basement this past year. Something spooked our dog,
and she</B>
<BR><B>began barking &amp; growling. She's a Labrador, &amp; never does
that unless</B>
<BR><B>threatened.</B>
<BR><B>When I went downstairs she was growling and actually jumping up
towards the</B>
<BR><B>painting of my mother in law. I thought it was odd that the dog
would</B>
<BR><B>suddenly bark or growl at an oil painting.</B>
<BR><B>She never did that again</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>First of all, i would just like to say that i LOVE your site and
keep up the</B>
<BR><B>good work. Anyway, i've always been too lazy too write my ghost
stories to</B>
<BR><B>you, but hey...Look at me now.</B>
<BR><B>Alright, it all started 6 years ago. Me and my fammily moved in
a new house.</B>
<BR><B>The house we had bought had been abondoned for 4 years. The second
day we</B>
<BR><B>were in the house, my mom told me someone had been killed. Quite
a shock.</B>
<BR><B>The lady had been killed in the upstaisrs bedroom...She had been
killed by</B>
<BR><B>her husband. Her husband had some kind of problem, i don't know
the datails.</B>
<BR><B>But what i do know, is that he killed him with a sledghammer. Yerk.</B>
<BR><B>I never really believed in Ghosts, until i saw one. One night, i
woke up. I</B>
<BR><B>was sleeping upstairs during that time.. My door was opened. That's
when i</B>
<BR><B>saw her. She was tall, and was wearing a white dress. I was scared,
so i</B>
<BR><B>just went back to sleep. The next day i asked my neighbour about
the girl,</B>
<BR><B>since he knew her. He told me she was chinese... And i remember
seing her as</B>
<BR><B>a chinese!</B>
<BR><B>My sisters friend came over to sleep over once, and she said she
saw the</B>
<BR><B>lady walking in my house's hallway.</B>
<BR><B>I've never see HER since. But a couple of months ago, i bought the
Ouija</B>
<BR><B>board. (that thing is Evil, i swear). I ended uo talking to the
man who</B>
<BR><B>killed her. He was mean. I tried to talk to him, but he kept on
going to</B>
<BR><B>"goodbye". And then i asked him why he didin't want to talk to me..
he said</B>
<BR><B>he wanted me to talk to him during the night.. I was scared, so
i didin't.</B>
<BR><B>That night i had troubles breathing in my room. And i had a nightmare
that night too.</B>
<BR><B>A couple of nights ago, i was in my room.. Trying to get some sleep
when i</B>
<BR><B>heard a soft voice say "Pete".. That's me name. I was a bit scared..</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for reading.. Sorry if i bored you.</B>

<P><B>So Very Cold</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sweetmandalee@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>A few years ago, when my mother was still married to my half sisters
father, we went to stay at my grandpa and grandma's house in Tx. for the
summer. &lt;Like we alway's did and still do> I had to be about 7-8 and
my ex. step sister, and my cousin were sleeping in a room with me. I was
in a bed on my own, and both of them were sleeping in the only other bed,
a queen. Both bed's were located on opposite side's on a huge room. Anyway's,
that night we all layed there, chatting, but falling asleep at the same
time, when they went into their own convorsation and I started to doze
off when I hear in a faint, high-pithced voice, " I'm cold..."&nbsp; It
sounded like it was right beside my bed. I wasn't afraid because I thought
that it was one of the girls wanting a blanket. So I said, " Well, Grandpa
will get upset if I get out of bed to ask him to turn on the heater any
higher, but I'm very warm, so you can have one of my blankets." &lt; I
thought this was odd because it had to be at least 75* in the room> so
once again I heard a girl, she said," Thank you, I am so very cold." I
started to slowly push my comforter off the bed as I felt someone pulling
at it. It was so dark, because they live in the country,&lt;no street lights
or anything> that I couldnt see a thing. After she had took the blanket,
I said to her, who I thought was one of the girls," Now you better get
back to bed before we both get into deep trouble." Then, I heard her say,"
Thank you again, I am so cold..." And I said," Where are you anyway's?
I cant see anything, it's to dark, put you hand on mine and I moved my
hand around until I felt a deathly cold hand on top of mine. I said," My
goodness! You are cold!!" And I heard, "Yes, but I feel warmer now." We
said good night again and I woke up the next morning and continued like
every morning. We all went into the room to make our bed and I said," Hey,
I need my blanket back to make my bed,ok?" They looked at me very confused
and said," What?" And I "reminded" them about last night and a pale expression
came over there faces. I knew they weren't lying because they looked just
to serious and frightend. They told me it was not them, that they had moved
into a different room and to continue their convorsationg,they didnt want
to keep me up. There was no other women in that house besides my mother
and grandmother who would never ever do anything like that to me. I was
terrified, but there was still a small part of me that believed they did
it... until that night. We heard a knock on the door and it was our neighbor
in tears, screaming," Josie is dead!! She's dead!!" my mother and grandmother
broke into tears, my grandpa and step dad tried to calm her down. My cousin,
sister and I had no idea what was going on, we didn't know any Josie, but
they certainly did. Through all the panic, she managed to scream and cry
out,"She was playing hide and seek with her father, and hide in the meat
freezer, the door must have slammed shut on her because when we found her,
huddled up in a corner, she had froze to death!" At this point the other
girls and I screamed and started crying. We have never ever told anyone
this story. And we never found that comforter. I like to believe she took
it with her to heaven, that I helped her in some way. Maybe, hopefully,
she is finally at peace now.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Great Grandfather</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pwilfert@rogers.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I had a ghostly experience happen to me this past Christmas. As my
mothers house was full for sleeping arangements, my two children and I
opted to go to my grandmothers apartment for the night. After we arrived&nbsp;
the conversion turned to talk about spirit guides and angels ( as eight
year olds are curious about such things) and my grandmother told us that
her father ( who passed when I was two ) often knocks to let her know that
he is around. Around 10:30 we went to bed, the bedroom door was closed
as to not let the cat in the room as was the window. About 2 or 2:30 I
awoke to the sound of wind chimes , my 14 year old daughter heard it as
well. She fell back asleep soon after and as I lay there someone sat at
the end of the bed right on my feet! I popped my head up, there was nothing
there. When I lay my head back down I felt them get up off the bed. Maybe
it was my great grandfather checking up on me! I really believe in such
things as all the women in my family have seen or felt a ghostly presence
one time in their life.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Gravity Road</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bepplerh@ns.neiu.k12.pa.us</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello my name is Rose and I from Pennsylvania</B>
<BR><B>my experience is called gravity road I know u probably of heard
this story before but in a different state.</B>
<BR><B>Well the way the story goes a long time go in carbondale there were
trains that ran back through the woods i mean trains ran almost everywhere
around here because of the coal mines. well anyways one there was a bus
load of children and the bus got stuck on the tracks and they were all
killed.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well here's my experience my friend Maygan was
the one who told me about this her and her friends that live up there do
it all the time well we were just new friends at the time and she told
me all about gravity road and asked me I wanted to go now I that type person
who has to see it too believe yeah know so we got in the car and went we
also had my friend Jay with us</B>
<BR><B>well as we were getting closer to the place the car was starting
to get cold and we had the heat on well that freaked me out and I made
her turn around and go back i didn't want to do it I told her about these
things I've read about spirits everything yeah know and what I felt didn't
feel right.&nbsp; So she told me why don't we get to of her friends so
I wouldn't have to sit in the backseat by myself yeah know and we did and
this kid has done it about 50 million times so we went back up and when
were getting closer to that spot again it got cold but as we closure it
was freezing i mean freezing I thought it was just because yeah know it
was winter but we had the heat on full blast and it was cold so i a little
freaked out by now .&nbsp; now the way the road goes it's like a camal
back and in the middle are the tracks now what you do is put your car in
neutral and the kids push it up the hill off the tracks.&nbsp; well we
did it the first time with maygan in the drivers seat and sure enough the
car moved i really didn't believe it because maygan has done it so I thought
they were playing a joke on me, so then Jay got in the drivers seat and
the car started to move but it got really cold and you can now here the
train coming , and then maygan started to freak me out because all she
kept saying there mad at us there mad at us and her friend that she had
his eyes turned red bright red and he started acting really by that time
I was scared shit less and wanted the hell out of there and as soon as
we got pushed off the tracks and almost hit head on by an on coming car
, we haven't been back to gravity road in awhile I don't think I will go
back.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Several Encounters</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Simone16@btopenworld.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi,</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I have a story that happened to me in fact several encounters.&nbsp;
I have been</B>
<BR><B>told i am very sensitve to spirits,</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; A few years ago i lived in a bungalow with my two children.&nbsp;
A few months</B>
<BR><B>after moving in i woke up abrubtly to find an old man in a black
suit</B>
<BR><B>standing at the bottom of my bed just staring at me.&nbsp; This
was at 4.00am but</B>
<BR><B>for some reason i never bothered about it and went back to sleep.
About a</B>
<BR><B>week later my sister was babysitting and when i got back my sister
had told</B>
<BR><B>me both the children on seperate occassions (who had seperate bedrooms)
woke</B>
<BR><B>up crying that there was a creepy old man that had woken them in
their</B>
<BR><B>bedroom, so my sister comforted them as best she could then told
me.&nbsp; I had</B>
<BR><B>never really thought about what i had saw so never thought to mention
it to</B>
<BR><B>any one especially not my children who were 2 and 4 at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I then</B>
<BR><B>told my sister about what i had seen and the children had described
the man</B>
<BR><B>i saw. I mention it to a physcic who told me to just tell him to
go away,</B>
<BR><B>which i did.&nbsp; then it began oh boy a NIGHT MARE things started
happening</B>
<BR><B>more and more and getting more aggressive,&nbsp; night after night
i was being</B>
<BR><B>woken or half woke at 4am to feel as though i was being violently
being</B>
<BR><B>thrown round and around, then after that i not only i had that but
i had a</B>
<BR><B>strong feeling of being pushed very fast down a very long bright
tunnel but</B>
<BR><B>i remember thinking No my kids i can't, strange things then happening</B>
<BR><B>(pretty tame) considering what i had been through, were lights going
on and</B>
<BR><B>off .&nbsp; Then when i was looking after my niece and nephews i
checked my 6mth</B>
<BR><B>old nephew who was in the crib next to me and he was sound a sleep,
i lay</B>
<BR><B>down and all of a sudden i was almost "thrown" from my life into
someone</B>
<BR><B>elses I was a young woman with long black hair in a victorian looking
room</B>
<BR><B>with big victorian furniture, there was a baby with me on the bed
in an old</B>
<BR><B>gown and bonnet when i felt the bed being tipped over and all i
could think</B>
<BR><B>of was being able to stop the baby from falling, when the baby was
taken</B>
<BR><B>away from me and put in a big old cot in the same room, i felt my
arm being</B>
<BR><B>gripped very tightly and feeling as though i was being shook quite
violently</B>
<BR><B>, then felt my self being thrown from one side of the room to the
other i</B>
<BR><B>banged"my" head against the door frame whilst all this was going
on the baby</B>
<BR><B>was screaming, once i hit my head i heard the baby screaming for
a few more</B>
<BR><B>seconds then everything went black. Then i found my self back in
my room and</B>
<BR><B>my nephew was in the same postion as before. I know i hadn't been
a sleep as</B>
<BR><B>i was too awake to just drift off. another thing that happened whilst
there</B>
<BR><B>was again whilst i was in bed was woken to find a man dressed in
an old army</B>
<BR><B>uniform over me trying to strangle me , i froze then it stopped
, i could</B>
<BR><B>describe he's features clearly , short back and sides moustache.&nbsp;
The whole</B>
<BR><B>place felt bad the atmosphere was horriable.&nbsp; Even now i still
feel worried</B>
<BR><B>about what happened to the baby as though i am connected to him/her
some</B>
<BR><B>way.&nbsp; what do you make of it?&nbsp; I would be interested to
know.</B>

<BR><B>The House of Evil</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Joseph</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>The House of evil is a Brooklyn Brownstone apartment, that's haunted
by</B>
<BR><B>evil spirits. Many strange, and unexplained events have happened
to me, and</B>
<BR><B>my family in the past 10 years. The building is haunted from top
to bottom,</B>
<BR><B>but</B>
<BR><B>the top floor seems to be the center of activity of this house.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had many encounters with spirits, my first
experience happened in</B>
<BR><B>the summer of 1990, when i saw strange balls of green lights, moving
across</B>
<BR><B>my sister's bedroom. In Feb. 1994, after the big snowstorm, my brother-in
law,</B>
<BR><B>who lived across the street from my house, was looking out of his
top floor</B>
<BR><B>window that afternoon, and he saw, with his own eyes, an apparition
of a 19th-</B>
<BR><B>century man, who looked as if he was shoveling snow off the roof.
At least a</B>
<BR><B>half an hour later, during investigation, by my father, and my brother-in
law,</B>
<BR><B>they were spooked to find no footprints, or obvious signs of shoveling
on the</B>
<BR><B>rooftop. My other experience, occured on a hot August night in 1993,
my</B>
<BR><B>sister, and i were talking, in the living room, and we both heard
a door slam shut,</B>
<BR><B>as if someone entered our top floor apartment, and we heard it,
not once, but a</B>
<BR><B>number of times. there's alot more to my true ghost story, I will
write next</B>
<BR><B>week. please email me , and let me know what you think of my story,
let me hear</B>
<BR><B>from you soon.Hi, this is Joseph, I am writing the rest of my ghost
story, so I will start</B>
<BR><B>here... where i left off. After My sister, and i heard doors slamming,
A week later,</B>
<BR><B>my dad, who was watching television, on the living room couch, at
about 12:30 AM,</B>
<BR><B>heard a loud bang on the kitchen wall, The following&nbsp; night,
my mom was</B>
<BR><B>resting on the sofa, when all of a sudden she heard a man's voice
say"wake up</B>
<BR><B>Catherine"</B>
<BR><B>Catherine is my mother's name. During the winter of 1968, my dad,
who was</B>
<BR><B>alone&nbsp; in the building, had his first experience, when he reported
seeing a turning</B>
<BR><B>doorknob, he searched through the entire house, and came up empty
handed.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In April of 1992, I was in my room with my door
open, I heard strange</B>
<BR><B>Whispering coming from the living room, and i could hear the voices,
but i was too</B>
<BR><B>scared to go, and investigate. Finally, on the day before we were
to move, we</B>
<BR><B>smelled smoke in</B>
<BR><B>the kitchen, obviously, something was burning, the oven knob was
turned all</B>
<BR><B>the way up to 500 degrees, and a plastic tray, that was inside the
oven caught</B>
<BR><B>fire, and began to melt. the oven was not being used at the time.
this sort of event</B>
<BR><B>really did seem weird, because this happened only on the day we
put the house</B>
<BR><B>up for sale. I guest, the reason the stove went up in smoke, was
becuase the</B>
<BR><B>spirits, didn't want us to sale the house, another words, they did
not want</B>
<BR><B>us to leave.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; About 10 months after Sammy passed away, I was raking leaves
in the</B>

to have a</B>
<BR><B>group project for my daughters and myself and that there were a
lot of</B>
<BR><B>leaves to be raked.&nbsp; I looked up and saw Sammy inside the kitchen
door.</B>
<BR><B>He was smiling, weaving right to left as he always did when he was
very</B>
<BR><B>happy and his tail was waving like a flag.&nbsp; Sammy was absolutely
clear -</B>
<BR><B>there was no mistiness, shadows, etc.&nbsp; I looked at him for
at least 10</B>
<BR><B>seconds.&nbsp; I watched him and had time to think, "Oh, Sammy,&nbsp;
he wants out</B>
<BR><B>- he loves to be with his kids.&nbsp; Which girl shall I call to
open the</B>
<BR><B>door?&nbsp; I wonder who is closer to the door?"&nbsp; As I looked
over to call a</B>
<BR><B>daughter to open the door I suddenly remembered - and looked back
at the</B>
<BR><B>door.&nbsp; There was no Sammy.</B>

<P><B>Dog Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tlvsdogs@gj.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Being an animal lover, I also believe that animal ghosts exist as
well</B>
<BR><B>as humans. While I was growing up we had a dog named Missy, she
was</B>
<BR><B>primarily my brother's dog, but definately a member of the family.
She</B>
<BR><B>lived to be 19, an old age for a dog, and died in the 1985. My mom
&amp;</B>
<BR><B>brother buried her in the back yard. At this time I was married
and had</B>
<BR><B>been long gone from home. In 1988, we were in the process of relocating</B>
<BR><B>and ended up staying&nbsp; with my parents for a couple of months
and had to</B>
<BR><B>stay in my brother's old room. One night, I had gotten up &amp;
gone to the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen, not turning on any lights, I went to get a glass of milk.
When</B>
<BR><B>I started out of the kitchen I saw Missy coming out of the living
room,</B>
<BR><B>my heart nearly stopped! I stood perfectly still in the dark &amp;
watched</B>
<BR><B>her wander around the dining room and finally out through the sliding</B>
<BR><B>glass door into the back yard (the door was closed by the way).
So</B>
<BR><B>obviously, I didn't go back to sleep very well. I mentioned it to
my</B>
<BR><B>mom, I told her I had seen Missy, plain as day, walking around the</B>
<BR><B>house. She dismissed it &amp; still does to this day. However, while
we</B>
<BR><B>stayed there I saw her at least 3 times in the house &amp; back
yard near</B>

<BR><B>"Come on Essie"</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: desireej@gbis.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This isn't my story. This happend before I was born. My mother told
me this story and my grandfather back's it up, he is the only one alive
who can back it up... My mother's grandfather passed away, leaving her
grandmother behind. One night, she called for her daughter&lt;my grandma>
and my mom to come to her house. Upon arriving, my great-grandma told them
that Herbie &lt; her husband> came to her last night. She said she woke
up and he was there. She was very frightened, this continued for almost
every night for the longest time, until she relized her was just there
watching over her. Until there was a new element. My mother and grandmother
went to her house for a visit and she told them about Herbie coming to
her agian, but this time her spoke to her.He said," Come on Essie, it's
time to go now." &lt;Essie is her name incase ya couldnt tell.> This too
continued for a week. Then, one night, my mother had a terrible nightmare
that her grandmother had died. She woke up and told her mom and dad, but
they passed it off as a nightmare and told her to go back to bed. She woke
up again and told them of another dream showing her grandma's grave and
a black crow. Some people believe that if you see a black crow in your
dreams, it simbolizes death. Well, she made such a fuss that they ended
up calling her, but no one anwsered which is very unusual. They went to
her house, to find her dead. She had sat down in her chair and had a brain
anurism and died. Then they rememberd her dreams and her hust band coming
to her in them saying, "Come on Essie, it's time to go home now."</B>

<P><B>Dromoland Castle story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tj-sakoor@rogers.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My wife and I had just found your site and read
a few of the stories.&nbsp; I am not someone who readily believed in ghosts,
until my own encounter with some "unexplainable experiences".&nbsp; My
wife and I were married on December 18, 1997 and spent our two week honeymoon
in Ireland.&nbsp; We stayed in Dublin, Waterford and Limerick.&nbsp; Dromoland
castle is about one hour away from Limerick and my sister decided to put
us up for two nights at Dromoland castle as a wedding present.&nbsp; Upon
arriving, we were quite impressed to find out that she had put us in the
Presidential Suite (where president's of the U.S. have stayed when visiting
there).&nbsp; The Presidential Suite is in a separate part of the castle,
away from the rest of the guest rooms.&nbsp; As you can imagine, there
is a lot of empty space (hallways, conference rooms, etc.) around the suite
and it was quite unusual to have that much room to ourselves.&nbsp; I am
not normally one to scare easily, but given the unfamiliar territory, I
and my wife found it a bit unsettling.&nbsp; Our first night was pretty
uneventful...or so we thought.&nbsp; After a wonderful dinner we decided
to check out parts of the hotel.&nbsp; The weather was horrible (the worst
Ireland had seen in 50 years...high winds and rain had knocked out a lot
of Ireland's power throughout the country for part of our honeymoon).&nbsp;
There was power in the castle, but given the surroundings and the sound
of the wind and rain hitting the roof and windows, it made things a little
scarier.&nbsp; We had no idea what was about to happen.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We came upon the games room, which had ping pong
and a snooker table right beside each other.&nbsp; The snooker table was
occupied by two men so my wife and I decided to play ping pong.&nbsp; About
halfway through our game, even though we were moving at a semi-physical
rate, we both realized that it became very cold in the room.&nbsp; Then
something strange happened.&nbsp; One of my shots went off the table and
under the snooker table.&nbsp; I retrieved the ball and then realized that
the men were no longer in the room.&nbsp; I asked my wife if she had seen
them leave and she immediately turned white!!!&nbsp; The only exit/entrance
in the room is beside the ping pong table, so they would have had to walk
right past us to get out.&nbsp; A cold chill went up my spine and my wife
and I dropped our paddles and headed back to our suite.&nbsp; We spent
part of the night talking about what had happened and I had convinced my
wife, as well as myself, that the events were nothing out of the ordinary.&nbsp;
The heat could have been lost in the room due to the weather, after all,
we had been experiencing brief power outages for most of our honeymoon.&nbsp;
Secondly, we could have been so enthralled in our game (and let's face
it...we were on our honeymoon and consumed with each other), that we may
have not noticed the men leaving the room.&nbsp; My wife agreed with me
and we enjoyed a decent nights sleep.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During breakfast the next morning, I casually
mentioned the "heat loss" in the game room to our waiter.&nbsp; He had
told us that the hotel is equipped with emergency generators and a loss
of power or heat is improbable.&nbsp; My wife looked at me and I could
see in her eyes that she did not want to go back into the game room again.&nbsp;
We spent the day roaming the grounds of Dromoland castle and my wife started
to feel a bit more comfortable.&nbsp; After dinner, we spent the majority
of the evening in the bar of Dromoland castle, talking to the bartender,
waitresses and other guests.&nbsp; Even though my wife had not wanted to
talk about it, I asked some of the staff about the history behind Dromoland.&nbsp;
They shared some information and also indicated that they had never experienced
anything unusual.&nbsp; The bartender had said that he had heard a few
stories from other guests, but chalked it up to "their minds playing tricks
on them".&nbsp; We retired to our suite for the remainder of the night.&nbsp;
About 3am in the morning, my wife woke me up in a panic.&nbsp; She had
awoken to the sounds of footsteps outside our bedroom.&nbsp; I sat up and
listened for a couple of minutes, but heard nothing.&nbsp; I calmed my
wife down and just as I was trying to fall back asleep, I heard some noises
to.&nbsp; They noise was "tin-ish", sort of sounding like metal banging
against stone.&nbsp; I listened for a minute or so and decided to check
out what was going on.&nbsp; With my wife clinging to the back of my pajamas,
we ventured out into the hall.&nbsp; The noise was now coming from the
conference room down the hall.&nbsp; We walked towards the door, when all
of a sudden the door slammed shut in front of us.&nbsp; We ran straight
back to our room, locked the door and stayed up watching T.V. for the rest
of the night.&nbsp; Even though there was nothing to be afraid of, we never
felt threatened in anyway, I can honestly say that I have never been that
freaked out in all my life.&nbsp; We spent about two more hours listening
to the strange noises before they stopped.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we checked out the next morning, we had
asked the desk clerk about the conference room.&nbsp; Something he said
sent one last "Dromoland chill" up my spine.&nbsp; He had told me that
the conference room is always locked when it is not being used and there
is nobody using it during the early morning hours, not even cleaning staff.&nbsp;
While I can logically explain our experience on the first night (even though
I still wonder about it), there is no doubt that on our second night, we
had an encounter with "spirits".&nbsp; I was glad to leave, but if I were
to go back to Ireland again, I think I would go back to Dromoland for one
more night, just see if anything else unusual happens.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; An Extra Face</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: desireej@gbis.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, I'm Amanda and I am 15. I live in a very small tourist town that
is visited more frequently for it's history on ghost, than it's historical
value. I am in a program where I re-enact events from the west. Anyway's,
one night we are all gathered in a resturant, sitting there discussing
the day, when one of my fellow re-enacter's said she wanted a picture of
us. So, all eight of us gathered in a line, me being at the end. I kept
feeling a cold feeling and a tingling up and down my spine and at me waist.
I was told to stop finicking and to hold still. We were using a poloroid
camera, and once the picture developed we all gasped at what we saw, and
it certainly explained the chill's and finicking I felt. I swear, to everything
I believe in, there was an extra person in that pictue! There was 9 people,
a lady, stood standing next to me, straight faced, in her 50's, wearing
old time clothes, with her arm hooked around my waist. She and I were both
sorounder by what looked like ectoplaysm, from what I have heard. That
picture to this day frightens me, I have many more ghost stories which
I will submit, it seems these "experiences" happen to me much to often
for my comfort.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>A Mothering Baby GHost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: desireej@gbis.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>When I was born, my dad, mother and I lived on a navy base. The first
home I ever lived in, was haunted, but my parents did not know at first.
Until rather odd, to say the least, thing's began happening to me. I would
be in my crib, asleep and my mother would come back to check on me and
I would have my stuffed animal's set up in bed, circling facing me, as
if watching over me. My mother would place them in their proper spot's
outside of the crib only to find them placed in there again, less than
a minute after she left. Then, my craddle would rock, by an invisible hand,
my bottle's would be heated on their own, if I cried for something that
my mother wouldn't get me, like a toy on the other end of the room, my
mother would turn around, then check on me and I would happily be playing
with it. But then, it would almost try to be almost, my mother. I would
just do everything, from giving me my favored toys, to even locking my
bedroom door's, keeping me away from my mother. Then it would start taping
on her back, whenever she was with me, or did anything to care for me.
Finnally, she got sick of it after for a repeated time she was locked out
of my room with me in it and she screamed out, ," Leave us alone!" the
door unlocked instantly, and from then on we never had any troubles. When
she told our land lord of our troubles, she got a pale face, and confessed
that the tenats before us, had a baby, that died in the house from heart
problems.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>A Few Things that Happened to Me</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tofujoe@vision1mm.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a former Marine, I live on Okinawa, a small
Japanese island in the</B>
<BR><B>Pacific. Years ago, my wife and I were dating and were out late
one night on</B>
<BR><B>the beach down the hill from Camp Hansen(where I was stationed at)
it was</B>
<BR><B>around 3 A.M. and she and I were sitting on the rocks right alongside
the</B>
<BR><B>water when she and I both heard footsteps and I could faintly hear
a woman</B>
<BR><B>crying.It was funny, because she and I had both turned around at
the instant</B>
<BR><B>we heard the noise. Me being a young Marine and not scared of anything,
I</B>
<BR><B>blurted out "hey baby, what's that,a ghost?" She assured me that
it was</B>
<BR><B>nothing and said "we have to go!" on the way, Hatsue pulled off
a branch</B>
<BR><B>from a small tree that grew along the path that led to the beach
and tied it</B>
<BR><B>so that it made a small ring on the end and she waved it around
me and her</B>
<BR><B>and chanted like she was a small child. I am totally freaked out
at this</B>
<BR><B>point and I said "what are you doing?" Apparantly, she had encountered
a few</B>
<BR><B>ghosts here before and was doing her thing to get them to leave
us</B>
<BR><B>alone.(Okinawan style) On the was back to Camp Hansen, she explained
to me</B>
<BR><B>that about 4 years earlier, a bar girl's nude body had been pulled
from the</B>
<BR><B>water in the same spot. She was raped and strangled and thrown into
the</B>
<BR><B>water. It was her asking us for help. I told a few members of my
platoon</B>
<BR><B>about it and one of my friends said that she had spent the night
on that</B>
<BR><B>beach a few months earlier, by herself, drinking wine and cuddled
up in a</B>
<BR><B>poncho liner when she also had heard the same thing.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later on, Hatsue and I were living together in
Ginoza in a small,</B>
<BR><B>run-down(but affordable) old house. She and I were sound asleep
one morning</B>
<BR><B>in this smaller room on that was on the same lot as the house we
were</B>
<BR><B>renting.(the kids had the main house, I wanted to fix up this as
a spare</B>
<BR><B>room) At about 4 A.M., I heard this noise like an older Okinawan
man</B>
<BR><B>singing. I figured it was some older gentleman stumbling home after
tying</B>
<BR><B>one on someplace. Well, the street near our house was sandy, you'd
hear the</B>
<BR><B>crunch of the sand beneath the man's feet when he walked, right?
The noise</B>
<BR><B>had gotten louder and louder until it passed right through the room,
as he</B>
<BR><B>passed through, I could feel a draft of cold as he went right on
through.The</B>
<BR><B>next weekend I was working on putting up panelling when Hatsue was
talking</B>
<BR><B>to an older Okinawan lady walking down the front street. She told
Hatsue</B>
<BR><B>that 20 years earlier, an old man who used to live in that room
had died in</B>
<BR><B>there. I already had told hatsue about him doing a walk-through
one morning.</B>
<BR><B>Needless to say, I never remodelled the room after that!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we're married, I'm out of the Marines and
I'm a civillian again. We</B>
<BR><B>moved out of there and into a small older style house that was so
cool in</B>
<BR><B>August when we looked at it, we had to move in! The summers here
are sticky</B>
<BR><B>and humid, so we figured the house in Yomitan was cooler due to
the old</B>
<BR><B>style Okinawan tyle roof, with dirt packed between the ceiling for</B>
<BR><B>insullation. We moved in and right away, strange things started
happening.</B>
<BR><B>In the bedroom one day, Hatsue was taking a nap and I was wahing
my truck</B>
<BR><B>outside in our bedroom and she was woken up out of a sound sleep
by this</B>
<BR><B>loud knocking on the closet door. Come to find out, the closet used
to be a</B>
<BR><B>"butsudon"(an area of Okinawan houses where the ashes of cremated
family</B>
<BR><B>members are stored for 41 days after their death, with their picture
above</B>
<BR><B>it for the family to kneel in front, say goodbye, burn incense,
grieve and</B>
<BR><B>pay respects, before moving their remains to the family tomb on
the 41st</B>
<BR><B>day) This house had a bad history we found out later on. The man
who lived</B>
<BR><B>there with his mother and son was deep in dept. He killed himself
by taking</B>
<BR><B>rat poison and the neighbors saw him die as he reached out for the
tea pot,</B>
<BR><B>right in the middle of the living room. 6 months later, his Mother
passed</B>
<BR><B>away. (I know this, because our neighbors gave told Hatsue the story
of the</B>
<BR><B>house, AFTER we were settled in it of course!) I used to go to work
at about</B>
<BR><B>2 A.M. every morning making tofu in a supermarket, one morning I
was sitting</B>
<BR><B>on the couch a little after 1 A.M., having coffee, getting up for
work,</B>
<BR><B>watching T.V., with our Mini Dobermans on my lap when they both
started</B>
<BR><B>howling. I looked up in time to see a figure, (transparrent) walk
a cross</B>
<BR><B>the room. Our daughter kept having dreams of a sad looking man coming
to</B>
<BR><B>her, giving his name and saying that we were living in his house.
She told</B>
<BR><B>Hatsue and She asked the neighbors who told her the man's name.
It was only</B>
<BR><B>a temporary house to live in until our place was built. As we were
moving</B>
<BR><B>out of there, near one of the last loads I was dusting and packing
to put on</B>
<BR><B>the truck, by myself (just me and the dogs) at around 3 P.M. this
door</B>
<BR><B>slammed so hard, it nearly rocked the house! It was an aluminum
door which</B>
<BR><B>led to the shed on the back room of the house. We always left the
door open</B>
<BR><B>so that the dogs could run in and out as they please. The door slammed
so</B>
<BR><B>hard that the cement all the way around the door jam had cracked.</B>
<BR><B>Apparantly, our ghost was angry that we were leaving!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At our new house in Kin, one morning I was sitting
out on the front</B>
<BR><B>porch, drinking coffee around 4 A.M., and down the front steps on
the</B>
<BR><B>street, I spotted someone walk past, clearing the 2 pillars few
just a few</B>
<BR><B>seconds, still trying to wake up, it took a second for it to register;
It's</B>
<BR><B>4 A.M., somebody walking around at this hour must be up to no good!
I</B>
<BR><B>figured I'd see who he was and what he was doing, I ran down the
front steps</B>
<BR><B>and turned the corner to see an empty street. I ran around the house
and</B>
<BR><B>there wasn't a trace of our visitor! Hatsue called a "yuta" (an
Okinawan</B>
<BR><B>spiritualist or medium) to bless our home and our land. She said
the ghost</B>
<BR><B>was a construction worker who had financial difficulties and hung
himself</B>
<BR><B>nearby in the jungle. A good friend of mine, John was a Marine and
he</B>
<BR><B>corroberated the story, because John was in the training area nearby
and</B>
<BR><B>found the man a week after he had been hanging there.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okinawa has a very long and bloody history behind
it.Not dating just to</B>
<BR><B>world war 2, but farther back when the Island was divided into 3
separate</B>
<BR><B>Kingdoms.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, 1 more story, I'll call this one "The Old
Man In The Road".</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hatsue and I were riding around one spring night
3 years ago, hunting</B>
<BR><B>Habus in our area (kin) A Habu is a very poisonous snake that was
a real</B>
<BR><B>problem here a few years ago when the former jungle covered land
in our area</B>
<BR><B>was just developed. We'd ride around on warm, rainy spring nights
when the</B>
<BR><B>snakes would come onto the wet raods to eat frogs. We would take
along a hoe</B>
<BR><B>and kill everyone we'd spot.(I know it's a little strange, but after
I was</B>
<BR><B>bit by one in our back yard, we went on a crusade to rid our area
of Habus!)</B>
<BR><B>We were out driving up and down the country raods nearby, when we
decided to</B>
<BR><B>drive down to the fishing port and turn around in the parking lot.
As I</B>
<BR><B>drove around this curve in the raod near the entrance way to the
port, much</B>
<BR><B>to my surprise, we spotted an old man, he was wearing a white t-shirt,
boxer</B>
<BR><B>shorts and glasses. As I drove past him, he seemed to wave to me
as if he</B>
<BR><B>was going to tell me something. Hatsue said "He's some crazy guy,
hurry up,</B>
<BR><B>let's turn around and go home!" Well, I sped up maybe thirty feet,
pulled&nbsp; a</B>
<BR><B>U-turn and when we went by the same spot he was gone! There was
no place he</B>
<BR><B>could have gone, the road was blocked off on one side by a sea wall,
the</B>
<BR><B>other side there was an 8 foot high chain link fence. Since that
night, we</B>
<BR><B>never go there after dark.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>I've always been interested in the paranormal, and your sight is</B>
<BR><B>excellent.&nbsp; I would like to share some happenings that I have</B>
<BR><B>experienced:</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was about 9/10 years
old.&nbsp; I was sleeping and something woke</B>
<BR><B>me up, I heard someone coming down the passage (footsteps) thinking
it</B>
<BR><B>was my mother I turned to look and saw the figure coming towards
me, he</B>
<BR><B>was dressed like a monk and I could not see his face or feet.&nbsp;
He walked</B>
<BR><B>up to my bed and sat next to my bed looking out the window smoking
and</B>
<BR><B>blowing the smoke everywhere.&nbsp; Then he spoke to me but I did
not hear</B>
<BR><B>him like you would hear someone speaking to you.. I heard him speak
in</B>
<BR><B>my head... he said :&nbsp; "there are 9 stars in the sky" then he</B>
<BR><B>disappeared.&nbsp; 9 Days after that my dad's aunt died.</B>
<BR><B>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night sleeping I woke
up feeling someone sitting on my bed,</B>
<BR><B>I turned to see my grandfather (who died about 4 years prior to
this)</B>
<BR><B>sitting next to me, he got up and moved to the end of my bed looking</B>
<BR><B>very sad and shaking his head back and forth.&nbsp; He then disappeared.&nbsp;
&plusmn; 1</B>
<BR><B>week after that his brother died.</B>
<BR><B>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband bought a house
just before we got married.&nbsp; When I</B>
<BR><B>moved in I could feel something was not right.&nbsp; The one door
in the</B>
<BR><B>lounge was locked permanently as we did not get a key for the door,
any</B>
<BR><B>time day or night I would here someone approaching the door with
a key.</B>
<BR><B>Sometimes I would think it's my husband and get up to open the other</B>
<BR><B>door, but there would be no-one.&nbsp; Sometimes I felt nothing
and could</B>
<BR><B>move around in the house in the dark, but other times I felt so
scared</B>
<BR><B>that I had to close the middle door (separating the front of the
house</B>
<BR><B>from the bedrooms).&nbsp; When the door was closed I felt save,
but when open</B>
<BR><B>I would be so scared.&nbsp; After we moved my mother told me that
she saw a</B>
<BR><B>man sitting in my lounge with a white vest on staring into space,
but</B>
<BR><B>did not want to tell me and scare me.</B>
<BR><B>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After my grandma died I used
to feel her presence when driving</B>
<BR><B>alone in my car, I even smelled her.&nbsp; It was so clear that
the one day I</B>
<BR><B>asked out loud, Is that you grandma?&nbsp; I miss you and love you,
rest in</B>
<BR><B>peace.&nbsp; I have not felt her since.</B>
<BR><B>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have moved to a new house
and we've been here for 5 years</B>
<BR><B>now.&nbsp; I've never seen anything but sometimes I can feel a presence
in my</B>
<BR><B>bedroom.&nbsp; As I'm so scared I usually just close my eyes and
pray for it</B>
<BR><B>to go away as I'm always scared after the first 2 experiences that</B>

<P><B>I Have a Sighting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: shadyjadyj@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Amanda and I am 16 years old. I live in Kansas City, KS.
This only happened a few days ago. I was up in my room looking for my CD
case to put in my car when I heard this man's voice, yelling for me from
the stairwell.</B>
<BR><B>"Amanda, come on! Let's go!"</B>
<BR><B>And without giving it another thought, I replied, "Alright, hold
on a second..."</B>
<BR><B>They yelled back, "Come on Amanda we gotta go!"</B>
<BR><B>Finally I found my CD case and yelled back, "Alright, I'm coming,
I'm coming."</B>
<BR><B>I ran down the stairs, and when I reached the bottom I realized
I was the only one home. No one was in my house. I searched high and low,
thinking it was a prank pulled by my boyfriend or his friends, but no one
was in that house. All the doors were deadbolted and the windows locked,
I was home alone.</B>
<BR><B>The next night the same thing happened only this time I was listening
to music.</B>
<BR><B>"Amanda, come down here, I need to talk to you..."</B>
<BR><B>"About what?"</B>
<BR><B>'Just get down here!"</B>
<BR><B>"Alright, alright... damn......" I turned my music off, and when
I reached the bottom of the stairs once again I realized that I was the
only one home.</B>
<BR><B>I don't know why I always seem to reply but I do. It's like I don't
think straight when they are talking to me, and then when I get to where
they are calling me, I stop and think about it and go, "Oh my Gawd, I'm
the only one here."</B><B></B>

<P><B>my step sister and I have been together ever since I can remember,
we are really close and have tons of experiences together. we have had
our own little supernatural experiences in fact we've had probably more
than we can handle. we've lived all over the place and seen a lot of stuff
that we wouldn't exactly pray for. For instance:</B>
<BR><B>We were walking down the street and we walked past these two abandoned
trucks that have been there since we were really little.&nbsp; As we were
walking past the trucks we heard a huge THUMP we turned around and saw
a little pale and white girl just staring out at us. She started to bang
on the windows like she was locked inside, but we were to scared to go
and open the door. So she finally opened the door and she started to run
at us. She looked like she had polio in her legs, she couldn't run and
she couldn't talk very well. We knew this wasn't normal so we started to
run and scream. Suddenly all these people started to stare at us like we
were crazy almost as if they couldn't see her! We never did find out who
that little girl was or what she wanted, but we knew that nobody else could
see her.&nbsp; We've never gone past those trucks ever since then.</B>
<BR><B>It was a Saturday night and I was going to bed. I fell asleep really
fast since it was like 2;oo in the morning. It started to get really cold,
so i woke up to pull the rest of the blankets up over me. i turned around
and saw a lady just laying on the side of my bed with her back towards
me. she was all curled up in a ball. I was half asleep at the time so i
just thought it was my mother or older sister, but i realized that none
of them had thick curly hair, when i realized she was black and white.
i got really scared so i woke up my cousin and she said she didn't see
anything when the lady was right on my bed! how scary is that?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
i also had an experience when i turned over and saw a black and white little
girl with her chin resting on the side of my bed. Why am i having all these
experiences with black and white ghosts?!?!?!</B>
<BR><B>We have more stories but&nbsp; no more time, we will e-mail you
more and scarier stories later.</B>

<BR><B>Ghost Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cutie_pi917@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am only 13 years old but I have always been fascinated with the
paranormal ever since my personal experience.</B>
<BR><B>When I was about 7 or 8, (I cant remember my exact age) I lived
in Liverpool, Nova Scotia. My house was approximately 150-200 years old.
I had lived in that house since I was 8 months old and I never remember
any kind or paranormal activity until one night shortly after my great-grandmother
died. I woke up in the middle of the night, couldnt get back to sleep
so I just lay there for a few minutes, trying to sleep. I was looking around
the room when I noticed the hall light was on. Im not positive, but pretty
sure it had just went on because I remember it being completely dark until
that moment. I looked out into the hall and suddenly I saw a small figure,
the size of a young baby, walk into my room. As it got closer, I could
see clearly that it was one of my porcelain dolls, which I collect. I was
really scared. It was just walking steadily into my bedroom and when it
saw me looking at it, it opened its eyes really wide in surprise and vanished
into thin air. I was so scared I just hid unde</B>
<BR><B>The next morning I told my mom. I highly doubt that she believed
me, but she still took the doll, locked it in a box and put that in a drawer
of a dresser, which was in her sewing room. A few nights later I woke up
again to a loud crash. A porcelain clown head, which was sitting almost
a foot away from the edge of my dresser, had fallen. And unbelievably,
there was not a scratch on it. (My dresser was about 4 feet high.)</B>
<BR><B>Another time, I was sitting on my bed in broad daylight, and I happened
to look over at my dresser, which was at the foot of my bed, to see my
favorite pink hard plastic pencil-case floating a foot above the dresser,
as if someone was holding it. Then it just sat back on the dresser as if
they had put it down.</B>
<BR><B>Shortly after all this happened, we moved down the street to a nicer
house. We only stayed there for a couple months before moving across the
province to Cape Breton.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Casper...Our Resident Ghost.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ladyreading@earthlink.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>My husband and I have lived in our house for about 25 years. Our
home was only 7 years old when we bought it, so it isn't really that old.
I can only assume that Casper has some reason for being here other than
it being a house he died in, or&nbsp; our house being old and haunted.</B>
<BR><B>Casper is a friendly spirit, hence the name we gave him. Our daughter
told me our house was haunted soon after we had moved in. She was around
10 years old at the time. I didn't really believe her , not because I don't
believe in ghosts, I do and always have since I was a child, but because
I hadn't seen any signs of a haunting.</B>
<BR><B>That all ended. Soon our resident ghost made himself known and even
though our four children have grown and left home, Casper still lives at
home.</B>
<BR><B>Casper will let us know he is here by playing with various lights
in our home. Lately though I have been catching shadowy movements out of
the corner of my eyes.</B>
<BR><B>At one time I had battery operated candles on our fireplace mantle.
To turn them on, you had to pick them up and twist the bottom, and the
same to turn them off. One night my husband woke up and wanted a drink
of water. He was making his way carefully to the kitchen and was passing
the fireplace and kind of said to himself how dark it was....on came a
candle. He said thanks to Casper and got his drink of water. As he was
going back to bed and passed the fireplace the candle went out.</B>
<BR><B>We have a light in our window that Casper loves to turn on and off.
During the winter it would be fairly dark by the time we would get home
from work. More often than not our light in the window would be on for
us. One day as my husband and I walked in the door I said ''Casper you're
slipping" and on came the light.</B>
<BR><B>Another story that comes to mind was on Halloween night. I had strung
pumpkin lights in our entrance way. They were brand new. On the first few
nights they worked fine. Then a few nights before Halloween I couldn't
get the lights to work no matter what I did. Then on Halloween night, the
first trick-or-treater rang our doorbell and you guessed it, the lights
popped right on and stayed on.</B>
<BR><B>We have a raised ranch home and we had a little dog (who has passed
away) who loved to lay at the top of the stairs and watch the door. Many
times we would watch her watch something come up the stairs, even turning
her head as whatever it was went by her. She never growled so I can only
assume it was our Casper.</B>
<BR><B>Yes, he is still here and still playing with the lights.</B>
<BR><B>I am not sure how I know our ghost is male, but I know it as well
as I know he is friendly.</B>

<BR><B>Sleep Problems</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sweetmary92001@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I have been haunted for almost my whole life now.</B>
<BR><B>It's not that I see ghosts, but that I feel them all</B>
<BR><B>around me.&nbsp; Sometimes I faintly hear their voices.</B>
<BR><B>After researching over the internet about haunted</B>
<BR><B>houses and ghosts, I've decided to tell you about</B>
<BR><B>myself - before, I would just shrug these feelings off</B>
<BR><B>and ignore the voices.&nbsp; I don't want to think that I</B>
<BR><B>am some sort of special medium or psychic.&nbsp; I am sure</B>
<BR><B>you would like to hear some of my experiences.&nbsp; You</B>
<BR><B>are the first person I have ever communicated to about</B>
<BR><B>this so please don't judge me.</B>
<BR><B>It all started at a young age where it was very hard</B>
<BR><B>for me to sleep.&nbsp; My parents were divorced and we</B>
<BR><B>moved in with my Dad and step-mom and her children.</B>
<BR><B>At night I would literally cry because I was so</B>
<BR><B>frightened of something next to me, watching me,</B>
<BR><B>reaching for me, wanting to hurt me, laughing at me.</B>
<BR><B>All these emotions I couldn't bare and would scream</B>
<BR><B>for my dad.&nbsp; He would tell me I was just scared of the</B>
<BR><B>dark and to pray for God to help me sleep.&nbsp; He would</B>
<BR><B>leave the room with the light in the hallway on.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>was sharing a room with my stepsister at the time.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>had the top bunk. I know, it seems like I was just</B>
<BR><B>another kid afraid of the dark, but here comes the</B>
<BR><B>"encounter of the unknown" part.&nbsp; As usual I was</B>
<BR><B>chanting "I love Jesus, I love Jesus" so it would</B>
<BR><B>leave me alone.&nbsp; My heart pounding and my eyes wide</B>
<BR><B>open I couldn't feel my body and could not move one</B>
<BR><B>finger.&nbsp; I heard the most horrible yet emaculant voice</B>
<BR><B>in my ear (not in my head) but clearly in my ear as if</B>
<BR><B>someone was to whisper in your ear.&nbsp; The voice said</B>
<BR><B>"Jesus doesn't love you".&nbsp; I was so afraid to do</B>
<BR><B>anything. I was afraid to scream, to cry, to speak. My</B>
<BR><B>body felt as if something was holding me down and I</B>
<BR><B>don't even know how I got through the rest of the</B>
<BR><B>night. I was about eight years old when this happened.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Now, 20, I still have that same feeling that someone</B>
<BR><B>is trying to take over my body at night when I am</B>
<BR><B>laying down. I hear voices, but voices that laugh at</B>
<BR><B>me and don't say anything-just laugh.&nbsp; I sense a being</B>
<BR><B>next to me when I am alone. This is the first time I</B>
<BR><B>have talked about this so forgive me if I don't make</B>
<BR><B>since. Everywhere I have lived I have always had</B>
<BR><B>something strange happen to me. For instance, I got</B>
<BR><B>married to my high school sweetheart and we moved into</B>
<BR><B>a spacious two bedroom apartment.&nbsp; After a few months</B>
<BR><B>living there, I had no problems sleeping or being</B>
<BR><B>alone.&nbsp; Then, my husband changed to the night-shift at</B>
<BR><B>work for the extra money. When he would be working-I'd</B>
<BR><B>be getting ready for bed when all of a sudden, I felt</B>
<BR><B>a force not allowing me to move and like someone or</B>
<BR><B>something just dropped a fifty pound bag on me. I</B>
<BR><B>heard a horrible laugh so loud it pierced my ear and</B>
<BR><B>then faded away slowly. After a couple of seconds I</B>
<BR><B>ran out the apartment and into the hallway. I couldn't</B>
<BR><B>go back in the apartment so I just sat on the stairs</B>
<BR><B>until my next door neighbor saw me and invited me to</B>
<BR><B>stay in her apartment till my husband got home. Of</B>
<BR><B>course I didn't tell her the whole truth-I just told</B>
<BR><B>her I heard noises and was afraid someone was trying</B>
<BR><B>to break in.</B>
<BR><B>Sometimes-these experiences aren't so bad. Sometimes I</B>
<BR><B>feel something else is watching over me. I can sense a</B>
<BR><B>bad and good presence. Sometimes the bad takes over</B>
<BR><B>the situation and taunts me and sometimes the good</B>
<BR><B>takes over and makes me feel safe. I know for a fact</B>
<BR><B>that these experiences are not in my head. I am an</B>
<BR><B>honest person who works hard and loves to read, have</B>
<BR><B>fun, loves kids, and absolutely loves God. These</B>
<BR><B>experiences seem to only happen at night and I am</B>
<BR><B>taking medication for anxiety, but the medication only</B>
<BR><B>helps during the day. I wish I could explain better,</B>
<BR><B>but I am so scarying myself right now I can't even</B>
<BR><B>think.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Sadness at the Memorial Park</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: impulse_trackah@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi. I'm writing you from Miami, FL. I've sent you a story before,
but that</B>
<BR><B>was one about when I was five or so. This experience I had today.
I live in</B>
<BR><B>North Miami, and every weekend (Saturday or Sunday), I go to visit
my</B>
<BR><B>friends in South Miami. I've been trying to go on a ghost hunt for
a long</B>
<BR><B>time now, but couldn't find anybody that would go with me.</B>
<BR><B>I went to my best friend's house to pick him up. I had my photo
camera and</B>
<BR><B>he brought his girlfriend's digital camera. Before coming to his
house I</B>
<BR><B>looked up "Miami cemeteries" online, and found only one listing.</B>
<BR><B>The place is called "Miami Memorial Cemetery".</B>
<BR><B>When we finally got there, after going around it two or three times,
it was</B>
<BR><B>already dark, about 9 in the evening. It was big, this huge land,
you almost</B>
<BR><B>couldn't see the end of the tombstones. It looked really creepy
from the</B>
<BR><B>first glance. The gate had two tall tombs, and at the tope there
were</B>
<BR><B>statues of Saints. To the left and the right there was a white fence
which</B>
<BR><B>after about 30 feet turned into a bushed fence. Kind of grassy fence
if I</B>
<BR><B>can say that. Inside there were some statues, some tombstones, but
mostly</B>
<BR><B>there were those horizontal stones with flowers at the foot of almost
each</B>
<BR><B>one.</B>
<BR><B>Since the cemetery was closed for the night my friend and I came
closer to</B>
<BR><B>the grassy fence to ask the *owners* of the tombs permission to
take a few</B>
<BR><B>pictures. As we began to take pictures of the cemetery from different</B>
<BR><B>angles, my friend got a feeling that someone was watching us, and
so did I.</B>
<BR><B>We thought that it was a normal feeling that everybody gets at a
cemetery,</B>
<BR><B>so we went on. After about 5 pics we went back to the car to take
a little</B>
<BR><B>drive a bit farther out to the left side of the gates. When we stopped,
my</B>
<BR><B>friend asked *them* to show themselves so he could take a few pictures.</B>
<BR><B>Right after that he felt like something reached into the back of
his head,</B>
<BR><B>and started squeezing his brain, because it was like a headache,
but more</B>
<BR><B>intense. Right then he told me to snap a pic with the digicam. When
I went</B>
<BR><B>to the menu to check out the shot, I couldn't believe it. There
was an orb</B>
<BR><B>right in front of us, like someone was standing on the other side
of the</B>
<BR><B>grass fence, looking straight at us. There were also smaller orbs
behind</B>
<BR><B>that one, on both sides. My friend kept looking up in the tree,
and feeling</B>
<BR><B>that something had to be there. When he got the image, there was
a small</B>
<BR><B>light ectoplasm-looking object. It was too dark, so we couldn't
see it that</B>
<BR><B>well. We went a little farther to the left to take a few pics of
the big</B>
<BR><B>tombs that looked like a morgue, with handles on the square doors.
There was</B>
<BR><B>one perticular door that was cracked and a piece of it was broken
off. I</B>
<BR><B>snapped a shot of that part of the tomb with my .35 camera, and
in the flash</B>
<BR><B>saw a bright anomaly right in front of me. There was no smoke or
fog or rain</B>
<BR><B>or anything that would do that. So I hope it came out on the film.</B>
<BR><B>We went back to the car once more, and drove all the way to the
left corner</B>
<BR><B>of the cemetery. As we stopped and walked out to see what else we
could</B>
<BR><B>catch on film, I came closer to the fence and felt this extreme
sadness. I</B>
<BR><B>felt like I was going to be sick. It was like I blacked out, because
when I</B>
<BR><B>was looking out into the field, I saw a horrible picture in front
of me. I</B>
<BR><B>saw bodies everywhere, I saw smoke coming from the earth, and I
saw more</B>
<BR><B>people dying and falling to the ground. I felt loneliness. I felt
a terrible</B>
<BR><B>pain in my whole body, like this was once a battle field, and I
was the only</B>
<BR><B>one left from an army of a thousand. It felt like a wave of all
those</B>
<BR><B>feelings together in one hit me in an instance. As soon as I felt
that, I</B>
<BR><B>put my head down, knelt down on the grass, and started crying uncontrolably.</B>
<BR><B>I was crying as if I actually was the only one left after a battle,
and</B>
<BR><B>everyone I knew and cared for was dead. I felt this horrible sadness,
and</B>
<BR><B>couldn't stop crying. I couldn't walk, or even stand up. My legs
were weak,</B>
<BR><B>and I felt dizzy.</B>
<BR><B>My friend kept asking me if I were ok, but I couldn't answer him.
When I got</B>
<BR><B>enough energy to stand up, I went a little more to the right, and
the</B>
<BR><B>feeling of sadness left me. I stopped crying, and the tears stopped
flowing.</B>
<BR><B>I couldn't understand this sudden sensation I had just felt.</B>
<BR><B>After that, I couldn't do anything anymore, and we started driving
back. On</B>
<BR><B>the way to my friend's house, I told him what I felt. And after
hearing my</B>
<BR><B>story, he said: "Well, you asked for it." And then i remembered
that when he</B>
<BR><B>felt the pain in his head, I said: "How come you're the only one
to feel</B>
<BR><B>something, that's not fair..."</B>
<BR><B>In conclusion I now know that there are far greater forces out there,
than</B>
<BR><B>our own feelings, that can make you feel something so terrible or
so great</B>
<BR><B>in an instance. There are other people out there that we don't see,
but know</B>
<BR><B>they're there. And there is life after death, that might not be
pleasant,</B>
<BR><B>but there is life. And I visited some of it.</B>
<BR><B>I'm still interested in that life, and want to know more about it.
I want to</B>
<BR><B>join a ghosthunters society even more now, than I ever did before.
I want to</B>
<BR><B>know what makes *them* stay inbetween worlds. And I want to catch
more</B>
<BR><B>paranormal activity on film.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Many Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dell@bright.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have had many experiences with ghosts.&nbsp; I have several pictures
that I would like someone to give their oppinion on.&nbsp; My husband thinks
I am crazy.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I grew up on land that was once part of a big farm, and was
broken up and built onto,&nbsp; The house I grew up in is an old farmhouse,
and there is an old barn at the end of the drive up to the house.&nbsp;
I now live in a mobile home on my parents land about 2 acres behind them.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Growing up in the house I was always very afraid of the dark,
and certain areas.&nbsp; I was always afraid of the basement, and a closet
in my bedroom.&nbsp; Still to this day, I can't go by the barn without
feeling scared.&nbsp; My sisters stayed in the bedroom upstairs.&nbsp;
Both sisters had come to me scared and said they saw a man in poka-dot
pajamas, at the end of there bed.&nbsp; They both told me at different
times.&nbsp; When I told them they were dreaming, they got mad. As I got
olerermy parents had bought my sisters a oija board.&nbsp; This was when
I started seeing why I was scared all the time.&nbsp; We contacted a spirtit
named CJ.&nbsp;&nbsp; I 100% believed in the board.&nbsp; I tested it many
times, like asking questions no one could know but me.&nbsp; I asked it
what song was on the radio in my room, and it told me , and I went to my
room, and that was what was on!!!&nbsp; We were in another part of the
house where we couldn't hear it.&nbsp; One time the game peice flew at
least 10ft across the kitchen hitting my sister in the arm, after she said
that CJ was an idiot.&nbsp; My dog would sit and move his eyes and head,
as if he were following someones movements.&nbsp; Sometimes he would bark
like he was mad, or just growl and show his teeth, and then go running
out of the room whining.&nbsp; Whenever he did this, I felt uncontrollable
chills, and had to leave the room.&nbsp; I started realizing my new bedroom
was the most haunted.&nbsp; I would wake at night feeling like someone
was standing over me, and I would be very scared.&nbsp; Almost too afraid
to move!&nbsp; But, I would force myself to turn the light on, because
I knew it was evil, and it wouldn't go away until I did.&nbsp; This time,
I started reciting the Lord's prayer, and felt terrified!!&nbsp; I almost
went up to sleep with my sisters, but just slept with the light on for
as long as I can remember.&nbsp; I also remember, when I did share a room
with my sisters, making one of them sleep in bed with me, and feeling scared,
like something was watching me.&nbsp; My sisters felt the same way, and
we would fight over who got to sleep with who.&nbsp; When I was in the
downstairs room, I was dating my now husband.&nbsp; He was home from school
for the weekend, so we fell asleep on the couch not wanting to leave each
other.&nbsp; I was asleep, and jolted out of my sleep with this intense
feeling of being watched!&nbsp; I couldn't hardly move.&nbsp; I couldn't
talk.&nbsp; I wanted to wake my boyfriend, but I couldn't.&nbsp; It was
like it was keeping me in a trans.&nbsp; I had been using the oija board
alot then.&nbsp; What I saw was a big man, but I could only see this dark
figure, with a bright light behind it that hurt my eyes.&nbsp; I couldn't
see him, or his face, but I felt he was smiling.&nbsp; Not a nice smile,
but an evil smile, like he was telling me he was the spirtit from the game,
and he was going to get me....like he was after my soul.&nbsp; I know that
sounds crazy, but I really felt it!!! I remember not feeling very scared.&nbsp;
I felt like, when you take NightQuil, and you can't keep your eyes opened.&nbsp;
I couldn't stay awake as much as I tried, and I wanted to say "Dad?"&nbsp;
to ask if it were my Dad, and I couldn't talk.&nbsp; I fell back to sleep
feeling like I would be okay.&nbsp; I am a very light sleeper, and once
I am woke up I have a hard time going back to sleep, so this was not normal
for me.&nbsp; When I woke the next morning, I asked my Dad if he came down
and looked in the room, and he said he didn't wake all night, and slept
like a baby.&nbsp; That was when it all hit me.&nbsp; I remembered everything,
and couldn't believe I just fell back to sleep.&nbsp; I didn'tunderstand
the overwhelming feeling of wanting to close my eyes, and assumed I must
have dreamed it all.&nbsp; I gave the Oija board away to someone, because
I really feared for my sisters and me, as I had looked into the history
and stories behind Oija boards.&nbsp; I didn't want to get rid of it, but
I felt God was asking me to.&nbsp; I felt like it was evil, and I was opening
a door to being possesed if I kept it up.&nbsp; I talked to a friend and
told him the whold story one night .&nbsp; We had went to a movie, and
on the way home he told me to promise to not&nbsp; get another board.&nbsp;
It was like trying to resist my favorite brownie's.&nbsp; I wanted to get
another one and talk to the spirit again.&nbsp; It would talk alot of my
brother that had died , getting hit by a car right in front of our house.&nbsp;
Sometimes he would tell me he was my brother.&nbsp; One time he told my
sister where to look for her earrings.&nbsp; She went to the place, and
they were there, and she had looked there before.&nbsp; There they sat,
plane as day on a toybox.&nbsp; Anyway, my friend told me to promise not
to get another board, that he had a really bad feeling about it.&nbsp;
He dropped me off, and headed home.&nbsp; He said he felt scared.&nbsp;
There was a full moon, and it was about 12:00.&nbsp; He got to the edge
of the dirt road he lived on, and his car stopped.&nbsp; He tried to start
it for a while.&nbsp; He told me he gave up, and started waking.&nbsp;
His house was just at the top of the hill.&nbsp; He felt scared, and said
the whole time he walked he felt followed.&nbsp; He said he was so scared
he ran like hell the rest of the way!&nbsp; He is very into ghost stories,
Holloween, ect. and he said he had never felt scared like that before.&nbsp;
He felt like something was mad at him for warning me.&nbsp; The next day,
he went down to his car, and it started right up and never had a problem
like that after!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; More recently, In my house now, I fell asleep with my twin
toddler boys for there nap.&nbsp; I woke startled, because I felt a "tap
tap tap" on my hip, like when my daughter wakes me at night because she
is scared.&nbsp; I thought she was home from school.&nbsp; I thought she
must have tapped me and went into the living room.&nbsp; I went out to
see her, and it was an hour before she get's home, and of course she wasn't
home.&nbsp; This led to many other times that I have overlooked as being
dreams, or my imagination.&nbsp; I guess I didn't believe my house could
have spirits since it is new?&nbsp; I went through some pictures trying
to find something, but not really knowing what, just feeling sure I would.&nbsp;
I did alright!!! I found several that were questionable, but one scared
me!&nbsp; One picture looks out of focus, with me washing dishes, and some
white spots here and there.&nbsp; I wasn't sure until I saw a face!!!!
I was sure I saw a face!&nbsp; Like an older man or women.&nbsp; The eyes,
mouth, nose, and forhead, and part of the head.&nbsp; I wasn't scared.&nbsp;
I feel like this spirit isfrendly, and protects me?&nbsp; I also think
he likes to mess with me.&nbsp; I always set my alarm at a low volume,
because I wake so easily.&nbsp; Every morning I wake to it full blast!
One night it went off at 1:30 Then one night my daughters alarm went on
then off, then on, then off, then on again, and my husband woke this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My daughter is a very sound sleeper, and he said she was still asleep.&nbsp;
We will see what happens next.&nbsp; For now, this is my story.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If anyone wants to contact me, I am at Krissieisin2hair@Yahoo.com.&nbsp;
I would like to know if anyone has similar experiences. I have had too
many experiences to mention all.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi. My name is Elizabeth. I live in a very small town in Wisconsin.</B>
<BR><B>I live in an apartment. I moved here in 1999. Now it is 2002.&nbsp;
I have my very own ghost. My ghosts name is Ben. Now i will tell you the
story(s) about Ben.</B>
<BR><B>Ben is a very friendly ghost. He has never had any harm to any of
the people in my family. My mother, me, and my Step-Dad have all had our
own experiences.</B>
<BR><B>This story happened to both me and my Mother. I was awaken suddenly
in my bed. ( this always happened periodically ) I heard the faint sound
of a radio on. I went into my living room and I found our surround sound
radio on. As I went to turn it off I felt a cool presence. ( We have had
our electricity checked twice and nothing is wrong with it. ) I quickly
turned it off and ran to my bedroom and went to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>After that " occurence " I suddenly saw a name on my mothers bedroom
wall. The name I saw was Ben.</B>
<BR><B>My mothers occurence is very strange and it only happened when i
was gone for 2 weeks. My mother claims she was digging into the fridge
for something to snack on. All of a sudden the Microwave somes on. This
happened the day before I was supposed to come home. My mom notices the
timer was on it for 12 min. 12:00 was the tim my&nbsp; mother was supposed
to pick me up when I was supposed to come home.</B>
<BR><B>Now my stepdads experience is very "weird" as u would say.</B>
<BR><B>He awoke to the sound of the radio on just like my story....&nbsp;
But as he was walking back to the bedroom he sees the old rocking chair
of my great grandmothers. It all of a sudden starts rocking frantically
as he says....</B>
<BR><B>my mother says he came and jumped into bed like a scared cat.</B>
<BR><B>Thank You for reading my story and I hope I didnt waste any of your
time.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My name is Stephanie Hall and I live in Wimborne, Dorset England.</B>
<BR><B>In the summer of 2000, our oldest cat Polly, who was 16, died of
massive liver failure. She had been in the family as long as I had (I was
15 at the time) and we were all very upset by her death.</B>
<BR><B>About two weeks after she had died my mum came downstairs for breakfast,
I was still in bed at the time. She had just sat down at the table when
she heard a scratching noise coming from the cupboards in the kitchen,
she looked but was unable to find any explanation. She sat down again and
heard the sound once more, she was about to get up and look again when
the catflap, situated right next to the dining room table, opened and shut
quickly as if a cat had just run through it. Our back garden is very sheltered,
and ever when there has been wind blowing right at the bac door, the catflap
has never opened in the wind, plus this was a fine late summer day and
there was only a very slight breeze.</B>
<BR><B>Over the next few days and weeks, the catflap went in and out, and
our other two cats would often jump off the sofa's in the lounge and walk
to the door into the kitchen and stare at the back door, but we could never
see any explanation for this.</B>
<BR><B>My mother experienced most of these things and I believe this is
because she was the one that Polly trusted most (she was a very timid cat).</B>
<BR><B>However, I myself would sometimes experience things, like in the
middle of the night or when I was trying to get to sleep I would feel what
felt like a cat jumping lightly on to my bed and walked up the duvet towards
my head. We have had no more experiences since we buried her ashes in the
back garden. Perhaps this laid her spirit to rest, or perhaps she was just
making sure we were going to cope without her.</B>
