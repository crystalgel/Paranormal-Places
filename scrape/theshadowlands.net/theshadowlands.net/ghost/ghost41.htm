<H3><A NAME=grim>Meeting The Grimm Reaper</A>
</H3><P><B>by camnvic@jps.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was living with my grandmother and mom and 2 sisters while we were

looking for a new house in a different state.   I was in the 4 grade when
this happend.  It was snowing out side and the school bell rang as I left
the building and headed towards the bike racks I got a very sickening feeling
in my stomach and immediately l knew that something bad was going to happen.
 As I rode my bike out into the middle of nowhere and on the long dirt road
that lead upt o my grandmother's house the feeling got worse.  I was really

freaked by the time I got to her house and I discovered that I was at the
house alone.  I had a million things running through my mind as I entered
the house, the main thing that was running through my mind was "when will
gramma get home?"  I picked up the telephone and called my grandma at her
store.  She said that she would not be home until the 2 hours after the sore

closed which would be around 8-9 O'clock in the evening.  My mom and baby
sis were with her and they had to wait to go home with her.  My uncle and
other sis were spending the night at friend's houses.  And my grandpa was
at his job and he wouldn't be ariving home util 8:30 that evening.  So I
asked my grandma if my friend Nikki could come over.  She said it was okay
so I hung up and called her.  She told me that she could but I would have
to meet her halfway down the main paved road that goes alll the way through
the little town my gramma lives in.  So I left.  It was still snowing when
I met up with her.  She said " I don't feel right.  I feel like something
bad is going to happen.  Do you feel that way too?"  I said "yes.  I'm really

scared."  We rode up the long dirt road to my gramma's.  As we pulled into
the diveway the snow got thicker.  We propped our bikes against the tree
next the doorway to my gramma's door way.   We went into the garage and gave
my uncle's dog Blondie and doggie treat.  When we came ut we shut the garage
door behind us.  My Gramma's garage door is temramental and it will come
up again.  So we stood there freezing cold waiting for 5 min. to see if it
was gonna go up again.  After 5 min. we went inside because it wasn't gonna
goup again.  We put in "Grumpy Old Men"  to get that ill feeling of danger
to go away.  At funniest part in the movie I got this sudden thirt which
isn't unusuall for me, so I asked my friend what flavor of crystal light
she wanted.  I went into the kitchen and got out the lime flavor and starrted

making it.  By this point in time I had forgotten all about the sick felling.
 All of the sudden the sick feeling whoosed over so fast I almost threw up
all over.  I shook it of to the point where I could stand it and continued
to make the drink.  My friend cried out "oh my god what was that!!??"  She

startled me by using that kind of language I turned to her and said " What!?"
 She replied " I don't know but it was running very fast and it was really
tall. "  I said, " Don't try to scare me you know how I'm feeling!"  She
said, " I'm not trying to scare you."  We kind of brushed it off and for
about 5 min. everything was fine.  Then I got another whoosh of the feeling
over me.  She Squeeled and said or more like shrill whispered, " What the
HELL it that???!!!!!"  I turned and looked at her and turn my head bak to
my drink and looked up at the window in front of me just in time to see a
rather tall man runn by the window.  I said " Holy GOD WHAT WAS THAT!?" 
I immediately dropped to the floor in fear of whatever it wa that wa running

round would see me.  I told her to drop on all fours.  She did as I said
and I crawled over to her and picked up the phone and called my gramma at
the store.  She said that she would send some one over to check on us.  Shaking

uncontrollably I hung up the phone.  Almost 2 seconds after I hung up a loud
bang was heard coming from the door.  I terrified crawled over to the door
to see what it was.  The figure was banging on the door with the handle part
of a hatchet axe.  The blinds were bounceing wildly around from the harsh

banging.  I told my friend to start crawling up my uncle's stairs that lead
up to his room.  I crawled over to the door to see the face of the guy so
I could give a description later.  I saw the face and crawled frantically
to the stairs.  Nikki was crawling up the stairs between bounces of the blinds
so the guy could'nt se us.  As soon as we got into my uncle's room we turned
on the light in his closet and went inside it and locked the closet door
behind us.  As soon as we were in the closet we hugged each other and shook.
 We could still hear the banging on the door.  Then I noticed that I was
still clutching to the phone.  It rang.  I aswered it.  It was her grandpa

calling to check on us.  I told him what was happening.  He said he would
be right over.  We waited for about 2 more minuets hte banging had subsided.
 All of the sudden we heard our names being called we were still terrified
to come out be we did anyway.  As soon as we left the house her grampa surrounded

us with huggs.  We told him what happened and I don't think he beleived us.
 The funny thing is the snow had stopped falling and there were no footprints
in the freshly fallen snow, 8-10 diffent dents in the door that weren't there

before, and the garage door was open.  I truly beleive it was death coming
after us. </B>

<H3><A NAME=dog>Who Let the Dog Out?</A>
</H3><P><B>by greybear@borg.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>In 1986 my wife and I moved into a small house in Oneida, NY.</B>
<P><B>At the time we had a 2 year cat and a 6 month old Siberian Husky.</B>
<P><B>One night we went out to dinner and left the dog in a cage in the

house.</B>
<P><B>The cage was secure and the dog was used to it.</B>
<P><B>When we returned, we could tell that something was wrong. The

curtains</B>
<P><B>were down and there was stuff all over. The cat was cowering in the

spare</B>
<P><B>room and the dog was running all over the place.</B>
<P><B>The door to the cage was still secured. The only thing that was

different</B>
<P><B>was that one top corner of the cage was lifted up about 1 inch. The

cage</B>
<P><B>was still upright.</B>
<P><B>This was the beginning of a strange period in our lives. After this
the cat</B>
<P><B>remained upstairs except to eat, my wife felt cold spots, the TV would

come</B>
<P><B>on or change channels, and the topper was when the gas oven blewup
in</B>
<P><B>my wife's face. All during this time the cat was also terrified of
the dog.</B>
<P><B>Shortly after the oven incident we moved to another house. The day
we moved</B>
<P><B>we watched in amazement as the cat walked up to the dog and brushed</B>
<P><B>up against her chin. (They've been best of friends since.)</B>

<P>
<P><B>I was always willing to discredit "strange" occurrences until a hand
I couldn't see tried to ram me through my bed....</B>
<P>
<P><B>Before I married my husband Ray,  in 1993, he lived in a small two
bedroom house on the east side of Wonder Lake, IL.  During that time, he
had been keeping company with a girl named "Cindy".  They had just ended
their relationship and she had returned all the little mementos that lovers
swap in a large manila clasp envelope.  Ray had laid the envelope horizontally
on the top of the encyclopedia's on the wooden book case in the bedroom.
 The next morning when he awoke, he saw that the envelope was standing vertically

upright on the shelf with no support. The bottom of the envelope was bellowed

out.  In checking, he found that the bottom two inches of the envelope was
filled with water.  The water had not leaked out onto the bookcase and no
books were wet.  There are no water pipes in the bedroom and no conceivable
way for the water to have gotten there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A month later, Ray visited me in Tennessee where I was attending college.

 We eventually got married there but since I was in the middle of the semester,
I couldn't move back to Illinois until June.  Approximately three weeks after
we married, I flew to Illinois to help shop for a new house (as the one he
had was too small).  During the two weeks I was in Illinois, Ray had to work
the afternoon shift (he is a Sheriff's deputy).  On the second night I was
there, Ray had gone to work and I was alone in the house in the basement
doing laundry.  I heard footsteps overhead that walked from our bedroom,
through the living room, into the kitchen where the steps were distinctly
heard on the tiled floor.  I thought Ray had come home for something and
I yelled up the stairs that I was in the basement.  When I got no answer,
 I came upstairs to find no one there.  I naturally assumed that he had gotten
a call and that he had left.  A couple of nights later, I was taking a bath
when I heard the footsteps walk past the bathroom door and into the kitchen
(the bath is off the living room).  Again I yelled out to Ray but, not getting

any answer, I opened the bathroom door and peeked out.  There was no one
there but I could still hear the steps in the kitchen. Again, I assumed it
was Ray slipping in to get a Coke or something.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In the bathroom on the sink counter, Ray kept a glass ashtray.  One
night he came home and we were sitting in the living room talking when we
heard a loud cracking sound coming from the bathroom.  We both went in to
see what had broken and found the glass ashtray was broken in half but still

sitting on the counter. It had not shattered but had clean break lines right
down the middle of it. The ashtray was clean, nothing was near it that could
have fallen on it, nor did the heat blow on it.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I moved back to Illinois on June 10th, we had to stay in the little

house for five weeks until we closed on the new one. During this time, every
time I went into the bathroom, the toilet seat was up.  Now I didn't really
pay any attention to it because I assumed that since Ray had been a bachelor
for so long, he just forgot to put it down.  I would put the seat down and
the next time I went in there it was up again. Ray came home from work one
night and went to the bathroom.  About twenty minutes later, he went back
in there and came right back out with his face ashen.  He asked me if I had
gone into the bathroom since he had come home. He knew I hadn't because we
had both been sitting in the living room the entire time.  When I told him
that I hadn't, he said that the toilet seat was up.  I told him that the
bloody thing was always up.  He said he never leaves it up but always makes
a point of putting it back down.  I went back into the bathroom with him
and watched him put it back down.  Ten minutes later we checked and the seat
was back up.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A week before we moved to our new house, I was sleeping when Ray got
home.  He wakened me getting into bed and I had to use the bathroom.  The
lights were off and as I was groggily trying to get out of bed, I found my
right foot was tangled in the sheet.  My left foot was on the floor and I
was up on my right knee trying to pull the sheet off.  I had just gotten

untangled when I looked over by the dresser next to my bed.  I saw a "haze"
but thought that it was moonlight coming in through the window.  I had almost

stood up when I felt a hand on my chest that pushed me backwards onto the
bed so hard that I thought that I would go through the bottom of the mattress.
 I was so terrified that I couldn't move.  Ray was yelling at me for almost

falling onto him and when I told him what had happened, he made me get up
to "face it" or I would always be afraid in that house.  After many minutes,
I finally got up enough courage to get out of bed to go to the bathroom.
 And, as always, the toilet seat was up.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Since Ray had never felt threatened by any of the bizarre things that

occurred, he invited whatever was there to go with us to our new house. 
She stayed behind, however (I always think of "It" as a "her" as it seemed
that it was a protector spirit for him).  We did not tell the new owner,
a single guy, about her and I have often wondered if she takes good care
of him.   </B>

<H3><A NAME=warm>A Warm House</A>
</H3><P><B>by MSmith2163@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is my story of an event that happened to me and my older brother
when i lived  in his house 3 years ago. One night i was awakened by a "warmth",

it was winter time about 30 degrees or so outside. I found myself sweating
with nothing on but my under wear, i checked the thermometer and it said
65 dgrees. I woke my brother up and he too was sweating and burning up. I
managed to fall asleep later, but was awakened at approximately 4:35 am by
a sick feeling. I looked around my darkened room and noticed some movement.
I saw a small pale (about 3 1/2 feet) figure moving towards my bed, i jumped
in a fearful reaction . The small thing was aware that i had awaken and moved

swiftly towards the window where it disapeared , it went into the window.
i turned on the light to find no trace of anything, it simply went into the

window. The strangest thing was , after this thing disapeared the heat was
gone also. I woke my brother who was quite disturbed by the whole incident.
I never saw the "thing" that was in my room that night again. Strangely enough
, the house had 3 more times in the following 2 months where the temperature
was very hot, on one of those ocassions my brother awoke the next morning
at 9:00 am late for work. He was unusually tired and his alarm had been turned

off. if anyone else has had or read or heard of similar expierience`s please

e-mail me.</B>

<H3><A NAME=awake>Scared Awake</A>
</H3><P><B>by cwoitese@doverintl.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>First of all, I would like to say that I have always believed in

ghost</B>
<P><B>and have an interest in the unknown.  I guess because my mother

passed</B>
<P><B>away when I was so young might have something to do with it.  Anyway

I</B>
<P><B>have always loved horror movies, stories, tails etc.  Well my story</B>
<P><B>starts out with my cousin telling me of a really cool movie.  I don't</B>
<P><B>remember the name of the movie.  I never saw it.  I think it was

called</B>
<P><B>the Entity????  My cousin tells me that in the movie this women gets</B>
<P><B>raped by ghost and it's suppose to be a true story.  I was sixteen
at</B>
<P><B>the time with hormones kicking and thought it would be neat to be</B>
<P><B>intimate with a ghost.  I'm going to keep this clean don't worry.</B>
<P><B>Anyway one night I was in bed and kind of thinking about it and went

to</B>
<P><B>sleep not really thinking anything would happen.  Well while I was</B>
<P><B>sleeping my covers kind of slipped off of my shoulders and I pulled

them</B>
<P><B>up back under my chin where I always keep them when I sleep.  Then

real</B>
<P><B>fast, my covers were ripped totally off of me.  It scared me so bad,

I</B>
<P><B>sat straight up in the bed.  I pulled my covers back on top of me and</B>
<P><B>when I looked up I saw 3 women and they were dressed like little

house</B>
<P><B>on the prarie type closes with bonnets etc.  Two women were at the

foot</B>
<P><B>of my bed and the other one moved slowly up the side of the bed to

were</B>
<P><B>I was at.  They were gray and I couldn't really make out any

features.</B>
<P><B>It was kind of like looking at an old black and white photo.  Well
I</B>
<P><B>thought I must me dreaming this can't be happening so I rubbed my

eyes</B>
<P><B>and when I looked up they were still there and then I sunk under my</B>
<P><B>covers and rubbed my eyes again and they were gone.  By this time I

was</B>
<P><B>wide awake and so scared that I went down the hall to sleep with my

mom.</B>
<P><B>By the way my mom sleeps in another room other then my dad because
he</B>
<P><B>snores so bad.  When I opened the door a man jumped up from the bed

and</B>
<P><B>stood straight up real fast as if I scared him.  I thought that it

was</B>
<P><B>my dad of course and I had disturbed them. One reason was because my</B>
<P><B>moms legs were up.  Knees bent where the feet are flat against the

bed.</B>
<P><B>Well I stood still a minute and he didn't say anything.  I was dark

and</B>
<P><B>I tried hard to see him.  He had a crew cut and was wearing a white</B>
<P><B>under shirt. I went around the other side of the bed and climbed in.

 I</B>
<P><B>was trying to act as if I were asleep, but still trying to see the</B>
<P><B>figure to see if he would walk out the door.  Well he never did.  He</B>
<P><B>disappered right before my eyes and that's when I knew it was a ghost</B>
<P><B>and not my dad.  Well I'm 28 and still remember it very well.  I used

to</B>
<P><B>think the women that came in my room were mean and trying to get me.</B>
<P><B>Now that I'm older,  I think they were trying to scare me awake so
I</B>
<P><B>would go to my moms room.  I had invited that ghost in my house and

the</B>
<P><B>women knew it and were trying to stop it.  I still could have been</B>
<P><B>dreaming I guess, but It was very real.  My parents house is not

haunted</B>
<P><B>and I have never seen any other ghost.</B>

<P>
<H3><A NAME=the>The House</A>
</H3><P><B>by robb@mail.sage.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Let me start by saying, up until the summer of '89 I was very skeptical
of anything "paranormal". In the summer of '89, after of town was completely
torn apart from a tornado, my girlfriend and her family moved to an old house

that had set vacant for a few months. When we first started to move their

belongings in is when the first, of what would seem to be an endless amount
of paranormal activity, began. Upon entering the old house the scary feelings

began. Her brother who was 15 at the time, three years my junior, said almost

jokingly," I could have sworn I seen a shadow pass me by in the hall." Now
you must understand that being from our small town in Texas we just did not
even give a second thought to the idea of some sort of strange happenings
going on, YET! It all started out slowly with small things coming up missing
and doors closing by themselves. As time wore on and after about a month
of residence a presence made itself known to all of us. While sitting watching

movies on night we heard what sounded like my girlfriends youngest brother

running up and down the hallway. As impossible as it was because he was sitting

with us. Now mind you the hallway was, maybe, two foot from where I was sitting.

As the small lad ran by the entrance door to the living room you could actually

hear him run into the entrance door of the house. That took place at least
two or three times a week. And the boy was not bashful to do it if front
of whoever was there at the time. Many of folks have hea</B>
<P><B>rd him. One afternoon I stopped by to see my girlfriend on break from
work and found her in tears in the living room. As I reached out to touch
her I felt how cold and clammy she was. I asked her what was wrong and she
said," Can't you hear that humming?" Which at first I did not hear. Upon

investigation I could hear what sounded like humming coming from the kitchen.
The closer I got to the kitchen the louder the humming got. As I opened the

swinging door into the kitchen it just went quiet and all that could be heard
was the echo of the door opening. This did go on for some time and never
did go without notice. We were told that dogs could pick up on E.S.P. and
such as that so we got a small puppy we called Sampson. We called him Sammy
for short. One night while watching TV the small pup walked out into the
hallway as he had never done before and started to bark we all laughed at
how cute he sounded until we heard the boyish soft voice say," It's alright

Sammy, I'm not gonna hurt you." With that it brought our laughs to a stop.
We all heard it and just stared at each other in amazement. Towards the end
of our stay things started to become more and more scary. The final happening

that made them make the move was when we entered the house after returning
from the grocery store. The oldest of the brothers was in front of me and
we both had a handful of groceries and upon entering the kitchen the door
seemed to lock itself behind us. The door was a swinging door with no lock
or such as that, which is what made it so weird. When the door finally opened
we seen a shadow run right past us and run straight through the rear door
of the house causing it to fling open and literally rip it off the hinges.
It was at that point in time that we relocated and left the house for the
proper proprietors. A f different families moved in after we and everyone
ended up leaving after a short time lapse. Everyone that lived there all
had the same comments about the house that it had ghosts or something that
none wanted any part of. And that the longer you stayed the worse it got.</B>

</H3><H3><A NAME=cave>Marvel Cave Ghost</A>
</H3><P><B>by aclemens@dialnet.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>    I have been told at least two different stories concerning Marvel
Cave at Silver Dollar City.  They were first told to me by my uncle who was
a tour guide there a few years.  They were confirmed by another tour guide
who has worked there for at least 25 years.  </B>
<P><B>     When you enter the cave you're standing at the top of a metal
tower in the Cathedral room.  This room is large enough to fit the Statue
of Liberty inside with only her torch sticking out of the sink hole.  It
is extremely impressive.  The tower stands on top of a huge pile of debris
(mud, rocks, and leaves) that have fallen throught the hole over the years.
 The legend is that people standing at the bottom of the debris and looking
up at the top of the tower witness a woman in a white dress looking back
at them.  The tour guide at the bottom radioed the guide at the top about
her.  He never saw her, but as he turned around he felt a hand on his

shoulder.</B>
<P><B>    The other story concerns my uncle and his personal experience with
the cave ghost.  When he was still new part of his job was to clean the walk

ways.  This job consists of being completely alone in a huge cave.  He was

finishing up on the tower, his mind full of the stories his associates had
told him about the spirit.  rather than worry about the spirit he decided
to put his mind at rest once and for all.  He stood up and looked out at
the vast Cathedral room.</B>
<P><B>    "If you're here, do something now and get it over with." he said

loudly.  Nothing happened so he went back to his work.  Suddenly a roar echoed

throught the room.  My uncle grabbed his stuff and high tailed it out of
the cave.  Part way up the stairs he realized what the sound was.  There
is a formation in the room called the Liberty Bell.  It is any of thousands
of years old.  To help with cleaning there was a drain behind the formation.
 It was installed to keep the dirty water away from the formations.  The
roar was the water going down the drain.  This story is important because
of what happened later.</B>
<P><B>    One day he was working down one of the off passages that are closed
to the public.  There is no electricity there so he brought his miners helmet.

 deep into the passage his cord snagged on an outcropping of rock and his
light was gone.  The passage was instantly plunged into total darkness. 
He realized he was going to have to get on his knees and feel his way out.
 Once on his knees lights came on in the passage.  he cautiously made his
way to an area with light so he could fix his helmet.  Once there he turned
to the passage and said,"thank you." with that the lights went out. </B>
<P><B>    Later he told this to one of the other guides and was informed
that although there were lights in that area, there hadn't been electricity

running there for years.  He then was told that the cave had accepted him

beacause of what he said at the drain incident.</B>
<P><B>    I have yet to see the apparition on the tower or felt the presence
in there.  I believe it because I cannot go in there outside of a tour. 
I do believe in them though and hope someday I'll look up at the tower and
see the cave's spirit looking back.</B>

<H3><A NAME=pullman>Ghost story in Pullman, Washington</A>
</H3><P><B>by imweasel@olypen.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>The haunting that I experienced took place over a period of about two

and</B>
<P><B>a half years.  I was attending classes at Washington State University

in</B>
<P><B>Pullman, Washington, and I moved into an apartment with two friends
of mine</B>
<P><B> after my sophomore year.  The strange noises started almost as soon

as</B>
<P><B>everyone settled down in their respective rooms.  My room was off of

the</B>
<P><B>back hallway next to the bathroom, so it was very common to hear my

room</B>
<P><B>mates walking by at all hours of the day and night.  I even became
able to</B>
<P><B>tell who was walking by just by the sound of their footfalls.     
After a</B>
<P><B>while, I started hearing someone walking by with a very cautious, slow,

and</B>
<P><B>deliberate stride.  I knew that this was neither of my room mates,
so I</B>
<P><B>went out to investigate.  Nobody was there.  Sometimes I would even

hear</B>
<P><B>the footsteps in my room while I was there.  They would usually only

be</B>
<P><B>heard at night, especially after I went to bed.  It was all very weird,

but</B>
<P><B>not that frightening.  After all, nothing of a physical nature had

really</B>
<P><B>happened, there was just some noise.</B>
<P><B>	Early the next school year, things changed a little.  One warm

September</B>
<P><B>day, my room mates and I were sitting around watching t.v. and hoping
for a</B>
<P><B>little air circulation to help cool off the place.  The air was dead

calm</B>
<P><B>and stilfing.  Even keeping the door propped open didn't help matters.

</B>
<P><B>Then all of a sudden the door, which was propped open with a small
block of</B>
<P><B>wood, swung shut with a slam.  There was still no wind that could

have</B>
<P><B>blown it closed, and the piece of wood propping it open moved to the

side</B>
<P><B>as though someone forcibly removed it.  My room mates and I shared
a very</B>
<P><B>surprised look.  I think that all of us had had some experiences with

the</B>
<P><B>strange footsteps but hadn't given it too much thought.  We all

started</B>
<P><B>shouting "Hello!  How are you doing!" to our invisible guest and and

tried</B>
<P><B>to laugh off the experience.  Afterwards, not much more than the

walking</B>
<P><B>sounds persisted.  Maybe the spirit just wanted a little recognition

and</B>
<P><B>was satisfied for a while with our greetings.  </B>
<P><B>	The same patterns of noise persisted through the rest of the second

year</B>
<P><B>at the apartment and part way into the following semester, which would

be</B>
<P><B>my fifth and last in the apartment.  Late that semester, we got a new

room</B>
<P><B>mate.  The level of noise caused by the spirit had slowly increased
as the</B>
<P><B>semester had gone on, and now things started to get pretty hairy. 
A few</B>
<P><B>days after moving in, my new room mate asked me if I knew that the</B>
<P><B>apartment had a ghost.  Neither my old room mate nor I had mentioned

this</B>
<P><B>to her, so I was pretty surprised to hear her ask this but also relieved

to</B>
<P><B>know that I wasn't slowly loosing my mind.  She told me that the

previous</B>
<P><B>night that when she turned off her lamp to go to bed that her stereo

had</B>
<P><B>turned on by itself.  The stereo was on the opposite side of the room

from</B>
<P><B>where her lamp was, so an accident was out of the question.  She later

told</B>
<P><B>me that she and her family had had a history of dealing with

hauntings</B>
<P><B>where they lived.  Perhaps the increase in activity was somehow tied

to</B>
<P><B>her.  Not that I'm accusing her of anything.  I'm just exploring the</B>
<P><B>possibilities.  </B>
<P><B>	Things came pretty much to a head on my last night in the apartment.

 I</B>
<P><B>had just completed my last final exam and was going to bed early since

I</B>
<P><B>had to get up very early the next morning to get ready for the long

drive</B>
<P><B>home for Christmas.  When I climbed into bed, I was the only one in

the</B>
<P><B>apartment.  One of my room mates was already on vacation, and my new

room</B>
<P><B>mate was gone for a final exam.  As I lay in bed, I could hear a

faint</B>
<P><B>rattling, clanking sound.  As the noise grew louder, I realized that</B>
<P><B>something what shaking the silverware drawers.  It grew so violent
that I</B>
<P><B>could hear the drawers sliding out and being slammed home.  I jumped
out of</B>
<P><B>bed and ran to the kitchen.  No one was there and nothing seemed very

out</B>
<P><B>of place.  I looked in the silverware drawer and saw that things had

been</B>
<P><B>thrown all around into chaos in the drawer.  I usually kept things

very</B>
<P><B>neat, so I knew that something had been going on.  I hadn't been just</B>
<P><B>hearing things.  I went back to bed and the noise resumed almost</B>
<P><B>immediately with a renewed vigor and fury.  I was downright afraid
to go</B>
<P><B>back out because I didn't have the faintest idea of what might have

been</B>
<P><B>out there.  I laid awake for about half an hour listening to the

growing</B>
<P><B>racket when my room mate came back for her final.  All of the noise

stopped</B>
<P><B>instantly.  The relief I felt at not being alone in there allowed me

to</B>
<P><B>unwind enough so that my fatigue could overcome me and let me sleep.
 </B>
<P><B>	My room mate said that she was going to cleanse the apartment when
I was</B>
<P><B>gone, and I don't doubt that she did just that.  I only went back in

there</B>
<P><B>once, and that was to pack up my things for my move to where I was
going to</B>
<P><B>student teach.  I hope things went well for my room mates after I left,

but</B>
<P><B>I wasn't going to stick around to see.  I was more than a little

relieved</B>
<P><B>to be out of there after that last night.</B>
<P><B>	I know that Washington State University has something of a reputation

for</B>
<P><B>being a party school, and I did more than my fair share, but let me</B>
<P><B>reassure you that I was completely in control of my faculties when
I had</B>
<P><B>the experiences I listed above, other than being scared out of my wits

by</B>
<P><B>the last incident.  Everything that I described really happened as
I</B>
<P><B>described them here.  I was a little skeptical about hauntings before,

but</B>
<P><B>after this, I am a true believer.</B>

<P>
<P><B>The year was 1971, Delmar Md. I was playing in the kitchen floor when
I was</B>
<P><B>2 and a half years old. We were living in a 200 year old house, built</B>
<P><B>before the Civil War. I was playing with my toys and blocks. A man

wearing</B>
<P><B>a Civil War uniform of the Confederacy came and sat down in front of
me and</B>
<P><B>started playing with me. We played for quite a while, as my mom told
me I</B>
<P><B>was there for about an hour. My mom came down the stairs and stopped

just</B>
<P><B>before she got into the kitchen. She was stunned and horrified by the

sight</B>
<P><B>of me playing with the apparition of a soldier. She watched and

couldn't</B>
<P><B>move. After a while, the apparition got up and walked through the

chimney</B>
<P><B>where there once used to be a door. We found out later the man was
a</B>
<P><B>relative. He was my great great (?) grandfather. He was killed in the

war</B>
<P><B>with a bullet through the heart. We had his uniform, but it

disappeared</B>
<P><B>just like he did. Since then, the house has been torn down and

another</B>
<P><B>building now stands where it was.  This story is that of a friend of
mine who</B>

<H3><A NAME=craft>Craft Store Ghost</A>
</H3><P><B>by n9682266@cc.wwu.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>About eleven years ago, my mother worked at a small town craft store,</B>
<P><B>owned by my aunt.  The shop had once been someone's home but that was

at</B>
<P><B>least forty or more years ago.  I used to hang out at the store after</B>
<P><B>school.  It was my job at closing time to shut off all the lights and</B>
<P><B>lock the doors while my mother tallied up the day's sales.  It was</B>
<P><B>always a pain finding the lights switches in the seven cramped rooms</B>
<P><B>because they (the switches) were in such strange places, most often</B>
<P><B>behind things, but I made it a game to find them every night.  One

night</B>
<P><B>when we were closing up, I was in one of the rooms and was reaching

for</B>
<P><B>the light switch when it clicked itself off.  I thought that was

strange</B>
<P><B>so I tried to turn it on again, but before I could, it clicked itself</B>
<P><B>back on, switch and all. Figuring that my mother had shut the light

off</B>
<P><B>some other way, I called out to her that it wasn't fair to click the</B>
<P><B>light off for me.  As I said that, the switch clicked itself off.</B>
<P><B>Completely unnerved, I ran back out to the main room and told my

mother</B>
<P><B>what had happened but she only laughed and said that the lighting in

old</B>
<P><B>houses can be very strange.  I knew about faulty lighting in old

houses,</B>
<P><B>but that didn't account for the switch itself moving too!  As we were</B>
<P><B>leaving, we did a quick walk though (as we did every night) to make

sure</B>
<P><B>things were ready for the morning.  It was then that we noticed the</B>
<P><B>light was on in the same room in which I'd had my scare.  My mother</B>
<P><B>scolded me for leaving the light on, and as soon as she finished the</B>
<P><B>scolding, the light clicked off.  Feeling brave, I yelled something

like</B>
<P><B>"stop that!" and to our amazement the light switch started clicking

on</B>
<P><B>and off again and finally stayed on.  We quickly moved to click the</B>
<P><B>light off again (which it did for us) and left the building as

quickly</B>
<P><B>as possible.  Thinking this was strange; we mentioned it to my aunt

the</B>
<P><B>next day.  She said she wasn't surprised, often as she was closing,

the</B>
<P><B>string of sleigh bells on the main door would jingle like someone was</B>
<P><B>coming in but when she looked, the door had not, or was not moving.</B>
<P><B>She'd had other strange things happen too.  I should also mention

that</B>
<P><B>before this, my cousins and I were often told to occupy ourselves in

the</B>
<P><B>storage room as we had a habit of getting underfoot.  Theoretically,</B>
<P><B>this was an ideal place for us to be as there was a fridge, a table,

a</B>
<P><B>TV and a ton of junk to look at.  What was strange was that we always</B>
<P><B>had the feeling that we were not alone.  The room had a kind of an</B>
<P><B>unhappy feeling to it that we could never quite explain.  I remember</B>
<P><B>that my cousins and I avoided that room at all cost.  Needless to

say,</B>
<P><B>we had always figured it was our imaginations until my aunt and my</B>
<P><B>mother admitted much later that they too never felt comfortable in

that</B>
<P><B>room.  To this day I still don't know why all of those strange things</B>
<P><B>occurred.  My aunt sold the business about eight years ago and since</B>
<P><B>then, it has been home to at least three other businesses.  She told

us</B>
<P><B>several years later that legend had it (but it's best not to believe</B>
<P><B>small town legends) that a woman had once lived in the house and had</B>
<P><B>hung herself in the backroom, but as I said, it probably isn't true.

 It</B>
<P><B>certainly would explain a lot if it were true thought</B>

<H3><A NAME=navy>Is the Navy Base Haunted?</A>

<P>
<P><B>I'm a writer-editor for a Navy newspaper at the Naval Air Station on</B>
<P><B>Whidbey Island in Oak Harbor, Wash. I came across the following story

while</B>
<P><B>soliciting a ghost story for our Halloween issue last October. While</B>
<P><B>talking with Navy photographers on base about it, they had this story

to</B>
<P><B>tell me about their own facility which was built in the mid-1940s as

a</B>
<P><B>dispensary and used for that purpose until the early 70s.(This was

verified</B>
<P><B>by original Public Works drawings of the building.)</B>
<P><B>It seems the Fleet Imaging Center on base is haunted. Several of the</B>
<P><B>photographers I interviewed had compelling stories.They often hear

strange</B>
<P><B>footsteps throughout the tiled hallway when they're by themselves

after</B>
<P><B>hours. One Sailor, who has the only key beside the officer in charge,

finds</B>
<P><B>equipment turned on like radios blaring full blast the next morning.

He</B>
<P><B>thought it strange that one day the computer was on, when he knew he

turned</B>
<P><B>it off the night before, and the Xerox wasn't since they were both
on the</B>
<P><B>same power strip. Another Sailor said he felt overcome by strange

feelings</B>
<P><B>in one particular room he thinks was a formal operating room. </B>
<P><B>This following story was really strange. One Navy photographer had

the</B>
<P><B>night duty and was called at home around 2 a.m. on his beeper by the

base</B>
<P><B>Security patrolman who said he had seen a light on in their facility

while</B>
<P><B>out on patrol and a shadow looking out the window. The patrolman asked

him</B>
<P><B>to come in and open the facility to search the place. The photographer

was</B>
<P><B>met at the facility by the patrolman and his highly-trained military</B>
<P><B>working dog. The room inside the facility that the police saw the light

on</B>
<P><B>earlier was locked and it was evident the light was off from the

space</B>
<P><B>between the floor and door. The Sailor opened the door and pushed the</B>
<P><B>barking dog inside. The dog immediately came running out. Again, the

dog</B>
<P><B>was pushed inside, and again he came out and this time, hid behind

the</B>
<P><B>patrolman, who pulled out his gun, turned on the light and searched

the</B>
<P><B>room.  But nothing was there. </B>
<P><B>Another Sailor told me his experience while working one Saturday by

himself</B>
<P><B>in the early afternoon. He had been cleaning out a storeroom, one of</B>
<P><B>several rooms off the long, wide hallway. He had heard the door open</B>
<P><B>between the front office and hallway and someone coming down the

hallway.</B>
<P><B>He yelled out that he was in the storeroom and came out to see who

was</B>
<P><B>there...but he saw no more. </B>
<P><B>Are there former patients walking the hallway to the old building?
No one</B>
<P><B>knows. Thought you might find this story interesting.</B>

<H3><A NAME=it>It Liked the Corvette</A>
</H3><P><B>by dksteere@uswest.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Years ago I lived in West Mifflin, PA. (a suburb of Pittsburgh) on
a</B>
<P><B>long road that ran down through a deep valley toward the river. 

There</B>
<P><B>were two entrances to this road - - - one was at the top of the

valley,</B>
<P><B>off a busy four-lane street.  My townhouse sat a few hundred yards

from</B>
<P><B>this intersection, and this was the one I always used.  The other</B>
<P><B>entrance lay three miles from our house at the bottom of the valle,</B>
<P><B>joining a two lane road following the bank of the river.  About half

a</B>
<P><B>mile from this intersection there was an enormous tunnel - - - a

place</B>
<P><B>where the valley had literally been filled in with earth to allow the</B>
<P><B>train tracks to cross.  A two lane tunnel, cement, finished with a</B>
<P><B>bricked floor and cement curbs carried the road beneath the railroad.</B>
<P><B>The first time I saw it, the tunnel made an impression because it

seemed</B>
<P><B>so odd and out of place.  The road itself was very small and narrow,</B>
<P><B>turning to the pavement falling apart and actually turning to dirt
on</B>
<P><B>the other side of the tunnel.  It took me a while to get spooked. 

The</B>
<P><B>first few times we drove through, we were in our old Volkswagen

beetle,</B>
<P><B>and nothing unusual happened.  (Or maybe nothing happened because we</B>
<P><B>didn't stop then.  We just drove through.)  Eventually, though, my</B>
<P><B>husband got the brilliant idea to drive down there in his 1973

Corvette</B>
<P><B>and try out the "sound effects" in the tunnel.  Before long, he

wanted</B>
<P><B>to go down there every time we went out in the car, and he wanted to</B>
<P><B>stop in the middle of the tunnel to rev the engine and listen to the</B>
<P><B>echoes.  Every time he did this, I almost went out of my mind.  There</B>
<P><B>was something in that tunnel - - - something dead, evil, and mean.

 And</B>
<P><B>when we stopped, I could feel it trying to get inside the car.  My</B>
<P><B>husband would just laugh, telling me I was silly.  He didn't feel</B>
<P><B>anything strange in there.  But it got to the point where I finally</B>
<P><B>refused point-blank to go into that tunnel.  (A couple of times I</B>
<P><B>actually jumped out of the car when it was still moving, and started

to</B>
<P><B>walk back the other way.  You couldn't drive fast enough on that

surface</B>
<P><B>to sustain serious injury, and it worked.  Before long, he gave up

his</B>
<P><B>"hobby".</B>
<P><B>    I didn't go near the tunnel again, and didn't think any more

about</B>
<P><B>it until a couple of years later, when a traffic accident closed the</B>
<P><B>upper intersection.  I had to go to work, so I gritted my teeth, got</B>
<P><B>into my Volkswagen, and prepared to face the infamous tunnel.  When
I</B>
<P><B>got there, I decided maybe I had been a little silly.  So I stopped</B>
<P><B>inside the tunnel, gunned my engine, waited for the thing to make its</B>
<P><B>presence known.  It didn't.  Courageous, I later went back there in

the</B>
<P><B>Corvette, stopped in the tunnel, and almost immediately felt a palm

and</B>
<P><B>five wet, clammy fingers close around my upper arm.</B>
<P><B>    I set the land speed record getting out of there.  I've never

been</B>
<P><B>able to find out what was in that tunnel, what happened to put it

there,</B>
<P><B>or what it wanted.  I only know that it was very, very fond of</B>
<P><B>sportscars.  And the people who drive them.</B>

<P>
<P><B>There was a time when my sister and I were teased and tormented by</B>
<P><B>the ghosts in our house.  I remember one night quite vividly:</B>
<P><B>	I was up late talking on the phone with a "boyfriend" and my</B>
<P><B>sister was lying in bed next to me(although she is 8 years older than

me,</B>
<P><B>she was too scared to sleep by herself because of earlier frightening</B>
<P><B>experiences.)Just as I was getting off the phone, my sister claimed

that</B>
<P><B>she heard someone calling her name.  I said that I didn't hear

anything,</B>
<P><B>because I hadn't.  Then as I lay ther trying to get some sleep I

heard</B>
<P><B>someone call my name.  I thought it was my sister since it was so close

to</B>
<P><B>my ear, but it wasn't her.  I then heard various other voices calling

out</B>
<P><B>to both me and my sister.  There were mens voices and womens voices

and</B>
<P><B>there were little kid voices.  Then the voices got harsh and they began

to</B>
<P><B>speak profanities about my sister and I.  This of course frightened

us,</B>
<P><B>but we were to scared to get up.  While the voices were berating us,

there</B>
<P><B>began to be thumpings on the wall.  They were at one minute over our</B>
<P><B>headboard, then the next they'd be on the other side of the room by

the</B>
<P><B>window.  We heard rustlings in the closet, and the closet doors were</B>
<P><B>shaking, and still we were to scared to get up.  The two of us were</B>
<P><B>hugging eachother in the middle of the bed.  As night drew on, we began

to</B>
<P><B>see looming black figures, surrounding the bed.  It was as if they

were</B>
<P><B>performing a ritual of sorts.  There were shadows blacker than black</B>
<P><B>dancing on the walls, and flying over our heads.  The floor boards

creaked</B>
<P><B>as if someone walked on them, but there was no one there to do so.
 At one</B>
<P><B>horrid point in the night, shining orbs and rays of light came

shooting</B>
<P><B>out of the walls at our heads.  They were just missing our heads. 

And</B>
<P><B>still all the while, the voices and black figures remained, the black</B>
<P><B>figures had no faces, but I knew they were watching us.  I could feel

them</B>
<P><B>leaning over me and staring into my face.  As daylight came, there
was a</B>
<P><B>tapping at our window(second floor), we finally worked up the courage

to</B>
<P><B>leave or room, and as we hastily exited there was a figure of a man</B>
<P><B>standing at the bottom of our stairs.  He slowly disappeared and we

ran</B>
<P><B>out of the house.  When we returned, the tapping on our window also</B>
<P><B>returned, but there was no one outside throwing rocks.  I have to say

this</B>
<P><B>was one of my most frightening experiences among the many i have</B>
<P><B>experieced in my house. </B>

<H3><A NAME=ghostly>Ghostly Experience</A>
</H3><P><B>by foldes@shaw.wave.ca</B>
<P>
<P><B>I myself believed to have been haunted by a ghost, when I was around</B>
<P><B>four till seven years old.  My family lived in Vancouver then, and
I</B>
<P><B>still have faint recollections of some of the experiences.  One of

the</B>
<P><B>first things I remember was waking up in the middle of the night and

I</B>
<P><B>felt an unusual presence.  I looked over my shoulder and I saw this</B>
<P><B>figure.  The figure had a white outline, and no face.  I quickly

turned</B>
<P><B>over, and then without hesitation I turned back, and nothing was

there.</B>
<P><B>The next supernatural event that happened, occurred once again during</B>
<P><B>the night.  I had the coat rack in the shape of a clown in my room.
 I</B>
<P><B>remember getting up from bed, and going to the bathroom.  When I went</B>
<P><B>back to my room, the coat rack was in the middle of the hallway.  The</B>
<P><B>clown's face looked scarier then it usually did.  I ran to my parent

s</B>
<P><B>room, and when my mom escorted me back, the coat rack was back in my</B>
<P><B>room.  We got rid of the coat rack, but that didn't stop whatever it</B>
<P><B>was. The last occurrence I remember was several pokes on my back,

while</B>
<P><B>I was sleeping.  The poking on my back continued until I was seven

when</B>
<P><B>we sold the house, and moved.  I'm almost twenty now, and to this day</B>
<P><B>I'm pretty sure that it was more then just a child's active

imagination.</B>

</H3><P><B>by Tsimmu@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>About 5 years ago, my then boyfriend and I were back in my native East

Tennessee  to visit a girlfriend from college. We were out for a drive one

evening about dusk on a two lane secondary road that has since been widened
to four lane due to extreme growth in West Knoxville. We approached a blind
curve that separates two hills with a dip into a valley. As we got to the
top of the first hill, we saw what appeared to be a very bad wreck complete
with police cruisers blocking the road with their lights on, an ambulance,
and tow trucks. Since this looked like a pretty bad wreck and the road was

blocked we decided to turn around in an apartment complex parking lot and
take another route. Well, when we came back to the entrance of the complex
where we had turned around, the wreck was GONE! Completely! Not so much as
a policeman writing up a report or a tow truck driving away. Now, mind you,
it took maybe 45 seconds for us to pull into the complex and turn around
and there was NO WAY, based on the severity of the wreck that it could have
been cleared that quickly. We even drove down to the area where we saw the
wreck and there were no skid marks, no glass, nothing. </B>
<P>
<P><B>All I know is that we all three saw it as we discussed waiting for
it to clear or turning around and we are all sane, college educated adults.Do
you have any clues? I thought about perhaps checking old public records about
any fatal wrecks that may have occurred in the past during August, when we
"saw" the wreck. </B>

bridge,</B>
<P><B>I noticed a woman sitting on the south rail in her nightgown.  When
I</B>
<P><B>looked in the rear-view mirror, she was miraculously on the other

side.</B>
<P><B>Believing the woman to be intoxicated, I turned the car around and</B>
<P><B>approached slowly around the curve.  When I got to where the woman

was,</B>
<P><B>she was gone.  Jumped?  Not likely, but I checked anyway. I was

already</B>
<P><B>out of the car, peering over the north rail with a spotlight, when
I</B>
<P><B>noticed a woman standing in the yard of a house located on the

northeast</B>
<P><B>corner of the approach.  A faint glow seemed to surround her and when

I</B>
<P><B>directed my spotlight toward her, she disappeared in the light.  It</B>
<P><B>wasn't until a couple of years later that another police officer</B>
<P><B>mentioned that other strange happenings were afoot in that locale.
</B>
<P><B>Almost all sightings were of a woman seen in the upper rooms of the</B>
<P><B>house, but never outside. I have always told this story as an</B>
<P><B>amusement...as I still am quite skeptical.  Some dismiss the

happenings</B>
<P><B>as sqirrels reflecting the streetlights; some dismiss them as chance,</B>
<P><B>and others like myself explain them as "my mind playing tricks on me."
