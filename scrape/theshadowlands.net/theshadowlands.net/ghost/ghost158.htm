<b>The Bride at the Bridge</b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; treeflowers@myworldmail.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Sprucevale, Ohio. Beaver Creek State Park</b>
<br><b>There are of course several versions of this tale. Many blend the
tale of Esther with the Legend of Gretchen's Lock because they took place
within approximately 1/2 mile of each other.The tale of Esther Hale, also
known as the Bride at the Bridge took place in a small canal community
known as Sprucevale. All that is left of this area is an old Grist Mill
(Hambleton's Mill), an old building and the remains of two locks on the
Sandy and Beaver Canal.When the community was alive and busy Esther Hale
was to be married. In the book "Spooky Ohio"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;(1995) and "Haunted Ohio II" (1992) Chris Woodyard describes
the story, " On the morning of August 12, 1837, Esther Hale hummed happily&nbsp;
to herself as she put on her white dress and veil. It was her wedding day.&nbsp;
The table in the parlor was decorated with flowers and vines. The cake
was in the kitchen, covered with cheesecloth to keep off the flies. The
wedding was set for ten in the morning.But by half past ten the groom had
not arrived and the guests and parson were beginning to fidget. At half
past twelve, they climbed into their wagons and drove</b>
<br><b>away. The messenger Esther sent could find no trace of the bridegroom.
His cabin was deserted, said the man, and the&nbsp; ashes in the stove
were cold.When Esther's friends tried to help her to bed, Esther shook
her head, the tears running down her face.&nbsp; Finally they left her
alone in the dark by the window in the parlor. When they returned the next
morning, the curtains were drawn, as if for a funeral. They were never
again opened in Esther Hale's lifetime.All Summer Esther moved like a ghost
through the house. In the kitchen,beetles tunneled through the cake. The
wedding flowers withered under the spider's veils in the parlor. Esther's
friends coaxed her to eat</b>
<br><b>and drink a little, but when they tried to get her to change her&nbsp;
dress or remove the wedding decorations, she flew at them with claw-like
fingers. Finally they left her alone.Broken hearts kill slowly. Four months
later neighbor noticed that the door to Esther's house was open,&nbsp;
banging back and forth in the December wind. He told the sheriff and the
doctor who took a party of men to the dark house. Snow had drifted throughout
the house like a white shroud.Esther was slumped over the parlor windowsill,
her veil over her face. Someone held up a lantern.</b>
<br><b>The doctor drewback the shredded lace. Esther had been dead for
several weeks. When they saw the horror beneath, they silently covered
her over again. She was buried so, shrouded in her wedding clothes.</b>
<br><b>But burial did not put an end to Esther Hale. It is said by the
locals that you can still see her, dressed in white, looking for her bridegroom
on the bridge over Beaver Creek in Columbiana County. She waits there every
year on August 12, a hideous figure in tattered&nbsp; white satin and lace.
And if she touches you she will become young and beautiful again----but
you will die."</b>

<p><b>Hurtful Visitor</b>
<p><b>By: benshaw@webtv.net</b>
<p><b>Thank you for providing a forum to help me try and explain the</b>
<br><b>"unexplained".&nbsp; It is events such as these that are so beyond
reality</b>
<br><b>that you fear sharing it with others lest they label you insane.</b>
<p><b>My fiance and I moved into a condo unit in South Florida in Sept.,
1999,</b>
<br><b>with our three children (his one and my two).&nbsp; The unit owner
from whom</b>
<br><b>we rent is from Haiti and is a very nice lady.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day
we moved in, we</b>
<br><b>found in the kitchen cabinet above the stove certain paraphenalia
that</b>
<br><b>indicated she practiced Santaria (island voodoo).&nbsp; The cabinet
contained</b>
<br><b>black candles that had melted its wax onto the shelf (signs of burning</b>
<br><b>it in the cabinet) and cloves sprinkled all around.&nbsp; We cleaned
it all</b>
<br><b>up and threw away the paraphenalia.&nbsp; Such practices are common
place in</b>
<br><b>this area due to the number of transplanted Haitians.&nbsp; We never
gave it</b>
<br><b>much thought at the time.&nbsp; And I have to be honest and tell
you neither</b>
<br><b>one of us has ever experienced any paranormal events in our lives
before</b>
<br><b>this; thus, we never had a reason to believe in such things.</b>
<p><b>In November, 1999, about a week before Thanksgiving, on a Saturday</b>
<br><b>morning at 11:00 a.m., I was in the kitchen washing the breakfast</b>
<br><b>dishes.&nbsp; My fiance was sitting at our dining room table, which
is</b>
<br><b>separated from the kitchen sink area only by an eating bar.&nbsp;
He was</b>
<br><b>maybe three feet away from me.&nbsp; His chair was turned so he
could face me</b>
<br><b>as we talked about nothing in particular.&nbsp; As we were chatting,
he said</b>
<br><b>out loud, "Wow!"&nbsp; I asked what.&nbsp; He said, "I just felt
a very cold chill</b>
<br><b>go right through me.&nbsp; It entered my back and came out of my
chest.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>felt like it got stuck coming out and had to pull itself free."&nbsp;
He said</b>
<br><b>he felt the sensation of something or someone approaching him from</b>
<br><b>behind right before he felt the chill.&nbsp; I was a little stunned
and just</b>
<br><b>stared at him.&nbsp; I then went back to my chores.&nbsp; A few
minutes later, he</b>
<br><b>called my name.&nbsp; I looked up. He had pulled his shirt sleeves
up and on</b>
<br><b>both upper arms he had angry welts.&nbsp; He said they were stinging
(which</b>
<br><b>is why he pulled up his sleeves and looked).&nbsp; I walked over
to him for a</b>
<br><b>closer look.&nbsp; The welts were beginning to subside and what
was left were</b>
<br><b>definite scratch marks, three in a row on each forearm, undoubtedly
made</b>
<br><b>my long fingernails.&nbsp; My fiance's first reaction was to look
at my hands</b>
<br><b>(even though I was not standing close enough to touch him at the
time)</b>
<br><b>to remind himself that I did not have long nails.&nbsp; We were
both left</b>
<br><b>very unsettled by this and couldn't believe our eyes.&nbsp; We phoned
his</b>
<br><b>mother to come over and see it for herself, as if trying to verify
our</b>
<br><b>own sanity.</b>
<p><b>Well, the day wore on and we sort of put it out of our minds as</b>
<br><b>something we couldn't explain.&nbsp; We talked a little about our
landlord's</b>
<br><b>practice and chalked it up as maybe some unexplained residual of</b>
<br><b>Santaria, though we know very little about it.</b>
<p><b>That night, we went to bed as usual.&nbsp; I checked my fiance's
arms before</b>
<br><b>retiring.&nbsp; The scratches were still present and the swelling
was gone.</b>
<p><b>At about 4:00 a.m., I was awakened from a very restful sleep by my</b>
<br><b>fiance shouting and literally scrambling to get out of the bed.&nbsp;
I sat</b>
<br><b>up, feeling very startled.&nbsp; He turned on the bedroom light
and lifted</b>
<br><b>the tee-shirt he was wearing while sleeping.&nbsp; There, across
his chest,</b>
<br><b>were two more rows of scratches, in a criss-cross pattern, swollen
and</b>
<br><b>on the brink of bleeding.&nbsp; The scratches were PERFECTLY patterned,
as if</b>
<br><b>put there by an exacting knife, the same distance between each scratch,</b>
<br><b>and all were in perfect lines.&nbsp; Needless to say, we got up
for the rest</b>
<br><b>of the night, feeling very frightened.&nbsp; We went into the kitchen
and I</b>
<br><b>took photographs of his chest.&nbsp; I had them developed the next
day.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>pictures didn't come out very clear, but you can see the scratches
on</b>
<br><b>his chest.&nbsp; He told me that at the time it happened, he thought
he was</b>
<br><b>dreaming and felt a presence on top of him.&nbsp; He felt the heaviness
and</b>
<br><b>darkness of something or someone over him and then felt a burning</b>
<br><b>sensation on his chest.&nbsp; That's when he "awoke" shouting.</b>
<p><b>The next day, we tried to rationalize these occurrences without much</b>
<br><b>success.&nbsp; I was very frightened by it and was afraid to be
left alone in</b>
<br><b>the house.&nbsp; I retrieved from my jewelry box a cross pendant
and hung it</b>
<br><b>on our dresser.&nbsp; We prayed heavily that God would remove this
presence</b>
<br><b>from our home, a presence intent on causing physical harm.&nbsp;
Nothing has</b>
<br><b>happened since that last occurrence, some five months ago.&nbsp;
To this day,</b>
<br><b>our children are unaware of what happened.&nbsp; Nothing strange
or</b>
<br><b>unexplained has occurred in our house since.&nbsp; It took several
weeks for</b>
<br><b>the scratch marks to disappear from my fiance's skin.&nbsp; We are
left with</b>
<br><b>the faith that God answered our prayers, and the cross will always
hang</b>
<br><b>from our dresser.</b>
<p><b>I will always wonder what happened and why.&nbsp; What was it?&nbsp;
Why did it</b>
<br><b>choose my fiance?&nbsp; Why did it not bother me when I was only
a few feet</b>
<br><b>away during the first occurrence, and laying right beside him during
the</b>
<br><b>second?&nbsp; For the first few months, we were afraid to talk about
it, as</b>
<br><b>if pretending it didn't happen would prevent its recurrence.&nbsp;
As time</b>
<br><b>goes by without another occurrence, my psyche has healed enough
to try</b>
<br><b>and think it through.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I still don't have any
answers,</b>
<br><b>and realize I never will.&nbsp; I don't know what drew me to your
site this</b>
<br><b>morning, after months of not really thinking about it.&nbsp; And
I'm sure</b>
<br><b>it's coincidental, but my fiance told me he thought about it again
last</b>
<br><b>night after months of putting it out of his mind.</b>

<p><b>THE LADY OF THE HOUSE</b>
<p><b>By: Plippe@email.msn.com</b>
<p><b>&nbsp; Now I would like to tell you about my own experiences while</b>
<br><b>living in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; I moved into the second floor apartment
in 1979, in time I learned the second floor apartment was also where the
Old Lady had lived. At the time I knew nothing about the history of the
house.</b>
<br><b>My first night there I awoke to the feeling of someone standing
besde my bed, starring down at me.&nbsp; I felt no fear only the presents
and after a few minutes fell back to sleep.&nbsp; This occured three nights
in a row and at some point I dont know why but I decided this person was
a lady.&nbsp; Over the next few weeks I noticed that the house would shake
and vibrate a lot.&nbsp; But I really did'nt think to much about this because
I knew there was a railroad track just a block or so away.&nbsp; The other
thing I noticed in those first weeks was the cellar.&nbsp; To begin&nbsp;
with the house was very old and it had one of those dark, damp, creepy,
cellars with a dirt floor.&nbsp; The kind of cellar you only go into if</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;you really have to.&nbsp; Unfortunately you had to go into
this cellar alot because the lights were always going off, and the circuit
breaker to&nbsp; turn them back on was in the cellar.&nbsp; Some days the
lights would go out as many as four or five times, which could have been
due to the age&nbsp; of the house or bad wiring.&nbsp; But that does not
explain the problems that I had going into the cellar.As long as it was
daylight everything&nbsp; was fine, but any time after sundown that changed.
By the way the circuit breaker was right at the bottom of the stairs, so
I did'nt have</b>
<br><b>to go any distances into the cellar Thank God.&nbsp; The few times
that I actual did make it down the stairs a deep feeling of dread came
over me, like a great danger awaited.&nbsp; But even weired were the countless
times that I could not or was not allowed to enter the cellar at night.&nbsp;
On all of these occasions one of two things would</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;happen.&nbsp; As I reached for the door knob static electricity
would jump from the knob to my hand, while my hand was still 3 to 4 inches
away from the knob.&nbsp; You could actually see the electricity leave
the door knob and go to my hand, several people witnessed this at different
times.&nbsp; In fact we even experimented with it, I would reach&nbsp;
out to touch the knob and there was the electricity, they would reach out
and touch the knob and nothing ever happen. This was tried several times
with different people, the results were always the same.&nbsp; The second
thing that would happen was the icy cold wind, not a strong wind but much
more than a breeze. I would get the door open and start</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;down the stairs, but as I reached the second or third step
an ice cold wind would come up the stairs and blow into me as if trying
to push me back.&nbsp; I do'nt know why but I sensed this wind started
in the center of the cellar, went round the cellar and then came up the
stairs.&nbsp; However it did all of this very fast.&nbsp; Once again I
always felt in great danger when either of these things happened.&nbsp;
And yet my fear still&nbsp; was not towards the Old Lady.&nbsp; For some
reason I felt as if she were pritecting me from some other danger by not
allowing me to enter the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;cellar after dark.&nbsp; What other danger I'll never know
(maybe I would have fallen down the stairs and broke my neck.) because
needless to say I stopped trying to go into the cellar after dark.</b>
<br><b>For the first six years of living in the house I had never seen
the Old Lady's darker side.&nbsp; My four children and I felt no danger
in her presents, in fact I still felt protected some how. The family on
the first floor were not really strong believers in ghost and did not feel&nbsp;
her presents like myself and some others did.&nbsp; However because of
things they had and were about to witness they were fast becoming believers.&nbsp;
In the coming year we would all see the Old Lady's darker side.&nbsp; It
started with out renting out fo the third floor apartment.&nbsp; This apartment
was vacate most of the time because unlike the first and second floors
it was four very small rooms. It was best suited for a single person which
made it hard to rent out .&nbsp; In six years it had only been rented out
two other times, nether stayed longer than a few months, nether had any
problems with the Old Lady that I know of.</b>
<br><b>But that year a woman in her mid-twenties ( who I'll call Ann )
moved in.&nbsp; She was very nice and made friends easily with myself and
the people on the first floor.&nbsp; At the time she was in no serious
relationships and was dating different men.&nbsp; She worked days and came
home late most nights as she went out after work.&nbsp; Everyone seemed
to find her a very easy going, pleasant person to be around.&nbsp; But
the Old</b>
<br><b>Lady did'nt seem to feel this way and started to show her darker
side right away.&nbsp; After living in the apartment for only a few days,
Ann&nbsp; told me she liked the apartment but felt very uncomfortable in
it although she did'nt know why.&nbsp; By the second week she said she
felt like someone was always watching her, which caused her great fear.&nbsp;
At this point I asked her if she&nbsp; had heard about the legend of the
house , and she had'nt so I told her the story and about my own experiences.&nbsp;
I told her the Old Lady was really harmless and that she was just there,
but never really bothered anyone.&nbsp; But in the weeks to come the Old
Lady would prove me wrong.</b>
<br><b>As the weeks went by Ann's feelings of fear turned to feeling of
great danger.&nbsp; She felt this way at all times when in the house, but
the&nbsp; feeling was stronger at night.&nbsp; Since she came in late nights
I was normally sleeping and did;nt witness the first five or six nights
of the knocking. She stated that every night only minutes after getting
home, she would hear a knocking at her back door.&nbsp; She would go to
the door but no one was ever there.&nbsp; All of the back doors in the
house had double doors. The inside door was a solid door and then there
was a small hallway, then the actual outside door. Which had a window in
it so you did'nt have to open the out side door only the one</b>
<br><b>before the hallway to see if someone was at the door.&nbsp; When
she went back into the house and closed the door the knocking would start
again, this would happen two to three times before stopping. By the third
week the knocking had increased in volume, it was now loud enough to wake
me up out of a sleep.&nbsp; At first I though it was someone playing a
rooten joke on her, so for the next few nights when the knocking woke me
up I would go up to her apartment the front way and we would go to the
back door together. But we never found anyone</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;there,and each night the knocking grew louder so that by this
time it was now loud banging.&nbsp; After talking with the first floor,
we decided&nbsp; to work together and came up with a plan to catch who
ever was doing this.&nbsp; The plan was simple, but would work. As soon
as I was awaken by&nbsp; the banging ( at this point the banging was not
waking the people on the first floor yet although I do'nt know how it did'nt
) I would call down stairs and wake them. Then myself and the woman on
the first floor would go up to Ann's the front way, while the woman's husband
would</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;go up the back way.&nbsp; There by trapping anyone on the
stairs or the porches.&nbsp; We did this for two nights and although we
checked every possible place a person could hide we never found any one
or thing that could be causing the banging.&nbsp; On the third night of
our plan we&nbsp; all realized this was no one playing a joke. That night
everyone in the house awoke to a loud booming, that actually shook the
whole house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I ran to Ann's apartment and was joined by the first floor
only minutes later.&nbsp; Ann was inside and guite hyterical, we could'nt
get her to open the door to let us in.&nbsp; The booming was deafing and
continued for about another five minutes before stopping, during this time
Ann was still refusing to let us in.&nbsp; After about five minutes all
went suddenly guite except for Ann who was crying hysterically on the other
side&nbsp; of the door. At some point Ann must have called the police,
because as we were talking to her though the door trying to calm her down,
two</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;officers arrived.&nbsp; After alot of talking they finally
got her to open the door.&nbsp; And when she did I was in no way prepared
for the way she&nbsp; looked. She was as I said before hysterical, with
this wild look in her eyes, her hair was a mess, and in her hands was a
butcher knife that she held out and front of her.&nbsp; And all the officers
could get out of her was that she opened the back door and there was an
old lady,&nbsp; with her face right up to the window looking in at her.
At this point we told the police officers the whole story old lady included
(which I'm sure made them think we were all nuts ) however they checked
the whole apartment building and surrounding area and found nothing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;By now I had taken Ann down to my apartment and calmed her
down enough to get her parents phone number, who I called and they were
coming&nbsp; to pick her up.&nbsp; Because her parents were coming to get
her and she had finally put down the knife after talking with the officers,
they&nbsp; agreed to let her go home with her parents. Ann never returned
to the house again, not even to get her things.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the house?&nbsp;
It settled back down, and went back to it's old ways.&nbsp; I lived there
another four years after all this happened.&nbsp; And&nbsp; although I
could still feel the Old Lady's presents, she remained quite.</b>

<p><b>Strange but True</b>
<p><b>By: adriantl@usa.net</b>
<p><b>These events happened when I was in college, which was around 15
years ago.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>am not making any of this up and the experience was as real as my
sitting here</b>
<br><b>typing this on my computer.&nbsp; I was studying for a major in
Psychology and I</b>
<br><b>always had a fascination for parapsychology.&nbsp; One day at a
bookstore I found a</b>
<br><b>tape called ‘Astral Projection’ that would make someone leave his
body</b>
<br><b>temporarily.&nbsp; Strange, I know but I was curious about either
proving or</b>
<br><b>disproving that kind of thing for a research paper.&nbsp; Anyway,
one side of the</b>
<br><b>tape had the recording of a really corny voice telling to leave
your body and</b>
<br><b>the other side was ‘subliminal’ that was masked by music.&nbsp;
I tried the tape a</b>
<br><b>few times with no success so I listened to the subliminal side quite
a lot as</b>
<br><b>it had soft music and it helped me study even after finishing my
research</b>
<br><b>paper on the topic. About six months later during the summer break
I had gone</b>
<br><b>home to my parents house and lay down in my room to take a nap.&nbsp;
I turned off</b>
<br><b>my radio, turned the ceiling fan on high, lay down on my bed looking
up at the</b>
<br><b>ceiling.&nbsp; After a few minutes I felt that I was paralyzed.&nbsp;
I could not move.</b>
<br><b>I was pretty comfortable and felt no fear so I just lay there.&nbsp;
Then, all of a</b>
<br><b>sudden, my body seemed to shake violently and I head a loud crackling
sound</b>
<br><b>like a radio station off tune.&nbsp; I was able to move my head
enough to look down</b>
<br><b>at my body and it was still and motionless yet I could ‘feel’ my
whole body</b>
<br><b>vibrating and shaking.&nbsp; Weird!&nbsp; I was fully awake during
this event.&nbsp; I then</b>
<br><b>looked up to the ceiling and saw the ceiling fan spinning VERY slowly.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>looked like it was on slow motion.&nbsp; The shaking then became
more violent and</b>
<br><b>the noise in my ears grew louder and then it became a hiss growing
softer.</b>
<br><b>The shaking then changed into smoother vibrations.&nbsp; I started
to see the</b>
<br><b>ceiling getting larger and larger and felt a floating sensation.&nbsp;
Then I heard</b>
<br><b>my mom put the keys in the door and opened the front door of the
house, I</b>
<br><b>heard footsteps and then the TV turning on.&nbsp; It was the road
runner going</b>
<br><b>‘beep beep’ and my mom said Be quiet and turn the TV off, I think
your</b>
<br><b>brother is trying to take a nap.&nbsp; Hearing these familiar sounds
I struggled</b>
<br><b>to sit-up.&nbsp; I could not move.&nbsp; I tried again this time
mustering every bit of</b>
<br><b>energy I could to sit up.&nbsp; I let out a shout, pushed and up
I came sitting</b>
<br><b>straight up in bed.&nbsp; Nothing but silence filled the air.&nbsp;
I looked up at the</b>
<br><b>ceiling fan and it was spinning normally and I sat up, shaken, and
then stood</b>
<br><b>up.&nbsp; Then I heard my mom put the keys in the door and opened
the front door of</b>
<br><b>the house, I heard footsteps and then the TV turning on.&nbsp; It
was the road</b>
<br><b>runner going ‘beep beep’ and my mom said Be quiet and turn the TV
off, I</b>
<br><b>think your brother is trying to take a nap.&nbsp; At this I panicked
because I</b>
<br><b>thought I was loosing my mind because I had just heard those same
sounds about</b>
<br><b>30 seconds before.&nbsp; I ran out of my room into the front room
and my mom said,</b>
<br><b>“Oh, I thought you were asleep.&nbsp; I hugged her and was just
happy to be back</b>
<br><b>to normal.&nbsp; It wasn’t until a few weeks later that I realized
that the tape I</b>
<br><b>had listened to may have helped create these experiences.&nbsp;
Little did I know</b>
<br><b>that this was just the beginning as I began to have them every-time
I lay down</b>
<br><b>to try to sleep</b>
<p><b>(I have more I can write later if you are interested.&nbsp; I encountered
many</b>
<br><b>things through the years including a ‘black silhouette of a man’
that scared</b>
<br><b>me badly that sounds very much the same as your encounter that I

<p><b>Sleep Deprived</b>
<p><b>BY: Lublaneski@cs.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Dear Dave, I will send to you the experience that I have had back
in1991.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>had moved to a new home in October of that year.&nbsp; The house
itself was not</b>
<br><b>actually, new, it had been built in the mid 50's.&nbsp; I was alone
with my small</b>
<br><b>dog in the house , and my fiance was planning to move in after we
were</b>
<br><b>married.&nbsp; I went to bed one night as usual, and was awakened
by voices.</b>
<br><b>Terrified, I opened my eyes to see a figure standing over my bed
with a dark</b>
<br><b>cloak and hood.&nbsp; The eyes were suken as a skeletons eyes sockets
would look.</b>
<br><b>I was able to see, because I had a nightlight on in the ajacent
bathroom.</b>
<br><b>The terror I felt seemed to imobilize me.&nbsp; I could feel my
jaw drop in horror</b>
<br><b>and I could'nt speak.&nbsp; There were more voices than just one.&nbsp;
I couldn't</b>
<br><b>understand what they were saying because the voices to me sounded
as if</b>
<br><b>someone was talking in another room and I couldn't quite understand
or make</b>
<br><b>out what was being said.&nbsp; Strangely enough I remember hearing
the last word.</b>
<br><b>It said "Smile".&nbsp; I closed my eyes momentarily and opened them
and it was</b>
<br><b>still there.&nbsp; Again I did that and finally it was gone.&nbsp;
At the time I was</b>
<br><b>going through alot of grief and I wondered if this had something
to do with</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; I only know that I could'nt sleep much that night or very
soundly for</b>
<br><b>about the next year.&nbsp; I have wondered if anyone else has experienced
anything</b>
<br><b>like this.&nbsp; Somehow I got the feeling that this figure would
not hurt me ,</b>
<br><b>but it's presence terrified me.</b>

<p><b>Paranormal Visitation, or just Sleep Paralysis?</b>
<p><b>By: Avenal [avenal@usa.com]</b>
<p><b>In order to come to terms with an occurrence I experienced as a teenager
I have spent much time questioning what really happened:&nbsp; was it paranormal,
just a dream, or (more recently) Sleep Paralysis?&nbsp; As such, I have
begun to wonder exactly what the difference between a paranormal experience
and Sleep Paralysis is . There seems to be a very fine line.&nbsp; How
do you determine if an experience was one or the other?&nbsp; Or are they
just two different ways to explain the same thing and the answer comes
down to one of personal beliefs?&nbsp; Does a "normal"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;scientific explanation always win out over a paranormal one,
even if they seem as two sides of the same mirror?&nbsp; Anyway, this was
my experience...I was 14 years old.&nbsp; I awoke suddenly and could not
move.&nbsp; My eyes were open and I could see, though it was somewhat indistinct
- like tunnel vision.&nbsp; Nothing in my room seemed out of place or different,
although I could not turn my head to look around.&nbsp; There was a palpable&nbsp;
presence that carried with it an unmistakable feeling of malevolence.&nbsp;
I did not see this presence, merely felt it looming over me.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>air seemed heavy and stifling.&nbsp; I do not recall a temperature
change at the time, but I was numb, and I recall being cold after the experience
ended.&nbsp; I could hear a loud noise that sounded like something metallic
scraping back and forth across the metal window screen repeatedly.&nbsp;
I also felt an indistinct "lump" inside of my water bed mattress moving
quickly back and forth across the small of my back, again, repeatedly.&nbsp;
I was aware of conscious thought - my mind was working even though my body
was not.&nbsp; I tried to move and tried to scream</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;and simply could not.&nbsp; I finally managed to pray and
force out the words "God help me," which subsequently ended the actual
experience.&nbsp; I literally leaped from my bed.&nbsp; I looked at the
clock and noted that it was exactly 3:00 am.&nbsp; I could still feel this
malevolent presence in&nbsp; my room so I decided to try sleeping on the
living room couch.&nbsp; My sleep was plagued with nightmares so I tried
to sleep in the chair.&nbsp; Again I was awakened by nightmares.&nbsp;
The presence remained in my bedroom and was especially strong as I passed
the door en route to my</b>
<br><b>parents' room, where I finally fell asleep on the floor.&nbsp; At
around 6:00 am I had to enter my room to get ready for school.&nbsp; The
feeling was&nbsp; still there, but had diminished in strength.&nbsp; By
the time I returned home from school it was gone.&nbsp; I have never again
experienced anything&nbsp; like that since, even though I frequently feel
as if I'm being watched (no bad feelings from it, just the general feeling
of another presence).&nbsp; I still get chills when I think about it or
talk about it.</b>
<p><b>As a side note (and perhaps a precipitating factor), at that period
I was heavily involved in the study of the occult and demonology.&nbsp;
That very afternoon I had been doing pendulum scrying and was "talking"
to a self proclaimed evil spirit that would not leave me alone.&nbsp; I
don't&nbsp; remember exactly what I said but it was to the extent of "back
off" - not a very nice way to end a "conversation."&nbsp; Food for thought...</b>

<p><b>Papa's Ghost</b>
<p><b>By: katerrell@buckman.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I just discovered Shadowlands, and it's nice to know that I'm not
the only</b>
<br><b>one with a lifetime of experiencing strange phenomenon. It seems
that</b>
<br><b>"entities" of one sort or another are attracted to me.</b>
<p><b>It started when I was just 4 years old. My family lived across the
street</b>
<br><b>from my great-grandparents in a rural area. I was watching my favorite
TV</b>
<br><b>show at the time (the Bugaloos!), when my great-grandmother came
charging</b>
<br><b>in, quite distressed, shouting that my mother had to come help her.
My</b>
<br><b>mother instructed me to "stay put!", and ran back across the street
with my</b>
<br><b>great-grandmother.</b>
<p><b>Shortly thereafter, the screen door opened, and my great-grandfather</b>
<br><b>shuffled in. He sat down on his favorite corner of the couch, and
told me to</b>
<br><b>come sit on his lap. "I have something very important to tell you,"
he said.</b>
<br><b>I adored my great-grandfather, and got on his lap with no hesitation.
My</b>
<br><b>only concern was that the show would come back on and I'd miss it.</b>
<p><b>He told me that the grown-ups around here would be crying and acting
really</b>
<br><b>sad and strange for a little while, but that I shouldn't be afraid,
and that</b>
<br><b>I shouldn't be sad. This made no sense to me, of course, so I just
nodded as</b>
<br><b>if I understood. He told me he loved me, and that he'd see me later.
He</b>
<br><b>gently put me off his lap, and I ran back to my spot in front of
the TV. I</b>
<br><b>heard the screen door open and shut as he shuffled out.</b>
<p><b>A little while later, my mother came back inside, tears streaming
down her</b>
<br><b>face. She cried as she tried to explain that my beloved "Papa" had
been very</b>
<br><b>sick, and had passed away, and that I wouldn't be seeing him anymore.
Very</b>
<br><b>matter-of-factly, I told my mother she was wrong, that Papa was
just there.</b>
<br><b>I told her what he'd said about the grownups acting strange and
sad, and I</b>
<br><b>was a bit irritated that he was right.</b>
<p><b>My mother was right, too, though. Apparently, he had died at about
the same</b>
<br><b>time he shuffled into house. To me, he had been as solid and as
real as any</b>
<br><b>other human being. He felt normal, and he had that special grandfatherly</b>
<br><b>"old man" smell of cigars and old-fashioned aftershave that he always
had.</b>
<p><b>Fifteen years later, my great-grandmother also passed away (she had
been</b>
<br><b>significantly younger than her husband). At the funeral, just after
the</b>
<br><b>casket had been lowered and the family was leaving the small country
church</b>
<br><b>cemetery, I saw someone I didn't know standing by the fence watching
me. He</b>
<br><b>had short, red hair, in an army-style buzz cut, wearing an old-fashioned</b>
<br><b>suit. He was also wearing a hat. He saw me looking, tipped his hat,
smiled</b>
<br><b>at me, and winked. I smiled back, thinking that even if I didn't
know this</b>
<br><b>particular relative, he had a sense of humor that my late great-grandmother</b>
<br><b>would have sincerely appreciated.</b>
<p><b>I assumed that he was one of the many distant country family members
that I</b>
<br><b>hadn't seen since childhood, so I turned to my father to ask who
that was.</b>
<br><b>When I turned to point the man out, he was gone. There were other
details to</b>
<br><b>attend, so I dropped the subject altogether.</b>
<p><b>A few years later, sharing coffee with my mother, I told her about
the</b>
<br><b>unfamiliar relative I'd seen at my great-grandmother's funeral.
When I</b>
<br><b>described the short red hair and the hat, her face grew pale. She
motioned</b>
<br><b>me to follow her upstairs. Once in her bedroom, she opened the steamer
trunk</b>
<br><b>at the foot of the bed that contained her most treasured mementos.
She dug</b>
<br><b>almost to the bottom of the huge chest, finally bringing out a very</b>
<br><b>familiar, dusty man's hat.</b>
<p><b>My great-grandfather had been a very old man when I was very young,
so I'd</b>
<br><b>never known him when his hair was bright orange-red. My mother told
me that</b>
<br><b>he always wore that hat when he went out, especially to a church.
There was</b>
<br><b>no question that this dusty relic was the very same hat that he
had jauntily</b>
<br><b>tipped toward me that afternoon.</b>
<p><b>I have no doubt that my great-grandfather attended my great-grandmother's</b>
<br><b>funeral. She was never good with directions. I feel sure he came
to show her</b>
<br><b>the way home.</b>

<br><b>OUR FAMILY DEPARTED...</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By:&nbsp; anonymous</b>
<p><b>I grew up in an upper middle class suburb of Chicago, Illinois and
I am a</b>
<br><b>divorced woman 42 years old. During my youth and in to my teens
things have</b>
<br><b>"happened" to me and certain members of my family. First of all,
let me say</b>
<br><b>that in looks, temperament (and evidently psychic gift) I take after
my</b>
<br><b>maternal Grandmother, not my mother.&nbsp; Grandma was a former
nun (left convent</b>
<br><b>due to ill health) who remained devoutly religious and believed
in the</b>
<br><b>supernatural (she didn't have a choice, really).&nbsp; Gosh, where
to begin? Ok,</b>
<br><b>when her brother, Wally, lay in a hospital dying she had a dream
that he came</b>
<br><b>to her and said "Don't worry, I won't go yet, you're too upset".
Doctors</b>
<br><b>removed a 27 pound tumor from his stomach and he survived.&nbsp;
Two years</b>
<br><b>later:The second tumor was wrapped all around everything inside
him and he</b>
<br><b>said to Grandma in a dream "I didn't go last time but now I have
to go.</b>
<br><b>Everything will be ok".</b>
<br><b>She was sleeping on the couch waiting for news from the hospital
when this</b>
<br><b>dream occurred and she woke up to the overpowering smell of roses.
She got up</b>
<br><b>and looked at the clock.&nbsp; Not half an hour later her sister-in-law
called to</b>
<br><b>tell her that he had died and the time of death was exactly the
time she woke</b>
<br><b>to the smell of roses.&nbsp; That following Christmas we weren't
going to put up a</b>
<br><b>tree, being in mourning at Uncle Wally's loss and neither was his
widowed</b>
<br><b>wife.&nbsp; We lived right across the street from Uncle Wally and
his family. My</b>
<br><b>Grandma was walking out the door with my Aunt Celia (their sister).
It was</b>
<br><b>cold, crisp night and the sky was clear.&nbsp; As they stepped off
our front porch</b>
<br><b>they both heard a kind of booming noise and smelled an overpowering
sulfur</b>
<br><b>smell and they both heard a voice that seemed to come from above
them say</b>
<br><b>"deck the house". Now they were both in their 60's at the time and
this</b>
<br><b>frightened them both badly. I remember when they both flew back
in the door</b>
<br><b>and told us what had happend.&nbsp; They called my Aunt Stefanie
(Wally's widow)</b>
<br><b>and told her what had happened. We did put up the tree after all.</b>
<br><b>Now we come to my experiences. When I was 6 yrs. old my Uncle Stanley
(Aunt</b>
<br><b>Celia's husband) died.&nbsp; I have gentle, fond memories of him.
One of the most</b>
<br><b>distinctive was his cigar smoking.&nbsp; The cigars had a certain
aroma that I</b>
<br><b>always identified with him as a young child. I was heartbroken when
he died.</b>
<br><b>After he passed on I would often smell his cigar smoke on my hands
or just</b>
<br><b>around me like a cloud. Now no one in our house smoked cigars or
anything</b>
<br><b>smelling remotely like his brand but whenever I experienced this
I would go</b>
<br><b>to my Gram or my mother or aunt and say "smell my hand" or "do you
smell it?"</b>
<br><b>and THEY ALWAYS DID! Even my Aunt Celia did and yet we all thought
it was so</b>
<br><b>nice but never were freaked out or afraid of it. My Grandma said
he was</b>
<br><b>watching over me.&nbsp; This happened for many years. Looking back
now I think it</b>
<br><b>was pretty freaky for sure! When my Grandma died she came to me
as I lay in</b>
<br><b>bed one night crying for her (she raised me) and she touched my
foot and said</b>
<br><b>it was going to be ok. I felt her touch. It wasn't ok right away
actually, I</b>
<br><b>went through the most horrendous time of my life that year due to
other</b>
<br><b>things as well but through it all I know she was trying to protect
me. I felt</b>
<br><b>her presence and felt her touch on my shoulder.&nbsp; I also seem
to have</b>
<br><b>developed a psychic bond with my mother's youngest sister, my Aunt
Liz. She</b>
<br><b>and I are only a few years apart and grew up more like sisters and
happily we</b>
<br><b>are now also friends. We know what eachother are thinking and one
of us will</b>
<br><b>turn to the other and answer a question that's never been asked
and we're</b>
<br><b>always thinking the same thing.&nbsp; At times it's almost spooky.&nbsp;
Anyway, thanks</b>
<br><b>for listening.</b>

<br><b>My Warning</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: JAKRGA@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Back in 1987 I was in a bad somewhat abusive marriage and considering
leaving</b>
<br><b>my then husband.&nbsp; One night while asleep I awoke to see a large
man dressed</b>
<br><b>in a long black cape with a hood.&nbsp; I could not see his face
and I distinctly</b>
<br><b>remember him holding black roses.&nbsp; He was standing in my doorway
which, by</b>
<br><b>the way, where french doors.&nbsp; Both doors where open and he
seemed to take up</b>
<br><b>the whole doorway.&nbsp; He was very large.&nbsp; Well, of course
I screamed and threw</b>
<br><b>the covers over my head until I finally got up the nerve to run
from my</b>
<br><b>bedroom to the bathroom and flicked on a light.&nbsp;&nbsp; As usual
my husband was not</b>
<br><b>home when this happen (around 2 am in the morning).&nbsp; The next
morning I</b>
<br><b>realized what I saw was the Grim Reaper (at least this is what I
believe he</b>
<br><b>was).&nbsp; Shortly after that I did indeed separate from my husband
and moved</b>
<br><b>back to my parents home.</b>
<p><b>Once back at my parents home, I proceeded with the divorce.&nbsp;
I did stupidly</b>
<br><b>consider at times to go back to my soon to be ex-husband.&nbsp;
But I believe I</b>
<br><b>was sent warnings not to go back.&nbsp; One night after going to
bed I awoke</b>
<br><b>screaming and crying and my face flooded in tears.&nbsp; My Mom
came running</b>
<br><b>frantically into my room to see what was wrong.&nbsp; The minute
she touched me I</b>
<br><b>seemed to "snap" out of it.&nbsp; Because I seemed so terrified,
she wanted to</b>
<br><b>know if I wanted her to sleep with me.&nbsp; Of course I said no
(after all I WAS</b>
<br><b>24 at the time), and I was not freaked out at all and had no idea
what</b>
<br><b>frightened me in my sleep.&nbsp; Looking back it is amazing that
I seemed so brave</b>
<br><b>because actually I'm a scardy cat by nature!&nbsp; This did happen
one more time</b>
<br><b>exactly the same way and again my Mom offered to sleep with me and
again I</b>
<br><b>said no.&nbsp; The last time this happened really did scare the
heck out of me</b>
<br><b>when I found out the next morning what happened leading up to another
one of</b>
<br><b>my "episodes".&nbsp; My brother, who was about 16 years old at the
time, was up</b>
<br><b>late one night around 1 am in the morning.&nbsp; He did this quite
often.&nbsp; At one</b>
<br><b>point he needed to go to the bathroom.&nbsp; When he opened up his
door and</b>
<br><b>proceeded to step into the hallway something caught his attention
on my door.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;He stopped to look at this image, which he said was near the
bottom of my</b>
<br><b>closed bedroom door - it was an upside down cross with something
underneath</b>
<br><b>it which he could not make out what it was.&nbsp; As he was studying
this, I</b>
<br><b>started to scream just as before.&nbsp; This TOTALLY scared him
to death and he</b>
<br><b>ran into his room.&nbsp; Again my Mom ran in to comfort me just
as before and</b>
<br><b>again whatever it was that scared me had left my senses.&nbsp; The
next morning at</b>
<br><b>the breakfast table my brother was questioning me as to what took
place the</b>
<br><b>night before.&nbsp; I absolutely had no idea.&nbsp; He then went
on to tell me what he</b>
<br><b>witnessed on my door.&nbsp; At this moment I really got scared.&nbsp;
I asked him</b>
<br><b>repeatedly if my door was really closed.&nbsp; You see I NEVER sleep
with a closed</b>
<br><b>door - NEVER!&nbsp; To this day I wonder what was in my room with
me!&nbsp; Of course I</b>
<br><b>went through with my divorce and nothing like that has ever happened
again.</b>
<br><b>Because I was having second thoughts about going through with my
divorce, I</b>
<br><b>think I was being sent a warning to get out of that marriage.&nbsp;
I interpret</b>
<br><b>the Grim Reaper with the death of the marriage and whatever it was
that</b>
<br><b>followed me home was the enforcer telling me to go through with
it.&nbsp; Has</b>
<br><b>anyone else ever had experiences like this and / or what is your
opinion?</b>
<p><b>By the way, I am happily remarried to a wonderful man and have 2
beautiful</b>
<br><b>children and a wonderful stepdaughter!&nbsp; Thanks for listening.</b>

<p><b>My Haunted Apartment</b>
<p><b>By: crumsey1@hotmail.com</b>
<p><b>Just to let you know from the start I am a firm believer in the paranormal.</b>
<br><b>Anytime anyone tells me their "stories" I listen intently with out</b>
<br><b>judgement, each individuals experiences vary from person to person
and time</b>
<br><b>to time.&nbsp; I also believe that I am very sensitive to "our friends"
on the</b>
<br><b>other side, however I don't open up enough to receive the full experience.</b>
<p><b>My husband and I (newlyweds then) moved to the Jacksonville FL area
around 3</b>
<br><b>1/2 years ago.&nbsp; We lived about 2 miles from the Mayport Naval
Station (my</b>
<br><b>husband was a USN sailor).&nbsp; We rented a small 1-bedroom apartment.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>husband was always gone on short, 3 day to a 1 week, periodic deployments.</b>
<br><b>So when I was alone in the apartment I thought it was my mind playing
tricks</b>
<br><b>on me.&nbsp; I would feel like someone was in the shower (like showering
with</b>
<br><b>me), I would not look at the bathroom mirror any longer than I had
to (it</b>
<br><b>was way creepy, like someone was looking back at me).&nbsp; This
was just the</b>
<br><b>beginning.&nbsp; At first I did not tell my husband about these
"feelings", but</b>
<br><b>when I would ask where misplaced items were or who ate missing candy,
he</b>
<br><b>would say "oh the ghost did it or ate it".&nbsp; This was our little
(or so I</b>
<br><b>thought) joke and I did not think anything of it.</b>
<p><b>My husband was getting ready for a 2 week deployment when he finally
told me</b>
<br><b>that he thought there was more than the 2 of us "living" there.&nbsp;
He went on</b>
<br><b>to tell me that things would be moved from the place he last sat
them; like</b>
<br><b>his day runner, TV remote, or keys...things that were personal items.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>said at first he thought it was me, then realized that I would either
be</b>
<br><b>asleep or not at home when these "occurrences" were happening.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>relived to hear I wasn't the only one.&nbsp; I then confessed about
my "feelings"</b>
<br><b>he said he didn't think I was crazy or a wacko!&nbsp; However that's
when things</b>
<br><b>started getting extremely spooky.</b>
<p><b>I started noticing the same things, personal items missing or</b>
<br><b>misplaced…especially my car keys.&nbsp; It got to the point that
each time I</b>
<br><b>would have an appointment or deadline my keys would come up missing.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>would find them in the oddest places...under my bed, under my couch,
in the</b>
<br><b>refrigerator, or in a drawer.&nbsp; It felt like whoever it was
did not want me</b>
<br><b>to leave.&nbsp; At first I thought it might be my great-grandfather
I always felt</b>
<br><b>like he was my guardian angel, but then it was too annoying and
constant to</b>
<br><b>be a protective measure.</b>
<p><b>We got a puppy; she would not go into the bathroom, if her toys bounced
into</b>
<br><b>the bathroom she would lay at the bathroom door and cry.&nbsp; Our
pictures on</b>
<br><b>the walls started looking like other people (with that comment I
mean they</b>
<br><b>did not look like familiar faces, they were distorted), and like
they were</b>
<br><b>watching me.&nbsp; There was also an almost perfect round spot on
the carpet in</b>
<br><b>front of the fireplace, it was there when we moved in, I thought
it might be</b>
<br><b>a burn from the fireplace.&nbsp; The spot seamed to get darker,
at first I</b>
<br><b>thought it was just wear and dirt but even after vacuuming an steam
cleaning</b>
<br><b>it would not get any lighter or go away.&nbsp; The dog did not like
that spot.</b>
<br><b>She would avoid it at all costs.</b>
<p><b>Up until this point it was just weird feeling and missing items however
it</b>
<br><b>soon started to be much moore.&nbsp; One day my husband was going
to take the dog</b>
<br><b>for a walk and I was asleep under a comforter (on the bed), he came
into the</b>
<br><b>room and gave me a kiss and told me he would be back later.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>half-asleep and barely acknowledged him.&nbsp; For what seemed a
very long time I</b>
<br><b>felt (what I thought was my husbands hands) a strong warmth on my
back, like</b>
<br><b>someone was holding their hands on my back on top of the comforter.&nbsp;
I woke</b>
<br><b>suddenly saying "your making me hot!" and noticed there was no one
in the</b>
<br><b>room or in the apartment for that matter.&nbsp; This shook me pretty
bad, but</b>
<br><b>when I was finally fed up with this was a week later.&nbsp; My husband
had left</b>
<br><b>for 2 weeks and I was working the graveyard shift, so I slept in
the middle</b>
<br><b>of the day.&nbsp; I was had just gotten into a light sleep when
I started feeling</b>
<br><b>like I was levitating about 2 feet off the bed.&nbsp; I woke with
a start, the</b>
<br><b>apartment was silent (a deafening silence) for this to be 3pm in
the summer,</b>
<br><b>it was way too quiet, I could not even hear the refrigerators hum.&nbsp;
The air</b>
<br><b>conditioner wasn't even on and remember this is Florida in summer.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>drenched in sweat.&nbsp; To this day I can't tell you for sure if
this was a</b>
<br><b>dream or real, but either way it scared the hell out of me.</b>
<p><b>My husband was gone so much that I felt alone and these strange things
were</b>
<br><b>so personal.&nbsp; I finally told a trusted friend.&nbsp; She asked
had I spoke to</b>
<br><b>this entity, I said "hell no it might talk back".&nbsp; I got to
think about what</b>
<br><b>she said, "talk to it".&nbsp; The next day I had a doctors appointment
with a</b>
<br><b>specialist (with military insurance this is a rare occurrence).&nbsp;&nbsp;
My keys</b>
<br><b>and my purse were missing, as usual, I was searching for 20 minuets,
when I</b>
<br><b>was fed up I started yelling and cursing about my keys and how important</b>
<br><b>that this appointment was and I stood in the center of the room
looked</b>
<br><b>around one last time and on the arm of the couch were my keys and
purse</b>
<br><b>(where I had left them).&nbsp; It was then that I realized the power
of speech.</b>
<p><b>The next day that I decided to come out and tell the spirit that
I did not</b>
<br><b>want it there and wanted it banished from my home.&nbsp; I was standing
in my</b>
<br><b>kitchen (the bathroom was where it was strongest but I was too freaked
out</b>
<br><b>by it), on the counter was one of the wine glasses from our wedding
day</b>
<br><b>(this was one of the only things I had from our wedding day... we
did not</b>
<br><b>have a "wedding" we were married at the court house).&nbsp; I told
the spirit "I</b>
<br><b>want you to leave this is my home now and you need to go" I felt
a lot of</b>
<br><b>pressure and stress like I was in a crowded elevator.&nbsp; Then
I got a little</b>
<br><b>more bold and angry saying curses and shouting, (I wanted "it" to
see how</b>
<br><b>angry I was).&nbsp; Well I must have made "it" angry because my
precious</b>
<br><b>wineglass slid across the counter and was slammed onto the floor.&nbsp;
I say</b>
<br><b>slammed because I had dropped many glass items and they would sometimes
not</b>
<br><b>break or if they did it was only into 2 maybe 3 pieces, however
this wine</b>
<br><b>glass was shattered beyond recognition.&nbsp; This scared me.&nbsp;
It seamed the</b>
<br><b>spirit was capable of violence.&nbsp; I left with my dog and went
to my friends</b>
<br><b>house for the next 2 nights.</b>
<p><b>My friend and I talked about the occurrences, she suggest some old
Italian</b>
<br><b>wives tale, I figured I had nothing to loose.&nbsp; So I went and
bought two</b>
<br><b>boxes of salt, a broom, white candles and a loaf of bread.&nbsp;
We went into the</b>
<br><b>apartment and said a poem that we had made up...something about
we want you</b>
<br><b>to leave and go to the otherside... I don't remember exactly its
been almost</b>
<br><b>3 years ago. We said our poem over and over while throwing salt
on every</b>
<br><b>last inch of the apartment (according to the wives tale the salt
would</b>
<br><b>banish the spirit, that the spirit could not stay where the salt
was…because</b>
<br><b>the salt was pure).&nbsp; Then we took the old broom out and brought
in the new</b>
<br><b>one along with the bread (the broom and the bread symbolizing the
new living</b>
<br><b>tenants of the dwelling) and candles.&nbsp; We lit the candles and
said our poem</b>
<br><b>and prayed to God and the Virgin to bless my home and protect me
from evil</b>
<br><b>spirits.&nbsp; Then I asked my priest to come and bless my apartment.</b>
<p><b>After this my pictures looked like the regular old pictures that
I always</b>
<br><b>new. I no longer had freaky dreams.&nbsp; We even caught the dog
occasionally</b>
<br><b>sleeping in the bathroom, I felt comfortably alone in the bathroom
and in</b>
<br><b>the shower, but the weirdest thing was that the circle spot in the
carpet</b>
<br><b>completely disappeared.</b>

<br><b>The Light in the Night</b>
<p><b>By: elworthy@telusplanet.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;It started about two years ago.&nbsp; I had just gone to bed.&nbsp;
I was just lying</b>
<br><b>there with my dog when the back porch lite went on.&nbsp; At first
I didn't</b>
<br><b>think much about it so I got up and turned the switch of.&nbsp;
When I got back</b>
<br><b>into bed my dog started to get restless and scared, He was shaking
like a</b>
<br><b>leaf when the light went on again.&nbsp; when that happened I started
to get</b>
<br><b>this feeling that I was not alone.&nbsp; I got out of bed and saw
that the</b>
<br><b>switch had been turned on, which should have been impossible because
I was</b>
<br><b>home alone.&nbsp; This happened six times that night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The next time My fiance and I had just goten home from a trip.&nbsp;
I headed</b>
<br><b>straight for bed and he stayed up to watch t.v.&nbsp; Once again
I had my dog</b>
<br><b>with me.&nbsp; Not long after I went to bed my dog started to freak
out again</b>
<br><b>only this time he bolted from the room.&nbsp; I just laughed at
him and layed</b>
<br><b>back down.&nbsp; Thats when I felt it.&nbsp; Someone was crawling
up my bed and I was</b>
<br><b>the only one in the room.&nbsp; I physicaly felt the bed go down
as if someone</b>
<br><b>was leaning into it.&nbsp; I froze.&nbsp; The room turned chilly
and I could feel</b>
<br><b>someone on top of me.&nbsp; Thinking maby it was my fiance I opened
my eyes and</b>
<br><b>saw him, him as in the ghost.&nbsp; All I could see was his head.&nbsp;
He was a</b>
<br><b>white shimmer but I could clearly see his face.&nbsp; That was when
I realized</b>
<br><b>who he was.&nbsp; My father.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My father died five years ago.&nbsp; I never met him, but
I knew what he looked</b>
<br><b>like.&nbsp; Two weeks after I saw his face I saw his whole body
once again</b>
<br><b>flooting over top of me.&nbsp; After that I have had things thrown
of my shelf,</b>
<br><b>I can hear him walking around at night.&nbsp; The other night I
saw him standing</b>
<br><b>over me touching my feet.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I don't have a long history of a hauntings, nor is my story

<p><b>My Life with Them...</b>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>My first experience was probably the worst. i believe it was b/c
i was</b>
<br><b>unaware of the fear. i believe the fear can keep them away. i use
my fear and</b>
<br><b>prayer and the wonderful invention called the lightbulb. the light
always</b>
<br><b>helped me- sometimes. the first time i was 12 years old(im now 21)
i was</b>
<br><b>alone in my deceased great g mothers house my mother had bought.
my mother</b>
<br><b>was at my nana's one house down. something made me look down the
hallway and</b>
<br><b>there stood a fairly large man. in a floating way coming towards
me. he was</b>
<br><b>transparent. he had no evil aura. he went into the kitchen and i
ran to the</b>
<br><b>door i heard dishes clack and i ran down to my nana' s house. i
had to live</b>
<br><b>in our house in fear every night. i felt something strange but never
saw</b>
<br><b>anything again. i say please do not show me a ghost lord! He knows
i cant</b>
<br><b>handle it. But still i feel them.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 3 yrs ago my nana handed me a note book

face reality</b>
<br><b>that what i had seen and felt at many different times was real.

feel ghosts around me. After</b>
<br><b>someone i know dies, i feel a strong presence that they need to
talk to me.</b>
<br><b>But i wont dare let them&nbsp; come to me. i think now (this i really
strange)</b>
<br><b>that it has "gotten around" inthe spririt world that i have a connection.
i</b>
<br><b>think that b/c i woke up one night with my covers off of me and

<br><b>MY MOTHER -IN LAWS HOUSE</b>
<p><b>By: calistasewell@trilogytours.com</b>
<p><b>I guess I don't know where to start so I'll just let it all go.</b>
<br><b>My mother in law used to live in a very old house-1800's or so in</b>
<br><b>St.Paul,MN,we all knew her house was haunted,but those stories are</b>
<br><b>unrelated to what I'm about to tell you except for the fact that
her</b>
<br><b>ghost(s)followed her.She moved to a fairly new house1980's or so
in</b>
<br><b>Woodbury,MN.It all started about 2yrs ago with my mother in law.She
was</b>
<br><b>laying in bed late at night having trouble sleeping,she said she
was</b>
<br><b>dozing off,you know the sleep where anything can wake you up,when
she</b>
<br><b>felt someone get into bed with her,she said she felt the impressions
on</b>
<br><b>her bed like hand,knee,hand,knee then she said someone pulled the
covers</b>
<br><b>back and get comfortable in her bed like she wasn't even there,well</b>
<br><b>needless to say she was terrified,to scared to move so she laid
in bed</b>
<br><b>for over an hour she said.When she finally got the courage to look
over</b>
<br><b>her shoulder she said noone was there and her bed was still perfectly</b>
<br><b>made.She swears no matter how many people pass it off as being tired,she</b>
<br><b>was wide awake.</b>
<br><b>The next incident happened with my mother in laws sister,she was</b>
<br><b>spending the night at my mother in laws and they had stayed up until</b>
<br><b>after midnight talking and what not finally my mother in law had
to go</b>
<br><b>to bed,well her sister had rented movies and put one on.She watched
the</b>
<br><b>whole movie and when it was over it was probably 2:30 in the morning
or</b>
<br><b>so she got up and used the bathroom,got something to drink and got
on</b>
<br><b>the couch to go to sleep.She said as soon as her head hit the pillow</b>
<br><b>someone standing in the hallway said clear as day"HI",she said she
sat</b>
<br><b>up saying what are you doing up,when she looked behind her noone
was</b>
<br><b>there,she got up and ran to her sisters room and she was in her
bed</b>
<br><b>sound asleep.She ended up turning on all teh lights and staying
up more</b>
<br><b>than half the night.</b>
<br><b>Now here's what happened to me.My mother in law was on vacation
and we</b>
<br><b>were staying at her house,my daughter and I were sleeping in her
bed and</b>
<br><b>my fiancee was sleeping in the spare bedroom.It was 2:30 in the
morning</b>
<br><b>when I woke up out of a dead sleep,I looked around the room and
toward</b>
<br><b>the end of the bed I saw a black haze,I could see through it to
the wall</b>
<br><b>so I passed it off as having just woke up when something reached
out and</b>
<br><b>knocked the blanket off me,I physically saw the blanket move.I'm
a grown</b>
<br><b>woman and let me just tell you I was so scared that I pulled the
covers</b>
<br><b>over my head,and after about a minute or so I looked out and nothing
was</b>
<br><b>there,so I ran to teh spare bedroom where my man was.I woke him
up and</b>
<br><b>told him what happened,all he said was so it visited you to.!!!</b>
<br><b>I can't stand going over there,not even in broad daylight.I always
feel</b>
<br><b>scared.Here's somethings that also happened that they wouldn't tell
me</b>
<br><b>about,my daughter has an imaginary grandma,she calls it her Nana
grandma</b>
<br><b>I thought it was just something that 4 year olds did,but my sister
in</b>
<br><b>law told me it all started back about 1-1/2 yrs ago when my daughter</b>
<br><b>opened the closet door in the front hall,sat down on the floor and</b>
<br><b>started talking to someone,well after a long time my mother in law
said</b>
<br><b>"alexus who are you talking to?"And my baby replied "my old nana
grandma</b>
<br><b>lives in the closet".</b>
<br><b>Also before I knew anything about the ghost I would be sitting upstairs</b>
<br><b>in the living room and I would haer a sound like someone was walking
up</b>
<br><b>the stairs,I just passed it off as house noises until one day I
was</b>
<br><b>sitting with my mother in law and for some reason I told her about</b>
<br><b>it.She then told me she heard it all the time like someone would
walk up</b>
<br><b>the first 5-6 stairs and then it would stop,she said she and my
daughter</b>
<br><b>wrwe sitting in the living room one day and she heard it,she tried
to</b>
<br><b>ignore it and my baby who was 3 at the time ran to the top of the
stairs</b>
<br><b>yelling out "who's here?" anyways those are my stories if any one
has</b>

<br><b>Young but still Haunted</b>
<p><b>By: MrStrange121@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have quite a few weird experiences already in
my life despite he fact</b>
<br><b>the fact I am only 13, but by far the scariest for me is ghosts.&nbsp;
I have had</b>
<br><b>3 encounters, in 3 years.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first encounter was when I was 9, I was sitting
in my room doing some</b>
<br><b>homework.&nbsp; First thing that happened was that the door locked,
I know it</b>
<br><b>wasn't me because I never lock a door (except for the obvious times).&nbsp;
Next</b>
<br><b>thing that happened was that something started making these weird
beeping and</b>
<br><b>clicking noises all over my room, and as abruptly as it started,
it stopped.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second encounter may not have been a ghost,
but it was something.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>occured when I was 11, I was looking outside at the stars from my
room.&nbsp; When</b>
<br><b>suddenly I saw a figure glowing in a bright pinkish or orangish
color.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>walked like a human.&nbsp; I think it may the ghost of a native
american because</b>
<br><b>behind my house there are quite a few piles of rocks that look like
graves</b>
<br><b>and I have some strange formations in rocks and branches.&nbsp;
After observing</b>
<br><b>for about 30-45 seconds it walked out of view.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My most recent encounter happened just recently.&nbsp;
I was watching TV being</b>
<br><b>alone in my house, when I suddenly heard this person (presumably
a man)</b>
<br><b>calling out in thrill or needing help.&nbsp; It seemed to be calling
for a</b>
<br><b>"Martha".&nbsp; I am sure I was not imagining this because my dogs
also heard.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was not a TV or radio because none were on except the one infront
of me and</b>
<br><b>it was muted.</b>

<br><b>Mean Unwanted Man</b>
<p><b>By: yancandjen@webtv.net</b>
<p><b>I began to feel a man's presence in my home shortly after a friend
of</b>
<br><b>mine moved in. She saw him on several occasions in her bedroom during</b>
<br><b>the middle of the night. I could feel him more and more strongly
as time</b>
<br><b>went on. Then I began to feel threatened by him. I called my mother
(</b>
<br><b>who has taken classes on pyschic abilities ) to help me get rid
of this</b>
<br><b>unwanted spirit in my home. While on the phone with her, I could
feel</b>
<br><b>the spirit trying to wrap around me as if he wanted to suffocate
me. I</b>
<br><b>told my mom what was happening. She instructed me to put on my cross</b>
<br><b>necklace. But when I tryed to do so, the rope chain necklace fell
apart.</b>
<br><b>(It was almost brand new) As I tryed to put my cross on another
chain, I</b>
<br><b>could feel the spirit trying to push into my body. After I finally
got</b>
<br><b>my cross necklace on, I felt a little less threatened. My mom came
over</b>
<br><b>a few hours later to exorcise the spirit out of my house. We used
a book</b>
<br><b>by Sylvia Browne to do the exorcism. Needless to say, it worked,
but</b>
<br><b>took a couple of weeks. That all happened a couple of months ago.
Now, I</b>
<br><b>can still feel him from time to time, but there is no threat. Thank

to an old house down in the farm below her house to get bricks from the

and my mother started getting bricks&nbsp; off her chosen wall.We both
started feeling very uneasy.Then my mother reported hearing a baby crying
.I cant remember hearing this sound . My mother ecame vry concious of my
safety and made me go to my grannys .I know something else happened but
mum denys it .One day I asked my granddad about the history of the house.He
told me that a group of maori shearers and their familys used to live in
that home.Their baby was abused and one day it went too far , if you know
what I mean.</b>
<br><b>All I remember from the incident is a VERY uneasy feeling and feeling

with</b>
<br><b>the spirit&nbsp; of a child for almost 6 years. Now it seems that
a little</b>
<br><b>girl is here also.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; In March of 1995, my husband, my daughter JENNY and
myself; moved</b>
<br><b>into a&nbsp; house in a little town called Sandy Springs,&nbsp;
SC. Where we could</b>
<br><b>all 3 be closer to our jobs. Any way the house we moved into is
a former</b>
<br><b>Daycare Center."(KIDDIE KOLLEGE)"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Upon moving in ; Jenny noticed that any thing&nbsp; she hung
on her walls</b>
<br><b>in the bedroom would automatically wind up in the floor. At the
same</b>
<br><b>time in the living room&nbsp; I'm trying to set up our bookshelves.
But it seemed</b>
<br><b>everytime&nbsp; that I got one shelf finished, and started on another
one</b>
<br><b>the first row would land at my feet. It made me mad!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; My husband ; BOO , his nickname, could take a nap and he

house</b>
<br><b>once and this person popped in my head and i described this person
to her and</b>
<br><b>asked her if she knew who it was and she was like "yeah thats my
aunt she</b>
<br><b>died a couple or years ago."&nbsp; I did this through almost the
whole night. Ive</b>
<br><b>been able to tell people what they are thinking and when im in an
area that</b>
<br><b>is haunted i get either an uneasy feeling or pains. When one of
my friends</b>
<br><b>say they experience sightings and so forth i will investigate and
i will tell</b>
<br><b>them my thoughts. I will give them a gender and a name and my feelings
for my</b>
<br><b>thoughts are so deep as if i know the spirit. There is this one
spirit that</b>
<br><b>seems to follow me and i dont know it its my guardian angel or what
but i</b>
<br><b>have the feeling its a male and his name is David. I've always felt
different</b>
<br><b>from everyone else because of my experiences and when im having
these</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;I am not very good at typing. so bear along with me. The story</b>
<br><b>I'am going to tell you happened 24-yrs ago. And I have only told
a few people</b>
<br><b>about it. I don't even know if it really happened. My brother in
law which at</b>
<br><b>the time of his death was only 22 yrs old. He got run over by a
car while</b>
<br><b>walking along the road. But the story begins after the fact. We
all went to</b>
<br><b>the viewing a few days later. My wife, step son, and myself. It
was a long</b>
<br><b>drawn out affair, which lasted hours. And my step son being only
10 at the</b>
<br><b>time was greatly affected by this. Upone&nbsp; returning home I
told my wife it</b>
<br><b>would be a good idea for the small child to sleep with us. I really
don't</b>
<br><b>know what amount of time went by. But Ii was waken out of a sound
sleep by the</b>
<br><b>young child yelling Joie, Joie. When I looked over I saw Joe in
corner of the</b>
<br><b>room. Only from the neck up. When I said to Brian[step son]. what
is going</b>
<br><b>on? He said he saw Joie coming towards him. When I yelled out Joie
moved</b>
<br><b>into the conner of the room. Only from the neck up and float upwards.
Which</b>
<br><b>is just what I seen. Joie from the neck up. and float out of sight.
The next</b>
<br><b>day I asked the child what he saw, and he said the same thing again.
I was</b>
<br><b>worried this would be upsetting to him. and I told him there is
no such</b>
<br><b>things as ghosts. could you shed some light on this for me. what
did we</b>
<br><b>really see. To this day Brian does not remember it. He seems to
have blocked</b>
<br><b>it out of his mind.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><b>fact, I have never encountered anything strange or ghostly, but
my mom on</b>
<br><b>the other hand has.</b>
<br><b>About a year ago, my mom's best friend, Judy Demers, died of cancer.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>mom, with help from some close friends and family members, organized
the</b>
<br><b>funeral of this very special woman.&nbsp; She was everyones friend,
outgoing,</b>
<br><b>smart, pretty, and just full of life.&nbsp; Even while she battled
cancer, not</b>
<br><b>once did she stop being outgoing.&nbsp; She continued to make people
smile and be</b>
<br><b>happy.</b>
<br><b>During the times when Mrs. Demers was confined to her bed, she wrote
her</b>
<br><b>eulogy which she wanted my mother to read if she didn't win her
fight with</b>
<br><b>the fiend that threatened her body.</b>
<br><b>There were two parts to her eulogy, one which she wanted read at
her</b>
<br><b>funeral, and one that was meant only for her family.&nbsp; This
my mother did not</b>
<br><b>know, until Mrs. Demers told her in a very strange way.</b>
<br><b>It was very late one night, around 3 am.&nbsp; My mom was going
over Mrs. Demers'</b>
<br><b>eulogy, editing it and trying to decide what to do.&nbsp; My mom
could tell that</b>
<br><b>one part of the eulogy seemed...a little personal for everyone to
hear at</b>
<br><b>the funeral, yet my mom was still uncertain.&nbsp; She had asked
the family</b>
<br><b>members if they knew anything about what parts were to be read and
which</b>
<br><b>were not to be read; they were no help.&nbsp; It was up to my mom
to figure it</b>
<br><b>out.&nbsp; The stress of losing such a close and cherished friend
was too much,</b>
<br><b>and with the added task of trying to figure out what her best friend
wanted</b>
<br><b>but could no longer tell her, was just unbearable. My mom just broke
down in</b>
<br><b>tears, sobbing over a beautiful friendship that could no longer
bring her</b>
<br><b>warmth.&nbsp; She didn't know what to do.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly the lamp, which was my mother's only source of light while
she had</b>
<br><b>been editing the eulogy, began to flicker intensely.&nbsp; At first
my mother had</b>
<br><b>just thought that the bulb was going out or that there was something
wrong</b>
<br><b>with the elctricity, but the lamp never went out, it just kept on</b>
<br><b>flickering.</b>
<br><b>My mother felt a little foolish for what she was about to do, uncertain
of</b>
<br><b>what was truly happening, but she went with what her heart so wanted
to be</b>
<br><b>true.&nbsp; She called out her friend's name, "Judy, is that you?"&nbsp;
The light</b>
<br><b>stopped flickering at that moment.&nbsp; My mom could not believe
what had just</b>
<br><b>happened. Her friend had come back.&nbsp; She stopped sobbing and
smiled.&nbsp; My mom</b>
<br><b>began to talk to Mrs. Demers.&nbsp; She closed her eyes and just
began to say</b>
<br><b>what was in her heart, knowing that her friend was listening.&nbsp;
After</b>
<br><b>speaking from her heart, she opened her eyes and looked down at
the eulogy,</b>
<br><b>remembering the dilemma she was in.&nbsp; "Judy, I don't know what
to do.&nbsp; There</b>
<br><b>are two parts to this eulogy, but i don't know if one is for everyone
or if</b>
<br><b>they both are, I....I just don't know."&nbsp; The light began to
flicker again</b>
<br><b>and my mom picked up the part of the eulogy she thought to be personal
and</b>
<br><b>asked, "Do you want this part to be given only to your family?"&nbsp;
The light</b>
<br><b>began to flicker faster as if nodding yes.&nbsp; My mom was finally
relieved of</b>
<br><b>not only the burden in her heart but the dilemma at hand as well.&nbsp;
She knew</b>
<br><b>which one she would give to the grieving family and which one she
would read</b>
<br><b>with all the love she felt for Judy.&nbsp; Once again she closed
her eyes and</b>
<br><b>told her friend how much she loved her, as she said those words
the lamp</b>
<br><b>slowly stopped flickering and the lamp was as it had been.</b>
<br><b>This experience has given my mom a new hope.&nbsp; She is a practicing
Catholic</b>
<br><b>and always knew she would be with her loved ones in heaven when
she left the</b>
<br><b>mortal plane, but now, she knows a very special person is waiting
for her at</b>
<br><b>heaven's gates and will be watching her and smiling down until they
are at</b>
<br><b>last reunited.</b>
<br><b>But the friendship still lives on, for my mom is visited every so
often in</b>
<br><b>her sleep by Mrs. Demers.&nbsp; My mom is told not to be sad, but
to be happy for</b>
<br><b>her, happy in the knowledge that she has been reborn into a complete</b>
<br><b>paradise where she no longer suffers from mortal illnesses.&nbsp;
It's odd, but</b>
<br><b>each time she is visted by Judy, it is in the same house.&nbsp;
Yet my mom has</b>
<br><b>never seen the house, but it always looks the same.</b>
<br><b>Friendship is such a beautiful thing.&nbsp; It never dies, even
in death.</b>

<br><b>A Gettysburg Encounter</b>
<br><b>By: Nickybear3665@cs.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I thought you may be interested in what happened to husband last
autumn in</b>
<br><b>Gettysburg P.A.&nbsp; I grew up in the U.K. and have always seen
things, my</b>
<br><b>husband being a sceptical american has been unmerciful in making
fun of me.</b>
<br><b>We decided to spend a week in Gettysburg exploring the battlefield
and unique</b>
<br><b>history.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was very uncomfortable,&nbsp; as anyone who
has ever been there</b>
<br><b>knows, being so completely surrounded by spirits can become rather
oppressive</b>
<br><b>over time.</b>
<br><b>On what turned out to be our final day there my husband awoke around
6am and</b>
<br><b>went to get a drink of water.&nbsp; The next thing I remember is
being woken by</b>
<br><b>him yelling that I should be more careful.&nbsp; Apparently while
he was at the</b>
<br><b>sink someone ran into him at full tilt almost knocking him over,
which is no</b>
<br><b>mean feat considering that he is over 6 feet tall and heavily built.</b>
<br><b>My husband finding me still in bed immediately began throwing everything
back</b>
<br><b>into our suitcase and we checked out early.</b>
<br><b>He no longer makes fun of me and needless to say everytime we return
to</b>
<br><b>Gettysburg we stay outside of town.</b>

<br><b>Who Opened my Door</b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; cherryicekreme@yahoo.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I have been living in this house with my family for about 3 years
and have had kind of strange expiriences in it that have lead me to believe
that it is haunted. Especially my own room. my bed used to be on the wall
that my door was on, facing forwards so I so see whenever someone came
in. I would have the strangest sensations, and sometimes I thought I could
hear my door open and close in the middle of the night. This did not scare
me too much, because often my father would have to leave for the airport
in the early morning and he would come kiss me on the cheek before he left.
One morning I saw the door open, and close. I sat up telling my father
that I was awake- but was really surprised to hear the car's engine and
it take off out of our driveway! No one was in the hallway when I checked.
These kind of things would just kind of scare me- so I moved my bed, so
that I could see my whole room when I was in bed. Nothing really happened
for a while until the beginning of my freshman year in highschool. I was
vere saying! that night I cranked up&nbsp; the radio and turned on the
light!! This story</b>
<br><b>seems mellow, but it sure scared me when it happened!! thank you!</b>

<p><b>Apartment Ghost</b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; Cmhonigford@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I'd never actually seen a ghost before but I'd felt presences (especially
in</b>
<br><b>my aunt and uncle's old house) - that is until I moved into my current</b>
<br><b>apartment.</b>
<br><b>I live in an old apartment building. The landlord told me it was
built around</b>
<br><b>1920, but the houses near here were built more along the lines of
the 1880s.</b>
<br><b>>From what I hear they were mostly low rent housing for the servants
who</b>
<br><b>worked at the mansions just up the road. Needless to say, many many
people</b>
<br><b>have lived in these rooms since then.</b>
<br><b>A couple of months after moving into my apartment I started having
nightmares</b>
<br><b>that someone was in my apartment - in my bedroom. They progressed
to the</b>
<br><b>point that I would wake up terrified and felt like someone was trying
to</b>
<br><b>choke me and I was being held down on the bed. This happened several
times.</b>
<br><b>One night I woke up feeling like someone was choking me again, but
this time</b>
<br><b>I couldn't move. I know I was awake, but my body was paralyzed.
I glanced at</b>
<br><b>my bedroom door, which was open, and saw a man standing there. He
was a young</b>
<br><b>man and didn't look particularly menacing. He had blond hair and
was wearing</b>
<br><b>a sweater vest. He looked 20th century, maybe 1930s or 40s. I wasn't
afraid</b>
<br><b>of him. He started walking towards me and then disappeared. I haven't
had</b>
<br><b>that nightmare since and I haven't seen "him" since. I have the
feeling that</b>
<br><b>the young man I saw wasn't the one trying to hurt me and that maybe
he was</b>
<br><b>trying to keep that "bad" spirit away from me. It worked because
I haven't</b>
<br><b>had that dream since.</b>
<br><b>After that experience I got a cat. Not long after I got her I woke
up in the</b>
<br><b>middle of the night to find her sitting beside my head, not facing
the window</b>
<br><b>behind my bed like I expected, but the bedroom door on the opposite
side of</b>
<br><b>the room. Her head was moving back and forth very steadily as if
she were</b>
<br><b>watching something. She didn't seem upset, just curious. It seemed
like</b>
<br><b>something was intentionally trying to keep her attention. I looked
(very</b>
<br><b>reluctantly) and saw nothing. She proceeded to watch whatever it
was until I</b>
<br><b>kicked her out of my room and shut the door. That upset me more
than seeing</b>
<br><b>the young man in my doorway. It was like a confirmation that something
was</b>
<br><b>actually there and it was active even though I couldn't see it.</b>
<br><b>It doesn't really frighten me anymore. I seems like it's looking
out for me,</b>
<br><b>watching over me... and entertaining my cat. And having the cat
has made me</b>
<br><b>feel more at ease. I figure if something bad was here with us, she
wouldn't</b>
<br><b>be as lazy and relaxed as she is.</b>
<br><b>That's it. Nothing has happened for quite awhile, and I ignore the
cat when</b>
<br><b>she comes into my room at night - I need my sleep!</b>

<br><b>Busy Place</b>
<br><b>By: sshack@infocom.com</b>
<p><b>I recently submitted an account to the Shadowlands which I titled
"Farmhand".&nbsp; It was a brief narrative of the haunting which is going
on in my central Indiana farmhouse.&nbsp; I will not recap that narrative
but would like to share an account of increased activity in the house.</b>
<br><b>Over Memorial day weekend of this year my wife's sister and her
3 year old son were visiting us from Michigan.&nbsp; My sister in law has
a much higher sensitivity level to spirits than most people and she does
not particularly welcome the ability. She once made the mistake of openly
welcoming any spirits who wanted to visit her into her home and had a very
hard time&nbsp; ridding herself of one particular entity.&nbsp; Since that
episode she is reluctant to even discuss spirits. On the first night of
her visit she and her son were sleeping in the living room of our farm
house.&nbsp; She woke up at approximately 0300 feeling as if she were being
watched.&nbsp; She looked into the hall way leading to the kitchen and
saw a man standing in the hall watching her and her son.&nbsp; She indicated
that she felt no fear but was uncomfortable with his presence.&nbsp; She
eventually closed her eyes and refused to look any longer and eventually
fell back to sleep.&nbsp; This is the same hall way that makes people scoot
through a little fast...not scary...you just feel an urge to hurry down
it.&nbsp; The next day she was filling us in on the encounter of the previous
night and I was noting the similarities to the&nbsp; apparition that I
had seen in the house a couple of years earlier.&nbsp; One difference is
that my encounter had been with a younger version of the apparition....and
she had seen a full body...my lone experience had been of the apparition
from the waist up only.&nbsp; The physical description was very similar..my
version had red hair...hers had white hair.&nbsp; One thing that was identical
was the bright blue eyes we both described seeing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;While discussing this encounter I took note that the only
activity seemed to take place in the original part of the house built in
the 1840's.&nbsp; I jokingly mentioned that perhaps the spirit does not
venture into the additions to the house.&nbsp; Big mistake!&nbsp; The second
night of her visit around 0100 I awoke to the sensation one can experience
when a cat walks on you while you are&nbsp; laying in bed...I felt the
sensation go down the right side of my leg then a heavy force was felt
on my feet.&nbsp; Not unusual&nbsp; except that there are no cats in the
house&nbsp; This bothered me very much.&nbsp; I was extremely uncomfortable
with physical contact with this entity.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I left the bedroom and went out to the porch to spend the
rest of the night.&nbsp; I had no sooner settled into a chair when I heard
the sound of someone coming out to the porch.&nbsp; I was greatly relieved
that it was my sister in law.&nbsp; She asked if anything was wrong and
I told her only that I'd had a bad experience.&nbsp; She asked if I had
felt anything touch my feet!&nbsp; When I responded affirmative she said
that something had come into the living room and stood beside her for awhile
then began touching her leg then proceeded to sit on her feet.&nbsp; She
was worried about her young son so we returned to the living room where
I sat in a recliner to try to get some sleep.</b>
<br><b>While sitting in the chair I was struck sharply in the foot once...then
something began to scurry around the ceiling of the living room...a noticeable
sound of movement...very rapid in pace.&nbsp;&nbsp; My sister in law felt
as if this was a second presence...she did not receive the same feeling
from the night before.&nbsp; She indicated that it did not give any feelings
of malevolence...only wanting to be noticed.&nbsp; In the past week the
touching&nbsp; has reduced in frequency...but have changed.&nbsp; I will
occasionally feel a small charge of static electricity on my arm or hand
and have been visited once more at night with the "cat" sensation.&nbsp;
I can only hope that my sister in law is correct&nbsp; in her assessment
that this is simply the spirits way of saying "Hello...I'm here"&nbsp;
Still I am very uncomfortable with this and do not welcome it at all.</b>

<br><b>Death of a Friend</b>
<p><b>By: JimNwi@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>This is a true story that happened to me in Feb of 93.&nbsp; A very
good friend of</b>
<br><b>mine was going to a birthday party in a small town about 40 miles
south of</b>
<br><b>Milwaukee.&nbsp; We both got off of work at about 9:00pm, it was
a saturday night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Although we both left within a few minutes of each other we
ran into each</b>
<br><b>other at a gas station right before the freeway.&nbsp; I was on
my way to visit</b>
<br><b>friends in Northern Illinois.&nbsp; I told him to becareful and
he said you</b>
<br><b>becareful, I said am not the one who falls asleep while driving.&nbsp;
We both</b>
<br><b>laughed and drove off.&nbsp; About 3:45 in the morning (a time I
will never</b>
<br><b>forget) I was awaken by my friend who asked me why I had spit on
them. And I</b>
<br><b>said I didn't spit on you, but all down the left side of my body
felt very</b>
<br><b>warm and wet. Well we turned on the light and it turned out that
his cat who</b>
<br><b>was very small and tame and never came in to the bedroom had puked
up what</b>
<br><b>seemed like a gallon of red puke. I would like to add that there
was no food</b>
<br><b>or water out for the cat, I looked. And all of it was on me.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was not very</b>
<br><b>happy about this. I had to take a shower (thats how much there was)
and</b>
<br><b>change the sheets. One thing I didn't mention was that my friend
who I worked</b>
<br><b>with loved all animals especially cats, he had 2 himself.&nbsp;
Well about 5am the</b>
<br><b>phone started ringing. since we were tired we didn't answer it.
finally about</b>
<br><b>8am we answered, it was my roomate from Milwaukee saying to come
home and was</b>
<br><b>very upset.&nbsp; I know it wasn't good. But believe it or not I
was still reeling</b>
<br><b>from the cat puke. I drove what seemed like forever, but made it
home in 45</b>
<br><b>minutes which is a feat in itself.&nbsp; When I got in, I found
out that Shawn had</b>
<br><b>fallen asleep while driving over one of our elevated freeways downtown
and</b>
<br><b>had flipped over a bridge and landed on the street below upside
down. The</b>
<br><b>time of the accident was 3:45am.</b>

<br><b>Dudleyville, Green Lady and Jim Morrison</b>
<p><b>By: Leia833@aol.com</b>
<p><b>My experiences are not very exciting, but i think maybe some people
might</b>
<br><b>care to read them.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dudleyville is located in Cornwall, ct.&nbsp;
I had first learned about</b>
<br><b>Dudleyville through an aquaintance. He told me that he heard of
this guy who</b>
<br><b>had been driving back from a gig really late at night. he was on
the</b>
<br><b>highway(in a part of dudleyville)and was so tired he had to pull
over and</b>
<br><b>sleep. This person had such horrible nightmares that night, so bad
that he</b>
<br><b>had to see a psychologist for months afterward.&nbsp; I was also
told by the same</b>
<br><b>person that dudleyville was a town where they kept all the mentally
ill</b>
<br><b>people, and that if you touch the foundations of the houses their
spirits can</b>
<br><b>possess you and you go crazy.&nbsp; Other people have said it was
just a town that</b>
<br><b>died out of smallpox, and others said it was because of some curse.&nbsp;
This is</b>
<br><b>my experience: Almost exactly a year ago, 1999, i went to Dudleyville
with 2</b>
<br><b>other friends, Dave and Greg.&nbsp; I had snuck out of my house
to go and..it must</b>
<br><b>have been around 2:30 or 3am when we finally got there. The last
part of the</b>
<br><b>drive included 15 mintues through unlit woods.&nbsp; Pretty but
also creepy.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>had parked there illegally because the sign explicitly said "daylight
hiking</b>
<br><b>only" and i think thats a little weird in itself. Dave, my best
friend at the</b>
<br><b>time could sense presences and such, so he told us where to take
pictures.</b>
<br><b>We had brought 2 cameras, a polaroid and a regualar camera. The
other guy we</b>
<br><b>were with, Greg, had been there before. He said they had parked
at the other</b>
<br><b>end of it and had to walk for a real long time before they ran&nbsp;
into any</b>
<br><b>foundations.&nbsp; He also said that the trails are easy to get
lost in and that</b>
<br><b>they had marked their trail to get out, with a soda bottle or something
i</b>
<br><b>guess. When they were leaving they recognized their trail, but noticed
that</b>
<br><b>their soda bottle had been moved. So we were walking in and we noticed
the</b>
<br><b>legendary eerie quiet that everyone notices.&nbsp; I mean there
is NOTHING, no</b>
<br><b>birdies, no bats, no crickets, no peepers, no noises that should
be heard in</b>
<br><b>the deep woods on a hot summer night.&nbsp; Before we were really
deep into the</b>
<br><b>woods, we were breaking out the cameras, and Greg thought some trees
were</b>
<br><b>cool and had a us take pics of them, we took one w/ the polaroid
and one with</b>
<br><b>my camera.&nbsp; Before long Dave was telling us to take pics here
and there..only</b>
<br><b>a couple though i took not more than 4 the whole time i was there.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>clinging to Daves arm the entire time, being the wuss i am, so we
left after</b>
<br><b>a while as we were also running out of battery power. When we got
back to the</b>
<br><b>car and it started, i was quite relieved because some people return
to their</b>
<br><b>cars being messed with while they were gone. About the pictures,
the</b>
<br><b>polaroids take a few minutes to develop but i refused to look at
them untill</b>
<br><b>we were in the car on the way home, but i remember dave looking
at them while</b>
<br><b>we were there saying something along the lines of: "they died out
of smallpox</b>
<br><b>all right, just look at them" well all the polariods didnt come
out so i dont</b>
<br><b>know why he said "look" at them, maybe he could feel it somehow.
(There is</b>
<br><b>some question as to how the town died out.) But the thing about
the polaroids</b>
<br><b>was, the picture of Greg's pretty trees came out fine, but the pics
w/ the</b>
<br><b>"auras" that dave sensed came out ok around the edges w/ blackness
like it</b>
<br><b>never developed in the centers, not like black "things" mind you,
just like</b>
<br><b>the picture did not develop properly. My pictues were different.
again Greg's</b>
<br><b>tree pics were fine, one other picture was normal but the last one
one had</b>
<br><b>the white misty ectoplasm in it.&nbsp; Swirly w/ one blob that was
compared to a</b>
<br><b>toddler's head by Dave's mother, and an upside down&nbsp; lowercase
letter e.</b>
<br><b>This might not matter but smallpox would have taken out the children
first,</b>
<br><b>so it might be a spirit of a baby, as the mist really does resemble
his head.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Weird now that i think of it i allways refer to it as a boy.&nbsp;
Now i whish i</b>
<br><b>had taken more pictures. Anyway that was the Dudleyville experience.&nbsp;
I must</b>
<br><b>also add that the pictures i took were in the middle of the roll
of 200 speed</b>
<br><b>film. And one last thing.&nbsp; While we were driving home, we drove
out of the</b>
<br><b>woods and onto the main roads there were a couple feilds and there
was a</b>
<br><b>mountain(more like a hill) nearby. and Dave said he felt like there
was</b>
<br><b>something there, in the feilds and on top of the mountain. He said
that back</b>
<br><b>in the day they used to bury the dead on tops of mountains because
its closer</b>
<br><b>to God or something like that.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Green Lady cemetary was pathetic. I was there
a couple times a year and a</b>
<br><b>half ago. There are 1.5 graves there, the rest have been destroyed.&nbsp;
There is</b>
<br><b>an old tree where the green lady was supposedly hung from and you
are</b>
<br><b>supposed to see the rope marks from the branch, i never saw any.
Dave never</b>
<br><b>said anything to it being haunted, and i conclude that the mist
comes from</b>
<br><b>the nearby swamp.&nbsp; As to the mist being green, the cyannobacteria
that hangs</b>
<br><b>out in swamps can be green or blue so that could account for the
green mist.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to Europe on a school trip in February
2000.&nbsp; We visited the</b>
<br><b>cemetary in Paris that Jim Morrisons grave is located in, i cant
spell it</b>
<br><b>because its french but its Pere Lachaise or something. Anyways i
had a few</b>
<br><b>pictures taken of myself next to his grave, and 2 were of me placing
flowers</b>
<br><b>by it. both of then have that wonderfull ectoplasmn in them.&nbsp;
Also i might</b>
<br><b>add we went into catacombs in Paris, they are these underground
tunnels</b>
<br><b>filled with bones from when Paris was being rennovated back in the
day. I</b>
<br><b>guess they dug up all the cemetarys to make room. There were wall
to wall</b>
<br><b>bones. I could have taken a skull and put it in my purse had i wanted
too,</b>
<br><b>but being the nice person i am i didn't.&nbsp; I took a lot of pics
there but none</b>
<br><b>came up with anything unusual, although the bones are freaky enough</b>
<br><b>themselves.&nbsp; I must also add that the other students i was
with took pictures</b>
<br><b>all over the cemetary and in the catacombs and no one got anything
unusual.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sorry about the length of this but i have
been meaning to share it</b>
<br><b>with the rest of the world for a while now.&nbsp; I am trying to
get my pictures</b>
<br><b>scanned, so if anyone really needs to see them or share their Dudleyville</b>
<br><b>experiences with me i can be reached at Leia833@aol.com.</b>

<br><b>Edward the ghost and me</b>

<p><b>whats up, I'm an average teenager I recently moved out a house that

a man named</b>

because he</b>

was his sisters,</b>

moan,</b>
<br><b>and run,pound if you will on the stairs he hung himself above.What
really creeped me out</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;was when he would mess with my mom in her room, which was
RIGHT by the stairs.</b>
<br><b>over time he wouldn't mess with us(me and my family)anymore.then

<p><b>Emergency Room Ghosts</b>
<p><b>By: vweir@advertisnet.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I work in a hospital in Emergency Room admissions. We have a huge
waiting area with a "Meditation Room" off of the main waiting area. It
is a small, windowless room, maybe 8X8, with four chairs, a table and a
phone, the door has a long, narrow window just big enough for you to peek
in and see if the room is occupied. This is the room that physicians use
to break the&nbsp; news to families that their loved ones have passed on...When
I started working there I was informed by my co-workers that this room
was "haunted" and that I would see lights flickering on and off at all
times, day and night and that sometimes you&nbsp; would feel the hair on
the back of your neck rise and know that someone was watching you. I won't
say I was a non-believer,&nbsp; I try to be open minded but I wasn't going
to put much stock in these warnings without experiencing these happenings
first hand. Well, it didn't take long for the me to see the lights flashing
on and off, the maintenance department had electricians&nbsp; in all the
time but nothing was ever found wrong, and I can't count the times that
I would look up to see if someone was watching me! The clincher happened
at about 2 a.m. in the morning though, I was at my desk and felt someone
watching me, I</b>
<br><b>looked up and saw a small child about 8 or 9 watching me from the
window, she had her nose and mouth pressed up against it,&nbsp; I got up
from my desk , thinking she had wandered from the floor and gotten lost,
by the time I turned the corner to go around the desk, I looked back and
she was gone...the hall way to the patients rooms is very long and if she
would have left I would have seen her walking down the hallway, she had
simply disappeared. I saw her so clearly I could not believe&nbsp; she
had been and apparition but she very simply had "disappeared". The next
morning, I related my experience to the morning&nbsp; admissions clerk
, she went over to the room and called me to join her, she had opened the
door to the meditation room and&nbsp; on the bottom of the window was a
foggy impression of a small nose and mouth....about a week earlier we had
a 9 year old girl brought in that had been electrocuted....she didn't make
it....she was not from our town, she was just visiting and it&nbsp; was
going to take her mom several hours to arrive, by the time she got there,
the coroner was taking the child away. I have since wondered if that was
the spirit of the little girl "waiting and watching" for her mom.</b>
