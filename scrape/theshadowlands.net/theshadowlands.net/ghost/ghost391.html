<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have always believed in ghosts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was back in 2003 that I had an experience
with one.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was working in a warehouse in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Grand Prairie</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">Texas</st1:state></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was basic<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y
the facilities maintenance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of my
jobs was to clean<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the executive offices
in the mornigs.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One day during my first week of work, I was tying of a trash
bag, when, <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> of a sudden, out the
side of my left eye, I saw what looked like a shadow move very fast by me and
go behind a cubicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew what I had
just seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I did not get scared and I just went on about my business.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I kept quiet about what had happened until my manager and
other people started talking about what they had seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's when I came out and told what I had
seen.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My manager told me it was the ghost of a murdered prostitute
whose body was found outside of the warehouse who haunted the place.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another worker and myself were able to make contact with her
several times a day.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This is my experience and I just wanted to share it with
you.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi my name is Kane and I live in <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Massachusetts</st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have two experience that I think could
potenti<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y be connected to one
another.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The first is a very strange dream I had when I was 12 or 13
years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In my dream I was talking to my great grandmother on the
phone. My great grandmother had passed away more than a few years ago and I wasn't
particularly close to her, but in my dream we had a very lengthy
conversation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't remember any of
the convorsation except for the very end, she asked if my grandfather still
loved me, and i said yes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she said
"ok goodbye" and that's when I woke up to me sitting straight up
talking into my pinky and with my thumb up to my ear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said goodbye too while I was wide awake and
then i opened my eyes and just laughed alittle bit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't feel an eerie presence at <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> I just felt extremely aware and awake for just
waking up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't re<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y think much of this at <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>
and just went about my day.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The second is a phone c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>
I got when i was awake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was at my
father's house downstairs on the computer right next to the phone. So natur<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y I'd be the first to pick up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The phone rang so i picked it up and said
hello.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was greeted by a raspy, weak, and quite voice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could barely make out what she was saying,
she said "Hello is this Kane?" and i said yes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she said a slew of other things to me that
I can't remember, <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> i remember is
that i couldn't do anything but agree with her it was like i was set to
autopilot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she aksed me if we were
still meeting later that day, and a million questions went through my head
like, who is this woman, and where am I going to meet her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But for some reason <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>
i could say was yes i couldn't help but be extremely polite as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then before i knew the phone was hung up and
i was back to staring at the computer, right away I couldn't remember what the
woman had said to me, <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> I could
remember was the end of the conversation and how <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>
i could do was agree with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned
around and told my dad's girlfriend about it and she just said it was
wierd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could have been some crazy old
woman but that doesn't explain how she knew my name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If anyone can try and explain these events to
me it would be very much appreciated, also I have a few other stories I'd love
to share and hopefully I can at a later date, but anyway email me at
kgelaznik@hotmail.com thank you for your time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>If you have read my
experience titled Red Eyes, then you know that my older daughter and I, when we
were both four years old, saw red unblinking eyes. My middle daughter talked to
angles when she was four, and I was waiting for my son to turn four so that I
could see if anything supernatural would happen to him. Well, he is four and a
half now and something weird did happen. He has this toy dinosuar that is made
of plastic on the outside and foam on the inside and it's about two feet t<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>. This toy sits on his shelf across the room from
his bed. One night he was sleeping and my oldest daughter and I were in the
living room. We heard that dinosaur f<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>
to the floor ( his room has a hard wood floor). I went in and picked it up and
put it back, he was sound asleep. I sat back down and we heard it f<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> again. My son started to cry for me and when I
went to check on him, he was shaking and in hysterics. He told me that he had a
dream that his dinosaur was alive and was going to get him! For like an hour he
was shaking so bad that I thought he was having convulsions and I should take
him to the hospital. Freaky huh?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
seems to be the norm for one extremely scarry thing to happen to the people in
my family when we're four years old and then <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>
the other supernatural stuff that happens later does'nt seem so frightening.
I've had numerous experiences with shadow people, premonitions, ghosts etc. and
now it looks like my oldest daughter is folowing in my footsteps. The other day
she told me that she sees shadowy figures <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>
the time!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Here is a general layout of my upstairs h<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>way before i start my story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When you walk up the stairs and turn left my
room is the 1st room on the leftside, across from my bedroom is a
bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you walk to the end of the
h<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> way you will hit my parents
room which is on the right side next to the bathroom and just past my parents
room is my sisters room, which is opposite of the h<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>way
to my bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyways, One night at
Exactly 1:20AM, i decided i was going to go to bed, i walked up the stairs and
was about to turn left to go into my room, i looked straight ahead and seen
that there was a figure that was probably between 6'0-6'3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It resembled a man,it was looking in my
direction and had its right hand almost touching my parents door handle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could see through it but i could tell
something was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The figure can be
best explained if you've ever seen the movie "Predator".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the movie in you can tell something is
there but you can't make out facial features etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyways, after i seen the figure my

<p class="MsoNormal">I tell you this story from my experience. This happened when
I was studying in my university. At that time, I was far away from home and
stayed in a hostel near my university with my friends. Before I moved in the
hostel, my friend who lived in that hostel told me that it was haunted. Actu<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y, before the hostel was built, it was a house
whose owner commited suicide. That's why many people said that hostel was
haunted. They said that the spirit of the owner has ever appeared near the
kitchen at night. Another said that sometimes you could hear the crying voice
from that woman. At that time, just only one last room left on the second floor
so I had to stay in that room. My room was in the last row. Many people said my
room was not good because the surrounding around my room was quite dark and
sunshine could not reach my room. There were about four to five days, I had
kept awaking at 2.30am. After that, one night, I was terribly tired and went to
bed earlier than usual. And again...!! I thought I woke up at 2.30am again but
this time was because of my blanket. I felt like 'somebody' was pulling my
blanket from my feet and I pulled it up again. And 'somebody' was pulling it
down again. Because I felt annoyed and wanted to sleep, I just said, "Stop
it...!! Don't disturb me... I re<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y
want to sleep..". But I wonder I said it loudly or not. After that, it re<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y stopped and I continued to sleep. 'Nobody'
pulled my blanket again. In the morning, when I woke up, I remebered what has
happened last night and I started shaking. I am frightened of whatever kind of
ghost things but last night I didn't feel afraid at <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>.
Maybe I was too tired and sleepy. Until now, I don't understand why I didn't
felt afraid and change y room at that time.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal">just got done reading your web site, awesome!!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">any way now of course I'm afraid to go to bed!!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I just wanted to tell you about an experience i had about
the church that is out there. before the new owners took over in 2004 i got
permission from the old owners to go out there and take some pictures of the
church and grounds. we did go in the school also and had heard footsteps on
floors above us. in the church there are the most beautiful paintings on the w<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>s that i wanted to take pictures of, however my
camera would not work in the church. it worked before we went in the church and
after we came out of the church but not in it! weird huh? also another
interesting fact there was a trail cut through the woods behind the school to
the left of the cemetery that is down right cold in the middle of the day 80
degree weather, also have seen lights out there at night. another fact, back in
2003-2004 a few kids went out there one night and were walking past the flag
pole and the flag pole "somehow" impaled one of the boys in the
chest. how did that happen? weird! like the web site said it is now under new
owner ship and heavily watched by law enforcement, do not trespass! great web
site and keep up the good work.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I was sleeping over my best friends Jasmines house and the
night before her mother promised us BLT's for breakfast. So that night after
setting me up an air mattress close to here door we had gone to bed. That night
was peaceful but forever I will remember that horrific morning. I woke up and
looked up at the bed where a person was sitting staring at me. She was young
around my age at the time with features like my friend. I was still half a
sleep and it looked like my friend but I didn't notice it wasn't. I asked her
when we were going to go down stairs for the BLT's and she said in a minute.
Well, I layed back down and gazed at the door and then I noticed it wasn't
jasmine that I was speaking too. The door never opened in her room and somehow
the girl was gone. I had screamed loud and ran down the stairs. To find Jasmine
and her mother there with fear on they&#8217;re on faces. When I told them my story
her mother looked at me and told me Jasmine was downstairs for over 45 minutes
and when I screamed the top of the milk popped off and hit the ceiling of the
kitchen with is directly below Jasmine's room.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Ever since I have only seen the girl twice. On my friends
birthday I was downstairs getting cake for some of the other girls and I saw
her standing in the pantry watching me and the other time I was in the basement
with Jasmine and her sister getting some laundry and we <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>
saw the girl run across the basement living room to a storage room. I haven&#8217;t
gone back there since. But the last experience helped my friends not think I
was crazy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi. I've been enjoying your site and I wanted to share some
of my experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, I went to <st1:placename w:st="on">Mercyhurst</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">College</st1:placetype>
in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Erie</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">PA</st1:state></st1:place>
in 1995 - 1996 and I left in the f<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>
when my father died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, I lived in
Egan H<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>, which is connected to Old
Main and the chapel and I saw the nun and her antics almost daily in the f<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> of 1996.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I saw her reflection in the bathroom windows at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She often opened and closed windows and
doors, turned faucets and radios on and flushed the toilets for hours on
end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was frightened at first but my
room mate (a very down to earth and logical girl) told me a friend of hers who
lived on the boys' floor saw the sister every morning around 4:00am when he got
up for crew practice and that she was only there to look out for us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turns out that the heartbroken suicidal
nun story is just a fun, creepy story and the truth is that the nun died
peacefully of old age and stuck around to keep an eye on <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>
the students.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also used to see a blue
orb floating from the chapel through old main when I was coming back from the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">computer lab late at night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Other students had seen the orb originate from a sm<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> statue in the chapel and a figure had been seen
in the organ loft as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have heard
that the path between ampus and the new convent is haunted but I can't verify
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Springboro</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">PA</st1:state></st1:place>,
there is a large Victorian house which had been used as a stop in the
Underground Railroad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There had been a
tunnel between the basement and barn but the tunnel was filled in in the late
70's or early 80's for safety reasons and the barn was moved to Conneautville
at some point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are cold spots
throughout the house and a feeling of being watched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes you can see strange reflections in
the windows and lights or figures just at the edge of your field of vision. The
basement is very frightening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a
feeling of pressure and a very dark and menacing feeling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I mean,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I feel very threatened if I go down there no matter the time of
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I'm alone in the living room
without the tv on, I can hear muffled voices from the basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have always felt very negatively in this
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The night before I was scheduled to return home, I c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>ed my girlfriend but she was not home, so I left

times, I hung the phone up. Later that night I again tried to c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> my girlfriend and this time she was home. As we
spoke, she told me that she had received both my messages. Having only c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>ed once before, I was very perplexed. I asked her
what I said on the messages and she described the first message that left to a
tee, but she thought that I was teasing her with the second message since she
thought that I might be giving her a violin for her birthday. After some
prompting, she told me that she heard scratchy violin music, like a beginner
tuning their instrument, followed by me saying &#8220;hello, hello&#8221;. I thought she
was joking, but when I could tell that she was serious, I asked her if it
sounded like &#8220;musac&#8221;, static or some other background noise. She had the voice
messages still on her answering machine, and she played both messages back to
me. On the first message, I could clearly hear my voice saying that &#8220;I just c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>ed to say hi and that I would see her tomorrow&#8221;.
The second message starts with about 4 seconds of clear but scratchy violin
music, and then I could very clearly hear my voice saying &#8220;hello, hello&#8221;. My
girlfriend said that both the messages had my phone number on the c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>er ID. By this time I had convinced her that I
did not leave the violin music on her machine (nor were there any TV&#8217;s or
radio&#8217;s turned on in my room during the c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>).
All I could think of was that I may have been hearing some future event when my
girlfriend would be tuning her violin and that I would not be around to hear
it! So I changed my plane reservations to take a different flight home. Nothing
happened to the plane that I would have been on, but I can not help but think
that the violin music was meant to be some type of warning. Maybe I would have
had car accident if I took the other flight, or I would have been hit crossing
the road. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Regardless, an omen like that is hard to ignore. I have kept
the &#8220;message &#8220; recording as a reminder of this very strange experience.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">May, 2006. It happened again! After over three and a half
years, we received another ghostly phone c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>.
Last night we were sitting at home when my wife&#8217;s (my girlfriend in 2002) cell
phone rang. She answered it and at first did not hear anything. Then the sound
of the same scratchy violin music became slowly more pronounced. She said hello
several times but had no response except the &#8220;music&#8221;. She handed the cell phone
to me and I also heard the violin. Then the sound just stopped. I did not hear
a phone hang up. It just stopped. I closed the cell phone lid, and then checked
the c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> log. There was no record of
a c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> (incoming or</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">outgoing) to the cell phone at that time! I am scheduled for
another flight to <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Atlanta</st1:place></st1:city>
on Thursday. I sure wish I could get out of it!!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the Chinese calendar, people believe that the month of
July is the time where <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> ghosts
come to earth from hell. We c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>ed
it the ghost festival. This is why Chinese people are very used to buy incenses
in order to pray for these ghosts.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">During last year's ghost festival, something strange
happened onto my family. It was the time where <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>
my aunts and uncles and other relatives come back to my nanny's house. The
entire family of mine sat in the living room watching tv and chit-chating.
Suddenly, one of my aunt started yelling very loudly.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">" I'm cold! I'm bleeding! I'm in pain!" She then
ran upstairs and start throwing everything she saw. She acted insanely and her
face turned pale. Everyone of us in the family was shocked by her actions. We
were panicked and did not have any idea of what had happened. My nanny was the
only person who remained calm. Immediately she c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>ed
the ritual witch (whom we c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>ed her
as Bomoh) to the house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As soon as the Bomoh arrived, my aunt ran to her and wanted
to choke her to death. She yelled, " I'm dead! And now it's your
turn!" Two of my cousins immediately captured her and pull her away from
the bomoh. The witch then murmured as if cast g some spells on my aunt. About
hald an hour later, my aunt was awake. She said she felt exhausted and asked
everyone what had happened just now. At the moment we told her the truth, my
aunt was frightened and couldn't believe to that. The withch told us that she
was possessed by a ghost who was killed in an accident years ago.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have always been an avid believer in ghost. I have never
seen one physic<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y manifest itself
in human form and I don't think I could cope if i did. I have an intense fear
of ghost and at the same time a morbid fascination with them. My first
experience happened when I was 14 years old. I was going to stay with a friend
of mine in a seaside village in <st1:city w:st="on">Cornw<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname></st1:city>
(<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region></st1:place>),
I think it is c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>ed Portscatho. My
Dad had a friend who drove me down to the meeting point where my friend, whose
family were already staying there, would pick me up. This guy's name was Mick
and he was the nicest guy you could imagine. We joked <st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>
the way down in the car and he wound me up with stories of the Beast of Bodmin,
a supposed large wild cat lives that lives on the moors in Dartmoor (the county
before <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cornw<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname></st1:place></st1:city>).
We had a good laugh but by the time we reached the meeting point it had gotten
dark and my friend was unable to pick me up. Mick took me back to his house
where I met his wife Jenny. Jenny was as nice as Mick but she was a little
kooky, looking at things that weren't there and drawing re<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y childlike pictures with crayons. I didn't re<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y think much of it because I was tired from the
journey, I was more fascinated by their house. Their house was so large that it
had been divided into 4 appartments, each one with winding stairs, large rooms
and old fashioned structures, the house itself dates back to the 1700s. After I
while I went upstairs to sleep in their son's room (he was away at the time)
and set about rifling through his music collection to pass the time. His Cds
were in one corner of the room and everytime I was looking through them I felt
like I was being watched from another corner of the room. I looked over to
where I felt this presence emmanating from and saw nothing except a barred
window. It was only a sm<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> window
with a few bars across it and very high up but there was nothing there that
should have made me feel so watched. I felt sleepy so I turned the lights out
and got into bed. As I was drifting off I felt that same feeling of being
watched, I snapped my eyes open and felt as if something retreated. Ignoring
this 'irrational' feeling I turned over to sleep on my side with my back to the
w<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>. At that moment the door, which
was one of those old barn-like doors with a latch, made a noise. I heard the
latch lift up and the door slowly creak open. Next the lights snapped on and i
was blinking in shock, trying to see what had happened. Next thing I heard was
a scuffling as something retreated down the steps accompanied by a horrific
cackling, under the breath laughter that scared the hell out of me. I tried to
see what had happened but the door opened towards me and the light switch was
beyond that so I had no way of seeing who had turned the light on. From my bed
I tried to c<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname> out 'Mick? Jenny?'
but the words were re<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y hard to
say, I was scared that any noise might bring the something back. I couldn't
sleep with the light on so I scuttled out of bed, switched it off and practic<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y jumped back into bed and under the covers where
I felt 'safe'. I fin<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y fell asleep
and thought nothing of it. I didn't re<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y
think about it again until a few months later when, out of the blue, my Dad
mentioned he was thinking of taking me to <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cornw<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname></st1:place></st1:city> to stay at that house.
I told him my story and he told me that the house was haunted and that Jenny
was one of those people who could see ghosts and communicate with them. He told
me that the ghost that did that was probably Harry, a mischievious ghost. He
also told me that the house was full of them, a lot of children could be heard
playing on the steps and a Chinese washer woman was alwas communicating with
Jenny whe she cleaned the kitchen. This at least explained some of Jenny's
unusual behaviour, she could sense laylines and everything. Being terrified of
ghost I tot<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y freaked upon hearing
this, especi<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y as Dad told me we
were going to stay there. A few months later, after my exams he took me there
as a 'treat'. Knowing what I now knew it felt a little unsavoury. I was
absolutely terrified walking into that house, especi<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y
as Mick and Jenny were away. I felt watched everywhere I went and on the first
night I didnt sleep a wink or turn off the lights. The rest of the holiday I
actu<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y spent sleeping in the same
bed as my Dad, a little unorthodox for a girl of 15 but if it was a choice
between my Dad and the ghosts I'd choose my Dad any day! The last thing that
happened which re<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y scared me was
that Jenny popped back for a short while and whilst there was cleaning the
kitchen, as she did I repeatedly saw her brush off something that wasn't there
and say (with a giggle) 'Get off' in the calm and patient way a mother does to
a child that's pestering her for cookies. Next thing I saw an invisible force
actu<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y pinch her clothing and pull
it from her, I actu<st1:personname w:st="on">all</st1:personname>y saw the
shirt she was wearing become pinched and pulled away by NOTHING...she looked at
me and said 'Oh don;t worry that's just Hong Lee the washer woman, she thinks
I'm not doing a good job of these surfaces'. We didn't stay much longer.</p>

house after the party.That day,we had a lot of fun and played until mid-night.I
still remembered that we played until 12am.When it was 12am,everyone had gone
home.Then,I had to clean up my friend's house.At that time,my friend went to
bath and I cleaned up her house myself.Suddenly,I saw a shadow outside her
house.It seem like a girl.It was wearing a red shirt with long hair.I was
shocked.When I looked clearly,the shadow was coming nearly to me.I tried to
move and screamed but I couldn't.I was very scared.The shadow came nearly and

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Three years ago I was taking university classes at St.
Peter's college in Muenster <st1:state w:st="on">Saskatchewan</st1:state>,
about and hour and a half drive east of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Saskatoon</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The College was originally built as a monastery for
Benedictine monks who came up from <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Minnesota</st1:place></st1:state>
to found a colony around 1900.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
then it had been a expanded from a boy's-only school to a fully integrated,
co-ed college.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are several ghosts
on the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One is, supposedly, the
ghost of the first Bishop of the area who apparently died before the building's
construction was completed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He can be
seen occasionally walking the grounds. The other is the ghost of a small boy
who had committed suicide, or died from an accident, by falling out an upper story
window.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The year before I came to the college the fourth floor was
used for the Drama and Art classes and also had a small room where the staff
could go for coffee breaks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day one
of the women went upstairs to make some coffee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She was standing with her back to the door, loading the coffee
maker, when she felt a presence behind her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Turning around she saw a small boy standing there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;This would be easier with the lights on,&#8221; he
said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He flipped the lights on, then
vanished right in front of her.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The first year that I attended school I took part in an
amateur night one Friday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was invited
back to the girl's residence by some friends for tea. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The place had originally been a housing for the small group
of nuns that had lived at the colony, and was only a few feet from the main
buildings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was after midnight when I finally said good night and
headed out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had taken no more then
three steps when I had the most unshakable feeling that something did not want
me on the grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was the
sensation that I was being chased that I just couldn't stand and I ran to my
car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The feeling didn't stop until I
crossed the railroad tracks, which, I found out later, was the marker of the
boundaries of the college grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
told some friends about this and we all agreed that we should stay some time
after midnight and try to see some ghosts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well, we tried, but that's as far as it went.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of us had the nerve to stay past
midnight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Strange feelings and weird
noises always promoted us to leave just before the midnight hour.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello,I've never told anyone outside my family and it scares
me when I do talk about it because when I open myself up to it I have more
problems.The house I used to live in I would hear foot steps like someone was
home,I was not the only one to hear it.I would be home alone and think my
husband came home and I would go to meet him at the door,but no one was
there.It was not a big house and I could hear everything around it.But I would
get so freaked out and run out of the house.I had other strange things happen
to me I can't explain very well.Like seeing something like a water ball in the
air or cloud and I was under the idea that it was some kind of spirit because I
could actually feel the pain this thing was going through while being held down
and not able to move,I would try to call out to my husband but he could not
hear me,I was making no noise.It did not last long I don't think.And it had
happened to me before.It scares me to death.I've had several other experiences
not all the same.I feel I can tell when there is a spirit around there is a
pressure in my chest and my body feels all weird,but this does not happen
often.I shouldn't even be talking about this or acnolaging this because I just
know something is going to find me.I live in a pretty good house now I hope
noting happens here.I've had some things happen but I hope it's not
unusual.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal">This is a ghost sotory about a haunting I witnessed years
ago.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I used to live in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Whittier</st1:city>,
 <st1:state w:st="on">California</st1:state></st1:place>, and thank goodness I
moved!! When I was in the eighth grade, a bunch of friends and I would have
sleepovers at this girl's house because her parents were really fun. One night
her mom told us a story about how when they first moved into the house they
began to notice a lot of scary things going on at night. Weird noises would be
heard when everyone was asleep, things would crash or fall down for no reason
and sometimes a little girl's voice could be heard. We never really believed
her stories until one night. Ashley's mother told us that a few months after
they had moved in, and had heard some of these strange happeneings already, a
neighbor told them about a family used to live there a long time ago. The
little girl of the family had been accidentally shot and killed by her older
brother one night as her parents were out for the evening. The accident
happened in a bedroom that Ashley's little brother now sleeps in (although they
didnt tell him that). Supposedly the little girl they had heard was her.
Although I can't recall her name anymore, I remember the night she haunted us
exactly. We were way into holding seances and teling scary stories, so one
night we found directions on how to give a seance and we began. Sitting around
a circular, wooden table, with candles, and all of us holding hands, we began c
nting. We had set up a video camera ACROSS the room from us to record anything
weird. A few mintues into the seance we heard something crash in the living
room. It was quick and sounded like glass, we looked EVERYWHERE but nothing was
found. We continued, and soon half of the room got very cold and the weird
thing was that all of the windows were closed. My friend, Brittany, began
shivering, but I was two people down from her and felt warm. We got too scared
and broke the circle. The next morning we watched the video tape...what we saw
amazed us all! The video camera started of normal but then began zooming in on
each and every one of us. Then it faded in and out on certain people and a red
light flashed on the family members. The haunting thing was that in order for
the camera to zoom in and out or fade, someone has to MANUALLY hold down the
zoom button and fading button..but none of us were doing that because we were
having the seance. We think the little girl was there, watching us as we
chanted out to her. After that, I never returned and I have not talked to them
about the ghost since then.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunted Movie Theater</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: ebauer@premiercarriagetrade.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I lived in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">San
  Francisco</st1:place></st1:city> for 4 years in the mid &#8216;80s. I worked as a
theatre manager for a couple years at the &#8216;Regency I Theater&#8217; located on Van
Ness.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It is no longer a theater and is now vacant. I was told some
history of the building, that it was once a dance hall in the late 1800&#8217;s among
other things. The building was 5 stories, and had been renovated to become a
movie house. There were two floors under the main floor and two floors above.
The 1st basement floor was a huge lounge bar area, dark, dusty and cluttered
and below that floor was an old huge kitchen area where the electrical room is
located also dark. There was no lighting, the ushers used their mag lights when
the had to be down there. The floors above the main floor were old dressing
rooms and odd shaped rooms. The odd shaped rooms seemed to be rooms that after
the renovations became unusable, except for storage. They were too small for a
person to stand upright or sloped. Also, there was a grand marbled staircase in
the main lobby that came to a dead end at the top.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My first day of training, I was sitting in the office with
another manager and she was showing me the daily paperwork. I began to hear
stomping and tapping on the ceiling, but in a rhythm, kind of like line dancing
or a chorus line dancing right above me. I jokingly asked if there was a dance
studio above us, and the answer made me laugh&#8230;"it&#8217;s the ghosts". I
was the new girl, I left it at that.? Also, I should add, I'm a believer in
ghosts because of past experiences as a child.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As I became more familiar with the ushers and stand workers,
I began hearing more references to the ghosts and odd sightings. The current
ushers would initiate the new ushers by scaring them, telling the new guys the
ghost stories, etc&#8230;although sometimes it backfired. One of the last duties of
the closing usher was to go downstairs the two flights to the old kitchen area
and turn off the electricity by grabbing a large lever and pulling it down(or
was it up?). Well, the head usher would tell the new guy that he had to go down
stairs to do this and then another usher would hide in any of the many dark
corners off the stairway or behind the numerous pieces of old equipment down
there. Late one night I was waiting for the ushers to come back upstairs so we
could leave and lock up, when running full speed out of the theater doors is
the head usher pale and scared. He can&#8217;t even talk immediately. He tells me
he&#8217;s waiting for the new guy to pass by him in the dark stairway to scare him
and he gets grabbed and breathed on from behind.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There wasn&#8217;t any room for another body behind him, and us 3
were the only ones in the building. He never went downstairs again.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Back to the chorus line dancing sounds. I was beginning to
get used to it, but the sounds had to have an explanation. So one evening when
I was in the office and it started, I grabbed the master keys and went
upstairs, and found the room above the office. It was one of the odd shaped
rooms. When you opened the door, the room was only 4 feet tall and about 20ft
by 20ft, and very quiet with old movie one sheet posters &amp; old ticket
machines stored in there. I saw no dancing girls or heard anything.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One morning, before opening for the afternoon matinee, I was
alone, awaiting the opening usher to tap on the front glass doors, I was
working on candy inventory in the office. I&#8217;m inside the office, right near the
open door and in my peripheral vision I see a male in black and white walk past
right next to the office door through the lobby. The ushers wore black pants
and a white dress shirt. I hardly budged and just spoke out loud to what I
thought was the opening usher, Hey Alex! How&#8217;d you get in?? No answer. I get up
from the desk to look for him in one of the concession stands where it looked
he was going to hang up his street clothes as the ushers did. No one there,
when I hear the tap, tap, tap at the glass front doors. I retrace my steps past
the office and go the other direction to the front doors and there&#8217;s Alex!!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One late show while the last movie of the night was in
progress and the main lobby was empty, I was walking over to the ticket machine
to empty it for the night and as I passed the grand stairs that went to &#8216;no
where&#8217;, I notice a male figure in a black tails tux and top hat and cane
walking down those stairs(getting goosebumps remembering) He was very elegant
but was almost transparent and fading fast then gone in a matter of 5 seconds.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I had also seen individuals seated in the balcony
projectionist area, which was off limits to the public, thinking it was an
usher on break, or just making sure one of the public was not up there, I would
investigate&#8230;no one would be there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I loved that job and only left because I moved back down
south to <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">San Diego</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Madison Story</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: craig.kramer@gmail.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I'm writing you a story about an experience I had with my
best friend/roommate from a few years ago.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We lived in a typical apartment complex on the east side of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Madison</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">WI</st1:state></st1:place>.
</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We had been out with friends all evening and had come back
home to hang out because we still had a lot of energy going.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before we knew it, it was nearly 2 am.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were night owls back then, so this wasn't
anything out of the ordinary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to
get us something to eat in the kitchen while my roommate was lying on the
sofa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was busy in the fridge looking
for ideas, when I asked him if he wanted anything in particular.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He didn't answer me, so I repeated my
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With still no response, I
turned away from the fridge to face the living room where I had left him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next thing I saw froze me where I
stood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two feet in front of me was the
ugliest, most wretched woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her body
was snaked out from my roommate's chest (in the living room) to right before me
(in the kitchen).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was reaching her
hands out manically trying to touch/grab me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She looked like the personification of a<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>well-aged corpse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her fingers
were less than an inch from my face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
the most terrifying part the experience with the scream eminating from this
woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't audible, it was in my
head...and it was the kind of maniacal screaming that could, quite literally,
drive a person mad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This transgression
lasted only a few seconds, and then she was gone; sucked back into my roommate
in a blur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He sat bolt upright in an
almost comical fashion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked at me
with fear on his face like I've never seen before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then asked me if I saw
"her".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told him I had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told me that when I went to the kitchen,
she had been standing in the entrance to his bedroom (just off of the living
room); she had seen him seeing her and had run at him full force and jumped
into him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it took all of his being to keep her from
getting loose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said it was the most
terrifying thing that had ever happened to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Tears were dripping down his face.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rest of the night became increasingly worse...<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My friend/roommate has since told me that I shouldn't live
with him anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that all of
his life he's been a sort of "Divining Rod for Spirits".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that he generally tries to ignore
them and they thus leave him alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
rest of that particular evening was more than enough to convince me to pack my
bags.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We're still best friends, but we
don't talk about that evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Writing
this is as far as I'll ever go to recalling it to friends/strangers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Smudge and Indy</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: gibsonburgman@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have two stories that make me believe that cats can come
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first experience was when I
was living in a trailer court in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Novi</st1:city>,
 <st1:state w:st="on">Michigan</st1:state></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About four years after we moved in, I noticed
a little gray and white cat in our yard, thinking it was a stray I brought it
in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This cat was so small we named him
Smudge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After doing so it hung around
and came and went as it pleased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
went on for about a year and a half then one summer night I had a sad dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this dream, Smudge came in and stayed then
went out, as it got down to the sidewalk, it stopped and turned around and
looked up at my mother and myself and meowed, it sounded so sad it almost
sounded like it was saying goodbye.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After doing this a couple times it turned around and walked away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning I woke up knowing that we'll
never see Smudge again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About a week
later we had seen him in the yard next door, as I approached him he ran away
around the front of the trailer next door, after that day we hadn't seen him
since.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was so sad because in a way my
dream had come true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then one day, I had
the door open and thought I had heard Smudge meowing to be let in, so I went
and opened the door but didn't see a thing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I even looked under the deck and saw nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But from that day up until almost to the day
that we moved to <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ohio</st1:place></st1:state>
in 2003 whenever mother or I would be out on the porch we would either hear
Smudge meowing or feel something small and furry brush up against our legs.
There were even a couple times where we had thought we had seen Smudge running
and playing in our yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was almost
like he was telling me that he was safe and everything was okay.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The other story involved my aunt and uncles' calico cat
named Indy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My aunt and uncle live here
in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:state w:st="on">Ohio</st1:state></st1:place> and
their house is urrounded by farmers fields.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They had Indy ever since she was a kitten and was mostly and outdoor
cat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But she was a very friendly and
affectionate cat when it came to people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whenever a person came outside, she would come up to you, purr, let you
pet her and would play with you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
you sat down on the porch she would come up to you and either curl up next to
you or in your lap and go to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well
during the latter part of 2003 when mother and I was staying with them, she was
in failing health, being sixteen human years old it was like she was a senior
citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would not eat as much, she
would take to sleeping all day and had trouble walking and would sometimes fall
over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we first seen her she was
nice and plump, but near the end she was skin and bones and weighed practically
nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well on October 31, 2003 they
took her to the vet and had her put to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was at work when this happened and my mother told me what happened. I
was heartbroken because I loved that cat like he was my own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But from that time forward up until we moved
into our own apartment in 2004 both mother and I would notice little things
happening that we would attribute to Indy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There would be times that her or I would hear scratching on the garage
door and when we opened it nothing was there, we would also here a meowing
coming from the area of the garage where Indy slept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And whenever we sat on the front porch, we
would hear the meowing there as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
also would feel something playfully brush up against us, that was always Indys
way of telling us she wanted to play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
also felt her brushing up against our legs as if a cat wanted us to pet
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There would also be times that we
would feel something climb into our laps like a cat would when it wants to
cuddle with you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would also hear
Indys purring on the porch and in the garage as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The encounters with Indy was about two years
ago and the Smuge encounters were about seven years ago, but they make me
believe that your beloved pets can come back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I can only hope that they have found piece and are on the other side
now.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I currently live on <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Okinawa</st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region w:st="on">Japan</st1:country-region></st1:place>, and I
have a ghost story (duh!). One day me and my friend decided to go up to one of
the haunted houses on the air force base we live at. When we got up there we
decided not to go in the house, because we were a little scared. We then
decided to go towards thetombs that were near the house and we would check that
out, but just as we were about to go up there she froze, grabbed my sleeve and
ran downhill as fast as I've ever seen her run. When I got to the bottom, I
asked what happened and she said she saw this japanese man with his hands on
either side of his head and he looked really, really angry. She was freaked out
for a minute, but was fine after that. As we were walking, I was bored so I
started reading the license plates, and I suddenly stopped. She asked me what
was wrong, and I told that the numbers on the license plates and on the house
were turning into red or yellow eyes and that people were following us. She
told me no one was there and it was my imagination. It kept getting worse and
she started to think we were being haunted. After that, I became scarred for
life. We were only 11, so we were a little freaked.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I was about 5 and my bedroom was the 2nd bedroom on the 4th
floor and that night I got up to get a glass of water when in the corner of the
bedroom I saw a figure it looked about 15-16</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">he was staring at me in bed so I ran down the stairway and
hid behind the sofa. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my mum and dad came rushing down and asked me what was
wrong. I told them but as typical parents then normally didn't believe there
children! they told me t get back in bed and to talk about it in the morning.
when I got back in bed I finally got to sleep. I woke up about 4 hours later
and the It would of been 4.00 in the morning and I saw him again but this time
he was standing on my bed looking down at me and then lied on me and went never
to be seen again.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: slicknick0073@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well it all happened at about 3am on a friday night, my 2
friends and I were bored and looking for something to do when my one friend
said she heard a story about a Haunted Tunnel on a local road near where we
live.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we decided to check it
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The myth is that a young woman I guess
apparently was killed in the tunnel and a young boy committed suicide by hanging
off the top of the tunnel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What you are
supposed to do is drive as close to in the middle of the tunnel as you can and
put your car in nuetral and turn off all the lights and put down all your
windows and shut off your radio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
you are supposed to blow your horn and what is supposed to happen is the girl
is apparently supposed to "push" whatever vehicle you have and try
and get you out of "her" tunnel and she is supposed to say things
like "get out" "don't come back" "leave now" and
the young boy is supposed to be seen through your rear view mirror hanging
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well we did exactly that, I was
driving a 2003 GMC Sierra truck and i drove it in the middle as much as
possible and then i turned off all my lights, radio, and threw it in nuetral. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Then...I blew the horn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a matter of seconds my truck moved about 2
feet because you could see and hear the truck going over the rocks on the road
in the tunnel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then apparently my one
friend sitting in the front seat saw the girl walking away from the truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We all heard noises but in all honesty
couldn't hear exact sentences, but the one thing that i did not see was the boy
so whether that is true or not still remains to be seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One thing that I am for sure was weird was
the presence of new, hand prints on my truck.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I know it sounds far fetched or whatever and i don't even know if
handprints can be taken ff a spirit but i do know that my tailgate had hand
prints on it and my one window on my back door had hand prints on it like
somebody was tryin to look in the window to see what was going on and the other
prints were to push my truck out of the tunnel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then as we were leaving the tunnel(left in a big hurry) i was going up a
hill around a bend and a light in my dashboard started to flicker, the light
for the bed of the truck to haul things, that light started to flicker real
quick, i was the only one to see it but i knew it happened it is a very
specific shape size and color so i did not mistake it for something else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I mean i just wanted to really get that off
my chest and share my story because i used to be a non-believer to an extent in
these things but now that i have experienced this first hand it has made me
change my mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>thanks for taking the
time to read this email. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I live in this really nice little town in northern <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">California</st1:place></st1:state>. My
grandparents own a trailor park and we all live there. My very bestfriend moved
into the house behind me. But a few years earlier my aunt and uncle moved out
of that house because they said it had been makin them feel uncomftorable. My
aunt had told me stories of voices she heard and one black image she had seen
repeatedly. So when my friend moved in I didnt want anything to do with the
house. Finally when I had gotten a alittle older I started staying over night.
The first night I kept hearing whispers and stuff bumping around I thought it
was my imagination. The next day I asked my friend if she had heard anything
and she said yes before I could tell her what I had heard she started
explaining it and it was exactly the same thing I had heard. So the next time I
stayed over I was sleeping and I woke up out of a dead sleep and I looked over
at the door and it was wide open and we had shut it before we went to sleep. And
in the doorway I saw this big black image just like it was floating there. So I
closed my eyes and when I opened them again it was gone and the door was
closed. I have seen it many times after that as has my friend and her family.
Obviously its not there to hurt us it just wants us to know its there, oh and
trust me we know.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We purchased a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>home
in Historic Richmondtown back in the Fall of 1995. After the restoration, we
happily moved in. I detested walking around that area with our dog in tow. I
always felt as though someone<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was
watching, especially on the back roads behind <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Mace Street</st1:address></st1:street>(located just behind <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Richmond Road</st1:address></st1:street>).
There was one house which had been abandoned for many years. The path which
lead up to the front door was overgrown and hidden by trees and a marsh-like
area. The stream next to the house lead down to the parking lot by the church
on <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Amboy Road</st1:address></st1:street>.
</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>An eerie presence
existed in the basement of the home just as though something was lingering or
waiting. I felt as though someone was looking through our windows on the front
porch. We even heard sounds(similar to a break-in)during the middle of the
night coming from the basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
husband is a member of the NYPD along with most of our relatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Family members stayed with me when my husband
was working nights<span style="">&nbsp; </span>because I was
terrified of being alone in that house. My husband and our children even heard
those noises and felt as though something negative was watching them(especially
in the basement). Many relatives heard the same noises to the extent that they
themselves called the police; only for their<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>fellow officers to find nothing after an extensive search.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Your website confirmed what I was feeling. I am greatful to
you and your research.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We relocated our family to Upstate New York. The eerie
feelings and presence were never to be felt again. Yet, the house was renovated
once again. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I wish someone would go over to the <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Apts in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Kent</st1:country-region></st1:place> and check it out, the place is
crawling with the paranormal.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I lived there from 2000 to 2002 and can tell you first hand
that I had quite a few experiences, to where I finally had to move out. The
complex was built atop an old rock quarry overlooking the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Green River</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Bridge</st1:placetype></st1:place>
on <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Meeker Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>.
They used to mine crystal quartz there and the place still has a certain energy
to it, it is also been rumored that an old Indian Burial ground is located
somewhere nearby.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There have been reports of a man walking through the lobby
at night and a tall shadowy figure hanging out in the north section of the
complex and a little boy &amp; his dog, I heard those stories from the managers
themselves. I am very psychic myself and witnessed the tall shadowy figure on two
different occasions, I even have videotape of orbs seen in the vicinity of the
kitchen, a place that seemed to be</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the center of activity. At the time of the incidents I asked
managements permission to run the story but they declined for fear of the owner
getting word. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Overall, the complex has 225 units but hardly anyone ever
visited the weight room or the indoor pool. I can tell you that I too could
hardly stay in those areas for It felt as if someone were watching you all the
time.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On two different occasions I contacted Evening Magazine to
try and set up a visit by them. The first team was on its way when one of them
got deathly ill, the others took it as a bad omen and cancelled. A second group
attempted a visit 3 months later but also cancelled when an English member of
the team had to rush back home due to a medical emergency involving her mother
in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I no longer live in the complex but always wished that
someone would go and check it out. Believe me, you will definitely find
something.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have been an avid ghost hunter for years and when my best
friend and partner in crime died 2 years ago, I haven't done much. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Recently, though, my grand daughter, my son and 2 friends
have been exploring the local cemeterys. Since we live outside <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Houston</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">TX</st1:state></st1:place>,
there is a lot to see.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On Easter Sunday we went to a large cemetery with a large
mausoleum. The mausoleum has large metal doors that are the only way in or out.
We were inside and I ventured down a hallway. I started to smell what smelled
like road kill, (no kiddin'!). It was really bad. I told everyone about it
(they could also smell it) and proceeded to leave as I could not stand it
anymore. As I was approaching the doors to leave, (we had left them open), the
doors slammed shut in front of me with a really load bang! My grand daughter
and a friend saw this and everyone heard it. We went ouside to look around and
no one had seen anyone (or thing) coming or going. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The strange part is no one was afraid until we thought about
what had happened.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I took picures and I am picking them up today.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have always been a non believer - until yesterday. I guess
the mysticism around ghosts and hauntings has always been such a fun thing, but
i have never taken it too seriously, having grown up a strict catholic and
believing that heaven and hell are the only two places our spirits go after we
are gone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Yesterday, after having a rather large group barbque at a
near by lake, we were left with nothing to do. <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Magic</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Kingdom</st1:placetype></st1:place>
is a theme park, which had been closed down about 10 years prior to my visit,
after a girl had been killed there. Since the little girls death, there has
been stories circulating about men taking girls there to rape and kill them in
the early years after the parks closure, but police began a close watch over
the rather large area. I believe it is now private property, but nonetheless,
being an unscrupulous teen, i love risk taking.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We were in a group of about 15 people i believe, and it
seemed really fun to me. We eventually reached an old house situated in the
middle of the park, and i have to admit, i was rather afraid, but to prove my
witt, i decided to go in, first - alone. to my disapointment, the doors and
windows were locked. We began to walk back to the entrance for another house
realising the point of our trip there was stopped by a few metal bars and our
inability and unwillingness to break into the first house, when we realised two
members of our party were missing.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I wasnt worried at all, as i knew they were playing a prank
on us. assuming they had walked back to the entrance, we decided to follow, but
on our way we recieved a call from one of them, telling us they had been
seperated and he was waiting by the lake. so we walked back to the lake, and
realised they weren't there, but this was still only part of their joke. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">a high pitched girlish scream came from somewhere near the
entrance, and in a sudden surrealist mode i ran towards the scream. there i saw
two white figures, whom i assumed were the two missing members of the party,
who were moving rather slowly, so i ran after them, but i failed to keep up and
reach them. i ran alone the whole way to the house at the entrance, where much
to my dismay, the two white figures had disapeared.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i was far to afraid to go on a hunt for them in the house,
so i waited a few minutes before the majority of the party caught up to me. i
told them i had found the other two members, that they are hiding in the house.
but the rest of the party hushed me, and told me we had to run back to the car,
for the police had been called on us. when we arrived back at the car, the two
missing members of the party, were waiting impatiently there for us - and were
both wearing black jumpers. i told them their joke was rather funny, and they
had to be amazing to get out of the park under my watchful security of the only
exit which they had been able to pass through. but they both seemed very much
clueless to these two white 'people' and when i asked them to be honest, they
declined my story as bad vision.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">im still very unsure of what i have seen, but i had alot of
trouble falling asleep last night. if they were spirits, i prey they rest in
peace.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and no longer am i a non-believer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Just wanted to share our experience with you. We got on your
site to find haunted places in <st1:state w:st="on">Nebraska</st1:state> and
saw the witches bridge in Weeping Water <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:state w:st="on">Nebr.</st1:state></st1:place>
and decided to check it out. At the end of March this year a group of ten of us
headed out hoping to experience something paranormal but actually figured it
was probably an urban legend and nothing would happen. Boy were we wrong! We
went to the bridge twice the first time we got on the bridge and took pictures
and video. We had two cars and our first car went across the bridge and we sat
and waited for them to get across as we were waiting I looked to my right at
the bridge and this huge flowing white thing flew up from under the bridge I said,
"oh Lord what was that?" Everyone said what and looked towards the
bridge and up the huge flowing white thing flew up again. I was so thankful
that it happened again and I was not the only one to see it. We then started to
cross the bridge just as we got to the other side of the bridge this big black
thing flew up from the ground beside my side of the van, this time my niece and
I saw it. We went on to other places but were drawn back to that bridge. A
couple of us were extremely nervous about going back. It was almost like a
feeling of doom we did not have that feeling the first time but it was very
strong the second time. Some of the people in our party (not me ) got out this
night and laid on the bridge looking through the slates in the bridge and could
see something swinging from side to side and the bridge was actually moving
slightly. We had a video camera and regular flash camera's and the video
battery went dead. They walked back to the car and turned the camera back on
and the battery had a lot of power left. We did not feel safe having someone
hanging over the bridge so instead they hooked a rope to the video camera and
sent it over the side of the bridge. That night seemed pretty uneventful, until
we got back to our room and started watching the video.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We saw this huge white orb shaped bright light that totally
covered the van crossing the bridge you could not tell that there was even a
vehicle there, this light was there until I got the van across the bridge, also
the whole section of them laying on the bridge video taping the swinging thing
underneath was just gone!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I got home and developed all the film I was awe struck.
There in the pictures was a perfect witch in several different shots and in the
corner of one of the pictures was this big headed bat or cat not sure which and
some other animal next to it. It was freaky and wonderful at the same time. We
never expected to see anything but certainly got more than we bargained for.
Thank you for your site. If you have any suggestions on where we can go that
would allow us to spend the night for a fee of course we would appreciate it.
We don't want to go with a tour would just like to go on our own. Thank you
again!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am only a 15 year old boy but i've already seen two ghosts
in my life. The one i'm writing about today is the last ghost I saw.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In November 2005, my mum and sister had gone to a neighbours
house to help out and I was left alone for about two hours in the house. I was
working on a project in my parents room on the computer and I had a strange
feeling on the back of my neck. All of a sudden I heard footsteps that sounded
like they where walking on the carpet in the hall, I ignored it and continued
working. I heard the footsteps again and started to get scared so I turned on
the radio. After I heard footsteps walking right next to the door of my parents
room where I was working and knew it was next to me because the floor is made
of wood without anything on it (carpet,rug...). Then the radio just turned off
for the first time ever without any body touching it and I felt as if someone
was there. I was so creeped out I ran downstairs shouting.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When I was born, My parents chose to give me a middle name
from a very close relative. My middle name is Christina, after my fathers
grandfather Chris. Chris was still alive when I was a child, and he spent as
many hours as he could with his namesake, mostly napping. Sometimes Grandpa
Chris would come to my house to visit and play with me. One sunday afternoon,
My mom put me into my room and told me not to come out untill it had been
cleaned. As I dilly dallied by pushing clothes under the bed, my Grandpa Chris
came in the room. Which was funny because I hadn't heard him come in. I didn't
care though because my playmate was there and now I would be freed from my
cleaning duty. Grandpa Chris sat down on the end of my little strawberry
shortcake covered bed and pulled me onto his lap. We talked about my great
grandma, about my mommy and daddy and when we were all finished talking he said
I love you sweety, take care of your mommy and daddy and behave yourself, and
walked out the door. I continued cleaning my room for what seemed to be
eternity, in reality it was only about twenty minutes. I ran into the living
room expecting to see Grandpa Chris, but he wasn't there. I asked my mommy,
Where did Grandpa go, to which she replied with a laugh that said you silly
girl, Grandpa Chris wasnt here today. As I wandered around the house looking
for him, the phone rang. It was my Grandmother, she told us that EMT's had been
trying to revive My grandpa Chris for a half hour and decided to declare him
gone. We drove the Thirty minute drive to be with her. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Still I swear up and down and up again that I physically sat
on Grandpa Chris' lap and told him that I would be a good girl, and take care
of my mommy and daddy. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I didnt even know he was dead at the time!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I Saw a Ghost</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On May 13,2005,I was sitting in my bedroom,on the
bed,reading a book.I was very distracted by the book,which I found quite
interesting.I was just about to turn a page when I heard the sound of running
water coming from the bathroom beside my room.I was curious,but payed no attention
at first,thinking it was my father or step-mother.When the noise grew louder,I
got up to investigate,annoyed.When I reached the bathroom,I saw noone in
there,but the faucet was running.I rolled my eyes,convinced that one of my
family members had been in there earlier and had forgotten to turn off the
faucet after washing thier hands.I reached out to turn it off.As I did,I felt a
gust of cold air.I drew my hand back and checked the window behind the toilet
to see if it was open.It wasn't.I shrugged it off and turned off the faucet.As
I was leaving to go back to my bedroom,the faucet turned back on.Even before
all of this happened I was the kind of person who believed in
ghosts,werewolves,demons,that kind of stuff.So at this point I was becoming uneasy.I
turned and once more turned off the faucet with a shaky hand,and once agian I
felt that cold gust of air.Something clicked in my brain;I suddenley remembered
that I had read somewhere that dogs could sense ghosts.So I rushed out of the
bathroom,whistled to my dog,and got her to come to me.I grabbed her by the
collar and attempted to drag her into the bathroom.She resisted by
whining,pulling,and even trying to bite me!I knew for sure that something
strange was going on in that room,bu I was still a very curious type of
person,so I went to look around.But as soon as I set foot in the bathroom,I got
a case of the willies that was so bad I stopped and ceased to breathe for a
moment.I had my eyes tightly shut,afraid of what I might see if I opened
them.After the chills went away,I opened my eyes.Big mistake.Standing there in
the middle of the room was an apparition that looked exactly like my best
friend,Hazel.I felt a strong urge to scream,but no sound could pass my lips,I
was so terrified!The apparition and I had a small staring contest for about a
minute.Then I heard my dog bark.That seemed to snap me out of my trance,and I
fled to the living room.I was seated on the couch for about an hour,alone exept
for my dog(my parents were in their bedroom watching TV).It was then that I
heard the phone ring.I heard my father groan and hid bed squeak as he walked to
the kitchen to pick up the phone."Hello?",I heard him ask.he was
silent for a moment,than he gasped,"That's awful!I'm so sorry,is there anything,anything
at all I can do to help?".There was more silence,then,"Of course I'll
tell her...Okay,goodbye.".I hered a 'click'as he put the phone onto the
charger.He came into the living room with a sympathetic look in his
eyes."I have to tell you something,"He started.But I
interupted,"It's about Hazel,isn't it?" I suprised myself by saying
that.I don't know how I knew,I just DID.Dad nodded and said,"She's in the
hospital,and they don't think she's going to make it...".However,Hazel did
make it out alright,though I have always wondered if the apparition I saw that
day was some sort of oman...</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: hopediane@bex.net </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There is a place on County Rd K just off the Turnpike (the
land actually butts up to the turnpike, you can easily see the house from it)
that has several ghosts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My very good
friend lived there with her family, and I spent a lot of time there, although
in the daytime!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one of her daughter's
bedrooms, there was a woman's ghost that "lives" in the closet.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She would sometimes come out and talk to the little girl,
and tell her how lonely she is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
friend heard her daughter talking to someone in the room one night, and asked
her who she was speaking to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told
her "to the lady in my closet".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Items would also be moved or disappear off the bedside table, and my
friends would even deliberately place items there to see what would
happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These items would disappear, and
be later found in the closet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend
also had a vivid dream one night about a family in a car accident, and upon
awakening, remembered the family's name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She and her daughters went to the cemetary that is visible from the
house, down the road , and asked the caretaker if he had heard of this family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said he hadn't, but invited them to walk
around and check for themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
found the Headstones of the entire family in the cemetary, when they had never
been to that cemetary before.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My friend also recounted the story of the first day she
lived in the house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She was unpacking upstairs, while her girls were at
school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She heard "Mom, I'm
home" from downstairs, and thinking that it was her daughters getting
home, she called "I'll be right there!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she walked downstairs, she kept hearing
"Mom!, MOM?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and kept
responding until she realized that her girls wouldn't be home for another
couple of hours!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She grabbed the phone
and sat on the front porch until they got home!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She also told me that one night she was sitting at the
computer when she heard singing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
she turned around, there was a little girl on the steps, singing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could see her quite clearly, although she
was slightly translucent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She didn't say
anything to her family, but several days later, she heard her own daughter
singing the same song.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she asked
her what she was singing, her little girl said "I'm singing along with the
little girl on the steps!".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
little girl on the steps was very active there!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">They all saw her numerous times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They believe she is a member of the family
that died in the car accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had
lingered a couple of days after the accident, before she died also.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Her other daughter also had the ghost of a very "scary
man" in her bedroom.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She would wake up to see him as a shadowy form, and he
really scared her.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This house was built on the property of an Indian burial
ground, and is still a working sheep farm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The sheep would act very strangely at times, acting
"spooked"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for no apparent
reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would also see forms moving
up and down the lane by the barns, back near the the pond, which is only about
100 feet from the turnpike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a
Ford truck at the bottom of the pond, although I don't know if there are any
stories behind that.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We also had a mutual friend who had slept on the couch in
the den one night.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My friend said she heard him talking to someone in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she went to investigate, she said he was
sitting upright on the couch, just conversing away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she asked him who he was talking to, he
said "these two right here, don't you see them?".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was nobody in the room with him, and
it's a really tiny room!.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another
incident was when the landlord had decided to renovate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gas stove had been disconnected and moved
to the middle of the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the middle
of the night, she and her husband awoke to a loud noise, and went downstairs to
see what it was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stove had been
moved back into place.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">They also sighted a white cat in the house numerous times,
and although they had several cats, none of them was white.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their own cats would play with it, and
sometimes seemed to be playing with it when it wasn't even visible.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">They lived in the house for a couple of years, and moved out
in 2004, so these are fairly recent events.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I haven't heard whether the new occupants have had any encounters.</p>

there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened again two<span style="">&nbsp; </span>weeks later, same thing, noone there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third time I was in the living room and
close to the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just to make sure I
had debunked all likelyhood of anything natural I checked the porch and the
roof to make sure no branches or anything could be doing this, no animals and
such, and that noone could be hiding underneath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I found that no branches were near ( we had
just had a storm and there was fallen debree)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>my cats were laying in the yard and other animals are low to the
ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lived in a wooded area and am
not subject to jump to conclusions.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
had thought someone was playing a trick on me but that proved to be false when
one of my brother's friends did knock on the door and attempt to hide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened a few days later after the
third incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was able to hear him
jump off the porch.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Upon the third incident itself, I stood outside on the porch
and quickly said the words "<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whoever<span style="">&nbsp; </span>you are, go into the light" I was not
frightened at the time, no sense of alarm, I had just heard that those words
can help who may be lost. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There are two other things worth mentioning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One: On the day that I moved out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was walking my dogs at 7:15am and was in
front of my home when I heard " <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Charlotte</st1:city></st1:place>,
don't go"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>there was a two second
pause between my name and the rest of the request.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without questioning, I headed back to my home
and put my dogs inside and stepped over to my brother's house where I woke up
my then sister-in-law by knocking on her back door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she came to the door after about four
wraps, I knew I'd awakened her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked
her if my<span style="">&nbsp; </span>nephew had hollered for me and
she said he was asleep as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to
this I had thought that maybe she had hollered at me because he had missed the
bus and she knew I would be going to the town where he went<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to school and she needed me to drop him
off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I dismissed it as just something
odd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, I was not aware of anything
paranormal, no hairs on the back of my neck sort of thing, no feeling of being
watched, just no explanation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't
think about it again until I had settled into my home in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hartford</st1:place></st1:city> later that evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember realizing that the voice I heard
sounded like a cross between my sister-in-law's and my nephew's voice.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The last thing is that there was a tv given to me by my
ex-fiance on the day I moved from his place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It had a slight inverted power button, and he warned me that the tv
might turn itself on from time to time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
turned itself on almost all the time. I would wake up at around 3:00am and have
to turn it off. Sometimes I would come home and it would be on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would also turn itself off when I was
watching a movie. Eventually I just unplugged it whenever I wasn't watching
anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After I had moved it to my
home in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hartford</st1:place></st1:city>
I noticed that I never had this problem.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At first I thought it might have been the wirin in the mobile home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But with the other things included, I really
began to wonder.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have always been interested in the paranormal and with
these incidences happening, it only sparked my curiosity,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>hope
to actually do some investigating some day.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Mom's Haunted House</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: eliteinsurance1@bellsouth.net</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">MY PARENTS PURCHASED A HOUSE BACK IN 1989.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THIS HOUSE WAS BUILT BACK IN THE LATE 40'S
.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I STILL LIVES AT HOME WHEN THEY BOUGHT
THE HOUSE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ABOUT TWO MONTHS AFTER WE
MOVED IN WE STARTED TO HAAVE WEIRD THINGS HAPPEN , FOR INSTANCE LAY YOUR CAR
KEYS ON THE TABLE GO BACK TO GET THEM AND THEY'RE GONE, SEARCH THE WHOLE HOUSE
NO KEYS AND THEN FINDS THEM RIGHT WHERE YOU LEFT THEM.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THEN WE STARTED TO HEAR THE KITCHEN DOOR OPEN
AND CLOSE AS IF SOMEONE CAME IN THE HOUSE , NO ONE WOULD EVER COME WALKING IN.
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU HEAR IT OPEN YOU SEE SOMETHING WALK THROUGH THE DINING ROOM
INTO THE BACK BEDROOM. MY MOM HAS THOUGHT MY SISTER IN LAW HAD COME HOME AND
MANY OCCASIONS AND CALL FOR HER AND GET NO ANSWER, SHE WOULD GET UP AND GO
THROUGH TO THE BEDROOM WHERE SHE JUST SAW HER WALK BY AND NOONE WOULD BE THERE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THIS HAPPENS ALOT. SEVERAL PEOPLE , MY
BROTHERS FRIENDS WHO HAVE SPENT THE NIGHT HAVE REPORTED SEEING AN OLD WOMAN IN
THE KITCHEN AT NIGHT AFTER EVERYONE IS IN BED.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>THERE ARE LOTS OF STRANGE THINGS HERE. I NO LONGER LIVE AT HOME, HAVEN'T
FOR 15 YRS NOW. EVERYTIME I GO TO VISIT I ALWAYS GET A PRANK FROM MRS.
RICHARDS. (THATS WHAT WE'E NAMED HER) DUE TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS THE NAME OF
THE FAMILY THAT ORIGINALLY BUILT THE HOUSE. WE HAVE SPOKEN TO HER GRANDSON AND
HE SAYS NO ONE HAS EVER DIED IN THE HOUSE. I WAS HOME LAST FEBRUARY AND HAD
TAKEN A PICTURE OF MY MOM IN THE LIVING ROOM WITH A DIGITAL CAMERA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I WAS GOING THROUGH THE PHOTOS TO PRINT AND
NOTICED A WHITE MIST AS IF IT WERE WRAPPED AROUND MY MOM.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>UPON ENLARGING THE PHOTO IT HAS MANY
DIFFERENT FACES IN THE MIST.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I GET
CREEPED OUT TO SEE THAT PICTURE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>MY MOM
CAME TO VISIT ME FOR THANKSGIVING A FEW YEARS AGO MY BROTHER AND HIS WIFE WERE
AT MY MOTHERS WHILE SHE WAS AWAY.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THAY
WOKE UP ON SUNDAY MORNING AROUND 10:00 AM AND FOUND THE COFFEE POT WITH HOT
COFFEE AND THE PECAN PIE FROM THE FRIDGE SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DINING
ROOM TABLE. (NO ONE THERE BUT THEM ALL WEEKEND) THAY DON'T EITHER ONE DRINK
COFFEE. MY BROTHER CALLED MY MOM AND TOLD HERE WHAT HAPPENED AND THAT THEY LEFT
THE HOUSE IMMEDIATELY AND HE WON'T BE BACK UNTIL SOMEONE ELSE IS THERE.
SOMETIMES THE PHONE WILL RING AND NOONE IS ON THE LINE. THE HOUSE HAS CARPET ON
THE FLOORS WITH OLD HARDWOOD UNDERNEATH. THERE ARE MANY TIMES THAT YOU ARE
THERE ALONE AND HEAR FOOTSTEPS ON HARDWOOD. THERE IS A SMALL LINEN CLOSET IN
THE MIDDLE BEDROOM THAT EVERYONE IS REALLY SCARED OF EXCEPT MY MOM. SOMETIMES
YOU FIND THINGS IN THERE THAT GO MISSING AND YOU KNOW NOONE HAS BEEN IN THERE
TO PUT IT THERE. MY BROTHER SLEPT IN THAT ROOM AS A 10-11 YR OLD AND ONE NIGHT
HE CAME RUNNING OUT AND WOULD NEVER SLEEP THERE AGAIN, HE WOULD SLEEP IN THE
FLOOR OF MY PARENTS ROOM OR ON THE SOFA. HE WOULD NOT TELL WHAT HAPPENED. NOW
28 HE TELLS US THAT A MAN GOT AHOLD OF HIS FEET AND TRIED TO PULL HIM OUT OF
BED AND TOLD HIM COME WITH ME. HE SAYS HE WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL LOOKING MAN WITH
PRETTY BLUE EYES, BUT HE COULD SENSE THAT HE WAS EVIL. MY BROTHER EVEN NOW WILL
RUN THROUGH THAT BEDROOM. I FEEL THAT THERE ARE ALOT OF DIFFERENT SPIRITS IN
THAT HOUSE, BUT NONE ARE THERE TO HARM ANYONE. WE ALL GET A KICK OUT OF JOKING
THAT MRS RICHARDS IS GONNA GET YOU.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>MY
BROTHERS YOUNGEST SON ALWAYS SAID THERE WAS A MAN IN<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THAT BEDROOM FROM THE TIME HE WAS ABLE TO
SPEAK. WHEN YOU WOULD ASK HIM WHERE THE MAN IS HE WOULD POINT TO THE MIDDLE BEDROOM.
HE IS NOW 5 AND HE STILL SAYS THERE IS A MAN IN THAT ROOM. I GUESS HE CAN SEE
HIM. WHEN WE DO ANY CHANGES SUCH AS REPAIR A FLOOR, CHANGE CARPET, BATHUB
FAUCET OR ANYTHING TO CHANGE THE HOUSE THE ACTIVITY GETS REALLY STRONG FOR A
FEW MONTHS AND THEN IT WILL DIE DOWN AGAIN. THESE ARE NOT EVERYDAY HAUNTINGS,
BUT THE DO HAPPEN ON A REGULAR BASIS. NOTHING SURPRISES ANYONE IN OUR FAMILY
ANYMORE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I CAN EMAIL THE PICTURE OF MY
MOM IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT. THANKS FOR LISTENING I KNOW THIS WAS VERY
LONG. WITH ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED THERE IN THAT HOUSE I COULD GO ON FOR DAYS ON
END.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>MY MOTHER SAYS THAT WHATEVER IS
THERE IS HER PROTECTOR, I DON;T THINK SO</p>
