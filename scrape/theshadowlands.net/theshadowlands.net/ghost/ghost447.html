<big><big>The Faceless <br>
<br>
By: swoo2@cox.net <br>
<br>
<br>
I have posted before, but I&#8217;ve decided to post another. I wanted to
share with all another one of my experiences. This one is the most
vivid of them all. This happen when I was young, about I&#8217;m guessing
eleven or twelve years old. I was on a family vacation in Northern part
of Arizona, where it was cooler, with more trees and mountains.
Anyways, we were spending time camping around one night, and I decided
to wander off on my own. I always like to wander off alone because I
was a wild child that seeks adventure in the great wide somewhere. My
parents forbidden me not to, but they were asleep so they wouldn&#8217;t
know. <br>
It was about 12:00 AM more or less when I saw the strangest thing while
wandering around the tree filled area. It was unlike anything I had
ever seen. Even till this day I could still remember the encounter.
What I saw was something solid but yet still transparent, what I felt
was something friendly yet still angry, what I smelt was something
lovely but decaying, what I heard was something beautiful like a the
sound of a harp, but yet at the same time something like a creepy old
pipe organ. It was just too confusing. <br>
When I first saw this, it had there back to me. What I saw was a lady
for sure, with hair of gold, whom wore a red gown. A gown as red as
blood, a red that I can&#8217;t truly describe because it will still
transparent. She also wore black gloves, black as coal, and black boots
too. From the back, she look so lovely, so beautiful, so perfect, I
though what I was feeling at that moment was love! But the moment she
turned around, I nearly took a dump in my pants, love changed to fear
in matter of seconds. This lady had no face! She looked like a faceless
witch! I&#8217;m pretty sure she probably is one. After she turn around she
started to walk towards me, and started to sing &#8220;give me back my face&#8221;,
over and over, as if those where her only words that she knew. Her
voice was so angelic, but I just turned around and ran. I ran fast that
night, faster than ever before, I swear, I wouldn&#8217;t even have a shadow
from the speed I ran. I just closed my eyes, and ran. I yelled too, but
when I opened my eyes I notice I never moved. I was still at the very
same spot where I was. And there she stood, right in front of me&#8230; my
head was up to her chest at the moment, and all I saw was her necklace,
it was some kind of gold chain with a triangle shape charm with a glass
or clear crystal, diamond like center. But anyways, she continued to
sing &#8220;give me back my face&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t know what to do, and just stated
I don&#8217;t have your face, and before you knew it, she started yelling, it
was frightening yelling, she was yelling &#8220;GIVE ME BACK MY FACE!&#8221; And so
I turned around and ran again&#8230; and the same thing happened, I didn&#8217;t go
nowhere.. But this time, there was no faceless lady standing by me. All
that was left was a dusty, scratched infested ring on the floor that I
had not notice before, it was silver but strong, and had 3 holes around
the inner sided of the ring, spread evenly. I still have that ring too.
This has gotten too long! I must end here! Thank you for reading!<br>

Tecumseh<br>
<br>
<br>
By: kastanis_john@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
I have lived in tecumseh almost my entire life and I run a paranormal
investigation company out of tecumseh now.&nbsp; Years ago I
experienced the most vivd paranormal encounter of my life while moving
som stuff up into a friends attic.&nbsp; He lived in a loft above a
restaurant in town that used to be a funeral home.&nbsp; The loft and
attic area had been used to store coffins for purchase.&nbsp; INside
the attic you feel constantly as if you are being watch and can see
images on the wall, obviously man made, of villagers chasing the devil
as well as writing that say "W.S. killed J.W." followed by the date of
the insident, which i dont remember.&nbsp; There is also what appears
to be old dried up blood smeared on the walls.&nbsp; Well, the personal
experience for me happened when i had finished helping my friend move
and was walking down the stairs to the loft area.&nbsp; ABout midway
down the stairs something shoved me to the side as if I had been pushed
out of the way by someone walking up the stairs.&nbsp; My friend was
already down the stairs when this had happened and i was the only
person on the staircase at the time.&nbsp; thats my story.<br>

The Boss will Make Sure It's Done Right<br>
<br>
By: LAXDispatch@amadotrucking.com<br>
<br>
I worked in a high rise for 9 and 1/2 years.&nbsp; This high rise is
right on the Grand Prix track when the Grand Prix is in town.&nbsp; I
was working there about 5 and 1/2 years when one of my bosses pasted
away.&nbsp; Well while she was alive she made sure that the building
was secure during the grand prix and the system she put in place was
flawless.&nbsp; About 6 months after the grand Prix she passed, her
name was Pat.&nbsp; When the Grand prix was coming back around we kept
in place all the procedures that she had established threw the
years.&nbsp; The week of the Grand Prix I was sitting in my office and
the office had a window that looked into the loby and the
outside.&nbsp; I noticed a women that had a walkie talkie and was
looking down at the track.&nbsp; I thought odd.&nbsp; She turned around
and this women looked like Pat.&nbsp; This can't be her.&nbsp; I
noticed that this woman was heading for the pool area so I left the
office to follow her.&nbsp; She was gone.&nbsp; I searched the area
there was no one.&nbsp; I returned to the office and waited until my
boss to come down and I told him what I had seen.&nbsp; He smiled and
said that was probably Pat making sure you did every thing right.&nbsp;
I never saw her again.<br>

Another University of Calgary haunting story<br>
<br>
By: doggy_dare@hotmail.com <br>
<br>
Hi, I was browsing your site today and came across the following page: http://theshadowlands.net/ghost/ghost311.html<br>
I've been looking for info on hauntings at the University of Calgary
residences and this is one of the few stories I've come across.<br>
I stayed in the University of Calgary residences for a church youth
camp for a week in August 2003, when I was 14 years old. The university
hosts a lot of camps and sessions of this sort. I was in Kananaskis
Hall, which I believe is usually used as the girls dorm. I stayed on
the third floor - I don't remember the room number. It was the last
room on the left hand side of the hallway, in the lefthand hall if you
were entering through the stairwell. Since it was the last room in the
hallway, one wall was just painted cinderblocks, not drywall. As
described in the other University of Calgary story submitted, there are
two closets set into the wall on either side of the door and there is
generally two beds, two desks, and two chairs. My room lacked the
second desk and chair.<br>
I shared the room with another youth camp participant for the week. One
of the first things we encountered about the room was the door's
ability to open and close by itself. Kananaskis Hall is not a new
building by any standards. The doors on the rooms across the hall from
us swung naturally inwards when left open and the doors on our side
naturally swung out into the halls because of the slant of the
building. However, our door did not behave as it should have, given the
physics of gravity: left unshut, it would swing back and forth at an
increasing pace until my roommate and I would either shut the door or
jokingly ask it to stop. Once when I was in the room alone during the
day, I was reading on the bed and fell asleep. I very distinctly
remember closing the door. The residence doors are by no means light -
they are quite thick and heavy with fiddly locks. I woke up to the door
opening with no one visibly there to open it. It freaked me out pretty
good and I made it a point to try to never be alone in the room.<br>
The one chair in the room was right of the foot of the bed I slept in.
It was probably about 30 years old and was one of those old square
cushioned ones with the armrests and gross plaid upholstery. My mother
attended the university in the 70's and she commented that the decor of
the dorms had not been changed since she went to school there. When you
sat in the chair, you would leave a butt impression in it that would
eventually fade. Every night of the week I stayed in that room I would
awaken, convinced that there was someone sitting in it. I was pretty
sure I was just psyching myself out, being away from home and whatnot,
but on our last day my roommate confided in me that she would awaken
with the same sensation. Every day, without fail, there would be an
impression in the chair when we got up. <br>
We agreed that it was dumb, we were just jittery teenage girls. I went
back to school in the fall and told one of my friends that I had stayed
in the dorms at the U of C. My friend participated in a lot of math and
science camps and had attended one at the U of C that summer as well.
She retailed to me the story of one of her own friends that also went
to camp - apparently her friend had stayed in a haunted room at
Kananaskis Hall. She gave the details of the haunting and they mimicked
my own experiences completely. I asked if it was the room at the end of
the lefthand hall on the third floor and it was indeed the same room. I
asked my mother about the hall and she claims there was a girl who hung
herself in a closet in her dorm room in the 70's, but this is the same
story usually given when you hear about residence hall hauntings.
Kananaskis Hall has been a girl's dorm for a while, but when I talked
it over with my roommate we both felt that whatever was in our room at
night had a distinctly male presence. Perhaps it was a pervert ghost
who would rather watch young women sleep than young men?<br>

Mom Checking on Her Baby<br>
<br>
By: gary_r_mason@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
Well, I was 17 at the time and living in South Jersey. I spend much of
my time in the evenings and weekends babysitting. At this time, I had
been babysitting a couple's 3 kids, and the youngest was still in a
crib.<br>
The Mom of the 3 suddently passed away of a cerebral hemmorhage,
leaving the Dad with much to do to say the least. The week after the
funeral, he called and asked me to watch the kids for him one 1970
Friday evening. <br>
I got the kids settled and proceeded downstairs, turned on the TV, and
was sitting on the sofa watching it when I heard a noise upstairs. So I
slipped up the stairs and peeked in the baby's room. There, I couldn't
believe what I saw. The Mom was standing next to the crib, looking in
on her baby girl. As clear as day, if I hadn't seen it with my own
eyes, I would not believe this story myself! She turned to me, with a
blank look on her face not frowning or smiling, turned around toward
the closet and walked right through the door!<br>
To say the least, my Mom had to spend the rest of the evening with me,
and she had to be the one to go up and open that closet door, I sure
wasn't going to!<br>
I continued to babysit those kids throughout the summer, but never had
another "visit" from their Mom, although I was finally able to share it
with her husband.<br>
Since I had that experience myself, I am a firm believer of those types of "visits" that's for sure!<br>

Haunted Places in Michigan<br>
<br>
By: skeletorsnail@yahoo.com<br>
I've checked out one of the places on your list, and I can recount my experience for you.<br>
In Livonia, the little cemetery at 5 mile and Farmington.<br>
Last summer a friend of mine decided to gather a couple of our friends
together to go check out this haunt. The cemetery is located across
from Livonias city hall and police station, I live within 2 miles from
it. The cemetery itself is open to the public with a small fence around
it but open gates every hundred feet or so. Yet, I doubt the police
will be thrilled about people hanging out in the cemetery in the middle
of the night, if they take notice. So a somewhat low profile is
necessary if your checking it out. I'm sure if you have a camera and
claim your just taking some photographs of the cemetery at night, you
can easily talk yourself out of any confrontation without any
reprimand. Anyways, the road is normally busy, and depending on what
day it is may be low to medium traffic at that time of night. Either
way, my friends and I went out on a weeknight, and the roads were all
relatively empty. We parked our two cars in a parking lot around the
block and walked a short distance to the cemetery itself. Two of my
friends stepped just inside the gates and stayed relatively in the
light, the area is fairly well lit with streetlamps. A couple of our
other friends walked to a place about midway through the cemetery and
took up point there. My friend who planned the trip and I headed all
the way to the back of the cemetery and took up places near the back
fence where we could survey the whole cemetery from. The cemetery is
pretty shallow in depth and only about three times as long in length
perpendicular to the road, in all an easy space to watch the entirety
of. <br>
So we took up places by about 11:45 and the road was completely free of
traffic. Everyone waited and watched until about 12:10 and there were
no signs of any ghosts. In all some people claimed to have had creepy
feelings, which is normal for being in a cemetery at night I suppose,
but no activity that night. After that we hung out in the cemetery
until about 12:30 when we decided to head out. In all, no ghost dad and
three girls (we originally heard it was two girls with the dad,) but
who knows.. The timing might not have been right, or any other numbers
of factors.<br>
On another note, <br>
In Redford, St Agatha School closed down for quite a long time, and has
recently opened as an elementary school I believe called "David Ellis
Academy West". It appears to be getting horrible reviews and may be
closing down again within the next few years. Anyways, all the kids I
knew who went there while growing up have all claimed it was haunted
and extremely creepy. Many of them say all the real activity would go
on at night though when there were no witnesses. Anyways, that's all I
know about that.<br>

Manchester Hauntings<br>
<br>
By: buchanan6@cox.net<br>
<br>
I have lived in Manchester for most of my life, at least 30
years.&nbsp; Though you only have one listing for Manchester there are
many more spirited places there.&nbsp; I have lived in various
different houses in a particular side of Town, that I now is
spirited.&nbsp; <br>
There is a home that When I was a child I lived there with my Mom and
brother on the second floor.&nbsp; My bedroom was the corner room that
over looked the intersection.&nbsp; The two walls facing the street
were all windows, that has since been made into solid walls.&nbsp; Most
nights I would would hear someone knocking on the windows, as if
someone were walking by and knocking as they walked.&nbsp; There was a
tree on the corner but it is not near the house nad the branches of the
tree did not come close to the windows or the house.&nbsp; My Mom would
tell me it was the branches, it was not.&nbsp; Every night was
dreadfull because we knew they would come back.&nbsp; Some nights&nbsp;
my brother and I would sleep in the bath tub, it seemd the safest
place.&nbsp; Every night I would hear someone walking up and down the
stairs from the second floor and the third floor no one lived upstairs
and the staircase was located between my room and my Moms room.&nbsp;
The staircase was closed off by a wall at the top, and was used as my
closet.&nbsp; On various occasions my Mom and I would be watching TV in
the living room and a shadow of what looked like a man would walk
between the windows.&nbsp; I would be most afraid at night.&nbsp;
Things would disapear and reapear making you think you are loosing your
mind.&nbsp; Next door was a Catering business and in the basement there
was a tunnel that connected our house and the catering business.&nbsp;
It was really creepy down there, with cold spots and moving
shadows.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accross the street, I was told used to be the
police station.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
I have lived in two houses next to each other.&nbsp; In the first of
the two I lived in, the attic door was in my bedroom closet.&nbsp; I
would see it moving and hear growning noises like someone was locked it
the attic.&nbsp; If you stood at my bedroom door I could hear the
washer and dryer going as if it were out side my door running it was
very loud.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I opened my door to listen it would stop, I
was not doing laundry at these times.&nbsp; In the basement on the
wooden door that goes to the hatchway there were claw makrs on it, as
if someone was locked in their and tried to claw there way
out.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bathroom sink would turn on by itself and
sometimes you could hear someone going to the bathroom when no one was
there.&nbsp; Other times you could hear the toilet flush, when I 'd go
upstairs to see who it was no one was there.&nbsp; Many times I saw a
man walking around out side&nbsp; and inside the house.&nbsp; I believe
he was the previous owner.&nbsp; Everyone knew him as POPs.<br>
In the second house, next door there were happenings as well.&nbsp; One
day I came home and was standing in the kitchen and heard the TV on in
my daughters room down the hall. I would start walking down the hall to
go trun it off and it would stop.&nbsp; Then I would hear the TV on in
the living room.&nbsp; I turned to walk back down the hall to the
living room and it would be off, and again would hear it on in my
daughters room again.&nbsp; After a few more times I got&nbsp;
irritated and just yell to "Knock it off, Stop turning the TV's on" and
it would stop.&nbsp; Sometimes at night I could see swirling clouds
what would resembe lightening on my ceiling as if a storm were brewing
and hear rumbling noises like thinder.&nbsp; Then the voices would come
in whispering tones.&nbsp; It seemed like it lasted for hours but from
the time it started to when it ended it would have been an hour.<br>
As far back as I can remember I have felt and seen things.&nbsp; These
are just a few of the spirited happenings and places where they took
place in Manchester.&nbsp;&nbsp; Manchester has a rich history of the
Cheeney family and the silk mills.&nbsp; I also believe that there was
Indian tribes in this area as well as burial grounds.&nbsp; It is a
high energy and spirited place.&nbsp; It has also been a long time
since I have spoken about it.<br>

Our Haunted House<br>
<br>
<br>
By: basillady62@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I didn't know about your site until today and it dawned on me that I
have a haunted house and have a fun story to tell about it. We have
some renters moving out of it this week so you are welcome to stop by
and see it anytime after July 7th. 925 Mercer St. Boise Idaho off 37th
and state St. <br>
OK , Our house isn't scary haunted like s lot of the places on your web
site but I thought I would share our story regardless. This house was
built by "old man Hoffman" with his own hands in about 1952. There is a
large "H" in brick outside on the chimney. We bought this house in
April 1990 our daughter was born inside the house October 1990. Which
maybe started something. In the 10 years we lived there Strange and
unexplained things happened. Both of my daughters saw a figure of an
old lady a few times. One time this figure was floating above one of my
daughters. My son son a dark figure at the front door inside the house
when he was 3. I instantly grabbed a knife and went to the door (which
was locked) I carefully opened the door waiting to protect my family,
nothing was there. Awhile before our oldest daughter had a preteen
birthday party our Neighbor from across the street told me of the story
of how Old man Hoffman died in his house of a heart attack sitting at
his kitchen table. Well, after telling my husband what I had heard, my
husband couldn't help but teasingly tell the girls a dramatic version
of the demise of Old Man Hoffman. As he said the words in a very scary
manner how old man Hoffman died and was ending in, "and all of a sudden
right here on this very table (this was not the same exact table) he
was DEAD!" with the words "DEAD" Our lights went out the girls screamed
as someone said that we turned the lights out to scare them. they
stopped screaming. We said we did not.. How could we, standing here in
front of all of you? The screaming started up again. So we investigated
and called the power company. There was no wind that night as a branch
had fallen on a line that knocked out our power at that precise moment
and the power of the old rock house behind our house. Story I heard
after this incident after telling my neighbor what happened was that
Old Man Hoffman loved to play practical jokes on the kids. He would
hide behind trees and toss firecrackers at the kids feet and laugh so
hard at their fear. I wondered if he had that night. Our daughter is
now 26 and when I talk to her and her friends they still remember that
night and tell me the house is haunted. I also have a friend that is
sensitive to the para normal who I never told these things to. When she
came over to our house she asked me if we have any ghost in the house
because she saw an old lady busy in the kitchen. She said the figure
was faint but she could tell it was an old lady cooking and she looked
very happy. I just assumed it was Lady Hoffman.<br>
Not so scary but true accounts. I haven't been inside this house for 5 or more years so I am curious of the feeling I will get.<br>

Regarding Lizzie Bordens House<br>
By: daydreamer1239@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I had the pleasure of staying at the Lizzie Bordens house while it was
owned by its previous owners. My mom surprized me for my birthday by
renting Lizzie and her sister's room which are connected. My friend and
her mom joined us on this trip. We took the tour that night of the
whole house and it has one of the most terrifying auras. When it hits
night at this house you can feel just anger. It is a scary feeling.
While we were on the tour many couples tried to use cameras and video
cameras, with no luck. No cameras or anything electronic was working no
matter how many times they would change the batteries. During the night
when I got up to use the bathroom. I heard giggles coming from the
bottom of the stairs. The stairs that I had to cross to get from my
room to the bathroom. The bathroom was right by the guest bedroom where
Mrs. Borden was killed. There was also a guest book to sign and as I
went to sign it in the morning I got curious and began to read some
past enteries. It seemed other people had also had trouble with
electronics and some staff had heard giggles on their radios when no
one was in the house. I can tell you for a fact that house is haunted.<br>

Rockford, IL - Twin Sisters Park<br>
<br>
By: mattbaer@comcast.net <br>
<br>
It&#8217;s weird that I found Twin Sisters park woods to be considered
haunted because that&#8217;s the only place that I&#8217;ve ever been that I saw,
without a shadow of a doubt, something that I considered to be
supernatural.&nbsp; <br>
My friend, Brendan, used to live just a few blocks north of Twin
Sisters and we would often go up to the park to smoke cigarettes
because we were around 15 at the time.&nbsp; Brendan and I had gone
down there one night (between 2 and 4 AM) and we were just messing
around outside of the shadows of the hills (the &#8220;Twin Sisters&#8221; are
actually two large hills that are almost identical in every
aspect.&nbsp; There is a storage garage just south of the hills that
has a really bright light that casts shadows of the hills a good
distance beyond the hills.&nbsp; When you&#8217;re standing there, because
the light is so bright, you literally can&#8217;t see anything in those
shadows, it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re staring at a big black blank
chalkboard.)&nbsp; Anyway, since this is a spooky situation, we had to
see who had the fortitude to walk into the shadows.&nbsp; I was first
to walk into them and once my eyes adjusted it really wasn&#8217;t that
bad.&nbsp; He followed and we were there for maybe 30 seconds or so and
proceeded to walk through the rest of the park.&nbsp; We got about 50
feet or so outside of the shadows and we heard rustling in the
woods.&nbsp; Being freaked out, we investigated.&nbsp; We weren&#8217;t even
close to the woods yet when a black dog came running out, playfully,
but still it spooked us (don&#8217;t worry, that isn&#8217;t the spooky
part).&nbsp; The dog wouldn&#8217;t come over to us so we started walking
away, looking back every few seconds to make sure the dog wasn&#8217;t
following us.&nbsp; At one point we both looked back and the dog had
run in to the shadows and no more than 2 seconds after the dog ran in
to the shadows, a full grown man came running out of the shadows after
us.&nbsp; Mind you, we were in the park, alone, and had just come out
of the shadows where no living creature had been no more than 3 minutes
before we headed on our way.&nbsp; He was a good distance back so we
just thought, &#8220;OK, a man running in the park at 3 AM&#8230;weird but sure,
why not&#8221;.&nbsp; We just sat there for a moment and see where he was
going, but he just kept a straight line for us.&nbsp; We started
walking quickly the opposite direction, he kept running at us.&nbsp; We
then started sprinting away from this man but he was gaining on us way
too fast for a couple of football and basketball players.&nbsp; At one
point, we looked back and he was still running, nothing else moving
around him, and then we looked back again and it was the dog
again.&nbsp; We kept running but finally got out of breath and I
remembered that I saw on TV somewhere that if you stop running, the dog
will stop chasing you because it thinks you&#8217;re playing.&nbsp; So we
stopped and the dog turned and started walking off to our left.&nbsp; <br>
I, to this day, can&#8217;t figure out how it happened.&nbsp; There was
nothing in the shadows that was alive, once we were in there, we could
see very well.&nbsp; The dog ran in, a man ran out, then out of nowhere
it was the dog again.&nbsp; I know people imagine strange things but I
know what I saw and it wasn&#8217;t something that I had ever seen before,
have seen since then, or probably will ever see again.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve
honestly never been that scared in my life.&nbsp; <br>
Anyway, that&#8217;s my experience in the same area.&nbsp; I never knew it was considered haunted until now.<br>

St. Gertrude<br>
<br>
By: dmcjr@wowway.com <br>
<br>
Ive had a paranormal experience at St. Gertruds Bible class building in
St. Clair Shores. I was volunteering there one night in 2007. There
were a couple people in the building at the time. It was just before
classes started around 6 p.m. all teachers were in the church with
students. I was given the job to pass out papers to all the classrooms
upstairs. I had heard it was haunted and I have to admit im not a
skeptic. Anyways, I went upstairs to do my job. All the lights were off
and for some strange reason i didnt turn them on. I wasn't thinking
about the claims. I was just thinking about finishing my job. I passed
out the papers to a few classrooms when I heard a sound at the end of
the hall. It startled me, then i heard it again. It sounded like chairs
moving. In the next couple of minutes I heard footsteps and a weird
noise that resembled writing on a chalkboard. By then I was overly
creeped out so I fled downstairs. I told somemone what had happened and
they agreed to go upstairs with me. We went up their and the light was
on in the room at the end of the hall. That was the only light on up
there. No one was in the room.&nbsp; <br>

The Blair-Amis House in Fort Smith<br>
<br>
By: ContactLarryCox@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I renovated the Blair-Amis in the Belle Grove Historical District of
Fort Smith during the early years of this century.&nbsp; The house was
built as a Christmas present by banker William Blair for his wife,
Mary, in 1895.&nbsp; William died in 1903, and the house was sold to
Dr. John Amis.&nbsp; Dr. Amis, his wife, Jane, and five of their
children lived and died in this house during the next 67 years.&nbsp;
As each member of the family died, his or her funeral would be staged
in the front parlor.&nbsp; Shortly after I purchased the house, workmen
were tuckpointing the exterior and one asked who the old woman was who
kept peeking at them through the lace curtains in one of the upstairs
bedrooms.&nbsp; The aroma of cigar smoke could occasionally be smelled
in the back parlor, lights would go on and off, and pocket doors closed
at night, would mysteriously be open the next morning.&nbsp; The family
cat refused to use the back stairway where on more than one time the
rustle of petticoats would be faintly heard.&nbsp; The sound of a woman
crying could sometimes be heard in one of the rear bedrooms and foot
steps in the front entryway.&nbsp; More than once, the rattle of tea
cups could be heard in the kitchen.&nbsp; Although I have lived in
several Victorian houses, this was -- without a doubt -- one of the
most haunted I've ever been associated with.&nbsp; It sits vacant it is
never-the-less strangely occupied.&nbsp; <br>

True Haunting Story<br>
<br>
By: imastatistic@cox.net <br>

Hi, I live in Connecticut, and the story I'd like to share with you I firmly believe to be true.<br>
Over 10 years ago, my ex-husband and I were at the Nike missile site in
Glastonbury, CT. We were out cycling very late on a warm and humid
summer night. We were in the area of the site, and my ex-husband
suggested riding up the hill to the site to stop, drink our water and
catch our breath before heading home.<br>
At that time there were no houses within a close distance to the top of
the hill, nor were there many trails going through the thick woods. He
was very familiar with the area and the history behind the Nike missile
sites. Only the barracks remained and behind them was a baseball
diamond. The baseball diamond is where we were.<br>
We began to hear what sounded like kids in the woods; either partying
or lost. We kept looking into the woods expecting to see flashlights or
any kind of light, assuming that if someone were to be in those dense
woods at that hour of the night, they would be smart enough to have
something to light their way. The talking and laughing voices and the
footsteps danced around and at one point we were considering leaving
because we didn't want to be discovered. The sounds never grew very
close, and I distinctly remember saying to my ex-husband, "Why don't
they have flashlights?" "I hope they find their way out." As the sounds
began to diminish, we left.<br>
I have lived in this area of Connecticut all my life, and like my
ex-husband, I am very familiar with the wooded areas of Glastonbury and
Manchester. Unless you are either completely unprepared for a jaunt in
the woods at night or you're just plain stupid, you don't enter the
wooded areas surrounding the Manchester/Glastonbury town line at night.
<br>
What I read in your documentation of this area on your website is
exactly what we experienced. This site is located in an area of town
where the locals don't go wandering into the woods at night. It's too
thick, too dense, and way too easily to get lost.&nbsp; Thanks for
reading this, and I hope you'll add it to your pages of stories!<br>

Two Out of Nine<br>
<br>

I believe!&nbsp; When my sweet kitty of nineteen passed on, not only I
but my son, who was the one who found her gone, had a hard time letting
go.&nbsp; She was my loyal companion and when my son was born, she
would lay just out of reach to entice him to crawl.&nbsp; When he
started to walk, she would do the same thing.&nbsp; We both loved her
dearly.&nbsp; The night I buried her, and I might add,in a haunted
place of its own(Hell Hallow), to keep the little spirit girl
company,on the way back, through the mist that had started to cover the
pond and low ground, a large White cat(same color as my saffy) bolted
out of the mist and stopped dead in the beam of the headlights, staring
at me and then, just melted away.&nbsp; I knew then she was on her way
to another life,&nbsp; For three days, my son would wake and tell me
that Saffy had come at night, hopped up on his bed and curled up at his
feet as she always did.&nbsp; I attributed this to his grief and tried
as best I knew how to explain&nbsp; death and the passing on to
him.&nbsp; He never swayed from his story.&nbsp; Then, after the third
night, there came a knock on my door.&nbsp; To our great surprise,and
joy,&nbsp; a friend of mine was holding a small White Kitten in her
hand.&nbsp; As she put the kitten down, it circled half way around my
rug and lay right on my feet and stretched out to sleep.&nbsp; We were
over joyed, though the eyes were yellow and not blue, we knew right
then and there,&nbsp; our beloved Saffy was home.&nbsp; CottonBall
(CB)&nbsp; has been a joy to us,she has done the exact same things as
Saffy did, with helping my second son learn to crawl and walk, she
jumps on the window ledge to come in and when I make the mistake of
calling her the wrong name, she reminds me who she is, by nibbling my
toes.&nbsp; No dout in our minds, our wonderful, loving cat is back, to
share our lives, as long as we live.&nbsp; <br>

USS Saipan (UNCLASSIFIED)<br>
<br>
By: michael.orbe@us.army.mil <br>

<br>
I Have read the Story of the USS Saipan from another user. I have also
placed in the Haunted places about the v-Deck in the USS Saipan. I'm
trying to find any stories and any facts as I can about that Vessel.<br>
Well here is my story of the V-deck experience which I might add that this has been my only Paranormal Experience to date. <br>
I was in the Marines stationed on the USS Saipan from June 2000 - Dec
2000. It was late one night and I had pulled Watch in the V-deck in the
early morning hours. The V-deck is a place for the Storing Conex Boxes
and Vehicles of all types from Hum-vee's to Tanks. The V-Deck and you
can tell by its name is the very belly of the ship. In this case it was
only Humm-Vee's and Conex Boxes. To give you an Idea how the lay out
was You walk down a steep ramp that is meant for driving vehicles up
and down. Once at the bottom of the Ramp you have a clear walk way to
the back of the storage area and on the Left and Right Vehicles nothing
but vehicles packed to tight you can barely walk or maneuver through
them.<br>
Like one huge carefully packed accident. Now I would walk down the
Clear path and make sure that there was nothing out of place or any one
down in the area trying to tamper with things. It was Early in the
morning about 2-3am or so. Light Out was still in effect. Their was a
light but it was a faint light several small lights dimly illuminated
the bottom of the ship. So then As I was walking I verified that there
was no one there I was alone. Then I Placed my head down for a Sec. I
think I was reading a magazine or something. And Then I saw it in the
corner of my eye. A very bright flash of light like a photo flash. I
walked over to the area to see who it was. I honestly though some one
had taken a picture of me down there. But as I walked over I Saw no
one. So I tried to investigate what might have caused such a bright
flash. For the rest of my shift I could not find out why. There was no
Bright lights allowed during lights out. There was no way that a bright
light could reflect on any of the Mirrors because all the mirrors were
folded in. Plus some one would have to had to walk down into the V-deck
into the Ramp which is the only reasonable way down except for a long
ladder on the way down.<br>
So if any entered the V-deck I would have certainly seen it.</big></big><br>
