Dad?<br>
<br>
By: philbert_7@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
It's been a few years since I've added any new experiences.&nbsp; The
last thing I recall writing about were whispers heard around my
home.&nbsp; Since then, my father passed away from cancer and his
spirit may be responsible for some strange happenings.&nbsp; My father
passed away in early May 2003, and that summer I had a vivid
dream.&nbsp; It was Sunday, July 20th and I had worked very early that
morning.&nbsp; I worked at the Gap and we had to rearrange the clothing
stock and add new items to the shelves.&nbsp; It took about 4 hours and
I arrived back at home around 10 30 AM.&nbsp; I was exhausted due to
waking up so early so I drew the blinds and took a nap.&nbsp;
Immediately after falling asleep I dreamt that I was sitting on my
father's bed in his home in London, Ontario.&nbsp; There was a knock on
the door and I got up to open it and standing in front of me was my
father wearing his dark blue pyjamas (that he died in).&nbsp; He looked
luminous and healthy and he was smiling.&nbsp; I hugged him and could
feel his warmth, never wanting to let go.&nbsp; I looked up at him and
asked, "where are you going?" and he replied "I don't know yet, I have
some things to take care of."&nbsp; I asked him if there was a God and
he replied, "I don't know that yet, but will find out soon".&nbsp; ust
then my mother woke me up because she heard me crying.&nbsp; When I
awoke, my eyes shot open and I had no idea where I was.&nbsp; I shot
upright crying hysterically, asking "where did he go? where is he?" My
mom was so confused and tried to console me but I was so upset because
it seemed such a real encounter.&nbsp; I stayed in my room for the rest
of the day because I felt he was there with me still; I felt that if I
left I would abandon him.&nbsp; It sounds strange, and it may well have
been just a dream because his death had just occurred two months before
and I was grieving heavily.&nbsp; I like to believe that it was him
trying to say goodbye.&nbsp; I haven't had any other dreams like this,
although I have dreamt of my father; mainly he will appear randomly in
dreams that have nothing to do with anything.<br>
The second thing that happened was very frightening to me.&nbsp; This
occured last April, around Easter time.&nbsp; I had a terrible cold and
was home from school for Easter weekend.&nbsp; We were set to leave for
my grandparent's house that morning.&nbsp; Around 6 AM I awoke, couging
repeatedly.&nbsp; I took some Buckley's to calm my throat and rolled
over onto my stomach, sprawled across the right side of my bed with my
feet apart.&nbsp; Not a minute later I heard a repeated tapping above
my head (on my headboard).&nbsp; It lasted about a full minute and I
did not think much of it but suddenly, it felt as if someone placed
their hand between my feet and compressed the covers, or as if a cat
was sitting between my feet.&nbsp; it just appeared, this strange
sensation.&nbsp; I lay frozen not knowing what to think.&nbsp; I was so
frightened.&nbsp; I finally gathered the courage to rip out of bed and
turn on my light.&nbsp; Of course there was nothing there and my door
was closed and locked so our cat was not in my room.&nbsp; I remember
seeing a faint thread of light whisp by and disappear but it could have
been my eyes adjusting to the light (as it was still very dark at
AM).&nbsp; I told my mom about what happened and she mentioned that she
had a similar experience in my room two weeks prior.&nbsp; She said it
felt as if the cat jumped up on the bed, but there was nothing there of
course.&nbsp; I'm not sure what to think.&nbsp; I like to think that it
was my father making sure I was alright.. maybe it was the ghost of a
passed cat (Oscar)... or maybe it was nothing.&nbsp; One thing that
convinces me that this was a paranormal incident is the fact that I've
read about "tapping" before a paranormal event occurs.&nbsp; I read
this book called the Ghost that Haunted Itself - the story of the
Mackenzie Poltergeist By Jan Andrew-Henderson.&nbsp; It is a book of
well-documented hauntings surrounding the Black Mausoleum, a tomb in
Greyfriar's cemetery in Edinburgh, Ireland.&nbsp; Ben Scott leads tours
of this tomb and one of his encounters was very similar to my
own.&nbsp; On page 21 it reads, <br>
"Ben lay in his bed staring up at the cieling.&nbsp; it was almost
Easter.&nbsp; He had drunk too much and had gone to bed alone.&nbsp; As
he lay unsuccessfully trying to sleep, he heard a repeated tapping
noise just above his head.&nbsp; Ben didn't know what it was, and he no
longer cared.&nbsp; A few minutes later he heard the heavy swish of the
bead curtains parting..."&nbsp; <br>
I almost couldn't breathe when I read this.&nbsp; I couldn't believe
how related the incidents were.&nbsp; But, it could all be coincidence.<br>
One other thing that frightened me occured this past May.&nbsp; It was
May 5th actually (The second anniversary of my father's passing) and I
had just returned home from a friend's house.&nbsp; It was around 3AM
and I went to sleep in the guest/computer room because my room was
occupied by my mother because her basement room had flooded due to a
leak in the foundation when our pool thawed.&nbsp; I was dozing off
when suddenly I heard something fall off the shelf of the computer desk
onto the desk itself.&nbsp; It made a very loud noise that startled me
awake.&nbsp; I was frozen and felt very threatened, like something was
looming in the darkness, approaching me. I yelled out "Go away!" not
really thinking how ridiculous I sounded.&nbsp; I scrambled to open the
door proceeding to run out of the room and into my room to my
mom.&nbsp; I jumped under the covers, absolutely quivering and crying
(I get scared very easily).&nbsp; So she got up to check out the
room.&nbsp; I went with her and we turned on the light.&nbsp; A heavy
compass that sat on the top shelf had fallen and that's what the noise
was.&nbsp; But how on earth the compass inched off the shelf and fell
onto the desk is a complete, and eerie mystery.&nbsp; <br>
Not too much else has happened since.&nbsp; Before we rennovated the
house over the summer, we would sometimes hear random knocks and a
picture (of my father) once "gently" fell to the floor when a plant was
placed a little bit in front of it.&nbsp; My mother's diamond
engagement ring (from my father) has disappeared never to be found to
this day.&nbsp; But again, I guess these things happen.&nbsp; <br>

Ghost in Paris<br>
<br>
<br>
By: betterwords@verizon.net<br>
<br>
I just thought I'd share my ghost story--<br>
In the summer of 2001 I was living in Paris in a building that I
believe was built in 1863. The elevator was deemed "historic" and was
creaky and slow and broke often, but couldn't be replaced because it
was an antique and they had rules about that. The elevator was wooden
on three sides and made of grating and stained glass in the front, and
each landing was grated, so you could see right into the elevator when
it stopped, and anyone standing there when you were in the elevator
could see you -- the elevator was very small, just big enough for three
average weight people to stand inside. A friend visited me in August
and we decided to go out shopping in the afternoon. We went to the
landing and pressed the button for the elevator. I might mention that I
believe that we were probably just about the only people in this
building at the time -- the Parisians had all left for the seashore and
I hadn't seen anyone but the building's porter and one other person the
whole summer. This day, when the elevator came, there was a man in it.
My friend and I both gasped at the same time because it was very
unexpected. The man was handsome with thick, black short hair, maybe in
his 30s, tall-ish, wearing a dark suit with a white shirt that was open
at the collar. He looked very crisp and rich, but a little tousled,
like he had just come back from a party. Within the blink of an eye,
the man was gone -- in a flash!<br>
The elevator hadn't opened (you pushed the door to open it) -- he just
vanished. My friend and I said "did you see that?" to each other, and
we confirmed the description. He looked just like a regular person, not
clear or ghost-like at all. Then, she just got into the elevator --
brave! I got in with her, but I made her stand where he had been
standing!<br>

Haunted House<br>
<br>
By: CR1@beasleyfirm.com<br>
<br>
In June of 1988 my husband and I moved to a small town in Gloucester
County, New Jersey called Paulsboro.&nbsp; Paulsboro is situated along
the Delaware River and Mantua Creek; to get into town, you have to
cross a small bridge over Mantua Creek.&nbsp; We had a dog, and after a
long day at the office banging away at a keyboard, I enjoyed taking our
little darling for a walk.&nbsp; Many times the dog and I would walk
down our street, turn onto Broad Street, cross the bridge and walk down
Crown Point Road for a bit, then turn home.&nbsp; For some reason I was
reluctant to walk on the east side of the bridge, or the east side of
Crown Point Road near the bridge.&nbsp; I can remember looking off into
a woodsy area on the east side of Crown Point Road by the bridge and
thinking, "I don't know what happened there, but it must have been
something really bad to make me feel this spooked."&nbsp; About five
years after we came to Paulsboro, I was driving home on a "dark and
stormy night" as Snoopy would say.&nbsp; The rain was so heavy I could
barely see the road ahead.&nbsp; As I approached the bridge from Crown
Point Road, I caught a glimpse through the murky weather of a house on
the east side of the bridge (where I knew no house was &#8230; it was that
little woodsy area that always spooked me so much).&nbsp; The house was
a ball of fire, flames were shooting straight up into the air like the
Fourth of July, and the smell of wood burning filled the car.&nbsp; As
quickly as I saw the house, it was gone, vanished and the scent of
charred wood disappeared with it.&nbsp; Yes, I was scared, even though
the doors of the car were locked.&nbsp; Periodically, when I'd be
coming home from that direction but only when it was stormy and late at
night, I'd catch a two or three second glimpse of a house engulfed in
fire and smell the scent of a house burning (which is entirely
different from the scent of something like leaves burning or a
fireplace).&nbsp; This happened about six times over ten years and the
experience really spooked me.&nbsp; <br>
A few years later, I learned that back in the 1930's or 1940's (can't
remember the decade, but during that time period) there WAS a house
located on that piece of ground.&nbsp; The family living there had
either five or six children (I can't remember now how many, but it was
more than four) and one night when the father was working night shift,
the house caught fire and all the children died in the blaze.&nbsp;
Witnesses said the oldest girl (who was about thirteen) ran back into
the house and up the stairs to save her littlest brother, who was a
baby.&nbsp; Needless to say, now I understand why that spot always made
me uncomfortable and where the scent of charred wood came from.&nbsp; <br>
What I think is interesting is that the ghost of this story isn't a
person, or an animal, but an inanimate object: a house!&nbsp; A house
that no longer exists, and hasn't existed for over a half a century,
but still blazes away like a Halloween pumpkin when conditions are just
right &#8230; so the next time there is an unusually dark and stormy night,
come on down to Gloucester County, New Jersey and head for Paulsboro
from Crown Point Road.&nbsp; You just may be haunted by a house.<br>

I have a Novel<br>
<br>
<br>
By: harlequeen2763@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My first name is Holly and i don't know if this will help your page or
if you'd just be interested in hearing my story.&nbsp; But telling
someone who will not laugh in my face will help me get this weight off
my chest.<br>
I am twenty-one, so for me to tell my story to anyone, they aren't
going to believe me.&nbsp; Thinking that i am young and i made it
up.&nbsp; But let me tell you.&nbsp; After I tell you my life's
experiences, you'll know it isn't just a figment of imagination.&nbsp;
Because if it is, then my whole family is crazy along with me.<br>
The haunting first occurred in my Grandmother's house.&nbsp; I have two
sisters and three brothers. One of my brothers wasn't born until i was
fourteen.&nbsp; One of those sisters is my identical twin, so pretty
much whateverI happened, happened to both of us for some reason.&nbsp;
We really never had that twin connection until she moved away and now
it;s like we are in the same room er a three hundred miles away from
each other.<br>
Anyways, I lived in the house from the time i was four until i was
about sixteen, i don't really remember when i first noticed strange
things going on.&nbsp; The first thing i can actually remember is when
i was five.&nbsp; My sister and i shared a room and a bed.&nbsp; So i
slept on the side closest to the door.&nbsp; I was always afraid to
look into the hallway.&nbsp; I always felt like I wasn't alone.&nbsp;
Like someone was watching me.&nbsp; I woke up one night to see a huge
ball of white light.&nbsp; I mean big and bright enough to illuminate
the entire hallway and my room.&nbsp; I watched it slowly float out of
the bathroom, past my room, all the way down the hall and down the
stairs where it disappeared into the way.&nbsp; I wasn't afraid, but
afterwards when I realized that what I saw wasn't alive, i was
terrified.&nbsp; <br>
Things always seemed to happen to one of us at a time, expect
once.&nbsp; We were all sitting watching T.V. one night, when we first
a crash in the dining room next to our living room.&nbsp; My mom went
to go investigate.&nbsp; The picture was off the wall and sitting up
against the wall on the floor.&nbsp; No broken glass, no nail missing
from the wall.&nbsp; It was as if someone just took it off the wall and
placed it on the floor.&nbsp; But that doesn't explain the loud crash
that we all heard.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also had a wooden spoon, fork, and
knife set that hung on the wall in the same room that liked to fall or
go flying acrossed the room.<br>
The older my sisters and brother got, the more we realized, this house
wasn't your normal ouse.&nbsp; In normal houses, things don't go bump
in the night.&nbsp; Strange voices don't call our your name when you
are home alone.&nbsp; Items don't disappear to be found years later on
top of a shelf at eye level.&nbsp; Gusts of cold wind don't blow so
hard that it makes your hair fly off your shoulders and it smells of an
odor of your grandfather that passed away before moving into the
house.&nbsp; Or footsteps that come up the stairs and right before it
gets to where you can see the person, they stop.<br>
I remember i was always afraid of my grandmothers room, because I had
so many sisters and brothers, we had to share rooms.&nbsp; So when my
brother came home from college and got my room, i had to sleep on the
floor of my grandma's room.&nbsp; I couldn't fall asleep because of the
presence of a tall, thin man standing over my bed looking at me.&nbsp;
I couldn't actually see him, but i sawa a shadow of him.&nbsp; I got
the feeling he didn't like children, because when i got to the age of
about eleven, i never saw him again.<br>
But I think there were also the ghosts of children.&nbsp; Because once
when my twin and i were thriteen and my older sister fifteen.&nbsp; We
were out at a family party.&nbsp; My older brother was getting ready
for a date when he looked into the mirror, which relected off a mirror
behind him so you can see into our grandma's room.&nbsp; And he saw
what looked like a little girl, about ten or twelve, sitting on the
bed.&nbsp; He said he thought it was me, cuz i look younger then what i
am, and came into the room to ask why i hadn't left yet.&nbsp; And
nobody was there.&nbsp; He said she looked just like me.&nbsp; <br>
I really don't know if it's in our DNA or what, but almost every house
and I and my sisters and brothers live in are haunted.&nbsp; I get the
feeling that our orginal ghosts have followed us.&nbsp; When were moved
not into the next house, but one after grandma's, but the next
one.&nbsp; I never actually saw anything, but my little brother who
wasn't born until i was fifteen, says he saw something.&nbsp; I was
about nineteen and he about five.&nbsp; He would refuse to go to the
bathroom alone.&nbsp; Said he wouldn't go into the hallway because the
little girl sitting on the floor crying scared him.&nbsp; I thought he
was making it up.&nbsp; But I could hear him talking ot someone in the
hallway sometimes and I asked him who he was talking to, and he would
said, the little girl who cries all the time.&nbsp; But nobody else in
the house could see or hear her.&nbsp; When i was eighteen, my
grandma....same grandma who's house is haunted....came to stay with us
for a couple of months because her health wasn't too good.&nbsp;
Anyway, I started hearing what sounded like footsteps...more like
stomping coming from upstairs.&nbsp; I thought i was imagining it,
until grandma looks up at me and says, who's up there stomping
around?Mind you, I was the only one up stairs usually, the upstairs was
one bedroom.<br>
After this house, my twin sister moved away and got married, I went off
to college.&nbsp; My older sister is living with her boyfriend.&nbsp;
My older brother is living with his girlfriend and their baby
girl.&nbsp; My oldest brother is living in an apartment.&nbsp; And my
youngest brother is living with my mom and my step-father in Indiana
now.&nbsp; We are scattering acrossed the united states.&nbsp; From
Indiana, to Texas, to Pennsylvania, and to New York.&nbsp; All of our
ouses are haunted, and I know, because I have to been to each one.<br>
First i will start with my occurence when i went ot college.&nbsp; I
went to an cheap college and lived on campus so i wouldn't be home with
"it".&nbsp; That didn't work.&nbsp; Because wheni had a friend over to
watch a movie with me, we were sitting on a bunk bed they provide for
us, and the window behind us decided it wanted to open all the way up
and slam back down.&nbsp; The window was closed and locked.&nbsp; Then
sometime later, i was sleeping on the top bunk and my roomie was on the
bottom.&nbsp; I had my hand hanging over the side like I usually do,
and i felt someone tug on my hang,, hard enough to jar me from my sleep
and almost slide me off the edge.&nbsp; I said "Hey stop it"&nbsp;
Thinking it was my roomie under me being childish.&nbsp; Until i heard
a giggle that could have only come from a little girl.&nbsp; Meanless
to say, i didn't sleep the rest of the night and the next day i moved
out to a townhouse all the way acrossed campus.&nbsp; But i guess the
ghost wasn't done.&nbsp; She or even he, liked to go room to room
waking up girls and keeping them up all night, pulling there hair,
turning the tv's on.&nbsp; I heard about it the next morning in the
cafeteria at breakfast.<br>
Now i am getting married to my college sweetheart and once again i get
the feeling that I am not alone.&nbsp; Door handle turn on there
own.&nbsp; I keep seeing a shadow of a perosn in the hallway.&nbsp; <br>
My twin sister has had her ghost tug on her earring,while in her
ear.&nbsp; Toliets flush...it sounds funny, but it's true.&nbsp; Smells
of perfume. Her two-year old who is looking up at someth g that isn't
there and smiling.&nbsp; Or her waking up and trying saying someone
jumbled about a lady.<br>
My mom's house in Indiana is most uncomfortable.&nbsp; My little
brother, who is now almost seven,&nbsp; new room has his own computer
in it.&nbsp; I was laying on the bed with him one night trying to get
him to go to sleep.&nbsp; He kept saying he didnt like the new computer
and to take it out of the room.&nbsp; When all of a sudden the keyboard
started typing away on it own.&nbsp; He and I bolted from the
room.&nbsp; The computer is now in the basement, it still like to do
that typing crap, but at least it isn't in his room with him.&nbsp; As
far as seeing anything, no none of us in our new house have seen
anything.&nbsp; But the odors, footsteps, things disappearing and
voices haven't left any of us.&nbsp; <br>
The only sitting was one night.&nbsp; Our uncle had been sick....and
Mike, my older brother was sitting in the living room of his house
sleeping.&nbsp; Woke up to three balls of light coming from the ceiling
flowind downward until it came next to him and disappeared.&nbsp; his
girlfriend, who is psychic....i know this all sounds strange.&nbsp;
Said that it was the spirit of our uncle coming to tell him he was safe
and had pasted on to the other side safe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning
we got a call from the hospital saying ou uncle has pasted
on.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
That isn't it, I don't know if this has to do with my mom's
haunting.&nbsp; But a black bird got into her sunroom.....no doors or
windows open.&nbsp; It just sat there staring at her, didn't fly or
anything.&nbsp; Just was there, didn't know h it go there.&nbsp; But it
was there all day long.&nbsp; That night, a close friend of the family
died.&nbsp; Wasn't sick, just had a heartache at a young age and
died.&nbsp; My mom thought the black bird was an omen and went to go
see if it was still there, and it was gone.&nbsp; Same sort of thing
happen to my aunt and uncle.&nbsp; A bird came into the house, they
don't know how, and wouldn't leave and then just disappeared when
something bad happened to their son.&nbsp; I don;t know what the
connection is.<br>

And still more tales from the haunted diary<br>
<br>
By: Severus12000@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Yes, I am back again with even more. I said I have many and they keep
coming. I really love that thousands upon thousands of people have led
haunted lives or know someone who has. Some things just can't be
explained and thank you <br>
Shadowlands for letting us tell our experiences.<br>
1.In the summer of 1998, I had this weird, creepy dream. In it, I was
standing on the right side of our local cemetery. Everything was in
pitch blackness, as if it was deep in the night. Now this cemetery is
divided by a road going up the mountain, the road goes up to the top.
But halfway, the road goes from left to right. <br>
I thought I saw a woman walking up the road in the darkness. I could
see that she had a long black dress on and a black veil. How could I
see this, you ask? Well, from under the veil was shining a bright white
light. Odd, yes. But then she stopped and looked at me. I still shiver
when I think about that dream! <br>
I saw a relative of mine and she was crying her eyes out in misery. Just heartbroken.<br>
Fast forward to March 4th 1999, My Great-Aunt died from an aneurysm she
had had on Feb. 28th. Okay, this Great-Aunt was e Mother-in-Law of the
woman that I had seen crying in my dream!! <br>
But hold on, On March 17, 1999, My Great-Aunt's only son died. This <br>
man was the husband of the woman I had seen bawling her eyes out in my dream. It still freaks me out to think of all that.<br>
2.August 27th 1996- My brother, J. saw a large orange light flashing <br>
over a space of 30 minutes at Economy Drug store in <br>
South Williamson, Ky. J.S. was working the gas <br>
station window and my brother, J. was standing there <br>
talking to him. They both witnessed this light and a <br>
third person also saw it, but hurriedly filled his <br>
gas tank and left. <br>
*In February of 2001-C.G. <br>
(one of the gas station attendants for <br>
Economy Drug store got killed in a crash.)<br>
Also later in 2001-The man who owned EDS dropped <br>
dead in the store of a heart attack. <br>
2005-The store closed.*<br>
3.1996 or 97 [?] My husband George's family had a black and white cat
named LC This cat was very distinct looking because it had survived a
stroke earlier. So, it's neck was twisted to the side and as I have
stated, it was distinctive. Well, one night after the cat had died....
George's parents were gone but my Brother [who was dating George's
Sister at the time were in the house.] Next door...George's Aunt and
Uncle had looked out and seen LC!! They saw it sitting in the road with
it's head twisted sideways (The cat was buried beneath George's window
in truth.) But their Aunt called and had Amanda and Jason take a look
outside and tell them what they saw. And they saw LC sitting in the
road just like he was alive. Then the cat vanished. <br>
4.August 27, 1996-[Tuesday] A co-worker, Billy B., told me, he kept seeing a tall blonde woman crying around me.<br>
August 29, 1996-[Thursday]<br>
I went to watch a movie with Billy...I asked him what <br>
time it was...and he said 05 pm. <br>
*The next day-I found out my cousin, a tall blonde lady ...<br>
had gotten killed the previous evening at 6:10 pm. She <br>
had been killed in a car accident on the 29th of August, <br>
1996.*<br>
5.I was 14 going on 15 in the summer of 1985, when I had this dream.<br>
In this dream, I thought I saw my brother and myself standing in front
of our grandparent's home and it was just about dark. Suddenly, our dad
drives fast by us in his green car and he never looked at us but kept
staring straight ahead. He was wearing his work uniform and had his
arms rigidly straight while he drove away. Next, I thought I saw him
drive off the bridge and go down in muddy water. He never re-surfaced,
either. <br>
At the time, I thought it was a warning of my great-grandmother's passing. She died on November 10, 1985.<br>
*On November 9, 1987, Dad had a heart attack and he went with his uncle
to the hospital wearing his work uniform holding his arms rigidly out
in front of him. They passed under every green light but dad died in
the car!*<br>
6.As of February 23rd 2005-<br>
Mom has been dreaming of 3 boys sitting up and looking at her. Plus, she is having a new dream reoccur now.<br>
In it, she is on a pretty cemetery and she watches as a casket is
lifted from a grave and the vault taken from it...(a bronze casket)
Then a man sits up inside it, while it is still in mid-air! He reaches
to Mom and claims that he was buried alive. ((Brr!)) She is sure that
we will lose a family member soon. The dreans turned into my brother
and his estranged wife((who is my husband's sister)) in the caskets.
They would sit up and say they weren't dead. Brr!<br>
-May 2005--Mom keeps dreaming of graves and caskets in the day and
night time. BRRR!!! We both know something really bad is ahead. Anytime
Mom dreams of caskets, it foretells accidents and death. It may take a
while but it does come to pass.<br>
*O July 9th-My Brother was in a bad truck accident breaking his jaw and 6 ribs!!<br>
Sept 17th, 2005-My Brother, Jason's best friend died.<br>
7.Friday, October 07, 2005- 9:35 PM- Well, Mom just called a while ago and told me a few things that scared the hell out of me!<br>
A.Wednesday night 10/5/2005- My Grandmother dreamt of a large black
wolf like face in front of her. When she woke up, it was still there!
She even threw up her arms to fend this thing off. It had long stringy
black hair and a snout but no teeth. It terrified Mawmaw.<br>
B.Mom had a dream last night 10/7/2005-Early am, this morning. In this
dream, she was standing on a cemetery and everyone in the cemetery was
being supported above their graves. All of the people were sitting up
reaching for her. Thing is, it was everyone she knew! <br>
*October 21st 2005-George's Grandmother died.-<br>
November 3rd 2005-George's Sister lost her baby.*<br>
8.Fire Eating Demon-This tale was told to me by my husband and his
family. I am not sure of the year but I will say approximately around
1900 or in those years this event happened.<br>
My husband's Mother's Grandmother and Grandfather lived in Martin
County, Ky and this was a very rural area especially during that
timeframe. Well, one night they heard a knocking at their door and the
man went to open the door. The next instant, he was flat on his back
screaming for his wife to shut the door because he had just seen the
devil outside!<br>
Well, they kept hearing this thing jump from hill to hill all night long as they sat shaking and praying for mercy.<br>
The next day, a neighbor came over and related his tale of how he had
poked a red hot fire poker through his door and the creature ate the
fire on it and begged for more! This thing walked upright on two feet
that were said to be cloven hoofed.<br>
What was it and why did it show itself to them?<br>
9.This next event took place around 1994 or so, i happened at the house
of our friend Marshall. This house was very haunted and it was built
next to the local cemetery mentioned above. There were reports from
others that claimed to see Marshall on this cemetery, when he was
nowhere around. And I myself have seen Marshall's doppleganger a few
times. And another thing, in this house, I saw a figure open his
Mother's door when she was not in the house. It looked like his
Grandmother, but she was NOT there! This figure opened the bedroom
door, peered out at me, (it was a shadow figure) and then closed the
door back. That house gave everyone the shivers. It is no longer
standing, (such a shame) but here are two more experiences in it.
Marshall had my future husband over to stay all night with him and he
went to his kitchen and on the way back through the hallway in that
SCARY house--M heard his name growled out. He ran back to the room and
found out no one could possibly have done it. <br>
Another time, those two walked me home and when they got back down to
that house, M's mother's boyfriend looked through the frosted panes of
the door that separated the living room from the hallway and saw a long
haired figure walk in behind them. This figure stopped and stared
through the door panes at him and it freaked him out!! The guy thought
it was me but my friends had walked me home and had come back through
the hallway. Evidently, they had a follower that stopped to stare
through that frosted paned door at him. This gives me chills!<br>
10.Let me share what my Mother saw in August of 1996, we were on our
way home from a funeral (the tall blonde woman who had gotten killed in
a car wreck) and it was dusk dark. Well, the road was kinda spooky
anyway and Mom looks up into her rearview mirror and screams then, she
hits the gas...By this time, I am wondering what the hell! So, I ask
her what she saw. <br>
She just keeps staring at that rvm and trying to get home fast. I look
around thinking she saw something in the road. When we got home, She
got out of the car an told me that she had seen something in the
backseat!!! Sitting behind me!! It had sharp teeth and it seemed to be
reaching out for her. It was looking at her through the Rear view
mirror! I freaked out! This thing looked like a deformed dwarf with
short arms but big hands. Mom says that it had red eyes and it stared
at her from behind me for 3 miles until we reached home. That scared
the crap out of me!! <br>
11.Just last week, 1st week of December 2005, I got up to use the
bathroom. When I turned on the light, I glanced in the mirror and saw
something that creeped me out! My eyes had large black circles beneath
them and I looked ghastly! After blinking, things were normal. I just
hope that didn't mean I would get sick or something. Brr!!<br>

I Have an Experience for you<br>
<br>
By: Crafdeanne@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I have just moved into my home on Oct 30th 2005 and I am renting
it.&nbsp; The night before, I was here painting one of the upstairs
bedrooms. Around 10pm I distinctively heard my patio door open in the
dining room at the bottom of the steps and foot steps creaking the
steps up to where I was painting.&nbsp; No one entered the room I was
painting.&nbsp; I thought it was my boyfriend but he didn't answer when
I called his name.&nbsp; A minute later my boyfriend called my cell
phone from his house and thought I was nuts for even thinking so
dumb.&nbsp; Now a month later we have several other occurrences that
have been taking place.&nbsp; My daughter felt and heard a whisper in
her ear as she bent down to empty the drier in the laundry room.&nbsp;
Her bedroom lights go on and off often. Our Weiner dog will not enter
the room. If she puts her in there, she scratches to get out after a
few seconds. We hear 2 men's voices having a conversation in the living
room and there are no other radios or TV's on in the whole house.&nbsp;
I like it quiet when I am home.&nbsp; The kids hear bangs in the night
in their rooms huge closets. We hear what sounds like heavy items hit
the basement floor all the time and there is nothing there when we run
to look. There are many cold spots in the house. Just last nite,
Dec.7th, at 3:20 am, I got up to go to the bathroom at my usual 3 am
waking for no reason at all each nite and the bathroom door was not
closed all the way. Since it was 3:20 am I did not fear anyone would be
coming in on me. Just then the door started to pull open and I yelled
"I'm in here!!!" and the door closed and shut all the way.&nbsp; I
looked in my bedroom door just adjacent to my bathroom door and my
boyfriend was snoring away peacefully and I awoke him and asked him if
he was at the door and he was angry at me for waking him with such a
stupid question.&nbsp; I then went up stairs to my children's rooms and
found them both sleeping soundly.&nbsp; This afternoon my landlord
called me about a cable installation problem and I asked her if my
house was haunted.&nbsp; She hesitated for what felt like an eternity
and she then finally answered.&nbsp; "Its the man from across the
street. He watched over my girls.&nbsp; He hung out in my youngest
daughters room.&nbsp; That's why they slept together in my oldest girls
room."&nbsp; (her baby is 2 and her oldest is 4) She said they weren't
scared of him.&nbsp; He was friendly.&nbsp; She couldn't remember his
name but that he killed himself in the house across the street years
ago and I should go ask her grandfather in law that works next door
what his name was.&nbsp; I asked him and found it to be&nbsp; Russell
Lentz and he shot himself in his basement as he was dying from cancer
25 years ago.&nbsp; She said talk to him by name and that they
did.&nbsp; She was surprised I hadn't called earlier about it so she
figured we weren't bothered by him.&nbsp; She has not woke at 3 am
since she moved out of here and the girls have not yet been visited by
Russell Lentz yet. We are not afraid of him at all and talk out loud to
him all the time. The kids ask him to turn on things and he doesn't.
ha.&nbsp; My kids are 14 and 16 and think its awesome we have a haunted
house.&nbsp; Tonight my son and I went next door to work on the Xmas
tree and wreaths they sell and a path was shoveled from their door to
my door with a shovel.&nbsp; It wasn't there when we just drove in the
driveway from religion class and stepped in the house to get gloves and
stepped back out to walk a 160 feet to their door.<br>

My Experiences in North Carolina<br>
<br>
<br>
By: practitioner45@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
When I was 15 years old I went to North Carolina with by parents and
grandmother to help clean out my grandmother's brother's house who had
recently died.&nbsp; There were a lot of antiques in the house and a
heavy four poster bed in his previous wife's room.<br>
At night, my grandmother insisted on sleeping in the enclosed porch .
My sister, who was 8, and I slept in his wife's room.&nbsp; The house
was surrounded by very large pine trees so it was very dark in the
house.&nbsp; In the middle of the night I woke to the bed shaking
violently. I was so scared I could not yell for my parents.&nbsp; After
a while the bed stopped shaking and it sounded like the squeak of a
hand going around one of the posters of the bed. Finally I yelled for
my Mom.&nbsp; She came in and slept with my sister and I went and slept
with my Dad.&nbsp; My Mom said the same thing happened to her that
night.&nbsp; The next night my parents slept in the "haunted"
room.&nbsp; Just recently (30 some years later) my Dad told me it
happened again that night.&nbsp; Weird!!<br>

The Ghosts In My House<br>
<br>
By: Lowcock1987@aol.com<br>
<br>
Well basicly me and my mum and my sister have been living in a house in
England in a small place called Glossop for coming on 4 years now and
over these 4 years theres been some really strange things that have
happened. The first thing that happened actually happened to me, I
talking to my friend on the internet and i said i was going to make
myself some noodles, as i was about to go up the first step heading to
my bedroom, i seen a man in my living room..he was quite blurry but i
could see clearly it was a man and he began walking towards my
fireplace, at this point i was that scared i droped my bowl and drink
and ran upstairs and told my mother but she didn't really believe me.
Then afew months later me and my sister were running to the bathroom
trying to beat each other (before school rush) and as we got to the
door the light switch suddenly turned itself off then on again. Nothing
happened for afew more months but then i was cooking on the stove and
suddenly i seen what i thought was my sisters legs run past the
landing..i could only see the legs because theres a wall stopping your
view upto a certain point..and i thought it was my sister going to the
bathroom so i ran up and held the bathroom door handle up then i turned
the light out to scare her (i'd do this before)..she didn't scream like
she normally would..i just felt very cold all of a sudden and i looked
downstairs and my sister ran past with the dog not far behind her
chasing (playing). about a year after that i went upstairs to bed about
2 am and there i had a door bell put on my room (the button was
downstairs) so mother if she wanted me could press it because i used to
like my music loud and that night it went off about 3 am and i went
onto my mohters room like 'whats the matter?' and she looked VERY pale
and she said ' i didn't press it' and i thought it might be the
batteries dying but then it starting going off really quickly like
someone was raming the button! and then about 1 year later we was in
her room about 9pm and we heard coming from downstairs a drum beat
which was a proper drum beat in tune and everything, sounded like drum
sticks on our kitchen side and there was noone but us two in the house.
The final thing to happen was only 3 weeks ago, me and my girlfriend
were in bed and she woke me up sayin 'can you hear that?!?' and after
i'd woken abit more i could hear it well! it sounded like a girl
moaning and crying..at first i thought it might have been my mother but
i checked on her and she was asleep and i looked for the ladies car who
lives next door and she wasn't in, by this point the cries and moans
had stoped..but as soon as i got back into bed they started
again..louder like this person wanted us to hear..and 2 nights ago my
mother went to the tiolet about 4am and the bathroom sinks cold tap had
been turned on FULL (splashing over the sides) and she hadn't done it
and i hadn't been in the bathroom that night and my sister was at her
dads that night!<br>

I See Ghosts!<br>
<br>
<br>
By: kazamalove@gmail.com <br>
<br>
Thoughout my life I have encounter many ghosts.&nbsp; Good thing the
ghosts never really bothered me, they walk away as if I was not
their.&nbsp; But I clearly see them, as clear as a clean window.&nbsp;
Anyways, I'm going to talk about the most disturbing one, I do not have
enough time to write about the rest.&nbsp; You know I have enough to
start my own book.&nbsp; <br>
Anyways, 1995 in Glendale, Arizona we just moved into a house located
near the downtown Glendale area.&nbsp; This area was a mess at the
time, and in the middle of the housing area is a small cemetary.&nbsp;
In my opinion, it should not be there, and should be moved, for crying
out loud, it's a residence area!&nbsp; But all around Glendale,
especially West Glendale, lies many scatter cemetarys..&nbsp; anyways
back to my experience, one night I was home alone, family went to
california for a vacation and left during the afternoon.&nbsp;
Everything was fine till night came.&nbsp; When night came, all heck
broke loose....&nbsp; As usual I would take a bath before i head to
bed, and while I was bathing I swore something walk through the door
and starting screaming, i got so scared I popped out of the tub!!&nbsp;
my heart was racing, i felt so cold, I felt like time has frozen, my
head was spinning, the only thing i could think of was "what the heck
was that" .&nbsp; when i was having my panic attack the ghost, the
thing, the whatever it was backup and passed through the door, it was
not sreaming, but it said "sorry".&nbsp; anyways i hurried and wash the
remaining soap and shampoo off me, and headed out looking around the
house for the "thing".&nbsp; at this time i was not as scared, because
I got my iron rod.&nbsp; I dont know why this rod always made be feel
safe.&nbsp; this rod is sacred to me.&nbsp; i call it my demon
rod.&nbsp; anyways, i search the house, nothing was found.&nbsp; I
headed for bed, and hope morning come fast.&nbsp; I maded though the
night, and did not experience anything else.&nbsp; <br>
The thing at the time I saw it didn't look like human, it didn't look
like no animal nor did it come close looking like anything from this
planet.&nbsp; it did however looked like a ghost, but of what I don't
know.&nbsp; this was not the last of it, for I seen it many more times
after this.&nbsp; and it always around when my ROD was not with
me.&nbsp; <br>

Continuation <br>
<br>
By: bossox17@yahoo.com<br>

<br>
I submitted a story to you prior to this one a couple of years ago.
I've had some recent occurences that I would like to share with you if
that's ok. Here is my story<br>
In the fall of 2001, my best friend Harley was killed in a tragic car
accident and I took his death very hard. When first died, I felt that
he was always around.. When I was living in England, my dorm room would
smell like his after shave and I could sense he was around. And
occasionally he would come to me a dream. But lately things have been
quiet until recently.<br>
A couple of months ago I had a dream with Harley in it. We were sitting
around a pinic table and he looked just as healthy and happy as if he
were alive. He told me to quit worring about everything and that I
would be alright. He would never stop taking care of me. And then this
past Thanksgiving, I was driving to my boyfriends house and as I'm
going along on the highway I got this strange feeling like the car in
the next lane was going to cut me off. So I backed off the car in front
of me and wouldn't you know it? That car cut in front of me with no
warning at all. Now how did I know that that car was going to do that
before he even did it? Some people tell me it was my friend looking out
for me since his accident occured on Thanksgiving. I know they are not
big, spooky stories, but they make me believe that we do not 'die'
after death and that we can still communicate with our loved ones here
on earth. <br>

asleep instead I let the machine pick it up,the message wasn't clear at

Recita CA<br>
<br>
By: jetsfan37@sbcglobal.net<br>
<br>
When I was little, I'd say ever since I was potty trained, I would wake
up at 3:30 am to 4:30 am to use the restroom. I was never scared to get
up in the dark, walk down the dark hall, and enter the bathroom. I'd
simply turn on the light do whatever and go back to bed. Well when I
was about 5 or 6 years old I was living in Recita (rah see tah), CA.
Well I woke up that night, as I said, roughly 4 am to go to the
bathroom. For some reason I had a wierd felling something wasn't right
(you probably know what I'm talking about). So I decided to check on my
brother. I climbed up the ladder of the bunk bed to find him sleeping.
So I got down and headed for the door. I walked across the hall and
opened my parent's bedroom door. My mom and step-dad were both
sleeping. That comforted somewhat so headed to the restroom. Upon
exiting I heard bowls clinking together in the kitchen. Now I had no
cats and the dogs (2) were in an outside room. I dicided to ignore it
and went to my room but felt I had to make sure it wasn't my parents. I
opened the door and they were both still sleeping. I went into my room,
closed the door, checked on my brother- who was still there- and got in
bed. As soon as I got comfortable I heard foot steps coming down the
hall. Now I was scared, but not tottaly fre ed out. I pulled the
blanket up to my chin and waited. The footsteps continued and stopped
outside my door. Then I saw the doorknob turn and thought, that's
enough for me, and ducked under my blankets. I heard the footsteps walk
towards my bed and stop right next to it. Since I was scared, I guess,
my hearing was sharper. Because I heard what sounded like boots turn
and screech on the hard wood floor. Then the person or thing bent over
me and started this deep harsh breathing, but nothing more than that. I
wanted to see what it was or just scream. But Iwas, as I descibe it,
paralyzed with fear. Not just phisicaly, but vocally too. So I just lay
there listening to the breathing until I fell asleep, or passed out. In
the morning I went into the kitchen and looked around. No bowls were
even out, so I still don't know where the noise came from. I never told
any one that morning and no one said they heard noises or anything so I
gradually dismissed as a dream. But a couple years later my Great Aunt
Myra was reading stories out of my favourite book, Scary Stories to
Tell in the Dark. She finished, paused and then said, " You know, that
reminds me of an experience I had when I was a little girl..." and
began to tell me and my brother her story. I got scared because her
story was almost exactly mine- the only difference is she held a coss
necklace and prayed all night. Remember I said I hadn't told anyone
what happend to me, so I was shocked. Then my brother D.J., who by the
way is one yearr older than me, said to my aunt that same thing
happened to him in our house in Recita. We now, at this time, lived in
Sylmar, CA. So my brother saying that convinced me it was no dream. A
while after this I had a dream of the incedent that showed me what the
figure that came down the hall looked like. I'm not sure if this is
what it looked like, but this is how the dream showed it. It was a man,
about 6 1/2 ft tall, that was all shadows. It was like he was sweating
a dense fog. Ever since then I've en the same shape shadow dart into
various places out of the corner of my eye. I know I am not imagining
this. I see these shadows alot. Well, not recently as I'm older and
busier with chores and school. ( I'm 12 by the way). There was a really
scary Shadow Person as I call them at my aunts house- the one mentioned
earlier. but I'll tell that story another time. <br>

Taffy<br>
<br>
By: dlayne@doeal.gov<br>
<br>
My Canine Ghost "Taffy"<br>
I recently lost my beloved Labrador golden retriever, Taffy.&nbsp; She
was a kind, affectionate and extremely intelligent dog!&nbsp; It seemed
as if she could read my mind and she followed me everywhere I
went.&nbsp; She passed away from cancer on July 26th of this
year.&nbsp; I felt as if I had lost my very best friend and certainly a
family member, although Taffy had become my only family since my
husband left and my son grew up and moved out.&nbsp; Taffy took on the
role as my protector and knew what was best for me.&nbsp; She watched
my every move.&nbsp; I swear at night as she slept beside my bed, she
synchronized her breathing with mine.&nbsp; She was my "golden girl"
and her eyes lit up every time I told her she was the "best girl in the
whole world."<br>
One night shortly after her passing, I awoke, sat up and saw Taffy
coming toward me.&nbsp; I was filled with joy and reached out for
her.&nbsp; She looked peaceful and happy, but simply walked past me,
out through the sunroom, and through her doggie dog, although it has
since been covered up.<br>
I truly believe she was telling me that she is happy, healthy and no
longer suffering.&nbsp; I still miss her and feel her presence every
day.<br>

yrs before and stuff scattered across the floor like the bible and sum
crucifixes a gold cross and an old teddy he used to love.It was also
very cold in the house.... We no he died unhappy hiding something but
we dont no what?<br>
also i was at my home and i remember one night and it went all cold
just how it felt at my nans and i saw little black dog like things on
the floor and a dark shadow standing by my door it muttered in a voice
like jibberish then i understood i heard it say Brenda (my nans name)

East Detroit (now Eastpointe), MI<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
By: jjoanneb@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
When I was 3 years old, my parents bought this old house.&nbsp;
Everyone called it the 'big house'.&nbsp; It was definately haunted!<br>
When I was 4 or 5, my parents constructed another bedroom for
themselves.&nbsp; I inherited theirs.&nbsp; I slept alone in a full
sized bed.<br>
A man dressed in the era of Dickens would sit at the foot of my bed
with his head down, then turn and look at me over his left
shoulder.&nbsp; He would repeat this and eventually stand up and walk
over to the left side of my bed.&nbsp; I could feel his legs pressing
against the side of the bed.&nbsp; He would then take the cape of his
coat, start at my feet and draw it up along my body toward my
face.&nbsp; Just before he would cover my eyes, he was gone.&nbsp; He
came alot.&nbsp; I was afraid.&nbsp; Who could he be?<br>
Years later, after moving out west, my mom told me an old man died in the house.<br>
Also, two other women saw this man in two different locations - northern CA and southern CA.<br>
My cousin said she saw angels circuling around the top of the
house.&nbsp; Three other siblings admited years later that they thought
the house was haunted.<br>
If you would like more information on this house and the property behind it, that my parents also owned, you may contact me.<br>

Another Queen Mary Ghost Experience<br>
<br>
By: ebauer@premiercarriagetrade.com<br>
<br>
This happened when I was 9 or 10 years old. (I'm now 42) Before I even heard any stories that the Queen Mary was haunted.<br>
My father took the family to stay overnight on the Queen Mary one weekend.<br>
We did the usual touring stuff during the day. Nothing unusual
happened, even when the encounter occurred, it didn't seem unusal at
the time.<br>
We had a suite that we stayed in. One connecting room for my two
brothers and I stayed in my parents suite which had a connecting maids
room, my room for the night, which opened directly out to the hallway.
I awoke early, maybe 5am to the maid entering the room. I sat up a
little, not the least bit afraid, just wondering why the maid was
entering the room. She was dressed in the old fashioned maid attire,
black long dress, white apron, and the funny maid hat. She saw me
sitting up and leaned over at the foot of my bed and put her finger to
her lips and ssshhhh'd me as if letting me know that I should not be
bothered and to go back to sleep. She was carrying towels or clothes.
She then entered my parents room. I laid back down and must have gone
back to sleep. I never heard or saw her leave. Which had to be back
through my little room unless she left through my brothers connecting
room.<br>
I would have never mentioned the maid encounter, except while we were
all getting ready to go to breakfast, as we exited to the hallway from
my room, I saw the maids working, cleaning the other rooms off the
hallway. They were wearing modern maids uniforms. The uniforms were
solid grey. No apron, no hat at all?? So I commented to my parents that
'the maid who went in your room this morning was wearing an old
fashioned maids outfit.' My mom gave me this questioning look and said
she never called the maid this morning and never saw a maid in their
room. I then explained what I had seen to my family. They assumed I was
dreaming. I know I wasn't. She was so solid and had opened the door.<br>
I have had numerous ghostly encounters before this one and after, but
usually I never saw the ghosts just felt the presence or the ghost's
were fuzzy, transparent, or a dark shadow entity. I've chosen not to
'see'<br>
anymore, and haven't had an encounter since my mid twenties.<br>

Hilton Head<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
<br>
As a child in the early 80s on Hilton Head Island, I learned to ride my
bike on the hard packed sand of the beach which we lived near. One
time, I was riding down close to the waters edge at high-tide and out
of the corner of my eye appeared a long, black serpentine figure which
rose up out of the water to a height roughly comparable to my head,
when seated on the bike. It freaked my out pretty bad, as a kid and I
peddled faster, but noticed it kept pace with me for several minutes
before disappearing. It's body would have been similar in circumference
to the while end of a baseball bat -- perhaps slightly wider. The
weirdest thing was that it was so close that it's body had to be very
thin in order to move along the shallow water close to the dry sand. <br>

Ghost Experiences<br>
<br>
<br>
By: elgodo1_@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Wanted to share some of my experiences with everyone.&nbsp; The first
being when I moved into my grandparents house after my grandfather
passed on.&nbsp; I moved intot he house with my parents in 1998, I was
16 at the time.<br>
My mom, as well as myself, would smell home baked food in my parents room.&nbsp; <br>
This went on for about a year or so.&nbsp; I would always feel a
presence in the house when I was alone.&nbsp; Never a fear, it was
always comforting.&nbsp; It seemed to go away till I had my ex-fiancee
in my room.&nbsp; She would come over, and <br>
we'd lock ourselves in in the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; The feeling, to me anyway, came back.&nbsp; <br>
Again comforting, but watching what we did.&nbsp; It has since seemed to go back to an occasional feeling.<br>
Another experience I've had was at the West Virginia State Pennetentary
in Moundsville, WV in October 2004.&nbsp; I went there as staff for the
radio station I worked for. It was a grand prize trip for listeners,
and of course, staff was needed.&nbsp; We had taken a tour of the
facility, and after had a scavenger hunt for the listeners.&nbsp; This
is when my first experiance happend.&nbsp; Myself and my ex-fiancee,
who had come with me, since we had space on the tour, we're in the old
visiters entrance in North Wing.&nbsp; I had thought I heard someone
coming, and assuming it was a listener, I said to my ex, let's scare
them.&nbsp; I turned off my flashlight and we walked into the
turnstyle.&nbsp; We heard this lound BANG! and she grabbed me and we
went running out of the building.&nbsp; Well, she went running,
dragging me.<br>
Later in the night, I had gone with some of the staff on a ghost
hunt.&nbsp; We were in the Hole, where a man was killed brutally. We
had turned off our flashlights, and tried to see if we could see/feel a
presence.&nbsp; I saw a white figure manifest and change shapes on the
wall in front of me.&nbsp; One of our staff said she had seen some
green orbs on the oppasite wall.&nbsp; Overall, I felt like I was being
watched the entire time I was in the prison, and not in a good
way.&nbsp; The place gave off a evil vibe.<br>
Another note about the prison.&nbsp; The previous year, which I did not
attend, our then promotions director was being followed around by a
shadow figure with a top hat in the psyc ward.&nbsp; This was supposed
to have been photographed, though I never saw the pic.&nbsp; I also
cannot confirm this, but I wanted to share the story that I was told.<br>
I have had a couple other experiences, I'll share them with everyone later.&nbsp; <br>
Thanks for taking the time to read this.<br>

House in Tennessee<br>
<br>
<br>
By: lesatalley@bellsouth.net<br>
<br>
The year was 1989 and my mother had been living in a house in
Tennessee. She was asleep one night and for some odd reason she woke up
and there was a man standing in her doorway. Nobody lived in the house
except her and I wasn't born yet so it had to be a ghost. She said that
he had something in his hand and that you could tell he was mad.
Another night she awoke again and saw the same man except this time he
was standing at the foot of her bed. Whenever she moved or made a noise
when he was around he would disappear. My aunt has also lived in that
house before and she saw the same man my mother had seen but, my mother
and her hadn't even talked about it before so my aunt couldn't of
imagined something. Eventually my mother moved away from that house.<br>

Haunting at Wal-Mart<br>
<br>
<br>
By: tinastuff@bellsouth.net<br>
<br>
I work at a Wal-Mart super center when I worked in the domestics
department on one corner I would go by the last bath towel would always
be messed up and I would have to straighten it over and over again, the
girl who worked there before me said the same thing happened to her too
and sometimes the towel would fall off the shelf and each time there
would be no one around.<br>
And one night I had to go behind lay-away and I was the only one back
there and I felt like someone was looking at me and and I turned around
and I seen this man, he looked like someone from the 50's his hair
slicked back and a white tee shirt with his sleeves roll up and jeans
but I could see thru him.<br>
So I went sraight away back into the lay-a-way department and I said I
can't beleive that, and the girl who worked back there in lay-away said
you seen him did'nt you and i said who and she said the guy in the
white tee shirt and jeans she said people see him<br>
all the time.<br>
And now I work in the craft and fabric department and when I am back
there by myself I see people standing by the fabric like they are
looking at the fabric and they disapear when I see them.<br>
But I have to work and none of them have scared me that much yet, alot
of people's lives were coming to Wal-Mart so they would have someone to
talk to but none of the spirit's has spoke to me yet.<br>

A First Hand Experience<br>
<br>
<br>
By: germ1134@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
*I have been a fan of your site for almost 4 years. I found your site
while searching for Archbishop Prendergast Hauntings. I decided to
elaborate on the small article you have in your Pennsylvania Hunting&#8217;s<br>
section.*<br>
This is a true account of events that took place in October of 2002
near Philadelphia Pennsylvania in a town called Drexel Hill. This
experience led me to your site because the site of the haunting is
actually listed on your Haunted Places Index. <br>
The towns name is Drexel Hill. The place was Archbishop Prendergast
High School in 2002. The school drama department was putting on a
production of Les Mis&eacute;rables. I had landed a part as a student
in the show. This part demanded a lot of time to be spent at the
school. That is how I, and a few of my friends, happened upon an
experience that conjured up a lot of supernatural events in the
following weeks. <br>
First, I&#8217;ll give a little background of the school.<br>
It was built on the old Drexel estate, an estate that belonged to
Blessed Katherine Drexel&#8217;s family. The 33-acre land was purchased a
wealthy man and housed him as his home until a fire claimed the
building and ultimately caused him to sell the land. In 1920, the land
became the site for the St. Vincent&#8217;s Orphanage.<br>
A small part of the school has not been converted from the orphanage.
Some rooms that housed the orphans are still used in the school for
storage. The orphanage lasted until 1956, when the site became
Archbishop Prendergast Catholic Boys high school. Since then, it has
become an all girls sister school to Monsignor Bonner high school for
boys, which is located right next door.&nbsp; <br>
Several stories have been passed along the campus over the years: an
orphan who killed another orphan, a nun that hung herself in the bell
tower, and a drama teacher that haunts the auditorium. I have no
information either discerning or confirming these stories, but I do
know that something otherworldly is happening at this school.<br>
We&#8217;ll return back to the year 2002, where Prendie is putting on its
production of Les Mis&eacute;rables. I was a junior at Bonner that year
and like I said, I had landed a principal part in the play. Practices
for principal parts are generally held in the music director&#8217;s personal
room dubbed &#8220;The Little Black Box,&#8221; because the small room&#8217;s walls are
all painted black. Earlier that year, Prendie&#8217;s administration decided
to get rid of some of the windows left over from the orphanage because
they were causing cold air to enter the building. To do this, the
contractors needed access to the 3rd floor orphanage. All entrances
have been sealed off because the stairs leading to the orphanage have
since rotted away and become unstable. An access point housed in the
Little Black Box was blocked off by a large board over the door that
was painted black to match the walls. If you weren&#8217;t looking for it,
you would never know it was there. In October of 2002, the board was
pulled away so contractors could enter the orphanage to replace the
windows. That was how we found our entrance to the &#8220;haunted&#8221; 3rd floor
orphanage. <br>
Some of the students in the show, principal parts with a lot of songs
to learn, had an early practice one night. Two of my friends at the
time, Mike and Ryan, decided just to stay after school and wait for
practice to begin. While sitting around the Little Black Box with a
friend of ours named Michelle, we saw the exposed door that leads
upstairs. We didn&#8217;t see any harm in going upstairs if we took to the
stairs one at a time, which is just what we did. The hallway upstairs
wasn&#8217;t anything special. A long, green carpeted corridor with about 4
doors on each side that lead down to a larger area filled with desks.
What made everything less interesting was the fact that the contractors
had left their Coca-Cola cups and magazines up lying around in the
hallway. We went to one of the rooms on the left side of the hallway,
which lead to an old bathroom with one of those tubs that wasn&#8217;t built
into the wall. Next to the tub was a filing case filled with test
papers from the 1980&#8217;s.<br>
While Michelle was looking over these, Ryan pushed me and Mike out into
the hallway giggling to himself. We ran across the hall and hid behind
a door in one of the other rooms. A few seconds later we heard Michelle
demanding to know where we were and yelling that this wasn&#8217;t funny. The
three of us were huddled in the small room that could have once been a
bedroom, trying not to make a sound and trying even harder not to
laugh. Luckily we didn&#8217;t need to laugh, because four or five little
girls in the room next to us decided to do it for us. While trying to
stay as quiet as we could be, the three of us distinctly heard a group
of little girls in the room next to us giggling loudly.<br>
As I looked up to make sure my colleagues heard what I heard, I saw all the color drained from their faces.<br>
Ryan was the first one out of the room, running like a bat out of hell
at the still hysterical Michelle urging her to get downstairs as fast
as possible. Mike and I were not far behind. When we were downstairs
and breathless, we told anyone we could what happened.<br>
That wasn&#8217;t the last experience or my last time up in the orphanage.<br>
Once word of our little adventure happened, everyone got ghost fever at
the school. This was understandable being that it was October. Mostly,
everyone just wanted to see the upstairs but were afraid to go up
without one of the four that was originally up there.<br>
After that night, strange things began to happen. Ryan was eating
dinner with two of the actresses, Erica and Kathy, in the Black Box
when they heard a small voice at the top of the stairs. As they
listened, the sound happened again and closer. They distinguished it as
a child&#8217;s voice whispering, &#8220;help me.&#8221; When the voice began shouting,
they left the room and didn&#8217;t return that night. Erica has just now
confirmed to me that this did happen.<br>
One night, the choral director pulled me, Mike and Ryan aside and told
us to stop what we were doing to stir up the spirits. He had been
spending long nights designing sets for the show and often slept at the
school. He told us there was a small girl who followed him around the
school named Lily. Lily was not alive.<br>
Ever since they took the windows from the top floor, her usual
bluish-white aura had been replaced with a red one. He said now was not
the time to be doing what we were doing up there because Lily was
angry. He had brought a priest down to the black box to see if he could
bless it, but the priest would not go near the room. <br>
That was the time I decided to do some research. While scanning for any
info at all, I came upon the Prendie story in the haunted places index
at Theshadowlands.net. I found ghost-hunting tips among the actual
article on Prendie. I printed these out and showed it to the other
students one night during practice. One student, Jim, wanted to see
what was happening first hand. The next night, he bought a disposable
camera and he and I along with Mike went upstairs. This was my last
time up there. My small band of ghost enthusiasts walked down the dark
hallway snapping pictures as we walked along. Near the end of the film,
we heard a noise in the room that was full of desks. One of the desks
had fallen over. That was it for us. We ran the rest of the way back
downstairs not bothering to go one at a time on the steps. Pieces of
the rotted steps rained down on the floor. As I was running through the
hidden doorway, Jim snapped a picture of me and thus finished the film
in the camera. The next day while I was at my house, Jim called me
shaken up. &#8220;Germ (my nickname),&#8221; Jim said desperately, &#8220;you have to see
these. There&#8217;s orbs in every single picture and shapes in a lot from
upstairs.&#8221; He stopped by my house and showed me the pictures. Sure
enough, he wasn&#8217;t lying. I had read on TSL that orbs signified that
there were spirits in your picture. But among the orbs were some
vaguely human shapes as well. The picture I was mostly interested in
was the one he snapped of me running back into the Black Box. In this
picture, my entire body was covered with orbs large and small. That
night at practice, we passed the pictures around to whoever wanted to
see them. By the end of the long night, we were unable to locate the
pictures again. The next day, we found the pictures sleeve with the
pictures at the foot of the stage. Every picture was water damaged.
Nothing about them was distinguishable. It did not rain the night
before. <br>
After that happened, I decided to take our choral director&#8217;s advice and
stop going upstairs. As far as I know, nothing to noteworthy happened
after that October. The door in the Little Black Box has been sealed
back up, but there is still an entrance through the boiler room. If I
receive any more information on this subject, I&#8217;ll be sure to send it.
Unfortunately, due to conditions beyond my control, I have no photo
evidence of what happened that October, but I do have eyewitness
accounts and my own story, which I can give you as my word, is all
true. <br>

My Ghostly Experience<br>
<br>
By: clj528@bellsouth.net<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
this may sound hard to believe, but i came face to face with Harriet
Tubman and other members of the underground railroad recently in a city
called Cochran, Ga. i was walking down a dark road one night and i
heard something behind me that shook me out of the daze i was in. at
first i thought it was a dog or some other kind of animal so i
immediately got in my defensive mode ready to counterattack the animals
charge when i heard voices. this shocked me because at 2:20 a.m. most
of this city was asleep and the ones that weren't were at the 24 hour
gas station. yes this city is that small. anyway, when i went to search
for the source of the voices i was astonished to see a group of about
30 men, women, and children coming out of a section of woods
approximately 30 yards from where i was standing. at first i thought i
was dreaming but i was wide awake since i mostly sleep during the day.
as the group moved closer into my eyesight i saw in greater detail the
clothes they were wearing. they were wearing the rags i had often seen
depicted as slave garments. their clothes looked tattered and torn and
they wore no shoes. they also carried torches to light their path. as
they still moved closer to where i was standing one of the "slaves"
motioned for me to follow them. as i walked over towards the group, i
realized what was going on. i walked with this group of "slaves" in the
exact path taken over 400 years ago when they escaped the cotton fields
in search of freedom. i had made it about 10 miles walking through
swamps and marsh when my girlfriends family had found me. at that
moment the ghosts disappeared, but they returned every night at the
exact same time. they walk aimlessly the same path that led to their
deaths as lost souls forever stuck to walk the earth searching for
their freedom. that is my story of a real close encounter with
ghosts.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

Newport Oregon Home<br>
<br>
By: meadowlark@easilink.com<br>
<br>
<br>
In 1970 my new husband and I purchased and moved in to an adorable
older home that we thought looked like a storybook cottage.&nbsp; We
had fun fixing it up in "our" style.&nbsp; In one of the upstairs
bedroom, we installed a "budsidan" (Buddhist altar) because I was, at
that time, in Nicherin-Shoshu Buddhism.&nbsp; <br>
Little by little I became more and more depressed, into despair -- a
new bride!&nbsp; When I was painting the aforementioned bedroom closet,
I had a strong sense of sadness and despair, that someone else had
worked there in the same way but was very despondent.<br>
After a few months, a "white witch" with whom we were acquainted took a
walk and told us that an "essence" still roamed, and that we had
installed the budsidan where her baby had been.&nbsp; The baby had
died.&nbsp;&nbsp; We moved the butsidan but I still felt very very low.<br>
Cottie, the "white witch" had me collect a few essential things, and
one evening, while a party was going on downstairs, she first warned
the essence to go on, and then did what she needed to do to cleanse the
house.<br>
I did not know when she went upstairs to do the warning, but when we
compared notes later, I had experienced a sense of a heavy burden of
grief being lifted, at approximately the same period of time.&nbsp; In
the days following, I felt better, my "euphoria" returned, and we
enjoyed the house until we moved in a year or two.<br>
It also came to our attention that every couple that lived there in
times recently preceding and following us became divorced.&nbsp; We
divorced in 1973, were married again and divorced in 1989.&nbsp; We are
still friends and several people could verify my story.<br>
By 1971 I also left Nicherin-Shoshu Buddhism, because I feel in this lifetime Christianity is right for me! <br>

Occasional Unexplained Experiences in my Life<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Marklx61@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I wanted to tell someone of a few of the experiences I have had in my
life. Although they are probably not a big deal to most, to me it
marked the beginning of my interest in all things, Mysterious, Occult,
Unusual and/or Unexplained.<br>
When I was an infant, my mom came into to check on me, because I had
been quiet for a long time and she found my head in a puddle of blood.
There were no wounds on my body anywhere and there was no other
evidence of blood, except for the puddle underneath my head. At the age
of four, I was sitting and eating a bowl of fruitloops one morning and
the phone rang, when my dad asked my mother who was on the phone, I
simply remarked that Grandma died. After my mother got off the phone,
and my dad discovered I was right, I received the belt for upsetting my
mother. At the age of 11, I noticed a presence in my bedroom that I
could not see, but could feel watching me, nothing ever happened or
materialized, but the sense of that presence stayed for many years. I
slept with my head under the covers out of fear for a long time. Many
years later, finding out that a man had shot and killed his wife and
then committed suicide there.<br>
At the age of 12-13 yrs. old, I woke up one morning to find that there
was coffee brewing on the stove when My mother and father awoke, just a
minute or two before I did. The coffee was waiting for them and there
was no one else in the house.<br>
Once at about 19 years old, the water suddenly came on in the bathtub
and it was running full blast, no one could get it to turn off, so my
mom called a plumber. About 20 minutes later, the plumber arrived and
proceeded to go under the house. After nearly 10 minutes the water in
the tub stopped and the plumber came out from under the house and my
mother exclaimed, "I don't know what you did, but it worked." The
plumber responded, "That's odd, I didn't do anything, I couldn't find
anything wrong". This happened twice, but the second time it stopped
before a plumber could be contacted.<br>
During the same year in early January, my sister was awakened by
someone banging on the glass of the window near her bed. My father
later told me that my sister was very frightened, so he got his gun and
went outside. A fresh blanket of snow was on the ground and it was
still snowing lightly. No person was ever seen and there were no
footprints to be found other than the ones my father made.<br>
A couple of years ago, I was sitting in my bedroom and the curtains
were drawn back to allow for sunshine. When I saw a young boy running
hard and fast towards my back door. My first thought was that "I had
better get to the door before he does or he may knock it down, because
someone is in desperate need of help". When I got to the door no one
was around, I checked around the building and up and down the streets.
There was no one there. Later, I had a mental evaluation that shows
that I am not psychotic nor am I having hallucinations.<br>
About 8 years ago, I was asleep and woke to what sounded to me to be
someone breaking into the house by smashing in our sliding glass doors.
I awoke alarmed and with my heart racing and there were no intruders. I
checked all the rooms and came to the bathroom where a small 8 x 10 in
a lightweight frame was lying in the middle of the floor upside down. I
expected to see broken glass when I turned the picture over, but the
glass was not even cracked. Four years ago, I was pushed aside by an
invisible presence in an old plantation house, where the people living
there had recorded strange evp's. Over the past few years, I have had
appliances suddenly start or stop working. Also, myself, a couple of
family members and one friend have heard the sound of&nbsp; paper
rustling in the corners of different rooms and the sounds of broken
glass that is never explained. I also have some weird tendency to blow
light bulbs when I turn them on.<br>
I do have some precognitive abilities and I once dreamed a certain
person was going to drown and three years later they did, but I don't
claim to be a psychic or special in any paranormal way. I have just
accepted these types of happenings, (of which there are more) and have
never been harmed in anyway. I hope to learn that there are others like
me, who experience these things as being rather normal and benign.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Spirit At Lincoln College<br>
<br>
<br>
By: reneeslack@sbcglobal.net<br>
<br>
Hello My name is Renee . I was a student at Lincoln College and
graduated in 2004 from the school. I lived in The Olin Sang Dormitory
both years of schooling because I was a an RA. (this dorm is typically
a freshman only dorm.<br>
I Confirm the presence of a spririt(s) in the building. When I was
there my lap top would begin to write strange sentences, on it's own.
The sentences would appear in MS Word in two to three word spirts. It
was not the case of viruses because the computer was brand new when I
had first brought it there (untainted if you will) Several other
residents had wittnessed this. Then When I left for breaks/ Summer
breaks The bizarr typing would stopp. When I returned my sophomore year
the bizarr typing began again. Most often the typing would occur when I
stayed up late into the evening/ early morning. Also the infrared port
on my computer was turned off so it was not a matter of some one
messing with me.<br>
Another case of haunting on the campus that is not already mentioned it
the Art Studio. The building is an old one room school house.The
basement of the building is home to the darkroom. As the&nbsp; building
manager I spent Alot of time in the building at all hours of the day
and night. When closing up the building myself and other managers would
hear strange voices coming from within the dark room. When I I looked
inside or knocked to investigate the noise no one would answer or was
present. The back print room light will randomly flicker on and off
when you re enter the room and near the back corner of it.&nbsp; And
late at night once the building is all locked up, from across the
street at the gas station or in the jimmy johns parking lot a strange
light can be seen from the bell tower, to wich there is a non acessable
pull down stair. <br>
Our Art teacher had alsomentioned unexplained human shadows, and missing art material.<br>

Stockton CA Hotel Ghost<br>
<br>
By: Celticladyfair@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
One thing, a fluke.&nbsp; Two things, one heck of a coinsidence.&nbsp; Three and four things, ok... this might be a ghost.<br>
On my way back from Seattle to Los Angeles (Home) over Thanksgiving
holiday, I stopped at a Motel 6 in Stockton, CA for the night.&nbsp;
Not the greatest of hotels, but it would suffice.&nbsp; Four
'incidents' occurred that evening that lead me to conclude the room
might have been haunted.<br>
About 11:30 pm, I heard what sounded like someone slipping paper
underneath my door.&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning on the lights, I see nothing
there at the door, or nearby it.<br>
At 1:36 AM, my cell phone light turned on by itself.&nbsp; I would have
to touch it to make the light turn on, or a phone call would need to be
coming in.&nbsp; Neither applied here.&nbsp; It's never done that
before or after this incident.<br>
At about 2 AM, I felt a 'thumb' brush my forehead, as if to push back my hair from my eyes.&nbsp; No one there.<br>
And at about 2:30 AM, I&nbsp; heard something 'fall over'.&nbsp;
Getting up and looking about, nothing fell.&nbsp; It was definitely in
my room, not in an adjoining room.<br>
Room 225 off the 5 FWY (Stockton Center exit) if anyone is intersted in
researching.... not threatening by any means, but definitely someone
wanted my attention.<br>

First Time was at a Birthday<br>
<br>
By: luvalwyz102383@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
The first time I remember having experiences was when I was about 12 or
13. My cousin and some friends had went over to a friend's house for
her birthday. We were all sitting in the living room listening to music
and I felt this heavy presence enter the room but I thought nothing of
it and thought it was just my head playing tricks. That night when we
went to bed all of us girls were in my friend's room and her younger
brothers slept in the room next to her room. Everyone was asleep and I
heard light footsteps coming up the stairs and in the playroom just
outside the room. One figure entered our room, it was a girl about 6 or
so and she came up the end of the bed I was in and just stood there
looking at me. I heard my friend's youngest brother start to cry. The
other figure, a boy of about 4 was in their room and it frightened her
brother.<br>
Years passed and I didn't notice anything until I started dating this
guy. He moved in with his best friend and their room was near the
upstairs attic.We were moving stuff in one day and I was putting
something in the attic and it was freezing it there but it was the
middle of the summer. Something was drawing me back to the back of the
attic but it didn't feel right. I left and never told him what I felt.
A couple of months later I was laying in bed and I felt a figure walk
out of the room next to the attic and just turn and look at me. I was
so tired I just pulled closer to my boyfriend and tried to fall asleep.<br>
Then I didn't feel anything for a while. Just recently a friend of mine
was talking about a graveyard near her house. I have lived in this town
nearly my entire life and I had never heard of this graveyard or it's
story. We went ere one night just me, her, and my boyfriend. My
boyfriend is able to feel and see spirits just like I am so he wanted
to go and explore the graveyard. The graveyard is surrounded by trees
and a river runs to the south of it. My boyfriend got about halfway
back towards a clearing that leads to the river and I started to get
the feeling that someone was watching us from that clearing. I called
to my boyfriend to come back to the car and as he was on his way back I
got the feeling that whatever was watching us was just behind the tree
line to the west of the cemetary which was near the front of my car.
The spirit kept moving. It went from the trees back to a double tree
that is in the middle of the cemetary and then to a big headstone near
the road that runs by the entrance of the cemetary and then back to the
trees. We sat there for a few more minutes in my car just looking into
the cemetary. When I started my car to leave the spirit walked up along
the side of my car (from the trees infront of&nbsp; my car) to my
drivers side window. My window was down and I felt it get colder
suddenly and then I saw him. He was a man in his mid 30s to 40s dressed
in 19th century clothes with a black dress coat and pants, a tall top
hat and a walking cane. His hair was short and black and he was about 6
foot tall. His eyes were green and cat-like. He bent down and looked
into my car at all three of us in turn but lastly at me. I drove off
breathing sorta hard but he appeared in my dreams that night. At first
I thought I was imagining things since I had never actually seen any of
them before just felt them. But it was so detailed. I went to work the
next day and was recounting the story to a friend of mine and she
looked at me and asked if I knew the story behind 13 Graves. Of course
I hadn't so she proceeded to tell me that the family that haunts that
grave consists of a grandma, grandpa, mother, father, and nine
children. They all died from a disease but she's not sure which one.
It's said that if you walk back t the older graves down near the river
and stand on the river bank and look back at the graveyard you can see
the whole family standing there. There have been reports of hearing
children cry and seeing the grandma sitting in a rocking chair near one
of the graves but never had anyone that I know of had the same
expierence that I did. To this day he is still calling me back to the
graveyard. I think he wants to talk or needs help. He's not
threatening... just curious just like the rest of us.<br>

Strange Lights On The Lonely Road<br>
<br>
By: Jrlr2@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I was driving on Interstate 15 from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in March 2005.<br>
It was early in the morning around 3 am.&nbsp; I am alone in the Mojave
Desert on the north side of Baker California.&nbsp; Cars and trucks
were not as plentiful on the road as they were when I had left the Los
Angeles area.<br>
The night was dark and it was cold outside.&nbsp; I first saw a light
that came from the East which was on my right, it dipped almost to the
road and up again directly in front of me.&nbsp; It went off to the
West.&nbsp; The light did this several times and for several minutes
making these dips.<br>
At first I thought it was headlights from a distant vehicle.&nbsp; This was not case.<br>
A second light appeared, following the first light and did the same thing that the first light did.&nbsp; <br>
To say the least, I was shaken.&nbsp; I had my car radio playing on a
station that I could receive clearly in the desert, as the lights
dipped to the road in front of me the radio went crazy with
static.&nbsp; I turned the radio off and when the lights came around
again there was no sound at all from these lights.<br>
The best that I can explain about the color was they were a bright whitish light no other color that I could make out.<br>
My car was running with no problem or disruption. The whole time that the lights played with me was about 35 minutes.<br>
The last that I saw was they went off to the Northwest of where I was.<br>
I wonder if anyone has experienced the same thing as I did.&nbsp; No I was not drinking.<br>

The Little Girl<br>

I am just writing to say i love your site and it has encouraged me to
share my story. To this day i still cant say that i saw what i saw for
definite but im very very sure i saw something that night! Basically,
ill explain that my little sister always used to come in my room and
sleep either in my bed or on my floor, this one night i was lying in
bed and i woke up to hear someone in my room so i was saying my sisters
name over again and she wasnt answering. I used to put all my cuddly
toys which were on my bed during the day on the floor at the foot of my
bed. I heard some noise down there and thought this a bit strange as my
sister wouldnt be able to sleep there as the space was too small! I got
out of bed and turned on my light and my sister wasnt there and the
house was in silence as EVERYONE was ASLEEP! I got back into bed with
my light still on and lay down facing the wall, i was wide awake at
this point and trying to sleep so i turned round facing into my room
and standing by my bed was a little girl! I remember her as having
blonde hair and her lips were moving as if she was talking but no sound
was coming out. This is the wierdest thing now; I actually got up out
of bed and turned my light OFF! I have always been unnerved but
intrigued by the paranormal and always and still think i would have a
heart attack if i saw a ghost but i cant believe i actually went to
sleep after turning my light off. I have never seen her since but i
always wonder who it was and what she was trying to say?! Thanks for
reading my story. <br>

Wolf Creek Oregon<br>
<br>
<br>
By: rob.harrington@wc.threerivers.k12.or.us<br>

I have really been enjoying the ghosts and hauntings site, and one
story really has caught my attention.&nbsp; It was the story that made
the national news, with the story about the vampire attacking the two
hikers at the Wolf Creek Inn.&nbsp; I was wondering if you happen to
know the year that occured.&nbsp; I have searched the internet, but no
luck.&nbsp; That story was even a trivia question on the Jackson County
Library website.&nbsp; I may need to continue my search at the
library.&nbsp; <br>
I had an odd experience in April.&nbsp; I teach at the Wolf Creek
School, and it is about 100 yards from the inn.&nbsp; One early
morning, about 6:30 AM, I was working at my desk, when I saw a figure
all in black, with a black hood, walk by my window.&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw
it for about 2 seconds, and then there was a banging on the
wall&gt;&nbsp; I went outside, and no one was there.&nbsp; I was the
only one at the school, and the area was deserted.&nbsp; I have not
shared that story with anyone, but it was an odd/spooky
experience.&nbsp; At one tiem, we had a custodian that told me that
doors would shut when no one was near, even after they were blocked
open.&nbsp; <br>
Anyway, I just wanted to share the experience, and see if you knew any more about the Wolf Creek "vampire."&nbsp; <br>

The Phone Call from the Other Side<br>
<br>
<br>
By: telfanyftelfanyferguson@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
Well my story starts about three years ago when my cousin got killed.
Well this really tore me up, so as always i have always believed in the
supernatural. So it had been about two weeks after his passing and he
always stayed on my mind.that night it was raining and i did not have a
telephone at the time but i had the telephone it was sitting on a table
wrapped up with the cords wrapped around it ,they were not in the wall
,it was not a problem with the phone because it was not hooked up.so i
told my nephew to watch after my two daughterswhile i go across the
street to use my neighbors phone.so while i am gone my nephew said my
phone rung,so i fused at him thinking he was lieing. So you know i am
mad because its raining out side really hard and i had to go use
someones phone so i told him that it could not have rung because my
phone is not even in service,so how did it ring and he said auntie i
dont know but it did and right before i left i was thinking about my
cousin,and just saying to my self .i said fred if you have made it to
the other side send me a sign or something to let me know you are okay.
Do you think maybe it was fred calling me.<br>

What Did He Go Through?<br>
<br>
By: jwalzngems@yahoo.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I am 32 years old and live in India. <br>
I was married to an Air Force pilot .&nbsp; He was perfect in many
ways-very intelligent, lovable and very dear to everyone around
him.&nbsp; He was excellent in all indoor and outdoor games-squash,
table tennis, badminton, cricket, carom, chess and so on. He would
excel in his job, too.&nbsp; We were happily married and after two
years of marriage, we were blessed with this angelic girl baby.&nbsp; I
thought God loves me very much for he blessed me with this beautiful
baby.&nbsp; <br>
But ten months later my husband died in an air crash.&nbsp; Needless to
say, I was shattered.&nbsp; But I still remember those last few months
of togetherness.&nbsp; We were happy, but there was this unexplainable
sadness inside me-like as if something was going to happen.&nbsp; In
the early morning hours I used to hear footsteps of someone in their
shoes walking around the house.&nbsp; I would search in all rooms,
thinking my husband probably returned home early, but there would be no
one.&nbsp; I remember this drove me so crazy that I even asked my
neighbor if they heard this noise.&nbsp; They did not.&nbsp; Then one
day, as I was folding clothes in the bedroom, I saw an aircraft burning
in fire and coming down with great noise, in my peripheral vision. When
I turned to take a direct look at it, there was nothing.&nbsp; I ran
out of the house, went to the terrace, and saw a clear sky.&nbsp; I was
baffled.&nbsp; That was the time I thought I had gone bonkers. <br>
These and many more strange incidents finally culminated with the
tragic death of my husband alongwith twenty other people.&nbsp; But
what intrigues me even today was my meeting with a stranger immediately
after my husband's death.&nbsp; This lady who apparently was
clairvoyant was totally unknown to me in the crowd.&nbsp; She suddenly
comes to me says that she must convey some message to me.&nbsp; She
said, "Look, he will not let me go unless I tell you
this...whatever...I do not know if this makes any sense to you...but he
says he has reached a transcendental level and is safe...you do not
have to worry about him...also he says it was similar to reaching
sexual climax, but much more."<br>
Was it really my husband saying those things? What did he mean by transcendental?&nbsp; What did he go through...after death?<br>
