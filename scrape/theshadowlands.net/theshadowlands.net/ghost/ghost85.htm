<P>
<P><B>Hi, first of all, thank you for putting this website up.  This is great.
 I </B>
<P><B>am the icequeeny2k and I have lived in what I have read about as being
one </B>
<P><B>of the most haunted spots in the country, if not the world.  I live
in a </B>
<P><B>small college town in SE Ohio, known as Athens.  I have lived in the
county </B>
<P><B>of Athens for 13 years and lived for ten years in an old stop-over
called </B>
<P><B>Meigs County.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am a very sensitive person.  Sensitive in all aspects, but particularily
</B>
<P><B>in the "unexplained" or "other activity".  I must be careful of how
I write </B>
<P><B>because if i say something in a demeaning way, it can have a powerful
</B>
<P><B>effect.  Here are my incidents over the past 20 years.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was three, I lived in Pomeroy, Ohio.  The house I lived was
an old </B>
<P><B>home and possibly a stop-over for the underground railroad.  Many bad
things </B>
<P><B>happened there before we moved in.  According to historians and local
towns </B>
<P><B>people, in the early 1900's, possibly the late 1800's, an old recluse
had </B>
<P><B>bought the house.  It was a beautiful two story house with an apartment
</B>
<P><B>upstairs and downstairs.  White outside with a top balcony.  Front
porch </B>
<P><B>columns were white with intricate woodwork.  This hermit was in his
thirtys </B>
<P><B>when he bought it and he had intentions of fixing this place up.  However,
</B>
<P><B>he suffered from severe depression and threw himself off the second
floor </B>
<P><B>balcony.  The house stood empty for years afterwards.  Eventually in
the </B>
<P><B>1920's, an older woman and her son bought the house and rented the
top floor </B>
<P><B>out.  This is where it gets a little fuzzy in the details.  Either
the woman </B>
<P><B>had driven her son to kill her then  commit suicide or they had formed
a </B>
<P><B>suicide pact.  The woman was found dead several days after her son
had died. </B>
<P><B>  Her son's body was found less than a mile from the house in a
field.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Several more years went by and the house remained empty.  It was crumbling
</B>
<P><B>and falling into disrepair.  Then an older gentleman moved into the
house.  </B>
<P><B>He had discovered that there was a gang of theives and drug addicts
living </B>
<P><B>behind the house up on a hillside.  He had turned over information
to the </B>
<P><B>police and was found dead by a neighbor several days later.  He had
been </B>
<P><B>shot through the chest.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The house had several occupants after that he had died, but it was
never </B>
<P><B>occupied for long.  We moved in in 1977.  Things were bad from the
minute we </B>
<P><B>had moved in.  Cups would come crashing out of the cupboard, lights
would </B>
<P><B>come on and off.  Seaseme Street would change to a soap opera.  Buckets
of </B>
<P><B>paint would mysteriously diappear.  However, my mom and dad were painting
</B>
<P><B>one of the bedroom peach and that paint seemed acceptable because it
</B>
<P><B>wouldn't disappear.  One night, I was three, I went over and climbed
into </B>
<P><B>bed with my mom and dad.  We were living in both parts of the house
and my </B>
<P><B>bedroom was one one side of the hall way and my aprents room was one
the </B>
<P><B>other side of the hall way.  The staircase was in the middle.  As I
was </B>
<P><B>going across the stairs, I heard someone call my name.  I looked down
and </B>
<P><B>there was an old woman standing ont he landing telling me to get back
into </B>
<P><B>bed.  She was wearing a brown and white, threadbare peasants dress,
black </B>
<P><B>and white ringed stockings and had a green scarf tied on her head.
 She </B>
<P><B>pointed her boney finger at me and told me to be quiet and go back
to bed.  </B>
<P><B>I ran into my parents room and cried.  My dad searched the house and
found </B>
<P><B>nothing except a coffee mug smashed in the kitchen.  He thought my
mom had </B>
<P><B>smashed it and just left it for later.  Mom looked at it the next day
and </B>
<P><B>said that it wasn't ours and didn't know where it came from.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next incident happened when we moved to Athens.  I was 19 and just
had a </B>
<P><B>baby.  I was living in my apartment in The Plains.  Nobody had told
me the </B>
<P><B>history of my apartment and since the apartments had been built, nothing
</B>
<P><B>strange had happened there.  I had a spirit.  It was on old man who
was </B>
<P><B>wonderful.  My apartment was the only one that had not been broken
into, my </B>
<P><B>daughter's room was either warm in the winter or cool in the summer.
 This </B>
<P><B>was a natural impossibility.  The sun set on my daughter's side of
the </B>
<P><B>window, so she always got the last bit of sun and it should have been
toasty </B>
<P><B>in there.  It wasn't.  It was almost as if we had airconditioning in
that </B>
<P><B>room.  We didn't have airconditioning at all.  In the winter, it was
hit </B>
<P><B>most brutal because the winds would whip into the side that faced her
room.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had proof.  One night, after classes, my boyfriend had put my daughter
to </B>
<P><B>bed then went to take his shower.  I was sitting on the floor in the
living </B>
<P><B>room working on homework.  All of the sudden, I heard footsteps coming
down </B>
<P><B>the steps.  They stopped when the you could see up the steps.  My boyfriend
</B>
<P><B>continued with is shower and figuring he didn't hear anything, I didn't
say </B>
<P><B>anything.  He came down and asked why I came upstairs and why was my
</B>
<P><B>daughter laughing in bed?   I told him that I didn't go upstairs and
I have </B>
<P><B>no idea why she was laughing.  All of the sudden we heard footsteps
pacing </B>
<P><B>in her room.  We went upstairs and looked.  There sat my daughter looking
at </B>
<P><B>us like we were stupid and pointing.  I felt a presence, but my boyfriend
</B>
<P><B>just shook his head and went back downstairs.  Later in the year, I
was </B>
<P><B>getting ready to go out one night when I kept feeling something watch
me and </B>
<P><B>play peek-a-boo with me.  I was the only one in the house.  I looked
up and </B>
<P><B>saw a shape that eventually turned into a man's form.  He looked at
me with </B>
<P><B>great pleasure and then left.  A few friends later saw him when we
returned. </B>
<P><B>  They had gone upstairs to use the bathroom and when they came down,
they </B>
<P><B>asked who the guy was in the bedroom.  I went upstairs and looked.
 I </B>
<P><B>thought he was a friend who had come in the back door and went upstairs.
 As </B>
<P><B>I went into her room, it was warm.  I loudly explained that my daughter
was </B>
<P><B>at her mama's house and she would be back the next night, he could
play </B>
<P><B>then.</B>
<P>
<P><B>On several ocassions, I felt an uneasiness in the house, like soemthing
</B>
<P><B>wasn't right.  I would check everything and make sure that someone
wasn't in </B>
<P><B>the apartment.  It would be, of course, empty.  Then I realized that
the man </B>
<P><B>was unhappy about something.  I would loudly say, if you want to live
here, </B>
<P><B>fine, just don't scare us or harm us.  The feeling would go away.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Currently, I am working in a building that used to be part of a very
bad </B>
<P><B>place where many people had died.</B>
<P><B>I have to be careful of what is said or done.  Strange things have
happened, </B>
<P><B>like light fixtures come crashing out of the ceiling, people laughing
when </B>
<P><B>there is no one in the building, and the most strangest one I have
heard.  </B>
<P><B>Living people experience the strangest mood changes in the oddest places.
 I </B>
<P><B>have a very good reason to believe this building is spirited by what,
at one </B>
<P><B>time, the insane.</B>

<P><B>The Whistling</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Aryn69@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Ok the house I live in now is haunted.  We've been living here for
about 10 </B>
<P><B>years now.  and ever since I was about 10 yrs old (I'm 19 now) I've
had </B>
<P><B>strange things happen to me.</B>
<P><B>The 1st thing I remember happening was one day me and my sister were
gonna go </B>
<P><B>roller skating and we needed to get some clean socks out of the laundry
room </B>
<P><B>which is in the garage.  So we both walked over to the door that lead
into </B>
<P><B>the garage and I noticed that it was locked.  So I reached down to
open it </B>
<P><B>and the dorrknob turned and opened on its own. And we just kind of
stood </B>
<P><B>there not knowing what was going on.  Then about 1 minute later a huge
stack </B>
<P><B>of boxes fell over.  And there was no wind or anything to make them
fall </B>
<P><B>over.   Other stuff thats happened...  we hear whistling all the time..
I </B>
<P><B>usually hear it when I'm up late at night on the computer. and the
weird thing </B>
<P><B>is that its always right in my left ear and sounds as if its contained
like </B>
<P><B>in a box or something.  Also my sister and me share a room and we
constantly </B>
<P><B>hear stuff happening back there.. for example:  whistling, the shower
door in </B>
<P><B>the back bathroom (which is attached to our room) I always hear what
sounds </B>
<P><B>like a razor being picked up and slammed back down . My closet which
is back </B>
<P><B>by the bathroom  .. the door never stays closed. And theres no possible
way </B>
<P><B>for it to just come open on its own because the doorknob broke off
and to </B>
<P><B>open it you really have to work with it.  One morning while everyone
else was </B>
<P><B>asleep my mom heard the door slam shut.  Also in my room theres my
piano and </B>
<P><B>on top of it is a zither (a musical instrument) and my dad was walking
</B>
<P><B>through to go take a shower and theres a little space to walk through
to get </B>
<P><B>to the bathroom and at the time the zither was sitting in its usual
spot on </B>
<P><B>the piano.. when he came out the zither was laying in the pathway.
 Other </B>
<P><B>times my parents hear the shower door acting up.. being slammed.  Most
of the </B>
<P><B>stuff that happens is to us kids like  one night I was up reading and
</B>
<P><B>everyone else was asleep and I got up to turn off the light and I got
back </B>
<P><B>into bed and I noticed a weird glow coming from the bathroom.  I just
thought </B>
<P><B>it was a nightlight thats in there.. so I sat there watching it for
a while </B>
<P><B>and all of a sudden I hear a loud click and it turns off.  So I'm freakin
out </B>
<P><B>and don't know what to do or think and then it comes on again. Then
goes off </B>
<P><B>again. And that goes on for about 2 hours till I finally get up the
courage </B>
<P><B>to start throwing things at my sister to wake her up.  So she wakes
up and </B>
<P><B>sees this and freaks out and so I start banging on the wall to wake
my mom up </B>
<P><B>and she comes in and at the time it was off.  So she thinks were making
it </B>
<P><B>all up and goes back to bed. About a minute later it comes back on
and I yell </B>
<P><B>at her again and she sees this and goes in there and come to find out
its the </B>
<P><B>heater.  And the notices that its really hot in the bathroom.. hotter
then it </B>
<P><B>should be because the heater was only on for 2 mins or so... so she
goes out </B>
<P><B>and gets some tape to tape down the switch.. and when she was gone
it had </B>
<P><B>come back on. So she taped the switch down and asked for whoever was
turning </B>
<P><B>it on to please stop cuz it could burn down the house.</B>
<P><B>It stopped that night.  Another night me and my sis and my 2 cousins
were </B>
<P><B>sitting in our room and we heard the toilet flush and the heater come
on... </B>
<P><B>and we thought someone was back there.. but when no one came out they
went </B>
<P><B>back to investigate and no one was in there and there's no other way
for </B>
<P><B>anyone to get out of the room . So we ran out to tell my parents but
no one </B>
<P><B>believed us.  (this happened before the other heater incident)  other
things </B>
<P><B>that have happened.. I was in the room one night and I  was listening
to the </B>
<P><B>radio and I heard whistling and I know for a fact that there's no kind
of </B>
<P><B>whistling in that song.. so I sat there for a while.. and then I felt
</B>
<P><B>someone kick my bed.  and then there was some kleenex sitting next
to me on </B>
<P><B>the floor and they all of a sudden levitated and hovered there for
a minute </B>
<P><B>and then dropped.  another day I was sitting  back at the piano and
I turned </B>
<P><B>around for a minute and it started playing by itself.  Our vcr always
turns </B>
<P><B>on for no reason..  my dad heard whistling one night when he was asleep
on </B>
<P><B>the couch... also our cats always freak out for no reason.. and one
day my </B>
<P><B>dad was here alone and he heard a knocking on the front door and it
was </B>
<P><B>really quiet and so he got up to see who it was but the only thing
that was </B>
<P><B>out there was my cat. So we figured whoever it is just wanted to tell
my dad </B>
<P><B>to let the cat in,. also last night I was sitting up in bed reading
and I </B>
<P><B>noticed my cat (who was sitting on my bed) was watching something walk
</B>
<P><B>through my room, go into the back and walk back through the room. 
this </B>
<P><B>happened several times and I couldnt get my cat attention.  my other
cat </B>
<P><B>during al of this was freaking out running away from something that
wasn't </B>
<P><B>there.   also another really starnge thing is... alot of times we let
our </B>
<P><B>cats out and turn around to see them sitting behind us wanting to be
let out. </B>
<P><B>and theres no possible way for them to get back in the house !   </B>
<P><B>Also all of this activity seemed to have started after my friend brought
over </B>
<P><B>a ouiji board several years ago... and I know now that you arent supposed
to </B>
<P><B>mess with those things. Also we've had several of our psychic friends
come </B>
<P><B>check it out and they've all said that there is something.  Possibly
a man, </B>
<P><B>and a woman and our old cat (which I have felt and heard) that died
here.  </B>
<P><B>and that it has something to so with a mirror I bought from a junk
store that </B>
<P><B>has an odd shape and one lady in particular.. everytime she sees my
mom she </B>
<P><B>tells her to turn the mirror around.  she always knows when we've turned
it </B>
<P><B>back around.   well thats only some of the things that have happened
here.  </B>
<P><B>the ghost also seems to have attached itself to me for some reason..
I always </B>
<P><B>hear it other places. one night me and my sister and her boyfriend
were </B>
<P><B>sitting up at the school playground close to our house and we heard
the </B>
<P><B>whistling and we were sitting over where there couldn't possibly be
anyone </B>
<P><B>else around cuz we could see everything going on.  and then about an
hour </B>
<P><B>later I was driving him home and me and my sis heard the whistling
in the </B>
<P><B>back seat.  also I had to take care of my grandma at her house for
a while </B>
<P><B>and I was there late one night and the glass potpourri holder flew
off the tv </B>
<P><B>and broke. and I was sleeping in the tv room one night and I heard
the tv </B>
<P><B>trying to turn itself on.</B>
<P><B>no one has ever actually seen anything around here.. even though I
thought I </B>
<P><B>saw someone walk down our hall one day.   </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Ghost or What?????</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: iray@bellatlantic.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>This happened in the late 6o's, if my memory serves me correctly. My</B>
<P><B>first husband and I had gotten married a few months before and with
no</B>
<P><B>place to move we went  into my grand fathers house, which at the time</B>
<P><B>had been empty,  for the most part, since the early 50's after my</B>
<P><B>grandmother passed away. I need to mention also as a child I had
grown</B>
<P><B>up in the house with my grandparents ,so it was like going home for
me</B>
<P><B>but back to the story.  After grandmother passed, grandfather always</B>
<P><B>swore he couldn't stay in the house for her yelling at him 'touching
him</B>
<P><B>to get up and beating pots and pans, well as I was saying we moved</B>
<P><B>in and had lived their maybe three months when one nite without
incident</B>
<P><B>at anytime, went to bed. just as we were settling in to sleep we felt
a</B>
<P><B>slight rumble, not thinking about it my husband started to turn out
the</B>
<P><B>lights and if I remember just as he started the rumble begain again.</B>
<P><B>Finally I said or maybe he did but I remember us asking one another
what</B>
<P><B>that noise was, I guess it was me asking as I recall us thinking a
dog</B>
<P><B>had somehow gotten under the house and shaking------  well within</B>
<P><B>seconds the whole house began to shake and the windows actually
rattled</B>
<P><B>I do mean the house was moving to where we could feel the bed move
and</B>
<P><B>see the window curtains move at the same time we heard the living
room</B>
<P><B>door to the outside fly open!  While all this was going on my husband</B>
<P><B>got up and dressed to go out to see if he could see anything I
remember</B>
<P><B>telling him I will not stay in the house alone so I walked to the
front</B>
<P><B>porch while he went around the house and didn't find a dog or
anything,</B>
<P><B>we came in closed the door and started to get back in bed  him
telling</B>
<P><B>me it had to be a dog. Just as we were lying down the house began to</B>
<P><B>shake again and I do mean it shook as if it were going to fall in,;
the</B>
<P><B>living room door flew open the kitchen door flew open and all the</B>
<P><B>windows rattled the bed came out from the wall a few inches ,it was</B>
<P><B>noticable ' at this time he jumped up I jumped up we ran out into the</B>
<P><B>living room closing the doors and pushing furniture up against the
doors</B>
<P><B>within a few seconds it was over once again , we sat in the living
room</B>
<P><B>and waited to see what would happen next and when it was quite for
a</B>
<P><B>while we went back to bed I didn't sleep at all but we never heard</B>
<P><B>anything the rest of the night or never again , as far as the shaking</B>
<P><B>goes , but while living there I had other terrifying experiences that</B>
<P><B>has got me to the realization something is out there but what and
where</B>
<P><B>and how!!!!!</B>

<P><B>Special Secret</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: ksorensen@mail.fife.k12.wa.us</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Hi, just read your website!  Well, I had a really strange experience</B>
<P><B>about four or five years ago.  A week after my grandfather died, I
was</B>
<P><B>home alone, washing the dishes.  I turned off the water for a second
or</B>
<P><B>two, and all of a sudden I got this really weird feeling.  As if
someone</B>
<P><B>was standing right behind me. It wasn't like I could hear anything</B>
<P><B>strange, or foreign, it just felt like there was an individual behind</B>
<P><B>me.  I then hear a low, soft voice--</B>
<P><B>"....Jeessiiccaaaa...."  It sounded like my grandfather's voice-and
I</B>
<P><B>wasn't thinking about him at the time, either.  I guess I got all</B>
<P><B>creeped out, because I turned on the water, the television, and the</B>
<P><B>radio.  I didn't tell that to anybody for a long time....My little</B>
<P><B>special secret that I feel compelled to tell.</B>

<P><B>Haunted 2 flat in Riverdale</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: BALWGL@webtv.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>In the early 70's we lived in a 2 flat in Riverdale Il.  We first
rented</B>
<P><B>the upstairs apartment and never had anything uusual happen. After
about</B>
<P><B>a year we moved down to the first floor apartment and then started</B>
<P><B>noticing  a strange noise every night at 10:05 pm.  It sounded like</B>
<P><B>someone upstairs was dropping one shoe just above the kitchen
doorway.</B>
<P><B>Every night  we would hear this sound.  My husband of course put it
down</B>
<P><B>as being the house just making ordinary noises because it was an old</B>
<P><B>wood frame house. A  few months after we lived there we "adopted" a</B>
<P><B>great old schnauser dog from couple down the street who were moving
and</B>
<P><B>couldn't take the dog with them.  When we brought him home, he
refused</B>
<P><B>to go down to the basement. He also would sit in the kitchen and wait</B>
<P><B>for the sound everynight, howl for a minute and then just go about
being</B>
<P><B>a normal dog.  We thought it was just because he was an older dog and</B>
<P><B>missing his old family, until the people  in the upstairs apartment</B>
<P><B>bought a new puppy, and he did the same thing.  Then it was a little</B>
<P><B>weird.  I started talking to some of the older people  in the</B>
<P><B>neighborhood and found out that the woman who had live their
originally</B>
<P><B>had hung herself in the basement.  </B>

<P><B>My 1st Experience With a Haunted House</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>By: 107701.2343@compuserve.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>All my life I have been fascinated with paranormal and true ghost</B>
<P><B>stories. But that had no alteration to what happened to me with my
best</B>
<P><B>friend who never has had any interest or knowledge of hauntings.</B>
<P><B>	She tempted me to go to the base in which she lived with the promise
of</B>
<P><B>an authentic haunted house. I was immediatly interested and went out
the</B>
<P><B>following weekend. Reading about how dogs seem to have a sixth sense</B>
<P><B>toward paranormal, I brought along my friend's beagle and basset
hound.</B>
<P><B>	She led me to an old, condemned hospital. It had been on the Air
Force</B>
<P><B>Base since the beginning. It was old brick, and the windows were
covered</B>
<P><B>with a thick white plaster. A large indent that looked like it could</B>
<P><B>have once been a porch with no doors was on the side of the building.</B>
<P><B>Before we went in, my friend called out the name of a captain who had</B>
<P><B>died there. The beagle suddenly froze and stared at a corner. My
friend</B>
<P><B>called out another name, and the dog suddenly turned to stare
intensly</B>
<P><B>at another corner. Taking the oppurtunity, we went to the first
corner</B>
<P><B>and knocked on the window. Nothing happened. We went to the second</B>
<P><B>corner and lightly knocked. We heard a sound like a slight shuffling</B>
<P><B>coming from inside the building. We walked around the house to a new</B>
<P><B>indent. It had a big cement slab that could have once been a porch.
We</B>
<P><B>went to the left corner, and we again knocked on the window. A sharp</B>
<P><B>knock immediatly sounded from the inside from the window next to ours.
I</B>
<P><B>turned around and saw another indent. My friend muttered something
about</B>
<P><B>a little girl. Like there was one near.</B>
<P><B>	Throughout this, the dogs were stiff and staring at where we'd heard</B>
<P><B>the knock. I asked my friend about what she'd said, and she said she</B>
<P><B>just had "felt" the presence of someone that to her seemed to be a</B>
<P><B>little girl. I got a weird feeling that I didn't want to go near the</B>
<P><B>next indent. At all. The dogs had turned their attention to this new</B>
<P><B>corner, and seemed to feel the same way as I did. </B>
<P><B>	My friend started to knock and listen on the new indent while I
stayed</B>
<P><B>back. I heard a noise from part of the cement slab that I couldn't
see.</B>
<P><B>It sounded like someone had heavily drug their shoe on the cement.
I ran</B>
<P><B>over to see nothing. I felt a chilling, cold feeling all over for no</B>
<P><B>reason. My friend told me she felt cold, and asked if I felt the same.
I</B>
<P><B>did.</B>
<P><B>	We came back the next day, and went to the first indent. To the
window</B>
<P><B>where we'd heard nothing. When my friend knocked, we heard a "scream"
It</B>
<P><B>sounded like a man, but in a low volume, almost like a tape recording</B>
<P><B>turned down. It's hard to describe, and it may sound corny, but it</B>
<P><B>sounded pained. I would thought someone was hurt inside, but it
sounded</B>
<P><B>so strange, and like it was right next to us. Fear taking over we
took</B>
<P><B>off. Later, coming back, we went back to the place we associated with</B>
<P><B>the little girl. I went over to a corner and felt overwhelmed by
nasuea.</B>
<P><B>I reeled over, feeling horribly sick, and my friend practically drug
me</B>
<P><B>out of there. The second I was out, I felt perfectly healthy. My
friend</B>
<P><B>said while I was there she heard soft knocks and clocks ticking in
the</B>
<P><B>house.</B>

<P><B>When I was Young I saw a Ghost</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: camillecamel@hotmail.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I remember one night whan I was about 8 years old. I was always afraid
of</B>
<P><B>the dark, well, not of the dark but the things I couldn't see or hear.
I've</B>
<P><B>always been a terrible sleeper, even when that young so I woke up in
the</B>
<P><B>middle of the night and I looked around my room, as I always did. I
was</B>
<P><B>always scared that I would see something but I never did until that
night. </B>
<P>
<P><B>There was a good looking young man with long straight brown hair in
a tux.</B>
<P><B>Beside him was an enormous Huxky. They both just stood there and stared
at</B>
<P><B>me. As I looked at them with a thousand questions running though my
head.</B>
<P><B>As I kept staring at them the man slowly nodded and the dog looked
up at</B>
<P><B>him, then they both just faded away. It is an experiece that I'll
never</B>
<P><B>forget. No-one has died in my house as my parents bought it as soon
as it</B>
<P><B>had been built. I was not scared but just felt kindred to the ghosts.</B>

<P><B>Story from Italy</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Dario.DeRosa@wfp.org</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I'm writing to you from Rome, Italy and reading and reading again your
stories I</B>
<P><B>decided to tell about my personal adventure.</B>
<P><B>It was when I was a kid, say from 11 to 19 years of age;  I was living
in a</B>
<P><B>house with garden outside of Rome, it was me, my mother and my father,
I don't</B>
<P><B>have any brothers or sisters.</B>
<P><B>Actually there was more than one single happening, here it goes:  after,
like</B>
<P><B>five or six months of our stay there we understood there was
something</B>
<P><B>''special'' but only my mother and I believed in this, my father was
skeptic.</B>
<P><B>Anyway let's begin from the start, once there were some of my parents
friends</B>
<P><B>that came to see the new house we just bought ( I just want to add
that they had</B>
<P><B>a dog, a little yorkshire terrier) and us kids in the living room,
the house had</B>
<P><B>three floors and we were in the middle so there were the stairs that
went up, at</B>
<P><B>a certain point the dog started running towards the stairs, stopped
at the</B>
<P><B>beginning and started not barking but growling like a ferocious</B>
<P><B>animal........some of them thought he was nuts......not me neither
my mother!</B>
<P><B>After nearly two years things got really worst, a great deal of my
friends and</B>
<P><B>my mother's brother, my uncle just felt a hand touch them on their
shoulders,</B>
<P><B>they would just freak out big time.</B>
<P><B>Another time, my mother was doing yoga in her bedroom ( but I didn't
know that)</B>
<P><B>and at a certain point, I hear her call my name but in a scared tone,
so I run</B>
<P><B>upstairs and find her still on the floor looking at me, she said Dario
I was</B>
<P><B>doing some exercises and the cat just started hissing and making loud
noises at</B>
<P><B>something unvisible under the bed, so she just started praying  and
after 30</B>
<P><B>seconds it stopped.</B>
<P><B>Freaky??</B>
<P><B>Let me tell ya I was........I can't tell ya!!!!!!!!</B>
<P><B>The last episode was this once my father went to see her sister in
Northern</B>
<P><B>Italy, so my mother and I were left alone, at night we were woken up
by huge</B>
<P><B>thumps on the wooden stairs, we just hugged, but after a minute of
hoping it to</B>
<P><B>stop, my mother said she wanted to go and see if there was someone
in the house,</B>
<P><B>because we just couldn't let them go.</B>
<P><B>At that time I was small so my mother told me just stay put, after
coming back</B>
<P><B>from inspecting the house she was petrified, she saw nobody, nothing
was broken,</B>
<P><B>the door wasn't forced............nothing!!!</B>
<P><B>I tell you that was a villa, there was nothing around us, no
neighbours!!!!!!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now we just moved house and the one we are staying in now is absolutely
fine.</B>

<P><B>Trilogy</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: QTPIE46545@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>My name is Brenda and I have three stories to share with you.  They
will be </B>
<P><B>in condensed form but all three happened.  I will make them in
chronological </B>
<P><B>order so here goes number one.  Most people can't remember much before
the </B>
<P><B>age of five but I remember something that happened when I must have
been between the ages of </B>
<P><B>3-4.  I know it was around that age because I was still in a crib and
even </B>
<P><B>though I am over 40, I still remember as if it were last night.  I
remember </B>
<P><B>that if I didn't fall asleep facing the wall, every night a little
ghost wearing a different necktie would </B>
<P><B>come and stand beside my crib and stare at me.  I know this sounds
idiotic but I can </B>
<P><B>still remember, and in fact do still fall asleep facing the wall. 
I never </B>
<P><B>saw it otherwise. &nbsp;The next one was when I was 19 and married.
 We bought an old house that had a</B>
<P><B>room in it that made me feel uncomfortable.  My great aunt told me
that the </B>
<P><B>house had a reputation about it and now I know why.  I was asleep one
night and my </B>
<P><B>husband was working night shift.  Something woke me up and it was a
gorgeous </B>
<P><B>summer night.  My husband talked me into making our bedroom in the
room that </B>
<P><B>made me feel odd and I did to please him.  When I woke up I heard a
rustleing </B>
<P><B>sound like somebody rummaging in a paper bag.  I sat up in bed and
when I did a bag of quilt </B>
<P><B>pieces that had belonged to my great grandmother and I had been working
on, </B>
<P><B>lifted 5-6 inches off the dresser where I had set it the night before
and </B>
<P><B>floated about 2 feet over the edge and fell.  Just as I was getting
up to try </B>
<P><B>and see what could have caused that, I heard my name whispered in my
ear.  I </B>
<P><B>sat the rest of the night on the porch waiting for my husband to get
home and the next day moved our bedroom.  That </B>
<P><B>seemed to be the only room in the house that felt "odd."  The third
one is </B>
<P><B>about a house we lived in in Indianapolis.  My daughter was 3 when
we moved </B>
<P><B>in and she constantly talked to someone we couldn't see.  She called
the spirits Big </B>
<P><B>John and Ancie.  We thought maybe it was invisible playmates until
one night when she </B>
<P><B>was 4 she told me good-bye instead of good-night,  I said don't you
mean </B>
<P><B>good-night? I still remember her sweet baby face say "no I mean good-bye.
Ancie said she </B>
<P><B>was coming to take me to walk on the stars tonight."  It wasn't until
thenthat </B>
<P><B>she told me that Ancie gets in bed with her at night and she wears
a long white dress and </B>
<P><B>feels like ice.  I knew immediately that this was a spirit.  I began
to cry and </B>
<P><B>told her she couldn't go.  She looked at me with her sweet little face
and said "now that </B>
<P><B>you know Mommy she won't take me.  Big John told me to tell you about
her."  I believe </B>
<P><B>that Big John was there to watch over her and make sure that Ancie
didn't take her </B>
<P><B>to goodness knows where.But to make sure, she slept with me and my
husband until</B>
<P><B>we could move from that awful place.  I never saw anything there but
I heard </B>
<P><B>plenty. &nbsp;My daughter is 17 now and still remembers the
experience.</B>

<P><B>My Home in Florida</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: GothStar81@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>Since I was little I have had an obsession with the paranormal.  I
guess this </B>
<P><B>started because my mother was the same way.  But my first real paranormal
</B>
<P><B>experience happened when I was about four years old.  I would wake
up and I </B>
<P><B>would feel so free.  I would look down and realize that i was floating
and I </B>
<P><B>could see myself down below still sleeping.  My mother later described
the </B>
<P><B>same thing happening to her when I mentioned it.  I also had a recurring
</B>
<P><B>dream of a goat chasing me through my house and right before I reached
my </B>
<P><B>bedroom it would impale me on it's horns.  I would wake up terrified.
 The </B>
<P><B>other thing that happened was that my mother and I would hear voices.
 They </B>
<P><B>came from the wall between the living room and my room.  Sometimes
they were </B>
<P><B>louder and more frightening than others.  Especially if we were alone.
 The </B>
<P><B>voices still can be heard this very day from time to time.  And a few
months </B>
<P><B>ago I came home from work to have my mother tell me that there had
been a </B>
<P><B>loud banging, as if someone was slamming a hammer into the side of
our mobile </B>
<P><B>home.  But there was no sign of anyone or any damage.  The other things
we've </B>
<P><B>experienced are isolated incedents where our cats would watch as if
someone </B>
<P><B>crossing the room even if no one was there, my mother experienced the
feeling </B>
<P><B>of someone sitting on the edge of her bed when she was alone, and I
would see </B>
<P><B>shadowy forms out of the corners of my eyes.  Another frightening thing
is </B>
<P><B>when sometimes at night, the house shakes violently as if being pummeled
by a </B>
<P><B>hurricane.  This lasts anywhere from a few seconds to 2 minutes.  Many
of my </B>
<P><B>other friends in that town were experiencing things out of the ordinary
too.  </B>
<P><B>We sat outside discussing it one night until 4am.  We decided maybe
our </B>
<P><B>little town is a hotspot.  Some saw a short figure which at first they
</B>
<P><B>thought was someone far away with a lit cigarette but then they realized
as </B>
<P><B>it got closer it was only the height of a sheepdog and the glowing
red dot </B>
<P><B>was not a cigarette.  They ran and by the time the ventured out to
look for </B>
<P><B>it, it was gone.  And once at a party a whole group of my friends saw
the </B>
<P><B>apparition of a little girl in a nightgown who fled down the hall when
she </B>
<P><B>was noticed.</B>
