<b>Raised by the Spirits</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have gone through most of my life experiencing weird or unexplainable</b>
<br><b>phenomenon's. I was told that I was bottle fed by a "ghost" when
I was just</b>
<br><b>a newborn in my crib. Also, when I was little I used to get weekly
visits</b>
<br><b>from a "ghost".</b>
<br><b>My aunt and I shared a bedroom with my mom and sometimes I would
wake up in</b>
<br><b>the middle of the night to find a figure standing in the doorway.
This</b>
<br><b>figure appeared to look like my mom, but when I looked across the
room,</b>
<br><b>there would be my mom sleeping in her bed. When I called out her
name, she</b>
<br><b>wouldn't respond and it terrified me. One time when the figure appeared
in</b>
<br><b>the doorway, I got soo scared that I put my head under the covers
only to</b>
<br><b>hear someone speak something right in my ear! I couldn't understand
what was</b>
<br><b>being said, but it was a voice.&nbsp; When I told my mom what happened,
she would</b>
<br><b>just brush it off as a child with a wild imagination.&nbsp; To this
day, it still</b>
<br><b>gives me chills.</b>
<br><b>Back in 1991, I dated a guy from my High School, we were both Seniors.
We</b>
<br><b>used to hang out at his parent's house a lot. His parent's had a
three-story</b>
<br><b>home with a finished basement and loft. In the lower level of the
house was</b>
<br><b>a bunch of antiques that his dad has collected and every time I
walked</b>
<br><b>through this part of the house, I would get chills and sometimes
it felt</b>
<br><b>like I was being watched. I will usually get chills and become very
uneasy</b>
<br><b>when there is "something" around, and when I get this sense my guard
goes up</b>
<br><b>and I am cautious of everything around me. Anyway, my boyfriend
had his</b>
<br><b>bedroom in the basement of the house and in his bedroom was a small
basement</b>
<br><b>window. He had built wood shudders to block out any light, and believe
me,</b>
<br><b>when the lights went out you didn't know if your eyes were open
or shut - it</b>
<br><b>was that dark! I used to stay the night at his house frequently
and was</b>
<br><b>really uneasy about moving around the house without him. The room
that gave</b>
<br><b>me the most tension was his room. I wouldn't let him leave me alone
for a</b>
<br><b>minute, not even to go to the bathroom!</b>
<br><b>One night when we got ready for bed, the light went out and the
door was</b>
<br><b>shut. Before falling asleep, I lay there looking around (even though
I</b>
<br><b>couldn't see anything) and when I looked at the wall on my side
of the bed,</b>
<br><b>there was a faded white figure in the middle of the wall. I looked
at the</b>
<br><b>wall on my boyfriend's side of the bed to see if there was a reflection</b>
<br><b>coming through the window reflecting off of a mirror or something
to explain</b>
<br><b>the white shadow - but there was nothing. I calmly asked Kurt to
turn on the</b>
<br><b>light as I kept my eye on the figure the whole time, and when he
turned on</b>
<br><b>the light the figure was gone. After that, we kept a nightlight
on in the</b>
<br><b>room and melted quite a few lamps.</b>
<br><b>Month's later we had visited a friend who had done some spring cleaning
and</b>
<br><b>wanted to get rid of a Ouija board. She wanted to get rid of it
because she</b>
<br><b>said it was evil and didn't want it in her house anymore. We took
the board</b>
<br><b>back to his house and were hesitant to use it. I was not the only
one who</b>
<br><b>had experienced the spirits in the house. Kurt used to hear a baby
cry and</b>
<br><b>someone calling his name every once in awhile and one night when
we were on</b>
<br><b>the phone and his parents were gone, he freaked out because he saw
a figure</b>
<br><b>or skull shadow on the fireplace wall. After talking it out we decided
to</b>
<br><b>pull out the board and see what would happen. We were sitting on
the floor</b>
<br><b>in the basement, and to my left was his bedroom. Since his room
gave me the</b>
<br><b>creeps I asked him to shut the door. We started to play, but the
pointer</b>
<br><b>wouldn't move. After a few minutes of concentration, we started
hearing</b>
<br><b>noises coming from his room and we both stopped and looked at each
other,</b>
<br><b>not really sure what to think. We started up again and the whole
time we</b>
<br><b>both stared at the door. There was a poster of a rock band on the
backside</b>
<br><b>of his door and after staring at it, it looked like there was blood
running</b>
<br><b>down the eyes of the performers. We were freaked out enough only
to here the</b>
<br><b>sounds in the room being escalated and it sounded like a wild animal
was</b>
<br><b>trying to get out of his room. We both stopped and he went up to
the door</b>
<br><b>and opened it. Only a cold breeze was felt, nothing else happened.
After he</b>
<br><b>opened the door we went back to the board game to play more, we
even had the</b>
<br><b>nerve to go into his room and sit on the bed with the board game
in hand.</b>
<br><b>After awhile we put the game away and strange enough there was almost
a</b>
<br><b>sense of peace and I didn't feel uneasy a few weeks later. I think
that</b>
<br><b>maybe we "trapped" the spirits into the board or something. A couple
of</b>
<br><b>months later, Kurt had gotten home late and was walking to his room
in the</b>
<br><b>dark. He saw a bunch of white figures standing around the pool table
and if</b>
<br><b>that wouldn't be enough to freak you out, when he went into his
room, there</b>
<br><b>was a white figure lying on his bed! Of course, when he turned on
the light,</b>
<br><b>nothing was there.</b>
<br><b>For those of you who like to play games, stick to the fun games.
The Ouija</b>
<br><b>board can be dangerous if you don't know what you are doing or what
you are</b>
<br><b>dealing with.</b>
<br><b>After all of my experiences, I truly believe that there is something
on the</b>
<br><b>other side and from what I have witnessed, I am starting to think
that they</b>
<br><b>are only living out their lives the way we live ours, just in a
spiritual</b>
<br><b>sense.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Story of a Spirit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dersh35@compaq.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I had a very frightening but very calming experience when I
was about 12 years old.&nbsp; My grandfather, Norman McCarty had just passed
away and I felt very uneasy about what was going to happen to him, and
when I asked my mother she told me that he would never leave us and that
he would always be watching over us.&nbsp; These words didn't really calm
me so just wondered about his fate.&nbsp; i didn't know him very well,
just about all I knew of him was that he was killed by alcoholism.&nbsp;
So the following night I was watching TV and then I felt another presence
in the room with me, my mother was in the garage doing the laundry and
my dad was at work, so I was the only one in the room, I turned around
and looked at the couch, and there was he was.&nbsp; He was just sitting
there watching me watch tv.&nbsp; He was slightly tranparent and had a
very calm and pleasent look on his face.&nbsp; This frightened me very
much.&nbsp; I turned away and when I looked back he was gone.&nbsp; But
one of the odd things is that where he was sitting, the couch was very
cold, and afghan was crumpled when it had been folded.&nbsp; I ran outside
and told my mother and very calmly told me that Norman had just come back
to say goodbye and to let me know that everything was okay.&nbsp; Over
the next couple of weeks he also appeared to my father, walking down the
hallway of our house, he was standing in the doorway of my room (Norman).&nbsp;
He then didn't make an appearance to my grandmother, but instead called
her name several times during the night shortly after his passing.&nbsp;
These, I beleive were him letting his family know that he was in a better
place but missed us very much.</b>

<p><b>The Shadow</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: amarher@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi all.&nbsp; My name is Leci, and I live in a small town</b>
<br><b>in southeastern Indiana.&nbsp; I've been reading all of</b>
<br><b>these stories for a while, and some of them are really</b>
<br><b>great.&nbsp; This isn't anything all that scary (except to</b>
<br><b>me), but if you want to hear more, e-mail me.&nbsp; About 3</b>
<br><b>months ago, I suddenly got "spooked" (that's what I</b>
<br><b>call the feeling that I get when there is a spirit</b>
<br><b>around.)&nbsp; I guess some background, I am a</b>
<br><b>spiritualist.&nbsp; I can see and sense spirits, but I am a</b>
<br><b>beginner, so I am not always consistent with this.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>is sometimes a hit and miss thing.&nbsp; Ok, now back to</b>
<br><b>the story.&nbsp; For the next two weeks, I was going</b>
<br><b>through cold spots, feeling someone tap me on the</b>
<br><b>shoulder at work, home, in the car, and just about</b>
<br><b>everywhere else I was, vivid, strange CONFUSED dreams</b>
<br><b>(very chaotic).&nbsp; Then one night while staying at my</b>
<br><b>boyfriends house, I got the hair raising feeling that</b>
<br><b>someone else was in the room with us, and I knew that</b>
<br><b>it wasn't the kids because they weren't there.&nbsp; Being</b>
<br><b>the big brave girl that I am, I pulled the covers over</b>
<br><b>my head, and refused to open my eyes.&nbsp; Then I started</b>
<br><b>feeling someone poke me on the leg.&nbsp; I had ahold of</b>
<br><b>both of my boyfriend's hands (he was sound asleep),</b>
<br><b>but kept feeling this.&nbsp; It was like someone was trying</b>
<br><b>to get my attention.&nbsp; Then J (my boyfreind) rolls</b>
<br><b>over, and so do I and I opened my eyes.&nbsp; There beside</b>
<br><b>the bed was a shadow.&nbsp; I rubbed my eyes a few times</b>
<br><b>thinking (hoping) that it was them playing tricks on</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; Well, I realized that it wasn't when the shadow</b>
<br><b>moved like he was going to touch my leg again.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>freaked!! Woke my boyfriend, and all of his neighbors</b>
<br><b>up.&nbsp; The thing did not disappear, and he could not see</b>
<br><b>it, even when I pointed directly to it.&nbsp; This went on</b>
<br><b>until I invoked my angels to do something.&nbsp; After</b>
<br><b>about two weeks of things of this nature happening, I</b>
<br><b>was at my house, and looked in my bedroom only to</b>
<br><b>watch my light switch flip itself off.&nbsp; I was more</b>
<br><b>than angry by this time, because I had not really been</b>
<br><b>able to sleep very good for a few weeks.&nbsp; I stood up,</b>
<br><b>marched in and shouted, "Whoever you are, you are</b>
<br><b>dead.&nbsp; You are no longer alive, get over it.&nbsp; Go to</b>
<br><b>Heaven, go to H***, I don't care, just go away and</b>
<br><b>leave me alone."&nbsp; (I had been trying to get him to go</b>
<br><b>into the light with my angels for a while, but he was</b>
<br><b>stubborn, and would not go.)&nbsp; He went away then.&nbsp; But</b>
<br><b>I really would not reccommed that anyone get this</b>
<br><b>angry with a spirit.&nbsp; It is really not a good idea.</b>
<br><b>They can be very mean when ticked off.&nbsp; I found out</b>
<br><b>later, and realized who it was.&nbsp; It was an</b>
<br><b>acquaintance of mine, that was a good friend of a good</b>
<br><b>friend of mine.&nbsp; He had been killed in a car accident/</b>
<br><b>murder?? about 2 weeks before this. Sorry this was</b>
<br><b>sooooo long.&nbsp; Any comments or suggestions for next</b>
<br><b>time can e-mail me at amarher@yahoo.com.</b>
