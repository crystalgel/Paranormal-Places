<p><b>Ghost Dogs</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: languid@primus.ca</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My story starts in a an old heritage house on Pandora street in Vancouver
BC. This house is about 100 plus years old and is in a part of town that
is filled&nbsp; with prostitution and drug addicts. It was 5 years ago
and I am still spooked by it. I was sleeping at my then boyfriend's house
in a room upstairs. He rented the two upper floors and another family had
the first two floors. I had woken up at around 2:00am to the sound of clicking
noises on the floor. Like dog's claws on tile or wood floors. Hollow and
yet distinct.&nbsp; I looked around, saw nothing unusual however could
still hear the clicking. It was very cold in the room but I'm usually freezing
anyway. My boyfriend didn't wake up. MY son who was a year old at the time,
was always very comfortable in the living room but would freak out and
cry if i tried to bring him upstairs. When I asked my boyfriend about it,
he seemed surprised that I had heard it too. I wasn't the first to mention
it to him. He had other roommates that had seen a dog and an old woman.&nbsp;
After researching the house, my boyfriend found that an old lady had died
in the house and the dog had starved to death and howled by her side. (I
am not sure that is the exact story, but i DID hear claws on the floor.
Good luck !!!!!!</b>

<p><b>Me and my friends were riding bikes one day and we stopeed to rest.
We started talkiing and i hears somthing so i turned around.</b>
<br><b>Nothing was there. We started talking again and i heard the same
sound. I turned around and there was a white dog looking at us. My friend
decided to catch it and chased after it. We followed because we all like
dogs. We had passed my freind and turned around a curve. There is rocks
on both sides of the curve so the dog couldnt get away over them. After
the curve we came to a feild wich we know very well and the grass has just
been cut the day before. The dog was nowhere in sight and we know sense
the grass was just cut it couldn't hide in it.</b><b></b>

<p><b>hi Dave...my name is&nbsp; Julia,</b>
<br><b>I had a dream about 6mths ago about being in an old house upstairs.I
was on</b>
<br><b>my way to the edge of the stairway to come down and a dresser like
thing was</b>
<br><b>in my way. I felt like there was something very evil there and I
was very</b>
<br><b>very scared and was trying to get out right away.well I tried moving
this</b>
<br><b>dresser and out from within the dresser came a demonic ghostly thing.
it was</b>
<br><b>like a schull with really sharp teeth and red eyes with no body
and as it</b>
<br><b>swooped towards me it had a ghostly body flowing behind it...it
bit me on my</b>
<br><b>legs and I began screaming mainly because it was so scarey looking
and</b>
<br><b>evil.....then it came right up to my face and looked me right in
the eyes</b>
<br><b>with its mouth wide open as if to kill me with those sharp teeth..I
was</b>
<br><b>still screaming and fighting or trying to fight it off from me...and
it just</b>
<br><b>entered my body.... I felt like the&nbsp; "highlander" when he kills
his</b>
<br><b>stalker.. I felt the most awfullfulest feeling inside of me....I
was shaking</b>
<br><b>in my dream i woke up&nbsp; screaming and shaking and having really
bad</b>
<br><b>chills...it felt like the hair on my body was standing on end with
some kind</b>
<br><b>of force .....I felt like it was a very evil thing and I started
to feel</b>
<br><b>like I was turning into something bad..this feeling I was experiencing
after</b>
<br><b>I woke up was shaking, chilling sweating, heart racing.. I was feeling
serges of some kind of force within me.. I couldn't explain at all.....
well 2 weeks passed by ..I had calmed down pretty much by that time...
everyonce in awhile thinking about that dream and i would start shaking
frantically...anyway... another dream came upon me and the dream was about
me&nbsp; sitting in an upstairs school building while school was going
on . someone had done something bad to me (which I can't remember what
it was) and I was gonna get them back .....well I felt this evil inside
me already it was building up really bad...I could feel this energy coming
to a head of maybe exploding or something.....the kid that I was angry
with in my dream was across the room and was against the wall and watching
me as if he had seen a ghost himself...I can see his face as he is watching
me ....and I was gonna kill him (which I have never found out who this
boy is) (never seen him before either)or I felt like I was gonna kill him..
and all of a sudden it was like from my feet up.....the scream I was screaming
was a demonic scream....... it was sooooooo powerful..</b>
<br><b>I felt the power...I can't express it enough... it was very powerful.....
and "I" felt it.... every once in awhile I will get to feeling those chills
of hair-raising serges but nothing becomes of it.... thank GOD!&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am not feeling mad or anything at the time I get these feelings.... but
like right now.....while I am typing this letter to you.... it comes in
splurges like little tingling down my spine thing...</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Great-Grandmother</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CheerLouder4DHHS@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Hello, I am Angel Collins and I am from Erlanger, Kentucky.I had
always heard</b>
<br><b>about my Great-Grandmother, who we called "Nana".&nbsp;&nbsp; She
was very ill at the</b>
<br><b>time when I was born, and had died when I was 2 years old.&nbsp;
She was very nice</b>
<br><b>and caring to all of the people in my family, and they talk about
how I was</b>
<br><b>always with her.&nbsp; We had 8 people in the 3-bedroom house at
the time.&nbsp; Well,</b>
<br><b>before my Nana died, we couldn't take care of her so we sent her
to a</b>
<br><b>senior-citizens home.&nbsp; After she died, no one really ever talk
about her, but</b>
<br><b>when they did they always brought up about how she loved me so much.&nbsp;
Years</b>
<br><b>later, when I was about 7 or 8 years old, and I can't believe I
still</b>
<br><b>remember this to this day, it was in the middle of the night, about
2AM.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was very thirsty, and everyone was sleeping.&nbsp; Suddenly I almost
flipped out</b>
<br><b>because somebody walked into my room with one of my small green
plastic cups</b>
<br><b>but i didn't know if there was anything in it yet.&nbsp; Well, this
old lady</b>
<br><b>looked my grandma, and my grandma's room was across the hall, but
I didn't</b>
<br><b>know how she would have known that I was thirsty.&nbsp; Once my
this lady gave me</b>
<br><b>the cup, i held it in my hand and I went to drink it, and nothing
came out</b>
<br><b>and the cup disappeared.&nbsp; I looked up and the lady just walked
right out of</b>
<br><b>my room.&nbsp; The next morning I told my grandma about it and she
said that she</b>
<br><b>never got up for anything.&nbsp; I guess my great grandma really
does care about</b>
<br><b>me and love me to this day.</b>

<br><b>Haunted and I don't Know Why!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Abbygrrl@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>hello.&nbsp; my name is abby, and i am writing because i have my
own experiences</b>
<br><b>to share.&nbsp; this is my story.</b>
<br><b>my experiences with spirits and places of concentrated energy began
when i</b>
<br><b>was an infant.&nbsp; i remember very clearly seeing transparent,
wispy "smoke"</b>
<br><b>circle my crib at night.&nbsp; voices whispered over me, and hands
caressed me,</b>
<br><b>though when the lights came on and my mother came to check on me
the</b>
<br><b>phenomena temporarily disappeared.&nbsp; as a child, i would often
see</b>
<br><b>apparitions</b>
<br><b>that no one else could apparently see.&nbsp; for most children,
this can be</b>
<br><b>traumatic and alienating, retarding social skills and growth.&nbsp;
i was</b>
<br><b>fortunate, however, because my maternal grandmother was an incredibly</b>
<br><b>spiritual woman, blessed (or cursed) with the same gift.&nbsp; she
reassured me</b>
<br><b>from an early age that most spirits were harmless, or sometimes
even</b>
<br><b>benevolent.&nbsp; however, some spirits, she cautioned, were confused,
or angry,</b>
<br><b>and wanted to hurt someone.&nbsp; she told me that if i ever felt
scared, or like</b>
<br><b>something bad was about to happen, i should leave immediately, even
if no</b>
<br><b>one</b>
<br><b>else could feel it.&nbsp; we saw many spirits together, and it was
an incredible</b>
<br><b>relief to know i wasn't crazy.</b>
<br><b>i always heeded her advice, but sometimes it wasn't good enough.&nbsp;
like the</b>
<br><b>time my family moved to england, and we lived in a huge, ancient
house that</b>
<br><b>was incredibly haunted.&nbsp; furniture regularly rearranged itself,
sometimes</b>
<br><b>within the short time it would take to answer the phone and return
to the</b>
<br><b>room, objects disappeared and reappeared in different places, strange
noises</b>
<br><b>and footsteps were audible at night, and sometimes a phantom horse
could be</b>
<br><b>heard whinnying outside.&nbsp; the energy in that house was very
bad, very</b>
<br><b>concentrated, and i could never really relax when i was there.&nbsp;
shortly</b>
<br><b>before my 13th birthday, i rejoiced when we moved back to america.</b>
<br><b>around that time i was reaching puberty, and i noticed that i could
never</b>
<br><b>seem to turn on or off a light without blowing the bulb.&nbsp; my
parents made</b>
<br><b>uneasy jokes about it, but it was true--i was somehow causing the
lightbulbs</b>
<br><b>to short out and blow.&nbsp; it was during this 18 month period
of time that</b>
<br><b>strange things started happening in our new house.&nbsp; objects
began to move</b>
<br><b>seemingly of their own accord.&nbsp; i remember one time when i
was sitting in</b>
<br><b>the living room with my father, watching the evening news.&nbsp;
suddenly the</b>
<br><b>television remote flew off of the coffee table and landed on the
floor.&nbsp; the</b>
<br><b>television began turning itself off and on rapidly, and the lamps
flickered.</b>
<br><b>a couch cushion pulled itself onto the floor, and my dog began to
howl.</b>
<br><b>Then it stopped--it had all happened in a matter of seconds.&nbsp;
needless to say, it</b>
<br><b>scared the hell out of me, because similar things had been happening
to me</b>
<br><b>in the privacy of my own room for months.&nbsp; i had also been
having terrible</b>
<br><b>nightmares in which unknown older male and female voices asked me
to come</b>
<br><b>with them to "the bottom."</b>
<br><b>my grandmother told me calmly that i was doubtlessly being followed
by a</b>
<br><b>poltergeist, and that under no circumstances should i pay attention
to the</b>
<br><b>occurrences.&nbsp; in fact, she warned me that if objects moved
around, i should</b>
<br><b>leave the room until they stopped, and then quietly come back later
to pick</b>
<br><b>them up.&nbsp; i did this, and eventually the craziness ended for
awhile.</b>
<br><b>fast forward to me now, at 21, writing this letter.&nbsp; i guess
i'm writing</b>
<br><b>because my grandmother passed away shortly after my 14th birthday,
and i</b>
<br><b>can't ask her for advice anymore.</b>
<br><b>i have never been diagnosed with any kind of mental illness or disorder.&nbsp;
i</b>
<br><b>don't do drugs, don't drink, and don't hold "seances" or fool around</b>
<br><b>dangerously with the spirit world.&nbsp; yet i am being haunted,
and i don't know</b>
<br><b>why.at night, objects have begun to move again, and often i dream
of the same</b>
<br><b>man.&nbsp; i have been dreaming of him for many years, and i didn't
learn who he</b>
<br><b>was until recently, when i saw a photograph of the first portuguese
sea</b>
<br><b>captain to "discover" barbados (i was there on vacation).&nbsp;
i am sure it is</b>
<br><b>him--he has an unmistakable face and his voice is heavily accented),
but i</b>
<br><b>suppose my question is WHY?&nbsp; why is he coming to ME?&nbsp;
i haven't asked him,</b>
<br><b>because i am afraid of him.&nbsp; his energy is very negative and
chilling, and i</b>
<br><b>think he was a very violent man.&nbsp; in fact, while in barbados,
i stayed at</b>
<br><b>the crane resort, the oldest resort on the island.&nbsp; directly
beneath the resort</b>
<br><b>is the cove where they originally brought slaves from africa.&nbsp;
the room in</b>
<br><b>which i stayed, room #1, was--you guessed it--the original captain's</b>
<br><b>quarters.&nbsp; that week was one of the most sleepless of my life--nightmares</b>
<br><b>and strange ideas and thoughts plagued me, things moved at night,
transparent</b>
<br><b>apparitions appeared in mirrors and outside of windows--and i would
not stay</b>
<br><b>in that room again for any reason.&nbsp; later, as we were leaving
the resort, i</b>
<br><b>found out my room was known to be haunted.</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I live in Ontario, Canada, in a house which is
over 200 years old</b>
<br><b>last surveyed by specialists.&nbsp; My family has owned this house
for many</b>
<br><b>generations, there has been many births and deaths in this house.&nbsp;
One</b>
<br><b>death that occurred here which I am drawn to is the death of my
great,</b>
<br><b>great uncle who shot himself due to depression.&nbsp; I never knew
this man,</b>
<br><b>yet I somehow have a great connection with him, being an extreme</b>
<br><b>individualist myself.&nbsp; He is my guardian and a dear friend.&nbsp;
Last summer</b>
<br><b>my boyfriend and I were planning on taking a trip to the lake for
a</b>
<br><b>picnic, as I prepared myself in the bathroom, I sent my boyfriend
back</b>
<br><b>to my room to get my ball cap, but instead he came running back
to the</b>
<br><b>bathroom in shock and hysteria, because not only was my stereo turned
on</b>
<br><b>but my door was shut and when he tried opening it my dresser was
in the</b>
<br><b>way. This tormented my boyfriend because he had not believed all
the</b>
<br><b>stories he heard from the neighbors and my family, but what shocked
me</b>
<br><b>was the fact that when I was putting my dresser back in place the
radio</b>
<br><b>announced a tornado alert for our area but it seemed to be such
a</b>
<br><b>beautiful day, I then realized that my dear uncle was warning me
to not</b>
<br><b>go out, but instead take shelter.&nbsp; We did quickly gather things
and</b>
<br><b>headed to the basement, no sooner did we do that then the storm
clouds</b>
<br><b>moved in and we were in the midst of a small tornado.&nbsp; It was</b>
<br><b>frightening, but the house is sturdy (there was only one window
broken</b>
<br><b>and shingles blown off in spots) and I knew I was protected.&nbsp;
I believe</b>
<br><b>if it weren't for my great uncles' warning my boyfriend and I could
have</b>
<br><b>been extremely hurt.</b>

around</b>
<br><b>me. my parents are deceased, and my bayy brother died at the age
of 36. and</b>
<br><b>ever since these deaths in my family i have experienced spirits.
i was living</b>
<br><b>in queens, me and my younger son was sitting in the living room,
and i love</b>
<br><b>plants and i had one plant hanging from my ceiling and all of a
sudden this</b>
<br><b>plant started swinging back and forth&nbsp; and all my windows were
shut. then my</b>
<br><b>son and i heard this snapping sound as if someone was plucking fresh
string</b>
<br><b>beans so my son and i looked up and this whatever was plucking my
plant and</b>
<br><b>throwing the stems across the room at my little son, we both were
so stunned</b>
<br><b>that&nbsp; all my son could do was just sit there with a stun look
on his face, i</b>
<br><b>myself jumped to my feet and i just kepy saying the blood of jesus.
so i went</b>
<br><b>to a neighbor house and i told her what me and my son just experienced
and</b>
<br><b>she gave me some holy water and some blessed oil,and told me when
i enter my</b>
<br><b>son start saying the blood of jesus and i did just that. when i
reached</b>
<br><b>upstairs to my apartment my neighbor told me to sprinkle the holy
water on</b>
<br><b>this plant. and dave i did just that and i was looking for this
plant to</b>
<br><b>explode or something of that nature. then my neighbor called me
and ask me</b>
<br><b>did i do what she told me to do and i said yes, then my neigbor
told me i had</b>
<br><b>to rebuke it out of my home. she told me i had to read the bible
the 23 song</b>
<br><b>of psalm and pray, and i was to open a window so this spirit would
leave out</b>
<br><b>through the window. dave i did just that i prayed so hard i was
even better</b>
<br><b>than rev.ike on sundays mornings. so after i prayed i waited about
three</b>
<br><b>minutes and then i closed the window. so my son and i was sitting

<br><b>this cry of a man i just started talking and yelling at ,y living
room window</b>
<br><b>that if anyone was to have seen me doing that they of assumed i

my window the</b>
<br><b>louder this spirit would cry. i&nbsp; just got tired of yelling
that i just left</b>
<br><b>the window and went to sleep. and dave no matter where i moved this
spirit</b>
<br><b>would always follow me to every apartment i went to. no dave i was

<br><b>Entity Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; celesteeng@webmail.co.za</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;BELIEVE IT OR NOT:</b>
<br><b>First of all my mom and dad had been trying to fall pregnant from
1953 – 1967 when she found out she was pregnant.&nbsp; This was a joyous
occasion and they were already preparing for the arrival the first born
and only born.</b>
<br><b>My parents lived on the prison grounds in Cape Town South Africa
in 1967.&nbsp; My dad was the electrician for the prison.</b>
<br><b>This prison was for coloured offenders be it rape, murder, political
or thieving.</b>
<br><b>The prison was situated about 15 miles from our home; you had to
drive up a mountain pass to get to it.</b>
<br><b>2 Months before my birth and late night I might add, my dad got
a call from his Superior to, it seems like something weird was happening
to the electricity in the main prison block.&nbsp; The lights were going
on and off the whole time. As my dad walked into the building he was overwhelmed
by a sudden feeling of terror and fear.&nbsp; Being a religious and not
very superstitious man (I might add also very brave and strong) my dad
decided to go in and find out what was happening.</b>
<br><b>The first set of cells you would find was that of sex offenders
and thieves.&nbsp; They all were asleep, but very restless (you know, rolling
around, rapid eye movement).&nbsp; As he went to the second set of cells,
which was the more serious offenders, here to the prisoners were asleep
and restless.&nbsp; As moved toward one of the fuse boxes, which happened
to be situated on this floor, he felt somebody touch his arm, my dad immediately
swung round, no one was there.&nbsp; The next couple of seconds he was
picked up by some force and thrown against a cell 5 meters away my dad
immediately noticed scratch marks appearing on his arm and face.&nbsp;
Still the entity did not want to let go of him, he threw him from one side
to the other.&nbsp; After about 15 minutes of torture the entity appeared
to my farther, he could see him the outline of his body so he knew it was
male but he could not see his face just an evil smile, my dad new it was
planning on killing him.&nbsp; Then a miracle happened one of the prison
guards awoke from his slumber, heard the racket and came to check what
was going on.</b>
<br><b>My dad was scared out of his mind he just got in his car and starting
driving down the pass towards our house.&nbsp; On stretch of the road is
very dangerous, so my dad automatically slowed down, yet the car mysteriously
kept going at the same speed, the next thing my dad new a cat jumped from
the back seat on to his neck and starting scratching and clawing.&nbsp;
My dad managed to keep control of the car and of himself.&nbsp; When he
finally got home my mom was ash white sitting on the bed rocking back and
forth, praying as she rocked.</b>
<br><b>It seems that she had a dream:&nbsp; She dreamt she was lying in
bed when a man with no face approached her he said to her that seeing he
could not get my farther he will be talking me instead on the day of my
birth.</b>
<br><b>A week later my grandfather on my dads side died suddenly and unexplained.&nbsp;
And 3 weeks after that on 31 October 1967 12h05, I was born, being premature
I was placed in a incubator and monitored at all times because I had problems
breathing and they did not think I would make it through the night.&nbsp;
The memory of what happened to my dad still fresh in his mind, he and my
mom was frantic with worry and very scared for my sake and their own.</b>
<br><b>My mom was given a sedative and fell asleep with a heavy heart filled
with sorrow.&nbsp; During the course of the night my mom awoke with a loud
scream, my dad who was sleeping at her side woke up at the same time, seems
like the both of them had the same dream.&nbsp; The prisoner with no face
came into the room and told them it was time and walked out toward to paediatric
intensive care where I was lying.&nbsp; The both ran to the ward and what
they saw was yet another miracle, my grandfather was standing over my bed
facing the entity with a ring of fire around me and him.&nbsp; The entity
could not come near me so he just gave up and disappeared.</b>
<br><b>Now something else happened one year after my birth the same time
and date my grandmother on my mother’s side died also unexpectedly.&nbsp;
This was a big blow to my mother as she was very, very close to her mom.</b>
<br><b>During the first four years of my life I was more in hospital than
out and always with some disease that no one could explain.&nbsp; My mom
who is psychically intoned always felt the presence of my grandfather and
grandmother and new I would be save from any harm coming to me as she still
felt the presence of the entity.</b>
<br><b>Now my dad got a transfer to another province and immediately grabbed
as he and my mom at that stage thought that they would finally be rid of
the entity.</b>
<br><b>The first 2 years were event free but on my sixth birthday something
scared me so badly I had to sleep with my mom till I got married.</b>
<br><b>That night I went to bed early tired of all the activity during
the day, well about an hour in to sweet slumber I had a dream of a man
which was just floating in the laughing at me hysterically he then tried
to strangle me and I could feel my life slipping away.&nbsp;&nbsp; I woke
up with a fright and a dry feeling in my throat.&nbsp; I ran to my parents
room and found they were still entertaining some of the grown ups at our
Gazebo.&nbsp; To get to them and I had to go through the dining room and
kitchen through the back door.&nbsp; Halfway through the dining room I
felt the air grow cold and I suddenly felt frozen in place, what I saw
then I hope to gawd I never see again.&nbsp; This black thing (which I
thought was a shadow) materialised right in front of me with the coldest
dark eyes I have ever seen he floated toward me with this eerie smile on
his face and his arms outstretched as if he wanted to strangle me and said
that I am now his.&nbsp; Well out of nowhere I saw my grandparents (I saw
pictures of them so I now it was them) stood in front of me blocking the
entity a way form me.</b>
<br><b>Well after about an hour my parents found me in the dining room
soaked and still unable to move.&nbsp; Strangely we have never had an encounter
with that thing again.</b>
<br><b>Now her comes another twist to the tale.&nbsp; I have been married
now for 6 years.&nbsp; My husband stayed in another province while he was
growing up.&nbsp; He was born on 31 October 1967 12h00.&nbsp;&nbsp; Strange
but true.</b>
<br><b>One night we were married for about 6 months we were sitting talking
when he told me of some strange occurrences in his house while he was growing
up.&nbsp; He always had a reoccurring dream of some thing trying to strangle
him.&nbsp; One night on his sixth birthday this dream occurred again but
this time two old people helped him conquer (if that is the word you can
use) the evil thing.&nbsp; I was shaking like a leaf when he told me this
I should him the picture.&nbsp; The next day I drove to my moms place to
ask her if she said anything to my husband my mom denied in doing that
and since my dad never utter a word of what happened I knew it was not
him.&nbsp; I asked my mom for the picture of my grandparent.&nbsp; She
gave me one picture of grandfather and one of my grandmother.</b>
<br><b>I put the pictures somewhere in the kitchen thinking I should ask
my husband about the pictures.&nbsp; I completely forgot about it.&nbsp;
Couple of weeks later my husband stormed into the kitchen with the photographs
in his hands he was sobbing out loud and wanted to know were I got the
pictures from I told him that it was my grandparents.&nbsp; He started
to cry hysterically&nbsp; (my husband has never been emotional in his life)
after a while I figured out what he was saying; the picture of my grandparents
was the same old people in his dreams.</b>
<br><b>My thoughts on this whole situation is someone did not want to let
my husband and I get married and have a family and tried everything to
separate us.</b>
<br><b>Since then we go to church every Sunday and sing the hymns louder
than anyone.</b>
<br><b>Ps.&nbsp; Two years ago I gave birth to twins one a girl the other
a boy, we named them after my grandparents.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Dougie Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bushnigel@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My story is a little different from what i have read.</b><b></b>
<p><b>It all stared about 4 years ago. It was summer time and I was making
lunch</b>
<br><b>for my brother. All of a sudden I got this god offel feeling something
was</b>
<br><b>not right. I mind you the time i got this feeling was 11:25 a.m.
So I told</b>
<br><b>my brother about the feeling he didn't seen to care. So I didn't
think too</b>
<br><b>much about it until I Got the news 2 hours later! Well my brother
and I when</b>
<br><b>swimming at my Grandparents like always. I was just about to get
out of the</b>
<br><b>water and a seen the police talking to my Grandpa. I figured one
of my</b>
<br><b>family members had got in trouble with the law again. Until Grandpa
waled</b>
<br><b>over to me and said " Your cousin Doug was killed this morning on
a</b>
<br><b>motorcycle!" I stood there for 20 minutes I could not believe what
my</b>
<br><b>Grabdpa had just told me. So I changed my wet closthing and ran
inside the</b>
<br><b>house. My Aunt(Doug's mom) was sitting anot the kitchen table. We
huged and</b>
<br><b>cryed. Dougie was more like a big brother to me. Sence I was the
oldest. I</b>
<br><b>totaly look up to him and I still do!&nbsp; Well the funiral was
a week later.</b>
<br><b>The 4 of July. My Aunt was so depressed that her only sun was dead
that she</b>
<br><b>did not relize what day it was. Oh well. Because of family problems
I ended</b>
<br><b>up moving it with my aunt. At first there was not problems. Then
it started</b>
<br><b>to happen. The feeling like some one was watching me. I thought
it was my</b>
<br><b>mind playing trickes on me. Sence I was home alone. But then It
stared to</b>
<br><b>happen more. Some times i could smell him in the house, because
he use to</b>
<br><b>wear patchouli. I'm not a sopost to have it in the house because
my aunt</b>
<br><b>hates the smell of it. So was i was not smelling some things I had.
Then</b>
<br><b>another thing happened, but only when I watched tv. It sounded like
some one</b>
<br><b>was on the floor snoring. Now I really though I was loosing my mind.
Then</b>
<br><b>more stuff happened. Only when I was sleeping It was lik esomeone
has taken</b>
<br><b>a picture of my . There was a flas o f light but when i opened my
eyes their</b>
<br><b>was not one there. So finally I got enough guts to ask my aunt if
she</b>
<br><b>noticed some thing was different. She to noticed something was different.</b>
<br><b>Finaly I know I was not losing my mind. She begain to tell me things
that</b>
<br><b>have happened to her to. I could not believe this a ghost in the
house. One</b>
<br><b>of the things se told me was if some things was missing she would
say out</b>
<br><b>loud " God darn it&nbsp; Doug where did you put it now." Then she
would leave the</b>
<br><b>room to took some where else, and there it would be the thing she
was</b>
<br><b>looking for sitting where ever Dougie put it for her to see. Then
It finally</b>
<br><b>happened I SEEN HIM.&nbsp; Not like we see people but is aura. Between
you and me</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I about wet my paints. I told my aunt about that. She has
also said she</b>
<br><b>had seen home too. Then Dougs son was born after he died. Then Sky
(his son)</b>
<br><b>begain to see things his behaver and reaction to the one spot in
the house</b>
<br><b>where Doug personal things where. Then As Sky got older he begain
to talk</b>
<br><b>about what he was seeing. Doug used bunny rabits to get Sky attention.
The</b>
<br><b>things sky waould say about the bunnys was so cute. Doug also would
invade</b>
<br><b>my dreams giving him messages to tell hia mom like I love yous was
the most</b>
<br><b>popular one.&nbsp; Then as the months when by Sky no loner talked
about the</b>
<br><b>bunnys and Doud was no longer heard, smelt, nor seen. I felt i had
lost him</b>
<br><b>all over again. Then the lady tht lived next door was also Dougs
friend .</b>
<br><b>She had told my aunt that she had had a dream the Doug was coimg
to vistin</b>
<br><b>us , but as the wind. Need lest to say the next day we had a sever
storm</b>
<br><b>with 90 MILE HOUR WINDS. So now ever time when the wind blows just
right i</b>
<br><b>sware i can hear him whiper my name.</b>
<br><b>Hows that of a REAL GHOST story. All of what was written in full
truth.</b>

<p><b>By: _giskard@excite.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>hello! :o)</b>
<br><b>I found your site awhile back and I think it's great! I recently
began</b>
<br><b>having problems again with a 'spirit' that I had thought had left
so I</b>
<br><b>started looking on the internet for sites that might give me some
ideas on</b>
<br><b>what to do about it. That's when I remembered your site, and after
reading a</b>
<br><b>few of the stories I decided to send you my own. This is taken from
a</b>
<br><b>personal correspondance to a friend of mine I wrote earlier in the
week</b>
<br><b>before I remembered Shadowlands, so that's why it seems to be addressing
an</b>
<br><b>individual. I edited out only the stuff that didn't have to do with
my</b>
<br><b>encounters and some colorful language I may have used, lol. ;o)</b>
<br><b>This is far from everything that has happened, I ended up telling
him the</b>
<br><b>rest of what I'd wanted to say over the telephone so the other incidents</b>
<br><b>aren't typed up. And being that this is quite long I figured that
the rest</b>
<br><b>can just wait for another time. Just to give you a little background;
Glenn</b>
<br><b>is my boyfriend of 7 years, Jacob is my brother who is 5 years younger
than</b>
<br><b>me, and sometimes I refer to my mom as Debby when talking about
her, and</b>
<br><b>Ozzy is my friend I was writing. The names Goliath who we sometimes
refer to</b>
<br><b>simply as 'G', Jadzia, Vanessa and Thaddeus, sometimes called Thad
are the</b>
<br><b>names of our cats. My dad passed away in 92' while we were living
in</b>
<br><b>Atlanta, GA so we moved back to Kentucky where we are originally
from after</b>
<br><b>his death. I broke my ankle on December 10th 2000, and everything
referring</b>
<br><b>to 'two weeks ago or last week' was roughly the beginning of March
2001. As</b>
<br><b>I write this it is Monday, March 19th 2001.</b>
<br><b>Our cat Vanessa passed away in May about two years ago, just a few
weeks</b>
<br><b>after we got Thaddeus. The letter picks up where I started talking
about</b>
<br><b>what was going on...</b>
<br><b>...and i do believe in dark forces that are 'evil' and some that
are more</b>
<br><b>troublesome because i've encountered them! lol! heres a creepy story...</b>
<br><b>when we lived on fawn court, the house right before the one we're
in now, we</b>
<br><b>had a black phantom cat with red eyes that roamed around that house,
and</b>
<br><b>goliath would get it in fights with even when we couldn't see anything
there</b>
<br><b>for him to fight with! one time me and glenn were sitting on the</b>
<br><b>loveseat watching tv, it was about 2am and goliath was sitting on
my lap.</b>
<br><b>from the couch we were on i had a view through the archway of the
living</b>
<br><b>room where we were sitting, into the kitchen and the open archway
of the</b>
<br><b>front room, and the beginning of the hall to our bedrooms off to
the right.</b>
<br><b>well as i was sitting there i saw a black cat come out of the hall,
walk</b>
<br><b>into the kitchen and go into the front room. glenn and goliath both
saw</b>
<br><b>this, too and i was like "what is jadzia doing out?" [as u kno,
goliath and</b>
<br><b>jadzia can't be out at the same time because they don't get along]
goliath</b>
<br><b>hopped up and ran after this cat before i could stop him and so
me and glenn</b>
<br><b>got up to basically break up the fight we knew was coming, lol,
and when we</b>
<br><b>got to the front room goliath was hissing and rolling around in
a big</b>
<br><b>fight... with NOTHING! lol! i went and checked in debby's room because
at</b>
<br><b>the time vanessa was still with us and i just wanted to double check
that it</b>
<br><b>wasn't vanessa who had gotten out because i didn't want goliath
to hurt her</b>
<br><b>because she was old, and vanessa was sound asleep curled up at the
foot of</b>
<br><b>my</b>
<br><b>mom's bed... and so was JADZIA!!!! LOL!!! [vanessa and jadzia got
along so</b>
<br><b>they were always together] my mom was asleep and her door had been
closed,</b>
<br><b>and trust me, if her door had opened before we saw the cat we would
have</b>
<br><b>heard it because it stuck real bad and was loud to open and close.
i woke my</b>
<br><b>mom up and asked her if she'd let jadzia out and she said she had
been</b>
<br><b>asleep since 11 and hadn't got up to do anything since before then.</b>
<br><b>so... i dunno!!! goliath had fought with 'nothing' several times
before</b>
<br><b>this, but that was the only time we had seen anything beforehand.
so once</b>
<br><b>goliath calmed down i put him in my room and shut the door and me
and glenn</b>
<br><b>went back to waching tv. then a little while later we saw that same
cat come</b>
<br><b>out of the hall, go through the kitchen and stop in the front room
archway</b>
<br><b>and glare at us with these EVIL red eyes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! by that
time we</b>
<br><b>realized it was NOT jadzia because for one shes real tiny and has
a white</b>
<br><b>star on her throat, and this cat was huge, completely black and
ermm, it had</b>
<br><b>red eyes, ok?? so me and glenn were just kind of shocked for a minute</b>
<br><b>then when the cat finally went off in the front room we got up and
checked</b>
<br><b>my moms room= vanessa and jadzia were sleeping on the bed, door
closed up</b>
<br><b>tight, ok.... we went and checked my room= goliath was curled up
in the</b>
<br><b>corner napping on my afghan hound, 'baby's' old dog bed, door was
closed...</b>
<br><b>and that accounted for all the cats we had at the time!!! LOL! so
as you can</b>
<br><b>imagine we were pretty freaked out about this!!! and it happened
one more</b>
<br><b>time that night with the same pattern; cat came out of hall, went
in</b>
<br><b>kitchen, went in front room, so after that third time me and glenn
went back</b>
<br><b>to my bedroom to watch the rest of the stuff on the tapes we had
been</b>
<br><b>watching all night, which i think was star trek: tng, lol.</b>
<br><b>we never 'saw' it after that that i can remember, but goliath still
had</b>
<br><b>these fights with 'nothing', and he is a real peaceful gentle cat
unless</b>
<br><b>jadzia attacks him first, lol. :o) and normally when he had them
it was in</b>
<br><b>the hallway or the front room, never in the family room or one of
the</b>
<br><b>bedrooms. and there is absolutely NO explanation for this happening
other</b>
<br><b>than some sort of ghost or spirit. it was a new house, we were the
only ones</b>
<br><b>who'd ever lived in it, and there were no openings or passageways
to the</b>
<br><b>outside because if there were we'd of seen a lot more coming in
the house</b>
<br><b>than just a cat one time, you know?? not to mention, we never saw
the cat</b>
<br><b>LEAVE the front room, and that archway was the only way out of there
but</b>
<br><b>everytime we saw it that night it came out of the hall then went
into the</b>
<br><b>front room, so thats pretty freaky no matter how you choose to look
at it i</b>
<br><b>think.</b>
<br><b>how'd i get from talking about pso and evolution to telling you
about the</b>
<br><b>ghost cat incident..? ;-o lol!!! well actually me and glenn have
been</b>
<br><b>talking about ghosts a lot lately because of the fact that since
i've broken</b>
<br><b>my ankle and been stuck on the couch, i've seen a cat go down the
hallway</b>
<br><b>about 6 times in the past 3 months when no cats have been out and
heard</b>
<br><b>goliath downstairs TWICE now having a fight with something when
he is the</b>
<br><b>only one out in that room!!! so it freaked me out a little, i mean...
when</b>
<br><b>they leave for work, jadzia goes in the cat room downstairs, goliath
runs</b>
<br><b>around in unfinsished part of basement and thad goes in debby's
room so</b>
<br><b>while i'm home alone the cats aren't going to trip me when i hobble
to the</b>
<br><b>bathroom or whatever. and everytime i've seen the cat in the past
three</b>
<br><b>months i've thought it was jadzia!!! just like the first time at
the old</b>
<br><b>house when obviously it wasn't her... so, i dunno!!! :o/ what do
you</b>
<br><b>think??? pretty freaky. it's really starting to unnerve me and i
don't quite</b>
<br><b>know what to say or do- if anything- about it.</b>
<br><b>for one, i don't believe that solid form mass hallucinations that
last</b>
<br><b>longer than a split second are actually that, i think there's something
to</b>
<br><b>them. mass hallucinations that involve lights or something in the
sky that</b>
<br><b>last longer than a split second: ok, they could still be hallucinations</b>
<br><b>because they are formless lights or reflections. but a solid form???
that</b>
<br><b>more than one person sees??? and the description is the same from
all</b>
<br><b>parties even when nobody described it until after??? those types
of things i</b>
<br><b>really have to wonder about and think that some of them could be
real, you</b>
<br><b>know? i already believe in an afterlife where we exsist in an energy
spirit</b>
<br><b>form until we incarnate again, so believing in ghosts and spirits
isn't that</b>
<br><b>far of a leap after that. i didn't used to believe in ghosts or
even an</b>
<br><b>afterlife, for a long long time i thought my past life memories
were just</b>
<br><b>weird dreams and thoughts that would pop into my head during the
daytime.</b>
<br><b>but even when i was unconvinced about all that stuff i still had
things</b>
<br><b>happen i couldnt explain!!! lol so i dunno.</b>
<br><b>anyway, this was the first time i've seen 'the cat' since we've
lived in</b>
<br><b>this house, which is about four years. and i've only seen g fight
with</b>
<br><b>something that wasn't there once but i discounted it at the time
as him just</b>
<br><b>acting weird. but i've reconsidered that now, it happened in sept/
oct</b>
<br><b>of last year. but i've heard him get into fights with nothing before
since</b>
<br><b>we've been here but i just didn't think about it, i don't know.
it wasn't</b>
<br><b>until i saw a cat go down the hall here that i started thinking
about that</b>
<br><b>stuff again. even tho the first time i saw it here was around the
end of</b>
<br><b>dec/ beginning of jan 2001 i didn't really start to wonder if it
had</b>
<br><b>anything to do with what happened at fawn court until about two
weeks ago</b>
<br><b>when i saw the cat up here and realized that even thaddeus had been
put</b>
<br><b>downstairs in my bathroom that day!!! so there were NO cats upstairs
at all!</b>
<br><b>theres only one door to the basement and i'm in full view of it
and we</b>
<br><b>keep it locked when i'm home alone, anyway incase someone were to
break in</b>
<br><b>through a basement window they couldn't get up here where i'm at
and the</b>
<br><b>stairs creak so bad i'd have plenty of time to get out on the porch
and call</b>
<br><b>a neighbor to help me while i call the cops lol. see? we think of</b>
<br><b>everything. lol</b>
<br><b>so... when they got home, and unlocked the basement door, and g
was where he</b>
<br><b>was supposed to be, thad was where he was supposed to be and jadzia
was</b>
<br><b>where she was supposed to be... ALL THREE still in the basement...
i kinda</b>
<br><b>freaked out. and now i really REALLY don't want to be home alone,
wah. :o/</b>
<br><b>LOL!!! i'm the only person who's seen it since we lived here, but
jacob said</b>
<br><b>about a month after we moved in here he saw jadzia go into his closet
and</b>
<br><b>when he went to get her out she wasn't in there! he looked around
in his</b>
<br><b>room to see where she had gone to and couldn't find her then opened
his door</b>
<br><b>and went down the hall and looked around and jadzia and vanessa
were</b>
<br><b>sleeping on the couch! his door had been closed so unless jadzia
can be in</b>
<br><b>two places at once i don't think it was her lol. and g stays in
the</b>
<br><b>basement and is afraid of jacob anyway so he doesn't go in jacobs
room. and</b>
<br><b>he said that's why for about three months back when we moved in
he wouldn't</b>
<br><b>sleep in his room. i had wondered about that and he never told us
why until</b>
<br><b>recently when i told him i've seen the cat here now.</b>
<br><b>and i can't remember if him or debby had ever told me about seeing
the cat</b>
<br><b>at fawn court, they may have but i'd have to ask them again. i know
one</b>
<br><b>thing jacob told me about while we were still living there was that
when</b>
<br><b>everybody was gone he'd hear someone go down the hall open and shut
all the</b>
<br><b>doors then he'd go to look and no one would be there, the house
would still</b>
<br><b>be empty. but that has nothing to do with the cat apparition that
i know of.</b>
<br><b>debby said she saw a ball of light in her room towards the ceiling,
sat up</b>
<br><b>and stared and it for about ten minutes when we lived there, she
said she</b>
<br><b>had a real peaceful feeling and had just watched it kind of float
there in</b>
<br><b>the middle of her room wondering if it was going to say anything
or turn</b>
<br><b>into a full bodied ghost or angel or something! lol! she said it
never did</b>
<br><b>and after about ten minutes it just started to got smaller until
it was gone</b>
<br><b>so who knows what that was. it could have been an hallucination
or maybe a</b>
<br><b>friendly ghost or spirit, i have no idea.</b>
<br><b>i tell you what though, the cat has some really bad vibes it gives
off when</b>
<br><b>we've seen it, theres just a feeling of total dread and despair
and it feels</b>
<br><b>like your heart just drops into your stomach. it's really crummy,
i hope</b>
<br><b>it goes away and i thought it had until about 3 months ago. maybe
it left</b>
<br><b>and came back..? i don't know what to make of it, ozzy!!!!!!!! lol!!!
i</b>
<br><b>could be seeing things but it's just so solid and really there,
and it's not</b>
<br><b>like a split second, it takes a few seconds and you can watch it
with your</b>
<br><b>eyes full attention, not just out of the corner of your eye. and
the time it</b>
<br><b>stopped and looked at me and glenn we saw it for well over a minute!
there</b>
<br><b>was something there, but what it was exactly i don't know. i don't
think it</b>
<br><b>was the 'ghost' of a dead cat, i think it was a troublesome or evil
spirit</b>
<br><b>taking that form to confuse us, but of course i have no proof one
way or the</b>
<br><b>other.</b>
<br><b>what do you think??????? lol! i've been asking all of my friends
who i trust</b>
<br><b>not to think i'm crazy [or at least if they do think i'm crazy still
be my</b>
<br><b>friends afterwards, lol] what they think could be going on or if
they have</b>
<br><b>any ideas on what to do..? i honestly don't know if theres anything
we can</b>
<br><b>or should do, it's just i really DON'T like this and want it to
stop</b>
<br><b>immediately before anything scarier happens. :o/ i TOLD it to leave,
i told</b>
<br><b>it it's not wanted here and i told it to leave in the name of Jesus
Christ</b>
<br><b>but it still keeps coming back so i don't know. i even told it it</b>
<br><b>doesn't scare me but thats not quite true. it does scare me, i'm</b>
<br><b>afriad that if it's an evil spirit it can do harm to us or something
even</b>
<br><b>though it hasn't to this point *that i know of*. when i fell in
the basement</b>
<br><b>it didn't actually seem like i slipped, it was more like i just
suddenly</b>
<br><b>fell for no reason..? it's known to leak there but there wasn't
any water</b>
<br><b>there at the time that i could see, not to mention that while i
was over by</b>
<br><b>the sink washing my hands i had started to feel out of the blue
just really</b>
<br><b>scared and like someone was in the room with me. and maybe that
could have</b>
<br><b>made me nervous and not looking at what i was doing when i went
down the</b>
<br><b>step [singular]... i dunno. see what this kind of stuff make u think</b>
<br><b>about??? lol!</b>
<br><b>and everytime i've tripped on my crutches</b>
<br><b>its been in the hallway, and i just seem to fall like my crutch
was swiped</b>
<br><b>out from underneath me, it's really strange. glenn saw it happen
once, i was</b>
<br><b>coming back from the bathroom and stopped and was saying something
to debby</b>
<br><b>who was in her room with the door shut- i was right outside her
door- and</b>
<br><b>the foot of the left crutch just shot backwards and i fell over
and slid</b>
<br><b>down the wall and glenn had to come help me back up. he said it
had looked</b>
<br><b>like someone kicked it but obviously no one did! lol! that was about
two</b>
<br><b>months ago [roughly the end of jan 2k1] and i hadn't even thought
about that</b>
<br><b>until last week when we</b>
<br><b>really started talking about the cat again.</b>
<br><b>anyway, basically i think its an evil spirit that has been following
us from</b>
<br><b>house to house as we've moved, i dont know what else it could be.
when we</b>
<br><b>lived in atlanta i would see this thing come out of the wall in
my bedroom i</b>
<br><b>could only describe as looking like a "critter" from the movie critters-</b>
<br><b>lol- it would sort of roll and spin out of the wall like it had
walked</b>
<br><b>through the wall, stand there a second then vanish!!! i moved OUT
of that</b>
<br><b>bedroom and made the unused front room into my bedroom, then jacob
moved</b>
<br><b>into my bedroom because the one he had at the time was a lot smaller.
then</b>
<br><b>years later when we were living at fawn court he told me that the
reason he</b>
<br><b>started sleeping in the sun room [again, lol] on the couch was because
after</b>
<br><b>he moved into my old bedroom he'd see this black round thing with
little</b>
<br><b>shiny black eyes and a WIDE mouth and little needle teeth appear
out of the</b>
<br><b>wall!!! i was like HOLY ...!! i had hoped it was just my</b>
<br><b>imagination but obviously it wasn't if he saw the same thing. i
had checked</b>
<br><b>the wall and floor over there where it came out of and there was
nothing: no</b>
<br><b>holes, not even any scratches. white walls, white carpet- lift up
carpet, no</b>
<br><b>holes! just a concrete floor. check baseboard- solid wall behind
it!</b>
<br><b>i think its the same thing thats taking the form of a cat now, it
may have</b>
<br><b>even attatched itself to us and followed us while we lived in atlanta
but</b>
<br><b>i'm not sure because the house before that in bullit hills had some
strange</b>
<br><b>things happen but i can't remember as well because i was younger
and the</b>
<br><b>momories are fuzzier. even though i believe in ghosts, i dont think
i've</b>
<br><b>had any experiences with actual human 'ghosts', i think all of our
creepy</b>
<br><b>incidents are the result of mischevious and/ or evil things that
were never</b>
<br><b>human, nor will they ever be if you know what i'm saying. imps,
demons,</b>
<br><b>trolls, whatever you want to call them. i'll just tell you about
two more</b>
<br><b>things real fast before i have to go:</b>
<br><b>one happened in atlanta, my mom was in the hospitol and my dad was
at work,</b>
<br><b>it was 2- 3am and me and jacob were home alone. during that time
my parents</b>
<br><b>had no one to watch us so we were home alone a lot at night since
my dad</b>
<br><b>worked 3rd shift. and at that time jacob had been sleeping in the
sun room</b>
<br><b>for a few months and when my mom went to the hospitol i started
sleeping on</b>
<br><b>the other couch in the sun room because we were kids and it was
creepy to</b>
<br><b>have no parents home at night! i was about 15 and jacob was 10.
i'm not sure</b>
<br><b>if we had school the next day or not but we were still awake and
sitting on</b>
<br><b>the longer couch which was facing the tv and the one i slept on
when we</b>
<br><b>would go to bed, he slept on the shorter one which faced the row
of windows</b>
<br><b>which faced the woods behind our house. the two couches were in
an "L" shape</b>
<br><b>in relation to one another, i wish i could draw u a quick sketch
so you know</b>
<br><b>exactly what i mean but oh well.</b>
<br><b>anyways, the woods was about 200 yards from our house, but there
was one</b>
<br><b>tree right outside the row of windows [it was a 'sun room', there
were</b>
<br><b>windows along the whole of the walls on three walls of the room,
thats why</b>
<br><b>its important to understand which row of windows this was] facing
the woods.</b>
<br><b>and we were sitting there talking, the light in the sunroom was
off, but the</b>
<br><b>kitchen light was on and the only thing separating the kitchen from
the</b>
<br><b>sunroom was a counter and cabinets right above the counter, so there
was an</b>
<br><b>open archway and about two feet of space in height above the counter
for</b>
<br><b>light to come in the room from... you understand? the hall and bathroom</b>
<br><b>lights were also on. we were talking and then all of a sudden i
looked over</b>
<br><b>at the window and i saw something clasped around the tree right
outside the</b>
<br><b>window. it was about the size of a 5- 6 year old child, peach colored
skin</b>
<br><b>with bushy black and brown fur on its head back arms and legs, very
long</b>
<br><b>arms with long black claws on its feet and hands. and again i have
to say</b>
<br><b>that the things 'face' reminded me of a critter, impossibly wide
mouth</b>
<br><b>filled with tiny teeth and beady black eyes. it's head was real
round and it</b>
<br><b>had cat like ears pearched high on its head, and its face was very
flat, if</b>
<br><b>it had a nose i didn't see one! lol!</b>
<br><b>now of course we screamed and just stared at it not knowing what
the heck to</b>
<br><b>do!!!!!! lol! it just stayed there staring at us, so i thought well
it's</b>
<br><b>outside, it can't get me through the storm windows so i'm going
to go across</b>
<br><b>the room and have a closer look at it- mistake number one!!!! lol!
i go over</b>
<br><b>there and check to see if it looks like ANY animal i've seen before
and</b>
<br><b>notice that the shape of it's body is very human like, five fingers
five</b>
<br><b>toes and no tail, a humped but still human shaped back. the only
thing that</b>
<br><b>wasn't really right was the claws, longer arms and head. when i
was about a</b>
<br><b>foot away from the window it opened its mouth like it was hissing
or</b>
<br><b>something and OH MY GOD&nbsp; i felt like i had just died- IT WAS</b>
<br><b>HORRIFYING!!!!!!! its mouth was just HUGE and filled with all these
tiny</b>
<br><b>sharp teeth, a short black pointed tougue and maybe the worst thing
was we</b>
<br><b>had a sensor light on the back of the house so since this thing
was in the</b>
<br><b>path of the light it would come on so we had an almost too good
of a look at</b>
<br><b>since it was bathed in light! it was just horrible, i have NO IDEA
what</b>
<br><b>it was.</b>
<br><b>jacob started screaming and the 'thing' suddenly lept out and was
hanging</b>
<br><b>from the windows staring in!!!!!!!!!!! jacob starting saying "is
that an</b>
<br><b>animal? is it a demon? what is it?" and i was just like "i don't
know</b>
<br><b>probably an animal!" then after i said that the thing calmed down
from where</b>
<br><b>it had been sort of growling and moving around a bit and started
to just</b>
<br><b>vanish!!!!!!!!!!!! it got fainter and fainter and then it was gone,
but</b>
<br><b>while it was fading it still stayed in the same place and we actually</b>
<br><b>watched it vanish, it didn't jump down and run off or anything.
we</b>
<br><b>called my dad at work and told him all of that so he actually came
home from</b>
<br><b>work and went and looked outside. the next day he looked around
outside</b>
<br><b>again since he believed we DID see *something* that shouldn't have
been</b>
<br><b>there and found gashes in the wood around the window frames outside
where</b>
<br><b>the thing had been clinging to the house!!!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;anyway, after that when my dad left for work me and jacob
locked ourselves</b>
<br><b>in my bed room- it was large, it was actually supposed to be the
front room</b>
<br><b>of the house but it was segregated by a door and we never used it
so i moved</b>
<br><b>into it- and just watched my tv and slept on my q size waterbed
with vanessa</b>
<br><b>and several knives next to the bed!!! LOL!!! it was just too creepy
to stay</b>
<br><b>in there for awhile after that because none of the windows had shades
or</b>
<br><b>curtains and you could see out at all times. the last window along
the wall</b>
<br><b>facing the tv was actually a door to a small deck, and we had a
curtain over</b>
<br><b>the door so the glare wouldn't reflect off the tv. and so about
two or three</b>
<br><b>weeks after that happened we were watching tv in the sunroom while
my dad</b>
<br><b>was at work because i didnt have a vcr in my room and we wanted
to watch a</b>
<br><b>tape of the cartoon shows we watched -jem, gi joe, transformers,</b>
<br><b>thundercats, mask- and something hit the door and we turned around
to see a</b>
<br><b>shadow run off the deck that looked exactly like the shape of the
thing we</b>
<br><b>had seen in the tree!!! it walked upright and was bushy and had
long arms.</b>
<br><b>so unless theres an unknown species of evil great ape [as it had
no tail]</b>
<br><b>living in georgia i suppose it was a demon/ gargoyle/ forrest spirit/</b>
<br><b>brownie/ gremlin/ thing. >;o/</b>
<br><b>it seemed like it was trying to scare us, because after that we
didn't go in</b>
<br><b>the sunroom when everybody was gone anymore and something started
banging on</b>
<br><b>my room windows and rattling the doorknob and windows to the sunroom</b>
<br><b>although we never looked to see what it was again. if we had to
go to the</b>
<br><b>bathroom what we'd do is the one not going to use it would follow
the other</b>
<br><b>one out of my room, down the hall and stand outside the door with
a knife</b>
<br><b>and/ or a baseball bat until they were done then we'd run back into
my room,</b>
<br><b>lmao. :o) we had 2 half bassett hound/ half dacsund dogs that stayed
inside</b>
<br><b>in the dining room off the other side of the kitchen [no we didnt
use it as</b>
<br><b>a dining room, thats just what it was called, ewww lol, no it became
cookie</b>
<br><b>&amp; tubby's room] and they barked their heads off sometimes in
the middle of</b>
<br><b>the night when we started hearing the rattling even though they
were quiet</b>
<br><b>dogs and rarely barked, despite what some people would think about
that</b>
<br><b>mixture of dog.</b>
<br><b>so i don't know, it was unfriendly to the point of being quite threatening</b>
<br><b>and even though it was something that was really there, apparently
it</b>
<br><b>wasn't an animal since it could disappear into thin air!!! i was
standing</b>
<br><b>right next to the window when it vanished so i know it didn't just
jump down</b>
<br><b>and run away, it _VANISHED_.</b>
<br><b>anyways, i was going to tell you one more thing but that last one
took too</b>
<br><b>long and now i gotta go. lemme kno what u think &amp; if you have
any ideas on</b>
<br><b>what we should do. i mean it doesn't seem to be doing anything right
now but</b>
<br><b>what if its starting again? i couldn't even deal with it if it did
-LOL- so</b>
<br><b>i either want to be ready to deal with it when and if it does or
i want to</b>
<br><b>just find away to get rid of anything thats attatched itself to
me/ us/</b>
<br><b>whatever BEFORE anything else happens. this is MY home, we pay for
it, the</b>
<br><b>thing can go live in the woods lol. ;o) thats all i have to say
on that</b>
<br><b>matter. *G*</b>
<br><b>sorry about going on about the ghostly stuff for so long, its just
been on</b>
<br><b>my mind a lot the past week especially and i'm starting to wonder
if i</b>
<br><b>should *DO* something, you know? my buddy in london, jenny, said
i should</b>
<br><b>ask it to leave but that didnt work so i dunno. i think that things</b>
<br><b>DON'T actually have to leave if you tell them to and that ghosts
and demons</b>
<br><b>and things are around us all the time, but for some reason wether
it be a</b>
<br><b>person who's sensitive to that stuff or one of those things in your</b>
<br><b>immediate enviroment that is just more evil and/ or unfriendly than
in other</b>
<br><b>places you're just going to have more things "happen" you can't
explain by</b>
<br><b>any accepted terms you know?</b>
<br><b>That was the end of my expeiences from the letter to my friend,
I ended up</b>
<br><b>having to go and wasn't able to tell him the second thing I had
wanted to</b>
<br><b>but I intend on writing you here at Shadowlands later with the other</b>
<br><b>happenings. I never asked for any of this stuff to bother me but
I think I</b>
<br><b>may be 'sensitive' to ghosts and spirits, especially due to the
fact that I</b>
<br><b>believe in them and are likely to accept supernatural explanations
to things</b>
<br><b>we can't explain almost as readily as a good sounding scientific
one. I'll</b>
<br><b>just leave you with a quote I find really sums up how I feel about
people</b>
<br><b>who refuse to give even the slightest nod to the possibility of
the</b>
<br><b>supernatural:</b>
<br><b>"We seem to have here one of those problems wherein people readily
agree on</b>
<br><b>what it would take to establish something they very much do not
want to</b>
<br><b>believe--and then when, contrary to anyone's expectations, the evidence</b>
<br><b>actually emerges strongly supportive of the belief, they return
(for no</b>
<br><b>persuasive reason) to add more conditions to what it would take
to establish</b>
<br><b>what they very much do not want to accept. And they continue to
do so until</b>
<br><b>it is virtually impossible that any such evidence should ever emerge."</b>

<br><b>Current Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Ali.Pepe@ic.gc.ca</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My oldest brother has been suffering for years from "bed shaking",
recently,</b>
<br><b>he brought over his car to my house to for the winter and within
2 weeks, my</b>
<br><b>8 yr old daughter started to complain that her bed is shaking.</b>
<br><b>I was aghast, since I have been in that house, we have never encountered</b>
<br><b>such</b>
<br><b>problems. I tend to be sensitive to the presence of spirits and
can feel</b>
<br><b>"something" in my house when she has complained about her bed. I
take her</b>
<br><b>complaints seriously.</b>
<br><b>We got rid of the car, and the bed shaking eventually came to a
stop, but</b>
<br><b>Has restarted again recently. I am divorced with a good relationship
with my ex</b>
<br><b>and my daughter has also complained of the situation at her mother's
house.</b>
<br><b>My ex has also indicated to me that she feels there is a presence
in her</b>
<br><b>house.</b>
<br><b>I have sought the help of my religious leader, I am muslim. He prepared
and</b>
<br><b>gave me two "tabeege" (not sure of the correct spelling), to put
up in the</b>
<br><b>house. One over the main doorway and one specifically in my daughters
room.</b>
<br><b>This is a small piece of paper, with Islamic writings, blessed with
100</b>
<br><b>prayer recitals for each. While they seemed to provide initial relief,
they</b>
<br><b>entity seems to be able to by-pass them.</b>
<br><b>My faith in god is very strong, and I believe in spirits. We are
warned of</b>
<br><b>them in the Quran, and to beware of the the evil whisperer.</b>
<br><b>While these entities don't seem to bother me or my 7yr old son,
they seem to</b>
<br><b>prefer my daughter.</b>
<br><b>There is a history of spriritual problems in my family, one of my
aunts</b>
<br><b>Seems to have been "claimed" by a group of spirits who control her
life and</b>
<br><b>apparently, they also have taken to her daughters. She has tried
everything</b>
<br><b>to be rid of them, but they refuse to go.</b>
<br><b>I don't wish the same fate for my daughter.</b>
<br><b>There is so much to tell, If you wish to contact me, I will provide
you with</b>
<br><b>a phone number if you so desire. While I don't know you, I sense
from your</b>
<br><b>website that you intention is good and that wish to be helpful to
those in</b>
<br><b>need and I commend you for that.</b>
<br><b>I am a fairly knowledgeable person concerning these issues, but

<br><b>Condie Cunningham</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Katie@zipmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;In a college in Alabama, there is said to be haunted by a ghost</b>
<br><b>named Condie Cunningham. One night, she and her room mate were baking
fudge</b>
<br><b>on an old-fashoned stove. The house mother told them to turn the
stove off</b>
<br><b>and get to bed. While trying to put the fire out, Condie knocked
over a</b>
<br><b>bottle of alcohol onto the stove, starting a huge fire.She ran down
the</b>
<br><b>hall, and burned to death.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Many students at the college today remember strange encounters
with</b>
<br><b>Condie. One woman was alone in the college, (it was in sumertime)
taking a</b>
<br><b>shower, when she heard the heavy door open, and screaming in the
last stall.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;There is also a door, where sometimes her face shows up with
her</b>
<br><b>hair on fire. They have replaced the door at least three times,
but it keeps</b>
<br><b>coming back.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Another student saw her rug ruffle up right before her eyes.
there</b>
<br><b>were no windows open or anything that could cause that to happen.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I saved the best for last. One student saw a lady in a white
gown</b>
<br><b>sitting at her nightstand. Since she thought it was her room mate,
(she</b>
<br><b>didn't have her glasses on) she started to call out her name. When
she</b>
<br><b>reached over for her glasses, she saw that her room mate was fast
asleep</b>
<br><b>right next to her. She then started to scream out her room mate's
name. She</b>
<br><b>finally woke up. when they looked over at the nightstand, the figure</b>
<br><b>dissapeared.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;That isn't the part I thought was the best! Here it comes:
That same</b>
<br><b>girlmoved into a different room, thinking that the ghost would then
go away.</b>
<br><b>One night, she woke up to look at the clock, and Condie was eye
level with</b>
<br><b>her... ...on the top bunk! Condie then motioned her to follow her.
The girl</b>
<br><b>didn't follow her. She instead just closed her eyes tightly.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Bride of Joe Creason Park</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: darren1@mindspring.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have been telling this story for about eight years now--since the
night it happened.&nbsp; I was a freshman at Bellarmine College, a small
Catholic college only slightly larger than a high school at the time.&nbsp;
The fall semester had just begun and, since the weather was warm, my friends
and I decided to play a few games of volleyball on the sand courts.&nbsp;
After two or three games, I announced that I needed to be getting home
because it was nearly dark and the headlight on my motorcycle was broken.&nbsp;
In an effort to avoid a possible traffic violation, I decided to cut through
the park, which surrounds the Collins Estate, a large mansion--now city
park headquarters.</b>
<br><b>I was cruising slowly up the narrow carraigeway with the woods on
my right and the rolling front property on my left.&nbsp; The carraigeway
approaches the mansion on its right side and then curves to the left to
pass in front and wind around the left side.&nbsp; It was as I began the
turn approaching the left side of the house that something unusual caught
my attention.&nbsp; Near the side of the house, about fifty feet from where
I was, was a shape that I immediately identified as a woman in a white
wedding gown.&nbsp; She had her back to me and appeared to be kneeling
toward the house--the gown was very bunched around the ground.&nbsp; I
saw this figure so clearly that I was not initially frightened--perhaps
due to a natual and unconscious tendency toward rationalization.&nbsp;
I immediately thought that there must be a wedding reception or some other
type of celebration that would warrant the presence of the woman in the
gown.&nbsp; However, I couldn't shake the fact that she had been alone
and kneeling next to the house.&nbsp; By the time I reached the top of
the drive, which ends at the back of the house, and noticed the absence
of any type of celebration, I was absolutely convinced of what I had seen--a
ghost.</b>
<br><b>If that were all there is to this particular story, it wouldn't
be very convincing.&nbsp; However, there are others who I later learned
had seen the mysterious woman.&nbsp; My friends and I used to walk deep
into the woods at night to build a campfire and have fun--as college students
will do on occasion.&nbsp; Usually on the way, we would sing and laugh
to hide the fact that the hike always seemed a little scary.&nbsp; On one
particular trip to our favorite area, one of the young ladies became very
quiet.&nbsp; When we arrived and were in the process of setting up, I asked
her what was wrong.&nbsp; She asked, "Didn't you see that woman sitting
just off the path watching us walk past?"&nbsp; I told her that I had not
seen her.&nbsp; I thought of my own experience not even a year earlier
and asked her to describe the woman.&nbsp; I could have predicted the answer--the
woman wore a white gown that looked like a wedding dress.</b>
<br><b>The last time I heard of this mysterious woman was two years later,
when I was a junior in college.&nbsp; My study partner in Philosophy was
another young lady that I had known since grade school.&nbsp; One night
we studied at the library until closing time, which was 10:00PM.&nbsp;
I decided to go home but she said she wanted to study further in the dorm
lobby.&nbsp; A few hours later, while she was on her way home in the car,
she noticed something as she drove past what had originally been the large
front property of the mansion.&nbsp; It seemed like a white flash.&nbsp;
She dismissed it as fatigue but, as she neared the bridge that crosses
Beargrass Creek, a woman in white was standing in the middle of the road.&nbsp;
My friend swerved to avoid hitting the woman, whom she had seen very clearly,
but the figure vanished.&nbsp; I told her of my experience only after she
related her terrifying experience to me the next day.&nbsp; I'm not sure
what's there but it's the closest thing I've ever had to a real experience
concerning the supernatural.</b><b></b>

<br><b>BRASS BED GHOST</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Bratshat@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a true story that began around 1997, when
I was 14 to 15 years</b>
<br><b>old.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I live in a little town that
has seen the stage coach days, big</b>
<br><b>railroad times, along with different mining substances.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was going into the 8th grade we
moved up the hill from my home of</b>
<br><b>the last 8 to 9 years, and our new home was where there had once
been a mining</b>
<br><b>camp located in the 1930's to about the late 40's, early 50's, and
before that</b>
<br><b>an old stage coach stop was located in the same vacinity.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After we lived there about a year, my mom
and dad was walking around</b>
<br><b>our property, and found an old brass bed half buried in the dirt.
Since they</b>
<br><b>both love antiques, they dug it up and brought it home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mom sanded and painted the brass head,
and foot boards along with the</b>
<br><b>whole frame. After she was finished with it she put it in my room,
which is</b>
<br><b>one of three in a double wide mobile home. Soon after that strange
things</b>
<br><b>started happening, even though it took us years to put the two things</b>
<br><b>together.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It started very lightly
at first, so lightly it could be imagination</b>
<br><b>and/or forgetfullness. I guess the first thing I can really remember
is my neices</b>
<br><b>and nephews (which are 8 to 12 years younger than I) being scared
to go in my</b>
<br><b>room and most especially by themselves. Of course that could be
overlooked because</b>
<br><b>kids hearing things and reading more into it, but it didn't just
scare the</b>
<br><b>kids some of the adults (sister and sister in-law mostly) were uncomfortable
and</b>
<br><b>a litle scared of that room.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The funny
thing is, I was never really scared at all. I don't even know</b>
<br><b>when or how I came to the knowledge something was different, I just
know one day I</b>
<br><b>was in my room alone and I said out loud " Please don't ever show
yourself to</b>
<br><b>me because it would scare me to death" and rather that was why or
not, He</b>
<br><b>never showed me himself. I call him he because I felt that he was
a man, probably an</b>
<br><b>older man or middle aged. I gave him the name of George, and it
didn't seem to</b>
<br><b>bother him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have friends stay
the night, and the next morning they would be</b>
<br><b>asking me about who was standing at the foot of the bed the night
before,</b>
<br><b>when</b>
<br><b>I knew no one had. I hadn't told them about George.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mom was slapped in the face one night,
but nobody was around to have</b>
<br><b>done it. My sister was shoved into my moms room when nobody else
was near that</b>
<br><b>could have done it. But none of the incidents was done in an evil
way.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing that was probably
the strangest was my "Potsi Bear", a</b>
<br><b>stuffed Panda Bear I recieved from my sister for Christmas one year.
I hung</b>
<br><b>my "Potsi Bear" up on a plant hook in my bedroom, and I began to
notice that</b>
<br><b>no matter where I moved to, in my room my "Potsi Bear" would follow
me with</b>
<br><b>his eyes. He would be turned and looking at me in any direction
I was at in</b>
<br><b>my room. I thought it might be just me, being paranoid, but the
first time my</b>
<br><b>sister went into my room after hanging up the bear, she told me
to take it</b>
<br><b>down because it scared her and made her feel uneasy, because she
also noticed</b>
<br><b>it would move always in the direction she could be seen.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The night before I was
to be married was another memorable time,</b>
<br><b>because at bedtime, right around 11:00 p.m., I and my parents had
gone to</b>
<br><b>bed. (and a habit of mine and my mothers is to read for 30 to 45
minutes</b>
<br><b>before turning out light and going to sleep.) I read only for about
fiften</b>
<br><b>minutes, and turned out my light, I couldn't fall asleep because
I was</b>
<br><b>nervous about the next day. I was laying ther thinking and heard
my mom shut</b>
<br><b>her bedside lamp off, and within a couple of minutes my bed started
shaking</b>
<br><b>and moving, not violently, but enough to scare the heck out of me.
My first</b>
<br><b>thought was an earthquake, so I yelled out to my mother to see if
she was</b>
<br><b>still awake and could feel the earthquake that was still going on.
My mom had</b>
<br><b>still been awake she said, she had just turned her lamp out. But
she didn't</b>
<br><b>feel anything and aked if I had been dreaming, I told her no I haven't
went</b>
<br><b>to sleep yet, and my bed is still shaking.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I realized it could not be
an earthquake because if I felt it that</b>

3 songs until silent night&nbsp; i started hearing voices singing down
the street ( she lives at the top of a dead end). I knew right away it
wasnt carolers because it was in the middle of march! i asked olga if she
heard voices that werent ours down the street and she said no. So then
i thought it was my imagination.But when we got to jolly old saint nicholasshe
started to hear them too.So we kept on singing because we wanted to see
if it was still going! Then her mom came out to check on us,but the thing
that struck me was the voices kept on singing even when her mom was out
there and her mom NEVER EVER heard a thing.so the next year me and olga
and our other friend kaitlyn slept over olgas house and we made a ouji
board and we talked to this spirit named abbigail norber who died in a
fire at age 4 in phili!Now i thought it was wierd because we lived in connecticut.but

To this very day we keep getting more and more ghosts.now this is a believer

<p><b>A TRUE Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kansaidan@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Every word of this story is TRUE. I am a believer.</b>
<br><b>In 1967, we moved into an old, early 1900s rental house. I was 15,
my brother was 13, and there was my mother and our stepfather.</b>
<br><b>Just inside the front door was an expansive living area with a shiny,
golden-brown wood floor. A fireplace adorned the west wall. But on the
floor to the right of the fireplace was the most hideous spot, a two-foot
oblong shape that was black at the center and fading to reddish brown at
the edges.</b>
<br><b>I told my mother that I would remove it. "It can't be removed,"
she said. "People have tried." I cajoled my mother to tell me more, and,
with an unusual amount of hesitancy, she finally relented.</b>
<br><b>Three years before, the landlord had told her, a man, a woman, and
their children, a boy and a girl, lived in the house. One night the children
heard their parents shouting, so, curious, they tiptoed down the stairs
and peered out into the large room from behind a flimsy, plastic accordion
door.</b>
<br><b>Their father went outside and they heard the car trunk slam. He
blasted back through the front door wielding a shotgun. He knocked his
wife to the floor and shot her. Without hesitation, he put the barrel in
his mouth and pulled the trigger, blowing pieces of himself back into a
small bedroom located behind the fireplace.</b>
<br><b>Mom said the rent was a good deal, so despite the horrific history,
she paid the deposit. She hoped I wouldn't be upset about her choice of
living accommodations. "Freaky story!" I commented, with teenage bravado,
not really half believing it. But later, I would regret my blas&eacute;
attitude.</b>
<br><b>Oppressive adequately describes the atmosphere in that house. Once,
when home alone, I tried to scrub the spot with liquid cleaner, Brillo
pads, and then sandpaper. All to no avail. It felt as if some unknown entity
watched while I labored.</b>
<br><b>On the sunniest of days, the dark interior closed in. It seemed
the windows would not allow light to enter. The house was dark, but the
bedroom behind the fireplace seemed the epitome of darkness. On the hottest
of summer days, I would enter the room and feel an immediate chill. We,
unspoken, left it empty.</b>
<br><b>As the weeks passed, I noticed my parent’s and brothers personalities
change. Once eternally happy, now my folks fought and quarreled, sometimes
into the early morning hours. I recall wondering how could anyone have
that much energy to argue so vehemently, for so long. Did they ever sleep?
My brother became morose and alienated himself from the family. He began
to leave the house at night, exiting through an upstairs window and clambering
out onto the roof.</b>
<br><b>Other strange phenomena occurred. I stumbled on my brother and his
two friends in the old dirt basement under the kitchen playing with a ouija
board. "Where did you find it?" I asked. They told me it was in the dirt
behind the furnace. I watched as they asked questions while the planchet
zipped around the board.</b>
<br><b>A strange malevolence gripped us. My mother fell ill with grand
mal epileptic seizures. A hideous boil erupted on the calf muscle of my
left leg. I heard mysterious noises, and during the evening hours, flitting
shadows skirted at the periphery of my vision.</b>
<br><b>One afternoon, mom cried out, "Come here. Look at this!" When I
arrived at her bedroom closet door, she swung it open. On the floor sat
a lifelike doll. I am not exaggerating when I say the doll was surrealistically
human appearing: it was about 3-feet tall, porcelain skin with all the
color and nuances of flesh, bushy, thick hair done up in brown ringlets,
and those eyes--glistening, moist, large blue eyes that I swore followed
me around the room. Shirley Temple came to mind. "Where did you get THAT?"
I asked. It just showed up, she said, out of the blue.</b>
<br><b>As incidents accelerated, and temperaments deteriorated, mom finally
said, "We're moving!" They packed up everything and moved the furniture
up to a new place.</b>
<br><b>For some reason, because of a test, perhaps a school project, or
the new house was just too far away, I couldn't leave the house on that
last night and move up to the new place. I told mom that it would be more
convenient if I spent the night alone in the old rental. They could pick
me up, along with the last few boxes of goods, after school the next day.</b>
<br><b>So, after hanging out with a friend, I arrived at the house around
9pm. (To this day, I don't know why I decided to stay overnight alone.
I must have had a good reason!) I made a bed on the floor in front of the
fireplace. Not a living soul was in the house. A few boxes were piled near
the wall opposite the fireplace and me. I extinguished all the lights and
settled in to sleep. If I had moved my feet 12 inches to the north, they
would have touched that onerous spot. Somehow, soon, I was fast asleep.</b>
<br><b>My eyes fluttered, and I groggily awoke. Something wasn't right.
When I had dozed off earlier, the house was black and dark as an unlit
coal mine, but now I detected light. I glanced at my alarm clock. It said
3:15am.</b>
<br><b>A ghostly muted yellow, pulsating light cascaded across the floor,
over the boxes, and up the wall. A gray shadow filled its center. I froze
with fear pondering the question of who turned on the light, but soon succumbed
to curiosity.</b>
<br><b>I rose up on my elbow and gazed past the spot, past the doorway
of the cold bedroom, and toward my mother's bedroom where the light emanated
from. In the doorway, silhouetted by light rays from within her room, stood
the doll, its arms outstretched, and even though it was backlit, I could
see a pair of glowing eyes.</b>
<br><b>Needless to say, I didn't sleep. I didn't move. At sunrise, I jumped
up and dashed out of the house never to return.</b><b></b>
