<span style="font-weight: bold;">My Family's Stories</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DUNELLE@aol.com</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; My mother and father married at
a very young age and had four children before my mother was 24 years of
age.&nbsp; My mom was very close with her parents and would pack us
kids up and visit for the day several times a week.&nbsp; My
grandmother was a loud, beautiful woman from England.&nbsp; She loved
yellow roses, even wore perfume that smelled of roses.&nbsp; The smell
of her perfume would linger for minutes after she left a room.&nbsp; My
grandparents raised six children that had an eighteen year age span,
they didn't have much, but they did love each other!&nbsp; When they
celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary, my grandfather bought my
grandmother a gold watch.&nbsp; She was over the moon, never having
received something like that before.&nbsp; Shortly after their
anniversary, my grandmother passed away from breast cancer. No one in
the family knew she had it.&nbsp; She knew, and never went to a
doctor.&nbsp; I was six years old at the time and remember my mom took
it so hard.&nbsp; She remained in her bed for days at a
time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a couple of months my mom started to be
able to cope and move forward somewhat.&nbsp; I had always given them
trouble sleeping, even as an infant my mom says she was lucky if I went
an hour without crying.&nbsp; By the time I was six I was having night
terrors and would run from my room screaming during the night.&nbsp; My
dad would always rock me back to sleep.&nbsp; My mom bought a rocking
chair and placed it next to their bedroom, in our living room.&nbsp; My
parents room was on one side of the house and all the other rooms were
on the other side.&nbsp; I guess my mom thought it would be easier to
get me to start falling back to sleep on my own with the rocking chair
and having it next to their room they could still at least rest while
keeping an eye on me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once we had the rocking
chair, I got into the habit of asking if I could go to bed early.&nbsp;
I loved falling asleep in the rocking chair.&nbsp; I began to hear
noises coming from my parents room one night.&nbsp; Everyone was in the
kitchen, I believe my cousins were over at the time.&nbsp; I went into
the kitchen and told my mom someone was in her room.&nbsp; She told me
no one was in there it was probably the furnace kicking in or some
other excuse.&nbsp; Every night I would rock in that chair and the
noises got louder and more distinct. I was sure someone was in their
going through my parents dressers.&nbsp; I would tell my parents but
they just shrugged it off.&nbsp; My dad worked straight afternoons so
it was usually my mom as she was the one home with us kids all the
time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My brothers, mom and I were watching t.v.
together in the living room one night.&nbsp; I was again in my rocking
chair.&nbsp; I told my mom yet again someone was in her room.&nbsp;
This time she turned the television down.&nbsp; Her eyes got big and
she looked at my oldest brother (he is six years older than me) and
could tell he could hear the noises too.&nbsp; My dad kept a shot gun
in the house (not loaded), my brother grabbed the shot gun and slowly
opened the bedroom door, turned the lights on and found....the bed in
the middle of the room, all the dresser drawers open and all the
drawers to my moms jewelry box open.&nbsp; Also, there was a strong
smell of perfume.&nbsp; My mom shared with me years later that when her
mom passed away my grandfather wanted my grandmother buried with the
gold watch he had bought her.&nbsp; The night she passed away, my
grandfather had helped her to bed as she said she wasn't feeling well
and he placed her watch on the dresser as she had asked.&nbsp; Several
people had come to visit her that night, including family, my mom and
my dad's mom were actually on their way with us kids but decided not to
go because they thought she needed her rest.&nbsp; Well, to get to the
point, when my grandmother passed and my grandfather went to get the
watch, it was gone.&nbsp; So my mom wonders if it was her mother
searching for the watch she so loved.&nbsp; The occurrences only
happened for several months and then stopped.&nbsp; However I have had
many experiences&nbsp; since then.&nbsp; I will share them another
time.&nbsp; </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Haunting In Renton Highlands</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
zel1heeroyuy@hotmail.com</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I have personally experienced these
more then once on a continual bases. Right near where I live there have
been several rather brutal events, there is a dirt path (short cut) I
use to get home quicker, I have felt around 11 pm and 12 am a dark
spirit that follows you down the short path right up to where the next
street starts, I get filled with panic and walk faster. You feel the
eyes on&nbsp; even as you walk further away but only the eyes. The
duplex I live in is built over another apartment building that burnt
down or so I have been told by some the neighbors that have lived here
longer. In the backroom of the house there is a woman who watches you,
I have asked my neighbors about this and at least one of them as had
the same feeling. If you stay back there long enough she goes gives up
for the time and comes back later. Renton is well known for being a
former mining area, I have also felt the hostel spirit of miner in the
hallways of my house. He can not however enter my bedroom where there
is a spirit of scared little boy who hides in the corner and a little
girl from a later time period lives (these I have only seen/felt once
of twice). I used to when I would fall into a deep sleep have one of
two things happen: the first one I have had happen into separate rooms
the living room and my bedroom. The spirit of an angry woman chokes me
and your stuck you can&#8217;t escape from her grasp unless you quote the
bible or pray to God, the second thing is again a demonic looking
spirit that claws at you but can&#8217;t reach you (as well as voices right
as I'm going to sleep). These however not the only events I have
experienced, my mothers side of the family is known for having the
ability and misfortune of attracting some of these type of things. The
only real good experiences I have had are: the time a saw a girl in a
neon orange vest (almost hunting gear type of clothes) with curl brown
hair appear, we looked at each other and then she vanished. This was at
my mother apartment in Seattle, the girl didn&#8217;t glow or have anything
that marked her as a abnormal and was as real as if I someone living
was there. The other good event that happened to me took place in
Renton, I was baking in my kitchen I had forgotten something in my
cookie batter and dryer kept on going off behind me. I added the
forgotten ingredients and the dryer stopped going off.</span><br

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Haunted ISU Frat House Normal, IL</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By: isu_seneca@yahoo.com</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I submitted the listing for the
private address in Lexington, but I would also like to comment on the
old fraternity house.&nbsp; I was a member of that house that is
haunted at Illinois State University.&nbsp; The girl, and I can't
recall her name, was murdered there in the 70's, as I was a law
enforcement officer I know this for a fact.&nbsp; It happened over
Christmas break as she was the only one in the residence and all the
others had went home.&nbsp; This is why ISU no longer allows students
to stay on campus during winter or summer breaks by themselves in the
Frat or Sorority houses.&nbsp; The place is indeed haunted.&nbsp; The
spirit(s) mess with the rooms and are very active; it's a very scary
place to be when alone----in particular the basement.&nbsp; In fact, a
local news crew did a special on the haunting in 2000 and several of my
frat brothers were interviewed.&nbsp; One story is that on Halloween
1997 she was seen moving through the crowd in a party that they were
having in the basement and in the back yard.&nbsp; She had hollow black
eyes and a grim look upon her face.&nbsp; Everyone thought it was a
Halloween costume until people stated that she had no feet.&nbsp; Also,
in 2000 upon returning from the Big Easy for Mardi Gras, several
brothers had many necklaces laid upon their beds to find them in the
morning on the floor laid out in a strange pattern; all perfectly
circled and overlapping.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ghost of Child Actor Who Died in Fire</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By: npcathro@gmail.com </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;In '99 I was 23 years old and
had just graduated college. I wanted to become an actor so I went to
all sorts of auditions, including one for a professional theatre called
the Arrow Rock Lyceum. We rehearsed in a rehearsal hall for one and a
half weeks and then moved to the theatre where we began technical
rehearsals.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were so many men in the show that we were
put in what is traditionally the women's dressing room because it is
slightly bigger. They were working on refurbishing the dressing room
because of some sort of fire that had happened a few years ago. I
didn't bother to ask if anyone died in the fire because I assumed it
was an electrical fire.&nbsp; So one day I was using the restroom and
when I flushed the toilet I heard screaming. It sounds stupid, but I
heard screaming. It sounded like my 8 year old niece when she watches
scary movies. I was spooked and asked one of the stagehands about it.
He told me that in '94 some little girl had gotten trapped in the
dressing room in a fire and haunted the theater now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I thought he was crazy at first but then I started seeing and hearing
more things. Like, when I was onstage I looked up into the rafters and
could have sworn I saw a little girl watching us. Then one night, I
forgot my dorm key in the dressing room so I called the stage manager
and he let me into the theatre. It was very dark and I heard singing.
Cute little girl singing, but something about it didn't seem right.
Then props began to disappear right when they were needed onstage,
costumes were found ripped and stained, one night a set piece almost
crushed one of the main actresses. One night the power went out and in
the blackness, I heard the singing again and it got very cold. I felt
like someone was standing behind me and breathing on my neck, I spun
around and reached out into the darkness but no one was there. A child
giggled, at first I thought it was someone in the audience, but then I
realized we were doing an adult play, there were no children in the
audience. I started to research the girl in the fire and came across a
newspaper article from the day after she died. It talked about how a
costume rack was found jamming the door and one of the actors
mysteriously left the night of the accident. Now I knew the ghosts
name, Carolyn Brown. The article says some people think the fire was
electrical, but the parents think it was arson. I believe it was arson
and she was murdered, otherwise why would she have come back to haunt
the theatre. When the show closed I packed up and left Arrow Rock never
to return again. Since then I have quit acting because of Carolyn Brown
and have become a math teacher. I have been dying to share my story but
have never found a place to until I stumbled upon this website. Please
tell me what you think, have any of you ever been to Arrow Rock,
Missouri and seen similar things?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Haunted House in Lexington Il</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By:isu_seneca@yahoo.com</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hello: </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I moved to Lexington, IL in the fall
of 1999 and lived there until I purchased a new house in the fall of
2002.&nbsp; Odd things would happen quite a bit, but I never paid
attention enough I suppose, because they never really had any effect on
me.&nbsp; However, others seemed to be fair game for the spirits that
dwelt there.&nbsp; One time, my wife and I came home to hear our cat's
cries.&nbsp; But, we couldn't seem to find her and it seemed as though
she was in the crawl space.&nbsp; But, there was no way she could have
gotten in there as the access was in the garage and covered by 1/2"
plywood door that was rather heavy to lift up.&nbsp; Sure enough, I
went out there and lifted up the door and out she came.&nbsp; This
dumbfounded us as we knew there was no way she could have lifted that
door, let alone get outside into the garage to begin with.&nbsp; the
cats would always meow at invisible to us figures as we went to bed,
but again we were never effected by what was going on.&nbsp; One time
my brother in law came to my house, we walked to the local bar and
walked back around 1:00 AM and went to bed.&nbsp; When I awoke in the
morning my brother in law asked me if I had been up in the night and I
stated that I had not been.&nbsp; I then asked him why? And, he replied
that someone had folded his clothes so nicely and folded them on the
back of the couch that he was sleeping on; we both were dumbfounded
about this?&nbsp; Having a haunted house never occurred to me as the
house was built in 1994 and it was the late 90's early 2000's.&nbsp;
However, as I was getting ready to move, my neighbor lady came over and
asked me if anything ever weird happened in the house.&nbsp; I really
didn't think about it, and stated that nothing had happened to me and
ask her why she was asking?&nbsp; She stated that we were the third
owners of the house and that her aunt and uncle had lived there first
as they had built the house.&nbsp; I didn't know this!&nbsp; She went
on to say that her aunt died of cancer in the living room, where my
brother in law so happened to sleep that one night, and that her uncle
was so saddened by her death that he hung himself in the garage from
the attic access ladder.&nbsp; She stated that the previous owners of
the house had experienced tons of activity and that it was not uncommon
for them to come home with the garage door open, all the lights on in
the house and in the garage and the attic access ladder down.&nbsp; I
can't recall all that she told me, but it was substantial.&nbsp;
However, when she told me this was the last night we owned the house as
the next day we were selling it.&nbsp; I told her I had never
experienced anything of that nature as I was a law enforcement officer,
I always locked every access into the house anytime I left and while I
was there, unless it was summer and we had the doors open for
breeze.&nbsp; However, I left her to take the second to last load from
that house to our new house, I went back to get the last couple of
items.&nbsp; When I arrived (mind you I left when it was still light
out and left no lights on inside the house) every light was on in the
house, the garage door was open and the attic access light was
down.&nbsp; Well, that about scared the crap out of me, needless to
say.&nbsp; I grabbed my stuff and told the spirits that they could have
it back.&nbsp; I am a Bible thumping Christian and don't believe that
ghost are the spirits of the departed dead, as the Bible teaches
otherwise.&nbsp; I will state that I do believe that we (my wife, child
and I) were protected by the Holy Spirit from any demonic activity that
was going on in there.&nbsp; Oddly enough, I quit my job at the
sheriff&#8217;s department after graduating from Illinois State University
and took a job at State Farm Insurance.&nbsp; The couple that purchased
my house, I ended up working with the husband.&nbsp; He told me that
weird stuff continued quite often while he was living there until they
sold the property last year.&nbsp; </span><br

<span style="font-weight: bold;">In Regards to Saint Anne's School In
Lansing Illinois</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By: jptingle68@gmail.com&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I saw you have the story of the Boy
who Haunts Saint Ann's but I have a ghost story that took place during
April of 2001. I had recently moved from New Jersey to Lansing and my
parents were looking into new Catholic schools for my Brother and I to
attend. Saint Ann's was within walking distance of my home so it was
the simplest and most obvious choice. My Mother had exchanged phone
calls with a Sister who claimed to work in the school (her name now
escapes both myself and my Mother) and a date was set for us to go see
the School the following week. The following week came and upon arrival
The Principle had no scheduled tours for that day, a matter of fact the
school had a policy of not taking new students after mid way through
the school year. Concerned, she asked whom we had scheduled this tour
with. When we told her the sisters name who had taken the calls the
Principles face dropped, there had been a sister at Saint Ann's by that
name however she had passed away a year or two prior.&nbsp; We never
did attend St, Ann's instead we chose Our Lady of Knock (now closed) a
few miles away. Just thought I'd share.</span><br

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Experience NB HS </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By: PPrincipate@positivepromotions.com
</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I live one town over and I often go to
the North Babylon HS to collect empty bottles/cans which I then cash in
as it helps me w/the care and feeding of my feral colony located at my
place of employ in Hauppauge.&nbsp; One particular sunny day last year
I was on the school grounds doing my usual nothing out of the ordinary
going on around me. As I pass by the handball/tennis courts/baseketball
court area which was on my right the school on my left, I hear behind
me the thump thump thump of a basketball and I feel like there is
someone behind me but I didn&#8217;t recall hearing any voices nor were there
people anywhere near to where I was, so I turn around and nothing, I
feel a bit creeped out (though I don&#8217;t know why) and I continue to walk
on the concrete walkway all the while glancing into the school because
I really feel like there&#8217;s someone behind me and I don&#8217;t want to turn
around again so I figure let me look into the windows for another
reflection. And nothing! I hear the basketball again thump thump and
this time I hear walking like sneakers or something on the walkway
directly behind me, I shoot around real quick &#8211; Nothing. Now I&#8217;m
totally panicked as I&#8217;m alone there and I start to say to myself
there&#8217;s something wrong here, but it&#8217;s a school how could there be
something this creepy here&#8230;.all of a sudden I feel like something is
about to rush up on me from behind and with that I take off never
looking behind me the whole while I was running thru the grounds and
out to the front parking lot!!! I never went back there again to this
day. Anyway the reason why I send this is because I go on your website
and there it was haunted North Babylon HS. I never read the rest of the
paragraph cause I was too sick and had such a weird feeling in the pit
of my stomach, I had truly experienced something w/o even knowing it
existed..and why it chose to show to make it&#8217;s presence known is beyond
me, I had been going to this school for long long collecting my bottles
walking the grounds going over to walk the track at the other end of
the school grounds. However that particular day not like the rest.
Thank you for listening. </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<span style="font-weight: bold;">In the summer around 1989 we were
looking for a home to buy.&nbsp; My husband and I were in our late
twenties with three kids, ages 5,4, and 3. (boy, girl, boy).&nbsp; A
relator took us to a newer house in Valencia, Ca.&nbsp; It was
vacant.&nbsp; Outside the residence our Realtor began describing the
neighborhood, the features of the house.&nbsp; I glanced over at our
kids and noticed they were standing in front of the garage; our oldest
son appeared to be engaged in conversation with someone about his
height.&nbsp; Our daughter began to speak with this empty space also,
as our youngest son was looking on.&nbsp; It appeared our children were
playing ball with another child, bouncing it back and forth, except
there was NO ball and NO child standing in front of them. The ball
would bounce off the garage door sometimes, but again, there was no
ball.&nbsp; I mentioned it to my spouse that it looked like our
children were talking with a child, but we could not see anyone.&nbsp;
The Realtor then escorted us inside the home, it was vacant and empty,
it looked and smelled freshly painted, we started in the kitchen.&nbsp;
I heard our oldest son talking, and looked over my shoulder in the
hallway.&nbsp; I saw him underneath the stairs, his siblings standing
behind him, again he was talking to empty space. it looked liked our
son was holding a ball, but there was no ball.&nbsp; We all wandered
outside near the backyard pool, passing an empty living room, freshly
painted white with a new carpet smell.&nbsp; Our kids ran behind the
patio and pool, onto the embankment, lined with trees. Behind the tree
line our children called out to me; they found bones and dead
animals.&nbsp; Thinking I would find the family pet partially buried, I
was surprised to see hundreds of dead skeletal remains of small
animals; rodents, cats, dogs, etc. They encompassed the entire area,
from one wall to the other, hidden from the view of the patio. The
animals were on top of the dirt, not buried.&nbsp; Inside, I would
later discover our daughter saw an old woman, rocking in a rocking
chair, in the living room, she described that empty living room as
fully furnished. I believe this woman spoke to our little girl, but I
had called out to our daughter to come to where I was, and our daughter
never drew closer to what she referred to as &#8220;the Grandmother.&#8221;&nbsp;
Upstairs my husband went one direction with the Realtor and I started
to follow, but our&nbsp; older son went the other direction.&nbsp; I
turned around to get our son and saw him starring into a bedroom.&nbsp;
I&nbsp; only saw the one bedroom fully furnished, an older looking
wooden bedroom set, chest of drawers, a rocking chair, &#8220;rocking.&#8221;&nbsp;
There was a brown, patterned wallpaper covering the walls.&nbsp; Our
oldest son went to enter the bedroom and I grabbed him by the back of
his shirt.&nbsp; Something felt wrong. Mother&#8217;s intuition.&nbsp; That
small voice from within said to get him out of the house, not to let
him enter the room.&nbsp; That feeling of urgency and intense need to
keep our son from crossing the threshold into that bedroom was
overwhelming.&nbsp; I suppose that&#8217;s when my daughter heard me calling
her. I pulled our son back from the bedroom door, and walked down the
stairs, calling out to our other two children in a voice that made them
come quickly towards me. I hurriedly walked all of us straight out the
front door, right to the car, leaving their Dad behind with the Relator
upstairs. I noticed our oldest son was carrying a blue ball.&nbsp; He
said the little boy had given it to him, could he keep it?&nbsp; I
don&#8217;t know why there was a sense of compassion for the little boy I
never saw, but I said, &#8220;fine,&#8221; after all the little boy had given him
the ball.&nbsp; After securing the children in the car, I quickly went
upstairs, my spouse and the Realtor were now standing in front of &#8220;that
bedroom.&#8221;&nbsp; When I reached the top of the stairs, something must
have shown on my face, because the Realtor mentioned it. The bedroom
was empty, fresh paint, no wallpaper, new carpet, no furniture, no
rocking chair, no Grandmother. I told my husband we needed to leave
&#8220;Now.&#8221;&nbsp; No discussing the sale of the house with the Realtor, she
had a shocked looked on her face, as I nervously and quickly tried to
described a fully furnished room that now stood empty.&nbsp; I told my
husband our son saw a Grandmother in this room, who was telling our son
to come closer to her, I asked the Realtor about the Grandmother, it
only added to her confused looked.&nbsp; My husband loved me enough to
quickly follow me out the door.&nbsp; Our son told us about the
conversation with little boy.&nbsp; Apparently he had drown in the
pool.&nbsp; The little boy told our son he was afraid of his
grandmother, and if she grabbed him to go through the closet upstairs,
it would lead to the kitchen downstairs and he could get away that
way.&nbsp; Get away from what?????&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#8217;t understand why
the living room and bedroom appeared to have furniture.&nbsp; I would
never have known that bedroom was empty with fresh paint and new
carpeting if I had not returned for my husband, the appearance of a
fully furnished room and rocking chair was that solid.&nbsp; I have
never found an answer to what happened to us that day, do you
know?&nbsp; Note: Our kids kept the ball and played with it until it
wore out and became flat.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Funny Ghost Story</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
OCONNEK@uk.ibm.com </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I know that ghost stories are supposed
to creep you out and keep you awake and and I have experience so many
that I could easily do that, but I am feeling in a jovial mood. So here
goes.&nbsp; I grew up in Southern Ireland, in a small town where there
was a mixture of new and old properties. The house my mum and dad
bought when I was 13 years old was extremely haunted It was a house
built by Famine victims for the local lord and added to over time by
various owners.&nbsp; One day my mum was by herself with my little
brother who was about six months old. She was sat in the living room
watching TV. She then heard a baby crying and on automatic pilot got up
to go the bedroom the noise was coming from. When she got to the door
she stopped herself and thought I just put him down he in the mosses
basket. She looked behind her and he was fast asleep in the mosses
basket near the sofa.&nbsp; The baby in the back bedroom though was
still crying. My mum got very freaked and took my brother in his basket
and sat in the back garden until we got home. The crying went on for
about 40 mins. My mum hates anything ghost related and hated that she
felt she had to leave the house. That eve she called the local priest
and arranged for him to come and bless the house. Now this is the
really funny bit. I am know to laugh at inappropriate times so I am and
was used to the looks I got from my mum. My dad shares this trait. My
mum scrubbed the house top to bottom made posh sandwiches, scones and
cakes and bought Sherry. The priest although not old was well know to
like a drink, any drink. The day came and we all sat there in our best
clothes eating and being good this priest knocked back 3/4 of a litre
of sherry.&nbsp; He is falling down drunk. He then gets the bible out
recites and reads a few bits and throws holy water at the walls, doors
floor and ceiling in every room in between burping and praying. I and
my dad was in hysterics, especially as during this blessing we could
hear the baby start up in the back bedroom and the priest remarking
that it had quite a set of lungs on it. My mum was pale as and asked
the priest into the back bedroom to bless it and fling a bit of holy
water around.&nbsp; Off he went my mum threw me and dad out into the
front garden and we said goodbye to the priest about an hour later as
after the blessing he required a drink for the road. As He left he gave
my mum some holy water and instructed that she throw it at whatever
disturbed her.&nbsp; My dad and I always asked if there where any wet
patches in the house when we came back from school or work. And I
always asked dad if he had any on him after he peed my mum off. This
family joke has been going on for years. That baby never did stop and
could be heard on occasion and to be truthful I think the holy water
peed off some of our regular ghosts as they became more active
afterwards.&nbsp; </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<span style="font-weight: bold;">By:equinanimalfan@live.com </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">last night (8 / 6/2012) my boyfriend
and I went to Sawyers Pond around 11 pm and we got out of the car. I
instantly felt something was not right, we walked down the first dock
that you come to at the entrance of the side that has docks, and we
stopped at the bottom to look into the water and all of a sudden there
was a twig snap and a drop in the water, we figured it was just a bull
frog or some sort of animal since they are known to croak alot. However
then it got windy and the dock sort of started moving, fog began to
surround us even more so we decided to leave. My boyfriend was scared
witless and so was I since I could sense that he was, just as we
reached the car he was holding my hand and he gave it a squeeze i
thought he was messing with me but he wasnt he later told me that he
had felt a pressurized squeeze on his shoulder and he was spooked
really bad because he'd never felt anything like that before. We got
the to car and pretty soon he turned on the headlights he looked at me
and said to me, "did you see that?" Apparently what he saw was a mist
''human'' shaped figure that was running back and forth from one side
to the other. It was really odd but a few people have died at the pond
I have no doubts that one or two of them have been left behind. However
we sat and pondered on it all night it was odd because most entities
that give painful touches are usually black mists unless there's
something else that wasn't showing itself. It didn't help that there
was a red moon that night either.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<span style="font-weight: bold;">This site was built in 1860, there was
a report of a major fire back in the early 1900's but no reports of
deaths at least none that I can find.&nbsp; The site is still in use by
the Draper Family along with other companies who leased out other parts
of the building.&nbsp; I work as a night watch man during 3rd
shift.&nbsp; During my shift I have witnessed several things that
happened.&nbsp; As a night watch man it is required to be at highest
alert for safety measures.&nbsp; So my alert, and awareness are very
sharp.&nbsp; Here are some of the things that has happened during my
shift.&nbsp; During my safety tour there is no one on site as it is
closed.&nbsp; Any employees that are still on site are documented in a
log so we know who is on site.&nbsp; This information is also shared
when I relive the other shift.&nbsp; So when I am on 3rd shift, the
building is empty.&nbsp;&nbsp; During my walk through I have
encountered some strange things.&nbsp; I have had a women's voice say
hello to me I said hello back but nothing. As I was walking up stairs a
shadow figure peek around the corner at the top of the stairs, when I
got to the top to investigate, no one was around.&nbsp; I have had
footsteps from all over, when I went to investigate, again no one was
around.&nbsp; In different sections of the building there is a feeling
of being watched, a very creepy feeling.&nbsp; The scariest thing that
happened to me was very shocking.&nbsp; I was down in the lower level
when right behind me 4 quick footsteps came up on me, it sounded like
someone was about to run up on me.&nbsp; When I turned around I was
expecting someone to be there, instead there was no one.&nbsp; At that
same time there was a chill in the air, it scared me to the point that
I ran up the stairs with my heart pounding.&nbsp; All of these claims
have been verified by other employees.&nbsp; Some sounds I have
debunked, but all the ones I have mentioned I can not explain.&nbsp;
There is a presence of limestone around the foundation at certain
sections of the building which I understand is a conductor for
paranormal activity.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope you enjoyed my
experiences.&nbsp; The funny part is there are long periods that
nothing happened and all is quite, other times things happen.&nbsp; I
could go 3 weeks to 2 months of nothing going on, then out of no where
things start up again, very strange.&nbsp; But the presence of being
watched is always there, just at different parts of the building.</span><br

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Carnton Plantation Ghost Encounter</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: bold;">I grew up in Franklin, TN; as a highly
nerdy, somewhat morbid child- and later teen- I was fascinated by the
town's history and hauntings.Carnton Plantation, listed on this site,
was used as a makeshift hospital like most large houses during the
Civil War and is noted for playing host to many spirits. Before I knew
about the ghosts, it appealed to my historical interests; after, it
became my favorite place in town.&nbsp; When I was 16, a friend asked
me to his junior prom. We weren't very close, but I agreed for two
reasons: I liked to dress up and the event was being held at Carnton.
The opportunity to be there at night, away from tourists and large
crowds, was a dream come true.&nbsp; Despite watching the house's
windows like a hawk, I saw nothing. My friend and I got a bit
claustrophobic in the large tent where the dance was being held, so we
went to sit on the house's back porch.&nbsp; Other prom goers had been
there throughout the night, but at the time it was empty.&nbsp; As we
talked, I described to him the many ghosts alleged to inhabit Carnton
and expressed disappointment that I'd never seen them. He pointed to
one of the rocking chairs on the porch and said, "Um, now might be your
chance." Sure enough, the empty chair right in front of us was slowly
rocking back and forth.&nbsp; "It's probably just the wind," I said,
not wanting to jump to conclusions. No sooner had the words left my
mouth than the chair stopped dead. Not a slow loss of momentum like
wind would cause- like someone had stopped it on purpose.&nbsp; I
shakily apologized for doubting whoever-it-was and we headed back to
the party. That remains my fondest school dance memory.</span><br

Ellsworth AFB, SD</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hello my name is Ben, I&#8217;ll give you
some brief background on myself.&nbsp; My parents were both in the army
and I grew up in several places around the US.&nbsp; I spent my High
School years in Paris, TN before joining the military and being
stationed at Ellsworth and now in Utah.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve read through some of
the things for area&#8217;s I&#8217;ve lived in.&nbsp; Some I&#8217;ve never known,
other&#8217;s I have.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Paris, TN; Greenwood Cemetery.&nbsp;
My dad was born in Paris in the late 40&#8217;s, and it wasn&#8217;t till after I
experienced this that he told me about the cemetery.&nbsp; This was
around 2000, me and 3 of my friends went to the cemetery after hearing
one of them talking about it being haunted.&nbsp; It&#8217;s always
interested me so I decided to check it out.&nbsp; The night we went it
was a full moon, and was in the eastern sky.&nbsp; Upon driving up I
noticed it seemed to be darker inside the cemetery than outside.&nbsp;
I even hit the high-beams on my truck and didn&#8217;t make a
difference.&nbsp; All we could see was an outline of the first grave
stone, both high and low beam.&nbsp; We drove in to the center of the
cemetery, parked, and started walking around.&nbsp; I walked to the
eastern portion and was looking at the tree line.&nbsp; I could see the
moon lighting the tree tops except for the row closest to the
cemetery.&nbsp; Where there should have been shadows from trees into
the cemetery, there was nothing.&nbsp; It was as if the cemetery itself
was sucking all the light.&nbsp; I walked back to my friends and was
standing looking at a grave stone.&nbsp; Looking up I swear we saw
shadows walking around the entrance of the cemetery.&nbsp; We hopped in
my truck and left right then.&nbsp; The next day I asked my dad about
the cemetery and he told me it was where they used to bury African
Americans during the segregation era.&nbsp; He told me that during his
high school years it was rumored to be haunted, and him and his friends
would dare each other to go in at night. </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ellsworth AFB, SD; Prairie View
housing. I lived in South Dakota area for 9.5 years, spending 3 years
living in the Prairie View housing.&nbsp; This housing section is the
closest to the main gate of Ellsworth, and was rumored to be the site
of a Sioux Indian burial ground.&nbsp; We moved into it in 2004 after a
recent renovation of the housing units.&nbsp; Before I moved in, I was
told by local civilian workers that it was haunted because of the
burial ground.&nbsp; I told my wife, but we never mentioned anything to
our oldest (who was 3 at the time).&nbsp; About one month of living in
the new housing, I found our oldest standing at the bottom of the
stairs looking up and wouldn&#8217;t go upstairs.&nbsp; I asked why he
wouldn&#8217;t go up and he said there was somebody at the top of the
stairs.&nbsp; We noticed that he also wouldn&#8217;t play in his room by
himself unless someone was upstairs.&nbsp; He told us that there was a
little kid who would play with toys.&nbsp; The wife could swear there
were times that the bedroom door would move back and forth by
itself.&nbsp; Our cat would be on the bed staring at the door, and we
had no ceiling fans in the house at all.&nbsp; She would hear singing
in the living room while sitting in the dining room, and no one else in
the house.&nbsp; And when she would turn the lights on, the singing
would come closer and sound like it was right in front of her.&nbsp; We
had friends who would come over to the house, and swear they could see
images.&nbsp; The neighbor&#8217;s would always ask if we had any weird
things happening.&nbsp; </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I wanted to get this out as this to me
was a really interesting experience not to mention one of the most
unique in my life and i wanted to share it with even a few who could
understand what I felt at that moment. I didn&#8217;t know anything about the
area i lived in until this happened, I basically thought it was just
another normal place to live before this but one night me and my
younger brother had fallen asleep on the couch and later that night I
was woken up by my dog where he was climbing onto the couch and being
somewhat fat he could easily wake anyone up. This might make what I&#8217;m
saying here sound somewhat like a fake but stiking with the truth of
that night, it was a full moon and the moon itself gave of somewhat of
a glow that illuminated the area, my backyard, but at the same time
made everything seem so much darker. I think if it wasn&#8217;t for the moon
I probably wouldn&#8217;t have seen what I saw but the moment I saw it I
pretty much froze, the figure was like a liquid gel, less firm and
fluid in movements, only what i can describe as what looked to be water
itself. The moonlight like I said was the only reason I saw it and
basically it seemed that this figure not only dimmed the moonlight in
the area exactly around it but also it absorbed it, giving off it's own
bit of a dim light which in turn is what gave it it's form, it looked
like it was just a simple person walking through my backyard but you
could clearly see it wasn't. It moved slower than normal people do, you
could see right though it while still seeing it, I felt I was froze
with the fascination and an odd fear like no other from what I was
seeing with a chill where i couldn&#8217;t really even move let alone speak.
The memory of what I saw even years after is still as clear as it was
then like when an image is burned into your mind only this time not in
a bad way.</span><br>
