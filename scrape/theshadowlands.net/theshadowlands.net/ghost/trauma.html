Sara Johnson* of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">
knows the fear of living in a haunted house. Several years ago, the </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">St.
  Louis</span></st1:City><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Missouri</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">
home<br>
her family resided in had a healthy case of a haunting. Doors would open and close, sometimes locking members in a room, a<br>
picture of Jesus would reverse on the wall or fall off, apparitions appeared to be standing behind people in mirrors and<br>
water faucets would turn on and off. &#8220;I can&#8217;t answer those questions and I'm not sure I want to,&#8221; Johnson said, when asked<br>
to offer quotes for this article. &#8220;They are disturbing and I don&#8217;t think I can do it.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Indeed, still today, Johnson is haunted by the memories of living in this house. Only 13 at the time, the incidents<br>
occurring left an indelible mark on her past, sometimes resulting in nightmares. Today, after nearly 20 years, she is<br>
still unable to confront them. &#8220;I can&#8217;t go there, not yet,&#8221; she said.<br>
<br>
It&#8217;s trauma such as this that can stay with residents of a haunted house. Most people learn to live with the unusual<br>
incidents associated with living in a haunted house but for some, the trauma can be very real, even permanent.<br>
<br>
&#8220;In a typical haunting, all these things [nightmares, insomnia, depression, addiction, etc.] can be caused by the anxiety many<br>
people feel over the events they are experiencing,&#8221; Dave Juliano, Director of South Jersey Ghost Research<br>
(http://www.sjgr.org/),founder of The Shadowlands: Ghosts and Hauntings (http://theshadowlands.net/ghost/) and author of the<br>
books "Positive Energy for Haunted Homes" and "Ghost Research 101: Investigating Haunted Homes," said. &#8220;They cannot explain<br>what
is happening and the basic fear of the unknown kicks in and the anxiety
starts. In other, less common circumstances, some of<br>
these things may be caused by a non-human or lower level spirit with malicious intent.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;The mind is an amazing organ. If one allows outside interferences to control their way of thinking, a haunting can<br>
produce disastrous effects,&#8221; said Lisa Cox, of MAJDA (http://majda.net/). &#8220;You are as strong as your mind. And it can<br>
play tricks on you, if you let it. One must look upon (the) paranormal with an open mind, but not so open that your brain<br>
falls out. It is absolute that sleeplessness and nightmares can occur. This would be quite normal. However, if depression,<br>
addiction and other symptoms of this seriousness occur, something more is going on. It could be some form of a medical<br>
problem or (to dare to venture into another spectrum) possible possession of another spirit wreaking havoc on the individual's<br>
mind causing a change in personality.&#8221; <br>
<br>
&#8220;Residents who are stressed out about their haunting can experience widely differing levels of trauma, depending upon how<br>
they deal with stress,&#8221; Kristyn Beaty, Acting Assistant Director of South Jersey Ghost Research, said. &#8220;People who are better at<br>
dealing with stress will be more able to cope with a haunting, and keep it in perspective.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Both Juliano and Cox have been on cases where residents experienced trauma from their hauntings.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Each situation is unique but I usually will let them know what I have experienced and then point out that I now purposely go<br>
into strangers&#8217; haunted houses to try to help them,&#8221; Juliano said. &#8220;If things were really that bad I would not be doing that.<br>
With people who are traumatized by a &#8216;regular&#8217; human-spirit haunting, I will also try to point out some &#8216;</span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Hollywood</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">
type&#8217;<br>
scenarios and make the person see that what they are experiencing is nothing compared to the horror movies that the<br>
frame or reference for many people.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;This is a pretty sticky subject, in that yes, we have come across some people who have had these symptoms,&#8221; Cox said.<br>
&#8220;However, I have found no evidence to support that their depression or the other symptoms were caused by the haunting<br>
itself. Unfortunately, we have found this sort (in our investigation) to be more of a mental instability rather than a<br>
haunting. In each of these cases, we found no scientific evidence of paranormal activity. We let the person know this,<br>
and in some cases it eased their minds.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Living in a haunted house can have its interesting moments.&nbsp; Residents have learned to live with furniture moving about or<br>
lights flickering, common characteristics of a haunted house.&nbsp; Yet
some may perceive what they see, hear and feel to be worse<br>
than it actually is, perhaps even bordering on the intolerable.&nbsp;
&#8220;Since the fear is often based on things that the person has<br>
seen on TV, read in books, etc., it is often exaggerated for no reason,&#8221; Juliano said. &#8220;I will work with the person to better<br>
understand their situation, to allow them to come to a realization that there is no reason for the extreme fear.<br>
Teaching the person that negative emotions like fear can increase the activity, and positive emotions may help alleviate<br>
some of the problems, is key.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Positive emotions weren&#8217;t on the mind of Dominic Samson*. His wife, Wynonna*, recounted their experience to me. &#8220;In the Fall<br>
of 2000, my husband and I moved into a charming little house. We rented this house from a woman whose mother lived there for 20<br>
years or so. This lady died in the house, not once but twice!&nbsp; She
called her daughter one morning to say she wasn&#8217;t feeling<br>
well and by the time her daughter arrived along with an ambulance, she had died. The paramedics revived her, but she<br>
died again in the same spot. It was almost a year after the mother died that her daughter decided to rent out the property.<br>
We had never met either woman, and only met the daughter while house hunting. <br>
<br>
&#8221;Before we moved into this house, we had a lot of cleaning to do. Every afternoon my husband and I would go to the house and<br>
spend several hours working there. This is when we first noticed
something was definitely strange. My husband would get a case of<br>
hiccups as soon as he stepped onto the bottom step leading into the yard. This was a city house on a hill with several steps<br>
leading into the yard, and more leading up to the porch. <br>
<br>
&#8220;The first time this happened, we laughed about it because I had never
seen him with hiccups. It was funny. But when we left that<br>
day, as soon as he stepped off that last step onto the street, the hiccups stopped immediately. Since he was plagued by them<br>
for hours, it was noticeable when it stopped.<br>
<br>
&#8220;The next day, the exact same thing happened. As soon as he stepped onto the bottom step the hiccups started and as soon as<br>
he stepped back onto the street they would stop. This went on until the day we moved in, so we were already joking about how<br>
the lady didn&#8217;t like him and didn&#8217;t want him there. <br>
<br>
&#8220;The first time I actually saw the woman, I was in the very spot where she died. I looked up, like when you can just &#8216;feel&#8217;<br>
someone watching you, and there she was&#8230;peeking around the living room corner at me. Bear in mind that I had never seen a<br>
photo of her and had no idea what she looked like in life. This woman did not look at all like her daughter. Later that evening,<br>
I spoke with our landlady and told her what I saw. She and I were becoming friends, and she had my husband and me over for<br>
dinner. I described the woman as tiny and rather stern-looking, with short curly hair. She was wearing a light blue house dress<br>
with a pink floral design. Our landlady teared up and told me that I had described her mother to a &#8216;T&#8217; and that the dress I<br>
described was her favorite&#8230;she wore it all the time before she died. She brought out a photo of her mother and I was floored.<br>
She was definitely the woman I saw. This was only the beginning. <br>
<br>
&#8220;For the next couple of months, I saw the woman from time to time. She never interacted with me, but just seemed to be<br>
watching. My husband&#8217;s experience was quite different. He has always been prone to migraines, but he would get them so bad<br>
that he would be incapacitated. He would feel her pulling his hair and tugging on his beard. When these things happened, he<br>
didn&#8217;t hear her voice but he seemed to understand that she was saying she did not approve of him at all. He says it was more<br>
like words in his head. <br>
<br>
&#8220;We kept our landlady updated on these things. She had actually tried to make contact with her mother since her death with no<br>
success, so she was very interested in any details we could give. When we told her of the hair-pulling and beard- pulling,<br>
she told us that her mother had always been very vocal about not liking men with long hair or beards. My husband has always had<br>
very long hair and a long goatee, so that made sense. <br>
<br>
&#8220;I continued seeing her around the house, and my experiences remained benign. My husband&#8217;s experiences worsened. A stack of 5<br>
or 6 books flew off a table at him even though they had been in that same spot for a week or more. I watched this happen and the<br>
only way to describe it is that they slid off the tabletop and went straight out about 3 feet to hit him. I never had problems<br>
with the windows in the house, but when he was in the bedroom alone in the evenings with the windows open, they would slam<br>
shut. <br>
<br>
&#8220;Now here is what happened the night everything came together and finally ended. My husband got another migraine. This was the<br>
worst I had ever known of him to have, and he hasn&#8217;t had another like it since. He was lying down on the floor with a cold damp<br>
towel wrapped around his head. He couldn&#8217;t bear that for long, so I sat by him in a sort of yoga crossed-leg position and he<br>
rested his head in my lap. That way, I could support his head without the pressure of it being on a pillow. He tossed and<br>
turned, wrapping his arms around his head and kept saying the strangest things. &#8216;YES! I HEAR you!&#8217; and &#8216;PLEASE stop. I WILL!&#8217;<br>
It was like he was having a conversation with someone I couldn&#8217;t hear. I later learned that this was exactly the case. He heard<br>
the woman&#8217;s voice as if she was in the room with us, although I didn&#8217;t hear her. He told me that she kept yelling at him,<br>
directly into his ears. <br>
<br>
&#8220;He kept this up for hours, always saying something to the effect of &#8216;Yes, I will do what you ask. Please leave me alone<br>
now.&#8217; He was feverish so I feared he was hallucinating or something like that, but his medication didn&#8217;t help at all. Then<br>
out of the blue he rose up and looked at me. He said, &#8216;Tell Jane* to get the ring out of the box and wear it. You have to<br>
remember to tell her.&#8217; I agreed, and then he grabbed his pillow and fell asleep on the floor. <br>
<br>
&#8220;The next day, we went to our landlady&#8217;s house very early. We sat in her dining room, right across from the box containing her<br>
mother&#8217;s ashes. When we told her what happened the night before, she
started crying and left the room. We were both afraid we had<br>
stepped over the line in telling her but when she returned, she held out her hand. She was wearing a big ring with several<br>
different types of stones. She called it a &#8216;Tree of Life&#8217; ring, and then told us the story behind it. &#8220;She owned a ring that her<br>
mother liked, and her mother owned a ring that she liked. Every so often they would trade and wear each other&#8217;s ring. When her<br>
mother died, she placed that ring in a box and never wore it again. After she put her mother&#8217;s ring back on, my husband never<br>
had another migraine in the year we lived there, he never felt the hair pulling or beard pulling, the windows never slammed<br>
shut and I never saw her again.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Even though Wynonna&#8217;s husband experienced trauma during this time they lived in their home, he tells me today, "At the time<br>
this happened, I was teaching Magick classes both publicly at a store and privately with appointments. I just thought she wanted<br>
me to leave the house. I didn't really think she was trying to communicate. It affected me directly by the fact that I never<br>
wanted to be at home and the migraines and of course the incessant hiccups that would cease as soon as I placed my feet<br>
on the street. The hiccups alone were difficult to tolerate, but the hair pulling, beard pulling and migraines were worse.<br>
Looking back, I wish that I could have been better able to communicate with her. Maybe she wouldn't have been as hard on me<br>
then."<br>
<br>
He added, "When we lived in that house, it was very uncomfortable for me to be there. During the first two weeks it<br>
was constant...whenever I was in the house, but after the first two weeks it was only occasionally. When she told me about the<br>
ring and how she wanted me to tell her daughter to wear it, that was at the end of the first two weeks. Afterward, I only heard<br>
her and felt her presence once in a while."<br>
<br>
Thankfully, the experiences the Samsons had in their home hasn&#8217;t resulted in any long-term trauma. &#8220;I think the torment was<br>
actually a by-product of her trying to communicate, although I think she didn't like me, anyway. The only long-term effects of<br>
this situation on me are the unpleasant memories and a slightly entertaining story about it all. Because I was familiar with the<br>
esoteric world before all this started, I was able to go through it without being scarred.&#8221; <br>
<br>
This is exactly the kind of attitude Beaty says will help someone who has experienced supernatural episodes while living<br>
in a haunted house. &#8220;I think that the way people deal with stress is the bottom line,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If someone is able to<br>
maintain a positive outlook on life, the person will not be as dramatically affected as someone who is constantly feeling<br>
stressed.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Keeping a positive outlook is a good way of dealing with strange happenings while in a haunted house. But for Julia Daniels*, of<br>
Red Oak, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">,
the experiences in her new home compelled her and her husband, Thomas*, to seek help in getting rid of their<br>
ghost. While moving into their new home, the couple and even some visiting in-laws kept noticing a strange body odor by the<br>
front door. Julia&#8217;s mother-in-law even commented that she saw a man standing by the door, watching with interest as they painted<br>
the new home. Since they didn&#8217;t perceive him to be a threat, nobody said or did anything concerning their ghostly roommate. <br>
<br>
Then things took a big turn.<br>
<br>
&#8220;About 2-3 weeks ago, my husband saw him in the master closet,&#8221;&nbsp;
Julia said. &#8220;He seemed to be wearing a brown suit from the '70s.<br>
Thomas came out of the closet with goosebumps all over his body, scared. He is 6'2" and 250 pounds, not scared of anything, but<br>
the ghost scared him. Neither one of us wanted to go back into the closet alone for a few days.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Not long after, Julia was visited by the ghost, too. This time, the ghost crossed a line. &#8220;This last Wednesday, I was relaxing<br>
in the bathtub, when I started feeling like I was not alone,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I began feeling what I thought was bubbles going up<br>
my back but then I got very scared because it was like fingers rubbing my back. I got out of the tub and was leaving the bath<br>
when the water stopped draining. I went to go move the stopper so water could drain. When I reached in the tub, the stopper was<br>
all (the) way in the drain! I have never had a bath/sink stopper that has been pulled turn over and reinsert back into the<br>
drain.&#8221; She added, &#8220;If he had not &#8216;touched&#8217; me while I was in the bath, he could have stayed, but that was crossing a boundary<br>
so that is why we are asking him to leave.&#8221;<br>
<br>
It&#8217;s personal boundaries getting crossed like this which Juliano points
out as an indicator a resident should seek advice or help<br>
in coping with their haunting experiences. &#8220;I would say that if their everyday life is being adversely affected, then they<br>
should go to speak with someone,&#8221; he said. <br>
<br>
&#8220;Contacting a paranormal investigative group in good standing is one way to try to confirm the haunting,&#8221; Cox agreed. &#8220;It often<br>
helps to speak with others who can understand what it is you are talking about, and may relieve some of your concerns.&#8221;<br>
<br>
The question remaining, though, is who exactly to talk to about this experience? Paranormal investigators are a good choice but<br>
some may believe that, because the trauma they experience can often result in problems such as depression and panic anxieties,<br>
a psychologist would be their best bet. Yet some may be under the impression that a parapsychologist, and not exactly a<br>
regularly certified psychologist, would be the better choice since what they are dealing with is, by nature, of the<br>
paranormal variety. Parapsychology is not a recognized field in the mental health world, yet it is a title popping up in<br>
magazine articles and on the streets. However, even as the </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">University</span></st1:PlaceType><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">
 of </span><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">California</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> at
</span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Berkeley</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">
offers a course on the<br>

subject, it is not something Juliano recommends. &#8220;What I and most ghost research groups do is not parapsychology,&#8221; he said.<br>

&#8220;All my views are opposed to the field of parapsychology. The two fields are often thought to be the same but they are quite<br>

different. I am dealing with spirits. Parapsychologists deal with events that are unexplainably being caused by the human<br>

mind. Anyone who is traumatized by a haunting should never talk to a parapsychologist unless they want to (be) part of their<br>

research. They do not offer help. They would be better off simply talking to others who have had similar experiences. In<br>

severe instances, they should not be afraid to talk to a therapist.&#8221; <br>
<br>

In addition to reaching out to talk to others about their experiences, the experts have other suggestions for coping with<br>

the trauma of living in a haunted house.<br>
<br>

&#8220;No matter what the level of stress, people need to remain upbeat and keep a positive outlook so that things do not spiral<br>

up to the level of extreme trauma,&#8221; Beaty said. &#8220;It may seem difficult, but it's the most important thing that they can do.&#8221;<br>
<br>

Why the stress on maintaining a positive outlook despite their frightening circumstances? Ghosts, especially negative entities,<br>

can feed on fear. They can pick up on energy from fear and anxiety and make it worse. &#8220;It is possible, which is why I tell<br>

people that even though it is easier said than done, it is utterly important that they maintain a positive and calm outlook<br>

on life,&#8221; Beaty said. &#8220;As I said, spirits use energy to manifest, be that electrical energy or nervous energy. If they<br>

find a small supply of nervous energy, they will find it difficult to stay and manifest.&#8221;<br>
<br>

Cox agreed. &#8220;It is quite possible for the entity to pick up on this and try to make it worse for you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Perhaps as in<br>

life, they may have been a prankster and get a kick out of scaring you. Or worse yet, you may come across a darker entity<br>

that gets its strength from your fears.&#8221;<br>
<br>

Beaty offered further advice on some positive things a resident can do to help cope with a haunting. &#8220;Meditation exercises can<br>

help, as well as the usual healthy habits -- for mind as well as body (get enough sleep, exercise, watch what you eat, for<br>

example). Another thing for residents to keep in mind is that if the occupying spirit is a more cranky one in a positive living<br>

environment, the spirit will move on to a more sympathetic environment. People tend to keep the personalities that they had<br>

while they were alive, and if someone was generally grumpy in life, he or she will not feel like they want to stay in a home<br>

where everyone was happy and positive. Like attracts like, is what we believe.&#8221;<br>
<br>

&#8220;Either way, in any type of haunting, it should be investigated, especially if it is interfering with the person's life and<br>

causing problems of any sort,&#8221; Cox suggested. &#8220;Don't wait to contact someone for their opinion if there is a viable problem.&#8221; <br>
<br>
She added, &#8220;Keep in mind, a spirit generally is quite harmless.&nbsp;
After all, they are only human also, just in a different form.<br>

Keep your wits about you. Remember, you are the living entity in your home. They are long gone.&#8221;<br>
<br>

After the experiences come and go, after residents have moved out and years pass by without any further problems, some, such<br>

as Johnson, may find it difficult to find closure with what they went through. Some haunting experiences can have long-term<br>

negative consequences such as insomnia and nightmares. This is when the issues and memories must be confronted so that the<br>

person may make peace with their past and move on. &#8220;They have to learn to accept what they have experienced,&#8221; Juliano said. &#8220;By<br>

not coping with the anxiety of the situation, they will (be) prolonging any post-traumatic stress they are experiencing.<br>

Talking to others who have had similar situations is a great way to work through any issues that the person may still have.&#8221;<br>
