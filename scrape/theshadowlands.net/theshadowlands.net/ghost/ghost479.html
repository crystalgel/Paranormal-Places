<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When I was a young
boy my
grandfather took me to visit his relatives somewhere deep into mexico,
as we
travaled thru winding roads and hillside cliffs we arrived in a small
village I
cant remember the name cuz it happened so long ago .<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>as we went into the village I noticed a young
pretty lady she was so beautiful but she was tied down to a huge rock<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>.the stange part is that she was floating on
air.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it scared the hell out of me. I
cant still forget that. I remember the men telling my grandfather that
the
girls father tied her down so she wouldn&#8217;t flie away. because she was
so pretty
all the other women of the villaged envied her and cast a spell on her
to fly
away Also as a child there was this old man who lived in Thelma tx he
told me
and my cousins about the French burring gold in our land and he showed
us the
spot where the treasure is buried we believed him because some of our
relatives
have found French coins in the past. and he<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>told us that we should never attempt to dig it out .so whats the
first
thing we do. one day my oldest cousin and his brothers and I decided to
dig for
the treasure I was the youngest and was more afraid than the others so
I stayed
under a tree a few yards away. As the boys are digging and getting
closer to
the gold I saw my oldest cousin mickey tossed around in the air,
yelling,
screaming for us to remove the black dog away from him, but we couldn&#8217;t
see any
dog still he kept on yelling and rolling on the ground .just then my
father
heard the yelling and he and the boys grabbed mickey from the legs and
pulled
him to safety. after every thing calmed down, my father took mickey to
the
hospital and we told the social worker and police what had happened.just<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>then the dr came out<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and said that mickey had dog bites<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>all
over him and he required 322 stitches
all over his body and he wanted to see the dog that bit him just in
case it
might have rabies we all told him there was no dog<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My First Story<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By:
malvses478@gmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is my first
story here.
I live in a small town in Southwest Virginia. The first story takes
place at a
business up a hill about 50 or so feet from where we live. One night my
brother
and I walked up to the business on the hill above our house. Our
destination
was a soda machine in front of a garage. While my brother was getting a
soda I
happened to look across Main Street and I noticed something in the
shadow of a
tree beside the insurance building. I swear people I'm not lying when I
say it
was HUGE. It looked like a shadow person yet it wasn't human. Please
don't
laugh when I say that it looked like a stereotypical werewolf. It
proceeded to
run on two legs to the nearest shadow of a house and disappeared. I
alerted my
brother then we quickly ran back home. According to my brother the
shadow
wolves seem to follow him...even chasing him at times. He can see them
in more
detail though. They are more solid to him. I remember one night I was
home
alone while he was out for a walk. All of a sudden he was beating on
the front
door begging me to unlock it. I let him in and he was gasping and
shaking. He
was scared out of his mind. You could see it in his eyes. When he
calmed down
he told me that he heard a loud splash in the creek beside him. He
turned to
see the shadow wolf lumbering after him up the bank. Another occasion
of seeing
something strange. It was a bright and sunny day outside. My brother's
girlfriend and I were exploring the basement of an abandoned house
which was up
the street from ours. The basement was pitch black, except for the
light
spilling in from the openings where the windows used to be. The
basement was
quite large too in fact. The girlfriend entered first, curiously
looking
around. I entered a couple seconds later, my attention drawn to the
windows
just as something huge and black jumped up through the opening without
making a
sound. Then there was nothing there but the woods which could be seen
through
the window. Before I could relax it returned. Peering in the window,
like it
was lying on the ground. I shudder to this very day when I think about
what I
saw. It kind of looked like a shadow person but WAY more solid than the
ones
I've seen before. It was human shaped I could see no nose or mouth or
ears.
What I could see was it's eyes. It had golden cat like eyes. It just
stared at
me for a few seconds before it took off. I did feel like it was a bit
annoyed
at being disturbed. The house we lived in was across the street from
the house
we saw that being in, Our house used to be a miner's bath house or
something. I
don't really remember the term the locals used. The house had lockers
and
showers in the basement. It was extremely dark and creepy. I would
never go to
the basement alone. I even heard that one of the other rooms used to be
a
barber shop for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house across
the street from that I really don't know much about. I do remember a
older dark
haired lady living there when we were little kids. There was a store
and an old
post office in the building next door many years ago. My brother's
boyfriend at
one time helped run the store back in the 80's.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I've got a story to
add to
your website.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've gone back and forth
about having someone come check it out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Just not sure I'm ready for it!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But here goes the story. My husband and I moved into a new house
built
on a minor Civil War battlefield. We know there was another house in
the
vacinity, there was also a tree that was called "the hanging tree"
not far from our backyard on which about three Union soldiers were
hung. Soon
after moving in we noticed odd shadows/white lights that seemed to move
across
rooms with no apparent source. We tried to account for them by cars
passing on
the road but never could pinpoint anything. One evening we were
watching TV
when a shape ran past a door to what eventually would be our deck. The
door was
a good 4 feet off the ground but the person running past, ran LEVEL
with the
door itself. My husband and I ran for the door, flung it open and my
husband
jumped down and ran in the same direction. At that time we were the
only house
on that end of the street and, being a very small town, it's very quiet
at
night and sounds carry for quite a distance. We didn't hear anyone
running nor
did we see anyone. We were spooked but figured it was a kid and our
eyes played
tricks on us. Not long after that my husband jumped off the couch and
ran for
the door again because he said someone was standing there looking in.
Again...level with the door and no deck. There was no one that we could
see
when we went outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some months later
I was up around midnight cleaning the kitchen. My husband had gone to
bed and
shut the bedroom door (the bedroom was at the top of the steps and the
door in
plain sight). I was watching TV across the great room when I saw out of
the
corner of my eye, a man leaning around the corner of the hallway wall
smiling
at me. As I turned my head, I was ready to yell at my husband for
sneaking up
on me when I realized the man's hair was long and blondish and my
husband's is
dark brown and short. I also realized the man was wearing a white shirt
with
full sleeves--nothing my husband owned. I couldn't see anything from
the waist
down. While I stood there staring, he simply vanished. I immediately
ran to the
hall and noticed that the bedroom door was still shut and if anyone had
gone
out the front door, I would have heard it. There was nothing...no sign
of
anyone. When my husband got up for work I told him what happened, he
said it
was my imagination. I didn't think so but we left it at that. However I
started
turning on the lights when he left the house for work since he left at
3am! A
few weeks later though my husband was in the front room at the
computer. To the
left is a table with an antique mirror hanging over it. My husband saw
movement
in the mirror and turned thinking it was one of our cats on the
table--instead
he saw a man's shoulder and arm wearing a white shirt walk past IN the
mirror.
My husband simply got up and waited outside till I got home. During
this time
my son, who knows no fear, would NEVER stay downstairs at night by
himself. He
said he was creeped out like someone was watching him from outside the
door! My
daughter, a typical teenager at the time who kept to her room, would
often come
downstairs to hug me and sit close to me. When I'd ask her if something
was
wrong she told me that sometimes she felt someone was sitting on her
bed and
that she saw things move out of the corner of her eye. The strange
thing is
that my husband and I NEVER told the kids what we saw until they were
18 and
19! There was a time when activity seemed to stop after my husband,
getting the
idea from my friends, stood in the center of the house and asked
whoever was
there to not show themselves to him. He was left alone after that.
However
recently we've been experiencing marital problems and my husband moved
into
another bedroom. I'm now hearing footsteps in my room and I'm
constantly woken
by what feels like someone sitting on my bed! I'll roll over but there
won't be
anyone there. One night was unusually bad and I had to get up earlier
than
normal the next day for a class. Around 10pm I said out loud that I
needed to
sleep and he wasn't letting me-if he wanted to bother someone, to
please go
harass my husband. Strangely enough, it got quiet and I fell asleep
only to be
woken at 11pm by my husband who was in the bathroom frantically loking
for something
to stop an area on his leg from hurting! He has psoriasis but this
particular
time he said it felt like someone was poking him with needles! The area
was
deep red and gave off heat. A very odd coincidence to say the least!
We've also
had things go missing--a tablecloth, a 15th century style costume and
various
little things that turn up in different areas. We have yet to track
down the
tablecloth or the costume! I did tell the Ghost to not hurt my husband!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I use to live in
Willston
North Dakota on 611 3rd Ave East. It was very frightful staying there I
remember there where laughing and voices but I could not understand
what they
where saying. I use to lock my doors every night but for some reason my
basement
door would always open and close. You could hear people walking up and
down the
stairs. I use to talk about it to others but they all thought I was
crazy.
After awhile I got use to it I figured there was nothing harming me
so.. I
guess it's not that scary but ever since then I believed in after life
and
ghosts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My Uncle and Aunt
now live in
a house near the Bank in Auburntown.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I was a little girl, my best friend Stephen and his family
lived
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They bought the house and were
told that the previous owner, an elderly lady, still haunted the house.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>They put little faith in the story and never
let it bother them.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I remember
playing
in Stephen's room and smelling an "old lady" smell.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Like medicine and Lilac perfume.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
never felt threatened by a presence at
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The smell would usually fade away
just as quickly as we smelled it. However, one night after the family
had gone
to bed, Stephen's mother was wakened by the sound of toys making noise
in
Stephen's room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stephen had one problem,
he was highly susceptible to nose bleeds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The slightest bump would set off a massive flow of blood.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Stephen's mother thought it strange that he
was awake and playing with so many noisy toys at once in the middle of
the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, the rocking chair in his
room where she
would often read him bedtime stories was rocking so hard that it was
banging
against the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She ran down the hall
to his room and when she opened the door, the toys went silent, the
rocking
chair slowed down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She looked at Stephen
in his bed and saw that his nose was bleeding very badly and it was
going down
his throat. He might have drowned in his own blood if the very sweet
lady's
ghost had not raised such a racket that night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I love your
website, and I&#8217;m
pretty much OBSESSED with the Paranormal. I watch the shows, Read the
Stories,
Take the pictures, Hear the voices<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and
search the sites. I know I may seem young, but I hope that you take my
stories
of REAL experiences into consideration, and maybe put them on your
site. So,
please hear me out, because I&#8217;ve had many experiences with the
Paranormal.
STORY # 1<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I was about 7 years
old when
my first contact happened. I lived in the basement of my Grandma&#8217;s
house with
my mom, and I was getting ready for bed much earlier than usual, when I
heard
someone call my name. It sounded like my mom, so I told her I&#8217;d be
right there.
But I kept hearing someone call me over and over. I got mad, and once I
was
done getting ready, I went upstairs to try and find her.I found my
grandma and
asked her where my mom was. She said she was out getting groceries. I
asked her
if she just left and she told me that she had been out for almost an
hour. So I
got confused and asked if she called me. (Me and her were the only ones
home
apparently) And she said no. So I got scared and explained what
happened. She
said I was just hearing things, but I know what I heard. It was too
clear of a
voice to imagine it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">STORY # 2I was
about 9 or 10
when this happened, and I lived in another house about 2 stories high,
with my
mom, my step-dad and my two little twin brothers. (They were 1 or 2
years old)
I was sick and home from school. It was the afternoon, and my grandma
was
babysitting while everyone was at work. I was in the bathroom, washing
my hands
when I heard something fall. I walked out of the bathroom and around
the house
to see what broke and what broke it. But I didn&#8217;t see anything broken.I
asked
my grandma if she heard anything break and she said no I don&#8217;t know If
I heard
it&#8230;But it was as clear as the voice I heard when I was 7.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">STORY # 3This
happened when I
was 12. Then I lived where I live now; an apartment here in Des
Plaines. (This
is where majority of the happenings took place) I was in my room,
reading a
book, when at the corner of my eye, I saw something by my door move. I
looked
and saw nothing. I shook it off and continued to read. Then I felt as
if I was
being watched, and again, I saw something at the corner of my eye.
Only, it
seemed to be a little white circle. But when I looked, I didn&#8217;t see
anything&#8230;But the feeling was still there.So I just read in the Living
room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">STORY # 4Happened
at the same
place, I was the same age (12). I was in my room, on my computer. It
was pretty
late, around 1 or 2 am, and I was reading something on the internet. I
then
heard a whisper RIGHT NEXT TO MY EAR that said &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with
you&#8221;So, I
turned around and got really scared. My TV was off and everything. I
turned
back to the computer, and eventually forgot about it, until I heard
something
similar in my other ear. It sounded something like, &#8220;Something&#8217;s wrong&#8221;
or
&#8220;Nothing&#8217;s wrong&#8221;. It was the same voice from before, but no one was
there. It
sounded like a man, maybe in his early thirties, or late twenties&#8230;just
making a
guess. After, I heard a &#8216;click&#8217; so I turned and saw my TV had been
turned on
just then.I wasn&#8217;t really sure what had happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">STORY # 5This time
I was 13.
Still living in this apartment. This was not too long ago, maybe a
couple
months. I was setting up my hall bathroom, getting ready to try the
Bloody Mary
Legend for the first time. I was on the phone with my friend, Irlanda,
and She
was going to stay on the phone with me through it all. But I told her I
would
call her after I do it.I did the usual preparations, and went through
with it.
I saw her, and became terrified and switched on the lights. Then I felt
pain.
So I hobbled to my room and blacked out onto my bed.The next day I woke
up with
a headache. I looked in the mirror and saw a huge cut on my head. (I
have
people who&#8217;ve seen this as well.)Creepy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">STORY # 6This
didn&#8217;t happen
to me, but it happened to my mother. Sometime ago, I was sleeping, and
my mom
said she heard me walk out of my room. She was laying on the floor,
trying to
sleep, and she thought I walked out to try and scare her. She spoke and
said
something like, &#8220;Hayley I know your there.&#8221; But &#8216;I&#8217; didn&#8217;t respond. So
she
turned to tell me, but no one was there. She SWORE she heard my door
open, and
my footsteps. But I was sound asleep in my room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">STORY # 7 This was
the
weirdest of them all&#8230;I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s the paranormal, but I don&#8217;t
know any
other explanation. I was about to go to sleep, when I was just overcome
with
this disturbed feeling&#8230;I&#8217;m not exactly sure how to describe it other
than it
was a non-stop feeling that I was going to go insane, or spontaneously
Combust.
I tried to go to sleep, But the feeling just got stronger, and my mind
was up
and running, while I was exhausted.I attempted to get my mind off of it
by TV,
But it didn&#8217;t work. I actually thought something bad was going to
happen to me.
I was scared and nervous. It ended the next morning, and hadn&#8217;t
happened since.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">STORY # 7<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>This isn&#8217;t really a story; because it has
happened a lot, and is still happening. At night, whenever I pass the
hall
bathroom in my house, and the lights off and the doors open, I get this
terrified feeling that something evil is in there. Sometimes it&#8217;s so
bad, that
I refuse to go down the hall (my room is directly across from the
bathroom)
until my mom goes and closes the door. Then, I gathered the courage to
take
pictures of the bathroom at night while the lights were off. I got some
good pictures,
but Im not exactly sure if what im seeing is what I think it is. I took
them
with a disposable camera&#8230;<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

FROM A BRANCH, WHEN I GOT CLOSE I WAS VIOLENTLY PUSHED TO THE GROUND
FACE
FIRST, LOUD SCREAMING WAS ALL AROUND ME FOR AN INSTANT, BY THE TIME I
GOT BACK
UP EVERYTHING WAS BACK TO NORMAL WITH THE THUNDERSTORM CLOSING IN. I
HAD
BRUISES ON MY SHOULDERS FOR AWHILE WHERE IT LOOKED LIKE SOMEONE PUSHED
ME. MANY
STRANGE AND FRIGHTENING OCCURANCES HAPPENED OUTSIDE AND MORE THAN
SEVERAL TIMES
DID I SEE THE WOMAN IN THE TREE AND ALWAYS IT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY
SCREAMING AND
VIOLENT ATTACKS OR HAPPENINGS. INSIDE WAS EVEN WORSE AT TIMES, THERE
WAS ALWAYS
A FEELING OF EVIL AND I WAS BEGINNING TO DISLIKE BEING ALONE, YOU HAVE
TO
UNDERSTAND THAT ONE, I AM A PRETTY BIG GUY AND DO NOT FRIGHTEN EASILY
AND TWO,
I INVESTED EVERYTHING INTO THIS HOUSE TO MAKE IT MY HOME. MANY TIME I
WOULD PUT
STUFF DOWN AND IT WOULD JUST DISSAPPEAR, KEYS, JEWERLY, CLOTHES, A
POCKET KNIVE
ONCE, JUST ALL SORTS OF ITEMS, I THOUGHT MAYBE KIDS WERE GETTING IN
DURING THE
DAY WHEN I WAS AT WORK AND TAKING STUFF.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>BURT MY DOG PRETTY MUCH HAD THE RUN OF THE PLACE AND SEVERAL
TIMES I CAM
HOME TO FIND HIM SHUT UP IN A CLOSET, HE WOULD GET ALL KINDS OF SCRAPES
AND CUTS
ON HIM AND ONCE I HAD TO TAKE HIME TO THE VET WITH A BROKEN LEG,AT
FIRST I JUST
THOUGHT HE WAS RUNNING AROUND THE HOUSE. AT NIGHT YOU COULD HEAR ALL
SORTS OF
NOISES, CABINET DOORS CLOSING, ROOM<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>DOORS BANGING, PEAPLE TALKING AND SCREAMING, NEVER WAS ANYONE
THERE,
NEAR THE END OF MY STAY YOU COULD NOT SLEEP THRU A NITE WITHOUTSOMETHING<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>HAPPENNING, FURNITURE WOULD MOVE AROUND,
DISHES WOULD BREAK, SEVERAL TIMES I WAS THROWN OUT OF BED, OTHER TIMES
A HEAVY
WEIGHT WOULD BE PRESSING ME DOWN, IT SEEMED LIKE THE OCCURANCES WERE
ESCALATING
NOT ONLY IN THE AMOUNT OF HAPPENINGS BUT ALSO IN THE STRENGTH AND
VIOLENCE OF
THEM. I STAYED AT THAT HOUSE FOR ALMOST 2 YEARS, DURING THAT TIME I
TRIED
SEVERAL THINGS TO HELP, I EVEN GOT OUR PRIEST TO COME OVER TO THE HOUSE,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I HIRED A PSYCHIC, PRAYED AND MORE, NOTHING
HELPED AND THINGS JUST GOT WORSE. IT SEEMED THE MORE I TRIED TO END THE
HAUNTING THE WORSE IT BECAME<span style="">&nbsp; </span>FINALLY IN
THE EARLY 90'S WE HAD A LARGE FIRE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT BURNED OVER A
HUNDRED
HOUSES DOWN TO THE GROUND, MINE BEING ONE OF THEM, THERE WAS NOTHING
LEFT BUT A
BEAT UP CONCRETE SLAB, A CONTRACTOR WAS HIRED BY THE CITY TO CLEAN UP
THE AREA
AND WHEN THEY WERE REMOVING THE TRASH ON MY LOT HUMAN REMAINS WERE
UNCOVERED
BURIED ABOUT A FOOT OR TWO UNDERGROUND, THEY WERE DETERMINED TO BE
FEMALE REMAINS
BURIED THERE ABOUT 15 YEARS GIVE OR TAKE, A BIG DEAL WAS MADE BY THE
POLICE AND
CITY AND FINALLY I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE VIOLENCE, MURDERS AND DRUG
TRAFFIC IN MY
AREA DURING THE PAST, I GUESS THE CITY WANTED TO KEEP SOME OF ITS
CHECKER PAST
BEHIND THEM AND PROMOTE A NICE CLEAN LIFE STYLE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE
GIRL BURIED TURN OUT TO BE IN HER EARLY
TWENTIES AND WAS PRESUMED TO HAVE BEEN BEATEN THEN HUNG TO DEATH, SHE
WAS
BURIED AND FORGOTTEN. I DO NOT KNOW IF HER KILLERS WERE EVER FOUND OR
BROUGHT
TO JUSTICE. HER LIFE ENDED VERY BADLY, DID SHE CARRY HER PAIN WITH HER
BEYOND.
WAS THE RAGE I FELT DIRECTED AT ME OR WAS IT FROM HER LIFSTYLE AND
DEATH.
OTHERS ALSO HAD THEIR LIVES BRUTALLY TAKEN FROM THEM THAT NITE YEARS
AGO, ARE
THEY CAUGHT BETWEEN WITH NO WAY OUT. DO THEY MAKE THEIR PRESENT FELT .
PAIN,
RAGE, FEAR, THESE ARE THE FEELINGS I REMEMBER MOST ABOUT MY TIME AT
CALIFORNIA
STREET AND DEL RIO. AT LEAST I WAS ABLE TO TAKE THE INSURANCE MONEY
FROM THE
FIRE AND START OVER AGAIN SOMEPLACE ELSE. EVEN THOUGH TIME FADES THE
MEMORIES A
LITTLE I STILL THINK ABOUT THE YOUNG GIRL WHOSE LIFE WAS ENDED, WHAT
COULD SHE
HAVE BECOME IF ONLY, HOW COULD SHE HAVE BECOME WHAT WAS THERE, IS SHE
AT PEACE
NOW. HOW COULD SO MUCH RAGE AND PAIN BE LEFT BEHIND. I HAVE TALKED TO
MANY
PEOPLE AND WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND IT<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I left some things
out on the
first one since at the time seemed insignificant but it is how i am my
mind
never can get everything kept in order. While on South Worth rd off of
Del Rio.
the sightings as I have been reminded happened around 2000. As I recall
since
it has been a while when I sat outside waiting to see if the world was
really
going to end. I had heard on the t.v of a news station talking of a
skunk ape
but considered it like the chupacabra and I am not sure with those if
they
exist... Some how I am more apt to beleive in paranormal the
cryptozoology. Any
way I kinda disregaurded it. A person who moved in next one of my
friends house
had 2 dogs who went missing a few months later. He soon later put a
electrified
fence up. If anyone is familiar with the little pond on... Juliet or
Jannet I
can't rememebr exactly which one is the very last street. But when you
get
there you take a Left and go to the tower there is or may not be a pond
there
unsure but there was on when we went there to fish. with in the time we
were
aware of the dogs being missing we went down ot the water to see maybe
if we
could find the dogs and as well go and swim. I should say I was the
only female
of the group and didn't feel like swimming in water that could
potentially have
a gator in it. I walked around and found hair and bones In the same
area there
used be a car that burned down but don't think that s signifacant since
The car
had been gone a while it might have been a coincidence of the bones and
hair
that could tell the Hair was the same color as one of the dogs and the
bones
were definatley not human. We decided though we would keep the findings
to our
self since we didn't feel to get the owner upset just in case if he
found the
dogs. Either it is just me that whatever wants to bother with me since
usually
when I am not with my friends something happens. I was sent to find my
friend
Joe by his mom he had put me into a lie that he was with me... I took a
back
route to the pond he wasn't there so I went back the same way it had
gotten
dark and as I rode my bike to a half way point where<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I could see the mans house we knew who had
race cars was I got a feeling that I wasn't alone and I decided to cut
through
to his yard and made a break for it when I looked behind me there was
something
black that went back into the woods. I went back there after Hurricane
Jeane
since i had a vehicle I decided to see the area again. They have now a
house
built where we think what ever it was stayed and it is also where we
would exit
from with our bikes since we would go in one way and come out. I
beleive though
the occurences only happened for that year although I have heard of
people
talking about California where a lot more happened if I can get my
friends
sister to talk about it more in detail I am going to try. All she told
me was
that strange things would occure some things were very different. The
one thing
I do rememeber on California Ave is that there were alot of buses being
hit
there and usually being flipped over. Everyone/anyone who has hit one
of these
busses say they didn't see the bus....... The erected stop signs speed
bumps
and lights and yet I rememebr one that happened before I left South
worth was
after those were erected. I have more paranormal or unexplained
happenings I
will try to post. Thanx for giving us a place to post.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Rhoe.Parker@Angliangroup.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>My
experience:I come from a long line of
psychics, and I must have been about seven when during an afternoon nap
I woke
up after a very frightening dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the time, we were living in Mount Butler in Hong Kong Island and Mom&#8217;s
family
live in Capiz in the Philippines. I ran out of my bedroom into a room
full of
family and family friends to tell my mom about it. I saw this Filipino
man in a
wooden box, dressed in a cream shirt and brown trousers, and lots of
our family
were around him crying. As a young child I had never seen a dead person
before
and was distraught by this experience. My family consoled me and told
me not to
worry, but it brought to their attention that I too had the gift. It
was only a
few years later that I was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>told that the
person I saw was my uncle who had been shot by the local militia in my
Mom&#8217;s
village in Philippines, and it surmises that the clothes I saw him in
were the
clothes he was buried in. So it turns out that I had a psychic snapshot
of the
actual Filipino funereal rights whereby the body is kept in the family
house
for a period of weeks so grieving people can pay their respects to him.
This
brother of my Mom&#8217;s, she had been having prophetic dreams around the
time,
warning him to leave the town because something bad was going to happen
to him.
He didn&#8217;t believe her and was shot by the local militia after a
dispute. It is
Filipino superstition that during this period that the body was stored
in the
family house that the spirit visits the family on the 3rd, 5th and 7th
days
after their death. This as it turns out was during this time that we
both had
these visitations. Mom was in the kitchen washing dishes when she heard
who she
thought was Daddy coming back from work, and she saw a man from the
corner of
her eye standing in the doorway wearing a light shirt and brown
trousers. So
she chatted to Daddy for about five minutes about his day, and what he
had been
up to, when it occurred to her that he didn&#8217;t answer her back once. She
turned
around to ask him a question, and then she realised there was no one in
the
doorway at all. It was at this point she was a little bit spooked as
she
remembered my description of Uncle Fred in his coffin and hurriedly
went to
check on Daddy. He had in fact come in when she heard him come in, but
had just
fallen asleep on the bed, fully clothed, and nit wearing brown trousers
and a
light shirt. So it was her brother&#8217;s way of saying goodbye, and I guess
to say
sorry for not having listened to her when she warned him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Bunk-bed fright A
few years
later, it was 1987 round about the time that Edward Youle, Hong Kong&#8217;s
governor
at the time passed away. We were still living in the same flat in Mount
Butler,
but my sister and I had moved from the room we were in as that had been
converted into Mom&#8217;s nursery where she looked after pre-school children
during
the day time. We were now in the room where I would have as my bedroom
until we
moved over to the New Territories. I must have been nine so my sister
would
have been about four. We shared a bunk-bed, and her being smaller
stayed on the
lower bunk. I awoke to pitch black, and the sound of flip flops walking
up and
down our corridor. I thought this was strange as it is custom to remove
your
shoes at the front door, and to wear slippers around the house. As I
heard
these flip flops get closer and closer to my door, sheer terror took
over. I
whispered down to my sister &#8220;Kris, can you hear that?&#8221; no one answered
back, so
I was trapped on the top bunk with no where to go with this noise
coming closer
and closer. I hid my head under my blanket, like kids do, wishing it to
go
away. I said this time, more insistently &#8220;Kris, can you hear that?&#8221; and
something hissed back at me &#8220;Yessssssssssssssssss&#8221;- that did not sound
like my
little sister at all. At this point I was terrified. I tried to gather
all of
my strength to get out of the bed but I was too scared. After what felt
like a
millennia, I eventually gathered enough courage, to jump off the top of
my bed,
ensuring by no means that I touched the lower bunk and charged into my
parent&#8217;s
room across the corridor from our room. I was so embarrassed being so
old and
being scared I didn&#8217;t actually get into their bed, but spent the rest
of the
night curled up in a ball at the foot of their bed. It turns out that
my sister
wasn&#8217;t in our room at all that night. My question was what was that in
the
corridor, and in the bunk bed with me?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The strange pink
light Around
this time of the strange occurrence with the flip flops, we were still
living
in flats in Mount Butler, my Daddy; a complete atheist had an
experience of his
own. Daddy does not believe in the supernatural, and if God actually
spoke to
him, he still wouldn&#8217;t believe it. He was lying in bed one night when
he woke
up for no reason to this pink sphere to appear on the wall opposite to
their
bed. It seemed to come out of the wall, and sit there and go back into
the wall
again. He was puzzled by this and went to investigate. He checked out
where the
possible light source could be coming from, the curtains, no, we were
on third
floor so it couldn&#8217;t have been vehicle lights, he went into the
bathroom, all
lights were off, and couldn&#8217;t have come from there either. He got back
into bed
and tried to wake Mom up to show her. She was having none of it, and
kept her
head under the sheets. Well the sphere appeared again, and came out of
the
wall, suspended somehow, then sunk back in and disappeared. He never
did figure
out what that was or where it came from.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Running Ghost When
he was
working in the Royal Hong Kong Police he had another experience. At
this point
he was a superintendent and managed a section of the traffic police.
They were
doing their rounds when a speed camera on the road flashed for no
reason. They
went to investigate, and it flashed again- with no cars in the near
vicinity.
They thought nothing more of it until the pictures were developed, and
on one
of the photo&#8217;s there is a distinct picture of a person, blurred
apparently
running very fast. So fast it set off a speed camera?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Ghost dog When
we were
still living in Mount Butler, I had one other experience that
reaffirmed my
belief in the supernatural, and two other people I was with experienced
it too.
I must have been about fourteen, when my sister and my best friend at
the time
decided to go for a walk in the countryside. So where we lived was
surrounded
by Hong Kong countryside which as perfect for me as I was a tomboy, and
spent
as much of my time as possible out and about exploring and climbing
trees. We
walked off out of our flat, up the hill and towards this quarry. After
passing
the quarry we came across this stream to our left. We saw this Great
Dane
coming towards us with blood shot eyes. It seemed oblivious to us, and
a cold
breeze shot past with it. I turned to my friend Martin and said, &#8220;Did
you feel
that coldness?&#8221;- And being kids, thought nothing more of it, and
carried on
exploring. Obviously with Hong Kong being so small large dogs are
unusual and
we happened to know the owners, so when we returned home we went to
Daddy and
said we saw Mr (I forget the name)&#8217;s Great Dane up the road without his
owner,
running. Daddy said &#8220;that&#8217;s odd, because the dog died of a heart attack
a few
weeks ago&#8221;. As it goes, it had been running up the road on a very hot
day with
its owner and decided to go for a dip in the stream, but the coldness
gave him
a heart attack and he died then and there. Why he chose to show himself
to us,
we will never know. However, being kids, we were all well and truly
spooked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Diana Experience
Just before
I started University in UK, I was visiting some friends in Cardiff. I
was
feeling very odd that night, and as we were heading out into town a
premonition
hit me. I turned around to my friend and said &#8220;Something very big is
going to
happen tonight&#8221;. He just looked at me like I was stark raving mad, so I
dropped
it. So we went out and had a lark and came back thinking nothing more
of it.
Imagine our surprise when we woke up in the morning and splashed all
over the
news was coverage on Diana&#8217;s death. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Uttoxeter Cemetery
experience
So I started uni in Derby in the Midlands, and where I was living was
Student
digs on Uttoxeter New Road. I was heavily into my Goth influence back
then, not
so much now, but I still love old cemeteries and dramatic clothing.
There was
this beautiful one on our road that I used to visit regularly and read
and draw
with many beautiful statues and old old grave stones. One day my ex
boyfriend
and I went to visit it as it was a lovely day turning to evening. <span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>So we wondered around looking at all the grave
stones, and the statues, trying to find the oldest tombstone we could.
It must
have been coming up to winter time as the sun set quickly, and we
realised in a
panic that the gate had been closed so we were locked in<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the Cemetery and had to find another way out.
So we walked along the perimeter looking for a likely tree to help us
over the
wall, when the sun just disappeared and we were pitched into almost
complete
darkness. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then for no reason at all,
the mist appeared over the headstones so it was hard to avoid the
graves
themselves. So it suddenly looked just like a horror movie set, trying
to avoid
broken tombstones, and holes in graves, and that damned mist in the
dark. By
this point I was pretty panicked, frantically trying to get out, with
this
feeling of overwhelming dread descending over me, and all cells in my
body
telling me to leave right now! We eventually scrambled over a wall into
the
student bar, and that feeling just lifted, just like that. It&#8217;s only a
few
months ago, that I was looking on line about ghosts in Derby that I
found out
that that very cemetery is very haunted. Brilliant, I have wanted to go
back
there for ages now.More to come, I promise, these are the only ones I
remember
for the moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My dreams<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought that was the end of my experiences,
but looking at the dreams section, I have remembered some more I want
to share
with you. I have always had very vivid dreams, some, not necessarily
all coming
true, but all seem to have symbolic importance in the coming days,
weeks, or
even sometimes years. I more often than not have d&eacute;j&agrave; vu
experiences even if I
haven&#8217;t ever a) done this before b) seen places or people before or c)
really
ever thought about these things when I am conscious. I haven&#8217;t really
wanted to
tell people about them as most people I worry that people will think I
am quite
mad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Prophetic dream/
Out of Body
experience: Puss in Boots and Australia This was round about the time
that I
came to understand that I had a gift of some form, if only you could
call it a
gift, it still does not make much sense to me. This happened around
1994. This
dream began at the entrance of a shopping area somewhere I had never
been to
before. I started going up an escalator when my cat appeared and we had
a
conversation, needless to say I wasn&#8217;t at all phased by the fact that
my cat
was a) walking upright b) that he was talking to me c) that he was
dressed in a
puss in boots costume, complete with pirate red boots and d) that he
was
actually out and about with me rather than in our house. He was riding
the
handhold and telling me to look around me and remember as much detail
as
possible. Obviously I took as much of it in and thanked him. Then I
woke up,
and that was that I thought. Until we went to Australia for the first
time
about six months later with my family. Sure enough we rocked up to this
shopping mall, I think it may have been in Brisbane, when sure enough,
I had
that de je vu feeling and I looked around at the layout, the
escalators, and
shops around me and knew I had been here before when I remembered my
dream. I
said to them &#8220;Hey I&#8217;ve been here before&#8221; and as would be expected, they
just
looked at me like I am mad. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Reoccurring
prophetic dreams:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have these
re-occurring dreams. I never
really understood the importance of them until about eight years ago.
These
dreams differ slightly, and I still cannot figure out what it all means
except
I have come to understand them as my unconscious giving me the heads-up
about
something rather major, and bad coming my way.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It always starts at school. These dreams are so vivid even
though I
haven&#8217;t been to those places for over 12 years ago at least. What is
weird is
it is always an amalgamation of all the different schools I have been
to, so I
recognise them but can&#8217;t differentiate at the time which place it is,
either of
the three of the four secondary schools I attended. There is always a
fear of
being caught out, and of being watched, but in my dreams I seem not to
care too
much about this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I said, it starts at
school, I am wandering around the various places, the corridors, rooms
I used
to frequent, the swimming pool, these are different each dream, but am
always
drawn to the girls changing rooms. Then I find myself in them and
looking for
something, be it money or goods to take of value, so to my horror I am
looking
in bags, and coats left there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In my
dream I am worried about being spotted by someone, but never get
caught. Then I
wake up, and know something is going to happen in the next few weeks. I
wish I
knew more about the subject. The amount of trouble I end up in the real
world
depends on the quantity and goods which I end up pilfering. When these
dreams
happen I know something is amiss and keep my eyes peeled. They have
never been
wrong before. If anyone could give me some insight, that would be fab.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t know yet again what the importance
was apart from to make me aware of my ability. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Prophetic dream:
Meeting
people before I meet them This has happened on many occasions to me, I
thought
before that maybe these people are supposed to be important to me in
some way,
but that is not necessarily the case. These do not come under the title
of
re-occurring dreams, but happen regularly enough to me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first time that happened, and I told this
guy I had never met before until he joined my class in the before
mentioned
secondary schools that I had seen him in a dream, of which I did, how
often do
you dream about a beautiful Canadian guy who you had never met before
and have
him appear for real? He did the quintessential, "sorry, I have no idea
who
you are you mad woman" look at me, and I never really figured out his
significance. The other noteworthy situation being, I dreamed about
this girl
in my dream, with red hair, and a black velvet cloak on, chanting
spells when I
was in the first year of university. Then I thought nothing more about
it until
I moved into another student digs in Uttoxeter new road, Derby, when lo
and
behold, guess who strolled in as a housemate, no one other than the
girl I saw
in my dream. When she was settled in and we got to know each other
better, I
told her about my dream about her, and she told me that she was a
Wiccan and
did indeed own a black velvet cloak, and practiced magic, and spells.
Weird but
brilliant. So we are still in contact, but yet again, the importance of
that
moment, I have very little idea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prophetic
dream: The haunted house So this also happened just before I finished
university in Derby I think. It was just before my ex boyfriend and I
broke up.
The importance of this dream is one that I have been able to break it
down and
understand it in its composite parts. So both of us were walking around
this
dark wood, and I was taking all that I had learned from watching horror
movies
into mind and was very careful of not wandering off on my own, made
sure I had
a weapon in hand in case anything happened. We eventually came to this
clearing, where this ominous house stood at the end of this garden.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>However, I needed the bathroom, and even
though we knew it was a haunted house, I was not one of those people
that would
go to the loo in a haunted forest. So we walked in, and there were
people
there, thankfully, none looking like psychopaths or zombies strangely
enough
they were people we knew too. There was a feeling of dread and sadness
throughout the house though and refused to go anywhere by myself. We
are
directed to the bathroom, which was at the end of this corridor, he
decided to
sit and chat to people whilst I did my business. So I started walking
but the
corridor was like the one from Poltergeist. It just kept getting
further and
further away, until I had to break into a run, desperately needing to
go, and
leave this house as soon as possible. I eventually made it, and threw
the door
open, and did what I needed to do. Then I woke up, and realised that I
still
needed to go. So I ran for the loo. Luckily I had the foresight to
write this
dream down once I had gotten back to bed, and knew, that we were
doomed. The
haunted house was a reflection of our relationship, being hounded by
our mutual
bad doings, and that the end was nigh, it was just a matter of time.
And so it
was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, before I finish another of
my epic story telling sessions, I have one more prophetic experience to
share
with you, but not one from my dreams. It is to do with my pet dog.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Sophie<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her name was Sophie; she was lovely, with her
white and black patch over her eye and black patch on her back. She was
only
like six months older than me, and had been with our family for her
sixteen
years. She was the loveliest sweetest dog in the world, apart from
having a penchant
for biting socks, eating tissues and rubber bands (she loved them I
don&#8217;t know
why, it may have been the texture) and attacking the Hoover. <span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>She was suffering from basically her insides
giving in, she had serious kidney problems and she couldn&#8217;t walk very
well
because of arthritis in her back legs, and because she couldn&#8217;t help
herself
any more she was kept outside. So one evening when our parents were
out, my
sister and I were playing with her in the garden, and I had this weird
feeling
come over me. I seem to be able to predict death unfortunately amongst
other
things. I turned to my sister, when I saw this shadow fall on our
Sophie that
looked like a cross, said &#8220;She&#8217;s going to die tomorrow&#8221;. She didn&#8217;t
believe me
being much younger than me, <span style="">&nbsp;</span>but sure
enough after a hard day at school, I was only fourteen or so at the
time, we
came back, and our parents were in pieces, and I knew it had happened.
They had
to take her down to the vet and have her put down as it was too cruel
to keep
her suffering like that. I have never seen my Daddy in pieces like
that, but
because I was strengthened by my fore-knowledge I supported him in his
time of
need. My poor Mi-Ming, who I mentioned in the Puss and boots story, was
distraught as she had basically brought him up from when we adopted him
as a
very small kitten.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On a happier note, I
had a dream after this terrible day, whereby I was watching my crazy
dog run
from the front of the house, in and up the stairs with much zest and
energy
like she would have had as a much younger dog, running up to our level
of the
house looking like she was having the time of her life, back and forth
giving
little yips of happiness grinning in her quintessentially silly Sophie
way. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As because of her health
problems, and her
incontinence she was not allowed in except for very cold weather. I
think this
was her way of saying she was free and happy at last, and I knew she
was in
peace. She does still come and visit us occasionally, when we walk by
the front
of the house, and you can, still after all these years, smell her and
we know
she is still looking out for us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I keep
meaning to write a dream diary, I will do that this year, as these
dreams seem
to be too important to miss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I grew up living in
a family
ranch,in south texas and i have expierenced a lot of scary things, I
guess I
just have what it takes to attract ghost .I have a couple of stories
for you
First here is the first one. as I was working mending fences one
morning. I was
approached by one of my cousins, his ranch is behind mine. he told me
that
while him and his son Myron were butchering a hog last night he saw two
of my
daughters watching him and his son and that I should not let my
daughters out
in the dark because of all the wild animals that are out there. I
looked at him
and I said david my girls were all asleep in their beds, and they no
better,
and they are always afraid to be out there. so it couldn&#8217;t have been my
girls<span style="">&nbsp; </span>so he and I went to get his son
Myron because he remembered Myron speaking to the little girls when he
asked Myron
about them. Myron said that the girls couldn&#8217;t speak English and that
they were
cold to the touch. when I told my mother<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the story she said that she remembers my great grand parents
telling her
about two little Indian girls that drowned in a huge pond that sits
behind my
house in the late 1800s.up to now evey once in a while we can hear the
girls
playing at night My grandfather told me this story as it happened to
him and
his brothers in 1924 Back then men used to hunt with lantern sand
iffles.the,lanterns were used it to light the way and to<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>blind the animals .when the light hit the
eyes of the animals it would blind the animals or birds causing them to
freezeor stop moving then they would kill it. these men were so good at
hunting
this way that they could tell you the difference between the eyes of
their
prays at night. any how on this night they came across some real
bloodshot eyes
they have never seen before. the dogs were going wild, so the men<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>all fired their riffles and they could here
the bullets hit their target. then soon after the five dogs were let
loose.
because there was no moon. the night was real dark so they could only
hear this
thing and the dogs fighting. after a while only one dog returned and
because it
was real dark they decided to wait till daybreak . then the next
morning as
they were searching for this thing and their dogs they found all the
dogs butchered
skinned and hanging from <span style="">&nbsp;</span>a tree with a
wire<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and the the thing with the red eyes
was no where to be found the men only found their own tracks and those
of the
dogs but no tracks of the thing they had shot at last night<o:p></o:p></span></p>
