<P>
<P><B>Hello, my name is Brandi and I am 15 years old.  My grandmother had
a</B>
<P><B>spirit in her house and his name was Ed. Every time we would show up
at</B>
<P><B>her house we would know he was there because we could feel his</B>
<P><B>presence.  My stepmother also knows about Ed.  She had a dream about
him</B>
<P><B>and this is how we got his name and what he wanted.  In her dream he
had</B>
<P><B>told her that he had died of a heart attack and that it had happened</B>
<P><B>long before the house was ever built.  The house had been built over
the</B>
<P><B>spot were he died.  Ed did not have a proper buriel, so he had come
to</B>
<P><B>us for help.  My grandparents had moved out a couple of months ago
and</B>
<P><B>today, June 21, 1999, we had gotten some Holy Water and went out to
the</B>
<P><B>house.  We had walked in to the basement and it was so dark we needed
a</B>
<P><B>flashlight to see our way. When we arrived to the area he had died,
we</B>
<P><B>read Palsm 23,  then sprinkled the Holy water over the area were he
was,</B>
<P><B>and at the same time read the Lords Prayer.  After we left that area,</B>
<P><B>the basement was filled with so much light and we no longer needed
to</B>
<P><B>use our flashlight.  We went upstairs after that to see what the
owners</B>
<P><B>had done to the house before they had tore it down.  We then heard
a</B>
<P><B>large bang, like a door being slammed shut, and we left the house as</B>
<P><B>fast as we could. We still do not know what the bang was, but we also
do</B>
<P><B>not want to know.  After our help for Ed he know rests in peace.</B>

<P><B>Yaya's Ways</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Erinangel1@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi.  I believe very much in the idea of ghosts and the things in which
they </B>
<P><B>represent.  I have a few stories of my own, but one in particular that
I'd </B>
<P><B>like to share.  When I was still in grade school, as well as junior
high </B>
<P><B>school,  I did my homework at the dining room table.  Like most kids,
I </B>
<P><B>watched TV as I studied, and I read with the overhead light off.  My
</B>
<P><B>grandmother, who we referred to as "Yaya,"  constantly told  me that
I'd </B>
<P><B>damage my eyes if I read with the light off.  She would  walk from
the </B>
<P><B>hallway, turn off the television, continuing my way towards the kitchen,
flip </B>
<P><B>on the overhead light and give me a "knowing look."  I would respond
under my </B>
<P><B>breath, "yeah, yeah, yeah...."  We followed this same routine almost
every </B>
<P><B>single day.</B>
<P>
<P><B>She passed away a couple of weeks before my fifteenth birthday, and
I was </B>
<P><B>devestated.  She was my whole world, and I felt unbelievable empty.
 She </B>
<P><B>appeared to me in dreams, where she would give my a huge bear hug,
as if to </B>
<P><B>tell me all was okay, and then they stopped when I started to regain
my faith </B>
<P><B>in things again.  Anyhow, a few years later, when I was in high school,
I got </B>
<P><B>out of track practice early and I headed home.  My parents were not
home yet, </B>
<P><B>and I was thrilled to have some time alone.  I turned on the TV, sat
at the </B>
<P><B>dining room table and  pulled my books from my backpack.  I started
on my </B>
<P><B>homework,  using only the daylight outside to guide me, while occasionally
</B>
<P><B>glancing at the television.  A few minutes later, the television turned
off.  </B>
<P><B>I looked up, startled.  A moment later the overhead light turned on.
 I sat </B>
<P><B>there completely overwhelmed for a second, and then relaxed.  I said
outloud  </B>
<P><B>"yeah, yeah, yeah...."  I have yet to read in darkness again, and know
that </B>
<P><B>she is watching out for me.  And my eyes.</B>

<P><B>**SLEEPING IN HORROR**</B>
<P>

<P><B>ago...... I love sleeping and especially in such a place like my room
(where</B>
<P><B>I feel comfortable). I was sleeping dead assleep because I was very
tired,........</B>
<P><B>well it was like around 2:00 am when I completely fell assleep.......</B>
<P><B> I was dead assleep when all of</B>
<P><B>a sudden I felt something come inside my room and I also felt a big
extremely</B>
<P><B>energetic presence that I have not felt ever before in my life....
I tryed</B>
<P><B>going back to sleep but I couln't and like one of does that when you
go</B>
<P><B>to sleep nothing or nobody will wake me up but this did without
knowing</B>
<P><B>why!!!...... well I felt it like if it was all around my room and
there</B>
<P><B>all the time such a strong feeling that I could feel myself in
presure......</B>
<P><B>I looked around but nothing at all. This has happen to me like 3
times</B>
<P><B>already but without knowing why and I really want to tell you that
if you</B>
<P><B>have some answer to email me.....please...</B>
<P><B>Three years ago I went back to</B>

there....</B>
<P><B>well the next day, which was a Friday</B>
<P><B>we had already decided to do a party between the famaly so we did.
Everything</B>
<P><B>was going out great until we all went to sleep. The house has 4
bedrooms</B>
<P><B>in the 2 floor and 3 in the 1 floor so we all decided to sleep
upstairs,</B>
<P><B>and we did. All the girls got the big room because we were around 15
girls</B>
<P><B>and the guys in the medium room because they were 9 of them. Well our
room</B>
<P><B>faced the back of the house to this house where a lady killed herself
dressed</B>
<P><B>in black ( hunged from a huge mango tree)..... anyways it was 3 in
the</B>
<P><B>morning when this accured to us the girls, we were fooling around
saying</B>
<P><B>jokes and bothering us, when all of a sudden my cousin Suany decided
to</B>
<P><B>look out the window so she did while she was looking out the window
we</B>
<P><B>all noticed that she stayed there without talking or not moving (pale
white),</B>
<P><B>then we all went to see what was going on and then that's when it
happened........</B>
<P><B>we saw the lady that killed herself there infront of us outside the
window...</B>
<P><B>we were really scared because we were in the 2 floor and we didn't
have</B>
<P><B>any balconies but she was there laughing and looking straight inside
our</B>
<P><B>room. I started screaming when then we all started screaming and left
to</B>
<P><B>the guys room. I hope am not the only that this has happened to. </B>

<P><B>Ghosts At Camp</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: dkorpela@vianet.on.ca</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi,</B>
<P><B>My name is Sarah.I've never really seen a ghost.But, I have felt the</B>
<P><B>presence and my Mom and Dad have seen them. In about 1990, when I was
4 or</B>
<P><B>5 years old, I was extremely curious and while at camp I'd ask my dad
to</B>
<P><B>tell me a story about anything.(Back then I really liked Moose
stories)So,</B>
<P><B>my dad would tell me about when he was hunting moose and then do his
famous</B>
<P><B>moose call. But, there is one story I remember distinctivily.It goes
like</B>
<P><B>this... My dad was hunting for moose.Before I was born so it was
probably</B>
<P><B>in about 1980 (I was born in 86).He did his moose call and, out of
the</B>
<P><B>bushes came a giant moose, bigger than any moose he had ever seen in
his</B>
<P><B>whole life.It was also covered with white stuff.My dad was puzzled,
because</B>
<P><B>it wasn't snowing.He figured it was white fur.So he shot at it. Hitting
it</B>
<P><B>in the heart.The moose staggered away and my dad followed it's tracks</B>
<P><B>through a muddy area.Surprisinly there was no blood. The tracks
stopped.And</B>
<P><B>the body was nowhere around.Another storie surronding my camp is "No</B>
<P><B>Footsteps" In the 50's or 60's my dad was walking to my camp.It was
snow</B>
<P><B>storming. He was all alone on the road going to my camp. When he
looked</B>
<P><B>back he saw a man walking behind him.Thinking nothing of it he looked</B>
<P><B>ahead, then 2 seconds later he looked back, and the man was gone.The
next</B>
<P><B>morning my dad went back along the road. He found his tracks, but
there</B>
<P><B>were no other tracks around for kilometers.Another story that happend</B>
<P><B>inside the actual building of my camp is...</B>
<P><B>"Flipping Pies" My mom and my dad's friend were watching a baseball
game</B>
<P><B>and my mother's freshly baked apple pies flipped right off the counter
onto</B>
<P><B>the floor!We have no explanation for the moose, but for the others
here is</B>
<P><B>what we think...</B>
<P><B>My father said before all these things happend, a Finnish man was
drinking</B>
<P><B>and fell into the lake and drown because he was caught underneath the</B>
<P><B>dock.Now for my part of the story.</B>
<P><B>Everytime I go to camp, I get the feeling I'm being watched.I hear</B>
<P><B>things.And I usually can't sleep.One thing that I heard was a bell
ringing</B>
<P><B>at night.The thing is when I was really young like 3 or 4, I had a
pet</B>
<P><B>lamb, names Ringing Bell.He wore a bell around his neck.It sounded
exactly</B>
<P><B>like his bell.He is actually burried at my camp.My camp is a pretty
freaky</B>
<P><B>place. It's got ghost moose to the sounds of people walking around.</B>
<P>
<P><B>"Alex"</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: drudene@mr.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>My story is not very complicated.  My husband, son (now eight), and
I</B>
<P><B>moved into our current house a little more than two years ago.  Once</B>
<P><B>when my husband and son were spending a weekend at my brother-in-laws,
I</B>
<P><B>told my husband I was afraid of being alone in the house (even though
I</B>
<P><B>am reclusive by nature).  He said to ask my guardian spirits for help.
</B>
<P><B>So, not really expecting anything, I said aloud before I went to bed</B>
<P><B>that I would appreciate my guardian spirits for a sign they were</B>
<P><B>present.  Later that night I was awakened by the sound of the
doorknob</B>
<P><B>on the bedroom door being turned.  I looked over and actually saw it</B>
<P><B>turning.  I was terrified.  Nothing came in, and there was no way I
was</B>
<P><B>going looking for the doorknob-turner.  At best it was an intruder.
</B>
<P><B>When my husband came home, I told him about it and he told me I had</B>
<P><B>asked for a sign, after all.</B>
<P><B>About a year after we moved in, our (then 2 year old) nephew came to</B>
<P><B>live with us.  He was very delayed and could only speak at about a
one</B>
<P><B>year old age level.  We made a playroom for the kids in the basement.
</B>
<P><B>Josh, our nephew refused to play down there alone.  I didn't blame
him. </B>
<P><B>We had to totally run out of clean clothes before I'd go down there
to</B>
<P><B>do laundry.  It was creepy, not dark at all, but always there was a</B>
<P><B>feeling of being watched or someone standing close behind you.  We
also</B>
<P><B>heard footsteps down there, and water being turned on.  That fall
Josh</B>
<P><B>threw one of his little boots down the stairs and my husband ordered
him</B>
<P><B>into the basement to pick it up.  Josh reached the bottom of the
stairs,</B>
<P><B>turned to look into the basement, screamed "Ghost!" in mortal terror
and</B>
<P><B>ran back up the stairs and shot into my husband's arms.  By this
time,</B>
<P><B>we had named the presence "Alex".  Josh said Alex had made a very bad</B>
<P><B>face at him.  He refused to go down in the basement at all after that.
</B>
<P><B>We also had an incident were our broom was totally missing from our</B>
<P><B>house for almost two weeks.  (Imagine our floor!)  I searched every
inch</B>
<P><B>of the house, including the basement.  It wasn't in our house.  We</B>
<P><B>thought someone had borrowed it.  No one had.  Finally, I yelled down</B>
<P><B>into the basement, "Alex, if you have the broom we need it back!"
 After</B>
<P><B>a couple minutes and another good search of the upstairs, I went down
to</B>
<P><B>the basement and found the broom leaning against the wall right by
the</B>
<P><B>stairs.</B>
<P><B>I thought I was doing pretty well with the whole having a ghost</B>
<P><B>experience.  Sure, I was secretly scared to death, but I kept
reminding</B>
<P><B>myself that there are spirits all around us and Alex seemed to be
rather</B>
<P><B>mild and harmless.  He even listened to my husband when Mike ordered
him</B>
<P><B>to stop scaring the kids and later to stop coming upstairs.  And
surely,</B>
<P><B>Alex had as much right to be there as I have.  However, I changed my</B>
<P><B>mind after taking a nap in the extra room downstairs.  I was awakened</B>
<P><B>with a jolt by the distinct feeling of a hand slapping me in the face.
</B>
<P><B>That was it for me.  While we were in the car, away from the house,
I</B>
<P><B>told my husband Alex had to go, and since he seemed to have some</B>
<P><B>authority, he had to tell Alex to leave.  Mike said he'd probabley
have</B>
<P><B>to talk to a medicine man.  Luckily, however, perhaps after
overhearing</B>
<P><B>a similar conversation at the house, Alex left on his own.  No more</B>
<P><B>noises from the basement, missing household objects, or eerie feelings.
</B>
<P><B>In fact, after a while, my husband and I even moved our bedroom</B>
<P><B>downstairs, and we never had another weird experience down there.
 Josh</B>
<P><B>was once more willing to come downstairs, although he does still talk</B>
<P><B>about Alex occasionally.  We did have to move back upstairs, but that</B>
<P><B>involved only a mundane little mouse running around down there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Texas Haunted House</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Gat0rIaw@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had a friend in Arlington Texas, whose house had a ghost. Her family
called </B>
<P><B>it George and laughed about it. There was no malevolence involved.
Their </B>
<P><B>house was relatively new and not particularly outstanding. It was a
classic </B>
<P><B>50's ranch house. Anyway, my friend's room was always chilly, the </B>
<P><B>temperature was about 65 degrees. Her family had duct people check
out the </B>
<P><B>ducts to her room on several occassions. Despite the blazing North
Texas </B>
<P><B>summers or the central heat turned on in the winter, her room maintained
this </B>
<P><B>temperature. I had heard all the stories and didn't really know what
to </B>
<P><B>think. I spent the night and that made a believer out of me. First,
during </B>
<P><B>dinner, things fell off of shelves in the adjacent den. Her parents
laughed </B>
<P><B>and yelled out "stop it George". Later when I went into the kitchen
for some </B>
<P><B>waterthe reflected view in the kitchen window started spinning. I was
</B>
<P><B>somewhat entranced and then realized at the center of the spiraling
image was </B>
<P><B>the figure of a man. The figure was getting closer and larger. I ran
into the </B>
<P><B>den before I saw any more. As we went to sleep in the sleeper couch
in the </B>
<P><B>den, several books in shelves opposite the couch, slowly pulled out
from </B>
<P><B>their position on the shelf and almost fell to the floor. "George"
is one of </B>
<P><B>my fondest memories. My friend and I had other strange encounters after
that, </B>
<P><B>including many that didn't involve George. I think that certain people
are </B>
<P><B>more receptive to energies and have more of these events than other
people.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Ghostly Encounters</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: silverkisses@home.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>	I have decided to post my other stories now, before I forget to post</B>
<P><B>them later.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	The first one I would like to share happened when I was eighteen.
 My</B>
<P><B>friend was living with me and my family in our house in north east</B>
<P><B>Calgary.  We were sitting in her room playing cards.  There had been
a</B>
<P><B>couple strange things happening the last few weeks like my TV turning
on</B>
<P><B>and off by itself, the volume going up and down on my stereo. Since
both</B>
<P><B>of us had always been believers, she has had experiences of her own,
we</B>
<P><B>knew it was the work of a ghost.  We were never really frightened,
at</B>
<P><B>least not until the night I am about to tell you about.  Anyway, like
I</B>
<P><B>said we were playing a game with the deck of cards.  You asked a</B>
<P><B>question and then flipped a card; if it was a black card the answer
was</B>
<P><B>no, a red card was a yes...it was called something like Ouija cards
or</B>
<P><B>something.  At first it was just a game, we were laughing and joking</B>
<P><B>around at the answers it gave us, until we started noticing a pattern.
</B>
<P><B>Every time we got to the bottom of the deck and shuffled them for the</B>
<P><B>next 'round' the first three cards flipped were six six six.  The
first</B>
<P><B>couple of times we just brushed it off as being coincedental, but by
the</B>
<P><B>third fourth and fifth times we were scared.  We decided it was time
to</B>
<P><B>call it a night and picked up the cards.  We made sure to check</B>
<P><B>underneath ourselves and under the pillows on her bed to make sure
we</B>
<P><B>didn't miss any cards.  We hadn't.  I know we hadn't.  But after
gabbing</B>
<P><B>for a half an hour, I was going to go downstairs to my room, sure
enough</B>
<P><B>there was a card sitting right in plain view of both of us. We looked
at</B>
<P><B>each other a little funny and she picked up the card...it was the six
of</B>
<P><B>spades.  I got curious as we went to put the six card back with the</B>
<P><B>others and flipped the top two cards of the deck, both of them were</B>
<P><B>sixes.  We put the cards in the kitchen and on my way downstairs I
heard</B>
<P><B>the TV go on, I turned to go back upstairs to tell my friend when it</B>
<P><B>turned off again.  I went to my room and laid down.  A couple minutes</B>
<P><B>later I noticed the room had gotten brighter.  I opened my eyes and
saw</B>
<P><B>that six of my candles were glowing brightly even though no one had
been</B>
<P><B>in the room to light them.  I blew them out and tried to go to sleep.
</B>
<P><B>It happened again, but this time they lit one by one.  I ran from my</B>
<P><B>room, noticing it grow dark once again, and slept the rest of the
night</B>
<P><B>with my friend.  I've never had an occurance like that again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	My most recent experience happened in January 1999.  One of our dogs
CB</B>
<P><B>(Cat Bait) had recently been put down.  He had been a part of the
family</B>
<P><B>for fifteen years.  One night our other dog, Tia, came downstairs to
my</B>
<P><B>room. This was extremely odd, since the only time she ever came down
was</B>
<P><B>if I had food or if she was with my mom, but she never came down in
the</B>
<P><B>dead of night.  I was fast asleep when I was woken by the sound of
her</B>
<P><B>barking at the end of my bed.  I told her to go away and to shut up
but</B>
<P><B>she persisted.  I sat up and found her jumping at the end of the bed.
 I</B>
<P><B>asked her if she wanted outside, that's not what she wanted.  She
wanted</B>
<P><B>me to get out of bed.  Irritated I did just that.  We walked out of
my</B>
<P><B>room and she started barking at a corner of the basement.  I thought</B>
<P><B>maybe she had found a mouse or something that she wanted to show me,
but</B>
<P><B>upon turning on all the lights and investigating I found nothing. 
She</B>
<P><B>started walking around the basement, if I did not follow her she
would</B>
<P><B>bark.  I was getting tired of this game and just wanted to go back
to</B>
<P><B>bed, but she just kept barking until I followed her.  Finally she led
me</B>
<P><B>into the laundry room and went over to the pile of blankets laying
on</B>
<P><B>the floor and started barking and switched between looking at me and</B>
<P><B>staring at the blankets. It then occured to me that the pile of
blankets</B>
<P><B>were one of CB's favorite spots to sleep and I remembered hearing</B>
<P><B>somewhere that animals, especially cats and dogs had a sensitivity
to</B>
<P><B>spirits and ghosts.  I smiled and asked Tia 'Is that CB?' 
Immediately</B>
<P><B>her tail started wagging and she went over to the blankets, laid
down,</B>
<P><B>gave them one lick and then went back upstairs.  I know it was my
little</B>
<P><B>dog who was visiting that night, I'm just glad that Tia decided to
share</B>
<P><B>that visit with me. Since then Tia has shared it with me a couple of</B>
<P><B>times, although I still haven't seen CB's ghost for myself.  The cat
has</B>
<P><B>also examined various places that were CB's favorites with the same</B>
<P><B>undeniable interest.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>	Thanks again for listening to my encounters of the paranormal.  I
hope</B>
<P><B>to have more to share with you someday, I also hope I never have to</B>
<P><B>relay an occurrance that is not so friendly.  </B>

<P><B>Nighttime Apparition</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: rgutier@emory.edu</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>This story has several parts - it has taken me months to put this</B>
<P><B>together in a way that makes sense and takes all known facts into</B>
<P><B>account...</B>
<P>
<P><B>I awakened suddenly from deep, dreaming sleep one night in December
or</B>
<P><B>January with the terror that someone was in my room. I have heard
that</B>
<P><B>in most people there is a reflex that literally prevents them from</B>
<P><B>moving when they are in a deep state of sleep (and the "frozen,
unable</B>
<P><B>to move" state described by many upon first being awakened is simply</B>
<P><B>that reflex still working, not fully in synch with sudden</B>
<P><B>consciousness). I am in a different category, however, - I am a</B>
<P><B>sleepwalker and capable of vigorous movement even when not awake. To
get</B>
<P><B>on with the story...I felt an "intrusion" in my dream, that had
nothing</B>
<P><B>to do with what I was dreaming about. It shocked me awake and I sat</B>
<P><B>straight up in my bed. I was treated to the sight of an apparition</B>
<P><B>standing near the foot of my bed. It was quite tall, over 6 feet I
would</B>
<P><B>guess. I couldn't tell if it was male or female, but my sense was
that</B>
<P><B>it was female. It had short dark hair, parted in the middle and
brushed</B>
<P><B>back on either side and wore flowing white garments. It emitted no</B>
<P><B>light; what I could see of it was illuminated by the yard lights
shining</B>
<P><B>in the bedroom window. I apparently surprised it because for a
fraction</B>
<P><B>of a second its right hand was raised to its temple in a gesture that</B>
<P><B>seemed to indicate I was not supposed to have awakened or have seen
it.</B>
<P><B>Immediately it was gone, leaving me to wonder if I had really just
been</B>
<P><B>dreaming. It all happened so quickly.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In January I visited a psychic who told me that in addition to the</B>
<P><B>spirit of my grandmother (which I knew about), I had the spirit of
a</B>
<P><B>young girl strongly attached to me. She was not able to give me any</B>
<P><B>details as to who the girl might be and I thought about this a great</B>
<P><B>deal. For months I pondered whom this might be, and got no</B>
<P><B>enlightenment. Finally, one day the face of a child I had used to</B>
<P><B>babysit for many years ago sort of popped into my head and I knew who
my</B>
<P><B>little girl attachment was. She was a tragic little figure who was
a</B>
<P><B>foster child in a home that cared for her but most certainly did not</B>
<P><B>love her. Even as a teenager my heart ached for that child, and I
told</B>
<P><B>my mother once that the lifeline on her left palm was extremely short.
I</B>
<P><B>always felt she would die young. I really don't know any facts about
her</B>
<P><B>since I lost touch with the foster family after I went to college,
but I</B>
<P><B>had no doubt that she was my attachment. </B>
<P>
<P><B>A few days after this I went to another psychic who told me that the</B>
<P><B>girl had not been ready to die when it happened - it had surprised
her.</B>
<P><B>For that reason she had been unable to find the light that souls are</B>
<P><B>supposed to go to when they pass. He told me that I was the only
light</B>
<P><B>she could find and therefore she had attached to me, but that it
wasn't</B>
<P><B>a good thing. She meant me no harm but she was draining some of my</B>
<P><B>energy and she needed to move on for her own sake as well. He "spoke"</B>
<P><B>with her briefly and told me she was 17 and that her stepfather had</B>
<P><B>caused her death, or at least a great deal of pain while she was
alive,</B>
<P><B>which does correlate with what I knew of the man (remember, she was
in</B>
<P><B>foster care, not living with her mother and stepfather when I knew
her,</B>
<P><B>but the man was a convicted child molester). The psychic told me he</B>
<P><B>would help her go to the light, and I presume he was successful. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Tonight I was reading some of the articles on this site, about why</B>
<P><B>spirits tend to manifest at night (to get a glimpse of someone they</B>
<P><B>loved, perhaps, or to try to communicate) and what the best reaction
to</B>
<P><B>an apparition is and I realized that 1) probably my apparition was
my</B>
<P><B>young friend, who I wouldn't have recognized because I hadn't seen
her</B>
<P><B>for about 7 years before she passed, and 2) sitting straight up in
bed</B>
<P><B>was a good way to scare it off, because it disappeared in the blink
of</B>
<P><B>an eye. If I had realized who it was, I would have tried to make
things</B>
<P><B>easier for her...But for both of our sakes, I hope there is no next</B>
<P><B>time.</B>

<P><B> Haunting of Whittington Farm House</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>By: PLUMBROKE000@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>In 1975, my wifes parents and her sister, Mary, moved to the Eastern</B>
<P><B>Shore of Maryland into a 100 year old farmhouse.  What made them
believe</B>
<P><B>there was  a ghost was little things disappearing and reappearing in</B>
<P><B>different places.  Doors locking by themselves, being touched by
someone</B>
<P><B>who wasnt there.  Things really didn't start getting wierd untill her</B>
<P><B>other sister, Char, and her son, David, moved in with them.  Char had
a</B>
<P><B>little bit of ESP.  She could tell when things were going to happen.</B>
<P><B>She would have dreams and funny feelings that would mostly come true.</B>
<P><B>They would hear noises in the attic, foot steps, and things rolling</B>
<P><B>around.   Char would hear someone calling her name at night.  She had</B>
<P><B>the bedroom with the attic door in it.  Once my wife felt some one
sit</B>
<P><B>on her bed,  Char felt some one run their fingers through her hair.</B>
<P><B>Once they were all outside taking photos of each other, no one was
in</B>
<P><B>the house, but when the photos were developed some one was looking
out</B>
<P><B>the pantry window.  They believe the ghost was not harmful in fact
it</B>
<P><B>was very helpful.  Things that they were looking for would appear.
 When</B>
<P><B>David was a baby he had stuffed animals in his crib, years later he
told</B>
<P><B>us that he was afraid of these stuffed animals because he thought
that</B>
<P><B>they were alive.  Another thing that happened was when both my wife
and</B>
<P><B>her sister Mary got married, both of their wedding photos that were</B>
<P><B>taken in the house never turned out.  They believe the ghost was sad
to</B>
<P><B>see them leave.   In the big foyer there was a room that had been</B>
<P><B>painted black from other occupiants and when ever they would pass the</B>
<P><B>room that was by a staircase they felt as if some one was watching
them</B>
<P><B>go up the stairs all three sisters felt this presence. </B>

<P><B>Saying Farewell</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Wavrunsun@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I've always been fascinated and drawn to anything dealing with the
spirtual </B>
<P><B>world or the supernatural. I don't really know if I have more of a
connection </B>
<P><B>with this than others or not, or maybe I'm just extremely sensitive
to people </B>
<P><B>or the feelings they try to conceal. In any case this particular story
is </B>
<P><B>about my grandmother. We were very close, including my mother, sister
and </B>
<P><B>myself. My "Gram" lived by herself, but all of would take turns doing
errands </B>
<P><B>and driving her where she needed to go. At this time I was driving
a used, </B>
<P><B>red-orange BMW and was very proud of it. </B>
<P>
<P><B>My Gram was suffering from CHF and was always going to the hospital
for </B>
<P><B>treatment. She was only in the hospistal a short time before she died
and I </B>
<P><B>did not get to say goodbye. Incidentally, just before she died, she
sat up </B>
<P><B>and spoke to her mother, whom she had not seem since she was five years
old. </B>
<P><B>This is what my mother told me, and believe me she would not lie. Moving
on, </B>
<P><B>that night I felt inconsolable that I had not made it to see her. I
dreamt I </B>
<P><B>was standing in an area that was mostly comprised of gray, white mist
, with </B>
<P><B>no structural shape to it. My BMW was to my right and my Gram was standing
by </B>
<P><B>the other door on the other side! We just stared at each other and
though we </B>
<P><B>didn't speak, we seemed to be saying our goodbyes. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I still speak to her often in my car,now a different one, feel she
is still </B>
<P><B>close by. Of course people driving next to me only see me talking to
myself! </B>
<P><B>Any body out there have anything similar happen to then?</B>

<P><B>One English True Story: Never before written down</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: paulgreen@home.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I am now a 48 year old professional, settled in Canada and doing very
well.</B>
<P><B>In Northern England, as a youth, I had many experiences, mainly
revolving</B>
<P><B>around the house which my family bought when I was 12 years old.  We
were</B>
<P><B>told by the neighbours that three families had moved out in the 18
months</B>
<P><B>before we moved in but the only explanation was that they had
"marriage</B>
<P><B>problems".  Within a year, we heard noises, such as a person banging
on the</B>
<P><B>door or definite and very clear footsteps, which would walk up the
stairs,</B>
<P><B>if you were upstairs, or down the stairs, if you were down.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When it first happened, I I thought it was my brother, one year younger
than</B>
<P><B>myself, banging on the door disturbing my Math homework.  But when
I went</B>
<P><B>down to complain, my parents insisted that he had not been out of the
front</B>
<P><B>room for an hour.  The next thing was that I was awakened in the middle
of</B>
<P><B>the night by a tremendous racket from the bathroom and I got up and
put my</B>
<P><B>trousers on to see what it was.  As I left my room, my mother stood
at her</B>
<P><B>door and we each asked the other if we had heard the sound.  We agreed
that</B>
<P><B>it came from the bathroom and went to look.  All that was there was
an empty</B>
<P><B>washing up liquid bottle, made of plastic, squashed and lying on the
floor.</B>
<P><B>Another night, my mother and I heard a crash, as if metal ladders had
fallen</B>
<P><B>outside the downstairs living room but, again, there was no source
for the</B>
<P><B>sound when we checked.  Over the years, from age 12 to 18, I became
familiar</B>
<P><B>with these sounds and joked with school-friends that we had a ghost
called</B>
<P><B>"Jack".  Some friends were in the house when the footsteps came down
the</B>
<P><B>stairs.  I heard them but I said nothing.  No-one else did.  When it</B>
<P><B>happened a second time, I heard it and so did a young man called Mick,
who</B>
<P><B>had never heard of this story.  He searched everywhere and would not
accept</B>
<P><B>my reassurance that no-one was there.  When I left to go to university,
I</B>
<P><B>told the next door neighbour, a middle aged woman, that I was glad
to leave.</B>
<P><B>She told me that these sounds were the reason why the three families
had</B>
<P><B>left in such haste.  The neighbours agreed not to tell us because they
did</B>
<P><B>not want to put ideas into our minds.  The woman who lived there
previously</B>
<P><B>was found dead in the bath with her wrists slit.  It was thought to
be</B>
<P><B>suicide.  But I had a vague and recurring mental image of a man coming
down</B>
<P><B>the curved stairway.  A friend later suggested that, perhaps, this
man was</B>
<P><B>the old woman's son.  Perhaps he killed her and made it look like
suicide.</B>
<P><B>Who knows?  One piece of advice.  Never try a Ouiji board to
communicate</B>
<P><B>with the dead.  Leave well enough alone.  If experiences happen to
you</B>
<P><B>naturally, they are completely harmless, and in some cases can be
helpful.</B>
<P><B>They might happen for a total of a few seconds in your whole life.
 But do</B>
<P><B>not try to make them happen because you might frighten yourself.  This
is my</B>
<P><B>best advice.  There are other stories, all true, but they will have
to wait.</B>

<P><B>English Ghosts</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: rachel@meghora.freeserve.co.uk</B>
<P>
<P><B> When my mum was really little, she lived in this old house. </B>
<P><B>It was a good 500 years old, and was next to an old graveyard. Some
times the TV </B>
<P><B>would change channel by its self, or the curtains would open and close.
Things </B>
<P><B>would move from where they had been put a few minutes ago. The ghost
also got </B>
<P><B>rid of unwelcome guests. Once the Tax men came round, and the curtain
started </B>
<P><B>opening and closing. On asking who it was, they were told"ITs only
George!" </B>
<P><B>[George being the ghost's nickname], and beat a hasty retreat. I have
visited </B>
<P><B>the house, and fewer things happen now, as the current owner asked
the spirit to </B>
<P><B>leave her alone. But there is definately someone there.  Once a paranormal
investigator </B>
<P><B>stayed the night, and told us that the ghost was that of a royalist,
from the </B>
<P><B>English civil war. He had been killed at a battle near there against
the </B>
<P><B>Parliamentrians.  In the church, a ghost of a monk, a salor and a </B>
<P><B>vage black shape have also been sighted. </B>
