<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: elliotvoge@yahoo.com</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I go here whenever
I'm in need of a scary place to go. I'm writing to tell of my personal
experiences at the Edna Collings Bridge. I have been on about 6 different
occasions. First of all, its a covered bridge, out in the middle of nowhere.
Its just where the road forks. Due to the lack of street lights you MUST pay
attention to in FRONT of you and BEHIND you. If a car comes and you are in the
bridge with your lights off it cannot see you and you may get hit. Also, on a
side note, there is a house just 150 yards away, so many people travel to the
bridge that the man who owns the house, has been known to shoot at cars who
turn around in his driveway. Yes I did say SHOOT. So go down the road a half
mile and pull off to the side if you need to turn around.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>As I said, I have been the the bridge several times. When I
go it is usually around midnight. One of my aunt and uncles experiences at the
bridge provided some scary physical signs of the paranormal. They took
themselves and two friends to the bridge. They drove a white full-sized van
with leather interior (this is relevant) to the bridge. They got there, turned
off the lights, honked three times and waited. They said that you could see
little movements, shadows moving around, nothing major (things people see
anytime you go someplace "haunted"). When you go everyone should stay
quiet as possible to hear footsteps and other creaks. A lot of the sounds in
the beginning may be from the bridge settling. After they sat in the van for
about a half an hour in silence, they all had felt what was to be described as
if someone had gotten onto the back passenger's side corner of the van and
jumped on the bumper. The leather in the van would make a squeaking noise if
someone from inside the van had moved. There was no squeak. That was about the
most major thing that happened to them AT the bridge. They left and pulled up
to a gas station a few miles up the road to check the van to see if anything
had happened. There was a tiny hand print caked in mud near the gas tank
cover... on the passengers side. My uncle put his hand next to it on the van
and when he pulled his hand away it pulled the dust off the van, the hand print
had added more dirt to it. So who ever touched it had wet hands at the time.
When they got home they put their daughters hand up to it to compare sizes
thinking maybe she had touched it. Her hand was double the size.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I have gone and personally had weird, nauseating sensations.
You almost feel like your dizzy and you don't quite feel all there. That could
just be me psyching myself into feelings things. We put a bobble head up on the
dash to see of movement really occurs. It rarely moved. However, on my
second-to-last visit we had something freaky happen. My aunt was driving there
were four of us. We heard what sounded like deep footsteps, unlike any we had
heard on the other visits. There was a little dark shadow my aunt and
stepsister claimed to see bob behind the tailgate of the truck bed (which makes
sense if a little girl died). This is the really scary part. Your supposed to
hold your keys in your hands because the little girl likes to play tricks on
you by hiding your keys. When you start up my uncles truck, the engine will
start to turn over, a second afterwards the dash lights up and then the stereo
lights up (mind you this all happens in like 3 seconds, and he drives an 05
chevy). We were sitting in the truck, all of a sudden there stereo light comes
on, the dash lights up, and the engine turns on. My aunt peels out of the
bridge and my uncles like "what the hell are you doing?" My aunts hands
were shaking and she said "I didn't start the truck". She claimed she
was cupping the keys in her hand when the stereo lit up and she let go, after
that she had let go of them and then the truck started. Instinctively she threw
it into drive and left. Haha, she couldn't drive home.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The last time we went, my uncle and I got cocky and decided
to lie in the bed of the truck outside in the bridge. We went into the bridge
and didn't speak to each other until we left. While we lay there we put the
bobble head up on the tailgate. It didn't move but very VERY slightly. The
worst part of the entire experience was that (upon talking about it afterwards)
we both had heard voices. I couldn't make out what they were saying but it
sounded like an old man's harsh voice, then a little girl would whimper or let
out a faint cry, then a dog would bark. But it was all so faint. This scared
the shit out of me. The story is that, fyi, the little girl was left to swim in
the creek with her dog, and an older man came up and murdered her. I know I
heard those three sounds, all fitting the peices to the story. I hadn't
discussed them with my uncle until we had left the bridge, and HE was the one
who mentioned hearing it! So I'm like AHHHHh i heard that too! </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Freaky stuff happens. other things I heard is that, one guy
drove in and got spooked so he turned on his car, threw on his lights and
floored it out of the bridge. He hit something that looked like a tall man, a
shadowy figure. He (being a brave soul) got out and checked and there was a
huge dent in the hood of his car, but no one around. There was supposedly a
police report filed too. I heard someone else went in and when they left they
went to that gas station too and there entire car had been keyed or something.
They filed a police report too. You can see what's in that bridge. If something
is there close enough for you to see you can see it. That car, would have seen
a person come up to key it even if it had been snuck up on. Alls I'm saying is
give that bridge more credit than you got. Its a wonderful site, deserves
recognition. It's legit.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anonymous</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I work for a large corporation that has been in business for
over 100 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This company now has
many facilities throughout the world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I,
however, happen to work in the original building the company built almost a
century ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Part of this building is a
manufacturing facility, and no doubt there must have been many deaths, as there
weren't the strict safety standards and provisions back then that we have
available now.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I have had 2 strange and very different encounters there
within weeks of each other.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The first encounter happened around lunch time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a tunnel that connects our main
building with the cafeteria and clubhouse across the street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You have to go down into the basement of the
main building to access the tunnel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
once you reach the other side you can either take the elevator up, or go
through a set of glass doors and take the steps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As my coworker and I walked through the tunnel
towards the glass door, we were alone in the tunnel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, when I pulled open the door I could
see quite clearly the reflection of a dark haired young man wearing a blue and
white striped shirt right behind me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
held the door open as you would if you knew someone were entering behind you,
but no one followed behind me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned
around and there was no one there - anywhere.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My coworker said I looked like I had seen a ghost and I told her that I
think I did.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The second occurance was even stranger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Part of my job is to maintain inventory for
our company store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This storeroom houses
items used by building maintenance and housekeeping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is located in the basement of the
building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I happened to be down there by
myself one afternoon labeling shelves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You could see the door to the storeroom from the aisle I was working
in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That door always slams shut when
someone enters or exits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never heard
or saw the door open or close.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But,
someone was standing there watching me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He would disappear if I looked straight at him, but out of the corner of
my eye I could see him standing there, wearing a light blue lab coat with his
hands the pockets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He appeared to be
older, from what I could tell,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was
balding on top, and what hair that was left was mostly gray.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried to ignore it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My boss would think I was nuts if I went back
to my desk refusing to work on account of ghosts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, I kept on about my business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, I felt like I was being watched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked out of the corner of my eye again,
and there he was, hands still in pockets, but about 10 feet closer this
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told myself I was just creeped
out from being down there by alone - the place is very old, dirty and
creepy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a few minutes later I "looked"
again and he was only about 15 feet from me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I made an excuse to be finished down there for the day.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I didn't feel any sense of malice or anger,
just being watched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this day I wonder
when I'm working down there if he used to do my job in years past was just
making sure I kept things the way he liked them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think I got his approval.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>in white center there is a house just a few blocks from the
funeral home that is haunted. my family lived there in<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the sixties. from 1967 to 1968. a women was
murdered there. we experienced several scary things. pounding on the floors
from under the house. screams late at night. fuses kept burning out one Friday
night while my brother and I were watching television. after a couple of times of
doing this it happened again. this time we went top change the fuse and
discovered that the main power switch , this time was pulled down. that switch
was so rusted it took both of us to push it back on. One night we came back
after dinner. It was dark in the house. When we unlocked the door we heard
someone or something jump down from something in the kitchen and heard
footsteps running out of the room. When we turned on the lights a chair was
pushed against the refrigerator and our family cat was on top hissing and
totally terrified. Its hair was standing up. The cat ran in the bathroom and
would not come out for hours. I was happy to move away from there. I wonder if
the current owners have had any trouble?<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My husband and I when we were dating stayed with another
couple at her grandparents' house to house sit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The house is one of those OLD houses with two wings in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend and her boyfriend stayed on one
side and they put us in the wing on the other side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On our side there were two bedrooms Ours and
then a master and a bathroom that connected to the master and also went out
into the hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you opened the door to
the master bedroom from the bathroom or from the hallway they are both bricked
off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The room is sealed off from the
rest of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We asked our friend
what had happened and she said that her grandparents didn't like to talk about
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While we stayed there many strange
things happened, all on our side of the house, footsteps in the hallway when
everyone was asleep and one night my now husband and I woke up at the same time
and he said "honey I think someone doesn't want us here" It felt like
someone was standing at the end of our bed and they weren't happy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say we left the next day.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>A couple of years later her grandparents sold the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About a year ago they got a call
from the new owners asking about the room (seriously who buys a house with a
blocked off room?)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well I guess that
they had put there little boy in the room that my husband and I had stayed in
and they little boy kept getting really sick, they checked the house for gas
and all other sorts of leaks and couldn't find anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They finally moved him out of the room and to
the other wing of the house and he got better.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The ended up locking up the room and using it as storage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day not to long ago they came home and
they couldn't find their dogs, well they finally found them, both dead in the
room that we had stayed in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The funny
thing is that the room had been locked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Haunted House - Glenelg South Australia</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: arjmasters@hotmail.com </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>In 1989 I lived for close to 12 months in a house in Glenelg
South, South Australia. I lived there with my Brother who was aged 20 and I was
17 years old. It was an old bungalow with beautiful lead light windows in the
master bedroom and lovely woodwork throughout the home. In the 1940&#8217;s a laundry
and toilet were built onto the back of the house and it was in this area that I
am convinced a spirit person was residing. Many strange phenomenons occurred
whilst living there. Lights would turn on and off by themselves, clocks would
tick backwards, things would go missing and turn up in the most peculiar
places, our dog would freak out for no apparent reason and many people who
visited felt very uncomfortable going to the back of the house. My girlfriends
would ask me to escort them to the toilet and have me wait in the laundry for
them as they were petrified of the energies they felt in the back part of the
house. It was quite scary. My Brother was a sceptic but by the time our lease
was up he was convinced that something wasn&#8217;t right in the back part of the
house. I felt that the spirit person would not travel past the kitchen door up
the hallway and people could feel a shift in energies when walking down the
hall, they would mention this to me even though they did not know about any of
the phenomenon which I and others had witnessed. I still drive past that house
on occasion and wonder if the new occupants ever feel anything in their home &#8211;
it has been fully renovated now and has a spa at the back of the house.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Haunted House</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I believe my old house that I grew up in, was haunted, and
still is. I had lived there for approximatley 14 years, and I encountered a few
strange things. When I was a child I had heard people talking in my house, when
everyone would go to sleep, I would hear creeking, and someone walking up and
down the stairs. I had even seen a young woman in my house several times. I
have heard a woman's voice aswell, but it is mostly murmuring, so it is hard to
understand. I have moved now, but I still think there is a prescence in that
house. This house is in Murrieta, California. It is right near Shivela Middle
School. There is also a house in the neighborhood that is right across from our
house, it was where we would always pick up our mail, in the mailbox. The
house's property is a part of where the mailbox is set, but many people have
witnessed seeing lights turn on in the house, or someone walking around by the
window, when the house is clearly abondonded. The house is very fragile inside,
so it would almost impossible for anyone to walk around inside.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>In North Branford CT, there is a cemetery called Bare Plain
cemetery,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 10 years ago, I was with
a bunch of friends in my car driving home going from Guilford to new
haven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I approached the cemetery,
the entrance to the cemetery had Fog coming out crossing RT 80.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I saw it I showed my friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I drove through the fog my car
swerved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend thought I did it to
scare them,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but I didn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Now 10 years later, I was talking to a girl at my work who's
father lives in North Branford,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
telling her my story and before I even got to the part with the fog. She
new.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She saw the fog too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I am not sure if this has happened to anyone else, this
cemetery is very old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A lot of the
graves are from 1700-1900.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mostly in the
1800's.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both times were at night around
10pm in the summer</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Grifftith Hall SFASU Nacogdoches Texas</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: lafreak18@yahoo.com </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I was a student at SFA living in Griffith Hall in
98-99.&nbsp; I am a true believer that the dorm is haunted.&nbsp; I always felt
it was haunted by two ghosts due to seperate experiences I had and two
completely different entities.&nbsp; I lived on the south wing of the fourth
floor so was always having to take the elevator.&nbsp; I was a night owl so
always roaming around the dorm late at night.&nbsp; Well one of the ghosts is a
very friendly and helpful spirit from what I have encountered.&nbsp; On
numerous occasions, especially if my hands have been full the elevator doors
would open up just as I walked in front of it.&nbsp; I would check the buttons
once I got in the elevator cause typically a lot of the girls in the dorm had a
thing about pressing all the floor buttons before going out and nothing would
be lit.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Now the ghost on the 3rd floor is a bit of an aggressive
spirit.&nbsp; The south wing of the 3rd floor at night is a very uncomfortable
place to be.&nbsp; You would walk down that hall and just get chills and
goosebumps.&nbsp; The hall light always seemed to be a lot dimmer than any of
the other hall lights.&nbsp; I was leaving a friends room on the 3rd floor late
one night and decided that I was going to be brave and take the stairs from the
end of the south hall up to my floor.&nbsp; About halfway down this hall I
started to feel very uncomfortable and started speeding up to the door at the
end of the hall, climbed the stairs and went&nbsp;into my room.&nbsp; I had
already been in my dorm room for almost a year so the following is what really
frightened me.&nbsp; I sat down on my bed to watch some TV to try to calm my
nerves a bit.&nbsp; All of sudden the blinds started bang against my window; my
blinds had never done that before.&nbsp; My window was not opened and the air
in the building<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was not on so I could
find no excuse for my blinds to act like that.&nbsp; Needless to say I hid
under my blanket and just hoped that whatever was doing it would just go
away.&nbsp; It did after about five minutes.&nbsp; I always felt as if I
disturbed the ghost on the 3rd floor that night and she decided to follow me to
my room.&nbsp; That is my story.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Several Stories</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: golden.firefly85@yahoo.com</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I have several stories, so I'll email them all together.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>1) When I was little, until the age of about five, my family
and I lived in an old farmhouse in Tennessee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Across the street was an abandoned house, a two-story
Victorian-style.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lot around it was
completely empty, just trees separating it from its neighbors.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My sisters and I would go over there after school and play
in the yard- we never went in the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was almost six when this happened, I know that because we moved a few
months later. One day we were playing hide-and-seek over there, and I hid
behind a bush right near the side of the porch, under a window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>As I was hiding, I started to hear noises from inside the
house, just one the other side of the wall: running feet and a child's muffled
laughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought it was one of my
sisters, and since our mother told us she'd skin us alive if we went in the house
(it was literally falling apart and none too safe), I got out from behind the
bush and peeked in the window to tell them to come out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was broad daylight, so if one of them had
been in the house I would have been able to see them, but there wasn't anyone
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My eldest sister then scared the
living crap out of me by grabbing me from behind, and we found my elder sister
hiding about 30 feet from the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>When we left to go home, I looked back at the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had a window in the very top, an attic
window I guess, and I saw a woman in old-fashioned clothes standing there
watching us.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The other stories involve the college I went to, and are
both my personal experiences and stories I've heard from others. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>2) I attended Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois,
supposedly one of the most haunted campuses in the state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's built right next door to the oldest
cemetery in town, and almost everyone I know has had some kind of strange
experience.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My freshman year, I stayed in Aston Hall, one of the
original dormitories on campus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night
I woke up and heard footsteps and loud voices in the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a weekend, so I just assumed that some
of the girls had come back drunk and were being loud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got up and went to my door to tell them to
keep it down, but the second I opened the door the voices stopped, and there
was no one in the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would have
brushed it off as them hearing my door and shutting up, but it was our Fall
Break and so a lot of the girls had gone home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only girls besides myself that were still there lived at the
opposite end of the hallway from me, and the voices had sounded like they were
right outside my door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I decided to just
go back to sleep.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>A few hours later, I woke up with someone pounding on my
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I opened it to find two of the
girls who hadn't gone home, roomates, completely hysterical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They came in my room and told me what
happened:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They'd been in bed when Amy's
printer started printing on its own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
computer had been on, so Amy got up, stopped the printing job, and turned off
the computer, then went back to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
few minutes later, the printer started up again even though the computer was
off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time Amy turned off the
printer, unplugged it from the computer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Erin her roomate was awake by now, so they both laid in bed waiting to
see what would happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not too long
after, all hell broke loose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The printer
started printing, all the lights (the overhead light and both the lamps)
blinked on and off, and the blinds started blowing around like the window was
open in a heavy wind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the blinds
started moving, Amy looked over at the window and felt someone grab her
shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We found out a little while
later that a girl had killed herself in our dorm, back in the 30s or 40s.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We think that's who they saw.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My sister went to Millikin as well, and as a music major she
spent a lot of time in the Chapel because it had practice rooms in the
basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night she was down there
practicing for her recital the next day, and she was the only one in the building,
which she knew since a security guard had had to let her in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway she was practicing, and heard
footsteps in the chapel upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
stopped playing, and the footsteps stopped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When she started playing again, the footsteps started again, moving down
the stairs toward the practice rooms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She kept playing, and eventually the footsteps came right up to the door
of the room she was in-- there was even the shadow of someone's face on the
little window in the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then there
was nothing, and the shadow disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She called security to see if they'd let anyone else in the building,
and they said that no, they hadn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
same thing happened several times, and after a while she refused to practice
there anymore.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>In my senior year, I took a photography class.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The darkroom was in the basement of one of
the buildings bordering the cemetery, so I spent a lot of time down there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was down there working on my final one
night, by myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of my classmates
had been there with me for a little while, but she'd left to go get a drink from
the vending machine upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had the
radio on to keep us company, but it wasn't very loud or anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway I had my back to the entry
"tunnel" (a small twisting hallway built to keep as much light out as
possible) when I clearly heard the door open and close.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought it was my classmate, so I started
talking to her about the print I was developing at the time, which we'd been
talking about before she left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She didn't
say anything, so I turned around to see that there wasn't anyone there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A second after I turned around, the
safelights (red lights that don't hurt the photo paper) all turned off at once,
which is impossible since the switches are spread around the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was very surprised so I didn't move right
away, but after a few seconds the room got very cold, and I could sense someone
standing very near to or right in front of me; I could also feel someone's
breath on me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then all the lights turned
back on, including the non-photosafe ones, and the temperature returned to
normal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was still standing there,
frozen, when my classmate came back with her drink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This all happened very quickly, she was only
gone a couple of minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that I
refused to work down there alone.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Also, a girl was killed in a nearby park my freshman
year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There isn't much to this
particular story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was killed and
dumped in the pond in the park, and if you walk by the pond you'll hear
splashing when the water is completely still, or someone crying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A very close friend of mine who doesn't shake
easily or believe in ghosts at all told me he saw what looked like a body in
the pond, just floating underwater.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
says she was faint, but visible; this was a few years after her murder, so we
went to the library and looked up the story in the archives-- he confirmed that
the murdered girl was the girl he saw in the water.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I wanted to say that I liked your website and would like to
add something. the listing that you have for the traverse city "hippie
tree." that is actually far enough from the actual buildings and people
can walk to it. I am a native of traverse and grew up with family members who
used to work at the state hospital while it was an assylum. sadly i was always
dissappointed by the hippie tree. however there are two sets of tree's by the
creek just in eye view of the school. they are known as the largest tree's in
michigan. as warped and old as they are. in the evening when the sun is setting
the light gives it a nice eary glow and you can hear a whisper from a man in
the north tree. also the beloved cow of the patients and state hospital was
buried on the property with a stone with its name, date of death and small bit
of information listed. that can be found over by the children's school on the
hospital grounds. follow the unpaved path that goes just past it and not far is
the headstone. if any one goes on the grounds even the walking area there are
bits of the old hospital everywhere and a great area to investigate even though
you cannot go into the main buildings. there are several in the back you are
allowed to walk up to and look at. frequently if you watch for a bit, you will
see a woman walk by the window upstairs or she will wave at you. this can be
seen at night or even during the day. I take alot of walks personally on the
grounds. i feel very at home there and was happy to see you had it listed on
your site.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>when the fire accured in the central grade school, my mother
and aunt were students there. it happened on the third floor. even till now
they do not use or allow others up there. some staff store a few things,
however none of them go further then the first few rooms. not all of it has
been repaired. just cleaned. a tour will be allowed with an appointment.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>according to my dad, on sawyer road, there was a woman
walking home since her car broke down and she was hit. people have spotted her
mainly on mist filled nights or late evening when the light begins to change.
she may be the one who some will say they see a lady with a cloth on her head
and a candle in her hand. some feel she is looking to see what happened to
herself or that she is looking for her car since its no longer there. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>after reading all this, i appreciate your time you took.
thank you</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Banning Mill, Carrollton, Georgia</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: solestridrummer@gmail.com </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I am writing to you to submit Banning Mill, in west central
Georgia, as a haunted site to investigate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the 1990's the old mill was rented out to college students for
apartments and I had several friends who lived there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides closets with cold black holes (and
the feeling that someone was in them looking out at us) objects in the
apartments would often be moved by unseen forces, and one back staircase in
particular was haunted... going up or down it many times I could feel something
behind me although I was alone, and once some thing tried to shove me down the
stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the 1970's it is said a lot
of LSD hippie parties were held there and perhaps some of that weird psychic
energy, combined with the misery of long-gone mill and factory workers from the
1880's-1930's has combined to create a strange atmosphere.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I am including a link to an official site about Banning
Mill, but the site does not mention any hauntings. Go figure.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2609</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I live in New Mexico now, but still believe Banning Mill is
a place where paranormal activity could easily be found.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: tischofer@comcast.net </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I recently rented a cottage on this road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stayed there for one year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Strange things happened there but I just
thought it was me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ignored most of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was going through some tough times and
would always be awake between 3-4 am.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was completely awake when a women said something in the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said "Matt".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also during that time scratching and noises
were heard at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was probably
Mice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During this time on another day, I
heard something pass right by my window.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The window has an air conditioner which was not too insulated so I heard
it really well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sounded like a horse
galloping right by the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought
it was a deer, but do deer gallop?</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Other times I was always conscience of shutting lights off
to keep the Elec bill down and the lights were on a couple of times when I
klnow I shut them off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ignored that
too.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>So, I went to COmcast to pay my bill and the gut there
says" oh, you live on Ames road, did you know it was haunted?"</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I said yeah right but he said to look it up and I found your
site.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Sounds weird but hey thought I would share.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Have worked here at Carlisle Barracks for 20 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our office was located in the Old
Commissary/Commissary Warehouse (Bldg 315) I arrived at work early one morning
several years ago (and of course it was around Halloween) anyway, I proceeded
to unlock the front door of the bldg, entered and proceed to unlock the door to
office area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are steps leading up
to the second floor. I got a glimpse of someone passing at the top of the
stairs from left to right going into another office area that was located up
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I found it odd because I was the
only one in the building as I thought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
decide I had better go up and see who was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I proceeded up the stairs, a strange
feeling overcame me and in the back of my mind, I heard, or sensed not to
proceed any further up the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
tried to go on up, but the feeling became more pronounced and I actually got
the feeling or sense if I did that something would happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I decided at the time, not to go any further
and heed the voice in my head and just go back down the stairs.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Never did find out what or who was up there, but I do
remember seeing a Shadow person, a black mass up there and it scared me or at
least made me think twice about investigating further </big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>This house has been investagated by a paranormal team and
found it is haunted by 23 different indivuals. The one most seen &amp; heard is
of a little girl who ask about her Mommie and speaks of a little doll. Other
sounds such as footsteps, cold spots, hot spots, flash's of lights and being
spoken to are often reported. You can see a lady standing in the upstairs
window when you approach the front door and feelings of being watched. The
animals on this property have been reported of chasing after something unseen -
up the dinning room steps back into the atic which is blocked off. There are
times when the animals on this residence will not even go into the backyard but
will sit at the dinning room window and growl and bark. The animals that have
died while living in the residence can often be heard jumping off of beds that
are no longer in those rooms, hearing dog tags jingling and on christmas eve
they've heard their past pets howling from the basement back door. The animals
that died were Siberian Huskys and Alaskan Malamutes. So howling for those
breeds are a way of speaking. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Smells of perfume are smelt when the woman of the residence
is away. Curtian rods being taken off of the hooks, shelfs falling off the wall
and the items being thrown to the other side of the room have happened. The
residences are not sure of what was once on the property prior to the house
being built 80 years ago. Orbs, Strange lights &amp; streaks of orbs are seen
in any photo taken of the house or photo.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>This day the residence is still occupied by the owners whom
had it investagated reciently. They will remain in the home for none of the
above are threatening nor harmful. They said that they wish they could help the
little girl find her mommie, for she is appx 4 to 6 yrs old, Wears victorian
clothing, has long hair kept in bananna curls and likes to peak around the
corners and play.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>One of the owners dogs has slept in a corner at nights under
a table where the little girl has been heard and seen sitting.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I am the woman of
this residence and let me tell you years ago it scared the hibbie jibbies out
of me.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Now my husband and i have become accustomed to it and it no
longer bothers us lol. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My husband has also seen my father apear in the doorway of
where he'd be sitting, scolling at him.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My husband never knew my father for he'd passed away several
years prior to me marring.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Just browsing
through, but I thought that I'd share a story that was relayed to me by my
parent&#8217;s years ago...</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>When my parents first
met they found themselves driving home from a college basketball game in
Syracuse, New York.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, the
man that was to become my father, experienced engine trouble and was forced to
pull his car over to the side of the road.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Now I know that this sounds like a typical
"parking" story, but they pulled over near a local cemetery, because
there was a snow storm coming through and traffic was heavy because of the
game.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My father, to this day, swears that as he was looking
underneath the hood of his car, while my mother was still in the passenger
seat, he was approached by an elderly gentleman who asked him if he needed
assistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being young, on a date and
probably late for curfew, he accepted.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My father stated that he then returned to his car, turned
the ignition when the man stated to "give it a try now" and
amazingly, the car started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father
stated that when he exited his car to thank the man, he was gone.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The unusual aspect about the whole encounter was that when
my father said that he tried to track the man down by following his footprints,
he found none.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No footprints, no tire
tracks, nothing at all in the snow.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Like I said, maybe this is an excuse given to my
grandparents years ago that carried over into the next generation, but my
parents swear to it this day.</big></big></p>

I saw a lot of stuff, from like a woman Walking around in a white dress some

Kitchen when it was Closed and when I turned away cause someone Was yelling for

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>England Story</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: ivanyamine@aol.com</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>This story may sound a tadge on the weird sound, however I
swear every word is true.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>To give you some backround, I live in the South of England,
in the Thames Valley. A rather over populated area around London. When I was 11
(24 now) my Dad and Stepmum moved house, when we went to view this particular
one I developed a blinding headache almost the moment we stepped foot into the
house, a full on thumping migraine. The pain was so bad that I was physically
sick. I was rather peeved off about this as my best friend was due to come for
a sleepover and my dad used his mobile to cancel the visit. Well, as soon as we
left the house and drove a few yards down the road my headache completely
cleared... anyway, despite this my Dad decided to go for that one.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>A few years later my little sister was born. I had always
had bad feelings about the house, never heard or saw anything but I would feel
VERY uncomfortable at random times. I put this down to my overactive
imagination. Anyway, after little sis was born, I had been rudely awoken by her
crying. After a while I decided I was thirsty so I got up to go downstairs and
get a drink. Now, because of the uncomfortable feelings I would always turn
every light on on my way and avoid looking around too much. On this night, as I
turned at the bottom of the stairs, walked down the hall and flicked on the
kitchen light I saw what I can only describe as a little man running into the
shadows betwen the fridge and washing machine. It was about 3 ft tall and
definately was moving on two legs like a person, except it was more like the
fawn in the Lion, Witch and Wardrobe to look at. As well as this I also HEARD
the tapping of feet (hooves?) as whatever it was scarpered. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Needless to say I legged it back to my room rather quickly.
However, now I think about it the poor thing was obviously more frightened of
me!</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>One more story if I may?</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I now live in the SouthWest of England, land of cider and
Stonehenge. I live with my boyfriend in a lovely little bungalow which is very
very old. It used to be three kitchens for the BIG house next door. My bedroom
is one old kitchen, my living room is another and the kitchen and bathroom is
another one. To get to the toilet and kitchen you have to walk past the shower
room and I always feellike I am being watched from this room. I get the feeling
that it is a girl, and I seem to get a mental image of long hair and a longish
blue dress with a white apron, sleeves rolled up and a slightly p-d off
expression on her face. She doesn't scare me though, I kinda feel sorry for
her, because she must find it strange seeing naked people in the shower in HER
kitchen!</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: . HARLOCK@wi.rr.com </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My husband is relating a story here:</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>When I was a sophomore in college, my father moved to
Carbondale PA to run an episcople church there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He and his wife bought a house that had been converted from a barn at
some point in its history, and which also happened to be right next to a civil
war era cemetary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was in<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the hills above Carbondale and the whole
place was riddled with ruins of houses, cemetaries, mills, a glass factory, you
name it, it was out there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've never
been in a place like that since.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
amazing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Anyway, as I said, the house was a converted barn, so it had
the barn shape and only a converted hay loft divided in to two bedrooms and a
bathroom for its upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
"hallway" connecting all three was a walkway that fronted each room
and ended in stairs which hugged the north wall of the building and came down
behind the fireplace which sate in the northerly center area of the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was quite attractive in a rustic sort of
way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All hardwood fixtures and floors,
with the chimney of the firplace plastered cobbles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>There were only the two bedrooms, which my sister and step
sister occupied upstairs, and my father and his wife had a large alcove off the
kitchen where their "bedroom" was.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I was visiting them over Christmas break, and I was sacked out in front
of the fireplace with the two dogs, and from where I lay I could see the entire
gantry/walkway, as one side had only the railing as its buffer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was reading a book in front of the fire,
locked in place between the two dogs, when the walkway creaked, as if someone
was putting weight on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whole
house did this whenever anyone walked so you got used to now sneaking
around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked up and saw no one, so I
figured it was settling or something like that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But then the weight shifted, the way it does when someone walks, and
that's exactly what it sounded like: someone walking toward the stairway from
my sisters room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again I looked up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, nothing was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dogs were now alert too, there eyes
following the sound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The walking
continued down to the stairway, came halfway down the stairs, and stopped
behind the chimney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then nothing, except
the dogs jumping up and going to the spot behind the chimney where the noise
stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was shaking at that point,
but I got up too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked, saw nothing,
and went back to my bedroll.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lay awake
a long time after that, waiting for it to happen again, but it didn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the rest of the time I was there, nothing
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I asked my dad, and the girls about it the next day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My dad said his wife Debby thought the place
was haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The girls weren't aware of
anything happening the previous night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don't know whether I beleive in ghosts, but that left me wondering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think most ghosts stories are urban
legends, but I can't explain what happened that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I tell the story and let people decide for
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>That's my story.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I was a resident at the main site in lawrence housing
authority for three years. On one occasion my bookshelf that was full of books
tilted and dumped all my books on the floor. The hallway light would turn on
and the smoke alarm would go off waking myself and my three children in the
middle of the night. When I would file a complaint, maintenance would say it
was electrical and yet it still went off without any batteries and the hall
light came on when there was no bulb. </big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I have been having strange things happening to me since i
was a child and continuing into adult hood.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But i have a query which is based on this incident and i would love if
anyone could give some feedback.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1999
during the summer I had an experience which up today i really can not find
sufficient information on what it was.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I had just returned home around 2:00 a.m. in the morning,
and since it was very hot i opened all balcony windows and shutters to allow a
breeze to come into my 3rd floor apartment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As i was laying down reading a book with my cat, i felt as if someone
was looking at me I turned and looked out on the balcony and saw a man about 6
foot tall dressed all in black with shoulder length hair. Believe or not but my
first thought was, wasn't this guy hot since he was wearing a long black
raincoat..... his features i couldn't see.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I ran out of the room with my cat which had started hissing before i
even saw him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Left the apartment went
downstairs out on the street.. trying to come up with a logical explanation to
what it was that i had just seen. After<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>a while i calmed myself down by concluding that I probably had drifted
off to sleep and dreamt the whole thing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Seeming like a logical explanation i<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>went back up to the apartment and when the sun rose i finally fell
asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Around 10 in the morning my
cousin which lives on the first floor of the apartment building woke me up...
she wanted to share something with me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She wanted to tell me that she had seen the strangest thing and just
couldn't explain it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told me that
around 2ish in the morning as she was on the phone with her boyfriend, she saw
this guy on her balcony. which fit my description down to the hair and
raincoat... and when i asked her what did he do ..... her answer is that he
drifted upwards... and by drifting she meant that he seemed to be floating
upwards. She compared his upward motion very similar to superman's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I have been trying to find out what this guy was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So if anyone has any sound information I
would be more than grateful if they could share with me.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Skyscraper Building at Loyola</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: gemini.25@hotmail.com</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I wanted to provide an update on Sky at Loyola in Chicago,
since I obtained my BA from the school.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>First off, that building is extremely creepy. There&#8217;s an
elevator bank that provides access to the upper floors, but it&#8217;s dismantled.
I&#8217;m not sure why they don&#8217;t fix it and just cut off access to the upper floors,
because students have to wait forever for the two functioning elevators
before/after class when it&#8217;s really crowded. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>All entrances to the upstairs are blocked off, but being the
daring students we were back in the day, three of us snuck up to the upper
floors. It&#8217;s the creepiest place ever, and I will never forget my experience.
We went on a random weekday around 7 or 8 at night, when the building was
essentially vacant. If I can recall correctly, we snuck in through a back
staircase. It was like walking back in time to the 1950&#8217;s. Rooms were set up
like antique dorms. There was old, dusty shag carpeting (yellow I think), and
antique desks and chairs. Nothing looked like it had been touched in ages. I
think there are about 3 or 4 top floors that are vacant, and we almost got to
the top. As we were hunting around, we kept hearing footsteps (completely
freaking us out) that seemed as if they were in the hall, extremely close to
where we were. I don&#8217;t think they could have been from another floor, and even
if they were, a) we were almost at the top and the floors above and below us
were vacant and b) it was later in the evening after classes, and there really
weren&#8217;t any students or faculty left in the building. Needless to say we
hightailed it out of there. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>During my time at Loyola, I also saw random lights in the
top floors that were vacant. I was told about the priest/nun story as well, and
supposedly they shut down the nun dorm after the one who had the affair with
the priest hung herself. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s a true story or not.
Regardless, I can&#8217;t understand why the school never remodeled or touched those
upper floors. It&#8217;s valuable space, but yet it&#8217;s all sectioned off. We were also
told if we got caught sneaking into the upper floors, we&#8217;d be expelled. Loyola
definitely keeps the story and those floors under tight wraps.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I have had 2 White German Shepherds so far in my life
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first I got when I was around
5 years old, his name was Snowball and I loved him so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He lived to be 13 years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had to have him put to rest as he was
getting old and as German Shepherds do he was having hip problems.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was around 17 when this happened and was
highly upset.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For many years afterwards
I would hear snowball come into my room circle and then lay down next to my
bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We eventually got another dog a
Belgium Shepherd, Charlie who is still alive, he would come to my door at night
when I would hear Snowball's ghost and Charlie would whimper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although after a while I stopped receiving
the night-time visits and Charlie started sleeping on my floor. I then had a
dream of a large field and Snowball was there playing with other dogs some of
which were dogs I had known that were put to rest as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then when I was around 20 I received another
White German Shepherd Xena.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Charlie and
she were great friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Charlie is a
chubby guy so when he would eat Xena would block his bowl every few minutes and
growl as if telling him to slow down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
moved a few times always keeping the dogs close by and usually inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents purchased a 5 acre lot off of a
main road which scared me because the dogs where very curious and always
escaped usually into what ever neighborhood we lived in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One evening I came out to find the gate wide
open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started yelling for Xena and
Charlie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually Charlie came to the
back gate with his tail between his legs and whimpering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I instantly knew something was wrong. I
yelled inside about what I found and took off up the road in my car only to
find poor Xena laying dead on the side of the road still warm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She must have come running when I called and
not paid attention to the road as she was very obedient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I again was very upset.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That evening I cried myself to sleep and was
out pretty deeply when I felt something with four feet jump up onto my bed
circle and lay next to me, this was at my house where I have no dogs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first it scared the daylights out of me
and I froze in place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Remembering what
happened with Snowball I cautiously said out loud "Xena its ok baby girl
you can go play you don't need to watch over me anymore I love you!" of
course I started crying again yet the feeling of her laying next to me
dissipated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I dreamt that night of again
the field with the dogs, now more dogs I had known that had passed away including
Snowball and Xena were there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the
best feeling dream I have had in my life we played ball and ran in this field
and I woke up knowing that Xena listened to me as she always had in life and
moved on to her heaven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although
sometimes Charlie still scoots back from his bowl of food and looks at it as
thought Xena is blocking him from chowing down. </big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>A Visit from My Mother</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: Adr1125@aol.com</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I&#8217;ve wanted for a long time to put down on paper the
experience that I had that &#8220;awakened&#8221; something inside me that I have tried to
ignore my whole life.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Let me start by saying that I have always been sensitive to
the emotions and feelings of the people around me. I can remember being a
little girl and &#8220;knowing&#8221; what the adults around me were thinking and feeling.
Being a child with a child&#8217;s logic I often mentioned this to who ever would
listen much to my mother&#8217;s chagrin. Just random things like if someone was
lying or had done something dishonest.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>But I digress, this story is about the single experience I
had that took that gift and magnified it times ten.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I was raised by a single parent and have a younger sister
who is disabled (developmentally delayed). This incident happened September
27th 2002. I was 23 years old had just broken up with my boyfriend and moved
back home. That morning my mother and sister had went out for a late breakfast
and I heard them come back at around noon. I went upstairs to say hello (my
bedroom was the entire finished basement, the door opened to the kitchen). My
mother mentioned that she had a head ach and was going to go lay down. Thinking
nothing of it I returned to my room to finish the movie I was watching. Not
twenty minutes later as I was sitting on the couch in my bed room, a voice
whispered in my ear &#8220;Run now!&#8221; </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I jumped up startled and looked around to see where it was
coming from. At that same moment I heard a crash from upstairs, somehow I
&#8220;knew&#8221; from my mother&#8217;s room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I ran up stairs to find my mother on the floor at the foot
of her bed. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>After hours in the hospital the doctors finally told us she
had had a massive stroke and the outcome didn&#8217;t look good.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhausted physically and emotionally, my
sister and I went to our aunt&#8217;s house to get some sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had been up for twenty four hours at this
point and feel asleep as soon as my head touched the pillow on my aunt&#8217;s sofa.
At 2:30 in the morning, only two hours after leaving the hospital, I awoke with
a start. Sitting by my feet was my mother. For a second I thought I had dreamed
the last day&#8217;s tragedy, I was so happy to see her. But when I looked closely at
her she was transparent and seemed so sad. She looked as if she had been
crying, and that made me cry. She then started to talk, but what&#8217;s weird is
that I heard her in my head. She told me she was so sorry for leaving us and
made me promise to always take care of my sister. She said she loved me and my
sister very much and wanted us to be happy and I would see her again. At this
point I was crying so hard that my aunt and cousins came running in the room.
They later told me that they heard me talking to someone but I was in the
living room alone in the dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My cousin
had even turned the light on and said I was just crying and talking to the
empty space on the couch. At the same time all of this was going on the phone
rang. My Uncle answered it and it was the hospital. My mother had stopped
breathing on her own and no longer had any brain activity. They had pronounced
her brain dead at 2:30 am and were calling us for us to come back to the
hospital. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Since that time I have been like a paranormal tuning fork.
(Sorry I couldn&#8217;t think of a better analogy) I can&#8217;t walk past a cemetery
without picking up little things about its residents or having one try to get
my attention. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Well that&#8217;s it for this story, trust me I have more, but
this one was long enough by itself. Thank you for allowing me to share.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: caryndf1@att.net </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>In 1992-1994 I worked at Captain Ed's Head Shoppe located on
Van Nuys Blvd. between Sherman Way &amp; Victory Blvd., Van Nuys, CA 91406
(This place still exists today)</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>After hours, late one night, with the store completely
closed and void of all customers, I was sitting quietly talking with a
co-worker. both of us heard loud foot steps on the hardwood floor. There was no
mistake the footsteps we both heard were made by boots and with the store
having all hardwood flooring that was very old, (it's still there!) the floor
creaked with each footstep getting louder going back and forth from one end of
the store to the other.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My co-worker said that there was a man who had an
affiliation with the store, his name was "Bill", nicknamed
"Crazy Bill", for some reason unbeknownst to me that died. Where/how
he died I also do not know however, there was no mistake of what we both heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was told, Crazy Bill was always known to
wear cowboy boots and he used to pace the store. My co-worker actually knew
"Crazy Bill".</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>With the exception of my co-worker and I whispering to each
other and the footsteps pacing, the place was quiet to the point you could hear
a pin drop. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The footsteps kept pacing back and forth and they came right
up to us and stopped. At the same time, little bells on display hung with
decorative little ropes on the ceiling began to jingle. (The bells are also
still there)</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>This,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I personally
witnessed "several" times throughout the time I worked there.
"Always" late at night and after closing time. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Captain Ed Adair, who was the owner of the store, not long
after I was hired, died of Leukemia. My co-worker had said at other times he
saw an apparition of Captain Ed Adair walking fast through the store, as if he
was in a hurry and then he would disappear. This is just heresay as I never
witnessed this occurance myself, but at the same time... my co-worker was a
reliable source and not prone to lie or exaggerate. If he said it happened I
believe it!</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I also later came to find that Captain Ed Adair was a close
friend of Crazy Bill.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Lastly Captain Ed's Head Shoppe has been there ever since
the mid sixties. When you walk in the place to this very day, it's like walking
through a time warp. Every picture/poster on the walls are the exact same way
they were in the sixties.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I attend Austin High School and the Spanish Teacher wrecked
on her way to school during the summer time not during the school year.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I was told this by a teacher who knew her.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Many experiences occur near the library and office area in
the Middle School part (The middle school and high school are the same
building)</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I've written to Shadowlands before several years ago looking
for answers regarding a possible poltergeist in my home. It was just one
incident, but I still cannot explain it. However, the latest thing that
happened to me was of an auditory nature. It was late at night, and I was doing
dishes at the kitchen sink. I suddenly heard the sound of jingling bells behind
me. They were quite loud and I heard them a couple of times - that is, they
jingled for a few seconds, then stopped, then jingled again. It sounded as if a
cat or dog with bell on its collar was running towards me. However, the ringing
was louder and clearer than the usual tiny bell that barely makes any noise on
these kinds of pet collars. When I heard the noise, I turned around to see if
my cat was coming into the ktichen. I called her name, and looked around but
saw nothing. I looked around the house and couldn't find her. And then I
remembered I had put her outside about an hour or so before that! And I don't
have any other animals. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I don't know if it was the ghost of a cat I once had, or
another manifestation of the poltergeist I once experienced. I actually was
badly traumatized by the death of my cat a few years ago. He had been poisoned,
either purposely or not, by consumming antifreeze, which shut down his kidneys.
I never found out who did it, or if it was an accidental case of the cat, who
would go outdoors and around the neighborhood, lapping up someone's antifreeze
from their oil pan under their car. I mourned his loss, and I took it hard. I
guess felt guilty for not bringing him to the vet sooner. His sister is still
with us, and is the cat that I had put outside that night. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I suppose I'll never know the origin of the bell sounds.
Yes, they sounded like a cat's bell collar, but much louder and clearer than
that. Plus, my deceased cat hardly wore a collar - it kept coming off!</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: meganbechtel@gmail.com </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My fiance says he doesn't exactly disbelieve nor believe in
the paranormal. He is, however, very cynical and makes fun of me for having
these interests. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>He had an experience almost exactly three years ago that has
made him a little more... open minded. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>It was not a 'dark and stormy night' but it was a late,
dark, and chilly mid-October night in north-western Georgia when he saw what he
believes was a ghost. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>He was getting kicked out of a 'friend's' house he'd been
staying at for a week, and went to hide his belongings in the woods, which was
really about a few acres or so of trees that separated the subdivision and the
local Kohl's. He returned to the house to use the phone, and after making
arrangements, proceeded back to the woods with the evictor's dog by his side to
claim his bags. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>As he was making his way through the woods in complete
darkness- save for his lighter he used as a mini torch- he thought he saw what
looked like a person a few yards ahead. Convinced he was just seeing a trick of
the light, he moved foreward confidently. The closer he got, the more concerned
he became. It looked like a person, deffinately. But what would some random
person be doing standing out in the woods at this chilly hour? Using his
lighter to see, he crept closer and was happy to know the dog was still by his
side. Closer, he realized it was a teenage girl, wearing what looked like a
white dress. He called out "Hello?" several times with no response.
He got up to about three feet away when the realization came that this young
lady was neither moving nor speaking, and with confusion and adrenaline he
turned and ran back out of the woods to the somewhat-comfort of the house. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>He called his father and told him what happened, and when he
came to pick him up, demanded that he accompany him back in to the woods to get
his bags. He showed him where he had seen this apparation, but of course,
nothing was there. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>He has said that at first, thinking it over, he thought it
could have been maybe some crazy and/or drugged out girl just mindlessly being
in the woods. He expressed that the county he was in is a huge meth county, one
of the worst and has even been on A&amp;E shows due to its epedemic. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>But more thinking lead him to believe and actually admit
that he thought it was a ghost. I was actually excited to hear him say this! </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Three<span style="">&nbsp; </span>years later, in
this present day, he still unenthusiastically admits he belives he saw a ghost.
The "woods" he experienced her in are now completely torn down, to
make way for yet another commercial establishment in the quickly growing
county. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Personally, I remember seeing TONS of shows about Georgia
hauntings; Cival War related and other. I once considared that maybe this girl
died in those woods, from whatever cause, and her spirit was restless because
she knew that the woods would be cut down and that maybe, she wanted her body
to be found before some wal-mart-type-thing was built on top of her grave. John
also feels that the reason he saw her was because he was on her same emotional
level, and was mentally 'open' to experience her. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>That last part is just creative wonderings, but the fact
remains that even skeptics can be humbled!</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>When we lived in Killeen, Texas, outside of Ft Hood, Tx., at
least 12 years ago, I got a call from my stepmother that my dad was probably
having another heart attack. I was praying in my bathroom later when the fan
turned on. I felt warm and wonderful like everything was going to be okay.
After about 3 minutes...seemed like forever..the fan turned off on it's own. I
did check out all the buttons and nothing was stuck so can't explain it .Told
my dad when I saw him and he said that with his first heart attack he saw an
angel with wings right outside his hospital room He always thought it was a
guardian angel I hope it was</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I just wanted to tell you about a place I used to work at
that I, and many other people think is haunted. This building is called Fridley
Theatres Springwood 9. It is located in Ankeny, Iowa. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I worked in this building for well over 2 years and
experienced countless times strange happenings. The most famous incident
happens about 3 times a year. At night we have one person stay to close the
building and shut all the projectors and the lights off in the projection room.
That person has to wait until every customer has left the theatre, and no one
is in the parking lot. We do a clean sweep of the whole complex inside and out.
Sometimes after that person is done shutting things off and is doing office
work in the managers office, the projectors will turn themselves on. Movies
will start playing and not at the beginning of the movie. Sometimes it starts
at the middle or during a loud scene. Sometimes we hear running up and down the
flight of stairs to the projection booth. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>3 people were in one of our theatres and witnessed a strange
figure on the ceiling when the lights were dimmed. We started to run out of the
theatre in fear to find that the door would not open. The lights went out
completely. About 30 seconds later the lights would go up and the door would
open. There is no lock on the door, nor do they stick that tightly. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>A man did die a few years ago in one of our theatres of a
heart attack. He was watching a batman movie with his teenage son. His son
thought that his father had nodded off to sleep, but when the movie ended his
father did not wake up. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>If you have any questions please feel free to email me back.
I would love to discuss this in more detail. I did leave a lot out in case you
were not interested.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I have so many stories that I don't know where to begin, and
to keep myself and everyone else from being overwhelmed, I will share just one
at this time. This happened to me about 12 years ago, maybe 13. At the time, I
was living in a one room efficiency apartment in the basement of an elder
couple's home. This is in Old Town, Maine.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>One night I left a dim nightlight on in my bathroom, which
was directly across from my bed. It was well after midnight when I opened my
eyes from a light sleep and saw shadow movements on the wall right next to my
bed. (My back was turned toward the bathroom that had the light on). I was
startled, as I knew nobody else was in my room. I lived alone, no pets at that
time, either. I slowly turned around, afraid of what I might see, and hovering
right below the ceiling in the bathroom, in full view, was a big jet-black
cloud. It was so black and stood out so well, there was no mistaking it for
anything else. I lay there in shock at what I was seeing with my own two eyes.
It stayed there, unmoving yet undulating in one spot, then it just disappeared
right before my eyes!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this day I have
no idea what that was. That was sure fire proof to me of other beings in the
universe besides just us humans. And thank God there is!</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>This happened to me 49 years ago, when I was 13 years old.
It still raises the hair on the back of my neck whenever I think about it. It
was my first experience with the supernatural.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>We lived on an old farm in the middle of nowhere on the
Kansas prairie. My sister and I slept in a downstairs bedroom next to my
parents' room. It was summer time and the moon was full, sometime after
midnight. My sister was gone, visiting my Aunt and Uncle and I was alone in the
room. I was on the verge of falling asleep when something started bouncing on
the bed beside me. It bounced from my head to my feet and back again, several
times. I jumped up and ran to my mother's door, calling for her to wake up and
come see. She got up and came with me to my room as I explained that a mouse or
something was in my bed. She pulled back the sheets, lifted the pillows and
looked around in general but found<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>nothing. She said whatever it was, it was gone now and I should go back
to bed. I went back to bed and so did she. Several minutes later, it began
again. I tried to ignore it but the bouncing just became heavier and faster
until I was scared out of my wits. I again ran to get my mother. Again she came
to my room. This time she pulled the bedding completely off my bed, threw the
pillows on the floor and beat the mattress with her hands. She got on her knees
and looked under the bed, she looked inside the closet as well as all around
the room. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>"Are you sure you're not just imagining it because
Kathy is gone and you're alone?"</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I assured her I was not imagining it and after remaking my
bed she turned out the light and told me to go to sleep and not to awaken her
again that night.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I was so scared I just lay on my stomach with my face buried
in my pillow for a long time. Just as I started to believe nothing more would
happen, it started again. Remembering my mother's stern warning I just lay
there shaking as the bouncing went from light tapping to violent banging,
rocking the whole bed. Suddenly, it stopped. I lay there, afraid to move,
waiting for it to start again. Then I felt something tap me firmly on my back.
I jumped and turned my face to see who was there. The full moon was
illuminating the room well enough for me to see that no one was there. The next
thing I knew something slapped me so hard across the cheek that it stung. This
time I got up and ran screaming hysterically to my mother's room. I told her
what happened and she took me into the living room, turned on the light and saw
the large red welt on my left cheek. This is when she first explained to me
about "things that go bump in the night". She gave me a rosary to
hold in my hand and we went to my room and prayed for a few minutes. I went to
sleep and nothing more happened........that night.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I have had many, many supernatural experiences since that
night but none has scared me quite as badly as that one. Thanks, Carolyn</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My Attraction to Haunted Places</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: flamingice86@hotmail.com</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Some of my friends often joke that I'm attracted to haunted
places; I dissagree. I never go out of my way to go somewhere just because it's
hanuted. Usually, I've been to the place several times before I learn that it
is or may be hanuted. There are really only two hanuted places that I go to
frequently, neither of which are frightening places.The first is my aunt and
uncle's house. They live there with their two daughters. When I was
younger(around 7 or 8), before I heard my aunt mention that the house might be
haunted, I was staying there overnight. Most of the activity seems to happen in
the bathroom, one bedroom, and the living room. I happened to be sleeping in
the living room. It was very late at night, and I woke up to the sound of
voices. They were incredibly faint and sort of blurry. I could almost tell what
they were saying, but the most I could ever catch at one time was part of a word.
My first thought was that someone was still up and talking to someone else. I
walked through the house a little, but everyone was alseep. I went and found my
dad, woke him up, and told im that people were talking and that they were
keping me up. He got up and looked around the house to see if anyone was
talking inside, then looked around outside in case someone was outside on the
sidewalk in front of their house. He couldn't find anybody. I asked him if he
could hear the voices too. he was quiet for a few minutes, then said that he
could sort of hear a few voices talking, but that he couldn't tell what they
were saying. He told me to try and go ack to sleep, then left. I got back in
bed, fell asleep, and didn't give the night a second thought until many years
later. Their older daughter was telling me about how she, her sister, and her
mom were starting to think that the house might be haunted. She mentioned a few
minor incidents, then told me that at her last nirthday party(a sleep-over),
her friends mentioned to her that they had heard voices talking from the living
room all night. At this time, nobody had told the friends about the suspicion
that the house was hanuted. They thought that my aunt and uncle had been
talking in the living room, but later when my cousin asked, they told her they
had gone to bed at the same time the girls had. A little while later, it dawned
on me that what I experienced so many years ago with the voices in the living
room could have been a paranormal experience. I told them about it, and they
agreed that the voices I heard were just like the ones my cousin's friends had
heard.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>About a year ago, I think my house might have become the
temporary residence of a poltergeist. I'm in my mid teens now, so I would have
been the perfect age for attracting one at the time. The incidents were very
minor. It started out as footsteps from upstairs. The floors in my house are
very old,a nd they creak and squeek when you step in certain places, and I've
learned to identify who was walking where in the house by listening to their
footsteps and the accompanying creaks. The footsteps I heard were different
than everyone in my family's. They never seemed scary or intimidating, just
unfamiliar. They were always in the same place. The upstairs hallway and the
very top of the stairs. I heard them while I was in the bedrooms at the endof
the hallway, and when I was downstairs. They would always take a few steps,
then stop. This happened every three or four days for a few weeks. After a
while, the poltergeist extended it's territory to our kitchen. The only thing
it did in the kitchen was open and close the cabinet doors. I've checked the
kitchen for drafts, or anything else that would cause te cabinet doors to move,
but couldn't find anything. It was never a problem, other than when my mom
would blame me for leaving the cabinet doors open when I knew I had closed
them. Once or twice I would walk into the kitchen just as a cabinet door was
opening or closing. After about two months, the poltergeist moved on. Nothing
has happened like that since. I mentioned the incidents a few times to my
parents(who didn't believe me, of course), but since they only happened when I
was alone and weren't particularly frightening, I never mentioned them to
anyone else.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>As a studying actor,
I spend quite a bit of time at my community theatre. That theatre is known in
the local acting community by its ghost, Francis. Many, many years ago, a woman
named Francis fell to her death from the catwalk while working on some of the
backdrops. Almost immediately after, small incidents began occuring. People
heard whispers and groans behind them when they were alone in a room. This
happened to me twice, the first time when I was looking for cleaning supplies
during the strike of a show. I was leaning down to look under a counter, and I
heard someone whisper something in my right ear. I looked behind me quickly,
but nobody was there(plus, if anyone in the building had wanted to scare me,
they wouldn't have kept it to a whisper. They would have screamed bloody murder
in the hopes of inducing a heart attack.). A few years later, I was sitting in
the green room while everyone else was still working on costumes and makeup. I
heard a loud, deep groan come from one corner of the room. It wasn't a bad
groan, like a groan of pain. It was more like the way one might groan if they
were woken up by someone banging two pots together a few inches away from their
head. My friends and I also discovered that Francis is particularly interested
in the technicians. While teching a show(apperating spotlights), I myself, as
well as other members of the lighting crew had the doors to our lighting booths
either opened, or pulled on. In one incident, I was talking with the crew over
our headsets when I heard one of them call to someone else "What do you
ned?" There were a few seconds of silence, then they both screamed. I
asked them what was wrong, and after a moment, one of them explained that the
door to their booth had started to open. They thought it was the Crew Chief and
asked what he needed. When the door opened the rest of the way, nobody was
there. At the same time, the blades of a small fan in the room started turning.
They made one or two rotations, then stopped. Upon further investigation, they
discovered that the fan wasn't even plugged in. I have never been seriously
afraid of Francis or what she might do, though she has shown that she can be
rather fierce when people doubt her existence. She broke the ropes on one of
the lifts and the actor who was on the lift fell to the stage. He was only a
few feet above the stage floor, so he was perfectly fine(he actually started
laughing before shouting that he was okay), but we were still pretty stunned by
the fact that the ropes broke the second after someone shouted "Francis
doesn't exist!"</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I have been looking around on your site for awhile, mainly
trying to help myself understand something that happened a few years back, I
have decided to submit my story, in hopes that perhaps someone else has had the
same experience.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>In the first week of May 2005, I was in Germany with my
mother, specifically in a small town in Munich (Muchen) Germany. The small town
is called Furstenteldbruck. We were staying at a hotel, one which we had stayed
at before, it is a family run hotel, on ground and buildings which have been in
the family for over 500 years. Oddly enough though, I don't believe that the
ghost I saw had anything to do with the property buildings or ground... it felt
like he did not belong there.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>It was early in the morning 2-3 am'ish and I was sleeping
beside my mother, when I suddenly woke up... admittedly I felt the urge to go
to the bathroom, but the second I opened my eyes, I froze, everything froze, my
heart, breathing everything, I was literally paralyzed with fear. This was
because over in a dark corner, I saw the outline of a man, he was all dark,
(the image), and warning a suite with a hat of some sort, the lines of the
suite I could clearly see, but not those of the hat... I could not see his
face, but I was also horrified to look at it, afraid that he may look up at me.
For although his body was partially pointing at me, he was in Ernest staring at
my mother... I cannot explain why, but I was extremely afraid.... not for me,
but for my mother, somehow I felt extremely fearful for her... I laid awake
staring at the man, frightened to death he would look at me, or move towards
me... eventually I fell asleep. I did not tell my mother about the man, I
didn't tell anyone. Somehow I felt that I knew the man, the suit the body size,
everything looked like a old photograph that I have seen of my grandfather, a
man who died before I was born, when my mother was only 9 years old.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I did not think of the incident again, truth be told, just
telling it, or even writ ting it, sends shivers up my spin, and gives me
extreme goosebumps, like standing on a ledge. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Then in October of the same year (October 19th to be exact,
3 days after my brother's 21st birthday) my mother suddenly became gravely ill,
collapsing twice, she was taken away in the ambulance, the last time I ever saw
her alive, for she died 8 hours later in the hospital, it took 16month for the
coroners report, but my mother died of a blood clot, which had begun in her
right leg and traveled up, breaking up into 1 med and 5 smaller clots,
eventually blocking the arteries to her heart, causing her heart to stop. At
that exact time she died, my father had just arrived back to the hospital with
an overnight bag which I had packed for her. She was in the ICU and my father
had to call in to get into the ICU, when he did, the nurse was talking with
him, and suddenly a code blue rang out... the nurse abruptly hung up on my
father... 15 minutes later, a nurse came out to tell my father that my mother
had just passed away... she had been the code blue, her heart had stopped just
as he arrived.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My dad came home and got my brother and I,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my mother had passed away at 11pm, and we
were there at midnight, I could not huge or touch her for the first 20 minutes,
shock, but also I felt scared, the same type of scared that I did when I saw
the man in the hotel, just to a much lesser degree.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Some people may say I'm crazy, but somehow I think that the
2 incidents are related... I am confused by it to... was that my grandfather...
did he come to warn my mother... to see her... to 'collect her'.... I have no
idea. I have never seen a ghost before in my life, this I guess you could call
more of a extreme shadow... I have left the story alone for a long time, having
told only my fiance, begging him not to ask me any questions, because
discussing is scares me.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I leave it alone, because I am horribly afraid of seeing the
man again... will I see his face... will he be there for me... or for someone
else I love. I have no idea. Someone I feel/know that the two incidents are
related... and I am not sure if I was fearful for my mother because the man was
there for her... or if he was fearful for her...</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>That's my story, one I will not tell again anytime soon,
because I just can't shake the fear that reliving it may bring him back.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I did not see the man again, having stayed at the same
hotel, in the same room in the past May with my fiance.</big></big></p>
