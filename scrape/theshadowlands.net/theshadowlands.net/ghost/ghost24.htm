<P>
<P><B>When my mother was a teenager she lived in a small town.  In order
to</B>
<P><B>get to her friends houses she had to drive on this country road that</B>
<P><B>actually went through a creek bed.  One afternoon on the way to her</B>
<P><B>friends house, they had to wait in a long line of cars for about 20</B>
<P><B>minutes to get through the creek bed.  Apparently they were clearing</B>
<P><B>away an accident that had occured, but by the time they got to the</B>
<P><B>"scene" it had been cleared away.  On her way home that night, just
as</B>
<P><B>she was reaching the creek bed crossing, she heard a loud rapping on
her</B>
<P><B>back window.  It shocked her because it wasn't a rattle, or any other</B>
<P><B>normal car noise, but rather literally like the sound of someone</B>
<P><B>pounding on the car window with their fist.  She put her hand back
to</B>
<P><B>make sure the back window was rolled up and wasn't knocking, and it
was</B>
<P><B>tightly closed. There were no trees low enough to touch her car. 
Just</B>
<P><B>as she passed actually into the creek bed there was  a repeated huge</B>
<P><B>pounding on the back of her window again.  In her own words, she put
the</B>
<P><B>pedal to the metal, and got the heck out of there.  That next day she</B>
<P><B>learned that a girl in her class at her high school had been in that</B>
<P><B>accident they had come upon earlier the day before, and had been</B>
<P><B>decapitated.</B>

<H3><A NAME=angels>My Guardian Angels</A>
</H3><P><B>by Wendy.Womack@bsh.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My great-grandfather has been a part of my family since I was three
years</B>
<P><B>old(1973) and he died. We all feel he is our guardian angel protecting
the four</B>
<P><B>of us. The occurences began right after he died. One night my mother
woke up to</B>
<P><B>hear music from the 20's coming from right above her. She thought it
might be</B>
<P><B>music from a nearby house, but when she stuck her head out the window
all was</B>
<P><B>quiet and when she returned to bed the music was right above her again.
The next</B>
<P><B>incident was three years later. I was six and we lived in FL. One night
I woke</B>
<P><B>up in the middle of the night and went across the house to wake my
mother. I</B>
<P><B>told her I needed to use the bathroom. I insisted that she take me.
She did and</B>
<P><B>when she was putting me back to bed she felt something on the floor.
She turned</B>
<P><B>on the lights and there lying on the floor next to my bed was my
great-</B>
<P><B>grandfathers Spanish American War uniform. She asked me how it got
there and I</B>
<P><B>said I did not know. The next day my dad was convinced that I had
been</B>
<P><B>sleepwalking and put it there myself. They made me try to lift it out
of the</B>
<P><B>hall closet but I was to little. Our only explanation for this is that
my great</B>
<P><B>grandfather put it there and then told me to wake my mother so that
she would</B>
<P><B>see it as well. My father did see him one night in his rear view mirror
while</B>
<P><B>driving down the road. It was a bad time for my parents and my dad
was driving</B>
<P><B>and thinking (they were close to separation). That's when he looked
in the</B>
<P><B>rearview mirror and saw his grandfather. My dad pulled to the side
of the road</B>
<P><B>and looked in the back seat. Nothing there. My dad got a feeling and
turned</B>
<P><B>around and went home. My sister has seen him twice in her room, he
would stand</B>
<P><B>at the doorway and then come closer to her. She would scream and he
would just</B>
<P><B>fade away. My sister has also heard him walking up the stairs and open
the door</B>
<P><B>to her room when she was in another room upstairs and no one else was
home. When</B>
<P><B>my great grandfather was alive my mother would bake him chocolate chip
cookies,</B>
<P><B>he loved them. One day about 10 years after his death she was baking
cookies,</B>
<P><B>but they were oatmeal rasin cookies. It was the middle of the day,
my sister and</B>
<P><B>I were in school and my dad was at work. While she was stirring the
dough she</B>
<P><B>distinctly felt a hand touch her shoulder. She turned around thinking
my dad had</B>
<P><B>come home but no one was there. She concluded that he wanted some chocolate
chip</B>
<P><B>cookies. We've never made anything else since. All these occurences
have</B>
<P><B>happened in different houses, we've moved 13 times and he has followed
us to</B>
<P><B>every place. I personally haven't seen him but I know he's there watching
over</B>
<P><B>us. I also belive that I have another guradian angel. My mother had
a close</B>
<P><B>friend who died of bone cancer and before she died they would talk
of death,</B>
<P><B>angels and the afterlife. I don't know what they talked about exactly
but I have</B>
<P><B>a suspicion that they made some promises to each other and Mrs. Levitt
promised</B>
<P><B>to watch over us. I think this because a few years later I was in a
terrible car</B>
<P><B>accident in which five people were in my car, no one had seat belts
on and the</B>
<P><B>car flipped end over end  three times and landed upsidedown. Not a
single</B>
<P><B>scratch on anyone! That night my mom was putting away her jewlrey for
the night</B>
<P><B>and noticed that Mrs. Levitt's nurse pin (she had given it to my mom
before she</B>
<P><B>died) was missing. My mom searched everywhere but she couldn't find
it. Then she</B>
<P><B>got the call about our accident. The people that witness the accident
thought</B>
<P><B>for sure someone was dead. Tons of ambulences, firetrucks, etc. showed
up but we</B>
<P><B>were all fine. That night when we got home my mom opened her jewlery
box and</B>
<P><B>there back in place was the pin. I think this was a sign from Mrs.
Levitt that</B>
<P><B>she was at work protecting me in the car. I live in New England so
there is a</B>
<P><B>lot of hauntings around. I know many people who live in houses that
are haunted.</B>
<P><B>I find it very fascinating and scary at the same time.</B>

<H3><A NAME=house>My Friend's House</A>
</H3><P><B>by KANDK@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>  I won't use my friends name because I don't know if she wants me</B>
<P><B>to.  This all happened a few years ago.  Since then my friend moved.
 I</B>
<P><B>really don't have any idea why I was so scared.  Let me explaine:</B>
<P><B>     My friend always invited me over to her house all the time.</B>
<P><B>Whenever I went there I always felt an eerie feeling come over me,
as if</B>
<P><B>someone was watching me.  I dismissed that and decided my mind was</B>
<P><B>playing tricks on me.       Well anyway on a perticular night I told
her</B>
<P><B>about the way I felt.  She told me the house was haunted and not to</B>
<P><B>worry cause thi ghost was really gentle.  My friend  always liked to</B>
<P><B>play practical jokes and was good at it so I figured that was what
she</B>
<P><B>was doing.  I always beleived in all that spooky stuff, but I acted</B>
<P><B>skeptical because I thought it was too weird for a friend to have a
real</B>
<P><B>ghost in her home.  </B>
<P><B>     Before we went to bed my friends older sister kept opening the
door</B>
<P><B>and tried to scare us.  So my friend We were sleeping in the same bed</B>
<P><B>and she kept taking the quilts off me.  It was summer so of coures
the</B>
<P><B>fan was blowing in my face.   I was freezing but i didn't want to
wake</B>
<P><B>her so I just sat there.  </B>
<P><B>     Right when I could not stand it any longer the fan suddenly went</B>
<P><B>off and the quilts came over me.  I was to scared to keep my eyes
open</B>
<P><B>so I tightly closed them till i fell asleep.  Even with the quilt
over</B>
<P><B>me I felt a chill on the side of my body.  It was just then I knew
it</B>
<P><B>had to be a ghost because my friend was asleep and the door was still</B>
<P><B>locked.  </B>
<P><B>     The next morning I told this to my friend and she didn't even
act</B>
<P><B>surprised.  See now I know I should not have been scared because the</B>
<P><B>ghost was only trying to help.</B>

<H3><A NAME=suit>The Man in the Suit</A>
</H3><P><B>by Puddin444@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>It's been years since I've had the same incounters with spirits as
I did when I was a child. I guess as we get older we lose our willingness
to believe that we're not alone. I still believe but with more fear than
I did as a child. My spiritual incounters started when I was in 2nd grade.
We had just moved to a new house. I believe that every house has a room that
the spirits reside in, and my room was it. We moved to that house so that
my brother and I could have our own rooms, but I couldn't sleep in that room.
I told everyone it was because he was affraid, but it was me that was affraid.
The first few weeks we lived in the house, I did sleep in my room. One night
I prayed to God that I could see my father that had died when my mom was
6 months pregnant with me. That night I woke up and saw him hovering over
my bed. He didn't say anything out loud, but I knew what he was thinking.
He was very proud of me and that he knew that I was going to do something
very great. After that I wouldn't sleep by myself. I knew that he wasn't
bad, but there was something about that room. Our rooms were side by side,
and at night, I would wake up to hear things coming from my room. All my
things were in my room, and when I wanted something, I would run in and run
out.</B>
<P><B>       As I got older it was kinda wierd to share a room with my brother,
so I decided to buck it up and start sleeping in my room. I was in the fifth
grade at this time. Nothing major happened untill 4 years later. During those
four years, I discovered many wierd things about the room. In my room, I
could hear every creak in the house. And for a relatively new house, that
was very odd to have so many creaks. Things would happen like: the tv would
come on by itself, I would hear things that weren't creaks, etc. These things
were bad at the time but were nothing compared to what happened my ninth
grade year.</B>
<P><B>       After I turned 15, things got really creepy. The noise began
to get louder, and I saw things. One night, I had a friend over. We were
sitting on the bed talking a laughing. Then, we heard this sound coming from
the window. It was like something was scrapping the window. This is really
wierd because the room is on the second floor with no trees around it. Needless
to say, we were scared to death. We didn't want to be in there so we went
to the living room. A few weeks after that, I got the biggest scare of my
life.</B>
<P><B>       Up to this point I had seen ghost and sensed ghosts, but never
up close and personal. One night I was sleeping and woke up. I turned over
to look at my clock, and there was a man in my bed. He startled me, but didn't
scare me. He an older man. He had salt and pepper hair and a gray beard.
He was wearing an old confederate uniform. Not scary at all. I turned over
and tried to ignore it. He finally gave up and left. After that night I sleep
with the light on for a month. Then I realized I wasn't solving anything.
The next day I went into my room and tried to talk to him. I say that I didn't
know what he was doing in my room, but I didn't appreciate being startled
like that. It did the trick. I never saw him again, but I knew he was there.
He told me many things. He warned me about my closet. I had always keep it
open because there was too much stuff to close it. He said that I had to
close it when I slept because the thing in the window that night live there,
and that it was not good. He was always protecting me. When I was planning
something, he would warn me about the bad things that could happen. He saved
me on several occations.</B>
<P><B>    As I got older he began to bother me. I never had a moments peace
without him butting in. I finally got so mad that I yelled at him. I told
him to go away and leave me alone. Boy did it work. I didn't see him for
4 years, and that was recently. I was talking to a friend on a talker. She
was giving me a reading. After the reading we talked about all kinds of stuff.
I told her about him. She said that he was a husband in another life, and
that he thought that we were still married. No wonder he was mad when he
left. Imagine the woman you love and charish telling you to get lost. Well,
after that I did feel him near me once more. He said that he figured out
that he was ghost and went to the other side. We made up, with no hard feeling.
Since then, I haven't felt anything even close to that experience. </B>
<P><B>       Thank you for listening to me ramble. I hope that all your
experiences are all pleasant ones.</B>

<H3><A NAME=girl>Lost Little Girl</A>
</H3><P><B>by bmanrow@trip.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>January of 1995 my family and I moved into a house, the house is 14
yrs.</B>
<P><B>old. It was the second night we were in the house, my husband and I
were</B>
<P><B>watching TV with most of the lights off. Suddenly my says "did you
see</B>
<P><B>that? It was a ghost, coming from the hallway waling in front of the</B>
<P><B>TV". My husband doesn't believe in ghosts or spirits on earth. so I
was</B>
<P><B>so surprised he said what he said. But my husband sat up and stated
he</B>
<P><B>saw a little girl slowly walk in front of the TV. At that time we</B>
<P><B>decided to go to bed. Later that night I had gotten up in the middle
of</B>
<P><B>the night to go to the bathroom. As I went to enter the door of the</B>
<P><B>bathroom something quickly flashed across the doorway making me
suddenly</B>
<P><B>stop and look. But nothing was there. This happened every night I</B>
<P><B>learned to ignore it. But I keep a night lite in the bathroom and
upon</B>
<P><B>entering the bathroom sometimes you can see a shadow of a person</B>
<P><B>standing just in the doorway. I guest we have learned to live with
this</B>
<P><B>we don't talk about it very much anymore and she keeps to herself.</B>

<H3><A NAME=experience>An Experience</A>
</H3><P><B>by ggreaves@carroll.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>The first ghost experience I had began when we first moved into a
nice</B>
<P><B>apartment in New Jersey.  The apartment was small and cute so we never
too</B>
<P><B>suspected that it was haunted.  My sister and I shared the same room
there.</B>
<P><B> We slept on bunks; she slept on the bottom and I slept on top.</B>
<P><B>	I never felt too comfortable in that apartment.  The hairs on my arms
and</B>
<P><B>head would rise suddenly, and a terrible chill would enter the room.
 I</B>
<P><B>didn't mention it to my parents because I felt that they wouldn't believe.
</B>
<P><B>It was funny though since my mother and father had encountered many
ghost</B>
<P><B>experiences.</B>
<P><B>	I remember the night well.  I was sleeping in the top bunk when I
suddenly</B>
<P><B>felt a presence in the room with me(besides my sister).  I ignored
it for a</B>
<P><B>few minutes because I thought it was my imagination.  But for no reason,
I</B>
<P><B>gazed from the top of the bunk to the floor.  Standing in front of
my</B>
<P><B>sister was a small little man wearing either  white or gray suit. 
The man</B>
<P><B>gazed up at me and I saw that he had no eyes.  That freaked me out
so I</B>
<P><B>ducked under the covers and prayed the Hail Mary like my mother taught
me.</B>
<P><B>	I glanced down and noticed the man was gone.  That isn't the only
time</B>
<P><B>that I experienced something super-natural.</B>
<P><B>	I was watching television in the living room.  Both my parents
weren't</B>
<P><B>present.  In the living room, there are two closet doors.  They are</B>
<P><B>different than most closet doors because you have to turn the knob
in order</B>
<P><B>to open it up.  Well, I was busy watching television when through my
side</B>
<P><B>vision, I saw the knob turn and open up wide.  When I glared at it
with my</B>
<P><B>normal vision, the door automatically slammed itself shut.  Terrified
I</B>
<P><B>phoned my mother and begged her if I could come to work with her.</B>
<P><B>	A few months later, my mother was sleeping on the living room couch,
when</B>
<P><B>she awoke to the giggling of children.  She sat up in the couch and
peered</B>
<P><B>into the dark room.  Then she felt a force knock her down and pinned
her</B>
<P><B>shoulders to the couch.  It appeared to have great control over her
mind</B>
<P><B>and mouth because she could not scream out any prayers.  Finally she
spat a</B>
<P><B>prayer out and the force released its grip.</B>
<P><B>	My mother still didn't learn her lesson because a few months after,
she</B>
<P><B>again slept in the living room.  This time she was awaken to the sound
of</B>
<P><B>talking.  In front of her stood two beings.  She wasn't afraid of them,
but</B>
<P><B>the third being brought her fear.  It was standing away from the other
two,</B>
<P><B>behind her was where it stood.  The being was a tall blonde man with
evil</B>
<P><B>eyes.  It controlled her motion by forcing her to remain still.  She
said</B>
<P><B>that it kept trying to come over in front of her, but the other two
ghosts</B>
<P><B>kept it back in its corner.  As the ghost released it's grip when one
of</B>
<P><B>the other ghost came towards it.  It disappeared.</B>
<P><B>	The last experience we had so far was when my sister, Zuleima, saw
the</B>
<P><B>image of a black cat walking around the couch area and close to the
tv. </B>
<P><B>Its fur was standing up.  The cat, she claimed, had yellow eyes.  We
had</B>
<P><B>the house blessed, but I doubt that the ghosts are gone forever.  I
could</B>
<P><B>still feel them sometimes.		</B>

<H3><A NAME=dogs>Who knew Dogs were Ghosts?</A>
</H3><P><B>by bellis@3lefties.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Let me start by saying that I am not a skeptic, or a true believer
but</B>
<P><B>I know what I have seen .......</B>
<P><B>About 30 years ago my great grandmother's house burned to the ground,
</B>
<P><B>everyone made it out of the house but her 3 dogs.</B>
<P><B>I came to live in that house ever since I can remember... And I can</B>
<P><B>still recall everything I have ever seen....While getting up for
school</B>
<P><B>one morning I was in the living room watching morning cartoons, during
a</B>
<P><B>break in the show, I heard a dog wimper....knowing that at that time
we</B>
<P><B>had no dogs, I thought my mom got me a present.....As I got up and</B>
<P><B>started to walk down the hallway I saw two shadows (They looked like</B>
<P><B>puppys) playing...so as I approached the shadows, they stoped playing</B>
<P><B>and watched me approach, when I got about 10 foot away, they</B>
<P><B>dissapeared.  For 13 years I had encountered these spirit dogs, when
my</B>
<P><B>greatgrandmother died , we moved out of the house and it was sold,
If</B>
<P><B>givin the chance I would go back to that house to see If my (Granny)
has</B>
<P><B>finally gotten her dogs back....she would often cry at night after
she</B>
<P><B>would tell me about how they died....so I hope wherever they are all</B>
<P><B>together and happy.......</B>

<H3><A NAME=my>My Experience</A>
</H3><P><B>by cmckee@eaglequest.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>One night I was driving home from my friend's house in Romeo Michigan,
a</B>
<P><B>rural city.  As I approached a traffic light, I saw a car in the</B>
<P><B>distance approaching this same light.  It was coming from my right
side,</B>
<P><B>and appeared to be maybe a half mile to a mile away.  I didn't think</B>
<P><B>anything of it...i just proceeded to go through the light.  As I</B>
<P><B>approached the light, the car was right there, on my right with the</B>
<P><B>headlights in my eyes.  All I remeber is bracing myself becasue I</B>
<P><B>thought I was going to be hit.  Then....nothing.  I was not hit. </B>
<P><B>Nothing happened.  I remember looking back to see if the light was
red,</B>
<P><B>and, being 1 AM , i thought I may have made a mistake.  It ws green
so I</B>
<P><B>was terrified I was almost hit.  As I kept driving I thought of the
car</B>
<P><B>again.  I had my windows open and the radio was off, and I didn;t hear
a</B>
<P><B>sound.  After the light I went through, the road makes a sharp left</B>
<P><B>turn.  If the car had gone straight it would have gone off the road
and</B>
<P><B>hit a tree.  If this car was a mile off and then was right next to
me it</B>
<P><B>must have been going in excess of 100 MPH...yet there was no
squeeling</B>
<P><B>of tires or a crash.  I specifically remember listening for any
sound,</B>
<P><B>yet there was none.  As I looked in the rearview mirror, the car was</B>
<P><B>gone...vanished.  It was not in the ditch or on the road.  It was
just</B>
<P><B>gone.  </B>
<P><B>	I can't explain it.  I should have been broadsided and maybe
seriously</B>
<P><B>injured.  The car was so far off when I saw it and then  suddenly it
was</B>
<P><B>speeding into the passenger door.  Finally, there is no way the
driver</B>
<P><B>could have turned at that high speed to make the turn.  I am starting
to</B>
<P><B>believe that it was some sort of apparition but I am not one to
believe</B>
<P><B>in that kind of thing.  The more I think about it, the more I come
to</B>
<P><B>that conclusion.  How could a car have done that?  There is no
possible</B>
<P><B>way.  </B>
<P><B>	I don't know if anyone has been killed at that intersection.  I have</B>
<P><B>asked my friend, who has lived there for 9 years, and he says he
doesn't</B>
<P><B>remember any.  Maybe someone was speeding and ran off the road and</B>
<P><B>died.  Maybe what I saw was their car. Who knows?</B>

<P><B>friends. my mistake was speaking about it on the phone that night all</B>
<P><B>hell broke loose. the t.v. turned on and off lights flashed a broken
rc</B>
<P><B>car zoomed over the floor in bed i felt someone jump on me. my dreams
</B>
<P><B>where plauged by eyes(i just saw eyes). but i went on with it. we had
a</B>
<P><B>camera at the top of the stairs. a light detector on the landing. and
a </B>
<P><B>audio recorder near the door. at 1:00 am we started the night was calm,
</B>
<P><B>no wind. we stayed in a "safe room" our library. once i went to check
the</B>
<P><B>camera (switch tape focus etc) as i stood therei felt a breeze from
</B>
<P><B>behind me all the sudden it looked like i was looking down into a </B>
<P><B>tornado. papers flew out of the walls and ceiling and spun into the
</B>
<P><B>bottom window. when it was over i checked the bottom of the stairs
only </B>
<P><B>one peice of unexplained parchment was there. in the morning we checked
</B>
<P><B>the tape, nothing. we checked the audio player. 30 minets in to it
there</B>
<P><B>where 7 thumps like foot falls, then 3 minuts later is a series of
rapid </B>
<P><B>taps like popcorn popping. we then checked the house records, the first
</B>
<P><B>owner named GREY died in the house. nothing big has happened since,
but </B>
<P><B>even now as i sit in the library (where i usually sleep) i hear voices
in </B>
<P><B>the halls.</B>
<P>
<P><B>  a delapidated old house is down the street from me. all the kids
say </B>
<P><B>it's haunted but i didn't buy that untill last year. i was out past
way </B>
<P><B>later then i should playing games and stuff with my friend and his
</B>
<P><B>cousins when we passed the haunted house. one of the cousins looked
up</B>
<P><B>at the top window and screemed. we all then saw a headless figure in
the </B>
<P><B>window. it was smokey and it was kind of watching us. then it </B>
<P><B>dissapeared. we came back without the cousins but had some more
friends.</B>
<P><B>this time the figure was hanging and it's head was in the bottom
window.</B>
<P><B>we ran. i looked back to see the shadow of a man in the headlights
of a </B>
<P><B>car but there was no man. the next day we saw something more shocking
</B>
<P><B>then the ghost. all the windows exept the top one was boarded up, but
at </B>
<P><B>night all the windows where opened. a few days later i brought a teacher
</B>
<P><B>of mine who was interested in the ghost to the house. we where
worried</B>
<P><B>about the owner, let's call him mr. b, who woln't let anyone on his
</B>
<P><B>property but doesn't live there. but the teacher just said we'd pretend
</B>
<P><B>we where interested in the house. as we walked up to it we noticed
many </B>
<P><B>dead animals in the yard and one deserted huffy bike(odd isn't it)
we </B>
<P><B>looked in what crackes of the windows we could see and where shocked.
</B>
<P><B>matresses and burnt shudders piled high. along with other things .on
the</B>
<P><B>way out i told the teacher the story again and then i walked home.
the </B>
<P><B>next day when we talked to the teacher again she told us mr. b was
</B>
<P><B>sitting in a parked car writing down every word we said. after school
we </B>
<P><B>saw the shudder on the top window pulled down.</B>

<H3><A NAME=tracks>The Ghost on the Tracks</A>
</H3><P><B>by jshadden@usinternet.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, I have a few things to get off my chest, here. So, I don't know
if</B>
<P><B>they qualify as stories or not. After reading about your experiences,
I</B>
<P><B>would definatly appreciate your opinions.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, first off, I must explain that I am not a ghost-hunting,
die-hard</B>
<P><B>ghost fanatic. However, whenever I read 'true' (As opposed to works
of</B>
<P><B>fiction) ghost tales, I feel an overwhelming sense of dispair and...</B>
<P><B>Claustriphobia...? For lack of a better description. I mean, I
actually</B>
<P><B>tear up! It takes a lot for me to weep usually, however, ghosts seems
to be</B>
<P><B>a sore spot. I have a few minor tales...</B>
<P>
<P><B>My first is when I was 16-17, sitting alone in my room around 2:00AM.
At</B>
<P><B>the time I was highly depressed for some reason long forgotten. I was</B>
<P><B>kneeling beside my bed, actually praying. (I am not very pias, either)
I</B>
<P><B>felt very alone. Anyway, somewhere in the prayer, I asked for a sign
to</B>
<P><B>show me that someone was looking out for me. Just then, the phone rang.
(I</B>
<P><B>nearly jumped through the cieling, I was so startled.) I hesitantly</B>
<P><B>answered the phone, just to hear a hiss at the other end. Later,  I
asked</B>
<P><B>around to see if I could find a friend who may have called me. No one</B>
<P><B>'fessed up. So...?</B>
<P>
<P><B>My second experience was when I was 19. back in 1990. At the time I
was</B>
<P><B>delivering pizzas for Dominos in a small Wisconsin town called Hartland.
In</B>
<P><B>the middle of the town ran a set of railroad tracks. The tracks were
a pain</B>
<P><B>because it cut off a good chunk of the delivery area and we had a 30
minute</B>
<P><B>time limit to get the pizza to the customer. One night, I was running</B>
<P><B>behind on a delivery time. As I approached the tracks, the gate started
to</B>
<P><B>come down, and the warning lights began to flash. I hesitated for a
second,</B>
<P><B>then decided to gun it. After seeing how far the gate had come down,
I hit</B>
<P><B>the brakes hard, with my wheels giving off a noticable squeel.</B>
<P><B>I looked down and started to play with the radio. Just then, I felt
someone</B>
<P><B>was looking at me. I looked up through the windshield to see a guy
standing</B>
<P><B>on the tracks glaring at me. He was about 6'0, 180 lbs. Black/dark
brown</B>
<P><B>hair, parted down the middle.  He was also wearing a satin bar-style</B>
<P><B>jacket. And he looked really pissed off. I thought that they were
testing</B>
<P><B>the railroad tracks (Again) and the guy was upset because I could
have</B>
<P><B>damaged the gate or possibly run him over. I glared back, and I thought
he</B>
<P><B>would go on about his business when I started to mess with my radio
again.</B>
<P><B>Seconds later, I looked back up to see if he was still staring at me.
He</B>
<P><B>wasn't. In fact, he wasn't there at all. There was nowhere he could
have</B>
<P><B>gone, no buildings to hide behind, etc. Moments later, the train went
by...</B>
<P><B>Very unusual.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Normally, I probably would have dismissed it as a trick of my minds
eye,</B>
<P><B>but the one thing that I still see vividly, and that was the look of
sheer</B>
<P><B>irritation on this guys face...</B>
<P><B>Any comments? I would appreciate any input offered.</B>

<H3><A NAME=road>The Man in the Road</A>
</H3><P><B>by EMAH1234@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, first of all this didn't happen to me, it was told to me by my
friend's mother..along with many other strange things that happened to her..
but I found it pretty extraordinary and she pledged her faith on it, so if
you don't mind hearing it second hand, here it is:</B>
<P><B> She, I'll call her Sylvia, was driving her van one night on the highway,
coming home from some visit which had strayed into the wee hours. It was
early early AM and the only other person in the van with her was her baby
daughter, my friend, who was dozing in the car seat. Sylvia was getting pretty
sleepy herself..she wasn't used to driving alone with just the radio to perk
her up and before long she had fallen asleep at the wheel. She woke up with
a sudden jolt and immediately saw that a man with a pitchfork was standing
directly in front of her van. Terrified that she would hit him, and now fully
awake, she hit the brake and squealed to a stop. As soon as the van halted,
she  looked around for the man, but found no one around. In fact, she was
in a desolate country area; nothing and no one was around. However, there
was one site directly in front of her: a tall stone wall. Sylvia realized
that she had barreled off the road and would have plunged into that wall
if it hadn't been for that strange man with the pitchfork. She never figured
out who her saviour was, but I have my notions: the wall he protected her
from was, after all, a wall surrounding an old cemetary.  And there it is,
as she told me.</B>

<H3><A NAME=encounter>My Encounter</A>
</H3><P><B>by atroxell@usit.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>In the winter of 92 in Tennessee I had a strange encounter with</B>
<P><B>something I would have never thought of.My brother and I have always</B>
<P><B>slept on the third floor of the house and we usually hear noises that</B>
<P><B>we've thought we've heard while we've been alone.The day of our
strange</B>
<P><B>noises we heard was when our parents were away.We were upstairs when</B>
<P><B>this strange event happened.We then were startled by a loud crash to
the</B>
<P><B>floor.We grabbed our flashlights then slowly but carefully we
descended</B>
<P><B>the staircase looking all around us for the source of the noise.We
found</B>
<P><B>nothing.We had then moved into the kitchen and looked around but
still</B>
<P><B>nothing to be found.I walked forward then stopped because of a crunch</B>
<P><B>that had sounded from beneath my feet.I backed up and looked down and</B>
<P><B>saw that it was a plate that had been dropped.I looked up at the</B>
<P><B>cabinet  and the door was open.Then after knowing that someone or</B>
<P><B>something had to have done this we then proceeded even more
cautiously</B>
<P><B>than ever before.We were shocked to have found nothing.My brother and
I</B>
<P><B>then heard a faint thumping noise so we turned a complete three-sixty</B>
<P><B>and headed towards the staircase to call mom and dad for help.We then</B>
<P><B>came to the staircase that leads back to our rooms and looked upto
find</B>
<P><B>a toddler bouncing a ball against the wall.The toddler didn't seem
to</B>
<P><B>notice our presence at first.We stared back motionlessly then he</B>
<P><B>suddenly turned his head and glanced at us for no more than ten
seconds</B>
<P><B>and we ran off into the streets and waited there untill our mom and
dad</B>
<P><B>got there.</B>

<H3><A NAME=spooky>Spooky Stories</A>
</H3><P><B>by jason@starpoint.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello I have a few spooky stories to tell you.  All my life I have
been </B>
<P><B>interested in the paranormal.  I think the interest is from my past
</B>
<P><B>experiences with the paranormal. Here are a few true paranormal stories
</B>
<P><B>that will send shivers up your spine.</B>
<P><B>  My first story begins when I was 7 years old. Let me give you some
</B>
<P><B>background first.  I lived with my grandma, mom, and brother in my
</B>
<P><B>grandma and grandpa's retirement home. This was a small house with
two </B>
<P><B>bedrooms, a big living room, and a kitchen and small bathroom. When
you </B>
<P><B>walk in the front door to your left there are the bedrooms side by
side, </B>
<P><B>and the bathroom next to the last bedroom. To the right of the front
door </B>
<P><B>is the living room and kitchen. Wherever you stand in the house you
can </B>
<P><B>see the entire interior. </B>
<P><B> Okay that is all that you'll need to understand the story.  When I
was 7 </B>
<P><B>years old I had insomnia, but it didn't help that I was terrified of
</B>
<P><B>spiders and woke up from bad dreams of spiders crawling all over me.
 </B>
<P><B>Well one ordinary night I woke up from a bad dream as I always did,
and </B>
<P><B>decided to go out in the living room to sit near my dog Skippy. When
I </B>
<P><B>opened up my bedroom door I looked at the living room to find a white
</B>
<P><B>blur in front of the fire place. It was a tall white blur that moved
</B>
<P><B>acrossed the living room as soon as I stepped out into the living room.
I </B>
<P><B>thought I was dreaming still, so I went to the bathroom and when I
came </B>
<P><B>back out the white blur was there again. From then on until I was 14
I </B>
<P><B>saw that white blur.  The blr moved around the tv looking at the pictures
</B>
<P><B>on the wall. There were three pictures one of my mom, brother and I,
one </B>
<P><B>of my grandma, and there was a painting portrait of my grandpa looking
</B>
<P><B>away. During the day when I would look at his portrait it seemed to
be </B>
<P><B>looking back at me. This would happen only when I would look at the
</B>
<P><B>portrait.  No one else in the family noiced it.</B>
<P><B>  When I was a little bit older I was having one of my many talks with
my </B>
<P><B>grandma, and in one of these talks she told me about my grandpa.  She
</B>
<P><B>said he designed and built this house, and a two years after it was
done, </B>
<P><B>and one year after I was born he died in his sleep. He had a brain
tumor </B>
<P><B>for six months. She said granpa got to spend time with my brother whn
he </B>
<P><B>was a baby until he died, but he only got to spend a tiny bit of time
</B>
<P><B>with me. </B>
<P><B>  Perhaps this white blur was him spending time with me.</B>
<P>
<P><B> My next story has to do with my friend Meredith who lived half a mile
</B>
<P><B>down the road from me. She was interested in the paranormal as I was.
</B>
<P><B>When I was 13 and she was 15 we made a ouji board(forgive my spelling).
</B>
<P><B>We used lined paper to make the letters and numbers, and a few candles,
</B>
<P><B>and between us we tried to contact someone from beyond.</B>
<P><B> We contacted a spirit name Jack.  He was very nice and comforting
to </B>
<P><B>talk to. We'd play around with him a little bit asking him weird </B>
<P><B>questions in our heads and he'd answer on the board. One day Jack </B>
<P><B>couldn't be reached, so we tried for a general spirit.  Using general
any </B>
<P><B>spirit talked to us. This one time however we got a  nasty spirit.
At </B>
<P><B>first he talked very nice, but then I made the mistake of asking him
if </B>
<P><B>he was a good or bad spirit and he said bad. Meredith asked him if
he was </B>
<P><B>in the room, and at the same time we both felt a really cold, eerie
</B>
<P><B>feeling. Then we asked him to do something to prove he was in he room
(as </B>
<P><B>if the eerie feeling wasn't enough). He switched the light on and off
and </B>
<P><B>made our candle go out and come back on. He knocked over the lamp on
the </B>
<P><B>dresser, and he pulled my hair and Meredith's hair almost at the same
</B>
<P><B>time. </B>
<P><B>  We were so freaked out we ran out of the room, and ran outside to
her </B>
<P><B>pony that was in the back yard.  As if the pony was going to protect
us.</B>
<P><B>  We went back in after a little bit, and summonded Jack. We wouldn't
</B>
<P><B>asked for anyone but Jack again.</B>
<P><B>  Well I hope you have enjoyed these stories.:)</B>
<P><B>Thank you for letting me tell them.</B>

<H3><A NAME=boarding>The Boarding House</A>
</H3><P><B>by KSChevall@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was living in a bording house in Waterbury, CT.  The house was over
100 years old.  I lived on the second floor, along with another woman, three
men lived in the rooms above us.  the landlady lived on the first floor.
 the basement was the borders kitchen, laundry, and a pool room.</B>
<P><B>I don't know the history of the house, but it was haunted.  </B>
<P><B>My record player switched speeds by itself, things moved around without
anyone touching them, and doors would open and close by themselves.  You
could hear the sounds of the pool table even when no one was playing, the
smell of cigars was always present (the landlady didn't allow smoking inside)
and the dog refused to go into that room .</B>
<P><B>The scariest thing  that happened, though,  was the time I was sitting
in the basement alone, when something pulled my hair.  (My hair was cut very
short at that time)   </B>
<P><B>I lived in the house for about a year, and the occurences kept up for
the entire year.</B>

<H3><A NAME=haunted>Haunted House</A>
</H3><P><B>by danspks@concentric.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>My story is still hard for me to really believe. I guess I just keep</B>
<P><B>trying to believe that it really didn't happen but it did.  It all
began</B>
<P><B>back in 1989 when I moved in with my husband.  It was a very old
house</B>
<P><B>and the prior owner died on the front porch . Things didn't start</B>
<P><B>happening with me until about two weeks after I had moved into the</B>
<P><B>house. My husband was working the night shifts and I was left there
at</B>
<P><B>the house alone(so I thought). The first time I noticed the strange</B>
<P><B>occurances I was in the living room watching tv. The light turned off.
I</B>
<P><B>went to turn it back on and the switch was in the off position. I</B>
<P><B>flipped it back on and went back to watch tv and a few minutes went
by</B>
<P><B>and the light went off again.  I went to check and sure enough the</B>
<P><B>switch was in the off position.  I called my husband and he told me
the</B>
<P><B>house is haunted. He told me the man that died there was the unseen</B>
<P><B>presence in the house. on more than one occassion doors would open
by</B>
<P><B>themselves and one night My husband and I were laying in the bed and
our</B>
<P><B>bedroom door slammed open. We know our daughter didn't do it because
she</B>
<P><B>was asleep.  The most frequent thing that happen almost every day is</B>
<P><B>that our toilet seat in the bathroom was lifted and closed and on and</B>
<P><B>on.  One night my best friend stayed over and slept in the living
room</B>
<P><B>and my daughter little toy car had a button to push and listen to</B>
<P><B>music.  Well the batteries were out of it and the music in the toy
car</B>
<P><B>keep being played. She never wanted to stay there again after that.
We</B>
<P><B>could also hear heavy footsteps in the den and in the attic(not
mice).</B>
<P><B>One time my husband was walking from the porch and down the sidewalk
and</B>
<P><B>he saw the dead man out of the corner of his eye and when he turn his</B>
<P><B>head the man was gone.  There was one thing that drove me out of the</B>
<P><B>house for two weeks because I was so scared. I was in the extra room
and</B>
<P><B>their was a box I took out of the closet and set it on the floor and
I</B>
<P><B>thought I say it move across the floor. I still doubt things,
thinking</B>
<P><B>that its all in my mind but when other people in the house have</B>
<P><B>experienced these events its hard to do that.  We have moved out of
that</B>
<P><B>house and another family moved into that house and they said that
they</B>
<P><B>were not experiencing any thing strange so my husband thinks the</B>
<P><B>presence may have followed us or maybe just moved on. We do hear some</B>
<P><B>noises in the house we are in now but nothing like when we were at
the</B>
<P><B>other place.</B>

<P><B>isn't to packed with ghosts, but it was pretty scary for me...</B>
<P>
<P><B>	At night right before I go to bed, I close my door to block out the</B>
<P><B>light from the hallway and the noise from the other rooms.  The way
my</B>
<P><B>room is setup, my bed lies perpendicular to the doorway, with my head</B>
<P><B>resting right in view with the door. </B>
<P><B>	One night, it was a normal night to me, I distinctively remember</B>
<P><B>closing my door, and then I went to go sleep and was out of it in
five</B>
<P><B>minutes.  Halfway through the night, maybe around four or five in the</B>
<P><B>morning (more like five, because I remember seeing signs of light
from</B>
<P><B>outside) I suddenly woke up from my sleep for no reason at all.  When</B>
<P><B>this outburst happened I also realized that my heart was pounding</B>
<P><B>extremely fast, and that my ears were ringing loudly.  I knew
something</B>
<P><B>was wrong, but I wasn't sure what.  I directed my attention to the</B>
<P><B>doorway, and I saw my door was open.  Even worse, standing in the</B>
<P><B>doorway was an old woman in a nightgown, and no old woman was staying
at</B>
<P><B>my house that night.  </B>
<P><B>	Immediately I turned my head and closed my eyes, to frightened to
look,</B>
<P><B>and I kept my head away from the door for a long time.  Eventually
the</B>
<P><B>pounding of my heart and the ringing wore off, and I dozed into sleep.
</B>
<P><B>This happening was so vivid that it had to either be true or a very</B>
<P><B>realistic dream.  If it was a dream there was one thing left</B>
<P><B>unexplained...when I woke up in the morning my door was wide open.</B>

<H3><A NAME=small>The Small Dog</A>
</H3><P><B>by hillbsh@ihug.co.nz </B>
<P>
<P><B>I remember once when I was only about five years old and I was in
bed.</B>
<P><B>I'm not sure if I had been asleep or not but I suddenly heard this</B>
<P><B>howling noise across the small room.  I sat up in bed and looked over
to</B>
<P><B>the large window where in front of the window was an old 19th century</B>
<P><B>chair.  Sitting on top of the chair was a small dog, staring at me
and</B>
<P><B>howling.  I could see this clearly as the moonlight spilled through
the</B>
<P><B>window.   At first I could only stare, as we did not have any pets
at</B>
<P><B>all. I also thought that somehow this dog had made it's way into my
room</B>
<P><B>from the street or something.  Though I did not know how as my
bedroom</B>
<P><B>window was closed.   I managed to jump out of bed and run into the</B>
<P><B>lounge where my parents were watching television.  My mother followed
me</B>
<P><B>back into the room and switched on the light, but no small dog.  I
don't</B>
<P><B>remember what happened after that but my mother has said since that
she</B>
<P><B>felt there was something strange about the house, we had moved years</B>
<P><B>ago.</B>

<H3><A NAME=events>Strange Events</A>
</H3><P><B>by hans.wennberg@communique.se</B>
<P>
<P><B>All my life, strange things have happened around me. Many </B>
<P><B>unexplainable events have occurred, of which some are still
unresolved.</B>
<P><B>One of the scariest things that ever happened to me, took place in
1995. </B>
<P><B>I was alone in my office at City Hall. The time was about 3.15 P.M.
</B>
<P><B>I had just finished a telephone call and turned around in my chair
to get</B>
<P><B> a file from my filing cabinet behind me. </B>
<P><B>When I turned back again and faced the desk, my heart </B>
<P><B>almost exploded. I began to tremble with fear. </B>
<P><B>I had a small notepad on my desk to be used for scribbling while </B>
<P><B>on the phone. The pad had been absolutely empty when I put </B>
<P><B>the phone down. Now the pad was filled with strange symbols </B>
<P><B>and arrows - scribbled down by somebody (something) invisible. </B>
<P><B>Needless to say I couldn't stay in my office. I went out into </B>
<P><B>the corridor and almost ran down to the cafeteria for a HUGE cup of
coffee.</B>
<P><B>I showed the pad to a friend of mine who has very special </B>
<P><B>"gifts". She took a look at the symbols and frowned. Then she </B>
<P><B>looked at me and said:</B>
<P><B>"Whoever did this has a lot of power." This is a description of a </B>
<P><B>car crash. Two cars are involved. But I can't tell who is involved
</B>
<P><B>or if this has happened yet, or if it is a thing from the past."</B>
<P><B>This really scared the %&amp;&amp;# out of me. Since then this has
</B>
<P><B>happened twice to me. Has anyone experienced this? What is going on?

<H3><A NAME=gnomish>Gnomish Apparition</A>
</H3><P><B>by shayne@atl.mindspring.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My husband and I were walking in a very old garden.  It is off one
of </B>
<P><B>Atlanta's main drags and is public though no one is supposed to be
in it</B>
<P><B>at night. It is maintained by a trust, from it's creator.  There are</B>
<P><B>some ancient trees there, the land has never been clear cut.  I was</B>
<P><B>walking a little ahead of my husband. My eye was caught by a shining</B>
<P><B>greenlight in a myrtle tree.  I went closer to investigate it.  It</B>
<P><B>wasn't a lightning bug...it looked like a Huge dew drop--about the
size</B>
<P><B>of a quater.  It shone with a neon emerald green light.  I tried to</B>
<P><B>figure out what light it was reflecting.  Just then across a narrow</B>
<P><B>creek whose banks had been walled with grey rock and the water ran
at</B>
<P><B>the botom about 6 feet down--not something I would want to jump
across</B>
<P><B>in the dark--I saw the air get dark and busy.  I can't think of any</B>
<P><B>other way to describe this, something knit itself together right in</B>
<P><B>front of my eyes, very very fast.  It was a little gnome or troll man.
</B>
<P><B>It was in a laurel bush not 4 feet from me.  It had gnarled features
and</B>
<P><B>a long nose and scraggly white hair.  it wore a vest and a slouchy
hat</B>
<P><B>of some rusty color.  It did not move in any way..it didn't appear</B>
<P><B>alive.  I don't know how I could see it so well in the dark, it must</B>
<P><B>have happened very fast because my husband was only a few feet behind
me</B>
<P><B>and he hadn't caught up with me when I stopped at the neon dew-drop.
 I</B>
<P><B>was terrified beyond reason. I screamed and ran for the car yelling
that</B>
<P><B>we had to get out of there, my husband ran with me, because it was
night</B>
<P><B>in a woody part of a big city after all.  He saw nothing.  I have
always</B>
<P><B>regretted the fact that I was too panicked to stay and see what
happened</B>
<P><B>or to try to speak to this gnome.  I was terrified.  I can't figure
out</B>
<P><B>if I sensed evil from the apparition or if the whoe thing was too
much</B>
<P><B>for my Judeo-Christian upbringing as I laughingly tell those I tell
this</B>
<P><B>story to.  Other people I have know have said they saw things and I</B>
<P><B>onced lived in an apartment that a murder had been commited in and
that</B>
<P><B>people tended to rent and leave and other friends said they heard and</B>
<P><B>saw things--but although a couple of odd things have happened to me
this</B>
<P><B>is the only time I ever saw anything.</B>

<H3><A NAME=ghost>The Ghost Encounter</A>
</H3><P><B>by happyday@erols.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>one day,when i was 7 i went to my cousin's house.  my great grandfather
</B>
<P><B>was in world war II and so they had alot of pics in the house of him.
my </B>
<P><B>great grandfather died and my cousin says him and his friends come
back </B>
<P><B>and haunt the house.  he said he heard a knocking pattern repeating
</B>
<P><B>itself over and over.  i always thought that he just wanted to scare
me </B>
<P><B>because he is 4 years older than me so i never believed him.  then
one </B>
<P><B>night i came over for the weekend to spend soome time with them before
</B>
<P><B>they left to go to california.  my cousin told me the same story and
i </B>
<P><B>still didn't believe him until i encounter it for myself.  i fell asleep
</B>
<P><B>and then i awoke to a strange knocking sound.  i t6hought it was my
</B>
<P><B>cousin trying to scare me but it wasent because she was sleeping right
</B>
<P><B>next to me.  then she woke up and heard the knocking too!  we both
clung </B>
<P><B>on to eachother in fright.  then we saw this misty transparent figure
</B>
<P><B>dressed in an old military outfit with a gun.  the figure then said"hey
</B>
<P><B>how are you?remember "never lose your hope!!" i was so scared to say
</B>
<P><B>anything that when a little sound came out,the figure vanished.  then
we </B>
<P><B>tried to sleep.  the next morning i talked to my cousin and asked about
</B>
<P><B>the night before and if she could remember anything.  she said "what
are </B>
<P><B>you talking about?are you going wacko?" i then thought that this </B>
<P><B>encounter i had was a dream,until i walked to the picture.  i looked
</B>
<P><B>underneath the pic and saw the quote"never lose your hope!!" as i can
</B>
<P><B>remember, the pic didn't have any writing under it.  i was so scared
so </B>
<P><B>i believe that my great grandfather came back to talk to me!!</B>

<H3><A NAME=files>A Story for the Files</A>
</H3><P><B>by Bast29@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now that I've been reading some of the stories, I look back now and
feel that something that happened to me about 20 years ago, did have something
of the supernatural about it.  It scared me then, but when you're 16 years
old, you've got so much going on in your life that it's easy to dismiss certain
things.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The year was 1976, and my mother and I had moved into a house across
the street from my grandmother.  My mother and I had lived with my grandmother
until I was 11 years old, so I was pretty familiar with the neighbors.  The
house we lived in used to belong to an older couple, I used to remember when
their granddaughter Shelly would come to visit.  The older man passed away,
and lady owner moved out and decided to rent it.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>The house wasn't really that old, maybe 25-30 years old.  It was totally
fenced by a chain link fence, and had no bushes or trees in  the whole yard,
so basically if you looked out any of the windows you had a clear view of
that side of the yard, and into the neighbor's yard.  The house had a crawl
space underneath the entire house that raised it about 3 feet off the ground,
so anyone trying to look into a window from the outside would have to stand
on tippy toes to look.  The entire house had wood parquet floors, which means
that you could hear and feel when anyone walked around inside of it.  I'm
explaining all of this, because it's all part of the story I'm going to
relate.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Part of this happened during the summertime, and then into the school
year.  During the summer, I was dating a guy who lived a little bit far away,
which meant we talked alot on the phone, and since he was working as a busboy
at a restaurant which closed around 1am, we would sometimes talk into the
wee hours.  Now there were 2 phone connections.  One in my mother's room,
and one in the kitchen.  I would take the kitchen phone and stretch it around
the corner and either lie down in the hallway or sit on the kitchen floor.
 I would only leave the hallway light on.   Since we were on a tight budget,
we wouldn't run the a/c which meant I could hear everything going on outside.
 </B>
<P>
<P><B>I would be talking to him, and then suddenly I would hear the entry
gate rattle, and at first I attributed it to a cat jumping the fence over,
but then soon afterwards I would hear footsteps in the grass around the house.
 I would be petrified, and tell my boyfriend, "There's someone walking around
my house (note this was around 2 or 3am, which made it really scary)."  At
that point I was thinking of ghosts, but of a burglar.  One time I got so
scared that I went running down the hallway and jumped into my mother's bed,
and woke her up, telling her that someone was in the yard.  We turned off
the lights, and looked through the windows, and never saw anyone.  Now remember
this yard has no bushes or trees, it was clear lawn.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Another time I was writing at my desk in my room, and it was around
1am, and my desk was right under a window which overlooked the back yard.
 I had a little desk lamp on writing away, when all of a sudden I hear footsteps
purposely walking straight up to my window.  I froze, I was about 18 inches
from the window and I was so scared of looking up and seeing something at
the window.  I suddenly jumped up, knocked over the chair, and literally
flew around the corner into my mother's room, jumping on her bed, screaming
there was someone in the yard.  We investigated, and again no sign of anyone.
Now these were human footsteps, if it would have been a cat, it would have
weighed at least 50 pounds, and we didn't own a dog.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The school year started, and my mother would leave for work before
I did for school, and she always told me that if I decided to stay home to
let my grandmother know I was there.  One morning I had woken up not feeling
too good, and decided to stay home.  I remember I was awake, just lying there
with my eyes closed.  I heard noises in the kitchen, which was toward the
front of the house, but this didn't alarm me, since my grandmother had a
key to our house, and I thought it was her that came to get something she
needed.  Then I feel (through the vibration of the flooring), someone is
walking down the hallway to my room.  Now this is the funny part, because
even though in my conscious mind I'm thinking it's my grandmother, in my
inner mind I'm imagining a man, older and taller, which reminds me of my
grandfather (which had passed away).  This 'person' stops at the door, looks
at me then comes and pulls the blanket up to my shoulder in a very loving
manner.  Now all this time I'm not scared thinking it's my grandmother. 
Later that day when my mother went to see my grandmother, she's calls me
angrily on the phone, asking why I had not told my grandmother I was in the
house, and I'm telling my mother that my grandmother had known all along
since she had been in the house during the morning and even covered me up.
 My grandmother swore she had never been in the house that day.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One of the last items, was one night my grandmother calls us around
3am, and asks my mother to check if I was in bed.  It just so happens I was
sleeping with my mom that night, and she tells my grandmother that I was
there next to her.  My grandmother said she had me knock on her door (a certain
way I did), and call out her name.  She had gotten up, and of course no one
was there, so that's why she had called.  Another mystery.  We moved after
only living there 2 years, and I never had a similar experience again.</B>

<H3><A NAME=born>Born on Another's Death Day</A>
</H3><P><B>by nestor@itecnmi.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Here is a true story that I would like to share with all of you. </B>
<P><B>It is a story that made me believe that spirits really come back when
</B>
<P><B>they have some unfinished business. This is how it goes:</B>
<P><B>	I was born on the 8th of April in the year 1980. I was born on an
</B>
<P><B>island called Guam, but I reside on an island called Saipan, which
is </B>
<P><B>about thirty minutes from Guam by plane.</B>
<P><B>	The day that I was born, my grandmother died. But, my parents had
</B>
<P><B>no idea that she did. Because back then, we did not have a telephone.
</B>
<P><B>Anyway, one quiet night, I was alone at home with my mother; I was
two </B>
<P><B>weeks old. My father and older sister had gone out to buy me some pampers
</B>
<P><B>(I was a messy little baby!)and some milk. </B>
<P><B>	My mother went out of the room that we were in, shutting the door
</B>
<P><B>behind her. She went to use the bathroom. Not even two minutes later,
she </B>
<P><B>came back and the door that she shut, was ajar. </B>
<P><B>	She crept in quietly, and to her suprise, she saw an apparition </B>
<P><B>of an old woman with long hair, dressed ina long, flowing white dress.
</B>
<P><B>She gasped in amazement and in fear. After loking at the "ghost" for
</B>
<P><B>a few seconds, she realized that it resembled my grandmother.</B>
<P><B>	So, my mother said, " Nana (mother in spanish), please don't hurt
</B>
<P><B>my baby. She's your granddaughter. Please, put her down." </B>
<P><B>	After a few minutes, my levitated little body began to gently </B>
<P><B>fall back onto the bed. The funny thing was that I wasn't crying, I
was </B>
<P><B>laughing. </B>
<P><B>	After being "laid" back onto the bed, my grandmother </B>
<P><B>dissappeared. And, all was normal again. At first my mother didn't
</B>
<P><B>understand why what just happened, happened.</B>
<P><B>	When my father got home, she told him what had happened and my </B>
<P><B>father looked at her in amazement and said, "I just got a letter from
</B>
<P><B>dad, mom just died two weeks ago."</B>
<P><B>	Horrified, my mother asked, "When, exactly?"</B>
<P><B>	My father replied, "April 8, 1980."</B>

<H3><A NAME=animals>Animals</A>
</H3><P><B>by Xia1849@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was just reading some of the stories on your web page.  I don't think
my stories are all that exciting, but I have lived with spirits all of my
life.  I can't imagine not having them around all the time.  </B>
<P><B>Yes, I do believe that animals are ghosts or spirits, too.  All of
my animals have "visited" after death.  The first one I remeber was a french
poodle named Jeffie (short for Jeffrey Jones).  He was hit by a car and died
very quickly.  I was numb that night at his loss, but started crying after
listening to my brother's tears.  Shortly after taht I heard his tags jingling
together and his toe nails on the kitchen floor.  I would feel his fur as
he brushed up against me.  That went on for about two weeks and was a great
comfort to me.</B>
<P><B>My next dog was a weimereiner-doberman cross.  We were very close.
  We shared life for 14 years.  I felt her leave this plain.  I feel that
she is with my father running in the woods and going for walks - some of
the things they did together in this life.  They were very good friends.
 She still comes to visit from time to time.  When she was still alive, I
did some traveling.  It was not unusual to see her curled up in the corner
of the hotel room I was in.  It was comforting to both of us.</B>
<P><B>Bruno, a large german shepard who lived with me for 8 months, also
cmae to visit after death.  I think he came to let me know he was ok.  I
feel that he is with someone else who is greatly missing him.  Bruno had
been abandoned in a kennel I used.  The kennel owner gave him to me as I
had to put another dog down.  Bruno was a true gentle giant.  </B>
<P><B>That's all for now.</B>
