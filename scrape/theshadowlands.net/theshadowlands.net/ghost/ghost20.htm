<P><B>Hi my name is Denise. I have been dating Alex for 2 years now. His
dad</B>
<P><B>never got along with me ever since day one. Every time i would go over
to</B>
<P><B>his house dad would pick a fight with me. Well Alex and I got engaged
last</B>
<P><B>April. His dad started to go down hill with his heart troubles,and
even</B>
<P><B>when he was sitting in his chair sick he still managed to stab me with
a</B>
<P><B>rude comment. He has had heart attacks since 1979, and he was kind
of a man</B>
<P><B>that liked to be sick for all the attention. So even when he wasn't
sick he</B>
<P><B>still played on it and his children really didn't believe him all the
time.</B>
<P><B>One night i was laying in bed. When i looked up and saw a tall dark
figure.</B>
<P><B>It was darker then the darkness of the room. He was wearing a long
trench</B>
<P><B>coat and a hat. He had a long beard and mustache. He just looked down
on me</B>
<P><B>and then within seconds he was gone. I told my parents and Alex about
this</B>
<P><B>but it was kind of shrugged off. </B>
<P><B>A week later Alex's dad was up in the Guelph General Hospital with
a heart</B>
<P><B>attack. He was admitted to the ICU, Alex and I went up and there was
no one</B>
<P><B>there. He was hooked up to a ton of machines and the colour of him
was</B>
<P><B>pale. The nurse said that he might not make it through the night.
Right</B>
<P><B>away I started calling his family starting with his wife that was ready
to</B>
<P><B>go to bed and she said "But i am going up to see him in the morning!"
Well</B>
<P><B>i told her to get up here fast. Then i called his other 7 children
to</B>
<P><B>gather together because no one should die alone. </B>
<P><B>He was still holding on till the next day,all of his family was around
him</B>
<P><B>and he told me not to leave and to hold his hand. I never left his
side and</B>
<P><B>he said "Im surrounded by love." Then he passed away.</B>
<P><B>Two days later i was sitting on the couch watching tv. When i felt
a shiver</B>
<P><B>go down my spine. I then remembered what happened that night when a
man</B>
<P><B>came to my side. I believe i had a duty to do and that man was my</B>
<P><B>messenger. My duty was to pull the family together so he wouldn't die</B>
<P><B>alone,and I made peace with his dad the day he died when he told me
to hold</B>
<P><B>his hand and stay with him. I now believe that i have a guardian
angel</B>
<P><B>looking after me from above. </B>

<H3><A NAME=word>Incarnate Word University</A>
</H3><P><B>by jt029323@tamiu.edu </B>
<P>
<P><B>Let me introduce myself first. Im a graduate student at Texas
A&amp;M</B>
<P><B>International in Laredo Texas. Im going for my Masters degree in</B>
<P><B>Psychological counseling and this is my first year in the Grad. Program.
My</B>
<P><B>sister, the one who told me all these cool ghost stories, graduated
last May</B>
<P><B>from Incarnate Word University in San Antonio. </B>
<P><B>About Incarnate Word. The University was founded by the Sisters of
the order</B>
<P><B>of the "Incarnate Word", hence the name. The campus is composed of
the main</B>
<P><B>building, which is over a hundred years old, and much newer buildings
that</B>
<P><B>contain the dorms, rec. center, cafateria, etc.  The main building,
is four</B>
<P><B>stories high and contains the administration offices on the first
floor,</B>
<P><B>dorms in second, third and fourth floors, and the basement houses the</B>
<P><B>student laundry room, the mail room and a small recreation room.
Hardly</B>
<P><B>anybody uses the facilities in the basement though. Why? Because
that's</B>
<P><B>where the creepy stuff happens mostly, especially at night. On the
third</B>
<P><B>floor, in addition to dorms, there's a small chapel where students
go to</B>
<P><B>pray on their own time or attend the services offered on Sundays. Alot
of</B>
<P><B>the nuns have their rooms in the main building also. There's this one
room,</B>
<P><B>though, that has been nailed shut for decades. Over fifty years ago,
a nun</B>
<P><B>committed suicide by hanging herself in that room. After the incident,
the</B>
<P><B>priests blessed the room, left all her belongings like they found them
and</B>
<P><B>nailed the door shut. Students have been reporting ghost sightings
and other</B>
<P><B>things ever since. My sister got there in the Fall of '93. Her first
dorm</B>
<P><B>room was on the third floor of the main building. In fact, all new
students</B>
<P><B>that need dorms have to live in the main building. The newer,
surrounding</B>
<P><B>buildings are for Juniors and Seniors. One of her first friends at
the</B>
<P><B>school was this girl named Carolina. Carolina was from Spain and was
a</B>
<P><B>sophomore when my sister got there. She was also a "resident assistant".
A</B>
<P><B>resident assistant is a student who is assigned to a certain floor
and is in</B>
<P><B>charge of attending to whatever the students need as far as their dorms
are</B>
<P><B>concerned. </B>
<P><B>One night, Carolina had just done her nightly round and was ready to
go to</B>
<P><B>bed when two female students came knocking at her door. The students
had</B>
<P><B>just come to their dorms after being in the library all night cramming
for</B>
<P><B>an exam and when they arrived they found all their furniture and
belongings</B>
<P><B>completely rearranged. Nothing was missing or broken, just rearranged.
They</B>
<P><B>thought it was a practical joke but no one else had the key to their
dorm.</B>
<P><B>The only person who keeps the spare key is the Res. Assistant. and
those are</B>
<P><B>kept under lock and key themselves. Carolina called the San Antonio
P.D. and</B>
<P><B>they came over to take a look and no sign of forced entry was found.</B>
<P><B>Naturally the girls were worried that someone was able to break into
their</B>
<P><B>dorm so easily despite the tight security. The Res. Ass. let them stay
in an</B>
<P><B>unoccupied room for the night while the cops dusted for fingerprints.
There</B>
<P><B>were no fingerprints found other than those of the girls themselves.
Except</B>
<P><B>for one. One of the cops noticed a smudge on the window, dusted it
and</B>
<P><B>lifted it. To their shock, the smudge was a HUGE hand print, larger
than a</B>
<P><B>normal human one. Another strange thing was the print was found on
the</B>
<P><B>outside of the window and the fact that the dorm was three floors up
made it</B>
<P><B>more intriguing. There was no sign of the window's lock having been
forced</B>
<P><B>open. In fact the window was extremely hard to open since it hadn't
been</B>
<P><B>open in years. But, get this, one of the priests went to the room that
night</B>
<P><B>and saw that the room had been rearranged in the exact same way that
the</B>
<P><B>room where the nun killed herself was arranged. The reason that the
priest</B>
<P><B>knew was that he was one of only a few people who had actually been
inside</B>
<P><B>the nun's room. Creepy huh?</B>
<P><B>The mysterious hand print is still on file at the S.A. Police Office.

</H3><P><B>by CANCEL84@aol.com</B>
<P>&nbsp;
<P><B>Well this all started when I was about 17 or 18 years old.</B>
<P><B>My great grandma was very old and she was very sick.</B>
<P><B>I went and seen her at her house in the city.</B>
<P><B>About two week after I seen her.  She past on and I was </B>
<P><B>sad because she would not be able to see me graduate or </B>
<P><B>get married and she would not be there to see my child.</B>
<P>
<P><B>But months after she passed. My mom and I have notice</B>
<P><B>that she is at are home in the country.  I live in a trailer </B>
<P><B>home.  And when we are sitting there watching T.V. </B>
<P><B>My moms musical box will go off all the time and she </B>
<P><B>will say there she goes.  We are not scared of her we </B>
<P><B>just know it is her.  She also use to smoke and she </B>
<P><B>only used the wooden matches.  And some times you</B>
<P><B>can smell the sulfur from the matches when you might</B>
<P><B>walk by her .  It just isn't a week smell it is very</B>
<P><B>strong and it is not just in one place. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Well I am know 20 and She is still there with us.  </B>
<P><B>I have had a baby and she has this stuffed bear that plays</B>
<P><B>music.  In order to play the music you have to push the</B>
<P><B>hand of the bear to make him play.  He goes off all the </B>
<P><B>time by his self .  And on two different times I have seen </B>
<P><B>this very bright light. But  when I see the light I hurry up</B>
<P><B>and look and it disappears. But the light has only been in </B>
<P><B>my room and I think it is because my little girl is in there </B>
<P><B>with me.  My mom said it was probly her checking on my</B>
<P><B>little girl.  Realy in my heart Im glad she is here to see her.</B>
<P><B>So my experience is not scarey.  It is just my nanny checking</B>
<P><B>on my family and I .</B>

<H3><A NAME=final>A Final Good-Bye</A>
</H3><P><B>by Juliet6985@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is not really your typical  ghost story. Most ghost stories have
to do with a person that lived in a house and died there, then coming back
to seak revenge. Some stories even have some cool treasure in the basement.
My story is not quite like that.</B>
<P><B>I was about 12 years old when it happened. I grew up with two dogs
that I love dearly. They where around the age of 14 to 15 years old in human
years which made them about 100 years old in doggy years. My one dog Tiffany
was the eldest of the two . One spring night I went out to feed them dinner.
I would usualy stay there and wait till they where finished eating . Normally
Tiff would jump all over me to get to the food. On this night only my other
dog Bandit did. I was pretty shocked. She was laying there in her dog house
looking very sick. I tried to feed her but she just wouldn't take it . This
got me very worried. I sat there for about 20 min or so. I knew something
was wrong it almost brought me to tears. I got up, patted her on the head
and walked away. I turned arround to look at her I looked right into her
eyes and some thing told me that this would be the last time I would see
her alive. The next day after I came from school my mom told me and my brother
that Tiff passed away while  we where at school. My brother and I cried all
the way home. My dad said that Tiff had died in my moms arms. That comforted
me in a way but I still felt misrable. My family buried her that day. That
 night  I was feeling so upset because I didnt have a chance to say good
bye. I just sat there and cried myself to sleep.</B>
<P><B>Later that night I had a dream. I was in a room filled with white and
it was so beautifull there. I felt peace, there was a door way filled with
light and to my suprise Tiff came running through it. She came right up to
me and  licked me on my face. I hugged her so tight I didn't want to let
go, she pulled away. Then she started to go back in to the door way filled
with light. I yelled to her "please don't go stay with me". At that moment
she turned around and staired straight at me. She seemed to be smilling and
in a odd way I felt as if she was telling me that she would always be with
me then I knew she had to go. I smiled back then she turned her head and
bounced happily into the light. The next morning I told my family about the
dream. My mom said maybe that was her way of saying good bye. I then knew
that my dog was happy, it all was clear that Tiff wanted to say good bye
before she left.</B>
<P><B>After the day she died my whole family still felt her presence. I some
time would hear her wimper or  bark or even hear her scratching at my door.
So did my parents, that was when we came to the conclusion to pray for God
to take Tiff to heaven so she did not think she would have to stay with us
and my other dog Bandit. After that night I didnt hear the noises any more.
But I always feel she is right beside me. I never had a dream like that again.
Then a year after Tiff died so did Bandit, fortunetly I got to say good bye
to him. I miss them both very much and I still wish they where here but I
always know they are in my heart. </B>

<H3><A NAME=problems>My Friend's Problems</A>
</H3><P><B>by Makavelli_Shakur@bc.sympatico.ca </B>
<P>
<P><B>This story is of my friend Shane.  He is an extremely quiet young 16
year old.  He </B>
<P><B>was always shy and very quiet and we always felt sorry for him and
tried our best to </B>
<P><B>make him laugh.  We could never understand why and everyone knew not
to ask him, </B>
<P><B>until one night he decided to tell us. This night was Shane's last
night living in </B>
<P><B>the neighborhood as he was moving so we all decided to get wasted at
our friends </B>
<P><B>house.  We were all just talking in my friend Evan's room when someone
asked Shane </B>
<P><B>if he felt tired, because he looked very exhausted.  We all knew Shane
had a </B>
<P><B>sleeping disorder, and was an insomniac.  He didn't answer my friend
when he was </B>
<P><B>asked that question, but he did ask if we wanted to know why he can
never sleep.  </B>
<P><B>Since he was a little buzzed I think it helped him tell the truth that
had been </B>
<P><B>bottled up inside him.  He had told us we can believe anything we want
but just </B>
<P><B>don't laugh or think it is crazy.  We know him to be a pretty honest
guy and if he </B>
<P><B>has lied to us before we've never found out about it.  He said that
when he was </B>
<P><B>growing up in his previous house he had gone through some strange things
as a child. </B>
<P><B> At about the age of 9 or 10 he remembers getting a brand new He-Man
poster.  When </B>
<P><B>he tried sticking it up it continuosly would roll up and fall down.
 No matter how </B>
<P><B>many thumb tacks and pieces of tape he would put on it, the thumb tacks
would pop </B>
<P><B>out.  In his room he had numerous posters that had stayed up but this
one poster </B>
<P><B>which he put up against his closet door never could stay up.  He later
felt it was </B>
<P><B>due to a symbol of the crucifix in the poster.  Of course at first
he didn't know </B>
<P><B>the poster not staying up had anything to do with hauntings.  The strange
thing he </B>
<P><B>said about the house was that he only had memories of staying in it
the first day he </B>
<P><B>tried putting up his poster but had lived there since birth.  He said
he could not </B>
<P><B>remember one single birthday party or particular incident before this.
 That night </B>
<P><B>he says he started having his constant sleeping problems.  He would
hear the </B>
<P><B>whimpering of a child coming from his closet.  It paralyzed him with
so much fear to </B>
<P><B>the point where he was so scared he could not move and was sweating
bullets while </B>
<P><B>shivering.  He was finally able to scream for his mother, she came
within seconds of </B>
<P><B>hearing her son and when Shane told her, she felt it was her older
son playing a </B>
<P><B>joke.  She went to her older sons room, but he wasn't there, he had
snuck out of his </B>
<P><B>room and went to a party and only got busted because of what happened
to Shane.  </B>
<P><B>Other incidents occured where he says he would open his eyes from a
deep sleep and </B>
<P><B>see words glowing in the dark on the closet door, one night he remembers
seeing the </B>
<P><B>words "hurt daddy".  The only times he said he could sleep he knew
he would wake up </B>
<P><B>to see something, other than that he was too frightened to sleep. 
The mirror in </B>
<P><B>his room also scared him so his parents got rid of it.  He said he
once saw a </B>
<P><B>small boy sitting curled up against the wall behind him crying but
with no noise </B>
<P><B>coming from his mouth.  He said his dad even had experiences, his dad
was a </B>
<P><B>very,very calm looking man, let face it we all think he looks like
a pencil neck </B>
<P><B>geek, but some nights his father would get unusually upset at him for
no reason, but </B>
<P><B>Shane would not be frightened of his father when he was in his room
no matter how </B>
<P><B>much he would yell and threaten him.  Shane had been going to a
Psychiatrist for </B>
<P><B>many years and the psychiatrist hired a researcher to look into the
past history of </B>
<P><B>the house.  It turns out a boy had been found dead in the closet of
Shane's room </B>
<P><B>decades earlier, killed possibly by the father who fled the country.
 Coincidentely </B>
<P><B>the older brother of the boy was still living in the neighborhood and
was a middle </B>
<P><B>age adult.  He was contacted by Shane's mother.  He told her the complete
story of </B>
<P><B>how his father was a short tempered man and would physically abuse
both of them.  He </B>
<P><B>said that his brother that died would hide from his dad in the closet
while he got </B>
<P><B>spanked or hit.  He would hide there all the time until his father
would run in </B>
<P><B>their and spank him.  Normally his father would have no trouble opening
the closet </B>
<P><B>door but for the first time his brother resisted, his dad had got fed
up and rigged </B>
<P><B>it so his son could not get out.  He left him in there for 12 days
with no food or </B>
<P><B>water.  When Shane told us this we all were petrified and scared to
look in the </B>
<P><B>mirror for awhile but one thing we belived him.  There is always that
time you will </B>
<P><B>hear an extremely bizzare and unbelievable story you truly believe
because of the </B>
<P><B>validity of the person, this is one of those stories for me.</B>

<H3><A NAME=bathroom>The Forbidden Bathroom</A>
</H3><P><B>by taaffem@ERE.UMontreal.CA </B>
<P>
<P><B>This was my only encounter with a ghost. I'm not "special", I don't</B>
<P><B>have powers or whatever, this just happened to me. I wish it
hadn't...</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>  In the 1950's, my school was a boarding school. The building is in
one</B>
<P><B>of the calm neighbourhoods of the city, and is surrounded by trees.
It</B>
<P><B>was and all-girl institution and the students were miserable. One day,
a</B>
<P><B>girl named Sandra was punished for not listening in class. She was</B>
<P><B>locked in one of the bathrooms of the third floor for several hours.</B>
<P><B>Sandra went ballistic, she was kicking, screaming and threatning to
kill</B>
<P><B>herself. The sisters apparently forgot her and when they came back
to</B>
<P><B>get her, she had dissapeared. She'd written death threats with her
own</B>
<P><B>blood on the walls. No window was opened because of the steel bars.
They</B>
<P><B>never found her... That bathroom is now damned and locked with a
chain.</B>
<P>
<P><B>      One day after school I was finishing my latest art project. The</B>
<P><B>art classroom is on the third floor, just next to "the" bathroom. When
I</B>
<P><B>finally finished and stepped in the corridor, I heard faint crying
and</B>
<P><B>yelling coming from that bathroom, and saw a frail shadow lurking</B>
<P><B>around. I SWEAR. I was completely freaked out. I had nightmares for</B>
<P><B>weeks after that. I always was skeptical about ghost stories altough
I</B>
<P><B>enjoyed them greatly. Since the Sandra story, I'm a complete
believer.</B>

</H3><P><B>by pluggers@travel-net.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>One summer night, on our way back from a party.  Two other friends
and</B>
<P><B>I were walking up an old street.  Apparently a man in his 30's was</B>
<P><B>killed, when he was struck by a car.  One of my friends brought up
this</B>
<P><B>subject while we were walking, we were a little freaked out to say
the</B>
<P><B>least.  Shortly after we had all thrown are different comments in
about</B>
<P><B>this subject we saw something incredible.  A man in a blue jogging
suit</B>
<P><B>that was glowing, was headed towards us.  Nobody could move, I still</B>
<P><B>remember the look on our faces.  We were terrified.  The man was
jogging</B>
<P><B>towards us, in a floating sort of fashion.  Right before he got to
where</B>
<P><B>we were he vanished.  Shortly after this occured we did some
research,</B>
<P><B>and were apolled to find out a man did infact get hit by a car while
he</B>
<P><B>was jogging.  The man was also wearing a blue suit......</B>.

<H3><A NAME=granpa>Granpa's House</A>
</H3><P><B>by AgtMulder8@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi my name is Brigon I'm 12 years old and I use to live in Airdre Alberta
Which is relly close to Calgary. I now live in Pompano Beach Florida.</B>
<P><B>This is most of the hauntings I recall from my Grandpa's house.</B>
<B>These Ghost stories happened in between the years 1990-1994.</B> &nbsp;<B>I
was 6-9 years old.</B>
<P><B>My Granpa had bought a house in the countryside near Calgary, Alberta,
Canada.</B>
<P><B>A man and his wife had lived there for a while. This house was humongus,
most of my family on my dad's side lived there until they sold it a year
ago. While anyway back to the subject. The man who lived feel down the stairs
and bleed to death. The blood travled all the way through the hallway to
the bathroon.His wife was out on buissness and did not get back till 2 weeks
later to find her husband dead. She then sold the house to my Grandpa. </B>
<P><B>The first thing that happened was that my sister and I where down stairs
while my dad was on the phone. Me and my sister where playing with the alarm
and it went off. It is not supposed to go off unless you hit the correct
code, which I doubt we could of done. </B>
<P><B>The next thing that happened was that me and my cousin were up playing
super nintendo in the loft and the TV went out while it was still pluged
in. The TV also went on while it was unpluged.</B>
<P><B>When ever you used the bathroom downstairs you could feel a ceertain
presence after yoy left the bathroom.</B>
<P><B>One night well I was sleeping over at my grandpas I had a dream something
was pulling me down the loft stairs, not the ones that the previsous owner
fell down.  </B>
<P><B>One morning when I woke up I walked out into the Hallway and saw footsteps
being made in the carpet while I was walking out. None of this really scared
me but I didnt like it either.</B>
<P><B>The next stories are experinces that different members of my family
had the that same house. My dad was sleeping in my cousin's room when he
woke up and saw a man wearing a plad shirt. The man that died in the house
always liked wearing plad shirts. He was sitting on the dresser and then
just got up and walked away.</B>
<P><B>The next thing is that my aunt was sleeping and woke up and saw the
same guy that my dad saw floating over top of her. She than ran up to my
other aunts room and my two aunts talked aboubt the exact same experince
they just had.</B>
<P>T<B>hese are all the haunting that happened to me or that where told to
me by other family members. I dont not know who lives in the house right
now but I would like to now if they are having the same experiences my family
had.</B>

<P><B>rented the house out to.</B>
<P><B>	It was just a few months after we had moved into the house (Up to
</B>
<P><B>12 years ago now.), that my sister woke up one night to see the image
of </B>
<P><B>an old man, standing by her bedroom door and staring at her. She was
of </B>
<P><B>course, terrified and immediately hid underneath the bed clothes. When
</B>
<P><B>she finally plucked up the courage to look again, the man had gone.
This </B>
<P><B>was the only time anyone ever saw a ghost whilst we were in the
house.</B>
<P><B>	Although we may never have seen any more ghosts, we have still </B>
<P><B>many experiences that cannot be accounted for. One night, my mother
was </B>
<P><B>alone in her bedroom at around 4.00am, when she heard footsteps walk
</B>
<P><B>across the ceiling above her. The room is just an old boxroom and there
</B>
<P><B>was know one on that floor.</B>
<P><B>	The only time I have ever come up against a ghost was when one </B>
<P><B>inhabited my room for a while. Although I never saw it, I could </B>
<P><B>definitely feel it's presents. It was almost as I it were regarding
me </B>
<P><B>with some distaste, because I could always feel it's cold gaze upon
my </B>
<P><B>back when I tried to get to sleep. This cold feeling would keep me
up </B>
<P><B>hours into the night, because I was always looking over my shoulder
to </B>
<P><B>see if I could see it.</B>
<P><B>	This all came to a head when I finally got so annoyed with the </B>
<P><B>ghost, that I blurted out: "Go away, Leave me alone!". To my utter
</B>
<P><B>relief, this seemed to help, and the present left my room and never
</B>
<P><B>returned.</B>
<P><B>	As for the people who have rented the house after us, they have </B>
<P><B>not experienced much except for quite a bit of poltergeist activity,
this </B>
<P><B>has been happening around the kitchen of the house and manifests itself
</B>
<P><B>in knocking things like knives and other such cooking utensils off
the </B>
<P><B>surfaces. I don't know much about this, because they have only just
moved </B>
<P><B>in.</B>
<P><B>	I am doing some private research in the subject of ghosts, and </B>
<P><B>would appreciate any material that will help me. E-mail me at : </B>

<H3><A NAME=stories>Stories.....</A>
</H3><P><B>by anonymous</B>
<P>
<P><B>Stories........I am a very logical man. I have never believed in ghosts,
</B>
<P><B>goblins,and the like. As of late I've begun to see things....and people
</B>
<P><B>who are not, or should not be there. My mother has informed me that
we </B>
<P><B>come from a long bloodline of psychics...I don't believe it. My wife
</B>
<P><B>tells me I have a "gift". I respond by saying I have an over active
</B>
<P><B>imagination.</B>
<P><B>	It all started about three years ago when I moved in with my </B>
<P><B>wife-to-be. I went into the kitchen early in the morning to get a drink.
</B>
<P><B>There by the sink, I thought I saw an elderly women. Passing it off
as </B>
<P><B>lack of sleep, I went back to bed. My wife wouldn't let up on me. She
</B>
<P><B>made me describe the woman I thought I saw. Well my description matched
</B>
<P><B>that of her grandmother who died in the kitchen just a few years
before.</B>
<P><B>Telling her she was silly, I dismissed it. A month later, I was greeted
</B>
<P><B>at the foot of the stairs by a large man. Not knowing what to do, I
stood </B>
<P><B>there like a moron. He sighed heavily and vanished. Again, I passed
it </B>
<P><B>off as imagination. Over the last few years my sightings have been
</B>
<P><B>getting stronger and stronger. I see aparitions on almost a daily basis.
</B>
<P><B>I am a logical man, so I doubt what I see. But so far out of </B>
<P><B>"coincidence" I've described a young girl around a stretch of road
that </B>
<P><B>always walks out infront of me. My mother-in-law says it was her friend's
</B>
<P><B>daughter who was killed there a year ago. After viewing the pictures,
I </B>
<P><B>do agree the resemblance is great. I've also decribed two women who
were </B>
<P><B>killed in the factory in which I work. Being logical, what can I pass
off </B>
<P><B>as imagination, and what is real. I thought I knew, but I've been having
</B>
<P><B>doubts.....</B>

<H3><A NAME=tall>The Tall Stranger</A>
</H3><P><B>by streetmanc@ten-nash.ten.k12.tn.us </B>
<P>
<P><B>I don't know exactly where or when this story happened except</B>
<P><B>that it was in my native Taylor County, GA, (West Central part of the
state)</B>
<P><B>early in ths 20th century.  It was passed along in the family and I
heard</B>
<P><B>it as a child in the 1930's.</B>
<P><B>	Two of my young male relatives had been visiting on Saturday night</B>
<P><B>and were walking home late (midnight or after) on an unpaved, sandy
country</B>
<P><B>road.  The moon was full, and they saw a stranger approaching.  He
was at</B>
<P><B>least seven feet tall, and was walking in the middle of the road. 
My</B>
<P><B>relatives were walking in the ruts.</B>
<P><B>	As the stranger approached, both spoke to him, but he continued</B>
<P><B>straight ahead without acknowledging their presence and went on
between</B>
<P><B>them.  They spoke again but got no reaponse.  They stopped and turned
to</B>
<P><B>watch him until he got out of sight.</B>
<P><B>	Over breakfast the next morning, they discussed the event and felt</B>
<P><B>that such a tall man must have taken enormously long strides.  They
walked</B>
<P><B>back to the place where they had seen him.  The found their own tracks
in</B>
<P><B>the road where they had stopped and turned around to watch him, but
try as</B>
<P><B>they might, they never found any sign of the stranger's tracks.  This
was</B>
<P><B>in the fall line sand hills of Middle Georgia, so the tracks should
have</B>
<P><B>been clearly visible.</B>
<P><B>	That's the whole story.  They never figured out who the stranger</B>
<P><B>was nor how he came to be there, nor why he left no tracts.  Both
were</B>
<P><B>convinced, however,that they had encountered a ghost, or a "haint"
as</B>
<P><B>ghosts were called in that area in those times.</B>
<P><B>	Both told the same story and swore to it.  Sorry it is not more</B>
<P><B>dramatic and that there is no more information, but this story did
suffice</B>
<P><B>to scare the wits out of us children around a dying fire late on
Saturday</B>
<P><B>night.</B>

<H3><A NAME=plantation>Plantation Ghosts</A>
</H3><P><B>by Nene475602@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>All my life I've been able to sense and sometimes see ghosts. I admit,
I've never really been afraid of them, but since I've never had a bad experience,
I may not know how truly terrified someone can be when confronted with the
unknown.</B>
<P><B>When I was fourteen, my family (mother, brother and sister) and I moved
to an old house on the outskirts of a small town in Alabama. The house stood
on what was the original site of an old plantation house built before the
Civil War, and the land around it had been a cotton farm. The family had
had money, but after the war, their house being destroyed by Union troops,
they moved to the back of the property to what had been the overseers house.
Later, around 1910, the family came into enough money to rebuild a replica
of the original house on the same site. Seventy years later is where I come
in.</B>
<P><B>The family had returned to the small house in the back of the property
(since it consisted of several hundred acres, one can imagine that they weren't
exactly neighbors) and the plantation house was up for rent at a price that
was fantastically low, even for a rural area. My mother snatched at the
opportunity to live in such a historical building, even though it had no
heating or air conditioning, at least the plumbing was sound.</B>
<P><B>The house was completely furnished with antiques, most of them having
been in the original family for decades. I soon realized after we moved in
that the house was haunted by several ghosts.</B>
<P><B>In the formal parlor in the front of the house, there was a collection
of hideous mahogany furniture, all of it massive and heavily carved, stuffed
with horsehair and covered in faded velvet. A high backed sofa stood beneath
one window, and it was this sofa that was the scene of an unusual haunting.</B>
<P><B>The furniture in the room had been purchased at the turn-of-the-century
as a wedding gift for Rose, known by the family as Aunt Rose. She moved into
the rebuilt house in her later years, and moved her prized furniture there,
into the parlor. That sofa was Aunt Rose's pride and joy, and NOBODY was
allowed to sit in it (except, of course, for Aunt Rose). After Aunt Rose
died, STILL nobody could sit on the sofa -- if they did, they were pushed
off by an unseen force. When my family moved into the house, we were warned
about this phenomena. Still, I couldn't resist climbing onto that old sofa,
and feeling a sort of icy cold chill when something (or someone) shoved me
gently, and sometimes not so gently, into the floor.</B>
<P><B>I never saw Aunt Rose, but there was one ghost I felt sorry for. I
had seen her several times, always looking out a window in one of the upstairs
bedrooms that was not in use. She appeared to be a child with long hair,
wearing a high-necked nightgown. Occasionally, we heard little thumps coming
from that room, as if a child were jumping up and down, or sometimes we heard
whispers that we couldn't quite make out. My mother is sensitive, like me,
so we'd put our heads against the door and strain, trying to make out what
she was saying. But we never could. The little girl looked completely lost
and woebegone. I never did find out who she was.</B>
<P><B>One evening, my mother and I, and my brother and sister, were sitting
in her bed watching television. There was a ferocious thunderstorm going
on outside, the lights were flickering -- it was like something out of an
old Hammer horror film. My mother had a glass of ice tea on the nightstand,
and when she reached out for it, she knocked it off the stand onto the floor.
But when she leaned over the bed, it wasn't there.</B>
<P><B>We all got off the bed and looked around the room. The floor wasn't
wet anywhere, and you'd expect it to be if a full glass of tea had spilled,
even if the glass rolled into a corner. Finally, I got down on my knees and
looked UNDER the bed. The glass was in the center of the floor, underneath
the bed, and UPSIDE DOWN. Not a drop had spilled. As we all stared at this
strange phenomena, the window in the room blew open, then slammed shut, and
we all heard a woman laughing.</B>
<P><B>I've had a few other experiences in other houses, but I've never lived
in a house so populated by ghosts. But, they were fairly benevolent, certainly
not malicious, and if I ever get the chance, I'd like to go there again -
just to say Hi.</B>

<H3><A NAME=morris>The House in Morris County</A>
</H3><P><B>by KIMPECK@msn.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello,</B>
<P><B>I am a true believer in all things ghostly, but I am very interested
in those </B>
<P><B>readers who have had sightings of those who have passed on.  My family
has had </B>
<P><B>several experiences with loved ones who have come back to visit.  I
have not </B>
<P><B>had anything happen personally, where I saw an apparition, but two
of my </B>
<P><B>brothers, and two of my aunts have had experiences.  I don't feel it
</B>
<P><B>appropriate to leave their stories without their permission, but I
do recall </B>
<P><B>"odd" feelings in the house where I grew up in Morris County, New
Jersey.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The house that we lived in (my parents, three brothers, and I) was
my aunt's </B>
<P><B>home, and my grandfather had lived there when he passed away.  I was
very </B>
<P><B>young (11 months old) when he died, and do not remember him, but I
do believe </B>
<P><B>that he would visit me in my room.  I  never saw him, but I did feel
his </B>
<P><B>presence strongly.  There was an extremely cold spot in my room, by
my closet, </B>
<P><B>and several times during the years that I occupied that bedroom, I
would smell </B>
<P><B>pipe smoke.  I never said anything to my parents, I was never scared
at all.  </B>
<P><B>Only after I was older and began hearing the accounts of my aunts and
brothers </B>
<P><B>did I mention the cold spot and the sweet smell of the pipe tobacco.
 My </B>
<P><B>parents showed me the pipe that my grandfather smoked, which had been
packed </B>
<P><B>away since his death.</B>
<P><B>My older brother and I also had the same strange feelings in our basement.
 He </B>
<P><B>used the basement as his bedroom, and there was rarely a night when
he did not </B>
<P><B>bring one or both of our pet dogs downstairs with him when he went
to bed.  </B>
<P><B>There was a small room off of the main room downstairs, and that was
where our </B>
<P><B>clothes dryer and large freezer were.  I would go down there to get
clothes or </B>
<P><B>ice cream, and I could never get out of the basement quick enough.
 I </B>
<P><B>sustained several skinned knees from the cement basement stairs, because
I </B>
<P><B>would run and usually trip up the stairs.  After my brother left for
college, </B>
<P><B>I hated going down there.  I had mentioned the weird feelings I had
about the </B>
<P><B>basement not too long ago, and he told me that he was not always
comfortable </B>
<P><B>down there.  Like me, there were times when he could not get upstairs
quick </B>
<P><B>enough.  I guess that's why he liked to bring the dogs down with him.
 Fear </B>
<P><B>seems to be lessened when you're not by yourself.</B>
<P><B>We have since moved, and I no longer sense any of these odd feelings.
 I am </B>
<P><B>also a true believer in angels, and anyone who has had an angel experience
is </B>
<P><B>welcome to mail me.  I would like to hear from you.  I am a survivor
of </B>
<P><B>domestic violence, and I think my belief in angels has helped me heal.
 I </B>
<P><B>would love to find a way to learn about MY angel.  I know that there
is at </B>
<P><B>least one who watches over me, and I am eager to learn who it may be.
 Sounds </B>
<P><B>strange, but I truely believe.</B>
<P><B>I look forward to hearing from you, or any of your visitors.  This
is a great </B>
<P><B>site.</B>

<H3><A NAME=grandfather>My Grandfather ?</A>
</H3><P><B>by Glory50@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have a few stories to tell you about with my past expierences with
ghosts or what I believe is to be my grandfather. Ever since we lived in
his house in which they bought new when my mother was a little girl. Nothing
like this ever happened until we finally moved in. But if it is my grandfather,
it is most definitely a good ghost.                                     
       </B>
<P><B>     This happened to me brother a few years ago.(First you should
know first that every night in the middle of the night he gets up and turns
on his light over his bed and shuts his door so it won't bother anyone, so
he can go down stairs to the Kitchen and get a drink.) But anyway back to
the story, as he was going down stairs  to get a drink he left the kitchen
light off and when he walked into the kitchen to see my grandfather just
standing there. As my brother stood in amazement, my grandfather told my
brother that he was just checking up on the house and then disappeared. </B>
<P><B>     Another time my dad and I were down stairs in the den playing
darts. My father was winning and he was making fun of me because I kept on
hitting the the wall more then the dart board. But anyway, as he was making
fun of me, I said to him " If grandpa was here, he wouldn't let you make
fun of me like that." Then I threw the dart and the dart started to go down
toward the recliner as if to hit it, when suddenly it went right back up
and made a bulls eye!!!! My dad and I  were standing there in amazement and
my father said, " I think your grandfather is here to protect you after all."
then after that we went up stairs.</B>
<P><B>     If my grandfather does truely come here to check up on us I always
feel that he is usually down stairs in the den because,  when he lived here
they didn't have and air conditioner and down in the den was the coolest
place to be.</B>

<H3><A NAME=cecil>Grandpa Cecil</A>
</H3><P><B>by Tililac@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I feel like I need to tell my story about my beloved grandpa Cecil.
While growing up I have experienced many things, Guardian angels, strange
things, seen my best friend's death, had conversations with long gone people,
but never have I experience anything like this before. My mother's father
Cecil was dying in a hospital from a long illness. My mother my 2 sisters,
and my 2 and half year old daughter, and I went to visit him in the hospital
for 2 weekends in a row before he died, which was not easy because they lived
about 5 and half hours drive from home. They wouldn't allow my daughter to
visit him because he was in icu and were afraid of germs. On the second day
we snuck her in because we were afraid we wouldn't see him alive, his time
was coming to an end soon. She hadn't seen him in a while and he had all
this tubes and strange things around his bed. But she said,"Grandpa." and
tried to remove his breathing tubes from his nose so she could give him a
kiss. That was the last day we visited him for we headed back home the next
early morning. Before we left the room,  we all kissed him goodbye and signed,
"I love you."  My grandpa signed back and my mom had tears in her eyes, she
said that my grandpa never used it til now, so we had a feeling that heaven
would come calling soon. About a week after that, I was feeling kind of sick
so I went to lay down in bed, I wasn't asleep yet but just about there. I
saw myself back in his room, at the hospital. I was lying in his bed, taking
his place. I felt unexpainable exreme pain all over my body. It hurt so much
I had hard time breathing, I heard someone saying," It's ok, Dad. We're here."
There was no way I could have heard that because I am deaf. I looked at the
side of my bed and I saw my Aunt Andrea, and at the foot of my bed I saw
my Aunt Kathie. And on the other side of my bed, on the right side I saw
my grandma Jo, my grandpa's second wife. They were all there and saying it
was ok, that I could go. I felt sudden peace and no more pain. I felt happy
and loved and only thing that I felt sad was that I was leaving my family.
Then I woke up from that dream. My mom called me that same day and I had
thought he had died. I was so upset. She said no he didn't die. So I assumed
it was just a dream, from all the things I've been going thru. I told her
my dream and she resurranced me that he was still alive. Early morning 2
days later my mother called and told my husband that my grandpa had just
died. I felt so sad and planned for the funeral that following weekend. We
went up there and the day before the funeral we had a wake. I watched with
sorrow as my mother said goodbye tearfully to my grandpa. I never want to
see such pain from my mom again I could tell she was in pain. That night
we all had dinner with all of the family at a restuarant. My mom was telling
my Aunt Kathie my dream. My aunt looked at me and said everything that I
had dreamed was true. I was very, very surprised! Later when I had time to
think about it, I truly believe it was his way of saying goodbye, His way
of telling me everything was ok. Grandpa wasn't in pain anymore and he was
going to a good place. </B>
