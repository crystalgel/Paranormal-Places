a near death experience when I was 2 1/2.&nbsp; I actually left my body and traveled 
down the proverbial tunnel and was met by a woman who told me to go back.&nbsp; 
      </small></font></big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">&nbsp;I spent the remainder of my childhood and teen years in 
Iowa in 
numerous houses all of which seemed to be haunted, actually leaving a home in 
the middle of the night with my parents and siblings in 1979 after seeing a 
ghost enter my bedroom that my parents had had experiences while occupying the 
room.&nbsp; I was married and moved to Hawaii where we were stationed.&nbsp; I experienced 
hauntings there as well, including an unhappy being crouching on a table in a 
military hotel.&nbsp; A year later, we moved back to Iowa where I again experienced ghostly visits 
whom I believe was a deceased boyfriend of my grandmothers who always wore 
slippers in life and I heard every night shuffling in our kitchen.&nbsp; In 1984 we 
moved to Texas.&nbsp; I lived in 2 different homes in 
Austin again 
experiencing spirits mostly spirits out of the corner of my eyes and noises 
accompanying the glimpses of the spirits.</font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">We moved back to Iowa 1991-92 while my husband was stationed 
out of the country.&nbsp; The house we lived in, shadows were seen frequently in the 
hall of the home where we lived.&nbsp; We were then stationed in Abilene Texas in 92-93 off base in a home that seemed 
to have an air of bad luck about it.&nbsp; We always had plumbing problems there, 
injuries, endless repairs of household items and vehicles.&nbsp; We moved to another 
home in Abilene 
where we had in infestation of bugs, ants, spiders, roaches and slugs.&nbsp; We found 
a narrow crawlspace under the home that had been boarded up.&nbsp; It just felt that 
something sinister had taken place there, although we could never find any 
history on the home that would lead us to feel that way. We then received orders 
to Las Vegas Nevada.&nbsp; Frequently we found the blinds open 
and lights on when we were sure we had shut them before going to bed.&nbsp; My 
husband again received orders over seas, so I moved back to Iowa to live in an 
apartment.&nbsp; My sister lived in the apartment next door where she saw what she 
described as a man leaning out of the wall of my apartment into hers.&nbsp; The baby 
monitor in my boys room often contained voices that were not my boys.&nbsp; 
Unbelievably we again received orders back to Las Vegas in 96.&nbsp; Unexplainable knocking on 
doors, toys flying across the room, and a little girls voice calling mom from 
the hall occurred in that home.&nbsp; 1998 I typed in ghosts on the internet. The 
first listing that came up was the Shadowlands.&nbsp; I met Dave Juliano who listened 
to my experiences.&nbsp; He answered my questions, and then taught me a lot.&nbsp; He asked 
me to become co-director where I am still helping our millions of visitors a 
year with their ghostly questions and experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp; I founded Las Vegas Society 
of Supernatural Investigations in 98.&nbsp; I have taught my 4 member team everything 
I know as well as honing our skills and abilities to fit our purposes here in 
Las Vegas.&nbsp; I 
investigate private homes, suspected public hauntings and cemeteries.&nbsp; I like 
helping people either find natural causes for their suspected hauntings, or 
teaching them to live peacefully in their own homes without fear.&nbsp; I have 
realized through my research and training that the homes I resided and that I 
suspected to be haunted, might have had natural causes and could not be counted 
as true hauntings without other evidence to collaborate my feelings.&nbsp; If you do not become your 
own worst skeptic with your photos and other evidence collected, it is guaranteed that someone else will, 
making you look and feel quite foolish.</font></p>

      <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I am mostly an empath
feeling a spirits emotions and frame of mind.&nbsp; I have been known
to walk into a suspected haunted area and burst out in tears, or even
in laughter due to the spirits emotional energy. I now live in a new
house in Las Vegas where everyone of my family has experienced
something supernatural including pipe smoke, whispers, shadows and
items moving.</font></td><small>
