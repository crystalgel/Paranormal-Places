<BR><B>Connected Situations</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Linda-Atkins@ouhsc.edu</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was getting ready for bed one night and I had to walk through a
small laundry room to the bedroom.&nbsp; It was there that I saw an apparition
just standing in the middle of the room.&nbsp; I stood and starred at it
for a while.&nbsp; I wanted to know who it was, but I didn't really get
an answer.&nbsp; I thought that it might be my mother trying to contact
me, because I was upset about a few things and you know how mothers are,
they want to comfort you if they can.&nbsp; If she could come to me in
a time of need, I know that she would.&nbsp; Because of some of the dreams
that I was having, I was receiving messages from the meanings and symbols
of my dreams that some one that I loved would pass away.&nbsp; On January
9, 2002, my beloved friend did die of MS.&nbsp; He meant the world to me
and I am still grieving for him.&nbsp; I have wondered if it was the Lord's
way to prepare me for that by sending an angel; since it was an apparition
that had a form that seemed be draped from head to toe in a cloth that
glowed.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; It is hard to know what to make of it.&nbsp;
I know that it was real and it happened.&nbsp; When I went to lay down,
I felt a little bit of fear and yet I kept thinking and asking myself&nbsp;
if there was something I should do to open up a line of communication.&nbsp;
Since that time, I have thought several times about it, that it was very
strange to see or witness something of that magnitude without a better
communication of thought or message.&nbsp;&nbsp; After my friend's funeral,
I dreamed that I saw him as I was entering a church meeting and we talked.&nbsp;
After interpreting the meaning of all the symbols in the dream, it meant
that he would always be my friend and he would be watching over me.&nbsp;
It gave me a lot of comfort.&nbsp; I feel like the two situations are connected.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Camping Trip right out of Blair Witch Project</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Mndv815@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>In early March last year my husband and I had the most terrifying
night of our lives! Avid campers, we had never been scared sleeping out
in the middle of nowhere in our tent. We went to a campground called Weldon
Springs in Ilinois, about 45 miles from our home. We stayed in the backpacking
area which at that time of year is isolated except for a few deer and birds.
I felt fear the minute we walked into our spot. We had camped in that spot
several times before with no wierd occurences. I felt like we were being
watched. I tried to pass it off as the dead trees and grass and lack of
any other people around. By evening sitting around the fire I was scared.
Our friend came along to stay with us, had sleeping bag with him, ready
to camp. Oddly he decided not to stay. When we got settled in our tent
Hell broke loose. We laid there a minute and I heard an odd stomping noise
on the trail leading to our site. It got louder like it was getting closer.
I asked my husband after we discussed it ourselves he said he had felt
such an evil presence there was no way he was staying!</B>
<BR><B>We know there was something strange out there that night and will
never forget it. In humor we call it our own Blair witch night.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Camp Connecticut</B>
<BR><B>By:&nbsp; Sublime230lbc@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Camp Connecticut is a run down "camp" as they</B>
<BR><B>call it where a group of men once occupied, said to be a cult, and</B>
<BR><B>eventually the town had them kicked out of the town. when abandoned,
the</B>
<BR><B>care takers daughter was found brutally murdered in the camp, all
former</B>
<BR><B>members of the camp denied any knowledge or participation in the
murder. my</B>
<BR><B>expiriences included voices; ex. a young girl screaming which we
thought</B>
<BR><B>could have been the the young murdered girl, we have seen figures
pass among</B>
<BR><B>the trees while walking through the narrow paths along the woods,
in</B>
<BR><B>pictures that i have taken there are many "orbs" near the main gate
and near</B>
<BR><B>the large sign within the camp, examinations shown not be be photo
error or</B>
<BR><B>bad developement. And in a story, my best friends brother took a
trip here</B>
<BR><B>and while walking the main entrance pathway came across a man standing</B>
<BR><B>there, they called to him and there was no response so they turned
to go the</B>
<BR><B>other way and when they did he wa!</B>
<BR><B>> s standing right in front of them, as they turned and ran he began
to run</B>
<BR><B>after them, as they got close to the main gate, they turned and
there was no</B>
<BR><B>one behind them, they stopped and turned back towards the gate to
leave and</B>
<BR><B>they recall about 40 apparitions standing in front of the gate,
as they</B>
<BR><B>walked towards them they parted, letting them though, and they walked
right</B>
<BR><B>in between them. as the got to their car the figures slowly dissapeared.</B>
<BR><B>This place is very freaky to even just look at the main gate, I
get scared</B>
<BR><B>every time i go. i will send our photos as soon as i get my scanner
up and</B>
<BR><B>running.</B><B></B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I have been tempted to write what happened to my family many times
but it</B>
<BR><B>seems far to unreal. We where not allowed to talk about this out
of the house</B>
<BR><B>when i was a child and my mother only told house guests about our&nbsp;
"visitors"</B>
<BR><B>when they experienced something in our house.</B>
<BR><B>Our childhood home was built in 1898. My parents bought the house
in 1974</B>
<BR><B>when i was only six months old. The house was very large and had
been</B>
<BR><B>converted into a double. My grandmother moved into the upper level.
Strange</B>
<BR><B>things began to happen shortly after my family moved in. My mother
had her</B>
<BR><B>first experience one night after she had sent my older sisters to
bed. From</B>
<BR><B>her bedroom door she could look out and see into the kitchens hallway
and</B>
<BR><B>into the bathroom. My family had only lived in the house less than
a month</B>
<BR><B>when my mom saw a little blonde haired girl walk into the bathroom.
All of my</B>
<BR><B>sisters have very dark brown hair and this was clearly a blonde
haired child.</B>
<BR><B>My mother panicked and yelled to the little girl but the door shut.
My mom</B>
<BR><B>jumped out of bed, in her mind she was thinking that this little
girl was a</B>
<BR><B>neighbors child that my sisters must have snuck in the house when
she opened</B>
<BR><B>the door, there was nobody inside the room. My mother nicknamed
the little</B>
<BR><B>girl jessie I have no idea why. My mother had many experiences in
the house</B>
<BR><B>and with the younger children ,myself,my younger sister and younger
brother</B>
<BR><B>when we where very small it was as if&nbsp; we where playing with
someone else. I</B>
<BR><B>don't remember this butmy mom did but i do remember that in my oldest
sisters</B>
<BR><B>bedroom in her closet there was a paneled off section that led under
our</B>
<BR><B>hallway steps to the second floor i remember talking to someone
that we</B>
<BR><B>called the lady under the stairs. I always thought that it was my
mom or</B>
<BR><B>grandmother but i later learned that was not the case. When we told
my mom</B>
<BR><B>about this she would not let us play this game any more i do not
remember</B>
<BR><B>being scared at all. My younger sister and i would also go into
our hallway</B>
<BR><B>and play with the lady on the stairs i have very little recollection
of this</B>
<BR><B>at the time i would have been about four years old and my sister
would have</B>
<BR><B>been three. When we described the woman to my mother she forbade
us from</B>
<BR><B>being in the hallway alone. I never took the ghost stories to heart
and was</B>
<BR><B>very carefree as a child I always felt safe however i did finally
have a</B>
<BR><B>bizarre experience that i could not eplain or rationalize away.
My</B>
<BR><B>grandmother had a stroke when i was fifteen and my mother gave my
older</B>
<BR><B>sisters bedroom to my grandmother since it was on the first level
and was</B>
<BR><B>safer for her. She had no control over what she was saying and was
rapidly</B>
<BR><B>deteriorating. My parents did not lay down any ground rules for
us kids that</B>
<BR><B>summer as things where in havoc and my brother and i had stayed
up all night</B>
<BR><B>watching nick at night in the living room.&nbsp; I could see in
to my grandmothers</B>
<BR><B>room and we also kept an eye out for her should she need to use
the bathroom</B>
<BR><B>or want something to drink. I was just starting to doze off when
i thought i</B>
<BR><B>saw someone in my grandmothers room. It was a blonde haired girl
who might</B>
<BR><B>have been ten to twelve i have no idea the age i thought i was seeing
things</B>
<BR><B>or that i was just really wiped out and my moms stories where starting
to get</B>
<BR><B>to me. i walked out into our kitchen and my oldest sister was eating
a</B>
<BR><B>sandwich and i told her what i saw she laughed at me and told me
i must have</B>
<BR><B>been dreaming.</B>
<BR><B>I thought maybe she was right because i just never believed what
my mom had</B>
<BR><B>been saying about the girl she had claimed to have seen on several
occasions.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Now here is where i realized i wasn't a complete nut case. I said
before that</B>
<BR><B>the house was very big well my grandmother started screaming&nbsp;
and my sister</B>
<BR><B>and i ran into the room my grandmother was up and headed for the
front door.</B>
<BR><B>She was screaming about fire and the little girl. We could barely
make out</B>
<BR><B>what she was talking about but she kept repeating the little girl
said i was</B>
<BR><B>going to hurt the baby and i have to go before i cause a fire. That
was the</B>
<BR><B>most intelligable sentence that my Grandma had said in a over a
month. my</B>
<BR><B>sister kept saying what little girl and my grandmother said clear
as day the</B>
<BR><B>little blonde haired girl. My grandmother was 72 years old and short
of</B>
<BR><B>hearing she was also three rooms a way when i litterally whispered
this to my</B>
<BR><B>sister. We woke my mom up because we did not know what to do. My
grandmother</B>
<BR><B>ran out of the house and refused to come back in. she stood on our
porch my</B>
<BR><B>parents took her to the hospital and she was placed in a nursing
home because</B>
<BR><B>even the mention of our house sent her into her hysterics. The baby
she was</B>
<BR><B>talking about is my younger brother who is the baby in the family.</B>
<BR><B>My mom decided to turn the house into a one family home again and
had us</B>
<BR><B>kids, there where six of us,</B>
<BR><B>do the work we did not mind as we&nbsp; wanted to help and it was
a good way for</B>
<BR><B>us not to think about my grandmother all the time. My younger sister
and I</B>
<BR><B>would be the only two sharing a room but that was fine as we are
very close</B>
<BR><B>and and we where excited. Again i was up and could not sleep so
i went up to</B>
<BR><B>the room that would be ours, it had been my grandmothers, and i
was scraping</B>
<BR><B>wall paper off the walls with a putty knife. We had started this
project the</B>
<BR><B>night before and i was bored so i went up to get some more done.
I was</B>
<BR><B>scraping the walls and had been doing so for about half an hour
when i heard</B>
<BR><B>a funny noise sounded like the scraping noise i was making with
the knife but</B>
<BR><B>different its hard to explain. I thought some one was playing a
trick on me</B>
<BR><B>so i&nbsp; began to scrape the wall and very quickly i stopped.
However the sound</B>
<BR><B>that i had heard continued and it was the sound of scraping but
it was coming</B>
<BR><B>from across the room. I dont know if whatever was in the room was
mocking me</B>
<BR><B>or playing a game but the scraping kept going on. Whoever or whatever
did not</B>
<BR><B>care that i heard them. I screamed i thought that it was one of
my older</B>
<BR><B>sisters. I ran down the front steps and opened the door and the
house was</B>
<BR><B>completely quiet. Everyone was sound asleep. snoring . I woke up
everyone in</B>
<BR><B>the house i was terrified and i never slept in that room . I would
hear</B>
<BR><B>things in that house until i was eighteen and moved out. As for
our house</B>
<BR><B>restorations. my mother began working on the kitchen and back hallway
that</B>
<BR><B>led to our attic. while doing so she&nbsp; found where the house
had burn marks</B>
<BR><B>and was scorched my mother mentioned this to one of our neighbors
a woman who</B>
<BR><B>had lived on our street from the day she was born in the early 1920's.
Our</B>
<BR><B>house had burnt very badly and been "rebuilt" at that time it had
been</B>
<BR><B>converted to a double. A little girl and her parents lost there
lives in the</B>
<BR><B>fire. My other sisters had things happen to them too. When one of
my older</B>
<BR><B>sisters was looking out of the living room windows something grabbed
her</B>
<BR><B>shoulder and called her name.</B>
<BR><B>One more thing please don't think i am nuts but i have not had this
happen in</B>
<BR><B>any house or apartment i have lived in since and one thing i did
notice that</B>
<BR><B>whatever was in the house was not frightening to me in my youth
but only</B>
<BR><B>became frightening when each of us hit a certain age why i have
no idea. This</B>
<BR><B>was also something I thought that was weird. The little girl was
never</B>
<BR><B>visible upstairs and the woman was only spotted down stairs once.
The</B>
<BR><B>neighbor who was alive when&nbsp; the house caught on fire remembered
that the</B>
<BR><B>little girls name was jessica my mom had been calling her that for
years. and</B>
<BR><B>had never known what the little girls real name was but had just
called her</B>
<BR><B>that because it seemed right.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Baby Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mail@lyon193.fsnet.co.uk</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi</B>
<BR><B>I just thought i'd write to you guys to tell you what happened to
me when I was about about 12-13. I'm from North West England, in a county
called Cheshire. I was staying with my farther in a small village called
Wrenbury, he used to live in a large country house that has been around
for many years, I think (but not certain) that the house in Victorian.
I was staying for the weekend, the house does look spooky but I never felt
any kind of presence there, until sunday afternoon when my farther popped
out to the local store. He was only gone for about 15 mins. It was about
9.30pm and I decided that I needed the toilet, there was a downstair toilet
but that was full of boxes and tools so I had to go up stairs. I walked
up stairs and went to the toilet, after&nbsp; flushing the loo, as the
noise from the loo had gone and I was washing my hands I heard a sound
of a baby crying and screaming, the sound was coming from a nearby bedroom,
this scared me alot because I knew there was nobody in the house, and it
was not coming from outside because the house is stuck in the middle of
nowwhere, just miles of farm fields around. I walked out of the toilet
and headed towards the direction of the crying, as I opened the bedroom
door the sound flew past me, but no one was there! it was almost like the
sound traveled trough me, I was rooted to the spot with complete terror.
I then turned to face the sound, which was now sounding like it was coming
from one of the other bedrooms across the hall, I don't know why, but i&nbsp;
headed to the other room, the crying baby was no really really load, and
i was sure that someone was hurting a baby, (looking back, maybe thats
why I went to see) As I opened the door, I saw something that I will never
forget, There was a baby lieing on the floor but it didn't look right..half
of it's body was stuck in the floor, I could see one of it's legs pointing
out and half of a face, it was wearing old looking clothes, the sound of
the baby was almost deafing, and it looked like someone was hurting it
but no one was there. This was all to much for me and I ran downstairs
and outside into the dark and just waited for my farther to return. I never
told my dad anything - this is the first time I have ever told anyone.
I thought I was going crazy because I have never before belived in ghost.
My father no longer lives there now, but I did go back once when he was
visting a old frined that now lives there, But I never went up them stairs
on my own again!</B>
<BR><B>Well, I just thought maybe you would find that interesting, mail
me back if you wish. Hope you don't think i'm lieing because it was all
very real to me. I am now&nbsp; 20 years old and now I have access to the
internet, I spend my time loooking for other people who have had similar
things happen to them.</B>

<P><B>Asserting your Rights</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Merwynel@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been reading the stories on your site for
a while now and decided to share an experience of my own.&nbsp; I'm afraid
it is not particularly exciting or dramatic, but I feel it's a good example
of the attitude you need to take when dealing with spirits.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been told on more than one occasion, by
people who claimed psychic abilities, that there are spirits present in
my home.&nbsp; This really comes as no huge shock as the core of the house
is a farmhouse that is over one hundred and twenty years old&nbsp; Although
I have never seen a ghost myself, I am very familiar with the sort of chilled
feeling that people describe when they are in the presence of spirits,
it is not truly the same feeling as normal reaction to temperature, but
something that seems more internal, and comes and goes independently of
environmental changes, and I have very commonly experienced this sensation,
usually beginning before someone else remarks about their perceptions of
something "otherworldly".</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several years ago, one summer morning,
I had come home in the early morning from working the night shift.&nbsp;
I was getting undressed for bed, and placed my bedroom door in a three
quarter closed position that I usually keep it in to provide some cross
ventilation.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me explain that my bedroom is a rectangular
room approximately 10 foot wide by 16 foot long&nbsp; There is a set of
double windows on the far end of the room; my bed is crossways in front
of the windows with the head on the longer wall.&nbsp; The door was on
the other end of the room (remodeling has relocated it since then), and
due to irregularities from different additions to the house, there was
an approximate four-inch step down when entering the room from the hallway.
At the time of this incident there was no central air in the house so the
only cooling method was the open windows.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I was getting ready for bed, I saw the
door swing shut, rather firmly from the three quarter position.&nbsp; At
first I dismissed this as just being the breeze, as I was feeling a slightly
chilled feeling on what was a rather warm morning, even though I didn't
really notice much in the way of air current.&nbsp; I was very tired and
somewhat groggy and only wished to get to bed as soon as possible.&nbsp;
I put my door back into the position I had had it in and went back to getting
ready for bed. Almost immediately the door swung shut again very firmly.
Even though I still really did not notice a breeze, the door swung quite
freely on its hinges, and I did not think much of the fact that it kept
shutting.&nbsp; I then took one of my work boots, the common style most
everyone is familiar with that laces up about nine inches above the ankle,
and placed it with the toe section underneath the door and the heel towards
the doorway, and repositioned the door to the three quarter position I
wanted it to be in. Moments later the door drug the boot across the carpeted
floor, and closed as far as it could with the boot in the way.&nbsp; Now
at that pint I realized that there was certainly no breeze present that
could exert that amount of force, and the "chill" I was experiencing was
not the normal environmental kind, nor was it in any way cold enough that
morning for me to be experiencing a normal chill.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I am not a person who likes to have
his sleep interfered with, nor do I particularly like to have my plans,
of any kind, thwarted.&nbsp; Besides, all of my reading and conversations
regarding the supernatural and hauntings have always indicated that you
have to assert your rights to control your domain when challenged by spirits.&nbsp;
With this in mind, I grabbed up a heavy (approximately 12 lbs.) "Thor"
hammer I had cast from aluminum years before in shop class, and placed
the head of it underneath the door, with the handle sticking up between
the door and the doorway.&nbsp; Stepping back I then witnessed the door
drag this heavy hammer (12 LBS!!!) across the floor the same way it had
my boot, until again the door was as far shut as it could be without actually
removing the hammer from underneath it.&nbsp; At that point, becoming somewhat
angry, I took the hammer out from underneath the door, placed the door
into a two-thirds closed position (slightly more open than I really wanted)
and waited.&nbsp; Within seconds the door started to shut again.&nbsp;
At this point I pointed at the door and said loudly and firmly "NO!”&nbsp;
The door stopped moving and stayed perfectly still.&nbsp; I stood there
for a few moments longer watching the door and it did not move again.&nbsp;
I then said "thank you" and went on to bed.&nbsp; I think it is important
for people to understand that in most cases of encountering a spirit in
your home, you simply have to assert your right to be master of your home.&nbsp;
I can't promise that it will always be the complete answer in all cases,
but I believe it to be the best way to begin with dealing with a disagreement
with a spirit in your home.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Queen Anne Style Home</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: auntjulie57@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Many years ago, my family and I lived in a lovely Queen Anne style
home. We lived in it for thirteen years, eleven of which we experienced
paranormal phenomea.&nbsp; Two years after we moved in we had our first
of many&nbsp; odd occurences.&nbsp; My daughter was in the kitchen and
I was upstairs when I heard her call out that the upstairs toilet must
have overflowed because water was running down the outside of the staircase.&nbsp;
I ran to the top of the stairs in barefeet only to feel water on the surface
of the carpeting.&nbsp; I looked over the top of the railing to assure
her that the toilet hadn't overflowed and that was when I felt the wetness
on my feet,&nbsp; but there were no water pipes in that part of the house.&nbsp;
When I got down the stairs I found water running in rivelets down the wooden
molding.&nbsp; My daughter reached up to turn on the light under the stairway
alcove and as soon as she did the water stopped.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had to
wipe the trom down and we never found any reason for that activity.&nbsp;
Months later while preparing for bed one night I heard footsteps running
down the attic stairs. The door crashed againts the opposite wall and then
nothing.&nbsp; I was terrified thinking that someone was there. they would
have to pass my room to get downstairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; But nothing happened.&nbsp;
When we finally went to look,the door was against the wall.&nbsp; we even
thought that maybe a ball had bounced down the stairs sounding like footsteps
but there was nothing.&nbsp; Strangely when we started to think our house
had unseen guests we were no longer frightened.&nbsp; As time passed we
had many more experiences; I heard a women crying softly but pitifully,
two of my daughters saw images of old fashioned children dressed in long
white nightgowns and "mob"caps. A visitor to my house saw the same thing
and asked me "who the little girl"was.&nbsp; On another occasion my nephew
was spending the night and thought he saw me standing at the top of the
stairs in a long white old fashioned nightgown and then supposedly I went
down the stairs and didn't come back.&nbsp; My nephew was sixteen at the
time and we hadn't told him about the house.&nbsp; My husband thought we
were all crazy because he didn't believe in this sort of thing.&nbsp; My
daghter came home late one night and was just lying in bed going over her
evening and looked up to see a male figure suspended over the bed and as
she watched the image dissolved from the bottom up as if it were sand falling.&nbsp;
There were other things that happened there although nothing dangerous
and finally we sold the house and moved on.&nbsp; It was several years
after we moved from the house that we met a family that had lived there
years before we did and had very similar things happen to them, but they
said their experiences were very frightening and mean spirited.&nbsp; I
some times think our "guests moved with us because from time time, we still
get verystrange sensations in our present victorian home.</B><B></B>

the people who had lived in it before left ALL their stuff behind, my friend

that stuff and she has a bed, TV and nintendo down there and last week
i was alone there and playing her nimntendo and she was up stairs fighting
with her mom cause she didnt do the laundrey, anyways i was down there
and i heard a growl coming from the second bedroom (this is the haunted
room cause its very cold and i swear youre watched as you walk in and out
of it) and this growl came from that room and i ran upstairs and my friend
said i looked absolutely terrified beyond all reason and that whatever
it was that i heard it was real..so anyways, later that night we were watching
a movie (american pie 2 so theres no reason to get giddy and scared) and
it felt like we were being watched and that it was glaring i knew it was
there but i wasnt frightened cause i wasnt going to let it bother me this
time and it went away but my friend was scared out of her mind, shes very
religious so she was praying and stuff, and im not so i wasnt doing anything
but ignoring it, anyways the moment i walked in that house i knew it was
there, anyways lately her mom and her have been getting scratches on their
legs and backs from finger nails because theyre thick, deep and they dont
stop bleeding...anyways neerby theres an abandoned house and love it cause
its big so i wanted to go visit it and we went over and theres was no lights
and i saw an orb so we ran away and i hate that house now...my next story
isnt my own but rather my sisters and brother in law, they moved in here
cause of reasons about 6 months ago and my house is/was haunted by two
ghosts, not sure what happened, but sometimes they come back, one did six
months ago, 'R' my brother in law heard growls under our deck and my sister
and him saw a light fly by his head, anyways 'R' is freaked out about my
house...when 'R' and my sister lived in their own house i was in the basement
drawing on the walls i felt something staring at me and i started to run
up the sairs and it chased me and before then i was with my sister at a
house my sisters friend was housesitting and my sister was looking around
and all three of us were chased out of the house by that ghost and even
earlier, when i was 11 and we first moved into this house i saw two ghosts
in my bedroom doorway and when i was 6-7 years old i saw some thing knock
my clothes off the end of my bed and i have short legs so it couldnt have
been me and i looked over the edge and i saw something with red eyes and
the next morning i saw my lego house i had built on the floor in front
of my bed had been broken....oh i just remembered, about a month ago i
had gotten a new dresser and nightstand and bed from my mothers friend
and her cat died about two years ago anyways i walked into my room with
the light off and i heard a cat meow and rub against my bed and i turned
on the light and there was nothing there :)&nbsp; most of them arent scary
and i hope for more, thanks for reading this and im sorry if its boring

<P><B>Abandoned House in Illinois</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: CDYAJ@prodigy.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>There is an old abandoned house outside Catlin, IL.&nbsp; The story
is there was a man who lived there.&nbsp; He had a young wife and two kids.&nbsp;
The father grew drugs, sold them, and even smoked them.&nbsp; He was high
on crake and his heart gave out.. causing him to have a heart attack.&nbsp;
Now, I have gone there many times to scope the place out.&nbsp; From my
experiences, I have saw (and heard) the man walking up the stairs. He wears
boots and neglects to tie them up, so they clonk on the stairs quite loudly.&nbsp;
I have also come in contact with a ghost dog.&nbsp; The dog walks out of
nowhere from the field next to the house.&nbsp; It has completely black
eyes and followed me to the house and even inside. When i started up the
stairs it turned around with its tail between its legs and walked out of
the house.&nbsp; There are cold spots, strange noises, constant feeling
of being watched, and yes there are ghosts. It is on private property,
but if you really want to check it you, turn your lights off before entering
the driveway.&nbsp; It is a two story yellow house with a pond next to
it.&nbsp; The driveway contains old cars and such.&nbsp; I just wanted
to post this story because not many people are aware of it.&nbsp; Thanks
for your time.</B>

<P><B>A Voice</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: snottymcsnoot@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is the second time that I have written to you.</B>
<BR><B>The first story was a little scarrier, but this one</B>
<BR><B>was intense, none the less. I am currently 21, at the</B>
<BR><B>time this happened I was 20. I was at my friends house</B>
<BR><B>(Keep in mind that I did at one time live there with</B>
<BR><B>her). While living there nothing really happened. We</B>
<BR><B>had an incident of catching someone looking through</B>
<BR><B>our doors and windows. Anyway, I will explain the</B>
<BR><B>relevance of that momentarialy. She (my friend) went</B>
<BR><B>to the store to buy something real quick, and then my</B>
<BR><B>boyfriend went to his car because he forgot his cell</B>
<BR><B>phone. I went to the bathroom, then came back into the</B>
<BR><B>living room. I occasionally felt uncomfortable in that</B>
<BR><B>house, before and after living there. As I went to sit</B>
<BR><B>down on the couch and wait for them, I distinctly</B>
<BR><B>heard my name Spoken in a slight whisper. Not once,</B>
<BR><B>but three times. I was freaked. It was coming from the</B>
<BR><B>patio,</B>
<BR><B>but the blinds were open and no one was there. I stood</B>
<BR><B>there, completely scared. By the time that my</B>
<BR><B>boyfriend came back I shaking. I asked him if he had</B>
<BR><B>called my name out, and he said no. I knew he was</B>
<BR><B>telling the truth, because I am a big scaredy-cat</B>
<BR><B>(yes, even now) and he would have told me the truth. I</B>
<BR><B>still get goosebumps thinking about it. I know what I</B>
<BR><B>heard, and it scred me to death. What is odd, is that</B>
<BR><B>this "man" that we continually saw, was never caught</B>
<BR><B>by police. And believe me, we called them more than</B>
<BR><B>once. The longer I lived there the more I noticed that</B>
<BR><B>our stuff disapearred, and that I never felt "alone"</B>
<BR><B>when i was by myself. The thing is, He was never</B>
<BR><B>translucent or anything. I don't know if he was real,</B>
<BR><B>or not. But we saw him more than once. (well enough to</B>
<BR><B>give a police discription). I began feeling incredibly</B>
<BR><B>unsafe , ghost or no ghost, and moved out. I don't</B>
<BR><B>know if he was connected or not, but I know what I</B>
<BR><B>heard that night.</B><B></B>

<P><B>A Visit From My Dad</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: JATgtrman@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is the true story of my very personal experience. I have only
relayed this experience to a few very close friends and family members.
I am still after many years not sure how to classify this experience, only
that it actually happened.</B>
<BR><B>Background:</B>
<BR><B>I grew up as the only son of very traditional Sicilian immigrants
with very "old school" family values. Born in Philadelphia in 1951, I was
a teenager during the 1960's, and like many city kids during that era,
my world was made up of rock and roll, long hair, and protesting against
tradition and indulging in almost anything that would un-nerve my parents.</B>
<BR><B>The Turning Point:</B>
<BR><B>Much to the chagrin of my Dad, I decided to pursue a career as a
professional musician. This unfortunately drove a wedge between us which
lasted for many years. My dad and I spoke, but only in the most cordial
manner, never really communicating. For the first ten years of my post-adolescent
life, he refused to even visit me. Then one day, February 3, 1983 to be
exact, my father paid me a totally unexpected visit at my home by himself.
This was something he'd never done before. That day, we talked - really
talked for the first time in years. He admitted to me that he was wrong
in his evaluation of me as a kid growing up, and that if he had it to do
over again he would have been a very different kind of "dad". We had finally
made "peace" with each other, and for the first time in my life saw him
not as "my Dad", but as a good but flawed person who, for better or worse,
did the best he could with his life for his family. I didn't know it at
the time, but that was the last time that I would see him or speak with</B>
<BR><B>The Visit:</B>
<BR><B>During the weeks that followed, most of my energy was consumed helping
my Mom through the grieving process and assisting her in getting my Dad's
affairs in order. Being "old school" in their thinking, they didn't believe
in keeping valuables in traditional ways. Instead, my Dad used to hide
things of importance throughout the house in his "secret" places known
only to himself. On March 18th, 1983, my fathers birthday, I was sound
asleep at my home in New Jersey with my first wife. My daughters who were
3 years old and 8 months old at that time were asleep in their room. About
1 AM I awoke suddenly as though startled. As I sat up in my bed, and I
saw a figure standing at the foot of my bed. It was my Dad. I saw him as
clearly as if he were still alive. He said nothing, but motioned as if
he wanted me to follow him someplace. I went place my feet onto the floor
next to my bed, but instead of being in my room, I found myself standing
at the top of the basement stairs in my parents house in Philadelphia.
I began</B>
<BR><B>The Evidence:</B>
<BR><B>The next morning, I asked a friend to come with me to my parents
house to help me look around the basement. When we arrived there, my Mom
said that she was feeling exceptionally tired that day and she had a very
restless night. My friend and myself went down to the basement and proceeded
to look around. Suddenly, I found myself staring at a heating duct that
ran along the ceiling in the same corner that I saw my Dad point to when
I realized that that particular duct ran into a solid wall and couldn't
possibly serve any function. I slipped the duct away from the main heating
system and discovered that the duct was a "dummy" and was really connected
to the heating system at all. In that "dummy" duct found many of the items
that had been missing since my father's death. I will not mention the items
that I found in that duct since they were actually more personal than valuable
and have no real relevance to this story. However, I will say that we discovered
certain things that I never knew my father had. These ite the coin was
1914. The very year that my Dad was born.</B>
<BR><B>Conclusion:</B>
<BR><B>Up until that time in my life, I had considered myself to be an
agnostic not really believing or disbelieving in God or in an afterlife.
Although I still don't hold to any organized religious beliefs, I have
changed in my belief of the afterlife, and no longer doubt the existence
of a supreme being.</B>
<BR><B>I would welcome any and all serious comments on my experience and
I would like to know if anyone else has had a similar experience. Thanks.</B><B></B>

<P><B>A True Haunted House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: FERRETGIRL82@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi my name is Michelle and I am 19 years old.&nbsp; When I was eleven
years old, I used to live in Mt.Vernon, Washington.&nbsp; I currently live
in Temecula, CA.&nbsp; When I used to live in Washington, my parents, brother
and I rented a home in the countryside.&nbsp; Before we actually moved
in, the people renting us the home told us that the woman's mother had
died from a sickly disease in the living room.&nbsp; They also notified
us that her husband had built that house especially for her on their anniversary.&nbsp;
It was not until about six months into living in the house, did things
start to really happen.&nbsp; However, things only happened to my mother
and I.&nbsp; First were the small things, the heater always breaking down,
doors and windows being unlocked when we locked them, and cool breezes
brushing by us when we were just sitting down.&nbsp; But there were a few
horrifying things that happened to myself and m That night I did end up
sleeping with my parents.&nbsp; The piano used to play by itself and I
would always see shadows at night.&nbsp; Lastly, the day that we moved
back to California, my brother and I were playing video games while my
parents were gone.&nbsp; My dog was in my lap and all of a sudden we heard
a ripping noise and my dog propped her head up towards where our moving
boxes were.&nbsp; My brother went over to the box and there was a peice
of ripped cardboard lying next to it.&nbsp; I will take it to the grave
that that house was haunted.&nbsp; No one could pay me to sleep in that
house ever again.&nbsp; Ever since then, I will always believe that spirits
walk around with us here on earth.&nbsp; Maybe not ghosts, but the dead
who have gotten caught realilty and the afterlife.&nbsp; Thank you.</B>

<BR><B>A Poem "Ghostly Visitor"</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dear_cheryll@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Darkness surrounds me as I awake from slumber,</B>
<BR><B>Fear takes hold as my exhaustion crumbles.</B>
<BR><B>The still room grows cold and my breath takes form,</B>
<BR><B>As a woman appears whose flesh in not adorned.</B>
<BR><B>The smell of flowers and the sound of laughter fill my mind,</B>
<BR><B>As the room transforms to an era of another place in time.</B>
<BR><B>Daylight's bright rays shine through the sheer white drapes,</B>
<BR><B>A&nbsp; story unfolds of this lady's fate.</B>
<BR><B>She stands by the window with a smile upon her face,</B>
<BR><B>As the wind blows her hair with dancing grace.</B>
<BR><B>A baritone voice vibrates the white washed walls,</B>
<BR><B>And heavy cumbrous footsteps begin to fall.</B>
<BR><B>She turns suddenly to face the door,</B>
<BR><B>Terrified she screams and yells, "No more!"</B>
<BR><B>Nothing can stop this bane man from doing,</B>
<BR><B>As then I hear a baby's cooing.</B>
<BR><B>I jump from the bed in which I rest,</B>
<BR><B>A mirror reflects my night of dress.</B>
<BR><B>The face I see is not possibly mine,</B>
<BR><B>I run to the baby so little time.</B>
<BR><B>The door slowly creaks open, the wrath is here.</B>
<BR><B>The woman stands alone pulsating with fear.</B>
<BR><B>Then all grows dark in my room once more,</B>
<BR><B>And woeful footsteps fall to the floor.</B>
<BR><B>An unseen hand reaches out from a bend in space,</B>
<BR><B>Gentle, obscure touches sweetly cover my face.</B>
<BR><B>My heart races and beats wildly against my chest,</B>
<BR><B>Lying here helplessly through this ghostly caress.</B>
<BR><B>~Cheryl Lynn Holt</B>
<BR><B>Most of the experiences I've had are similar if not the same as
the stories</B>
<BR><B>I've read so I would basicly</B>
<BR><B>be reapeating.&nbsp; The ghosts in my house are playful and yet
like to tease.</B>
<BR><B>At times have been very helpful like waking me up so I won't be
late for</B>
<BR><B>work.&nbsp; I have 3 ghosts.&nbsp; I've seen the little girl twice,
and have heard the</B>
<BR><B>woman and man talking.&nbsp; One time after getting out of the shower
I went to</B>
<BR><B>reach for my night clothes,</B>
<BR><B>which were not where I left them.&nbsp; At first I was confused
as to where I was</B>
<BR><B>wondering if I really did grab them, but when I went back to my
dresser to</B>
<BR><B>get more clothes, my top drawer which holds my socks and panties,
had my</B>
<BR><B>night clothes crumpled and stuffed in it.&nbsp; I too hear footsteps,
and doors</B>
<BR><B>closing when I'm the only one home and have seen small black shadows
darting</B>
<BR><B>from the kitchen.&nbsp; However the house I live isn't the only
house that's been</B>
<BR><B>occupied by ghosts.&nbsp; Every house I have lived in has had ghosts!!&nbsp;
Which</B>
<BR><B>means I have lots of stories.&nbsp; So I pretty much understand
why they're here</B>
<BR><B>by living with them and reading about them.&nbsp; What I don't understand
is if</B>
<BR><B>I'm so comfortable with living with them why in my dreams am I&nbsp;
so terrified</B>
<BR><B>of them?&nbsp; Between having haunted dreams and constant dreams
of tornadoes, I</B>
<BR><B>wonder if it's all connected?&nbsp; Anyway, I love this site and
love the 1st of</B>
<BR><B>the month for the new stories to come in.</B><B></B>

<P><B>A Haunting Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: zjwebb09@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Zach and I have always
beleived myself to be a level headed</B>
<BR><B>person.</B>
<BR><B>I have just turned 21 and serve in the US Army so I'm not crazy.
I have</B>
<BR><B>always been fascinated by the conception of ghosts, monsters, and
other creatures and had</B>
<BR><B>often gone to places just to try and have a paranormal experience.
Sadly I</B>
<BR><B>never found one. Until about a year ago. I have always heard of
certain people maybe being</B>
<BR><B>actually followed by a ghost or spirit or something of that nature
but had never known</B>
<BR><B>anybody to have. Well about mid summer of last year some weird stuff
started to</B>
<BR><B>happen that certainly I could not explain and I was hoping you could
help me with this.</B>
<BR><B>The first night I actually had something happen really scared the
hell out of me. I</B>
<BR><B>live way out in the country of Tennessee where it is good and dark
at night. Well one</B>
<BR><B>night me and my girlfriend were leaving the house late. She had
gone ahead of</B>
<BR><B>me to the truck. As I was walking out I was looking at the ground(I
have a bad habit of always</B>
<BR><B>looking at the ground when I walk) going to the truck and I happen
to look up</B>
<BR><B>in time to catch a glimpse of what looked like someone was standing
in front</B>
<BR><B>of me. Well I couldn't stop in time and actually bumped into something
that</B>
<BR><B>stopped me in my tracks. At the time I thought my girl had stopped
for some</B>
<BR><B>reason and like I said, it was pitch black and I couldn't see a
thing. I</B>
<BR><B>called out to her and asked her why she had stopped and about the
same time</B>
<BR><B>she opened the truck door several feet in front of me and replyed
that she</B>
<BR><B>had not. The light from the truck gave us some room to see and I
saw that</B>
<BR><B>there was noone in front of me. Naturally I told her get the hell
in the</B>
<BR><B>truck and hauled it out of there. I soon forgot about the instance
and then</B>
<BR><B>something else weird happened. I started staying at my sister and</B>
<BR><B>brother-in-laws house for a few days and always like to stay up
late on the</B>
<BR><B>computer. Well it was late one night, about 2AM. My sister and her
husband</B>
<BR><B>were already in bed and I was coming downstairs from the computer
to get</B>
<BR><B>something to drink. Well as soon as my foot hit the bottom step
I all of a</B>
<BR><B>sudden heard something I couldn't explain at the time. After I thought
for a</B>
<BR><B>minute I figured it sounded like a bunch of people whispering right
in my ear</B>
<BR><B>at once. Just one voice stood out from the rest but I couldn't make
out what</B>
<BR><B>any of it said. Well at first I thought my brother-in-law was up
for some</B>
<BR><B>reason and I had heard him talking. But a quick examination of the
house</B>
<BR><B>revealed that the both of them were still asleep in the bed. That
was</B>
<BR><B>especially freaky considering I was all by myself in the damn dark.
Now I am</B>
<BR><B>not crazy. I have not once before, or since heard any kind of voices.
I wish</B>
<BR><B>I had paid better attention and had understood what he said. But
it all only</B>
<BR><B>lasted a second. It was just a rush of voices whispering then one
louder</B>
<BR><B>voice then it was gone. Quicker then I could get my other foot on
the ground.</B>
<BR><B>But I know I heard em. The last thing that actually happened wasn't
as scary</B>
<BR><B>as the first two. I was over at a friends house. One of the people
had a</B>
<BR><B>camera and they were taking pictures. Well in every picture that
I was in</B>
<BR><B>there was some kind of light. Kind of light what painted raindrops
would look</B>
<BR><B>like but they were actually rays of light. The first two pictures
taken they</B>
<BR><B>were over my head. The last picture it was different. I was sitting
on a</B>
<BR><B>couch and in the background there was this single ball of light.
Now I know</B>
<BR><B>what your thinking cause everybody I told asked these same things
so I'll go</B>
<BR><B>ahead and answer them now. No there were no overhead lamps or anything
like</B>
<BR><B>that. The only lights that were on were a few table lamps and one
stand up</B>
<BR><B>lamp in the other corner. And also the two pictures that showed
the light</B>
<BR><B>over my head were both taken in seperate rooms. And in the other
one there</B>
<BR><B>was no light in the other room where the ball of light was on. And
I would</B>
<BR><B>have thought that maybe the pictures just got screwed up but no
other ones</B>
<BR><B>showed up like that. But I don't know. Maybe they did. I am just
telling you</B>
<BR><B>all that I know and remember. The last thing that I want to mention
and I</B>
<BR><B>will stop because I am sure you are a busy man. Now I am a avid
Christian and</B>
<BR><B>do not believe in whitchcraft, dark spells, quiji boards, and other
dark</B>
<BR><B>things other than tools of Satan. But like any idiot my curiosity
got the</B>
<BR><B>better of me and me and a couple of friends decided to try using
a quiji</B>
<BR><B>board one night not long after all of this had happened. Moreover
I don't</B>
<BR><B>know if those things really do work for real or not. I have no clue.
But the</B>
<BR><B>stuff that came up that night was pretty freaky for something that
was just a</B>
<BR><B>game. We started the game and the girl that owned the board was
asking the</B>
<BR><B>questions. She asked if anybody was there with us and the pointer
moved to</B>
<BR><B>yes(once again I stress that I don't know about these things and
if it was</B>
<BR><B>her moving it just slightly enough and your laughing your ass off
at me just</B>
<BR><B>tell me I'm an idiot and I'll get over it). Well she asked a few
more</B>
<BR><B>questions but she really wanted to know what that stuff was that
had happened</B>
<BR><B>to me. So she asked the "spirit" if there was someone that was following
me.</B>
<BR><B>Naturally the pointer moved to yes. At this point she let me ask
the</B>
<BR><B>questions. Now I can't remember all that I asked but I do remember
a few</B>
<BR><B>things. I asked why it was following me and the pointer spelled
that only I</B>
<BR><B>know why. Then I asked if I was in any kind of danger. The only
thing it</B>
<BR><B>would say was that I was a danger to myself(this really hit home
with my</B>
<BR><B>friends cause they know that I drive balls to the walls, 90 to nothing,
like</B>
<BR><B>I am racing in the Daytona 500 or something). We asked a few more
questions</B>
<BR><B>but none that I can really recall accurately. Needless to say I
was spooked</B>
<BR><B>for the rest of the night. Since then I have had no other incidents.
Have not</B>
<BR><B>seen, heard, or felt another thing. But if you happen to know any
of this or</B>
<BR><B>any of this sounds familiar could youi please e-mail me back and
let me know.</B>
<BR><B>I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks for your time.</B><B></B>

<P><B>A Few Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kcziemba@household.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Good afternoon!. I have to say that I love your website. It;s nice
to know</B>
<BR><B>that others experience things that are out of the "ordinary" and
tend to</B>
<BR><B>have no explanation. I have been open to things of the supernatural
for</B>
<BR><B>quite some time. My girlfriend and I just recently began getting
on the</B>
<BR><B>topic of things of this nature through some recent discussions and
and</B>
<BR><B>confessions and I thought I'd share some things with you.</B>
<BR><B>I have to say that my mother is probably the door to receiving supernatural</B>
<BR><B>contact. My mom has always had an old woman who would come to her
to</B>
<BR><B>deliver news. She never spoke, however she always wore a hooded
cloak and</B>
<BR><B>when the hood was over her head, some bad news was on the way. When
her</B>
<BR><B>head and face was uncovered, expect some good news.&nbsp; My parents
have had</B>
<BR><B>supernatural occurances over the last 30+ years. My father, never
beleived</B>
<BR><B>a stitch of it. My mom used to dabble with the Ouija board however
she</B>
<BR><B>scared herself away from it. So I figure she is the reason that
I am able</B>
<BR><B>to experience what I have.</B>
<BR><B>Here is my first experience I;d like to share. When I was about
11 a very</B>
<BR><B>close friend of mine's father had passed.(I have been friends with
this</B>
<BR><B>family for about 20 years). We had returned from the services and
we stayed</B>
<BR><B>at their house so everyone could be together. It was late in the
evening</B>
<BR><B>and I was staying in my friends room in the spare bed. Everyone
in the</B>
<BR><B>house was asleep and I awoke with having to go to the bathroom.
There were</B>
<BR><B>two bathrooms in the home, one directly across from the room I was
in, and</B>
<BR><B>one downstairs across from the kitchen. I got out of bed and proceeded
to</B>
<BR><B>the bathroom downstairs for some unknow reason. I reached the bottom
of the</B>
<BR><B>stairs and stopped in my tracks. In the kitchen was Michaels father.
He was</B>
<BR><B>dressed in the suit he was buried in and had the jacket unbuttoned
and his</B>
<BR><B>hands in his pants pockets. He was looking at me and smiling and
he had a</B>
<BR><B>sort of glow to him. Nothing was spoken, however I distinctly remember
how</B>
<BR><B>warm I felt and I was not in any way scared. I just stood there.
I closed</B>
<BR><B>my eyes and opened them again, and he was gone. I never did go to
the</B>
<BR><B>bathroom!! I merely went back to bed.</B>
<BR><B>Another experience I had was when I was around 16. My mother was
a fan of</B>
<BR><B>going to antique shops and happened upon one this one afternoon.
She had</B>
<BR><B>picked up a sterling silver utensil set (knives, forks, spoons etc)
and</B>
<BR><B>this old shaving bowl. Delighted she picked up the items and brought
them</B>
<BR><B>home. She had placed them in a rubbermaid tub in the kitchen and
began the</B>
<BR><B>process of cleaning them. My parents and I went out to dinner that
evening</B>
<BR><B>and when we returned the bathroom was covered in shaving cream!!!!</B>
<BR><B>Interesting! We figured someone had broken in and played a joke.
the mess</B>
<BR><B>was cleaned up and we were more puzzled that someone would break
in with</B>
<BR><B>the 115 lb siberian husky loyaly patrolling the house. We all retired
to</B>
<BR><B>bed that evening and I awoke for school the next morning. Being
the first</B>
<BR><B>one up I hit the kitchen for some cereal and low and behold, shaving
cream</B>
<BR><B>all over the kitchen, silverware, and the shaving bowl, and the
can of</B>
<BR><B>shaving cream was on the counter!!! I woke up my parents to show
them. Now</B>
<BR><B>World War three could go on outside my dad;s ear when he slept,
however a</B>
<BR><B>pin drop woke him up. The shaving cream was in the bathroom which
was</B>
<BR><B>through my parents room. Someone would have had to break in, dodge
the dog,</B>
<BR><B>steal nothing, walk through my parents room to get a can of shaving
cream,</B>
<BR><B>go back through their bedroom, and then into the kitchen, do the
task, and</B>
<BR><B>then put it back without waking a soul. Ladies and gentleman, we
have a</B>
<BR><B>ghost. My mom promptly put the articles outside in the shed. The
next day,</B>
<BR><B>I opened the padlocked shed, to find my dirt bike and tools, covered
in</B>
<BR><B>shaving cream!!!!!! My mom tried to return the stuff back to the
place</B>
<BR><B>where she bought it, the guy had packed up shop!!!!</B>
<BR><B>I happened to have an experience on shades of death road on Ghost
lake of a</B>
<BR><B>white cloudy ball however that will be in another email!!</B>
<BR><B>Since all of these events my father, and two of my best friends
have passed</B>
<BR><B>on. I see them rather frequently in my dreams and talk to them often
as I</B>
<BR><B>would if they were physically in front of me. That has never spooked
me,</B>
<BR><B>however seeing an apparition almost made me soil my shorts.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for listening and I love the site!! It;s good to know that
we're not</B>

<P><B>A Cousins Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kelly1perez@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi!!!!!!!!!!! This is a little story about my cousin and her experience
when she was a smalle girl. She is now a profesional model and she's from
my mother's side. Well I know this is true since my aunt is so...delicate
about these things she got all histeric when this happened and took my
cousin to a pycothic (how do u say that?). She saw leprechans. Yeah those
little green guys with jacket! She said that they went up the wall like
they where walking normaly!!!! And that was not 1 night, it continued until
her mother got to doc. (really she was little and she would not invent
things like this!!!! AAAAAnd her mother was not the type who read her bedtimestories)
sOMETIMEs THEY WOULD PUT DUNG IN HER FOOD (like visiones) or throw things
at her when she was alone. So that was so depressing that they moved and
nothing like that happened again. The....the doc told us that leprechans
MUST exist because they've put examens on children that had seen leprechans
and the scientific explanation is: Children and see in two dimensiones
and three at the same time, so really leprechans (personally im not worried
i really kinda don't belive the story...) do exist.....thanks</B>

<BR><B>3 Events</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ettan5@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>A dream of reality</B>
<BR><B>This is nothing special, not even the first of its kind on your
site. But</B>
<BR><B>it's true and should be told. When I was around 4 or 5, I was very
close</B>
<BR><B>with a cousin on my mother's side. He is only 8 months older than
me and we</B>
<BR><B>saw a lot of each other back then. One night I dreamt that he was
very sad,</B>
<BR><B>his arm hurt and he was crying and sitting on a stretcher with a
doctor in</B>
<BR><B>front of him and his mother by his side. Then, later in the day,
when mum</B>
<BR><B>was in the garden watering the rosebushes, I told her about the
dream. She</B>
<BR><B>remembers this too because a few hours later grandmother rang and
told her</B>
<BR><B>that my cousin had broken his collar bone and had been to the doctor.
That</B>
<BR><B>hasn't happened since even though he has had a number of accidents
and</B>
<BR><B>misfortunes. Then again, we are not as close anymore.</B>
<BR><B>Dad grew up on a small farm</B>
<BR><B>My father grew up on a small farm, where a man had hanged himself
on the</B>
<BR><B>hayloft in the stables. One day when he was out there playing on
his own he</B>
<BR><B>heard the ceiling (the floor of the hayloft) creak with walking
and looked</B>
<BR><B>up. Because the boards were old he could tell exactly where the
person who</B>
<BR><B>walked on the hayloft went, the boards were sagging with the person's</B>
<BR><B>weight. He didn't get scared because he thought it was his sister
and her</B>
<BR><B>friend that played a trick on him, then, as the steps had almost
reached the</B>
<BR><B>wall, he remembered that the ladder up was broken, the first steps
were</B>
<BR><B>missing, and so his little sister couldn't get up there. So he raced
to the</B>
<BR><B>ladder and got up just as the steps reached the wall and stopped.
Presumbly</B>
<BR><B>where the man once hanged himself. As he peered over the edge he
could see</B>
<BR><B>the whole hayloft because they didn't have any hay, nor anything
else stored</B>
<BR><B>up there, and there was no one to be seen. Other than that I have</B>
<BR><B>recollections of him, his siblings and his mother talking about
strange</B>
<BR><B>lights that would follow you home, strange shadows of a man (smoking
a pipe)</B>
<BR><B>in the attic, a cat that got locked up there once and never again
went there</B>
<BR><B>and a woman in black standing out in the snow without leaving a
footprint</B>
<BR><B>behind. When they sold the farm the new owners tore the old stables
building</B>
<BR><B>down.</B>
<BR><B>Small events in a new house</B>
<BR><B>My parent's second house was brand new and part of a newly built
area. It</B>
<BR><B>had stood empty for about 6 months before they moved in because
the company</B>
<BR><B>that built it went bankrupt and probably it took some time to settle
the</B>
<BR><B>affairs. But despite this dad would hear someone walking in the
corridor</B>
<BR><B>between the TV room and my bedroom. I wasn't even two at the time
and had a</B>
<BR><B>bed I had just learnt how to climb out of, but not into, and dad
presumed it</B>
<BR><B>was me. But when I never came he went to see where I was found me
asleep and</B>
<BR><B>no one in the house. He got used to this. Then a couple of times
he would</B>
<BR><B>hear mum come home, open the front door and come up the stairs,
without</B>
<BR><B>coming until about a quarter later. It didn't bother him much and
mum never</B>
<BR><B>saw anything. Since there were no previous owner, could it have
been that</B>
<BR><B>some spirits that resided there got upset when the whole area became</B>
<BR><B>populated all at once? Who knows, would be interesting to talk to
some of</B>
<BR><B>the other people that moved into the houses around at the same time.
We</B>
<BR><B>didn't live there for long because my parent's wanted to move closer
to</B>
<BR><B>their work places, not because they were scared out.</B>
<BR><B>A question I would love to have one of you try to answer:</B>
<BR><B>If you have any psychic ability at all, no matter how small, can
it grow</B>
<BR><B>stronger and weaker in the same month? Or is that a sure sign of
an</B>
<BR><B>overheated imagination? I am terribly afraid of the dark (but if
I am alone</B>
<BR><B>in the daytime as well) some times and then some other days I just
shrug</B>
<BR><B>most of it off. That's just the thing, if I knew for certain that
I can't</B>
<BR><B>actually feel spirits, I could just decide not to be afraid of the
dark, but</B>
<BR><B>since I am not certain I analyze my fear of the dark as a real feeling
that</B>
<BR><B>there might be something supernatural around. True, I did dream
the first</B>
<BR><B>story, and I did see that girl in the playground, but those happened
when I</B>
<BR><B>was very young and I think probably all children can see spirits.
Then there</B>
<BR><B>was that time when I was 15 and I knew what had happend to some
missing</B>
<BR><B>fisher men. But that was very vague and may be coincidence. Actually
one</B>
<BR><B>other time as well, but just as vague, easy to dismiss if you want
to. So,</B>
<BR><B>is it possible to have your ability increasing and decreasing at
times, or</B>
<BR><B>are you always sensitive or not? I shouldn't lie to you, I see from
what I</B>
<BR><B>have written so far anyway that it shines through that I would wish
I could,</B>
<BR><B>that there was some ration behind my fright of the dark or being
alone. That</B>
<BR><B>maybe it would be... fun? to be able to see ghosts. But it's better
to know</B>
<BR><B>the truth anyway, I can generally deal with the truth better than
with</B>
<BR><B>make-believe.</B>

<P><B>2 Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Winterkitten@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;I am very into ghosts, my house is haunted by two, Anne (a
little girl</B>
<BR><B>that hides by the closet in my bedroom) and a grandma ghost. However,
my</B>
<BR><B>sister Crystal and I are really into this sort of thing and she
has taught me</B>
<BR><B>everything she knows about ghosts and spirits and the like. Well
here is my</B>
<BR><B>story:</B>
<BR><B>It was early in the morning, about 6:40 AM or so. I was laying in
bed. In</B>
<BR><B>order for you to understand my position, you have to understand
this: I have</B>
<BR><B>no headboard on my bed, and the door is behind my head. So that
when you walk</B>
<BR><B>in my door the first thing you see is the top of my bed with my
pillow. Ok,</B>
<BR><B>so on we go. I was sleeping, but was just awoken by a loud banging.
This</B>
<BR><B>wasn't unusual for me though, because I have a little girl ghost
in my room</B>
<BR><B>that hides by my closet. I had just gotten a TV put in my room and
she hits</B>
<BR><B>it sometimes, it's acutally quite funny. As soon as I leave my room
I can</B>
<BR><B>hear her poking it. ANyway, I was awoken by a loud banging and was
lying in</B>
<BR><B>bed. All the sudden I heard a stomping in my hallway. I thought
it was my</B>
<BR><B>father because he wakes me up in the morning. So I went to turn
around when</B>
<BR><B>they stomping came in my room. I looked and there was nobody there.
I knew it</B>
<BR><B>was the ghost so I laid in bed and stared around my room. It stomped
over to</B>
<BR><B>my TV and it hit it, very hard, my TV almost fell off the stand.
The whole</B>
<BR><B>time I was watching it. Then my father's alarm went off in the other
room and</B>
<BR><B>the stomping immediatley stopped. I jumped out of bed and got my
shower, and</B>
<BR><B>we painted my room soon after so I haven't slept in it since.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Three Dogs, One Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: CoNtAcCLV@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Sheldon, I
have been a ghost believer for many years but only recently felt the presence</B>
<BR><B>of something that I believe to be some form of ghost. One night
while at a friends house partying, I felt the presence of someone or something
that shouldn’t have been there. I needed to use the bathroom, which was
downstairs, and the whole way down it felt as if somebody was walking directly
behind me. Once down, I opened the door to get through the kitchen, when
my friends three dogs started just starring, but not at me, at something
behind me. These dogs are always very eager and a bit wild, they bark constently
at anything, especially humans there not use too.these dogs were very calm
which made me very uncomfortable and when I stopped at the bathroom door
to look at them, they were following something going in the opposite direction.
There heads where moving at the same time which meant too me, they saw
something, that I couldn’t&nbsp; see.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I opened the bathroom door,
I felt the temperature drop, I was freezing. Tears formed in my eyes, the
hairs on my arm stood up and I agian felt that someone was right there.
Once I left the bathroom, the dogs eyes didn’t follow me at all, it was
as if I wasn’t even there. I watched them intently as I went through the
kitchen, they were focused on the bathroom and never left untill I could'nt
see them any more told my friend my experience right away and he believed
me fully. He too has had unexplainable things happen to him in this house.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The really strange thing is that we know who
is haunting his house. This house use to belong to a very good friend of
his whom recently was killed in front of the house on his motorcycle. His
parents were wealthy and allowed my friend to move in there two months
later with all of there son's belongings (bed, furniture, etc ). Two of
the three dogs were his since he was a child. That's my story, not the
only one, but I feel a very good one.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Haunted Bedroom</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: race_girl_22@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Last week i was about to get to sleep when i looked over to see my
mirror moving back and forth ect. Of course it took me another hour of
trying to get to sleep. I am very interested in ghosts and thought it was
kinda cool to have a ghost.Two or three days later my light( wich is one
that hangs down a couple of inches and it never moves ) was moving. it
finally started to scare me a little. The next day I have a chair with
wheels in my room,it was seated at my desk at least it was until at least
3:00 in the morning when I woke up to it being beside my bed.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghost Chess</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: VVvEnigmavVv@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>when i was about 13 years old i played a game of chess with a ghost
that lasted about four months.&nbsp; i always sleep with my bedroom door
closed and locked.&nbsp; there is no key for my door so there is no way
to enter my room lest you break out my second story window.&nbsp; anyway
i have a chess board set up on a desk in my room.&nbsp; one morning i awoke
to found that one of white's pawns had been pushed forward two squares.&nbsp;
i had always had suspicions that my room was haunted as every now and then
i would feel strong blasts of wind and feelings of emense cold.&nbsp; things
would just fall in my closet for no reason at all..&nbsp; anyway i decided
that i'd test to see if something was going on.&nbsp; so i moved one of
blacks peices that day.&nbsp; i came home from school, did my homework,
and went to bed.&nbsp; the next morning i woke up and another of white's
pieces had moved.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Haunted Piano</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lowderbeth@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've read a lot of stories on this page that are about</B>
<BR><B>houses being haunted but not certain objects.</B>
<BR><B>I was only 4 at the time of my experience(I am now</B>
<BR><B>24).&nbsp; My mother left me to stay with a good friend of</B>
<BR><B>hers (Cathy) for a week because my older sister was in</B>
<BR><B>the hospital and very sick.&nbsp; My father was always</B>
<BR><B>working different shifts at his job so it wasn't</B>
<BR><B>possible for him to look after me between working and</B>
<BR><B>going to the hospital to see my sister.</B>
<BR><B>Cathy lived in a house that was over 100 years old in</B>
<BR><B>a rural area outside of Kansas City. They had only</B>
<BR><B>lived there for a few months when I came to stay with</B>
<BR><B>them. Cathy had two daughters that were older than me</B>
<BR><B>and in school during the day.&nbsp; They had a play room at</B>
<BR><B>one end of the house next to the kitchen.&nbsp; There was a</B>
<BR><B>very old piano in the room that had been painted</B>
<BR><B>white. No one in Cathy's family played the piano so it</B>
<BR><B>was covered in dust and looked like it hadn't been</B>
<BR><B>played in years.&nbsp; It was in the house when they bought</B>
<BR><B>it.&nbsp; Where the music would rest on the piano was a</B>
<BR><B>piece of plywood that had been nailed to the piano.</B>
<BR><B>I liked playing in that room because that was were all</B>
<BR><B>the toys were.&nbsp; Cathy worked from home and her office</B>
<BR><B>was in another area of the house. When I would be</B>
<BR><B>playing in the room the piano would play little pieces</B>
<BR><B>of music on it's own!&nbsp; It didn't alarm me because I</B>
<BR><B>was so young, and my own house had a piano so I was</B>
<BR><B>used to hearing music playing all the time (my mother</B>
<BR><B>is a professional musician).&nbsp; One day this happened</B>
<BR><B>and Cathy was in the kitchen.&nbsp; She heard the music and</B>
<BR><B>stuck her head in the room to see what I was doing.</B>
<BR><B>The music stopped when she stuck her head in.&nbsp; I was</B>
<BR><B>across the room from the piano so obviously I couldn't</B>
<BR><B>have been playing it.&nbsp; She got a really confused look</B>
<BR><B>on her face and asked if she had just heard the piano</B>
<BR><B>playing.&nbsp; I innocently said yes and went back to</B>
<BR><B>playing with my blocks.&nbsp; Cathy walked over to me and</B>
<BR><B>asked, "Were you playing the piano?"&nbsp; I told her, "No.</B>
<BR><B>It can play by itself".&nbsp; She kind of got this panicked</B>
<BR><B>look on her face and asked me if the piano had done</B>
<BR><B>this before (Cathy has always been a believer in</B>
<BR><B>ghost).&nbsp; I told her it did the day before.&nbsp; She was</B>
<BR><B>alarmed by my answer and suggested that I bring the</B>
<BR><B>blocks to the living room at the other end of the</B>
<BR><B>house and play there.&nbsp; I played in the living room for</B>
<BR><B>the rest of the day and nothing else happened.</B>
<BR><B>Cathy told her husband what had happened, but he</B>
<BR><B>didn't really believe us (she didn't tell her</B>
<BR><B>daughters because she didn't want to scare them). The</B>
<BR><B>next day I went to retrieve more toys from the play</B>
<BR><B>room, when I walked past the piano I noticed that the</B>
<BR><B>piece of plywood had been taken off the piano and was</B>
<BR><B>laying on the floor in front of it. Now there was a</B>
<BR><B>big hole in the front of the piano where the wood had</B>
<BR><B>been.&nbsp; I went and told Cathy that someone had broken</B>
<BR><B>the piano.&nbsp; She went to see what I was talking about</B>
<BR><B>and gasped when she saw the piano.&nbsp; The piece of wood</B>
<BR><B>that been removed had been nailed very tightly to the</B>
<BR><B>piano and there was no way that it could have just</B>
<BR><B>fallen off. She knew that no one else had been in the</B>
<BR><B>room since the previous day and she would have heard</B>
<BR><B>someone tearing the wood off the piano. When she</B>
<BR><B>looked in the big hole she saw that the piano had been</B>
<BR><B>a Player Piano. The kind of piano that will play music</B>
<BR><B>if you pump the peddles and have the right equipment.</B>
<BR><B>Apparently the player piano had broken and whoever had</B>
<BR><B>owned it at the time boarded it up with the plywood.</B>
<BR><B>While Cathy was inspecting the old piano it started to</B>
<BR><B>play a couple of notes.&nbsp; She yelled a profanity,</B>
<BR><B>grabbed me and ran out of the room.&nbsp; Player Pianos</B>
<BR><B>can't play by themselves unless someone is pumping the</B>
<BR><B>peddles.&nbsp; She grabbed the phone and called my father.</B>
<BR><B>He happened to be home and came over.</B>
<BR><B>My father is a very religious man and holds a high</B>
<BR><B>position in my church. He came over and blessed the</B>
<BR><B>house and the piano and offered to stay until Cathy</B>
<BR><B>felt better (he didn't have to be at work till later</B>
<BR><B>that night).&nbsp; When Cathy's husband came home she told</B>
<BR><B>him what happened. He was a little more convinced</B>
<BR><B>after he looked at the piano and talked to my dad. He</B>
<BR><B>decided that since no one in the family played they</B>
<BR><B>would just get rid of it.&nbsp; He called the Salvation</B>
<BR><B>Army and asked them to come pick it up (he didn't tell</B>
<BR><B>them why he wanted it gone so fast).&nbsp; They told him</B>
<BR><B>they would be there the next afternoon to get it.</B>
<BR><B>Cathy felt better and couldn't wait till the piano was</B>
<BR><B>gone.&nbsp; During the night while everyone was sleeping we</B>
<BR><B>all woke up around 2am to hear the piano in the play</B>
<BR><B>room playing music. I was sharing a room with the two</B>
<BR><B>daughters and we all woke up.&nbsp; When we came out of the</B>
<BR><B>room Cathy and her husband were already out of their</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; Cathy's husband ran to the play room and</B>
<BR><B>shouted for the piano to stop which it did.&nbsp; By then,</B>
<BR><B>he was&nbsp; firm believer that the piano was haunted.</B>
<BR><B>Cathy's daughters and I were scared to death by then.</B>
<BR><B>I couldn't stop crying so Cathy and her husband</B>
<BR><B>decided that everyone would sleep in the living room</B>
<BR><B>at the other end of the house away from the piano.&nbsp; We</B>
<BR><B>all kind of fell asleep at different times, but</B>
<BR><B>nothing else happened the rest of the night.&nbsp; Cathy's</B>
<BR><B>husband called in sick to work the next day and waited</B>
<BR><B>with us till the piano had been taken away.&nbsp; When the</B>
<BR><B>men came to move the piano it was quite.&nbsp; It wasn't</B>
<BR><B>until they got it out of the house and into the truck</B>
<BR><B>(it took a while to move it because it was so heavy)</B>
<BR><B>that the piano played two notes on it's own.&nbsp; The guys</B>
<BR><B>from Salvation Army looked a little surprised, but</B>
<BR><B>Cathy told them that it was a player piano so it would</B>
<BR><B>do that occasionally (she wasn't going to say it was</B>
<BR><B>haunted of course!). After the piano was out of the</B>
<BR><B>house nothing else happened.&nbsp; The rest of the time I</B>
<BR><B>was in the house was completely normal.&nbsp; I have kept</B>
<BR><B>in touch with Cathy and most of what I know about the</B>
<BR><B>experience is from what she has told me.&nbsp; Like I said,</B>
<BR><B>I remember most of it, but a lot of the details are</B>
<BR><B>blurred&nbsp; because of how young I was at the time.</B>
<BR><B>Cathy still lives in the house, but she says the room</B>
<BR><B>were the piano was still creeps her out.&nbsp; Since her</B>
<BR><B>daughters are grown with kids of their own she just</B>
<BR><B>uses the room for storage and doesn't go in there</B>
<BR><B>much. She said she had a lock put on the door to make</B>
<BR><B>her feel better.&nbsp; I always wonder if the piano is</B>
<BR><B>still haunted or if it had something to do with the</B>
<BR><B>house. Nothing else has happened in the house for</B>
<BR><B>twenty years. Has anyone else had an experience with</B>
<BR><B>an object being haunted not a house?</B><B></B>

<P><B>Strange Presence</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: roswelll@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've never been particularly sensitive to supernatural occurrences.
I've heard and sensed things, but I'm pretty good at talking myself out
of them. Not to say I do not believe, because I do.</B>
<BR><B>I have a story to tell.&nbsp; I don't think about it often...I still
can't explain it, maybe you'll be able to explain it to me. I do believe
it was real and not my imagination.</B>
<BR><B>When I was in college and still living at home, I shared a room
with my youngest sister. I've always been a night owl and afraid of the
dark, but this particular night I was pretty tired and not the least bit
scared. I went to bed late, as always, and slept quite peacefully.</B>
<BR><B>At some point during the night I suddenly woke up.&nbsp; Wide awake.
I sensed something or someone in the room, apart from my sister. A sense
of fear gripped my body and I know I held my breath.&nbsp; I always sleep
facing the wall, my back to the room, a childhood habit. I felt the presence
behind me, emanating heat...I heard raspy breathing...harsh. I felt,whatever
it was, press against me, pushing against my back, suffocating me with
its heat. I felt its hot, raspy breath against my neck. I was paralyzed
with fear, I couldn't move, I couldn't shout.&nbsp; I just shut my eyes
and began to pray. Finally through prayer...I fell asleep...when I woke
up in the morning my heart was still pounding.</B>
<BR><B>I know that whatever I felt was not human.&nbsp; The minute I woke
up I knew.&nbsp; I later mentioned it to my mother and she told me a similar
story. While she was a child she woke up feeling something was pressing
down on her. She was laying on her back and saw nothing. She felt manacled
to her bed.</B>
<BR><B>My youngest sister, who now sleeps in that room alone, senses a
presence there. She hears it breathing...it has never touched her.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Car</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: YourBestDJ@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have had several experiences in my car. Not SEEING Ghosts, or images.
But</B>
<BR><B>instead feeling a knee in my back.</B>
<BR><B>While driving, I have felt the back of the car seat press hard against
MY</B>
<BR><B>back. Very much like when someone sitting behind you pushes their
knee into</B>
<BR><B>the back of your chair.</B>
<BR><B>It comes out of nowhere. It happens whenever. It (the seat) has
no reason to</B>
<BR><B>do this.</B>
<BR><B>At first I thought it was something I THOUGHT I felt. But it has
happened too</B>
<BR><B>many times since. There is defintely a hard knee like feeling coming
through</B>
<BR><B>the back of the seat.</B>
<BR><B>No one else feels it. Or, has had that happen to them while driving.</B>
<BR><B>Have you ever heard of weird things like this happening in cars?
My parents</B>
<BR><B>are both deceased. Maybe it's a sign from one of them?</B>
<BR><B>My cousin has two children, who had an experience together when
they were</B>
<BR><B>younger. Both boys were left alone (briefly) in the car. This was
long before</B>
<BR><B>car seats, or safety belts were instituted.</B>
<BR><B>One of them managed to put the car in neutral or possibly drive,
while the</B>
<BR><B>other cheered him on. They were soon out of control. A man whom
they claim to</B>
<BR><B>this very</B>
<BR><B>day, dressed in white pulled the vehicle over &amp; left.</B>
<BR><B>When my cousin came out she saw the car stopped at the bottom of
the hill, on</B>
<BR><B>the side of the road.</B>
<BR><B>My cousin asked her sons who stopped the car. She asked them each
for days</B>
<BR><B>afterward. In fact she asked them countless times together, &amp;
separately.</B>
<BR><B>They swear a man dressed only in white ran besdie the car, got in
&amp;&nbsp; pulled</B>
<BR><B>it over. He checked to make sure they were OK and left. No one else
saw him.</B>
<BR><B>MY cousin searched everywhere at that time but never found him.</B>
<BR><B>Thes kids are now in their mid 30's. They swear by this story and
have told</B>
<BR><B>it exactly the same wayover the years.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Pantry</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Slvrgrizly@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>In my kitchen, there's a pantry that always gave me the creeps. Well,
I was just finishing the dishes at like 11:00 p.m. and I go to throw out
a paper towel and my garbage can is in this pantry. When I opened the door,
a freezing gush of wind bursts out from the back of the pantry when. it
felt like death was just let out of a cage. When I looked to see what had
happened, and&nbsp; there was a face in the back&nbsp; wall of the pantry
that was never there before. it looked as if it was talking, but no words
came out. Then the door slammed shut, followed by a series of screams,
and more freezing wind. That night I slept at a nearby hotel, and refused
to go back home for about a week.</B><B></B>

<P><B>#222 Follow-Up</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sandymay62@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Since the posting of my story (#222) on your website, I have had
several inquiries via email as to the history of the house and other such
questions.&nbsp; Rather than try to answer each email individually, I figure
it would be simpler to post a follow-up submission to address these questions
and to appease the curiosity of your readers:</B>
<BR><B>First of all, I titled this story #222 as this was the address of
the house.&nbsp; Through some of my research into numerology, I have discovered
that the number 2 is synonymous with spirits.&nbsp; This house seemed to
have a triple-whammy, so to speak.&nbsp; Go figure.</B>
<BR><B>I began doing research on the property while we were still living
there.&nbsp; A great deal of the documentation I had gathered during my
research has, unfortunately, disappeared.&nbsp; As I touched upon in my
original posting, my computer would often have files mysteriously go missing
and the hard drive had crashed several times.&nbsp; In addition, many of
the backup discs I had created of my files were also subsequently blank.&nbsp;
Whatever forces hover over that house apparently had a problem with my
writing about them (I began keeping a journal in 1996).&nbsp; They also
interfered with my research quite frequently.&nbsp; Also, many documents
(including the journal) and backup files were destroyed when the plumbing
exploded and the house was flooded.&nbsp; However, I have a fairly good
memory and will fill you in on what I have found as best I can recall.</B>
<BR><B>The house was originally built in 1971 and had only one owner up
until 1984.&nbsp; The only death I could attribute to the house through
public records and newspaper accounts, was the death of the original owner
who died in 1984 at the age of 84.&nbsp; Odd, isn't it -- 84 and 84?&nbsp;
Upon his death the house passed to one of the original owner's children
(his daughter and her husband).&nbsp; In 1984, they applied for several
permits to remodel the house and, at that time, added on the screened Florida
Room and dug a 16' x 32' swimming pool.&nbsp; The daughter and her husband
lived in the house for just shy of 2 years then put it up for sale.&nbsp;
According to public records, from 1986 until 1994 (when we purchased the
house), the house had been bought and sold a total of 6 times.&nbsp; Since
1998, when we gave the house back to the bank and it was sold at auction,
there have been exactly 4 owners.&nbsp; At present time, the house is vacant.</B>
<BR><B>The neighborhood that the house was built in was one of relatively
small size.&nbsp; It consisted of one street (a dead-end, ironically enough)
that had approximately 22 houses built on it (here we go with the number
2, again).&nbsp; The odd thing about these 22 houses, is that there was
a rash of "for sale" signs dotting the yards of the houses up and down
this street during the number of years that we lived in the neighborhood.&nbsp;
But, then again, my [former] next door neighbor (a retired Army Colonel)
has lived in his house since 1971 and still lives there today.&nbsp; Who's
to say?&nbsp; I've often wondered if this plat of land was, at one time,
a cemetery.&nbsp; I say this because, at the head of the neighborhood,
stood an old Episcopalian Church.&nbsp; Often times cemeteries were added
on behind churches.&nbsp; This is only a theory, mind you, as I have not
been able to find any documentation through public records of a cemetery
ever having been there.&nbsp; All I do know, is that the problems with
this house seemed to have begun around 1984 when the swimming pool was
dug.</B>
<BR><B>I made several attempts to contact some of the previous 6 owners
of the house, but could find none that were willing to talk to me about
the property.&nbsp; They either did not return my phone calls (or emails)
or refused to talk to me outright.&nbsp; The people we bought the house
from claimed to have no knowledge whatsoever of any "hauntings".&nbsp;
I believe that to be a case of serious denial (they seemed a little nervous
at my having brought up the subject).</B>
<BR><B>Now, to address the questions about whether or not we ever invited
a "psychic evaluation" or "paranormal investigation" into the property.&nbsp;
The answer is NO.&nbsp; We never felt the need.&nbsp; To be quite frank,
3 of the 6 people that lived in the house at the time (ie: my family members),
possess psychic abilities.&nbsp; Myself included.&nbsp; You may remember
from my original posting that I mentioned that I had experienced spirits
before, which is why I would routinely confront them when they would play
their pranks.&nbsp; I have had many experiences with spirits in my lifetime,
beginning in my childhood.&nbsp; It seems that where ever I go, I run into
some.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, the house I currently live in has 2 spirits
residing in it.&nbsp; I discovered, through research (about a year or so
after having purchased it), that a murder occurred here.&nbsp; That, of
course, is another story which I won't get into.&nbsp; Do I have rotten
luck with houses, or what?!</B>
<BR><B>In 2000, I was approached by producers from the FOX Network reality-based
TV show "Worlds Scariest Places".&nbsp; Apparently, they had read my story
on another website and were interested in filming in the house.&nbsp; They
wanted myself and my family to return to the house and spend the night
along with a camera crew and a paranormal investigative group so they could
later air the encounter on their program.&nbsp; I respectfully declined.&nbsp;
I honestly have no desire to return to that house, nor do any of my family
members.&nbsp; Quite frankly, I do not need a team of paranormal investigators
to tell me whether or not the house if haunted.&nbsp; I already know that
it is.&nbsp; I don't need anyone to tell me how many spirits are residing
there or why they're there.&nbsp; I already know how many are residing
there and I don't really care to know why they are there.&nbsp; From what
I already know of these spirits, their intentions are to cause malice and
harm.&nbsp; I want no part of it.</B>
<BR><B>There is some good news to report about the property (at least it
is good news to me).&nbsp; The entire neighborhood is currently involved
in a "buyout" situation wherein developers plan to demolish the existing
houses in this neighborhood to build dormitories/apartments for a nearby
college campus.&nbsp; The old church is included in the buyout.&nbsp; I
say that it is good news in that these spirits won't have the opportunity
to terrorize another family as they did mine.</B>
<BR><B>At present time, my children and I are compiling written accounts
of our individual experiences in the house.&nbsp; I am a writer by trade
(mostly screenplays) and plan to one day converge these individual accounts
into a book on our experiences</B>
