<P><B>Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Swanleykid@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Dan and I would like to share
a ghostly experience that I had</B>
<BR><B>as a youngster with you. I went on a school trip to norfolk aged
about 9 or</B>
<BR><B>10 and we stayed in an old rectory. next door to a church yard.
the first</B>
<BR><B>night the lights came on dimly of their own accord and flickered.
This went</B>
<BR><B>on for around 15 to 20 minutes. it wasnt done by anyone in the room
as the</B>
<BR><B>light switch was situated on the other side of the room to where
the beds</B>
<BR><B>were and it could not be reached undetected. Later, a gameboy on
the table</B>
<BR><B>turned itself on and had to be switched off. Finally, a flash, like
lightning</B>
<BR><B>appeared in the middle of the room.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we told our teacher the next
morning, she just said "oh, you've</B>
<BR><B>met George then." apparently the people who own the place often
see him and</B>
<BR><B>it is always in the room where we stayed and the kids often see
him on the</B>
<BR><B>annual trip to Norfolk.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Im not sure but I think the place was called
the Horsham Centre although</B>
<BR><B>I cant be 100% sure. It had a picture of sunshine as its emblem
if thats any</B>
<BR><B>help.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for reading my story, I hope its of use to you.</B>

<BR><B>Backed By a Cemetery</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: anastaisia@gosympatico.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>This story I am about to tell you is absolutely true.</B>
<BR><B>Although it did not occur in my house but in my aunt's</B>
<BR><B>house. The house is two storeys and backs onto a</B>
<BR><B>graveyard.</B>
<BR><B>The first event that took place was my cousin was very</B>
<BR><B>sick and couldn't make the trip up to her bedroom. So my aunt has
one of those sofa-beds my cousin was five at the time so she really didn't
like the idea of sleeping down in the living room all by herself so my
aunt said she would stay</B>
<BR><B>down with her the entire night. Around 11:30 my cousin was watching
a television show. My uncle had just come down</B>
<BR><B>from the upstairs when the cellar door slammed shut hard.</B>
<BR><B>but no one was within fifteen feet of it.</B>
<BR><B>Since my aunt only told me this story recently I asked her if she
had anymore stories she told me many but I'll only tell a few.</B>
<BR><B>One day my aunt was watching television when she noticed something
out of the corner of her eye. She said she saw a small very dark figure
about three or four feet tall and it's eyes were red and shined like rubies.
Upon looking at it she said it ran into the kitchen which was about five
feet away.</B>
<BR><B>A second later she said she heard growling coming from the kitchen.
This frightened her so much that she ran to her car and went out and didn't
come home for the rest of the afternoon.</B>
<BR><B>Not long after that my cousin said she saw the same dark ruby-eyed
figure standing outside of her bedroom door in the upstairs hallway.</B>
<BR><B>About a month later my aunt told a neighbor about the occurrences
in the house. The neighbor told my aunt that a little boy who she remembers
as being around four feet</B>
<BR><B>was killed in front of the house when he was struck by a car.</B>
<BR><B>My aunt and uncle sold the house about three months later.</B>
<BR><B>But as my uncle was taking a box out of the house he heard what
sounded like a little boys voice saying 'why?' this spooked him very much.</B>
<BR><B>Six and a half years later my uncle, aunt, and cousin now</B>
<BR><B>live happily in a ghost-free home!</B>

<P><B>My Brother</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ladyinalaska@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My brother died suddenly when I was 10 years old he and I were very
close,</B>
<BR><B>now that I am older I feel it was a gift I received.&nbsp; My story
reflects back</B>
<BR><B>to that moment when I awoke the day he died....I had awoke to do
the normal</B>
<BR><B>morning routine getting ready for school.&nbsp; My brother's room
was across the</B>
<BR><B>hall from mine with the bathroom inbetween our doors.&nbsp; I saw
him laying</B>
<BR><B>there and a "knowing" came over me that he would not be there anymore.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>tried to enter the room but something kept me from going in and
waking him.</B>
<BR><B>He was in high school and late for classes, I didn't want our mom
to get</B>
<BR><B>upset over his not awaking, but I could not even enter his room.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>knowing nagged at me all day and when I returned home from school
he had</B>
<BR><B>done all my chores but one.&nbsp; I had to go out in the backyard
to start that</B>
<BR><B>chore and I was struck with a image of him ... and I could not breath.</B>
<BR><B>Thoroughly terrified I leaned against the house trying to decide
whether to</B>
<BR><B>run and tell my mom when I heard the sirens moments later....I re-entered</B>
<BR><B>our home in tears.&nbsp; The ambulance was for my brother who was
killed about 2</B>
<BR><B>miles from our home I never asked how he died in the car accident.&nbsp;
We moved</B>
<BR><B>very soon after that and I was now instead of in a city I was in
the</B>
<BR><B>woods...secluded .... and having to deal with the loss.&nbsp; I
missed him as he</B>
<BR><B>was always there for me, and he always had time for his little sister.&nbsp;
His</B>
<BR><B>dog Abby became a confidant and she always accompanied me wherever
I went.</B>
<BR><B>One morning I awoke to again get ready for school...Abby came downstairs</B>
<BR><B>with me to watch my routine as she always did.&nbsp; I walked into
the bathroom</B>
<BR><B>that had an adjoining very large mud room...approx. 15 X 20...the
farthest</B>
<BR><B>wall I had winter wear and summer coats hanging as well as some
other odds</B>
<BR><B>and ends.&nbsp; Abby was always quiet, but this day she looked into
the darkness</B>
<BR><B>of the mudroom and growled in a low voice and her hackles on her
neck rose.</B>
<BR><B>I looked to see what she was growling at and I saw a orb brightening
into a</B>
<BR><B>larger shape.....I stared as it grew and saw the light forming into
my</B>
<BR><B>brother's face.&nbsp; I turned on the light in the mud room and
it did not go</B>
<BR><B>away...and Abby had disappeared from the room.&nbsp; I ran up the
stairs and hide</B>
<BR><B>in my room.&nbsp; The second time I saw him...he was following me
in the woods on</B>
<BR><B>one of my adventures...again Abby let me know someone was there,
and she</B>
<BR><B>stood there in front of me watching this shape .... it was dark
apparition,</B>
<BR><B>but I knew it was my brother, I could feel his presence and I was
afraid,</B>
<BR><B>and ran again.&nbsp; I sat and thought about my fear and I wanted
for him to stop</B>
<BR><B>what he was doing..as a 10 year old this type of experience would
terrify</B>
<BR><B>anyone.&nbsp; The third time again I was walking in the woods, and
he came up</B>
<BR><B>behind again.... I turned to look and again I saw the dark apparition.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>told him he was frightening me and he had to stop and I ran crying
home.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>never saw him again after that, tho I believe he watches over me
as a</B>
<BR><B>guardian, I feel his presence as he checks in on me, or if there
is danger I</B>
<BR><B>get a premonition before hand.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Camping Trip</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Ambbland22@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I went to stay with my grandmother when I was 14 along with my 2
sisters.&nbsp; We</B>
<BR><B>were just there for the summer.&nbsp; My Uncle Mike decided to take
us camping at</B>
<BR><B>Kings Mountains, N.C.&nbsp; It is a well known battle field for
the Revolutionary</B>
<BR><B>War and possibly the Civil War (not sure about civil war).&nbsp;
He wanted to take</B>
<BR><B>us camping at the primitive sites.&nbsp; When I say premitive I
mean premitive,</B>
<BR><B>No running water, or toliets that flush just the outhouses that
stunk to high</B>
<BR><B>heaven.&nbsp; Well any how Uncle Mike told us it was haunted but
I thoaght he was</B>
<BR><B>pulling our legs and was trying to scare us.&nbsp; Around 11:30pm
to 12:30 am we</B>
<BR><B>had a good sized camp fire going and then we heard what sounded
like guns and</B>
<BR><B>cannons going off.&nbsp; They were in a distance at first but then
they started to</B>
<BR><B>move closer and closer.&nbsp; The closer they got to us the more
clearer we could</B>
<BR><B>hear them, and the closer we they got we could actually hear men
yelling and</B>
<BR><B>screaming.&nbsp; Eventually the cannons and guns quit going off
but you could</B>
<BR><B>still hear the men yelling and screaming, and you could hear them
walking in</B>
<BR><B>the woods.&nbsp; You could hear the crackling of fallen tree limbs
and decaying</B>
<BR><B>tree leaves underneath their feet that's howw clear you could hear
them.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>think that someone or a group of people should go out there and
stake it out</B>
<BR><B>for a few nights and see if they can capture anything on film.&nbsp;
It was a</B>
<BR><B>great experiance for me but my sisters were a little shaken up over
the whole</B>
<BR><B>thing.&nbsp; I would just like to see some footage from it.&nbsp;
I was only 14 when it</B>
<BR><B>happened and didn't have a camera then.&nbsp; You should really
send some people</B>
<BR><B>down there to investigate it, it would be worth while.</B>

<P><B>My Daughter and our Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: KateDani@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; My name is Joy I have had alot of different experiences with
ghosts. From</B>
<BR><B>objects moving across the floor to being awoken with something dark
holding</B>
<BR><B>me down. I was not about to move and when I openned my eyes I saw
something</B>
<BR><B>that I could not explain. I tried to fight but it didn't help. Then
I had a</B>
<BR><B>warm feeling come over me and my dead grandmom was there and I could
move</B>
<BR><B>again.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; For the last 2 years I have found my oldest daughter talking
to her</B>
<BR><B>"friends" upstairs in our home. I knew that there was something
here when we</B>
<BR><B>bought the house. So I wasn't that suprised. Now I find my youngest
daughter</B>
<BR><B>talking to the air. The door to the girls room opens by its self.
There is</B>
<BR><B>also cold spots in their room and occasionly the bathroom and basement.
I</B>
<BR><B>have had something tap my head from behind in the middle of the
night, when</B>
<BR><B>everyone was asleep.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't always bother me that they are here. I just
got weirded out</B>
<BR><B>that my girls talk to them.They like to play tricks on people who
come to</B>
<BR><B>visit us. One of them is having a good time with our babysitter.
the other</B>
<BR><B>week she was in the bathroom in the middle of the night and it openned
the</B>
<BR><B>door. She screamed woke us all up. My 4 yr. old went and told her
that they</B>
<BR><B>won't hurt her they just like to come to talk and play. When the
babbysitter</B>
<BR><B>asked my daughter who won't hurt her she told her " you know the
boy, the</B>
<BR><B>girl and the man." I asked my daughter where they were and she said
that he</B>
<BR><B>was in her room.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; That's when I called a pyshic. I never told anyone that she
said there</B>
<BR><B>were 3. The psyhic told me that my family has a "gift" and that
my daughter</B>
<BR><B>has it stronger than the rest of us. That they come to visit her
because she</B>
<BR><B>notices them.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I'm not sure who they are yet but we are working on that.
My 4 yr. old</B>
<BR><B>told me that the little girl floats like in the water she died in.
also, that</B>
<BR><B>she is sad because her mommy is now dying&nbsp; 'cause she is so
sad that the</B>
<BR><B>little girl died.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I also have some pictures of my daughter that I found that
seem to have</B>
<BR><B>some weird things in them like something moving across them. I will
send them</B>
<BR><B>soon. If you have any suggestions on how we can found out who they
are I will</B>
<BR><B>take what I can get. My daughter doesn't always want to talk about
them. She</B>
<BR><B>says "not now mommy maybe later" whenever I ask her who they are
what their</B>
<BR><B>names are. It's not that interesting of a story but its nice to
tell someone.</B>
<BR><B>Thank you for your time.</B>

<P><B>By: katty1168@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have enjoyed all of the stories i have read on your site.&nbsp;
This experience was just odd.&nbsp; I have yet to actualy see anything
paranormal.</B>
<BR><B>My husband and I moved to Virginia Beach. We were fortunate enough
to find a house to rent that was within our budget.&nbsp; It was just a
small ranch style house with three bedrooms. This was in 1992 at that time
we only had the first two of our four daughters.&nbsp; At this time our
oldest daughter Kim was two and Mindy was five months old.</B>
<BR><B>The very first day we moved in i felt there was someone else in
the house, especialy in the back bedroom.&nbsp; My five month old daughter
would always scream when we would put her to bed in there.&nbsp; I finally
gave up and put her crib in my room.&nbsp; She slept through the night
after i moved her crib.&nbsp; I left the rest of her furniture in that
room.&nbsp; I hated to go in there to get her clothes, the room was always
cold and you always felt like someone was watching you.</B>
<BR><B>We lived there for about six months when my brother decided to move
to Virginia Beach to go to work with my husband.&nbsp; He and his children
stayed with us until they found a place of their own.&nbsp; He had two
children who were about the same ages as our daughters.</B>
<BR><B>My oldest daughter and my neice, who are the same age, had an imaginary
friend.&nbsp; His name was Bob.&nbsp; I thought this was strange because
neither of them had ever known a Bob.&nbsp; I wasnt really concern because
i know that a lot of children their age have imaginary friends.&nbsp; The
funny thing was they had the same friend.&nbsp; They would play hide and
seek with Bob.&nbsp; Kind of two against one. One of the girls would say,"
He ran behind the couch."&nbsp; The other one would say, " There he goes."&nbsp;
I thought it was strange both girls actually seem to seem someone.&nbsp;
This happened on several occasions.</B>
<BR><B>We only lived there for about a year.&nbsp; The girls and I moved
back to Maine.&nbsp; My husband stayed behind to paint the house and some
cleaning so we could get our deposit back.&nbsp; While he was painting
one day our landlord came by, he said he was sorry to see us go.&nbsp;
He said he didnt know what he was going to do with the house now.&nbsp;
He also said his brother had died in the back bedroom, so the house had
senimental value.&nbsp; My husband asked him what his brothers name was.&nbsp;
He told him his name was Bob.</B>
<BR><B>After we moved Kim never saw Bob again.&nbsp; Ive asked her a couple
of times what she remembers about Bob and she says she doesnt remember
anything.&nbsp; Thanks for listening.&nbsp; Sorry if i bored anyone.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Daughter's Friend</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: dshah@legato.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is a wierd story that really doesn't have anything scary in
it but I</B>
<BR><B>believe that my eldest daughter might have had a ghost as a friend
when she</B>
<BR><B>was three.</B>
<BR><B>It all started when my daughter started to tell my wife and I about
an</B>
<BR><B>imaginary friend that she had. This friend's name was Pito and the
friend</B>
<BR><B>was female. My wife and I just shrugged it off as a passing thing
because</B>
<BR><B>all kids at one time or another have imaginary friends, especially
when they</B>
<BR><B>didn't have any brothers or sisters, right? We thought it was cute
and</B>
<BR><B>didn't think much about it, that is until my daughter started telling
us</B>
<BR><B>more about Pito. She said that Pito was 12 and that she had been
in jail a</B>
<BR><B>lot of times. Pito had apparently killed her parents. This really
freaked us</B>
<BR><B>out that she would be sitting there and relaying the information
from</B>
<BR><B>someone or something next to her. I understand that kids have a
wild</B>
<BR><B>imagination but for my three year old daughter to be talking about
murder</B>
<BR><B>and jail and such things were unsettling. From that point on, we
told our</B>
<BR><B>daughter that Pito was not welcome anywhere near our house or our
family.</B>
<BR><B>Our daughter put up a good fight but after stating the samething
over and</B>
<BR><B>over to her, one day, out of the blue, we never heard anything about
Pito</B>
<BR><B>again. To this day, I have questioned my daughter, who is now seven,
about</B>
<BR><B>Pito. She tells me that she doesn't remember anything about a Pito.</B>
<BR><B>Well, thats my story. Please let me know what you think... Was Pito
a</B>
<BR><B>figment of my daughter's imagination or did my daughter have a ghostly</B>
<BR><B>visitor? BTW you have a great site and your work in helping others
is appreciated and</B>
<BR><B>admired.</B>

<P><B>My Encounters</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Mary</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am only a young girl going into 6th grade and turning 12 on September
17th</B>
<BR><B>2001. But I have had experiences too. I live in New York. In Long
Island to</B>
<BR><B>be more exact. Anyway, my very first encounter is when I'm in my
bathroom by</B>
<BR><B>my room. I am just sitting there minding my own business when all
of a sudden</B>
<BR><B>I look at the wall and there is a figure there! It was just a outline
of</B>
<BR><B>someone small...about 5,6,7 years old. I saw outlines of arms, a
head,ears</B>
<BR><B>but the bottom was missing. I couldn't speak. Then I blinked and
it was gone.</B>
<BR><B>My second experience was when I am in my room. I am trying to get
to sleep</B>
<BR><B>when I look at my turned off TV. I see a teenage boy there. He is</B>
<BR><B>light-skinned, has dark hair, has freckles I think, a dark t-shirt
and a red</B>
<BR><B>thing on it. Some kind of symbol. He has dark blue jeans on. He
is just</B>
<BR><B>walking behind my bed. I slowly go out of bed and stand out of my
door. I</B>
<BR><B>come back in. He is gone. My third experience is my most scary one.
I am</B>
<BR><B>lying in my bed. All of a sudden I feel something press my chest
for one</B>
<BR><B>second. My stomach jumped. It is very late. I am feeling very tense.
Then I</B>
<BR><B>wait for a minute. It happens again. I make a cross with my fingers
and I</B>
<BR><B>soon fall asleep. My room used to be my grandmother's old room.
She passed</B>
<BR><B>away in 1998. Now I sleep there. Strange. Every second of my life
I sense</B>
<BR><B>someone with me. Or in my house anyway. It is scary. Especially
in my room at</B>
<BR><B>night. But I believe that it is just my guardian angel or my grandma
or</B>
<BR><B>relatives with me protecting me....but sometimes I fear the presence
is not</B>
<BR><B>them.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Experiences</B>
<BR><B>By: Jugalette18750@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Hi, I just wanted to share with you some of the many experiances
that I have</B>
<BR><B>had, here is the first one that REALLY scared me.</B>
<BR><B>I am a FAITHFUL Tool fan, so when they were coming in concert, me
and my</B>
<BR><B>bestfriend made it a point that we were going regaurdless of the</B>
<BR><B>circumstances.</B>
<BR><B>Well the night of the concert there was a bit of electricity in
the air like</B>
<BR><B>there was something odd amidst, but we went anyways enjoying our
time and</B>
<BR><B>even screaming until we had no voices left.</B>
<BR><B>Well at that time I was living with my grandparents and I came home
and</B>
<BR><B>walked by my grandmothers bedroom door (which was acrossed from
my room) and</B>
<BR><B>told her that I was home.</B>
<BR><B>Well she came in my room with a confused look on her face and said.</B>
<BR><B>"where did you go?"</B>
<BR><B>I looked at her and kinda laughed and said "the tool concert remember?"</B>
<BR><B>and she said "No after that, where did you go?"</B>
<BR><B>I looked at her and I said "Mom&nbsp; I just got home from the concert
I came</B>
<BR><B>straight home afterwards."</B>
<BR><B>She shook her head and said "No you came home about a half hour
ago and said</B>
<BR><B>mom I am home, and you sat on the end of the bed and told me that
you had a</B>
<BR><B>good time and you were going to bed, then you got up and went to
your room</B>
<BR><B>and shut the door."</B>
<BR><B>Then I noticed that my bedroom door was in fact shut, even though
I never</B>
<BR><B>shut the door and my grandparents were totally against shut doors
unless you</B>
<BR><B>were going to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>That made the hair on my neck stand straight on end, and I opened
the door</B>
<BR><B>and started looking around my room.</B>
<BR><B>I told her, "Do you think that someone came in??"</B>
<BR><B>and she said NO it was you I looked right at you! I even talked
to you.</B>
<BR><B>I questioned her to see if she was dreaming but she said that she
was wide</B>
<BR><B>awake.</B>
<BR><B>It was about that time that the closet doors began to shake as though
someone</B>
<BR><B>was behind them (they are on tracks so they slide back and forth
and they are</B>
<BR><B>pretty heavy.) even though I had JUST checked the closet to see
if there was</B>
<BR><B>anyone in there.</B>
<BR><B>Well Needless to say I freaked out and was close to tears, so I
told my</B>
<BR><B>grandma that she was scaring me and I was going to sleep in the
back bedroom</B>
<BR><B>(I dont know it just feels safer) well as I walked out of the room
with my</B>
<BR><B>things to sleep in the back the bedroom door slammed behind me.</B>
<BR><B>Well I moved back into my grandmothers house not too long ago, and
it wasted</B>
<BR><B>no time letting me know that it didnt want me here (I say it because
I know</B>
<BR><B>that it is the same damn ghost that hates me!) well the first night
that I</B>
<BR><B>slept here after moving back in, I had drifted off to sleep when
I felt</B>
<BR><B>something walking on my bed, it was like a cat walking, and at first
I</B>
<BR><B>thought that it was my cat but then I realized that my cat was laying
right</B>
<BR><B>next to me. as I turned to look at whatever it was that was walking,
I</B>
<BR><B>realized that I couldnt move! it felt like someone was holdng my
arms and my</B>
<BR><B>legs down. As I tried to scream I realized that I couldnt scream
at all!</B>
<BR><B>Nothing came out when I screamed, the only sound was a faint moan.
But I</B>
<BR><B>could move my head around without problem.</B>
<BR><B>Well All of a sudden, a light began to frantically jump on me (it
looked like</B>
<BR><B>a very fast flash light) and it would fly up and then down on my
skin and</B>
<BR><B>when it did it felt like I was being scratched.even though there
were no</B>
<BR><B>marks.</B>
<BR><B>I would have thought that it was just old hag, but I realized that
when the</B>
<BR><B>light moved, my cat followed it with his eyes, and he didnt seem
to be able</B>
<BR><B>to move either! well as suddenly as it started it stopped and flew
under the</B>
<BR><B>bed and immediatly I could move again. as could my cat who IMMEDIATLY
wanted</B>
<BR><B>out of the room.</B>
<BR><B>Well All has been well, my grandparents put up a door in the kitchen
and I</B>
<BR><B>blessed the back of the house, and the night before last my grandma
came into</B>
<BR><B>my room and asked if I was ok</B>
<BR><B>I was like yeah, why?</B>
<BR><B>and she said that she had heard me frantically banging on the back
door, I</B>
<BR><B>told her that I hadnt left my bed and I was watching something on
tv and</B>
<BR><B>hadnt heard anything. Just as I said that I heard the front door
open very</B>
<BR><B>loudly. when I asked her what the noise was she said that she hadnt
heard</B>
<BR><B>anything and went back to bed.</B>
<BR><B>about a half an hour later, she came back into the room to ask me
what was</B>
<BR><B>wrong. I told her nothing I was still in the same spot that I was
in the last</B>
<BR><B>time that she came and checked.</B>
<BR><B>She said that she heard something in the living room with my voice
saying</B>
<BR><B>"mom mom please help me, mom."</B>
<BR><B>I am sure that plenty more will happen, there has been things that
scurry</B>
<BR><B>about and such but this has been long enough, I will let you know
about</B>
<BR><B>anything else that totally stands out from the everyday abnormal
around here.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for listening.</B>

<P><B>Supernatural Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: curegoth@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, last night(aug.3) my sister and I were watching "Possessed",
its the movie about the true case that The Exorcist was made from. We were
sitting in the living room watching the intense ending, the exorcism on
the little boy, and right as the priest was loudly saying the sign of the
cross, at the exact moment he said "Holy Ghost" there was&nbsp; crash in
the "fancy off limits" living room. We got freaked and changed the channel
and turned on the lights to discover that one of that one of the 7 foot
plants my mother has which are extremely bottom heavy had completely tipped
over on its side.&nbsp; The enormous pot that it was in is very heavy on
its own, it takes 2 grown people to move it and even then its heavy, not
only that but its on a completely flat surface, perfect balance. So it
pretty much goes without saying that my sister and i were completely freaked
out, especially since thats not the first experience thats happened in
that room, theres been two others that happened about 4 years ago.&nbsp;
Well i guess thats all, just wanted to share my scary experience with all
you peoples, if anyone has any comments, suggestions, or shared something
simalar feel free to email me, make sure to put "Supernaturual Experience"
in the subject.</B><B></B>

<P><B>While my cousin and i were walking down the street we heard strange
screaming noices and a cold breath on our necks that made the hair on our
bodies stand straight up. I looked up to find no one there though. We continued
walking and heard twigs snapping behind us as if someone or something was
walking behind us. We started to pick up pace and then started running
then the sound stopped dead in our tracks. My cousin and i turned around
and then saw what appeared to be a women in a white dress with red frills.
she was really really pale and she had dark brown hair.She reached out
and said," can you help me?I seem to be lost." My cousin and I screamed
in horror and ran&nbsp; but as soon as we got to my house we saw what looked
like an orb by the top of my mango tree. We ran into the house&nbsp; and
didnt come out until the next day. i never want to have that experience
again.................</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Families Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tkramer@icorpstech.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I have a story that revolves around my mom's house. It's quite long
and</B>
<BR><B>I apologize in advance for that, but you'll see why I had to write
so</B>
<BR><B>much.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;We acquired this house in 1979, I was 5. I am now 27 and have
been</B>
<BR><B>living with my husband in our own place for just under a year, so
I</B>
<BR><B>lived there about 22 years. The house is in one of old sections
of</B>
<BR><B>Dorchester, Mass. A lot of big old Victorians, Mansions, Colonials
and</B>
<BR><B>so forth are there. The house is a little over 100 years old, I
can't</B>
<BR><B>remember exactly the age, but let's just say the setup of the house
is</B>
<BR><B>quite unique.</B>
<BR><B>The sightings went back as early as I was 5 when I grandmother just
had</B>
<BR><B>passed away. My mom said she could see a figure of my Nana checking
on</B>
<BR><B>me and then my mom and then vanishing. This went on for 4 months
after</B>
<BR><B>her death, so we felt safe in house as a family. Every now and then</B>
<BR><B>strange things would happen in the house. We just thought it was
my</B>
<BR><B>grandma coming back to say hi, or to add to the conversation.</B>
<BR><B>We were used to strange things in the house happening. There would
be a</B>
<BR><B>thumping above our kitchen light on a regular basis, lights would
dim</B>
<BR><B>down or up, TVs would turn off and on, and the house would get very
cold</B>
<BR><B>and then be fine.</B>
<BR><B>Then I started to see it. I can only describe it as the black fuzzy</B>
<BR><B>stuff you see when you rub your eyes too much. It had a male but</B>
<BR><B>protective presence, we called him "Harry", so we had two ghosts
now.</B>
<BR><B>But we then soon found out there was a third hiding up in the attic
the</B>
<BR><B>whole time.</B>
<BR><B>No one in my house likes our attic at all. As a space it is so cool,
it</B>
<BR><B>is a full size attic, basically like a third floor to the house.
But</B>
<BR><B>there was a strong uncomfortable feeling when you went by the door
or</B>
<BR><B>had to run up there for something. One of my friends who is a practicing</B>
<BR><B>healer, downright refuses to go up there to this day.</B>
<BR><B>In the summer of 1995 I started having nightmares, awful ones all</B>
<BR><B>revolving around a specific attic space that just felt like pure
evil.</B>
<BR><B>They then transformed into a nightmare that plagued me for two years.
I</B>
<BR><B>didn't know why, at the time I was in college and living at home.
My mom</B>
<BR><B>had just been diagnosed with Breast Cancer, my dad who had a quintuple</B>
<BR><B>bypass decided to move out, chaos reined there, so I figured it
had to</B>
<BR><B>be stress of everything going on. My then fianc&eacute; now husband
decided to</B>
<BR><B>start spending more time over the house and eventually I could sleep</B>
<BR><B>through the night.</B>
<BR><B>The "bugger" as we named it, has tormented my family since then,</B>
<BR><B>especially me. It is quite fond of my dreams and my room and used
to</B>
<BR><B>visit quite a bit when I lived there. I would see the most horrifying</B>
<BR><B>things in the middle of the night, and closing my eyes just intensified</B>
<BR><B>the experience. One time (I have a porch attached to my bedroom
cause it</B>
<BR><B>is in the back of the house), I couldn't sleep that night and as
I</B>
<BR><B>turned over towards the door to the porch I could see a figure of</B>
<BR><B>someone standing there! I of course freaked and screamed flipping
the</B>
<BR><B>light on just to see no one there on the porch. My mom thought I
was</B>
<BR><B>crazy told me to try to sleep. Once I turned the lights off and
tried to</B>
<BR><B>get some sleep it was there again, but in my room on the other side
of</B>
<BR><B>the bed! Lets just put it this way I slept downstairs on the couch
with</B>
<BR><B>the lights and TV on. Not liked it really helped though, something
kept</B>
<BR><B>turning it off and on all night.</B>
<BR><B>My mom has been telling me it has recently been doing more nasty
things</B>
<BR><B>to the objects on the second floor since I left. Hurling pictures
down</B>
<BR><B>the stairs, blowing lights out, knocking things over. Just in general
a</B>
<BR><B>nasty customer.</B>
<BR><B>We figured that the one we call "Harry" and my Nana have been keeping</B>
<BR><B>the "bugger" at bay in the attic. But since my moving it has been</B>
<BR><B>getting out and going straight for my room. We currently have a
friend</B>
<BR><B>staying in what was once my room, since I have been married. The
poor</B>
<BR><B>guy can only sleep during the day.</B>
<BR><B>Thank You for letting me tell my story.</B>

<P><B>My Family and Co.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ANGELICEYES98@AOL.COM</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I'll never forget the first time that I had an experience with a
ghost. The</B>
<BR><B>first experience was in Brooklyn, NY. I had to have been about 4
or 5 years</B>
<BR><B>old when my maternal grandfather died from diabetes. I really didn't</B>
<BR><B>understand what dying was so I thought that he would be back, that
he was</B>
<BR><B>going on a trip. Needless to say, that wasn't the case and I never
got to</B>
<BR><B>really say good-bye. It had to be around 3 days after he died, me
my Mom and</B>
<BR><B>my sister who was 2 years old at the time, were coming back from
my</B>
<BR><B>grandmothers house and I saw my grandfather who died just a few
days before</B>
<BR><B>sitting on our front steps, with a big smile on his face waving
to me. I, of</B>
<BR><B>course, got really excited and began waving. My mother looked at
me and said,</B>
<BR><B>"Who are you waving to?" and I began screaming, "Papa! Papa!" I
ran to my</B>
<BR><B>house to give him a hug, and when I got there, he was gone and I
wanted to</B>
<BR><B>cry. My Mom looked at me like I had 10 heads and she said that papa
was dead.</B>
<BR><B>All I could do was say, "But I saw him. He was sitting right here!!"
After</B>
<BR><B>about 5 times of saying that, my Mom saw how serious I was, she
became teary</B>
<BR><B>eyed and said that it was his way of saying good-bye to me.</B>
<BR><B>Another time was when I was in the 6th grade, my paternal grandfather
had</B>
<BR><B>died from lung cancer. when about 2 years. after we were in Toms
River, New</B>
<BR><B>Jersey and my parents, my grandmother and her friend had gone food
shopping</B>
<BR><B>and they were gone for a while. Me and my sister were the only ones
in the</B>
<BR><B>house. Now for some reason, each door makes its own should so I
know the</B>
<BR><B>difference between the front and garage door coming in to the house.
So it</B>
<BR><B>had to have been 1:30pm, and my parents were gone for almost an
hour and a</B>
<BR><B>half, when I hear the front door open and close. Now my sister is
in a room</B>
<BR><B>that has a little rec room and the kitchen connected together. I
think that</B>
<BR><B>its my parents and grandmother back from shopping so I got to help.
I get</B>
<BR><B>into the living room and no one is there. I go to where the garage
door is</B>
<BR><B>and nothing. I look at my sister and asked her if she went out side
or opened</B>
<BR><B>the front door. She looked at me like I was crazy and said no. Now
normally I</B>
<BR><B>would say ok I'm hearing things but it happened again, about 5 minutes
after</B>
<BR><B>the first time. My parents didn't come back until about 2pm. After
my heart</B>
<BR><B>stopped racing, I figured that it was my grandfather making sure
that me and</B>
<BR><B>my sister were ok.</B>
<BR><B>Still in Toms River, New Jersey but at another time I saw a ghost
was about 4</B>
<BR><B>months ago, I was staying at my grandmothers house for Easter weekend
with my</B>
<BR><B>family, and me and my sister were sleeping in my grandmothers room.
It had to</B>
<BR><B>have been around 12 in the morning, I wasn't tired so I turned on
the TV.</B>
<BR><B>That's when I saw it. I didn't feel cold but I did feel as if someone
was in</B>
<BR><B>the room watching me. I sat up but didn't see anything. So I laid
back down</B>
<BR><B>and go that feeling again. My grandfather has been dead since I
was 11 years</B>
<BR><B>old, at the time this happened I was 19 years. old and I saw him
walk by the</B>
<BR><B>side of the bed my sister was sleeping on. I jumped up, looked around
the</B>
<BR><B>room and saw nothing. I thought that I was seeing things but I saw
him do the</B>
<BR><B>same thing again. This time I was freaked so I sat up and turned
on the</B>
<BR><B>lights. Now its about 12:30am and I hear the front door open and
close, I</B>
<BR><B>hear footsteps walk thought the living room and I hear my grandmothers
dog</B>
<BR><B>walking across the kitchen floor. I should also tell you that the
dog was put</B>
<BR><B>to sleep when I was 13 years old. Then it became quiet. My sister
woke up</B>
<BR><B>about 15 minutes later to use the bathroom. About 5 minutes later,
she comes</B>
<BR><B>running in the bedroom, jumps in the bed and pulls the cover over
her head.</B>
<BR><B>She tells me later on that day that she heard the same thing I did
15 min</B>
<BR><B>before she woke up.</B>
<BR><B>Brooklyn, NY - My uncle died in March of last year. It was really
hard to</B>
<BR><B>deal with. Because he was only in his early 60's, plus his youngest
son was</B>
<BR><B>getting married in less then 3 months. Even though he has been dead
for a</B>
<BR><B>little over a year, lately it feels like he's in my house. The first
person</B>
<BR><B>to see him in the house was my sister. She was sitting on the couch
and I was</B>
<BR><B>sitting on the love seat w/ my boyfriend at the time. She kept jerking
her</B>
<BR><B>head toward the bathroom. After the third time that she did that
I said, "Ok,</B>
<BR><B>what do you see?" Her face went white and she said, "Uncle Junior".
I thought</B>
<BR><B>nothing of it because I was use to hearing stuff like that but she
looked</B>
<BR><B>scared out of her mind. I told her not to worry, that he wouldn't
hurt any of</B>
<BR><B>us. Now my boyfriend at the time, seemed a little edgy. I told him
to relax</B>
<BR><B>that nothing would happen. About 2 months ago, I would see something
walk</B>
<BR><B>back and forth in my hallway. When I would go to look I of course
saw</B>
<BR><B>nothing. I would see something by my front door looking from behind
one of</B>
<BR><B>the walls; I would look in that direction, again I see nothing.
I would see</B>
<BR><B>something stand by the bathroom, a white figure, from the corner
of my eye</B>
<BR><B>but when I would look at that direction nothing.</B>
<BR><B>Now these last 2 stories don't have anything to do with my grandfathers
or my</B>
<BR><B>uncle but I thought that they were a little weird. About 1 yr. ago,
my family</B>
<BR><B>and I were at my aunts house in Toms River, New Jersey for my cousins</B>
<BR><B>graduation party. It was about 3pm and I was out front watching
my cousins</B>
<BR><B>and my sister goof around. Then my aunt called my 11 yr. old cousin
into the</B>
<BR><B>house for something, and when she opened the screen door to go in
I saw a</B>
<BR><B>pale little boy standing in the middle of the floor. I got up from
where I</B>
<BR><B>was sitting and walked toward the door. As I go to step in the house,
the</B>
<BR><B>little boy smiled and waved at me, then disappeared.&nbsp; That
following winter,</B>
<BR><B>I was hanging out with a friend of mine in Brooklyn, NY and she
wanted to</B>
<BR><B>stop and see her other friend who was really sick. So we go to her
house and</B>
<BR><B>she's standing by her door talking to my friend. Out of nowhere,
I see this</B>
<BR><B>muscular guy very slowly walk from one end of the house to the other.
It was</B>
<BR><B>a very dark gray figure, no face, almost transparent but not quite.
I asked</B>
<BR><B>the girl if anyone was in the house and she said her mom and sister.
Then I</B>
<BR><B>asked her if there were any guys in the house and she said no. She
asked me</B>
<BR><B>why and I told her I saw a dark figure walk around in the house
and that it</B>
<BR><B>had the body of a really big guy. The funny thing is, after I told
her what I</B>
<BR><B>saw, she didn't seem all that surprised.</B>
<BR><B>Most of my experiences have never really had any "cold spots". Just
the</B>
<BR><B>feeling of something/someone watching me, and a lot of unexplained
noises,</B>
<BR><B>seeing something but then it being gone. I use to think that ghosts
were just</B>
<BR><B>a bunch of crap but that was until I had my own experience. So for
those who</B>
<BR><B>say that ghosts aren't real or think that it's just all in your</B>
<BR><B>head..........just wait until it happens to you. Then you'll believe.</B>

<P><B>My Fathers House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: CAPEWAYTOW@MEDIAONE.NET</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi I just wanted to share my story, I'm 27 now but when I was 16
I lived with my father in the house that I grew up in. My parents were
divorced and my brothers and sister had already moved out.</B>
<BR><B>One night I was getting ready to go out with some friends and was
just coming out of the bathroom which was right next to my bedroom, but
the doors were diaganolly from each other. Anyways I heard my father in
the kitchen talking to a woman. I could hear his words cleary but the womans
words were all jumbled. Then I realized that while I was in the bathroom
I never heard my dads car come in the driveway (the bathroom overlooks
he drive and were only about 30 yrds from the main st.)&nbsp; Needless
to say I freaked out, got dressed as fast as I could and took off. I forgot
to bring my money and had to bring my friends back with me.</B>
<BR><B>Then about a week later I heard the sound of people walking in the
laundry room which from the top of the stairs you look down on. But when
I looked there was no one there and you could still here the sounds. Interestingly
the door from the cellar is on the floor about 6ft x&nbsp; 3ft, you have
to lift it up and put a piece of wood there to hold it. The cellar is dirt
and has some crawl space to it. It's really spooky down there. A few other
things happened, like things falling but nothing major until I was 22.
I had moved out when I was 18 but then moved back when I was 22. One night
I was there alone. (my father worked nights) and I was sleeping when al
of a sudden I was jolted awake by the sound of pounding coming down the
wall which my bed was next to. The other side was the hallway. I just froze,
I knew I was awake and not dreaming and that I was still alone because
it was too early for my father to come home. I always slept with my door
closed so I didnt see anything. I can't explain what all that was and my
father never really believed me until one night he was woken up to the
distinct voice of my mother saying his name. (now my mother is still alive
but she lived about 1000 miles away)&nbsp; when he looked up his door shut,
which had been open. And there was not any type of breeze.</B>
<BR><B>I know these things may not sound very scary but they were then
at the time. Even now to go in to my dads house alone you get a very uneasy
feeling.&nbsp; Also after I told my family these things my oldest brother
(by 11 years) said that when he was little and our house was still one
story and very small he saw a ghost in the bathroom door late at night,
and my sister-in-law said that my other brother told here that lthe light
in the closet above the cellar door use to go off anf on by its self and
you could see the light come from below the door shining out. The switch
was a pull one from the light socket.</B>
<BR><B>Don't know what to make of all of this but thanks for listening.</B>

<P><B>My Friend</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lzolper@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Here's my story. Some friends of mine had a house in 1994 in college.
They</B>
<BR><B>told me about all kinds of strange things. One time, they were downstairs</B>
<BR><B>and there was a loud pounding going through the whole house for
about 3</B>
<BR><B>minutes. Another time, one roommate thought he heard another in
the next</B>
<BR><B>room arh=guing with someone, no one was in the room. A few times,
they would</B>
<BR><B>leave and come back and all the doors were open. I only lived there
for one</B>
<BR><B>summer and had only one thing happen to me. I was in my room alone
and just</B>
<BR><B>got this creepy feeling. After a while it got worse until I HAD
to get out</B>
<BR><B>of the house, I was petrified. I HAD to leave.</B>
<BR><B>The worst thing though, happened at the end. We had all left for
home for</B>
<BR><B>two weeks but one guy stayed. He was alone in the house for about
two weeks.</B>
<BR><B>He was acting weird for a few days after we got back. At this time
we had</B>
<BR><B>all moved out and he was still the only one there. I caught him
outside</B>
<BR><B>"praying" once in the back yard. A few days later, he killed himself.
He was</B>
<BR><B>in probably the worst room in the house. We found a note that was
mostly</B>
<BR><B>illegible. I just remember one line. "God is God, You're not God"</B>
<BR><B>I actually haven't thought about that place in a while, but we were
talking</B>
<BR><B>about it the other day. I just realized today that our friend died
this week</B>
<BR><B>seven years ago.</B>
<BR><B>Have you ever heard of something like this?</B>

<P><B>My Friends Mother</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: edward5logan@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>August 28th, 2001</B><B></B>

<P><B>This happened maybe 6 or 7 years ago.&nbsp; Maybe 10.</B>
<BR><B>My friend's mother had just died and my friend, his bother, and
his sister were at the house.</B>
<BR><B>They were getting ready to go up to the funeral home for the viewing.</B>
<BR><B>When they left the house my friend asked his sister if she had turned
out all of the lights.</B>
<BR><B>She said she had turned out all of the lights except for the one
in Mom's room.</B>
<BR><B>She said she knew the light was on because she could see the light
leaking around and under the door.</B>
<BR><B>The time was about 6 PM In the middle of winter.&nbsp; She told
my friend "Mom would not let me in".</B>
<BR><B>Upon hearing this my friend&nbsp; turned the car around and went
back to the house.</B>
<BR><B>It took my friend and his brother both to push the door open, there
was a heavy chest behind the door.</B>
<BR><B>The windows were shut and locked and that was the only enterance
to the room.</B>
<BR><B>My friend even looked for footprints in the snow outside the room.</B>
<BR><B>If there is anymore to this story I have never heard it.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Ghostly and Spiritual Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pleonard@bctonline.com]</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi everyone out there who is believer and non believer.&nbsp; I am
24 with 2</B>
<BR><B>kids. My story starts when I was quite young. My family has always
had</B>
<BR><B>spirits that follow us. My first experience was when I was about
7. When</B>
<BR><B>I was 5 we had a german shepard named Barney that had to be put
to sleep</B>
<BR><B>because he had hip problems and could hardly walk. I was devastated
when</B>
<BR><B>he had to be put down and I cried for days. Two years later I was</B>
<BR><B>outside playing in the yard and even though I could not see him
I could</B>
<BR><B>feel him running next to me. I used to let him pull me around by
putting</B>
<BR><B>my finger through the loop on the end of his choke chain. I could
also</B>
<BR><B>feel that around my finger. As I was growing up I always saw shadows</B>
<BR><B>when no one else was home, I heard footsteps when there wasn't anything</B>
<BR><B>or anyone around. The pets we had would bark at corners of walls
at</B>
<BR><B>nothing and so forth. I never really thought much about it because
in my</B>
<BR><B>house it was a normal occurance. When I became a teenager these
noises</B>
<BR><B>and shadows started to become more apparent to me. One time I had
spent</B>
<BR><B>the night at my boyfriend at the time, his parents house in his
neices</B>
<BR><B>room. This girl definetly had problems and I didn't understand why
until</B>
<BR><B>that night. I was laying in her bed asleep when suddenly I awoke
to the</B>
<BR><B>room being so cold I wanted to pull the covers over my head just
to stay</B>
<BR><B>warm. I couldn't see anything, there was a little bit of light coming
in</B>
<BR><B>the window from outside, but I could feel an energy that was very
strong</B>
<BR><B>and slightly evil. I wanted to jump out of the bed and run to my</B>
<BR><B>boyfriend who was asleep in the next room but I was absolutely frozen
in</B>
<BR><B>fear. So as I layed there paralyzed not knowing what to do I just
waited</B>
<BR><B>and it was almost like the energy realized that I wasn't who it
was</B>
<BR><B>expecting and as soon as it was there it was gone. That was many
years</B>
<BR><B>ago and since then I have had many experiences. The house that my</B>
<BR><B>husband and I live in is haunted, actually more like the property
that</B>
<BR><B>it is on is haunted. But we both have spirits that follow us. I
hear at</B>
<BR><B>night footsteps on our porch and knocks on the door and walls outside.</B>
<BR><B>When I look out the window there is nothing there. Then one day
about 6</B>
<BR><B>months ago my 14 month old son was laying on the couch because he
had a</B>
<BR><B>very bad virus. He&nbsp; was asleep and I was in the kitchen making
dinner.</B>
<BR><B>Everything was quiet when suddenly I heard this voice say to my
son, "It</B>
<BR><B>is okay give me your hand. Everything is going to be okay" Right
before</B>
<BR><B>I heard the voice my son had whimpered but after the voice spoke
to him</B>
<BR><B>he sighed in relief and relaxed into a deep sleep. When he awoke
he was</B>
<BR><B>70 % better. I later described the voice to my husband and he said
that</B>
<BR><B>he believes that it is the spirit of his best friend who died during</B>
<BR><B>high school. I also believe this to be true. My son will talk to
someone</B>
<BR><B>I can't see and he will tell them goodbye when they leave. I may
not be</B>
<BR><B>able to see them but I can sense them when they are here. The most</B>
<BR><B>recent experience I had was just a few weeks ago up in my deceased</B>
<BR><B>mother in laws house. Her husband is still alive and had invited
us up.</B>
<BR><B>He wasn't home when we got there but left us a key so we could get
in.</B>
<BR><B>Since the weather was so nice we had decided to stay outside and
let the</B>
<BR><B>kids play.&nbsp; My daughter decided that she had to go to the bathroom
and I</B>
<BR><B>was the one who took her in. Upon getting to the hallway which the</B>
<BR><B>bathroom was at the end of, it sounded like a wind tunnel, I heard</B>
<BR><B>whispering and just felt a very strong sense that his mother was
still</B>
<BR><B>there. Well her spirit anyway. It was almost as if she was there</B>
<BR><B>watching us. I was okay with it then but now whenever I think about
it I</B>
<BR><B>get really creeped out. Just a few days ago I learned that her ashes
are</B>
<BR><B>kept in an earn on the fireplace mantle. She even comes to me sometimes</B>
<BR><B>and puts her hand on my back. I am just very puzzled by this because
she</B>
<BR><B>and I didn't get along as well as I would have liked when she was
alive</B>
<BR><B>but I know that she is in a better place. Any way I hope that you
have</B>
<BR><B>enjoyed my experiences and if you have any of your own don't think
that</B>
<BR><B>you are crazy just gifted to be sensative to the paranormal.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Grandfather</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jenny_fer69@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My grandfather worked for the parks and recreation department here
in</B>
<BR><B>Colorado.&nbsp; They lived im an old house on the fairgrounds.&nbsp;
My mother, aunt</B>
<BR><B>and uncle also lived there with my grandparents.&nbsp; From what
I was told, the</B>
<BR><B>first experience was when the family went to California on vacation.&nbsp;
They</B>
<BR><B>had an old coffee pot that came on automatically when plugged in,
so they</B>
<BR><B>left it unplugged.&nbsp; My mom would wake up to find the coffee
pot plugged in</B>
<BR><B>and coffee made.&nbsp; When the family returned it started to get
worse.&nbsp; They</B>
<BR><B>always locked the doors at night when they went to bed.&nbsp; Very
often they</B>
<BR><B>would wake up to the front door slamming open and hear someone run
through</B>
<BR><B>the house and the back door slam open and closed.&nbsp; More than
once family or</B>
<BR><B>friends would come and stay the night and wake up the next morning
asking</B>
<BR><B>why someone was leaning over them breathing while they were sleeping.</B>
<BR><B>Needless to say, no one outside of the family would ever spend the
night at</B>
<BR><B>the house.&nbsp; My uncle was taking a shower, in the house alone.&nbsp;
He was</B>
<BR><B>standing over the sink and the shower door started slamming open
and shut on</B>
<BR><B>its own.&nbsp; Also on the fairgrounds there is a big building that
they used for</B>
<BR><B>concerts etc.&nbsp; There were a few different rooms in the buildings
with locked</B>
<BR><B>glass doors connecting them.&nbsp; At night they was always a security
guard on</B>
<BR><B>duty.&nbsp; All the outside doors to the building were always closed
and locked.</B>
<BR><B>I think they went through like 4 different security guards.&nbsp;
All at once the</B>
<BR><B>INSIDE glass doors would start rattling, which was impossible for
someone to</B>
<BR><B>do because the outside doors were always locked.&nbsp; There are
many other</B>
<BR><B>occurrences.&nbsp; Lots of things happened in the 10 years we all
lived there.</B>
<BR><B>After we left the house was tore down.&nbsp; We did go to the library
and found</B>
<BR><B>that there was a nursing home on the property a long time ago.&nbsp;
When the</B>
<BR><B>patients died they were buried behind the nursing home...around
the area the</B>
<BR><B>house was later built.&nbsp; The fairgrounds also have a network
of underground</B>
<BR><B>tunnels that run through the entire fairgrounds.</B>

<P><B>My Moms Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: amanda_193@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When my mom was 12 she lived with her mother, father, brothers and
sisters.</B>
<BR><B>They lived in North Dakota and owned a house. Before they moved
there, this</B>
<BR><B>one guy who lived there and got tired of his life and shot himself
in his</B>
<BR><B>own basement, 5 years later my grandma and grandpa moved there and
have been</B>
<BR><B>noticing strange things happening like, hammers being thrown and
almost</B>
<BR><B>getting hit by them, the tv turning on by itself, footsteps, being
touched</B>
<BR><B>by someone that isn't even there, stuff floating in the air, and
cats acting</B>
<BR><B>strange. Well time has passed. Last year on Christmas I went to
my grandma's</B>
<BR><B>and grandpa's house. I spent the night there, when everybody was
asleep I</B>
<BR><B>stayed awake wondering if I would hear something. I was sleeping
on the</B>
<BR><B>couch and there were other people in the same room, they were also
sleeping.</B>
<BR><B>I was about to fall asleep when I heard somebody walking in the
kitchen I</B>
<BR><B>opened my eyes and stood up to look, but saw nothing. I pulled the
covers</B>
<BR><B>over my head, of course I was scared. It seemed that my cousin heard
the</B>
<BR><B>same thing and was scared as hell also. 2 hours passed and I was
asleep.</B>
<BR><B>Then there was this big boom down in the basement. Everybody heard
it, my</B>
<BR><B>grandpa woke up and went down to the basement to see what it was
and saw</B>
<BR><B>hammers laying on the floor. There was a spirit in the house an
angry</B>
<BR><B>spirit, we all stayed awake all night and suddenly heard the basement
door</B>
<BR><B>open and we all got as scared as hell. My heart was going 100 miles
per</B>
<BR><B>hour, then the door opened again and shut. It seemed the spirit
went back to</B>
<BR><B>the basement. Me and my mom ran out of there not even looking back,
and went</B>
<BR><B>home never wanting to go back there again.</B>

<P><B>My Parents House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Rabecbrown@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>This may sound stupid, but I grew up in a haunted house and didn't
even know</B>
<BR><B>it until after I moved out. This wasn't particularly scary, just
sort of</B>
<BR><B>interesting.</B>
<BR><B>In the late 80's my parents bought a three bedroom ranch-style home
in Orange</B>
<BR><B>County California when I was about 13. They bought it pretty cheap;
as it</B>
<BR><B>required a lot of remodeling. My father was pretty handy though,
and started</B>
<BR><B>remodeling the place room by room.&nbsp; In my opinion, this must
have set off the</B>
<BR><B>ghost.&nbsp; I always got that sort of creepy feeling that I was
being watched,</B>
<BR><B>and I really didn't like being in that house alone. I didn't feel
threatened</B>
<BR><B>or frightened. I just felt a little weird. The temperature of the
place was</B>
<BR><B>also always pretty cool.&nbsp; Even in the middle of summer when
it was positively</B>
<BR><B>roasting outside.&nbsp; Anyhow, on more than one occasion I was
awakened in the</B>
<BR><B>middle of the night for no reason.&nbsp; The house was quiet and
there didn't</B>
<BR><B>appear to be any commotion.&nbsp; I just awoke with a start, would
look around my</B>
<BR><B>dark bedroom in a daze and then fall back asleep.&nbsp; I was a
pretty heavy</B>
<BR><B>sleeper back then, so I attributed it to a bad dream.&nbsp; One
night I was</B>
<BR><B>awakened this way, only I knew what did it. Someone had snapped
their fingers</B>
<BR><B>in my ear. In fact, my ear was literally vibrating from the sound
of it.</B>
<BR><B>Again, I went back to sleep, assuming it was a dream.&nbsp; On a
couple of</B>
<BR><B>different occasions I woke up from noises, like rapping on my bedroom
door</B>
<BR><B>and random noises in the house that had no explanation. I'd get
up, thinking</B>
<BR><B>my parents were awake or that my sister had gotten home, but everyone
would</B>
<BR><B>be asleep and the house would be pitch black. I know this sounds
pretty</B>
<BR><B>dense, but I just dismissed it.&nbsp; Well many years passed, and
I moved out to</B>
<BR><B>go away to college.&nbsp; Just a short time after that my father
passed away and</B>
<BR><B>my mother was forced to sell the house because she couldn't afford
to keep it</B>
<BR><B>without my father's income.&nbsp; One night I spent the evening
at my sister's</B>
<BR><B>house, sitting on her porch having a few drinks and talking.&nbsp;
We got to</B>
<BR><B>talking about ghosts (she has a ghost-cat in her apartment. that
she has seen</B>
<BR><B>a few times). Well, she asked me if I ever saw the "guy" at mom
and dad's old</B>
<BR><B>place.&nbsp; Come to find out, both she and my mom had many encounters
with this</B>
<BR><B>ghost.&nbsp; One two separate occasions, my sister was in her bed
asleep and awoke</B>
<BR><B>to the ghost of a middle-aged man, dressed in blue-jeans and a plaid
shirt</B>
<BR><B>standing at the end of her bed.&nbsp; The first time she gasped
and sat up,</B>
<BR><B>staring at him in disbelief.&nbsp; His figure became more transparent
and slowly</B>
<BR><B>rose to the top of the ceiling where he eventually disappeared.
The second</B>
<BR><B>time he appeared she just laid there looking at him.&nbsp; He just
stood there</B>
<BR><B>looking at her and faded away a few minutes later. She said he seemed
sad,</B>
<BR><B>but not menacing.&nbsp; Just sort of curious.&nbsp; Another time
she awoke to the</B>
<BR><B>sounds of someone in the garage.&nbsp; The wall to her bedroom was
shared with the</B>
<BR><B>back wall of the garage. My dad had the garage fashioned as his
tool-room.</B>
<BR><B>The walls were covered with hooks that all his tools hung from,
and he also</B>
<BR><B>had several of those huge red metal cabinets that held tools as
well.&nbsp; She</B>
<BR><B>heard someone walking around in there, moving the tools around and
opening</B>
<BR><B>the drawers of the cabinets.&nbsp; She got up and crept into the
front hall and</B>
<BR><B>stood, listening to the moving around for a while.&nbsp; Finally,
my mom came out</B>
<BR><B>of her and my dad's bedroom and stood with her, listening.&nbsp;
My sister asked</B>
<BR><B>her if she should call the police and my mom said no, it happens
all the time</B>
<BR><B>and it is not an intruder. Of course, she realized my mom knew about
the</B>
<BR><B>ghost, but didn't ask her any questions.&nbsp; I think she figured
my mom would</B>
<BR><B>never admit that the place was haunted. The weird thing is, at night,
both my</B>
<BR><B>mom and my dad's cars were parked in the garage, and they left no
room for</B>
<BR><B>movement in there whatsoever.&nbsp; So, how the heck would a physical
person</B>
<BR><B>actually be able to get at the tools, much less open those huge
metal drawers</B>
<BR><B>to get at the tools inside?</B>
<BR><B>After hearing her stories, I got to thinking and we both surmised
that the</B>
<BR><B>ghost was from the late 50's, right around the time the place was
built.&nbsp; His</B>
<BR><B>clothing and hairstyle suggested that.&nbsp; Judging by the way
the house felt, we</B>
<BR><B>both could tell that he liked our family and approved of the improvements
my</B>
<BR><B>father did.&nbsp; I think he sort of looked out for us, and didn't
really appear</B>
<BR><B>to me because he probably knew I'd have a heart attack if I saw
a ghost. My</B>
<BR><B>sister, on the other hand, has experienced many paranormal happenings</B>
<BR><B>throughout her life and is more used to it.</B>
<BR><B>The whole time I lived there, it didn't occur to me that it was
a ghost</B>
<BR><B>making the noise at night. And, my mother and sister never mentioned
to me</B>
<BR><B>their experiences while we still lived there. My dad never mentioned
anything</B>
<BR><B>at all. But then again, he was the no-nonsense sort who probably
wouldn't</B>
<BR><B>believe in the paranormal.&nbsp; Even though, after his death he
visited my</B>
<BR><B>sister, my mom and me in our dreams. But that is another story!</B><B></B>

his mother</B>
<BR><B>heard his grandmothers humming &amp; singing, And she smelled her
perfume, and</B>
<BR><B>the rocking chair would be rocking, But when she walked into his
room noone</B>
<BR><B>was there. When he told me, I thought that was very cool.&nbsp;
P.S:&nbsp; I guess she</B>
<BR><B>was holding him when she was passed away since she couldn't when
she was</B>
<BR><B>alive!</B>

<P><B>i still believe n ghosts, but when i was about 5 or 6 when i</B>
<BR><B>use 2 b shy, my grandparents had these neighborhood watch meetings,
n i</B>
<BR><B>didn't like goin' 2 them, so i would stay n the living room, n u
could see</B>
<BR><B>inside my room from the living room, and n my room it was my bed
and a small</B>
<BR><B>dresser n front of my bed, but ne way, that night n particular i
was in the</B>
<BR><B>living room n i didn't want 2 go downstairs wit my daddy n i was
lookin' n</B>
<BR><B>my room, n i saw a black shadow like figure in front of the dresser,</B>
<BR><B>everything i did it would copy me, at the time i wasn't scared of
it, i just</B>
<BR><B>figured it was a friend that wanted 2 play. when i walked towards
it, it</B>
<BR><B>would walk 2wards me, if i stepped back it would step back, but
just when i</B>
<BR><B>was about 2 go all the way n my room 2 play wit it, my granddaddy
told me 2</B>
<BR><B>go downstairs wit my daddy so i could have somethin' 2 do. Also
a few months</B>
<BR><B>later another experience had happened. my uncle had died in the
room across</B>
<BR><B>the hall a few yrs. ago, n the bathroom is right next 2 my room.
so 1 night</B>
<BR><B>i was sleepin' wit my grandma n we was sleepin' at the foot of the
bed, i</B>
<BR><B>had woke up n i laid on my back n i looked out n the living room,
n all of a</B>
<BR><B>sudden the bathroom light flashed on and off n just seconds n the
odd thing</B>
<BR><B>was the bathroom door was closed. the next day i asked my granddaddy
was he</B>
<BR><B>n the bathroom that night n he told me no. i've had more experiences
since</B>
<BR><B>that, but it's 2 much 2 type, mayb next time though. if ne would
like 2</B>
<BR><B>respond or had similiar experiences</B>
