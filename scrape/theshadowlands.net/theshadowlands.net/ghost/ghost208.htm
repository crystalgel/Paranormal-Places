<p><b>The Two Little Children</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:gr1bcz@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm only 12 years old, but I'm very open minded and try everything
once before I say I don't like it...But anywho...it was like November of
2000, and i was home alone with my baby sister (2 years) and my parents
were out getting dinner. It was about 6:30 p.m. i was listening to a C.D.
and my sister was standing on the living room table. The angle it was at
i could see into my sisters room.The door to her room was open. So I was
playing with my sister, and I look at her door and I saw a little girl
go into her room. She had long black to dark brown hair, she was wearing
a&nbsp; green&nbsp; nightgown or something. So I went to go check and&nbsp;
if there was really anyone in there, and to my disbelief there was NO ONE
there. I was really scared at first because I was home alone, and didn't
know what to do. So I walk out and shut the door. When my mom came home
and I said, "Mom I saw something, I think it was a ghost". Of course she
didn't believe me. So I ask my friend for help, she believed me. Then after
a couple of days I was talking to my mom in the kitchen, and I turned around
I saw a little boy about 4 or 5 years old. He was just staring. Then I
turned around again and said to my mom, "Look!Look!Don't you see it"? She
said, "Very funny sweetie you and your crazy imagination." So I decided
to not tell her anything about what I was seeing. So I decided to see if
my dad would believe me, but of course he didn't.So I did'nt tell them
anything about. Then after I ate I was in my room it was about 10:30 p.m.,
and I was wacthing T.V. getting ready to go to bed. Then all of the sudden
I heard someone callingmy name. Every one in the house was asleep, so I
knew it wasn't anyone in the house. So I went to check, NO ONE waas there.
The voice sounded like it was in trouble or anxious. So far that's all
that has happened to me. I also forgot to put in that when I saw the girl
it got very cold and things move all the time.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Heres a Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: karenlin@optonline.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This story happened to me about a few years ago. I use to live in
Queens. Our family use to be kind of poor, we couldnt afford much of a
house. However, we rented the upstairs of an old womens house. There were
two bedrooms, a tiny kitchen and a rather small bathroom with a small tub.
The lady that lived beneath us (who rented the upstairs to us ) looked
kind, and sweet. However she also seemed kind of, not "sane". She smiled
to much, and she constantly glared at me when I was in the garden. I was
only about 7 or 8 at that time when this incident happened. We lived there
for about four years. It only happened once,&nbsp; but once was enough.</b>
<br><b>I was a serious believer in ghosts, I had been told at a young age
by my freinds about Bloody Mary, and those ghost that live in mirrors.
I was so scared, I begged my parents to have the mirrors in my room removed,
and being the nice parents they were, they took them away. I remembered
it was during a really hot summer's night I woke up and needed to use the
bathroom urgently. I got up and ran to the bathroom, I rarely ever closed
the door, because in case any "ghost" ever came I wanted to run out. But
that night was diffrent. I went and used the bathroom, and all of a sudden,
I began to sweat. My body felt sticky all over. I decided to wash my face
and arms off a little bit with cold water. I looked into the mirror, and
quickly looked away (because being the supersticious girl I am and was,
I never looked in the mirror at night) But something made me look back
at the mirror, not exactly a force, but a curiousity, a very very strong
curiousity. I looked and there in the far corner was a girl, and right
befor my eyes, I saw the girl with an extremly pale face look at me. As
if she saw me, but saw through me, as if I wasnt there. At that time I
was to scared to move, afraid if I turned around I would see her face to
face. But I couldn't take my eyes away from the mirror, or her. I saw her
slowly get onto the side of the tub, and she fell, she fell into the tub.
I had a sudden urge to puke, but nothing was more important then getting
out of that bathroom. I worked up all the guts I had and ran to my parents
room screaming at the top of my lungs. Ofcourse my parents did not believe
me at all. I got a short lecture and was sent back to bed. I layed there
and the clock was ticking, slowly, and I felt like I would never fall asleep.
A few mins later, I heard my door creak open, I knew it was my mom comeing
in to comfort me, so I looked up with arms open for her to give me a hug.
But it wasnt her, the same girl in the bathroom came into my room, At this
time I realized how young she was, I watched her closely as she walked
across the room toward my bed. I couldnt move, but for a moment, I didn't
want to movve, I wanted to stay and talk to her. She made her way to my
bed and she came under the covers next to me . I guess mabey I fell asleep,
because it was morning when I reoppened my eyes.&nbsp; That day I decided
to keep my mouth shut, befor my parents ended up sending me to a mental
institution. A few months later I was in the garden, and the old lady came
outside and sat beside me. For the first time I realized how kind she looked.
And I felt warm inside. She told me a story, about her grand daughter.
How she use to live in the very same place my family and I were liveing
now. She went on and on about how cute and beautiful she was. I told her
I met her. And I told her what happened the previoiuse night. I wanted
to know what happened, and she was hesitant to tell me, because of my young
age. But she told me, she said one summer's night in the year 92 she was
waiting for her mom to give her a bubble bath, she got onto the rail of
the tub, and fell off. She hit her head on the tile floor. And by the time
her mother came in, she had bled to death.</b>
<br><b>A few months later, my parents found a small house in Boston, that
we could afford. And I never knew what became of the old lady, and the
ghost of her grandaughter.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Meet The Shadowpeople</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DooMofWorlds666@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well, this story is something that still bothers me to this day,
not to</b>
<br><b>mention a few friends of mine and others who have seen them. What
I mean by</b>
<br><b>them is what we call the shadow people for lack of a better name.
The first</b>
<br><b>and only time I ever saw them and hopefully the last, was at a place
we</b>
<br><b>called the lost city. This was an old oil refinery on core of engineer</b>
<br><b>property. It exploded twenty some odd years ago and they just let
the woods</b>
<br><b>grow up around it. OK let me describe this place, it is a large
concert</b>
<br><b>structure along with some iron and the lower part is filled with
water part</b>
<br><b>of the year. We would go out there and hang out when I was in high
school.</b>
<br><b>One thing you have to understand is that IM from a small county
full of small</b>
<br><b>towns and there is not to much for kids to do.</b>
<br><b>Well, me and two friends of mine Greg and Justin where out there
on a weekend</b>
<br><b>in 1998 on a somewhat moon lit night in may sitting around in my
car. We</b>
<br><b>where just sitting there BSing hopeing someone would show up. As
we sat there</b>
<br><b>talking about where to go look for a party next Justin told us to
hush. He</b>
<br><b>said he heard someone talking so me and Greg shut up and listened.
We did not</b>
<br><b>hear anything and after a few minutes went back to BSing. Then we
all heard</b>
<br><b>it and decided it had to be someone trying to scare us. So we got
out of the</b>
<br><b>car and started yelling and cursing at them letting them know we
knew they</b>
<br><b>where out there trying to scare us. The sound did not stop and still
thought</b>
<br><b>it was someone not something. It was not exactly like talking more
like</b>
<br><b>mumbling and hissing but we felt like it was a person even though
it was not</b>
<br><b>quite human sounding.</b>
<br><b>We started toward the wood line with my tire tool and a couple of
sticks. we</b>
<br><b>got about fifty feet away when Greg said stop. We did and he pointed
at a</b>
<br><b>spot where he said he saw someone. We looked for a few minutes and
finally</b>
<br><b>could see something moving in the moon light. So Justin told me
to go turn on</b>
<br><b>the head lights on the car. I did and when the lights hit the woods
we saw</b>
<br><b>nothing but trees but the sound stopped. At this point we where
less Cretan</b>
<br><b>that it was somebody we knew and started to get a little spooked.
We</b>
<br><b>discussed that it might be some crazy people or worse and yes monsters
ghost</b>
<br><b>and aliens did come up too.</b>
<br><b>At this point we decided to go so we got in the car and I started
to turn</b>
<br><b>around. When I did the sound started up again and we could see shadows
moving</b>
<br><b>around in the wood line and the grass. they looked like people but
only the</b>
<br><b>dark outline of them like seeing someone standing in the dark at
a</b>
<br><b>distance.the sound was no louder than the first time but the shadows
had us</b>
<br><b>terifed.I can not say for sure how many there where at the time
it seemed</b>
<br><b>like a lot but also one was to many for us. We where kinda panicked
by this</b>
<br><b>and I was working feverishly to turn around in the clearing and
get us down</b>
<br><b>the dirt road. While I was turning my lights hit one of the figures
and it</b>
<br><b>disappeared but when my lights left it was still in the same spot.
we got the</b>
<br><b>hell out of there as fast as my car would let us. None of us have
ever been</b>
<br><b>back and we have not really talked about it much either.</b>
<br><b>We told only a few close friends and family members about what we
saw. Yet we</b>
<br><b>are not the only ones to have seen them and that's not the only
location</b>
<br><b>either. I have heard story's that other people have encountered
them as well.</b>
<br><b>I don't know who started calling them the shadow people but that's
what they</b>
<br><b>are know as to evryone.I even started calling them that for lack
of a better</b>
<br><b>name but would very much like to know what they are, I still get
chills when</b>
<br><b>I think about them and what they looked like.</b>

<br><b>Ghosts and Grandmothers Gift</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: thugentober@custom.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My grandmother was gifted with what she called 'second sight'. She
said that once she even saw death. Once she was picking cotton in Oklahoma
on her uncle George's farm, he had been ill for some time and was inside
staying out of the heat.&nbsp; While working she saw something coming down
the cotton row. It was black and close to the ground like a spider and
it cast no shadow. She saw it go into the house and afraid for her uncle
she followed. She went to his room calling him and as she entered the room
she saw the black shape go out the window. Her Uncle George lay dead on
his bed.&nbsp; This was only one of the may tales she told me and I thought
they were only tales until I had an exoerience of my own years later. My
husband and I rented an old farm house in Indiana. The home had been part
of the under ground railroad and had very few improvements. The upstairs
had been unvisited for years. The huge old furniture which had been hoisted
up cranes and brought in from the outside had not been disturbed for decades.
There was and inch of dust on the wood floor boards. On the wall there
was a large drawing done in pencil of a woman in a long dress, written
under it Mamma. There were steep stairs to the main floor and the door
had the bottom of the stairs had an old worn leather strap which was used
to lock the door from the down stairs. On the inside of the door at the
foot of the stairs were deep gashes in the wood. At night I could here
steps running up and down those stairs, sometimes very loudly and other
times shuffling and rustling softly. Steam would eminate from the door
and there was a fine mold on the walls that no amount of scrubbing would
get rid of. On several occasions I had tthe sense of fleeting movement
out of the corner of my eye. And always there was noise. The house was
sold to a folk lore professor and I moved out. I have experienced other
things, but none so eerie as the ghost in that old house.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Cornish Ghosts</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I don't know what you'll make of this. I'm very careful who I tell,
but here</b>
<br><b>goes..</b>
<br><b>About eight years ago I was employed by a letting company in cornwall
uk</b>
<br><b>where i live. I cleaned holiday cottages in the fishing village
of Port</b>
<br><b>Issac.One of the buildings was a very old cottage with immediate
frontage to</b>
<br><b>the sea and was originally one house, but had been split into two.
I was</b>
<br><b>cleaning one day&nbsp; and I went out onto the patio to clean out
the toaster</b>
<br><b>which was full of crumbs.It was broad daylight and a nice sunny
day.All of a</b>
<br><b>sudden I started to feel strange.I felt as if someone was pouring
a bucket</b>
<br><b>of cool water over my head but in very slow motion.I could hear
this noise</b>
<br><b>like an untuned radio like lots of voices all merged together.As
I stood</b>
<br><b>there this scene appeared.There were people in victorian type dress
stood on</b>
<br><b>the patio, all seemed to be dressed very somberely and they were
talking in</b>
<br><b>small groups but i couldn't tell what they were saying as all the
sound was</b>
<br><b>merged.Some of them were holding wine glasses in their hands.There
was a</b>
<br><b>woman in a black dress and bonnet shouting at a small boy who was
sat</b>
<br><b>playing on the patio.She was crying and looked very distressed.I
was looking</b>
<br><b>at this scene but I knew that I wasn't a part ot it and that they
didn't see</b>
<br><b>me.It was just like looking at a film or a tv screen.I checked myself
as I</b>
<br><b>couldn't believe what was happening.I tried to pull away from the
scene and</b>
<br><b>managed to get indoors .when I got in I felt so sick and dizzy and
had to</b>
<br><b>lean over the sink and splashed myself with cold water.I really
thought I</b>
<br><b>was going mad. I carried on with the cleaning but I felt really
weak and</b>
<br><b>wobbly.About five minutes later the voices came back.I was cleaning
the</b>
<br><b>staircase down,&nbsp; and I started feeling cold again.I just locked
the door and</b>
<br><b>left.</b>
<br><b>I drove home but I don't know how as I was shaking like a leaf.I

<br><b>stand by my story.A couple of weeks later i spoke to the lady who
ran the</b>

<br><b>and that there was a memorial stone on the back of the house.I went

<br><b>The Ghost Upstairs and Our Haunted Basement</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Doolenz@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>We moved into our current house about 6 years ago and until about
1 year ago,</b>
<br><b>we never really had any paranormal experiences.&nbsp; I am the only
one who has</b>
<br><b>actually seen our ghost.&nbsp; About a year ago, I awoke to go to
the bathroom,</b>
<br><b>and I wanted to check on my little brother, whose room was down
the hall from</b>
<br><b>the bathroom.&nbsp; When I went into his room, I saw a tall figure,
bathed in a</b>
<br><b>blue-ish white light, standing next to his bed, looking down at
him.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>assumed it was my mom, since she checks on him during the night
as well.&nbsp; But</b>
<br><b>when I left my brother's room, I saw my mom laying in her bed.&nbsp;
She asked me</b>
<br><b>if I had just been in my brother's room, and I said yeah, and asked
her if</b>
<br><b>she had been in there too.&nbsp; She said no, but she saw something
walk in there</b>
<br><b>before me.&nbsp; I just went back to bed, thinking nothing of it.&nbsp;
Then about 3</b>
<br><b>months later, my step dad moved to Nebraska and he took my bed and
left me an</b>
<br><b>air matress. I was sleeping on it, facing my door one night when
I awoke to</b>
<br><b>find my light on.&nbsp; I thought this to be strange and I turned
it off...then I</b>
<br><b>saw a bright white figure dash into the bathroom.&nbsp; I got scared
and closed my</b>
<br><b>door.&nbsp; I awoke later to find my light on again and electronics
in my</b>
<br><b>brother's room going off.&nbsp; I was the only one who heard them
going off the</b>
<br><b>whole night long.&nbsp; My mom hears walking in the upstairs, mostly
in my room,</b>
<br><b>when either everyone is gone or when everyone is sleeping.&nbsp;
We contacted a</b>
<br><b>friend of my mom's whose ex-husband is a pyschic.&nbsp; He said
that our ghost is</b>
<br><b>a man who has a dog.&nbsp; He had a daughter who died in the area
that is now my</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; I have grown to love this ghost as I think he protects
me and fears</b>
<br><b>for my safety.&nbsp; Whenever I am gone for the night, my mom hears
pacing back</b>
<br><b>and forth in my room.&nbsp; She walks upstairs, goes to my door
and says "Meghan</b>
<br><b>is not going to be here tonight, she will be back tomorrow" or whenever
I'll</b>
<br><b>be back and the pacing immediately stops.&nbsp; I think the ghost
is worried about</b>
<br><b>me dying, such as his daughter did.</b>
<br><b>I have also seen ghosts in our basement.&nbsp; That has only happened
several</b>
<br><b>times, but both times it scared me.&nbsp; The first time, I was
home alone and was</b>
<br><b>watching tv in the basement.&nbsp; I was sitting on the floor with
my left arm</b>
<br><b>resting on the right arm of the couch down there.&nbsp; All of a
sudden, I felt</b>
<br><b>this strong urge to turn around because someone was looking at me.&nbsp;
Well, I</b>
<br><b>did turn my head and about 6 inches to my right, there was a pair
of legs,</b>
<br><b>clothed in jeans and wearing cowboy boots.&nbsp; Floating next to
the legs was a</b>
<br><b>head and shoulders, with the head wearing a cowboy hat.&nbsp; I
quickly turned</b>
<br><b>around and resumed watching tv.&nbsp; I felt the urge to turn around
again and saw</b>
<br><b>the same apparition.&nbsp; I told my mom later and she said that
her friend (whose</b>
<br><b>ex-husband is the pyschic) said that when ghosts havn't been to
the living</b>
<br><b>world for a while, they have forgotten how they looked when they
were alive</b>
<br><b>and it isn't uncommon to find their bodies separated like the ghost
I saw</b>
<br><b>was.&nbsp; Then a couple of months later I was on the computer in
our basement and</b>
<br><b>I just happened to look towards our stairs and right behind the
water heater,</b>
<br><b>I saw a child's face, peeking around as if playing Peek-A-Boo with
me.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>disappeared right after I looked away.&nbsp; I have seen that child
several times,</b>
<br><b>once upstairs in our living room I saw it run into the kitchen.&nbsp;
The child</b>
<br><b>was very little, probably about 2 or 3 years old.&nbsp; It could
very well be the</b>
<br><b>little girl who died in our house and the daughter of the man who
haunts my</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; My mom also saw the child run in front of our tv when
she was in our</b>
<br><b>basement, on the computer.&nbsp; I can't say for sure that the ghost
is the little</b>
<br><b>girl because I couldn't tell if it was a boy or a girl.&nbsp; But
about 2 months</b>
<br><b>ago, my mom stopped hearing the walking upstairs and my room is
no longer as</b>
<br><b>cold as it used to be when the man was here.&nbsp; I think he left
after I turned</b>
<br><b>18, maybe thinking I can protect myself now.&nbsp; Sorry this is
so long, but</b>
<br><b>there was a lot to tell!</b><b></b>

<br><b>What Was It?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:eaustin@uoguelph.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>I don;t know if you would classify this as a huanting or a ghost.&nbsp;
I don't even know what to call it.</b>
<br><b>when I was younger, much younger, between the ages of 4 and 10,
I occasionally saw presences.&nbsp; I was lived in the house with my family
and my grandparents until I was 4.&nbsp; Shortly there we moved out and
rented a house.&nbsp; My brother was born there, and shortly after he was
born I began to see these presences.</b>
<br><b>The first one only occured at the rented house we lived in.&nbsp;
Almost I would often see a horrible figure on my wall.&nbsp; It was tall
and took up the whole wall and quite big.&nbsp; He had a long pointy nose,
and horns from his head and on his face.&nbsp; He was dressed like a man
though, he was wearing a suit.&nbsp; I called him the monster on my wall.&nbsp;
I don't know if it was a recurring nightmare, but it stopped when we moved
out.</b>
<br><b>The second presences was one of my parents and frightend me.&nbsp;
I would see the figures of my mother and father kneeling at my door way.&nbsp;
They were never together.&nbsp; One night it would be my mother, the next
it would be my father.&nbsp; My brother has never reported seeing anything
like this.&nbsp; It happened at the house we rented and when we moved out
of that house we moved back into the house that we lived in with my grandparents
only they had moved out.&nbsp; It continued there, and it still ocassionally
happens, but only when I'm at home, close by to my parents.&nbsp; I talked
to my mother about and she thought I was weird and seeing things, but it
happened every night for 6 years and occasionally happens now, I am now
20.</b>
<br><b>I have no idea what this could be, and I am looking for some idea
of what it might be.</b><b></b>

<br><b>I Followed Her</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: huntress_9999@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My first Encounter with the supernatural was when i was 13 at least
the first one i can remember. It was a house relatively new in michigan.
I know how it became haunted It had to of been the ouja board cause i dont
remember anything happening before that cursed game came into our house.
Well it was about 2:30a.m. and i sat bolt upright in bed and watched this
woman walk past my bedroom.( I need to tell you the layout of the house
and who was there) It was a ranch home my room was at the end of the hallway
There was a mirror on the wall a full leangth mirror on the wall, across
from my room was my parents room. Now turn left out of my room cause you
cant turn right theres a wall there and to the right was the bathroom and
to the left was my brothers room. Than you walk into the living room and
turn left to go into the kitchen than walk down 3 steps you can go outside
or walk down 12 steps to the basement which had a full bar and a family
room. ( Back to the storie) The only people in the house was my mom and
dad in there room my brother in his room and my sister and her husband
and my nephew in the basement on the hide-away-bed. I thought this woman
at first was my sister so i called her name in a loud whisper,(PAM) she
kept walking so i followed her i came out of my room and she was in the
living room i called her again(PAM) she rounded the corner into the kitchen
by the time i got to the kitchen she was rounding the basement steps Im
now getting a little louder and upset thinking my own sister is ignoring
me. Long storie short i followed her all the way down stairs i never seen
her climb into bed but i thought she made it there cause she was always
one step ahead of me the whole time anyway. I walked up to my sister and
shook her saying her name. She woke up and said (what whats the matter)
I said didnt you here me calling you? she said when i said just now when
you where up stairs she said i havnt been upstairs. I was pissed at this
point so i pulled down her covers. The woman i was following was wearing
a long white summer nite gown. And my sister was wearing a t-shirt and
panties. I started to cry and told her what happened and i made her walk
me back up stairs to my room where she slept with me the rest of the nite.
My sister knew i wouldnt make anything like that up, cause everyone in
my house on seltzer ( thats the name of my street) has had a paranormal
experience there and we all took everyone serious and with respect.&nbsp;
Im now 37 and still having paranormal experiences. My childern have had
them also ill try to keep these short. I lived in detroit with my new husband
and child in this house we were watching tv when all of the sudden it sounded
like someone was in the basement smashing bottle after bottle of pop or
what ever in the basement my husband and i ran down stairs but there was

<br><b>You be the Judge</b><b></b>

<p><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our house was haunted for about a year
and a half. It started in my room which was the room my father had just
added to the house. The first thing that happened is kind of embarrassing--I
was in my bathroom, which was part of my room. And I heard my door open
and close and someone in heels walk across the linoleum floor. I thought
it was my mom checking to see what temperature I had my A/C unit on. The
steps then came to a stop right in front of my bathroom door. The doorknob
shook. I said,"I'm in here" It shook again. I repeated, "I'm in here!"
And I heard the steps walk away. But I didnt hear the door open and close
again. After I was done, I went out into the house to see what my mom wanted
but she wasn't there. The ony people in the house were my grandmother (who
definitely could not wear anything with heels) and my baby neice who was
asleep.</b>
<br><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another afternoon, my sister and I were outside
cleaning the pool and we were the only ones around or in the house that
day. I ran inside to get an old pair of shoes. I had moved out of that
back room into a room right next to it. Coming out of the room, I shut
the door behind me and was thinking out loud, "Where are my black shoes?"
And then I saw a little person (boy or girl?) standing and looking up at
me. It was standing in the entrance of the hallway to the back room that
my dad had built, the one I had moved out of. All I could see were light
shoulders and face, dark hair like bangs, and dark eyes. No nose or mouth
could be seen. I gasped and stared at it while tyring to turn on the hall
light. It would not turn on. This light always had a mind of itself. I
then saw it turn around and run down my hallway to the old back room. I
saw its shoulders moving quickly from side to side, so I figured it was
running. I ran outside and told my sister--we stayed outside until my parents
came home.</b>
<br><b>3. One time my mother came home during her break and she heard my
dad call out her name. And she answered, "Oh you're home already?" But
there was no answer. She walked to their bedroom and the garage but couldn't
find him. She then noticed his car was not there, so she just left her
lunch at the counter and went back to work.</b>
<br><b>4.&nbsp; Another time---a friend of my brother's--was at the kitchen
counter and saw a tall shadowy figure of a man walk down the hall, but
he couldn't see his head. We have wooden bars in the part of the hall where
he saw it walk through. He and my brother stayed up in the den with a broom
until my oldest brother came home.</b>
<br><b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; One bad experience I had while living in the back
room my father built, was when I was in bed lying on my side. Then I couldnt
move. I felt fingers press against my shoulder to make me lie on my back.
I felt the covers go down as if someone were pulling them, but I couldnt
feel an actual tug or anything. Everytime those fingers pressed against
my shoulder, it felt numbing. That's the only word I can think to describe
it. I couldn't speak. I tried to scream. The fingers kept pressing and
pressing against my shoulder but I could not turn on my back. Then when
it was finally over, when everything stopped, I was so exhausted I immediately
fell asleep.</b>
<br><b>6.&nbsp; Another bad night, I was lying on my stomach trying to
go to sleep. I had a pack of paper on my dresser. I heard paper being pulled
out and crumpled and fallen to the floor. Just one after another. By this
time, I just waited. I just waited for it to be over. And then I heard
my older sister's voice and my younger sister's voice talking about me.
As if they were standing right behind me, crumpling the paper, but they
weren't. The voices said, "Just look at her. She's just lying there." They
sounded really spiteful. When it finally stopped, I still was scared so
I didnt even move throughout the whole thing, just wanted it to be over.
When I woke up the next morning, the paper was fine.</b>

a freshmen</b>
<br><b>(15 yrs) at Thompson Valley High School in Loveland Colorado: and
when i was</b>

(basketball</b>

<br><b>Proof to Non-Believers</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: korpsey@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I became a firm believer of paranormal activity
approximately 2 months</b>
<br><b>ago while sitting with my girlfriend on her bed. We were just watching
TV</b>
<br><b>and she said something along the lines of: "he's here". Puzzled,
I asked</b>
<br><b>her: "who's here?" and she replied that the ghost haunting her house
was in</b>
<br><b>her room as we were speaking. Skeptic, I raised my voice and challenged
this</b>
<br><b>ghost: "if you're here, give me a sign". Almost instantly after
I had</b>
<br><b>spoken, the TV went on and off several times. Thinking that my girlfriend</b>
<br><b>may have been playing a prank on me, I seeked out the remote control
which</b>
<br><b>was laying on the bed a few feet away from both of us, closer to
me, and</b>
<br><b>that there was no way she was the one messing around. That left
no other</b>
<br><b>suspects since we were both alone in the house at the time. From
that moment</b>
<br><b>on, I truly believed in ghosts, although I always had the impression
they</b>
<br><b>existed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My newfound beliefs were confirmed once
again just over a month later</b>
<br><b>when I went over to my girlfriend's house to spend some quality
time with</b>
<br><b>her. This time, the hauntings were more terrifying... It started
when I</b>
<br><b>closed the light and sat down on the bed beside my girlfriend. We
hadn't had</b>
<br><b>any time alone together in a few days and were about to get intimate.</b>
<br><b>Seemingly on cue, her stereo went on and a CD started playing. Right
away,</b>
<br><b>we turned on the light and looked for the remote to her stereo which
I found</b>
<br><b>a few minutes later trapped between her wall and her bed. One of
us must</b>
<br><b>have knocked it into the little crease. After finding the remote,
I</b>
<br><b>simulated turning on the stereo with it from where we found it and
realized</b>
<br><b>it wasn't possible. Then numerous little occurances took place:
the side of</b>
<br><b>her window, which wasn't covered by a drape starting fogging up.
Not being</b>
<br><b>much of a ghost expert, this did not affect me much. What did frighten
me a</b>
<br><b>little was that her drape was moving as if the wind was blowing
on it a bit,</b>
<br><b>but I put my hand over the vent underneath the drape and there was
no air</b>
<br><b>circulation at all and the window was sealed shut. In between "sightings"</b>
<br><b>the house pets would go crazy or make odd noises. I had seen her
cat running</b>
<br><b>around in the basement as if it were chasing something some months</b>
<br><b>beforehand. This was all relevant after I heard that animals have
a higher</b>
<br><b>sense which allows them to feel supernatural presences. Many other</b>
<br><b>unexplainable events occured that night... My girlfriend and I walked
into</b>
<br><b>her living room to find her sister standing outside with the door
open. She</b>
<br><b>explained to us that she was afraid to close the door fearing the
ghost</b>
<br><b>would lock us inside, something that has happened to them before.
After</b>
<br><b>convincing her to close the door, we heard a roaring of a crowd
which was</b>
<br><b>the stereo coming on again; playing the same track it did just minutes</b>
<br><b>before. My girlfriend turned off her stereo again and we headed
back down</b>
<br><b>the hall. Suddenly, my girlfriend's sister noticed that the smoke
detector</b>
<br><b>had been opened and someone, or something had removed the battery.
This is</b>
<br><b>where I started realizing that things were just gonna get worse.
All I could</b>
<br><b>think of was that a fire would break out any second, as if the ghost
was</b>
<br><b>trying to kill us. My girlfriend replaced the battery in the smoke
detector</b>
<br><b>and was terrified as her sister walked by, claiming that she had
just seen</b>
<br><b>the reflection of a huge male shadow with it's hands raised in the
air as if</b>
<br><b>he were ready to strangle her sibling. I did not see this, but believed
it,</b>
<br><b>feeling a presence off and on in the form of an overwelming chill.
Pacing</b>
<br><b>around alot, the chills would always be at different places in the
house,</b>
<br><b>giving me the impression that I was being stalked and/or watched
from across</b>
<br><b>rooms... We seemed to finally succeed in repelling this spirit (temporarily)</b>
<br><b>after my girlfriend read a passage from some sort of witchery book
and</b>
<br><b>burned some type of inscent. At this time, the father of the house
returned</b>
<br><b>home and I mentioned to him that the house may be haunted, but he
is a</b>
<br><b>non-believer. It is very frustrating to convince him that the house
is</b>
<br><b>haunted, especially considering that he is never, or hardly present
when</b>
<br><b>strange things like that happen. Later that night, not too long
before I had</b>
<br><b>to leave my girlfriend's haunted domain, I felt as if some outside
force was</b>
<br><b>trying to crush my head, neck and shoulders... it isn't hard to
believe that</b>
<br><b>the ghost was responsible for this since my girlfriend has told
me that she</b>
<br><b>has felt cold caresses on her body while sleeping or showering.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the history of the house itself...
the son of the couple who</b>
<br><b>lived there previously had committed suicide in the basement bathroom.
That</b>
<br><b>same basement is always cold, but not just cold; chilling cold.
So cold that</b>
<br><b>it's usually warmer outside at night than inside the house (except
for</b>
<br><b>winter nights). Also, my girlfriend's mom has died in that same
house;</b>
<br><b>leading her to believe that there is more than one ghost in her
house</b>
<br><b>(possibly more than 2): a prankster, an evil presence (or poltergeist)
and</b>
<br><b>the loving spirit of her mom. These events fascinate me, but also
scare me a</b>
<br><b>little. Most of all, I am worried for my girlfriend's safety and
do hope</b>
<br><b>that there is a good spirit in her home protecting her from the
evil ones...</b>

<br><b>The Civil War Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By Laura Borsello</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am completely that I saw a ghost at least once in my lifetime.
I was nine</b>
<br><b>years old (Now I am fifteen) and I was sleeping. It was early in
the morning</b>
<br><b>and I woke up because I heard somebody fumbling through my drawers.
I assumed</b>
<br><b>it was my mother and opened my eyes. As soon as I opened my eyes
I saw a dark</b>
<br><b>figure beside my bed about two feet away from me. First I saw it's
boots,</b>
<br><b>then it's uniform, then a beard and a long rifle he was holding.
It's eyes</b>
<br><b>were grave and sad and it was looking down at me. This lasted only
for a few</b>
<br><b>seconds but I am positive I wasn't imagining it. Then he disappeared
so</b>
<br><b>quickly I can't explain it. He looked very much like a ghost from
the Civil</b>
<br><b>War in a uniform. He looked like he was for the North. I don't know
why he</b>
<br><b>would be in my room or even in my house. Afterall, my house is only
about</b>
<br><b>thirty years old and nobody ever died in it and I don't live in
a creepy</b>
<br><b>town. Maybe, I will check up on it and see the history of where
I live during</b>
<br><b>the Civil War Era. He seemed to have been looking for something
through my</b>
<br><b>stuff but I don't have the slightest clue as to what it was. I get

<br><b>Landlord Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jim@motmplus.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Just wanted to say what an entertaining web site you have. I really</b>
<br><b>enjoy it.</b>
<br><b>I believe some time ago I might have sent you my story regarding
my</b>
<br><b>landlord, who passed away on the front lawn of my apartment some
time</b>
<br><b>ago. (mid 1980's) and the "feeling" I had in my apartment that he
was</b>
<br><b>there. It was so strong that I found myself stepping out of the
way of</b>
<br><b>"him" and audibly saying "excuse me", only to realize a few seconds</b>
<br><b>later that there was certainly nobody in the room but me.</b>
<br><b>I had another experience which I just now recalled. Again, some
time ago</b>
<br><b>I rented a house in the northwest Chicago suburb of Bloomingdale,
Il.</b>
<br><b>The place was dumpy. Always cold, always stupid little accidents</b>
<br><b>happening and a very uncomfortable place to live no matter how hard
you</b>
<br><b>tried to make it livable. The location of the house was zoned</b>
<br><b>commercial, and it was slated to be torn down.</b>
<br><b>Well, finally I moved. Months passed. For whatever reason, I still
had</b>
<br><b>keys to the house, and for some reason decided to go back into the</b>
<br><b>house. I guess I was just "there" at the time, and thought I'd pop
back</b>
<br><b>in. I was with a friend at the time too. As a matter of fact, we
were in</b>
<br><b>her car when we were just "passing by" the house. We entered, it
was of</b>
<br><b>course, pitch black except for scattered light from some street
lights,</b>
<br><b>and cold as heck in there. We were there no more than maybe 2 minutes</b>
<br><b>when we heard, very distictly, footsteps coming up from the basement.</b>
<br><b>Very heavy and slowly. All I remember was myself and my friend looking</b>
<br><b>at each other in jaw dropping shock for a moment, turning and running</b>
<br><b>out the front door, leaving the front door of the house wide open.
We</b>
<br><b>hopped in her car and got the heck outta there fast. "Did you hear</b>
<br><b>that?" She asked me. "Yeah, of course I did!" "Ghosts!" she said.
I</b>
<br><b>wanted to come off as my normal, rational logical person to her
and</b>
<br><b>explain it away as maybe an animal or something that was housing
itself</b>
<br><b>there. Maybe it got in the basement window? But, it was most definately</b>
<br><b>NOT the scurrying footsteps of a racoon or other animal. It was
clearly</b>
<br><b>the sounds of heavy, shoed feet pounding on the stairs. Weird. I
never</b>
<br><b>went back into that dump.</b>

<br><b>Strange Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: fido_90_ca@yahoo.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>About two years ago I had a very strange and unnerving</b>
<br><b>experience. My Grandfather had passed away about two</b>
<br><b>days before I experienced things I have trouble</b>
<br><b>explaining let alone believing! First thing that</b>
<br><b>happened I was at my Grandmother's house and it was</b>
<br><b>around 12 o'clock midnight, I went upstairs to the</b>
<br><b>bathroom and noticed a toy horse sitting in the basket</b>
<br><b>that was full of face cloths! I tried to think of a</b>
<br><b>logical explanation for this occurance, I did remember</b>
<br><b>not seeing it there previously. I then went into the</b>
<br><b>spare bedroom to retire for the rest of the night. I</b>
<br><b>was suddenly overcome by a feeling that someone was</b>
<br><b>behind me "watching" me! I turned around immediately</b>
<br><b>feeling started at the same time. The next evening</b>
<br><b>things grew even more bizarre, my Mom was freaking out</b>
<br><b>that the light in the next room went on all by itself</b>
<br><b>and she was worried that someone had broken into the</b>
<br><b>house. There was no one at all, I started to wonder</b>
<br><b>what was really going on. I went into the same</b>
<br><b>bathroom to get ready for bed, the next thing that</b>
<br><b>happened I'll never forget for as long as I live. I</b>
<br><b>heard and saw the door knob turn slowly, I didn't</b>
<br><b>hesitate to run and open it. Once I turned the knob to</b>
<br><b>open the door a force so strong had shoved me back to</b>
<br><b>a point where I nearly fell backwards to the floor!!!</b>
<br><b>I yelled out "Whoa!!", I was so shaken up yet not</b>
<br><b>really that terrified of what just happened to me. I</b>
<br><b>saw no one at the same moment this happened, I do</b>
<br><b>recall the force like that of a powerful wind, or cold</b>
<br><b>air, energy, whatever you may call it. My Dad said he</b>
<br><b>had seen a powerful light enter his room just when he</b>
<br><b>had closed his eyes. I recall seeing some kind of ray</b>
<br><b>of light streak by my window, I no it was not</b>
<br><b>lightning by the way it moved. This is my story please</b>
<br><b>put this on your website Shadowlands, I would</b>
<br><b>appreciate it very much. I want others to know what I</b>
<br><b>experienced, I want to believe that I am not alone,</b>

<br><b>My Grandmother...</b><b></b>
<p><b>lisarose@gateway.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This past November I lost my grandmother (Dad's mom) to liver cancer.
She</b>
<br><b>was a dear woman who grew up going to Spiritualist churches, therefore,</b>
<br><b>having a strong belief in life after death and the supernatural.</b>
<br><b>My mother and I live near Dallas,Texas, but we are originally from
Warren,</b>
<br><b>Ohio, which is where the rest of the relatives live. We were told
just</b>
<br><b>before last Thanksgiving that my grandmother wasn't doing very well,
so I</b>
<br><b>arranged to take that week off of work and we left for Ohio on Sunday</b>
<br><b>morning.</b>
<br><b>On Monday morning, we were getting closer to our destination and
there was a</b>
<br><b>very strange smell in the car. It was like rubbing alchohol.&nbsp;
I didn't say</b>
<br><b>anything for awhile, but after some time I commented to my mother
that there</b>
<br><b>must be some kind of chemical factory or something in the area.
Very shortly</b>
<br><b>after my comment, the smell dissipated.</b>
<br><b>We arrived in Warren later that Monday morning, and upon pulling
into the</b>
<br><b>drive of my grandma's house we noticed many cars. I looked at my
mother and</b>
<br><b>told her that this didnt look very good. When we entered the house
we were</b>
<br><b>greeted by my uncle who informed us that my grandmother had passed
away</b>
<br><b>early that morning.</b>
<br><b>The week went on while arrangements were made, and finally, the
day after</b>
<br><b>Thanksgiving, we had the funeral. Afterwards, many friends and relatives</b>
<br><b>were gathered at my grandmother's home. I walked into the dining
room to get</b>
<br><b>something and was overwhelmed by the same smell that my mother and
I had</b>
<br><b>smelled in the car on the way up.</b>
<br><b>Later, I told my mom about it. This was not possibly anything that
was in</b>
<br><b>the room that could have made that smell (or in my car earlier for
that</b>
<br><b>matter).</b>
<br><b>I truly believe that when we smelled this on the way up in the car
that it</b>
<br><b>was grandma in the car with us. I think she was indeed with me later
in the</b>
<br><b>dining room as well.</b>
<br><b>I found out that they'd been giving my grandmother morphne for her
pain</b>
<br><b>during the last few days she was with us. I also found out that
morphine</b>
<br><b>smells much like...you guessed it....rubbing alchohol.</b>
<br><b>Another note to this story.....my grandfather has been gone for
several</b>
<br><b>years. For a few nights before my grandmother died, the TV in the
living</b>
<br><b>room began to come on by itself. Also, the water in the bathrrom
tub would</b>
<br><b>come on full-blast while no one was in there. Was this grandad telling
them</b>
<br><b>he was there to help grandma back???</b>
<br><b>That's what I believe.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Someone Was Down there.....</b><b></b>
<p><b>By Laura Borsello</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All my life I have sensed paranormal encounters
that have spooked me. One</b>
<br><b>of these encounters took place about two years ago. I was thirteen
years old</b>
<br><b>(Now I am fifteen). It was about 11 o'clock at night. My brother
and mother</b>
<br><b>were all ready sound asleep. My dad was away on a trip. I went into
the</b>
<br><b>bathroom to brush my teeth. I shut the door. Now let me explain:
the sink in</b>
<br><b>the bathroom upstairs is right next to the door. In the middle of
brushing I</b>
<br><b>heard somebody knock lightly on the door. Trust me, it was not the
way a</b>
<br><b>person would knock if they wanted to come in. It was eerie like
letting you</b>
<br><b>know I'm around type of knock. I started to shudder in fear. Slowly
I opened</b>
<br><b>the door and saw from downstairs that the dining room light was
on. I KNEW I</b>
<br><b>had turned all the lights off. I was terrified. My mom's room was
right next</b>
<br><b>door to the bathroom. I woke her up and told her somebody must be
in the</b>
<br><b>house. Not to sound, like a morone I said a robber instead of a
ghost which</b>
<br><b>is what I speculate it to be. She didn't believe me and told me
to go to</b>
<br><b>sleep. I shut her door relunctantly and lingered by the bathroom
door. For</b>
<br><b>some reason I am always afraid to cross the long hallway to my room
alone at</b>
<br><b>night. I feel like somebody's watching me and trying to get me.
I was blown</b>
<br><b>out of my mind when I heard loud footsteps from the downstairs hallway.
The</b>
<br><b>blood began to drain from my head and I started to sweat all over.
Fear was</b>
<br><b>circulating all over me to such a great extent that I couldn't move.
The loud</b>
<br><b>footsteps continued they sounded like boots. I knew the person down
there was</b>
<br><b>evil! I could feel the evil presence in my house. It took me a long
time to</b>
<br><b>muster up the courage to race down the corridor, shut off the light,
and</b>
<br><b>huddle under the covers in my bed. Finally I did so. I still heard
the heavy</b>
<br><b>steps resounding downstairs. I stayed perfectly calm (almost perfectly)
and</b>
<br><b>prayed to myself until I fell asleep. The strange thing is that
when I woke</b>
<br><b>up the next morning there was no evidence that a person had broken
into my</b>
<br><b>house and nothing was stolen. I don't who was down there but someone
was and</b>
<br><b>I think they were looking for someone maybe me! Luckily, I never
experianced</b>
<br><b>this again. It is a good thing I was composed enough that I didn't
scream</b>
<br><b>because I think, what-ever it was it was that was looking for me
would have</b>
<br><b>found me if I yelled or it saw me. It remains a mystery.</b><b></b>

<br><b>October 1997</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Zozama1321@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>On October 30th 1997 my best friend Rob slept over my house. The
House itself</b>
<br><b>was farily nice, 5 bedrooms, nice first floor and a cool loft (no
basement).</b>
<br><b>The Loft was where my friends and I played games (I was 10 at the
time) and</b>
<br><b>made forts out of bed sheets. So on the 30th (The day before our
School's</b>
<br><b>Secretary's funeral who died the previous week) My parents go out
to Maryland</b>
<br><b>to clean a house which they had just sold, my brother was at a friends
and</b>
<br><b>Rob and I were alone in the house. So after watching alot of movies
we went</b>
<br><b>up to the loft to go to sleep. At around 1:00 I went down to the
first floor</b>
<br><b>to get a glass of water (and some snacks) leaving Rob by himself.
As he</b>
<br><b>explains it we was being tapped lightly on the shoulder and his
first</b>
<br><b>reaction was to say " Stop it Jerk I'm trying to sleep" it repeated
about 10</b>
<br><b>more times until he finally looked over and saw nothing. So he brushed
it off</b>
<br><b>and went back to sleep while I was downstairs (now watching a movie
with the</b>
<br><b>snacks I picked out). He started to hear a voice saying something
like "Get</b>
<br><b>out" or "Get up" and got up and looked around only to find me walking
up the</b>
<br><b>stairs. He told me what had happened and I was not suprised. At
the Time I</b>
<br><b>first moved into the house I had similar occurences in my Room.
Later that</b>
<br><b>year my family moved from the house and all is</b>
<br><b>well.....................hopefully it will stay like this.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Someone Else in the House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kandygurl182@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Since i emailed you, i remembered another story. Well, there is some
one else in the house. It's a little girl. I saw her in the basement a
couple times. She always motions for me to follow her and then she disapears.
She looks so real though. You can even see the expression on her face.
She looks worried. No one else, that i know of(they might not be telling),
was had an experience in that house. My grandmother noticed it, but she
told me to ignore it. She died 2 years ago.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Haunted Santa Ana</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Bjbastrup@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have always been plagued by some spirits. It seems as though they
are</b>
<br><b>attracted to me. I used to wake up as a child with my bed shaking
(from the</b>
<br><b>center out) and would refuse to open my eyes.</b>
<br><b>I have lived in this house almost 20 years. When my husband's father
died, he</b>
<br><b>came to&nbsp; me one night. My bed was rocking and I woke up gripping
the sides of</b>
<br><b>it thinking as loudly as possible "go away, go away", then I realized
it was</b>
<br><b>probably him. We had just buried him about 2 weeks before. As soon
as I</b>
<br><b>thought "it's Nate, what do you want?" the bed stopped shaking and
I heard</b>
<br><b>his voice as clear as a bell say "take care of him". I refused to
open my</b>
<br><b>eyes. I was then totally awake and told myself "it was just a dream"
and at</b>
<br><b>that moment, something "thunked" my pillow really hard right next
to my head.</b>
<br><b>The next year, I was sleeping on the couch one night and woke to
see both his</b>
<br><b>parents in the next room looking at my new computer, just in a flash
of a</b>
<br><b>second's consciousness.</b>
<br><b>The most amazing thing happened to me a year ago. I was writing
in a journal</b>
<br><b>every morning about 6:00, and I stood up from my desk to go sit
in a chair</b>
<br><b>and say my prayers, as I did, I saw a man standing in the doorway.
I clearly</b>
<br><b>saw his midsection and clothing, (white toga or robe) and his right
hand in</b>
<br><b>front of him. That was at my eye level. As I turned, it disappeared.
I was</b>
<br><b>then surrounded with freezing air. I said "you have to leave me
alone" out</b>
<br><b>loud, and walked out of the room. Since then I have done my writing
in the</b>
<br><b>bathroom with a heater on &amp; the door closed.</b>
<br><b>I do wish it would stop. I know something was in the room with me
when I was</b>
<br><b>drawing at my art board two nights ago. Something poked me in the
side. Two</b>
<br><b>weeks ago, something pushed one of my feet really hard while I was
laying on</b>
<br><b>the couch.</b>
<br><b>Yikes! This seems to not want to leave, it only wants to play with
me and not</b>
<br><b>hurt me, but it bothers me.</b>
<br><b>I own a house in Joshua Tree for the weekends. I took some antiques
off of</b>
<br><b>the property to use in our garden here and took a photograph of
the garden.</b>
<br><b>There is&nbsp; a vortex going right down to a wheelbarrow that I
had removed a</b>
<br><b>neat old bottle capper from. (This whole place is covered with funky
old</b>
<br><b>desert antiques). I will scan and send you the picture when I bring
it home</b>
<br><b>from work.</b>
<br><b>Other things have happened to me, I will tell you tomorrow. I have
other</b>
<br><b>freaky pictures as well. Seems I am a medium of some sort...</b>

<br><b>Fort Houston</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Aabel4@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm just curious, has anybody been to Fort
Sam Houston?&nbsp; I think</b>
<br><b>that's the name.&nbsp; It's in San Antonio, Tx.&nbsp; I'm curious
because my husband</b>
<br><b>(who is a reservist, prior active duty) stayed at a hotel across
from the old</b>
<br><b>hospital.&nbsp; He kept saying (on the phone) that this place was
haunted.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>told me about 1 week into his 2 week duty that strange things were
happening</b>
<br><b>in the hotel.&nbsp; I laughed at him.&nbsp; He told me that the
room he was staying in</b>
<br><b>looked like something out of the 1950's and that it had a very cold
spot in</b>
<br><b>his closet.&nbsp; He also told me that he woke to the sound of something
falling</b>
<br><b>on the floor.&nbsp; When he woke up, the trash bags that were in
the closet, were</b>
<br><b>about 5 ft from the closet and the closet door was open.&nbsp; He
stated that</b>
<br><b>maybe he was seeing things, but he talked to some other</b>
<br><b>servicemen/servicewomen who had strange occurances too.&nbsp; These
soldiers said</b>
<br><b>that they heard voices and that the elevator would go up and down
several</b>
<br><b>floors until it finally stopped on the floor they wanted.&nbsp;
My husband also</b>
<br><b>stated that the other soldiers kept telling him to look at the at
the old</b>
<br><b>hospital across from them.. He said that at night several lights
would go on</b>
<br><b>(on different floors) and the windows would open.&nbsp; No need
to say that he</b>
<br><b>didn't have a very good time in San Antonio.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what to believe of this.&nbsp;
But, we took a "vacation" to</b>
<br><b>San Antonio to see the river walk and he took me onto the base.&nbsp;
He took me</b>
<br><b>to the "hotel" he stayed in and it did look like something out of
WWII!.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>actually "snuck" me in. The walls had this ugly wallpaper that looked
like it</b>
<br><b>had never been changed since WWII.&nbsp; The elevator made this
ugly creeking</b>
<br><b>noise that I thought maybe it would fall. I actually held the rails
hoping it</b>
<br><b>would not break.&nbsp; But the strangest thing is before going into
this hotel I</b>
<br><b>actually looked across to the&nbsp; old "hospital" and it was completely
dark.&nbsp; (I</b>
<br><b>never got to go into the rooms) but when we left,&nbsp; there were
several lights</b>
<br><b>on the 4th floor and the windows were open.&nbsp; My curiosity got
the best of me</b>
<br><b>and I circled (in my car) to the front the of the building.&nbsp;
Even in the dark</b>
<br><b>I could see that the building had been abandoned and that there
could be no</b>
<br><b>way any cleaning people would ever go in there. But the lights were
still on.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;This building has been there since (I think) the 1930's and
it is totally</b>
<br><b>abandoned.&nbsp; I have a hard time believing that no one has ever
mentioned this</b>
<br><b>"hospital" or the "hotel" in the ghost files.&nbsp; I think this
place would be a</b>
<br><b>perfect place to search for such things.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for my husband the "soldier',
"warrior", "the fearless" a Desert</b>
<br><b>Storm Veteran, says he doesn't ever want to back there again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This building is not far from the
main gate.&nbsp; And as far as I see,</b>
<br><b>it's not too far from the main gate.&nbsp; Could this be something
that the</b>
<br><b>military wants to hide?</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I anyone has some more information
that they would like to share about</b>
<br><b>this place.&nbsp; Maybe some of the soldiers who had strange occurrances
in the</b>
<br><b>"hotel" would like to share, I really would like to hear about this.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Warning</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have a true ghost story.&nbsp; Or warning story.</b>
<br><b>When my mother was young, she was raised, with her 6 other brothers
and sisters, by my Grandmother alone.&nbsp; My mother was 9 when her father
passed away, and in the days before child labor laws, she worked in the
Cotton Mill with the rest of her family to make ends meet.&nbsp; So, needless
to say, there wasn't much time for fun.</b>
<br><b>But one day, a neighbor asked my grandmother if he could take my
mother and her siblings to the county fair in his brand new car.&nbsp;
Of course, my mother recalls how excited they all were, and my grandmother
was grateful for the kind gesture.&nbsp; He would pay and everything, he
said.&nbsp; My grandmother gave her children permission to go.</b>
<br><b>The day of the fair came, and my mother and the others all piled
into the neighbor's car. My grandmother stopped them just short of leaving,
saying they would need their sweaters if it got chilly that evening.&nbsp;
She ran inside to get them while the car idled.</b>
<br><b>When my grandmother returned, she was pale and ordered everyone
out of the car.&nbsp; Of course my mother was disappointed, and despite
tears and protests my grandmother would not budge.&nbsp; The children were
not going, and that was that.</b>
<br><b>Years later, when my mother was an adult, my grandmother admitted
why she had not let them go to the fair all those years before...</b>
<br><b>When my grandmother went to the closet to get the sweaters, a ball
of fire rolled across the floor and disappeared into the opposite wall.&nbsp;
She knew it was some sort of warning, she said.&nbsp; From God or her late
husband, she didn't know.</b>
<br><b>A warning about what?&nbsp; That new neighbor's car had bad brakes,
which the neighbor became aware of after he tried to drive to the fair
alone.&nbsp; He had time to jump out (the car rolled down a steep embankment),
but my mother and the other children certainly would have been killed.</b>
<br><b>This is a true story, and it took place in the 1940's in Fayetteville,
TN.&nbsp; The house is still standing, and my mother attends the Cotton
Mill Reunions to this day.</b><b></b>

<br><b>College Campus Ghost!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: beholdthepowerofcheese88@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, my name is Diane. You may remember me from the story about the
ghost in</b>
<br><b>my basement that scared my dog. Well, I have had another experience.
A year</b>
<br><b>or two has passed and I am now eighteen years old and living at
college. I</b>
<br><b>attend Gwynedd-Mercy College, a small private Catholic college in</b>
<br><b>Pennsylvania. Not many have heard of it, but if you're in or around
Philly,</b>
<br><b>tune into Y100 or Q102. Commercials are usually on the air about
my school</b>
<br><b>like every thirty seconds. Anyway, to fully understand the story,
you have</b>
<br><b>to know its surroundings. We are "out in the middle of nowhere."
Yep, woods</b>
<br><b>to the left of you, woods to the right. Which makes the campus beautiful
by</b>
<br><b>the abundance of wild life- namely deer.&nbsp; My dorm building
is at the very</b>
<br><b>end of campus, which is encircled by woods. Anyway, my most recent</b>
<br><b>experience on campus happened sometime last week. My friend Christina
and I</b>
<br><b>were up studying late and decided to go take a walk around the parkinglot</b>
<br><b>for the dorm, which is right out front. This was about 4:30 AM.
We're</b>
<br><b>walking and talking and laughing and all of the sudden, she stops
and just</b>
<br><b>stares into the woods. I asked her what was wrong and she just pointed
to a</b>
<br><b>particular spot. I looked to where she was pointing and saw something
that</b>
<br><b>made my blood run cold. A large figure in a white hood was beckoning
to us,</b>
<br><b>waving his hand for us to come closer. It looked like a Ku-Klux-Klan
member.</b>
<br><b>This figure was way too large to be a person- WAY too large. Out
of</b>
<br><b>curiosity, I took a step or two forward and the figure became more
excited</b>
<br><b>and began waving his hand faster. I wanted to go up to it for some
reason,</b>
<br><b>but Christina gripped my arm with an ice-cold hand and started to
run. She</b>
<br><b>pulled me all the way back inside. Needless to see, we didn't sleep
that</b>
<br><b>night. We told security amd they sent someone old to check. There
was</b>
<br><b>nothing there. No foot prints, nothing. We weren't imagining it
or anything!</b>
<br><b>I swear on all things holy that we did see something that night!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Story Similiar to the Smurls</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: neyda_r@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I got a story for you.&nbsp; I saw this story about 4 years ago.&nbsp;
When i was</b>
<br><b>younger I loved reading about ghost and things like that.&nbsp;
I can tell you</b>
<br><b>that i read about every ghost story book (well in the kid section)
there was</b>
<br><b>at that time in our public library.&nbsp; I as a child was never
afraid of the</b>
<br><b>dark or ghost stories or things like that.&nbsp; But as I grew older
I would get</b>
<br><b>scared..why I guess cause I understood that it could happen to anyone.:</b>
<br><b>But anyway back to the story.&nbsp; This is a story I saw on TELEMUNDO
(tv</b>
<br><b>spanish station)It is about a family who lived in Mexico City. The
station</b>
<br><b>did a small movie about it.&nbsp; The story started out a about
eight family</b>
<br><b>members living in the same household.&nbsp; One lady was wondering
what happend</b>
<br><b>to her boyfriend she just didn't hear about him.&nbsp; She was telling
her</b>
<br><b>brothers (or brother in-law) that she would like to hear some news
about</b>
<br><b>him.&nbsp; Then he suggested she go see a "witch" or a person that
reads the</b>
<br><b>cards. so he told her he had heard about some witch. and she decided
that</b>
<br><b>she'd go. The next day they wnet to go see her. That day they spoke
to her</b>
<br><b>she gave them a ouija board so that they can try and contact the
person they</b>
<br><b>were looking for that day on there way home they saw a Raven follow
them the</b>
<br><b>way home.&nbsp; That night she had told them to bless the house
with a plant she</b>
<br><b>gave them s one of the ladies was doing that one of them men that
live there</b>
<br><b>took the plant away from her and started playing around making jokes
of it</b>
<br><b>while he was doing that he flet a something slash him on the back
..the</b>
<br><b>strange thing was that there was no one behingd him. The next day
they went</b>
<br><b>back to go see her( or it was the day before i am not sure how many
times</b>
<br><b>they went and saw her) she insulted them calling them names and
things like</b>
<br><b>that when they got up to leave she told them that going to go see
her was</b>
<br><b>the THE BIGGEST MISTAKE THEY HAD DONE.. when they went home they
started</b>
<br><b>playing with the board.&nbsp; Like always there a prankster in the
family.&nbsp; So</b>
<br><b>the same one that was joking about the plant started acting like
he was his</b>
<br><b>sisters boyfriendthey asked him to stop and quit playing around...when
all</b>
<br><b>of a sudden his eyes rolled back in his head he had gotten possed
for about</b>
<br><b>a few moments. From that moment on a lot of weird things started</b>
<br><b>happening....books and items would start flying around.&nbsp; This
case was</b>
<br><b>similiar to the SMIRLS.&nbsp; they had decided to leave the house
when they got</b>
<br><b>to the house they were going to something opened the gate they saw
the Death</b>
<br><b>who know that imagine they show with the brown hood on.&nbsp; So
they knew that</b>
<br><b>they were not going to be left alone. So they decided to go back
home. Alot</b>
<br><b>of things happened to them and they were wondering why?&nbsp; So
then they</b>
<br><b>decided to go back to that witch.&nbsp; But as it turns out they
found nobody</b>
<br><b>then someone had confirm to them that, that witch had died years
ago.&nbsp; Later</b>
<br><b>that night they were all asleep in one room one of the ladys woke
up to go</b>
<br><b>get a bottle for the baby.&nbsp; When she looked up she saw the
image of the</b>
<br><b>death she ran to the room and it followed her to the room. she jump
on th</b>
<br><b>bed on top of everyone and they all woke up and the image told all
of them</b>
<br><b>that one by one they were all going to die.&nbsp; Till this day
only about 2</b>
<br><b>remane of the 8 (at least thats what i remeber) They have been dying
one by</b>
<br><b>one every 20yrs just like it had told them.&nbsp; This story and
not only the</b>
<br><b>story but the little documentationt the show made really freaked
me out.&nbsp; A</b>
<br><b>lot of people that saw it were got scared its a true story.&nbsp;
This is not how</b>
<br><b>it went exactly but its close if you want to check it.&nbsp; It
aired on a show</b>
<br><b>called Occurio Asi (this is how it occured) on the spanish station
of</b>
<br><b>Telemundo....maybe you can get more information about this story
if i am not</b>
<br><b>mistaking the last name of the family was Rodriguez...........well

<br><b>It Still Happens</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Jami_Lee_03@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the first time i have ever submitted
anything thats ever happen to me over my childhood years. My mom brought
this site to my attention, and she thought it might be good to share some
of my stories. I always had a sensitivity to spirits, some good and some
bad, well mostly not good. Anyways,I guess having this gift started when
i was one. It was after my father had past away. My mother told me that
one day while she was feeding me I looked up from my cereal and pointed
to something and said "Daddy,Daddy". She looked to see nothing there, and
turned back to see me smiling and still pointing. After she looked again
and then back at me i stoped and went back to doing my thing. That i would
have to say was the only good encounter i have had.</b>
<br><b>Now on to the creepy stuff. I was 11 when i first started to hear
my name being called. This was no ordinary persons voice, it was something
more evil and unsetteling. I was always the last to fall asleep in my family,
and I remember trying to sleep but I had this feeling something was there.
No sooner had i thought this, thats when&nbsp; it started to say my name.
The thing was facing me, I looked but i couldn't see anything, I pulled
the covers over my face and pretended it was my imagination. Still it kept
saying my name. I turned over to escape what I was hearing, I think I pissed
it off because the evil presence voice started to get louder and more hateful.
I jumped up screaming and crying trying to get someones attention, but
everyone was sound asleep. So I ran into my mothers room crying saying
" The voice wont go away". That night I slelpt in her room and after that
I heard nothing no more,.....well only for awhile. Later on it got worse,
I couldn't shake the feeling someone was always watching when I would walk
down the stairs or through the hallway. At night when I would be sleeping
something would pinch my butt, This happened every night. And sometimes
I would hear my name&nbsp; called out, but it was never evil, it was more
like a faint whisper. We soon moved away. But I still hear and sometimes
feel someone or something call me or I'll feel something sit on my bed
and lean on me. Nothing to dramatic. I just sorta laugh it off now that
im older. But if anything dramatic should pop up I'll write some more.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Prissy</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:Anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In April 1996, while apartment hunting, I discovered a wonderful
little complex nestled near a little marina and cove in a quiet area of
town.&nbsp; The apartments weren't new -- in fact, at the time I discovered
them they were approaching 25 years old.&nbsp; It was your typical townhouse
style -- living, dining and kitchen, two bedrooms up, a couple of baths.&nbsp;
But I liked the area, especially the view of the sail boats in the marina.</b>
<br><b>When the complex manager showed me the apartment I would be moving
into, she was still living there.&nbsp; As we toured the place, she explained
that she was in the process of moving her family to the apartment located
just across from her current one -- it had been occupied by her sister,
the former manager, who had died of lung cancer about a month before.&nbsp;
The living sister had taken over the dead sister's duties as manager of
the complex and was now moving into the larger apartment the dead sister
once occupied.</b>
<br><b>Pleased with the apartment and the surroundings, I placed a deposit
and planned to move in within a month.</b>
<br><b>By the time I moved into the freshly painted and repaired apartment,
the manager and her family were already settled in her sister's former
digs.&nbsp; As I got to know the manager as my neighbor, I learned that
there were many things -- furnishings for instance -- that she had retained
from her dead sister.&nbsp; One particular thing, however, was her dead
sister's cat, Prissy.</b>
<br><b>This cat was estimated by the manager to be approximately 16 years
old.&nbsp; She was a fluffy looking Calico, but when you went to pick her
up you would experience the "empty milk carton syndrome" because she was
skinny as a rail underneath all that fluffy mottled hair.&nbsp; The cat
was friendly, and had a peculiar yowl -- it sounded like an old cat's yowl,
just as elderly people have distinct voices.&nbsp; Prissy was patient and
playful with my child and the other children nearby, but you could tell
she was on the last of her nine lives.</b>
<br><b>One thing Prissy didn't like, however, was returning to the apartment
where her previous owner had died.&nbsp; No matter how hard they tried
to keep Prissy in the "new" apartment, she would always, oddly enough,
return to what was now my apartment.&nbsp; She would show up at the door,
yowling pitifully, and I would let her in.&nbsp; Then she would stake her
spot in front of my microwave and sleep for hours on end, until the manager
and her children were looking for her.</b>
<br><b>This went on for some weeks, until one day the manager shared with
me that Prissy had not been well and that the vet didn't give her much
longer to live.&nbsp; This struck me as sad, as I had become used to the
old cat by then.&nbsp; Still, she would not be kept out of my apartment.&nbsp;
But one of the aspects of her illness was incontinence and so the idea
of having the cat become sick while in my apartment did not appeal to me;
besides this, I had also recently adopted a cat of my own and was concerned
that maybe he might become ill, too.&nbsp; So I tried to discourage Prissy
from coming inside and would gently take her over to her own apartment
and place her inside the front door.&nbsp; Still, the cat would come to
my door and yowl for entry.</b>
<br><b>Finally there came a day when she just wouldn't take "no" for an
answer.&nbsp; Being summer, we often had our doors open allowing the breeze
to come through the screen door.&nbsp; Well, that day, Prissy came through
the screen door, ran upstairs and hid under my bed.&nbsp; With a lot of
coaxing I was able to get her out and return her directly to the manager's
children.&nbsp; They placed her inside their apartment and that was the
last I saw of Prissy -- alive.</b>
<br><b>The next morning I learned the sad news that Prissy had died during
the night, under one of the children's beds upstairs.&nbsp; I remember
thinking how odd it was that she had clawed her way into my apartment the
previous day; perhaps she had wanted to "come home" to die?</b>
<br><b>A couple of weeks passed; life went on.&nbsp; But soon I began to
notice strange things in my apartment.&nbsp; Not frightening, of course,
but odd.&nbsp; For instance, my own cat, Madison, could often be seen to
be chasing something around, something only he could see.&nbsp; There were
times, too, when he would be doing his usual "casual cat stroll" around
the corner of a doorway or room and suddenly puff up and hiss as if he
had been surprised by something, again, only he could see.&nbsp; I would
hear this go on at night, as well, if Madison got up to go to his box or
feed bowl, it seemed he was frequently "running into" an unseen friend.</b>
<br><b>I began to wonder whether or not Prissy had returned when one night
it was confirmed without a doubt.&nbsp; I had just settled into bed and
had turned off the bedside lamp.&nbsp; I was laying there, getting comfortable;
at this time each night it was not unusual for Madison to jump up on the
bed with me, so when I felt the familiar jump and padding of little feet
I thought nothing of it.&nbsp; I often talk to Madison (still do) in baby
talk and did so this night, reaching out to his usual spot to pet him.&nbsp;
But he wasn't there.</b>
<br><b>My hand passed through a slightly chilly area at the foot of my
bed.&nbsp; I passed my hand through again to be sure of what I had just
felt.&nbsp; I then saw, out the corner of my eye, my own cat approaching
from the adjacent room.&nbsp; As I turned to put the light back on, I felt
something jump from my bed and heard the usual "hiss" from Madison, as
when he is startled.&nbsp; In the lamplight, I saw nothing but my own cat.</b>
<br><b>Prissy was in the house.</b>
<br><b>As I said, this was not frightening. In fact, it became kind of
comforting to know that the old cat had bonded so quickly with me and that
she was pleased to stay in her old apartment with it's new tenant.&nbsp;
It became second nature to me to hear her and see her out the corner of
my eye.&nbsp; It was not so with other people.</b>
<br><b>One night, my then boyfriend, who worked out of state and came into
town at unexpected intervals, had arrived typically late at my apartment
and opted to stay the night.&nbsp; We were both tired out and lay down
in the darkness talking about his trip and work, etc., when suddenly we
both felt the jump and pad, pad, pad of little unseen cat feet.&nbsp; This
night Prissy padded all the way across the bed and jumped down the opposite
side.&nbsp; I will never forget the whisper of my boyfriend's voice as
he said, "Uh, what was THAT?" nor will I forget how he scrambled for the
light when I told him it was Prissy, my ghost cat.</b>
<br><b>It scared him so badly that he couldn't sleep and stayed up the
rest of the night watching movies and info-mercials.</b>
<br><b>As for me, I was content to know that Prissy was still around, checking
everything out.</b>
<br><b>Eventually, Prissy's appearances became less and less and ultimately
were eclipsed by a haunting of a much more malignant and negative nature
which held an entire family in it's grasp -- new neighbors I at this time
had yet to meet.</b>
<br><b>I like to think that Prissy found her way over to the other side
finally, and that she was reunited with her owner.&nbsp; She was such a
sweet old cat, she certainly deserved nothing less.</b>

<br><b>Los Pajaros (The Birds)</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: isolda_@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>No, it's not the famous Hitchcock story but a quite different one</b>
<br><b>My boyfriend of that long ago era 1989 had failed Criminal Law at
school so</b>
<br><b>I decided to help him prepare for the make up test, but our homes
seemed to</b>
<br><b>have many distractions, we decided to pack up our gear and use this
place</b>
<br><b>his family had out of the city limits, more or less 45 mins away.
This place</b>
<br><b>used to be a recreational site in it's younger days, and had a huge
pool, a</b>
<br><b>baby pool and a whirlpool (remember those?) all of them empty, a
petting</b>
<br><b>zoo, all that was left was a goat, it had a huge dinning area, and
all over</b>
<br><b>were&nbsp; fruit trees, and of course lots of display cages where
the used to be</b>
<br><b>all kinds of different birds, hence the name, Los Pajaros. His family
had</b>
<br><b>been leasing it for a couple of years, it's glory days long past,
and only a</b>
<br><b>couple of times had sub let it to&nbsp; near by villages for wedding
receptions</b>
<br><b>and such, they paid for the caretaker, which lived on the premises
with his</b>
<br><b>family. Since there was no use for it's original purpose, his family
(my</b>
<br><b>boyfriend's) had decided to use the whole place to raise all different
kinds</b>
<br><b>of birds (poultry) geese, turkeys, ducks, etc. Back to the story,
we decide</b>
<br><b>to use this place since it was as good as abandoned, and the first
time we</b>
<br><b>went up, we had all the keys to the place except the one that opened
up to</b>
<br><b>the dinning area that led to&nbsp; what had been the office (our
intended place</b>
<br><b>of study) so we sat outside and got bit by bugs and left at dusk.
We never</b>
<br><b>did go back and study, it just left our minds, and in the end he
did pass</b>
<br><b>the test.</b>
<br><b>Well a weekend in July we decide to have a barbecue with some friends
on the</b>
<br><b>premises, and when we went to pick our friends&nbsp; up (brother
and sister) they</b>
<br><b>made up some lame excuse not to go so we went on our own, and we
did have</b>
<br><b>the right keys this time, but it started to rain, we had to cook
the</b>
<br><b>hamburgers in the fireplace and it was just a hassle since the wood
was wet,</b>
<br><b>and every other imaginable thing, we finally ate, and had chocolate
cake for</b>
<br><b>desert, and we were laying on these psychiatric type couches (one
on each)</b>
<br><b>and we hadn't noticed how dark it was getting outside, and I started
hearing</b>
<br><b>a sort of footsteps on the roof, my boyfriend said it was probably
a</b>
<br><b>squirrel or something between the wooden planks, I wasn't convinced,
it kept</b>
<br><b>up for a while, the rain hadn't stopped and all of a sudden we hear
3 LOUD</b>
<br><b>BANGS on the metal entrance door, we freaked out! We opened the
door from</b>
<br><b>the office that led to the dinning area, and it was all embraced
in a sort</b>
<br><b>of mist, you could see it but at the same time it wasn't there.
And I</b>
<br><b>remember an eerie feeling I got when I set foot out of the office,
we</b>
<br><b>checked the premises, and opened the door, we looked for the caretaker
and</b>
<br><b>he was inside his house with all his family, children sleeping,
we decided</b>
<br><b>to leave FAST, we picked up our stuff and practically ran out. We
left and</b>
<br><b>on the way back to the city we spoke about how we had felt, and
my boyfriend</b>
<br><b>confessed that the knocks I had been hearing on the roof could not
have been</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; made by squirrels but he didn't want to scare me then. We
started bringing</b>
<br><b>up theories on what could have banged the door, and the mist, and
the eerie</b>
<br><b>feelings to no avail. We got to my house, and sat in the car for
awhile</b>
<br><b>talking about what had just happened. But it was late, almost 11
pm, my</b>
<br><b>boyfriend, took the car keys from the ignition and opened his door
to get</b>
<br><b>out and I opened mine, and on comes the air conditioner gushing
out air! We</b>
<br><b>just stared at each other and at the keys in his hand! There was
no way that</b>
<br><b>could happen, the car wasn't even running! Needless to say we were
freaked,</b>
<br><b>we never went back to Los Pajaros, and eventually his family stopped
leasing</b>
<br><b>the property. He is married now, but we still keep in touch, I guess
he's my</b>
<br><b>best friend, and when ever we get a chance to talk we still wonder
about</b>
<br><b>what went on that night I'm pretty sure someone needed a lift back
to the</b>
<br><b>city. Who knows?</b>

<p><b>Strange happenings at Gettysburg</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: baarmani@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, I'm 11 years old and I've hade a ghost experience
at Gettysburg</b>
<br><b>PA. A few years ago I went to&nbsp; Gettysburg with my grandparents
. While there</b>
<br><b>I felt a strange sense of somthing. Well in Gen Lee's HQ I had a
really</b>
<br><b>strange experience. I was looking around at the relic's and suddenly
felt</b>
<br><b>like someone was staring at me. I turned around but no one was there.
So I</b>
<br><b>went on about my buisness, looking at the display again, and I had
that same</b>
<br><b>feeling, but a lot stronger;. So I turned around&nbsp; again but
no one was there.</b>
<br><b>Well then I was really shook up, so I ran out of there. The rest
of the day</b>
<br><b>was preety normal, except on the last stop of the tour , picketts
charge,&nbsp; an</b>
<br><b>even stranger thing happened. I had ran ahead of my grandparents
to look at a</b>
<br><b>sign. While I was looking at it, someone taped me on the shoulder.
It wasn't</b>
<br><b>just any tap it was a really hard ,almost, grab. I&nbsp; turned
around, thinking</b>
<br><b>it was my Grandpa, but no one was within twenty feet of me. so the
rest of my</b>
<br><b>trip i was so shook up that I didn;t tell my grandparents. This
is my strange</b>
<br><b>tale, belive it ,or not.</b>

<p><b>Novellus Hauntings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:anoky99@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is my story of a true encounter at a computer</b>
<br><b>company in Silicon Valley. I had hear stories from the</b>
<br><b>grave shift guard that the building was haunted. But</b>
<br><b>being that he was a strange person, i ignored the fact</b>
<br><b>thinking he was just trying to scare me. he would</b>
<br><b>report hearing footsteps walking on the second floor.</b>
<br><b>Why is this unusual? Novellus was a ONE-story</b>
<br><b>building! he reported hearing chairs moving and people</b>
<br><b>walking around.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, MY experiance was one of the most terrifying</b>
<br><b>times of my life. I was a security guard at Novellus</b>
<br><b>and the builing was in shut down due to the</b>
<br><b>Thanksgiving holiday. I was the swing shift guard and</b>
<br><b>had to train my replacement. While the building was</b>
<br><b>empty during the shutdown, Dorothy, the replacement</b>
<br><b>guard i had to train, showed up on time and we began</b>
<br><b>our shift. Everything was cool that day, then nite</b>
<br><b>fall came. The building has large steel double doors</b>
<br><b>that are unlocked with access cards. We had ordered a</b>
<br><b>pizza for our dinner and after we ate, it was about</b>
<br><b>6:30. It was time for another patrol of the building</b>
<br><b>so this time it was her turn to go alone. As she got</b>
<br><b>up to leave, we heard one of the steel doors slam shut</b>
<br><b>somewhere in the building. Thinking someone came in to</b>
<br><b>catch up on work and entered thru another door, we</b>
<br><b>went to check it out. The building runs on motion</b>
<br><b>sensored lights, so all the lights in the building</b>
<br><b>were off. When we went passed the first double door</b>
<br><b>from the lobby to the IT area, all the lights were</b>
<br><b>still off. Again we heard the door slam shut. We</b>
<br><b>hurried over to the sound and the lights came on as we</b>
<br><b>passed the sensors. When we came to the door, it was</b>
<br><b>closed and no sign of anyone. We headed back to the</b>
<br><b>lobby, when the lights began to shut off one after the</b>
<br><b>other heading our way. That was wierd cuz the lights</b>
<br><b>dont shut off one by one, they all shut off together.</b>
<br><b>Back in the lobby, we heard the door again. We finally</b>
<br><b>went to the security office where the card computer</b>
<br><b>was, the computer that reads peoples access cards to</b>
<br><b>let us know who came into the building. The only names</b>
<br><b>on the computer were ours. NO ONE else had entered the</b>
<br><b>building.</b>
<br><b>We had decided to do the patrol together. As we went</b>
<br><b>thru the building, we turned off cubicle lights and</b>
<br><b>closed open doors. When we passed the doors and cubes,</b>
<br><b>the lights were back on and the doors were all open</b>
<br><b>again. Annoyed, we closed them all again. The name</b>
<br><b>plaque for the VP was on the floor so we hung it back</b>
<br><b>up. When we walked by it again, it was back on the</b>
<br><b>floor in the same spot we found it. this is where we</b>
<br><b>started to freak out. Again all the lights were going</b>
<br><b>out one by one, like they were chasing us. Once the</b>
<br><b>last light went out, they all began to come back on in</b>
<br><b>the same flowing motion. we hurried out of that part</b>
<br><b>of the building and went thru the cafeteria. As soon</b>
<br><b>as we were ready to exit the cafeteria, for some</b>
<br><b>reason we both stopped dead in our tracks. I remember</b>
<br><b>feeling a wierd feeling like we were being followed.</b>
<br><b>We both looked at each other and before we could move</b>
<br><b>an inch, we both felt something hit our shoulder and</b>
<br><b>grunt loudly in our ears. With that, we ran out of the</b>
<br><b>building as fast as we could grabbing our stuff. We</b>
<br><b>sat out in my car and faced the building, still</b>
<br><b>watching the lights going on and off even though no</b>
<br><b>one was in the building. We drove around the side and</b>
<br><b>she screamed at me to stop the car. she pointed to one</b>
<br><b>of the windows and u could make out a figure slumped</b>
<br><b>over one of the cubicle desks. i turned the car so my</b>
<br><b>headlights were shining in the window. Clearly we</b>
<br><b>could see a man hunched over the desk. We got out of</b>
<br><b>the car and ran up to the building. Dorothy tripped so</b>
<br><b>i turned to help her up. When we turned back to the</b>
<br><b>building, the figure was gone and the lights were all</b>
<br><b>off.</b>
<br><b>We refused to go back into that building for the rest</b>
<br><b>of the nite and stood out in my car parked AWAY from</b>
<br><b>the building. I was there for a couple months and</b>
<br><b>began to work in the day. I never had another</b>
<br><b>encounter like that again im glad to say.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Experiences with Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: KristinMelton@gateway.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I was a little girl, I have had what I consider
to be experiences</b>
<br><b>with ghosts. My most remembered experience was to do with a little
sheltie</b>
<br><b>dog named Nattie. I lived twenty five miles out in the country with
my sister</b>
<br><b>and my grandparents. She was a gorgeous blonde and white little
dog and</b>
<br><b>became mine and my sisters constant companion.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nattie became like another playmate for both
of us. We often even dressed</b>
<br><b>her up in my grandpas tee shirts and boxer shorts when we played
house</b>
<br><b>together. We could not have wanted for a more faithful friend than
her. She</b>
<br><b>would even wait patiently every day for us at the bus stop when
we would</b>
<br><b>return from our country school. I think she considered us to be
her personal</b>
<br><b>responsibility. We loved her dearly and relished our every moment
with her.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But tragically she was killed one morning by
a speeding neighbors pick up</b>
<br><b>truck on a lonely dirt road. My grandparents buried her on their
water line</b>
<br><b>and marked it with a large white rock. My sister and I were devestated,
but</b>
<br><b>we never quit decorating her grave with flowers.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following spring is when we started
seeing and hearing her. It was</b>
<br><b>almost as if she just wanted to keep an eye on us, even after death.
We were</b>
<br><b>a little spooked at first, but also very excited that she had come
back for</b>
<br><b>us. But since we were only little girls of&nbsp; eight and nine
years old, no one</b>
<br><b>believed us and wrote it off as overactive imaginations.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But my sister and I knew what we had seen and
heard. Sometimes we would</b>
<br><b>see her sitting not far from her grave site and other times we would
see her</b>
<br><b>at the bus stop just as she always did in life. Other times we wouldn't
see</b>
<br><b>her at all, but were stunned by her shrill unmistakeable barking.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These experiences continued right up through
highschool until my</b>
<br><b>grandparents sold their home and moved to town. I think Nattie was
doing in</b>
<br><b>death what was denied her in life-which was being with the two of
us. I have</b>
<br><b>never been back there, but have always wondered if she would be
waiting for</b>
<br><b>me if I did return.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also had another experience of a bizarre nature.
I took up working at a</b>
<br><b>local animal hospital cleaning kennels. I did all of the cleaning
of the many</b>
<br><b>runs, hospital wards, and lobby areas. I was also responsible for
all the</b>
<br><b>feeding of the numerous dogs and cats that boarded there during
the week.</b>
<br><b>During my feeding duty is when I had my eerie experience.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was almost finished feeding the dogs in the
boarding runs and was</b>
<br><b>shocked when their constant barking suddenly ceased. Normally the
noise level</b>
<br><b>in there was so loud that you practically needed ear plugs to spare
your</b>
<br><b>hearing. So when it stopped I was kind of alarmed. I could have
heard a pin</b>
<br><b>drop in there it had become so quiet.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I quickly became aware of a loud persistant
panting noise that</b>
<br><b>sounded like was coming from directly behind me. I whirled around
and was met</b>
<br><b>by the staring brown eyes of a friendly black lab. The dog was wagging
its</b>
<br><b>tail and panting. I also noticed that it wore a red bandana scarf
tied</b>
<br><b>loosely around its neck. I hadn't seen a dog like this anywhere
in boarding,</b>
<br><b>so I quickly went to try to catch it and find out where it had come
from from</b>
<br><b>one of the vets.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the dog bolted away and ran, with nails clicking
along the concrete,</b>
<br><b>up and around the corner of the kennels and out of my view. I fished
in my</b>
<br><b>smock for a dog leash that I always kept for such emergencys and
ran after</b>
<br><b>the dog. By this time all the rest of the dogs in boarding were
again</b>
<br><b>barking.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I rounded the corner and prepared to capture
the lab, I was</b>
<br><b>astonished to discover that it had simply vanished. There was no
other way</b>
<br><b>out and I was certain that he hadn't used the only door available
since it</b>
<br><b>was still firmly closed. I was definately a bit shaken by the experience
the</b>
<br><b>rest of the evening as I finished up my duties.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just as I was getting ready to go home I
noticed on the way out that</b>
<br><b>the door to the contagious ward was slightly ajar. This is the room
where the</b>
<br><b>vets would normally keep animals with a contagious disease so they
don't</b>
<br><b>spread it to healthy animals. I knew that there was no animals in
there then</b>
<br><b>so I was preparing to close the door tightly on my way out.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I had forgotton was that they also did autopsies
in there on the</b>
<br><b>autopsy table located in that room as well. What I saw next through
the crack</b>
<br><b>in the door made my stomach knot and the hair on the back of my
neck stand up</b>
<br><b>with a chill. On the autopsy table lay a dead black lab with a red
bandana</b>
<br><b>tied around his neck. I didn't know how long he had been there so
I quickly</b>
<br><b>located the vet and asked about him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told me he was brought in earlier that morning-a
victim of a</b>
<br><b>poisoning. He died a few hours later, long before my shift at the
hospital</b>
<br><b>even started. His autopsy was scheduled for the next morning. I
didn't dare</b>
<br><b>tell what I had seen for fear that she would think I was crazy or
something.</b>
<br><b>But I was taken a back by the experience none the less. I haven't
told anyone</b>
<br><b>about it-not even my husband for fear of some kind of ridicule.
I doubt I</b>
<br><b>will ever forget that dog -who's name turned out to be Buddy. I
have no idea</b>
<br><b>why I became lucky enough to see him, but feel kind of fortunate
he came to</b>
<br><b>me anyway.</b>

<p><b>By: Realtormommy2@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have two stories to tell both concerning my children. The first
occured 2</b>
<br><b>years ago when my son was 3. I was setting on the sofa one morning
when he</b>
<br><b>walked in the room and said "Hi David!" I thought he must have started
having</b>
<br><b>an imaginary friend like I have heard that many children have. It
was strange</b>
<br><b>though because he was staring right next to me like someone was
standing</b>
<br><b>there. He than said "Mommy your friend is in the river he was just
playing</b>
<br><b>but he got hurt" and went off to play. Not a minute after he walked
out my</b>
<br><b>phone rang, it was a friend calling to tell me that David had drowned
in the</b>
<br><b>river last night.</b>
<br><b>6 months ago we purchased an adorable bungalow built in 1945. Strange
things</b>
<br><b>started happening immediatly. All having to do with my children.
In the</b>
<br><b>middle of the night I will wake up go upstairs and see that they
have kicked</b>
<br><b>off there covers, run to the restroom, go back to cover them up
only to find</b>
<br><b>them already covered, with the blankets tucked under them. There
toys have</b>
<br><b>also turned themselves on.&nbsp; The most amazing thing happened
2 weeks ago.</b>
<br><b>After putting the kids to bed and going downstairs we heard loud
footsteps</b>
<br><b>upstairs, thinking that one of the children was being naughty my
husband went</b>
<br><b>upstairs. The televison was smoking and turning on and off with
no sound. I</b>
<br><b>had watered the plant on top of the entertainment center right before
bed not</b>
<br><b>realizing my husband had also watered it that day the water had
all run into</b>
<br><b>the tv. The television was seconds away from catching fire. If our
ghost had</b>
<br><b>not warned us with the stamping our children would have surely died.
My 3</b>
<br><b>year old daughter has talked about her Grandmother Lily several
times things</b>
<br><b>like Grandma Lily playing Barbies with her etc.. The only problem
is we don't</b>
<br><b>even know anyone named Lily. I decided to do a little research and
found out</b>
<br><b>that sure enough an elderly woman had died in our home and you guessed
it her</b>
<br><b>name is Lily! I am very thankful for our ever watchful Grandmother
ghost,</b>
<br><b>although strange its nice to know there is someone helping me look
over my</b>
<br><b>babies.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Shadows By My Door</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SykoPaperDoll@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>hello. my name is Kristy. i live in clearwater florida. i have always
been</b>
<br><b>fascinated in spirits and all things supernatural. well, anyways,
to my</b>
<br><b>story. one night about oh, say, 2 months ago, i was in my room listening
to</b>
<br><b>music with my door closed. i had always noticed something peculiar
about my</b>
<br><b>room, from sounds, to my radio cutting out, to my cat flipping out
and</b>
<br><b>staring towards my door for hours on end. well, i had my tube-blacklight
on.</b>
<br><b>ive heard from some people that blacklight is supposed to be "true
light".</b>
<br><b>well. i was laying on my bed, writing poems, when i saw a dark shadow
come</b>
<br><b>over me. i looked up and nothing was there. this scared the crap
outa me so i</b>
<br><b>quickly got up and turned my other light on. later, i went back
to the</b>
<br><b>blacklight to see if this figure would come back. sure enough, a
dark figure</b>
<br><b>by my door appeared. i asked him what he wanted and he dissapeared.&nbsp;
later</b>
<br><b>on, i was feeling tired and so i went to sleep. it was pitch black
in my room</b>
<br><b>and i was turned on my side. i was in that period of sleep where
your mind is</b>
<br><b>awake but your body is asleep. you know, in between sort of. well.
i felt a</b>
<br><b>hard blow to the lower part of my back. i got freaked out and it
hurt like</b>
<br><b>hell, so i went into my moms room and slept on the floor the rest
of the</b>
<br><b>night. the next morning i had a huge bruise on my back the size
of a navel</b>
<br><b>orange. this bothered me. being somewhat interested in wicca and
its beliefs,</b>
<br><b>i have a pentogram ring. i guess you could say i had an experience
where i</b>
<br><b>was "posessed" by something. i was taking to my best friend Austin
on the</b>
<br><b>phone and the only thing i really remember was not being myself.
i</b>
<br><b>immediately looked at my door and felt a extreme sence of evil.
i inverted my</b>
<br><b>pentogram ring and said "come and get me"&nbsp; about 5 minutes
later i started</b>
<br><b>crying and a big chill ran through me. about a week later, i saved
Austin</b>
<br><b>from being killed by tresspassers at his hunting camp. (if you e-mail
me or</b>
<br><b>IM me i will explain this more.) i believe this spirit in my room
opened up</b>
<br><b>some psychic power inside me and now i can predict things. so even
though</b>
<br><b>whoever he was hurt me and scared me, i thank him for showing me
i have this</b>
<br><b>gift. to this day the shadow by my door still visits me. i think
of him as a</b>
<br><b>"lucky charm".</b><b></b>

<br><b>Dead horses and humans</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LoreleiSang@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have believed in ghosts since the night when I was about 6 years
old. I woke up one night, there was no thunderstorm and I was not sick
the next day, then I got up in my bed to&nbsp; find a huge lighted silhouette
of a human being standing in the center of my room. I got off the bed,
but was frozen, I literally had no way of moving, but I suddenly just broke
out and ran into my parents bedroom- smashing my cats on the way- I didn't
look back, for fear of what I might see. I slept in my parents bed that
night, only to wake up again, this time I kept my eyes shut, but I was
hot, I wanted to be at the end of the bed where I wouldn't be so crammed
in by my parents, then, it felt as if two hands were picking me up and
lifting me to the end of the bed, I know it wasn't a dream because I woke
up in the same position. Then recently, I began to feel a cold breath wherever
I went, and it sometimes felt as if a horse's hoof was hitting me in the
leg, then one night, I thought I heard a snort, I turned to see a flash
of brown. I had made my own talking board years ago, never to use it, but
I thought, maybe its real, so I called my friend over and we found this
out:</b>
<br><b>The horse was a dead race/war horse named Bombay from the 1700s
and there was a boy named Adam Ejdevk that lived in my friend's house,
he had died at 13 in 1978.</b>
<br><b>Later, in my room I held out my hand. I felt nails, long, kind of
plasticy nails. I returned to my talking board to find that a girl named
Guthivis, who lived in my house, had died at 13 in 1978. She knew Adam
when they were alive and had been boyfriend and girlfriend. They had died
of STD. They had also been on drugs, it made me sad to think about. But
the strange thing is, is that now that I've found this out, I seem to hear
people talking, even when I'm in an empty room. And I even hear Bombay.
He told me that when you die, everyone speaks the same language, and that
I can just understand it.</b><b></b>

<br><b>True Ghostic Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By carlosmeen@prtc.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>These stories happened to me:</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; a.. After having read other people's paranormal brushes with
ghosts, I went to kitchen for snacking before retiring to bed for the nyght.
When I opened my refrigerator I was poked behind my left tight with a sharpened
object. I know it was a pointed object because it felt like. As I was hurting
I turned my necke to verify if intruder was in my kitchen. No body was.
However, this poking is still hurting me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; b.. I was driving on intertown high way 1 to work. My eyes
caught a tall figure when hit skittered across this high way from the bushes.Hit
went through cars and disappeared into the far side.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; c.. I have placed a document into my book. It was placed
at the beginning for easy finding. When I looked for it I couldn't find
it. I knew I hadth not lose hit. Due to my innate nature of perseverance,
I kept scanning all its parts of this book for it many times. Even I cursed
these ghosts for this disappearing. Before I resumed this looking, I said
to my self I knew I put it at the beginning. When I opened this book, this
document reappeared !</b><b></b>

<br><b>My "Guardian Angel"</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: thedevilslittleangel@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I remember when I was about 3 or 4 years old, my family used
to go to a</b>
<br><b>small Island in British Columbia to visit my grandparents.&nbsp;
It was VERY</b>
<br><b>early in the morning (about 2 or 3 am) when i awoke from a nightmare.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>took me a minute to settle down when my heart finally slowed to
its normal</b>
<br><b>pace, I looked up at the door.&nbsp; Right then it creaked open...
and me being 3</b>
<br><b>I thought it was my mother rushing in to see what the commotion
was all</b>
<br><b>about.&nbsp; But to my surprise... it wasn't my mother at all...
but 3 men.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; They came into the bedroom and just looked at me.&nbsp; I
remember vividly what</b>
<br><b>they look like... one (the smallest) was carrying his head (which
at the age</b>
<br><b>i was, was very scary) the second was very badly cut all over his
body and</b>
<br><b>the third had a bullet wound in his forehead.&nbsp; I started to
scream when one</b>
<br><b>of them moved toward me... I remember his husky voice saying to
me, "Don't</b>
<br><b>worry, we are not here to hurt you, and we never will hurt you...
now go</b>
<br><b>back to sleep." Then as quickly as they came, they disappeared.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I never told my parents about this mysterious event until
about 5 years</b>
<br><b>ago... when stuff started happening... like cupboard doors opening
by them</b>
<br><b>selves and doors slamming shut.&nbsp; I decided to tell my parents
that it was</b>
<br><b>"my ghost"&nbsp; neither of them believed me, my mom said it was
probably all a</b>
<br><b>dream... but at that age... you don't remember dreams for this long.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>still know he hangs around because last year, a few of my friends
and i were</b>
<br><b>watching The 6th Sense, when both me and one of my best friends
saw him</b>
<br><b>sitting on the steps staring at us.&nbsp; Plus every once in awhile
when i want</b>
<br><b>to go on the computer... it will turn on automatically.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I think he is a lost soul... but my friends think I have
a guardian angel</b>
<br><b>watching me... what do you think?</b>

<p><b>Hang in There</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: KVosmus@unum.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My grandfather passed on a few months ago. We were very close as
he was with almost anyone. He was an active man and always had activities
going on. I am just like him. But I have been in a VERY unhappy marriage
for about 4 years. Not one person in my family likes my husband. Including
my grandpa. They think I am a better person than he is and I should leave.
But with two children it was really hard. About a month ago I finally did
it, I left. My father is away on a six week excursion with his wife, driving
around the country. So he told me to stay at his house while they are gone.
I am trying to be strong but at the same time I am very lonely. Two nights
ago I was watching a sad movie and it got me feeling bad for myself. So
I was crying (more like sobbing) and talking aloud to myself. I was saying
that all I have to do is hold on and stick it out and eventually, the hurt
would go away.</b>
<br><b>That night I went to bed and heard the strangest noises. I swore
that I could hear someone talking and walking around. But the harder I
tried to listen, the less I could hear. It was like I could only hear it
when I stopped thinking about it for a minute. It wasn't at all scary to
me because in the end I concluded that it was just the house settling.</b>
<br><b>The next morning I put the children in the car, and went back into
the house to make sure the coffee pot was turned off. I paused in the entryway
to slip on my shoes. In that moment, this overwhelming sense (I can't really
explain) came over me. It was a scent, my grandpa's. Comforting. It smelled
just like his pipe smoke. Forgetting momentarily that he was gone, I turned
around expecting to see him. And when I did, not a cold feeling like I've
heard others say, but an incredibly warm sensation came over me. My body
was tingling almost. As if someone was hugging me without the pressure.
I got so emotional, I immediately burst into tears. As I was driving to
work, later on, I couldn't stop smiling. And all I can think now, is that
everything is going to be alright, and that I can make it on my own.</b>
<br><b>I can't help to think it was my grandpa saying to hang in there.</b>

<p><b>Attracting Spirits</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: WeetieGurl80@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>let me just start off by saying i think that someone in my family
strongly</b>
<br><b>attracts spirits because as long as i can remember there's always
been some</b>
<br><b>kind of paranormal activity going on around us.&nbsp; my family
has never had much</b>
<br><b>money and almost every house we've lived in has been haunted.&nbsp;
most of the</b>
<br><b>houses my parents rented were cheap because someone had died in
them or they</b>
<br><b>were extremely old.&nbsp; there was one house we lived in that was
turn of the</b>
<br><b>century and the owner had died in what was the children's "playroom".&nbsp;
it was</b>
<br><b>always cold in that room and there was a room upstairs that served
as a</b>
<br><b>sunroom and that one was continuously cold as well and the door
would not</b>
<br><b>stay closed.&nbsp; my father would often times lock it only to find
it open later</b>
<br><b>on.&nbsp; we even tried to weight the door down with bricks to keep
it shut but</b>
<br><b>nothing helped.&nbsp; my brother's room was next to the sunroom
and one evening he</b>
<br><b>saw a young girl in a flowing nightgown run from the bathroom across
the hall</b>
<br><b>into the sunroom.&nbsp; thinking it was my younger sister he called
out "renae,</b>
<br><b>get in bed or i'm telling mom!" me and my sister shared a room and
puzzled we</b>
<br><b>called back, "we're in the bed!" from that nigbt on my&nbsp; brother
slept in our</b>
<br><b>bedroom and even switched bedrooms with me because he was scared
to sleep by</b>
<br><b>himself.&nbsp; i, myself, always felt as though someone were watching
me and would</b>
<br><b>sometimes see things out of the corner of my eye.&nbsp; my father,&nbsp;
while</b>
<br><b>attempting sleep one night, felt someone or something tugging on
his toes</b>
<br><b>playfully.&nbsp; some years on we moved into a house with seven
acres of land</b>
<br><b>about it.&nbsp; it also had served as a battlefield for the civil
war.&nbsp; enough</b>
<br><b>said.&nbsp; there was a marble marker across the street saying general
george</b>
<br><b>mcclellan had used a house around the area as his headquarters.&nbsp;
when we</b>
<br><b>first moved into the house i began hearing the sound of drums outside
in the</b>
<br><b>early hours of the morning. nobody would believe me in the house
until my</b>
<br><b>brother and his friends from next door spent the night outside in
their</b>
<br><b>clubhouse and also heard it and came screaming into the house at
2am.&nbsp; my</b>
<br><b>father would get home late at night and hear the sound of wagons
and horses</b>
<br><b>hooves pounding across the field in front of our house and see nothing
there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;inside the house i would frequently be jolted awake.&nbsp;
it felt as though</b>
<br><b>someone were pushing me and i would often shout out thinking it
was my</b>
<br><b>brother only to find myself alone in the house.&nbsp; my brother
and i also heard</b>
<br><b>footsteps upstairs like a woman walking in high heeled shoes.&nbsp;
i would hear</b>
<br><b>faint whispering voices early in the morning and sometimes hear
my name being</b>
<br><b>called.&nbsp; i believe that particular house and the land around
it were</b>
<br><b>inhabited by civil war soldiers.&nbsp; i recently moved out of my
parents house</b>
<br><b>and into an apartment in the city.&nbsp; i think there was definitely
activity in</b>
<br><b>the apartment but no ghost.&nbsp; i would frequently see little
balls of light</b>
<br><b>flickering about the apartment and whenever you took a picture inside
the</b>
<br><b>aprtment it was present in the picture.&nbsp; i never felt a presence
but i'm sure</b>
<br><b>there is some kind of energy there.&nbsp; i think there is a lot
of negative</b>
<br><b>energy there as well because since my boyfriend and i have moved
out we have</b>
<br><b>not had one argument.&nbsp; when we lived there we had such animosity
towards each</b>
<br><b>other and would fight all the time.</b><b></b>

<p><b>1947 pennies</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: stephaniejphillips@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have a ghost story to share.&nbsp; Approximately nine years ago,
my husband and I moved into a new apartment in Mesa, Arizona two weeks
before our first child was due to be born.&nbsp; We had lived in the same
complex since we were married, and were just now moving into a two bedroom
unit.&nbsp; The complex itself was built in an orange grove and was no
more than 20 years old. Shortly after the baby arrived, strange things
started to happen.&nbsp; One day I walked into his room to check on him
while he was napping, and to my surprise several toys were stacked in a
tower in the middle of his floor.&nbsp; Some trick for a two-week old!&nbsp;
As no one else was home, that gave me a little shiver.&nbsp; The haunting
also seemed to involve water.&nbsp; Faucets in the kitchen and bathroom
would turn on full blast with no one near by.&nbsp; I even had the maintenance
man check them out, but even with new gaskets they still turned on by themselves.&nbsp;
We also experienced electrical disturbances. My grandparents had given
us a lamp that was turned on by touch for a wedding present.&nbsp; We had
noticed in the past that when lightning struck nearby, the lamp would come
on.&nbsp; In the new apartment, the lamp was often on in the middle of
the night or in the morning when we woke up.&nbsp; By far the oddest manifestation
involved pennies.&nbsp; We would find 1947 pennies on the floor of the
kitchen.&nbsp; We only found them in the kitchen, and they were always
1947 pennies.&nbsp; At times, we would find two or three at once.&nbsp;
We had a small cupful that we would show to our friends.&nbsp; At the time,
we thought these events were strange, but we weren't terrified.&nbsp; It
could have been that we weren't thinking clearly due to lack of sleep with
an infant in the house!&nbsp; I do know that I didn't like to be alone
in the apartment.&nbsp; I hated to vacuum, because I couldn't hear what
was happening around me.&nbsp; I felt like I couldn't let my guard down.&nbsp;
Needless to say, we didn't renew our lease after six months and moved to
a new house.&nbsp; I have heard of hauntings that involved water, but I
would be curious if anyone else has found items like the pennies.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Condo Scare</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: EGonz57173@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This story is as scary as they get. I have lived in my condominiums
since I</b>
<br><b>was about 5 years old, I am now 17. Last year three men moved in
together 2</b>
<br><b>houses away. The last summer one of these men committed suicide,
I have no</b>
<br><b>idea why. He rented a van, went to sleep in it as he left the muffler
pipe</b>
<br><b>clogged and let himself die. In the back of his garage is where
the suicide</b>
<br><b>was committed. Now, my best friend lives inside the condominiums
and to get</b>
<br><b>inside I have to pass by the house where this man killed himself.
Passing by</b>
<br><b>the house there is three windows that allow you to see the stairs
of the</b>
<br><b>condominium. I would always pass by these windows and think to my
self</b>
<br><b>"imagine if this guy(the ghost)pops out and scares me". About 5
or 6 months</b>
<br><b>after his death, I was one night walking by this house headed towards
my best</b>
<br><b>friends house. I looked inside the first window and noticed a man
looking out</b>
<br><b>as if he were nodding his head saying NO! He had the scariest look
on his</b>
<br><b>face and had his eyes wide open. It was the man that had committed
suicide</b>
<br><b>and I knew it. I stopped, looked at the man and immediately ran
back home</b>
<br><b>frightened and shocked as hell. It was the worst feeling ever. I
have told</b>
<br><b>people what I have see but they all tell me I was just seeing things.
Im sure</b>
<br><b>you guys believe me. I know what I saw. I was scared of passing
through there</b>
<br><b>for the next month or so. I never walk through there in the night
and if I</b>
<br><b>do, I never ever look inside that window any longer. I have always
been a</b>
<br><b>believer in ghosts and now that I saw this I am even more of a believer.</b><b></b>

<br><b>step down step, so the ball would have to be retrieved</b>
<br><b>by hand if we wanted it back.&nbsp; Well my little girl was</b>
<br><b>going to have to go and get it back, but before she</b>
<br><b>could get up to do so, the ball returned.&nbsp; I looked at</b>
<br><b>her and she looked at me.&nbsp; She knew the ball could not</b>
<br><b>return by itself and so she was a little surprised by</b>
<br><b>what had happened.&nbsp; It was probably nothing but it was</b>
<br><b>kind of weird for it to have happened like that.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Info on Gridiron Club, Baltimore, Maryland</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gromet2@ij.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was sent your web site by a friend who knows that I am a true believer.&nbsp;
You can imagine my surprise (most people do not believe in the unknown)
when I checked and noted that the Gridiron Club in Baltimore County Maryland
was listed as a story.&nbsp; I once worked at that club which was purchased
by the Kiwanis Club of Towson in the late 1960's, however the old building
which once housed slaves was in use as the office.&nbsp; On many occasions
I heard footsteps, what sounded like chains (this was explained as the
slaves trying to walk), one of the windows in one room would be closed
AND locked at night and yet EVERY morning that same window was open!&nbsp;
I saw, what appeared to be, a woman dressed in white (this was thought
to be Mrs. Hillen who once lived in the main house and was abusive to the
slaves).&nbsp; I was only frightened once enough to flee the building -
I was alone in the office (I worked for the Kiwanis Club) and when I was
alone I brought 2 dogs into the office with me.&nbsp; I heard noises in
the back of the building and I had thought I would go investigate until
I noticed that both dogs had awakened and the hair on their backs was standing
up and they both were growling while looking towards the back of the building.&nbsp;
These dogs didn't growl that I had ever heard, so that was when I made
the decision to leave the building.&nbsp; I do not know what made them
growl, and I never found out the reason for their odd behavior.</b>
<br><b>The building has since been torn down and condos built however I
have always wondered if any of the residents have ever heard or seen anything
that might suggest ghosts were still around.&nbsp; I moved to Florida in
1992 and have lost touch with anyone that may know of any unusual happenings
at the condos.&nbsp; I have read that sometimes a ghost will return even
if the original building has been replaced.</b>
<br><b>I plan to visit your web site often as I have always found ghosts
to be a fascinating subject.</b>
<br><b>I have had other experiences at a place where I worked, but have
never investigated.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for letting me share this.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Town House Spirit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MaArc3487@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have been living in this town house for about three years. The
first</b>
<br><b>experience I had was a couple of times.The water in my upstairs
basin was</b>
<br><b>running full force. The first time was during the day and when I
discouvered</b>
<br><b>it I thought maybe I had just forgot to turn it off. The second
time was</b>
<br><b>during the night. This stopped and nothing happened again until
just before</b>
<br><b>Easter this year. The first night my dog barked and just thought
it was</b>
<br><b>probably nothing. When I got up that morning my kitchen light was
on.&nbsp; You</b>
<br><b>doubt yourself, thinking maybe I had forgotten to turn it off that
night. Two</b>
<br><b>nights later the dog barked again, wanting out, and at this time
I found the</b>
<br><b>light to be on again. That was about 1:00 A.M.This time knowing
I had turned</b>
<br><b>it off. The next night I was up until about 12:45 A.M. went upstairs,
got</b>
<br><b>ready for bed and just as I layed down I saw the light was on again.
By now I</b>
<br><b>froze. I finally did get up and turned it off . The other thing
I question is</b>
<br><b>a travel brochure. I had booked a trip on a cruise line and about
a week</b>
<br><b>before we were to leave, I received all the information including
the cabin</b>
<br><b>number. I decided to get the book out to see where it was located
and there</b>
<br><b>was already a check mark after the cabin. At one other point I had
ironed a</b>
<br><b>blouse and hung it on the back of a chair. Forgot about it for a
couple of</b>
<br><b>days. As I was walking through the t.v.room, which I am in everyday,
there</b>
<br><b>was a button laying in the middle of the floor from this blouse.
When I</b>
<br><b>checked it the button was missing from the pocket and the thread
on the</b>
<br><b>button was tight. It had not been cut . That has been the last occurance.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My two little boys</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: fireevy@hotmail.com]Paige</b><b></b>
<p><b>At the age of 8, my family moved me to the middle east. A small place
called</b>
<br><b>Doha, Qutar. Before we could move into my house there, my family
&amp; I had to</b>
<br><b>stay in a large hotel for about a month. The hallway outside our
door</b>
<br><b>smelled like rotted eggs, and our "room" had enough beds-each in
different</b>
<br><b>compartments- for me and my brother to sleep by our selves leaving
my mom &amp;</b>
<br><b>dad to also have their own room. I suffered from a major case of
jet lag. It</b>
<br><b>was worse than any member in my family. At night, I would just lay
in bed,</b>
<br><b>staring at the ceiling.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My room had always given me a chill down my spine. But one</b>
<br><b>night, I was trying to sleep and a small hand grabbed mine under
the covers.</b>
<br><b>I pulled away, and looked over to that side of the bed. There was
the face</b>
<br><b>of a little Arab boy peeking his head over the side of the bed.
He looked</b>
<br><b>frightened. I screamed and ran to my mom's room. She said it was
nothing and</b>
<br><b>told me to go back to bed. When I got there, he was gone.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The next night, I sat up in bed staring at the wall near</b>
<br><b>the door. The light was off, and my door was closed. I blinked,
and when I</b>
<br><b>opened my eyes again, there was a different little boy in colorful
overalls</b>
<br><b>running towards my bed. He looked even more scared then the boy
from the</b>
<br><b>night before. I couldn't move, I was so shocked. He disappears behind
the</b>
<br><b>foot board, and appeared right in front of me standing up. He reached
out</b>
<br><b>and started shaking me viscously. I still couldn't move to get away,
and</b>
<br><b>just stared at the kid. He looked about 3.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Suddenly he turned around and screamed, covering his face.</b>
<br><b>The only way I could explain what happened next is as if something
came</b>
<br><b>sideways through him and he turned to mist from the middle out.
It scared me</b>
<br><b>so much that I screamed bloody murder, and fell off the bed onto
the floor.</b>
<br><b>Coincidentally, the air conditioning came on right then, so my mom
could</b>
<br><b>explain it as just that. I tried to explain, but she cut me off.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two years later, I completed 4th grade, and my mom took me</b>
<br><b>back to America. She had separated from my dad, and my brother had
already</b>
<br><b>left for home about a month before. And since then, I've been trying
to</b>
<br><b>figure out what had happened to those boys...</b>
