</span>11 July 2009.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few nights ago &#8211;
I don&#8217;t know if I was awake or if I was asleep but I had a scary dream
or a
scary experience and I don&#8217;t know which of the two it was even now.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I had rather think it was a dream than think
it wasn&#8217;t but here is what happened&#8230; I can&#8217;t say even now for sure.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Background information, I am a recently
retired Army Officer with nearly 25 years of active duties.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I work in Iraq as a DA Civilian and live in a
metal building called a containerized houing unit that is something
like a
trailer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you look at it from the
front it has a door on the right and a door on the left <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">&#8211; these
go to two rooms &#8211; one for me
and one for another guy and in the center there is a bathroom we share
in the
center and each of us have a door to that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My room is on the left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When you
go in my room straight ahead against the back wall is a sink and mirror.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>To the left of the sink against the back wall
is my full size office desk, to the left of that against the back wall
is a
wardrobe, and to the left of that against the back wall<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and also the back corner is a small
refrigerator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the narrow wall sort of
to the left of and in front of the refrigerator is a wooded chair I
built and
then against the front wall on the far corner is my bed and it runs
along the
length of the front wall almost all the way back to the door.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to say that the foot of the bed is
just to the left of the door when you enter the room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The whole room is about 8 feet x 12
feet.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well a few nights ago I was
asleep and either I dreamed I woke up or I really woke up and standing
at the
end of my desk next to the wardrobe was a black shadowy figure.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The room of course was dark so all<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I could see was a darker shade of
darkness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It looked to me like the
shadow of a woman with long loose hair in some sort of long flowing
gown or
robe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was laying on my back and I
opened my eyes and I saw or thought I saw this figure standing there
and it
didn&#8217;t move until I got startled and then it sort of quickly rose up
and dove
right into my wooden chair and disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I reached up and turned on a reading light I have mounted on the
wall
over my head and of course nothing was their but it gave me such a
start that I
had to stay awake for a few minutes to clear my head of it.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I hope it was just a weird dream. The
figure
on the right of the hat man is more like what I think I may have seen.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>When It dove into the chair it seemed to me
like the feet stayed on the floor and the body arched forward &#8211; long
hair or
something trailed out behind the head &#8211; and then as the head would have
reached
the chair then the feet end of it<span style="">&nbsp; </span>came
up off the floor and followed in the arch to the chair. I have not been
bothered by the apparition since nor ever before this one incident so I
don&#8217;t
know if I was dreaming it all or not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">This
happened around December of
2008. My Husband and I were watching TV late one evening. I fell asleep
in a
recliner. My Husband put a blanket on me, and turned the lights and TV
off. He
turned a small light on over the kitchen sink, and went to bed in a
bedroom in
the basement. Around 3am I woke to my Husband coming up the basement
steps. The
family room was dark, except for a dim lighting that came from the
kitchen.The
recliner I was in, faced the front door. The front door has a small
nook, where
you can hang jackets etc.. As my Husband is stomping up the stairs, I
see a
very dark shadow of a man, standing in front of the door. The shadow
man, did a
one step jump, into the nook area, and disappears from my view. I just
raised
my eyebrows, and thought what the heck? My Husband is now in the
kitchen. I
hear him in this weak, frustrated shaky voice say " Honey? are you
awake?
I said yup. He goes well, are you going to come to bed? " I say, slowly
yes" There is this few second silence and he goes, " I just have the
creeps right now""I do not like sleeping down there by myself" I
didn't dare say anything about the shadow man at that moment. I could
see my
Husband was stressed. So we both go to bed. The next morning I asked my
Husband
why he felt "creeped out" He said he woke up, and felt like someone
was standing near him. He said he tried to brush it off, but then he
swore he
saw a shadow of a person standing, on the other side of the bed. He
said at
that moment he actually got ticked, kicked his blankets off, and
stormed up the
stairs to get me. I then just realized that where my Husband saw this
shadow
man, is exactly under the front door, where I saw the shadow man. I
have no
doubt, that when my Husband got up, and came upstairs, this shadow man,
said to
itself, "oh no, I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>really angered
this guy, I have to get out of here, and floated straight up, threw the
floor,
and tried to hide from my Husband as he came upstairs. This is when I
saw the
shadow man, as he jumped into hiding, by the coat rack. Its hard to
explain,
but it was almost humorous. My Husband, is a good person, but he has a
short
fuse, This ghost, and that leap, was hilarious. I had no fear when I
saw it, I
got the impression, this shadow man was quite a character in his time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">A close
friend of mine grew up in
Cherokee, Oklahoma. I have her permission to share her experience. She
feels it
might bring bad luck for her to tell the experience herself. It was
summertime
and she was sleeping over her grandparents' house. It was about 8:15 or
so in
the evening. Her grandma had<span style="">&nbsp; </span>just put
her to bed. She was around 5 yrs old and it was hot and she wasn't
sleepy. She
got up and sat by the open bedroom window to look outside. There was a
pasture
near the house. It was still fairly light out. She saw what she thought
was a
man in an animal skin. He was close enough to the window so she could
see him
well. He was tall and slender and had fur on him. He was chanting but
she
couldn't make out the words. He turned and when she saw his profile she
thought
it was very odd.. He had an animal's head! She said he had a long face
like a
deer and large ears like a deer. He was covered in fur..She described
the fur
as similar to a shaggy cow or horse in the winter time. It was brown in
color.
He had a dead crow in his "hand". He had long claws instead of
fingers. He lifted the dead crow skyward. As she watched, he faded
away. He
didn't walk away, he just disappeared. It was still light enough for
her to see
that he didn't walk away. There were no trees or buildings to obstruct
the
view! Her grandparents were in another room. She ran to tell them what
she saw.
Her grandfather told her not to worry, that they couldn't hurt her and
she was
protected. She asked who the man or animal was. Her grandfather told
her he
would tell her when she was older and could understand better. The next
morning
there was a dead crow where she saw the being. Her grandfather burned
some
herbs, said some prayers and buried the crow. She never asked her
grandparents
who or what she saw. They have since passed away. Her mother grew up in
the
same house and had paranormal experiences there but never saw this
strange
being. She didn't know what it was either. I read a lot of ghost
stories and
have heard a lot of experiences from friends. This is one of the few
that
really frightened me!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

amazing how many people here
have had more than one experience with ghosts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I believe that once you have experienced it, it never leaves you
and you
always recognize that feeling again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyway, I posted a story about the house in Bingen, Washington a
long
time ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were Mexican migrant
workers and traveled from place to place looking for work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We always were given the worst places to live
while we worked the fields &#8211; one room cabins or old broken down
trailers &#8211;but
one summer, in Bingen, to our surprise we were given this big sunny
beautiful
house &#8211;big picture window with a view of the Hood River.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We soon found out why&#8230;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My middle
sister and I shared a bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would always
laugh and talk under our
breaths until we fell asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night
we were giggling away quietly when we felt something come in.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We pulled the covers over our head
terrified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our cat hissed!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My throat was seized like and I could not
utter a sound even through I tried to scream.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I could feel my sister trembling in the bed beside me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The thing came in the room and I felt the edge
of the bed go down like a person was sitting on it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It sat there a bit, then got up and left. Our
throats were released and we screamed and screamed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My dad and brother came in with a shotgun we
were screaming so loud!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do not ask
me
why but I believe to this day it was female, a sad dejected woman.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I also believe she murdered her children in
that house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s
a long story, but I&#8217;ll try to be
brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was babysitting my littlest
brother and sister &#8211; then about 2 and 3 years old.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had put them in the bathtub and was looking
out the window when I heard them singing this little song &#8211; kotchie
kotchie
kotchie and making little sawing motions on their baby necks with their
fingers, then rubbing pretend tears from their eyes!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Maybe she came into the bedroom where my
sister and I slept because she missed her children??<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I can&#8217;t explain why I believe this, it is
just what I feel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something tells me it
was a woman who murdered her kids.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">When I
was a young girl, I just
loved animals. I preferred to hang out with my pets, more then I did my
friends. Our neighbor had a brown and white hunting dog named Corkey.
They had
no children and worked alot. They would leave Corkey outside during the
days
while they worked.I would go over and play with Corkey everyday, and
try to
teach him tricks. I just loved that <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">dog.
Corkey lived to be 12 years
old. I was now 16 years old. It was a cold spring day. I put my robe
and
slippers on, and went to grab a soda off the back patio. I opened the
back door
and saw Corkey sitting in his usual spot. I called out " hey Corkey"
the dog, never moved. He just sat and starred at me. I said "oh Corkey,
what's the matter?" the dog still never flinched and just kept looking
at
me. I took the soda and went inside. I was getting a glass out of the
cupboard,
and my Mom walked in. I made the comment that it sure is cold out
today, and I
cant believe they are leaving that poor dog out all day like that. My
Mom goes,
" Corkey was put down 2 weeks ago, he had cancer, and was suffering."
I said, "no Mom I just saw him a few minutes ago" my Mom who was
stubborn and never wrong, says sarcastically " the dog is dead, I
talked
to her, [meaning the neighbor woman] she was very upset about losing
him"
I being sure I was right, walked over to the window and looked out, and
now saw
that Corkey was not outside, wondered myself. I re-thought what I had
seen out
there. I remember feeling that it was odd that Corkey never wagged his
tail or moved
when I called out to him, I also remember seeing his chain, hanging
down from
his neck. There was no chain even out there anymore. It really shocked
me. i
couldn't believe it. Then it started to make sense. That feeling I had
when the
dog did not respond, it was that odd feeling, like in the back of your
head,
something isn't right, but you brush it off feeling. I have read and
heard
others tell stories of seeing a ghost, that appeared to be alive and
solid.
They all say the same thing. " They had no expression on their face,
you
could not tell what they were feeling at all" what I think about the
most
is, that I called out to him twice, and he never responded, just sat
and
starred at me, if someone else would have been next to me, would they
have seen
him? or did I just look like a crazy person, calling out to a non
existent dog?
Its just so bizarre I clearly saw and spoke to a dog that was not alive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The
summer of 2007 had to be one of the hardest times of my life. I owned a
home
for 17 years. This home had been my Grandpas. The home had many fond
memories.
I brought all 4 of my Daughters home from the hospital to be raised
there. I
had got caught up in a refinancing scam, and along with poor choices on
my
part, had been served with foreclosure papers one afternoon. That day I
spent
crying, and in allot of despair. There was no way I could save the
home. I knew
it was over. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
fell asleep on the couch that night, just frazzled and in complete
mourning. I
wondered where we would go. What is going to happen to my family. I
felt like I
had let my Grandparents down, by losing this family home. They were
deceased
but always loved this home, and wanted it to be kept in the family. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
had awoke around 1am, on the couch. The house was dark, and everyone
was fast
asleep. I started to smell the scent of roses. I lifted my head and
looked
around. The smell got stronger. I sat up, and now, I thought maybe one
of my kids
had gotten into a can of air freshener. The rose smell became over
bearing. I
stood up, and turned on a light. The smell was permeating the family
room. I
walked threw the house trying to find a source for this smell. Everyone
was
sound asleep. I walked back in the family room, and it was just gone! I
could
smell nothing. I could not understand how a scent that over bearing one
moment
could just vanish the next moment. It never faded out, just disappeared
completely. I did a second walk threw of the house, there was no
source, to
cause the scent. I even put my face in a clean towel and took several
deep
sniffs, and then smelled the room again. There was no sign of the
roses. I then
just shook my head, and laid back down on the couch. I decided to turn
the TV
on low, to take my mind off of everything. I just pushed the power
button on
the remote. I didn't care what was on TV. I just wanted some background
noise
to fall back asleep to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
close my eyes, and then I hear on TV, a woman starts to talk about the
scent of
roses and angels. I bolt upright. I turn the volume up, and it was a 30
minute
show, on phenomena. This story was of a woman, who lost a parent, and
was
laying in bed one night grieving the loss. She then began to smell
roses in her
home. Her story was very close, to what I just described to you. She
never
found the source, and it disappeared as quick as it came. Her story has
a
different ending. She was touring a very old church, after her rose
incident.
She saw something in the church, about roses. She spoke to the Priest,
regarding her encounter with roses. He told her, when you have the
experience
of the rose scents, its a angel presence. They have come to guide you
threw a
difficult time in your life. They are there to tell you everything will
be ok.
I couldn't believe what I was watching. What would be the odds of
having this
experience, then turning on the TV and seeing this very unique
documentary, at
that very moment. I think I have 300 plus channels, and I happened to
turn the
TV on, just to that show at that moment. I have no doubt in my mind,
that all
of that evening, was not a coincidence, but someone or something,
trying to
help me threw such a bad time in my life. I believe in my heart, that
there is
such a thing and the scent of roses and guardian angels. If anyone else
has
info, or stories that pertain to this, please email me, or share them
with
everyone on here. Thank you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">When my
Mom was sick with cancer I
would take several trips from Dallas to Chicago to go visit her and my
Grandma.
We knew that she didn't have much time left when we would hear her in
the
bedroom talking to Fluffy her dog, her Dad, her Grandma, and our
favorite Aunt.
But all these people had been dead for quite some time now. She would
always
make us leave the bedroom light and lamp on always. We could go in
after she
was asleep and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">turn
them off, but in the morning
they would be on again. After she passed I stayed in Dallas to try and
make it
on my own. I had gotten a one bedroom apartment, my first ever alone.
So I was
working alot trying to keep my mind occupied, sometimes working 12 - 14
hour
shifts. One afternoon I come home after being at work since 6 that
morning,
make a sandwich, shut the blinds, and pass out. After a few hours of
sleep, Im
woken up by a light shining in my face. I get out of bed and every
single light
and ceiling fan was on in my apartment! I snatched my keys off the
table by the
front door and leave my apartment. Even though I felt like it was my
Mom, I was
still very frightened. It hasn't happened again, but I think maybe its
because
after that, I got a night light.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
was driving home to Maryland on Sunday from Florida when I stayed for
the night
at a hotel in Richmond Hill, Georgia.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The hotel was a Days Inn, but the receipt still had the Scottish
Inn
letterhead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could tell that it was an
updated interior inside an older motel type structure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Richmond
Hill is just off I-95 about 20 miles from Savannah right on the Oceegee
River.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The intersection is a primary
road leading into Savannah, and has a very nice bridge crossing the
river.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon a local's recommendation, I
ate at the
Love's Restaurant just across the river right at the other side of the
bridge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a very established
"fish camp" seafood place where they filmed scenes from Forrest Gump.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Anyway
after supper, I settled down in my room for the night with the TV on as
I like
to do drifting off to sleep after an hour or two.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
will continue with what happened next in my
narrative for the intended entry for the New Haunted Place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">In
Room 111, I was woken up out of sleep by something unseen rapidly
pushing on
the bed next to me like someone was intentionally trying to wake me up.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>As I woke up, I felt a cold atmosphere slowly
flow into the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was startled by
this, I hesitated for a few seconds to roll over to see what was doing
this,
but when I did, I saw the mattress shaking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I turned my head back, and saw a bluish, globe-like, object
floating in
the air at the foot of the bed. that was slightly opaque.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The orb lasted for about ten seconds until it
dissolved near the ceiling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
had heard knocks and noises throughout the evening since I checked into
the
room, but put this up to noise from the other rooms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now, I am not sure of this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
have lived in California earthquake zones.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The shaking of the bed was not unlike some earthquakes that I
have
experienced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">This
occurred on June 8, 2009 in the early morning sometime between 1:00 and
3 AM.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">So
as to not startle myself any further, I turned on the light, and
watched TV
until I fell back to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, I
purposely did not look at the clock when this happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I am sure if I saw the time, I would forever
be wary of something scary happening at this time if ever I was awake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
intend to contact this hotel to see if anyone else has ever had this
experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would like to investigate
further, because I suspect being right on a major river near the coast
this
could be old Indian territory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also,
since this is a major road to Savannah, I would like to know if this is
where
Sherman came through from Atlanta during the Civil War.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Although
I am interested in the paranormal, this was the furthest thing<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>from my mind that evening.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I only wanted to get a good night's sleep
before heading back home to Maryland the next day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I feel kind of lucky and satisfied - not
spooked at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

January of 1979, 1 weak after my
birthday, at around 3 a.m. for some reason i woke up and i had a bad
feeling in
my stomach. Kinda tight, cold, and tingling. I looked to my right and i
saw a
dark figure moving towards me and i noticed it had no legs and its arms
were
reaching out. I'm not sure what it was reaching for but i had to get
out of
there. I got up and ran for the light, i turned it on and saw nothing.
but it
still scared me.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>3 days
later i was
sitting in the doorway to my room playing and i gt that same feeling
and so i
turned my hear to the Right and i saw a young girl standing at the foot
of my
Kott. She was wearing a white dress that looked quite old. like
something out
of little house on the prairie. she was standing their looking at
something in
her hands and she looked sad. I only saw her for 20 seconds but that
was long
enough. She stood their for a bit then looked up in the same direction
the
other ghost was and she disappeared, i never saw her again. but It has
always
bothered me, who was that little girl, she looked like she was 5 or 6?<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for the next 14 years i had
been haunted,
from shadows to footsteps to creaking sounds. My mother had the best
experience
in that house. she came home from work and went upstairs to her room
and laid
down in bed to relax. after a few minutes, from what she said she herd
the
front door open and close. she then herd footsteps on the stairs, then
the door
to the room opened u and then closed. she didn't open her eyes she just
assumed
that it as my dad. she herd footstep's threw the room and then it sat
down on
the bed and then laid down next to her. that's when she turned her head
to say
something to her husband and all she saw was in indentation in the bed
tat rose
up when she looked at it. she got out of their in a hurry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>the last
thing that happened to me their
was in 1992 before we moved out. I was reading a magazine and i was
thinking to
my self i could use more light and suddenly i got some.Well i was
wondering
about the light so i looked up to the curtains and they were pulled out
to let
more light in and as i looked at them they were let go. recently my
wife and i
had a few experience's in our old apartment on sterling in
Independence. She
had seen a few dark figures walking past the door and i herd shuffling
footsteps on carpet. then i saw the ghost walking around my side f the
bed.
that's the last thing i experienced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>to this day I'm still
wondering who was the
Little girl at 8600 e 86th st in Kansas city mo. I don't know why but
it is
really on my mind and i wonder what her name was and what happened <o:p></o:p></span></p>

writing, cause I don't know when
the last update was to the site. I live in Apopka, FL. I noticed that
the last
name of the Capt N Cowboy was still up there. It is now called Highland
Manor.
I have been there to eat since the restaurant reopened a few months
ago. There
has been remodling done. The chef's from what I was told called Ghost
Hunter's
from Sci-Fi to disprove or prove the hauntings. They have had strange
occurences happen since they have reopen from everything I have been
told. When
I was there to eat the glass the waitress was going to grab and put
down on the
table came off of the tray I was watching the whole time. I made a
funny about
it to make her feel better and say "Oh it must had been the ghost'. I
got
absolutely no response out of her like she new nothing of anything at
all about
the ghost. I thought this was strange. Anyways just wanted to write you
guys
with some updated info about that resturant. Also too Coon Hill has had
it's
gates locked while remodeling, because they've had more vandalism. Im
in Pace
visiting my family and I was suppose to go over there to investigate. I
don't
know how long this place will be shut down for, but I was really sad
about
that. Everyone I know who lives up here has claimed to had some type of
experience there. Have a good day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I was
out to dinner with somone I
had actually broke up with,because we get into too many heated
arguments. I
just give in everytime I seem to get stalked by this person.Either way,
we went
to dinner. I have a friend who had died in a car wreck some years back.
It had
been a while since I had been to the cemetary where the plot is. I
decided to
go, while my ex who went to dinner with me, was still around. I have
always had
psychcic abilities, so the events that followed,were self explanatory
to me,
and prooved what I already know. I have always been able to communicate
with
the friend of mine that passed away in the wreck. Many other psychcic
and
mediums tell me he is there to watch over me, which I already knew.We
were like
best friends. Anyways, I went to his grave site,it is always peacful
there.However I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>usually go alone. Less
than 5 minutes after I got out of the car, my ex that was with
me,started to
argue. One thing my ex learned after this, is never to start an
argument with
me (being a psychcic), while visiting the gravesite of a best friend
who is
also watching over me. I became upset and started to leave,and asked my
ex to
stop. I started the car and began to pull off,and my ex did not stop
arguing.
The car,which was as new,and never given me any problems, shut of over
4 times,
before we left the cemetary.Before and after that,the car has never
given me
any problems like this. I knew why the car cut off.My best friend and
spirit
guide,made the car shut off, to get my exes attention to stop
arguing.If that
woudldn't be a lesson learned I don't know what is. Thanks for reading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sam left, me and Chris just jammed for a bit beside my dad's train set
when one
of the mini cars rolled off the road. When we stopped playing the room

to get colder than normal. The next day Chris and my other friend Tyler
came
over. we all went in the basement so we could play for Tyler. when
Chris played
the first note it repeated itself over and over even as we ran up the
stairs. I
was behind everyone and when I looked ba ck the door slammed on it's

 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">On
Palmer Lane in Winston-Salem
there is a house that a good friend of mine used to live in. His name
is Joey.
We went to high school together and all through school he told me his
house was
haunted. Of course, I always told him he was full of crap. We graduated
in
1999, but stayed friends. I was visiting him one night in 2002. We sat
on the
porch for a while and talked about different things-cars, trucks, guns,
4
wheelers(typical guy stuff). It got late and I left to go home. I only
lived 5
to 7 minutes away. As I was pulling in my driveway, my cell phone rang.
It was
Joey. He told me that if I wanted to see what he had been talking about
all
these years to come back to his house NOW. My brother and I went, fully
expecting him to be sitting on the porch laughing because I was dumb
enough to
drive back over there. When I arrived he, his mother, his sister, and
his uncle
were all standing in the living room. Joey told me that as soon as I
left they
started hearing moaning and banging. I still figured he was jerking my
chain,
but I played along. Joey, his uncle, and I sat in the kitchen. My
brother sat
in the living room with Joey's mother and sister. After about 2
minutes, Joey's
mother called for us. When we got there she said she'd heard tapping in
the
fire place(which was never used, and boarded up). My brother
confirmed(he
looked a little scared). We stood there a minute or two. Nothing
happened, so
I, along with Joey and his uncle, went back to the kitchen. Now-when we
were in
the living room, NOONE left. I am 100% certain of this, because we were
engaged
in conversation in sort of a semi-circle around the fire place.
However, when
we returned to the kitchen, all drawers were pulled open, all cabinet
doors
were standing open, and the chandelier above the kitchen table was
pulled down
from the ceiling and swinging back and forth from the wiring. I stopped
dead in
my tracks when I walked through the entry way. My heart started RACING.
I was
SCARED. As all of us were standing there discussing what had happened,
Joeys
sister leaned on the wall. She immediately jumped back, wide-eyed. She
said the
wall "felt weird". I layed my hand on the wall and it seemed to be
vibrating. I pressed my ear against it. I could hear what sounded like
a voise
murmuring something but couldn't make out what it was saying. After
about 5
seconds, the wall pushed me back! I couldn't believe it and thought it
was just
adrenaline or fear or whatever so I tried again. I layed my arm against
the
wall, and it pushed again. It was just enough that you could barely
feel it.
After this we all went outside in the yard. We were terrified. Joey
said that
it had never been like this before(usually just little noises and
such). My
brother and I left to come home after we all calmed down. Joey and his
family
moved from that house within a year. Joey says that the house never got
that
frightening again. But I can assure you-that night it put on a show.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

my mom was driving to the
store on a road in her grand prix car, she was pulling up to an
intersection
when three kids drove up inside of a ghostly looking truck, my mom
tried to get
away, but when she would turn they would follow her, she saw an
intersection to
an alley and finally escaped. when she looked back the car was
completely
gone.here is another one that my uncle passed onto me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>it has been told to different people in our
family and i thought i would pas this onto you.one day my uncle and his
friend
Kurt were driving home from another friends house in my uncle's s10
pickup
truck... they pulled onto a road, and saw something glowing as they
approached
the glowing object that went identified they noticed it was a house,
although
this house was in the middle of the road and was like glaas, you could
see through
it, and there were two men on the front porch, they were yelling at
them to
pull up and come inside, this scared them, they drove back to my
grandma and
grandpa's house to tell them and they said that someone should come and
see for
themselves, when they went back to the location, my uncle and Kurt
identified
the house as the one they had seen there but it was further out on the
road,
and that house had been abandoned for years. my father has told me this
story,
he was at work shutting down the place when everyone had left. the
phone had
rang at the desk, and he answered it. all he heard was breathing on the
other
line and when he looked at the id the room was the conference room in
the place
he worked at that time. he went to that room, the phone cord was
swinging, the
only other people in the building were the night guards, and they were
outside
where they couldn't have reached the phone that fast from the back of
the place
to where the front of the building is. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

another story, again I'm not
sure which ones that I sent before are correct as my cousin used my
email to
send them.My grandma (same as in the other stories) had a friend named
Shannon,
she had some jewelry that was given to her from her grandmother or her
great
aunt, I cant remember which, and one day she woke up and saw the
jewelery on
her bed, the drawer was open.There was no sign of forced entry and
there was
nothing to indicate somebody was in the house, but just her.Also, I
don't talk
about it because some people think it is childish or something, not
sure if it
was <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span

Ok, so one night I was
walking into my bedroom (in a dream) and saw boots on my bed. I thought
it was
weird and yelled to my mother to come. I saw tboz chili and lisa lopez
otherwise known as left eye from tlc walk into the room. I was little
it was
like in 98 or so when the band had just came out I think.I went into
her room
and saw a couple of people that I knew as backup singers of the band
Its just
what i think,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>then in 2001 I think it
was Lisa died. I got the dream back in my head.<span style="">&nbsp;

not verified the last story as
being true because I let my cousin on the computer because he had one.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Here is another one that came passed on from
my great grandma, she was born in 1920 and so if you picture the time,
she was
born right in the great depression times, she never really new about
it, but
her parents did and having 3 kids in that time didn't really help, as
everyone
was low on food in that time. Since I'm 17 I haven't really verified or
researched that term, so I don't know.Anyway one time she was at her
friend
Linda's house. This house was really old, and she had heard that
someone had
died in the kitchen from getting in a fight and getting stabbed. She
was
sleeping in the attic and she was next to her friend, she heard steps
coming up
the ladder, and run back up to where she and her friend were sat
located. This
scared her, and she immediately asap, got her friend up. Of course, of
all
times for it to stop it stopped. Just suddenly, and none of them knew
where it
might have come from or if a person was in the house at all or
something. There
was no sign of forced entry or anything so they didn't assume that.
Then linda
mentioned the thing about her uncle getting stabbed downstairs, and she
had
known what she heard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the butcher dream house, and the one where my grandpa claims he saw his

after he had died.i was on the deck drinking mtn.dew and we started
hearing
please dont stop the music, you know the rihanna song. it would not
stop and
was constant, we yelled since the music was medium in volume and the
person
playing the music would stop playing it so loud, but no response, as we
headed
over there to where the music was coming from the music immediately
stopped,
there is only one house near, and it's the elderly neighbor's i know it
can't

music. i got the chills when i heard that, when we had passed. as we
walked
back to the porch of the house, the music started once again this time

 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Here&#8217;s
my story, and it&#8217;s true. When
I was 17 I was in a car accident and bled so much that by the time the
paramedics got there, I had bleed to death, no heart beat, lips turning
blue,
cold to the touch, the whole 9 yards... One paramedic wanted to try and
revive
me with electric shock, the other paramedic said it was too late and it
wouldn't work. Luckily the one who wanted to revive me won the
argument. They
got a pulse the second time they shocked me and rushed me to the
hospital. I
was in a coma for over a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a
near death experience that I believe was real. Here's what I remember
immediately after the car wreck... I was on my way to my mom's house
when I got
in the accident. After the accident, I remember walking through my
mom's front
gate and approaching the front door. I wanted to knock, but couldn't
for some
reason. I tried a few more times walking up to her door to knock, but I
couldn't knock on the door, or even figure out why I couldn't knock, so
I just
gave up and went away... The next thing I remember is being in what I
can only
describe as a place without 3 dimensions or time. I was somewhere, but
ten
miles away and two feet away seemed like the same distance. And there
was this
eerie lack of time, I don't know if I was in this place for 1 minute or
three
days...There was no 'light' as we know it although I wouldn't call it
dark...Sorry, but trying to describe this to someone who has never seen
it for
themselves is like trying to describe the color green to someone who
was born
blind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know how long I was there,
like I said, there was no sense of time. But after a while I saw three
figures
in front of me. They didn't look like angles or demons, more like
silhouettes
of sexless naked human forms made of pure light, with auras around them
also
made of light. At first they didn't talk, then, the one in the middle
said,
"Why are you hear?" I've always been a smart ass in life, and I guess
death doesn't change that aspect of your personality, because I
replied,
"BECAUSE I'M DEAD!" I knew the three beings were talking amongst
themselves, although I couldn't hear them talking so much as feel them
talking.
Finally, the one in the middle said. "You have to go back." All of
the sudden I felt like I was being sucked butt first through a giant
vacuum
cleaner tube (Sorry, but that's what it felt like). The next thing I
remember
is a nurse screaming for a Doctor. A Doctor came in and stuck this
bright
little flashlight in my eyes. It hurt like hell, and I was trying to
tell him
to get that flashlight out of my eyes! I couldn't understand why I
couldn't
talk. It was because I had a tube stuck down my throat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a couple of really confusing days went
by they removed the tubes and I could talk.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now here's the part that freaked me out...My mom came to visit
me in the
hospital as soon as they would let her see me. We talked about what
happened,
and when I told her about the part where I was walking up to her front
door
trying to knock on the door, she turned white and I thought she was
going to
pass out. I asked her what was wrong and this is what she told me... On
the day
of the accident she started feeling weird, like something had happened
to me.
(I was going to surprise my mom by stopping by her house, so she had no
idea I
was on the way...). She was sitting in the living room looking out a
window
that showed a full view of the front sidewalk all the way to the front
door.
She said she saw me walking up the sidewalk to the front door 3 times,
but
every time she would get up to go open the door, no one was there.
That's when she
knew something had happened and started calling the police and the
hospitals.
When she first called the hospital I was in, they told her I wasn't
there. (I
wasn't carrying any ID when the car wreck happened, so they admitted me
to the
hospital as a "John Doe". The hospital didn't figure out until 2 days
later who I was, so the next time my mom called to see if I was there,
they
told her I was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had never been a
religious person, but after that experience I wanted to find out what
had
really happened to me and if anything like this had happened to other
people.
This was about the time the Internet was just getting started, so you
couldn't
just sit down and 'Google' stuff. So I spent years studying theosophy,
theology, parapsychology, and the occult looking for answers. I found
similar
cases from religious and non religious people alike, and the
similarities in
what they all saw was amazing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
experience didn't cause me to 'get religion' or anything. IMHO all
religions
are full of too many contradictions to be remotely believable. However,
the
experience I had was over 24 years ago, and as I'm writing this, I can
still
see the memories of what I saw then as clear as if it happened an hour
ago. The
place I was in was not heaven or hell. It felt more like a place
in-between
life and death. I never got all the way to the other side, so I have no
idea
what it&#8217;s like. But no matter what anyone tells me, there is something
after
death. I know, I was there. If you have any questions about my
experience, you
can contact me via e-mail. Thanks for reading this. Even after all
these years,
sometimes it feels better to talk about it once in a while.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I lived
in Negishi Housing from May
2003 - Jan 2005. within those years My wife and I had several
unexplained
incidents, to many to list, but here are a few. I lived on Negishi Dr.
within
the housing base. As you go through the middle gate, take the first
right. My
house was the only unit that sat backwards and below the street level.
I was
base security there and met numerous civilians who have been there for
years
and told me hundreds of stories about Negish, Ikego, and yokosuka. I
plan on
putting them all on this site eventually. But here is a few to start
off. 1st
experience:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I was sitting in my
living roomwatching TV, my wife was in the kitchen cleaning dishes, and
I had
just put my almost 2yr old daughter down for a nap. When I heard a
noticable
sound behind me. It sounded as though someone was drawing on a chalk
board. I
looked over and saw my 2yr old daughter drawing on the wall in red
crayon. At
first I was pissed, and walked over to her. She didn't pay any
attention to me.
I shouted to get her attention while I was approaching her and she just
kept
drawing. Not until I grabed her shoulder did she look. She had a half
asleep
look on her face, and dropped the crayon. I looked at the wall and
there were 3
perfectly simetrical faces drawn on the wall. I can't draw this good,
never
mind a 2yr old that can't collor between the lines. The face on the
right was a
profile view of this<span style="">&nbsp; </span>really demonic
lokking man, the face on the left was the same man's face, as though he
was
looking straight ahead, but the picture in the middle was undoubtedly
the
eriest one. It was the same man looking straight ahead, but something
about it
felt like it was actually looking at me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Immediately I went to grab the camera, but when I returned I
found my
wife crying, on her knees, scrubbing the crayon off the wall. My
daughter went back
to her nap as quiet as could be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>2nd
experience: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>According the the
Japanese, if you have for example an entertainment center placed in the
corner
of your house at an angle with the actual corner of the room empty
behind it,
that is considered a "Dead Space". It supposedly attracts spirits. My
Daughter would go the the side of the entertainment center and talk to
the
corner for hours. She would not leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
would put Elmo on TV, give her a snack and she would take the snack,
bring it
to the corner and offer the corner portions of her snack. The
entertainment
center stayed in that corner for 3 days. 3rd experience: While some of
the base
contractors were at my house making a retaining wall in my back yard,
my wife
and my daughter went outside to give them some lemonade. In my backyard
we had
a bench sitting below the kitchen window. My daughter stood on the
bench looked
into the window and said "Oiday, oni-chun, ikoyko, asobo" Which in
japanese baby talk means Come outside friend (male) and play. There was
no one
in the house! 4th experience: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When
I first arrived in Japan, I co-worker of mine tried to scare me by
telling me
all these gohst stories about the bases. I didn't believe them at
first. One
was about two military police patrolmen that were patrolling Negishi
base on
foot in the summer of 2001, about 6 months before I got there. At that
time
Negishi Housing had no fencing around the base, so frequent checks
needed to be
conducted, especially of this one area the "hundred stairs".
Supposedly these two patrolmen walked down the hundred stairs at about
9pm to
check the area. When they got to the bottom they turned around, looked
up and
saw an old man sweeping the stairs. They walked back up the stairs and
proceeded to tell him that he was on base property and would have to
leave,
when one of them noticed that this guy had no legs from the knees down
and was
floating there. (yah yah yah I said) About a year later I was patroling
Negishi
base with a newly arrived partner. I told him the same story about the
hundred
stairs just tring to scare him. At about 230am we decided to conduct a
foot
patrol of the hundred stairs. Not beleiving in the story both of us
proceeded
to walk down the stairs. We walked out and around the block of the
queit
neghborhood, and then proceeded back to the stairs. Just before turning
the
corner to the stairs, we both hear a loud sweeping sound coming from
the
stairs. Felt like I was gonna pee my pants. With the only way back to
base
being a 3-4 mile walk around we built up the courage to turn the corner
to the
stairs. As we turned the he was a real person, we galloped past him and
up the
stairs. We must have ran those stairs in 5 seconds. When we got to the
top the
old man had disapeared. The only way he could have gotten out of our
sights
that fast is if he had jumped the railing about 20 ft down. At the top
of the
stairs we noticed a small graveyard next to the stairs on a cliff. Very
weird
spot for a graveyard. Never went back to the stairs again. More to
come................<o:p></o:p></span></p>

i was just laying on my bed
letting my mind drift when i saw a orb on top of my curtain rod. I
could see
through it. It slowly rose and drifted down to a painting and into it.
I knew i
had a spirit in my house because i could see it out of the corner of my
eye but
when i turned around it was gone. My girlfriend also said she would see
something as well. I prayed over the house and asked it to leave and
don't come
back. I also blessed the house door frames with Holy Oil. It never came
back.
It was my first incounter with a Orb. I have moved since. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
