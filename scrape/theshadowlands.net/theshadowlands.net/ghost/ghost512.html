Additional Info <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">While walking
through the
steel halls of the Hornet, there are many ghosts whom one may meet.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a ghost on the starboard side, who
has been confirmed to a 17 year old boy who died of fright.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, nearby in Junior Officers Berthing, on
bunk number 11, there is an angry spirit who disapproves of the use of
the
bunk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has been known to grab the
ankles of those who sleep on the bunk, as well as throw and destroy any
items
placed on the bunk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One ghost that I
have met personally was in Junior Officers Berthing, and it was the
outline of
a watchful man, who was standing near me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He did nothing, but just stared at me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I asked him to leave, so that I might wake up at a reasonable
hour to
start working, and he simply nodded and walked out through the solid
steel
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A note that should be made is that
at no point are any of the spirits on the USS Hornet dangerous.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>They are 18-21 year old men who were in the
navy at the time that they died.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
like to play tricks, and they like to learn more about what has
happened in the
world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, there is a ghost of
a man who will stand in the women's head, because women are an oddity
to him.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When he served, there were
no women on
board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another trickster is Steven.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Steven has been contacted several times, and
is known as the Ponytail Puller.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
women wear ponytails, they will often remove them before entering
Steven's
territory, for fear of contact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
no real harm done, but it is very shocking to be physically contacted
by a
spirit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of my encounters of that
sort was that once, while listening to the Ghost Stories that we tell
on the
Hornet, I could feel someone running their hands through my hair.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>To restate, none of the ghosts have dangerous
intents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I also worked at
St.
Elizabeth's hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What struck me as
odd was the fact that your story comes from 1987. I worked from mid-May
until
mid-September in THAT VERY YEAR as an intern for the Public Defender's
Service
of Washington D.C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was our job to
help those not wanting to be there to show mental fitness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our office was on the grounds in the original
cottage of the Medical Director from the days when the original "Center
Building" was in use. Look, all I can say is this: 1987 was before the
Internet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was before cable exploded
with shows like "Paranormal Activity", and I can tell you that they
actually warned us about the building.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our superiors couldn't stand going through that building, but
they had
to pretend that everything was alright so that it would be opened for
us daily.
You see, St. E's is several acres large with many, many old buildings.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>John Hinkley and the like are located on the
other side of a two lane hwy. That Center Building is no joke.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I described it to my husband over 20 years
ago and since as sounding like an active, fully functioning hospital.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The problem was that there was no one allowed
above the bottom floor lobbby. Even if you wanted to go up there, you
couldn't...it was chained off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bangs,
clangs, muffled voices, footsteps, were not just common, but they were
ever
present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd had my brushes with Ouija
boards, etc., but nothing freaked me out like the St. E's Center
Building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It got to the point where each
of my days
would end with me telling my friends the stories of what had happened
in the
Center Building that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know
if this is helpful or useful, but imagine this: anguished Civial War
veterans
found ways to kill themselves rather than tell their families they'd
ended up
at a mental institutions. Even if the soldier wasn't mentially ill he
might get
sent there for treatment in those days.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ice pick lobotomies were common there in the day, and it was
rumored
that the rape from the Nightmare on Elm Street films was copied from a
story
out of St. E's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All and all it's just a
freaky place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hope this helps. Feel
free to write back with questions. You can verify my employment there
quite
easily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a government employee.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Thanks for reading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Corrections and a
Plea for your Opinion<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>gay.joey@rocketmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I lived in
Mansfield, PA, for
a very large chunk of my life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My family
can account for four generations of students at Mansfield State
College, now Mansfield
University of PA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At no time, ever, did
any student fall, jump, or get pushed in North Hall resulting in
her/their
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>North Hall was originally built
in four wings, like a giant plus sign, and the common area (the center
of the
plus sign) on each floor is known as "the well".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stories
go that at one time the well was open
from top to bottom, and some female student fell screaming to her death
after
drama about an ex-boyfriend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The problem
with the story is that the well was never open.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even during and before my grandmother's time (she graduated in
1919 - I
have her class ring!) each floor consisted of four halls extending from
this
large central common/social area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In my
days as a student -- 1971-74 - the vending machines were there and any
student
needing to use an electric typewriter, hair dryer, or other appliance
had to do
it there because the wiring in the halls/bedrooms was so old and so bad
that
fuses blew if the rules were disobeyed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My grandmother lived in Mansfield from 1902 to 1993 and boarded
students
in her home for over 50 years,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and until
her death there was never any such death in or around the entire
campus, let
alone North Hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, during my
student days I was involved with campus security and there were plenty
of horror
stories about things looking in from outside the windows, even on
floors that
the local volunteer fire dept. couldn't reach with a hook and ladder
truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of the stories that I ever
investigated turned out to be freshman girls with too much alcohol or
other
things in their systems looking at their own reflections in old, wavy,
pitted
window glass original to the building.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(About 1850?)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Try it sometime -
wrap a white towel around your head, take off other visible clothing,
and look
out one of those ancient windows with only a faint light behind you.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>That "disembodied white thing"
visible in the glass will scare the mess slap out of you!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was almost a believer the first time I saw
it, and I don't even do alcohol or strange substances.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But a big, bright "coon hunter's"
flashlight and The Lord's Prayer have debunked a whole lot of ghost
stories.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Check
out Hartsville, SC, on your states page.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Prospect United Methodist Church is about two miles from my
house and I
pass it every day on my way home from school.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(I'm a teacher at Hartsville High School.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There's
a blurb on your page about
"things in the woods" behind the church and a figure allegedly
fighting the devil in the window which observers are supposed to locate.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked my neighbor about it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She has lived in the neighborhood for 60
years or so, and she said that a whole herd of stories about fighting
the
devil, zombies walking in the adjoining churchyard, "things" in the
woods along Cedar Creek behind the church, etc. etc. were started by
guys
running stills along the creekbed during Prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There are quite a few springs (and quicksand
beds) along the creek, and lots of underbrush and trees, which provided
a ready
water supply and fuel supply for the whiskey distillers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The best way to keep neighborhood kids away
was to tell them scary stories, and then scare them badly a couple of
times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It worked so well that people
still won't go around there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That being
said, there is one location that I have never been able to explain.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>For seven years my husband and I lived on
property (then) owned by his cousin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
house had been a school about a hundred years ago, and only had three
rooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the day we moved in I hated
the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I rearranged the kitchen
furniture because when I washed dishes at the sink I had to stand with
my back
to the kitchen table and I sensed a man sitting there waiting for me to
pour
him more coffee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Numerous unexplained
things happened to my friends and relatives, and at times when my
husband was
away I would "hear" without sound a young man, possibly black, age 18
- 20, <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>telling
me that I needed to leave for a little
while because "something" was going to happen that I wouldn't
like.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every time that happened ( 4 or
5?) I went to my car and left, or at least sat in the car in the yard
until my
"companion" gave me the all-clear feeling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
had all kinds of experiences with things
disappearing and turning up in odd places.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My camera disappeared from my school bookbag, was gone for
almost a
year, and turned up in the refrigerator on top of the butter tub half
an hour
after I put the tub away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband
found it when he decided to steal one last biscuit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The film in it developed all black.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
could lie awake in bed (in room #2) and
hear a party going on in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>(you had to walk through the bedroom to get to either living
room or
kitchen) It was a real party, with cigarette smoke and ice cubes
clinking in
glasses, liquor, soft laughter and conversation. Smoking is not allowed
in our
home due to my husband's asthma and COPD - neither of us have ever
smoked or
used alcohol - so it wasn't our party, but it wasn't my imagination,
either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I took my flashlight into
the living room everything stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dead
silence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were unexplained drafts of
icy air, footsteps, and the place was always 20 degrees colder than
anywhere
else, in spite of a large gas heater.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our Chihuahuas hated the place even more than I did - barking at
things
we couldn't see or hear, trembling under their blankets, refusing to
enter or
leave rooms or get off our laps, etc. etc.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whatever infested that place really enjoyed tormenting the dogs.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I have seen glass doorknobs turn, shoved the
door open, and nobody was there but cold air.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As close as I ever got to solving the mystery was a story told
by an old
self-professed Klansman who claimed that at one time the house had been
a
private drinking establishment where black men and white women could
get
together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course the Klan took a dim
view of that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A bunch of Klansmen hid up
in the top of the house until the evening's entertainment was in full
swing,
then swarmed down into the living room and "broke up the party" with
clubs and guns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought he was just
running his mouth until he described the (unique) woodwork,
wainscoting,
moldings, floorboards, and location of the chimney and attic hatch down
to the
last detail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had to have been up
there to know how it was made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could I
have been communicating on some level with whatever told me to leave
those
times?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Please explain how I could
"just know" what he was saying when I had no desire to insert myself
into whatever was going on?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am a
believer, I guess, in the supernatural because other things have
happened to me
that I can't explain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I don't
understand this communication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hey there, I just
wanted to
send you an email saying I have been to this gravesite. I lived in
Diamond
Valley, and took frequent bike rides in the area.I stumbled upon this
grave and
the headstone had cherubs, a boy and a girl, adorning the sides. I had
an
uneasy feeling, a fear deep inside me, so I left my bike by the road,
walked up
to the fence surrounding the grave, and knelt to the ground. I prayed a
blessing to the child (I assumed it was a child, because I couldn't
make out
the engraving, but the two children on the sides made me think it was)
and her
family (I knew it was a her, but I don't know how). The uneasy feeling
left me,
and I biked away and remember feeling like other children were biking
with me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

hear without
a recorder. Fast moving shadows. Pots thrown. Numerous voices captured
on audio
from whispers, to radio type sounds, electronic voices and a human
voice of a
child. Smoke and smell of fire where there is none, during our
investigation
Finleys Bar offers. Not sure of the cost because my boyfriend paid for
the
non-refundable tickets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Friends told us
about their experiences on Finleys ghost tour so we chose the
investigation
hoping we would experience more. We did. It was amazing. The docents
Lisa and
Brian answered all our questions and as long as we didn't provoke we
could use
all of our equipment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon entering the
cottage it was ice cold like being under water in a lake type of cold.
The back
bedroom felt unwelcoming and made me uncomfortable, nauseated and
dizzy. I
don't know what that was about. Lisa used a laser grid which we saw
blocked as
though something walked by while we were asking questions. Really
bizarre was
hearing the blinds moving right when we turned our back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The bar is a little creepy and while we ate
before the tour started my hair was pulled which startled me. My
boyfriend felt
a freezing cold over his legs which I didn't at first then I too
experienced it
just before my hair was pulled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are
going back after the first of the year. We drove down from Inveness
which is
two and a half hour ride but it was worth it-ready to do it again.<span

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This isn't fiction,
this
isn't someone else's story, this is my story. There is a puzzle that
needs to be
solved in my present life, a link to the person who was me before I was
me. To
piece my past life together and find who murdered me I need your help.
I invite
you as a reader to roll up your sleeves get on your computer and search
with
me. I want you to go through obituaries, archives, court records and
news paper
articles to find my killer. This article is the first in series of
articles
about my murder! These are the facts: my name was Eleanor I was
murdered in
1942 by a jealous boyfriend. I had straight shoulder length red hair
parted on
the side. My eyes were blue and somewhat small. I was a young adult,
and a bit
overweight but not obese. My skin was fair. My nose was straight and
pointed.
My cheeks were full almost plump I had a strong chin, not a big chin a
distinct
chin. I was not beautiful or ugly I was average. I had the face of the
girl
next door, pleasant and friendly. How do I know these things? I spoke
with my
mother in my past life, she told me my name was Eleanor and my jealous
boyfriend killed me in 1942!Let me go back thirty years ago when linear
time
made sense to me and birth and death had a beginning and end. My
paranormal
journey started innocently enough, I fell off a horse and died. When I
came
back to physical reality I brought with me back psychic abilities. A
tug of war
in sued inside me as I struggled to make sense of my new found insights
into
the paranormal. What do you do when you can see spirits and
occasionally speak
with the dead? It is not exactly dinner conversation is it? To stay
sane I
channeled all my psychic experiences into three novels. I created
fictional
characters with my psychic abilities living in a pretend world with a
mystery
and a sense of humor thrown in for good measure<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As I wrote I refrained from reading about the paranormal because
I
didn't want to taint my stories, overlap them with other peoples'
experiences.
To keep myself psychically pure and my novels original I kept my mouth
shut and
worked alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In theory before 2008 I
accepted that reincarnation might be possible, my thoughts on the
subject we
limited because I didn't really care. I was doubtful anyone could
recall their
past lives and when someone claimed they were the reincarnation of so
and so I
assumed they were either a fraud or just crazy. I once joked to a
friend that
if I lived in Egypt two thousand years ago I wasn't Cleopatra I was her
maid. I
imagined when you are born we all started out in this life with a clean
slate
so to speak with no ecollection of who we were before we were born.
Twenty
years ago I met a young woman at a restaurant she was petite with red
hair and
blue eyes. When I saw to her I instantly thought of a character I would
write.
At the time I believed it was inspiration something a writer gets from
time to
time and nothing else. Why did I think my idea was snatched out of thin
air?
Why did I connect with the eye color and hair color of this girl and
not her as
a person? I didn't know the answer to those questions then but I do
now.I
started my third book &#8216;The Reincarnation Of Tess Hamilton&#8221; in 2007. It
is the
third novel in my series of books. For me to write any novel I need two
years
minimum. This books focus is on reincarnation. During the process of
writing my
latest novel I felt compulsive to describe my central character Abigail
Cantrell a certain way. She had to have blue eyes and red hair I
wouldn&#8217;t have
been possible to write her any other way. I am not plugging my books at
least
not in this article! What I am saying somehow my usual process in
creating a
character was sidetracked or I should say hijacked. Why my character
Abigail
Cantrell struck such a cord in me?To make a connection to the other
side I have
a routine, I practice a combination of meditation and guided questions.
Questions asked not to the living but to the dead. During my meditation
I posed
the question who was I before I was me. Nothing happened that afternoon
in
truth nothing usually takes place only once in a while do I get an
answer, when
I do it usually comes in sideways. I went to sleep that night almost
forgetting
what I had asked that afternoon. During my sleep I became aware, lucid
with all
my scenes heightened and a feeling of anticipation swept over me. I
wasn't in
the physical world anymore but my body was. Astral projection has
always been a
sensitive subject to me. To make it simple and short I detached from
body and
traveled to another plane of existence. I will elaborate more in the
next
article. I entered a place or I should say I was drawn to this place. I
met a
woman her face and shoulders were visible but not the rest of her body.
As for
her age she was over fifty. All I could make out was that she was a
heavy set
woman with brownish hair. When she spoke her voice felt sad. She said
"I
was your mother, your name was Eleanor, a jealous boyfriend murdered
you in
1942! For some odd reason I did not react, instead I felt a
disconnection from
the woman who bore me in a past life. I didn't get to ask questions
instead I
was pulled back to my physical body and the event was over. A day or
two later
I was standing in a swimming pool in the middle of the day minding my
own
business when a picture, that's the only name I can come up with to
describe it
was presented to me. The woman in the picture was me! The face I saw
was my own
when I was Eleanor! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I am not sure this
would
specifically count as a &#8220;ghost storey&#8221; per say but would fall into the
paranormal somewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I often wondered
if it would somehow count as &#8220;spiritual&#8221; as some people believe in
guardian
angles.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
I was about 10 years
old one of my favorite events of the year was the Jackson County Fair
in
Southern Indiana.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At this fair they
typically had various tractors and fair <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">equipment on
display not far
from the animal exhibits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
extremely excited because we did not farm and so the equipment was not
something I was around every day other then just seeing farmers use
them as we
would pass by the many fields in the area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was also excited to get to go pet various farm animals in the
animal
exhibits then get to the carnival rides. My mother allowed me to go
play for a
few minutes near the tractors with my cousins while she visited with
some peers
of hers that she had spotted and give me some time to use some of my
energy to
alleviate some of my impatience.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This is when the bizarre experience comes in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My cousins around my age and I were playing
and I wondered over to the farm equipment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I went up to what seemed like an enormous tractor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I do not recall what you call this type of
tractor but do remember it being a John Deere brand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This tractor had a cabin with steps that led
up to the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went up the steps and
tried the door and obviously it was locked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However I was able to climb around in areas of this tractor, on
the tire
area and behind it. Being very small for even a 10 year old I was able
to get
just about anywhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had not even
slightly occurred to me being a 10 year old boy to think of any
possible danger
with doing this.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While climbing on
the backside area of this tractor cab I slipped and fell.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was falling straight down toward the discs
attached to the tractor used to turn the soil in the fields.. I do not
remember
specific thoughts I was having as this was so quick other than the fear
one has
as they realize they are going to fall then I did fall.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You must keep in mind it takes several more
seconds to read this than the event occurring&#8230;.this all went down very
quickly.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
falling and still in
the air I felt a slight pressure and it seems like a blacked out state
occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I realized myself and
surroundings once again a few seconds later I was laying on the ground
about 15
or so feet away from the tractor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one
was near that particular area and gravity simply does not work quite
like that.
I was not injured, bruised, or hurting in any way.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I know this story is not really all that
sensational or entertaining but it happened to me and it is something I
can not
just explain away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I truly believe
something saved me that day and I have never forgotten the experience.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would welcome
any comments, questions,
or explainations from readers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My name is Maranda.
Just
wanted to share one of many ghostly stories (I'm not phsychic/not
medium). I
was living with my brother and his roommate in a triple wide mobile
home
(summer, 2002) in a neighborhood called Cove Orchard near Yamhill, OR. <span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Leaning on the back of a couch one
afternoon,
glancing at the TV, I happened to feel a squeeze on the front of my hip
which
of course startled me to spin around-no one there....huh, I thought,
must have
been a crease in my pants or something? I turn back around and no more
than 5
seconds later I get goosed (not on the cheek, if you know what I
mean...south
and bullseye!). Well, that (bizarre, in and of itself) marked a
definite
"deep seated" fear of being alone in the home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About
a month later, I was just beginning to
doze off (10pmish) as my brother walked down the hall past my open
bedroom
door. I happen to glance over and right next to me stands a black
shadow of a
very large man with a lightning outline all around his body. Needless
to say,
my flight instinct kicked in and I was out of my bed and running down
the hall
so fast I almost ran up my bros backside. As my nephews were on the
living room
couches possibly asleep, I tried to shrug this off. My brother was
like,
"What the....?" I talked to him about it later and he laughed at me
and said, "Oh, you saw the ghost."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>NOT funny, not haha...very bizarre. In relating this story with
my
nephews years later I discovered my experiences were nothing compared
to their
encounters as they grew up in that home; but thats for them to tell!
Was
looking at some of your web pics and I have a photo to send you that I
thought
was cig smoke but would like your professional opinion. Ectoplasm? It
was taken
at our employee party (Dec. 2003)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>at The
Ratskellar (a bar) in Government Camp, Oregon. I will send that
soon...have a
great day, don't work too hard. PS, wish I was your employee, sounds
like a fun
job...a humans final frontier- untapped, undiscovered!<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My daughter told me
to write
and tell you about my experience during vacation this past week. I
stayed at
the Days Inn in Summerton SC. The room I stayed in was 214. Every night
the TV would
turn on at 11:37 PM. There was no control for a timer and even the
sleep
setting did not work on the remote. This occurred from November 5th the
night
we checked through the night of November 11th, we checked on on the
12th. I
believe it was Thursday, I turned on the lights above the vanity and
the smoke
detector went off. I turned off the lights for a few minutes and turned
them
back on again and things were fine. Since I spent a week there, I
talked with a
couple of the desk clerks and learned more as time went along. Not sure
how
true it is. I asked if something had happened at the hotel and the one
clerk
indicated there was an incident, would not give details only to say
that it did
not happen at that part of the hotel. One clerk did say, after I waited
a few
days of this TV thing, that the room I was in and the one next door,
213, the
T's seem to have minds of their own. Another clerk who was on duty
while I was
talking to the first one, did mention that the hotel was built on a
cemetery
and that she was not sure if all the remains were relocated or just
those where
I95 went through. This clerk also said she refuses to enter any of the
rooms
because she say a woman's figure in one room and the cleaning lady
confirmed
her sighting by saying oh yeah that's my lady. The clerk described the
woman as
from the 1940's with a dress with the fancy brocade neckline and very
small
buttons. This clerk also made a comment that the Summerton Inn, which
is across
the road, is worse. One of the other guests I talked with who was
involved with
the same event I was said that her and her husband kept hearing like
someone
beating. She did not say if they were beating on something or someone.
That was
in room 109. Enjoy, Happy Ghost Hunting,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In 1988, we lived
in a house
that was gorgeous during the day but when night came, our comfort went
out the
door. At first we hardly noticed the strange things that happened but
it soon
became clear that we were not very welcome there. It wasn't a big
house; mom
and dad had their room, my sister had her room and I had mine. My room
was in
the back of the house. But no one and nothing bothered me.
Unfortunately, it
wasn't the same case for my sister, 2 years old at the time. She was
constantly
complaining about the man sitting on the warderobe. Of course we all
just
thought she was being silly. Then one night, she woke up screaming
bloody
terror - I think she'd woken the entire town with that bloodcurling
scream -
and so came the first of many times that I was to move into the
'haunted room'.
I'm not scared. Or that's what I thought. I saw the man sitting on the
warderobe that very first night and he was laughing. In South Africa we
have
this myth about the 'Tokkelozi' and most people were 'careful'. This
myth has
its roots in African culture and all the black people I had known when
I was
growing up, believed strongly in this 'Tokkelozi'. They actually placed
their
beds on bricks so the Tokkelozi couldn't reach them, (their claim was
that he
was somewhat of 2 feet tall). My upbringing brought me to believe that
ghosts
and mythical creatures (like the Tokkelozi) don't exist: I guess my
'upbringing' changed considerable when I was 8 because this little man
on the
warderobe wasn't real. He couldn't have been. How do 'real' things
disappear
anyway? I didn't mind the man on the warderobe because he simply
laughed at me.
Besides, if the Tokkelozi is so small, how did he get onto the
warderobe? With
his cackle and my girlish laughter - which later turned into mockery -
we had
an okay relationship, this ghost and I. Until he killed my dog. My
dog's name
was Cindy and I truly loved the little thingy she was. But the ghost
wanted to
get back at me and did so by - heaven knows why - having the dog sleep
on top
of front wheel of my dad's car. How she got up there, I don't know. The
dog
died and the next morning around 2am, I woke up. My hands were wet and
I didn't
understand from what. I hadn't been crying in my sleep. I switched the
light on
and found blood all over my hands and of course, my face. Touching my
face with
my wet hands had woken me. Maybe it was the symbolism behind the
situation, but
I was freaked out completely and thoroughly and behaved like only a
scared
child can; I screamed. It didn't help matters that at that time, there
was a
scratching sound at my bedroom window. My parents were also shocked by
this.Thou shalt not mock... Maybe my mind had shut down, but I hadn't
seen that
man on the warderobe again. And we moved out of that house.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be unfair if I should tell
everything else that had happened in that house, because it would be
second-hand accounts; I hadn't been present when the bride walked down
the
hallway and scared my dad wittless. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Sometime
in 1995, a friend of mine claimed to be psychic. I do believe in
ghosts. I <span style="">&nbsp;</span>had previously told my story of
the Mother and
Child and along with the ghost dogs some years after the situation with
the
blood on my hands, how can I not? Psychics on the other hand, are a
different
story altogether. I never believed a word that came out of his mouth.
Psychics
are <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">just people that
read people
very well and he wasn't going to get me to tell him about things that
he
thought I wanted to hear. He didn't get very far, everytime he tried.
But I guess
I invited the next incident in. This house we lived in - albeit just
for a few
months (we moved a lot) - also sported a ghost and I teased him about
the
ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So came the night he walked me
home. It was late, there wasn't a star in the sky and no moon. It was
pitchblack. Because of the late hour, my parents were already asleep
and there
was no light coming from the house. I lived in the back garden in this
small
room with a just-as-small yard of my own. Now with the psychic friend
walking
next to me, it being so damn dark and me being such a brat, I started
mocking
the ghost. I guess I shouldn't have... Psychic friend may have been
more looney
than I am, but he was a good friend. So, me scaring him was nothing
compared to
the fright I got when he seemingly walked into an invisible wall. And
then I
started laughing, because this was just so hilarious. Unfortunately, he
thought
I was possessed by the 'evil spirits' that roamed the night - or the
yard - or
just my little yard. Whichever way it was, he left at the speed of
light and I
never saw him again. His parting words will obviously haunt me forever
'mocking
supernatural beings will be the death of you'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although I live in a different country now and I am very much
alive, I
am still young and no one knows what tomorrow brings. I wouldn't want
his words
to come back and bite me in the butt, so I stopped mocking ghosts,
until 2008.
But I couldn't resist...I'll leave this incident for another time...;)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and I&#8217;m 28
now, but when i was 8 or 10 i woke up with a terrified feeling. About
that time
i felt something sit on the corner of my bed. Thinking that it was our
cat i
went to brush him away,but nothing was there. I quickly went to a fetal
position, and covered my head with my covers, and did not move until
morning.
That was in greenbrier ar at brietwood street.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">From 2004-2008,
besides
deployments to Iraq, I was stationed at Marine Corps Base, Camp
Lejeune, NC.
Occasionaly, I would get a phone call from my superviser later in the
evening
informing me, that someone left the lights on, down at the work bays,
and to
please swing by and turn them off. On my way back to the Barracks, I
would
swing by, unlock the gates, and drive my vehicle down to the bays,
where I
would exit my car, go inside and turn the lights off and close the
metal doors.
There was one time, I went inside the last bay, walked about 50 yards
into it,
to the control box, turned off the lights, and by the time, I was about
to
enter my vehicle, I would look back and see the main light on. I walked
back in
and turned it off for the second time, made sure all switches were off,
then
again returned to my vehicle, where i looked back, and saw the light
again was
on. I refused to turn those lights off any more. After leaving the
marines, I
had little paranormal activities, until I joined the army and went to
Germany.
In 2009, after completing law enforcment training, I was stationed in
Germany
from may 2009- May 2011. with one deployment to Afghanistan in between.
While
conducting Law enforcment, we would search various buildings, and
respond to
different calls. One call, was to a housing area, where a woman
reported
hearing her door open, foot steps entering, she would say something,
thinking
it was her spouse, and it wasnt, the footsteps would run out, door
would slam
shut. My partner and I got the call and headed over. In the 2 mins, it
took to
respond to the scene, the door again opened, foot steps were heard, the
woman
threatend the thing again, and same thing, foot steps ran out slamming
the
door. My partner and I Heard footsteps going towards the attic, running
quickly. I had him run to the front of the building to catch the
person, I ran
up the stairs, and started going through the attic. I started hearing
footsteps, in the dark attic, I pulled out my flashlight and pursued.
It always
seemed a distance in front of me, opening and closing the fire escape
doors in
front of me, I heard 2/3 doors open and close in the attic, that go to
the
stairwells and appartments. I heard the last open and close, so I
chased after
it, and again it always seemed 1 or 2 flights of stairs ahead of me,
until we
reached the bottom, where i threw open the door, and my partner looked
at me
and asked, "you see anything?" I was both confused and nervous, due
to i just chased it right to him, and he didnt see anything. I asked
him, if he
saw anybody run, he said only me. But he did say he saw my flashlight
moving
quickly in the attic windows, and was watching them, but no one came
out either
side, or front.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another night, I was at
a part of the base closed down. The part was abandoned but was still
our duty
place. We were outside the car smoking, with the street lights on,
around 9pm.
I was talking to my partner, when out of the shadows, I saw a figure of
a
person, walk out of the bushes, turn as if they saw us, and went behind
the
bushes. My partner and I gave pursuit, and came to the fence line with
no signs
of access. We pulled our flashlights, and proceeded to search the wood
lines,
where we found no evidence of anybody. We walked towards the school,
which had
been closed for a long time. From the outside of the school, we could
hear what
appeared to be quite talking, and strange lights, as if someone was
patroling
the hallways. We both turned off our lights, and could still here what
sounded
like shushing coming from the indside, and the lights disapeared down
the hall
ways. We checked all doors and windows, which were locked, this
confused us. We
called our supervisor to the scene, explained it, and he verifyied all
doors
and windows were locked. He checked the fence line, and wood line and
did not
see anything at all. Keep in mind, Baumholder , Germany has been known
as a
populated area since around 40 BC if not before, The SS under Adolf
Hitlers
order, turned Baumholder into a training camp for his soldiers from
1939-1945.
The French occupied Baumholder from 1945-1950 time frame, where we
occupied it
from then until currently<o:p></o:p></span></p>
