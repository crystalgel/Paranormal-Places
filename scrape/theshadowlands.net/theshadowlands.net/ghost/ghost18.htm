<P>
<P><B>Hi, I feel a little strange doing this...but...I guess I'm not the
only</B>
<P><B>one.  I know for a fact that it isn't just places that are haunted,</B>
<P><B>sometimes it's people too.  I'm 21 and I've had so many experiences
in</B>
<P><B>my life that it would literally take several hours to tell all of my</B>
<P><B>stories.  </B>
<P><B>	My scariest experience was a haunting that lasted just under a year.
 I</B>
<P><B>was followed constantly by at least two spirits.  They were very</B>
<P><B>powerful and very frightening.  I don't like to talk about this</B>
<P><B>experience because I am afraid that it will give them power to come</B>
<P><B>back, but I will tell you of three things that happened during this</B>
<P><B>time.  </B>
<P><B>	The first thing that they liked to do was turn my tv set on and off
and</B>
<P><B>change the channel and raise and lower the volume.  Many people saw
this</B>
<P><B>happen and we tried to find some sort of connection.  I think that
it is</B>
<P><B>possible that the strange happenings had something to do with a penny</B>
<P><B>jar we kept because every time we took the pennies out to count them,</B>
<P><B>the tv would act up, but I don't have the scientific knowledge to say
if</B>
<P><B>that's possible.</B>
<P><B>	These spirits seemed to be especially drawn to me whenever my
boyfriend</B>
<P><B>was around.  We both experienced things separately, but together it
was</B>
<P><B>an almost constant feeling that we were not alone.  After we broke
up,</B>
<P><B>the hauntings stopped and when I ran into him 6 months later we
talked</B>
<P><B>about the absence of "our ghosts" over coffee and the coffee cup slid</B>
<P><B>across the table.</B>
<P><B>	The other two experiences I want to tell you about happened with Ross.
</B>
<P><B>One night we were in bed and the lights turned on.  We got up,
checked</B>
<P><B>the door to see if it was locked, walked around the house to see if
any</B>
<P><B>other lights were on (which they weren't) and finally went back to
the</B>
<P><B>bedroom and had a smoke.  After about 15 minutes the lights turned
back</B>
<P><B>off.  I said thankyou and they promptly turned back on, then off
again.</B>
<P><B>	The other experience that was interesting occurred one night when
Ross</B>
<P><B>was at his parent's house about 40 minutes away.  I awoke at 4am to
find</B>
<P><B>my bed was levitating.  As I opened my eyes, the bed fell to the
ground</B>
<P><B>gently.  I couldn't go back to sleep so I wandered around the house</B>
<P><B>wishing Ross was there with me.  At 6am he called me (this guy NEVER</B>
<P><B>awoke before noon) to tell me that he had walked and  hitchhiked most
of</B>
<P><B>the way, but he needed me to pick him up for the final few
kilometres.</B>
<P><B>	There were many other things that happened during this time and yet
for</B>
<P><B>a while I tried to convince myself that it wasn't true.  I even wrote
an</B>
<P><B>English exam one year that focused on not believing in spirits. --the</B>
<P><B>exam went missing!</B>

<H3><A NAME=another>Another Family Story</A>
</H3><P><B>by shalane@erols.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Maybe it's just that my family's Irish or that we have memories like</B>
<P><B>elephants, but at this year's family Christmas party, the talk</B>
<P><B>ultimately turned to ghosts that the family has experienced.  My Aunt</B>
<P><B>Linda chuckled over her ghost being on 'the web' and my mother acted
a</B>
<P><B>little proud and embarrassed to acknowledge Elizabeth.  But it was
my</B>
<P><B>father, of all people, the quietest out of all of us and the one who</B>
<P><B>usually scoffs at our 'ghost prattle', that came out with a story
that</B>
<P><B>confused and intrigued even us.</B>
<P>
<P><B>He began with, "Well, I was little, and staying with my grandfather
at</B>
<P><B>their old farmhouse just outside of Philadelphia.  My older brother,</B>
<P><B>Bobby and I would sleep in a little room that used to be our father's</B>
<P><B>before he moved out.</B>
<P>
<P><B>"Well, one night Bobby and I had been out playing all day and were
a</B>
<P><B>little more excited than we should have been to sleep.  To tire</B>
<P><B>ourselves out, we started wrestling and finally gave up on that when</B>
<P><B>granddad yelled at us that we were makin' too much noise.  Well, we
took</B>
<P><B>to tellin' each other ghost stories, like boys will do to scare each</B>
<P><B>other and see who's the bravest.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>"Bobby was in the middle of a tale and suddenly the bed started
shaking</B>
<P><B>something awful, and on a hardwood floor, it makes a hell of a lot
of</B>
<P><B>noise.  Once the bed stopped shaking, we began to hear something over</B>
<P><B>near one of the corners whispering incoherently and in a strange</B>
<P><B>language.</B>
<P>
<P><B>"Not thinking that there might have been something under the bed
making</B>
<P><B>it move that way, we both crawled under the bed and huddled together,</B>
<P><B>waiting for granddad to come rescue us.  Certainly he would be up
after</B>
<P><B>us after all the noise the bed made banging on the floor.</B>
<P>
<P><B>"After several minutes, however, it became apparent that granddad
just</B>
<P><B>wasn't coming and we climbed back onto the bed, pulling the covers
over</B>
<P><B>our heads and holding each other, shaking until dawn broke, still</B>
<P><B>finding both of us awake.</B>
<P>
<P><B>"That morning, at breakfast, we both recounted the story to a
skeptical</B>
<P><B>grandmama and an amused granddad.  Granddad finally said we both
must've</B>
<P><B>been asleep or one of us was snoring, because he would have heard if
the</B>
<P><B>bed had made that much noise.  The only sound he'd heard out of us
last</B>
<P><B>night was when one of us fell out of bed while wrestling."</B>
<P>
<P><B>He shrugged amidst grins and everyone nodded, ackowledging his story
as</B>
<P><B>the gospel and another person took his turn.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Frankly, it was a story I'd never heard from him and was glad he
spoke</B>
<P><B>up to say he believed despite all his scoffing....</B>

<H3><A NAME="over me">Father Watching Over Me</A>
</H3><P><B>by rerah@sprynet.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello,</B>
<P><B>	A guy my mom works noticed that my mom seemed troubled. She replyed,
</B>
<P><B>telling him that she has been seeing a white figure in the corner of
her eye </B>
<P><B>when she'd walk past my room. (I'm 17 years old </B>
<P><B>so I do live at home) This guy, the one my mom works </B>
<P><B>with, I guess just out of no where, desciribed my father to a T, what
he looked </B>
<P><B>like, build, and that he died a horrible death. Which he did, drunk
driving, so </B>
<P><B>bad they don't know who drove the car. He also said(the guy) that he
is there to </B>
<P><B>watch over me. I'm really skeptic about the guy, but not my father.</B>
<P><B>     After my mother told me that, I have started realize that some
sort of </B>
<P><B>being was there. I'll past up my room, usually, Sunday or Monday nights
when I </B>
<P><B>go into my mom's room, I'll see something. 4 nights ago and especially
last </B>
<P><B>night really convinced me. 4 </B>
<P><B>nights ago I was trying to go to sleep when this chill of air got to
me. I was </B>
<P><B>rapped in my blankets but this chill would not go away. I eventually
went to </B>
<P><B>sleep.</B>
<P><B>	Last night was strange. I was sitting with my cigarette in my left
hand </B>
<P><B>looking at my Life of Agony tape cover. Out of the corner of my eye
I saw </B>
<P><B>something white. As I turned to my right and there was this white thing.
Looked </B>
<P><B>like smoke but it couldn't have been, the cigarette was my other hand.
I stared </B>
<P><B>at it until it disappered, and when it faded, it was in the shape of
a hand. I </B>
<P><B>got cold but still continued with what I was doing.</B>
<P><B>	Another weird thing is these 3 dreams I have had. My really close
friend </B>
<P><B>Josh died 2 years ago.</B>
<P><B>We only knew each other for 3-4 months but there was just this strange
bond. In </B>
<P><B>these dreams he has been in. Of course they came after his death, but
what they </B>
<P><B>mean, I don't know. The first dream happened about 1-2 months after
his death. </B>
<P><B>We are at this party and I see him sitting on a skateboard. When I
approach him </B>
<P><B>his eyes are blank and black. No iris or cornea or white, just black.
That </B>
<P><B>figure frightened me and still does.</B>
<P><B>	This past summer I was staying at a friend house in Carbondale, Il.
The </B>
<P><B>night before my friend and I went to sleep, we sat up and told her
the dream I </B>
<P><B>had before about Josh. That night in my dream, he shows up at my house
and we </B>
<P><B>talk. He starts to cry and asks if I ever cared about him. I say yes
and cry </B>
<P><B>also. He then gets up and leaves saying he will see me again.</B>
<P><B>	The last dream took place with me and 3 other friends at a cook out
when </B>
<P><B>a tornado hits. We run in the basement and I run to the south end if
the room. </B>
<P><B>As I'm there I hear Josh telling me come under the stairway. Just I
reach the </B>
<P><B>stairs the roof is torn of the house and the storm passes. He said
that he never </B>
<P><B>meant to hurt me and that I have to understand he is gone but we will
see each </B>
<P><B>other again. I woke up right after that. The strange thing was I had
a bad crush </B>
<P><B>on Josh and I never told anyone until after he died. It's like he found
out or </B>
<P><B>always knew.</B>
<P><B>	I want to know if you can help me understand </B>
<P><B>the guy my mom works with (if that is a crock and I'm just going crazy
thinking </B>
<P><B>my Dad is watching every move I make or this is possible) And if you
can tell me </B>
<P><B>if my friend that I still think fond of I trying to contact me beyond.
I never </B>
<P><B>told anyone this information and after I read a bunch of the
entries(including </B>
<P><B>yours) I figured I'd have someone that can help me understand what
is going on. </B>

<H3><A NAME=grandfather>My Grandfather..</A>
</H3><P><B>by clacount@nyx.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Years back, in the 1940's I believe, my grandfather, my fathers, and
my</B>
<P><B>uncles built out family's "cottage." A couple of years later my</B>
<P><B>grandfather built a small shed located about 75 yards from the actual</B>
<P><B>cottage. This building had electricity and such that my grandfather</B>
<P><B>wired himself. A couple of years back my grandfather died rather</B>
<P><B>suddenly. It didn't come as much of a shock to the family, and we
more</B>
<P><B>or less took it in stride. </B>
<P>
<P><B>As a little side note, the cottage was my grandfather's favorite
place</B>
<P><B>to be. There was nothing that he loved better than to do work around
the</B>
<P><B>cottage, be it raking leaves, or fixing various things around the place.
</B>
<P>
<P><B>About a year after my grandfather's death, I began getting into
music,</B>
<P><B>playing the guitar myself. My parent spent a great deal of time at
the</B>
<P><B>cottage in the summer, and being too young to look after myself</B>
<P><B>competently, they brought me to the cottage with them. So that I
wasn't</B>
<P><B>too bored I brought my amplifier and guitar to the cottage. My parent</B>
<P><B>located me and my equipment in this small outbuilding. The problem
was</B>
<P><B>that we couldn't get power out there. My father is an electrical</B>
<P><B>technician and he traced the wires into the peaked roof of this</B>
<P><B>outbuilding. It was at this point that we found there was a fuse box
in</B>
<P><B>the outbuilding. There was a throw switch on the fuse box that was
in</B>
<P><B>the off position. Nobody in out entire family knew about this switch
box</B>
<P><B>until then. We proceeded to turn the switch box on. Things went
normally</B>
<P><B>for that entire summer. </B>
<P>
<P><B>The following summer I decided to bring my amplifier and guitar to
the</B>
<P><B>cottage again. And again, to our surprise, the switch on the fuse box</B>
<P><B>was in the off position. Nobody had touched it, and the cottage had
been</B>
<P><B>vacant for the entire winter. We turned the switch on again and
things</B>
<P><B>went normally.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Once again, the following summer, although I didn't bring my amp or</B>
<P><B>guitar to the cottage, I checked the switch and once again, it was
off. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Although I never did "see" a ghost, it seems that the ghost of my</B>
<P><B>grandfather (the only person who knew of the switch) has been playing</B>
<P><B>some games with us.</B>

<H3><A NAME=shadow>The Shadow</A>
</H3><P><B>by selene@hem.passagen.se </B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm a 16-year-old girl from Sweden, and I've seen things that no one
has</B>
<P><B>ever believed. People have been calling me a story-teller and a liar,
but I</B>
<P><B>swear, the "story" I'm about to tell is absolutely true!</B>
<P><B>When I was about 7 years old, my family and I lived on an old
graveyard</B>
<P><B>from the time when vikings still ruled in Europe. Well, we lived in
a row</B>
<P><B>house with two floors, I slept on the second one. My room was small,
and</B>
<P><B>faced the small street outside. The street was too small for vehicles,
only</B>
<P><B>pedestrians and cyclists could move there.</B>
<P><B>Anyhow. I always slept with my door opened just a little, and with
a lamp</B>
<P><B>switched on in the window. One night I suddenly woke up, I don't know
why.</B>
<P><B>I lied in my bed and tried to go back to sleep, when something
suddenly</B>
<P><B>caught my eye. It was a shadow! When I say shadow, I don't mean one
of</B>
<P><B>those regular ones, no, this one had the shape of a fullgrown man,
but it</B>
<P><B>didn't have a body! The shadow went into my room from the opening in
the</B>
<P><B>door, and slowly went towards my bed (following the wall). I closed
my eyes</B>
<P><B>and hoped that it would disappear when I opened them again, but once
I had</B>
<P><B>opened them, the shadow was still there. I cried out to myself "there
are</B>
<P><B>no ghosts, there are no ghosts" (cause a book for children had told
me that</B>
<P><B>that was the way to get rid of them), but still the shadow came closer
and</B>
<P><B>closer. I pinched myself in my arm, hoping I was only dreaming, but
I</B>
<P><B>wasn't (and my arm started to ache badly). When the shadow reached
my</B>
<P><B>pillow, it just disappeared.</B>
<P><B>I have gone through the happenings in my head over and over again,
but I</B>
<P><B>still can't figure out just what it was that visited me that night.
It</B>
<P><B>wasn't a shadow from the street, since no cars could send out any
lights</B>
<P><B>(besides I had my curtains down). It wasn't anyone in my family, cause
I</B>
<P><B>asked them about it in the morning, and they thought that I had gone
mad or</B>
<P><B>that I had made it all up in my mind. My evidence was my arm, it was
still</B>
<P><B>aching. </B>
<P><B>The shadow never came back, but other things happened. Like once a
painting</B>
<P><B>fell down to the floor without a reason, doors have opened themselves,
I've</B>
<P><B>heard footsteps when no one else but me have been at home...</B>
<P><B>Tell me, what was it? Can anyone give me an answer?</B>

<H3><A NAME=wal-mart>Wal-Mart</A>
</H3><P><B>by rbrecken@cswnet.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am a 14 male who lives in Newport, Arkansas.  My mom and I was in</B>
<P><B>Batesville, AR at the Wal-Mart supercenter.  While in the Wal-Mart,
I had</B>
<P><B>to go to the restroom so I proceeded to the back of the store.  While
I was</B>
<P><B>in the restroom doing my buisiness i heard some tapping on inside one
of</B>
<P><B>the stalls or maybe in the wall or womens restroom.  After I listened
for a</B>
<P><B>few more seconds I knew it was coming out of a stall.  I listened
closely</B>
<P><B>and heard what it was tapping.  bam bam bam baaam baaam baaam bam bam
bam.</B>
<P><B>It sounded like the morse code for S.O.S {  . . . - - - . . .   } 
It kept</B>
<P><B>doing it over and over.  On the wall infront of me I raised my fist
and hit</B>
<P><B>out the first 3 dots and one dash when someting hit the stall side
hard.  I</B>
<P><B>was not in a stall so it did not scare me at first.  After I zipped
my</B>
<P><B>pants I looked under each stall to see if any one was in one.  After
I</B>
<P><B>would look under one I would open the stall door.  There was no one
in any</B>
<P><B>of the stalls.  I was getting really nervouse at the time.  I hurried
to</B>
<P><B>get to the door when out of the corner of my I saw something in the
mirror.</B>
<P><B> I turned quickly.  It was a teenager standing motionless.  It had
on a</B>
<P><B>some tight faded blue jeans and a red and white wide striped shirt.
I</B>
<P><B>turned around and he wasn't there, turned back around and he was still
in</B>
<P><B>the same motionless position. I ran out of there as fast as I could.
 At</B>
<P><B>that time I was 13 years old,  It had been a year since that had
happed,</B>
<P><B>every time I got back to that Wal-Mart I stay away from that area of
the</B>
<P><B>store.  So I havn't seen it again.  </B>
<P><B>The only people to believe me are my Mother, my best friend Cary
Campbell,</B>
<P><B>and a woman that works there I almost knocked down while running out.
 </B>
<P><B>This is not a false story, I get shills just bye closing my eyes and</B>
<P><B>thinking about it.  I am having weird fealings right now, because I
am</B>
<P><B>thinking hard about it. </B>

<H3><A NAME="our old home">Our Old Home</A>
</H3><P><B>by Klinger999@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was in fifth grade, we moved into a 80 year old house in Rockwall,
Texas.  The house was built on an Indian burial ground.  My brother used
to enjoy playing under the house where he had found alot of surprises and
sunken graves.  The original owners of the home were still talked about
occasionally around town.  The father was a doctor and had owned the first
car in town and the mother was remembered as a wonderful piano player.  The
piano that she owned had stayed with the house through the different owners
over the years. </B>
<P><B>One day I was waiting on my grandparents to arrive in town.  I heard
someone running down the stairs and heard the door behind me slam (as if
they were coming into the same room I was in).  I turned around, thinking
my brother must have gotten home and no one was there.  I ran out of the
house to my friend's house next door.  When my friend and I came back, we
heard steps running across the sidewalk near us.  Needless to say, we ran
back to her house as fast as our legs could carry us.  There were quite a
few little episodes like that one.</B>
<P><B>The most unforgettable episode was a night when my dad was out of town.
 A friend was staying the night and we were in my bedroom.  My mother came
into the room and asked if we'd been downstairs playing with the piano. 
We hadn't.  She checked on my brother and he was sound asleep.  She called
us out into the hall and we sat at the head of the stairs and could hear
the piano playing clear as a bell downstairs.  My mom grabbed the baseball
bat and headed down.  As soon as she got to the bottom of the stairs, the
piano stopped playing.  She searched the house and found nothing.  Right
as she got back to the top of the stairs, it started again.  Sarah (my friend)
and I could hear it as well.  Back down my mom went and once again, it stopped
when she reached the bottom of the stairs and she found nothing.  That was
all for that night.</B>
<P><B>I'll always believe we had a friend living with us in that house (possibly
more than one).  It was a beautiful old home and I'm sure whoever is living
there now is having a very interesting time of it. </B>

<H3><A NAME=great>Great-Grandfather's House</A>
</H3><P><B>by wesleyan@rmh.edu </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was in college in Rock Hill SC, (Winthrop University) I lived
in the</B>
<P><B>     house that was built by my great-grandfather in 1915. He had died
there in</B>
<P><B>     the 40's and my great-grandmother lived there until her death
in 1978.  She</B>
<P><B>     was quite fond of me. I was her 1st great-grandchild and was named
after</B>
<P><B>     her husband (he was Wes Anderson too).   The house was a two story
</B>
<P><B>     victorian style hidden from the road by  two huge, drooping oak
trees.</B>
<P><B>     After Jinks died (Jinks was a nickname my great-grandmother aquired
in</B>
<P><B>     childhood on acount of her name having been Annie Lucky, it stuck
for a</B>
<P><B>     lifetime) anyhow, after she died, my grandfather (her son) divided
the</B>
<P><B>     house into 3 large apartments to rent to college students. The
house was</B>
<P><B>     situated only about 3 blocks from the main campus at 232 Oakland
Ave. When</B>
<P><B>     my turn came to go to school, I naturally took up residence in
the upstairs</B>
<P><B>     apartment. I had two roomates  and the two apartments downstairs
each had</B>
<P><B>     two residents.  after a couple of months my roomates aproached
me with some</B>
<P><B>     strange experiences they had had. It seems that some nights they
would</B>
<P><B>     awaken to the feeling that they were not alone in the room. The
feeling was</B>
<P><B>     quite overwhelming and, despite investigating, they found nothing.
I</B>
<P><B>     admitted to having had the same feeling but we attributed it to
the old and</B>
<P><B>     rather spooky nature of the house itself. However, other residents
of the</B>
<P><B>     house, with whom we were only passingly aquainted, universally
reported the</B>
<P><B>     same feeling. One would be awakened from a dead sleep to the
undeniable</B>
<P><B>     feeling that someone else was in the room. Attributing the feeling
to the</B>
<P><B>     old house was not enough for one of my roomates (Paul Inuario
from</B>
<P><B>     Greenville) who was so disturbed by this phenomenon, he packed
up his</B>
<P><B>     belongings and moved in with his girlfriend. A few weeks later
a girl who</B>
<P><B>     lived in one of the downstairs apts. became so frightened by this
useen</B>
<P><B>     presence that she abruptly moved out as well. I was unsettled
by this also</B>
<P><B>     but after all, if there was a spirit in the house, it must be
a member of</B>
<P><B>     my own family! Those of us who remained in the house continued
about our</B>
<P><B>     business clinging to the sentiment that the unseen presence must
be some</B>
<P><B>     collective psycological phenomenon brought on by living in an
old house.</B>
<P><B>     This was the situation  until early one morning about May 1990.
</B>
<P><B>          I had just begun summer school at Winthrop in an attempt
to finally</B>
<P><B>     graduate and was heading out the door to an 8:00 am class.  I
was coming</B>
<P><B>     down the exterior stairs of our apartment which led to the driveway
beside</B>
<P><B>     the house when I was met by the girl who lived in one of the
downstairs</B>
<P><B>     apartments. Beth was an art student at Winthrop and I barely knew
her. This</B>
<P><B>     morning she was visibly distraught and had obviously been waiting
outside</B>
<P><B>     on the front porch for me to come down. When she gathered her
composure she</B>
<P><B>     relayed to me a most frightening yarn. </B>
<P><B>          The night before she had been reading in her bed quite late
and</B>
<P><B>     petting her cat which was laying on the bed beside her. At some
instant the</B>
<P><B>     cat went rigid and began to hiss at something across the room.
Beth put</B>
<P><B>     down her book and looked up to see, to her utter shock, the etherial
form</B>
<P><B>     of a tiny old woman sitting in a chair about 10 feet from her.
She stared</B>
<P><B>     in horror for a few seconds when the from disapeared into thin
air. She</B>
<P><B>     immediately rose, dressed hurredly and spent the remainder of
the night on</B>
<P><B>     the front porch! Her artsy nature and her strange clothing style
caused me</B>
<P><B>     at first to write off her story to drugs, alcohol, wierdness or
some</B>
<P><B>     mixture thereof. I reasured her as best I could and continued
to class.</B>
<P><B>     Later that day I was at the house of my father (also in Rock Hill)
and I</B>
<P><B>     told him Beth's story. My father is more disposed than I was to
believing</B>
<P><B>     in such things and asked if I would introduce him to Beth. Jinks
was his</B>
<P><B>     grandmother and they were very close. I called her from his house
and I</B>
<P><B>     believe that she agreed to see him only because he owned the house
she</B>
<P><B>     counted on for shelter. We arranged a meeting for that very evening.
Before</B>
<P><B>     we left my father pocketed a clear picture of Jinks to show Beth.
When we</B>
<P><B>     arrived at the old house Beth was still a bit uneasy. She repeated
the</B>
<P><B>     story for my dad who then asked if she would look at Jinks' picture.
She</B>
<P><B>     reluctantly agreed. When he held it out to her she regarded it
for all of</B>
<P><B>    two seconds when tears welled up in her eyes and she wilted into
a nearby</B>
<P><B>     chair, after pushing the picture out of her sight. No professional
actor</B>
<P><B>     could have simulated the terror we saw on that girl's face when
she was</B>
<P><B>     confronted with the living image of the figure she had seen the
night</B>
<P><B>     before. When we calmed her my father wanted to see the spot where
she had</B>
<P><B>     seen the apparition. I was stunned but not overly suprised when
the bedroom</B>
<P><B>     she indicated had belonged to Jinks in life and was the very room
in which</B>
<P><B>     she drew her final breath! Before the sun had set on the following
day,</B>
<P><B>     Beth moved out of our old house and would never set foot in it
again. </B>
<P><B>          A couple of months later I graduated from school and left
232 Oakland</B>
<P><B>     Avenue myself. The events of that day, coupled with my own
expreiences</B>
<P><B>     prior, created one more firm believer in the supernatural.</B>

<H3><A NAME="high school">The High School</A>
</H3><P><B>by Burgermcc@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>The following is a compiled list of the many rumors that conserned
the old high school from my friend's town.  My friend spent his childhood
in upstate Maine.  The high school he went to was know for being haunted.
 The story began when a senior wrote a play for the drama club.  The boy
directed and starred in the play.  This put him under alot of stress.  THe
night before the play opened the boy showed up and demanded that the janitor
let him into the auditorium.  Since he was an honor student the janitor told
him he could use the auditorium for two hours, which was just enough time
to go through the whole play.  After two hours the janitor returned and found
the stage lights on but the boy wasn't there.  No one ever saw the boy again.
 Regardless, the play went on and was aclaimed by the newspapers as greatly
written.  </B>
<P><B>     Ever since that day the school was plagued with unexplainable
occurances.  Entire rows of lockers would be found open wide on some mornings.
 Lights would be seen on at odd times of the night.  The parking lot gate
would close in the middle of the day.  Books in the library would be mixed
up and trays from the cafateria were found stacked on the tables.  Sighting
would occur on the nights of rehersals, and plays.  People would swear they
saw a young man staring out the class room windows or walking across the
darkened gym.  Several years ago the school was found to be too old and was
demolished so that a new school could be built.  That's when my friend moved
away.  From what his friends told him there were no further occurances. 
</B>
<P><B>     I'm not sure if the stories are true but my friend is very
creditable.</B>

</H3><P><B>by &nbsp;Waaden01@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>It all began in the summer of 1975 while my ship was undergoing an
overhaul at the Long Beach Naval Station.  I was sent TDY to the Galley or
Mess Hall there on base to serve my messcook duty. This was something that
all junior seaman have to do.  I was assigned to be the assistant to the
night cook.  The kitchen had four or five walk-in refrigerators and freezers.
 One of these freezers was broken and no longer used.  It was also locked
from the inside with a padlock and had not been used for sometime.  One day
at shift change when we were getting our instructions for the evening from
the chief petty officer we were standing in front of the locked freezer.
 At this time the door blew open with enough force to knock the three of
us off our feet.  We were unhurt but very surprised and shocked.  We were
unable to figure out why the door had opened given the circumstances but
went on about our business.  A few days later I watched as the door opened
its self again.  The door would eventually open by itself several times a
week. Occasionally the lids to the big cooking vats would close by themselves
also.  After two months I requested to be put on the day shift.  No one asked
why and I didn't say although the Chief Petty Officer suspected as much.
 Nothing more happened until the spring of 1980 when I got my own apartment
back in my home town.</B>
<P><B>     Things started to disappear and then appear several days later
in strange places.  One of the favorites was my keys.  They would disappear
after I had gone to bed and the show up again a couple of days later, usually
in my refrigerator.  One of my duties at my job was to stock the singles
in the soda cooler at the end of my shift.  This took about an hour to do.
 One night after doing this I went back into the cooler to turn off the light
and found all of the cans of soda pop that I had stocked removed from the
shelves and placed back in their flats,  Not more than five minutes had passed
since I had finished stocking.</B>
<P><B>    I have since gotten married and had children.  The incidents have
grown less and less frequent.  I attribute this to my wife losing her temper
and yelling at whatever it is to stop hiding things although it still likes
to hid my keys from time to time.  I can offer no explanation except that
I have aquired some sort of companion.</B>
