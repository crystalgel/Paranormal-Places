<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Mom's Haunted
House</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My lives in a 2 bedroom bungalow war time
home it is around
50 years old or so. As a child growing up in this home I have
experienced
things I could not explain. Things like the feeling of being watched
and the
feeling of dread every time I was in the basement. you see my brother
and I
shared a rumpus room as a bedroom. And would often here a lady
screaming and a
baby crying in the basement. This would go on nightly we often ran
crying to my
mom but she never believed us. The house had a real bad vibe to it that
we
could not explain, it was almost like the house was suffocating the
life out of
us. And it did when it came to my parents, they began fighting so bad
that
their relationship ended in divorce. I blamed the house, and the
dreaded feel I
often felt in it. My baby sister would have nightmares and often see a
man in
her room pointing a rifle at her. Just as she was a bought to scream
for my mom
it would vanish. She never saw this ghost again. I often saw black
shadows on
my bedroom, there was two of them and they would stand and stare at me.
Which
seemed like hours to me and then vanish, whatever they were they
haunted me for
years, and stopped when I was 16. When I was 16 my brother waentss
killed a
victim of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>hit and run. Shortly after his
death, my mother started to feel his presence and even credited him for
saving
her life. my mom was standing on a chair changing a light bulb, she
lost her
balance and felt a small set of hands on her legs. Those hands steady
her and
prevented her from falling and possibility breaking a leg or hip. On<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>another occasion my mom was washing the back
landing floor, and didn't realize that she was so close to the basement
stairs.
And she stood up she lost her balance and she was trying to regain her
balance
she felt a small set of hands on her bum push her back on to the
landing. My
mom would have died that day if she had fell down the stairs. Shortly
after my
grandma had died my mom was making her bed just as she went to fluff
her
pillows there was an indentation of a head on a unused pillow on her
bed. She
believes it was my grandma. Also my mom had these birds that chirp on
her
dresser when someone would walk by them. Every night these birds would
go off
the funny thing is no one was near them. Also my mom would come home
and hear a
male voice talking to her dog, the voice said nice honey which is the
dog's
name it was almost like a person was petting the dog. My mom thought
someone
had broken into her home<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a quick search
no one was there. Often the boarders who lived in the basement would
often
complain of having their arm grabbed in the middle of the night. They
have also
told my mom that she has a ghost of an old man in her basement. My mom
said she
never saw this ghost, or felt him. But my sister had reported while she
was
carrying a basket of laundry up the stairs, her son kept looking back
as if he
was being chase. We have no clue who is haunting her house. But we feel
2 we
know but who is this old man.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>New York Haunts</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>cismo1972@aol.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>hey, sounds crazy, i'm sure, anyways, i grew
up in a house
in new york mills, ny. well i always thought there was something wrong
with me,
but hey, if a bunch of other people experience some wacky experiences,
then i
guess there must be something wacky, going on then, right?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Any ways, i lived in this house the majority
of my life. from the age of 4-17 i lived there. i always thought i
heard and
saw things. i gradually grew desensitized to them. occasionally, i
still saw
things that freaked me out, but again, i believed that i was either
disturbed,
or was over imaginative. i moved back to this house when i was 26, and
lived
there until i was 35, when financial issues caused the bank to take it
from me.
this place, i've learned, is very haunted. when i was a child, i heard
voices
and saw things nearly every day(shadows that did not belong, voices
talking
that you could not understand, mostly) the day my grandmother died, my
parents
even saw a shape move down the stairs. The attic made crazy noises, but
it was
an old house, right? well the house had originally been built in 1854,
by an
old Polish immigrant. he did indeed die there, of a heart attack. he
was a good
man, and a very good father. in the days when i brought my children to
this
house, the shadow was seen only going between the children's rooms.
sightings
were always on the stairs leading downstairs or between the upstairs
bedrooms.
it appears that he is an attentive father checking on his sick
children.(just a
theory) well, the children did indeed become scared sh*****s at the
whatever it
was checking in on them.My second oldest child was diagnosed with
"night
terrors". i went into the area between the rooms and asked him to stop
appearing, as it was scaring them and it stopped for quite a while. a
few years
later, my wife's aunt come to visit, walked over to my living room,
looked over
to the stairway, and ran like hell from the house! she refused to go
any
further than the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>well, as I
said, we were kicked out of the house by the bank. the house has gone
through
six, that's right, six owners, since we left! it has only been two
years since
then! Why is that? I wonder....</big></p>

good until
we moved in and about several weeks my little sister kept claiming she
heard
moans and groans coming from the bathtub at night my mom still didnt
tell us
the story until i heard the moans and groans coming from the bathtub
but i
thought it was the pipes so i agnored it untill it kept happening then
my
little sister was to scared to go back in her room cause she heard
growling
outside her window so i camped out ib her room and heard it to but when
i checked
to see if it was a coyote there was nothing there this kept going on
untill one
night when i was a my friends house the next day my lil sister claims
she saw a
man staring at her the whole night finally my mom told us the story
here it
goes we dont know his name but he was the first to live in the house
and he was
a mean old nasty man who was hated by the town he lived in what ust to
be my
lil sisters room and he also ust to slaughter wild dogs for the fun of
it and
then bury them behind the garage he died one night when he was in the
bathtub
he slipped and fell and couldnt get upit is sayed that at night you

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>"Joe"</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:murmur_blur@yahoo.com </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When I was 17, my mother, step-father and
youngest sister
moved into a house, built around 1899.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is an old house in a steel mill town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was very dirty when we moved in, with soot
in the walls from a coal furnace that used to be in the basement.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The first night we stayed there, I slept in
the living room in a sleeping bag inside a bay window area.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt very uneasy, as though I was being
watched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over the course of the next few
days, I began to feel more and more uneasy, having heard various odd
noises
(which I attributed to it being such an old house), and having seen
things move
out of the corner of my eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After our
light renovations of the house, I took up residence in the basement,
and the
rest of my family took the other 2 upstairs bedrooms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The basement had several
"rooms"...sections that led to the next, separated by doors.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>In the area I inhabited, we had a dividing
wall built to create more of a "room" with less open space.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>One night I was lying in my bed, about to go
to sleep after having read a book.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had
a small light on next to my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wall to
wall, my basement room was about 35 ft long, 20 ft wide.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Against the back wall was a small
window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I setttled into the blankets and
looked up at the window and saw a huge black mass that looked like a
mound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It started at each corner
(bottom) of the wall and came to a rounded point in front of the window.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I was so startled all I could do was sink
into my bed and cover my head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next
night I slept on the upstairs couch.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Other occurances...I was walking down the basement stairs (old
wooden
steps, very slick, about 14 of them) and slipped on the 5th step.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The right side was blocked by a wall all the
way down, but the left side opened to the basement, and next to the
stairs was
a tire jack with a metal pole sticking straight up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I just so happened to grab the rail before I
slipped off the left side (I would've impailed myself on the tire jack)
and
when I did, my head flew back, and standing at the top of the stairs
was a
skinny male figure, shoulder length dark hair, white t shirt, jeans,
and no
face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was quite solid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was a window behind him in the hallway,
casing a white glow around him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
mother was pulling the lawn mower back into the basement by way of the
cellar
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She lost her footing and started
to fall backwards, when she said she felt a hand in the small of her
back,
pushing her upright.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few years ago, I
had Lasik surgery, and to recover, I went to my mom's to sleep (away
from my
kids).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had decided to take a bath
while my mom was watching t.v.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got
into the tub and started hearing the basement doors slamming shut.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a normal occurrance in the house, but
this time, I thought it was mom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
yelled out "are you up here, mom" and she said "yes, i'm
watching t.v.".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doors kept
slamming shut until I got out of the tub.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I've seen things placed at the center of the dining room table
fly off
onto the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I had my first
daughter, she was terrified to be left with my mom at the house.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She was about 2 years old, playing in the
dark front bedroom when she said "Thomas, don't".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thomas
was the name of my sisters boyfriend,
who wasn't home at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
yelling at "Thomas" for taking her toys while she was trying to
play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another time, we were in the
basement, in my former room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was in
the doorway when she said "mommy, who's that man" and pointed into
the basement section with the bay window (shaped like the upstairs bay
section,
just below it).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She's gone into
screaming fits upon entry of the front bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I've seen the image of "Joe" walking behind me reflected in
the computer screen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We've all seen his
head poking around the wall in the kitchen, in the area of the basement
door
(the basement door is between the kitchen and the second bedroom at the
back of
the house).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom's had the shower
curtain ripped open on her. We hear heavy footsteps in the basement
when no
one's home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our "Joe" seems
harmless enough, but what of the black mass in the basement?<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Is there another force at the house besides
"Joe"?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes we think so.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A Frightening Experience</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>seminoles1975@yahoo.com<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When I was in my early 20s, I had one of only
a few
experiences with what I consider the supernatural that truly frightened
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were in our home in North
Carolina which was on top of a mountain with a terrific view of the
Smokies.
Every thing about the house was warm and comfortable - except one
night. That
night there was no indication that something really evil was about to
show
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We all went to bed as normal. My
dad wasn't home with us, so my little sister was upstairs with my
mother in her
room, my brother was in his bedroom, and I was in mine. Everything
settled down
to a noiseless, deep darkness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next
thing I knew, our dog (a German Shepherd/Collie mix) jumped up on the
bed and
started to walk up onto my chest and stare down at me. It occurred to
me that
there was very little weight to her (now, this was a 50+ lb dog). I
knew
something wasn't right. Then as I looked at her and tried to speak, her
eyes
started to glow an eerie reddish glow. The whole feel was of some
extreme evil.
This was absolutely NOT my dog it was something trying to take on her
image to
get to me. I somehow jumped out from under the "being" and reached
for the light switch. As the light came on, there was nothing in the
room. I
thought perhaps it was a dream, but I truly did get to the switch, the
lights
did come on, and I did "feel" the being walk up on me. I truly don't
believe, in my heart, that it was a dream.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I ran through the house to make certain that the evil was gone
and I
wanted to make sure my dog was okay. Sure enough, our dog was in my
brother's
room and looked up sleepily when I opened his door. She was fine and
not at all
the evil thing that had been in my room. The evil tried,
unsuccessfully, a
couple of additional times to get to me. I'll put those experiences in
writing
soon; however, this first occasion was the worst as it used a familiar,
loved
creature as its disguise.</big></p>

asked
her what man and she said the one that talks to me and so when her mom
looked
at her arm she had a red ring around her arm. So one day so was in the
living
room sitting on her knees looking up talking and my brother asked her
who she
was talking to and she turned around and<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said the man her mom took pictures of her so when they
downloaded it to
the computer and on the first picture where she was looking up there
was a
bright circle on the wall where she was looking and the picture were
she turned
around the circle moved down and in a mirror that was at the top of the
wall

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>lancemanley@hotmail.com<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>This is a story that my mother told me and my
sisters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Back in the forties, my dad
accepted a job in
Atlanta Georgia and my parents moved from Chicago Illinois to Atlanta.
For
several weeks they stayed at the Biltmore Hotel in Atlanta while
looking for a
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night my mother, who was
eight months pregnant at the time, was alone in the room by herself
because my
dad was on a business trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said
that she woke up about 3:35 in the morning and saw a man standing
beside the
bed looking at her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man was well
dressed in a suit and smiling at her but<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>she knew immediately it was a ghost because although she could
see him
plainly,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he was transparent, she could
see through him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she was growing
up, the woman who had raised her told her if she ever saw a ghost to
say the
lord's prayer and it would go away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
pulled the sheet over her head and said the lord's prayer but when she
looked
again he was still there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would
close her eyes and open them again but he still did not go away. She
fell
asleep with the sheets pulled over her head and the next day she found
out at
the front desk that a man had died in that room at the exact time she
saw the
ghost. She described the man she saw to the clerk who asked if she knew
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She felt like the ghost meant her
no harm and was there to make himself known and protect her.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Her and her sister lived in an old house in
Champaign Illinois and they both told me that they had encountered
ghosts
several times in that house and one time, they both woke up and saw one
standing in their room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So far, I have
never seen a ghost but I am convinced that they do exist.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Henry Mayo Hospital </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>flo@dslextreme.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I have worked as an RN at Henry Mayo Hospital
for many years.
There are so many reportings there I'm not sure I can list them all,
but here
are a few. The TCU (Transitional Care Unit) is probably the most
haunted unit.
It serves patients who are not acutely ill but are also not quite well
enough
to return home, so consequently a lot of elderly patients have spent a
great
deal of time there -- including ones that never quit made it home and
died on
the unit. There have been reports of a walker moving by itself down the
hall at
night. One rm in particular (don't know the number as I didn't work
there
regularly) has a reputation for the call light repeatedly going off at
night
when it is empty of patients, so much so that engineering has refused
to come
"fix" the bell when the nurses plead to have it silenced. I only
worked there one night and had a heavy fire door slowly swing open in
front of
me and another nurse as if someone was going into the room. No windows
or doors
were open as they are bolted shut, and the door is extremely heavy. The
other
nurse, terrified, screamed at me, "close the door (insert extreme
vulgarities), close the door!!!!!!!!" That same night I had a female
patient who had been in her room for a few months and said she felt
like she
was going "batty" and that she was so thankful for her TV, "I don't
know what I would do without it." Shortly after it went to snow/static,
and I couldn't turn it off with the remote.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nor by pushing the power/on/off button on the set itself, and
finally
had to get a chair to flat out pull out the cord from the outlet that
was
situated near the ceiling. On the medical surgical unit 2 there are
ghosts up
and down the whole hallway, but the end opposite the nurses' station is
especially bad. Rm's 148, 146 and 142 are the worst. Oftentimes
patients who
are dying are put in these rooms, and shortly before they do die see a
little
blond girl in their room at night and either ask nurses to get her out
or at
the very least ask who she is. I had an aide one night open up a
utility locker
at this same end and saw the girl crouched behind a walker, scared,
looking up
at her. Sometimes machines won't work in these rooms, even if you trade
them in
several times from the supply department with different ones, then
suddenly
will start working again. Myself and another nurse witnessed shadow
people, at
the same time, walk past the nurses' station window while the computers
and
lights dimmed simultaneously -- he saw the same night one small shadow
person
standing in a doorway just staring at him (he looked up and asked,
"yes?"
thinking it was a nurse aide waiting to ask him a question, only to
realize it
wasn't an aide). Aides have seen patients that weren't there earlier in
the
evening suddenly lying in a bed, and thinking it was a new admission,
brought
the vital signs machine back in to take their vitals only to have the
patient
gone and the bed still made. Med Surg 1 is next to Med Surg 2, and
though isn't
as bad as 2 I have had a patient complain that she felt little kids
poking at
her and pulling her gown all evening. Med Surg 1 was a pediatric unit
for one
year when the hospital was first built, but was shut down as it wasn't
financially sustainable. The elevators near the cafeteria that lead
down to the
morgue are just plain creepy at night. I have known people that have
had them slam
open and closed several times before finally shutting and going down to
the
morgue. I personally would have them open for me almost 100% of the
time if I
was pushing a gurney and didn't have a free hand to hit the button,
saying
"thanks" to stay on whatever's good side (besides, it is kind of nice
except for the creepy part). These are only a few of the stories off
the top of
my head, I myself have only worked on a few of the units, so I'm sure
there are
many more. I made a dark joke one day to one of the old time doctors
that the
hospital was built on indian burial ground as it has so much activity
there,
and he responded that indeed it is! Who knows if he is right, but all
of Santa
Clarita has has had indian tribes situated throughout the valley for
thousands
of years -- in fact we were one of the main trading hubs, if not the
main
trading hub, from tribes spanning down into Mexico all the way up to
Canada. I
can't validate the indian burial ground part, but the stories I related
to you
here I either experience myself or spoke with the ashen person first
hand who
had just experienced something themselves (except for TCU, but there
again I
used first hand accounts).</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Haunted Courtyard</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>spector113@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I had a strange
thing
happen to me once when I was in the Philippines visiting family. The
house I
stayed in was part of a group of three houses around a central
courtyard and
shared a restroom and shower facility with the other two houses. My
family
showed me around the place the day I arrived and then told me to be
careful
when going outside at night because there was a ghost that haunted the
area.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My reaction, of course, was,
"Yeah, right." because I just knew they were messing with me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My third night there I wasn't feeling well
and needed to go to the restroom a lot more than usual (Don't drink the
water
in the Philippines by the way) so I ended up going out to the restroom
facility
late that night. The restroom<span style="">&nbsp; </span>facility
was on the far side of the courtyard from the house I was staying in
and around
the side of one of the other houses and it was very dark because the
lights
were out in all of the houses and the nearest street light was pretty
far
away.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was on my way back from the
restroom and just as I walked into the courtyard something grabbed me
from
behind and started dragging me backward toward an empty field that
bordered the
courtyard. I say 'something' because it didn't feel like hands that
grabbed so
much as it felt like a force grabbing me on my arms. I managed to pull
away
from whatever it was and look over my shoulder and all I saw was a
solid black
human shape. I took off running toward the house and looked over my
shoulder
again (I know, not supposed to do that when running away) and the black
thing
was following me. I burst into the house and apparently I'd screamed (I
don't
remember doing it but I'm not surprised and I'm not ashamed) because
people
were coming out of their bedrooms to see what was going on. I told
everyone
what happened and they took it all in stride, one cousin even said, "Oh
yeah, that happens."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was really
freaked and didn't sleep the rest of that night and I didn't go out at
night
alone the rest of the time I was there.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I did some reading and asked some questions since then and the
answer I
got most often was it was an evil spirit. From what I've read and been
told
these are paranormal entities that are angry, evil and seek to harm
people.
Sometimes they used to be human but others were never human.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When I ask what they were if they
weren't
human I hear the word demon tossed around quite often.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Regardless, there are many stories similar
to mine where a black shadow or human shape has grabbed a person and I
just
wanted to tell you about my experience<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and see if anyone else had this kind of encounter.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Haunted House in Delafield!</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>cowsrun2fast@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Though I moved out in August of 1990 however,
the house I
grew up in and owned for a while<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in
Delafield IS TRULY HAUNTED! In short, my family as well as many
aquaintences
that have stayed there heard someone walking up and down the steps
leading to
upstairs on numerous occasions. As a family member we just got use to
it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also, there's an attached attic
to one of
the bedrooms upstairs and though I personally would lock that attic
door EVERY
NIGHT (sliding brass lock) however, MANY TIMES in the morning it would
be
UNLOCKED!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then too, MANY TIMES I
would
be awaken with ghost/s blowing sharply into my ear and seeing white
like
figure/s above my bed and hearing like, ghostly laughing!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My oldest brother found a full size Indian
arrowhead while putting a tractor door in on the side of the old
chicken coop.
(now gone) However, the house is only separated from the Civil War Park
(Cushing) by the Bark River.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also
heard
that something like a 5,000 thousand year old Indian body (now in a
museum as
I'm told) was discovered on the other side of Main street (road which
runs by
house / Jackson's place) and something like 20 / 25 years ago and while
I was
still living there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lastly my
speculation is that because the park is from the Civil war era AND
indeed,
Delafield Indians were also around at the time, perhaps either ghosts
of
indians, union army personal, or both are forever haunting the
surrounding
area.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In the middle of July many summers ago we
were playing
outside and we found this doll, it was (My Buddy) kind of looks like
chucky. So
we started playing with it. I don&#8217;t know why but my friends got this
Idea of
blowing the doll to peaces using illegal firecrackers at the time in
Los
Angeles California. I did not agree with that and I ran along to do
something
else. That night , I would say around 3AM something made me toss and
turn and
while I was about to lay completely flat I heard a distinctive child&#8217;s
laugh.
There was no children in the House. I froze in position from the scary
noise I
heard, I couldn&#8217;t rest my head down I was completely scared stiff for
about
15minutes my neck hurt from the position it was in when I froze. Story

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My Ghost Story</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>tawonda2@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I grew up in a hip-roofed stone farmhouse
that used to
belong to my grandparents. We lived in a German-American neighborhood,
and many
farmhouses had a quaint "Old Country" sensibility, with the main
living space a flight of stairs up from the entrance. Like many older
homes,
ours was large in size but broken up into small rooms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One such room was my grandmother's old
pantry, just off the kitchen. My parents had turned half of it into a
small
home office, with a desk for the telephone (back in the day of one
telephone
per household!) and household paperwork, next to a window that looked
out onto
our back yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was very small I
used
to enjoy looking out of our windows at night -- making wishes on stars;
watching sparkling waves of snow fall through the glow of our yard
light;
waiting for my dad to come in from his evening milking chores in the
barn;
occasionally finding surprises like the summer evening that a huge
green luna
moth came to rest on the window of the door. The small, close
"telephone
room" frightened me; but I enjoyed the backyard evening view, so I'd
bravely venture into the room, crawl up onto the chair next to the
window and
look outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One evening I had a desire
to look out the telephone-room window. As usual, I was somewhat
apprehensive
about entering the little room, but my curiosity overcame my anxiety,
so I took
a deep breath and prepared to step over the threshhold, from the warm
light of
the kitchen into the darkness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I did
I looked into the window -- and there I saw, staring back at me, the
wizened
face of an old man, hovering in mid-air.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was partially bald and had a long handlebar mustache...and he
had a
furious, even hateful, expression. I remember screaming in terror and
running
outside into the arms of my perplexed mother, crying that a scary old
man was
floating outside. I remember my mother wondering if I'd seen a
frightening
program on television and had let my imagination run away with me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I was understandably afraid to venture back
into that room for awhile; but the fear and the memory of that night
faded
away. To the extent that I remembered my experience at all I tended to
explain
it in terms of a vivid imagination. And I never had another experience
like
that in that room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, many years
later when I was a teen, I was sitting at the dinner table with my
parents as
they were reminiscing about their childhoods; their earliest memories.
My
father said that one of his earliest memories was of his family's
original
home, a small wooden house that once stood a short distance away from
our
farmhouse. He said that he remembered his grandfather dying and being
laid out
in the parlor of that little house, as was a common occurrence in that
rural
neighborhood even in the 20's.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"What do you remember about your grandfather?" my mother
asked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"He was an old man...mean
and strict; we kids were afraid of him...he didn't have a lot of hair,
but he
did have one of those old-fashioned handlebar mustaches," Dad
replied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt the hair rise on the
back of my neck as I suddenly remembered that vision of my early
childhood.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>50 Year Old House</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>parma@go.net.mt</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I&#8217;m Lena from Malta and I was looking at your
site because
I&#8217;m so interested in paranormal where I found that if we have a story,
we can
share it with you, so here is my story.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>About 8 yrs ago I was living with my ex boyfriend who had
recently
changed the house at that time. The house was about 50yrs old and as we
were
fast asleep, maybe it was between half past two and three in the
morning, I
began to slightly wake up because although I was not fully awake in my
head I
was hearing some noises like I had a metal bucket in the yard which was
near the
bedroom., like someone was dragging it, then the wardrobe doors began
like
someone was shutting and opening them The wardrobe was by the wall on
the side
where I was sleeping. I want to remind you that by then I was still not
fully
awake, and then I could hear near my ear like people talking, remember
I was
half awake until all of a sudden I was fully awake and at the end of
the bed I
saw two figures of two men and although it was dark in the room I saw
them
clearly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I saw this I was in a awe
and I rose on my ankles and these two figures as I already told you,
were of
two men, one was young and the other older and they were wearing white
robes
and on their heads they had white turbans and they had no feet. They
half
turned and looked at me and then they went forward like in slow motion
and
began to fade until they vanished through the wall. I was not at all
frightened
. I swear that I was fully awake when I saw them, and in the morning I
told my
ex boyfriend who did not see nothing because only me they woken up and
he
didn&#8217;t believe me but I know for sure that it happened. To this day I
don&#8217;t
know who they were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Excuse me for my
poor English </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Unexplained Event</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>melayahm@googlemail.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hi. I just stumbled across this site and
thought I'd stick
in my weirdest event. It happened in the<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>mid 90's, when I'd not been long going out with my current
partner. We
got home very late one night from some friend's house, and when we came
into
our flat, we could hear a sound like rushing water. This block of flats
is very
small, only 2 storeys, and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>2 flats each
side. At first we thought it might be a burst pipe from the flat below
us,
which was empty as the old lady who'd lived there had died a few months
back
and no one else had moved in, so we were worried that it was going to
get
flooded. My partner went down t the door, and came back, saying no, the
sound
got less down there, and I said, no, it sounds like its coming from our<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>attic. We pulled down the ladder to go up and
at this point<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my partner said, 'I'm not
going up there'.( He's the one who senses spirits. It doesn't bother
me,
although when he says there's something standing at the bottom of our
bed,
that's a bit unnerving!). So anyway, I went up into the attic. Its a
very big
attic, with good flourescent lighting, and a big gaming table in the
middle. In
one corner, someone in the past had had a darkroom up there, and so
there was a
sink for washing prints. The tap was full on, running into the sink.
But, when
I went to turn it off, the tap was very stiff, I had to use two hands
to turn
it off, so it couldn't have just 'joggled on' with passing traffic
vibrations
or some such. I cannot explain this, although it never happened again.<span

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My First Experience</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>seminoles1975@yahoo.com<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Throughout the years, I've had many
experiences with things
I've never been able to explain. I'll share some of them with
Shadowlands. This
is the first one I have a memory of.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I was very small (younger than 4), we lived with my
grandmother
while our house was being built. I always felt warm and protected in
that
house. I never was afraid, even though "my" room was at the top of
very narrow stairs and was under the eves of the attic. I never feared
anything
in that room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night there was a
terrible thunderstorm and I remember dreaming that there was a fire
under my
parents' bed. I woke up screaming and ran into their room. I kept
telling my
father that there was a fire under the bed. They did their best to
explain that
it was only a nightmare and that there was no fire. My father even got
out of
bed, pulled up the covers, looked under the bed, and promised that
there was no
fire. I eventually fell back to sleep in the bed with them. An hour or
so
later, I had the dream again, but the fire was bigger. I started
screaming
again and woke my parents. This time, however, there was the distinct
smell of
burning wiring, and, indeed, the floorboards under the bed had started
to
smolder. Luckily for all of us, my father was able to shut off the
electricity
and stop the fire before it truly started. The only damage was
replacing some
wiring and a few floorboards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From that
point on, though, my parents always listened when I had an unusual
dream or saw
something out of the ordinary.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hauntings</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>nicholemann@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I need to give you some backstory before I
get into the meat
of the story. My husband and I are both active duty military. We have
been
married for almost 2 years, I have 2 small children from my previous
marriage
(ages 7 &amp; 5 at the time), and I was pregnant with our first child
together.
The pregnancy was going really badly and we were concerned we would
lose it. I
ended up being put on 'bed rest', but my husbands' duty took him away
from the
house for 6 weeks while I was 4 1/2 months pregnant. I only mention all
this so
you see why we dismissed a lot of the initial incidences as stress.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We had been
stationed at seperate bases,
but finally got orders to North Carolina together. We ended up going 3
weeks
with no house (the wait for on-base housing was 6-9 months at that time
and we
were looking off-base), and finally found a trailer house in a park
about an
hour from our base. Three weeks with no housing made us less than
picky, and we
rented it as soon as we saw it. The park itself was nice, with lots of
military
families living there and it was in a beautiful part of the country.
The house
was older, needed some minor repairs, but it was affordable, and most
importantly, available.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
was
little things at first. Uneasy feelings about one side of the house,
objects
coming up lost only to be found nowhere near the original places and
strange
noises. Now, my husband and I both grew up in remote, rural areas,
hunting,
camping, etc., so we were used to the noises of the country. Some of
the noises
we ended up figuring out were rodents or squirrels running across the
roof,
raccoons under the house, but others we couldn't dismiss. Our second
night in
the house, a huge crash came from the living room. Chris and I both
grabbed
weapons and went out because we thought it was an intruder. Nothing was
wrong
in the living room. Not a thing out of place. Both the kids were sound
asleep,
all the doors and windows were still locked.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We just sort of shrugged and went back
to sleep. We learned that<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we are near
either a mortar or artillery range, but you can easily tell the
difference
between when ranges go and a crash in your own living room. Ranges last
all day
and usually at night, and the it just sounds like a distant boom of
thunder or
someone playing bass really loud a mile or so away.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We ended up having the baby very early,
and he spent 3 months in the hospital. During that time, the creepiness
in the
house, especially the hallway outside of the kids room, took on a whole
new
level, but we shrugged it off to the stress of having a NICU baby. Once
he came
home, though, it didn't change. It got to where even my tough husband
hated
going in the kitchen at night to fix the baby a bottle because he would
have to
look at the hall way. The noises of people moving around in the house
became
even more definite. We had a baby monitor in the kids room so we could
tell
that they were still asleep. When we would get up, no one would be
there.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then
we started seeing moving shadows.
Chris was taking a shower one day with the door closed. He thought he
heard the
door open, and saw a shadow move against the curtain, so he thought it
was me.
When he asked me what I wanted and there was no response, he looked out
and saw
that the dooor was still firmly closed and no one was there. I was
actually
nursing the baby in the living room, and the kids were at my
ex-husband's
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When my in-laws came to visit, my
mother-in-law pulled me aside and said that she felt something was
wrong in the
house.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
started seeing shadows,
too. It wasn't any particular time during the day or night, everything
just
seemed to happen randomly. Eventually it got to be too disturbing and
we got
angry. I did a lot of research, and conducted a cleansing of the house,
complete with salting and smudging. We also built an iron pull-up bar
and put
it in the exercise area of our living room. For about a month, it was
completely calm and quiet. Then, it started again, but in a different
way. The
creepiness in the hallway is gone and objects are tending to stay where
we put
them, but now we are hearing voices. I heard my daughter's voice
clearly, even
though she is still at my ex's house. I shrugged it off as a mother
thing, but
then found out Chris is hearing voices, too. It sounds like a young
child, and
I've heard 'mama', but Chris can't make out words, he can just hear the
voice.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This story
probably doesn't
seem too scary, and it doesn't have the 'ooooh' factor of a Hollywood
story,
but we are living it. We aren't scared, even though occassionally we
have had
to go for a drive when something really freaky happens, but we are
getting
tired of some of the strangeness.I talked to our landlady and she said
no one
else has experienced anything in the house, so maybe it is all in our
heads.
Our major rule is we don't talk about it in the house. We don't give it
the
attention we think it wants.Thanks for listening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A Haunted Home in Vermont</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: aihpos9@hotmail.com<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A few years ago I saw in our local paper a
house being given
away for free to whoever would move it. I was curious to know more
about the
place so I called the owner. He told me that the house had a very
interesting
history that went back nearly 200 years. Over that time it had been a
poor
house, a home for girls (which meant troubled girls), a boarding house,
and
possibly a school. He invited me out to take a look.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The house was large and sort of V-shaped. It
was built to fit into a crook/curve in a road. The house had not been
painted
in years-it looked something like a massive beached ship. It was on an
overgrown lot and loomed over this curve in the road. The owner, an old
man who
lived across the street, let me in to take a look around. The first
floor was
decorated in cheap rental style-just the cheapest fixtures, carpet, etc
you
would see in an apartment-no charm whatsoever. He told me that there
had been
renters in the house not that long ago. I was struck by the contrast
between
the hulking, old outside appearance and this first floor that looked
like any
low-budget but fairly modern apartment. We went up to the next floor
and seemed
to go back several decades-maybe to the 1940s or 50s. It was just older
stuff-obviously they had only spent money downstairs. The change in
appearance
was interesting as was the long, v-shaped hallway that ran the length
of the
house-over two large sections. He told me kids used to ride their all
over the
upstairs-it was that big. There were around 20 bedrooms in total in the
house,
rooms leading to rooms, to halls, etc. The owner explored in one area
while I
looked through other rooms on my own. I noticed there were still few
pictures
hanging on the wall and in one closet I found a pile of Kodak pictures.
The
pictures showed a young mother and her newborn baby in the hospital.
There were
wedding pictures and many other family pictures that should not have
been left
behind. Why were these private, cherished family pictures left behind?
I found
more as I wandered through the rooms. I showed the owner the pile of
pictures I
had put together-and suggested that it was odd that anyone would leave
these
pictures behind-as if they left in a hurry, or chaotically&#8230;..something
did not
make sense, you know? The owner looked over the pictures and said they
were
from the previous tenants and that he would make sure they got them. He
let me
explore all the way up to the attic(two more floors)-and each floor
took you
further back in time&#8212;to the top floor where it was the early
1800s&#8230;..wide,
hand-cut beams, blacksmithed door fittings, hinges, etc&#8230;..it was a
remarkable
contrast between the top floor and the bottom floor&#8212;200 years of
difference.
During the visit, the owner happened to mention the name of the
neighbors-and
it turned out to be the family of a co-worker. I emailed the co-worker
later
and told her I had visited the old house across the street from her
mom&#8217;s
house. My friend responded with &#8220;oh, that place is haunted, we always
stayed
away from there as kids. I knew the last people to live there and they
left the
place because it was haunted.&#8221; I was stunned because her first
statement seemed
to explain the mysterious sense that the previous tenants had left the
place in
a hurry. I told my friend what I had found and she was not at all
surprised. I
never felt strange in the house other than feeling the depressing
atmosphere of
a lot of lives lived there and a lot of stories left untold. I never
went back
and I have no idea if anyone ever moved the place-if it still stands or
if it
is gone.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I may have had a sighting of something on
Charles Island in
Milford back in 2003.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was a very
cold nite in October and I was fishing near the island in a 14 foot
boat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sleet and snow was falling and it
was late at
nite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were NO other boats anywhere
in the sound that nite...I had the feeling of being completely
alone....I was
anchored on the sand bar at high tide to the NW of the island.<span

though were people fishing on the island...you could barley see them
walking
about as they fished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it didn't make
sense that there would be people on the island at that time in that
weather...Unless they were out there for 6 hours and had walked from
shore when
the tide was low.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They appeared to be
walking along the shore but seemed to move to effortlessley along the
rocky
shore without the aid of flashlights.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a while I didn't see them anymore.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was very strange... </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A Very Haunted House</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>mixmasterm2005@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When I was 9(i'm 22 now) my mom, older
sister, and I moved
up north to Lincoln, Maine into a house where one of the neighbors
claimed it
was haunted. Apparently a guy had hung himself and the people took out
the
small room where he did it. Well it was the first night we were there
and I was
in the upstairs bathroom doing my thing when in the corner of my eye I
saw a
shadow figure on the wall that seemed to be running towards something
then
disappeared. It was there for a good 10 sec. before it disappeared. I
wasn't
sure whether to run out of the room screaming or call my mom. For some
reason
it didn't bother me though. A few weeks after moving in I was in my bed
trying
to get some sleep. I almost fell asleep when I felt my bed start to
shake a little
bit. I thought it was my imagination when it did it again. I ran out of
my room
and went to my moms room telling her about it. She just told me to go
back to
bed which I ended up going downstairs into the living room and slept on
the
couch. After that night I never slept on my bed that much and would
just sleep
on the floor. Then one night my sister went down into the basement to
go get
her dry clothes out of the dryer. She soon ran up the stairs with some
loud
pounding and ran into the living room telling my mom and I she saw a
shadow
figure hanging from one of the pipes. My mom thought my sister had lost
her
mind and just ignored it while I thought it was the spirit of the guy
who hung
himself who had moved himself down to the basement since the people
took out
the room where he hung himself. This all had happened during the summer
we
moved there. After that not too much happened except for stuff that
would
disappear and reappear in a different room from where you left it plus
I would
hear my name called a lot when noone was home at the time and I
remember I
would hear footsteps upstairs during the day when noone was up there.
Then one
night towards the end of winter I went down in the basement to get my
mom
something and she had a little light on so I wouldn't need to turn the
light
on. When i walked halfway downstairs I saw the shadow figure my sister
had saw
hanging from one of the pipes with what looked like a noose around his
neck. I
stopped and kneeled down looking at him cause this was something I had
never
seen before and me being a kid anything seemed cool to me. As I watched
I saw
him swinging back and forth slowly for a few minutes until he stopped
and
slowly turned his head and stared straight at me then went back and
forth a
little faster that brought his head down at the floor again. It finally
hit me
to what I was seeing and I screamed and ran upstairs to my mom and told
her
what I saw. My sister came downstairs and told my mom if I saw it too
that was
proof enough. My mom saw how scared I was as I explained what happened.
She
didn't think I was joking around from this one and just kept it in the
back of
her head. I didn't go down into that basement for a long time. Then
sometime
during the summer I had my best friend stay over at my moms with me and
I let
him sleep in my bed while I took the floor. I told him to make sure the
ghost
doesn't shake the bed to much and he just grinned and went to sleep. He
then
woke me up telling me to stop shaking the bed. I told him I wasn't then
went
back to bed. He then woke me up again half an hour later telling me to
stop
shaking the bed. He sounded very pissed and I told him I wasn't and to
prove it
I would have my hands behind my back against the wall to prove it. We
went back
to sleep and an hour after my bed shook again and he woke up and saw
that I was
asleep with my hands behind me. He woke me up and told me something was
shaking
my bed and when he said that my tv turned on and off. We looked at the
tv in
horror and I told whatever was doing it to knock it off. It stopped and
we left
the room to sleep downstairs. The next morning my mom was outback
looking at
these stones that were placed out back there as a few of them and when
she
examined them she found out they were grave stones that had no names on
them.
She came inside and told me she solved the mystery into all the
activity around
the house and that they built the house on a small cemetary that wasn't
being
used anymore. So basically the spirits there were using it as a regular
Inn to
do whatever they wanted to. After she said that out loud that's when
all the
activity happened more. Things would move from one place to the other
more, you
would hear footsteps throughout the house, at night time the lights
would turn
on and off, and you would hear voices talking to you. There didn't seem
to be
any danger from the spirits they just liked to have fun except for the
hanging
spirit who would just hang out down in the basement. I would sometimes
catch a
split second of a figure walking and disappearing or would feel someone
touching me on the back or shoulder when noone was there. After a few
years we
moved to another part of town cause my mom wanted a change. She didn't
mind the
spirits at all. I do know though there was a few people who moved in
after us only
to leave again a week later. People never really liked having to share
there
home with spirits I guess. I've always been able to sense and see
spirits since
I was little and still see them now and have had more crazier
experiences. I'll
save those for a different day though. I love anything supernatural or
paranormal since I was a kid. Thank you for letting me share my long
story. I
always love coming to this website to read other peoples experiences.</big></p>

</span>stlfun@live.com<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>First interesting phenomenon:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Closing up a big Halloween party where a
friend had read tarot cards and the guests stayed till well past 3am, I
went
out to the back yard to extinguish the iron tiki torches going down the
hill
(lifting and dropping iron caps on the wicks).<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When I turned around all the caps were off and the torches
burning
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next week, I saw what I
believed was a Native American man's face in the back door window.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Just as quickly as it appeared it dissembled
-- line by line -- like you would see on a computer screen.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We do know there were Indian encampments on
the land at the turn of the century.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After the experience above, and a newcomer to these things, I
asked a
psychic about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said my friend the
Tarot reader stirred up energies but that the property had loving
spirits on it
that protect us for us &amp; not to worry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing else happened for years.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Then last Dec. I saw a mysterious light descend at angle into
the field
below our drive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It traveled slowly and
without a light trail or noise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
leveled off, traveled horizontally a foot or so, and then disappeared.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The night was overcast and no cars on the
road. Then a couple of weeks ago, a friend called me to say that she
had a dark
feeling in her bedroom the night before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She felt heaviness and eyes watching her, and the feeling that
she was
about to be attacked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She yelled out,
"Get out!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said she was
going to burn sage in the room and I suggested she surround herself
with the
white light of the Holy Spirit and ask for the help of the angels.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was gone the next night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But,
in my home (where I have never felt anything but loving energy) I woke
up at
4am to put a log in the fireplace insert and walking through the
kitchen, I
heard 3 very heavy breaths. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Dismissed
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I walked in to the big room but
not until walking through a really thick and angry "cloud".<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Dismissed it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then I got a glass of cold water from the fridge and it walked
up to me
and exhaled loudly into my ear, blowing my hair back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Somehow the negative spirit was able to find
me from my phone conversation with my friend across town.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It sought to do her harm and just to scare
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I feel funny saying, "call on
the angels" but the feeling of calm that comes with it, ended the
event.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I am from the collegiate paranormal
investigation group
Eagle Spirit Paranormal at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University called
Eagle
Spirit Paranormal. We investigated the Grand Hotel in Jerome, AZ and
found some
interesting evidence there. In room 35, one of our investigators, while
sitting
on the floor, was lifted off of the ground and pushed/ thrown into
another
investigator that was in a chair next to him. The investigator who was
thrown
reported to have felt sick every time he had passed by/gone into that
room.
Also, in room 35 (same room) investigators reported seeing the bed
being
pressed down as if someone was jumping on it as well as grunting
sounds. In
room 35's bathroom, the same investigator who was thrown reported
hearing
something say "Get Out". Pen caps were also found arranged on the
floor in a circle pattern in room 35. Upon evaluation of EVP
recordings, a
voice of a small child can be heard saying something like "mommy" when
the room was locked and empty. The floor room 35 is on was the
maternity ward.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was eating lunch with my family in the bar
on the first
floor. We all turned our attention away from the table for what must
have been
only a second and when we turned back one of the plates and silverware
were
missing. We called a waitress over and told her. She sort of chuckled,
said
that it happens sometimes and got us a new plate and silverware from a
cabinet.

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>angelstarr35@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Given the fact that I was born and raised in
Lincoln- I have
lived all over town and I've seen lots of unusual things in
neighborhoods- on
street corners- in parks and while going past cemeteries- Wyuka on O
Street
being the biggest haunt of all of the in town cemeteries-But- suffice
it to
say- nothing quite grabbed my attention as well as the supernatural
residents .
Its a house and is rented out by Tri-win Properties of Lincoln. The
owner of
the company- an elder gentleman- built the house for him and his family
and as
they had expanded their little family- they moved into another house in
another
area of town. They decided to keep the house and rent it to the outside
populous. There was one set of tenants that they don't mention having
resided
there- who still reside there. A couple- a man and a woman. Rumor has
it the
couple were having problems and they were continually fighting. He was
abusive
and had a tendency to like the drink- she was a quiet and loving person
but had
her limitations. It is said that she was growing tired of having to
deal with
and put up with his habits and finally grew fatigued with his abusive
nature
and was going to leave him. He just wasn't going to have any such
ideal. He
pulled out a pistol- shot and killed her and then supposedly turned the
gun on
himself. They died instantly. As a former tenant the experiences I had
while
living there- I would say with all honesty and seriousness- they never
left.
When I first moved in- things were quiet but after a few months of
having been
settled in enough- very strange things started to happen. I would make
meals
and clean up as I went and at the end- I would wash and put my dishes
in the
drainer just off of the right hand side of the right hand stainless
steel sink.
After I would go to bed at night- I could hear my silver-wear falling
into the
sink- same with my small plates or bowls. Very un-nerving but it didn't
stop
there. I used to have a habit of sleeping with my bedroom door shut as
my room
was the bedroom nearest the kitchen and even though I could hear
through that
door what was going on in the kitchen- sometimes- the door would open
up all by
itself. My boyfriend at the time jumped out of bed one night because of
it. He
couldn't sleep and was having a hard time falling asleep. He turned
over next
to me and as soon as he did- the door opened up all by itself- but it
gets even
stranger yet- When I was by myself at times whether during the day or
at night-
I could hear what sounds like a man yelling and a woman crying and
sometimes
would be just the yelling or just the crying but very faint to physical
ear. On
several occasions- I had been home alone at night. As a matter of fact
there
were right around 2 or 3 months that was living there by myself. There
was one
night where I was sitting on my bed in my room and I was watching a
little
portable TV that was sitting on my Chester Drawer Dresser. I had my
bedroom
door open. A white what looked like a Female- full body human figure
went
slowly past my door and out into the hallway in the back where the
bathroom and
the back door was. I got up out of bed to see what it was and where it
went and
by the time I went out the bedroom door and around my dinner table in
the
kitchen just to follow it- it was gone. I had seen that very figure
more than
just that one particular time more like several times over until I had
moved.
The belated residents have made more than appearances and played with
things in
the kitchen or yelled and cried also. They've made their presences
known during
the day also by leaving cold trails where ever they go from one room to
another
and they have famously knocked over stereo speakers in a straight line
no less,
and to boot- they would open closed doors and close open ones sometimes
as well
scaring the daylights out of people who would come over to visit and
who would
also visit for long periods of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
eventually learned to live with the belated residents as I had spent 3
years
close to 4 in the little house and I was sad to have had to leave them
when the
opportunity for a new relationship came along- and had also entailed my
having
to another area of town myself- but I will say this much- had I have
known that
there were strange goings on like that in that little house before I
had moved
there- I would probably have made a few minor adjustments in regards to
updating my knowledge on the supernatural so that I could have better
understood them- but I also hope that Tri-win has taken into
consideration the
thought of mentioning the things that go on there to any and all would
be
current and or future tenant-residents.</big></p>

wanted
her to remember him when he was healthy... he also told me to tell gran

</span>he returned once more said thank you and i
have not seen him again... when i was 16 or 17 living at 6-36 Ross Dr.
Fort
Sask, AB i woke in the middle of the night to my super Nintendo playing

and the controller floating i moved on the bed and it squeaked
startling the
ghost of a little boy who looked at me dropped the controller and
disappeared.... there is also a ghost of a little girl that follows me
around

met her in
Alberta but she has sense followed me to Winnipeg i don't see her as
much as
before but still know she is around some times i will come home and
find a cup

dugout in Alberta he had told me that he was killed by a gang member of
the
crypts 10 years earlier he sure was a sight to see a young black man
missing
half of his head wearing a white muscle shirt jeans and a wallet
attached to a
chain in him pocket he was quite the flirt for a ghost and only wished
that the
man who killed him would get his come up-pings...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I went to ol
slaton
middle school. I am currently in high school but the memories haunt me
still.
Sixth grade. We being sixth graders were not allowed to hear ghost
stories, but
it the "tales" got around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
remember my friend and i hearing the rumors went into the theather
about 7:30.
Instantly we saw the curtains shake and saw a blue mist thingy come
towards
us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>needless to say we ran. One day when
i had to stay after school i was pushed down the stairs by the theater.
I wound
up with bloody knees but that was the extent of the damage. Seventh
Grade. Finally
Halloween :) the day when our teacher mrs. Ray tells the ghost stories!<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We would get on the stage and she would turn
off the lights We were on the stage in complete darkness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first Story was always about the theaters
ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs Ray tells it as there was a
teacher (math) and he told his wife he had to stay after school to
finish up
some<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>things His wife said he never
came
home. the next few days they couldnt find him about a week later they
found his
body in the middle of the stage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
makes the curtains sway the lights turn off he pushes people down the
satirs
and pulls on hair<span style="">&nbsp; </span>likes to make knocking
noises in mrs rays office shakes the back stage doors Anyways i had
"fallen" down the stairs and had hurt my ankle. My friend was helping
me ice my ankle. She swears in my glasses she saw a shadow moving in
the
rafters. Eighth Grade first period i had socail studies so i didnt get
to
witness this event<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend says they
were telling the scary stories when the lights flashed on and off and
there was
a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>loud knocking noise. I went a few
periods
early because i had a doctors appt and i really loved the halloween
stories
anyways we saw a shadow by the office<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>red eyes shadow in the rafters and most strange we heard noises:
door
slamming<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and someone walking on the
apron of the stage. AND a train. o.O<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
friend brought her camera one day and was taking random pictures She
took a
picture of a "theater" mask her camera went missing later that
day<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you have anymore questions please
feel free to ask me anything. </big></p>
