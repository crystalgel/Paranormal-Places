<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">More
and more we are getting emails from ghost hunters telling us that they
have
debunked a location that we have listed on the Haunted Place Index.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The average email states that
these
researchers have gone out, sometimes a few times, to a location and
they did
not get any kind of evidence or signs of activity so therefore the
location is
not haunted.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Zero evidence and
zero
manifestations of any kind doesn't mean the location is not haunted or
doesn't
have any spirits present.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
it means
is that you were unable to find anything to substantiate the reports of
ghost
activity.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You also didn't get
evidence
to disprove or "debunk" it either.</span>&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p><br>
</p>
<span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-weight: bold;">As
newer investigators hit the field ready with their equipment and five
or six
senses, some seem to miss one of the obvious catch 22's of ghost
hunting.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You are not going to get
enough evidence to
prove once and for all ghosts exist and if you get no evidence, many
people will
think that they don't exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p><br>
<br>
</o:p>"Debunking"
is a spreading catch phrase for many paranormal investigators and I
really
think that most are not using the word correctly.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In order to debunk a haunting you would
have to get evidence showing that there are natural causes for the
activity
that has been reported.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
can't go
to a place that has multiple witnesses over a period of time and
conclude there
is no spirit activity because the spirits did perform on cue when you
were
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You
need to show reasonable explanations for
all the activity that has been reported in order to really debunk the
haunting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>What
is more disheartening to me is that some
of these researchers are doing this in private home after people have
called
them out for help.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not only is their
reasoning askew thinking a lack of evidence means no ghosts but calling
the
case "debunked" is also calling the people in the house experiencing
the activity liars or crazy.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
can
have severe consequences on the mental health of any residents who were
already
wondering if there were imaging the activity.<o:p></o:p></span><span

<br>
</o:p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I
have an unrelated theory I wanted to share here so please bear with
me.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have concluded that there are no fish in
the ocean along the coast of New Jersey.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have surf fished a few times, spent many summers down the Jersey
Shore
and even worked as a police officer at the shore and I have never
caught or
seen anyone catch any fish or seen any in the water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since my theory is based on hours upon
hours of watching, swimming and fishing in the ocean, I think it's safe
to say
that after 40+ years I should have seen someone catch a fish or have
seen a
dead fish washed up on the beach, or something.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I feel I
can safely conclude that the
stories of fish in the ocean along the coast of New Jersey have been
debunked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, it sounds just as
silly if you do this with a haunted location too.</span><o:p></o:p></span>
