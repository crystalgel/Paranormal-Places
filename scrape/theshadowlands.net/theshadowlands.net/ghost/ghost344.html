<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">A Few Visitors<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I've have had a few
visiting spirits in my room the past years. About 6-7 years ago while I was
trying to sleep, I started feeling very uncomfortable. Seconds later I heard a
someone breathing for about 5 seconds, ater that, the feeling was gone and
nothing could be heard. Since my room is in a seperate building than my parents
and sisters rooms this freaked me out. Nothing special happened in many
years... But while I was in the army about half a year ago, my sister was
sleeping in my room to be left alone. She woke up in the middle of the night
and saw the ceiling light (wich is hanging from a chain) swinging back and
forth violently. I don't know for how long or what she felt like at the moment,
since she didn't really want to talk about it for some reason... Then a month
or so ago, I found a cupboard door open three times the same day, and i had
closed it every time. Now I nor anyone else had have no business into that
cupboard that day. Later that day I started thinking, and got a little paranoid
about it. So I left my wallet and mobile phone on the bed next to each other
and memorized their position while I went to the main building to grab
something to eat. When I came back, I found that my mobile phone had changed
position and was turned up-side-down and that damned cupboard door was open
again. I cursed out loud at what I think was a visiting spirit to leave me
alone. I haven't expeirienced anything special since then.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Also, while I lived in an
apartment for about one year, four years ago, I had a mysterious invisible
roomate. The bathroom door whould slam shut every now and then, the kitchen
wallclock whould change the time by itself (example. I left the appartment for
a few hours, and when I got back the clock showd i was gone 7 hours),
constantly having a feeling of being watched, and (only a few times though)
knocking heard from the empty apartment next to mine. I started staying over at
friends' places the last few months I had that apartment, because I started
feeling very uncomfortable there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My mother and father bought
an old victorian house that was moved from<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the lot behind </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Monroe
  Street</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> to </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Monroe
  Street</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. They had 7 children<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">there. My father was a
foster kid to a relative we knew as Uncle<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Charlie. He was a dear,
caring man. He always wore a jacket with a felt<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">hat that had a certain shape
to it. After his wife, Aunt Annie, died<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">from cancer, he became ill
and wanted to spend his last days on earth at<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">our house. He loved the
noises of the house, the sound of children and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the activity and goings on
in the house. He had his last rights in the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">downstairs bedroom off the
living room. One night, while my older<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">sister, Joan, was sleeping
in bed, she woke up to see a blacker than<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">black figure of a man, with
a hat and coat on, standing at the foot of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">her bed. She claimed it
looked like the figure of Uncle Charlie. She was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">home alone, while the rest
of the family were on a camping trip, and he<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">seemed to be watching out
for her. A few years later, I was home alone<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and the same thing happened
to me. My dog, Mitzie, who slept at the foot<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">of my bed, started growing.
I looked up to see the figure. I jumped out<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">of bed and checked the
entire house. There was no one there. I went back<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">to sleep and it happened
again. Only then he turned and walked down the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">stairs. That's when I left
and went over to my sister's (Joan's), house<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and that is when she told
me it had happened to her. Then, one evening,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">while about five kids were
sitting on the floor in front of the TV in<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the living room, watching
Laugh-In, my sister's best friend, Patty, saw<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Uncle Charlie come walking
out of the bathroom, through the living room,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and up the front staircase.
She screamed and said she saw a figure of a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">man, he was black, he was
walking about two feet off the floor. (I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">figure he was happy to hear
all the laughter of the children.) When dad<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">retired they sold the house
and we visited with the new owners a few<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">months after they had moved
in. When I stopped to ask for the visit,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">they asked me what was
going on in this house. Apparently they had heard<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">things and their
15-year-old had seen something in her room--which was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Joan and my old room where
we had seen Uncle Charlie. I told her not to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">be afraid, he was there to
protect her, and he is still there to protect<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the children who live in
that house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Names david and i live in </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Washington</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">State</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. I am 12
and well, Im going to tell you of a few of my experiences. Iv had many of the
same experiences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">1: This has been happening
to me for my entire life. Well, sense about 6 months after I was born but its
hard to remember that... Lets just say it started when I was 3. I would always
be sitting in the living room late at night trying to go to sleep while my
grandmother sat on the couch. id be cuddled up next to her. Id just be sitting
there trying to either sleep or find some cartoons on at night, to no prevail.
Now, nobody was awake at the time and I knew that sense my brothers wernt born
yet and my mother and father were in there room. I was just sitting there when
i heard some footstpes comeing up the basement stairs. Now, even at my young
age I beleived in ghosts never once doupting they existed. I at first was quite
reluctant to go to the basement also knowing about intruders and what I should
do. I woke my grandmother and me and her investigated. Seeing nothing she told
me to go to sleep. I did. This hads repeated over and over from that time sense
at least every other week. Lately its slowed to monthly at the least. Now, i
have a cat and sometimes he does that when Im alone at home or everyones asleep
but I always check to see where he is before I say it was him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">2: The second thing has
only occured to me once. I was asleep in my room, well, sleeping wasnt exactly
what I was doing 'cauze I always stayed up. I was actually watching TV when My
door suddenly flew open. Now, i had it closed and locked. It had opened and
stood wide open. I darted up and went to the door hearing completely nothing at
all as I got there nothing stood nin front of me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">3: I was alone in my house
and I had been watching TV. This happened only 3 years ago. I had to go really
badly so I ran to the bathroom. I was in there when the lights went off and a
pale figure appeared for maybe a second tops. I nearly jumped up but my
situation was kinda... you get it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">4: I have seen a cat in my
house recently. Its not my cat 'cause my cat is white and this one is... i cant
exactly explain. its black but lets off an </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">erie</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> glow. The
first time I saw it I tried to pet it but it ran away swiftly yet quietly. The
second time I did pet it and in return I got my elbow burned when it tounched
it. it didnt burn my hand, just my elbow. third and finally, I watched my cat
play with this cat spirit. It was kinda cute watching them paw at each other.
The first and third encounters my friend was around to witness. i think this is
the reason my friends think Im weird. i tell them true ghost stories and they
think Im lieing, except my other friend who saw the cat with me. I think my
'friends' spread the rumors and thats been a curse for me around school sense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The old riverview hosptial in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, was
abandoned for many years before being finally torn down. Before it's final
demise, many young kids would go there for a good scare, and it sooned earned
the reputation of being "haunted". My cousins, Krissy and Dave, were
overheard talking about it by their mom and stepfather. They became courious,
and drove out there with them for a good laugh. While approaching the hospital,
coming down the hill which leads to it, the car suddenly stopped. They were
stunned. Jon, my uncle got out to see what happened. He thought they must have
hit something. When he observed the front of the car, he was astonished. And
nothing, was in the road. It was like they hit an invisible object. The next
day, he brought the car in to get looked at. The mechanic laughed, and asked
what he hit. Jon said he was going 35 mph, and the car just stopped. The
mechanic laughed again, and said he was full of shit. The center of the front end
was smashed in so far, it looked as though they hit a telephone pole dead on.
Jon maintained his story, and the mechanic gave his estimate for the repair
work. What was weird, is that they never spoke of this for many years..none of
them. We were at a holiday dinner at my parents house, just sitting around
passing the time. We were talking about birth places, and I brought up
Riverview hospital, where I was born. Thats when Krissy told of the tail..Jon
just sat there, listening. Afterwards, she said " You know, I think this
is the first time we ever talked about this. Even amongst ourselves. Thats
kinda weird. I guess I never really thought about it." Jon, just
maintained his silence. He must be a skeptic, who was proven wrong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My entire life I've always
believed in ghosts, mostly because of my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">mother. She lived in an old
brick house growing up near downtown<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Houston</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> and would
always tell me stories of weird things going on. She<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">moved to the house we live
in now, in 1980 with her brother, and then<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">got married and had me
later in 1984. This house was not originally<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">here..nor was it originally
a house. It was a garage apartment used as<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">a maid/butler's quarters in
the 1950s or 60s (I forget) in River Oaks,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">a very old and rich
neighborhood in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Houston</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. Odd
things had always<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">happened in our house, we
would here all sorts of noises, footsteps,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and there was just always a
feeling that we were never alone. We<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">learned to live with it, we
shared our home peacefully with whatever<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">else was there. I even
remember playing with the spirit of a little<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">boy when I was very small
(or it could have been my imagination, who<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">knows?) So basically we
were all one big happy, only some of us were<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">dead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">But here is the big one. It
didn't happen often but about every couple<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">of years or so I would hear
someone call my name and ask my mother<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">what she wanted or go and
see who was at the door and it would turn<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">out that she hadn't said a
thing or that no one was there. The same<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">happened with her, it never
really scared us, we knew what it was and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that we were not in danger.
But, about 2 years ago I was at my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">computer surfing the net,
doing my daily bored-as-hell routine, when I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">heard someone whisper
"Jill.." (Thats my name incase you didn't know.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I looked around incredibly
angry that someone would walk into my house<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">like they owned the place
and didn't bother to knock. I looked around<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">this room and the next, I
even looked out the window and there wasn't<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">a soul in sight (no pun
indended.) I was a little shaken, but not<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">really bothered, so I went
back to surfing the net. About 30 seconds<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">later I heard
"JILL!" Loud, clear and obviously a man's voice. I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">jumped up from my seat and
ran outside, away from whatever/whoever was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">trying to get my attention.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I sat on the porch cold and
barefooted for about 15 minutes wanting to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">just leave but my keys,
shoes, and cigarettes (I know, I'm such a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">nicotine fiend) were still
in the computer room. I eventually got the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">balls to walk into the
living room. I would look through the doorway<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">at the den and computer
room but I couldn't bring myself to cross the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">threshold, so I sat on the
couch in the quiet for a bit trying to get<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">up the nerve to just run in
and get my keys. It took everything I had<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">to walk into the computer
room, and then I heard "I'm sorry." This was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">too much. I ran out of my
house and down the street (barefoot) and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">called a friend to come
pick me up. I've discussed this with a few<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">friends (carefully selected
only those that believed in ghosts, so the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">others wouldn't believe I
was crazy), and we came to the conclusion<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that I was, in fact, being
contacted by someone, and that in his last<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">statement he was
apologising for frightening me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I just wanted to post my
experience for other people to read so that<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">they know that no matter
what skeptics say, we are not alone, and we<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">are not crazy,
ghosts/spirits/poltergeists are real. There are too<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">many experiences that
people have had for every single one of them to<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I have lived in my house
all my life. I bought it from my mother a few years ago. As a child, I can
remember many, many thing that happen here. It is said to haunted by a family
of 3. A man, woman, and a small little boy. Around 12 years of age. My brother,
sisters, mother and myself have all had their run ins with the family. But one
time stands out more than most. My mom is a single mother. Worked long hours
and to tired to make it though a movie. So one night we were watching a movie
and she feel asleep on the couch and I on the floor. She was awoke by a boy
sitting on her chest holding her down, laughing at her. She could see me on the
floor sleeping but could not move. The windows were closed and the curtians
were moving as if they were being sucked toward her. This lasted for only a
minute or 2 then it was over. She was not asleep and this was not the only time
it had happen. The little boy liked to "pick" on her as she calles
it. She is the original owner of this house. I have many, many storys that I
could share. I belive in ghost 100%. And do belive they are still in this house
with us, and they will never go away. Nor shall I.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I'm 15 years old (16 on May
10) and I've lived in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Winchester</span></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">KY</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> all my
life. The first 11 years were spent in an old house located on </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Garner
  St</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">.. Ever since I could remember there were strange
things happening in that house. The most obvious happened when I was 2-4 years
old and I don't remember them much. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">*an old UNPLUGGED player
piano suddenly playing by itself in a room where my grandfather had died.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">*an old touch lamp that had
belonged to my grandfather turning on and off like a strobe light, then not
wanting to come on, and not wanting to go off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">*pop cans sliding across
stove tops<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">*footsteps<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">all the above were some
things I remember, the better ones include:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">* when I was 2 I would
always sit in our den talking while no one else was in the room, my parents thought
it was imaginary friends, except I called one "paapaa" and then while
searching through some pictures, I pointed to one of my grandfather Bill, who
had died before I was born, and said he was the man who played with me all the
time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">* another of my "imaginary"
friends was a girl who's name my parents can't remember, my parents thought she
was imaginary too, and just brushed it off; then while my mom and I were at
Fort Boonesborough (sp?) where the stautue that now stands in college park once
was, I backed away and said he was mean and made my friend and her family go
away. My mom thought it was strange, but didn't think on it, until we found a
nameplate at the park that had all the names of original settlers, and the girl
who I always talked about knowing's name was on the board! I was only 2 and
didn't even know about Daniel Boone. My parents still get nervous over it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">*The other huge thing
happened the day we moved, my older brother was down in our basement sweeping
up and getting ready for us to leave. Then he turned to the back of the
basement where we had a crawl space filled with dirt, as he looked back, he saw
the shadow of a man leaning back against the wall of the crawlspace. he ran up
the stairs and promised he would never go back in that house again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Other things always
happened, stuff moving around, pictures messing up, one picture of myself at 5
years old I was standing beside our xmas tree and my mom took a picture, when
it developed there were two distinctly human shaped forms hovering behind me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Over the years since the
house had been built, two people had died while my family owned the house, and
at least four had died since the house had been built. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Hope this was interesting
to you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My life has been very
gifted with a sight of seeing the unusually things that just dont happen
everyday. When I was just 13 my family and I moved to a house in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Laredo</span></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Kansas</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. It was
your everyday country house. We all liked it and it had just one of those warm
glows to it. We though everything was just fine until we saw something that
kind of opened up our inner eyes. My family and I were just sitting down to
watch t.v. when my youngest sister said she just saw a cat run into the
kitchen. We all though that it was on of the cats from at outside. We searched
that entire house looking for a black cat and we never found it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The second appearance
happened to my mother while us kids were at school. She claimed she seen the
black cat again and chased it upstairs and looked in all of our bedrooms for
and never found it. And when she went down stairs, she discover that the
kitchen faucet was on. After that we all started hearing foot steps go from one
end of the house to the other and down the stair case. That when everything
started happening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My older sister was ill one
night and she claimed that she felt someone put their hand on her forehead and
the place a clod wash cloth there. Of course we didnt believe her until she
said she saw an old woman sitting on the edge of her bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">After many years of just
hearing the same thing over and over again we got used to it. The about three
years ago my parents got a divorce. And that when I started to get the feeling
that some one was sitting on my bed every night in the same spot. I would just
roll over and tell my self that its just my imagination running wild cause of
sleep. Then one week in May toward the end of school, I was in bed and I
started to get that feeling that someone was sitting on my bed. I just did what
I normally do and rolled over. Next thing I felt a hand just open up against my
back giving me a chill that caused me start shaking. I told my mom about him
and she said had a funny feeling about my room. Then we started seeing a man at
the bottom of our stairways and Always in the corner of my room. And when my
moms boyfriend (ex-boyfriend now) moved in with us, he claimed that he kept
hearing things being knocked of dressers and door being slammed shut up stairs
while he was in the house alone. Then things started to get worst when my
boyfriend (which is now my husband) and I started dating. The slamming became
worst and the foot step sound became louder like it was anger. Then my mom was
able to find out who the guy was that was doing all these thing to our home.
His name was Jason and He lived in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Mississippi</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> during
the 1800s and how he died was on the </span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Mississippi River</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> near </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Natchez</span></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Mississippi</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. My mom
said that she has been sensing him before he ever showed up. And that she
figured it out that he was my ghost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">In December of 2003 I
became pregnant with mine and my husbands son. That when thing started to go
real bad. Things in my moms house were being broken and the slamming and
things getting knocked off dresser tops and stuff had increased. My mom feared
for me and my son cause she came to the conclusion that my ghost was very
unhappy about my son and husband. She finally decide it was time for him to
leave. After that my son was born two months early and when we returned home
from the long hospital stay, The house felt like it was normal again. Not the
old feeling of sadness that just hung around all the time. And I never had the
feeling that my ghost was there anymore and It felt safe again for me and my
son. But we still saw the black cat every now and then until I moved out. Then
someone burnt my mother house down. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I left home for a business
trip to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ottawa</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> on </span><st1:date year="2005" day="15" month="3"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Tuesday March 15, 2005</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> at </span><st1:time minute="20" hour="8"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">08:20am</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. Along the way I realized that I
had not made accommodation reservations. I called the hotel and inquired with
Ray, the front desk attendant as to their vacancy availability. Ray advised
that they had plenty of rooms and proceeded to book me into on of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I arrived in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ottawa</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> at
approximately </span><st1:time minute="40" hour="11"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">11:40am</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> and
decided to have lunch. I stopped at Red Lobster and had clam chowder and a
garden salad with Italian dressing and a diet coke.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">After conducting my
business activities of the afternoon I departed for the hotel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I didn&#8217;t get to the hotel
until approximately </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="17"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">05:30pm</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. I
checked inn and was assigned room number 653 in the north tower. After
unpacking and settling in I set up my laptop computer and checked my e-mail
etc&#8230;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I ordered dinner (room
service) and called home to talk with my wife. After I had completed my conversation
with my wife and hung up the telephone there was a knock at the door and a
member of the kitchen staff delivered my dinner; French Onion soup and Chicken
Amaretto. I ate my supper while watching Daily Planet on the Discovery channel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">At approximately </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="22"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">10:00pm</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> I laid down on the bed to watch
more television and fell asleep. I awoke at approximately </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="23"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">11:30pm</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, got ready for bed and climbed
under the covers. I watched another &frac12; hour of television then shut it and the
bedside lamp off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I drifted off to sleep and
was awoken sometime around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="2"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">2:00am</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> by what
felt like someone or something climbing onto the bottom left corner of the bed
and making its way up towards me. I immediately looked in that direction which
was illuminated by the soft green glow from the bedside clock radio, but there
was nothing there to see. I laid back down and concurrently felt a moderate to
heavy weight compress and hold me down and attempt to pull the covers over my
head in what I perceived as an attempt to smother me. I fought off the entity
with some difficulty and at the same time observed what I will refer to as a
Wraithe-like figure, (one who is not of solid body but a flowing dark
water-like figure dressed in what appeared to be dark flowing strips of waving
rags). This entity was in the process of lying down on the other bed in the
room to my right and looking in my direction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I did not sense (feel) that
the figure was there to do me any harm but was present at the same time as I
felt the moderate to heavy weight attempting to hold me down and pull up the
blankets to smother me. When I finally was able to break free of the force that
was holding me down, I looked back towards where the Wraithe-like figure was
previously located and watched as it slowly dissipated into the darkness of the
room. During this experience I had an unexplainable the feeling that the
Wraithe-like figure was feminine and not masculine. I feel that I was
completely awake at the time this strange experience was taking place due to
being woke up prior to the events described actually occurring and did not go
back to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The room was abnormally
quiet and still and bathed in the soft green glow of the bedside clock radio. I
did not hear any sound what-so-ever. (Generally you can hear the sounds of the
city coming through the windows as well as the heater fan blowing). I could
hear nothing but a deafening and ominous silence. I could not smell any
discernable odours in the room even though the tray of dinner leftovers was
within four feet of me on the small round table to my left.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I looked all around the
room through the green glow of the clock radio but could see no-one or nothing
other than the furnishings and my personal effects that should have been there.
I immediately began to pray the Our Father and continued for two(2) hours until
</span><st1:time minute="0" hour="4"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">4:00am</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. I finally was able to get out of
bed at that time and in the dark, walked to and used the washroom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The room remained
abnormally quiet for approximately an hour or so when the sounds of the city,
heater fan and the hotel could once again be heard. I could also now smell the
sweet odour of the Amaretto used in the preparation of the chicken dinner. At
this point I did not get back into bed but remained up with the computer
desk-lamp on in the room. I turned on my computer and checked my e-mails,
showered and packed. While performing these early morning activity&#8217;s I sensed
that some one or something remained in the room and continued to watch me
giving me an eerie uneasy feeling. I left the room and checked out of the hotel
around </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="6"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">6:30am</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Well lets start off by
saying i am 15 now (2005) this happend about 4 years ago, this has changed my
life forever and I remember it like it was yesterday. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was hanging out with my
cousin who at the time was 14. We will call him mark. Me and mark were very
close we told each other everything. We had sleepovers and would stay up late
telling each other about our life. We would always end up crying together
because his storys were so horrible that i knew he was hurt deep. I used to go
over there and see his dad hit him, hard. I would just stand there and watch
not believe what was happening before my eyes.. It was horrible<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One night well me and him
were sleeping over and his grandmas he told me that he loved me and i was the
only thing that kept him alive this long but he never wanted to go through this
again and he could handle it. He sat me down and gave me a long talk about how
much he valued me and how he would always be there. That night me and him had
our last talks and last shared memories and thoughts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">In the morning my mom came
and got me me and mark said goodbye for the last time. I am truth i think i new
what he was planning but i never told anyone, because i knew i couldnt make him
suffer another round with his dad. That day at chool i got really sick in the
middle of class my whole body hurt as someone had slammed me into a brick wall
over and over. I went to the nurses room and i sat there for awhile and then
out of no where the pain stopped. Then i got called down to the office.. My mom
was crying and told me that mark had jumped out of his grandmas window... My
mom came and got me from school. I remember that day looking at old pictures of
me and him and remembering our last goodbye.. But i never got to say goodbye
completly there was so much i never got to tell him.. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">About a year later the day
he died i lay quietly sleeping in my room. All of a sudden i felt a cold hand
on my shoulder and i brushed it off and then i herd someone say my name I
turned around to see marks smiling face. I tried to hug time but i went right
through him then i knew i wasnt dreaming... Mark spoke so calmly to me that
night and said I have this night every year to talk but thats it. I wanted to
you know that i love you and will always be with you no matter what im looking
out for you. Me and him spent the whole night talking and in the moring at
exactly </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="4"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">4am</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> he said
ive got to go home now i love you goodbye and vanished.. Every year on the
exact date i wait up and he always comes to talk to me...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My name is Shelly Hoffman
and my family of four moved from a home that had a haunting. We only told
family about the strange happenings, such as some kind of oily substance coming
thru the floor, (similar to someone pouring it thru) , lights coming on and off
with no explanation, fans on and off, bells ringing, and my children seeing
a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>foggy man dancing on the
ceiling(daughter) or walking down the hall ( my son). There were other strange
things as well, too numerous to count.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We were never afraid of the spirit and it seemed like a member of the
family. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we bought the house it was only ten
years old and no death had occured in the home and the previous owners were the
ones who built it new. At first nothing really happened and then as we lived in
the house more and more strange things would occur, spoons taken out of the
drawers and put on the floor etc. I went next door and finally asked my
neighbor, Jim, who had lived there all his life if anyone had died on the
property. He said, "That was a strange question, but yes a family man had
died of a heart attack in his home. The house was a one story and was bull
dozed after he died by his wife and daughter. They moved away eleven years ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We sold the home to an
assisted living person and we are happy knowing that the "ghost" is
among people his own age and that maybe when the new residents pass on they can
help him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I have never been a big
believer in the supernatural but after some pretty recent events I admit I have
changed my mind. It all revolves around a good friend of the family who works
with my father. His name is Steven and he is your typical all around great guy.
About a two years ago,. He and his wife had just become parents and decided
they needed to find a larger home. They came across what they thought was a
perfect find in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Brockton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. The
house was older if I remember correctly I think my father had told me it was
built around the mid 1800's.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">For the first three months
or so everything was pretty normal. Then little things began. For instance all
the clothes that came out of the dryer would be buttoned all the way up.
Steve<span style="">&nbsp; </span>thought his wife was playing tricks.
So one afternoon he placed all his unbuttoned work shirts in the dryer when he
was home alone. Sure enough when he removed them all the buttons were buttoned.
Trying to not be freaked out I guess he tried to ignore this. Soon after his
wife approached him about the footprints. After<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>some snow had fallen footsteps apeared all over their fenced in yard
though no one had gone outside, as if that was not strange enough they began to
hear footsteps in the house. As odd as these things were they were tame compared
to what happened next.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Christmas arrived and
Steve's two sister-in-laws were staying for the holiday. The evening went
wonderful and around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="10"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">10:00</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> they all
headed to bed. The sister's sharing a bed in an upstairs bedroom. At around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="14"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">2:00</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> Steve and his wife woke to
screams. Running to check on his in-laws he and his wife were shocked to see
them scratching and punching eachother. When Steve described it to my father he
said they looked like "crazed animals" trying to intervene they
turned on Steve. Dragging them downstairs their rage stopped as quickly as it
started. Neither could remember the fighting or how it had started. It had been
so intense however that one of the sisters required 6 stitches across her
cheek.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Steve and his wife began
the discussion of selling the home soon after. They were mostly concerned with
the well being of their baby. His wife who was home most days said she
constantly felt "watched" and "hated" to the point that she
would take the baby out all day to avoid the house. Steve who too felt
something odd about the house wanted to try and stick with it. It had taken
them so long to find a suitable home to begin with. They had quite a few heated
discussions about it until not too long later when something happened that
truly changed Steve's mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Steve woke to the sound of
soft singing. Disoriented he strained to find the source of the singing. As it
grew louder he realized the sound was now blaring out of the baby moniter.
Jumping from bed he raced to the room. Finding nothing he lifted the baby for
the crib. His wife now woken met him in the hall. He turned on the light to
examine their child as Steve tried to explain to his wife what had happened.
Upon turning on the light Steve's wife became hysterical. Imprinted on the
baby's forehead was a perfect cross. As if that was not bad enough both Steve
and his wife had one too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">After that night the wife
and child stayed with family until Steve could sell their home. He was told by
an elderly neighbor that a highly religious women had owned the home and had
died in her bedroom. Steve always believed she was "kind" but
something else in the house was not. He wondered if the crosses were her doing
and was meant to protect them. Either way he could no longer live in that
house. As of now no one lives there. Steve had success having it sold but
whoever purchsed it must have had a change of heart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I really do love this site!
I have another story to share with ya'll. In April 1998 my grandfather went into
the hospital to have a little fluid drained from around his heart. The doctors
found they needed to do a triple bypass once they got in there and my
grandfather never recovered. For months after his operation he was attached to
tubes and the doctors performed tests on him to try and improve his condition.
The last I saw of him was in July of 98 and he looked to be making a recovery,
at least that is what I thought. My grandfather finally passed away September
3rd with my family surrounding him...except me. My grandfather was a great man
who I loved dearly. He and I were very close (I was his only granddaughter) and
it broke my heart that I couldn't be there when he passed on. The week of his
death was my freshman orientation for college and I couldn't get away. I was
told he waited and waited and was told I would not be able to make it and that
is when he finally let go. I was so devastated when he died because I never got
the chance to say goodbye and tell him how much I really loved him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I flew to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> the day
after he died and went through the motions of getting things prepared for the
funeral. The day of his funeral came and we all gathered together. All his
brothers had come from </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> and we
all said goodbye to him. It really was a beautiful service. We then gathere at
my grandparents house and had a party in his honor. He would have loved it. At
about dusk, everyone had gone inside and I stayed out on the back deck (his
pride and joy) and just sat in the darkness wishing I had gotten to say goodbye
to him. I knew my grandfather was there with me, I could feel him. I looked
around and said out loud.."Grandpa, if you are here, give me a
sign"...just then the back porch light came on. I looked at it and ran to
the door to see if someone may have hit the light switch by the door, but
everyone was in the living room. So I asked him to turn it off...light went
off, then came back on again and stayed on. It was at that moment that I felt
so much better about his death and I knew in my heart that he knew I loved him,
it was as though he was telling me himself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To this day I believe he watches over me. I have even been told by a
psychic that he watches me sleep at night and even at times pokes me and flicks
my nose which is something he used to do ALL the time when he was alive. That
was his personality, a total jokster!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My name is Josh and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>back in 1994 me and my sister went to my dads
house in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Aurora</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> ill. and
stayed there for the summer.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would
somtimes stay up and play super nintendo till we got tired which would be about
</span><st1:time minute="0" hour="2"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">2:00 a.m</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One particulur night my older brothers
decided to rent a game and invite some friends over to play and hang out. That
night everyone was having a good time that is until it started getting late, so
everyone went home and my brothers all went upstairs to there rooms. and
because me and my sister were visitng them we had no room but the basement
(which was really dark and creepy) well that night we kept playing and it was
about 3:00 a.m and we decided to sleep in the living room which had no carpet
it was only sub floor because my father was going to get ceramic tile
installed. well that night I slept in the big couch which was by the stairs and
my sister slept across from me on the smaller couch the house was somewhat dark
with the neighbors light shinning in the living room which gave some light to
the stairs. The house was very quiet and me and my sister were dosing off that
is untill we heard footsteps from the top of the stairs going down. I swear i
looked up at the stairs and saw no one there but still heard the footsteps
coming our way. I could'nt bare to move thinking that whatever was walking down
the stairs would see me and stop in front of me I did'nt even want to breath.
This thing kept walking towards the kitchen that goes downt to the basement and
then stops. I called to my sister a few times untill i got a response then I
asked her if she heard what i heard and she said yes, then she tells me that
she's scared so i got up and walked up to her and we both ran to my brother's
room. The next day I told my dad, and my dad knew that the house was haunted
based on his encounter there plus when he bought the house the couple that
lived there befor died there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The story
goes that the lady was going down to the basement and slipped and killed
herself on the steep stairs going down then the fiance finds her and cant stand
that his fiance died so a few weeks later he commits suicid in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When I lived at home in my
parents house, I had to be about 17 at the time. I was sleeping in my room one
well morning I had to be around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="3"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">3am</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> or
so...anyways. To rewind..We built this house ourselves it had to be like a year
old maybe two tops..We built it from the ground up we peeled the logs drove the
spikes etc. So as I was afraid of the dark and spooky thing (kinda ironic cause
I'm wiccan and into it very much..) but I was comfortable with the house being
new and no scary background. However it was at the top of a mountain in the
middle of nowhere...anyways..I was sleeping in a deep sleep where I was having
a nightmare of a little boy in my kindergarden class that I worked in. In the
dream I was finding him in a barrel dead, all I could see was his little
striped shirt and his hand but I knew it was this particular boy and I was
horrified, upon going up to see this boy and pull him from the barrel I woke up
with a major start..the thing that woke me was this unnatural voice speaking right
in my ear really fast..in some language I cannot even describe I have no clue
what it was saying but it didn't feel right it felt dark and scared me sooo
much!!! All I can say was it was not human..sounding like maybe a distorted
deep voice speaking in something LIKE latin but not.. I have no clue what th
was but it was in a whisper and to this day I get all teary eyed and goosbumps
thinking about this..I was awakened by this and when it happened I jumped out
of bed ran downstairs and went in bed with my mother I stayed awake until </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="5"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">5am</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> then went to sleep when the sun
shone...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I have now moved and live
about 25min max from my mother and my husband and I have bought a house from
the 1800's. Though I love the house I feel rather uneasy in it Especially in
the laundry room which is near the stairs (not a good feeling going up the
stairs knowing that room is BEHIND you and creepy. and the kitchen I think part
of the feeling is both doors are glass that come off each room and they open
into the porch..anyhow I get this feeling something not evil but not alive is
in the laundry room...the hallways leading to the kitchen is kinda
uncomfortable too and the bathroom is off the hallway I usually pee with the
door open so i can see whats going on!! I have to say I think I have seen a
woman in a white nightgown kinda like float into the laundry room. I think once
it was a bedroom because its not made for a dryer. I do not feel comfortable in
these rooms nor do I feel threatened...I do make up exscuses for my husband to
accompany me to the bathroom in the middle of the night because I am scared
then I run up the stairs afraid to look behind me. However I have 3 cats and
they never act weird like they are picking up vibes..I also have a 5month old
and I belive children are more intuitive and my son is the happiest boy alive!
So. If my house has company i do not think its evil. I do feel I attract some
kind of vibe though because it doesn't matter where I go I feel precences....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The year was 1972, I was
attending a Baptist college in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Oregon</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, I was
majoring in theology. While attending theology classes, I was given my choice
for a closer in depth study, a subject in the Bible, I chose demonology and
related periphery. I immersed myself in the study of demons, evil spirits,
necromancy, channeling, ouija, mediums, witchcraft (which the Bible does not
include as connected with demonology, but connects it to the area of the flesh
(initiated by humans). I came to a point in my studies where I began to be
subjected to a myriad of mental attacks, paranoia, a demon under every bush, so
much so that I decided to take break from studying, and take a trip in my car
somewhere. I decided to drive to Yellowstone Nat&#8217;l Park. So off I went. The
route took me to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Idaho</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> first.
Driving through </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Idaho</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> I soon
came to a place named Craters of the Moon Nat&#8217;l Park. I stopped at the entrance
and drove thru, and parked. Here was basically a small ranger station and a
parking lot. The wind was blowing moderately, however the temperature was about
35-40 degrees and the cold just cut right through me. Now picture the landscape
with nothing but a lava field for miles, predominantly flat and crunchy, and
peppered with outcroppings of large rock lava formations. I had walked nearly
175 yards from the parking lot, when I saw a wooden ladder protruding up from
the ground about 2 feet. I soon discovered the ladder descended into an opening
in the lava, holding on to the ladder, I looked down into the bottom of a small
cave, whose floor was probably 12-15&#8217; below. I began climbing down the ladder
slowly, finally stepping on to the floor of the cave. The cave was shaped in
form of a double-lobe, picture a heart shape, the bottom of the heart cut off
about 1/3 up from the point. The lobe on the right was about twice the size of
the one on my left, as I faced the separation point (like standing in the
heart&#8217;s middle facing the top with the lobes) I did a slow pan of the cave,
starting with the larger lobe on the right and moving in a left direction
across into the smaller lobe, and ending at wall on my left. I now stepped into
the small lobe 2 short steps, because the floor had a basin drop to it. I
panned the walls more slowly now, carefully noting it&#8217;s finer textures, feeling
so peaceful and calm, I was truly enjoying myself. Having inspected it fully, I
pivoted on my right foot, and took 2 &frac12; steps in the larger lobe, I was
immediately and violently frozen with fear, having a presence of immense hatred
mixed with a projected and evil demand to leave it&#8217;s domain, all the while
wrapping me in dominating restraint, so I could not even act on it&#8217;s demand. I
would say all these restrictions placed upon me lasted about 20-25 seconds,
when I felt a slight, resentful lessening, allowing me to pivot around and
begin climbing the ladder, all the while cloaked, as with a heavy cold blanket,
with all the original fear, hate, evil demands of this entity. Making it to the
top of the ladder, I ran, no release, as though now the entity had succeeded to
cleave to me, permeating even into the hairs of my head and adhering to my
skin. I had reached the halfway point on my run back to the parking lot, when,
abruptly I was released, as quick as I had been grabbed at the beginning, hey,
wait, I&#8217;m not through, you just don&#8217;t acknowledge that violence has ended and
all is well, my running gait didn&#8217;t miss a &frac14; step on the way to the parking
lot, when I reached the parking lot a park ranger was standing at the edge.
Having stopped, and trying to catch my breath, the ranger said why were you
running so fast, and why the fear in your face? I said you would not believe me
if I told you, he replied &#8220;try me&#8221;. So I related the account to him, and he
replied to me &#8220;you went down in that cave?&#8221; &#8220;yes&#8221; I said. He said that not even
the rangers go down into that cave. I am a Christian, in my belief the Bible
says the Holy Spirit resides in me, and is my protector in spiritual things.
The Bible teaches a believer is to &#8220;know the spirits, and to test the spirits
to see whether or not they are from God, and a study of demonology is a
legitimate pursuit when studying theology. My point in all this is 1. Demons
are real an vehemently opposed to humanity, and<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>2. For a Christian, be careful how much you delve into your studies in
demonology, and regarding those who have other beliefs, who delve into what
is<span style="">&nbsp; </span>not seen, the other side knows more
than you, will not play fair, and know &#8220;good guy, bad guy&#8221; much more than our
law enforcement officials. I Corinthians 15:1-4. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My name is Sarah and I'm 13
years old. I've always been sensitive to paranormal existence. One of the
weirdest experiences I've ever had happened about a year ago. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was going on a week trip
to Ohio with my best friend Courtney, her brother Dylan, and her pop pop (his
name is bill but since he's kind of like my grand father I also call him pop
pop). As we were coming into the area where we were staying at (Courtney's Aunt
Jamie's house) pop pop was telling us about beast man; half beast, half man. He
was said to have long arms that would drag behind him as he walked. I believe
in the paranormal, but this was just too stupid for me to believe. I let the
story brush past. A few days later we driving into town. To get to town you
have to go along a narrow road that over looks a wide river. Along the banks of
the river were large eroded rocks and were forming large caves. I asked pop pop
if he had ever been down there. "Oh yeah!" he replied, "In fact,
remember when I was telling you about beast man? Well, it was said one of those
caves was his home." I rolled my eyes, but his face got serious.
"When I was a kid, a group of my friends and I were playing in that river.
About an hour of playing we decided to rest in a cave, and in the cave we
rested in, we found a dead chicken." This was the first of my beliefs that
beast man, might have been real. The one thing that clued me in though,
happened two days later. Pop pop decided to visit his dad at the hospital,
leaving us at his father's house. Since it was summer Courtney, Dylan and I
were outside talking and goofing off. Down the street was this big beautiful
tree that over shadowed the sidewalk and a fence to a yard. For some reason I
was curious to go look at the tree head on, but waited till night fall to
finally give into my feelings. Dylan refused to come, so Courtney and I walked
over ourselves. As soon as I got under the tree I felt frightened, and Courtney
kept glancing nervously back to the house. What I saw in the yard moments later
made me freeze up. In the yard stood a black figure of, I believe, a man. I
wasn't seeing him head on, it was more of a second sight thing. I knew I could
only see him. His presence was intimidating. Courtney and I ran back towards
the house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">You might think that's
nothing, but as we were riding back towards </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, I told
pop pop of the house, but not of the figure. He told me that there was a road
behind that house where beast man used to walk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">thought until I remembered

long been<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">subdivided into a suburban

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">about to relate occurred a

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">At the age of about 12, I
used to babysit frequently in the suburban<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">housing development in
which I lived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We lived with our
backyard facing<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the backyard of the 200
year old farmhouse which now housed the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">developer and his
family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was asked to
"co-babysit" the developer's 8<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">year old boy with his 11
year old sister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought it odd that I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">should be asked to babysit
with someone just a year younger than myself<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">but I was to find out why.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When the adults had left
for the night, I asked the 11 year old girl why<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">her parents wanted someone
else to babysit with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told me
that<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">she didn't like to be alone
but didn't elaborate why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She seemed to
be<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the nervous type and I
gathered that that was the reason.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The house, in addition to
being over 200 years old, was furnished in<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">heavy, mahogany Victorian
furniture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The place<span style="">&nbsp; </span>did look a little<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">creepy with all that heavy,
dark ornate furniture around which seemed so<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">out of sync with the
relative simplicity of the old farmhouse.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">eight year boy seemed kind
of nervous too and was really loathe to go to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">bed in his small bedroom at
the top of the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did, however,
go<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">to bed reluctantly after
much admonishment from the two of us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We didn't care for what was
on the tube and the two of us spent the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">night playing board games
and talking about just about every subject.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I pretty much managed to ignore
the unsettling feeling that this house<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">gave me and put it down to
the creepy furnishings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The girl gave me
an<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">impromptu tour of the house
and seemed particularly intent on showing me<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said that she had to do her hair for
tomorrow and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">asked for me to keep her
company while she put a few rollers in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">said to me that if you
gazed into a mirror long enough, "you would see<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the nature of your
soul".<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We stood there, both
staring into the large<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">mirror while she did<span style="">&nbsp; </span>her hair.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As I looked, I saw, standing just over<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my right shoulder, a man in
an somewhat ragged, 18th century frock coat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">He seemed to be in his late
forties or early fifties, had almost<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">shoulder length, dark,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>greasy dishevelled hair that was thinning on<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">top.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His face was very haggard, white with great
dark circles under his<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">eyes and deep furrows
alongside his mouth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked somewhat
menacing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I must have looked
scared<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but when I blinked, he
disappeared from view<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">although I could still feel
him beside me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The girl said, in an<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">agitated manner,
"what's the matter, what did you see"?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">nervously that I'd seen
nothing, not wanting to scare her and thinking<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that it must have been
my<span style="">&nbsp; </span>imagination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Yes you did, yes you did see<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">something", she
countered,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I could tell by the
look on your face"!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Well, First let me tell you
the history behind the home my mother still lives in today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">In 1996, A man and woman
were both hooked on many drugs and whiskey. One day the woman found out she was
pregnant and that they both needed to stop all the drug use and so on. Well,
neither one of them would they tried but never succeeded, their child was born
1 month early and addicted to crack cocaine, it had a lot of problems, and
always cried. One day the man woke up to find his girlfriend gone and the child
still there. Which the baby was fine for a few hours fine enough for the man to
get drunk in peace. The little baby boy started crying uncontrollably so. The
man was so drunk and messed up on drugs he didn't know what to do so he took
the little child down into the basement and slammed it against the wall till it
stopped crying, after his drunkenness ware off he seen what he had done and
kill himself with a gun in the far corner of the basement. I am sure your
wondering how I know all this, the little elderly lady (my buddy) across the
street has been in her house for sometime, and was there when the landlord
found the bodies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Well, onto my story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>When we first moved into the home I had never
seen the basement, I am scared of basements and have been for a while, anyway,
the day the gas company was supposed to turn our gas on they never showed up,
and to keep us all warm me, my mom, dad and little brother slept in the living
room (which is directly over the basement) That night I had a dream of a baby,
and a man killing the poor child, and then in my dream it was as if I was in
the basement myself watching it happen and the man looked at me then shot
himself. Now mind you I didn't know the story of the house till the elderly lady
told me. Well, things were OK for a while I had forgotten the dream, until My
niece was old enough to talk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was 16 and 1 month
pregnant I baby-sat for my sister for extra money. Well, Emily (my niece) and I
took a little nap. When I awoke Emily was in her walker and at the top of the
stairs of the basement, heading down, I didn't even put her in her walker so I
grabbed her up and took her down to my aunts house 3 doors down from ours and
waited till my sister got off work. As my tummy grew, each night it felt like
someone was pressing on it I wasn't far enough a long for it to be the baby
moving so I figured it was my mind playing tricks on me. Emily sat between me
and my boyfriend (now my hubby) And looked at the closet door in my bedroom and
said "aww pretty baby" so I thought she thought there was a baby in
the crib I had set up for when my own child came. Then all of a sudden the
happy look on her face was gone she turned pale and started screaming "bad
jack, no leave baby alone" and cried for about an hour, I got scared and
took her to my mom where she sat looking at the wall and screaming bloody
murder. Well, I got big around 8 months along so I was clumsy of course and
fell all the time, Well one day as I was walking up the stairs to go to bed I
felt something trip me and fell backwards down the stairs. I made such a loud
noise my mother and boyfriend came running, all I could say was something
tripped me I swear it did, they laughed it off as if I was joking told my to go
up and lie down and I would be fine. The next day I realized I had to wash some
clothes and that meant going into the basement, very uneasy I took my clothes
and began to load the washer, as I checked to see if there was any clothes in
the drier so when my clothes were done I didn't have to take so long and unload
both, well there was and I was folding them for my mother when I heard it. A
voice said to me "He got what he deserved" I dropped everything and
went to run up the stairs when I seen it, standing in the corner was a manly figure
with holes in his jeans black hair and a flannel shirt checkered with black red
and gray, and he was looking at me. I froze and watched the figure come out of
the corner closer and closer I looked at the space between me and the figure
and the stairs afraid I would be to slow to run past it and up the stairs I
stood till I couldn't take it no more and I made a run for it, I seen it move
as I did and it ran up the stairs too, I remember when I shut the door seeing
his dreadful eyes looking at me as if he were mad at me for some odd reason. </span><st1:date year="2003" day="18" month="3"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">March 18th 2003</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> I gave
birth to my little girl, and things were fine for a while. When she was 3 days
old from all the pain I was in when I went to sleep I went to SLEEP! well that
night I heard her crying and I panicked I awoke to find my daughter face first
on the floor it wasn't her crying, but she was fine and wanted her bottle.
There is no way a 3 day old baby can get out of a bassinet, SO my thoughts were
whatever it was did not want my baby there. And I came to the conclusion that
"JACK" was still bothering the baby even after he killed him, You see
"JACK" left a note for whoever found him saying "He wouldn't
stop crying he got what he deserved, I no longer want to live without Joanna"
I was shocked when I did my own research and found out all this stuff on my
own, then My elderly friend across the street knew every little detail by
heart, The man was her son. I told her he was still harming her grandchild
after death and asked her what I could do to stop it before my own child ended
up hurt or worse. She said "Jack" never wanted a child and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he hated kids," which as I watched her
years fall I could see she missed her grandchild, I asked what would make him
leave. She told me to go to the basement and tell him his mother said to leave
me and the babies alone, I did one day in the daytime (IM a chicken) I screamed
his name I was now mad at him trying to hurt my child, and I seen it, he was
standing mabey 3 feet away from me, every hair I had stood up, I remember the smell
of cologne burning my nose and the stench of death filling the room as he stood
there staring at me as if to say I dare you to move, I couldn't say anything
and I made my dash right through him, when I ran through him I seen what
happened to that poor child and I ran all the way outside down to my aunts
house where my daughter waited. I couldn't do it, I was to scared. To this day
"JACK" still comes out, so does the poor little baby boy that lost
his life, and even in the afterlife he still harms that baby. I now am 18 years
old I am married and have 2 little girls I could never imagine harming one of
my children the way he did his baby. Not to long ago my mom went down in the
basement, and heard "JACK" tell her to get out. Then she had some
painters down there to paint the walls and they did. The next day they came
over to see if it needed a 4th coat of pain on the one cause of the (what they
though) was a rust stain didn't wanna go away. Long behold it was still there
the walls look very nice all except the blood stains that will remain. My Mom
says she hears the little baby cry at night he does not scare her it is when
the baby wails as if it is being hurt is when my Mom gets scared, she says that
sound will give you nightmares or when she goes down to find the blood on the
wall looks darker. I ask her why don't she move she says "Before I do I
wanna make sure that baby is happy" She is still there so I guess no one
will ever know if that baby was ever freed from his torture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This is for all you people
that don't believe in ghosts and spirts. My name is Britney. I am from </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Amory</span></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Mississippi</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. I was
real close to my uncle when he died about three years ago. Well I went like bad
depressive and sucidal when he died. I couldn't get it through my head that he
was gone and wasn't comming back. I wanted to wake up and it all be a horrible
dream. Everynight since he has died I see something come in my room when I'm in
bed. When it comes in the whole room goes freezing cold. I can't see a person,
but I can see an outline of his body. I am pretty sure that it is him that
comes in my room at night. I can hear him talk to me and everything. He will
talk to me for a little bit then lay in the bed with me till I go to sleep. I
wish that I could record this or show you something to prove that it is true,
but I can't see me selling someone out that means that much to me. When I talk
to him about things sometime hes proud of me, but when I happen to make him mad
he will through CDs across the room, swing the doors open, turn the light on
and off, mess with the radio, through my sheets off the bed, and things like
that. I mean if I was only seeing this imaige I would say this is my im
ination, but seeing things like this and talking to him I know that it is not
my imagination. I know that it is him there. No one else can seem to see him
though. I have had one other person see him at my house besides me. That was my
cousin Codi. He was about as close to him as I was and he has seen and talked
to him while at my house. So you can believe what you want, but they are real.
I used to not believe in things like this, but I have had a slight change in
mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My cousin used to stay with
one of her friends a lot on weekends and this house beside them claimed to have
demons in them. Well she said that she was there one day and April had to leave
early that morning to go to work. So she left Shandi there by her self. Well
Shandi's boyfriend was supposto come pick her up. When she was waiting on him
she feel asleep. Then maybe an hour later she was woke up when someone shut the
door. They started saying, "Shandi" over and over. Well she thought
that it was just </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Gary</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> picking
on her. So she acted like she was asleep still. Well the voice kept getting
closer and louder by the second. Well finally it reached the room with her in
it. Then she said she heard like right in her face. So she opened her eyes and
there was nothing there. With all the stories about the house behind them with
the demons she jumped up immediately and ran down the hall. She ran in the
bathroom and locked the door. She heard footsteps running down the hall and
then the voice started yellin her name again and beating on the door. She
picked up the phone and called </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Gary</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> to come
get her. Finally after about five minutes the knocking and voice stopped and </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Gary</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> pulled up
and she left and has never stayed with April agian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was in the bear tooth
yesterday and I was standing in the balcony stairwell because my baby was
crying. I was looking down the stairs then I looked back into the seating area
to watch the movie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I did I saw the
black figure of a child crouching down and it ran across the doorway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My children were the only children in the
balcony seating and they were in their seats.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were 5 women in the isle across and a mother and her daughter in
the front row of the balcony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I
peaked back in to see if it was my children, they were still in their
seats.....<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Hey Shadowlord, I'm 16
years old and live in Ventura, Ca with my dad and sister, but from the time I
was born to about 7 I lived on Hambden, Ohio where my dad was born (in
Madison), he's dead now but after reading your site about the mothman I
remembered a story he once told me that is creepy but he told me it with the
utmost seriousness and he would never have lied to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Around the same time
(1961-1963) my dad was about 12 years old and living in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Madison</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> which is
closer to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Virginia</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> than most
would think. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Madison</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> is pretty
rural (even moreso back then) with thick woods that isolated houses from
eachother. One day after coming back from riding his bike, my father was told
by his parents that he needed to put his bike in the barn because it was
supposed to rain. My dad hated it because the sun was setting and he was scared
but he did it anyway. He walked down to the barn, and as he walked by he heard
movement inside, he looked into the window and at first saw nothing, but as his
eyes focussed he could see the faint outline of something standing and looking
through his father's shelves and bags (maybe looking for food?) whatever was in
the barn took notice to my dad's presence outside and made sharp bird-like
movements with its head, and looked at my dad. what totally freaked my dad out
and caused him to run to the house was that whatever he saw had a large
beak!!!!!!. when he returned with his father the next day nothing was there but
there were signs that someone had been rummaging through the junk that had
collected in the barn over the years. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">what scares me about this
is that it happened around the same time as the sightings of the mothman, and
its in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> which is
really not that far from </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">virginia</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">.
(especially for something that can fly 100mph!!!!!) <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">thanks for reading,
shadowlord. im totally serious about this story my dad told me it when i was a
young boy and he would NEVER make it up. this is 100% truth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
