<P><B>Private Residence – Ilderton, Ont. – 1997(ish)</B>
<BR><B>oxbaker@sympatico.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; A friend of mine by the name of Ryan lived in a house in Ilderton.
I had never actually been there before but a group of us decided to get
together there one Saturday night before heading out to a party. As we
made our way through the house to the front stairs I noticed the door to
the front porch shut on its own. This could be dismissed as a draft or
something though I felt nothing of the sort. We went upstairs to Ryan’s
room and during the course of our visit heard several bumping and scraping
noises coming from the attic above us. He explained that the house was
haunted by the spirit of an old woman and that sometimes she would rock
in an old rocking chair that they had stored up there. When we decided
to come downstairs my eye tuned in to the fact that the same door to the
front porch that had shut on its own before had conversely opened a few
inches before my eyes despite the fact that it had appeared to latch firmly
when it shut earlier. We hung out for an hour or so with nothing else unusual
happened until Ryan and I moved to the back part of the house. I was sitting
on the couch talking to him as he played video games and for some reason
was looking at the doorway to a small washroom that is located there. Just
inside the doorway was one of those towel rings with a hand towel neatly
folded and looped through it. Out of nowhere the towel jumped off the ring.
It didn’t merely slip and fall to the ground as the victim of gravity.
It literally jumped out of my vision into the further recesses of the washroom
with enough force to rebound the ring off the wall several times. I mentioned
it to Ryan immediately and he shrugged it off as a regular occurrence.
I was reasonably perplexed at this point in time and soon after we started
putting our shoes on to embark upon our journey to the party. Running parallel
to the walkway inside the back door was a row of five hanging flower planters.
As I was putting my shoes on I noticed that these planters were turning
at a slow but consistent rate. As I took a closer look I was surprised
to note that some were gyrating clockwise and others counter clockwise.
A few months later Ryan’s family left the house behind for new digs but
I’ve always kicked myself for not returning to the place to investigate
a little further.</B>

<BR><B>The Canadian Albanian Hall – St. Thomas, Ont. – Feb. 3rd, 2001</B>
<BR><B>oxbaker@sympatico.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; I play in a band and quite often we have to organize our own
shows with some of the other local bands. To do this in my hometown you
must, quite often, rent banquet halls and such. On this occasion we ended
up renting The Canadian Albanian Hall. My earliest memories of this building
have it being used as a Lion’s Club during the 1980’s but my grandmother
claims that my grandfather (rip) knew a man whose last name was Sawyer
that lived there when it was still a farmhouse in the 1960’s. The only
thing she could really remember otherwise was that the Sawyers had a son
that was mentally handicapped in some way. The building still looks like
a big, imposing farmhouse but in the back left corner of the lots stands,
of all things, a castle turret. Regardless, the place is known by local
realtors to be haunted as my dad knows a few of them and has heard them
speak of it. As we were getting the place ready for the show I took the
opportunity to snoop around. The main floor was remodeled as you would
expect a banquet hall to be. I got a very unsettling feeling in the room
that held all the cleaning supplies. It was an urgent feeling that seemed
to make me want to get out of the room as quickly as possible. A visit
upstairs saw the place almost as if someone had just dropped their daily
lives, packed up, and left. It was in a total state of disrepair, had no
power, and one room had a bunch of 12” records scattered about the floor
(one of them being the soundtrack to Star Wars which gives a timeline of
1977 or thereabouts). The whole upstairs gave me the same sense of urgency
as the cleaning room and had no lights that worked so we bailed out of
there. At one point during the evening I made my way into the basement
with a few of my friends. At the bottom of the stairs was a large puddle
of water. I stepped quickly through it and found myself confronted by two
separate rooms side by side.&nbsp; Both of these rooms were pitch black
and I could see nothing but I did notice that the feeling of urgency had
swept across the room. I snapped one photo of both doorways, went back
upstairs, and finished up for the night. When I got the film back I was
puzzled to see that the room on left had a pair of rubber boots sitting
in the middle of the floor (upright as if someone was still in them) and
behind them was the vague outline of what appears to be a woman in a dress.
The outline reminds me of what the monster in the movie Predator looks
like when it is somewhat invisible. Everyone I’ve shown the photo to sees
what I see so I know I’m not a kook or anything.</B>

<BR><B>The Hermitage – Ancaster, Ont. – Dec. 26th, 2001</B>
<BR><B>oxbaker@sympatico.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;The Hermitage is a well known haunt in Southern Ontario. Everyone
in the area is aware that something there just isn’t right. I had never
been to it so one night I asked my friend Kate to take me there. The history
of The Hermitage revolves around one of the area’s founders building a
mansion there. One of the servants fell in love with his daughter but was
forbidden to take things as far as he wanted to. As the result of this
he hung himself on the property. People have reported seeing all kinds
of crazy stuff there as it is now a conservation area with an elaborate
series of footpaths.&nbsp; We went there at about 3:30am – there was zero
precipitation but it was very cold and very still that night. Kate’s husband
and another girl that was with us decided to stay in the car rather than
accompany us. We walked in past the gatehouse and straight down the path
into the forest. Almost immediately we heard footsteps pacing us in the
forest on the ridge to our left. Whatever it was would stop when we stopped
and resume walking when we did. It was definitely bipedal in origin and
was kicking up leaves and snow as it walked. The first time we heard it
I turned and shot a photo in its general direction. This photo came back
with a small bit of glowing mist in the bottom left corner of the shot.
This is odd because there was no fog present, neither of us were smoking
(anything), and I was holding the camera at arms length away and holding
my breath so my exhalation wouldn’t be misconstrued. We continued walking
and so did the third party. After about ten feet I took another shot. This
one shows the mist to be much more widespread and when you stand back and
look at the photo you can kind of make out a face of sorts. On we walked
getting more freaked out by the second when all the sudden I heard what
sounded like someone snapping their fingers directly beside my right ear.
I turned and shot a photo and this one shows a misty human-esque figure
suspended in the air with outstretched arms toward me. There is also a
face in the woods that kind of resembles an aboriginal person from days
gone by. It was at this time that the negative feelings took us over and
we decided to turn back. I took one more photo of Kate which turned out
mist free even though it was in the same spot and only seconds after the
last one. As we returned up the path I took a shot over my shoulder and
the photo was 100% mist. I didn’t know what was in the photos until a week
or so later but it certainly raised the hairs on my neck. Anyone wanting
a more detailed history of this place can check it out at http://www.hamiltonparanormal.com</B>

<BR><B>GHOSTS</B>
<BR><B>Roseforever58@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Several years ago my family moved into a duplex in Fenton Missouri.
Immediately we knew we didn’t live there alone. Lots and lots of strange
things happened daily. The dishwasher would turn on, the living room shades
would raise, the television would turn on, and my husband was always having
unexplainable accidents. Doors would fly open and hit him; things would
fall off shelves onto him. After a short time there a spirit showed himself
late one night. He said that he had owned the land many many years ago.
He had a son that was killed on the property. He said that his name was
James and for mr not to be afraid. My husband was very disturbed by the
happenings. People made fun of me when I told them what was going on. Then
some weeks later we had a visitor. A family friend. We were sitting at
the kitchen table just talking and he said that his grandfather used to
know the man who original owned the property where our home was. Guess
what his name was?? James. Soon after that day the strange happenings grew
more and more frequent and stranger. So many things were happening that
we ended up moving out of the place.</B>

<BR><B>Gridley Manor</B>
<BR><B>idman2000@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi my name is Eric. This story I'm about to tell you happened to
my aunt and uncle. They live in Gridley Manor. Gridley Manor is a retirement/assisted
living place. A lot of older people live there. Well let me get to the
story. Being that elderly people live there you would expect that some
day pretty soon they would die. Well this is what happened to a lady that
lived in one of the apartments. The lady was in her late 80's early 90's.
She died about five years ago. I'm not sure exact detail to her death or
the date.</B>
<BR><B>But when she died family, friends and neighbors gathered up and
divided her stuff up. As soon as everything under her name that belonged
to Gridley Manor was removed and her name taken off of everything my aunt
and uncle moved in to that very same apartment. Well it wasn't very long
after they moved in that they started having paranormal activities occur.
Things such as the shower turn on by its self, lights flickering by self,
strange smells. There was also a stain on the carpet that my aunt and uncle
tried to get rid of but to no avail. They later determined that the stain
was the exact spot that the old lady died on. To this day the stain is
still there.</B>
<BR><B>You can barely see it. Except for the times my aunt and uncles grandchildren
are over there. Now the "spirit" if there is one doesn't show its self.
The activity doesn't occur unless the children are there. Although the
stain is there all the time 24/7.&nbsp;&nbsp; The times I have been over
there have never encountered any of the strange things they have told me.
But when it comes to the stain, I have tried to clean it my self and it
works. But then a few hours or a few minutes later the stain would return
even when no one has been near that spot. The spirit has not caused any
harm so. So my guess it that since it doesn't harm and only comes out when
the grandchildren are there that its an guardian angel watching over the
grandchildren. If that is so then I want to thank the lady and God bless.</B>

<BR><B>He Doesn’t Believe, So Why Do These Things Happen to Him?</B>
<BR><B>tia1b@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My husband does NOT believe in ghosts, spirits, angels, the devil,</B>
<BR><B>anything supernatural...or so he says.&nbsp; For someone who doesn't
believe, he sure has had a lot happen to him:</B><B></B>

<P><B>Let's start with the house he purchased in 1975, in Carnegie,&nbsp;
Pennsylvania.&nbsp; The house had been the residence of a group of Nuns&nbsp;
called Sisters of Charity.&nbsp; When he purchased this four story house,
it&nbsp; was full of trash, which he began to immediately clean.&nbsp;
While on the&nbsp; fourth floor cleaning, he heard singing and sighing.&nbsp;
His theory:&nbsp; the&nbsp; nuns approved of his clean up.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Fast forward to 1999.&nbsp; Across from our rental apartment is a
cemetery, a very large one.&nbsp; It's not particularly spooky, it is in
a residential&nbsp; neighborhood, and is not reported to be haunted.&nbsp;
It was so large, that&nbsp; the people in the neighborhood took walks and
ran around the pathways.</B><B></B>

<P><B>We were walking around in it one day, and he was joking about spirits.
He walked around behind a large cement crypt and knocked, saying:&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Anybody there?"&nbsp; My daughter and I were horrified and rooted to the&nbsp;
spot, staring at him.&nbsp; When he began to walk away we noticed that
his&nbsp; hand was bleeding.&nbsp; He looked at the blood and said, "how
did that&nbsp; happen?"&nbsp; He knocked on the cement, there were no trees
or branches, yet he had three distinct claw like scratches on his hand,
just above the knuckles he used to knock on the crypt.&nbsp; His explanation:&nbsp;
"Guess I woke someone up", he said with a rather evil looking smirk on
his face.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Six months later, he and his partner were giving a woman an estimate
on adding a porch to her house.&nbsp; The woman had purchased the lot adjacent
to her property and had the house on the lot torn down.&nbsp; What remained
was a cement slab.&nbsp; My husband and his partner were walking on the
slab when my 220 lb husband suddenly flew into the air and went about 30
feet, to the other side of the slab.&nbsp; His partner was frozen with
fear, because he said my husband literally flew, did not trip, over the
slab.&nbsp; He could not have tripped and stayed in the air that distance.&nbsp;
When asked, my husband was mystified.&nbsp; He said that he thought John
pushed him...he felt a push.&nbsp; His explanation:&nbsp; "The slab is
haunted dear."</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;"But, you don't believe in ghosts dear,” I said.&nbsp; He
laughed and said:&nbsp; "I know, it's the strangest thing, too."</B><B></B>

<P><B>We are all waiting to see what happens next.&nbsp; One year ago we
purchased</B>
<BR><B>a house built over 100 years ago.&nbsp; We are converting it from
a duplex to a single-family dwelling.&nbsp; When asked if we have ghosts,
he says:&nbsp; "Now honey, you know I don't believe in ghosts."</B><B></B>

<P><B>*Footnote: .&nbsp; (The Girl in the Field)&nbsp; A foot&nbsp; note
to the story:&nbsp; I talked to my sister, and it turns out that her husband
kept one picture, of a windmill in a field.&nbsp; She found it years later
in the garage.&nbsp; Her husband INSISTED that he had gotten rid of ALL
of the pictures and didn't understand how it could have shown up in their
garage.&nbsp; She says she put it out with the trash and it spooked her
to even carry it that far.&nbsp; It has not shown back up...yet.</B>

<BR><B>My Ghost Story</B>

<P><B>This really happened to me...it also scared the crap out of me. It
was about 2:00 AM and I couldn't sleep because I kept hearing creaking
off and on as usual. Then I suddenly heard a strange creaking in my kitchen
as if someone was walking through it into the hallway. It came up the hallway
and into my mother's room. About 5 seconds later I heard my mother's voice
and she said "Uh huh." and rolled over in bed. Then whatever it was walked
out of her bedroom and I could suddenly sense something in my bedroom looking
at me. And then I heard creaking down the hall and back out into the kitchen.
It scared me to death as I sat there thinking of what it could be but only
one thing came to mind. A spirit. I've felt cold in my room before but
that could be anything. And once my sister's electronic game turned on
without anyone touching it.&nbsp; Loads of times my dog looks up and her
head turns slowly as if watching something walk past. it's really freaky!
i'm not sure what it is but one things for sure…it goes unseen and isn’t
human!</B>

<BR><B>Old Wal-Mart Building in Forest Gallery Shopping Center - Tullahoma,
TN</B>
<BR><B>vcluelessb2002@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>We were in a new building and after a year of being there in that
building, all of the receiving crew was placed on third shift, due to trucks
arriving at night.&nbsp; Seeing things out of the corner of your eye was
common, we started blaming it on being tired.&nbsp; But most everyone would
see it.&nbsp; Then a woman I worked with said she had someone peck her
on the shoulder while she was putting up stock in automotives, alone.&nbsp;
We teased her about that and wondered if we'd see or hear anything.&nbsp;
Well, it didn't take long before a lot of people would see stuff fall off
the shelves, even stuff that was secure.&nbsp; The floor machines, buffer
and scrubber would turn on and off by themselves.&nbsp; Things sat in one
place, would show up in another, such as heavy boxes of anti freeze was
being stacked by myself and another girl when we went to sit another box
on top of those, they were moved over.&nbsp; We neither one did that and
figured it was our ghost, which since we'd see black shapes out of the
corner of our eyes, we nicknamed the ghost, the Nun.</B>
<BR><B>The floor guy, one night he was alone in the store, he heard a song
playing on the radio in automotives, and he didn't turn it on.&nbsp; He
went to turn it off; it still played, so he figured it was a tape, but
there were no tapes in the radios.&nbsp; He finally killed the power to
the whole thing to stop the song from playing over and over.&nbsp; Another
night, he and another guy was stripping the floor next to the toy department.&nbsp;
He told the guy to go get a bucket of water, which the guy left to do that,
when he saw the guy later in another aisle, but it wasn't him, because
he came from the other direction with the bucket of water.&nbsp; Another
night, he and another man had leaned their mops up against the furniture
display of a desk.&nbsp; They swept the store, came back and that desk
was gone.&nbsp; It was sitting up on top of the display, which was at least
four feet high.&nbsp; They both looked at each other and said, man, that's
not funny, well, neither had done it, because they both tried to move the
desk alone and couldn't.</B>
<BR><B>Another night one of the black balls up on the ceiling, had a face
in it. Thinking someone had gotten up on the roof and was trying to break
in, we climbed up to that ball and nothing was there, no face, no one.&nbsp;
In fact, it didn't go thru the ceiling, so no one could have been in it
at all.&nbsp; Another night we were all at lunch in the lounge.&nbsp; One
of the guys was interested in buying a stereo so he went to electronics
to look for one.&nbsp; This guy had been with us for four years and did
not believe anything we had told him. He said he would never believe that
place was haunted, until that night.&nbsp; He was in one aisle looking
when he heard someone walking in the next aisle. He went to see who it
was and no one was there.&nbsp; Nor did the alarm going into the department
go off while he was shopping.&nbsp; It worked because he set it off when
he went into the department and when he went out.&nbsp; That night he knew
we weren't seeing or hearing things.&nbsp; Another lady said she heard
a typewriter typing by itself one night, but no words were on any of the
displays.</B>
<BR><B>We learned the ghost wasn't a Nun, but an Indian.&nbsp; Upon checking
at the local library, we learned the store had been built either on an
Indian burial ground or an old Civil War hospital.&nbsp; We found out a
small creek had to be rerouted to build the store, so that could have been
the cause of the disturbances.</B>
<BR><B>One night I was in the stock room scanning merchandise.&nbsp; I
used what we called a scanning gun to run over the bar code to see if the
item would scan what it was priced at.&nbsp; I laid the gun down on the
desk, turned back to get it, when there was a face, an Indian, staring
at me.&nbsp; Then it faded right before my eyes, which the look on it's
face was like shock.&nbsp; There was nothing around the desk it could have
hidden behind.</B>
<BR><B>Another guy saw a face as well, in the upstairs stockroom, where
they kept layaways.&nbsp; It too faded. On nights when we had no truck
and all the filling up was done, we were allowed to go home early.&nbsp;
So one night we all were leaving, we had to stand in the foyer until the
alarm was set, when we all heard a scream from the back of the store.&nbsp;
Several asked, did you hear that?&nbsp; The manager on duty said yea, that
happens every time we lock the store this time of night.&nbsp; To me it
sounded like whatever it was, didn't wanna be alone.&nbsp; I will never
forget that scream and it's been years.</B>
<BR><B>One night the town turned the power off to work on a power station.&nbsp;
So from midnight until three in the morning, we had no lights.&nbsp; Some
of us decided to play hide and seek.&nbsp; Someone was hidden upstairs
and heard someone messing around on the truck we had been unloading.&nbsp;
Upon checking, no one was on the truck and hadn't been.&nbsp; After gathering
back at the service desk, one of the guys said something touched his leg,
but he was standing alone.</B>
<BR><B>One of the wildest nights was when we had two trucks to unload and
put up before morning.&nbsp; The night started off normal.&nbsp; The alarm
was set and we started back to the stock room when the lights went out.&nbsp;
Then the phone rang, but no one was there.&nbsp; These were only the lights
on the sales floor, so I told everyone to just come help with the truck.&nbsp;
One of the guys took a pallet of freight to electronics and came back and
asked was Ray there yet. Ray was one of the floor crew, the only one scheduled
to work that night, I said, no, he's not here yet.&nbsp; I asked why and
he wouldn't tell me, so I had to pry it out of him.&nbsp; He said when
he took the pallet out; he saw someone walked around in the women's clothing
department.&nbsp; So all the guys grabbed baseball bats and headed over
there, thinking someone had broken in.&nbsp; When no one was found, they
came back and we went back to unloading the truck. We sent the women on
out to put up what freight they could see to put up. The power came back
on and one of the women hollered at us that there was someone in the store.&nbsp;
So we ran up front but didn't see anyone.&nbsp; We called the police.&nbsp;
I let the police in the back door and they did a search, while a few of
us stayed by the back door, just in case.&nbsp; No one was found, so they
left.&nbsp; We went back to work, but the women saw someone again, this
time I was mad, because we weren't getting any work done, so we called
the police a second time.&nbsp; One of the police officers later said they
heard someone over in the garden shop but then heard them running, but
never could see them.&nbsp; After they left a second time, we finally finished
the trucks and we were all putting out freight.&nbsp; The girl I was teamed
with had a walkie- talkie and I heard one of the guys call another one
to come over to baby department because he needed help with some furniture.&nbsp;
Well, I knew something was up, because we didn't get any baby furniture
in that night.</B>
<BR><B>So I got one of the guys to meet me and tell me what had happened.&nbsp;
They found a ladder standing up in the baby department and a piece of the
ceiling tile moved, like someone had tried to get out.&nbsp; To this day,
no one on day shift believed us and the police couldn't find anyone, they
even searched the roof.</B>
<BR><B>Another night was very eventful as well and I remember it well,
because it was a holiday, Labor Day.&nbsp; That night things happened one
after another.&nbsp; I got paged to the baby department.&nbsp; I went over
there and the man that never believed had came over too.&nbsp; A new guy
was putting up the diapers.&nbsp; He never had been told of anything strange
going on, because at this point, we found it senseless to tell new people,
just let them find out on their own, and he did, that night.&nbsp; He heard
someone in the ladies' department and it sounded like they were moving
hangers back and forth on the racks.&nbsp; He thought I was putting some
clothes up but I told him I wasn't at the time.&nbsp; In fact, I hadn't
been over there all night.&nbsp; While we talked, we heard keys jingling.</B>
<BR><B>We ran in different directions but saw no one.&nbsp; Everyone else
was on the other side of the store.&nbsp; Once back in the stock room,
I was hanging clothes, it felt like someone brushed the back of my neck,
to which I had my hair pulled up that night.&nbsp; No one was around me
at all.&nbsp; Then we went to lunch, someone came up and told me that a
display of ink pens had fallen up at one of the registers, so I said I'd
go pick it up later.&nbsp; When I did, the floor guy had mopped earlier
in that spot, but where the ink pens had fallen should have been where
it was wet, they fell over where it was dry, so that seemed strange and
impossible from the way the display was laying.&nbsp; At that moment, I
was picking up the pens when I saw a black shape dodge down behind a pallet.&nbsp;
I yelled out to the floor guy, we ran to the area, he on one side, me on
the other, but no one was there.&nbsp; No one that night had been wearing
black.&nbsp; The rest of the night was the usual falling things, dark shapes
being seen and all that.</B>
<BR><B>One guy another night had seen someone walking into the stock room
with what looked like a bear skin rug draped over his shoulders.&nbsp;
Another guy felt someone pinch him on the backside, which we kidded him
about that one, but then he saw this thing walk right into the stockroom,
which I was standing there at the time and the doors that swing in or out,
swung open just before the guy came running in.&nbsp; So something was
there, cause there was no fans on in that area to blow the doors open like
that.</B>
<BR><B>One Sunday morning before the store opened, a manager came to let
the floor guy out from that night when he saw someone over in the hardware
department and thinking it was the floor guy, went to tell him he could
go home, but the guy came out from the back of the store at that time.&nbsp;
They never found anyone else in the store.</B>
<BR><B>The same manager said one night he was waiting to let the floor
crew in for the night (before we started working nights) and he said he
was standing at the service desk when all the toys started playing by themselves.&nbsp;
He said he went and waited in his truck for the floor guys.</B>
<BR><B>Another night we heard what sounded like a doll on the intercom
but the manager had everyone but us at the back door waiting to leave,
and he said no way was it any of them.</B>
<BR><B>Another night in the stock room, one of the guys saw a box moved
by a hand, but there was no one attached to the hand.&nbsp; Later he told
me his sister, who works the claims area on day shift, saw a microwave
move off a pallet by itself.</B>
<BR><B>This store is no longer the Wal-Mart, since it moved to a SuperCenter.&nbsp;
But once there, we experienced a few things, since it was only down the
road from the old store.&nbsp; A woman working in hardware saw the shadow
of a woman in a long dress and thinking it was a customer, looked up but
no one was there. One night I was in health and beauty aids putting up
freight, when I stepped up to my cart to get a box, I saw someone's tennis
shoes in an aisle up from me, but when I went to see, no one was there
and no one was in the area at all, but me.</B>
<BR><B>Another night some day shift people were in the garden shop getting
the Christmas things put out, when they came back from lunch, the displays
started playing, but they had no batteries in them, nor were they plugged
up.</B>
<BR><B>You'd see shadows in that store too, but I figured since it was
open at night, you just don't notice things as much.</B>

<BR><B>Nervous</B><B></B>

<P><B>I feel a little nervous writing this, but I guess I need some assurance
that I'm not losing my mind, but I feel I should give you a little background
before I tell you of my latest experiences.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess you might say I've always been "sensitive"
to atmosphere and certain areas for no reason, (or what I thought).&nbsp;
When I was about 2 &frac12; years old, (before the birth of my brother),
my family and I lived in an old house in West Palm Beach, Florida.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I believe it was 20 years old at that time and no negative episodes had
ever occurred in that house before.</B>
<BR><B>Anyways my sister and I shared a room and we slept on bunk beds,
she on the topmost and I on the bottom.&nbsp; Well I remember some nights
just lying awake and staring at the ceiling.&nbsp; A black bat-like shape
would go floating back and forth across it, it seemed almost transparent,
but retained enough of a shape to be pretty frightening.&nbsp; My family
later moved from that house after the birth of my brother and my mother
said that it was because of the neighborhood and the house seemed to have
a problem with ants.&nbsp; I never told my family what I saw, but last
year my sister, mother and I were wrapping</B>
<BR><B>Christmas presents for the family, when my sister blurted out, "Hey
do you remember sleeping in the bunk beds and watching this bat-like thing
circle the ceiling."&nbsp; I stopped and a chill ran up my spine, she described
exactly what I saw except that for her, it circled.&nbsp; I told her what
I saw and we both kind of laughed a little, but it unnerved both of us.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The second happening comes from the current house my parents
and sister still live in.&nbsp; The house was built in the early 20's and
is not in the best of shape today.&nbsp; My parents have to do a lot of
upkeep on it, but it has seen a lot.&nbsp; It was built by the family of
Lake Lytle, who in Palm Beaches heyday was a Commissioner, I believe.&nbsp;
My sister, brother, and myself, never felt really alone, even if my parents
had gone out and I have never felt uneasy about being in the house by myself,
it's the back apartments which seemed to cause me some fear.&nbsp; When
it was built, the Lytle's lived in what was called the "Garden District".&nbsp;
Well-to-do families built a number of houses here and the land for each
was quite sizable.&nbsp; The Lytle's built their house in front, and then
in back there was an open garage with a maidservant/driver's apartment
above it.&nbsp; They later converted it over to two apartments and the
next family who bought the property rented them out.&nbsp; When my mom
and dad bought the property, they did the same and my brother and I would
spend most of our time outside and would play in and around the stairway
and underneath in the tool shed.&nbsp; We never felt the slightest unease
until it got dark.&nbsp; We kept our bikes in the shed underneath the top
apartment and whenever we had to return them at dusk, it would be a race
to see who got in and out of there first.&nbsp; At first we would tell
ourselves it was because we were afraid of possums or rats, which would
sometimes get trapped in there, but later on, maybe a couple of years ago,
my brother confirmed that he felt like he was being watched and it was
always felt cool in there, not cold, just cooler than it should be.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Well I remember one day, after I had come home from leave,
(I was in the military at the time, I'm currently out and live in Alabama.)&nbsp;
My mom wanted to repaint the house and apartments, we did that for two
days and when it was time to clean up, she asked if I would go into the
top apartment and find a box, (it's now used for storage, nobody seems
to stay there long.), to put some of the excess equipment in.&nbsp; It
was dusk and I felt nervous, but I asked if it could wait in the morning.&nbsp;
She said she really wanted to clean this mess up, so I agreed a little
reluctantly, I didn't want to explain to her what I felt.&nbsp; It was
just her and I, so I had to go up there by myself.&nbsp; I remember climbing
the stairs and feeling the hair raise on my nape the closer I got to the
door.&nbsp; The sun was going down pretty fast, but I had a flashlight,
just in case.&nbsp; I managed to open the door after trying almost every
key on the ring and when it opened it seemed to be darker inside that it
was outside.&nbsp; I clicked on the flashlight, ran to the room where the
boxes were kept and then headed quickly for the door.</B>
<BR><B>Before I could get out, I felt a wave of sadness hit me and I stopped
and the feeling that I was being watched again got worse, I felt something,
a presence I guess, in back of me and I felt an almost uncontrollable urge
to turn and look.&nbsp; I refused to give in and started saying the "Lord's
Prayer" in my head.&nbsp; The feeling kept getting stronger, so I booked
it the last few steps to the door swung it shut behind me with a slam and
hurriedly tried to lock it.&nbsp; I had a feeling that if I didn't it would
be ripped open out of my hands.&nbsp; I then jumped the stairs and fled
to the house.&nbsp; When I got in and closed the door, I looked back at
the top apartment through the window, I didn't see anything move, but I
still felt like something was watching me from there.&nbsp; My mom came
into the kitchen and I almost yelled when she spoke.&nbsp; She asked me
what was the matter and I said nothing.&nbsp; I kept that to myself for
a while until the next time she asked me to go up there.&nbsp; I told her
it could wait until the morning and she asked why my brother and I were
so unnerved about going up there.&nbsp; I explained to her everything that
had happened, from the feeling of being watched to the almost unbearable
sadness.&nbsp; She confessed to me that when the owners after the Lytle
family had rented the apartments, they rented it to a young woman, who
later committed suicide there with a shotgun.&nbsp; I have never been up
there since.</B>
<BR><B>I have since had other feelings of being watched or something there
in other places, but they are to numerous to account right now.&nbsp; I
guess I should get on with my problem.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;As I stated earlier, I currently live in Alabama.&nbsp; When
I first moved here, my husband and I, now ex, bought a brand new house.&nbsp;
I was still in the military and he was on his way out to the civilian sector.&nbsp;
The house had been built on land owned by an older couple and when they
passed on, their kids sold it to developers with the stipulation that a
larger house be built for them there.&nbsp; We bought one of the back lots
and our backyard is shaded by trees.&nbsp; After the birth of my daughter,
I started experiencing weird dreams.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The first one, scared both my husband and I severely and I
can still recall it quite clearly.&nbsp; We had both gone to bed early
and had been asleep for hours when my I awoke to my husband shaking me
and yelling my name.&nbsp; He switched on the light by the bed and I started
crying.&nbsp; He asked me if I had been sucking on a cough drop or something,
because he said it sounded like I had been choking in my sleep, he had
looked at me and he could tell my eyes were wide open in the dark, because
the light from the kitchen stayed on and we left the door cracked to hear
our daughter cry out.&nbsp; It took him a couple of tries to calm me down
and then I told him what happened.&nbsp; I told him that I felt I had been
awakened by a dark figure standing in our doorway, I had tried to call
out, but before I could say anything, it seem to bend over my husband and
grab my throat.&nbsp; I felt like I was suffocating and then the next thing
I knew my husband was shaking and yelling at me.&nbsp; He turned my neck
from side to side , but there was no physical evidence of anything, but
that night and for the next couple of weeks, we slept with the light on
low.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The next one happened a couple of years after my divorce and
after our daughter had gone to visit her Dad.&nbsp; I was alone in the
house and it was very late, I heard something go running through the house
and a door slam. I lay there startled and tried to fall back asleep, but
couldn't.&nbsp; I looked at the clock at the foot of the bed and all I
could see was this dark indistinct shape.&nbsp; I stared and it seemed
to get darker.&nbsp; I tried to pull my hands out from under the covers
(One was across my chest, the other at my side), and found that I couldn't
move.&nbsp; I couldn't even make a sound.&nbsp; I could feel panic building,
so I started to say the "Lord's Prayer" in my mind, still struggling to
lift my arm.&nbsp; At the last verse I felt my arm move then I slowly reached
up above my head for the touch lamp by my bedside, but before I could reach
it, something grabbed my arm and I woke up in the same exact position,
staring at the clock.&nbsp; I still could not see it, so I thought to myself,
"Oh, man this cannot be happening again!".&nbsp; I tried to lift my arm
and again it would not move, I prayed and then it seemed to me I heard
a loud ringing, when I got to the last verse, I felt my hand shift, so
I hesitated before I lifted it to the light again.&nbsp; I had almost touched
the light when again something strong grabbed my hand.&nbsp; I felt like
I woke up again, or like a black cloud had been lifted, I could see the
clock now and I had been asleep almost four hours.&nbsp; I was drenched
in sweat, my body was trembling and heart beat was very erratic.&nbsp;
I knew I had had a panic attack, so I tried to calm down.&nbsp; I thought
about what I needed to do tomorrow at work, what needed to be done in the
house, anything that would calm me down. I started praying again and when
I was calmer, I got out of bed and searched the house.&nbsp; Everything
was where it should be and my cats were asleep, so I climbed back in bed
and left the light on low until I got up to go to work.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Since that night, I have experienced this one other time.&nbsp;
My fianc&eacute;' and I had just gone to bed, when he woke me up yelling
my name.&nbsp; He asked me what was going on, but he said I just whimpered
and fell back asleep, about an hour later I was startled awake by a noise.&nbsp;
I was looking again in the direction of the clock&nbsp; and I could not
see it.&nbsp; I started shaking and I ran through the Lord's Prayer in
my head as I tried to call out to my fianc&eacute;'.&nbsp; At first barely
a sound emerged, but then as I felt more threatened I became louder until
I ended on a yell, which woke him up.&nbsp; He went to grab me, when I
yelled again, because when he touched me a flash of light seemed to aim
straight at my head, swerve upwards, then disappear.&nbsp; He asked me
what happened, but I couldn't talk about it until the morning, but it felt
like that same episode a while back.&nbsp; I just knew that if I didn't
get some help, something bad was going to happen to me.&nbsp; The Lord's
Prayer always seems to help and I always say a prayer for protection before
I go to sleep, but these dreams seem to be so real.&nbsp; The one where
I was choking, I fully expected to see marks on my throat because I could
feel hands tightening and the others, I don't know, but I definitely feel
something malevolent.&nbsp; I understand that this is a pretty long E-mail,
but I hope you will take the time to examine it and shed some light on
why I'm having these dreams.&nbsp; I've always had a touch of insomnia,
but lately it has gotten worse because of what I might sense.</B>

<BR><B>Few paranormal experiences</B>
<BR><B>johnston@wpaccs.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; I was exploring your site, and I
find it very interesting.&nbsp; I hope that you'll believe my story.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've only had a few paranormal experiences, but
they have scared me.&nbsp; I am 14 now, and the experiences have started
only a year ago.&nbsp; It all started with the room.&nbsp; On the way back
to the bathroom in my house, you have to pass two bedrooms.&nbsp; It is
the second bedroom that I get bad vibes from.&nbsp; It always seems dark
back there, and I usually run by it to get to the bathroom.&nbsp; My bed
was moved back there, and I absolutely don't like it.&nbsp; About eight
months ago, I was in the bathroom showering.&nbsp; I heard footsteps heading
toward the bathroom, then they left.&nbsp; When I got out, the door was
open a crack (I always have it closed, on account of the bedroom).&nbsp;
Soon after that, my parents were in their bed watching T.V. when their
door opened by itself.&nbsp; No one was near it.&nbsp; After that, my dad
was in his room putting on socks, when he saw a little boy run out of "the
bedroom" and down the hall.&nbsp; My brother, my mom, and I were downstairs
watching T.V.&nbsp; About a month after that, I was leaving the bathroom
and I saw a shadowy figure go into my brother's bedroom.&nbsp; I ran to
it and look in the room.&nbsp; I saw the figure run around my brother's
bed and into the wall.&nbsp; That's all that's happened so far, except
for the fact that I occasionally have the intense feeling that someone
is behind me.&nbsp; I have that right now.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, when my brother and I were watching
T.V. and our mom was making dinner (my dad had to work late), a closed
and latched basement door opened not ten feet from us.&nbsp; There was
nothing that could have done that in the room.&nbsp; I believe that this
is my first hard evidence of a ghost in my house.</B>

<BR><B>Sanford</B>
<BR><B>jenndrew@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was a teenager my family and I moved to a large, beautiful
brick house in the country.&nbsp; We were told by the owners that the man
who built the house, around the turn of the century, loved the house so
much that when he got too old to live alone instead of going to a old folks
home he killed himself in the house.&nbsp; This, he thought, would enable
him to live there forever.</B>
<BR><B>We were told that we would hear things but that his name was Sanford
and that he was harmless. Sanford just wanted to make sure that his beloved
house was taken care of.</B>
<BR><B>So began our life with Sanford. Several times I was alone in the
house and heard someone walking in the hallway or doors opening. Every
once in a while you would swear you saw something out of the corner of
your eye. None of it was scary nor threatening.&nbsp; One evening after
I came home from my after school job I had just laid down in my bed and
I heard someone walking down the attic stairs. (My room was right next
to the attic.) Next, I felt a cold rush of air and someone whisper my name.
At first I was terrified but then realized it was just Sanford messing
with me. I just said to him, "Okay, Sanford, you scared me. But I am tired
and need to get to sleep because I have school in the morning." In an instant
it was gone.&nbsp; I got to where I would talk to him when I was home alone
especially when I would hear him walking around.</B><B></B>

<P><B>For a little while we had a woman who was renting one of our rooms
and I don't think that Sanford liked her very much. Either did I for that
matter. Things would disappear from her room and several times when she
would come home she would find her door unlocked and wide open. Of course,
I got blamed for these things but I didn't mind. It all made her move out.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Also, I had another paranormal experience when I was about 10. My
mom and stepdad told me that a friend of the family was buying and restoring
a very old restaurant/bar and they wondered if I wanted to go with them
to check it out. Being that I was 10 I really had no choice but either
way I wanted to go. I've always been interested in history and wanted to
check it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we got there we walked around and
it was pretty cool. Messy but cool. Finally, we went upstairs to the bar
and for some reason my stepdad refused to go into the bar. I didn't really
care and walked in and hopped onto a barstool. I was sitting there checking
the place out when suddenly I became extremely cold and nauseous. I thought
I was going to either throw up or pass out. I tried to get off the stool
but for some reason I couldn't. My mom frantically tried to find something
for me to drink to see if that would help at all but nothing worked yet
in the bar. Finally, she grabbed me off the stool and pulled me out of
the room. As soon as I got out of the room, I'm talking as soon as I went
passed the doorframe I felt fine. The whole time my stepdad was freaking
out watching the scene. (Coward wouldn't help) They finally decided to
tell me that the place was haunted by a horse thief that was hung outside
the place in the 1800's. He was taken from that bar and hung by a mob.
Since then he had haunted the place with a vengeance. He locked employees
in walk-in freezers, pushed people, obviously made people sick, and one
person even saw a floating head while he was walking down the stairs. I
found out later that after they opened the place and it got really busy
the mischievous deeds started to dwindle. But I recently heard that the
place is closed again. Wonder if he came back????</B>

<BR><B>Ghost Story</B>
<BR><B>jessica_acissej@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one of the scariest
ghost encounter I have ever had, this happened when I was about 6 years
old. My sister and I were both sleeping on the couch in the living room,
when all the sudden we both woke up. I was sleeping on the outside on the
couch and I looked up and saw a tall black figure standing right over me,
maybe about 5 inches away from me&nbsp; and about 6-7ft tall. His head
was very squared off and then it went straight down to his shoulders, which
were very broad and were also square like, and then it went straight to
the floor. Also, when i say black i mean it was blacker than the night,
couldn’t see through it at all. I always said that it was blacker than
black. I asked my sister do you see that? She said yea. And we were so
scared we couldn’t even scream or hardly talk. Then I&nbsp; look over and
my sister's sleeping. I tried waking her up so hard I was shaking her and
yellin in her ear but she wouldnt even move. The thing was still just standing
there over me, then somehow I just started gettin tired and i fell asleep,
and then 10 minutes later I finally woke up to my sister shaking me. And
she was saying that she couldnt wake me up for awhile. Then we were still
talking about it and it was still there just standing there. Then she fell
asleep again and then I just sat there awake staring off at the ceiling
trying to act like nothing was wrong but i was so scared.&nbsp; Then It
looked like It walked off into the other rooms and then it looked like
it kept reappearing at the front of the hall then walking out of sight,
then it would reapper at the beginning of the hall again. The I finally
fell asleep and I never seen that thing again.</B>

<BR><B>Several Ghostly encounters over the years in Melbourne, Australia</B><B></B>

<P><B>a_hubbs@bigpond.com.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>hello, My name is Adrian from Melbourne Australia.&nbsp; 2 years
ago, I lived in a small apartment in the inner suburbs (Windsor) and had
many unusual occurrences.</B><B></B>

<P><B>2 floors below my flat, an elderly man died peacefully in his sleep,
who I had befriended some years before.&nbsp; Then these things started
to occur.&nbsp; Firstly, although it is quite comical, and my friends thought
it was hysterical, I was washing the bathroom when I felt a knuckle press
quite hard into my thigh.&nbsp; odd, but nothing to come to strange conclusions!</B><B></B>

<P><B>All of a sudden things began to occur.&nbsp; I was living with two
backpackers from Scotland at the time, and they witnessed these events
as well.&nbsp; Ringing noises emanated from the kitchen periodically -
like the sound you make when you run you finger around a wine glass.&nbsp;
Knocking noises rang out though the hallway, Doors slammed occasionally,
and when I was alone, I had several low pitched whistles in my right ear.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My flat mates' window would open when they were out of the room,
(It had to be wound and pushed at the same time).&nbsp; One night Tracey
thought her boyfriend was waking her up, shaking both of her shoulders
quite violently, to find no one was in her room.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My partner and Tracey’s boyfriend both saw figures down the end of
the hall - near the bathroom and bedroom.&nbsp; Needless to say, they moved
out soon afterward (and to continue their journey around Australia).</B><B></B>

<P><B>The events happened for a few months after they moved then slowly
became less frequent.&nbsp; I still keep in contact with the couple from
Scotland, and we still shiver remembering the things that happen.</B>

<P><B>I am Dustin, I love the colors Black, Red and Grey.</B>
<BR><B>I love ghost stories, hauntings and horror films. When I was six,
i still remember the day, we lived in Ohio at the time, my sister was twelve,
we were walking home from school and we happen look up at her window and
an outline of a white figure could be seen staring out the window at us,
i mean it was White, it looked sad, when i turned around to look again
it was gone, we entered the house and ran upstairs to her room and sat
down wondering what we saw, when my sister gasped and looked in the hall,
a human shadow walked past the door and disappeared.</B>
<BR><B>Not only shadows and figures, but also my mom used to wake up at
nights screaming, she said things tormented her in her sleep, we found
that allot of bad things happened in that house, I used to feel I eas being
watched and turn around nothing was there, we moved and now live in Tennessee,
i have not seen nothing else yet, but i will never forget that place, no
one can convince me that ghosts ain't real, i know they are, i will always

<BR><B>Shadows of Death</B>
<BR><B>RavenProtected@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have lived across from famous Mountain Grove Cemetery on the Bridgeport/Fairfield,
CT line, where many 'knowns' are buried.&nbsp; Amongst them, P.T. Barnum
himself.&nbsp; We've resided here on Dewey Street for about11 years.</B><B></B>

<P><B>When my children and I first arrived to the house, The house let
us know how unwelcome we were via; clanging, banging, door knocking, pinches,
running, stomping and shaking me awake while I was trying to sleep.&nbsp;
On occasion there were actual sexual sensations towards me, the lady of
the house.&nbsp; At time it was so bad, I used to have the kids curl up
in the bed with me.&nbsp; The eeriest thing would be when all three of
my children used to sit up in the bed talking at the same time.&nbsp; I'd
finally had enough and announced that we were not going anywhere!</B><B></B>

<P><B>It was in this house that I developed a direct communication with
the dead versus the dream modes or whispers that they usually spoke to
me in.&nbsp; So direct, that one of the ghosts and actually the keeper
of the house --- introduced himself as Nicholas by leaving a rather large
colored photo of himself on the kitchen table.&nbsp; I didn't know it was
an introduction, we were all just baffled by who this was and who might
have placed this picture on the kitchen table.&nbsp; That same evening,
Nicholas showed up in the form of a dream. He spoke clearly of how this
was his house and how he had made everything that consisted of wood with
his own hands.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Nicholas was a short Italian man who could barely speak English,
but I understood him due to my being fluent in Spanish.&nbsp; After the
introduction the harassment stopped.&nbsp; Nicholas instead became our
protector.&nbsp; Examples of this might be: Waking me via shaking and/or
pinching, when intruders were on our property attempting to steal our vehicle.&nbsp;
And my all time favorite....the day after New Years where we were all sleeping
warm and cozy on a winter night when a&nbsp; slap came whaling across my
face.&nbsp; I opened my eyes to see the room filled with an orange glow.&nbsp;
That orange glow was the light coming from the house next door, which was
up in flames.&nbsp; Our home was hot from the heat since the wind outside
was blowing the fire over to our house. The windows had burst from the
heat. We called the fire dept and ran outside.&nbsp; The house has many
visitors. They each feel different and some are not nice at all --- but
that is where Nicholas intervenes, so they don’t usually stick around long.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am guessing that the reason for all the activity in our home is due to
it being such an old home, located across from the cemetery and under all
type of radio wave frequencies. Lots has happened here, some of it funny,
some just odd, some scary…..but this is our home and we have loved it over
the years and there is a sense of safety with Nicholas looking after us.</B><B></B>

<P><B>A couple of years ago, an Indian speaking in his native tongue visited.&nbsp;
I didn’t know what he wanted, I just wanted him to shut up and go away.
Instead a translator showed up on his second visit.&nbsp; He wanted me
to get his land back.&nbsp; I laughed, “yeah right”.&nbsp; He told me it
was located under Stop and Shop in Fairfield.&nbsp; I never forgot this
man, but I didn’t set out to get his land. As fate would have it, I now
do volunteer work helping the American Indian with his land claims.&nbsp;
I had forgotten this dream until one day during volunteer work, it hit
me.</B>

<BR><B>Sister or Illusion?</B>
<BR><B>cute_cuddly_latinchick@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi my name is Emily. I'm 15 years old. This experience happened to
me when I was 12.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was on the phone with my friend Theresa. At the same time I was
watching "jaws". I was getting pretty bored of the movie so I started to
walk towards my bedroom. I was standing in the doorway of my bedroom and
looking inside for some reason. Well inside my room were bunk beds. (me
and my sister Chloe shared rooms. I slept at the top and Chloe slept in
the bottom.) There was a storm outside when suddenly the lights went out.
I was still standing in the doorway of my room. I stood there for a couple
of seconds when I saw something move in my room. I looked inside and saw
a girl on the bottom bunk wearing my pants. (these pants were silver and
can really shine in the dark) The girl looked really like my sister and
I especially hated when she wore my clothes without asking so I got mad.
I started yelling at what I thought was Chloe meanwhile the "thing" stood
up from the bed and stood there staring at me. Seconds later, Chloe came
up from behind me and said " Em, who are you talking to?". After realizing
my sister was behind I quickly looked in my room. The girl was still there.
Then the lights came back on. To my surprise she was gone and my silver
pants were folded neatly on the bottom bunk.</B>

<BR><B>Something Strange</B>
<BR><B>geocrain@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Okay, I admit I am only 11 years old, but I have had some weird experiences.
When I was 7, I was up at Shaver Lake in California with my dad and brother.
I wandering through the woods with my brother when we encountered a old
raft. We dragged it back down to the lake and hoisted it into the water.
We jumped on. While my brother was soaking his feet in the water I was
pushed by something into the water. I didn't know how to swim and was sinking,
as I was underwater, something was there. I sensed it and saw a freaky
looking hand. My brother realized I was in the water and I was pulled out.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My second experience scared me out of my wits. It had been a tough
day of school and I decided to lay down on my bed. I wasn't home alone
because my parents were chatting in the living room. I was about to get
up when something pushed me hard in the face and I fell back onto my bed.
I felt cold and began to shiver a bit. I heard a slight buzzing sound.
I tried to get back up but was pushed down again, even harder. The buzzing
was filling my ears. I sprang up and sped to the living room.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The next didn't happen to me, but happened to my grandmother. I got
a call from my grandma from the hospital. She said she banged her head
and wanted to speak to my mom. After she was done talking I asked what
happened. My grandmother had a dream that a young woman in a white gown
was at the foot of the bed whispering water. My grandma got up and went
to the bathroom. She slipped on a puddle of water and banged her head on
the side of the bathtub.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well, that's everything freaky that happened to me and my family.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, I have been sitting here reading
these ghostly encounters for about 3 hours now and it has inspired me to
come out with what happened to me without fear of being thought of as a
loony. My name is Jen, I am 24 and I from Pennsylvania and this is my story:</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was

Steven was all I thought about day and night for the 2 years we were together.&nbsp;
Being with someone for 2 years in high school is like an eternity, we knew
it was real, and true love we had for each other. We even had our own special
spot on a hill, a</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place where you could over see the
whole town.&nbsp; We would walk there and he would put&nbsp; his arm around
me and say "this is our special spot, you're not allowed to come up here
with anyone else".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the summer of '93
when I was 15 that I started having dreams, bad dreams.&nbsp; I often dreamed
about Steve dieing, dreams that were so real that it would shake me up
until I received his morning calls telling me he loved me. 3 months later
after my first dream of this, I heard about an accident on a nearby route,
rumors spread about it being one person in particular....it was supposedly
a kid that Steven had caught a ride with to a neighboring town.&nbsp; But
I knew as soon as I heard the news that it was not the kid they were saying
it was.&nbsp; I went home and waited, it was soon after that I received
the call that Steven was gone.&nbsp; They'd had and accident and he'd been
ejected from the car, which caused him to break his neck.&nbsp; I was devastated
to say the least but that didn't cause me to have impaired judgment or
hallucinate.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day of
his funeral, my best friend and I were dropped off at my home, she tried
to make me laugh and keep me happy and was being successful at it.&nbsp;
It was then that I got the idea to share "our special spot" with her.&nbsp;
I lead her upon to the hill and as we neared the place where Steven and
I would over-look, I got very uneasy,&nbsp; my friend and I at the same
exact moment turned around and headed back.&nbsp; I didn't want to mention
it but I looked at her and said "do you....?" and without finishing my
statement of "do you feel that?" she knew exactly what I was about to say
and said "YES".&nbsp; We decided to flee from that spot,&nbsp; felt anger
in his presence and as much as I loved him, I was, for the first time scared
of him.&nbsp; I'm sure he's forgiven me by now, but my friend and I never
returned to that place, and I fear going alone.</B>

<BR><B>My Experience</B>
<BR><B>harrypotter_lrig@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is April and I am only 13 years old.
My family has recently gotten an akita puppy. As we were thinking about
what to name our adorable puppy, my mother took some pictures of her on
her digital camera. She called me into her room to show me the pictures
after she put them on her computer and the one picture she took was of
the white marking on her back. At first when I was looking at the picture
I was thinking," Oh, wow the marking on her back. How exciting" , but as
we looked at this picture we were both astonished to find dog faces. As
we continued to look the picture over we found countless dog faces. As
I continued to look as the dog faces I soon realized that the faces belonged
to our previous dogs. I told my mother this and she soon came to realize
it as well. I came to the conclusion that somehow the spirits of our previous
dogs were combined inside our new puppy. When I told this to my mother&nbsp;
I told her we should call the puppy Spirit and she totally agreed with
me. I know this is weird and doesn't sound like an experience at all but
it is entirely true. I would like to know if anyone else has had this happen
to them so I know that we are not crazy.</B>

<BR><B>My stories</B>
<BR><B>jpejic@bu.edu</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;When I was just a child my grandmother used to scare us kids
with stories of devils and evil. She did this to keep us away from the
windows at night.</B>
<BR><B>Her house was just on the road and you could hear everyone walk
by and talk, and as curious as kids are we'd always run up to see who it
is. Anyways, while I was at my grandmother's house I was always afraid
to go to bed alone so I usually waited up for my aunt to come with me.
One night my aunt decided to stay out in the living room and play cards.
I got really tired and could not wait up for her anymore so I collected
all the strength I had in me and walked into my aunts room and crawled
up in bed. As I was laying in bed I looked into the mirror that was right
in front of me to see this horrible face coming out of it. It was wrinkled,
bold head with horns. I coverd my face with blankets and fell asleep like
that. I do not know what this thing was. Was it my imagination? I've never
seen anything like that again.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Another thing happened though. While still that young I used
to sleep in my grandmother's bed because I was and still am terrified of
dark. One night I awoke to see her floating above me. I stared at the image
for few seconds then called "grandma" and she answered from right next
to me. As soon as she answered, the image of her in the air disappeared?</B>
<BR><B>There you go, you've got my two stories. I'm 19 now, and other then
those two events, I haven't had anything weird happen to me. Oh yeah, I
was SP-ed twice in my life. The most recent one was two nights ago after
I freaked myself out with all the ghost stories I read here :-) I'm almost
done with page 3, and I won't stop reading until I read all of it :-)</B>

<BR><B>A Ring and Its Master</B>
<BR><B>apokorimon23@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was at school sweeping the lunch room, I bent down to pick
up a piece&nbsp; of trash. Something caught my eye and picked it up. It
was a silver ring with&nbsp; a dragon on the front, embroidered with strange
curved lines. It seemed to have a hypnotic power but my friends, Nick,
Amy, and Michael, broke the gaze. I kept the ring in my pocket and t m
surprise I started making excellent grades on all my tests. Even after
school was over I found out that I was getting a horse-an Arabian stallion
named Raja. Later that day, I was in my room when I glanced over into another
room and saw something floating there. It looked like a man but indeed
had the face of some sort of animal. I was tired from a day of horseback
riding and decided that it was nothing. I soon found out it wasn’t. The
odd man started appearing in my dreams, calling out something like "There's
no exit! The ring..." He then started getting up close for I woke up one
night from a nightmare, plus my dog was growling. The man was standing
over me and I saw it was a wolf's face, a tattoo of a dragon on his arm
and was carrying a staff also having the same dragon on the tip.” The ring
now..." was all he said. I rolled over and jumped out of my room, closing
the door tight. My dog settled down instantly and we crept back in bed.
The next day I slid the ring on a necklace and kept it around my neck.
I still have it and the wolf-man still appears at night. He doesn't mean
any harm and is not frightening at all. Sometimes he even sits down, stroking
my dog and whispering us stories of the past.</B>

<BR><B>Encounters of my country</B>
<BR><B>aznkhan@lycos.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>In my country of Laos, there have been many mind-boggling and spine
chilling encounters with beings known as Poj Xyong in our langauge. Since
there is no english name for it, I shall be the first to rename it as the
Doppleganger Fiend. Below is numerous descriptions given by witnesses and
the many famous stories of encounters.</B>
<BR><B>DESCRIPTION:</B>
<BR><B>There are well over hundreds of Hmong people who have seen this
Doppleganger Fiend. It is usually described as a human size or sometimes
child size being covered with long hair all over. The hair may at times
look as if they were dead hair. The eyes of the fiend are turned vertically
while most living things have either round eyes or horizotal-wise eyes.
A group of over 30 Hmong men once killed one and claimed it was a female
with over 6 vaginas but the creature was only 3 foot tall. The reason for
the doppleganger name comes from the belief that these things have the
ability to imitate human beings and manipulate you in many ways. Most encounters
are by children under 18 who is manipulated by a figure portraying as their
parents.</B>
<BR><B>ENCOUNTERS:</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mother and her son were out in their
fields farming when the son complained of tireness. The mother told him
to go home and rest since their home was only 3 to 4 minutes of walking
away. Later as the mother came home, her son was not home. Her older daughter
says she never saw him come home. The village had all their men search
an area of at least 100 miles radius. After a month, they gave up. Then,
a few days after giving up, the boy was spotted by a couple in another
village about 200 miles away. When the couple approached him, the boy looked
as though he had lost his soul. They took the boy and later found his home
village. When the mother asked the boy what he was doing there and how
he got there, the boy replied that she was the one who brought him there.
No doubt something had imitated the mother and guided the boy there but
the reason was unknown. The boy was also old enough to resist strangers
and recognize his mother. The village folks concluded that a Dopplegan</B>
<BR><B>ger had manipulated the boy.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vang Thao died of illness. A Hmong ceremony
was held for him then he was wrapped up and placed outside ready to be
buried the next day. That day, it rained really hard. As a group of men
returned from chopping wood, they opened the wrapping to check if Thao
was wet from the rain. To their surprise, his eyes were opened wide and
looked odd. Afraid, they quickly buried him by nightfall. Then, a few days
later, something was attacking their pigs at night. At first, they thought
it was tigers. One night they decided to set a trap. When the gun trap
fired, they ran out to the pig den to check. To their horrorfied surprise,
there layed Vang Thao. He had fangs and long hair all over his body. Also,
just a few minutes after seeing Thao's body, another figure rushed out
of a dark corner in the den and out into the forest. It was later agreed
that Thao was revived by Dopplegangers and was hunting beside them.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This incident occured in Fresno, California
sometime in 1999. A funeral was being held for a recently parted Hmong
father. About 30 or more male relatives attended the funeral which was
held at a rented church. Sometime after 11 p.m., one last guest arrived
at the funeral. Outside just before reaching the church entry, he saw a
small figure suspiciously looking through the windows. When he called out
to the thing, it turned around and attempted to run. The man took one look
and quickly recognized what it was. As he was calling for help, everyone
inside came out to see what was happening. A few others grabbed nearby
steel pipes and beated the creature to death. All night they examined and
discussed what happened. By morning, they each took a piece of the creature's
body to use for an anti-doppleganger ritual at home. In Laos, many elder
have been trying to get ahold of at least a doppleganger hair to use for
this ritual. At last the ritual is performed all over Fresno among</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;the Hmong people. But, those who saw the creature that night
began to suffer nightmares involving the creature demanding it's body back.
In fear, they brought all the body parts back to the exact church and burnt
them. The nightmares stopped but the incident will never be forgotten.</B>

<BR><B>Strange Event</B>

<P><B>I used to work a part time job cleaning offices at a large&nbsp;
Professional Bldg.&nbsp; I had only worked there for a few weeks when strange
events starting happening.&nbsp; I worked on the fourth floor.&nbsp; No
other cleaning personnel besides my supervisor had access to my floor.&nbsp;
I would come back from getting supplies and find my vaccuum cleaner missing.&nbsp;
Sometimes my jacket with my keys would disappear just before I was set
to leave,&nbsp; causing me to take extra time to search the floor for them.&nbsp;
Radios and fans on desks would turn on and off for no reason.&nbsp; Occasionally,
the smell of freshly brewed coffee would fill the floor.&nbsp; The coffee
pots that were already cleaned could be found to be brewing new coffee.&nbsp;
The strangest think was this.&nbsp; Almost a year to the day of my grandmothers
death I was vaccumming an office and there was some paper on the floor.&nbsp;
I picked up the paper and to my horror it was my grandmothers obituary.&nbsp;
For the next week or so I must have picked up her obituary a dozen times
off of one floor or another.&nbsp; It was like it was following me.&nbsp;
I contacted the person who worked in the one office in which I first found
the Obituary.&nbsp; She had no idea who my grandmother was and couldnt
explain how it got in her office.&nbsp; No one at the job new about her
death since it had happened the year before I got the job.</B>

<P><B>I'm currently in 11th grade, and at the time this happened I was
in 6th. It was Memorial Day, and since we remember those who died for our
country, I was thinking of a 2nd cousin of mine my dad and great-aunt told
me about who was killed in the Vietnam War .Again, I was thinking about
him, so I decided to go to my room for some privacy.&nbsp; There I "prayed"
to him, telling him I thought of him and what occurred, etc. When I was
done, I felt a strong presence in the room, then heard a guy talking to
me.&nbsp; As you might guess, I looked around, but no one else was there.&nbsp;
It was my 2nd cousin!&nbsp; He heard me and responded, saying he’d been
watching me my whole life, and loves me!&nbsp; I was more thrilled than
scared. In fact, up to this day, he still comes and sees me from time to

<BR><B>The Basement Bedroom</B>
<BR><B>khcrowley@cs.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>It all started about ten years ago when my half sisters came to live
with us for a little while. We have four bedrooms in our house, and one
of the ones in the basement is haunted. My mother laughs at us, but all
three of us girls have had similar experiences while alone in the room.
My sister Elizabeth was sleeping down there one night when she was about
fifteen. It was late, around 2 am, when my sister suddenly awoke. She could
feel hot breath on her face and had the feeling of a body floating over
her. The presence was screaming something at her, about two inches from
her face, but she had no idea what he was saying. My mom came downstairs
with a flashlight because she heard the figure yelling. To this day she
swears that it came from the woods outside our house but Elizabeth knows
better. She sleeps on her stomach to this day. Kathryn, my other sister
came downstairs one night to go to bed . My mom had just made the bed,
I mean about fifteen minutes before Kathryn went down there. She pulled
back the sheets to find a huge dead cricket laying pristinely between the
sheets. My mom is a neat freak and there is no way she would have missed
such an enormous dead bug, especially in a bed. I moved down to that bedroom
about five years ago. One night, I was woken from a deep sleep with a feeling
of uneasiness. I felt hot breath in my ear as my own name was whispered
by an unseen man. I turned my light on and sat straight up to find I was
alone in the room. We have all gotten the sense that a man was floating
in the room, and that he is a malevolent spirit. We all also believe that
our grandfather is protecting us from this man .My grandfather died in
'98 and the sightings of the specter have all but stopped. Just last week
I found out that a man drowned in a swimming pool that was right where
my room used to be. Now everything makes total sense to me. The only exception
is that we still don't know why he is angry, but we do know that we don't
want to find out.</B>

<BR><B>'The black-shadow man'</B>
<BR><B>rwimason@smartchat.net.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>this story of mine, to me, was only a small one. well, that was until
i spoke to my mum, oma, my aunties etc, then I realized the ghost in our
house had been around for quite a while... I’m only 16 now, but when I
was eight I woke up one night for no apparent reason. I felt cold, but
it was the middle of summer. I rolled over, so now I was on my side facing
the wall, and tried to get back to sleep. my eyes were open and I was definitely
awake. I black, shadow-like man was on my wall. I stared for a bit, as
I thought I was dreaming. I was awake, and this was no dream. I quickly
turned to my window to see if there was some one outside and this was just
there shadow. (I had my curtains, blinds and window slightly open as it
was summer) no one was there. I jumped over&nbsp; the end of my bed and
ran to mum and dad's room. I’ve never moved so fast. White as a ghost when
mum turned on the light, she asked what was wrong. I explained. My parents
both took me back to my room to check it out. Nothing was there, at all.
My room was hot again, not cold. Dad said I was dreaming, but mum looked
like she believed me. she placed a bottle of holy water in my room and
made me wear my gold 'Jesus on the cross' around my neck. Dad thought this
was such a stupid waste of time. my dad, the big non-believer.</B>
<BR><B>a month passed and I was sleeping in my bed once again. I woke,
cold again. i heard my sister, who was six, scream loud, followed by the
sound of vomiting. then only i heard the run. Some one ran passed the hallway.
I got up to see my sister. she was throwing up over her bed, crying. I
screamed for mum. mum and dad woke and came out. my sister said she woke
up coz she was cold and at the end of her bed, standing in the door frame,
a black, shadow man was standing there, then a little gremlin giggled and
ran in and crawled under her bed. Dad, again, said it was bad dream. me
and mum could only stare at each other. my sister was scared that bad it
made her sick, didn't this make dad see? I guess not. mum did the same
holy things with my sister. Still, we both didn't feel safe.</B>
<BR><B>Nothing had happened for a long time, but it was only last year
it came back to remind us he was still around.</B>
<BR><B>My sister&nbsp; was thirteen now, I was fifteen. it was the school
holidays. I went out for the day, mum and dad were at work, but my sister
stayed home and invited a friend of hers over for a swim. She tells me
they got out the pool and after sitting in the sun, came inside for a drink.
As they walked in they both saw a man run through the hallway.. then she
said they ignored it and got there drink. Just as they were returning to
the backyard, all the door handles in the house started turning and shaking.
my sisters friend started to cry, and our dogs ran inside and barked and
growled at the hallway. my sister grabbed the cordless phone and ran out
the back with her friend. she called my mobile and i headed home straight
away. when she told me, I remembered the man from when i was eight. my
friends who came back with me thought it was a joke. but it was no joke,
only my sister and me know that we have a ghost, and a bad one.</B>
<BR><B>nothing has happened since, till today. this is why I looked up
ghosts and found this site.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;i have a picture frame on my wall with lots of photos of me
and my friends. today I woke up, got dressed and thought some thing in
my room looked odd. the frame was missing. weird thing is, it hangs on
the part of my wall where I first saw 'the man'. I found it behind my little
dresser. the glass was smashed, so obviously it had fallen. I told mum
when she got home from work and asked if we could get the glass fixed.
she seemed shocked that it had fallen. she looked at the hook and said
that there is no way in hell it could have just dropped. scared, I have
to agree. she told me that she was eating breakfast this morning and heard
the toilet flush. thinking it was one of us girls, she didn't do much.
then it flushed again. she got up to see which one of us kids were up.
not one. we were both sound asleep in bed. my scared mum left for work.</B>
<BR><B>i slept in, so did my sister. when I got up I looked at my clock.
2:22pm. geeze, it was a big sleep in. then as i walked to the toilet, the
time in the microwave said 4:16pm, the oven, 5:12pm, then in the lounge
room, 12:08. what was it? i was so confused. then a friend called. he told
me the time in the lounge is the right one.</B>
<BR><B>mum and me are a little lost about what happened today, but i know
it's 'the man'.</B>
<BR><B>now the history....</B>
<BR><B>when my mum was a little girl, she lived at home with her&nbsp;
three other sisters, one who was mentally retarded, and her mum. my opa
left my oma when she was only young. anyway, my oma and the girls moved
house after the divorce. during this time, oma bought and old wardrobe
from a second hand store.</B>
<BR><B>after being in the new house for nearly six months, my oma woke
up one night cold. she walk over and closed her bedroom wi ndow. she didn't
feel tired, so she thought she'd have a cup of tea and do some reading.
first she checked on the girls. all asleep, or so it seemed. she had checked
one room where three girls were, then the next, which was my mum's. (being
the oldest she got her own room, it was smaller than the other, but it
was her own.) she was in bed, asleep. then as my oma headed towards to
kitchen, not knowing why, she turned to the front door, only to see my
mum walk in. not just inside though, she walked through to actual wood
door. with a blanket wrapped around her she walked back to her room. my
oma was yelling her name, but my mum kept walking as though no one was
there. my oma was in shock and didn't sleep that night. she sat in the
kitchen till morning. she told the girls what happened and my mum was amazed.
"i never went for a walk, and i cant walk through walls" my mum said. oma
believes a ghost took my mum's form, but what did it do outside while being
my mum?</B>
<BR><B>a month later more weird things started to happen. pots and pans
flew around. it sounds like something out of a cheap horror film, but it
happened. my oma, mum and aunties dont speak of this to anyone. only who
they know wont laugh or think them to be weird.</B>
<BR><B>after a year of strange things, it stopped.</B>
<BR><B>my mum was now older and was moving out with my dad to a unit. she
moved out, taking with her the wardrobe. the nice old wardrobe with the
mirror in the middle and the pretty gold handles and the evil spirit. nice
wardrobe.</B>
<BR><B>mum and dad had only been in their new little unit for a week and
already dad had to take off south for work. mum was a bit afraid to be
alone in her new house, so she asked her mum to stay. the other girls found
friend's places to stay at. that night, when my mum and oma were in the
bed, oma woke. there in the mirror of the wardrobe was a prist all dressed
in white. she couldn't hear him, but i looked like he was reading from
his bible. he climbed out and stood by oma in the bed. oma pushed and yelled
for my mum to wake up. she didn't, which is strange due to the fact that
she is a very light sleeper and will wake at a whisper. after a few minutes
he climbed back in the mirror and faded away. then my mum woke up to find
oma sweating and crying. she explained what happened to mum and they both
stayed awake and did not sleep.</B>
<BR><B>mum and dad had many little 'get togethers' at there unit and most
friends and family say that the house is cold, especially the bedroom.
(where the wardrobe is)</B>
<BR><B>mum and dad moved out. they moved into the house we are in now,
with the wardrobe.</B>
<BR><B>they had been living here for three years. nothing strange at all.
then i was born. yep, now that is strange! he!</B>
<BR><B>I was two years old, and my grandad died. (my dad's dad).</B>
<BR><B>mum, dad and me went to live in grandad's old house to fix it all
up to sell. we rented this house out to my aunty, (mum's sister) and her
boyfriend. we left our dog (rot weiler) with them to look after while we
were away for the eight months.</B>
<BR><B>whilst my aunty was here, the strange things happened once again.
one day her and her boyfriend had finish eating dinner and sat down to
watch tv. our dog ran in the house, which is weird because the door was
closed. she started to bark at the hallway. my aunty got up to put her
outside, but just before she could say anything our dog was floating in
the air and then was thrown against my mum's bedroom door. the dent is
still there. my aunties boyfriend was frightened and called her a witch
and left her that night. my dog was okay.&nbsp; my aunty, upset and scared,
phoned her friend. they planned to go out the next day to forget about
what happened and the boyfriend. my aunty woke up the next day to her friend
knocking on the door. when she answered the door the friend laughed. "what
did you do to your hair?".. my aunties long hair was out big, like she
had been electrocuted. her face was white and her eyes were red. they were
both scared. her friend took her to the church to be blessed, as she thought
she was possessed.&nbsp; and soon to find out, she was. after being at
the church for two hours my aunty was back to normal.</B>
<BR><B>she soon left our house. she thought it was haunted. our dog came
to live with us for the two months we were still away and our house was
kept empty.</B>
<BR><B>we came back.</B>
<BR><B>i good night's sleep back at home mum was waiting for. she fell
asleep as soon as she hit the bed. i guess it was good to be back. that
night she woke. a black haze was in the mirror. mum stared at it till morning
and then it faded.</B>
<BR><B>the next day, dad came home from work. mum had some friends over
and they were moving the wardrobe. "what are you doing" dad asked. "chopping
the thing up. it's haunted, and i hate it" mum answered. dad couldn't argue
and helped. it was chopped up and then burned.</B>
<BR><B>the end? not by a long shot!</B>
<BR><B>behind the flames, mum and only one of her friends saw a little
black man running back and forth, laughing. not to worry, thought mum,
it's burned, it's over. but it's out of the wardrobe and in our house.</B>
<BR><B>not a thing happened again..... until i was eight.</B>
<BR><B>there may be more to come for me and my sister. mum never see's
it anymore and sort of doesn't believe the way she used to. dad, he still
laughs at me and thinks there's always a logical explanation. well if there
is, explain to me who the hell that black man is? and what does he want
with our family? i thought at first it was just a bad spirit in the wardrobe,
but it's out now, so why isn't it leaving?</B>
<BR><B>i want it gone for good, because there is no way in hell i'll let
whatever it is scare my kids. i hate it, but want to know so so so bad,
what it wants and why?</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;*if you know anything that can help me or any suggestions
on what to do, e-mail me....</B>

<BR><B>The Crossroads</B>
<BR><B>slippingaway6sic6@devil.com</B>
<BR><B>I have a story that I get goosebumps when I say it to people.&nbsp;
I live in Salina KS and this town is really boring so we do some stupid
things for our own pleasure.&nbsp; Well we have this place outside of town
called the Crossroads, and people go out there during the day and only
the brave go out there at night.&nbsp; Well me and a few friends decided
to go out there during the day, and we had no idea where it was, we took
directions from people nad we found it or so we thought.&nbsp; The Crossroads
is a burial ground for witches a while back and graves are there dated
in 97.&nbsp; Well we pulled into this drive and got out of my truck.&nbsp;
We then walked on a path for what seemed like 20 minutes.&nbsp; Then we
came to a worn down shack that looked scary as ever.&nbsp; and by the shack
was a house that seemed pretty new.&nbsp; there were beercans all over
the outside of the house.&nbsp; we went in and there were brown spots on
the wall that looked like dried blood, there was a pentagram drawn in the
center of the room, there were animal skeletons and&nbsp; door shut behind
us and we ran for the cars.&nbsp; when we got to them, an officer was writing
tickets and putting them on the windows.&nbsp; I asked him whats wrong
and he said we cant park there.&nbsp; i asked him what this place was back
there and he told us an old family lived there and they were burned to
death by something and they were all satanic.&nbsp; I found out a week
later that someone went back there and burned down the house, but i think
something else burned it down.&nbsp; weird huh?</B>

<BR><B>The Day Benito Died</B>
<BR><B>wandie_girl@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was about six years old when my aunt's husband died.&nbsp; I distinctively
remember it because my grandmother knew he was going to die exactly that
day.&nbsp; Benito was bedridden with terminal cancer.&nbsp; He was sent
home to die after a long stay at the hospital.&nbsp; I was at my grandmother's
house when my aunt came to pick up some lunch.&nbsp; My grandmother had
the ability to communicate with the dead.&nbsp; I remember grandma giving
my aunt a crucifix she had on top of her headbed.&nbsp; My grandmother
told my aunt to place the cross over Benito's bed and to rush home becuase
"it was time".&nbsp; My aunt knew about my grandmother's psychic abilities
and asked her if Benito was going to die that day.&nbsp; I sensed that
my grandmother wanted to spare her the grief of knowing but was giving
her the gift of being there when he passed.&nbsp; My grandmother only answered
her to hurry up and just go.&nbsp; My aunt left and when she reached home
her husband wasgoing on, going about the room.&nbsp; I don't know why but
I knew Benito was there.&nbsp; I told my grandmother.&nbsp; She knew it
too.&nbsp; My mother scolded me because I was scaring my sisters.&nbsp;
But I couldn't help it I knew Benito was there.&nbsp; Many years after
this, my family and I moved to my aunt's house when she died.&nbsp; My
mother inherited the house.&nbsp; In more than one occasion my mother bumped
into the shadow of a darked complexion man that will just appear at different
places in the house.&nbsp; I told her it was Benito.&nbsp; This would happen
very frequently for about two years after we moved in.&nbsp; Then he never
appeared again.&nbsp; I guess Benito finally datached from his home and
moved on to next level.</B>

<BR><B>The Doll</B>
<BR><B>leclaircom@inter-networks.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I never really believed in "ghost stories" until I experienced one
myself. I don't remember it all to well, because I was really very young.
We had just moved our new house, and it was very nice. One day my mom had
dropped her earring onto the floor, she bent down, but she couldn't find
it. She started to search the whole house, with my older sister helping
her. After a few hours of searching, she gave up. When she had gotten up
off the floor from her searching, she turned around, and there was her
golden hoop earring lying on the table as if someone had set it there very
politely. Always things were disappearing, then appearing again in the
most obvious of places.&nbsp; But the most chilling story of that house,
was when I was playing with my doll in my bedroom, and I got mad at it,
so I threw it out the doorway in disgust. My mother turned around to pick
it up, but it wasn't there. In fact in wasn't even in the house anymore.&nbsp;
It had gone all the way down the stairs, around the corner, and into the
front bushes outside. I was only around 3 years old, and I couldn't of
possably thrown it that far. That summer, we put the house up for sale.
There was a nice couple looking around the house, seeing if they wanted
to buy it.&nbsp; The man went upstairs, to take a better look around, but
not before long, he came running down the stairs, pale as a sheet, saying
"Is this place haunted"?&nbsp; Every summer after that, the house is always
for sale. No one has ever stayed more than a few months in that house,
without a for sale sign in the window.</B>

<BR><B>The experiences I've had could fill a book.</B>
<BR><B>pkelly62@comcast.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I grew up in a small sleepy all-American town. You basically knew
all your neighbors and went to bed without locking your doors. It was a&nbsp;
great town to grow-up in. The house that I&nbsp; can really remember is
still standing there in that town. The story was that it had been an old
farm house that was moved into town and put onto a cellar/foundation. This
was located three houses from a rather large cemetery. In the middle of
this cemetery was an old church. It wasn't used as a church any longer
but as the cemeteries office. Under the church was a large cellar that
a driveway led down to it. Rumor was that at one time slaves were hidden
there on their way to freedom. The farm house had most of it's rooms on
the first floor. But upstairs was the attic that had been made into two
bedrooms, three closets, and a hallway. Up till my parents purchasing it
the house had always been rented out to families. Now the earliest "scare"
that I can recall having was when I was about 8 or 9 and home with my mother
one night. My father worked the third shift at a plant in a neighboring
state and my half-sister was married and on her own. So we were all alone.
Having gotten ready for bed we were up watching television in the living
room. It was rather odd at that time of night to have somebody knocking
on our door. Plus it was the back door which meant that the person would
of passed the front porch and door to knock on that door. Well mum and
I went to the back door and turned on the porch light. 3 big windows on
the door showed nobody there. At that we turned the light off and started
back towards the living room.&nbsp; The house was built like an "L" shape
so you had to go thru the kitchen, dining room then into the living room.
Off of the dining room was a mini hall with two bedrooms and a bathroom.
The front door was straight ahead in the living room and we could see the
front porch. Mum quickly turned on the front porch light but nobody was
there. She figured it was neighborhood boys playing tricks on us. Mum knew
how to catch them. She turned off all the lights and television. She then
positioned us in the dining room where there were 2-5 foot high windows.
What we saw gliding( or you could say floating) by the windows on the outside
was a very foggy figure that looked like it was wearing a hooded robe.
It sort of glided towards the driveway and suddenly went poof!&nbsp; Believe
me there are tons more of stories. I lived in that house till I got married
and moved out. For 24 years I experienced all kind of things and even would
return there to visit my parents and would still have weird happenings.
Even my dog would growl and refuse to enter rooms.</B>

as an instructor, sniper.&nbsp; In college I worked with a Professor who
was a part time Ghosts hunter, Dr ******* has written two books - The lively
ghosts of Maine and the Restless Ghosts of New England.&nbsp; My Alma Mater
has the distinction of being one of the most Haunted Campus' in America,&nbsp;
Nordica Auditorium, The College Theater and the old Alpha Sig Omega Frat
house are all "occupied".&nbsp; Until I worked with Dr ******* I was an
athesist - Did you know that Ghosts cure athesism??&nbsp; They do!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the past 19 years I have been a correctional
officer for the Department of Justice/Federal Bureau of Prisons At a middle
level Federal Correctional Institution in the southwest.&nbsp; The building
that is the subject of my letter is our Prison Chapel.&nbsp; In the early
seventies an Officer named "Don" took one last overtime as chapel officer.&nbsp;
The chapel officer supervises Free World volunteers and inmate services
also asists the Chaplains.&nbsp; At 8:30pm the Chapel Officer runs the
inmates out of the chapel to the main "compound", escorts volunteers out
and signs them out in a log book, after that he/she searches all areas
inmates have had access to "shaking down", then locks up the chapel, reports
to the Senior Officer on the compound for another duty assignment untils
shift change at midnight.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapel is considered
"piece of cake" over time so "Don" took it.&nbsp; This night about a dozen
members of a&nbsp; radical black group NOI - Nation Of Islam jumped him
and stabbed him to death with home made knives (shanks) the officer was
bludgeoned with a typwritter and a fire extinghuisher, he was decaptitated
- this was in Feburary 1974.&nbsp;&nbsp; Prison Legend has it that "Don"
will stay on duty in the chapel until the last of his attackers are dead.&nbsp;
He is stuck there and so are the killers until the last one dies.&nbsp;
As of this writing two are surviving.</B>

<P><B>One summer evening last summer it was HOT and dry and the evening
shift was ready for trouble.&nbsp; After the last prisoner count of the
evening we all "kicked back" for a while. One of the&nbsp; gun towers notified
Control Center and the shift Lt we had movement in the Chapel.&nbsp; Two
of our mobile patrols drove around to the chapel and the tower officers
trained their weapons on the chapel area - we recounted the housing units.&nbsp;
Again we had a good count.&nbsp; Lt F&nbsp; took a group of officers into
the chapel there were eight of us, we drew riot batons from control center
and the Lt had a areosal can of mace.&nbsp; We popped the door on the chapel
and heard organ music coming from inside, as we entered the building we
heard footsteps running into the sanctuary area.&nbsp; We stormed the chapel
hitting the lights as we went - Nothing.&nbsp; Just a building locked up
for the night.&nbsp; the Lt sent four of us to the other side of the building
to check the offices as the others searched the sanctuary.&nbsp; maybe
five minutes later things started.&nbsp; We were searching a walk in storage
closet when a chrome plated music stand rose up turned in the air and drove
its self about three inches into the wall between lt ******'s legs.&nbsp;
The organ started playing or just someone banging hard on the keys.&nbsp;
We rushed the big unlocked doors four of us, four big strong men with backgrounds
in police , military , boxing and football.&nbsp; The doors were unlocked
we could SEE it wasnt locked&nbsp; but it would not open.&nbsp; At this
point maybe ten hymnals started dancing on the back of the pews to the
organ music.&nbsp; We heard Officer D scream.&nbsp; We forced the doors
and ran to her we saw her on the ground being (there's no other word for
it - raped by something invisable.)&nbsp; Officer P had been kicked in
the groin and shoved against the wall.&nbsp; Officer R was tripped, Officer
J was thrashing the air with her baton trying to connect with Officer D's
attacker.&nbsp; The doors were slamming and opening in sequence.&nbsp;
Lt F&nbsp; hit the area with mace and was hit by a chair.&nbsp; Officer
B and I ran back into the sanctuary and filled two Styrofoam cups with
holy water, we ran back to the office area and I said "I order you in the
name of Jesus Christ to stop what you are doing and leave!&nbsp; God almighty
who I have blasphemed and not believed in so many years I am pleading the
blood of Jesus"!&nbsp; I threw my cup of Holy water at where I thought
the attacker would be.&nbsp; Everything stopped.&nbsp; It was like pulling
the plugged on a stereo it just died -dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We gathered everyone up and Officer B was our rear guard with his holy
water.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PA checked us out.&nbsp; Officer D had scratch
and bite marks on her breast. Officer L had black and blue marks on his
thigh and slight swelling in his groin.&nbsp; Officer R had black and blue
marks on his knee where he had been tripped.&nbsp; LT F had two stiches
in his forehead.</B>
<BR><B>We submitted memos with photo's of the incident.&nbsp; We were all
given three days stress leave.&nbsp; Bureaucrats do not like bad press
.</B>
<BR><B>We&nbsp; think the destruction of the old dorms the changing of
the prison with a full moon maybe triggered something.&nbsp; All the dorms

<BR><B>But yes this story is true.&nbsp; Memo's were written and turned
in along with pictures of the injured staff and damaged to the chapel.&nbsp;

<BR><B>The Hay Wagon</B>
<BR><B>oatmealcooky@surfglobal.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I first moved here, in July or 1978, it was the last dwelling
on a dead-end dirt road; if a vehicle came by it was coming here and when
we heard wheels on the gravel, we would go to the window or out the door
to see who was arriving.</B>
<BR><B>In October, an odd thing happened several times.&nbsp; Wheels were
heard on gravel, accompanied by the rattle and creak of a venicle, perhaps
pulling a trailer or heavily loaded (obviously coming down the drive),
when we looked out, no one was there and the sounds stopped. It was puzzling,
but since it only happened for a few nights, we forgot about it.&nbsp;
The next year it happened again; and the next. by the fourth year we were
waiting for it and nothing!</B>
<BR><B>By this time I'd been keeping a record of what time, date, etc.
were involved and we saw that in the three previous years, the weather
had been clear and the moon full. The fourth year, the weather was drizzly
through the three full moon nights.</B>
<BR><B>The fifth year, was overcast the first night, but expected to clear
by early evening of the total full-moon night.&nbsp; We had several friends
in to wait with us and by eight o'clock, the sky had cleared amd the moon
shone brightly.&nbsp; At 8:47 PM, sure enough, we all heard creaks and
rattles coming down the drive.&nbsp; One of my guests, a minister, impulsively
jumped up and went to the window. Immediately, all sounds stopped and did
not resume that night.</B>
<BR><B>The next night, several people stationed themselves at vantage points
around the yard to wait.&nbsp; Nothing happened.</B>
<BR><B>The next few years were similar - always at the full moon in October,
only if the night was clear, only if no one was in sight - one year I even
rigged a periscope arrangement so I could spy, and nothing.</B>
<BR><B>A lot has happened over the years. I was divorced and live here
alone now,; the road was extended and homes were built a couple miles beyond
me and many cars drive by.&nbsp; Nowadays, someone moving here probably
wouldn't notice the sounds, but they still come.</B>
<BR><B>In researching my property, I find that there was a farm here from
5 years before the American Revolution.&nbsp; The Old farmhouse burned
down about 50 years ago and my house was built on the site.&nbsp; In the
woods, just over the bank are stones of a ruined barn foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The full moon this month is 10 days away and if I'm not too busy, I might
stop and listen for them.&nbsp; I kind of like them and in my mind's eye,
I can see a farm family bringing in the last of the hay by the light of
the harvest moon.&nbsp; If I listen carefully, one of the sounds is like
the stamp of a large horse's hoof and some of the clinking is very much
like harness jingle. As I see it, this was their home first and since they
don't seem to mind sharing, why should I.</B>

<BR><B>Hide and Seek Ghost</B>
<BR><B>boochconley@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I just discovered your site and I'm fascinated by the stories there.
I've always been very interested in ghosts/ghost pictures/ghost stories
and I've always been disappointed that there are so few well made ghost
movies out there. Anyway, here's my story. Well, I've actually seen a number
of things in my life, but this is the most interesting story I have.</B><B></B>

<P><B>From about 1988-1991, my family lived in an old house in Wisconsin.
The house we actually lived in was built in the 1800's, but it was not
the original house on the property. The original house was built even earlier
and had at some point been converted into a garage.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The house we lived in was a two-story farm house (if you don't include
the basement and attic) built in an old German style. The walls were thick.
The windows were old, wavy, recessed, small, and many were stuck fast from
years of paint. The ceilings had sagged in a number of places, so they
were wavy too.</B><B></B>

<P><B>When my parents told the previous owners that they intended to buy
the house, the wife pulled them aside and said she felt obligated to tell
them that the room at the end of the hall of the second floor was haunted.
She said that she often felt cold spots there. My parents thanked her kindly
but behind her back thought she was crazy.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Before we moved in, my Dad and I went to the house to touch up the
paint. While there, we heard a strange humming noise. We went through the
house trying to locate the noise, and finally found that it was loudest
outside the attic door.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The attic of this house was incredible. The door leading up to it
was in the middle of the second floor hallway, between my room and the
"haunted" room. If you opened the door, it led into a small hallway which
led to another door. Upon opening this door, you reached the steps to the
attic. The attic was huge and dark. It was constructed of giant rough-hewn
logs. The logs in the ceiling had ancient nails sticking out of their bottoms.</B><B></B>

<P><B>What we discovered in the attic was a huge swarm of bees- thousands
of them. Their humming could be heard through two doors and foot-thick
walls. Throughout my time in the house, we had problems with bees fighting
to get into the house. Also, my uncle, one of the few people in my family
to believe in ghosts, was afraid to go into the attic, though we never
told him anything about it, and our dogs often barked at the attic door,
though they rarely barked at human visitors.</B><B></B>

<P><B>After that, we moved in uneventfully. Eventually, my Mom got pregnant
and my parents decided to turn the "haunted" room into the baby's room.
This room was the only room in the house that had not been decorated by
the previous owners or my parents. It was panelled in dark wood, with gaps
between the panelling. (My parents attributed the cold spots the previous
owner mentioned to the gaps, but the walls in this room were just as thick
as everywhere else and other rooms without cold spots were only painted
with no panelling.) Before my parents decorated it for the baby, the room
was dark, small, and felt abandoned.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My parents painted the room peach and decorated it beautifully. However,
once born my sister didn't sleep in her lovely room because she had night
terrors when placed there. (Night terrors was the name the doctor gave
to our new baby waking up screaming and sweating.)</B><B></B>

<P><B>Now we get to my main story. One day, my parents asked me to babysit
my sister. She was at the age when she could toddle a bit but not walk
well, and I was a teenager in high school. Once my parents left us, I put
Sarah (my sister) in the sunroom where she could play safely and I went
upstairs to clean out my bathroom closet.</B><B></B>

<P><B>While cleaning the closet, I heard a clear knock on the bathroom
door, which was closed. The bathroom door was closed because it had to
be to allow the closet door to open. I assumed it was Sarah, so I called
out to her to wait a minute as I had to close the closet door and then
open the bathroom door.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I had closed my closet door and was reaching for the bathroom door
when I heard another knock. It was very forceful, which surprised me as
my sister was so small. I flung open the bathroom door as I thought she
was upset and found...nothing.</B><B></B>

<P><B>As I stood there shocked, I had the feeling that I should look down
the hall to Sarah's room, though I didn't see anyone go that way. As I
did, her door slammed with great force. I was again surprised as the doors
in the house were very heavy, especially for a small child to slam.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I assumed Sarah was playing tricks, so I went down the hall saying,
"I'm going to get you.." I reached her door and flung it open, but again
saw noone. The room was small, so there was but one place for her to hide-
the closet. I strode to the closet and threw it open saying, "gotcha!"
But she wasn't there.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was then overwhelmed by a strange sweet smell that I can only describe
as being similar to artificial coffee creamer. I was suddenly struck with
the sense that I should leave that room immediately, which I did.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I then ran downstairs to the sunroom, where I found my sister peacefully
playing.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Now, as I stated, most of the windows in the house could not be opened;
they were painted shut. None were open that day. Also, noone was in the
house but my sister and me, and she was too small and too weak in her walking
skills to have gotten downstairs before me.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Suffice it to say I never liked sarah's room after that, and I never
told my doubtful parents.</B>

<BR><B>The Kiss Goodnight....</B>

<P><B>Well, let me start by telling you that I have had several experiences
my whole life.&nbsp; My family has as well (my grandma, mom and aunts and
uncles).&nbsp; I believe in ghosts, my house I grew up in had them, but
that is another story.</B><B></B>

<P><B>This one happened at my grandma's house in Salem, Illinois.&nbsp;
My mom and I had just flown&nbsp; there from California to help out my
grandma.&nbsp; She was about 94 or 95 at the time.&nbsp; I was maybe about
25 years old or so at the time.&nbsp; My aunt was there too, helping out
as well.</B><B></B>

<P><B>That first night, I slept in the living room, on the couch (there
was no way I was gonna sleep in the spare room by myself, my uncle had
recently died in there, and he's the sort that would like to play all kinds
of pranks on a person).</B><B></B>

<P><B>My mom and aunt and my grandma all were sleeping in the back bedrooms
of the house.&nbsp; I laid down to go to sleep.&nbsp; I could hear them
settling down for the night.&nbsp; I heard someone come back into the living
room, and I could feel them standing over me.&nbsp; I felt them bend down
to give me a kiss goodnight on the cheek.&nbsp; I felt the imprint of their
lips and the moisture from their lips as well.&nbsp; I was so tired, and
I didn't want to open up my eyes and talk.&nbsp; I played "possem" and
pretended to be asleep.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The next morning, I told my mom that I felt her give me another kiss
goodnight.&nbsp; She looked at me real funny and said that she didn't come
back into the living room last night.&nbsp; She said maybe my aunt had
done it.&nbsp; I asked my aunt, and she said no, she hadn't been the one
that kissed me.&nbsp; We all know that I wasn't my grandmother, because
she was too unsteady and wouldn't have been able to bend over to kiss me
like that.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I think that it was my grandpa.&nbsp; He died when I was 16.&nbsp;
It could have been my uncle too, but I still think it was my grandpa.&nbsp;
I still can feel the kiss on my cheek, even after all these years, my loving
kiss goodnight....</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Laughing Woman</B>
<BR><B>christmaseve1965@netscape.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is a story my Uncle told me about that happened when he was
a boy back in the late 40's. He said that they had went to visit his grandparents.
(as they usually did) He said, he and his brother and a cousin were all
playing upstairs. (at the top of the stairs) He said he and his brother
were on the top step facing downstairs. His cousin was on a lower step
facing sideways towards the open hallway in direct view of one of the bedrooms.
He said they had been playing for a little while when he noticed that his
cousin was looking towards that particular bedroom like he was in a trance
or in shock or something. He said he kept trying to get his attention,
but no luck, so he decided just to turn and look the way he was and there
inside that bedroom just inside the doorway was a woman with long white
hair touching the floor.With NO Legs!!! She was standing on her hands swinging
her torso back and forth and when she noticed that he also saw her, she

<BR><B>The Phantom "Car"</B>
<BR><B>laura@job-e.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>One Sunday night not too many months ago....I was out with my carbon
copy, my four year old daughter Shaunnessy. She'd had a late nap and I
decided to tire her out with a shopping jaunt for life's necessities and
a drive through some of our secluded suburban woods near the park and an
historic cemetary (which I captured some ectoplasm on film from, but that's
another story!)</B><B></B>

<P><B>It was about 11:00 PM and we had seen a few possums, a little raccon
family, a handful of deer, and an armadillo. We do this often, looking
for animals and then pulling over to watch them and quietly talk about
them and how they live, what they eat, factoids, really, enjoying quiet
conversation and being together sometimes over a snack.</B><B></B>

<P><B>We had just finished watching the raccoon family cross the road and
play in the ditch. I pulled up to the intersection, turned past the cemetary,
and then onto another secluded wood-covered road. This road had given us,
particularly the kids, the "creeps" on occasion. This is odd, because my
mother lives in the middle of the National Forest and we live out in the
'burbs, so a lot of our time is spent in the boonies. It was very nice
outside and as usual, we had the windows open and the radio off. It was
very dark and this road is fairly straight. At the end of the road, it
is cleared out some and you can see cars traveling on the next busy street
and if they turn you can watch them pull onto this road. We had been driving
slowly up and down this road, pulling over when we would see the reflection
of eyes to see whatever creature we had found and watch it for a while.</B><B></B>

<P><B>We had just crossed the first bridge when suddenly, "headlights"
appeared at the end of the road. I had seen no car turn onto the road,
no silhouette showing brakelights or signals, no glare of headlights arcing
through a turn.</B><B></B>

<P><B>As it approached, it was silent. I had pulled over just after crossing
the bridge. Something just wasn't right. These lights weren't the usual
white glow, so i thought they must be the new halogen bluebrights, but
no, something still was off.</B><B></B>

<P><B>They had no shape consistent with the major car manufacturers. Almost
perfectly round. And they showed no signs of bumping up and down on the
potholes of this oft-washed-out road.</B><B></B>

<P><B>As it got closer, I judged its speed to be about 35-40 MPH. I noticed
I could see none of the amber parking/fog lights framing these headlights.
I heard NO engine. I could see no outline of a car body, but the outline
of treetops BETWEEN the lights. No license plate, nothing. No grill. No
shiny reflective painted metal.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Shaunnessy and I watched silently in awe as it passed. As it went
by, we heard or felt no passing wind; again, we heard no engine, no wind,
nothing. As a matter of fact, we could still hear the water gurgling in
the creek. I watched in my panoramic rearview as it passed and Shaunne
turned around to watched. We were almost trancelike....and as it came even
with my Jeep.......the lights disappeared.....no noise....no wind......no
taillights.....no glare of headlights in the treetops behind us. just......gone.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I didn't say anything as I din't want to scare my daughter. I just
took off slowly and said, "I think we should get back home now."</B><B></B>

<P><B>"OK Mommy, but let's come back soon and look for that spooky car
again."</B>

<P><B>For as long as i remember, I have been plagued by mysterious 'shadow

thing is that I suffer from depression. since I went on medication and
got counseling, the 'shadow people' have disappeared.</B><B></B>

<P><B>There are also other things. I used to have 2 male Guinea Pigs.&nbsp;
Those who own male g-pigs know that they are very territorial. Anyway,
Their names were Rudy and Splash. Rudy died in March 2002 of unknown causes...
he had seizures and no vets offices were open, so he died. Anyway there
was a particular arm of the couch where Rudy liked to sit and be petted.
One day I was holding Splash and he looked right at the arm and began chattering

<BR><B>The Silhouette</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;tresivor@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>About seventeen years ago (that would put me at about seventeen at
the time) I had become really close friends with the couple that lived
next door to me back in L.A. I was the typical adolescent, struggling to
find my identity and wanting to grow up so quickly. I spent allot of time
at my neighbors home, just hanging out with them. But I knew I gained nothing
by lying and my parents had taught me well. Therefore I believe</B>
<BR><B>I am an honorable person.</B>
<BR><B>One evening I was with my neighbor Arlene, in her living room and
watching television. It was late enough that it had been dark outside for
a while. Unexpectedly, the electricity went out leaving us in almost total
darkness.&nbsp; The only light visible came from a streetlight on the sidewalk
outside their house. It shone through one door into the room but offered
NO helpful light. Arlene stood up and made her way slowly toward the door,
feeling her way and talking to me for reassura alone. I was met by a silhouette
of a figure leaning against one side of the door frame. The figure lifted
it's arm and took a long, deep drag off of a cigarette. The cherry glowed
bright in the darkness and a fresh cloud of odor filled the room.&nbsp;
I admit the figure startled me at first sight. I figured it had to be Arlene.
The figure appeared dwarfed by the frame of darkness. I asked her what
was wrong and why the lights were still out. The figure simply continued
leaning there without a word. I sat forward in my seat and turned toward
her.</B>
<BR><B>With obvious concern in my voice I asked, "Arlene, what's wrong?
My heart sank into my gut as the figure shifted and stood up in the doorway
with a very low grunt. It was tall, broad shouldered and most definitely...
a man...</B>
<BR><B>Now I was scared and that's when the realization flooded me... I
was alone. My mind started to race with everything I should do and that's
when the lights came on.</B>
<BR><B>The man stanrried and living far away from that house in L.A., but
to this day I will NEVER forget that night and what I had experienced.
Sometimes I feel silly. I'm a grown man. But whenever I am alone in a dark
room I tend to shy my eyes away from doors... for fear that I will see
the silhouette.</B>

<BR><B>The Warning</B>
<BR><B>kaharris@lis.net.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>G'day, I live in Australia but on the North Coast of NSW. The area
I live in is loaded with the local Indigenous Tribe DreamTime. I know some
areas, which I wouldn't go anywhere near. Being a experienced Bushwalker,
I get to know about these things. There's a place here called Nimbin. Famous
for its' drugs and Mardi Grass. This place is actually cursed by the local
Aboriginals. The Rocks on the way into the village is weird. I want to
relate to you a Dream I had when I was 17 and living there in self imposed
exile. I was staying one night at a friends place which is situated directly
beneath these rocks. Let me explain briefly about the history of these
rocks. They are known to the Korries as the Gateway to DreamTime. The place
is haunted by ghosts and, this is no lie, but also guarded by a wise woman
and a Black Warrior. This dream I had concerns the Black Warrior. I was
given the verandah as it was a bloody hot night and given a mossie net.
So, I snuggled down and went to sleep. In this "dream" I found myself in
water searching for something in the sand. I remember looking around and
recognised where I was. Then I saw a light bopping along towards me. A
tall Black man with tribal scars across his chest and curly black hair
appeared holding a latern. In his left hand he held a spear. I watched
him float by and he watched me with dark eyes. A strange warning flashed
through my head. Leave the area. And I woke up. A few nights later I happened
to be in the local pub. Now I was NOT drunk but I was buying myself a beer
when I felt a hand touched me. I turned around and there I saw a Aboriginal
woman flanked&nbsp; by two black warrior with scars across their chest.
She touched myhand and said, You must leave here. Then someone called me.
When I turned to her...she was gone. One of my mates came up and said:
You alright? So I told what I wrote above but he shook his head: No, man,
you were talking to yourself.</B>

<P><B>Probaly about 20 years ago, our landlords father died in the kitchen
of our small trailor. It is weird, because all by themselfs the screw on
lid of the sugar containor will just pop off and fly across the kitchen.
And this is a screw on lid. I am now 16, and about 2 years ago, my dog
had a litter of 8 puppies. 6 of 8 lived, one being a stillborn, and one
dying during the night. My 6 year old neice at the time swears to this
day, that she could see to young puppies playing in the hallway near where
they were born. We only kept one puppy, so that was impossible. The mother
of the pups was seen every once in a while, licking thin air. The dog,
is sometimes afraid to walk down the hall to my room. She will run back
into the living room. She will also hide. Sometimes things will disappear,
and I will get blamed for taking it when I wasn't even home. Then comes
back in a obvios place. It is sooo strange, but in a way feels cool.</B>

<BR><B>Three Experiences</B>
<BR><B>mluttrell@sanfelipecasino.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>The first ghostly experience I ever had happened when I was ten or
eleven. Out family was renting an old adobe house in Santa Fe, New Mexico,
and my sister and I shared a bedroom. My mother had decided to paint our
room and temporarily relocated us to the basement. I'd always had creepy
feelings about that basement, but could never really articulate why. The
particular room she moved us into had always felt strange to us kids. One
night I woke up to find myself out of bed and standing up with my hands
against the wall, as if searching. I'd never sleepwalked before in my life.
To my surprise, my sister was also out of her bed (though still asleep)
and doing the same thing; blindly searching&nbsp; the walls with her hands
as she shuffled along. I woke her up and&nbsp; we both went back to bed.
This occurred all over again for several nights in a row. Sometimes she
would wake up first and sometimes I would and we'd always doing the same
thing, except that she claimed to experience the feeling of insects crawling
all over her right after she woke up. It stopped when we were finally moved
back upstairs to our bedroom. Niether of us has ever sleepwalked again
and certainly not in synch like that. I know it had something to do with
the room we were in, somehow. We still talk about it to this day.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The second experience I had happened several months ago, while sitting
in my boss Phil's office at work. I was taking notes from him when we were
interrupted by another co-worker. While this co-worker talked to Phil,
I started randomly doodling on my note pad, watching them and waiting for
them to finish their conversation. The doodling turned to blind scribbling
because I was watching their faces, though not really paying attention
to what they were saying to each other. I'm not sure exactly, but I think
this scribbling action seemed to open up some kind of portal or something.
I say this because I got a weird, light vibrating sensation after scribbling
for a few minutes, and when I glanced from the co-worker back to Phil I
saw a woman standing behind him. There was a feeling of comfort and love
coming from her,&nbsp; directed at Phil. I looked quickly back at my coworker
to see if his face registered that a woman had suddenly appeared out of
the thin air behind Phil, but he just kept talking as usual. When I looked&nbsp;
back at the woman again she was gone.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I debated telling my boss about this for two days, since I was still
fairly new on the job and I didn't want him to think I was a nutcase. But
the woman and the sensations coming from her had been so strong that I
knew I hadn't imagined it. Finally I broke down and told him, hoping he
wouldn't think I was a fruitcake. To my relief he asked me to describe
her. I did and he asked if I would recognize a photograph. I said I thought
I would, so the next day he brought in a photo with 7 or 8 people in it.
I picked out the woman right away. He said it was his mother, who had recently
died after a long illness. A few weeks later he told me that the day I'd
seen her had been her birthday. He's asked me to please tell him if I ever
see her again, but so far I haven't.</B><B></B>

<P><B>A few weeks ago a similar thing happened. This time I was sitting
in an all-day meeting and was bored to tears. The guest speaker was droning
on and on, and I started doodling. Suddenly I saw a child (a girl) tugging
on the guest speaker's belt. She kept randomly tugging on his arm and belt
while he spoke to us, as if trying to get his attention. I knew she wasn't
a real person standing there because she would fade in and out and obviously
the speaker didn't see or feel her. There was a feeling of intense sadness
and neglect about her. Since I didn't know the speaker at all and wasn't
about to tell him what I'd seen or ask him about it, I never found out
who she was. I did tell my boss, Phil, since he hadn't ridiculed my previous
experience. There was no way to find out if the speaker had known a young
girl (daughter, niece?) who had died, without risking sounding weird.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have no idea why this sort of thing is happening to me now. None
of these incidences has scared me, but they do exasperate&nbsp; me. I'm
not sure what this is about and I'm a solid, down-to-earth and emotionally
stable person. I've never sat down and just randomly scribbled to see what
happens. I don't want to try that and I'm not sure why. I find these things
interesting, but I'm also not quite sure what to do with the experiences,
if anything. I'm definitely not interested in hanging out a "psychic" shingle
or anything like that. If anyone reading this account has had a similar
experience, I'd sure love to hear about it and how you deal with it. You
can e-mail me at mluttrell@sanfelipecasino.com&nbsp; Thanks for the opportunity

<BR><B>Toy ghost story</B>
<BR><B>tonybarry.ennis@eircom.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>In our town there is a raised part of land formed on a hill. There
are many houses and it is not a spooky place. There is even a&nbsp; nice
little playground. One day me and a&nbsp; group of friends,(Over 3)&nbsp;
were walking past a fairly&nbsp; modern house. I don’t know what possessed
me to look up into that window but I seen something in the corner of my
eye. In the top&nbsp; window staring out at us was a doll. She was dressed
in old clothes (Victorian style, blue.)With long black hair. She was pale
with black hollow eyes. It was so spooky. I informed my friends and they
agreed with me. The doll was so lifelike and spooky. The reason was she
was alive!!!!&nbsp; She stumbled backwards and as a curtain was blown back&nbsp;
she was still there staring at us. We all were kind of freaked out by this
and went home. In my house I mentioned to my elder sister what we had seen.
She sat there, perplexed. I thought she did not believe me. I asked her
what was the matter. She said” When I was about your&nbsp; age me and Sarah
(one of my friends who seen it sister) seen a freaky doll it spooked us
and inspired us to write a ghost story about her possessing people to fall
down the large flight of&nbsp; stone steps used to reach the street and
killed them”. Still not convinced I asked which house it was.” The second
one from the steps.” she replied. Shocked with terror I informed her it
was the same house. We never seen the whatever it was again. At least not
yet. Well it certainly was not a doll. And it certainly was not living....</B>

<P><B>Our house was inhabited by only one family previous to our buying
it.&nbsp; The man who built the house and his wife.&nbsp; They longed for
but never did have any children of their own.&nbsp; He farmed the land
and eventually died in the front bedroom of lung disease after years of
smoking.&nbsp; That was 10 years or so before we bought the house.&nbsp;
The wife sold us the house because we were expecting our 1st child and
she felt we would fill it with the children she didn't have.&nbsp; Nothing
unusual happened until after our son was born.&nbsp; He was about 6 months
old.&nbsp; His nursery was in the front bedroom.&nbsp; I returned to work
after he was born and took him to my sister-in-law, who watched him while
I worked.&nbsp; One morning I was bending over him in his crib, fumbling
with the zipper on his jacket, when as clear as could be, I smelled the
sulphur smell that follows a match being lit and blown out, as when someone
lights a cigarette.&nbsp; It was right over my shoulder, behind me, as
if someone was standing there lighting their cigarette.&nbsp; Yet I was
alone, except for the baby.&nbsp; My husband had already left for work.&nbsp;
It scared me so badly that I grabbed the baby, my car keys and flew over
to my sister-in-law's house post haste.</B><B></B>

<P><B>We had another son the following year, and also bought a dog, to
keep the boys and me company while my husband was away.&nbsp; The dog would
stand in the doorway to the kitchen, when no one was in the kitchen and
all of the hairs on his back would be standing straight up and he would
bark at the nothingness.&nbsp; It was extremely unsettling.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The size of our family grew to the point that we had to either move
or add-on to the original house.&nbsp; We chose the latter.&nbsp; We added
on through the original kitchen.&nbsp; We also acquired 3 more dogs.&nbsp;
To this day the oldest one will stand from the new side of the addition,
looking into the empty kitchen and bark with his hackles raised at 'something'
in the old kitchen.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The most recent occurrence of something unusual happened about a
month ago.&nbsp; My aunt had come to visit on a Sunday, my sons are now
away at college and my husband was out.&nbsp; My aunt and I were sitting
in the new dining room, which comes out of the kitchen, I was sitting with
my back to the kitchen entrance, she was facing the kitchen.&nbsp; We have
a picture at the end of the table, which has a glass covering over the
painting, so it reflects people walking pass it, much like a mirror would.&nbsp;
As we were sitting there, I saw a man walk through the kitchen, in the
glass on the picture.&nbsp; I assumed my husband had come home and I turned
around and called out his name.&nbsp; Figuring he had come home and was
coming into the dining room where we were.&nbsp; My aunt, said 'John's
not home yet, is he?'&nbsp; And I said, ' Yes, I just saw him pass through
the kitchen in the reflection in the pitcure.'&nbsp; He wasn't home, in
fact, and she saw nothing from where she was sitting, facing the kitchen.&nbsp;
Yet I saw 'something' very clearly in the glass on the wall.</B><B></B>

<P><B>We assume we are seeing glimpses of the old man who built our house,
keeping watch over our boys as they grew and now over my husband and me.&nbsp;

me and one of my closest friends, lives in Truro Heights, a fairly seculded
but nice part of truro, in an older apartment complex. The complex is at
a dead end street, a large three story brick building. Lower class, the
main tenants are younger couples such as my sister and her boyfriend, just
starting out on their own. The halls are very wide, the walls are painted
bricks. All three floors have the ugliest carpet you can imagine. *My sisters
hall is a lovely shade of orange*&nbsp; She and I have a standing tradition
that whenever I am in town and her boyfriend is at work, I'll grab her
and I a coffee at Tim Hortans and go visit her.&nbsp; During one of these
visits a few weeks ago, she was telling me about how she felt 'weird' in
her apartment sometimes. Especially when her boyfriend worked the evening
shift, 3:00 PM to 11:00 PM. I asked her what it felt like, and she really
didn;t have an answer. She did tell me however that from time to time in
the large picture window looking out on her small lawn, she could see a
shadowy blurred figure behind her, in the kitchen... almost as if someone
was doing dishes.The previous night her boyfriend had woken her up in the
very early hours of the morning by sprinting out of bed, into the main
room, and out into the hall. When he came back, he was shaken and pacing
the bedroom before he laid back down. He had been laying there after waking
up to go to the bathroom, and heard what seemed to be a young woman’s voice
in the hall scream 'help me</B>
<BR><B>I'm being raped!' Nothing was heard for the rest of the night, and
the outer hallway had been cold and silent. Smaller occurrences, such as
chess pieces on their chessboard moving have happened several times lately.
And, to my amazement, While my sister was in her bedroom getting changed
and I waited out in the armchair for her, I heard a woman’s voice, in the
area of the kitchen table, sigh/whisper 'hello.' No fan was on at the time,
no radio or TV. Weird. I didn't get a bad or scared feeling from it, if
anything it was nice to be welcomed instead of the usual stories you hear
of a voice bellowing 'get out' and dishes sailing at me :P</B>

<P><B>I used to work at a community center (off bald eagle rd from camino
de oesete close to cortaro farms rd) in tucson az where i was a checker
and an assit manager. i had been there for over 5 years and i have encountered
a spirt that became attached to me.&nbsp; across from the main office is
a rec room where we held our activities. one saturday morning over a can
of soda and listening to the cure w/ a long time friend and coworker: I
was told about the ghost that she saw a ghost that morning. the entity
is of a women about 5 ft in height wearing a distinctive pink sweater w
long brown hair. that was all that was seen because the sprit's back was
to her. my friend thought it was a memo and shrugged it of as she finished
preparing food for an event when she turned around again and she was gone.
now I’ve never known my friend to lie and she being a devoute catholic
and has had many experiences w/ visions and the supernatural. this peaked
my interest . I’m a practioner of nocturnal witchcraft and i have many
interest in the nite relm and the sprits connected to it. my experiences
w/ it became more and more personal i felt my interest</B>
<BR><B>in her being and my occult connection gave me an appeal to her.
once , while closing, i was cleaning out the trash in the women's restroom
i bent down take the trash out of the bin and i felt a cold presence sort
of goose me and i shot of quickly and said "don’t ever do that again".
once while i was closing again w/ may girl friend and the same co worker,
a member said who is that in the rec room. and then the mem grabbed her
neck and said that the spirt was killed by her boy friend by asphyxiation
and was disposed of her on this property before it was built. it was estab
in 1980 aprox. and that she hides her face in sarrow as she looks for her
baby that was left behind. the mem was an interesting lady her self the
was pyscic and enjoyed earthly spirts as well as other worldly. during
this experience the scent of lilys were in the air and the member said
that was the essence that the sprit created. on several occasions a man
would be seen out in the pool area sort of short w a black hat on my girfriend
and friend both saw him and thought it was another mem. i have taken various
phots in the rec rm w/ a digital camera and have caught blue orbs around
my friend. the ghost became so attached to me because i became obsessed
w/ the subject that she started coming home w/ me i would sense her in
the passenger seat of my car as i would drive home and when i slept at
night she would nock items off my desk and i would hear them fall to the
floor. and i would have dreams where i would wake up and see swirling images
from my dreams while i was awake i couldnt stop these visions.my mom began
to see experince the presence as well as our dogs. my moms crafted bunny
ornament on the kitchen wall would be found up side down and faux plants
would be nocked of the walls. when i left home to my firts apt the sprirt
became more active and my dad --who has no idea about any of this--told
my mom that he would see strange lights in the hall way and the stereo
would go on by itself. my mom would also feel a tap on her shoulders and
a tug on her shorts. there is much to tell but i need to cut it off here.
if you are in the area you cant get in unless you are a mem. i you do go
there in you are in the bathrooms be for warned. if you have any other
questions you can email me jjeffas@aol.com&nbsp; i no longer where there
because i got a nose ring and became separated by my appearance.</B>

<P><B>I have two stories to tell</B><B></B>

<P><B>Firstly was at my school. We were doing a play rehearsal and we had
a really high stage ( the school was really old and was once lived in.
apparently someone was pushed of the balcony) as I said my lines I spotted
something out of the corner of my eye. It seemed to be a figure dressed
in black. When i looked at it proberly it ran away.</B><B></B>

<P><B>2&nbsp; I was at Hampton court with my family and we were walking
back through the gardens. Suddenly my dad saw a figure running on the opposite
bank of the pond. I started to run attempting to follow them. I saw s/he
it run behind a bush. I waited. Then the geese flew away and I heard footsteps
but saw no-one.</B>
<BR><B>Well what do you think? As for me I firmly believe in god. Ghosts
I'm not sure about</B>

<BR><B>Unexplained Phenomena</B>
<BR><B>jenniferwilcox@nexicom.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, my name is Jen and throughout all the years that I've visited
this site, this is the first time I've ever submitted a story.&nbsp; Where
should I begin... I, myself haven't experienced too much paranormally,
but my family members have and I would love to tell you their stories.&nbsp;
I'll begin with my mother.&nbsp; My mom is one whom I think has a great
power, in that she attracts spirits and has had many experiences with the
paranormal.&nbsp; This one is one of my favorites.&nbsp; When my mother
was a teenager, she and her cousin were walking home after school one march
afternoon.&nbsp; They were walking across a field and as they were walking,
they encountered a young girl around 7 or 8 years of age.&nbsp; She was
wearing a red coat with a fur lined hood and cuffs.&nbsp; The little girl
reached out her hand towards my mother and said "Help me, Christina"(that's
my mother's name).&nbsp; My mom wasn't sure what to make of the frightened
child and asked the girl her name.&nbsp; The girl repeated, "Help me, Christina."&nbsp;
As my mother approached the little girl, she simply vanished away.&nbsp;
My mom's cousin saw the girl as well and to this day they are still unsure
of what to make of their experience.&nbsp; Yet they are certain of what
they saw.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My second story is one that belongs to my step-father.&nbsp; For
many years he lived in an old farm house circa 1800.&nbsp; When he moved
in he was informed by the previous owners of the home about a ghost that
supposedly resided in the home.&nbsp; It was apparently that of an older
woman who died of an illness in the early 1900s.&nbsp; Not being a gullable
man, he dismissed the story.&nbsp; Then, one night, later on in his first
week in the home, he was suddenly awakened by a shuffling noise in the
living room.&nbsp; His bedroom was off of the living room and at the foot
of the stairs that led to two other bedrooms upstairs.&nbsp; He peered
outside his door and was amazed to see an apparition of an older woman
standing by the fireplace.&nbsp; He was able to see through her, yet she
was a blurry bluish white colour, and her facial features were blurred
as well.&nbsp; Although she was "blurred" he could tell that she looked
extremely sad.&nbsp; I asked him if he was scared, but he said no, and
simply that he was more curious.&nbsp; I then asked him if he tried to
communicate with her, and he told me that he felt that if he tried, she
would not have acknowledged him at all.&nbsp; It was almost as if she was
in her own world.&nbsp; She then "floated" into the kitchen where she eventually
vanished.&nbsp; He saw her a total of three times in the 20 years that
he lived in the home.&nbsp; He saw her twice in the winter seasons and
once in the spring and all the times he saw her, she would be standing
by the fireplace, and then proceed to the kitchen.&nbsp; Other strange
things would happen in the house as well.&nbsp; For instance, when he opened
his closet door, the clothes on the hangers would shuffle and sway too
and fro (kind of like in the moive, The St. Francisville Experiment - okay
ghost movie for those who liked Blair Witch) and not because he opened
the door and the breeze made them move, they moved on their own for atleast
30 seconds.&nbsp; There was also the occasional footsteps up and down the
stairs every other night.&nbsp; I'll add more to this later...</B><B></B>

<P><B>For my last entry, but not my last story that I'll submit to this
site, I'll tell you a story about my grandfather.&nbsp; When my grandpa
was in his twenties, his brother died in a logging accident (they lived
in Vinton, Quebec, and logging was very big business in the 30s up to the
60s).&nbsp; My granfather was torn over the loss and became very melancholy
for a quite a few months.&nbsp; One day in the winter, after a fresh snowfall,
my grandfather was walking home through an open field.&nbsp; He suddenly
had a strange feeling come over him, as if someone were with him.&nbsp;
He turned around to look and see if anyone was behind him.&nbsp; No one
was, but, when he looked down he saw something very strange, another set
of footprints in the snow that had been beside his the whole walk thus
far, and stopped beside him where he had stopped to look behind him.&nbsp;
He looked ahead, baffled, and saw a figure of a young man standing in the
distance ahead of him, waving.&nbsp; As he approached, the waving man disappeared.&nbsp;
My grandfather told me that he knew it was Andy (his brother), and strangely,
was at peace ever since that incident.</B>
<BR><B>I'd like to add that I believe that these stories are all true as
the people who I've talked about are very trust worthy and would not lie
about such things they saw.&nbsp; I hope you liked the stories and I have
more coming.&nbsp; Spook ya later...</B>

<BR><B>UPDATING MR MATTWICK STORY FROM 1999</B>
<BR><B>rowan1019@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>ITS BEEN A FEW YEARS SINCE I FIRST POSTED MY STORY. HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT MUCH TIME HAS GONE BY. WE STILL LIVE IN THE HOUSE AND STILL HAVE MR
MATTWICK AROUND TOO. MY KIDS ARE BOTH IN THEIR TEENS NOW AND THE ACTIVITY
HAS PICKED UP GREATLY. BUT I UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL. THEY BOTH
HAVE SEEN HIM ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT IN THEIR ROOM. THEY SAY ALOT OF TIME
HE WILL COVER THEM BACK UP IF THEY KICKED THE COVERS OFF. I WAS SO WORRIED
IT WOULD BE BAD FOR THEM BUT IT HAS TURNED OUT TO BE THE EXACT OPPOSITE!
THEY ARE VERY AWARE OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN IN LIFE AND
DEATH. THEY SEEM TO APPERICIATE HIM AND CONSIDER HIM A MEMBER OF OUR FAMILY.
IN FACT I AM STARTING TO FEEL THE SAME WAY. THERE HAVE BEEN 2 TIMES OVER
THE LAST FEW YEARS WHEN SOMEONE TRIED TO BREAK INTO OUR HOME. WE WERE ALL
SLEEPING AT THE TIME. WELL ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS THIS HORRENDOUS CRASHING
SOUND. WOKE BOTH MYSELF AND HUSBAND OUT OF A DEAD SLEEP. I THOUGHT FOR
SURE A CAR HAD CRASHED INTO THE FRONT OF OUR HOUE. AS WE WENT DOWNSTAIRS
WE BOTH FULLY EXPECTED TO SEE A CAR IN OUR LIVING ROOM. WELL THERE WAS
NONE. FROM WHAT WE COULD TELL INSIDE NOTHING WAS OUT OF PLACE. MY HUSBAND
SAID HE WANTED TO LOOK OUTSIDE. SO HE&nbsp; PUT ON SHOES AND OUT THE DOOR
HE WENT. THERE WAS SNOW ON THE GROUND AND HE COULD SEE FOOTPRINTS COMING
TO THE DOOR AND THEN GOING AWAY. WHEN HE EXAMINED THE DOOR CLOSER HE SAW
THAT SOMEONE TRIED TO PRY IT OPEN BUT DID NOT SUCCEED. I FIRMLY BELIEVE
MR MATTWICK CREATED THE NOISE NOT ONLY TO WAKE US UP BUT TO SCARE AWAY
THE WOULD BE BURGLER. IT WAS THE SAME THING ON THE SECOND INCIDENT. BUT
THIS TIME WE AT LEAST KNEW WHAT THE DRILL WAS! I WENT TO BED BOTH NIGHTS
THANKING MR MATTWICK FOR PROTECTING US AND OUR HOME. HE HAS ALSO SHOWN
THAT HE HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR. I HAVE A FRIEND WHO CAME OVER TO VISIT ME.
HE KNOWS ABOUT OUR GHOST AND DIDN'T BELIEVE ME. SO THIS DAY THE ONLY ONES
IN THE HOUSE WERE THE TWO OF US. I WAS DOING LAUNDRY AND HAD HIM COME DOWN
WHILE I SWITCHED OUT LOADS. WELL THERE IS A ROOM OFF THE MAIN ROOM . MY
FRIEND ASKED WHAT WAS IN THERE SO I OPENED THE DOOR AND PULLED THE LIGHT
ON. ITS JUST A SMALL ROOM WITH SHELVES FOR CANNED GOODS. HE LOOKED AROUND
I TURNED OFF THE LIGHT AND SHUT THE DOOR. WE WENT BACK UPSTAIRS AND THOUGHT
NOTHING MORE ABOUT IT. FOURTY FIVE MINUTES LATER WHEN WE WENT BACK DOWN
TO CHANGE LOADS THE DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN AND THE LIGHT ON. I IMEDIATELY STARTED
LAUGHING BECAUSE I KNEW MR MATTWICK WAS TELLING MY FRIEND HA DON'T BELIEVE
IN ME DO YOU! WELL MY FRIEND TURNED WHITE AS A SHEET AND BOLTED OUT OF
THE HOUSE. NOTHING I HAVE SAID OR DONE SINCE WILL CONVINCE HIME TO COME
BACK. HE SAID HE'D NEVER BEEN SO SCARED IN HIS LIFE. POOR THING I NEVER
MENT TO HAVE HIM SCARED FOR LIFE AND I AM SURE MR MATTWICK DIDN'T EITHER.
BUT ANYWAY THATS WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING THE LAST FEW YEARS. I WILL KEEP
YOU ALL POSTED AS TO ANY CHANGES. AS YOU CAN SEE MY EMAIL ADRESS HAS CHANGED.

<BR><B>VB's Story</B>
<BR><B>EQualPriao@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My most memorable, possibly supernatural, experiences happened while
I was living in a house in Albuquerque, NM. I was going through a particularly
hard time in my life, and I think that my feet were, more often than not,
not firmly rooted in the ground.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, this story takes place when my aunt was living with us.
She slept in the room right across the hallway from me. That night I had
stayed up late, just blowing the time away until I felt tired. I had left
the light on and gotten into bed, with a book in hand, planning to read
until I was ready to go to sleep. I was thinking of putting the radio on
too, when I heard someone coming down the hallway. My door was closed,
and I knew everyone had their doors shut and that the lights had been turned
off inside the house, so technically no one should have been in the hallway
at that time.</B>
<BR><B>I had been startled by the fact that I hadn't heard anyone getting
up or leaving either, and that the footsteps were not coming from any of
our rooms, but seemed to have started where the hallway connected to the
rest of the house. The footsteps were falling more heavily than anyone
walked. I was the only person who made so much noise. Right away I knew
that something was wrong, and that I needed to find a way to defend myself.
I also knew that I was probably the only one awake enough to hear that
someone was there, and the light from my room would have been visible to
anyone walking outside.</B>
<BR><B>In about 2 seconds I grabbed anything I could find that I could
possibly use as a weapon, and waited for something to happen. I listened
as the footsteps came closer and closer, finally stopping between our two
doors. I felt a climax of feelings within me as I imagined the door possibly
opening any second, and then a calm, charged confidence. I waited, nothing.
The house had become as quiet and still as it had been moments before when
there had been no footsteps at all.</B>
<BR><B>The house had become as quiet and still as it had been moments before
when there had been no footsteps at all. I could swear that I had litterally
"felt" someone out in the hall all the way until they had stopped outside
my door, then seconds later the feeling had disappeared entirely. I could
only feel the emptiness and sleeping house that had been there before.
After that I left the light on until I woke up to daylight the next morning.</B>

<P><B>For years everyone has thought my house was haunted. One day during
the summer my mom was out of town my dad and sister were at work about
6am.So I woke up to an empty house. ( this was not unusual until that day)
Well I got up and sat down in our den and I kept hearing this faint little
whisper. I couldn’t understand it but then I'd hear my name in the same
whisper only it was very clear. This went on for a while and I walked around
the house to check to see if someone left on a TV, radio, or our police
scanner. But nothing was on and I had muted the tv I was watching. Any
time I would turn up the tv the voices got louder! I was practicing talent
for a beauty pageant I was going to be in and I go sick of the voices so
turned the radio up all the way (BIG MISTAKE) whatever was in my house
got pissed of and screamed my name! Well lets just say I let it do&nbsp;
all the talking it wanted to that day. Then that night I leaned over the
side of my bed to get my remote control &amp; I swear something was looking
at me and so go away b*tch go away!...I left the remote there and went
to sleep.</B>

<P><B>Ok well I'm 17 years old and I've had my share of weird experiances.
Ever since I was a child I've had some weird things happen to me. My most
recent happend to me about a month ago. I was asleep and I remember having
this paralized feeling all over my body and I atomatically knew what it
was because when ever I see things i feel this way. But I remember not
wanting to open my eyes because I was afraid of what I was going to see.
For some reason I did open them and I saw a old woman standing at the foot
of my bed. She was screaming in spanish come on Victor Come on but in a
angry and frustrated way. So I closed my eyes again because I couldn't
move or say anything and she went away so then I stood up and I looked
on the floor and what I saw scared the crap out of me I saw the pic of
the Virgin Mary on the floor next to my bed, and that pic was hung up over
my little brothers bed and some how it appeared next to my bed!!!!</B>

<P><B>I really like this Site you have, it's pretty exiting to read about
the sightings people have seen, i myself have also seen a ghost once, it
was when i was about 5-6 years ago, i was on summer break, and i was with
the family on a Lant place, we where visiting a relative to my mother,
and late on the night maybe 22:00 - 23:00 'o clock. When we where there,
i saw a White Lady crossing a big field of crops... when you suddenly disappeared,
i was the only one of all who was there that had seen it, so at first i
didn’t think it was something, but then when i had come home from the summer
break i talked to my grandfather about what I’ve seen, and he believed
me, because my grandfather had also seen some ghost in his life, so it
was then i started to belive i had seen a ghost and it was then i also
started to believe that there really exist ghosts. And i have believed
that since then.</B>

<P><B>The Year was 1985.&nbsp; I was 11 years old.&nbsp; My family of 10
decided that the 3-bedroom house we lived in was overcrowded and moved
5 blocks to a new neighbor hood.&nbsp; "Boring is the only word that came
to mind for me, to me this wasn't a real move, I'd still attend the same
school with the same kids as before.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Summer came and my sister and I volunteered to paint the house before
my family moved in.&nbsp; My mom dropped us off there and went off to run
some errands.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had not met anyone in the neighborhood.&nbsp;
It was around noon that I stopped for a break.&nbsp; My dad had put the
picnic table my grandpa built at one end of the yard against the fence.&nbsp;
I stretched out on it in the sun and closed my eyes for a couple seconds
and heard a deeper than natural voice say "Hello Gina” I sat up and looked
around me.&nbsp; Nobody was anywhere to be seen.&nbsp; I stood up on the
table and looked over the fence, no body there either.&nbsp; I ran inside
and told my sister and all she did was laugh at me and taunt me, until
we got into a paint fight.&nbsp; Moving day came.&nbsp; My grand parents
came down to help out with the move.&nbsp; We had moved the picnic table
to the back yard and after taking a couple of loads my buddy Tanya and
I decided to go A-wol.&nbsp; We retreated for the shade of the back yard
and sat on the table and chatted.&nbsp; I glanced up and saw an elderly
gentleman in a baseball cap walking across the yard, I was surprised, he
didn't look familiar at all to me and I turned to my friend to see if she
knew who he was and then a split second later he vanished.&nbsp; The gate
that he would have entered the yard through had not been opened and had
a padlock on it.&nbsp; It was so odd, because she saw him too.&nbsp; I
noticed a blue baseball cap in th e rose bush, and we laughed thinking
that this is what we saw all along, but in my gut I knew there was something
very odd about this house.&nbsp; we played catch with he hat for a moment
and then we set it on the floor beside the sliding door.</B><B></B>

<P><B>One of the strange things about this house that my mother and I noticed
almost immediately was that there was a pile of beetles crawling around
in the rock garden.&nbsp; I had never seen that many beetles in one place.&nbsp;
My mom said, "Maybe they really like figs.&nbsp; I think there was something
buried back there, but I never had the guts to find out.</B><B></B>

<P><B>That night, we begged my grandparents to let us stay here at the
new house with them.&nbsp; It was eerie, it was late summer and this is
when it would get windy at night.</B><B></B>

<P><B>We would here the wind howling through the old trees and the house
made creaking sounds that my grandma said was the old place just settling.&nbsp;
I thought it odd.&nbsp; We would here a door creek open and slam shut and
then a toilet flush, and it really creped me out because we all knew that
we were all down stairs.&nbsp; We had a little prayer.&nbsp; My grandpa
told me that it was probably the wind and the plumbing.&nbsp; My grandpa
told us that if people tried to break in, that he had his gun and he could
tell them not to move or he would shoot.&nbsp; He's an old cowboy and isn't
afraid of anything.</B><B></B>

<P><B>That night I slid as low as I could in my sleeping bag and shivered
my self to sleep, not from cold but from fear.&nbsp; I woke up a couple
of times during the night because I heard a sound like metal scratching
metal.&nbsp; Dismissing this as the sound of branches in the wind or something,
I went back to sleep.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The odd part was that in the morning, I awoke and saw my dad and
my grandfather replacing the sliding glass door.&nbsp; My dad was pretty
mad, griping something about vandals, this is when I noticed the gouge
in the metal of the sliding door.&nbsp; We ran to the back doorway and
noticed the hat was missing.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My mom insisted that it was all out imagination but I noticed that
she put a piece of wood at the base of the sliding door so it would not
be opened from the outside.</B><B></B>

<P><B>For months I wouldn't go to the bathroom alone or sleep by my self.</B><B></B>

<P><B>There were other odd things about this house; we notice that there
was some odd kind of wiring in the house, a doorbell in the closet upstairs
and in the garage of all places.&nbsp; A doorbell attached to the phone
as well.</B><B></B>

<P><B>We for at least 12 years continued to get mail delivered to our house
for a Mr. Ingram.&nbsp; I asked the neighbors about him and they didn't
seem to remember him.</B>
<BR><B>I wonder still if he was the old man we saw with the blue hat or
if he was buried in the rock garden.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My oldest sister and my oldest brother both have had health problems
that started when we lived in that house.&nbsp; Eventually my family moved
to Idaho and they are all doing a lot better now.&nbsp; I married and still
live in Fairfield, and on occasion drive past that house, and still wonder
if Mr Ingrahm lives on Eagle way?</B>

<BR><B>The Room</B>
<BR><B>boredmindedwomen@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was about 13 or 14 my mom and I had moved from Florida to Michigan!
We ended up in a small town called Hillsdale .She found us a little apartment
on ac side Rd. not to far from town. It seemed like an ok place. After
2 or 3 months of living there i finally started sleeping upstairs in the
1st bedroom there were 2 .The 1st bedroom had a open staircase wooden floors
and 2 windows in the middle of the wall on the north side of the bedroom.
Every night i would lie in the bed witch was on the wall to wear my feet
were by the end of the bed pointing north. There were 2 windows throwing
in shadows from the street lights behind me on the wall . But on the wall
between the 2 windows on the north side of the bedroom there was always
a shadow of a skull and top hat. T always thought it was my imagination
,but how could it be shadows from the street light on the wall facing away
from the street lights? It scared me enough that i changed rooms 2 the
back bedroom. Until 1 night I went in the back bedroom to go to bed i had
2 big dolls my aunt had made me and my friend was with me. I opened the
door the dolls were sitting on the edge of my bed with there eyes glowing
red. Needless to say my friend and i ran down the steps and slept there.
I never told any1 else except 4 friends later on in life But I was not
imagining these things, and there was no logical explanation .I never went
upstairs again alone at night in that apartment .</B>
