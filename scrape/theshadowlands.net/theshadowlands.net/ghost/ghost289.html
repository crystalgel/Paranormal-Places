<BR><B>Ghost in the Apartment</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: harry.wiwer@ns.sympatico.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is my son's experience in a apartment we lived in about a year
and a half ago.It was a small apartment which had two floors.Downstairs
was the living room,kitchen and bathroom with the two bedrooms upstairs.My
son was two at the time and I was getting him used to sleeping in his own
room.I had had him in the room with me at night from the time he was born,so
when he resisted going into the bedroom across the hall I figured it was
because he wanted to stay with me.After a few days of him constantly crying
in his room,I would go in with him and sit with him until he fell asleep.I
thought I had started too fast in getting him used to his own room.Then
he started talking about "man wit no eyes an beg teef".I didn't know what
he meant at first and thought he was just babbling.It got worse every night.I
would put him in his room at night and he would start screaming about the
man with no eyes and big teeth and try to run out of the room.I started
sitting on the stairs landing reading a book,and talking to him a bit until
he went to sleep,but as soon as I went downstairs I would hear him run
to his door screaming about the man.Finally I started sleeping with him
in his room just to see what was going on.My mom's house is haunted but
when your kid doesn't want to go to sleep a ghost bothering him isn't the
first thing that comes to your mind,no matter if you've experienced ghosts
or not.So I spent a few nights in there and nothing happened.Then we put
a crucifix in his room just maybe on the off chance that there was something.Well
one night I was up there with my son and my boyfriend trying to get him
to go asleep when I left his room to go get him a drink of water when there
on the landing was a short man with no eyes and sharp teeth.There was no
sockets at all and there seemed to be blackness all around him though the
lights were all on.I ran back into the room and I told my boyfriend after
I calmed down a bit. We then heard someone walking up the stairs and the
bedroom door opened.We just stared at the door but the only thing we saw
was a shadow pass by the door and into the wall.My boyfriend said he felt
like someone was calling him into the hall and he felt like he couldn't
breathe.He said it was the most scared he had ever been in his life.The
funny thing about that apartment was that only the upstairs and especially
my son's room had anything that happened.We moved from that apartment two
weeks later to the one we're in now and my son sleeps just fine in his
own room.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Friends Car</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: vols919@earthlink.net</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I just sent you another story but i thought i'd tell you some stories
about one of my best friends father's car. Its a 55 Chevrolet and i guess
the story began sometime in the 80's or early 90's. Well Loren (her father)
and his friend Rick were riding in the car on a bridge in front of a chemical
plant and as they drove they saw a woman on the side of the road in very
old clothes as in they werent modern at all. She had two paper grocery
bags in her arms and as soon as they went by she stepped right out in front
of them. Well they were so stunned so they turned around and went back
through again but there wasnt a trace of the woman. Nothing on the road
at all. So they went home and told Loren's dad Jerry and he told them about
an event that had occurred many many years ago about the time that car
had come out. He said that years before a woman had been run over on that
bridge. She had just gotten done with her grocery shopping. Well that was
just the beginning.</B>
<BR><B>Things began to happen to that car. Like once all of a sudden the
car just started rolling on FLAT ground and it eventually grew speed and
hit a tree in its path. there was no oil in the car when this happened.It
wasnt turned on or anything.Loren kept the car and so he tried to fix it
up. So for some reason he put the steering wheel back on the car with like
a vice or something on it to make sure it didnt move. He left the car in
the garage with the doors locked. The next morning he came in and and the
steering wheel was on the floor on one side of the garage and the vice
was on the other side. There was also another incident which occurred right
after he had put a brand new coat of paint on the car and it was somehow
ruined. But thats it. After all these happenings they decided to name the
car. The name picked out of course was...."Miss Misery"</B>

<BR><B>Dorm Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Lep1984@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>For my first semester at college, I chose to live in the dorms on
campus.&nbsp; The school year began and I soon made friends with one of
my neighbor.&nbsp; On one particular night, we stayed up talking with other
people staying in the dorm.&nbsp; As the night went on, the subject of
the hall ghost came up. My neighbor who had lived the longest in the building
started to relate personal stories and stories from other hall residents.&nbsp;
We ended up pulling an all-nighter and some time about 7 Am, I walked upstairs
to get ready for an 8 Am class.&nbsp; As I walked along through the hallway,
I began hearing footsteps behind me.&nbsp; I turned to see who it was and
no one was there.&nbsp; Thinking nothing off it, I continued walking, but
again i heard the footsteps.&nbsp; This time I noticed they were louder.&nbsp;
Without turning, I heard them get louder and louder as if the person was
about to walk by me.&nbsp; But no one passed me in the hallway and soon
I heard the footsteps walking away from me.&nbsp; Many times throughout
the semester, girls on my floor complained to the RA about odd things happening,
things disappearing only to reappear days later in odd places.&nbsp; Some
girls noted the would hear whistling and odd footsteps following them into
the bathroom and down the hallway.</B>
<BR><B>On Halloween night, my own experience with the ghost occured.&nbsp;
I lay in bed finally able to sleep.&nbsp; A hand on my shoulder woke me
up.&nbsp; Thinking it was my roommate, I tried swatting at it and told
Crystal to go back to sleep.&nbsp; But when the hand didn't go away, I
realized it couldn't have been my roommate.&nbsp; She had gone to the library
earlier and wasn't back yet.&nbsp; The invisible hand dragged itself down
to my feet.&nbsp; There it began pulling away the blanket covering me.&nbsp;
Suddenly it stopped and seconds later the door opened and there was my
roommate.&nbsp; I don't think I had ever been so glad to see her then at
that moment</B><B></B>

<P><B>Denton</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>I live in a house on avenue A in Denton, TX that is definitely haunted.
You would know it if you saw it because all of the cats in the neighborhood
stay in our front yard. At night, even if there is light shining in the
bathroom window, the mirror remains completely dark. People that stay at
my house claim that it is comfortable enough, but when they are left alone,
they tell me it is terrifying. Mostly at night (but occasionally during
the day as well) my family and I hear heavy footsteps in the kitchen or
a scratching sound at the back door when no one is back there. Things often
disappear, and never turn up. For example, my car keys (which I keep in
a bowl by the front door) disappeared, and continued to be missing for
a week, until I was forced to call a locksmith to have a new set made.
That was two years ago, and they still haven't turned up. The kitchen clock
(which was battery powered) stopped running because the batteries had worn
out. However, we didn’t have any in the house and I kept forgetting to
buy batteries when I stopped at the store. A few months had gone by and
I had still neglected to run the errand when one day I noticed the clock
was running once again. My husband swears up and down that he had not replaced
the batteries. Many other strange things have happened as well, such as
that feeling that there is someone in the room, the wood floors creak by
themselves, etc....I would prefer to remain anonymous ( I don’t want any
strangers knocking on my door and asking to come if they can check it out)
but I just thought I'd share the story.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Weird Feelings</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: irblir@microsoft.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I found this site by accident one day and I haven't been able to
stop reading the stories all these people have submitted. I just want to
say that I have never blaintly had an experience with a "ghost" and I must
say if I did I's be pretty freaked out! But anyways, here's my story.</B>
<BR><B>I've always had a rather personal problem (since birth) which makes
me do strange things, but I won't go into that. Well, when I was young
my mom, a religous person, would hang pictures of Mary and little figurines
that represented angels around the house. She especially put them in my
room because she believed they would protect me. In what seems like a few
weeks I managed to break every religious figurine and crack the picture
of Mary which hung in our kitchen. The strange thing was that I never intentionally
did it and they always seemed to just fall off on their own. I remember
just walking into my room one day and all of a sudden an angel fell off&nbsp;
the tv and cracked in two. None of the other figurines ever fell like that
and so my mom began saying I was "the devil" everytime that happened.</B>
<BR><B>Moving a couple years forward, I had never broken any more figurines
like but the weird feelings started. I had alreayd moved by then and was
living in the house I am now. One summer, during the day, my parents and
brother went out leaving me home alone to do some cleaning. As I was cleaning
with the radio on I began to hear whispers. I thought they were from the
radio at first so I turned it low but the whispers continued. So I quietly
moved towards them and found that they were coming from my parents room!
I was too scared to go in and see what it was because I began getting a
weird feeling. It's the kind of feeling you get when you know you're not
alone or someone is sneaking up behind you; a jolt of energy bursting from&nbsp;
the tips of your toes to the nape of your neck. I grabbed a knife and waited
in the kitchen for a few minutes, in dead silence except for the whispers,
until the feeling was too much that I had to wait outside in the backyard
till my parents returned. I told them but they assumed it was the answering
machine or something.</B>
<BR><B>Another experience I had was when I was asleep. I was dreaming and
sleeping soundly until what seemed like an earth quake shook my bed. My
bed at the time was a pulled out futon with a peg-like thing extending
to the floor and it felt like someone had taken that and shook it with
all their might ( which was humanly impossible since the was so big ).
After a quick breather I fell back to sleep and woke up the next morning
still thinking about that occurence. I looked around my bed to check if
ANYTHING could have done that and found nothing. Before this all happened
I remembered seeing odd shadows on my ceiling at night that once resembled
a giant face&nbsp; tattooed to the wall right above my bed.</B>
<BR><B>I haven't had man mor experiences like that but the weird feelings
keep coming to me, especially at night. For some reason my room becomes
a freezer at night and no matter how well I seal my windows the room remains
cold. I found it harder to sleep at night too and for the longest time
would wake up with new bruises on my legs that I could never have gotten
( I don't move around a lot in my sleep nor play rough ). Well I know these
aren't as scary as other people's experiences but I feel something building
up and I just hope I'm prepared for it.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Cemetery Block</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Euph300@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>This is my brother's story of his and his freind's ghost experiences,told
from the eyes of me.</B>
<BR><B>It began a few years ago,when my brother(Scott)and his friend(Brandon,who
I like very much.)Brandon had been over for a few hours,and was having
so much fun he wanted to sleep over.He called his home,but they did not
awnser the phone.So Scott and Brandon decided to walk.When they got back,they
told me,about halfway across the street,they had saw a figure move from
a person's garage.Every dog on that street started barking.The figure moved
toward them,and they figured they'd go back into the house.So they ran,but
so did the figure.Then they noticed the figure was white and glowing.As
they were running,Scott tipped over a box with some broken glass in it.Then,the
lightbulb from the light on our front lawn,fell and nearly missed Scott's
head.When they got inside,the figure was gone,and even though there was
no lightbulb,the light was flashing red.We went in Scott's room.Brandon
decided he would definitly sleep over.(PS:Brandon had a ghost in his house
for a long time that used to hide his things.)</B>
<BR><B>The next day,I(Being the smart one.)did a search on the Internet.We
found out that all of our block,used to be an old cemetery,and that the
big house near the end of the road,used to be an Inn that burned down.Knowing
this,Brandon and Scott dug for stuff in Brandon's backyard.I thought this
was stupid,because they weren't going to find corpses under Brandon's vollyball
net.The only thing they found was an old black ribbon and some wood.Then,that
night,Scott fell asleep,but then awoke very late,and saw a girl in his
room,that looked like a skinny me.And my Mom and Dad sworn they saw a white
dog going down the hallway that seperates mine and Scott's room.And,a while
later,my cousin slept over,and I heard this strange,yipping noise.I thought
it was a toy or something,and searched for it.Then I noticed it was coming
from outside my room.I fell back asleep,too creeped to see what it was.Then,Scott
said the girl in his room walked and dissapeared in his closet.After this,we
no longer wanted to investigate this matter,but we haven't forgotten about
it...........................</B><B></B>

<P><B>Bell Witch</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Elementsantiques@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Just wanted to say that I love ghosts! I've been interested in them
all my life and wondered things like "Is it just some people that become
ghosts?" and if so "What kind of people become them?" My dad and I love
ghosts we even have a story for you. This is a true story for a fact!</B>
<BR><B>One day my uncle I'll call him Joe went with some buddies of his
to the Bell Witch cave in Adams, TN. Well, they went through the cave and
then they got ready to go home. The guide told them not to take anything
out of the cave but a guy took a rock out. Now they had come in two cars,
and Jimmy (that's the guy who was driving the other car) started his car
fine. Then Joe tried to start his car and it wouldn't start so the guy
piped up that he had a rock. Well, they went up to the owners and told
them the whole thing and the man said "You'll have to go and put it back
in the exact same place.....or else!" So they went and put it down in the
exact same place and went to the cars where the other guys were waiting.
They tried the car and it started right up!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>George's Island</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: beautifulletdown521@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Alicia and I am in 10th grade. I have always loved the
paranormal and just have seen a few things that made me a believer. In
8th grade we decided to go to George's island as a grade field trip. I
had never EVER been to George's Island before and actually never had heard
of it before.</B>
<BR><B>I loved it there. Immediatly I felt at home, and I just wanted to
run everywhere and touch everything. Yet the place felt sad and alone.
My friend Kelly and I ran throughout the island running into other friends,
and we crept throughout the dark corners of the tunnels. At one point in
time I just was sitting near the edge of a cliff that led off into the
ocean. I turned to Kelly and started making up a story about a woman who
lost her only love here and she just wanders the island waiting for him.
Tears actaully formed in my eyes and a couple of my friends told me to
calm down. That it was just a story I made up and not to get over excited
but I was overwhelmed with such saddness that my friends had to move me
away.</B>
<BR><B>For the rest of the day I was getting dizzy and just couldn't get
rid of the feeling like someone was watching me. It bothered me so much
that at times I refused to enter any dark tunnel like before because I
was scared. Now I don't get that scared easily and if I do it's for a good
cause. Even Kelly was getting worried. I calmed down aft awhile and soon
it was time to go. When I got home my dad was there to meet me. He asked
how it was and then said that he forgot to tell me about the Lady in Black.
He said he knew I liked that stuff but he didn't get to tell me about it.
He told me the story and it was exactly like the one I made up of the top
of my head! Did she actually visit me to tell me her story? I don't know
but there is no way on earth that I could randomly make up a story and
have it be true. the Lady in Black has been spotted a couple times during
the 40's- 60's. I have no idea if there have been anymore recent sightings
though.</B><B></B>

<P><B>An Animal Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:cathy_8697@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hello, I'd like to share my experience with you. My dad owned a factory
and to keep it safe he bought two dogs. The dogs were both puppies at the
time and I would play with them often. One day I picked up one and accidently
threw it down really far and broke its leg. I felt really bad afterwards
and cried. I learned later that the dog died. One day when I was in the
factory's main building, I saw with the corner of my eye a black figure
in the shape of a dog walking towards the door. I turned to see something
and I couldn't find anything. My dad sold the factory a year later and
I never went back.</B><B></B>

<P><B>THERE'S SOMETHING IN MY HOUSE #1</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: xten_101@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>We have a three level house that is creepy.&nbsp; On the top floor
is my two sisters and my room and the bathroom. My two sister's are 16
and 3 years old.&nbsp; im 15yr's old. One night my mom and dad wen't out
and we were the only one's home (my two sister's and I) and our t.v was
faceing the staircase and I was kind of glancing upstairs and watching
t.v at the same time and I saw shadows upstairs moveing from room to room
really fast.&nbsp; I thought I was seeing things so I didn't ask my sister
if she saw it.&nbsp; But then she asked me if i saw something move around
like a shadow upstairs and I told her yes that I had seen It to.&nbsp;
We didn't think of any more about it until a couple weeks later when our
perants took my dad's perant's out for dinner and we were left by ourselves
again.&nbsp; Our mom rented us some movies so we were in the middle of
watching them and the lights started flickering.&nbsp; Then they wen't
out.&nbsp; All of our power turned off, then back on, then back off.&nbsp;
The scary part about that was we were in the middle of watching a scary
movie right when all this happened. So when all the power went out we sat
there really quiet and then i got up and looked outside at the neighbors
house and there power was still on.&nbsp; Luckily I had my cell phone with
me.&nbsp; So I called my perants on their cell phone and they said they
would call the police to ask if the power went out through the town.&nbsp;
We waited(still in the dark) and then they called us back and said the
cops said the power was on in the city.&nbsp; Right when they said that
the power went on. So my aunt came and picked us up and took us to her
house.&nbsp; The next day when I got upMy mom and dad took my little sister
to grandmas house because t y had to pick up something.&nbsp; I sat at
the dineing room table and looked outside from the door window.&nbsp; I
got up and got me a glass of water from the fridge and went back and sat
down.&nbsp; I heard something like it was draining and I got up and looked
everywhere and then my eyes looked directly at the sink.&nbsp; The water
had been turned on HOT.&nbsp; I looked in the living room and my other
sister was fast asleep.&nbsp; I sat down and turned on the t.v and I flipped
it to a movie and I started watching it and I got all comfortable and then
the t.v started flipping differant channels.&nbsp; Then it turned off.&nbsp;
I woke up my sister and told her about it and we waited for my mom and
dad to get home and we told them what happened.&nbsp; My mom believed us&nbsp;
and she told us some of her experiences with it to.&nbsp; My dad didnt
believe us at firstbut then he finally did because he started seeing the
same things we were.&nbsp; Some of our friends won't&nbsp; come over anymore
because they are so scared.&nbsp; I just try to ignore everything it does
and it dosn't bother me as much as it used to.&nbsp; oh ya, to get my attention
it left some dark hand prints on my wall so thats my proof.....If you think
that's kind of creepy just wait until I tell you about #2......</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp; THERE'S SOMETHING IN MY HOUSE #2</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: xten_101@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well I told you about #1(my house) and now im going to tell you about
my other experiences in another house that my mom and her 7 sisters and
3 brothers used to live in.&nbsp; This house was huge.&nbsp; It had a victorian
look to it.&nbsp; It was white and it had four stories to it.&nbsp; Not
only did her sisters and brothers and her live there but my cousins and
I lived there to.&nbsp; Everything about the house was old.&nbsp; Every
room looked quiet and it sounded quiet to. There was one room where there
was nothing but glass dolls and old dusty cabinets.&nbsp; The living room
was huge it looked like another house and it was fancy.&nbsp; Upstairs
was a room that was green and a couple of other rooms to. When you walk
in that house you get chills it was so creepy.&nbsp; My mom told us this
story about her and her sisters and brothers when they were little living
in that house.&nbsp; So im going to tell you each of them in paragraphes.......</B>
<BR><B>EXPERIENCE #1</B>
<BR><B>My mom was probably anout 6 years old, but her sister and her loved
to play with high heels shoes and they were all playing upstairs and stomping
around with them on and then her mom called them down to dinner so they
left them upstairs.&nbsp; Their dad came home and heard the stomping of
the high heeled shoes upstairs and told them to stop or he was going to
come up there and paddle their behinds.&nbsp; As he was yelling everyone
of them came up to him standing in a line and he had a shocked look on
his face.</B>
<BR><B>EXPERIENCE#2</B>
<BR><B>My mom was home sick one day and my grandma worked nights so she
was sleeping at the time this happened.&nbsp; My mom said she was laying
on the couch with her hand on her forehead feeling sick and there was this
little rug laying on the floor right next to the couch that she was laying
on and it started moveing really slow accross the floor she got up and
ran to her mom's room asking her when she was going to get up.&nbsp; Then
she got up and ran to the bathroom and shut the door.&nbsp; She told me
that she was afraid to open the door because she didn't want something
running out and jumping out at her but she said she couldnt help it so
she opened the door slowly and she said she didnt see or hear anything
so then she started walking out of the bathroom with her back to the other
end of the hall way and then she said she heard it...footsteps running
up to her..she told me that she was shakeing and she turned around and
she didnt see anything then she heard footsteps running away from her to
the other end of the hall way.&nbsp; So she ran back in her mom's room
and stayed there the rest of the day until she got up.....</B>
<BR><B>EXPERIENCE #3</B>
<BR><B>My mom and her sister was playing outside and they hid behind the
bushes playing hide and seek and then the saw a man dressed in an old coaches
outfit calling his horse and she said you could hear horse hoofs clanking
on the ground like it was galloping up to him and then my mom said the
next thing she knew he was gone........</B>
<BR><B>EXPERIENCE #4&nbsp;&nbsp; MY EXPERIENCE</B>
<BR><B>From what I remember at the time that I lived there the house was
already 350 years old and the floors were always creaking and tree limbs
were scratching the windows and the house was falling apart pretty much.&nbsp;
Well my cousins and I were playing hide and seek, and I ran up stairs to
the room that was green with all the dolls in it..(ya creepy I know)....and
I ran and hid under the bed..(nice place to hide huh?? with all those big
spiders..ewww) and I remember looking up to the door from under the bed
and I saw something run past the door and I was like ahh big relief they
didnt check in here..THEN the door slammed and i ran out from under the
bed and I tried to open the door and it wouldnt open I heard something
whisper my name and I turned around and I looked at the glass dolls and
their heads were all turned faceing me an one of their arms were up in
the air like it was reaching out to me..Finally I got the door open and
I found my cousins and asked them If they ran past that door and they said
they didnt even go up stairs.......</B>
<BR><B>EXPERIENCE # 5</B>
<BR><B>My grandma was watching my cousins and I and we were all laying
in that huge living room with all the lights off in the houseand we were
watching Lady and the Tramp, and we heard chains rattleing(I know that
in every corny horror movie there are always chains rattleing and whispering
but this was real) and we heard slamming of cabinets and silverwear makeing
noises like somebody was moveing their hands around in a drawer full of
it and we heard children laughing and talking..then we heard a scream.&nbsp;
my grandma covered our ears and closed her eyes then got up and walked
in the kitchen and turned on the light and there was a chunk of hair on
the ground a little bit of blonde hair.&nbsp; my grandma turned around
to see if we were looking at what she had seen but she didnt see any of
us looking at her..I covered myself in the dark corner so my grandma couldn't
see me so she never knew I saw what she saw.</B>
<BR><B>There are other experiences that I myself, and my mom and her brothers
and sisters have experienced but I dont think I would have enough typeing
space left.&nbsp; Were these paranormal experiences wanting to play?&nbsp;
Were these ghosts kids? maybe but I guess we will never know.&nbsp; My
grandperants moved out of that house around 95' and got a trailer about
3 miles away from that old house. From what I heard about that house, a
couple moved in there and were scared and burnt the house down.&nbsp; I
wish that I was still in that house now that im older because I could have
fun checking up on those ghosts.&nbsp; That is something that I want to
do when I get older im only 15.&nbsp; But now I have some new experiences
with this house that I told you about In THERE'S SOMETHING IN MY HOUSE

<P><B>Precognition</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tonyryan@canada.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>So, ghosts are unimaginably malicious and supposedly</B>
<BR><B>caught only at night when we are alone and vulnerable</B>
<BR><B>to imagination and the suggestions loneliness can</B>
<BR><B>inspire.</B>
<BR><B>Yet, I have never known this to be accurate.</B>
<BR><B>Ok, we live in the smallest town in Newfoundland and</B>
<BR><B>maybe a little isolated but there is a series of</B>
<BR><B>encounters that have made my self proclaimed logical</B>
<BR><B>scientific mind accept the experiences as, if not</B>
<BR><B>natural in terms of science, being common and real.</B>
<BR><B>I was surprised and relieved to hear sensitivity</B>
<BR><B>mentioned in the movie “The Shipping News.” It helped</B>
<BR><B>add a broader acceptance to this and deepen the</B>
<BR><B>mystery. My mother and I seem sensitive to those that</B>
<BR><B>recently departed and even those about to leave this</B>
<BR><B>world. Or at least aberrations seem to happen around</B>
<BR><B>the time of someone’s leaving us.</B>
<BR><B>On her return from a February evening walk, I had heard</B>
<BR><B>my mother say to my grandfather it was strange he was</B>
<BR><B>sitting on the couch when he was just outside stacking</B>
<BR><B>wood and told her there was a lot he had cut in</B>
<BR><B>someplace other than his usual spot, enough for a</B>
<BR><B>winter.</B>
<BR><B>He agreed there was more wood in that spot and laughed,</B>
<BR><B>but a few minutes later, he was dead.</B>
<BR><B>Next morning I was walking with an uncle and my younger</B>
<BR><B>brother when we saw a large blue ball of shimmering</B>
<BR><B>light appear, fall to the ocean, and, after breaking</B>
<BR><B>into seven smaller balls, dissipated before touching</B>
<BR><B>the calm morning water, never making a sound.</B>
<BR><B>Eight months later a friend and I walked outside in the</B>
<BR><B>starry dark of an autumn night to see half a rainbow</B>
<BR><B>appear at apex then travel downward to disappear from</B>
<BR><B>that point after the bottom went behind the trees. It</B>
<BR><B>was in the direction of the graveyard and when told,</B>
<BR><B>our story was explained as its being someone who had</B>
<BR><B>died in Ontario that morning amid controversy over his</B>
<BR><B>family’s inability or unwillingness to bury him at</B>
<BR><B>home. People accepted the as being the truth.</B>
<BR><B>When my grandmother died, I was sitting with a friend</B>
<BR><B>at my mother’s house when a knock came on the</B>
<BR><B>door…twice. Second time I was in no hurry to go out to</B>
<BR><B>see nobody was there, but went after three more sets of</B>
<BR><B>three knocks…still nobody there. So, we went out for</B>
<BR><B>the evening.</B>
<BR><B>A older friend of my grandmother’s came that morning to</B>
<BR><B>ask why my grandmother was outside her house walking</B>
<BR><B>around talking to herself while wearing a brown dress</B>
<BR><B>with a white blouse, she was supposed to be in</B>
<BR><B>hospital. These were the clothes my grandmother was to</B>
<BR><B>be buried in and the lady I am talking about had no</B>
<BR><B>idea grandmother had died.</B>
<BR><B>Another relation died and before my mother found out,</B>
<BR><B>she had asked a friend to come see someone walking</B>
<BR><B>around the graveyard just across the road from the</B>
<BR><B>house. The person had ignored the gate, jumped the</B>
<BR><B>fence, walked in, and seemed to be looking for someone</B>
<BR><B>special but had gone in the few seconds mother’s</B>
<BR><B>attention was on the other lady.</B>
<BR><B>It hasn’t stopped although I have been away from the</B>
<BR><B>country for years. I got the call to come home to see</B>
<BR><B>my never before met dad before he died. There had been</B>
<BR><B>some problems getting the news to me in China so when I</B>
<BR><B>heard, I left right away only to spend the night in</B>
<BR><B>Vancouver with friends. As I was on China time, I was</B>
<BR><B>awake at 12:45 am and overcome by a need to be outside.</B>
<BR><B>I walked out to sit on the steps and closed my eyes in</B>
<BR><B>a feeling of nausea I had never experienced before. It</B>
<BR><B>lasted a long time, and when my eyes were closed I saw</B>
<BR><B>a door, huge and heavy looking and although so very</B>
<BR><B>bright, I could see detail. The door stayed for a few</B>
<BR><B>seconds before starting to close together from the</B>
<BR><B>corners until only a slit remained before the light</B>
<BR><B>finally turned off. I became physically ill and after a</B>
<BR><B>few minutes walked inside to see it was just after 1:00</B>
<BR><B>am. My father was pronounced dead at 5:35 am</B>
<BR><B>Newfoundland time, 1:05 am in Vancouver.</B>
<BR><B>Of course, I told my mother this and she revealed how</B>
<BR><B>he had been there twice in the past two weeks. First</B>
<BR><B>time it happened at 5:30am, about a week before, and</B>
<BR><B>then at 5:30 the morning he died. She knew this, as</B>
<BR><B>this is when her husband gets up for work. A knock had</B>
<BR><B>come on the front (never used) door just before the</B>
<BR><B>alarm rang. Waking both, and upon inspection, nobody</B>
<BR><B>was found and there were no tracks in the half meter of</B>
<BR><B>snow on the deck.</B>
<BR><B>Although I would rather see death notices by e-mail or</B>
<BR><B>in the papers, it seems there are events we cannot</B>
<BR><B>explain. I would love to see something like this when</B>
<BR><B>someone is born, what a way to come into the world but</B>
<BR><B>whatever makes it happen it is not scary as ghost</B>
<BR><B>stories usually are. Instead, it has slowly become a</B>
<BR><B>fact of death, totally acceptable and worth talking</B>
<BR><B>about.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Not Really a Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bradolrich@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi guys... I've been checking out your site for a while now, reading
these true ghost experiences and all, and I thought I would take the time
to submit what happened to me back in 1978.&nbsp; Now, for starters, you
have to understand that (to paraphrase a line from Stephen King's "Rose
Red") I'm about as psychic as a ham sandwich.&nbsp; I'm a 37 year-old graphic
designer for Central Michigan University and am pretty much a realist.&nbsp;
What happened to me isn't so much a ghost story but just a incident that
has baffled me for over 20 years.&nbsp; it all started one day when I was
in Jr. High.&nbsp; It was 1978, and happened to read in the TV Guide that
Gene Simmons of KISS was going to appear on the Mike Douglas show.&nbsp;
Well, I thought that was pretty cool and decided to stay home sick from
school to see it (this was years before VCR's, remember).&nbsp; So I told
my mother I didn't feel well and she went off to work leaving me home alone,
as my dad had left a few hours earlier.&nbsp; This is where things got
a little odd...I was lying on the couch watching the tube when I heard
a noise from outside that sounded like a car door opening.&nbsp; I looked
out the front window of the house to see my sister-in-law unloading laundry
from the back of her car, with her small dog Risko running around her legs.&nbsp;
My brother and sister-in-law had only been married for a few months and
lived just a short drive away, so it wasn't uncommon for her to come over
to do the occasional load in our washer and dryer.&nbsp; Seeing that she
probably would need a hand, I went down the steps to the front door.&nbsp;
But when I opened it, she, the car, the dog, and the laundry were nowhere
to be seen.&nbsp; Somewhat confused, I thought maybe she somehow managed
to drive around to the back of the house (it would've had to have been
impossibly fast, but it was the only logical thing I could think of) so
I went around back.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; I went back in the house and sat
down on the couch for a minute, trying to figure out what just happened.&nbsp;
After a minute, I called up my brother's place and (in one of the weirdest
phone calls he probably ever got) asked him if his wife had come over to
do laundry that morning.&nbsp; He said, "No, she's here right now." and
then I tried to explain what had happened to me, only to get skeptical
silence on the other end of the line.&nbsp; Later that day, when I told
my mother of the incident, she said that since I was ill, I must've fallen
asleep on the couch and dreamt the entire thing.&nbsp; Well, the problem
with that theory was that I wasn't sick.&nbsp; I was faking.&nbsp; Also
I know for a fact I was wide awake because right about the time I first
heard the car door, Gene Simmons was in a sketch with Cher and Mike Douglas
(that I've since seen a tape of!) that I specifically stayed home from
school to see.&nbsp; Now, my sister-in-law is still alive and well, so
this wasn't a ghostly situation.&nbsp; And since it was such a mundane
thing to witness, I seriously doubt any deep seated emotional trauma was
seared into the aura of the place.&nbsp; Could it have been just one of
those "Time-Slip"?&nbsp; Beats me.&nbsp; If anyone else has seen anything
similar, let me know.&nbsp; Thanks</B>

<P><B>Kingdom Hospital</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: charlesjoyner2003@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>During the Civil war, a building known as Gates falls mill, was
used to make uniforms for the soldiers. It was ran like a sweatshop. It
was so bad that they used children to bleach and dye the material. This
exposed them to dangerous chemicals and boiling water. The building caught
fire destroying the building and killing the children. Later the Gatewright
Hospital was built on the land. There were gruesome and unnecessary surgeries
(Lobotomies-removal of half the brain) which ended many more lives. In
1939 The hospital burnt to the ground, and once again the hospital was
rebuilt, now known as Kingdom Hospital. Reports of the building trembling
(only the building nothing else moved during this trembling) voices, Children
crying (which has been caught on tape) strange sounds such as bells ringing
have been heard. Full bodied apparitions (Also caught on tape) typical
haunting symptoms such as doors opening/closing on there own, cold/hot
spots, things missing when you just turned your back for a second. The
most bizarre (In my mind) is the newest part of the building is decaying.
Repairs have been attempted but the next day the repairs are as they were
be re, decaying. The hospital administration denies any of this. The hospital
remains open to patients.</B>
<BR><B>PS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This the same Kingdom Hospital in Stephen
Kings book (and up-coming series Kingdom Hospital)&nbsp; "Journals of Elenor
Druse"</B>
<BR><B>PSS. Elenor or Sally as she is known by her friends, is a career
spiritualist, who has been investigating this hospital most of her life.
She sent her journals to Stephen King so he could help her bring the truth
into the light. In a recent interview she said "I only want to help the
poor children find peace."</B>

<BR><B>Ghost House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: hartatak@alaweb.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is an account of one of my classmates. She was visiting her
aunt</B>
<BR><B>who lives in an old plantation house in Tennesse. Every night she
was</B>
<BR><B>there she heard footsteps in the hallway. At one point her door
opened</B>
<BR><B>and slammed. She asked her aunt and she told her that it happened
to her</B>
<BR><B>when she first moved in but doesnt notice it anymore. It was after</B>
<BR><B>everyone had went to bed. The next night apart from the footsteps
in the</B>
<BR><B>hall she heard footsteps above her. The next day she and her brother</B>
<BR><B>went to explore the basement. As they were coming down the stairs
they</B>
<BR><B>heard a scream from below them in the basement. They ran back up
the</B>
<BR><B>stairs screaming. They called their parents and left there the next
day.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;A Dream?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jason9820@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>About 6 months ago I was in bed one night and I awoke to see a woman
standiong over me and at first I thought it was my mom but then this woman
changed in to an evil entity and tried to choke and I obviously was scared
s---less I closed my eyes and the next thing I knew it was morning and
I wasn't sure if I had drempt the whole incident or I was visited by an
evil entity my parents thought that the whole incident was my imagination
from being up til the early morning and overworking myself but I thought
it was too real to be just a dream but I have heard of some pretty intense
dreams and even more freaky is that I myself have had several dreams that
felt real and forshadowed future events but this isn't a common thing Thank
God!!&nbsp; I told this experience to a friend who is from native american
decent and thinks that if were a dream maybe something was trying to either
warn me or tell me something and if was really a spirit then I have big
problems but luckily I have had no other occerences of this or anything
else other then my excurtions in to the Haunted woods.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Haunted Village Home</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: minkcat@fastmail.fm</B><B></B>

<P><B>hello. my name is sara and i come from north yorkshire in the uk.
i have</B>
<BR><B>a story about my best friends house where she lived with her mum
from the</B>
<BR><B>age of about 4 till she was 15. it was a very old victorian house,</B>
<BR><B>eventually we traced who built it. a man called jermiah thistlethwaite</B>
<BR><B>who built a lot of houses in the village we lived in, called great
ayton.</B>
<BR><B>i can remember emma (thats my best friend) coming into school when
we</B>
<BR><B>were really little and talking about the understairs cupboard, she
used</B>
<BR><B>to say how the rustling of the bags inside it would keep her awake
at</B>
<BR><B>night, and complained that things kept going missing from her room.
I</B>
<BR><B>finally visited the house for the first time when i was 8, as i
lived in</B>
<BR><B>a different town then. I was there to celebrate the lighting of
the</B>
<BR><B>beacon (to commemorate the spanish armada)and it was the first time
i'd</B>
<BR><B>stayed in her home. It was all pretty normal actually, things weren't</B>
<BR><B>even spooky until i woke in the night to find the lamp on the other
side</B>
<BR><B>of the room was switched back on. i got up and turned it off. three
more</B>
<BR><B>times that night i woke to find it back on. emma said she had had
to turn</B>
<BR><B>it off twice herself. Anyway a year later i moved into the same
village,</B>
<BR><B>just down the road so i spent a lot more time there. We always noticed</B>
<BR><B>strange things like lights going out for inexplicable reasons, and
stuff</B>
<BR><B>going missing. i remember the weirdest time i noticed that most
was when</B>
<BR><B>i went over one day, and put my cup down infront of me, we were
both sat</B>
<BR><B>watching the t.v for a while and when i reached to pick it back
up it</B>
<BR><B>wasnt there. it wasnt anywhere in the room. i was confused and annoyed,</B>
<BR><B>so i got up and went back into the kitchen, 3 rooms away, and there
was</B>
<BR><B>my cup of tea, on top of the fridge, stone cold. what is strangest
about</B>
<BR><B>this is it was a very tall frigde, and i know for a fact in my whole
time</B>
<BR><B>going to that house i never once put anything up there. it was dusty
and</B>
<BR><B>grimy, usually inhabited by spiders.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway i put it to the back of my head, i think i just didnt want
to</B>
<BR><B>entertain any notion of spooky goings on. Similar things happened
over</B>
<BR><B>the years, but the worst of it came when she and i reached 13. this
is</B>
<BR><B>the age where a lot of paranormal stuff starts happening around
girls i</B>
<BR><B>have heard, and i can certainly believe there is something in the
notion</B>
<BR><B>that paranormal happenings can be related to the turbulence of puberty.</B>
<BR><B>What was noticable was the turn in atmosphere from previously</B>
<BR><B>mischievious and prankish behaviour to out and out cruel, frightening
and</B>
<BR><B>bordering on evil behaviour from whatever these spirits were.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we were 13, emma and i, along with her twin
brother were all sat</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the dining room with their mum who was drinking
coffee. She had a</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coffee table about 4by4 feet and placed her cup
on the middle, dead</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on (she was a slightly obsessive woman) and got
up to find her</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; newspaper. Well we just sat talking amongst ourselves
and then we</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heard a sort of scratching noise coming from
the table, we thought</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that was pretty weird. Then, just as we turned
to look at it the cup</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flew, as if someone had literally batted it with
their hand, right</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; across the room and smashed against the wall.
again we were all</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incredibly shocked and taken aback but didnt
want to believe what we</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had seen. emma's brother, john, in particular
was always trying to</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; find the rational explanation for these things.
He said, with a</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; straight face, that 'maybe it just fell off'.
yes it magically 'fell'</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a whole 9 feet away in a straight line into a
wall, very convincing!</B>
<BR><B>Anyway that was just the start of it. We started hearing this horrible</B>
<BR><B>breathing coming from a certain point in the kitchen, just as you
got to</B>
<BR><B>the outhouse door u could hear it sometimes. we even heard it from
the</B>
<BR><B>adjoining dining room, it was that loud. it scared the hell out
of us.</B>
<BR><B>Another odd thing was that if u went up onto the third floor (the
old</B>
<BR><B>servants quarters when the house was first built) just as you got
to the</B>
<BR><B>top of the stairs sometimes you felt really scared, and like something</B>
<BR><B>was constricting your throat.</B>
<BR><B>That was the least of our worries comparatively speaking. One night,</B>
<BR><B>emma's mum went out with her friends for some drinks in the local
pub. I</B>
<BR><B>said i'd stay over with emma so she wasnt on her own in the house
(nobody</B>
<BR><B>could stand to be there alone, it was that bad.) The whole night
we sat</B>
<BR><B>around watching the t.v and playing board games, smoking cigarettes
until</B>
<BR><B>it was&nbsp; inevitably time to go to bed. that was the time i always
dreaded</B>
<BR><B>most. I fell into a very deep sleep that night, but awoke about
2 am to</B>
<BR><B>the noise of a music box playing. that was weird, i thought, then
i</B>
<BR><B>realised the sound was coming from inside the built in cupboard,
i was</B>
<BR><B>scared but i got up and went over to the door of the cupboard and
started</B>
<BR><B>to open it. when i did i heard a rushing sound, the music box stopped</B>
<BR><B>playing and i swear i heard something say 'out' in a breathy, hoarse</B>
<BR><B>voice.</B>
<BR><B>i froze, emma, who was sharing the bed, got up and asked me what
i was</B>
<BR><B>doing. i said 'nothing, go back to sleep' coz i didnt want to frighten</B>
<BR><B>her. i got back into bed hurriedly and pulled the covers over my
head. i</B>
<BR><B>can't explain why i didnt just run out of the room, or the house,
i</B>
<BR><B>couldnt leave my friend and i again thought beyond all rationality
that i</B>
<BR><B>must have just imagined it all. its amazing how much we can pretend</B>
<BR><B>things arent real when its glaringly obvious they are!</B>
<BR><B>well i somehow managed to get back to sleep, and i slept really
deeply</B>
<BR><B>again until the next morning, when emma told me something else had</B>
<BR><B>happened while i'd been sleeping. She said how during the night
she had</B>
<BR><B>awoken to see me sitting up in bed, and asked me what i was doing.
She</B>
<BR><B>said that then what she thought was me, turned its head around and
she</B>
<BR><B>saw it was actually the figure of a woman, with her hair tied back
in a</B>
<BR><B>severe bun, and she grinned at her. She said it was worse that this
woman</B>
<BR><B>had no eyeballs and her grin looked skeletal. She said when she
looked</B>
<BR><B>down, the woman was sitting right on me, her body going into my
legs. I</B>
<BR><B>was so terrified i couldnt even move myself out of bed, and silly
as it</B>
<BR><B>sounds, she had to pick me up and carry me out.</B>
<BR><B>Not long after this, her grandparents stayed in that room. They
locked</B>
<BR><B>the door at night because they had heard about the goings on. In
the</B>
<BR><B>middle of the night, the door handle began to rattle. The door unlocked,</B>
<BR><B>and they could hear three figures running about the room, her gran
could</B>
<BR><B>just make out&nbsp; shadow like figures in the dark. the clock on
the bedside</B>
<BR><B>table was smashed on the floor. The next day her granddad was so</B>
<BR><B>traumatised he could not speak. That was a particularly bad room.
The</B>
<BR><B>worst was in the servants quarters again- where emma's mum slept.
One</B>
<BR><B>morning she came down to tell us that she had woken in the night
to see a</B>
<BR><B>young teenage girl stood at the end of her bed, in victorian clothing,</B>
<BR><B>with her arms outstretched mouthing the words 'help me'. That was</B>
<BR><B>frightening enough, but i recall a night there about a fortnight
later</B>
<BR><B>where emma woke me up from my sleep because i was screaming at the
top of</B>
<BR><B>my lungs 'help me! help me!'. It may be unrelated, and i can't remember</B>
<BR><B>the dream i had, usually when i have those sleep talking/shouting</B>
<BR><B>episodes i never remember the dream.</B>
<BR><B>Things just started to get really frightening. weird swirling black</B>
<BR><B>things appeared on</B>
<BR><B>several occasions over</B>
<BR><B>some months. I stopped being able to stay there, it was just too</B>
<BR><B>unbearable. Finally they had the house blessed by a priest, which
made</B>
<BR><B>things worse. Banging on the walls, voices shouting and things getting</B>
<BR><B>thrown around became commonplace. Eventually emma's mum called a</B>
<BR><B>spiritualist church and asked them to come and exorcise the house.
It was</B>
<BR><B>a last resort because they were at the end of their tether. I wasnt
there</B>
<BR><B>when it transpired, but my friend relayed it to me in great detail.
as</B>
<BR><B>soon as they came to the house, in the first two rooms, the man
commented</B>
<BR><B>there was such a feeling of suffering, and then when he passed the</B>
<BR><B>cupboard where emma had always heard rustlings and knockings, he
stopped</B>
<BR><B>and said he felt great pain and sorrow. He went on to tell them
that the</B>
<BR><B>boys who lived there had very cruelly locked a young servant girl
in</B>
<BR><B>there, and she remained there for some time, he couldnt specify
how long.</B>
<BR><B>He did say that she was extremely traumatised by the event, and
had never</B>
<BR><B>been the same. Moving around the house he commented that there were</B>
<BR><B>several things going on. Some of the spirits as he called&nbsp;
them, were</B>
<BR><B>merely sad, and had not been able to pass on to the next life. Others
he</B>
<BR><B>said, and he could not be sure of how many, were altogether different.</B>
<BR><B>They were evil he called them, malevolent forces. He told us sometimes</B>
<BR><B>the benevolent spirits were not a threat, and not to be afraid.
The</B>
<BR><B>others, he said, should be expelled immediately, they were causing</B>
<BR><B>illnesses (this was true, emma's mum was always suffering from colds,</B>
<BR><B>unexplained pains, that sort of thing though i am inclined to suggest</B>
<BR><B>these may well have been psycho-somatic illnesses brought on by
the</B>
<BR><B>stress of living with ghosts) and they wanted to get the family
out of</B>
<BR><B>the house. When he got to the top floor, he was just with emma's
mum, she</B>
<BR><B>was told to stay downstairs with the others. This is when he told
her</B>
<BR><B>what had happened up there, which was a probable cause of the restriction</B>
<BR><B>feeling around the neck when we would walk there. A woman who lived
there</B>
<BR><B>had hanged herself from the banister in the servants quarters, she
had</B>
<BR><B>been terribly sad for a very long time the man told her. This we
were not</B>
<BR><B>told for some years. In fact only last year, nearly 7 seven years
later,</B>
<BR><B>did we learn of it. the way we found out was that emma had a dream
where</B>
<BR><B>a woman in a purple outfit was hanging herself over and over again.
she</B>
<BR><B>told her mum about it over the phone the next day. she went silent
for a</B>
<BR><B>minute and asked her to repeat what she'd said and then sighed.
She</B>
<BR><B>relayed to her what the spiritualist had told her all those years
before.</B>
<BR><B>Long story short, they performed an exorcism of sorts, i dont quite
know</B>
<BR><B>a lot about these things so i cant say how reputable that claim
is. Well</B>
<BR><B>it did quieten down after that. There were, however, warm feelings
around</B>
<BR><B>the house. The sad feeling seemed to go, and the girl spirit in</B>
<BR><B>particular (who emma saw, she has always been able to see ghosts,
i could</B>
<BR><B>only see what they did, or hear them) appeared to be smiling when
she</B>
<BR><B>made apparitions, which became fleeting and few.</B>
<BR><B>Eventually we thought they had gone. The house was even remotely
peaceful</B>
<BR><B>for a while</B>
<BR><B>until one day it just started back up, i believe it's just possible
that</B>
<BR><B>this was due to</B>
<BR><B>the ammendments emma's mum made to the house, she redecorated and
put up</B>
<BR><B>a wall in one of the</B>
<BR><B>large rooms to create 2 smaller rooms.</B>
<BR><B>Everything was just as bad as it was before. The worst night was
when</B>
<BR><B>emma's</B>
<BR><B>mum and her boyfriend at that time were having a few drinks and
watching</B>
<BR><B>the t.v. some of their friends called round and they stayed up chatting.</B>
<BR><B>emma's mum started saying how she hated the ghosts and wished they
would</B>
<BR><B>leave the house, her boyfried warned her to stop talking like that</B>
<BR><B>because it would possibly make them angry (he was a self professed</B>
<BR><B>clairvoyant) She laughed and said it was up to her how she spoke
to them.</B>
<BR><B>She then went to turn the lamp off and something very weird happened.
a</B>
<BR><B>brilliant white light whooshed up from her wrist, up her arm, over
her</B>
<BR><B>shoulder, head and over the other arm, then shot off the end of
her hand</B>
<BR><B>and seemed to go into the floor. there wasnt any sign of a burn
mark on</B>
<BR><B>her body, or the carpet, the lamp never flickered once and most
of all</B>
<BR><B>she said she felt freezing cold when it went over her. Perhaps it
is a</B>
<BR><B>natural phenomenon i dont know about but she was incredibly spooked
and</B>
<BR><B>never spoke badly of them again.</B>
<BR><B>Well thats most of the story, emma and i both stopped going there,</B>
<BR><B>especially to stay. she lived mostly with her dad in a different
town</B>
<BR><B>after that, i dont blame her. Her mum sold the house about 3 years
ago</B>
<BR><B>and i believe a family have moved in with small children. I just
hope</B>
<BR><B>that they don't have the same experiences as we had. It was really</B>
<BR><B>frightening and i will never be able to put out of my head the horrible</B>
<BR><B>experiences i had there. i dont have a religious belief at all,
in fact i</B>
<BR><B>consider myself thoroughly agnostic, but i know there must be some</B>
<BR><B>explanation for what happened. I don't know what caused those events,
but</B>
<BR><B>it is as close to evil or malevolent as i can imagine.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway thanks for listening to my story, i hope it is of interest.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Car</B><B></B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>While surfing i found your site and like it!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's
something that happened to me in 1982 when i was around 26 years of age.&nbsp;
I worked as a security guard for Guido Lingle pipe yard nights for extra
money to support my beautiful little daughter.&nbsp; Directly across the
road was a large cemetary, this is in Pearland Texas close to where i live
in Houston right now.&nbsp; I remember at nights at times i would hear
talking like groups of persons mumbling, and would shine my bright flash
light around that cemetary and see no one, but it didn't bother me, because
i believe in Jesus Christ and if we believe in him the dead cannot harm
the living.&nbsp; But anyway, i bought this Cadillac that was about 12
years old and it was a beautiful white color!!!&nbsp; I guess it was a
hobby type thing and i would polish and always be cleaning that car while
working those weekend nights, one time i was putting tire shine on the
tires at about 1:00 A.M and felt someone was over my shoulder, i looked
up and saw no one, but in my minds eye could see an older man smiling that
was thin and a tad shorter than me that appeared to be around 75, and in
my mind i could read him saying, that looks so pretty and nice your car.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghosts by My Bed</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Carpacompany@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>this story was told to me by my mother a while ago she was in&nbsp;
bed one night when she woke up and saw 2 men and a woman pulling at her
feet... on her neck my mother has a necklace with a cross and a locket...
in the locket my mom has a prayer instead of a picture..... my mom was
trying to wake up my dad and it didnt work she held tightly on her necklace
and the people on the end of her bed let go and they left the odd thing
about this is that my mom was terrified in the morning so she called my
aunt to tell her about her ordeal now the really odd thing is was that
my aunt saw the same three people at the foot of her bed on the same night
and we live in washington state my aunt lives in south america</B>

<P><B>An Angel</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: weldongl@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Gabriel and I would like to share one early memory of
a</B>
<BR><B>supernatural event. I think that I was too young to really SEE what
I saw</B>
<BR><B>but that what I saw was a manifestation of what I had been asking
to see. I</B>
<BR><B>was around 8-9 yrs old (I am 37 now). This story is similar to the
one about</B>
<BR><B>the priest who prayed to see a daemon, but is just the opposite
as I had</B>
<BR><B>“prayed” to see an angel.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I must have asked every night for the vision for maybe a week</B>
<BR><B>and one night I “woke up” and sat up in bed to look out the window
of my</B>
<BR><B>room in anticipation of my desire to witness an angel. As I stared
out the</B>
<BR><B>window not knowing where else to look, a textbook image of an angel
floated</B>
<BR><B>down into my view as if making a special appearance for my eyes
only. As I</B>
<BR><B>gazed upon this being I was struck by a lightning bolt coming straight
down</B>
<BR><B>into my body through the top of my head. This singular event overcame
my</B>
<BR><B>view of seeing an angel and I recoiled in quite literally shock
and terror</B>
<BR><B>at what had just happened. As I turned on the bed looking for something
or</B>
<BR><B>somewhere to “recover”, a shadowy figure came into the room and
sat beside</B>
<BR><B>me to console me. It was my mother who simply helped me to absorb
the</B>
<BR><B>experience without any more fear. Who, or what else could have done
the same</B>
<BR><B>I always wonder?</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was living with my grandparents at the time and my mother was</B>
<BR><B>in the house on that night though she did not dream it as I had.
I did tell</B>
<BR><B>both my mother and hers and it was accepted as a religious type
of</B>
<BR><B>experience.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have many powerful stories that I could write about, but I</B>
<BR><B>believe they, and especially dreams are a personal journey that
must be</B>
<BR><B>undertaken alone. Though, I also greatly desire companionship along
the way,</B>
<BR><B>as it is both a terrifying and deeply profound awareness that the
proper</B>
<BR><B>allies, as it were, could be most beneficial in accompaniment. For
myself, I</B>
<BR><B>believe I could be further along if my “upbringing” had been more
stabile</B>
<BR><B>and nurturing. Sure, anyone with the proper care could be made to
be more</B>
<BR><B>aware. But as my grandmother says (not the one in my story) “there
is a</B>
<BR><B>reason for everything that happens”. Maybe one day I can share a
truly</B>
<BR><B>wonderful story of awareness and exploration. That would be nice.</B>

<P><B>This experience was so frightening that I fear that sharing it will
make it</B>
<BR><B>happen again.&nbsp; Well, here goes anyway.&nbsp; Sometimes I have
a hard time falling</B>
<BR><B>asleep. Often I'll lay in bed for hours staring into nothingness.&nbsp;
At some</B>
<BR><B>point in the night I drift off into sleep.&nbsp; One night I was
really restless</B>
<BR><B>and and I kept drinfting in and out of consciousness.&nbsp; At one
point I woke</B>
<BR><B>up and above me at the end of my bed were three dark figures.&nbsp;
A short one</B>
<BR><B>on the left, a taller one in the middle, and an other sorter figure
on the</B>
<BR><B>right. They were hovering and looking down at me with such a dark
force that</B>
<BR><B>it paralyzed my body.&nbsp; These beings were absences of light
and energy.</B>
<BR><B>Human shaped voids.&nbsp;&nbsp; I kept trying to get up and turn
the light on but</B>
<BR><B>everytime I did so I would wake up and realize that the lights were
stll off</B>
<BR><B>and the shadows were still there.&nbsp; I did this about half a
dozen times with</B>
<BR><B>no avail.&nbsp; Not only only could I not get up but it felt as
though I was</B>
<BR><B>getting pushed into the bed.&nbsp; The shadows sucked so much energy
out of me</B>
<BR><B>that a passed out and awoke in the mornig.&nbsp; They are what I
would assume</B>
<BR><B>"death" would look like but there were three of them. There was
no distinct</B>
<BR><B>features.&nbsp; They didn't seem to have necks, there heads melted
into their</B>
<BR><B>bodies in the shape of a cloak.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not sure why they visited me.&nbsp; Iv'e
always considered my self an</B>
<BR><B>exceptionally good person.&nbsp; I have a lot of psychic tendencies
also.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>think these qualities attracted the shadow figures and they&nbsp;
were trying to</B>
<BR><B>intimidate me.&nbsp; I havn't seen these shadows again sense that
night but I</B>
<BR><B>have experienced the parilized feeling a number of times.&nbsp;
One time I walked</B>
<BR><B>about my house and realized that I couldn't pick anyting up or turn
any</B>
<BR><B>lights on.&nbsp; At that point it donned on me that I was having
an out of body</B>
<BR><B>experience.&nbsp; That is why I felt paralized because my spirit
was outside of</B>
<BR><B>my body and I was seeing things through the spirit world.&nbsp;
Even though these</B>
<BR><B>experiences have been traumatic they reassure me that there is more
to life</B>
<BR><B>than the phisical realm.&nbsp; I have had other spiritual experiences
but these</B>
<BR><B>were the most vivid.</B>

<BR><B>Hello, I have a ghost story for you to read. This is a true story,
me my mom and my dad used to go to my aunt may and uncle Burt's house in
Newyork, when i was a child, ages 8 to 14.</B>
<BR><B>Every time we came to visit something would happen. Like Tv's would
turn on and off in the middle of the night. Water faucets would start running
for no reason. Everyone in the house would be sleeping.I would hear chains
being dragged across the floor,and down the stairs. Keep in mind the house
was very old. My mother is very religious, and these things would scare
her. Also one time that i can remember, i think it was the last time we
were in the house. My mother was walking toward the top of the stairs from
her bedroom, and there was a Big buddha statue that was at the top of the
stairs. My mom watched a black demon like figure come out of that statue
and look her right in the eyes. She began to pray and walk toward the demon.
She said it tried to push her down the stairs. She began screaming (still
praying) and the demon like figure just vanished into thin air. that night
we all heard footsteps in the attic like someone running from one end of
the house to the other. That was the last night we stayed there.</B>

<P><B>Claremont Thompson Creek Woods</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: BIGGESTxCOLDxFAN@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>in september of 2003 me and 9 of my friends came across this website
and read through it all. we decided that we should all go to thompson creek
woods in claremont and see what it was all about. and that was the most
horrible night of my life. i remember when we first got there we heard
screams and laughter of little kids but didnt think to much of it. we told
ourselves there was probably other people there but thinking back there
was only one place to park and no other cars were there. so we hiked pretty
far in still hearing the screams and laughter but it was weird because
it would sound really far away and then close and then far away again.
that was pretty much it untill about a half an hour of walking later there
were rocks being thrown at us. my friend fell into the rivene and his shirt
was torn off. it wasnt till we got back to the car that we noticed he had
blood all down his back as if someone took their nails and scratched them
down his back, but he had no cuts. we left and went back to our friends
house and when we got there we noticed that all down the side of my friends
car was blood. and all over the handle as if whoever or whatever tried
to get in the car. but it was weird cause we didnt notice it before we
left and&nbsp; all 10 of us were standing on that side off the car before
we left. then we notcied that blood was all over the back of my friends
jacket. after that i went to my boyfriends house and he noticed that i
had blood all down the side of my neck. he licked his finger to wipe off
the blood to see where the cut was and i didnt have one. but when we were
there i accuessed my friend of spitting on me when i felt it drip down
my neck but he swore he didnt. but it didnt feel like someone spit it felt
like it dripped from above but when i looked up it was like a canopy of
trees over us. you couldnt even see the sky. after that i looked back at
the website and read about the bleeding trees and i know that is what it
was cause it couldnt have been anything else. it was the scariest night
of our lives and none of us would ever go back ever again. words cant even
explain how horrible the fear was. as hard as we try to explain when we
tell our story it doesnt even come close. to know what we mean it has to
be experienced but i wish i could take that night back i dont think anything
could compare to that feeling we all felt it was the scariest s**t ever</B><B></B>

<P><B>WE WERE NOT THE ONLY TENANTS OF OUR APARTMENT</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jillerini@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My boyfriend and I lived in our last apartment for two and a half
years. In</B>
<BR><B>that time, we had quite a few unexplainable things happen. I will
only</B>
<BR><B>describe a few. The first thing I can remember happening was when
my</B>
<BR><B>boyfriend and I were standing in the short hallway right outside
of the</B>
<BR><B>closed bedroom door. We both heard, at the same time, a knocking
on the</B>
<BR><B>other side of the door, about head height. We looked at each other
and I</B>
<BR><B>said, "I'm not going in there." My boyfriend checked out the room
and there</B>
<BR><B>was no one in there and nothing that we could see could have made
that</B>
<BR><B>particular noise. It could not have been noise from another apartment
as it</B>
<BR><B>was definitely about head height.</B>
<BR><B>The next odd thing that happened was about 3 am in the morning.
We were</B>
<BR><B>sleeping and we were awakened by our dog's frenzied barking and
growling.</B>
<BR><B>Our dog sleeps on the bed with us and he was standing at the foot
of the</B>
<BR><B>bed, facing away from us toward the opposite wall, barking and growling
and</B>
<BR><B>bristling. At the time, we had a small aquarium with lizards in
it and by</B>
<BR><B>the light of the aquarium, we could see nothing that would affect
the dog</B>
<BR><B>like that; no insect or spider or moving shadows on the wall. We
calmed</B>
<BR><B>Mickey as best we could and got him to sit, but he would not lay
back down</B>
<BR><B>and rest. The whole time I stayed awake (probably about 30 minutes
after)</B>
<BR><B>Mickey was sitting, staring intently, hackles raised and tracking
something</B>
<BR><B>back and forth on the wall. I did fall back asleep and we were awakened
a</B>
<BR><B>second time with the exact same scenario. Again, we saw nothing.</B>
<BR><B>That one was scary, but the scariest thing that happened to me was
one</B>
<BR><B>morning when I had just awakened and was laying on the bed with
my back to</B>
<BR><B>the open door of bedroom. I heard my name...and it sounded like
someone had</B>
<BR><B>burped it out. "Jill." You know what it sounds like when someone
burps out a</B>
<BR><B>word, right? Kind of gruff sounding. I turned over, fully expecting
it to be</B>
<BR><B>my boyfriend and there was no one there. I realized then that I
could hear</B>
<BR><B>my boyfriend in the bathroom in the shower. I rushed out of the
room (its</B>
<BR><B>weird how you can get so freaked out you expect something else to</B>
<BR><B>happen...like I almost expected the bedroom door to close before
I got to</B>
<BR><B>it...thank God, it didn't). I went into the bathroom and told my
boyfriend</B>
<BR><B>about it and stayed with him while he finished. It freaked me out
quite a</B>
<BR><B>bit.</B>
<BR><B>There also was a time when we were dog sitting for my boyfriend's
mom.</B>
<BR><B>Queenie was a tiny little white ragamuffin poodle dog. I was sitting
in the</B>
<BR><B>living room and she was in the room with me. My boyfriend was in
the kitchen</B>
<BR><B>preparing her food. He called her into the kitchen to eat and she
started to</B>
<BR><B>go. Abruptly, she stopped and started whining at the wall in the
corner of</B>
<BR><B>the living room. I watched her do this, all the while looking for
something</B>
<BR><B>she could be seeing...an insect or something. She then sat back
on her</B>
<BR><B>haunches with her front paws in the air in her "beg" stance which
she does</B>
<BR><B>when she wants a treat or something. Then she got back down on all
fours,</B>
<BR><B>looking utterly dejected, and slunk, and I mean SLUNK, out of the
room. All</B>
<BR><B>of this happened and I saw absolutely no cause or reason for it.
I mean ,</B>
<BR><B>what or who on earth could she have been begging too and for what?</B>
<BR><B>The last thing I will mention was the only thing we actually saw
visually.</B>
<BR><B>My boyfriend and I were sitting on the couch watching a DVD. There
is only</B>
<BR><B>one window in the living room and it is a large sliding glass door
window.</B>
<BR><B>It was dark outside. There is about a foot of wall between the glass
door</B>
<BR><B>and the regular front door. Out of my peripheral I saw something
glowing on</B>
<BR><B>that area of wall between the doors. I turned to see what it was
and it was</B>
<BR><B>a reddish orange round orb about the diameter of a coffee can. i
watched as</B>
<BR><B>it slowly descended down the wall and disappeared into the floor.
I was</B>
<BR><B>rendered speechless and I turned to tell my boyfriend about it.
He too had</B>
<BR><B>watched it as he had seen it out of his peripheral as well. He said,
"WHAT</B>
<BR><B>was THAT?"</B>
<BR><B>I had no answer for him. I do know there was no normal explanation
for it.</B>
<BR><B>It could not have been head lights (or any other light source from
outside</B>
<BR><B>for that matter)as it was on the wall next to the window and could
not have</B>
<BR><B>possibly lit that wall. There was no other light source in the living
room</B>
<BR><B>except the TV.</B>
<BR><B>We do not live in that apartment anymore...only because we wanted
a bigger</B>
<BR><B>place. We did not feel threatened for the most part (I did feel
a little</B>
<BR><B>threatened the day it said my name...the burping voice has an element
of</B>
<BR><B>gruff to it that is kind of scary)and actually had a lot of other
little</B>
<BR><B>things happen there as well like cold spots and feeling watched.</B><B></B>

<P><B>2 Stories of Hauntings</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tyleet87@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, I'm 16 years old and about 12 years ago I had my first encounter
with a ghost.&nbsp; My parents were in the midst of seperation and wanted
to talk about it this particular day.&nbsp; My dad had recently moved out
of our house and moved into this yellow house that was up for rent.&nbsp;
The man that lived there before him was an old man. The only one that lived
with him was his nurse.&nbsp; When he died his son decided to rent out
the house until he was ready to sell it. He left all his dad's furniture
in the house as well.&nbsp; My dad was the one who rented it. Anyway, my
parents were talking in the family room and since I was old enough to understand
what they were talking about they decided to send me out of the room. (My
sister was only 2 at the time) I went to go color in my dad's room, but
to get there you have to go down the hallway. At the end of the hallway
there was a picture of the man, whose house it was before, when he used
to be in the army.&nbsp; It was a picture of him kneeling in the grass
holding his gun.&nbsp; As I looked up at it, the man in the picture walked
out of th wall and began to walk towards me.&nbsp; I looked back up at
the picture and realized there wasn't anyone in it anymore, just the background.
As he came towards me I screamed and ran back into the family room to get
my parents. I started screaming that the man in the picture popped out
of the wall. Bewildered&nbsp; my mom and dad went into the hallway to check
it out. They didn't see anything but didn't doubt me for a second.</B>
<BR><B>A few years later I was living at my grandmother's house. My mom
was at work and my grandmother was in her garden. I went to a side of the
house that no one ever usually goes to. It's just really gloomy over there.
I went in search for my uncle. He lived there at the time too.&nbsp; His
bed's headboard was a mirror so I was able to see most of the room by standing
in the doorway. I saw him, through the mirror, standing at his dresser,
combing his hair.&nbsp; I walked in and turned to face him, saying his
name, and when I looked, nothing was there. I ran to the other side of
the house as fast as I could. That was the last weird and unexplainable
encounter I had, though,&nbsp; now that I'm older I wish I had more!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Footsteps Always Heard</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tearsfallen03@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My mother's side of the family has a history of being psychic, and
being able to see and talk to spirits. My father's side of the family,
has always been surrounded by spirits. With that information, here's some
of the things that have happened to us.</B>
<BR><B>When my mom was a little girl, her younger brother Bill was almost
completely deaf. One day, my grandma saw Bill sitting in his room alone,
staring at something. She went into his room, and saw a baseball sitting
in the middle of the room, spinning. Bill said it was a "little boy" spinning
the ball. My grandma dismissed it, and went about her buisness. A few nights
later, Bill was yelling about something waking him up. My grandma went
into his room, and the light switches were going off and on in his room.
The little boy was trying to wake him up with the lights, since noise wouldn't
do the trick. My grandpa was alone in the house once, and heard glass shattering
upstairs. He ran upstairs, and nothing was broken. Everything was fine.
They later found out the little boy had died in a tractor accident on the
land a few years before their house was built.</B>
<BR><B>When my sister and I were younger, we were always afraid of the
dark. We would close our closet doors so that it wouldn't scare us. One
night, I woke up to hear my sister screaming, and she pointed at the closet.
It was open, and she was screaming that she saw a lady dressed all in green.
She screamed louder as the lady came closer to her, and reached for her,
before she jumped out of bed, and ran to my mom's room. The lady visited
my sister a few more times before we moved.</B>
<BR><B>After my great-grandfather died, I was walking down the hallway
in our house (I was about 8 years old), when I was overcome with thick
cigarette smoke. No one in our house smoked, and all our windows and doors
were tightly closed. When I ran out of the hallway, the smell was gone.
The second I stepped into the hallway, it was as thick as ever. It was
like a wall. My dad said it smelled exactly like my great-grandfather's
smoke. Every now and then this will happen (no matter what house we are
in).</B>
<BR><B>Other strange things have happened in our house where the cords
on the ceiling fan will suddenly start to spin and swing extremely fast,
even when there is no draft, and the fans are off. Magnets tend to fly
off of the refrigerator without warning, things disappear, and my dogs
won't walk down the hallway towards my room. There are random knocks on
our doors and walls from time to time, and footsteps can always be heard.</B>
<BR><B>I will keep you updated as more things happen! Thanks!</B><B></B>

<P><B>China Grove / Carter's Creek</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rewdrach@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have experienced the church at China Grove.&nbsp; It was once held
slaves.&nbsp; Supposedly you can hear the chains and singing.&nbsp; We
only saw doors to the church "slid" apart, when they are the ones that
open from hinges.&nbsp; We saw writing on the wall that wasn't any language
I knew.&nbsp; We didn't stay long.&nbsp; We had a funny feeling.</B>
<BR><B>Near where I live now is a place they use to call Carter's Creek.&nbsp;
We've heard of stories about the house for over 14 years.&nbsp; The house
has 5 tombstones imprinted on the wood.&nbsp; Story is that you walk up
on the porch and the tombstones disappear.&nbsp; Supposedly, a man shot
his wife, 3 kids and self in this house and the tombstones represent the
dead family.&nbsp; A homeless man spent the night in there.&nbsp; He felt
someone lay on top of him in one of the beds.&nbsp; My ex-husband and I
use to drive around looking for hauntings.&nbsp; We heard about this house
and went a few times.&nbsp; We'd pace the house and there would be one
light you can see in the window and a shade drawn in the next.&nbsp; We'd
turn around down the road and drive slow and another shade would be drawn
and a light in another window on.&nbsp; There was no one living in this
house.&nbsp; We had another couple of people with us that saw this also.&nbsp;
We decided one more time and when we came back by 5 big black dogs ran
from the direction of the house towards our car.&nbsp; We scrambled to
get our windows up.&nbsp; They were growling at us.</B>
<BR><B>A day or two later, I told a friend of mine and her brother, their
nephew and another friend and i went during the day to check it out.&nbsp;
We were determined to see if the tombstones disappear.&nbsp; We parked
near the side of the house and proceeded to walk up to the house.&nbsp;
As soon as a friend started to put his foot on the porch a truck came barrelling
outta no where and we ran back to the car.&nbsp;&nbsp; A man with black
hair and black eyes holding a machete told us to get the F*** outta there.&nbsp;
We hauled butt.&nbsp; We, of course, came back to look for the truck but
never saw it again.</B>
<BR><B>My husband, now, never heard of the stories about the house being
haunted.&nbsp; My kids believe it is.&nbsp; Funny too that this house is
in my husband's family.&nbsp; One of his aunts and her child had an experience
there too.&nbsp; He still wants to rationalize it not being haunted.</B>

<P><B>My Son</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SIMONCOOMBS7@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Thiese incidences happened 2 yrs ago and i'm not sure if they have
stopped as i do not want to spook my son.&nbsp; Basically when he was 8
yrs old, after yrs of realising something was terribly wrong and sticking
our heads in the sand, we discovered by pure fluke with exceptional coincidence
with a radio programme ,&nbsp; [the day my son got expelled from school
], that he may have Asperger syndrome.&nbsp; After spending endless days
sitting at the bottom of the garden and asking him why he did these things
and getting no response, i told him we had to see an eye specialist.&nbsp;
He suddenly blurted out "I see people".&nbsp; I got scared and tried to
question him but did get that he saw people in his brother's room.&nbsp;
It wasn't anywhere else except later he said a girl with blonde curly hair
and a dress stood in the corner of our dining room.</B>
<BR><B>He was afraid of the man in his brother's room as sometimes he only
had half a body.&nbsp; His legs would be missing but he was tall.&nbsp;
He had a red jumper and black trousers and shoes.&nbsp; By that time he
was regularly plaYING A COMPUTOR GAME WITH THE GUY FROM back to the future[the
professor].&nbsp; He said this man looked like him but he would stare at
him really hard and then turn away as if looking at something else.&nbsp;
Looking back i remember him suddenly running down the staris in a panic
and not going anywhere inthe house on his own.&nbsp; He said out of the
corner of his eyes he sometimes saw groups of people rushing past.&nbsp;
These were white and see through.&nbsp; The man in red was solid.&nbsp;
I was terrified he had schizophrenia and the paediatrician sent him to
a psychiatrist of children but she said he was not psychotic and it was
probably due to his condition.&nbsp; Over the weeks he came out more than
ever in his life and said he had dreams he was walking through a forest
of bright colours that frightened him and that he often dreamt he was about
to die. At the time he was very withdrawn and unhappy.&nbsp; We&nbsp; were
very unhappy as a family.&nbsp; Thebn a few months later while he was home
after having his tonsils out he sat on the sofa with me whilst playing
his game boy.</B>
<BR><B>Suddenly he looked up and asked if he had 3 eyes.&nbsp; I asked
where his other eye might be.&nbsp; He pointed to the center of his brows.&nbsp;
I asked if he saw 3 eyes in the mirror and showed him.&nbsp; He said no.&nbsp;
He said he could see through it.&nbsp; That night my friend phoned who
i hadn't seen for ages.&nbsp; She asked me to join yoga and said her tutor
taught them about the spiritual eye.&nbsp; I couldn't believe it.&nbsp;
Another coincidence.&nbsp; Later he also said he could see through walls.&nbsp;
He doesn't speak of these things now. The only time i wonder is when i
see him cautiously passing a dark room and looking a bit scared.&nbsp;
He is very happy now and it seems the more happy he gets the less these
incidences occur.</B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;This happend only about 6 months ago. I am only 11. I live
in New York in a 50 year old house in the middle of nowhere and so behind
our house there is a creek. My dad and his girlfriend were getting married.
They built a gazebo in the backyard. So after the wedding when everyone
was haveing cake and stuff i walked back to the creek and saw who i thought
was Audrey my dads girlfriend (at that time wie). She was nieling on the
bank crying i could see her tears fall in the water and the ripples fade
away. Audrey wasnt wearing her wedding dress anymore,she was wearing someone
elses it was different and is was almost a yellow color and it was torn
on one sleeve. Audrey turned her head and she didnt she me but i saw the
side of her face and at that point i knew it wasnt Audrey. The woman turned
back and gazed into the water. She started rocking back and fourth and
whimpering. I was paralyzed with fear i reilized i had been holding my
breath and it was very cold out in the woods near the creek and it was
june and no birds were singing. I looked up into the trees looking for
birds. I brought my eyes back down and there was the woman staring at me.
Rachel? she asked her voice sounded choked. Thats my name and i screamed
inside how dose she know my name. I closed my eyes and said under my breath
"go away and leave me alone" I opened my eyes and she was gone. It got
warm as walked back to the house it was a 5 min walk but i felt a hand
on my shoulder and i dare not try and brush it off. When i got back to
the house. Every one was sitting at the gazebo. I didnt tell anyone wut
happend. I kept walking past the gazebo to inside i went in the bathroom
to go pee when i looked in the mirror on my cheek was red lipstick. Some
one had kissed me while i was back in the woods.</B>
<BR><B>After Math:I never new my mother. I only now her from pictures.She
killed on her wedding day. i was only 4 months old.She sliped and fell
on the mud on the bank and drowned because her dress got cought at the
shoulder on a log in the water. My moms favorite lipstick was deep red.
I dont know if that was my mother but it sure looked like her. But why
was she crying??? If you know plz e-mail me back??? Why would she being

<P><B>My First Paranormal Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: alchymi@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was growing up I lived in a small house for about ten years.
The location of the house was kind of strange since it seemed to be placed
in the grand backyard of another large house and this was downtown in the
middle of a neighborhood. Anyways, the house had three bedrooms, one bathroom,
an attic, one storage room beneath the stairs and another one that branched
off of the kitchen. There was also a little space behind the house that
was always full of vegetation and adjacent to the house was a spacious
yard. Many times when my brother and I were playing in the yard, we would
see someone peek around the corner of house where the little space was.
My brother sometimes went into that little space and he would come back
out quickly claiming someone was spying on him in there. I was so afraid
of that place that no one could force me to go in there. My bedroom was
another scary place for me as a child. I usually slept down stairs because
I always had nightmares in that room. I remember often hearing faint whispers
coming from my closet and it was always cold in there despite the summer's
heat. One night I was getting ready to go to bed, and I suddenly saw someone
going through my toy box. I asked why it was going through my stuff because
on first glance it looked like my mother only it wore blue shorts and a
red t-shirt. The apparition suddenly turned towards me and started running
back and forth in front of my bed hissing and asking me what I had done.
I was so terrified that I had fainted right on the spot. The next morning
my mother had asked me not to play around when I was supposed to be asleep
but it wasn't me who was making all that racket! There have also been a
few times when my family and I were sitting down to eat or watch television
and we would hear scratching noises or conversation like mbling coming
from the storage room beneath the stairs. It was always cold in there as
well. My brother told me once that he seen a woman that looked like my
mother go right through the couch and into that storage space. My mother
admits to hearing someone knock persistantly on the door to the other storage
room next to the kitchen. I also overheard her tell my father that she
seen someone snooping around in the space behind my house and when she
went to tell that 'someone' to leave, there was absolutely no one in that
area. The metal fence that separated our yard from the place next door
kept bending inward with no explainable cause. We moved when I was ten
because we had found a place that was better and with none of this mind
boggling phenomena. A few years later my mother and I were having a conversation
about the old place and my mother casually mentioned that a woman hanged
herself in one of the upstairs closets because she found that her husband
died of a drug overdose.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Forest City Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Freddystillh20mn@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>wow, I don't even know where to start except the fact that i used
to be a skeptic until three of my friends and i actually drove out there
last night. we followed directions exactly like the story told us but we
didn't even get to turn around before my truck started shaking, voices
were heard outside of the vehicle, and on a flat surface there is no way
my truck moved that fast by itself but i was the driver and it did. we
thought the 2 hour drive was worth it so we proceeded to leave everything
at that but we didn't make it far. after we turned from 660 back onto 330
we put my truck in neutral at the base of the hill and my truck didn't
move. all of a sudden it moved but not smoothly, my truck moved back in
"spurts" (stopping and than moving, stopping than moving) so we left in
a scared stupor we didn't make it far down the road until the weirdest
part happened. going towards forest city from 330 right before the bridge
my headlights turned off along with just the instrument panel lights and
not the temp. control lights, but the headlights and instrument panel lights
flickered on and off in a pattern it seemed like.&nbsp; the way they were
turned off wasn't even electrically possible for my truck seeing as how
the instrument panel lights, headlights, and temp. lights are all controlled
by the same dial. After we all thought we were going crazy someone from
the oncoming direction stopped to see if we needed help since my lights
were going on and off by themselves but i told them i wasn't doing that
to the lights and i had no idea why they were going on and off. after the
lights stopped acting up we found ourselves behind a small pickup, I drive
a ford ranger pickup and my lights point down on the road and have never
been reflected in someones rear window. I made sure we were all seeing
these "headlight reflections" in the rear window of the truck in front
of us. what threw me off is my truck is a 93' with square headlights and
the yellow turn signal right underneath, the headlight reflection in the
rear window of the truck in front of us were ovalish with no yellow turn
signal lights anywhere and the lights in the reflection made it appear
that i was swerving and no i wasn't on anything and the other three witnesses
in my truck can back me up that i was driving near to perfectly straight
and so was the truck in front of me. also, the reflection of the lights
was clear like the lights belonged to another car driving in reverse in
front of the other truck. if anyone knows what events took place to make
that road how it is they should e-mail me and let me know also, there were
large white birds that may or may not have been native to that road but
flew very fast about 20ft in front of my truck on 660.</B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My grand-ma came to visit me so she had to sleep in my room for a
whole week. Bcuz my grandpa committed suicide so..</B>
<BR><B>I had to sleep in the living room.. My house is haunted but at that
time it didn't really bother me.</B>
<BR><B>Well I was barely falling asleep, the ceiling fan was on low.</B>
<BR><B>I was sleeping on my back then all of a sudden i felt something
cold touch my cheek and pulled my hair out of my face. I got so scared.</B>
<BR><B>But i was just telling myself that i was probably just dreaming
this happened around 12 a.m. So i didn't let it bother me so maybe 5-10
minutes passed and i heard little footsteps walking in the hall. It sounded
like highheels but it seemed like a little girl.</B>
<BR><B>I didn't want to look in the hallway i was to scared plus it was
so pitch blck.</B>
<BR><B>i jumped up and turned on the light and sat back down to see if
i would hear the noise again. So i sat down for 5 min. nothing happened
i didn't hear anything else. So i left the light on and just laid down,
as soon as i laid down i heard it again but it was getting closer, i was
so scared i didn't kno whut to do.</B>
<BR><B>So finally i got the nerve to call my mom. I was crying to her after
when i calmed down i told her whut i heard. She told me to sleep with my
brother 2morrow night because she has to work nightshifts. (i couldn't
sleep with my grandma because she snores way to loud) So i told my mom
i would</B>
<BR><B>2nd night</B>
<BR><B>Well my mom had took off to work and she wouldn't come back to 6
a.m. so it was already time to go to bed. I was scared to death i didn't
want to go to bed because i didn't want to hear or see anything. but i
had to. well me and my bro laid down we talked a little bit 30 min later
he fell asleep and i was getting sleepy myself i didn't hear anything so
i turned to my side facing my brother and closed my eyes. I was barely
falling asleep and i heard ALOUD BANGING on the dresser. (itz outside my
bro's room cuz its real big and it wouldn't fit in the room) I was so scared.
It sounded like it was banging it with a brush. My room was right across
from my brothers room thats where my grandma was sleeping and the door
was open so i was so scared because i couldn't believe my brother didn't
hear it nor my grandma. I thought i was going crazy or something. When
the banging was going on i swore i heard a little giggle from a little
girl. I was so in shock. i couldn't move, so i moved my arm and punched
my brother in the back but once i moved my arm all of a sudden it just
stopped. My brother got scared he didn't know whut was going on cuz i just
punched him. He didn't know what to do because i was crying so he ran and
called my grandma, My grandma hugged me and told me whats wrong and i told
her everything.</B>
<BR><B>So i just went to lay down with her and i didn't hear a thing.</B>
<BR><B>Finally my mom came and my grandma told her what had happen.</B>
<BR><B>So she told me that the next night just to sleep with grandma i
told her i would but she just snores way to loud. So she said she didn't
know what to do. So i told her i would sleep in my room tonight and she
can sleep in the living room and ill leave the door open&nbsp; and if i
need her ill call her. so my mom told my grandma she was fine with it.</B>
<BR><B>3rd night</B>
<BR><B>My mom went to work, I had school tomorrow so i laid down around
10:30, and i told my brother just to sleep with me that night. so he was
like ok. so he did, well i was just falling asleep and i heard my door
opening more (my door creaks) i flung my eyes wide open ( i was facing
the wall) i didn't even want to look back, but i was so curious to see
who it is. So i turned around slowly and no one was there and i heard a
giggle. I just told myself my mind is playing tricks on me. So i turned
back around and then like 5 minutes later i heard little footsteps UNDER
MY BED!...OH MY GOD i was so scared i thought i was gonna have a major
heart attack my heart was pounding so HARD!...I heard it go to my feet
and walk right back up to my head (under the bed)...I didn't know whut
to do&nbsp;&nbsp; so i had to move my bro so he would wake up, so i whispered
to him "gary, wake up" once i whispered that to him it just stopped he
was like whut is it now, i told him that i heard it again..i just wanted
to bust into tears cuz i thought i was just turing insane. So he got up
and called my grandma. My grandma didn't know whut to do so i slept with
her once again. I didn't go to school the next morning because i couldn't
get any sleep at all. My mom was getting worried about me so she called
my sister and told her what was going on (my sister is christian and she
goes to church and stuff)..well when she told her that she told my mom
that she wanted to take me to church with her so she agreed so did i.</B>
<BR><B>Sunday morning</B>

what was happening to me and they prayed over me it felt so good.</B>
<BR><B>well church was over already i felt great and all but i was still
scared to go to sleep bcuz i was tramatized with those noises. so when
night came it was 10 p.m. already i was so scared to close my eyes but

<P><B>Bad House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gabbysbaby143@netscape.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, my name is Kait, I'm 14 and currently live in a small town
named</B>
<BR><B>Tullahoma in Tennessee.&nbsp; I lived in Mississippi all my life
then I was</B>
<BR><B>forced to come live in this place. First we lived in a two bedroom
house</B>
<BR><B>with my 33 year old sister her husband and 2 children. Yes, we were
very</B>
<BR><B>crammed. Then we finally got ourselves an apartment. After a couple
of</B>
<BR><B>months Tami, my sister, offered the upstairs of her new house. the
house</B>
<BR><B>was rented under the same landlord as our apartment. Well we agreed
to</B>
<BR><B>move in. After we had everything out of storage we decided to sell
the</B>
<BR><B>things we didn't need anymore. We had a huge garage sale. Some of
the</B>
<BR><B>people that had bought things stopped to talk about the house. It
used</B>
<BR><B>to be a beauty parlor. our living room was where they washed the
hair.</B>
<BR><B>It was a fairly big house and pretty creepy to be in alone. Well
each</B>
<BR><B>person had the same story of a woman and her husband who had gotten
a</B>
<BR><B>divorce. The husband claimed the house and died sometime earlier.
I have</B>
<BR><B>pretty bad memory but I know it was something to that extent. Anyway,
I</B>
<BR><B>would sometimes feel a cold rush of air pass me when I was alone
and</B>
<BR><B>there was no way that air could reach me. I also had a very odd
feeling</B>
<BR><B>when passing the attic door. I had been tempted to open it from
time to</B>
<BR><B>time but every time I reached for the door handle my stomach would
lurch</B>
<BR><B>and I would freak out. One night I was on the computer just browsing</B>
<BR><B>through some sites wen one of my friends from the coast wanted a
web cam</B>
<BR><B>conversation. So I agreed and we turned on the cams. Kim, my friend
had</B>
<BR><B>no idea about the house and then asked me who was behind me. I told
her</B>
<BR><B>I was alone and she said that someone was behind me. Since I have
bad</B>
<BR><B>memory I swore that I had told her when I suddenly realized that
I had</B>
<BR><B>not and turned to find a dark silhouette hovering over me. I instantly</B>
<BR><B>screamed and ran straight through it into my parents room leaving
the</B>
<BR><B>camera on. Luckily I still have that footage on my computer. After
I had</B>
<BR><B>ran through it showed a very wrinkled old man. He looked sad and</B>
<BR><B>despaired. His look broke my heart. Finally I settled down only
to be</B>
<BR><B>awakened by my sister pounding on my bed room door around 2:00 in
the</B>
<BR><B>morning. I jumped out of bed and opened the door to see my sister</B>
<BR><B>frightened. Without saying a word she immediately jerked me downstairs</B>
<BR><B>into her office to find everything destroyed. Her desk was knocked
over</B>
<BR><B>and her computer shattered, her cabinet was open with the doors</B>
<BR><B>apparently wrenched off of it. Everything was strewn all over the
floor.</B>
<BR><B>After I settled her down she told me she heard crashing and ran
out to</B>
<BR><B>see everything flying everywhere. I was surprised it didn't wake
up my</B>
<BR><B>nieces who are right across from it. Or anyone else in the house.
I</B>
<BR><B>sleep like a rock so I could understand that but it was just to
odd.</B>
<BR><B>Well after a couple more experiences with the water faucets I had
the</B>
<BR><B>one that was going to drive me out. See I hate music boxes they
scare me</B>
<BR><B>really bad. I don't know why. I guess it's just the jingles they
play</B>
<BR><B>that are so freaky. But one night my dad and I were in our living
room</B>
<BR><B>and we heard a music box playing which sent me into a panic attack.
I</B>
<BR><B>totally freaked out. My dad opened the closet to find one of our
old</B>
<BR><B>trinkets spinning around playing the song "It's A Small World After
All"</B>
<BR><B>I didn't think much of the spinning until I remember IT DOESN'T
SPIN! So</B>
<BR><B>ran out of the house and refused to go back in it until I felt someone</B>
<BR><B>touch me on the back which scared the hell out of me. So I gave
in and</B>
<BR><B>went in my bed room and put my headphones on until I fell asleep.
Around</B>
<BR><B>3:00 in the morning my dad came and woke me up and told me that
he heard</B>
<BR><B>someone tapping on the window. I told him it could have been a tree
or</B>
<BR><B>something. Then he told me not tapping knocking. Like knocking.
I said</B>
<BR><B>"probably some stupid...."&nbsp; The I stopped dead and though we're
on the</B>
<BR><B>second floor. Well needless to say next day we finally got the apartment</B>
<BR><B>we wanted and were out of there before nightfall. In Mississippi,
our</B>
<BR><B>house was haunted but I mean that house, there was something really</B>
<BR><B>wrong with it. Well, that's all I have for you for now. Maybe I
will</B>
<BR><B>tell you one of my old stories later. Thanks for reading hope you</B>
<BR><B>enjoyed it.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Funeral Home Crow</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: val1@mindspring.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>We recently relocated our auto parts store. The new location in across
the street from a well established funeral home. We have noticed that a
crow will come to the front door facing the funeral home and peck at the
door and "Squawk" loudly. We thought this was very odd, but the odd part
is that we noticed that every time the crow comes to the door, within a
few minutes the funeral home will send out their "pickup hearse". I thought
it was just a fluke the first time or two, but it has become more frequent.
I thought we had finally rid ourselves of the crow when I learned that
they had a body of a person I knew over there. I thought that person had
died that day. As it turned out the person had passed away the night before
and been picked up by the funeral home at night. So, since then the crow
has visited us upon the hearse pulling out.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Daughter and I</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: acu1970@charter.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>In 1995, I moved to a small town in Nebraska with my boyfriend. The
house was his mothers and fathers, and they had used it as a rental property.
Being elderly, they did not check on the condition of the house while they
had renters, as they lived about an hour from the property. We drove thru
town for them and found the property abandoned and virtually in a shambles.
Water damage...carpet destroyed...garbage through the entire house. It
was terrible. We agreed to move there and clean up the house and resore
it to living condition. For the first month or so....we spent around the
clock cleaning and getting rid of trash and debris. My boyfriend was around
when he wasnt working. Nothing unusual happened.</B>
<BR><B>He then got a job trucking over the road and would be gone a few
weeks at a time. It was hard being alone, so I thought that the things
I was experiencing were just things I was making up in my head. Just my
mind playing tricks on me. I now believe that wasnt the case.</B>
<BR><B>At first, I just felt like I wasnt alone in the house. That feeling
you get when the hair on your neck stands up and you get the chills down
your spin. When I would be sitting in the main room, it felt as if someone
was walking up behind me. I would turn around to find nothing was there.
But after a few minutes I would get the same feeling and constantly be
looking over my shoulder.&nbsp; I would just try to laugh it off....but
the feeling never left me. The first time I really felt my fears were valid
was very late one night as I got up to use the bathroom. As I walked out
of the bedroom and thru the kitchen, I could hear footsteps coming up behind
me. As if someone was stomping. When I got to the bathroom I slammed the
door and started to cry. I was so scared.&nbsp; I stood there for what
felt like a lifetime. When I didnt hear anything for a while, I opened
the door and ran back to the bedroom, jumped into bed and closed my eyes
tight. All night I heard a scratching type noise coming from only one wall
in the bedroom. It was the wall where the basement steps were.&nbsp; It
sounds crazy, but from that night on, I locked the door that led to the
basement. Because I felt a terrible uneasiness walking past it. I would
share my story with Eric when he would come home. But he just laughed at
me and said that it was my imagination. Little did he know....</B>
<BR><B>A few weeks later, he was home for the weekend and we were getting
ready to go out. I was in the bathroom getting ready and he was in the
bedroom.&nbsp; He walked thru the kitchen and all of a sudden the footsteps
came up behind him. The same loud stomping sounds I had experienced. Eric
froze and I swear the color drained from his face. He looked at me, his
eyes wide. I asked him if he believed me now and he said he did. He had
the same uneasy feeling when he walked past the basement door. One he didnt
feel prior to the stomping. He didnt laugh at my stories anymore.</B>
<BR><B>When I would walk thru the house, I would feel as if something was
following me. This feeling would be day or night. Except at night, the
house would turn ice cold. And at night was when most of the things happened.
One night as I was walking thru the dining room, I turned around and thought
I saw the figure of a man.&nbsp; He was following the path I was taking.
I closed my eyes and asked him to please stop following me. When I opened
my eyes, I still had the feeling something was there, but I couldnt see
anything. Was it my imagination?</B>
<BR><B>We lived in the house from September of 1995 till March of 1996.
I found out I was pregnant in February of 1996 and we began looking for
a house to buy. I told Eric I didnt want to live in that house because
it made me feel very stressed, and I was already a high risk pregnancy.
We moved in March and I remember saying to Eric that I was glad that our
"spirit" couldnt go with us. I also wish I could say this is where my story
ends....but I cant.</B>
<BR><B>Everything was pretty quiet after the move.&nbsp; I didnt have the
uneasy feeling in the new house and I felt very comfortable. The baby room
was at the back of the house. The only downside to that room was that the
door to the crawlspace was in there and we would have to lift the carpet
to get to it. The water heater and fuse box were down there. So I had no
real reason to be down there.&nbsp; Emma was born in October of that year.
She was a wonderful baby!&nbsp; She would sleep thru the night and was
never much trouble. She started talking at about 8 months old. At about
9 months is when she would start waking in the night screaming. I would
run in and she would be standing in her crib, just sobbing.&nbsp; This
would happen at about the same time every night. So I figured it was just
her schedule changing and it was her way of getting my attention. At about
a year old is when she would start pointing at the floor in her room saying
"man mama, man". And at about 18 months was the first time I realized something
wasnt right. I was changing Emma diaper in my room and we were giggling
and playing when Emma stopped cold and started to stare at the bedroom
entry way. I asked Emma what she was looking at and she said "Man". I felt
the hairs on my neck stand up. I asked Emma what the man was doing and
she replied "Looking at you". I told Emma to tell the man to go away. She
said "Go man!". After I was done with her diaper, she got down off the
bed and walked over to the couch by the large window in the living room.
She was staring out the window "at the man" she said.&nbsp; "He's looking
at me".</B>
<BR><B>Emma would still wake from time to time at night, screaming out
for me. When she was about 3 is when she told me the man would crawl out
of her floor and stare at her.&nbsp; I asked her how long he had been doing
this. She said "for a long time". I believe that it had been happening
since she was an infant, and that it was the man that would make her scream
for me. I dont know if we brought him with us from the old house. I dont
know if things like that are possible. But the fact that my daughter saw
a man and that I feel that what I saw in the first house was a man, seems
to be too much of a common thread.</B>
<BR><B>She saw the man from time to time. He didnt seem to scare her unless
it was in the night when he would come thru her floor. I had my second
daughter in August of 1999. She didnt have the same experiences as Emma.
In 2001, my marriage ended and I moved back to my home town. When I was
leaving the house, I said out loud that the spirit was not welcome to come
with us and laughed when Emma said the same thing. I knew I wasnt alone
in my experiences. Nothing happened to us after that. Although my ex husband
said that the pipes in the house burst shortly after I left and that he
came home to find the house in shambles. He was still driving truck over
the road when we seperated and the house would stand empty when he was
gone.&nbsp; I dont know if someone maybe broke in...or if our "spirit"
just didnt like being alone. Eric sold the house about a year later.</B>
<BR><B>We dont talk about the man at all.&nbsp; But, it made me believe.
And made me have respect for things unknown.</B>

<P><B>A Ghost in the Hollow</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: furryfan2@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ok' this happened to me when I was 6 or 7.Me and siblings were swinging
on a rope that my brother put in a tree for us.It turned dark on us and
every one else was going but, I was still wanting to play so I swung around
for a few more minutes and then got done.As I was getting to cross the
little creek near by I noticed over my shoulder someone behind me as I
looked more with the chills and scared stiff I noticed he didn't have a
head.Now mind you this was during the summer and it was a warm night so
the chill had to be him.With a terrified voice I called to my half-brother
to come get me and reluctently he did.Thank GOD he did cause if I stood
there any longer i'd done one of two things, wet all over myself while
crying or fainted.Now rumor/stories have it that it's the ghost of a woman's
husband.Now not for sure but, she cut his head off for some evil reason
or so and disposed of it.Along with this the house the both of them lived
in is haunted you can see glowing orbs exactly where she hung her son in
the barn and you can hear an organ playing in the main part of the house.Needless
to say I don't stay in the hollow with my grandparents at all.Plus i've
been told the whole hollow from the top of the ridge to the mouth of it
is all haunted by many ghosts.CREEPY.Thanks for reading.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Man with the Derby</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ljunglequeen@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was 13 We were living in New York my brother and I shared
a bedroom and one night I went to bed (EVERYONE WAS ASLEEP MOM DAD BROTHER)
and I was asleep for a while...when suddenly in my dreams I heard soft
circus music. I awoke and wondered if there was a circus outside to me
( it had gotten so loud.) I looked outside and I saw a man with something
on his shoulder it looked like a little person sitting. As He got closer
to my window ( I was peeking out the curtain) He stopped and looked directly
at me and his little shoulder person did too He was wearing a black derby
and a long black trench coat. I turned around and tired to wake my brother.
He looked wide awake and told me there was someone at the door for me.
I went and looked at the peep hole and a small eye was looking at me then
it went back to it's position it was the little guy and then the derby
hat man was looking in the peep hole they wanted to come in the little
guy was working at the screws on the hinges.... I was pertrified I ran
back to bed went under the covers and prayed hard I was still praying when
I saw daylight pass by my window and started hearing my family getting
up I asked my brother and he said he heard circus music in his dream but
remembered he had a dream where he was standing in our room and n ne was
there.I walked to the door and&nbsp; I saw screws loose on the floor sprawled
out. Noone knows this story until now</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghostly Phone Calls</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: moondancers72@webtv.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My story begins in 1976.&nbsp; I was in college .&nbsp; A friend
and I were</B>
<BR><B>looking for an apartment to share in a nicer part of the city.&nbsp;
We were</B>
<BR><B>lucky to get one on a tree lined avenue.&nbsp; The neighborhood
was mixed</B>
<BR><B>with well-kept victorian homes that had been made into apartments
and</B>
<BR><B>post WWII apartment buildings.</B>
<BR><B>The owner of our "modern" building told us this had been done to
relieve</B>
<BR><B>a housing shortage during and after the war.&nbsp; He also said
that some of</B>
<BR><B>the older members of the neighborhood still did not like younger&nbsp;
people</B>
<BR><B>moving in so we were not to have wild parties, etc.- hey it was
the</B>
<BR><B>70's.&nbsp; Actually, ,my room mate and I were too busy going to
school and</B>
<BR><B>working, and besides our boyfriends lived in the "party" neighborhoods.</B>
<BR><B>The first thing we noticed was that none and I mean none of the
people</B>
<BR><B>in our building were friendly toward us.&nbsp; Usually, they wouldn't
make</B>
<BR><B>any eye contact&nbsp; or only mumble a hello and walk away quickly.&nbsp;
We</B>
<BR><B>thought this was very weird.&nbsp; We had the basement apartment
next to the</B>
<BR><B>laundry room and still we just didn't seem to exist.&nbsp; The next
thing</B>
<BR><B>that we noticed was that there was always little to no noise.&nbsp;
We</B>
<BR><B>wouldn't hear those usual noises of people walking up the stairs
or</B>
<BR><B>opening and closing doors and windows.&nbsp; Our schedules were
so different</B>
<BR><B>that my room mate and I would rarely be at the apartment at the
same</B>
<BR><B>time but we would talk about&nbsp; how strange the vibes were in
the</B>
<BR><B>building.&nbsp; Then after we'd been there about two months the
phone calls</B>
<BR><B>started.&nbsp; They would come usually late at night when I was
alone&nbsp; - with</B>
<BR><B>my boyfriend working late and my roomate gone.&nbsp; They would
always be the</B>
<BR><B>same... the phone would ring&nbsp; - I would answer - no one would
be on the</B>
<BR><B>line but there would be soft music playing in the background.&nbsp;
I would</B>
<BR><B>hang up and that would be the end of it until the next time.&nbsp;
After</B>
<BR><B>several of these calls over the next couple of months, I noticed</B>
<BR><B>something.&nbsp; The music in the background was always the same
soft jazz no</B>
<BR><B>vocals type tune -&nbsp; I mean the same one everytime.&nbsp; I
finally told my</B>
<BR><B>boyfriend and it really scared him.&nbsp; He thought someone was
after me and</B>
<BR><B>so he started coming over after work and there was never a call
as long</B>
<BR><B>as he or my room mate was there with me.&nbsp; I don't know why,
but it was</B>
<BR><B>several more months before my room mate and I actually talked about
my</B>
<BR><B>phone calls.&nbsp; Then the kicker came...she had been getting the
same calls</B>
<BR><B>too but only when she was in our apartment alone.&nbsp; This scared
the holy</B>
<BR><B>sh** out of&nbsp; us!&nbsp; Then my boyfriend said something about
an apartment</B>
<BR><B>down the street that had a big picture window with a huge victorian
lamp</B>
<BR><B>sitting in it.&nbsp; The lamp was always on&nbsp; 24/7 and we never
saw anyone go</B>
<BR><B>in or out of the place.&nbsp; My boyfriend said that it was on no
matter what</B>
<BR><B>time he drove by at&nbsp; 2:30 AM or whatever to get to my place.&nbsp;
Well, we</B>
<BR><B>decided that when summer came we were going to find a new place
to live.</B>
<BR><B>When the day came that we were moving, a neighbor from the house
next</B>
<BR><B>door came out and started making conversation. weird again!&nbsp;
The lady</B>
<BR><B>said that she was sorry to see us go and that we had stayed there
the</B>
<BR><B>longest -&nbsp; meaning our apartment.&nbsp; She said that many
people had gotten</B>
<BR><B>the phone calls - remember the numbers would have been changed -
and</B>
<BR><B>that some felt it had to do with the apartment down the street with
the</B>
<BR><B>big victorian lamp.&nbsp; She had heard that an old lady had lived
in the</B>
<BR><B>apartment with the lamp and her son had moved to the apartment we
had</B>
<BR><B>lived in.&nbsp; He had been killed in a car accident and the mother
had died</B>
<BR><B>a few years later.&nbsp; The relatives had never cleaned out the
old lady's</B>
<BR><B>apartment because they owned the building and just hadn't done it.</B>
<BR><B>Needless to say,we were all freaked out.&nbsp; It was about five
or six years</B>
<BR><B>before I could drive down that avenue again and my boyfriend/now</B>
<BR><B>significant other would NEVER drive past my old apartment for as
long as</B>
<BR><B>we lived in that city!!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Ghost Encounter</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: m_indy@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I encountered what I believe was a ghost a few years ago.&nbsp; I
was about 18</B>
<BR><B>years old and living alone while going to college.&nbsp; One night,
I was awoken</B>
<BR><B>by a woman's voice calling my name. She called to me at least twice
that I</B>
<BR><B>remember in a very upbeat and friendly manner, just as someone would
call</B>
<BR><B>their child or friend.&nbsp; I knew there could not have been anyone
in the</B>
<BR><B>apartment with me, as I lived alone and had no family living in
the area.</B>
<BR><B>I had just purchased a Queen sized bed a few weeks before, and I
had been</B>
<BR><B>sleeping right at one edge of it facing the doorway of the bedroom.&nbsp;
After I</B>
<BR><B>heard the woman caling to me, I then felt someone climb up on to
the bed</B>
<BR><B>behind me, crawl across to where I was lying, and lay down behind
me (along</B>
<BR><B>side me) and drape their arm over me.&nbsp; It seemed to be a conforting
guesture</B>
<BR><B>on their part.&nbsp; I was quite scared, as this was the first time
I had ever</B>
<BR><B>experienced something like this, so I closed my eyes and lay still,
as I was</B>
<BR><B>not sure what to do.&nbsp; I fell asleep like this and in the morning
the ghost</B>
<BR><B>was gone.</B>
<BR><B>The next day I spoke to a friend's Mother, who was quite experienced
with</B>
<BR><B>seeing and dealing with ghosts.&nbsp; She told me that it seemed
to be a friendly</B>
<BR><B>ghost, perhaps a past relative who was simply letting me know they
were</B>
<BR><B>watching me.&nbsp; I was still worried about the ghost coming back,
even though</B>
<BR><B>it seemed friendly, so I was told to simply tell the ghost 'Thank
You' and</B>
<BR><B>please not to come back.&nbsp; After I did this the next night,
I have never had</B>
<BR><B>a repeat experience.</B>

<BR><B>They Look so Real</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: PProjectPat102@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Wow, I did not know so many people seen ghost like this.Well I have
only read a few of these storys, because I'm doing a research paper in
english, but anyway I'll tell you some of my story's,&nbsp; first of all
I was born with a veil over my head, so spooks love to miss with me, I
am only 18 but the sightings are getting worst, My story's are nothing
but the honest true,&nbsp;&nbsp; I was raised in the burned islands of
North Carolina, but there was something special about the land I lived
on. a long time ago it was were they beried Indians, and we built our house
right on top of it. but died Indians are not the only thing that lives
there, I've meet demons. I know it sounds strange. but he loved to pick
on my family along time ago.&nbsp; I was five years old when I first saw
him, I was slepping on a bed across from my parents, when I woke up one
nite and saw a black</B>
<BR><B>figure sitting on the end of my parents bed, seeing nothin but red
eyes and very white dog looking teeth, he ws looking at me and grining.
It made my crawl all over, but I thought it was my imagineation, until
the next nite when I took my fist bath, alone. I had got done and looked
in the mirrior, and my reflection started smileing at me,my skin turned
a dark brown, so needless to say I booked it out of there very quickly.</B>
<BR><B>That nite it got real bad for me and my family. about 11:00 I started
to feel safer, so we decided to go to sleep. right when we said good nite,
little childern started beating the side of the house chanting something
when on for hour but finally stop and we went to bed the next day the underground
wires had been pulled out of the ground, at least 3 ft or so high. and
to give you a little taste of how strong they are it took five fully grown
men to even try to push the wires back into the ground, and after that
alot of strange stuff happen, but the demon was no where to be found, I
think the childern were helping us.but hes been coming back off and on.
like he'll come and whisper in my ear "I'm going to kill you", and when
I ask him who he is he simple replys "the devil" really scare me, sometimes
it scares me so bad I just stat crying and screming</B>
<BR><B>so if you ever see or meet a demon, find pastor as soon as you can
because that is the only way your going to get it to go away, Jesus is
the best thing to have one your side, don't get me wrong I have ghost story's
too, but its late and I have to go to school tomorrow, so if it's alright
I'll tell you some of my ghost story's tomorrow, and if you won't to ask
me questions then ask me, I know I'm yong but I know alot about ghost,
my veil is so strong that I can see animal</B>
<BR><B>ghost, and even ghost in public places, in the middle of the day,
they are not the ones you see in your homes, they look so real, might be
hard to believe, but there ture</B><B></B>

OF UR FAMILY BUT SINCE I FOUND YOUR SIGHT, I WILL SHARE THIS WITH YOU AND
TAKE IT FOR WHAT ITS WORTH.</B>
<BR><B>IT REALLY STARTED AROUND FEBRUARY OR MARCH OF 2000. IT WAS AFTER
MY FATHER HAD DIED OF CANCER. MY WIFE AND CHILDREN AND ME HAD MOVED OUT
OF THE HOUSE THAT I HAD GROWN UP IN. IT WAS A REGULAR NIGHT IN SAN FRANCISCO
AND ME AND MY WIFE HAD EATEN DINNER AND RETIRED TO OUR ROOM TO WATCH T.V.
I HAD GONE INTO THE KITCHEN TO GET A DRINK FROM THE FAUCET AND THE RESTROOM
IS TO THE RIGHT. I SEEN WHO I THOUGHT WAS MY WIFE WALK INTO THE BATHROOM
AND SHUT THE DOOR. I PAID NO MIND AT THE TIME BUT AFTER A WHILE I REALIZED
THE BATHROOM LIGHT WAS OFF AND I HEARD NOTHING FROM THE OTHER SIDE. I CALLED
TO MY WIFE AND HEARD HER ANSWER ME FROM THE ROOM. I FELT A COLD CHILL COME
OVER ME, I HAD SEEN SOMETHING AND SEEN THE DOOR SHUT. I OPENED THE DOOR
AND NOTHING WAS THERE. I WALKED BACK INTO THE BEDROOM AND TOLD MY WIFE
ABOUT WHAT I HAD JUST SEEN. WITHIN A MONTH, WE WERE MOVING TO LAS VEGAS
TO GET AWAY FROM THE BAY AREA AND THE MEMORIES OF THE LOSS OF MY FATHER.</B>
<BR><B>WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF MOVING THERE, WE STARTED HAVING LITTLE THINGS
HAPPEN AROUND THE APARTMENT, I DONT KNOW THE LAWS OF THE AFTERLIFE BUT
IT FELT LIKE THERE WAS SOMETHING FALLOWING US FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LAS
VEGAS. MY WIFE AND I WERE ACROSS THE STREET BUYING SOMETHING AT THE STORE
WHILE OUR SONS WERE IN THE HOUSE WITH THEIR BEST FRIEND. WHEN WE WALKED
IN THE DOOR, OUR CHILDREN WERE ON THE PATIO SCARED OUT OF THEIR WITS AND
AS SOON AS WE WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR, THEY WERE RUNNING OUT OF IT.</B>
<BR><B>I CAUGHT MY OLDER SON AND ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND HE SAID
THAT SOMETHING HAD CAME OUT OF THE CEILING OF THEIR ROOM AND HAD "FLOATED"
INTO THEIR BATHROOM AND SHUT THE DOOR. THEIR FRIEND HAD SEEN IT ALSO AND
WAS VERY AFFRAID TO COME BACK INTO THE HOUSE.</B>
<BR><B>MONTHS LATER WE HAD ANOTHER EXPERIENCE HAPPEN WHEN ME AND MY WIFE
WERE WATCHING T.V. AND IN THE CORNER OF MY EYE, I WATCHED ONE OF THE KITCHEN
CABINET DOORS SWING OPEN. I HAD NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT
BEFORE, IT WASN'T A SCARY THING BUT VERY SUREAL.</B>
<BR><B>LATER THAT NIGHT AS WE WERE SITTING ON THE COUCH, ONE OF THE CORNERS
OF OUR DINING ROOM HAD GOTTEN REALLY DARK, NOT LIKE A LIGHT HAD BEEN TURNED
OFF BUT REALLY DARK LIKE LOOKING INTO A ENDLESS HOLE WHERE THERE WASNT
ANYTHING LEFT. I FELT A FELLING OF DREAD COME OVER ME AND FELT LIKE SOMEONE
WAS LOOKING AT ME AND THEY WERENT HAPPY.</B>
<BR><B>MY WIFE FELT THIS ALSO AND WE BOTH GOT UP AND STARTED TOWARDS THE
KIDS ROOM. OUR DOG WAS ALREADY IN THERE AND SHE WAS SITTING UP WITH A LOOK
LIKE SHE COULD SEE SOMETHING. WE TURNED ON ALL THE LIGHTS BUT THEY DIDNT
SEEM TO BRIGHTEN THE ROOM VERY MUCH AT ALL. WE STARTED YELLING FOR IT TO
LEAVE OUR HOUSE AND NEVER COME BACK. THE DREAD DIDNT LEAVE MY BODY FOR
QUITE A LONG TIME.</B>
<BR><B>THERE WAS A TIME WHERE MY OLDER SON SEEN A FACE LOOKING AT HIM FROM
THE CEILING OF HIS ROOM AND RAN INTO OURS CRYNG.</B>
<BR><B>WELL, ONE OF THE LAST EXPERIENCES THAT I PERSONALLY HAVE TO TELL
BEFORE I GO IS THIS, I WAS LAYING IN BED BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP AND WAS
WATCHING THE NEWS AND THIS DARK SHADOW ROLLED UP THE WALL AND ACROSS THE
CEILING AND THROUGH THE WALL AND WAS GONE.</B>
<BR><B>LATER THAT NIGHT, I WOKE UP TO A COLD CHILL AND REALIZED THAT I
COULN'T MOVE AT ALL AND WAS WIDE AWAKE. I FELT SOMEONE BEHIND ME, LOOKING
AT ME. I TRIED TO REACH FOR MY WIFE NEXT TO ME BUT COULDN'T, I TRIED TO
SCREAM BUT NOTHING WOULD COME OUT. I WAS PARALIZED COMPLETELY AND THERE
WAS NOTHING I COULD DO. I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW LONG THAT IT LASTED BUT
IT FELT LIKE FOREVER. I GUESS I FELL BACK TO SLEEP AFTER A WHILE BUT IT
WAS FRESH IN MY MIND WHEN I WOKE UP. I DO BELIEVE IN THE AFTER-LIFE AND
THINK THAT MOST GHOSTS ARE THERE IN A INCOMPACITATED STATE BUT I'LL TELLYOU
WHAT, I WILL NEVER FORGET THIS AS LONG AS I LIVE NOR WILL MY CHILDREN.</B>
<BR><B>THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO THIS AND HOPE THAT MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE
WILL COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR EXPERIENCES AS I JUST HAVE.</B>
