lived with my mom in her trailer. mined and my daughters room was on the
opposite end of the trailer from my moms room.any way we all got ready for bed
and I took two sleeping pills and went to bed. The next day my daughter asked
had I saw the big snake crawl across the bed we slept in. I told her no. about
2 or 3 days later me, mom, and my brother was talking andi told him an mom
about what my daughter nita saw and i asked mom could a snake crawl in the
house cause we lived next to the woods.mom said no..well my brother who is 25
now[at the time 22 years old] said did it come out of the closet i told Jason
that nita said it did.thats when he spoke up and said sissy you don't feel
anything watching you from the closet i said no sorry. Well about a month later
my mom went out of town for a week, she asked me would i be all right bye my
self i assured her i would be ok..well i had to work 12 hours that day i didn't
get off work until </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="23"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">11:00 PM</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> that

home and asked was i OK. when i asked her why did she come home during the
night she said she didnt.i asked her why are you back early and she said that
she had a bad feeling so she come home. i told mom about the old woman and mom

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My name is Mikaela and i live in sweeden my story is aboute
one of my many, though loved more than most can belive, cats.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">His name was Musse and he was like a brother to me for he
played with me like kittens do with each other untill he was two years old, he
got hit by a car and we found him dead by the road.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">i was so sad and angry that i screamed for sevral minutes
and punched a pillow and tore it apart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">this was aboute five years ago, im 14 now, and i still cry
over his death sometimes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">one week after his death i still wasnt used to the thought
of it all and when i woke up i saw him in my bed, as i was used to from before
he died, and i put my hand on him and closed my eyes again untill i remembered
it all and i quickly put my hand close to my body and opened my eyes but he was
not there anymore.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">all that was there was hair of a cat and a slight mark of a
curled cat and my hand was full of hair too so i touched where i had seen him
and it was still warm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">i am not afraid of him, he and the other seven sprirts of my
cats guard me and do not wish to harm me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">one more thing, i didnt have any other cat then.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ten years have passed since my first encounter. It all
started back when I was eleven years old in the basemant of my parents new
house. Ever since the day we moved into that house my family has encountered
strange events. It started out as only seeing shadows and hearing odd creaks up
the hallway and basement steps at night. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Being only a child and experiencing this phenomenon,then
relating my expereinces back to my parents seemed useless. They would disregard
may claims as trickery of the eye or paranoia,but I knew it was someting much
bigger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My sister and I,being very bored,decided to play hide and
seek in the dark. The darkest place in that house was,of course,the basement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">And so we began,I turned out all the lights, being late at
night as it was the basement became an even darker.unforbiding place. We were
having fun at first stalking each other in the pitch blackness.Soon this
childish game tuned into an event none of us would ever forget.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was following the sound of my sisteres footsteps,closing
in for the "tag" when out of nowhere came a beam of light. It
streached from floor to ceiling,aboutseven inches wide and seven feet tall.
Over come with shock and fear I started to scream hystarically and call for
help,all the while being forced backward by this "entity".<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I suddenly became very cold as the beam got closer. I knelt
down awaiting the worst,when a hand grabbed my leg and pulled me under the pool
table. Screaming bloody murder,the lights all of a sudden came on<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and there stood my sister,on the opposite side
of the room. I will never forget the look on her face,or the way her whole body
shook.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We rarely discussed the events of that night for three
years. I ended up home alone.I watched TV untill I could hardly keep my eyes
open.Beginning to doze I started hearing the sounds of two small girls giggling.
The sounds were coming from the main closet. Terrified, I sat up,arm and neck
hair on end I gave these "girls" my full attention.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Shaking from head to toe I approached the closet doors.
Quickly I ripped open the closet doors only to find a bunch of old coats and
Christmas decorations.I have nothing to prove any of the events I have
discribed, only a new found interest in spirits and the unknown.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Hi everyone. I'm sorry to say, that i don't really have a
"ghost" story for you all. But i think it's pretty close to one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let me start off by saying, that my
grandparents ( my dads) mom and dad are deceased. They died on the same day.
Ok... here goes.... On the night before my grandparents died, i had a very
"real dream"... nightmare if you will. I saw both my grandparents in
there car..... driving down a highway.. maybe going to work? Im not sure. I saw
a transport truck coming along the road towards them on the other side. Not
going into gross details but i saw the whole accident!! really graphically!...
I was reallly close to my grandparents...almost like a second parent.Any
ways... i woke up with a start!. Started crying got up and came down to the
kitchen , where my mom and dad were sitting at the kitchen table... mom was on
the phone ( i later found out with the police) and my dad was crying, he came
over to me ( i was 10 by the way) am now 32.... he says to me..... hunny.. your
a big girl now... and your old enough to hear the truth..... he wrapped his
arms around me and thats when i wrapped my arms around him and said........ its
ok dad.... i know..... i then hugged him to try to comfort him instead of him
comforting me..... he looked at me with shock and said ..... what do you
know?... so i then explained to him about my dream.... and my dad went
white......... he told me that, that was gran and papa telling me goodbye...
letting me " hear" it from them instead of the police or mom,
dad...the funny part of it all.. well not " funny" but eery part is.
my aunt who was 16 at the time. wanted to go that time with them... she would
go help them out from time to time. gran had said no. and there was a little
argument about her going..did my grandparents fore see something?.. who really
knows? ... another story or ya ... my dad use to smoke. i remember him smoking
when i was about 4......any ways.. he said to me one day.. years later that the
reason he quit smoking... his dad came to him in a dream..sat down with him...
and said to him. son... i love you very much... thats why im telling you to
stop smoking NOW. as in rite now!!...My dad isnt really the "ghost"
or paranormal type person... so when this dream came to him.. it scared
him...... papa told him that if he didn't quit rite this day...... he would
die...My dad is very healthy today.... except for a little skin cancer on his
ear!. Which was caught early and treated..... So those are my two stories..
Hope i didn't bore you all TO badly lol........happy ghost reading!!! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Hi! I am a 33 year old mother of three boys.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband, boys and I live up in the
mountains of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Montana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I drive a </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">97 Buick
  Park Avenue</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> Ultra, its sweet; electric
everything with heated leather seats (Oh Yeah!) Anyways back to the story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This has happened off and on for the last 2
almost 3 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will be driving or
parked somewhere (Its happened in both situations numerous times) and I will be
rocking out to some hard rock or metal band and my volume will start turning up
or down (I think it depends on what&#8217;s playing) all by itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have 2 ways of controlling my volume, one
is the actual dial on the stereo and one is a button on my steering wheel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This has happened too many times for my
finger or hand to have accidentally slipped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This last new years holiday season I was taking my nephew to town and
the volume turned all the way down all by itself, so I tried turning it up and
it kept going down, so I turned off the stereo and turned it back on, all was
well for like 5 minutes or so then it just cranked the volume sky high.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I freaked and turned off the stereo and asked
my nephew (17) if he saw that the stereo just turned itself up and he said yeah
I saw it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I decide to go see my
friend while we are in town so she can see it too and while I am in her house
my nephew sat in the car and waited, well she was feeling crappy and didn&#8217;t
come out to the car (probably thinks I'm a loon) so I left the house and went
back out to the car only to find my nephew literally fighting to turn down the
volume, the knob was literally turning against his hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would turn it down and it would
immediately go up, it was weird especially when you can sit there and watch it
turn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went home and never said
anything about it, but as I said before it has happened many times in the last
2 - 3 years and I am glad that someone else got to see it too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also the other night I was driving my
husband&#8217;s car (YAY!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s even sweeter
then mine) and I was heading back up the mountain when I got this feeling like
someone was in the car with me, like in the backseat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now I have had this feeling before and I
normally just ignore it (cept the few times I had to pull over and check the
backseat) anyways the feeling was intense and I couldn&#8217;t look in the rearview
mirror, I say couldn&#8217;t because I literally could not do it, I knew that if I
did I would see something bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
feeling got stronger and worse the closer I got to home and by the time I was
in my driveway I was almost in tears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
could hear stuff rustling around in the back seat and could see like shadows
back there too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I parked the car and
went into the house and since we had company I didn&#8217;t say anything but when our
guest left my husband asked me what happened, I told him and he not only
believed me but he told me that lately outside at night he feels like there is
something chasing him or trying to get him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He has never felt like that before and actually laughs at me because I
do not like being outside in the dark because I almost always feel like
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now he&#8217;s feeling it too, and
actually refuses to go outside at night unless I go with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was weird.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Okay that&#8217;s it for now<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I just arrived home yesterday and i have told my story to a
hand full of people,and one thing comes out of their mouths"thats
creepy".<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I went to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Las
  Vegas</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> for my Nephues batchelor party,We stayed at the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>MGM Grand,we were on our second night and it
was around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="2"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">2am</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> when i
went to our room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The beds were occupied by My Nephue and his friend's(too
much LV)I decided to go back to the casino and play some more due to all the
snoring and farting and lack of bed space in the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I found my self playing in a very deserted MGM casino and
began to play a dollar machine,after an hour or so an asian woman in well worn
but not dirty sweats came and sat next to me, she never gambled,but she fanned
me with 3 20's and a 10 dollar bill,sitting so close that her feet were on my
stool rungs,needless to say i felt uncomfortable but continued to play.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">A waitress came and i ordered a drink(trying to alert her
that something was fishy) she gave me a smile and left(I think she thought i
was crazy)there was an obvious difference in age between the two of us)she
returned and i tiped her for my drink,i tried again to summon help darting my
eyes toward the stangers direction,still no reaction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I turned to the stranger and asked if i was playing her
machine and she replied in broken english "noo, noo u play good now".<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I continued to play and i hit a win at $530 dollars ,she
then said"u pay me 30 O.K." I was more than happy to due to my
uncomfort with the situation.I got up and paid her $30 dollars-Just then an
employee yelled to me to come over quickly,i take a step and look back---No
Stranger!!!!and it was a long row of slots,i walk over to the employee (he was
standing in an elevated cashieres booth he told me to go and play the fifth
slot on the left and play max bet 4 times it will pay big) so i put $100 in and
began to play,I was down to 65 credits when i hit 4 majestic lions -paying me
5,775,00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I turned with surprise bells chimeing lights flashing,and
James the employee who gave me this great advice was gone,Thomas the payout
cleark came over and congratulated me i asked where James was so i could show
him my grattude and thomas told me there was no one by the name of James
working as a cashier then the waitress came over to congratulate me i tiped her
a $100 and began to tell her what had happened and to explane my strange
behavior from earlier,and she said i was wondering what you were doing but
"hon i didnt see anyone next to you are you sure your O.K". That is
the end nothing else happed i went to the room ,woke my Nephue and shared my

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Hi my name is Lisa. I've visited<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Booth</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Memorial

I decided to take a photo from my car of the house. and when I put it on the
computer and zoomed in I saw a face in the upper right side window. None of the
other windows had anything in them. I went back to see with my eye if I could
see anything that would resemble a face and there was nothing different about
that window to the other ones. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One other en-counter I had was at </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Union</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Cemetery</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Monroe</span></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ct.</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> Me and a
couple friends decided to take pictures one night. Well everyone was afraid to
take the pictures so I volunteered. A couple of photos had a picture of a white
figure that looked like a lady in a white dress and some of the other pictures
came up with a weird fog. We figured we got enough pictures for the night and
while walking away something pushed me straight to the ground on my knees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The last place I went was in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Monroe</span></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">CT</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> to see

While we were there we got pictures of red orbs by her grave stone and some
type of fog coming from the base of it. As we were taking our last picture the
camera shut off and refused to turn back on. So we decided to leave. Soon as we
got back to the car the camera suddenly turned back on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">By: anonymous<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I lived for 38 years in a 4-story
house in Ventnor in the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">St. Leonard</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">'s section
of the city.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We were a family of husband, wife
and four sons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the six bedrooms
with a crib was used as each new baby was born, and the older child put in
another room with a single bed, or with an older brother.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We often heard footsteps as we
slept in our own bedroom, of someone going to<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the 'baby's'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>room and assumed it
was one of the older boys.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When my
mother visited on Sat. morning to let me sleep late, she came up once to my
room, and said, "I'll get the baby, you can sleep."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told her I had been asleep, she just woke
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said, "well, I heard your
foot steps...."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and then I told her
about the supposed ghost we apparently had.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I checked with an older librarian
to see if any one had died in that room, after reading a book that said ghosts
only appeared because they wanted something denied them in life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my not-quite-surprise, she replied that
her mother used to tell her, as they walked past my house, that a little girl
died in a bedroom after going swimming at the 'wrong' time of the month.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I asked if she would happen to
know which room, and she replied 'the one with the tree hanging in front of
it.' <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Lo and behold, THAT was the baby's
room.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I thought about it,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guessed that the little girl wanted her
room back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, to my husband's
laughter,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I moved the then-baby into our
guest room, leaving the old room unused except for a desk and bookcase.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">With my hand on a bible,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I promise you we NEVER heard the footsteps
after that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">End of story<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>but not quite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">After 38 years and my husband's
death, I sold the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The new people
were a young couple with two children.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of course I didn't tell the "ghost"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>story at my realtor's insistence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But a year or so after the sale,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I received a phone call from the new owner's
wife.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">"My husband is embarrassed
and furious that I am telling you this, but I think we have a ghost in the
house,"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>she said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"My two children have both seen her and
I feel silly telling you this, I swear I'm not making it up"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>she confided.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I reassured her and told her our
story of many years before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
then-baby was now 27 years old, and none of us ever forgot it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My only advice was to give the young girl
back her room, and not let either of her children use it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

and every word of the above dialogue is written exactly as it happened<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ok I submitted two new places in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Salem</span></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Oregon</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> where
there is ghost activity. I have captured activity with my Minolta SRT 101
Camera and also with a EMF reader. I've been doing research for over 3 years
now on ghost activity and have concluded that the Cemetary on D Street (there
is only one) has activity and between 23rd and </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">24th
  street</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> on </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">State St</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> also has
activity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Cemetary I have snapped
photos of people hanging from tree's and on D Street between 23rd and 24th I've
seen a shadow manifest and run between the North and South side of the street
and around the area, I have caught this entity in an orb form using infrared
film and this one just stand out. I sat at the corner of 23rd and State for 3
hours after 12:30 at night and watched it manifest itself and move around here
and there never seen this kind of activity. I'd name it the shadowman if I
could give it a name because it's very elusive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I thought I would share an
experience I had last year....<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My friend, and co-worker, Michael
was murdered last year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">attacked in the parking lot of a
major store here in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Las Vegas</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Michael<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">had serious brain damage and was
taken off life support about a week<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">after the attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was holding Michael's hand as he passed
away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Michael's family made arrangements
to have Michael's remains sent to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> for the
funeral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We decided to have a memorial
service for him<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">here as he has many friends in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Las

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was shopping for candles for my
kids and I to have at the memorial. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My daughter asked me if we should
get extra candles for people who<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">didn't bring any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was putting this entire memorial service
together<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">on a prayer and a shoestring as I
am a single mom with no outside help<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">for raising my kids and Michael's
family was strapped enough by having<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">to fly out to be with him during
his hospital stay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finally said
"we<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">will cut money out of our grocery
budget, lets just get them."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">purchased the candles and other
supplies we needed for the memorial<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">service (totalling just over $20)
and went to set up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My son came up to me when we were
setting up the amphitheater and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">showed me a dollar he found
blowing in the wind near the stage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">joked that it was Michael helping
pay for his candles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was funny<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">until my daughter (who hadn't
heard my son and I) came up and showed me<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">a dollar she found blowing in the
wind on the other side of the stage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Then is was just wierd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was bent down talking to one of our<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">wheelchair-bound customers during
the funeral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we talked, what I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">thought was a piece of paper blew
across my foot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I picked it up and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">put it in my pocket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we got home I took all of the trash out
of my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">pockets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was shocked to see what I had picked up was
actually a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">receipt from the store where
Michael was attacked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wrapped in the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">receipt was the person's
paper-money change... $19.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The receipt
was for<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">several purchases including two
movies (Michael and I always shared<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">movie reviews with each other) the
movies were Barbershop (I had been<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">joking with Michael the day he was
attacked about needing a hair cut)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and Waiting to Exhale (when I was
holidng Michael's hand after they<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">removed the life support, I kept
telling him it would be okay and he was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">just waiting to exhale).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, I know it was Michael just<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">letting me know he was still
around and watching.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We have had some strange events at
our office since Michael passed<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The automatic faucets in our restroom will
come on by themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(I always joke that it is Michael warming up
the water for me.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Sometimes you can enter our
building on the weekends and close and lock<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the door (we have a security
system that automatically locks the door<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">behind you) and when you get half
way down the hallway the door will<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">unlock and relock on its own (you
can hear it).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think he just hangs<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">out here because we were his
"local family" and he just misses us as<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">much as we miss him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever it is, Michael will always be

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that this floor was
"haunted" until some residents referred me to this <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">First off, a few nights I've
actually had dreams of someone in my room with <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">me while I'm sleeping, he didn't
speak to me, but I knew his name was <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">"Charlie".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In each of these dreams I am laying on my
back and he gets on <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">top of me and tries to stop me
from breathing ... however each time I wake <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">up short of breath. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Constantly I'll find trash that I
put in the trash can neatly lined up <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">outside of the trash, usually
after I take a nap during the day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">hallway is a very long one, and

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">usually close on their own. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">After reading about hanted places
in Washington me and a few friend decided to check it out for ourselves we
decided to go to the Black Diamond Cemetery because its not to far from where i
live in Kent it was probably sometime around 11 or 12 at night on Friday August
13th of 2004 that we heard the horse trotting down the gravel path and heard it
neigh i also saw the coal miners lantern but the light appeared to be comming
from underground the cemetary. my friend was sitting on top of my car on the
cemetary road and somthing pulled his shoe off his foot! This was the most
amazing haunting i've ever encountered!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Most people don't believe in
ghosts, spirits or whatever you want to call them and I was one of them until I
had my own encounter about 10 years ago. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Since then I've experienced a few
more bizzare events and I even have a very clear picture of one! I've searched
all of the sights but NOBODY had shown me a better picture than the one I have.
I've been trying to find a sight that would post it respectfully and maybe find
someone who can give me an opinion on it. But let me tell you my ten year old
story first.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">MISTAKEN IDENTITY<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was eight months pregnant and
hiding out from my husband. I had my two sons who were 8 and 6 at the time and
we needed a place other than my parents house to hide while I was filing for
divorce. My uncle Rich and Aunt Terry offered to put us up for awhile. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I had been to thier house on
several occasions prior but this was the first time we had ever spent the
night. I had no idea that I was about to have an encounter with a house guest
of a different sort. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We had stayed up late talking
about my husband and his other girlfriends, (Ex-husband now.) and had lost
track of the time. The kids had been asleep for hours and I was sitting at the
kitchen table talking to my Uncle while my Aunt was at the sink finishing up
some last minute dishes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was involved in conversation
when out of the corner of my eye I saw a little boy staring at me from the
opening in the hallway. He was wearing blue pj's and he had blonde hair. He
looked to be around 6 years old and I thought it had to be my son...out of bed
looking for me. I turned my eyes to him and looked directly at him for a brief
moment and then I turned quickly to look at my Uncle and said "Jeffery's
up."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I saw my Uncle Rich's face turn
suddenly pale as he looked over at his wife. She had spun around at the sound
of my remark and was giving her husband the same look. That moment I knew
something was wrong. It was if I had just caught them doing something that they
shouldn't have been doing. It scared me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">"What is it?" I asked
them after a few moments of silence. I looked towards the hallway again but the
boy was gone. Uncle Rich stood up and headed for the hallway without a word and
I followed him. We turned the corner and crept towards the bedrooms where his
children and mine were sleeping. "He probably just wanted a drink of
water." I said, but He shushed me and didn't reply. They also had two sons
but they were older than mine by a few years. Rich pushed the door open to the
bedroom were the four boys were sleeping. (His daughter was in the other
bedroom.) I walked in expecting Jeffery to still be awake. When I reached him I
shook him a little but he didn't stir. He was in a deep sleep...deeper than he
could have possibly feel into in such a short amount of time. They were all
asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My Uncle grabbed me by the arm and
excorted me out of the room..down the hall and back into the kitchen. My <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Aunt was awaiting our return ready
to answer the questions I was sure to be asking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">"I know I saw him." I
told her puzzled. "He was standing right over there."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Uncle Rich pulled on the kitchen
chair and gently tugged at my arm so I would take a seat. "It wasn't
Jeffery."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"It had to be." I told him. "He
was wearing blue PJ's just like Jeffery has on."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">"I know." Rich said
calmly. "He's about Jeffery's size too but it wasn't him."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was really getting nervous.
"Then who else could it have been?" I asked the question almost
afraid to hear the answer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">They told me about thier many
encounters with the boy over the next hour. They hadn't spoken of him outside
of the house for fear that noone would believe them and since he had always
apeared harmless and at times even a bit playful, they never saw the need to
tell anyone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">He usually appears at night around
</span><st1:time minute="0" hour="23"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">11</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> to </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="23"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">11:30PM</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. They've seen him in many different rooms in the
house but he never really scared them...he would just smile at them and
dissappear ussually. However there was one episode when he caused thier
daughter a liitle discomfort. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It was around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="23"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">11PM</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> one night a few years back when
they awoke to noise coming from thier daughters room. She was talking to
someone. Uncle Rich got up and went down the hallway to check on her. When he
reached her door he could hear her almost yelling..."Go back to bed...get
out of my room Jeremy!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">He filcked on the light and she
screamed. "Jeremy's under my bed...he just went under my bed!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Timmy was the oldest brother and
Jeremy was two years older than her. At this time he was around 6 and used to
wear the same blue PJ's. At first the boy had been mistaken for him until he
grew taller and the little boy didn't. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Of course they seached under her
bed and then they checked on her brother to find him fast asleep. After that
she slept in her parents room for awhile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">She said he was standing at the
foot of her bed staring at her. She told him to leave but he just smiled and
stood there until her Dad flicked on the light. When the light came on he slid
under her bed feet first as if he were made out of rubber! This was the story
she told me the next morning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This is an actual true account of
what happened that night. It made a believer out of me. Let me know if you want
my picture. It has never been viewed by anyone but my own family members and
close friends. They all think it's the best picture of a ghost spirit or
whatever anyone's ever shown to them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This happened to me not very long
ago, just a week or so before Christmas in 2004. I was at one of the shopping
centers in downtown Chicago on Michigan Avenue with a couple friends doing some
last-minute Christmas shopping. We were just about to leave one of the
department stores we'd just been in when a couple of us, myself included,
decided to use the restrooms before we headed back out into the mall. The mens'
and womens' restrooms are next to each other seperated by a small wall with
drinking fountains on it, and are each located down seperate short corridors
that lead into a tiny lounge space, then into the restroom itself. The two
girls went their way, and I walked towards the men's when all of a sudden,
seemingly out of nowhere, this dirty and burly construction worker walked
quickly past me and turned down the corner into the corridor that led to the
men's room. He looked like he was in a hurry to get there to do his thing. I
also noticed he made no sound whatsoever and also how I didn't see his face as
he strode by me quickly. I went down the hall and into the lounge area and
opened the door into the men's room. I didn't see the construction guy in there
as I walked to the urinal to do my thing. Then when I was done, I was shocked
to see both of the stall's doors open and both were unoccupied. I had to pause
a second and think. He couldn't have walked out in the minute or so I was at
the urinal, I'd have heard the stall door open and him walking behind me. Then
thought maybe he didn't actually come in the restroom but was sitting in the
lounge area and I didn't notice him as I was<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>walking through. I walked into the little lounge room, and of course it
was empty. I began to wonder if I'd even really seen the construction worker or
if I'd imagined it, but I then realized I did see him, because I could remember
details of what he looked like (like both of the knees of his jeans were torn,
and that he had a reddish flannel shirt on with the sleeves rolled up.) I
waited in the area outside the restrooms for the girls to come out and when
they did, asked if they'd seen the construction worker as they were walking
toward the ladies' room and they said they didn't see any construction worker.
If I wasn't seeing things, then I wonder if what I saw was a ghost<o:p></o:p></span></p>

100 yrs old... I thought to describe as being victorian style, with tall
gables, a large rap around front porch, with big white polls, when I was living
there, I seen a colored man, who appeared to be lynched from a tree.... where
only a stump sits ... and from inside the house in the early hours 2am 4am, You
can hear echos of a man screaming in horror, from the front bedroom,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and from the utility room...at the back of
the house, the cries of a woman... the whole time living there, felt as if
someone was watching from just around each door way, It was if I was under a
spell... all kinds of bad luck... I lost 5 pets, my job, and was robbed 3
times... besides the over all sadness... and out breaks of crying that came
over me each night!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were manly
foot falls above my room in the attic when I first moved in... one day I
explored the grand attic... found some things... and thought to have an
exercism.... Never heard foot falls again.. but thats when my bad luck
started.... after 4 months living there I moved... about a block away... have
had no problems... but I am still compelled by the large white house... Its a
sad house of once such grandiosity. I still stare at the place when I drve
by.... its sad to see it neglected.. and falling apart... I truly loved it...
but there is something about it... was always creepy...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the basement... the attic... it was a great
place to xplore.... but<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">feeling of paralyzing fear and a
sensation of "fight or flight".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now, <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">it should be also noted that my
friend I was with is not scared of <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">ANYTHING.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, I managed to get my camera out, I
charged the flash, <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">called out, "Well, I hope
you're hear", and snapped a picture.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I then <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">turned to my cold-sweating friend
and said "Let's get the (four letter <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">word) out of here!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think we set a speed record running from
that <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">stage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We then came back a few minutes later, and
were both hit<span style="">&nbsp; </span>with <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the same sensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I snapped another picture, (this time from
the <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">front of the stage, through the
curtains,) and we ran again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also,
throughout the school you can feel cold spots and presences, and <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">near the art room you get a
feeling of being not wanted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">(Also I suffer from sleep
paralysis sometimes, and I have had a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">is Lizzie.))<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was four years old when this
experience happened. I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">lived in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Okinawa</span></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Japan</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, in a
small base called the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Kinser base. I lived there for
almost 5 years, going<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">to school there and everything
else. One night,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">really needed to go to the
bathroom, so I got out of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my bed I shared with my older
sister. My dad was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">asleep and my mom was still awake
(she stays up until<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">like...four in the morning). My
room was across from<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my parents' bedroom, and right by
my parent's room was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the bathroom. Since I was too
scared to go by myself,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I decided to go to the bathroom
with my mother<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">instead. There was a LONG hallway
to the living room<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">from my room and my parents' room,
so I had to walk<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">across that hallway into the
living room where my mom<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">was. She was watching T.V.,
totally awake. I asked her<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">if I could go to the bathroom and
that if she could<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">come with me, but she replied with
a no. Then I asked<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">again, almost crying, and then she
replied with a yes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Soon enough, the two of us were
walking towards the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">hall, but suddenly my mom stopped
me. There, right in<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">between the my parents' bedroom
and my bedroom, there<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">stood a lady ghost. She was
wearing a plain LONG white<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">dress, blood red lipstick, big
eyes, no legs, and long<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">black hair. She had an asian kind
of look, kind of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Korean-ish. She stood there,
grinning at my mom and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">me. I cried very hard, but all my
mom did was kinda of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">shiver and smile at me, saying,
"Honey, don't worry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It'll be alright." Then the
ghost started talking to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my mom for some reason (Don't ask
me, cause I know<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">nothing about it that much since I
was four...) in<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Korean. My mom since she's full
Korean, understood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This is what the ghost said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">"Come here...come here,
little child..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">But since I didn't understand
anything, I just cried<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and stared blankly. I looked
towards the ghost's<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">bottom half, and noticed that she
didn't have any legs<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">or thighs or anything. Only one
long white dress was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">covering her. I panicked even
more, looking at my mom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My mom then started praying (since
we're Christians),<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and then the ghost frowned as she
started walking<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">inside my parents' room. My mom
looked shocked as she<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">ran towards her room, scared that
the ghost would hurt<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my father. I cried even harder, my
eyes more red then<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">ever. I ran with my little legs
towards my dad's room<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and quickly opened the door. We
saw the ghost for only<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">3 seconds, then she disappeared,
staring into my eyes<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">while grinning with her blood red
lips. I squeeled in<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">shock, then cried, then looks at
my mom. My mom nearly<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">cried as well, but then she kissed
my father gently,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">then looked at me with kind eyes.
I hugged her<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">tightly, hoping never to see that
ghost again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Blessedly, I didn't, but I hope I
don't, either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">You might not believe this, but it
was true.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Especially in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Japan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. I'm not

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">haunted country, but in Kinser, it
seems like it. Even<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my friends say that they have
encountered some<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">"ghosts" (AKA Demons
from Satan) that have came to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">their houses. It's a good thing I
don't live there<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">anymore...Well, enjoy! I'll think
of some other<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">encounters I've had...it's been

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was about in 3rd grade when i
had moved to my </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Saginaw</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> house. I
was walking on the side walk, just to take a walk, when this girl came out her
house and was like, " hey did you just move in?" and i was like, yeah
that green looking house, the big one" and she was like wow did u know
that the old people that lived there moved out because they heard gunshots. And
i was like whatever i didnt need to hear that.... about 2 years later everyone
was asleep and all of a sudden my mom, brother, sister all woke up to a HUGE '
BANG '. Suprisingly i didnt wake up because i was REALLY tired. Anyways, my mom
went and looked out the window to see if it was a gunshot outside... no one was
awake, and no one was outside.... FREAKY!!! Then, she went downstairs to check
if anything had fallen, and nothing had fallen!! <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My sister was only like 1
when<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we moved into that house. During
the daytime and nitetime my sister would often talk to someone, one time my mom
asked her who she was talking to, and she spesifficly said "Celia".
How could a one year old think of a name like that!!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">A lot of the times my mom would be
sitting on the couch after everyone was asleep, and would hear running
footsteps upstairs. It would go on for about 30 mins. or so and it got to the
point were my mom would go upstairs and say, " Ok were are you, I know
your hear, show yourself!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ok this is the last story. When we
were getting ready to move out, my brother, sister, and me were coloring in the
living room when all of a sudden we heard a huge bang!!!! I told them is anyone
was in the kitchen, run upstairs as fast as you can. As soon as we peered
around the corner, I found that the globe that goes over the light bulb was
laying on the floor not broken or anything, just laying there. When I went to
get a good look at it, I saw all the screws had been unscrewed!!! No one had
been in the kitchen!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I have had MANY more expiriences,
but that's all I'm going to say.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Hi my name is Andrea,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have several experiences but one stands
out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When I got married I moved an hour
and a half from home, One night my Daddy<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">calls me and asked "can you
take me to the Doctor"? He was having a heart<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew I could never get there quick enough
so I called 911. He<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">passed away before they got to the
hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now that you know the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">background, I'll tell my
story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the town knowing he had
passed, I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">didn't want people there at his
house going through his belongings or<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">stealing them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I being his only child , and he and my mom
being divorced I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">moved up there for a year, until I
got the will probated, and everything<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">moved, and settled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Daddy had three rings, that were worth
roughly nine<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">to ten thousand dollars a piece.
They were no where to be found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">just seen them the week before, he
wore them daily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was starting to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">wonder if they had gotten lost at
the hospital, before I got there, I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">didn't know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well two months after his death, I walked in
to the kitchen<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and the side by side refrigerator
was to my left. The freezer door was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">standing wide open. I called to my
husband, you need to close the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">refrigerator door after opening
it. He said, I haven't opened it. There was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">only one other person in the house
and that was our daughter, she was only<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">six months old. so she was out of
the question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just closed it and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">didn't think anything else about
it, "until the next day" it was open<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>this time, my husband was at work, and my

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">nap, I walked into the kitchen and
said, hmmm must be the seal, so I called<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and got someone to come look at
it. The Appliance guy looked and inspected,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">he said mam there is nothing wrong
with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just said ok paid him, and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">he left. That night my little girl
woke up<span style="">&nbsp; </span>so I walked to the kitchen to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">make her a bottle. I just used the
light coming from the fridge so I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">wouldn't totally wake up. I got
her milk out of the refrigerator, turned<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">around to the stove to heat her
bottle, and the room got brighter, I looked<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">behind me, there the freezer door
was open again. Well needless to say that<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">woke me up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I closed it, and then opened it, and it
seemed normal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">weeks went by, and this happened
daily.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I never came home and found it<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">opened, after being gone, it only
happened when I was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Daddy had<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">a little house dog, and one night
when I went to feed her I noticed she was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">out of food.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had noticed previously that there was a
pack of hamburger<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">meat in the freezer " so I
thought I would cook it and feed it to her", so<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>took it out and started cooking it. After a couple of minutes, I saw<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">"GOLD" There was his
rings pushed down in a pack of ground chuck.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">freezer door has never opened by
itself again<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">About two years ago I lived in an
older double-wide mobile home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had two
roommates and one of them was the daughter of the owner of the trailer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We had just watched a horror film
one night and she decided to tell us about things she says happened when she
was younger and the whole family lived in the trailer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The story goes that one night she was asleep
when she woke up for no apparent reason.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She said she was a lil disoriented but sat up and looked by her door,
didn't see anything, and then she looked in her closet and saw a man there,
grinning at her, holding a knife. She says she screamed and her parents came
into her room and turned the light on and he was not there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She thought maybe she was seeing things and
just went back to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The next night she woke up again,
only this time the man was there, standing, looking at her again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She didn't scream this time, but watched his
movements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went out her door and into
her sister's bedroom, and she got up and went to her door and he turned back,
looked at her, and stepped further inside and she ran to the room and turned
the light on and he was gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Now, I don't know if this is true,
or if she was just doing it to be funny.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It never happened again, according to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The real thing I'm writing is
about is what happened a few nights later.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now, I'm not a person who scares very easily, but the night this
happened I was scared out of my mind....and I still don't know what actually
happened, or if it was just a fluke.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I hadn't even thought about what
my roommate had told us, it just kind of dropped out of my thoughts, so I donno
if I was dreaming about it or what, but I remember I was asleep and woke up
like I had heard something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All I felt
was terror, which is unusual for me. I felt like someone was there, but I
couldn't see or hear anyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sleep
with my radio on and turned it down and there was nothing but silence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I laid there, waiting for the feeling to go
away, but it didn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It got stronger, so
I turned my lamp on and sat up...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
still couldn't see or hear anything but couldn't shake the fear....it was
starting to really bother me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told
myself I just had a bad dream and layed back down and turn the lamp on low and
turned the music back up and tried to calm down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I closed my eyes and tried to go back to
sleep, but there was just this feeling of sheer terror and it would not go
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't want to leave my bed, but
I the only thing I could do was go into my roommates room and wake her up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She didn't have that feeling, she didn't
sense anything but she said she's never seen me that scared and it startled
her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I ended up sleeping with her the
rest of the night, and the next morning felt fine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never had that experience again, but I've
also never been so terrified of anything, not even as a child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, I don't know what I felt, but it was
intense and although I didn't see anything, I sure felt something and it wasn't
pleasant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was between the ages of 5-8 when
I first started seeing a dark figure in my bedroom at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never felt afraid of course &amp; never
really thought of it as strange.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would
just wake up &amp; look straight at him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I usually saw him standing by a window.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One time I woke to find him at the foot of my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thing about this instance is that the
overhead light in our den was on &amp; the shadow was standing in the
light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also found it funny that it
looked like my dad standing in his underwear(LOL). I believe that it was my
grandfather whom died when I was 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
loved him very much.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was growing up
we lived in an area that was mostly family around us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My aunt lived in a two store home across the
street from us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, as a dare, when
the neighbor hood kids got together to play, we had to walk, not run, around my
aunts house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say I was the
only one that would walk around this house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I always felt as if someone was looking out the window at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although I never saw anything I always knew
it was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My children would visit
the new people whom moved in a few years back &amp; they have seen the ghost
sitting on the toilet &amp; it has played with them by pulling their hair or
poking them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked the new owners one
day how they liked the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
shortly after they moved in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They said
they liked it fine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well I then asked
them what they thought about it being haunted &amp; they said how did you
know?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told them I always knew it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, they had a few stories like hearing
someone walk around in the hall &amp; on the stairs with a cane, a cat walking
on the bed, even seen a man standing at the foot of the bed when there was a
really bad storm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the man&#8217;s wife
got sick &amp; was in the hospital they-the ghost, seemed to get worried &amp;
they were heard more often around the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were places in the floor that their cat would not walk on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have a daughter &amp; her husband will
not go into the house if no one is there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I like to visit the house because it is a very comfortable place for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The area the house sits on was an old
plantation that was built in the early 1900&#8217;s.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">These connections did not stop
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In every instance that I moved
from one place to the next from high school to where I live now has had some
type of feel to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have been visited
by my grandmother to tell her goodbye &amp; was visited by her again to
introduce her to my son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also told
me about heaven, although that part of it I can not recall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These two visits were in dreams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have also dreamed of thing&#8217;s that will
happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have been riding in a car
&amp; passed over places where people have died &amp; felt their spirit
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had one instance where for 4
days I had the overwhelming feeling of getting hit in the car on the passenger
side while going thru an intersection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This only happened when I was in the passenger side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, on the 4th day I got a phone call from
my brother &amp; his wife&#8217;s brother was riding with his cousin &amp; her young
daughter when they went to go thru an intersection &amp; they were hit on his
side of the car which was the passenger side.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately they all perished in the crash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that the feeling was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just recently I crossed a road &amp; got the
overwhelming feeling of complete &amp; utter terror as well as thru out my hand
as if to stop something from hitting me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was so overwhelmed about the feeling that I told a friend that there
was going to be a really bad wreck at that section of road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One month later two girls were hit at that
section of road &amp; were burned to death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Needless to say I tend to listen to my 6th sense because it has helped
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One more ghost story &amp; I will
save the rest for later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The year is 1992 &amp; I am
pregnant with my 2nd child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was living
in a house that was called Five Star because it had 5 points on it just like a
star.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, while I was pregnant &amp;
in this house I had a lot of activity happen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I could be standing in the bathroom &amp; hear kids running thru the
house &amp; laughing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could place my
hand on the wall &amp; see a child drawing on the wall with crayon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now I need to let you know that the only kids
in the house was my 2 yr old son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did
a lot of laughing &amp; playing but what I heard &amp; saw was not him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One time I was putting my son to bed &amp;
decided to lay down with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had my
back to the door of the room &amp; it was open to the back porch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was laying there I felt the bed jerk as if
someone grabbed the post &amp; shook it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I turned around to find no one there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I continued to lay with my back to the door &amp; within 1 minute of the
last shake the bed was shook again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
said, &#8220;OK, apparently you don&#8217;t want me to lay with my back to the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is this better?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned over &amp; faced the door &amp; it
quit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sitting on the sofa one day
watching TV with my legs crossed so I was not touching the floor at all &amp;
the couch was lifted off the floor twice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I went looking for my husbands friend one day-he lived in the house to
but had a hidden room kind of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You had
to go thru one room&#8217;s closet to get to his room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, as I walked into the closet I saw a man
standing in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said,&#8221; Excuse me, I&#8217;m
just looking for Billy.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, I never
left the closet so the man was standing 2-3 inches away from me &amp; I looked
in Billy&#8217;s room to find no one there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
said to the man, &#8220; I guess he went for a walk of something&#8221; &amp; turned around
&amp; the man was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now the house
had hardwood floors all in it &amp; anyone whom has hardwood floors knows they
are not very quiet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would have bumped
into me getting out of the closet &amp; I would have heard him walk away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, he was not there at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I found out later that someone hung
themselves in that closet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I moved from
the house 1 month before my daughter was born.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well, when she finally came into the world after 11 &frac12; hours of hard
labor I find that my daughter was born full veil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That explained all the things that happened
to me while I was pregnant with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
activity was so much more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, she
actually told me what happened the day she was born.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She recalls being really warm-still in the
oven-then seeing a bright light &amp; she got really cold &amp; then she
recalls being placed on the cart with the see thru walls &amp; leaving the
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was not surprised she remembered
it due to I knew she was veiled when born.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She does not like the fact that spirits are drawn to her or act up when
she has company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house we live in
now was built in 1910 &amp; there is a little girl whom resides there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have felt her around &amp; my daughter has
heard her slam doors &amp; walk down the hall way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have someone coming to the house that can
see ghost to tell me who she is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have
heard her call my best friends name when she had come over to spend the
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was funny to see my friend go
look for whom called her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She<span style="">&nbsp; </span>then comes to me &amp; says I know I heard
someone call my name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said yes, I
heard it to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said come to think
about it I heard a little girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said
yes, I heard it to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said but Liz is
not here-my daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said no she&#8217;s
not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, could not be anyone but the
ghost b/c it was a little girl&#8217;s voice &amp; the only little girl was not
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have more stories to tell but
this has gotten really long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hope it is
not to much.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Feel free to put on your
website but please leave my name off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
will write again soon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Experience # 3<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">After my 1st child was born my
husband &amp; I moved into an old mobile home that was situated right off a
main highway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, from the start I
felt there was something not right about the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not feel comfortable leaving my son
anywhere but in the dining room or den area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We also had a separate den area that his crib was in &amp; I was ok with
that room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mobile home was an older
70 rounder model that had a den (sons room), my bedroom small bath &amp; a
storage room built off the back side &amp; a bedroom, den &amp; porch built on
the front side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, when I was there
by myself with my son I always had a bad feeling about the storage room &amp;
bath in the back area of the home. There was a pin hole in the wall between the
storage room &amp; my small bath in my bedroom that I would have to cover whenever
I was in there because I could feel something bad watching me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a dog at the time &amp; she would stand
in front of the storage room with her hair raised &amp; growl really deep but
she would not go into the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither
would I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ended up taking my dog to a friend&#8217;s
house b/c the house became infested with fleas &amp; no matter what we did we
could not get ride of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every time I
would put my son in the bathtub I would be terrified that he was going to drown
so I would put very little water in the tub.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I also noticed that there was a permanent stain in the tub that looked
like rust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No matter how hard I scrubbed
this stain would not leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When in the
front bedroom, which looked across the hall from the storage room you always
felt like someone was going to walk in any moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We even had friends that would come over
&amp; they were spooked by these back rooms also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, we stayed about 6 months there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After we moved out I found out that the house
use to be used for satanic rituals &amp; gatherings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The front bedroom that was across from the
storage room was used as the meeting place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was a couple that found out they were going to have a baby &amp;
they had decided to get out of the cult.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well, the rest of the group decided that they could not get out &amp; the
guy was told he was to sacrifice his child.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Needless to say the boy was killed &amp; the girl was knocked out &amp;
the rest to the group took her baby &amp; sacrificed it in the tub.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was really glad to be away from that
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was also a house that sat beside
the one we lived in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had a few
friends over one night &amp; they decided to check this house out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, one of our friends ended up missing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They looked everywhere in the house &amp;
around the house looking for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
all, with the exception of Danny, came back to my house looking for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Danny was no where to be found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 30 minutes later while we were trying
to figure out where he could be Danny comes walking up totally white faced
&amp; sweating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We asked him where he
was &amp; he said over at the house next door.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said he got light headed &amp; passed out &amp; when he came to he
was leaning against a wall &amp; his watch was missing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He noticed this because he didn&#8217;t know how
long he had been out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well we never
found his watch &amp; we never did find out where he had disappeared to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have figured that when evil is around it
likes to play very bad tricks on you.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Funny thing is when I really thought about the area I never saw any
animals besides my dog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No birds,
strays, nothing. Hope you enjoyed this one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I purchased this home in 1974 just
months after the first owner passed away in her sleep at age 104.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was inexpicitly drawn to one bedroom and
although it was the smallest bedroom I made it into the master bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One night I felt someone shaking
me awake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I opened my eyes and saw
flames on the ceiling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran to the
hallway and into the guest bedroom and felt it getting hotter and hotter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I got to the window I saw the house next
door was on fire and the trees and leaves between the properties were on
fire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I called the fire department and
our house was saved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, when I
went back to the bedroom my husband was asleep and had not shook me awake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, there was no way I could have seen
flames on the ceiling because the bedroom was in the opposite side of the house
as the fire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">At </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="23"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">11:30 PM</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> each night my dog would stand at the top of the
stairs and growl and we could clearly hear someone climbing the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a later conversation with the daughter who
was 82, I was told that her mother was very active for her age and watched the </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="11"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">11:00</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> news each night and went to bed
precisely at </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="23"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">11:30 PM</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The room I was drawn to was the room she died
in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">After redecorating, I moved the
master bedroom to one of the larger rooms and made the other room into the
guest room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever a male stayed in
that room they would tell me that could feel a presence come into the room and
were quite frightened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Late one night my
brother in law was returning to the bedroom from the bathroom and felt someone
push him down the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our ghost
never seemed to bother a female guest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I sold the house in 1984 when I
moved to </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Newport</span></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">RI</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I miss my ghost friend. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
