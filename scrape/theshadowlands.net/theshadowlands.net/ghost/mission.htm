<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>The web page was created in 1994 to provide a safe and comfortable
place for people who have had an experience with a haunting and/or ghost
to share their story with others who have had similar experiences.&nbsp;
I am someone who has lived with and witnessed many paranormal events and
encountered many different spirits and ghosts.&nbsp; Because of my experiences,
I treat this subject very seriously in my attempt to educate, comfort and
help others who are having experiences they don't understand, are afraid
of or need help with.&nbsp; This page will always strive to educate you
on what ghosts are and how to deal with them.&nbsp; We will also provide
proof to the existence of ghosts in the form of pictures, sounds and eyewitness
accounts.&nbsp; We will provide advice and, along with experts in the field
who assist me here, help resolve any ghost related problems in your life.&nbsp;
Of course we will always provide a space for you to share your experiences
among friends and people who understand and to meet others who share similar
experiences. - Dave Juliano</b></font>
