<P><B>My grandfather John</B>
<BR><B>Rebel_girl69@msn.com</B>

<P><B>I’m 16 yrs old and live in the north suburbs of Chicago Illinois.
I've lived in my little town house my whole life and everything has always
went alright until I was 10 years old. At this time my grandma was diagnosed
with Alzheimer’s and was losing her memory which meant I had to take care
of her. About that time I started to notice weird things happening like,
light bulbs would blow out one after another, the T.V would turn on when
no one was in the room, things were moved around. I never actually talked
to him until the new year of 2000. I stayed up all night with my brother
and around midnight I went to my room at around 11:30pm. I sorta crashed
out at woke up exactly at midnight. I jumped with a start and started to
head down to the living room but before I made it to my door i heard a
voice say "I’m sorry". I couldn’t explain what it was. I talked to my mother
about and she has noticed the spirit of my grandfather ever since her and
my dad moved in, back in 1986. I asked my mom about the history of my family
and it had turned out my grandpa had died in the house in 1977 of cancer.
through out the past three years I’ve actually talked to him and would
give me information to tell my dad. After he told me I’m sorry and I told
my mom, everything started to change. Agian, all the light bulbs would
blow out, TV goes on so on so forth until I told my dad about it. When
I told my dad about it everything went back to normal as if I played a
messenger or something. He never tried to hurt me in any way but as I noticed
him I started to notice things that belonged to him popping up every where,
like personal items, his lighter etc... I still talk to him this day, I
still give messages to my father for him and I relized what the massagers
were. My grandpa was trying to apologize for the bad childhood my father
had. And it's believed that for the rest of my dad's life my grandpa will
keep coming back and apologizing for the way he treated my father.</B>

<BR><B>13 years of haunting</B>
<BR><B>Anonymous</B>

<P><B>I have only shared this with my family so I am little apprehensive
to tell my story. I have lived in Vegas my entire life and have never ever
experienced fear like this. I grew up on Cabrito dr. on the corner of Flamingo
and Lindell.&nbsp; For 13 years I could never sleep alone or in my room.
Strange smells would linger in the house. Earrings, Shoes or anything that
had a pair would end up disappearing; I was struck down with terrible ailments
from panic attacks (at the age of 5) to severe infections. Lights always
turned on and off, my mother was constantly angry and dishes would end
up cleaned and put away for no reason. One particular evening when I was
12 years old I heard our the car in our garage star up with the sound of
paint cans falling every were, the funny thing was we had no paint cans
and the only person who was home was my brother and I , we got so scared
that we called my aunt who lived down the street, but all of our emergency
phone numbers were off the hook so finally we called 911 and the noises
stopped. The worst incident came along when my family went out to dinner
when we came home my brothers room was destroyed the comforters had been
torn with toothpaste and burn holes all over it&nbsp; at the same time
our dog was barking into the corner of the wall in my bedroom ( which happened
all the time). For 13 years my brother and I slept in my parent’s room
on the floor out of fear. I constantly told them that something was in
our house, but they had invested so much they didn’t want to sell it. The
breaking moment came when I was 13 years old and my mother was woken up
by scratching along the walls of our hallway at the middle of the night
she woke up to find nothing, after that the house turned cold all he time
, nothing could fix it, so we finally moved out. To this day I will never
set foot near that house because something is there. Since we have moved
out there have been several other families to move in. None have them have
stayed for more than 3 years. Check it out for yourself. You can feel it
from the outside just a vibe that is very unsettling. I haven’t been there
in 9 years and will never return.</B>

<BR><B>3 Ghosts</B>
<BR><B>PFRO5@aol.com</B>

<P><B>As a little girl we lived in a house that had three Ghost. The first
one was in the attic It was a man that had hung himself. When we went to
bed you could here his foot steps . The attic set right above our bed room.
At night our room grew very cold&nbsp; and my sisters and I would cuddle
close together to keep warm.</B>
<BR><B>The spirit that I remember the most was that of my grandmother,
I was about 8 years and my grandma lived with us. We made the library into
her room, It was on the main floor&nbsp; My grandma got very sick I remember
how my dad and mom bathed her and how gentle they were as they tried to
make my grandma comfortable. My dad spoke softly to my mom as they lifted
her on to pillows. My grandma looked at my dad and closed her I for the
last time. I remember my dad telling her not to go and to please come back.</B>
<BR><B>It was not long when the rescue squad came and tried to bring her
back, but she was gone. My mom comfort my dad as the rescue men put my
grandma on the gurney. I remember when everyone was out of the room, one
of her arms had fallin off the gurney. I remember going over to my grandma
and putting her arm back under the sheet.</B>
<BR><B>It was not until after my grandma's funeral that I woke up and saw
my grandma at the foot of my bed. She was so beautiful, all in white, as
she flowed . I spoke to her and she brought her finger up to her lips and
shook her head to be quiet not to wake my sisters. I watched my grandma
as she smiled and turned to walk out of the bed room. I watched as her
gown trailed around the corner. She paused at my brothers room and then
she was gone. This was the begining of the spirits that I have seen.</B>
<BR><B>When my brother turned 18. My mom and him were not getting along
. So he enlisted in the army. While in the service, we lost contact with
him for a few months. I started to have a bad feeling I could not explain
how I felt to my mom because she was going through something her self.
I would wake up thinking of my brother like he was calling me. One night
I heard this wind blowing in through the window, And this moaning . I heard
foot steps with one leg dragging as it was injured. The spirit was calling
my name and I froze I could not move. Tears flowed down my cheek I was
very scared. Then the being laid across the foot of my bed. I thought that
the spirit would harm me, I felt him pulling at my covers. I prayed that
it was almost time for my dad to get up for work. What seemed like hours
the alarm of my dads went off and when he turn on the light the spirit
left.</B>
<BR><B>When I went down stairs My mom asked me what was wrong and I told
her. My mom . when I got home from school. My mom had a phone call from
a nurse that was taking care of my brother. He was very sick. He caught
bambo poison and could not write because of this. Once the nurse called
I didn’t have anymore of the happening until my uncle Judi die, the night
he died I felt him in presents.</B>
<BR><B>I have more stories to tell but for now I will close and get back
with you again later.</B>

<BR><B>A couple odd experiences</B>
<BR><B>PSnoozin@aol.com</B>

<P><B>Hi,</B>
<BR><B>My brother and I both experienced some slightly strange experiences
in the bedroom we shared as children in our Durham, NH house.&nbsp; Mine
was, one night when I was four or five, something bit my hand.&nbsp; There
was no one else in the home at the time except the babysitter who I could
hear on the phone in the living room.&nbsp; We had no pets at the time.&nbsp;
I was terrified and I still cannot explain it.&nbsp; My brother, in the
same room saw strange lights against the walls even though the curtains
were shut and, the house being in a rural area, there were no city lights,
car lights that could explain it.&nbsp; He said he saw the lights often
and they were like dancing circles but there was no source for the lights.
He told me that once, my cousins were visiting from Vermont and they saw
the lights too.&nbsp; They got excited, scared and my uncle who was harsh
came into the room to scold them but he saw the lights too. In the same
house, I constantly had nightmares about the kitchen. Mostly about the
cabinet doors swinging open and shut but I never experienced this happening
while I was awake.&nbsp; Later we had cats and they would refuse to enter
our former bedroom and they would act nervous in the kitchen.</B>

<P><B>The second experience happened in an old building in Miami, in a
section of town called Coral Gables. I was living on the second floor over
some stores.&nbsp; There were a few other apartments on the second floor
near mine.&nbsp; I was going through a very very rough time in my life
and I was contemplating suicide. But when I'd be feeling so down and hopeless,
there would be a knock at my door.&nbsp; It was a black woman, older, who
would say "I'm your neighbor, I live in the apartment behind you, I didn't
sell all my flowers today, would you like some?" I'd take them and offer
her money and she would shake her head no, she wouldn't take my money,
so I thanked her and felt so good for a few days for that small thoughtful
gesture from a stranger in a lonely city.&nbsp; After this happened a few
times, I wanted to show her my appreciation so I baked her a cake at Christmastime.&nbsp;
I went to knock on the door that she indicated was hers but a Latino man
opened the door and said he'd been living there for a few years and there
was no black lady living there.&nbsp; I asked everyone I saw in the apartment
building if they knew who she was.&nbsp; Finally one of the neighbors,
a Cuban man who had lived there several years, told me an older black lady,
a Jamaican woman, used to live in that apartment but she died of cancer
several years before I moved in.&nbsp; I don't know if the kindly visits
were spiritual or just the act of a kind stranger, but whoever she was
she saved my life.</B>

<BR><B>A few stories</B>
<BR><B>shaw@ruralinstitute.umt.edu</B>

<P><B>I have a few stories to tell, Mostly just to get it out.&nbsp; I
have carried one of them around for 21 years.&nbsp; My sister is the only
one that knows about it because she was with me and saw what I saw.</B>
<BR><B>In 1975, when I was two years old, my Grandparent's moved from Detroit
to Montana and built a beautiful 3 story home on 40 acres of treed property.&nbsp;
It has always been my favorite place to be.&nbsp; People have always felt
strange things in the house and seen things out of the corner of their
eyes, but these things can be explained off as anything.&nbsp; Nobody had
ever seen anything until the Summer of 1982.</B>
<BR><B>My Grandparents had moved out of Montana and my mom and dad decided
to rent the house.&nbsp; I was eight and my sister was six.&nbsp; We had
our own bedrooms, but always slept together at night.&nbsp; One night my
parent's were entertaining and we were put to bed at our usual time.&nbsp;
My sister and I would never go to sleep right away, we would just giggle
and talk for at least an hour.&nbsp; The room was dark except for the light
from the hallway that was coming through the bedroom door.&nbsp; We were
on the top floor and heard somebody coming up the stairs.&nbsp; We thought
we were getting in trouble for making so much noise so we instantly stopped
talking.&nbsp; The shadow of a man walked into the doorway and stood there.&nbsp;
We could tell that it wasn't my dad so my sister said, "John?"&nbsp;&nbsp;
John was my dad's best friend.&nbsp; We got no answer from the man standing
in our doorway.&nbsp; He stood there for at least two minutes and my sister
and I started to get a little uneasy.&nbsp; Finally, after what seemed
like an eternity, the man started to move towards the closet and because
of the light coming from the hallway, we saw what we had been looking at.&nbsp;
A man wearing some kind of a military uniform walked right past our bed
and disappeared into the closet, all the while smiling at us.&nbsp; This
man, whoever he had been was not threatening and looked as if he were just
saying hello.&nbsp; We never saw him again and we have held this secret
between the two of us for a very long time.&nbsp; Other things have happened
in the house but none were as scary as that.</B>
<BR><B>In 1985, My Aunt who is my mom's youngest sister and only three
years older than me, came to live with us.&nbsp; She brought with her a
cassette tape, it was NENA (remember the song 99 red balloons?)&nbsp; We
played that tape all the time.&nbsp; One day, we were playing it in the
living room (this was before stereo remote controls)&nbsp; In one particular
spot on one of the songs the stereo cranked itself up for a few words and
then went down again.&nbsp; We didn't think anything of it.&nbsp; We just
thought something was wrong with the tape.&nbsp; The next time we were
playing it in the living room, on the same exact place on the tape it did
it again.&nbsp; After that, we thought something was strange.&nbsp; We
told my mom about it and of course she didn't believe us.&nbsp; We told
her that we wanted to show her so me, my aunt, my mom, and two cousins
sat in front of the stereo and put the tape in on that song.&nbsp; On the
particular spot that had been scaring us, we all sat and watched as the
knob on the stereo cranked up and cranked down.&nbsp; My mom believed us
after that. The song was sang in German so we have no ideal what was being
said.&nbsp; Maybe somebody wanted us to hear those particular words for
some reason.</B>
<BR><B>My last story is a very recent one (September of 2000)&nbsp; In
1985 my dad was transferred to Washington for his job and we were raised
there.&nbsp; In 1999, My husband and I decided we wanted a change so we
decided to move to Montana since I loved it there so much.&nbsp; We called
my Grandparents and they agreed to rent us the house.&nbsp; We got there
and even though I had told my husband about the occurrences in the house,
he didn't believe me.&nbsp; Everything was quiet for a while until one
day we were sitting on the couch watching a movie and we heard a loud noise
like, thump, thump, thump like something was falling down the basement
stairs.&nbsp; Our son was only three at the time so my husband and I both
panicked and jumped off the couch and ran to the entrance to the basement.&nbsp;
The door was closed.&nbsp; My husband opened the door and the light was
off.&nbsp; I panicked and ran down the stairs.&nbsp; Nothing out of the
ordinary, my son was still playing in his room and nothing in the basement
had been disturbed.&nbsp; I said to him, "I told you so!" but he still
didn't believe me.&nbsp; A few months went by with little occurrences like
things disappearing and reappearing after we had searched for hours.&nbsp;
Noises like somebody walking on the top floor of the house when we were
all on the main floor and nobody else was in the house.&nbsp; My husband
always liked to say it was mice but I would always say, "those are some
pretty big mice to be making noise like that."&nbsp; One day, we were paying
bills in the office and we heard a noise that I had never heard before
and hopefully will never hear again.&nbsp; It sounded like something (I
can't say human or animal) that had been very hurt.&nbsp; Just this horrible
high pitched scream like moan, I can't even describe it.&nbsp; Our son
was with us so we knew it wasn't him.&nbsp; It sounded like it was coming
from outside so the first thing we thought was our dogs.&nbsp; We went
outside and they were both fine.&nbsp; We looked around the house and in
the shed and found nothing out of the ordinary.&nbsp; We thought it was
just a wild animal since we were out in the woods and went back inside.&nbsp;
The minute we got in the house we heard it again.&nbsp; We ignored it and
it happened again about five minutes later.&nbsp; I was getting frustrated
by this time and shouted, "please leave us alone!"&nbsp; As soon as I said
that, we heard thumping upstairs like somebody was running from one side
of the house to the other and back again.&nbsp; It went on for about a
minute and then abruptly stopped.&nbsp; After that, I think my husband
was a believer.&nbsp; But aside from the "soldier" nothing was ever seen.&nbsp;
We moved into a house in town, and my Grandparents rented the house out
to some college students.&nbsp; I often wonder what, if anything, that
they are experiencing. I also wonder, what is going on with the house.&nbsp;
My Grandparent's built it.&nbsp; They were the first ones to live in it
and nobody ever died in it.&nbsp; I sometimes think that the land was some
kind of a burial ground or something.&nbsp; Whatever it is, It isn't trying
to hurt anyone.&nbsp; I think it is only trying to get a message out.</B>

<BR><B>A Presence in Church</B>
<BR><B>smitchell@glastar.com</B>

<P><B>Here is my story...I attened a church in a building that is over
100 years old and is a historical monument in my city of Chatsworth, CA.
The church started out as a home for the Methodists, but they had to move
to a larger building when their congregation grew. It was then the building
was turned into a school. Several years afterward it was abandond, looted,
vandalized, and gutted by fire. The local historical society, with the
help of Will Rodgers and Dale Evans, had the church moved to its present
location and restored. It was just after that, that the Anglican Catholic
church I now attend made it there home and have been there for over 25
years.</B>
<BR><B>About 3 years ago the man who was the first pastor of my church
died from a long struggle with cancer. I knew him briefly and he attended,
along with my current pastor, at my conformation (I was 21 at the time).
His grave is next to his beloved church and his widow and grandchildren
attend from time to time. After he passed a wake was scheduled. It was
in the middle of the week and in the afternoon. I was unable to get the
time off of work and was disappointed in not being able to attended.</B>
<BR><B>Several months ago, an old photo was found of him by his widow and
she requested that it be added to our "history wall". A special service
was held on Sunday, during which the current pastor spoke about him in
the sermon and the picture sat on an aisle in the aisle.</B>
<BR><B>Being in the choir I sit in the same pew week after week and use
the same hymnal. Just before the second hymn of the service I opened up
my hymnal to find the correct page number. Something fell out of the book
and fluttered to my lap. It was a card about 2x the size of a business
card. Upon retrieving it I was intrigued to find a pretty "painting" of
the Virgin Mary on its front. Then I turned it over....on the back was
a printing of the 23 psalm in cursive writing. Toward the bottom of it
was a message that read "In memory of Father Edward Jones" (not his real
name). It was the card they had given to attendants at the wake over 3
years ago! I showed the card to his widow and the current pastor. His widow
sighed and related a time about 2 months before when we were preparing
small bouquets of flowers to place beside graves of loved ones of the congregation.
For some reason, one of the bouquets had a sprig of flowers that were different
and was slightly larger than the others which were all basically identical.
I had suggested that we save it and use it to place on his grave.&nbsp;
Sorry the story is so long!!!</B>
<BR><B>Thank you</B>

<BR><B>A Teenagers' Story</B>
<BR><B>BlueFlame0818@aol.com</B>

<P><B>My Mom was 43 years old when she died of breast cancer. I was only
12 at the time. This past Christmas my dad surprised my sister and I each
with a gold ring. We were confused at first and then he went on to tell
us that it was part of my moms' engagement ring. Well, I'm 14 now, yea
still young and still struggling with her loss. My family didn't go to
Church much and my mom always wanted to attend church more then we did.
When we sat in the pews I looked at my ring because it reminded me of her.
Realize that this ring is pretty lose, I have a small finger. I was sitting
in the service and tried to pull the ring off, it wouldn't budge. I somehow
managed to pull the ring off and saw that the ring had left a perfect imprint
of the outline. It happens every church service.</B>
<BR><B>My mom died in my house, in the chair in living room. Every time
I sit in that chair I feel the ring get tighter, in a few minutes I'm able
to pull the ring off and see that again a perfect imprint has been left.
Even when I'm with my boyfriend I get a cold chill up my spine and pull
the ring off only to find that the imprint has been left yet again.</B>
<BR><B>I know your probably thinking that my finger swelled and when it
went down the imprint was left, no, it's always at the weirdest moments,
either when I'm in church, sitting in the chair, or doing something I'm
not. My sister get it too, at the same places. My ring isn't very tight
on me, actually it's not tight on me at all but knowing that this was a
part of the ring that ment everything to her kinda makes me think that
she somehow is trying to reach me or tell me something that I'm still trying
to figure out.</B>

<BR><B>A Variety of Spooks</B>
<BR><B>TheCurious0range@aol.com</B>

<P><B>Hi there, I have a few happenings that I’d like to share with you.&nbsp;
I don’t know if these happenings are the work of ghosts or just my imagination
playing tricks on me but here goes :</B>
<BR><B>these are not in any particular order, only as i recall them.</B>

<P><B>I went to a school in Wimbledon called Ricards Lodge. Part of the
school was an old lodge that was used as some sort of house years ago.
I dont have any history of the school, like how long it has been there
etc., but I do know that the lodge is rumored to be haunted, especially
one of the classrooms on the top floor called L17 (thats what it is now).
As the stories go, the top floor of the lodge was used as a nursery and
room L17, a young girl committed suicide by throwing herself from the window.</B>

<P><B>Anyway, on with my story. After completion of our GCSE exams in 1990
the school threw us a party/awards evening. Bored with the fact that there
was no alcohol (even though we were 16) myself and some friends got talking
in the main corridor. One of them wanted to have a "quiet chat" with me,
about what I can't remember but I know that we walked down the corridor
to the Lodge part of the building.</B>

<P><B>My friend then said she needed to go to the toilet and she walked
up the stairs to the toilets to find the door leading to that floor locked,
so she went off to the other toilets in the main building while I waited
for her. I was sitting on the old creaky stairs that lead to the first
floor of the Lodge and I could hear footsteps and the sound of people running
about on the floor above me, also childlike giggles. I knew that the door
at the top of the stairs was locked and that there was no way anyone was
up there. I swear I ran for my life, totally freaked out. I'm glad to say
I never once set foot in that school again and was glad to have left.</B>

<P><B>Another story was of a trip I went on to an old Georgian Mansion
in 1986(ish) with my middle school. It was to a place called Stouthall,
in Mid Glamorgan in Wales. Before we went there we were told by the older
kids that the place was haunted so our first night there was spent staying
up spooking our dorm mates out with ghost stories.</B>

<P><B>Anyway, some of the teachers played pranks on us, one dressing as
"the white lady" (who supposedly haunted the top floor on which our dorms
were).</B>

<P><B>As stated the girls dorms were on the very top floor. These were
used as a nursery, sick bay and bedrooms for the Georgian inhabitants of
this old mansion.</B>

<P><B>I swear to you, we were laying in our beds in one of the dorms one
night and we could hear the sound of childrens footsteps outside and also
in the attic above us. A few girls from the dorm next to ours said they
heard childrens cries some nights, like children in pain.</B>

<P><B>No one ever went to the toilets (which were right next door to our
dorm) at night on their own.</B>

<P><B>Outside the mansion were some huts in which we had our social studies
lessons (the whole meaning of the trip). We were off on a field trip one
day when I'd forgotten to bring my camera along so I asked if I could go
and fetch it from our room. That feeling of being watched was overwhelming
when I went to my dorm to get my camera and I ran as fast as i could back
to the huts.</B>

<P><B>The whole trip was one big long nightmare for all of us, we were
there for 10 days and in that time everyone had nightmares, fell out with
everyone else and there was just a general feeling of uneasiness. One of
the boys in the dorms below us even went so mad as to threaten to throw
himself from his dorm window and had to be coaxed out of doing so by one
of the teachers.</B>

<P><B>Whether this was just a case of mass-hysteria I don't know, but I
do know I would NEVER go back there again in a million years.</B>

<P><B>Where my nan lived I am pretty sure that my dead granddad (who id
never met, he died from TB before i was born - possibly in the house, I
never asked her) I always felt a strange uneasy feeling upstairs.&nbsp;
If i had to go to the toilet I would bolt up the stairs as quick as I could
and then bolt back down the stairs once I’d been, slam the living room
door and lean against it so as not to let whatever I sensed was up there
into the safety of the living room.&nbsp; My parents always put this down
to childish silliness but I saw my nan on a couple of occasions talking
to thin air and smiling at someone I couldn't see.</B>

<P><B>I witnessed strange goings on in an old school friends house, this
house had a granny flat built on the side in which her nan died.&nbsp;
Other school friends had seen her dead nan in there, i refused to enter
the flat.&nbsp; But I saw pictures fall off the walls by themselves and
also witnessed a scrunched up piece of paper by the fireplace un-scrunch
itself back into its smooth A4 self.</B>

<P><B>I used to work for a company in Mitcham, Surrey which was situated
in the basement of a building which used to be an old house.&nbsp; The
housekeeper who lived in a flat on the top floor had seen a ghost down
there many times.&nbsp; If i was ever alone down there I would always shut
all the doors so I felt safer.&nbsp; If I was ever in the stock room I
always had that feeling of being watched and the telephones would ring
(all 6 lines) at once on occasion and no one would be there.&nbsp; BT engineers
couldn’t find a reason for that to happen.</B>

<P><B>Whilst I have never seen a ghose, I believe that I sense them.&nbsp;
I believe that on certain days of the year, anniversaries of someones (my
dads, aunts, cousins etc) death, I believe that whoever that anniversary
is specific to pops by just to say hello to me.&nbsp; I sense that there
is someone else there with us and my dog goes loopy, growling, barking
at nothings and following something invisible around the house.&nbsp; I
also get the feeling of being watched sometimes.&nbsp; My boyfriend is
a skeptic and thinks I’m being silly but I know what I feel and I don’t
feel threatened at all.</B>

<P><B>One thing that did spook me out was when my aunt was in hospital
dying of cancer.&nbsp; She had been in a coma for nearly 2 days and my
mum and i went up to say our goodbyes.&nbsp; My aunts children and their
families were all sat down one side of her bed and me and my mum were sat
on the other.&nbsp; My aunt had been in this coma state for nearly two
days and had not woken once.&nbsp; She suddenly lifted herself up, opened
her eyes, looked at me and said "Gem i'll be OK".&nbsp; She died later
that night.&nbsp; Why did she chose to wake up and say that to me and not
to her own children or grandchildren?</B>

<BR><B>Apartment 770</B>
<BR><B>embod81@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>The following story is something that actually happened to me about
2 years ago. It's a long story, but very true. To this day I remember everything
in detail.&nbsp; I used to live in Colton, California and at the time I
was living with my son, at the time he was 3 months old, and his father...Now
my EX. Anyway, when I first rented this apartment they wouldn't let me
look at it prior to me renting it. I thought nothing of it. Well I went
ahead with it and when we were moving in I just got that feeling, you know
the one where you get kind of light headed and everything sort of goes
in a circle for a moment. Well, that night I remember my son’s father was
in the shower and I got this feeling that I was being followed around.
But it was a menacing feeling, almost as if something was biting at my
heals. I had to sit on the toilet with my 3-month-old while until his father
had gotten out of the shower. It continued until I finally told him I had
to leave. We stayed at his mom’s house</B>

<P><B>The apartment had two bedrooms and one bath. You had to go past the
second room to get to the master room. For some reason every time I went
by the second room I would get that feeling. The hair on the back of my
neck would stand on end. At times I would see things, shadows, in the living
room and in my room. I just tried to stay put as to not attract attention
to myself. I would be in the shower home alone and hear a baby screaming
and I would get out and look around and nothing. Well, it continued with
us getting a kitten who when I was taking my son to the car ended up electrocuting
himself somehow. And we tried to replace him six times and every time each
kitten would die somehow. One with a broken back???? I thought for a while
it was the maintenance people. One night there was a power outing in the
entire complex and I was talking to my neighbor and he said they hadn’t
been able to rent the apartment out for seven months after a lady had lived
there before us. I don’t know what to make of it.&nbsp; The night we were
moving out the lights in the back room (master) started flickering. I thought
it was just me. I asked my ex if he was using his amplifier foe his guitar
and he said “no.” So I took him to the back and showed him what was going
on. We decided we needed to be out of there before nightfall. We just got
the feeling that something bad was going to happen that night. My son’s
father has a pentagram tattooed on his arm. Could this have been the culprit?
I heard that It is an invitation to “others.” Especially demonic beings
and such. Is this true? If anyone can answer this question and give me
some info. I’d appreciate it. E-Mail me. I have had no problems but lately
my son will cry bloody murder about a monster under his bed and I have
been feeling uneasy at times. His father with the pentagram is no longer
around.</B>

<BR><B>Ashmore Estates</B>
<BR><B>ViciousInfiinity@aol.com</B>

<P><B>I noticed that your site has a heading for Ashmore Estates just outside
Ashmore, Illinois, unfortunately you were not able to provide any information
on it.&nbsp; I have visitied Ashmore Estates on 7 different occasions and
have found it to be replete with supernatural activity including the incident
that I intend to relate in this letter.&nbsp; I was curious however to
hear what stopped your group from treading this place.&nbsp; Yes its not
so structurally sound and the "No Trespassing" sign out front can be some
what formidable deterrents, however my curiosity always gets the best of
me in these matters.&nbsp; Please first understand that I am not a novice
to the paranormal or a deluded teenager speaking from "group mentality"
or from sheer panic, and that the story I am about to lay out here is real
and true in its every word.</B>
<BR><B>On my third trip to Ashmore Estates, after my previous two yielded
very little paranormal response I was not expecting to find anything different
but in previous cases I have noticed that events seem more likely to happen
after a few visits so I decided to give it a shot on Halloween of 2002.&nbsp;
Two close friends and I arrived there an hour before sunset to find the
place jumping with paranormal activity including footsteps, voices, and
other odd noises.&nbsp; I usually dismiss such things being some what of
a skeptic bordering on cynical when it comes to the supernatural.&nbsp;
After a short foray into the basement things grew somewhat quiet and if
you are familiar with Ashmore Estates you know how the floors are divided,
anyway, we went up to the floor above the basement which is raised somewhat
above ground, this time ascending the stairs on the far side of the building
near the broken elevators.&nbsp; Things remained quiet for a time until
I noticed one of the doors leading to the rooms, or as I prefer to say
"cells"(considering that’s what they are more akin too) was closed.&nbsp;
I decided to try my hand at the large metal door, as I said my curiosity
often gets the better of my good judgment.&nbsp; Well as soon as I laid
my hand on this door things started to get a little bit out of hand.&nbsp;
The noises increased and the voices went from barely audible whispers to
in some cases outright screams emanating from the floors above us, and
they increased in intensity as we continued to attempt to force the door
open.&nbsp; Finally my friend and I were successful in forcing the door
open and when we did it grew eerily silent throughout the building.&nbsp;
We looked in to the "cell" finding it just the same as the rest.&nbsp;
Needless to say we started to move on when the door began to slam open
and shut on its hinges, normally I would dismiss this as an act of wind
or air currents through the old building, but I swear when that door started
slamming, the force of it and the frequency of it, could not have been
attributable to any air current that I know of.&nbsp; Also in that moment
a sense of panic and terror gripped me that I have not felt except on one
other occasion.&nbsp; Well we took off down the corridor because hostile
and malevolent spirits are not a toy to be played at and as we approached
the door leading into the stairwell I remember it being open when we first
arrived, it wasn't any more.&nbsp; I recall thinking in my panic stricken
mind that when we reached that door it would not open, and lo and behold
all three of us slammed into the door simultaneously and it would not budge.&nbsp;
As the door continued to slam in and out on its hinges just down the main
corridor, we waited fearing the next move, and eventually the place seemed
to calm itself and we were able to leave back through the way we came unharmed,
and without much other event, except on the third floor but that does not
bear mention here.&nbsp; On a side note how ever on fourth trip a little
more than a week later as we arrived I stepped from the van and I heard
the "click" of a door opening and as we approached the main entrance and
looked inside, not only was the temperature 40 degrees less but the previously
un-openable door, stood about 3 inches open.</B>
<BR><B>That is my story I hope you enjoyed it, I have many more about many
places especially in and around Illinois.&nbsp; Ashmore Estates however
is sort of my pet paranormal spot, I guess.&nbsp; I have visited it at
least 7 times, and it never lets me down, as I have not ran out of there
in utter terror any of the times I have gone.&nbsp; Its unfortunate that
you have not gotten a chance to visit it as I highly recommend it, and
this coming from a veteran of Bachelor's Grove Cemetery and also less renowned
Waverly Manor outside of Louisville, KY.&nbsp; The reason I wrote is I
am seeking all the information I can find on Ashmore Estates and the mystery
seeming to enshroud its closing.&nbsp; I have heard many stories I am not
sure which I believe though, and I was hoping that perhaps you or your
associates would have evidence corroborating some of my own.&nbsp; I am
sure that you are quite busy, but a letter in response would be much appreciated,
not only can you reach me at this address ( ViciousInfiinity@aol.com )
or Profane_Archon@lycos.com.&nbsp; Anyway as this letter is longer than
I had intended in the first place I will conclude by saying I appreciate
the work you are doing and as a student of the occult and paranormal its
good to know that there are likeminded people in what seems at times to
be a rather lonesome hobby.&nbsp; Thank you in advance.</B>

<BR><B>ToOCuTe4ya12@aol.com</B>

<P><B>One evening, three of my friends and I were bored.&nbsp; We decided
to go to a local cemetery that is nationally known to be haunted.&nbsp;
The previous day we had gone.&nbsp; In the day, we walked around, looked
at the gravestones and walked back by the pond.&nbsp; When we entered by
the path, the rope that hangs between to stumps to keep trespassers out
at night was laying on the ground. We thought nothing of it.&nbsp; We continued
to walk down the path to the cemetery.&nbsp; When we got there, we as well
as the other people there, had to go through a hole in the fence.&nbsp;
There were only a few people there so if anymore came we would have noticed.&nbsp;
When we left to walk down the path again, there were huge logs laying across
the path in our way, and the rope was hung back up.&nbsp; We did not see
anyone walk into the cemetery so it was strange.&nbsp; That was the first
day.&nbsp; The next day we returned at night.&nbsp; The moon was not out
so we had little light.&nbsp; We walked down the path again.&nbsp; The
four of us reached the fence with the hole in it and fought over who would
go in first.&nbsp; I volunteered.&nbsp; As is slipped my first leg through,
I looked toward the pond.&nbsp; I saw three pillars of mist hovering over
it.&nbsp; I quickly withdrew my leg, pointed and whispered "Look!"&nbsp;
Silence.&nbsp; No one said a word.&nbsp; We all looked at each other and
began to run down the path with the feeling of being watched on our backs.&nbsp;
That was all we needed.&nbsp; We trespassed on the resting grounds of these
poor souls and they wanted us out.</B>

<P><B>another time when I was a young boy ( I am 64 now) I had a dream
about being with a bunch of people at a beach when we happened to come
across a beached wooden type raft that people swim and dive off of and
it was beached on the sand because it was all broken.&nbsp; in any event
in the dream a couple of kids ran over to the raft when hundreds of hornets
came from out under of this raft and started biting everyone .&nbsp; then
I&nbsp; woke up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several months later my parents sent me to
a YMCA day camp for two weeks in the summer.&nbsp; on one of those days
we went to a beach hardly ever used anymore, there was no one there but
us (councilors and bout&nbsp; ten kids.&nbsp; from nowhere i remembered
my dream and warned&nbsp; the councs about the bees but only one person
took me serious and told all to stay back away from this raft. from about
twenty feet he and other people started throw rocks at the raft when hundreds
of bees came flying out&nbsp;&nbsp; it was a frightful experience to say
the least</B>

<BR><B>Breaking and entering ghost</B>
<BR><B>tdudley@twcny.rr.com</B>

<P><B>Hi my name is Jennifer I'm from TN, this is where this event takes
place. It happened when I&nbsp; was about 7 or 8. It was about 8 or 9 in
the morning and I was still in bed but I was just waking up. I was laying
there and a very tall man walked up to the edge of my door way and just
stood there and look at me for the longest time. I was small then and it's
been a while so I don't remember any features except that he was really
tall and skinny. He didn't say anything and he didn't move. After a while
he left from my doorway and walked into my mother's room and to her side
of the bed and stared at her but she was asleep so she doesn't remember.
After that he walked out of there and went into the kitchen and knocked
something out into the floor and then 'disappeared'. After I was sure he
was gone I got up and the outside door was wide opened. This is why I am
not sure if I have seen a ghost or if this is a real person because the
neighbors would definitely have saw him and reported it to the police or
to us. A relative of mine had died in that house a long time ago and my
mother tells me that he was really tall and skinny. Nothing was missing
from our house either. Why would someone come in and not take anything?
Has anyone else experienced a breaking and entering ghost? If you have
experienced anything like this please email me! Thank you!</B>

<P><B>A friend and I decided to check out a supposedly haunted location
we had heard rumors about.&nbsp; This was a huge open field with a cemetery
right in the center of it in Bremen, Indiana.&nbsp; We talked a few other
people into riding along and off we went.&nbsp; The rumors told us that
if we parked in front of the cemetery and got out we would see headlights
appear and disappear. Sure enough, it happened.&nbsp; We then decided to
cruise around the area and see what else we could find.&nbsp; I then noticed
a car driving down a perpendicular road so i decided to follow it and see
where it led me.&nbsp; We caught up to the car and we were probably about
fifty feet from it.&nbsp; The car then stopped as if it noticed me following
it.&nbsp; We also stopped and watched the car for about thirty seconds.&nbsp;
As we stared at the taillights the car just blinked out of existence.&nbsp;
We drove up to where the car was,&nbsp; nothing........&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I’m stumped.</B>

<P><B>Hello Dave and Tina, Just wanted to say hi, I went to work the other
day&nbsp; and it was early in the morning. That I felt the presant of something
in the room I was in. The place I work is the old Hospital that had been
changed into offices and is now the health Dept.</B>
<BR><B>The room that is my office use to be the Morgue&nbsp; On this day
I was the first one in and alone, ( I thought) I walked down the Hall to
my to my office, It got extremely cold, A cold that went down to the bone
and mad you shever and the hair on the back of your neck came up. When
I got to the office I heard foot step and the things being dropped to the
floor, When I turned to find out who was here their was not any one there.
I sat in my chair at my desk the soap at the sink fell on the floor. when
i went to pick it up the papers at my desk moved like I had turned on a
fan, they blew off the desk. By the time I picked that up I heard someone
in the hallway, Which no one was there. whan I went back to the office
my pen&nbsp; rolled off the desk. By this time I was getting upset. I remember
picking up my pen I glanced up to see a figure. I told the being to stop
being a pain in the butt and leave me alone. He must of thought that was
funny because on the way out he dropped the soap to the floor and blew
my papers on the floor again. I call the spirit Bufford. The girls I work
with thinks its funny that I have a name for him, well I will let you guys
go I really enjoy your input . and I love the pictures everthing about

<BR><B>Cole Hall</B>
<BR><B>jec002@Bridgewater.EDU</B>

<P><B>My freshman year at Bridgewater College (1999) I was employed by
the campus to set up sound and other things for events that the College
promoted.&nbsp; On homecoming weekend, the College was having a bonfire
and the pep band was entertaining a crowd.&nbsp; The pep band finished
their set, so I was sent along with another guy to go retrieve a cd and
some stands and cords from the Cole Hall sound booth.&nbsp; All the lights
were off in Cole Hall because to turn them on you have to get a key to
open the closet that has the light switches.&nbsp; We were too lazy to
get the key and neither of us had ever heard anything about a ghost in
Cole Hall so we went to get the cd.&nbsp; Enough light spilled in from
the foyer that we could see the stage.&nbsp; While in the sound booth my
friend and I heard distinct sounds coming from behind the stage curtains
that resembled sounds you would hear if people were moving props around.&nbsp;
All the lights were off and if anyone were on the stage moving props they
would not be able to see what they were doing.&nbsp; The sounds caught
our attention and we looked down at the stage.&nbsp; When we looked at
the stage, there was a man dressed all in white on the stage between the
curtains staring up at us.&nbsp; The sounds stopped but there was definitely
someone else in the auditorium with us on the stage.&nbsp; I took a step
out of the sound booth to get a better look and there was no one there
but the sounds definitely were.&nbsp; We hadn’t yet gathered everything
to take out to the bonfire so I went to help my friend gather up the stuff
we had to get and I looked at the stage again, and he was back.&nbsp; By
now I was pretty freaked since I have had multiple childhood experiences
with ghosts and I knew what was going on.&nbsp; We both got the stuff and
quickly left the hall but as we leaving we still saw the man on the stage
and we heard the noises as well.&nbsp; I hadn’t thought much of it until
recently, I am a senior now, and I told a friend of mine of my experience.&nbsp;
He thought the part about the guy being dressed in white was interesting
because the founder of the college wore a white suit with a little bowtie
when he got his picture taken.&nbsp; This is what encouraged me to share
this story with your site.&nbsp; Many people report seeing this ghost in
Cole Hall and I am always a little freaked whenever I go in there, it doesn’t
matter what time of the day or how many other people are in there, Cole
Hall gives me chills. this happened four years ago</B>

<BR><B>Crazy Ghosts</B>
<BR><B>liquid_delirium@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>Hi!&nbsp; I've been a very spiritual person my whole life.&nbsp;
Ever since I can remember weird things have happened to me.&nbsp; Throughout
my life I've had people tell me that I am a spirit magnet... because wherever
I go, abnormal things start to happen.&nbsp; Well, this experience was
one that I will never forget!&nbsp; It all started a Saturday afternoon
when a friend and I decided to go shopping at our local mall.&nbsp; Of
the many things I had boughten that day, the most important thing was a
bag of crystals I had picked up.&nbsp; When the day had ended and I returned
to my home, I hurried to my room to look at all of the new things I had
gotten.&nbsp; I pulled out all of my things and put them on my bed... when
I was finished looking I remember I left out the crystals so that I could
inspect them and see exactly which kinds of crystals were in the bag.&nbsp;
After I inspected them and (counted) them, I put all 18 of my crystals
in the bag and set them on top of my dresser.&nbsp; I was getting a little
tired so I retired to bed.&nbsp; The next morning, I was still a little
groggy, but I managed to move myself to the side of the bed and roll off.</B>
<BR><B>Standing up I noticed that right at the foot of my bed there were
3 crystals lying on the floor in a little triangle.&nbsp; Quickly, I ran
to the kitchen where my mother was making coffee and asked her if she or
my little sister had been messing around in my room and got into any of
my things?&nbsp; She replied with a simple “no” and that was that.&nbsp;
I raced back to my room freaked out to the max grabbed the bag of crystals
off of my dresser and immediately started to count them out.&nbsp; I figured
that if there were 3 crystals on the floor than obviously there had to
be only 15 crystals left in my bag from when I had previously counted them.&nbsp;
To my surprise there were 18 crystals still in the bag for sure, and there
were an extra three on my floor at the foot of my bed in the shape of a
triangle!&nbsp; Weird... I think so!&nbsp; I didn't exactly know what to
think at the time so I just picked up the crystals and threw them in the
bag as well.&nbsp; The rest of the day was fine, my mother, sister, and
I had went to visit my grandma and grandpa.&nbsp; It was getting late around
7, so we decided to get going.&nbsp; When we returned to the house, I noticed
something under the window of my bedroom... I asked my mom if she could
see what it was and she said she didn't know?&nbsp; I was a little scared
to go and check it out so I made her come along with me!&nbsp; Reaching
the window made chills run up my spine... under the window sat three very
large sized rocks piled on top of each other.&nbsp; At this time my mom
had realized what was going on by the look on my face... she put 2 &amp;
2 together and figured that something to do with spirts was going on once
again!&nbsp; That night I forced my mom and little sister to sleep in my
bed with me because I was so freaked out I couldn't stand it.&nbsp; I was
up all night, and of course no one else in the house was having trouble
sleeping!&nbsp; All of a sudden I started to hear a really disturbing screaming
noise... it was coming from our neighbors house (we lived in the country
so they were fairly close but in the woods) across the street.&nbsp; In
my head I knew what the screaming sounded like but I wasn't quite for sure.&nbsp;
I had to wake up my mom!&nbsp; When I woke her up, I told her to listen
carefully... I was surprised that she actually did!&nbsp; After a while
she said to me “ ya know that sounds like... pigs getting slaughtered!”
I quickly replied, “ I know mom, it really does”</B>
<BR><B>She dropped it like it was nothing and told me to go to sleep and
that maybe the neighbors were pig farmers or something.&nbsp; (Having never
met them I couldn't disagree with her statement so I tried to go back to
sleep.&nbsp; So much for that!&nbsp; Next thing I knew I was seeing little
apparitions of pigs!</B>
<BR><B>Yeah PIGS!&nbsp; I wasn't that scared because I thought that I might
just be really scared from the noises that I was making myself see things?&nbsp;
I tried to wake my mom up again but she was dead asleep and snoring!&nbsp;
I shut my eyes and pulled the blankets over my head.&nbsp; I really needed
to get some fresh air after about 5 minutes of being under hot blankets
so I took them off of my head and was blown out of my mind to what I saw!&nbsp;
There where shadows of people all over my walls and ceiling, and there
were tons of orbs ( what I thought at the time were spirits but I didn't
know what they were really called I just figured wow that's really scary
it must be ghosts) floating around everywhere!&nbsp; I started freaking
out like I was going crazy... I tried viciously to wake up my mom ... she
wouldn't budge!&nbsp; I just tried to stay focused on waking up my mom
and not too much on what was going on around my room!&nbsp; That didn't
work too good because when I laid back down and tried to be really still,
something touched me on my arm and then the hair on my head started to
get pulled... then from what sounded to be under my bed I heard crying!&nbsp;
A little girl yelled my name... and that was it that did it for me..&nbsp;
I jumped up so fast I don't even think a second went by!&nbsp; I grabbed
my mom by her head and screamed in her ear louder than I ever have in my
life!</B>
<BR><B>She woke to me in her face balling my eyes out and she didn't know
what to think!&nbsp; Things were calmer now that she was awake though.&nbsp;
I told her everything that was going on... and I hated it because she couldn't
even see the things that were in my room... and they were there the whole
time she was awake!&nbsp; I've learned to live with the fact that I see
things that most other people don't... and I guess I'm doing pretty good...
I don't think a day goes by where I don't see something!</B>

<P><B>just a short story of the one of the many things that have happen
in our family</B>

<P><B>about four months ago my sisters were looking through old photos
of great grandparents then a perfume smell came over the room and they
felt strange they were looking at a picture of their great grandmother
who had died when they were young to young to really remember her, the
smell was confined to one area it made them feel un-easy a few weeks later
they told our grandmother (daughter of the woman in the picture) and my
grandmother open up and talked about the room in which her&nbsp; mother
had been care for in their previous home that occasionally had a perfume
smell come over it,&nbsp; my grandmother was always to scared to tell anyone
in case they thought she was crazy she always thought it was her mother&nbsp;
I never knew when i was a child that that was the room that my grandmother
lived in and my sisters and i always avoided that room and if we did have
to go in there we all went together it was always creepy.</B>

<BR><B>Crying baby in my room.</B>
<BR><B>Brittonsbug@aol.com</B>

<P><B>I was sitting on my bed one night and I kept hearing a baby cry.
We had no kids in my family that were under the age to 6 so at first I
thought I was hearing things. When I kept hearing it I went to check and
see if it was my brother or my sister, they were fast asleep. I went back
to my room and turned on my radio and drifted to sleep. At about 3:00 in
the morning I woke up to see an infant in a walker by my bed. It was a
baby boy. He just sat there looking at me. I’ll admit it did scare me,
but I didn't want to leave. There was something that just wouldn't let
me. I pulled the blankets over my head and tried to go to sleep. It didn't
work. I had to see if it was gone, so I pulled the blankets down slowly
and peered out. He wasn't there. to this day I still hear the faint crying
of a baby in my house and sometimes wake up to see him in my room. I didn't
tell my parents because I thought they would think I’m weird or something,
but I swear this is true. I’m not really sure why he is here, but I know
that it's not going to hurt me. This is my true story. Can anyone give
me advice on why they think he is always in my room or why he is in my
house? I’d really appreciate it. Thank you.</B>

<P><B>I remember when my mother told me that when she was like 7 or 8 years
old she was really sick and my nana bought her a plastic doll for her to
feel better.Then my mom woke up one night and found the doll sitting up
in the middle of her floor. She said the dolls head spun around and then
walked out of her bedroom and they never found the doll since even when
they moved out of the house they didn't find it.</B>

<BR><B>Experience with a haunting</B>
<BR><B>jrtaylor@cal.net</B>

<P><B>a few years ago I was living in Compton Californian. I was in my
closet looking for a toy for my dog. I turned the light off and closed
the door. when I opened the door to put the toy back the light on. I asked
my brother if he had turned it on he said no. so I turned off the light
and closed the door. I stayed in the room to see if my brother was playing
around&nbsp; then two minutes later I opened the door and the light was
back on. I screamed for my brother because I thought I was losing my mind.
so just to make sure I wasn't I turned off the light, closed the door and
a minute later I opened the door( with my brother by my side to make sure
I wasn't losing my mind ) and the light was on.</B>

<BR><B>Experience</B>
<BR><B>WENDYEDWIN@webtv.net</B>

<P><B>Hello-Like to share this...I was about 4 yrs old when this happened.
Lived in a big old Victorian house where many ancestors also had lived.</B>
<BR><B>I always thought they were still living people when they came to
"visit". Most vivid one-I do remember it was a bright summer day, and a
lady come to the front door asking for my mother. Now, this was about 45years
ago, so kids did not fear people coming to the door and usually ,doors
were not locked anyway. I had no idea where my mother was, but&nbsp; I
let the lady into my home. She proceeded to sit down in the living room
on a red Empire couch and wait for my mother. I was not afraid of her at
all, But she had a long pale yellow dress and a matching big Victorian
hat. She seemed to glow a little, but as a child, I thought it was only
the sunlight. Suddenly, she got up and said, "Tell your mother that Aida
said, don't worry. It's BEAUTIFUL.) She walked to the front door and left.
When my mother came home and I told her the message, she got limp and sank
onto the same place on the couch where Aida sat just minutes before. She
said , in a frightened voice, "Are you sure she said Aida? My cousin Aida
just passed away 3 days ago." Then I found the same dress Aida had worn
in an old sea chest up in our attic when I was looking for a Halloween
costume a few years later. And I still remember that</B>
<BR><B>Aida seemed very worried that I was all by myself in that big house.</B>
<BR><B>Many other experiences. But in the late 80's my mother sold the
house because of evil hauntings. I had one myself when I was 21 and I just
got out of there. It was right after my father died, but it wasn't his
ghost. Anyhow-very wierd, but, nonetheless-true. Also have a story about
the ghost of a cat. If you're interested, I'll relate. Have had witnesses
to some. Have premonitions. Yeah, told people 1st &amp; then they really
happened. No reason to invent this stuff. Lots of folks are afraid of me
because they know it's true. THAT bothers me, but whomever they are, they
helped me do my homework in High School . I used to wake up in the middle
of the night and have to look up a word I'd never known in the dictionary,
because it fit right into poetry I was writing, because it rhymed, but
didn't know meaning. After looking it&nbsp; up – it fit 2 a T! By the way,
after that house in which I grew up was sold, several different&nbsp; people
bought &amp; did'n't stay long. It was "evil" when</B>
<BR><B>I left, like I said. PS - I know it's rambling, but it gets me going
and start to remember excitedly, what I have told to so many who now won't
let me, especially after I've had dreams about them which happened.-Wendy</B>

<BR><B>Experiences</B>
<BR><B>keelie_15@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>I have grew up in the north east of England surrounded by my family
of</B>
<BR><B>psychics. Here are a few experiences that I would like to share
with you.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all I own a few horses and was
keeping them at a local farm with a very strange feeling whenever you entered
the main building. One night I was grooming my horse and had the feeling
of someone standing behind me at the stable door. Thinking it was my grandmother
who had been standing there a couple of minutes earlier I started talking
to her. After I didnt receive any reply I turned round to look at her to
find nobody there. I found out I wasn't the first to experience&nbsp; that
on the farm.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few days later, i was walking down the
stable block and caught&nbsp; sight of a middle aged woman in one of the
stables out of the corner of my eye.</B>
<BR><B>When i looked again she had gone. She had been wearing a red coat,
grey trousers and had blonde hair. I decided to do some research and discovered
that a woman who fitted that description had hung herself in the stable
block many years ago.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly. I have family who were
moving to Scotland, whilst looking after their children in the new house
something rather strange happened. My eldest niece ran and shut the door.
When i asked why she said that the 'baddies are coming'. All of a sudden
there was a terrible noise like a bed being thrown down the stairs from
outside the room. I tryed opening the door but it wouldn't budge. Finally
it opened and everything was normal and no one else was in the house. Many
visitors to the house have had numerous experiences.</B>

swimming. When all of a sudden we saw a man dressed in black. we were so
scared. we screamed and he hid behind the bushes. we yelled that we would
call the cops. then all of a sudden he just sat down. this may not seem
scary yet but listen to this. his hat got caught in the bushes. me and
my friend got out of the pool to look. the hat was gone! a month later
we had a black out, when i was sleeping over my friends house. then all
of a sudden the same man knocked on the door saying ' let me in, i have
to use the phone'. we all screamed. half hour later the power went back
on, we called the cops and he got arrested. we r still freaked out to this
day.</B>

<P><B>I believe that I get my abilities (such as they are) from my Grandma.&nbsp;
She is Brittish descent fully, and that implies alot.&nbsp; She believed
that if you dream of the dead, you will hear of the living.</B>
<BR><B>She dreamt that my Grampa, who passed when I was 7 years, was laying
next to her in bed and told her that he loved he very much.&nbsp; The next
day she heard of one of my relatives that she knew and I didn't, had passed
on and when the funeral was.&nbsp; Spooky?&nbsp; maybe.</B>
<BR><B>When I was in grade school, my teacher took us on a field trip to
a cemetary in Portland, OR to sketch the things we saw there, be it a tree
a headstone, or one of our classmates.&nbsp; This was all well and good,
except that when I found what I thought was the perfect spot and thing
to sketch (a really neat looking headstone), I saw a specteral hand come
up from the ground surrounded by mist.</B>
<BR><B>Let me tell ya, as a pre-teen I beat feet out of that area, and
back to the rest of the group, and drew a bird in a tree instead.&nbsp;
I also found out that a lot of the other students had seen a mist swirling
in the cemetary that day as well.&nbsp; Only one problem...it was a 70

I turned my head to the right and saw an old man in old style clothes.&nbsp;
I turned my head back and talked a SEC to my friend mentioning the old
man.&nbsp; I turned my head back and he was gone.&nbsp; We went up to the

<P><B>This occurrence is my one and only paranormal experience (I'd love
to have more).&nbsp; For the past year, I have had a part time job working
for an ambulance company.&nbsp; This company is one of the few remaining
combination funeral home / EMS services in the region.&nbsp; One day, I
was sitting in the ambulance bay resting between calls.&nbsp; The ambulance
bay is in the same building as the embalming / body preparation area.&nbsp;
I was in a meditative state, but had my eyes open.&nbsp; Out of the corner
of my eye I observed a girl about nine years old walk through the back
wall of the ambulance bay toward me.&nbsp; I remained motionless and when
she arrived at my side, she smiled and blew a puff of air onto my cheek.&nbsp;
I could distinctly feel the breath and, at this point, I realized that
I was not day dreaming.&nbsp; The child was dressed in a slate blue jumper
with a white blouse.&nbsp; The outfit she wore could have placed her anywhere
from the late 19th century to the middle of the 20th century.&nbsp; It
looked like a school uniform. She was slender with mousey brown hair and
dark eyes.</B>
<BR><B>After blowing on my cheek, she smiled and walked past where I was
sitting and disappeared through an exterior wall, just to the left of a
door.</B>
<BR><B>Later, I asked some of the other paramedics if this apparition was
familiar to them. It was not.&nbsp; However, two of the medics stated that
they have seen and/or heard ghosts in the ambulance bay building and in
an adjacent former residence, now used as the dispatch center.</B>
<BR><B>Although I have tried sitting in the same place and being quiet
and meditative, I have failed to see the little girl again... but I will
keep trying.&nbsp; There was no fear involved with the paranormal event,
only a sense of love and gentleness.</B>

<BR><B>Ghost in our House</B>
<BR><B>penendos1@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>Hi I have been reading many of the stories here and it's good to
see that I am SANE!!!!!!!</B>
<BR><B>Ever since I was little I have always had ghost experiences! They
seem to follow us from house to house. Anyway none of the experiences were
as scary as this one.</B>
<BR><B>I was about twelve at the time and my two older sisters were at
College they were about fifteen and seventeen.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway we slept in the same room my there was a double bed and a
single bed and that nite my older sister who I’ll refer to as Mazzy (cos'
she'll kill me!)was greedy with the double bed and all the duvet's she
had on that bed as it was in the middle of winter so me and my other sister
Tallulah had to sleep on the single bed! (was really annoying!)We all went
to sleep and around 1-2am I heard mazzy saying "shut up Pene or I'll come
there and dong your head'(this was how we normally spoke)and i was half
a sleep and i heard her saying again 'WHAT!! I'm gonna come there and slap
you I MEAN IT!!' and at that point I woke up and said 'what?' she sat up
immediately in the bed and looked at me. 'Why'd you say that for?' she
said 'Say What? I was sleeping' and she said 'You were getting smart I
HEARD you and stop lying!'</B>
<BR><B>I started crying not knowing what she was talking about and at the
same time we both heard someone laughing in the corner of the room! I woke
up Tallulah and asked her if she could hear it and she said 'yes it's one
of you stop being stupid and go bak to sleep!' and then we all heard this
thing in the corner of our room laughing again but an evil scary laugh!
We were all talking in unison when this happened and we all flipped out!
We jumped into Mazzy's bed and she was frightened as! We lay there and
it stopped and we shut the curtains! As my sister lay down after shutting
the curtains a figure appeared to be sitting on the window sill and it
was calling my sisters name "MAZZY-MAZZY!!!!" but in an evil gross way!
We all screamed and my sister Tallulah said "F**K OFF!" and it just got
worse! it was like there were 50 people in the room all laughing and mumbling
at once but this ONE voice was calling my sister and laughing! We all screamed
for my dad (we call Twinkle Toes cos' if he hears one little creak he'll
be up investigating he always wants us to be safe)but we were screaming
and banging on the walls and no one came!!! I started crying and my sister
sat up (Tallulah) and did a prayer while the figure was still sitting there
and I thought she was really brave I thought this would work but it didn't!
Tallulah ended up running to my dad's room and waking him up and he came
in to investigate and ended up sleeping in the hallway just outside our
room!!!!!! That house we lived in for only FOUR months we've lived in many
haunted houses and had many hauntings but I can honestly say that we all
felt we were in grave Danger that nite! People move into that house only
to last two months SERIOUSLY!! We were the only family who lasted that
long-My dad wanted to stay cos' he's not scared of them but he moved because
of us!(My dad's mother was a witchdoctor who made contact with the dead-I
think this may have something to do with our hauntings!)</B>

<P><B>back at the start of 2003, my brother's gerbil, 'bubbles' who the
whole family loved dearly, died tragically. Everyone was very traumatized
by this experience (it was the first time we had lost a pet) I lay awake
for hours that night until I fell into a sort of grief induced stupor.
That’s when I saw him walking across my bed cover towards me, I just somehow
knew why I could seem him so I just said goodbye and he went. The next
morning everyone felt a huge feeling of relief as if everyone knew he had
gone and was peacefully in the afterlife (or where ever gerbils go).</B>

<P><B>A few moths later, one of&nbsp; my pet rats fell ill with a tumor
and was consequently taken to the vet. She was very weak from having the
tumor so the experience of going to the vets actually gave her a heart
attack. I took it very well and just accepted that she had also passed
on to somewhere better. The next night I just found myself talking to her
(I’m not religious but it was the same way people talk to god when they
prey). I asked her top help me do well in life and to be able to help others.
I had an important saxophone exam coming up and an interview for college.
I Passed my grade 8 sax exam with merit and the college offered me an unconditional
placement.&nbsp; Say what you will, but I believe she helped me to do that.</B>

<BR><B>Ghost Sighting!</B>
<BR><B>dutchhenry4@msn.com</B>

<P><B>Hi,</B>
<BR><B>My name is Mitch and I have a ghost sighting to report. My sighting
took place back in 1986. This is in Muskegon, Michigan. The house is located
on Giles Road(as if that is not weird enough). The house was originally
owned by the Giles's, whom the road was named after. I lived in this house
with 5 other people for about 8 months and in the time I was there we witnessed
many odd things. Lights that would slowly dim all the way down and then
slowly come all the way back to full bright. My room was upstairs next
to the bathroom. One night about 3am I heard what I thought to be the vacuum
cleaner running downstairs. A low hum that went on and on and on. The odd
thing was I was alone with one other person in the house that shared my
room. It being dark and the middle of the night, I assumed my friend was
having trouble sleeping and had decided to do some housekeeping. This was
not unusual. When I woke up in the morning, I was still hearing this noise.</B>
<BR><B>As I headed for the bathroom it seemed to be coming from there.
When I went in, a blow dryer was running full blast. Now, I heard this
kick on in the middle of the night. My friend was in bed still asleep and
never heard a thing.</B>
<BR><B>Now on to my sighting. It was about 12pm, broad daylight, and I
was moving out. I was carrying bags and boxes from a room on the main floor,
out to my car. My friend was also moving out and was in the room packing
stuff as I was hauling it. On one of my last trips, I came back into the
house, headed for the room my friend was in, when down the hall, in the
kitchen something caught my attention. It happened so fast I missed it
at first. For some reason I thought I saw my friend in the kitchen, and
said "Hey, what are you doing out there" as I walked into the room we had
both been working in. Then</B>
<BR><B>I walked the rest fo the way into the room and saw my friend standing
there, right where I had left him. At that moment I stopped dead in my
tracks.</B>
<BR><B>While I was processing the information in my brain about what I
had just seen, My friend said "What is wrong with you". He knew I had seen
something as he said he watched me turn as white as a sheet. As my mind
caught up to me, I realized what I had seen, and heard. At the kitchen
sink, I saw and old woman in a black dress, washing a tea cup, and singing
to herself. She didn't seem to notice me, but I know I saw and heard her.
I told my friend what I had seen, we made a couple of quick trips back
and forth to the car, and left for good. About 10 years later, another
friend was talking about this house in Muskegon and how a friend of his
had been there, and witnessed something similar. This made it real for
me as I had never mentioned my sighting to anyone except my friend who
was there at the time, and my wife years later. I always said that I would
believe something like that when I saw it and not until. Well, I saw it
and I believe. Since that time I have had two other "experiences" but they
are too personal for me to mention. I guess I am more receptive toward
ghosts after my first sighting. All I know for sure is that it really happened
and after checking out your site, I felt it was time to share this event.
Thanks and keep up the good work,</B>

some stories from others who want to share experiences. I'm 16 years old,
but don't let that put you off, its not a prank.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was 11 my nanny died. She was very close to
me and my other cousins. I can't remember how long it was exactly after
her funeral, but my mum had gone out for the night and wasn't going to
be home until very late.</B>
<BR><B>I woke up during the night and rolled over in my bed and saw an
adult figure standing there. It wasn't just black, and it was defined clearly.
But for some reason I immediately thought it was my mum coming to see if
I was asleep. I simply said, 'hi mum', and rolled over, my back facing
the figure and went to sleep. The next morning I was wandering why my mum
was there since she had never done it before. I asked my mum why she was
in my room last night and she plainly said that she wasn't. We joked that
perhaps it was my nan making sure that I was alright and I left it at that.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; A few months later I was at my cousin's house, all
my cousins are in their 30s. And my mum told her of what I saw, and my
cousin said that when her sister had come round with her two children,
the younger one, Georgia who was about 2 at the time and had never met
my nan, went upstairs to find a game from the closet. She came back down,
and asked my cousin why there was an old lady in her closet. They jokingly
asked what she looked like and she described my nan wearing a flowery top
and a purple skirt with a walking stick, curly white hair and big glasses
smiling.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Since Georgia had never seen my nan before we couldn't see&nbsp;
how she could make it up. I now believe that my nan did come and visit
all her grandchildren, who, as i have said before she was very of, for
the last time to make sure we were fine and well.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our family has had many ghost sitings as we have
a very old tudor mansion in our family. Also I have experienced another

<BR><B>Me and my 5 other friends was renting a house. One day there came
a girl to me and asks if she could move in with us, and we said yes. We
took her to the room, witch was empty. When she walked in, suddenly she
dropped a book, and I bended down to pick it up, and at that moment I heard
a growling voice above me. Something told me not to look up. I went out
of the room bended downwards. I began crying sitting with my Boyfriend,
I told him about this voice and so he went to take a closer look, and he
came out screaming, running out to the front yard. He ask me what that
was, and I did not have any clue. That night we did not close an eye. But
the new girl did not see anything, so she slept in that room. It was about
3am and she came out also screaming out of the room. I came out of my bedroom
and this huge black face with bloody mouth came flying towards me, it had
no legs, it was so fast we could not run, suddenly when it came in front
of me it disappeared. The next day my Boyfriend went out to look for another
place. we moved out in the same week. Until now I've got no idea what that
was!!!</B>

<BR><B>Haunted Aztec Site?</B>
<BR><B>technodude242002@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>I grew up in a family that believes in the supernatural but I'd never
experienced anything personally.&nbsp; After reading many of the stories
on this site I began to recall the details of an incident that happened
while vacationing in Mexico. I was about 8 or</B>
<BR><B>9 years old at the time (26 now) and our family (including some
cousins) went to visit the ancient Aztec pyramids near Mexico City. I climbed
the larger structure then decided to explore the rest of the ruins with
my cousin who is a year younger than I.&nbsp; We ran off away from the
rest of our family group and came upon a small temple that was almost at
ground level.&nbsp; In order to access the entrance to this temple you
had to climb/jump down into a pit and then walk into the structure.&nbsp;
I tried to discern what might be beyond the opening but all I could make
out was pitch darkness. I insisted we (my cousin and I) should jump down
(about 8 ft) and go into the structure. My cousin stated he was scared
so I decided to go in alone.&nbsp; I was just about to jump into the pit
when I heard someone behind me yell in Spanish "stop, don't go in there
it's not safe!." I quickly turned around to see a woman all in black. She
looked very pale and wore a large black hat on her head.&nbsp; She looked
at me with such intensity that I averted her gaze and ran off. My cousin
did the same. I hadn't run more than a few feet when I glanced back and
she had vanished. All around us expect for the temple was open space, there
was nowhere she could have gone to so quickly.&nbsp; I kept running. I
asked my cousin (as he was supposed to be on watch for adults) where this
woman had come from and he stated she had just appeared out of nowhere
from behind him.&nbsp; We of course told our parents but they were more
concerned with the fact that we had gone out exploring without permission.
I still wonder about who or what this person was.</B>

<BR><B>My Bedroom</B>

<P><B>HI, I am writing again. Ever since around 7-9 years of age I haven't
experienced any ghost problems, until now. I am 12 now so it's been about
3 years since my last encounter. Well anyway, my room is haunted, I mean
extremely haunted. This is the first start of it.</B>
<BR><B>I was in my room laying on my bed home alone talking to my best
friend, Stephanie on the phone. My fan that is on my ceiling was broken,
so I never ever have it on. It is not triggered by the light switch either.
Well I was talking to her and all of the sudden my fan started to move.
I was surprised because it normally makes a loud noise because it was broke.
Then Stephanie asked "what's that awful noise", but I could not hear anything.
Then I heard this noise like knifes clinging together. It was the fan.
I was so freaked out I jumped up turned off the fan and ran outside with
the phone. I talked to Stephanie outside until my parents got home. My
second experience has to do with my karaoke machine. I was in my room quietly
doing my homework with my karaoke off and all of the sudden I heard music.
A beautiful, but eerie music. I turned around to see what was going on
and I saw that my karaoke was on. I thought "that's weird". So I thought
I had a CD in there because my karaoke doesn't have a cassette or radio
player just a CD player. I looked and no CD was in there. I checked to
see if the microphone was off and it was so it was not picking up any other
karaoke's around, but when I went to turn the karaoke off the music turned
off, but it was still on just no sound. I hurried up and turned off my
karaoke and ran and told my parents, but of course they didn't believe
me. I started crying and they said I probably brought up a demon or something
because I always read ghost stories and witchcraft books. My third story
is that I had a friend over and we were talking about ghosts. We went out
of my room to get a snack. I went back to the room by myself to get the
phone. It was all dark in my room because the light was off. I screamed.
In the corner of my room there was this red and black smoke. When my dad
and friend came to the door to see what was wrong the smoke stuff had vanished.
Now that was scary. My fourth story is when I was with another friend,
Kemra. We were at my house alone. We were calling people and just doing
what girls do at sleepovers. I was sitting on my couch, and Kemra came
out of the bathroom and was walking towards me and fell like she was pushed.
There was no way of faking this fall. She got up and didn't know what happened
then she felt a cold hand going up her shirt by her cleavage. I thought
she was joking, but she looked different. She looked terrified, we ran
to the phone to call someone to get over it. It soon went away after we
started telling, J.J. about what happened. My house it haunted. My room
is the most haunted. I refuse to sleep in there unless I am with a friend.
This is scary and it keeps going on I don't know what'll happen next. Thanks
for listening about my haunted house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a demon?</B>

<BR><B>Ghost Story</B>
<BR><B>topper31948@ncol.net</B>

<P><B>Here’s a little story for you...</B>
<BR><B>Around 2 years ago my daughter and I were headed towards town from
my house. On the way there's a small family cemetery. As we drove past
my daughter looked at me and asked if I had seen what she just saw.. I
said, was it a little man dressed in a tux with a top hat sitting on top
of the headstone? She said yes. I said Yep, I saw the same thing. He looked
like a little midget. I still get chills when I think about that.</B>

<BR><B>My English Ghost</B>
<BR><B>liza@spectrum-soft.com</B>

<P><B>This is one of my ghost encounters. There have been several over
the years. The first one I can recall happened when I was five. They became
more frequent as I got older and also more frightening. I have seen ghosts
in several countries, not just in the U.S.A. In my travels to Australia,
Norway, and U.K., I felt, heard, or saw ghosts.</B>

<P><B>The story below is absolutely true. I have never forgotten what happened.
Many people I told the story to do not believe me, but I know what I saw
and it still bothers me up to this day. I always planned to go back and
stay at the same place and see if my ghost shows up again.</B>

<P><B>During my twenties, I visited the U.K. I joined a tour group that
went all over England, Scotland, and Wales. On the day before the tour
ended, we stayed in the town of Warwickshire. (Spelling?) The place we
stayed at was a manor house on an estate that had been converted into a
hotel. (Out of respect for the current owners, I will not name the hotel.)
The place was just beautiful. There were gardens all over, a stream ran
through the property and it even had it’s own church and graveyard for
the original family plots.</B>

<P><B>The house itself was exactly the way I expected an English manor
house to look. There were high ceilings with intricate carving, and heavy,
wood, double doors opening to large rooms. Huge fireplaces were in several
of the rooms and one that may have been made of marble. Chandeliers lined
the grand staircase and oriental carpets covered floors. The dining room
looked big enough to be a ballroom. I am sure they used it as such when
weddings were held there.</B>

<P><B>The place had been converted at one time to a hospital during the
First World War and maybe the second. It had only been a hotel for about
ten years when I stayed there. Our tour group stayed there one night only,
unfortunately, but one night was all it took to convince me the place was
haunted. After dinner, two of my new friends from the tour group and I
explored a little of the outside. We didn’t stay long since it was already
dark and hard to see. We joined our tour director (TD) who was in the sitting
room, located next to the bar. He was with another TD who was also staying
for just one night with his group. One of my friends and our TD went to
the bar to get some drinks. The other friend and I started talking to the
second TD about his tour. Somehow the conversation steered its way to ghosts.</B>

<P><B>Either she or I said there must be a ghost here since England is
know to be a ghost magnet. This TD said there was a ghost at this hotel.
My friend and I looked at each other than at him and asked if it that was
true. He said yes, but we both saw a small grin forming and knew he was
just trying to scare us. Just then, we saw one of the hotel employees propping
open the door that separated the sitting room and bar. While he was trying
to get the door to stay open, we asked him if the hotel was haunted.</B>

<P><B>The young man looked at us and said yes, of course it was, but he
wasn t smiling at all. He himself had never seen the ghosts, but there
were so many stories from other hotel employees and guests that he believed
there were some, sight unseen. He told us the following story.</B>

<P><B>About three weeks earlier, there was a business convention held at
the hotel. One man, who attended, showed up a day late. A day and a half
after he arrived, he went to the hotel manager with a complaint. He asked
the manager, to please tell the female employee who wears the old fashion
clothing, to stop following him. I guess he was thinking ‘Fatal Attraction’
behavior. He said she was always nearby. When he checked in, she was in
the registration area, looking at him. During meals, he saw her by his
table. Whenever he left his room, she would be just down the hall from
his room, watching. Even during the meetings, he would see her in the hall
looking at him. He wasn’t flattered by her attention.</B>

<P><B>The manager calmly told the man they didn’t employ anyone, man or
woman, to wear old fashion clothes. The man looked at him and said, “You
mean she is a ghost?” The manager didn’t say yes or no, but one hour later,
the man checked out.</B>

<P><B>My friend and I found the story to be very interesting, but since
we hadn’t seen anyone dressed in old fashion clothes since we arrived,
we didn’t think she would appear to us.</B>
<BR><B>We stayed up talking until 2:30 am and then I excused myself to
return to my room. As tired as I was, I decided to take a shower. Both
the TD’s were smoking cigars and my clothes and hair reeked of the smell.
I just couldn’t sleep smelling that way.</B>

<P><B>Now my room was located in the new section that was added on to the
original house. The dining rooms and meeting rooms and registration were
all in the house part, as were the large room suites, but our tour group
was placed in the additions. So you have to pass two, long hallways, go
down a flight of stairs, go down another hallway and pass through some
double doors, up another small flight of stairs, before reaching the rooms.
It was very easy to get lost.</B>

<P><B>Also, there was some construction outside as they were building a
new wing and tennis courts. The windows in all our rooms were locked. They
kept it that way so none of the debris from the outside could get in. When
I was in the shower, I noticed that the shower curtain kept flapping around
as though blown by a breeze. That couldn’t be since the windows and door
were closed. After getting out of the shower, I placed my shampoo and conditioner
bottles on top of the toilet tank. The shampoo was on the left and conditioner
on the right, both against the wall. I turned to face the sink and mirror
and was drying my hair. The toilet was now at my right and the shower behind
me.</B>

<P><B>With the towel covering my face, I heard a loud crash on my right.
I turned to find the conditioner bottle on the floor directly to the right
of the toilet. I was so startled by the noise, but I picked up the bottle
and placed it back on the toilet tank. I looked at it a second thinking
it was a little weird, but turned back again to finish drying my hair.
Not more than five seconds later, Boom! Another crash. I turned back to
the toilet to find the shampoo bottle on the floor directly to the left
of the toilet.</B>

<P><B>Now this was weird. I picked up the bottle and looked at it a long
while and at the conditioner bottle still on the tank. I had not heard
either of then slide off the tank. The two bottles were placed at the center
of the tank and leaning against the wall. I should have heard them slide
off if that’s what happened. It sounded more like some hitting the bottles
of the tank or lifting them up and dropping them. I looked at both bottles
again. They were about two thirds full and weighed close to a 12 ounces
each.&nbsp; The toilet tank top was pretty level and I was beginning to
doubt now that any bottle would slide off unless they were placed right
at the edge, which these weren’t. I placed the shampoo bottle back again
on the tank and stared at both bottles for over a minute. I guess I was
waiting for one or both bottles to fall again, but neither did.</B>

<P><B>When I turned back to the mirror and sink, I placed the towel I had
used to dry my hair on the counter. With the exception of a small section
at one end, approximately 3 to 4 inches long that hung over the counter,
the average sized, bath towel was about 95% on top of the counter. I started
to brush my teeth when I saw the towel slide off the counter to the floor.
This time I just froze too scared to move.</B>

<P><B>There was no way that towel could have fallen. Unless there was a
heavy weight attached to one end, almost all of it was on the counter.
And it was a full size, wet bath towel, not a small hand or face towel.
I was really nervous now. I remembered my aunt saying you could actually
talk to ghosts, so scared silly as I was, I gave it a try. I told whomever
or what ever did these things to please stop. It was almost 3:30 am and
I was really tired and scared. Please, stop because you have scared me
enough.</B>

<P><B>I still couldn’t sleep that night. I got maybe thirty minutes sleep
total. The next morning, I went back into the bathroom and saw that I had
left the two bottles on the toilet tank. Neither fell off again after I
tried talking to the ghost. I left the room a short while later with my
camera. It was still early and breakfast wouldn’t be ready for 30 to 40
minutes so I decided to take some pictures of the main house. I snapped
up shots of the registration area, the sitting room, the hallways and the
grand staircase.</B>

<P><B>When I got home, I looked over my shots and saw on the picture of
the staircase what looks to be part of a shadowy figure halfway up the
stairs. When I say part, I mean only the lower part was visible. It looked
to be the lower section of a dress or gown. Anything above the knee or
thigh area was missing.&nbsp; Again I have showed this picture to several
people, some say it is nothing but shadows, but some have said it does
resemble the bottom of a long skirt.</B>

<P><B>I really hope I can visit this hotel again some day and see my ghost
once more. Maybe next time I won’t be so scared, but I cannot guarantee
it. Just thinking about what happened and I am scared all over again.</B>

<BR><B>maryashleystokes@msn.com</B>

<P><B>I taught 2nd grade at St. Clement Mary Hofbauer School in Rosedale
MD.&nbsp; I was in school two weeks before it started. I had been cleaning
my room and getting ready for the year.&nbsp; It was around 5:00 and everyone
had left.&nbsp; There was a lot of squeaking of the wooden floor ( that
had been covered by a carpet) but when from behind, I heard the sound of
the metal handle hitting the side of the bucket (which I had left on the
desk) I got scared.&nbsp; So I turned to where the bucket was and said
out loud.&nbsp; I am almost finished and I am planning on leaving as soon
as I clean up. You have really scared me but, if you leave me alone and
let me finish I will leave.&nbsp; All the noises stopped.&nbsp; So I finished
what I was doing and picked up my key and walked down the hallway to put
away a machine that I had been using.&nbsp; I used my key to open the door
of the closet and then used it to lock the closet.&nbsp; When I got to
the doorway of my classroom I felt strange pressure on my thumb.&nbsp;
It was my key. It was bending and pushing upward towards my thumb.&nbsp;
I was startled and pushed with my thumb down on the key.&nbsp; It bent
back just like butter.&nbsp; All I wanted to do was leave the building.&nbsp;
I tried to use my key to open the door to leave but it wouldn't work because
it was still bent. Fortunately the door had not been bolted to the floor
so I was able to push the door open to leave.&nbsp; I taught there for
several more years with no other incidents.&nbsp; But, I never stayed there
by myself anymore.</B>

<BR><B>GHOSTLY VISIT FROM DAD</B>
<BR><B>Dianamaws@aol.com</B>

<P><B>When I was 9 years old my father passed away, it was the first time
I had ever heard the word death. Although it was hard for me to deal with,
I never dreamed that I would have a ghostly experience of my dad. I was
asleep one night after he had been burried, when all of a sudden, I was
awakened by the weight of someone in the middle of the bed. I was very
scared. I then felt the covers being pulled off of me slowly. I slid my
hand down slowly under the covers and pulled them back, when it happened
again. Just then I barely opened my eyes as to peak out of them ,when I
saw my dad on his knees beside me, looking down at me ,with a scarry look
on his face, as if he was going to take me with him. He had asked my mother,
if he could have myself, and my younger sister, when they had separated
prior to his death. He had left my mother to raise 7 children alone by
herself. Which she did very nicely, I might add. After seeing my father
looking down at me, I tried to scream for my mother, but all that would
came out was a harsh whisper. I then looked back at him ,and he then moved
one of his knees back and the other one next to it ,and he then started
to fade into the darkness of the room. Just then a cloud of smoke went
floating out the window. I laid there scared , and quiet in the night,
for what seemed to be an eternity. I finally got up the nerve to get out
of the bed, and get into bed with my mom. It took me forever to go to sleep,
Later I told my mom what had happened. She naturally thought, that I was
dreaming. Believe you me, the last thing that I was doing is that. I ended
up having another visit from my dad. Not only, did I have them, but my
mother, and my younger sister had them too. Believe me, when I say, that
never again ,did they doubt what had happened to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<BR><B>Ghosts in England</B>
<BR><B>doogy300@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>Hello my name is Adam.&nbsp; I have had strange happening in the
past.</B>

<P><B>When I was about 10 or 12 or about that I lived in England.&nbsp;
Once I went exploring with friends.&nbsp; While exploring we found a huge
mansion all borded up with a fence around it.&nbsp; Well, that fence was
easy to get past.&nbsp; I had volunteered to go to that house with somebody
else.&nbsp; The others stayed behind the fence.</B>

<P><B>Well, what happened was that this `friend` said to wait there he
would go around the back of the house.&nbsp; It turned out that he betrayed
me!&nbsp; He scaled the fence and ran, the others following.&nbsp; I was
scared so badly that my heart had probably turned white.</B>
<BR><B>I was over that fence before you could say "Jack Robinson".&nbsp;
I was crying, and running (there was a large field in front of the house),
and while I was, I heard banging behind me.&nbsp; I ran like hell out of
there.</B>

<P><B>Another time was just before I moved to America.&nbsp; I was at a
playground, it was about 8 or 9 PM and I was with a friend.&nbsp; Now,
the playground is next to a slightly steep incline that led to some woods.&nbsp;
In the middle of the woods there was a swamp.&nbsp; Anyway, I was escorting
my friend back to his house, and we heard something coming from the incline.&nbsp;
It was grass rustling and also what sounded like a gun cocking.&nbsp; My
friend said "Oh, damn.&nbsp; I'd better get going."&nbsp; But before he
did, we saw a ghostly white apparition rising from the hill.&nbsp; About
a second later, my friend was at his house and I was at mine (well, it
probably wasn't a second, but it was quick).</B>

<P><B>Perhaps these events have something to do with the (un)dead?</B>

take something back to her mom's room. Her Grandma was sleeping I didn't
want to wake her, so I went as quietly as I could. When I put the item
down, something big ran from the sink all the way to the bathtub. I didn't
scream, but I ran back to my friends room. I told her what happened, and
she went and checked, but nothing else happened. She had told me then about

<BR><B>Give it Back</B>
<BR><B>SkyBaby0001@aol.com</B>

<P><B>When I was 11, I had just fallen asleep. I woke up to an chilling
voice. This voice said to me firmly: "Give it back!"</B>
<BR><B>I originally have my head covered while sleeping so, after hearing
this sound, I uncovered my head and standing in my doorway of my bedroom
was a white image. To me it looked like an elderly woman but I couldn't
be sure.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway,&nbsp; she was demanding over and over for me to "Give it
back!" I didn't understand this. I became very frightened. I started to
shake and eventually bursted into tears. I called for my mother. She came
running in. I told her what was wrong and she thought it was a dream. She
laid in bed with me and when she and I started falling asleep, she heard
the voice &amp; saw the image too. She held me because I think she was
a little more scared than I was. She told me to go to sleep and eventually
the woman went away. The next morning we looked around for something we
thought should be of ancestral history. My mother &amp; father had taken
2 owl plaques from an old house, that was a funeral home as well, the day
before. My mother took them back. Nothing ever happened again. That was
the only ghost I have ever seen. I hope it will be the last.</B>

for a long time. He lived with my grandparents ( before he died)&nbsp;
after his wife died a few years eariler. I would always go in his room
and sit after he died. One day when i was at my grandparent's house a couple
of years after, and i saw him. I had went to the kitchen and when i came
back he was sitting on the bed...... just smiling at me. At first i thought
i was just going crazy because i missed him so bad so that it might have
made me see him. I was in shock for a long time. I didn't know what to
do! Finally he just disappeared..... to this day i am still scared to go
in that room by myself...... even though he was only saying good bye because

moved into his home cause everyone else was too scared to.&nbsp; Before
my grandpa passed away&nbsp; he asked us to take care of his home. He was
the most sweetest, honest man and wouldn't hurt a fly. My wife and my two
children moved in and at first I was a little scared.&nbsp; My grandfather
passed away in his home in a room that is now our bedroom.&nbsp; Since
we have lived here, there has been no sightings or strange occurrences,
until the last couple of months.</B>
<BR><B>We will be moving to a new house and we are not to sure who will
be moving in.&nbsp; Lately, my wife and I have seen a figure, when we are
either watching T.V. or just sitting around reading the paper.&nbsp; We
can't make out the figure but also there are cold spots around the house.
My wife tells me it may be my grandfather, she says he may just be coming
around cause he's concerned as to who may be taking over the home.&nbsp;
My grandpa loved his house and he worked very hard to keep his home clean
and up and running.&nbsp; I guess he may just be a little worried that
strangers may be moving in and won't appreciate and take care of it like
a family member would.</B>

Crying children aren't the only things going on at that campus. I attended
school there for a couple of years before graduating and there were many
stories that I heard from staff and students alike.</B>
<BR><B>One was in the dorm called OK Hall. A student came in to the boys
bathroom by himself one day to see an old man with long hair hanging from
a rope. He went to report it to one of the residential advisors and they
went to investigate. When they got upstairs there was nothing there. A
similar sighting was reported later that week.</B>
<BR><B>One night a friend of mine and I were up talking and it was really
late. I remember hearing footsteps and children laughing in the room above
mine even though there was no one on the second floor. This happened at
2 in the morning and when my friend went upstairs to check it out, the
noises stopped when she got to the top of the steps. It was quiet for about
a half hour and then started up again.</B>
<BR><B>Also I once heard voices in my room as I was trying to fall asleep.
The first voice woke me up, it sounded like a man with a deep voice humming
in my ear, once awake I just listened to see if my mind was playing tricks

<BR><B>Haunting Situations</B>
<BR><B>Tempest78@aol.com</B>

<P><B>I have been in many haunting situations.&nbsp; Things just seem to
happen when i'm around.&nbsp; My friends house is no exception.&nbsp; My
friends' names are Jeremy and Jay.&nbsp; The exact history of the house
is uncertain, but as far as we know there was a murder-suicide shortly
after the house was first built.&nbsp; This occurred in the basement, and
that is where most of the activity is concentrated.&nbsp; My friends and
their family are quite used to it, and whenever I’m there we spend time
in the basement to see what will happen.&nbsp; I will just share a few
of the many odd things that have happened.&nbsp; The most memorable incident
took place a few months ago.&nbsp; After sitting in the basement for a
few minutes, we shut off the light, as we usually do, and spoke to the
spirit, inviting it to show its presence.&nbsp; Jeremy placed a guitar
in the center of the room and asked the ghost to play a few notes.&nbsp;
We waited while Jay took pictures with their digital camera.&nbsp; We heard
nothing, but when we looked at the pictures, there were white streaks all
over the guitar strings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pleased, we continued to be silent
and wait for the spirit to show us more.&nbsp; Jay took another picture,
and as the flash faded, I saw the spirit perfectly clear.&nbsp; Surprisingly,
he looked like Kurt Cobain (lead singer of Nirvana, now dead).&nbsp; he
had very messy light colored hair, deep set eyes that were covered in shadow
so i could not see them, he was skinny but muscular, and was wearing a
pair of ripped up jeans.&nbsp; I said nothing about seeing the figure,
until not five minutes later Jeremy saw the same figure walk thru a doorway
and out of sight.&nbsp; After that surprise, we turned the lights back
on, and the heavy lid of the guitar case which had been left open had shut
silently while the lights were off.&nbsp; We then went upstairs to my friends
bedroom and hung out for a while.&nbsp; While we were sitting on one of
the beds,&nbsp; I looked next to Jeremy and there was a large ring of smoke
hovering in one place.&nbsp; The window was open and there was a breeze
coming thru, yet the smoke ring didn't budge.&nbsp; After about a minute
or so it slowly dissipated and left.&nbsp; This wasn't really a surprise,
since its quite common to just have a puff of smoke blown in your face
out of nowhere in their house.&nbsp; These are just a few of the things
that have happened there, but I hope you were entertained by them.</B>

<BR><B>Haunts from Chatsworth, CA</B>
<BR><B>greyshield2003@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>Chatsworth, CA is known for its role as an "equestrian community",
and has its roots deep in local San Fernando Valley history. Discovered
at first by Padre Serra and his small group from Mexico. It use to be a
stop for the Pony Express, and was the start of the "Stagecoach Trail"
that lead over the Santa Susana Mountains for people traveling from San
Fernando Mission to San Buenaventura Mission. There are several historical
places to see here and from what I have heard (and experienced) are haunted.</B>

<P><B>One of my own experiences occur regularly when I drive down a beautiful
stretch of road with several horse properties on one side and a cemetery
on the other. A mailman was murdered in cold blood while standing in front
of one of the house's mailboxes. As I drive by, a cold gust of wind enters
my car even though the windows are shut. Also, a feeling of heaviness that
increases as you approach, peaks at the mailbox itself, and then decrecendos
as you drive away.</B>

<P><B>My second experience was when my fiance and I recently toured the
local Hill/Palmer Homestead. It was one of the first homes to be built
by "Americans" during the pioneer days. I don't know if it was just me,
but the house had several cold spots. I know it may sound weird but I could
"feel the history" inside this house and it touched me deeply. From the
impression I got, Minnie Palmer (born and died in this house) felt happy
that her home could be shared with others.</B>

<P><B>One of the major haunts locally (although I have yet to get a chance
to explore this myself) is a large tunnel on the north west end of Chatsworth.
A large train accident happened on November 19, 1941. Several men parished...most
burned to death or were overcome by fumes in the tunnel. Along with the
people, there were 12 cars loaded with cattle that never saw daylight at
the other end. Locals say that forlorn mooing can be heard from inside
as well as screams from the dieing people. Some have reported smelling
smoke and the burned flesh of the cattle.</B>

<P><B>I hope these were interesting! Feel free to e-mail me back if you
have answers as to my experiences.</B>

<BR><B>SpclK530@aol.com</B>

<P><B>currently I am 17 years old and as long as I can remember I’ve had
a small psychic ability, (dreams that come true, knowing when the phone
would ring and who it was, waking up in the middle of the night when someone
in my family would die.) just some stuff like that. I have a couple of
stories to tell so here goes... my older brother is 5 years older than
me so when I was in middle school he was in high school... so you can say
that i "had connections" well my brother being the typical teenager told
me and my mother about a park I Annandale, VA. called round tree park (as
is in your haunted places part of this website) but this was before it
was in here... so my mom being all into this stuff said that we could go
one night, even though the park closes at night.&nbsp; well to make things
safe we went during the day to get a feel for the park before we would
go traumping around in the dark. so during the day when i was there i had
a very bad vibe about the whole thing I know this sounds dumb but the whole
damn park just looked creepy even during the day. there was alot of dead
trees and the birds just didnt seem to chirp like they did across the street...
well when we got there at night we walked down a path and it opened up
to a soccer field and there was woods all around it.&nbsp; (at the time
I was 14 so I learned the ghosts like to pick on kids going thru puberty
so I was an immediate target) sooo I picked up that there was a woman figure
and she some how died tragically and something about a baby well later
I found out that it was haunted by a woman who died a long time ago she
had a house on the property and by rumor killed her baby but I don’t know
if that’s true... but oh well so here we are walking around and I would
look into the woods and see "something" walk thru the trees and I swear
on my grandmothers grave it had horns... so I figured that the woman wasn’t
alone... so were walking in the soccer field and we get to the woods and
my brother goes in first and I didn’t go far my mom and brother just walked
off into the woods so here i was standing alone and froze by what i saw
next, what I saw was I don’t know if this makes much sense but in the movie
predator you could see through the alien well that’s what she looked like
only short and fat.&nbsp; so I’m standing there and my mom and brother
are just walking around totally oblivious to the whole thing and then she
started to walk towards me (my luck) and i was so scared i couldn’t scream
I just made a noise... well by the i was about to pee my pants because
she was in my face and I could smell this horrible smell it smelt like
rotting flesh well i bolted into the middle of the soccer field and my
mom and brother followed me . so here i am in the middle of the soccer
field screaming... and running around and i felt like she was following
my I felt this pressure on my back like she was right up on me. so i got
so freaked out I through up my big mac and my mom and brother were like
lets go.. they later told me that I was pale as a piece of paper. and that
you could see my heart pounding. well when we were home was kinda just
sat around and recapped the whole thing I still feel her presence in my
house and I went to the bathroom and i shut the door and I’m on the toilet
and i noticed that the door was like 4 inches open... but i clearly remember
shutting the door and there was nothing wrong with our door knob so when
i was done I ran out into the living room and yelled some choice words
at my brother about how he’s always playing jokes on me and how now wasn’t
a good time to mess with me. well my mother and my brother were just looking
at me like I was crazy well after like a half hour I felt her presence

<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have another story but on
a lighter note... my grandparents own a farm house and 197 acres in rural
pa so I always go up there for the summer and&nbsp; the house is about
250 years old and its been in our family for about 120 years sooo I have
had a great uncle who lived in the house before my grandparents bought
it. well he died in the living room and when my great grandmother was a
child in the house her twin brother died when he was 4 so when I go there
I feel so at ease and its so easy to sleep there (I’ve had a friend who
suffered from sleep apnea and insomnia and she slept fine there for the
first time in years) well I’ve never seen anything but I smell lavender
and my grandmother doesn’t have any lavender in her garden. so there’s
that and there is this light bulb that’s in the upstairs hall way and its
been working for 90 years I cant explain that. but I love that house and
whenever I’m there by myself I feel safe even during a thunderstorm and
the power goes out. I just always feel safe there, if I cold live there
I would. well that’s my stories i hope you enjoyed them if u have any advice

<BR><B>Medway’s “Holy” Land – A True Account</B>
<BR><B>osiris_154@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>As an amateur ghost hunter and enthusiast of all things paranormal,
I feel that the time is right to share my own experiences with a “haunted”
site in my home town of Medway, MA. Having read the description provided
on your site, I felt that I had to submit one that could really do it justice.
The site I am referring to is the Medway Holy Lands. Before I continue
with my account, I will swear on my life that the details of this account
are true and accurate to the best of my recollection…some of the events
having taken place several years earlier.</B>

<P><B>The true history of the Holy Land is this…almost 10 years ago construction
workers in the town of Medway were preparing a plot of land to be developed
for low-income housing. During the initial preparatory stages of the construction
project, a strange rock was uncovered by one of the workers. Clearly imprinted
on the stone was the face of Jesus Christ. This discovery caused quite
a stir in the local community and prompted a full fledged investigation
by the Vatican. The stone with the face of Christ was taken to</B>
<BR><B>Rome for examination and the condo project was never completed.</B>

<P><B>In months and years after the stone was discovered, the area where
the condos were to be built was turned into a religious shrine of sorts.
Here I must go on a tangent to describe the interesting history of the
condo site BEFORE the stone was ever discovered. It is important to note
that the site of the proposed condominiums was actually the site of a boy’s
camp which was closed, under dire circumstances, during the 1920s. As rumor
has it, a young boy drowned in the camp swimming pool and the camp was
closed forever.</B>
<BR><B>Remains of the boy’s camp can still be seen when one travels to
the site. However, the site underwent a dramatic change when the stone
was removed from grounds. When work first began at the old camp site, the
entrance to the boy’s camp was dominated by two large, square stone pillars
approximately ten feet in height. These pillars were massive. Yet when
the stone was removed from the site, both of the pillars were toppled over.
It is unclear how this occurred but there has been no evidence to date
that tools or machinery was used in their destruction.</B>

<P><B>The religious site, which came to be known as the Medway Holy Lands,
consists of three distinct areas. The first area that one enters after
passing the toppled pillars is a flat, meadow-like area that is dominated
by three giant (over 7 ft. tall) wooden crosses. These crosses are placed
strategically in the meadow to correspond with the signs of the cross.</B>
<BR><B>Directly in front of each of the wooden crosses are numerous candles,
offerings, and lawn chairs of the devout. When the site first opened to
the public, people would come to this meadow to pray and meditate and would
often sit in front of the crosses for hours on end. The visitors have departed
but their chairs still remain. The most chilling aspect of this part of
the site is the pictures. Stapled and nailed to each of the crosses are
hundreds of pictures of people, both living and deceased, who were somehow
connected to the site. When I first visited the site I could not believe
the overwhelming number of pictures that were present. However, upon visiting
the site recently I noticed something very disturbing…all of the pictures
had undergone a stunning transformation. Bodies and other features in the
pictures were still clearly visible…but there was only white empty space
where the faces had been.</B>

<P><B>Moving deeper into the site, one comes to another clearing where
the site of the old swimming pool and showers used to be. Although the
pool was filled in after the camp closed, one can still see the shower
stalls and piping of the pool house. Whenever I have visited this part
of the site I do not like to linger. I always sense an overwhelmingly evil
presence in this part of the grounds. On the right side of the clearing
is one of the most interesting parts of the site…deep in the woods, about
twenty feet or so in from the clearing and barely visible to the casual
observer, is an old car (not exactly sure what type but it has the characteristic
tail fins of the 1960s), half submerged into a swamp. The back window of
the car has been shattered and offerings have been left behind. Mostly
rosary beads and flowers…FRESH flowers.</B>

<P><B>On the opposite side of the clearing is perhaps the scariest part
of the site…a place that is just as scary during the day as it is during
the night. This part of the site can be reached by a meandering path which
winds through tall grass and underbrush into the forest. On more than one
occasion, visitors to the site have witnessed the Virgin Mary walking down
the path, her head bowed down. Although I am not a religious person by
any means, I know for a fact that the Virgin Mary or any other religious
personality would stay as far away as possible from this evil place. The
place to which I am referring, which my friends and I have come to know
as the Pine Grotto, is an enormous “room” made out of two ancient white
pine trees which have grown together to form a natural cathedral roof of
sorts. All plants on the outskirts of the Grotto are dead and no birds
or animals are present. Even in the middle of the summer it impossible
to hear birds or animals within 100 ft of the Grotto area. The area surrounding
the Grotto is a complete dead zone. The Pine Grotto itself is filled with
crosses…there are crosses on the ground, crosses in the branches and crosses
nailed to the trees. Some of these crosses are hand-made and look like
something out of “The Blair Witch Project”. A large crucifix dominates
one of the trees and the figure of Christ has a red substance on his hands
and feet which could only have been real blood. Each time that I have dared
to venture into the Pine Grotto (I’ve dared to enter during the day and
night), I have been overcome with feelings of pure terror. For such a venerated
holy site, the Pine Grotto emanates pure, unadulterated evil. One on occasion
when I went into the Grotto with two of my friends it began to downpour.
Yet immediately after we left the Grotto the sun was shining.</B>

<P><B>After leaving the Pine Grotto and walking several hundred feet down
the trail, one comes to the third and final part of the Holy Lands site.
This area of the site is dominated by a large stream which cuts the area
in half. On one side of the stream is a large hill with three giant crosses
on the top. These crosses are significantly larger than the previous three
crosses and all have large railroad spikes nailed into them where a person’s
hands and feet would be. Prayers and rosaries are draped over the crosses
at this, America’s version of Golgotha, the site of the Crucifixion. Make-shift
crosses can be found in almost all of the trees on the hill as well as
several crosses which have been fashioned out of logs. Although people
have since forgotten about the Holy Land site, every time that I have visited
the hill I have discovered lit candles. Every time.</B>

<P><B>On the opposite side of the steam, the side closest to the trail,
is a grotto with the Virgin Mary. At the feet of the Virgin are flowers,
both real and artificial, as well as candles and other offerings. Like
the candles that were left on the hill, the candles at this grotto are
always lit. I have no idea who is replacing these candles but they have
been doing it for years and have shown no signs of stopping.</B>

<P><B>And now, my scariest experience at the Holy Lands site. Two years
ago on Halloween night (which also happens to be my birthday), several
friends and I decided to make the long and scary journey through the woods
to the abandoned Holy Lands site. Wanting to get a good scare we decided
to make the trip without any flashlights. When we made it past the toppled
stone pillars to the first part of the site we stopped dead in our tracks.
There before us in the moonlit clearing were three figures, clothed entirely
in black. They were sitting in front of the central cross and were chanting.
Two of the figures held candles while all three prayed or chanted in a
monotonous voice. Although we couldn’t hear what they were saying, we did
not want to run away for fear that our noisy trek through the woods would
attract their attention…or the attention of others whom we had not seen.
There was nothing for us to do but wait and watch. After several tense
minutes of watching the cloaked figures, we decided to take our chances
and make our escape. We ran blindly down the path and into the woods, not
knowing if we were being pursued. When we finally reached a distance that
we deemed safe, we made sure that everyone in the group was accounted for
and then left the woods. We returned to the site later in the evening,
although why I’ll never know, to discover that the black hooded figures
had departed. There was no evidence to prove that they had been there although
all of the candles at the site had been lit. While we examined the site,
I could swear on my very life that I heard voices on all sides of the clearing.
I also felt a strong evil presence that night…someone or something was
telling us that we should leave the site. That was the last time that I
went to the Holy Lands and I have not dared return. I leave it up to you
to decide what it was that my friends and I saw there that night. Were
they Satanists taking part in some occult ritual? Or were they Wicca or
practitioners of some older, darker religion? I guess we’ll never know.</B>

<BR><B>Hypnogogic Experience?</B>
<BR><B>Rosieb6@aol.com</B>

<P><B>Hi -</B>
<BR><B>This is my daughter's email address.&nbsp; She was frightening herself
with ghost stories, and came across your section on sleep paralysis.&nbsp;
For years I kept the following experience to myself, thinking that it meant
that I was nuts.&nbsp; Finally, I told it to a doctor, who described it
as "hypnogogic", and not a sign of psychosis - after twenty years, that
was a great relief!</B>

<P><B>I was 20 years old and living in a hot tiny room in my first shared
apartment during summer break.&nbsp; I was working two jobs - one full-time
during the week, and one for 12 hours each Saturday and Sunday.&nbsp; I
was very worried about making enough to pay for the next year's fees.&nbsp;
Also, I had been stalked while walking home one Sunday evening; when the
gentleman following me disappeared from view, I had gone to the middle
of the street, spotted him looking at me from behind some bushes, and run
screaming for help.</B>

<P><B>One night I awakened to the vision of a backpacker in a Tyrolean
hat leaning over my bed.&nbsp; He was a white guy, tallish, slender with
a narrow face and pleasant features, young, with straight black hair and
bangs.&nbsp; He could not have seemed more earnest, but he was also very
calm, self-assured and confident.&nbsp; When he had my attention, he enunciated
very clearly the words,</B>
<BR><B>"It's going to be all right."</B>

<P><B>Sure, I thought, sure.&nbsp; How was it going to be all right when
there was a bleeping apparition standing by my bleeping bed?&nbsp; Had
I slipped my last gears?</B>

<P><B>But this guy seemed to have his act together.&nbsp; He knew that
I didn't believe him or in him, so he tried again, "Really.&nbsp; Trust
me.&nbsp; It's….going….to…..be….all…right."&nbsp; He was fit, he was young,
he was handsome, he was making a special trip just to tell me this, and
he seemed completely sure of himself.&nbsp; I nodded, and went back to
sleep.</B>

<P><B>That's my story, and the whole thing seemed very real.&nbsp; I do
remember, however, that I did not move at all while this was happening,
just lay there and stared, so I guess sleep paralysis is as good a diagnosis
as any.</B>

<P><B>By the way, the guy in the vision was right; even though I was forced
to drop out of school, I got a job at the university, saved the necessary
money, and graduated a year late with a 3.3 GPA.&nbsp; And now I have a
gorgeous adolescent daughter who researches my neuroses on the internet
- how could it get any better than that?</B>

<P><B>Hope this was interesting to you; again, thanks for your site, which
is the the first place I have ever seen such things discussed.</B>

<P><B>Haunted apartment In Honolulu, HI</B>
<BR><B>kaleilei56@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>I moved into my apartment in October of 2002.&nbsp; When I first
moved in I didn't think about it being haunted. My husband is gone a lot
and I thought the feelings I was getting, was me not liking to be alone.&nbsp;
But I am not the only one who's felt the way I do about our apartment.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; It first started about the second or third day we moved
in.&nbsp; In my bedroom I would get this very uncomfortable feeling and
that someone was watching me.&nbsp; That continues to this day! Knocking
would be heard on the living room walls that connects with my closet.&nbsp;
It would be heard from 2 to 4 clock in the morning, knowing this was not
my friends or neighbors.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The first real thing that happened was in January I was getting
ready to take a trip to California.&nbsp; I was desperately looking for
a pair of my shoes.&nbsp; I looked every where, it almost made me late!&nbsp;
I gave up and went on my way.&nbsp; Some friends of mine that live under
me were watching the apartment and I didn't tell about the apartment being
haunted.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well when I returned home we happened to start talking
about their ghost they have.&nbsp; We call him Adam.&nbsp; I then told
them that I thought my apartment was haunted.&nbsp; And my friends began
to tell me that several times they were in the apartment.&nbsp; They got
this horrible feeling that just came over them.&nbsp; My friend Maghan
told me she just had to get out and get out right then and there.&nbsp;
Well I went home after my conversation with them.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was getting food out of my pantry which is acrossed
from my washer and dryer.&nbsp; There is two sliding doors that cover where
the washer and dryer sit.&nbsp; As I walked out of the pantry I watched
the door on the left completely close.&nbsp; I thought it could of been
the air from the pantry door.&nbsp; I tried it and the air wasn't strong
enough to cause it to close.&nbsp; And the door is broke and takes a lot
of force to make the door close.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; That freaked me out pretty bad. But I guess it was
the ghost's way of saying hi!&nbsp; The next day I went into my coat closet
and found the shoes that I had been looking for.&nbsp; They were not there
when I had left for my trip.&nbsp; Several days later my friend Maghan
was over and my phone rang.&nbsp; I had to go into my bedroom but found
the door locked.&nbsp; It does that all the time. So I opened it with a
credit card and got the phone.&nbsp; When I was done I went to go put the
phone back but the door was locked again.&nbsp; So i used my id and placed
it on the bed.&nbsp; I left the room and talked to my friend.&nbsp; She
left and I went to my room to go to bed.&nbsp; I went to get my id off
of the but it was gone!&nbsp; I searched everywhere and could not find
it.</B>
<BR><B>Well two days later while I was painting the living room I broke
two picture frames that were hanging on my wall.&nbsp; I set them on the
dining room table.&nbsp; And when I set them on the table i know there
was nothing under them. I went to pick them up again and my id was under
them.&nbsp; That same night, when I looked up from my work I saw a young
couple looking at my wall.&nbsp; They were making gestures like what is
she doing?&nbsp; I just turned my head and went about my buisness.&nbsp;
This wasn't the first time I've seen ghosts.&nbsp; My dog will sit in the
hallway and stare and watch something that is not there.&nbsp; I've also
seen my friends' ghost Adam.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; He's the one that has taken my things and hid them.
I guess you could say I have a sixth sense.&nbsp; I've also seen a white
man walking about the hallways of our apartment.&nbsp; I believe he might
be the one that is mean.&nbsp; He makes anyone feel horrible when they
come into contact with him.&nbsp; A&nbsp; week ago I was having a party
for my husband birthday.&nbsp; And a few people that were here knew a little
bit about the ghosts that live here. They told my friend Maghan that they
watched two candles lift off the top of my entertainment center and be
placed inside two cards.&nbsp; I went to find the candles but they are
also gone.&nbsp; But I refuse to give up my home just because of several
ghosts. And that is my story about my haunted apartment.</B>

<BR><B>Interesting events in workplace........</B>
<BR><B>Theowlcave@aol.com</B>

<P><B>Hello.........</B>
<BR><B>I've been working as a manager in a local retail establishment now
for a little over a year, and in that time have both experienced some odd
happenings and heard several reports from others.&nbsp; The most common
occurrence seems to be barely audible whispers, which seem to originate
at a point right behind the person hearing it.........and then soon after,
a touch, usually upon the shoulder. The whispers sometimes repeat the name
of the individual being whispered "at", but most often, it just seems to
be gibberish, or at least to faint to decipher. I have heard my name, on
several occasions, and have felt someone or something touch me upon the
back once. though it was more like a slight shove. Customers have reported
objects launching themselves off the shelves and barely missing them, and
several employees have stated that they have walked from a clean, nicely
arranged room, and upon returning, sometimes less than a minute later,
the area was littered with boxes, strewn about as if someone had decided
to clear the shelving by throwing it all in the floor. This has happened
at least 5 times. Other than the occurrences described above, employees
often hear footsteps (i know, sounds clich&eacute;) going up and down the
stairs to the upper level of the stockroom, and sometimes walking around
the upper level. Of course, upon checking, there never seems to be anyone
there. One more thing bears mention: A former employee says she was shoved
hard from behind...causing her to fall.</B>

<BR><B>Late Night in the Nursing Home</B>
<BR><B>Gcrls04@aol.com</B>

<P><B>I am 23 now, but I started working as a certified nurse aide when
I was 16.&nbsp; I have worked for the same nursing home facility for the
past almost 7 years.&nbsp; In this time, I have had many experiences with
the spirits of those I myself cared for and spirits of those who died before
I began working there.&nbsp; I grew up knowing that spirits and ghosts
existed, and I had been around some family members who had passed, so I
have not been afraid.&nbsp; However, I would like to share one of my most
memorable and important stories.&nbsp; It was when I first started working
there, I worked evenings after school and I got off work at 9 pm.&nbsp;
I was doing a quick set of rounds with another aide and I left my watch
on the sink in a resident's room.&nbsp; I went back in to get the watch
and there was a lady standing in the bathroom doorway.&nbsp; I had never
seen her before and I was a bit startled.&nbsp; She asked me if I had any
water.&nbsp; I told her I would get some.&nbsp; I left the room to get
her a glass of water and when I came back she was not there anymore.&nbsp;
I checked both of the rooms that adjoined through that bathroom and I did
not see her.&nbsp; I asked the nurse on duty if she knew of a woman like
that who lived there and she got a little shook up by it.&nbsp; She said
that she thought that was the ghost of the lady she had taken care of when
she first started there, 20 years ago!&nbsp; It got me intrigued so of
course I asked what had happened to her.&nbsp; The nurse told me that she
had been a very spry woman who was a joy to take care of and one day out
of the blue she became terribly ill.&nbsp; Then two days later she passed
on.&nbsp; It turned out her daughter was bringing in food from home and
had poisoned her so that she could collect the insurance money and whatever
was coming to her in the will.&nbsp; But the poor lady's spirit did not
want to leave the nursing home.&nbsp; At a later occasion I found out why.&nbsp;
I was working later than usual one night and I saw her behind me in a reflection
in a picture above a patient's bed.&nbsp; I turned around and I asked her
why she was still here.&nbsp; She said because all of her life this was
the only place she felt any love.&nbsp; It broke my heart, so I told her
she could stay as long as she wanted as long as she didn't cause any harm
to anyone.&nbsp; I would see her from time to time after that, and whenever
she was around it seemed she brought out a happy essence in everyone there.</B>

<BR><B>SndKnndy@aol.com</B>

<P><B>to most people reading this my story might sound unbelievable.</B>
<BR><B>when I was a child I was born 3 months early and was in hospital
regularly until o was 2. As soon as I could talk I told my mum my granddad
has visited me when I was really tiny and in a tent&nbsp; (they were the
words i used to describe intensive care unit) and said I was going home
to see mummy she said she knew but I said it was my other granddad who
had a tatoo of a naked woman on his arm. my mum was baffled and didn’t
know what I was on about. later she asked my granma and she said it was
her father (who died when my mum was 2). later that week my gran took me
to see her mother and made me explain to her what happened. my detail reduced
my great grandma to tears. it freaks me out because now I have vivid memories
of a dark haired standing over me. I don’t know how I still remember tiny
details of that day as i was very young when this happened but I just think
that he’s my guardian angle and has always looked out for me.</B>

<BR><B>Looks like a friend</B>
<BR><B>gvpm@lvcm.com</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I am about to tell you is very
true. Although I did not witness it first hand, I was assured by all of
the people who did, that it was 100% true.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was my best friend, Ashley,
who lived with her mom and 2 older brothers. Ashley's mom, we'll call her
Carol, knew all of her kid's friends and they lived in a somewhat comfortable
neighborhood so they always left the front door unlocked and told all of
the friends to just come in.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should also briefly explain the
way the house was set up. When you walked in the front door you walked
down 2 or 3 steps and you would be in the living room.&nbsp; To the left
was the hallway with all of the bedrooms. First was Ashley's. Then at the
end to the right was her brothers' room, straight ahead was the spare room,
and to the left was her parent's room. To the right when you walk in is
the kitchen with the door to the garage attached.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, everybody knew the house
was haunted. They were told that a teenage boy lived there with his mother
and that one day he got home and found her hanging in the garage. There
would be times that we would be sitting at the kitchen table and there
would all of a sudden be a breeze from the ceiling fan, but it wouldn't
be moving. They also had this ledge close to the ceiling that had plants
on it. Sometimes the leaves on the plants would start to sway as if it
were windy. But again, there would be nothing to cause the breeze.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scary incident was in about 1999.
Ashley was going to be moving to Utah with her mom so they were spending
time with family in the living room. Ashley was doing her hair with a friend
of ours in her mom's bedroom. Carol was in the living room with her oldest
daughter and another family member. That's when the front door opened and
a bald white male walked in and shut the door. He was wearing blue jean
shorts with a white tank top. He started to walk back towards the boys'
room without saying a word to anyone, went into the bedroom and slammed
(not oo hard)the door. Carol and the other 2 family members went back into
the room and nobody was there. The older sister had a 1 year old boy at
the time sleeping in the spare room and he did not wake up at.</B>

<BR><B>Many Ghosts</B>
<BR><B>achurch@mailbmc.co</B>

<P><B>I've been seeing ghosts, even back before I even knew what they were.
what I mean is, I had an "imaginary friend" at age 4. I realize that's
no unusual occurrence, but it is when the "friend" describes her history,
complete (and main focus) on her death. i didn't even know what death was
at 4. i remember things we talked about- mostly, her trying to get me to
have an intense interest in the color black, and to only play w/toys that
were black. i apparently drew a picture of her, too- for my mom. i don't
remember the picture, but i heard it was a terrifying picture of some sort
of witch. all black. it evidently freaked my mom out, hearing me talk to
this "thing" (called "aunt judy"), that she told me to tell her to go away.
w/out question, i did. that was seemingly the end.</B>
<BR><B>years later, we'd moved to my great grandmother's house after she
passed away. it was fairly "inactive" so far as ghosts are concerned, apart
from one incident. my mom woke me up for school- nothing new there- only,
she kept telling me not to move my legs. once i was a little more coherent,
i realized that under my bare legs was a picture normally hanging in my
room, the glass smashed. there's NO way this could have happened- if it
just fell, it would have landed on the bed w/no way to break. somehow it
did, and somehow i wasn't cut.</B>
<BR><B>the next house is the one w/multiple...individuals. from day one,
i felt uneasy there. i never wanted to be alone- for the simple reason
that once you were, one of the upstairs bedrooms would creak as though
there was a massive group walking around up there. and, playing music while
alone was definitely not advised- the walking turned to loud bangs.</B>
<BR><B>i woke up one night, only to see a figure of a woman in white, face
darkened and blurred, in my doorway. I couldn't even scream- nothing came
out but a squeak. i was frozen. i managed to find my TV remote, and I turned
it on (for light), and she vanished.&nbsp; in that same room, i had an
angel figurine on my bureau. for three morning in a row, i'd find the angel
face down, facing the wall, regardless of whether or not i replaced her
on her feet.</B>
<BR><B>also, in that room, i was sitting at my vanity, when, despite the
closed window, my window shade came towards me, as though I pulled on it,
hung there, and went back down.</B>
<BR><B>I’ve had nail polish fly across the room, I’ve had missing items
return in my direct view, usually in strange patterns- missing checkers
lined on the floor, red, black, red, black. i've seen two other spirits
there- an old man, crossing my path, in the darkened kitchen. that made
me angry- i was so tired of all the activity. i yelled at him. the next
one i saw terrified me. i was about to go upstairs, when, reaching for
the light, i saw a glowing figure of a small child seated at the top of
the stairs. that mere sight terrified me, almost as much as the first girl
in the doorway.</B>
<BR><B>I’ve had visions of things behind me- almost like seeing things
w/my mind's eye- i was crossing the threshold of the room (w/all the activity)
when I got this flash in my mind of something awful behind me. I felt this...presence
behind me, and I got a vision of some huge...thing filling the doorway.
I swung around gasping.</B>
<BR><B>the feeling of being watched was a constant as I headed upstairs.
and of course, upon turning around, nothing would be there.</B>
<BR><B>thanks for letting me share my stories. it seems that this is one
place that they won't freak anyone out!</B>

<BR><B>Marshall Pottery Haunting</B>
<BR><B>timmullins@mail2tim.com</B>

<P><B>I was checking out your haunting list for Texas, when I came across
Marshall, TX and was surprised to see Marshall Pottery on the list.&nbsp;
I am the warehouse supervisor for Marshall Pottery. I must admit, there
are quite a few strange things going on there.&nbsp; Alot of my employees
have come to me about hearing their names called out loud when they are
alone.&nbsp; I too have heard my name.&nbsp; Not one, not twice, but quite
often. Things have been thrown around or fallen to the ground in strange
ways and places.</B>
<BR><B>Here's the catch.&nbsp; I am a week-end investigator and have snapped
some shots in my warehouse at night while alone.&nbsp; I got some pics
you may be interested in seeing.&nbsp; Mist, orbs and dark figures.</B>
<BR><B>On your list it says Marshall Pottery, but it doesn't say which
plant.&nbsp; We have the newer plant on HWY 31 in Marshall which is where
my pics were taken and the old plant off of HWY 59 which is even more haunted
then the new plant.</B>
<BR><B>First of all, I've added and attachment.&nbsp; It's a picture I
took in the newer warehouse about a month ago.&nbsp; Once you look at it,
I think you'll notice right away why I sent it.</B>
<BR><B>Ok, stuff that goes on.&nbsp; Let's start with some background on
where this ghost may have come from.&nbsp; The story that I get from the
guys that's been there a long time is this.&nbsp; When they were building
the new plant, they apparently found one of the workers dead by a tree
when the construction first started.&nbsp; That tree was located what is
now, the center of my warehouse.&nbsp; Causes of death?&nbsp; Unknown on
our behalf.&nbsp; The second story is that the plan was built on ancient
sacred Indian grounds.&nbsp; This I can believe considering the part of
Texas we are located in.&nbsp; Who knows, it may be both.</B>
<BR><B>Things that happen in the warehouse.&nbsp; I would start with the
most common, but even then I would have to chose which one is first.&nbsp;
Some of these events have been witnessed by myself and a few by skeptics
that couldn't explain what happen.</B>
<BR><B>I guess the one that really sticks out first is the one that happen
on a daily basis.&nbsp; Just about everyone has been called by name when
alone.&nbsp; This happens to me about 3-4 times a week.&nbsp; You can be
working alone and you know for sure no one is around you and you will hear
your name called out.&nbsp; Hard to explain what it sounds like.&nbsp;
It's out&nbsp; loud, but yet it's not.&nbsp; But it is very clear.&nbsp;
Most the time it is done in a man's voice, but I have heard familiar voices
call me.&nbsp; I would be on a forklift when the gas wide open (very loud)
but hear the voice very clearly.&nbsp; When the forklifts idle, we still
have to holler to hear each other.&nbsp; This is the most common thing.</B>
<BR><B>There was an event about 2 months ago that I'm still trying to figure
out.&nbsp; This one was witnessed by a skeptic employee of mine.&nbsp;
Even this he couldn't explain and was little freaked.&nbsp; We had just
got done with a real bad thunder storm that morning.&nbsp; The warehouse
had flooded, and three of us were standing in the middle of the flood trying
to figure out how were going to clean the mess up.&nbsp; We were standing
there for about 5 min when we heard a crash.&nbsp; Something had&nbsp;
fallen over.&nbsp; Strange since the area were in was the rack section.&nbsp;
Everything is in pallet racks and no way for things to fall.&nbsp; So we
walked over to the next isle over where we heard the noise.&nbsp; Sure
enough, there was a small pile of pot saucers broken in the middle of the
floor.&nbsp; Now there are several things wrong with picture.&nbsp; One,
there are no saucers located in the area.&nbsp; I'm very organized and
everything has it's own place.&nbsp; Second, I asked the two kids that
work in that isle if they had laid any saucers in the racks.&nbsp; The
answer was no.&nbsp; Third, they were in the middle of the isle.&nbsp;
If they fell off they would be to the side of the isle.&nbsp; The only
way they could make it that far was to be dropped by hand or thrown.</B>
<BR><B>Another good story.&nbsp; Witnessed by myself and the skeptic.&nbsp;
This is in the same isle as the last story.&nbsp; Myself and the skeptic
were talking in the back of the warehouse about some stuff that had fallen
( by forklift, not ghosts)&nbsp; We were back there about a half hour,
when we heard some boxes fall in the last isle.&nbsp; We ran over to make
sure no one was hurt, but we got there, there was no one around.&nbsp;
That's not the strange part.&nbsp; the strange part is this.&nbsp; There
were two pallets stacked on top of each other.&nbsp; They were not wrapped
in plastic.&nbsp; So when they fell the boxes should of been all over the
isle.&nbsp; But what we saw was very strange and I've never seen this in
my 12 years of warehousing.&nbsp; The pallets were on their sides and the
boxes were still uniformed as if they were still standing up right.&nbsp;
It was like some one had stacked the pallets sideways.&nbsp; The boxes
were still squared on the pallets and not one pot was broken.&nbsp; The
skeptic once again, couldn't explain it and said himself, there is no way
on earth those pallets could have fallen and landed that way. NO WAY POSSIBLE</B>
<BR><B>There are many more stories.&nbsp; I will give you more as I get
the time.&nbsp; I have no pics or stories of the old plant as of yet.&nbsp;
I have my camera in my car and plan on heading out there shortly.&nbsp;
I need to take inventory out there soon and will snap some shots when I
do head out there.&nbsp; I also have a website of ghosts.&nbsp; My house
is also very haunted and have many pics on there. Feel free to check it

<BR><B>Maudslay State Park</B>
<BR><B>maudslaystories@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>Hi there, I've been visiting your site for a few years now, but finally
got the courage to write about some experiences that I've had. Before I
begin though, I just want to say that this is by far the best paranormal
site on the web. Some of the stories, photos, and EVP's on here are absolutely
incredible, and not a visit goes by that I don't get chills! Oh--by the
way, this may be a very lengthy story, so be prepared...</B>

<P><B>Anyway, I noticed on the Haunted Places Index that there is a listing
for</B>
<BR><B>Maudslay State Park in Newburyport Massachusetts. I grew up about
15 miles away from there, and know a lot about the history of Maudslay.
First let me just say that the park is huge, probably about 500-600 acres
of woods, hills, fields, little streams, gardens, trails, etc. It's located
quite close to the mouth of the Merrimack River in Newburyport--the whole
area has quite a history going way back to the earliest settlers in Massachusetts</B>
<BR><B>(and therefore, probably the entire country). Maudslay is essentially
the remaining land of what used to be a huge estate owned by the Moseley
Family.</B>
<BR><B>One of their ancestors built a huge mansion and several beautiful
English estate style gardens, which were quite well known throughout the
area. They based all of this on the family's old estate back in England
which was called Maudslay, and they named the estate after this. Adjoining
the Maudslay estate was another family's land, which I don't know too much
about except that they built a huge mansion that looked like a castle.
Sometime in the early 1900's, one of the Moseley's bought this portion
of land and added it to the already sprawling Maudslay estate. In addition
to the main mansion, there was also another little cottage type of house
that stood on another part of the property. There was some other branch
of the family living there.</B>

<P><B>Sometime in the late '60's or '70's, most of the Moseley family that
lived in the main mansion house had died, and the family members that inherited
it decided that they didn't want the house or the land, so they donated
it to the State of Massachusetts. They razed the mansion house, but left
some of the other minor buildings (carriage houses, gardener's houses,
other random sheds and buildings). Then in the late '70's, the smaller
cottage type of house mysteriously burned to the ground. The State of Massachusetts
couldn't really figure out what to do with the place until sometime in
the mid-'80's, when the governor at the time (who was big into preservation
of land and all that kind of stuff)decided to turn it into a State Park.</B>

<P><B>I first found out about Maudslay's "otherwordly" reputation about
8 years ago, when the sister of the girl that I was dating at the time
told me some weird things about it. We were all driving through Newburyport
late one evening and the sister pointed out the dark trees of Maudslay
across the river. She told me that it was very haunted. I asked her about
it, and she told me that many mysterious murders had happened there over
the years, unsolved to this day. She also told me that way back in the
16 and 1700's, way before the Moseley family got there, witches would congregate
in the dense wooded areas for their meetings. Other stories included trees
that moved by themselves and trails that would be there one minute but
completely disappear or change the next. But probably the creepiest thing
that she told me about was the so-called "gates of hell" that were on the
property. There were two, she said. One was supposedly the entrance to
this underground series of tunnels and caves, the entrance to which was
a weird utility shed that was kind of built into the side of a hill. Apparently,
according to the stories, several people had broken into the utility shed
entrance and wandered into the tunnels, only to either never been seen/heard
from again, or to be found wandering the park days or even weeks later
stark raving mad, and had to be put into such "revered" and creepy insane
asylums like the nearby Danvers State Hospital (another very haunted Massachusetts
location that could have an entire book written about it itself). Some
stories even claimed that the "hounds of hell", big black evil dogs with
"flaming eyes", were released through these "hell-gates". Another story
that she told me was that if you go down there at night, sometimes you
can see the mansion house still standing, ghostly lit-up through the trees....</B>

<P><B>I kind of looked at her after she told me this and said "C'mon, some
of that sounds totally outrageous!" I mean, a lot of it just sounded like
typical high school "hoots 'n 'haints" nonsense that gets passed around
in the urban legend-style. She insisted that it was all true--or at least
some of the less outrageous stuff. So the next weekend, my then girlfriend,
her sister, her sister's fiance and another friend of their's (a Wiccan)
all decided to head down there to see exactly what was up, and to show
me for myself all of these things.</B>

<P><B>I didn't quite know what to expect, seeing as I had never had any
real direct supernatural experiences up to that point (actually, years
later I came to believe that I had as a kid had some weird unexplainable
things happen), although I did have the ability sometimes to "feel" spirits
or if something was different about a place. I just decided to go and keep
an open mind about the whole thing. Being the end of February, there was
a fair amount of snow on the ground, and the day was sort of overcast.
We all trooped out to the main trail and despite there only being 5 of
us, I distinctly got the impression that we were being watched or even
followed from behind, but there was no one else around when I looked. The
place certainly was saturated with an otherworldly aura, and the large
clusters of pine trees and brush that cast a gloomy shadow on everything
just reinforced it. So we came to the infamous "gates of hell", which was
just like the sister decribed it. It's sort of hard to describe, but it
was basically this concrete "corridor" built into the side of a hill, and
at the end of the corridor were two tall green wooden doors that had been
locked up with chains and giant padlocks. The sister's fiance started saying
all of this "hail satan" crap, trying to be a jerk and scare everyone,
and since our awareness was heightened and we were kind of nervous, we
were all like "shut up!" After all, it's always when your tempting something
bad to show itself that it does! The Wiccan guy definitely had a bad vibe
about the place so we all took off to another part of the park, where there
was supposedly another "hell-gate". This one was pretty deep into the woods,
and you had to cross this weird little footbridge. The Wiccan guy said
that he felt that there may be some bodies buried underneath this bridge.
At this point things started to get a little strange. My girlfriend leaned
over the railing of the footbridge and go down the other side to see what
was there. In fact, we were all kind of curious as to what was down there,
it seemed like just an ordinary brook with this dam of some kind, but it
did feel like there was some sort of weird energy drawing us nearer. So
we all slid down the snowy embankment, and at the bottom as I looked up
toward the footbridge above, I saw something that still gives me shivers
to this day. There was some kind of dam directly under the footbridge,
made of big old-fashioned stone. On the front of it was an ice formation
that eerily looked like a gothic-style "gate". It took me a minute to really
register what I was seeing, but it was really there. I even saw "gargoyles"
and strange looking faces that were formed completely from ice. I started
to also see various colors started to emerge from the ice, almost in a
psychedelic kind of way, some magentas, blues, yellows, all kind of swirling
around and disappearing, then coming back again. My girlfriend now started
to try to climb over the railings of the footbridge and insisting on going
down into "it". I snapped out of the trance that I had started to fall
in, and we all ran back up there to stop her. We booked it from there pretty
quickly. Later, as we were winding our way back to the car, I asked the
Wiccan guy what that place was all about.</B>
<BR><B>He told me that that was the other "gate of hell", and that the
ice that forms there starts around October and lasts well into late April
and even early May. (I did later end of going back to that spot many years
later during the month of October, but couldn't see any ice--I did still
get a really oppressive feeling about the spot though). On the way back
to the car, suddenly the Wiccan guy fell to his knees, pressed both of
his hands to his temples and said (in a pained voice)"someone is going
to die here this summer...I can feel it". Needless to say, we were all
pretty creeped out, and I could still feel like we were being followed
or watched, even though we had not come across another person in the whole
time we were there.</B>

<P><B>So after that, I didn't really know what to think. I definitely knew
that the place had something going on there, and that there was a feeling
that someone or "something" was around, but as far as some of these outrageous
stories about people wandering into secret tunnels and caves and disappearing
or going insane, or the whole "hell-hounds" thing I thought may have been
exaggerated or made up by bored kids. I kind of thought that this Wiccan
guy may be putting us all on at times, so I can't say for sure what he
said was real or not. I did know that that place under the footbridge was
pretty creepy though. I never found out if someone died that summer there
or not.</B>

<P><B>In any case, Maudslay continued to "haunt" my thoughts and I wanted
to eventually go back there to do a little more exploring. The next time
I was back there was a couple of months later, when I drove up there with
a friend around dusk. We didn't really feel like walking around through
there at the time--it was getting dark, and we had heard rumors that if
you were caught in the park after dark you would be arrested--so we just
decided to drive by there and see if what was happening there. As we drove
down the road, I saw a woman walking along the road. Now normally, this
wouldn't seem to outrageous, but for some reason I took note of a few things.
First, where she was walking, there was no immediate entry point to the
woods beyond the metal fence that separated the road from the park. Second,
she seemed to be kind of under-dressed for the time of season and day.
It was early May, but the sun was getting pretty low in the sky and there
was a fierce wind blowing off the river which made things a little chilly.
All this woman had on been a short sleeve t-shirt and shorts. It struck
me as odd, but not as odd as what my friend and I experienced next. After
driving for a few more feet, we decided to turn around after seeing a sign
alerting us to the fact that this was a dead-end road. Now it took only
a few seconds to turn around and head the other way, but this time the
woman walking along the road was gone! Again, there was no possible place
that she could have gone in the short amount of time it took to turn around.
She the only way she could have gotten into the park was to scale the high
gothic-style metal fence and then run away, but that would have taken anyone
much much longer to do. My friend and I kind of looked at each other and
the looks we had on our faces spoke for themselves. However, as we drove
slowly past the place where we had last seen the woman, my eye caught a
moving figure just a few feet into the darkening woods--and much to my
surprise, there was the exact woman whom we had seen no less than 2 minutes
before!! By this time my friend and I were getting creeped out big time
and took outta there pretty quickly.</B>

<P><B>After this experience I didn't spend too much time up at Maudslay
for several years. Once in awhile I would bring some friends by there with
the car and point it out nonchalantly, otherwise I kept pretty clear. It
wasn't until late 2001 that I started really exploring Maudslay again.
At that time I had just moved back home to my parents' house and had been
laid off from my job. Part of my plan was to get outdoors as much as possible
and get some exercise. The first place I went was Maudslay.</B>

<P><B>Over the next couple of months I had some rather weird experiences
there.</B>
<BR><B>One time I decided to check out a portion of the park that was heavily
wooded and located on a small hill overlooking the river. There were several
abandoned little shack-like buildings there, one of which was an old garage
and another of which was this boat house type of thing. As soon as I walked
into this wooded area, I distinctly felt like I was not alone, like someone
was watching me, even though I had not seen anyone else there yet that
morning. As I looked around a bit, I really began to feel like I was NOT
welcomed here at all. I decided to get out of that area right then rather
than face an unpleasant surprise!</B>

<P><B>Since the park is so huge, there are any number of trails that you
can follow. I walked just about every single one of them, and over time
began to figure out which areas of the park seemed "okay" and which areas
felt oppressive or uncomfortable. One particularly uncomfortable area is
a place called the Magnolia Path, quite fittingly for the dense Magnolia
groves that all but suffocate the path. (Interestingly, I found out that
this path is very close in proximity to the supposed second "hell gate"
under the footbridge.) The path always seemed unnaturally dark, even on
a bright and sunny day, and this made a little sense seeing that it was
surrounded by tall fir trees and dense Magnolia groves, but there was almost
like an "atmosphere" to the darkness, like something was waiting to jump
out at you when you walked through there. I would approach the path with
caution, and quicken my step once surrounded by the trees. A few times
I went out of my way to avoid going there, almost like my intuition picked
up some bad vibes emanating from there and warning me that it might not
be a good idea to be there.</B>

<P><B>Just on the other side of the Magnolia Path is a wide, stone footbridge
that crosses a large brook. This is the same brook that eventually flows
into the creepy dam "hell-gate" under the footbridge. I used to get the
oddest feelings of deja vu when standing on this bridge and looking out
over the murky brook. It would also bring up a deep feeling of sadness
and melancholy that I had absolutely no reason to be feeling; one minute
I would be perfectly happy and the next I would feel such sadness and depression.</B>

<P><B>Beyond the brook and footbridge are a series of trails that split
out into all different directions. One of them splits after climbing a
short hill. Often times walking along this trail, I've felt like I was
being watched and followed, although there was nobody there. On one particularly
dreary and drizzly day, I was startled to come upon an area that had been
policed taped off on the side of this trail. I've so far not been able
to find anything in newspapers or anything like that detailing what that
may have been about.</B>

<P><B>It seems though, that the farther one walks into the park, the more
mysterious and creepy it gets. This is especially true when nearing the
Castle Hill, the site of the old mansion deep in the woods that was razed
long long ago. After climbing a steep trail, you'll come to the top of
this big hill that offers an amazing view of the surrounding area. The
rest of the hill is covered with dense woods, and I always got the feeling
when up there that I probably shouldn't stay there too long. One day, I
climbed up there despite the feeling that it wasn't a good idea to do so.
I walked the rest of the trail down to the bottom of the hill and found
another trail that I had never seen before. This one supposedly led to
a place deep in the woods called "bootlegger's field" or something along
those lines....the trail went farther and farther into the woods and the
whole time I was very uncomfortable. For one thing, there was an eerie
silence. Even though it was winter time, you usually hear various critters
running around, but there was no sound at all...it also seemed unusually
dark and ominous. After walking a few yards I turned and left. When I got
back to the main trail, I felt a little better but still got the impression
that I wasn't wanted there.</B>

<P><B>And then, of course, there are the gardens. If you walk through the
start of the park, there is a trail that breaks off the main path. If you
take this path you end up in the old gardens, which were designed to look
like those of an old English estate. From what I can gather, they aren't
really maintained or used anymore. In the middle of these gardens are two
mysterious structures which must have been the houses of the gardeners
in the old days. Both of these places had an unexplainable aura to them,
like there they were almost "alive" with energy. I constantly felt like
I was being watched there. I would hear what sounded like footsteps behind
me, and when turning around to see who was there, there would be nobody.
For weeks after visiting the gardens, I had very vivid and disturbing dreams
about the two gardener houses. The details now are a little sketchy, but
I remember feeling like I had some old connection to the houses and was
waiting around them for an answer to an old question that I had never answered.
I also remember feeling a sad presence in the dream, like a soul who didn't
want to be there any more but couldn't find a way out. I never went back
to the gardens again.</B>

<P><B>Well I've written a lot here, and there are some more stories I have
about this place that I don't have time right now to mention. I would be
VERY interested to hear from anyone in the Newburyport, MA area who's been
to Maudslay and may have any information at all about the history of the
place or personal stories of hauntings or other weird experiences there.
I've looked in the local library there but they don't really have too much
information other than the basic historical facts of the Moseley family
and such. Please email me at maudslaystories@hotmail.com with any information,
stories, etc.</B>
