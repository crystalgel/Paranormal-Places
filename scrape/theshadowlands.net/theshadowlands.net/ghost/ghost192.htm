<b>My Grandmother</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bwieland@connection.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is back in 1983 my mother and I had gone up to Collingwood because
my</b>
<br><b>Grandmother had just passed away a couple of days prier. She was
on so much</b>
<br><b>medication that I don't think she knew that she had just died. So
anyway one</b>
<br><b>morning a couple of days later I heard a voice and it sounded just
like my</b>
<br><b>grandmother, the door opened and I heard her say "Muriel, it's time
to get</b>
<br><b>up" then I heard mom say "I'll be up in a few minutes mum". She
always got</b>
<br><b>us up at curtain times.</b>
<br><b>My mom and I slept in the same room. When I did get up I said to
my mother</b>
<br><b>why did nana (that's what I called my grandmother) call us so early,
then the both of us</b>
<br><b>realized that nana was dead and that was my grandmothers ghost.
That's all I have for now.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for reading</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Ghost Tales</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I know this might sound kind of wierd cuz I was the</b>
<br><b>only one who saw (actually I only heard I was to scared to look)
But it was</b>
<br><b>about 2 years ago and I was sleeping over my friends house ( in
a sort of</b>
<br><b>small town in Maine ) and i could not get to sleep. at around 3
or 4:30 in</b>
<br><b>the morning i heard the sound of a man in work boots stomping up
the stairs,</b>
<br><b>i know it wasnt his dad because he hasnt worked i along time ( i
think it was</b>
<br><b>because he broke his back but i am not sure ) at about the 11th
step his dad</b>
<br><b>yelled out go to bed rob ( the other reason i knew it wasnt him
) the</b>
<br><b>footsteps stopped then they started up again they walked right up
to the door</b>
<br><b>and stopped. I lied still for what seemed like 3 or 4 hours but
it wasnt that</b>
<br><b>long. of course i forgot my blanket down stairs which ment i would
have to go</b>
<br><b>past the ghost to get it, and i am not that dumb. so i felt how
cold the room</b>
<br><b>got. when i woke up in the morning my frend and his dad sort of
belived me.</b>
<br><b>but his dad could not remember yelling at me so did he really do
it or was</b>
<br><b>the ghost imitating his exact voice, that i will never know. that
has not</b>
<br><b>been the only " sighting" in the house. when my friend was first
moving in</b>
<br><b>his dad and step mom stayed the night there and while his dad was
watching a</b>
<br><b>movie he got the urge to look at the stairs an saw a mans work boot
going up</b>
<br><b>stairs he moved as fast as he could to see what was there but the
top floor</b>
<br><b>was empty. and not long after my expirence my best friend said he
saw a</b>
<br><b>shadow come form out of the floor.</b>

<p><b>I'm from Wichita, Ks...and even though my house is</b>
<br><b>only about 10 years old i belive it is haunted by the</b>
<br><b>boy who commited suicide in my house. Durning the</b>
<br><b>middle of the night when i first moved here I always</b>
<br><b>heard a knocking on my bead room door i would go and</b>
<br><b>open it and no one was there. My parents and brother</b>
<br><b>were in bed.I thought it was pretty earie. Then one</b>
<br><b>day when my friends and i were sitting on the computer</b>
<br><b>chatting i turned to my left and I saw a teenage boy</b>
<br><b>walk across my living room and i screamed. My friends</b>
<br><b>were like what Jane what?!? And i told them that i saw</b>
<br><b>a man walk across the living room and he went past a</b>
<br><b>wall and dissapeared. And My brother went to go check</b>
<br><b>it out and i just said i was seeing things but i knew</b>
<br><b>i wasn't. Always during the night i would be down</b>
<br><b>stairs watching the television and i would start</b>
<br><b>walking up stairs after i was done and i ALWAYS get</b>
<br><b>the feeling some one is behind me or watching me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The room that the boy lived in is our guest room.</b>
<br><b>ANd that room is upstairs and for some reason year</b>
<br><b>round that room is FREEZING no matter if its like 80</b>

<p><b>Little Girl Haunted</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tammer@usadatanet.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;When I was a little girl, I lived in a haunted house in Bangor,Ny.&nbsp;
On night about 6o'clock my dad, brother and I were outside picking up the
yard.&nbsp; It was a clear night and there had not been a storm for a couple
of days.&nbsp; I had looked up to the attic window and saw that the attic
lights were flickering on and off.&nbsp; The next day we had the electric
checked.&nbsp; Nothing was wrong.&nbsp; We had other occurances&nbsp; before.
Such as running sounds going up and down the attic stairs, solpher smells,
figures, noises, and we would even feel the ghosts tug on us once and a
while.&nbsp; Also things like furniture moved around,&nbsp; cuboards open
and closeing.&nbsp; We use to think it was a girl ghost because it didn't
like girls in the house, it only accepted men.&nbsp; I am still not sure
what went on in that house but I know I believe in what happened.</b>

<p><b>Mothers Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jwchattell@yahoo.co.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is James and a few years ago my aunt nd uncle</b>
<br><b>came to visit some how a conversation had sprung up</b>
<br><b>about supernatural Experiences we had had. my mother</b>
<br><b>started to tell this story about when she and my aunt</b>
<br><b>and her boyfriend (my uncle) was still living with</b>
<br><b>their parents. she said on new years eve after they</b>
<br><b>had just come back from a party at my great aunts</b>
<br><b>house and *EVERY ONE* had gonne to bed she her some</b>
<br><b>voices down stairs in the kitchen. it sounded like</b>
<br><b>they were having a little late night party so she went</b>
<br><b>downstares to investigate. There was no one there but</b>
<br><b>she could still hear the voices but now they were</b>
<br><b>still all around her like the things didnt even know</b>
<br><b>that she was there. She got scared and ran back up the</b>
<br><b>stares to her bed room and locked the door and got</b>
<br><b>into bed. after my mother had finished the story my</b>
<br><b>Uncle (aunts boyfriend) sat up and said was this</b>
<br><b>around 1975 (when my mother was about 17) and she said</b>
<br><b>yes why and my uncle said well i herd the exact same</b>
<br><b>noises coming from the kitchen and when he went down</b>
<br><b>stares and he experienced exactly the same thing.</b>
<br><b>My mother also told another story witch she found a</b>
<br><b>little bit emotional to talk about. two days after my</b>
<br><b>grand mother had died and my mother and the rest of</b>
<br><b>the family had came back from the funeral My mother</b>
<br><b>went up into the bathroom and started to draw a bath</b>
<br><b>because this was a very old house (17th centry) there</b>
<br><b>was a large boiler next to the sink just after my</b>
<br><b>mothers bath was ready and she was getting ready to</b>
<br><b>get in it she started to back up trying to get of her</b>
<br><b>trousers. my mother was going towards the boiler and</b>
<br><b>if she hit it she could of possibly lost her life</b>
<br><b>because of the intence heat (you cold only fell the</b>
<br><b>heat when you were very close to it because the bath</b>
<br><b>room didnt have any heating). something touced and</b>
<br><b>pushed my mother away from the boiler stopping her</b>
<br><b>from hitting it. my mother beleves to this day that it</b>
<br><b>was my grandmother who touched her that night trying</b>
<br><b>to save her.</b>

<br><b>Paranormal Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ARMontgomery@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>dear dave- my name is rusty and i have experienced high levels of
paranormal activity in my old house i grew up in.i moved in there at age
7 ,it is a little town in florida named sanford.the house was a parsonage
next to a christian church my parents got married in many years before.strange
things would occur like hearing voices , knocking from the attic ,hearing
things fall in the closet ,then to look and find out that nothing had fallen
at all.now i want you to know that i lived there up until about age 16,so
you dont think that i was to young to remember things that i heard and
saw.the house was about 40 years old when i was there back in the eighties,and
i dont know much history about the house other than most of the pastors
of the church would live there during their term at the church.one night
i awoke to see my mom in the doorway...or what looked to be my mom.i sat
up in bed and asked my mom why she was just standing there and looking
at me?then the apparition kind of glowed greenish white,and was wearing
a night gown of some type.i started to get very scared at this point because
the apparition started not to look like my mom anymore,but that of an older
lady..then i asked the form what she wanted,and the apparition dissappeared.now
a lot of people i tell that story to laughs at me but believe me when i
tell you as i am writing this the hair on the back of my neck stands up.there
was another occasion when me my mom and dad and my brother were watching
a movie in the living room,every door in the house shut one right after
the other.there were no windows open and the air conditioning was not on.my
mom and dad did a good job of dissmissing it just to put us at ease,for
years they would make up stories about the occurences so that we would
not be scared.things would also happen like seeing someone staring at you
out of the corner of your eye,then not being there when you looked in that
direction.we had venetian blinds and you would hear a noise like someone
running their finger down the blinds,and then see them moving.my mother
told me that it was just the wind.my parents finally admitted that the
house was haunted,about 5 years after we moved out.we are very good friends
with our old neighbors next to that house,and i was over there just the
other day visiting,and my friend told me that a new couple just moved in
there about 2 weeks ago and they have already packed up and moved out.my
friend also went on to tell me about the week prior to that..that the young
lady was there alone one night because her husband worked nights,and the
next thing my friend told me was that she heard screaming next door and
the woman came over to her house screaming that someone or something was
in that house.she never went into detail on what she saw or heard.well
i guess thats all i wanted to write you about,i have really enjoyed your
website and am very interested in paranormal investigation.keep up the
good work!</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Dog Tasha</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DebKinl@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a short story to tell you.&nbsp;
My dog Tasha died almost a year and</b>
<br><b>a half ago,&nbsp; she was a big red Doberman.&nbsp; She really was
beautiful, friendly,</b>
<br><b>and very protective of her family and friends.&nbsp; She was also
very jealous of</b>
<br><b>her toys.&nbsp; We have two other dogs in our family, and sometimes
Sunshine, the</b>
<br><b>lab mix, would try to take Tasha's blue ball.&nbsp; To keep the
peace we bought</b>
<br><b>another one.&nbsp; After Tasha died, we noticed that Sunshine's
ball had</b>
<br><b>disappeared.&nbsp; For about six months we would hear Tasha playing
with the</b>
<br><b>missing ball.&nbsp; We know it was Tasha because she was the only
one who would</b>
<br><b>put the ball in her mouth and chew up and down, it made a very distinctive</b>
<br><b>sound.&nbsp; We would hear her sigh, and shake herself, ( her collar
also had it's</b>
<br><b>own sound) and she would wake me up in the morning by licking my
face.&nbsp; Tasha</b>
<br><b>was the only one who could reach my face in bed because of her size.&nbsp;
After</b>
<br><b>six months the sounds began to fade, although sometimes she still
wakes me up</b>
<br><b>by licking me.&nbsp; The blue ball turned up looking well chewed.&nbsp;
And sometimes I</b>
<br><b>hear her nails on the tile in the bathroom where she liked to sleep.&nbsp;
I think</b>
<br><b>she just wanted to stay with us for a while longer.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Cat Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Girly14872@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've been reading a lot of the ghosts stories on this site, and I
decided to</b>
<br><b>write and share what I believe is a "Haunting" as you call it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; About a year ago my cat Crissy disappeared. We were very
close. I got her</b>
<br><b>from the Humane Society when I was three, and when you get a pet
from there</b>
<br><b>it's usually a good one. It's like the pets are grateful for you
saving them.</b>
<br><b>Crissy and I had been through a lot together, and we loved eachother
very</b>
<br><b>much. One morning I woke up, and I felt like something was wrong.
I went down</b>
<br><b>to breakfast, and my Mother told me she couldn't find Crissy anywhere.
She</b>
<br><b>had disappeared a few times before by either getting locked in a
closet or</b>
<br><b>getting too high up in a tree, so I tried to tell myself we would
find her,</b>
<br><b>and everything would be fine. We looked for her for about a week,
but from</b>
<br><b>the start I think we all thought it was in vain. About six months
later, when</b>
<br><b>the subject wasn't so painful I couldn't handle it, my mother and
I talked</b>
<br><b>about her. She told me that when she had opened the door that morning
to let</b>
<br><b>my other cat in she saw and felt a sort of white flash. My cat had
a very</b>
<br><b>particular way of entering the house, she would leap as high as
she could</b>
<br><b>over the threshold and her paws would thump on the floor. Mom said
it was</b>
<br><b>like she did that, and then it disappeared.</b>
<br><b>It was then I realized that I too had felt her presence before.
She used to</b>
<br><b>love to sleep with me, and sometimes I can still feel her jump on
my bed,</b>
<br><b>slowly walk over&nbsp; and curl up beside me. Sometimes I can even
hear her meow,</b>
<br><b>or scratch on our front door. I swear sometimes I can even still
feel her fur</b>
<br><b>at night on my bed beside me. I know her spirit is still there in
the house</b>
<br><b>with me, and it makes me feel comforted.</b>

<p><b>Mt. Carmel</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: NiRvAnALiThIuM1@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok here I go with what sounds like another traditional
ghost story.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>used to work at Mt. Carmel a nun home in Dubuque IA.&nbsp; I know
it's odd that</b>
<br><b>anything paranormal would be lurching in a home for people that
devoted their</b>
<br><b>whole lives to god.&nbsp; Anyway it all started out with my experience
but first</b>
<br><b>you need to know the history.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mt. Carmel was built in 1889 I think.&nbsp; Over
the years new additions have</b>
<br><b>been added on.&nbsp; Way back when I'm not sure though, the sisters
would teach</b>
<br><b>children there so there are a few school rooms.&nbsp; Well Mt. Carmel
has been</b>
<br><b>burned down atleast 2 times and a whole school room of children
were killed.</b>
<br><b>In that hall people say that sometimes you can hear children cry
and the</b>
<br><b>crackling noises of fire.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night I was working in one of the dining
rooms that was built in</b>
<br><b>sometime in the 1930's and we still have some of the old machinerey
and</b>
<br><b>things in there including an old cooler that never gets used in
the way back.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;A couple of times when i moped back there , there would be
a loud banging</b>
<br><b>noise coming from the inside and a faint screaming noise.&nbsp;
Even though I was</b>
<br><b>kinda spooked out I opened it anyway and it doesn't even run anymore
and</b>
<br><b>there is nothing around this part of the building that the noise
could have</b>
<br><b>come from.&nbsp; At night when we were done cleaning and everything
the supervisor</b>
<br><b>would come and check and make sure we would have the machines off
and when we</b>
<br><b>would come in in the the morning they would be turned on.&nbsp;
We would all be</b>
<br><b>kind of upset over this because sometimes we would get yelled at
and the</b>
<br><b>supervisor would get yelled at for not making sure it was off.&nbsp;
One day i</b>
<br><b>made the comment that it was haunted and the supervisor said&nbsp;
I know it is</b>
<br><b>and we sat down and she shared her own experiences.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late at night on 3rd floor some of the nurses
aides would see the</b>
<br><b>apprition of the old head mother who died there about 45 years ago,
and the</b>
<br><b>sound of her cat up by the attic and by her old room. (they kept
her cat and</b>
<br><b>cared for it until it died.)&nbsp; When one of our sisters died
my supervisor and</b>
<br><b>another co-worker cleaned out her room to get things ready for her
family to</b>
<br><b>take.&nbsp; They completely took everything out and turned out the
light.&nbsp; About</b>
<br><b>15 minutes later the light was back on and they thought nothing
of it and</b>
<br><b>turned it off and as soon as they turned their backs it went back
on.&nbsp; This</b>
<br><b>time she stepped into the room and in the very middle the sisters
shoes were</b>
<br><b>there on the floor, when she knew that everything had been cleared
out and</b>
<br><b>she knew she had packed them.</b>

<p><b>Just a Coincidence?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dimples_376@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hey, great website. My name is Michelle, and I'm a 20 year old college</b>
<br><b>student. My story began when I was a senior in high school. It doesn't</b>
<br><b>involved ghosts directly, but I still think it's kinda interesting.
I grew</b>
<br><b>up out in the sticks of Connecticut, where I spent the first 17
years of my</b>
<br><b>life cow-tipping and watching grass grow. It was extremely boring,
and I was</b>
<br><b>completely miserable.</b>
<br><b>Just after the beginning of my senior year in high school, a little
over</b>
<br><b>three years ago, I had two strange dreams that at the time had no
apparent</b>
<br><b>meaning....In the first dream, I was flying very quickly through
the clouds,</b>
<br><b>and with me was what I believed was God. As we were soaring through
the sky,</b>
<br><b>I looked down and saw the blue ocean below. Soon, I began seeing
boats and</b>
<br><b>gray shingled houses. It was so beautiful. We flew around and around.
I</b>
<br><b>believed what I saw was a small fishing town, but wasn't certain.
I knew it</b>
<br><b>was located on some type of land mass away from the coast because
I saw the</b>
<br><b>ocean as we were approaching and I also felt a sense of distance.
When I</b>
<br><b>woke up the next morning, I thought it was a weird dream but kinda
relaxing.</b>
<br><b>The second dream happened a few months later. The details are a
little</b>
<br><b>blurry, but the general idea is there....I was standing in front
of a house.</b>
<br><b>It was old, dark, and very ugly, with pointy tower-like structures
and</b>
<br><b>uneven shingles. As I entered through the side door, and saw a long,
narrow</b>
<br><b>staircase ahead of me, I knew instantly that something bad had happened
in</b>
<br><b>that house. I also remember being chased through the house, at some
point,</b>
<br><b>but the rest is blurry. It was a scary, and very unsettling dream.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, I went on with my life, graduated from high school, and
relocated to</b>
<br><b>Boston for college, not really thinking that much of either dream</b>
<br><b>afterwards. The summer after my freshman year, I was offered a job
on</b>
<br><b>Nantucket, a small island located 30 miles off the coast of Massachusetts.
I</b>
<br><b>had never been there before, and after enduring the long, 2 hour
boat ride,</b>
<br><b>I arrived only to be greeted with a lot of rain and fog. I wasn't
able to</b>
<br><b>see a thing from the ferry.</b>
<br><b>About halfway through the summer, I needed to return to the mainland
for a</b>
<br><b>few days and boarded the boat, preparing for the long trip back.
It was a</b>
<br><b>beautiful, sunny day, unlike the day I arrived, and I wanted to
check out</b>
<br><b>the view of the town before we left. When I reached the top of the
ferry and</b>
<br><b>looked out across the town, I almost fell overboard. It was exactly
what I</b>
<br><b>had seen in the first dream I had had. It was amazing. From that
moment, I</b>
<br><b>knew there was some alternate reason for me being there, and I knew
that was</b>
<br><b>where I belonged. That summer was the first time I had ever been
truly</b>
<br><b>happy.</b>
<br><b>It gets a little stranger. This past summer, after a long year of
waiting to</b>
<br><b>return, I was finally back. It was like I NEEDED to go back. Not
returning</b>
<br><b>wasn't even an option. I know it sounds weird, but it's hard to
explain.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, one day in July, while riding my bike down the long road
that leads</b>
<br><b>to Sankaty Light House (for those of you who know). I looked to
my right and</b>
<br><b>stopped dead in my tracks, leaving a skidmark halfway down the street.
There</b>
<br><b>was the exact house from my second dream! It stood out with its
dark,</b>
<br><b>gothic-like towers and tight, squared structure, among the large,
gray</b>
<br><b>shingled homes that surrounded it. I passed that house many times
over the</b>
<br><b>summer however, when I worked at night, I just could NOT bring myself
to go</b>
<br><b>near it. I always took the long way to avoid passing the house.
It really</b>
<br><b>frightened me, but I can't explain why.</b>
<br><b>I always wondered about the history of the house, and often wanted
to stop</b>
<br><b>and ask the owner, but was afraid I of what I might discover. Hopefully,
I</b>
<br><b>will be returning to Nantucket again this summer and will finally
be able to</b>
<br><b>dig up some information, but for now, I need to concentrate on school
and</b>
<br><b>not the overwhelming feeling I have everyday that is forcing me

<br><b>Is it a Haunting?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Vicsgirl4ever@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>since we moved into this house there have been several "little" things
that</b>
<br><b>have happened.&nbsp; For instance....this is an old house and you
can feel it when</b>
<br><b>someone walks in another part of the house, we have all experienced
this</b>
<br><b>when there was no one else in the house.&nbsp; One day I was sitting
at my</b>
<br><b>computer which is near the front door.&nbsp; My husband had taken
our daughter to</b>
<br><b>see her grandparents in another town.&nbsp; I heard a man's voice
that sounded as</b>
<br><b>if it was coming from my right just outside the door.&nbsp; When
I opened it of</b>
<br><b>course there was no one there.&nbsp; I was cooking fried green tomatoes
and I felt</b>
<br><b>like someone was standing behind me watching me.&nbsp; I said 'do
you like fried</b>
<br><b>green tomatoes Mr. Burl?" and my 3 year old said "hi!" and smiled
and the</b>
<br><b>feeling went away.&nbsp; Another night I was asleep in my bed. My
husband was</b>
<br><b>watching television in another room.&nbsp; It was very cold that
night and I had a</b>
<br><b>sleeping bag thrown on top of my other covers.&nbsp; I felt the
sleeping bag</b>
<br><b>sliding off and sat up to put it back on and there was a man standing
at the</b>
<br><b>foot of the bed puling the sleeping bag I yelped and my husband
came in.</b>
<br><b>Often there are shadows, sounds, etc...&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not afraid
just wondering if</b>
<br><b>you think it's what I think it is.&nbsp; Oh yeah, Mr. Burl is the
man who built</b>
<br><b>and lived in this house until he died.</b>

<p><b>Bungalow Boo!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Nicklockley1@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>i just finished reading your story and looking at the picture about
the</b>
<br><b>ghost. i am 14 years old and have never had somthing like that happen
to me</b>
<br><b>but...</b>
<br><b>when i was younger i lived in a small convorted bungalow which used
to be</b>
<br><b>owned by an old man who died in the house. we had some very strange
things go</b>
<br><b>on there such as, strange unexplained noises we could always smell
pipe smoke</b>
<br><b>+ the man use to smoke a pipe my mother and father woke up in the
night to</b>
<br><b>hear a chain being dragged across the floor upstairs so they got
the dog to</b>
<br><b>go up there to check there was noone there but when they got there
there was</b>
<br><b>no one and most of all we all slept at one side of the house but
whenever we</b>
<br><b>were there we allways felt like we were being watched + it was proved
that we</b>
<br><b>wernt the only ones who thought that because one day my mothers
friend</b>
<br><b>lavinia was having a shower and she suddenly came running out clutching
her</b>
<br><b>towel and when my mother asked what was wrong she said she felt
like there</b>
<br><b>was somone watching her. and once somthing happened to me, i was
4 years old</b>
<br><b>and i was under my covers in the night and i stretched out my leg
and i felt</b>
<br><b>a cold hand hold my leg but i thought it was my mother + since i
was only 4</b>
<br><b>years old i didnt think much of it then when i pulled my leg in
it let go and</b>
<br><b>i stretched it out again and it took hold again. i can still not
determen</b>
<br><b>wether it was a dream or not but i can remember it clearly and it
felt very</b>
<br><b>realistic. we left the house when i was 7 and moved to a big house
but the</b>
<br><b>man who had bought the house off us when we left bought it in hire
purchase</b>
<br><b>so he had to pay monthly but he didnt pay up so we kicked him out.
then when</b>
<br><b>my parents divorced me my sister and mother moved back to the old
house but</b>
<br><b>allways slept upstairs and never went in the supposabley haunted
side. i have</b>
<br><b>recently found out from my mother that my grandmas house has also
had strange</b>
<br><b>happenings, my great grandma died in the house and so did the lady
who used</b>
<br><b>to live there. and my mother told me that she had many strange incounters</b>
<br><b>with ghosts like, lights turning on by them self, and once she wanted
to tape</b>
<br><b>some music and when she played it back&nbsp; she heard groans on
the tape and once</b>
<br><b>she was in bed and she saw 3 strange lights dancing on the wall
when the</b>
<br><b>courtains were shut tight with no gaps and no cars were outside.
they lights</b>
<br><b>danced around the wall for a bit then suddenly came together and
shot accross</b>
<br><b>the bed my mother say's there was no sound but a massive flash like
thundar</b>
<br><b>all round her room. and there was one more thing that happened while
my</b>
<br><b>mother was in the house, my great grandma used to sleep in the big
bed with</b>
<br><b>my mother and 2 days after my great grandma died my mother was in
bed and</b>
<br><b>heard my great grandma breathing and since my great grandma used
to wheeze</b>
<br><b>when she breathed it was unmistakeble. and once my grandma saw the
ex owner</b>
<br><b>of the house standing at the top of the stairs (well she said she
did but it</b>
<br><b>was probily my grandpa getting off the toilet). and thats all except
for the</b>

<p><b>I Had an Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mitchellhallock@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Back on June 20, 1993, I stayed at the original Flamingo Hotel in
Las Vegas.</b>
<br><b>It was old and was scheduled for demolition to make way for a new
hi-rise</b>
<br><b>hotel the following week.</b>
<br><b>I awoke and saw a white coated man moving near my luggage. I thought
it was</b>
<br><b>a robbery, I laid still and watched him move back and forth, I was</b>
<br><b>petrified, I watched the digital clock move from 11:29 to 11:33
as he moved</b>
<br><b>around. I pretended to sleep and rolled over towards the bedside
lamp. It</b>
<br><b>was then I saw a man in a dark suit at the foot of the bed looking
down at</b>
<br><b>me. I jumped, turned the light on and woke my wife..there was nobody
in the</b>
<br><b>room!</b>
<br><b>The next day we had trouble with the sink running and running..the</b>
<br><b>maintenance man said it must be the ghost of Bugsy Siegel mad at
the thought</b>
<br><b>of his home being torn down. It turns out Siegel's room was upstairs
from us</b>
<br><b>and was locked up like a musem exhinit. I just told that story and
someone</b>
<br><b>looked on the web and found out Bugsy Siegel was murdered on that
day , June</b>
<br><b>20 in 1947 around that time of night.</b>

<br><b>House Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Elizabeth_Snow@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>It was about two and a half years ago, but I still remember it clearly.
My parents and I were searching for a new home around Columbus Ohio. I
enjoyed it because there were so many places to choose from and so many
different styles. Plus it got me out of my old house which I had presumed
to be haunted. I'm not really sure if that one was, I'm guessing it was
my older just trying to scare me at night. We had been searching for about
two days adn the woman who had been showing us around had mentioned an
older home on a lake. It was cheap and from what she said it was rather
large and beautiful. So off we went in search of this fantastic home. As
soon as we pulled into the driveway my skin began to crawl and I already
didn't like it. It was a nice place, but you could tell it was an older
lot. A little work was all it needed yet it felt like the house was screaming
stay away. I was a little worried about entering the old place, but I was
curious about what caused my short panic attack. I have always believed
in the supernatural and such. I figured why not. As soon as I entered a
horrible smell seemed to fill the house. It was that smell you get when
you go into an old folks home, the smell of pain and death. My mother said
it was just mold smell and if they left the door open it would probably
clear up. I stayed close to my parents while we looked around the house.
I kept getting this horrible feeling that something wasn't right that we
should leave now. I finally left the company of my parents, because they
were talking about something horribly boring. I went upstairs to investigate
and to my surprise the smell wasn't so bad, but it seemed a tad cooler.
I thought that was odd. I walked in and out of all the bedrooms except
the end one. The door was shut. I turned around&nbsp; and out of the corner
of my eye I saw someone enter the room on the left side of me. I thought
it was my mother, but when I called out no one answered, and when I looked
inside the room no one was there. I tore down the stairs and ran through
the kitchen looking for my parents and tell them that we are getting out
of there. I found them in the back bedroom and I must have looked like
I had seen something because my father asked me if I was alright. I forced
a smile and said something like " Oh I'm just peachy, even though I'm pretty
sure I saw someone upstairs following me. Oh don't worry it can't hurt
me, it's already dead. Can we get the hell out of here... uh NOW!" (I wrote
in my journal after we came back to the hotel room and that's what I put
down) My mother ignored me and my father just smiled. I walked away, I
assume they thought I didn't like the house and if I made up something
they would't buy it. So onward to the basement they went. I followed relunctently,
because in the house this seemed to be the worst spot. It was cold, wet,
and it gave me the feeling that I was being watched. We walked arounf the
basement, it was about that time that the realator told us about the homes
history. A couple had lived there, the aunt of the girl had gotten sick
and she had no other family. So of course they took her in. She lived in
the basement until her death, and shortly afterwards the couple moved out
because everything reminded them of dear aunty. Sure.They probably saw
dead aunt and quickly vacated their home. It would explain the price. I
think that's about the time my parents got the feeling that the place was
haunted because all of the 'adults' looked at one another and decided to
leave. MOther won't admit to me that I saw anything, but she later said
the my father had felt something and the place frightened him. So thats
my story, hope you like it.</b><b></b>

<br><b>This is My Moment of Supernatural</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Nobutts80k@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Alright me and my friend nathan were walking through the woods one
day and we</b>
<br><b>found this old abandoned house and we were skeptical about it so
we went in</b>
<br><b>it. There were clothes scattered everywhere and we found the guy
who used to</b>
<br><b>live there's name. His name is Harry Shaffer. When we steped foot
in there we</b>
<br><b>could feel a cold breeze sweeping over us like i've been reading
wut happens</b>
<br><b>when a ghost sweeps over you. Well we went home and nathan went
home and he</b>
<br><b>was looking at his family tree and the name Harry Shaffer came up
and there</b>
<br><b>was a picture of him standing in front of the house that we went
in! I</b>
<br><b>couldn't believe it. Well the next time nathan came over we went
back only</b>
<br><b>this time we went down the steps and i happened to find the bathroom
and it</b>
<br><b>looked like there was a rope hanging down from it and just when
i was gonna</b>
<br><b>look in the door from the stairwell slammed shut and it couldn't
of just been</b>
<br><b>from the wind because it really slammed plus there was no wind.

<p><b>Here to Stay</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jimeddie@prodigy.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've written before about our little girl spirit
who seems so attached to us.&nbsp; I do believe she is here to stay.</b>
<br><b>The Xmas tree is down so the ornaments are no longer there for her
to play with.&nbsp; Guess what she does now?</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Xmas, I gave my Dearheart a couple of those
fishes that you can mount on your wall.&nbsp; They play songs or say things
or such.&nbsp; Anyway, the one she has really taken a shine to is the Cool
Catfish.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than a few times (especially on weekends),
my kids and I will be sitting on the couch when the Cool Catfish decides
to go off.&nbsp; Please keep in mind the only way this fish is supposed
to activate is when one walks by it or presses the activation button.&nbsp;
No one was near this thing.&nbsp; Keeps going off.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not scary, just rather annoying.&nbsp; The fish
says funny things, but only once.&nbsp; After that it gets OLD.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing she seems fond of doing is scaring
our cats.&nbsp; One of them is older and scared of everything anyway, but
the other is still a kitten and pretty fearless.&nbsp; Both of them will
come running out of my bedroom like someone lit their tail on fire!&nbsp;
It's funny to watch them scramble into the living room and look for "protection"
from their mom.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've heard my daughter talk to someone in her
sleep.&nbsp; I don't know if she's just dreaming or actually talking to
our visitor.&nbsp; She holds an actual conversation, almost like she is
awake and playing.&nbsp; Kinda eerie.&nbsp; She only does this about a
half hour after she has fallen asleep.&nbsp; Not every night, but more
than I care to remember.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, thanks for listening and keep up the
good work!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunting at My House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: aba28aba@gateway.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am a 30 year old mother of two who never had any kind of ghostly
experiences before until about a year ago.&nbsp; My husband, our 4 year
old daughter and myself lived in a house that was approximatly 60-70 years
old in an older part of a pretty big sized city.&nbsp; We had lived in
the house for 6 years, but we were looking to expand our family and the
house was very small so we put it up for sale in August of 1999.&nbsp;
About two weeks after the house went on the market, my husband was working
nights and our daughter was asleep in her bed.&nbsp; It was around 10:30pm
and I was doing dishes before going to bed.&nbsp; The stove light was on
and so was the lamp in the living room.&nbsp; The windows were doubled
paned storm windows (so therefore when you looked out the window at night
you saw the reflection of the room behind you).&nbsp; I looked up from
the dish I was washing and there was a shape of a man behind me standing
in the doorway between my kitchen and den with his arms folded across his
chest.&nbsp; I could see his shape very clearly, however I could also see
into the room through him.&nbsp; I could not make out facial features,
but could tell by his size that he was a fairly large man.&nbsp; I stared
at him for approximately 30 seconds then looked back down at the dish I
was washing and when I looked back up "he" was gone.&nbsp; I called my
husband at work because I was so shaken by the experience.&nbsp; Of course
he thought I was nuts, said it was my imagination and that I just needed
to rest.&nbsp; Several days later a friend of mine came over a kept experiencing
a "cold spot" in that same area between the kitchen and den.&nbsp; I told
her the story of what I had seen and my husband confessed to the fact that
he had known since we moved in that a man had been murdered in the home
about 30 years before.&nbsp; After that things really started to happen.&nbsp;
But they only happened to me (or so I think).&nbsp; About a week later
my husband was at work again.&nbsp; My daughter was now sleeping in the
bed with me when he was gone.&nbsp; She was already in bed and I was standing
at the bedroom door fixing to turn off the lights.&nbsp; We both suddenly
heard glass breaking as if a heavy glass object had fallen.&nbsp; She sat
up and bed and asked me what it was and I told her my vase probably fell
off of the table.&nbsp; I went to the front part of the house and there
was nothing broken.&nbsp; I searched every room and the next morning checked
outside but could find no broken glass anywhere.&nbsp; That really creeped
me out.&nbsp; Another experience happened while I was home alone in the
bathroom and the door started to open by itself.&nbsp; I politely told
"Bob" (that is what I nicknamed my ghost) to please leave me alone, that
I was tired and the door immediately stopped.</b>
<br><b>Several other instances happened to where I would wake up in the
middle of the night with objects such as my clock and my husbands breathing
machine being taken off of the nightstands and being placed on the floor
with out disturbing the coverlet on the nightstands (in other words there
was no way these objects were falling off).&nbsp; I finally decided to
call and have my title traced so I could find out who he was.&nbsp; The
first call I made to the department I spoke to a lady named Angie who told
me she would research it and call me back in a few days.&nbsp; A week went
by and when I called the department back and told them Angie was helping
me they said there was never an Angie that worked for them.&nbsp; This
happened twice to me until I finally decided that "Bob" wanted to remain
unknown.&nbsp; In February, 2000, I found out I was pregnant with my second
daughter.&nbsp; As soon as I found out the "hauntings" stopped.&nbsp; We
sold our house that summer and moved away.&nbsp; Our new house has no "others"
living here to my knowledge.</b>

<br><b>Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: patcat87@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Back in 1972 my family moved into a house on Upland ave., in Fontana
CA.</b>
<br><b>The house was haunted. Just after that the house at the other end
of the</b>
<br><b>street also became haunted. I'll start with the house down the street.
I was</b>
<br><b>friendly with the woman that lived in that house. She had a Passion
for</b>
<br><b>gardening. The house is or was on the courner of the street. In
front on 2</b>
<br><b>sides along the both streets were 2 flower beds. I would see her
out side</b>
<br><b>caring for the flowers. I think in 1973 she died. I saw an ambulance
out in</b>
<br><b>front of the house one day. I just thought she got sick. Later one
of the</b>
<br><b>boys that lived on the street told me she had died. At the time
I didn't</b>
<br><b>beleive Him, because I had seen her just the day before taking care
of her</b>
<br><b>flowers and the ambulance had been there about a week before. The
next thing</b>
<br><b>that happen was one day I was walking past the house and I saw a
woman</b>
<br><b>tending the gardens out front.I stop to say hello to her. To me
she looked</b>
<br><b>just like the womon that had lived there all along. I told her I
was glad</b>
<br><b>that she was better. She told me that she had not been sick and
that she had</b>
<br><b>just moved in. I don't know if I ever saw her again. A couple of
years later</b>
<br><b>a family with a boy moved in to that house.In the mean time I was
still</b>
<br><b>seeing the first woman from time to time. I didn't know at the time
that a</b>
<br><b>family had moved in. I saw the boy in the drive way playing with
a ball.I</b>
<br><b>told him that the woman that lived in the house would not like him
playing</b>
<br><b>with the gate open and that she would be mad about it. He then told
me that</b>
<br><b>he live in the house and could play in the drive way if he whated
to. I then</b>
<br><b>Pointed out that the woman was in the window watching him and that
she</b>
<br><b>looked mad to me. He then look at the window and saw the woman,
turn white,</b>
<br><b>started to run around to the front of the house yelling for his
father.</b>
<br><b>Later that year the woman that lived next door stop me to talk to
me about</b>
<br><b>the house.She told me that the first woman had died years before.She
also</b>
<br><b>told me that all the women that had live there since 1972 had all
gotten</b>
<br><b>sick. She told me that she had seen the woman in the window also
and she</b>
<br><b>though that she was mad because the other women keeped taking out
the</b>
<br><b>flowers she put in. Also the flowers where started to grow in to
her</b>
<br><b>yard.Later they put up a very high fence so that they would not
be able to</b>
<br><b>see the window from there yard.Her husband(the neighbor) told me
later that</b>
<br><b>his wife was sick.He also wanted to know if I knew of any thing
that could</b>
<br><b>be done about what was happening next door. Plus that they were
moving. In</b>
<br><b>1979 I told my DR. that I though the house my mother had lived in
was what</b>
<br><b>made her sick. He asked me where she had been living at that time.I
told him</b>
<br><b>on Upland ave.He then ask if the house was on the courner and why
he was</b>
<br><b>asking me.He said that the first woman that had lived there had
died of</b>
<br><b>cancer and so did the next 2 women that lived there( of the same
cancer).</b>
<br><b>The young mother of the boy did not died of the cancer that she
got but that</b>
<br><b>she was still very sick because of her treatment for it. He also
told me</b>
<br><b>that the frist owners of the house was not the first woman.He told
me that</b>
<br><b>the town did know what to do with the house as they didn't what
any more</b>
<br><b>women to live there because they where all getting the same cancer.I
told</b>
<br><b>him about the first woman and that she didn't like any one to mess
with her</b>
<br><b>flowers. He did say that the town might make it in to a park.I said
that it</b>
<br><b>might work but she would probably not like it and that others could
still</b>
<br><b>get sick.I have how idea what happened&nbsp; because I move out
of town not long</b>
<br><b>after that.I'll save the House we lived in for later.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghosts On Nan's And Grandpa's Farmhouse</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: acshmidt@optusnet.com.au</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was young I used to visit my Nan's and Grandpa's often on
there farm near Kempsey, NSW, Australia.The farm had been in the family
for several generations until Nan and Grandpa sold it because they were
to old to run. It was a good place to spend some of our school holidays,
there was plenty to do for us Kids (there were Me, My sister, My brother
and 4 cousins but the cousins didn't visit as much). But there was something
about the old house that none of us knew until it was sold. The house was
normal to look at and was like all the rest of the houses built in that
time. When you entered the house it seemed normal, but the childrens bedroom
that was opposite the main bedroom was always colder than the rest of the
house. Anyway many of us children had to sleep there, most of us including
me and one of my cousins have said that when they slept in the room have
often felt they have not been alone when physicaly there the only one's
in the room. On other memorable nights there were snatches of slured conversation,
my brother described it as if someone was trying to talk to you but the
speach was so slured that you could not describe it. One weekend while
helping grandpa mustering I was walking from the front verandah to the
kitchen to find nan and as I pased the bedroom I noticed someone(female)
standing near the ironing board(Nan did the ironing here) I thaught nothing
of it and kept on walking, but as I got near the kitchen I remembered thet
nan was in the garden and took afew steps backwards to the bedroom door
and the figur had vanished and I tell you now that was frightening for
me. To go with the talking at night I also saw things fliter across to
room(no objects but like someone running) while Iwas reading and on some
ocasions I felt uncomfortable as if an old man was in a full on stare at
me. Anyway these events freaked me somuch that on one occasion(my mum and
dad had come to visit) I stated to cry when mum said I wasn't going to
go home till the next weekend but I wouldn't stop crying until mum said
I could go home(to this day I don't know why I stated to cry I think it
was just so I could get out of there). Anyway after the farm was sold Mum,
my brother and I were having a conversation about something and the hauntings
came up. It was only then did I realise that others had experienced these
ocurences. There were three reasons for these ocurences:</b>
<br><b>1 was that we all had wild imaginations including some older people.</b>
<br><b>2 was that we all had been visited by one of my relativies that
was droped on her head when she was young but lived as a mentally retarded
woman till she was 30. Which would explain the slured speach and the vision.</b>
<br><b>Number 3 explains the sence of a man near and also the slured voice.
You see grandpa's grandpa died of a stroke.</b>
<br><b>Or matbe it's both of them having a conversation like they would
have had when they were alive.</b>

awakened by the same thing.</b>

<br><b>Ghost?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lilsmeds@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>>From reading several of the stories on this particular</b>
<br><b>website I have come to believe that I too may have had</b>
<br><b>encounters with a ghost. This is not necessarily a</b>
<br><b>scary story, but a curious one.</b>
<br><b>I grew up in Clay, NY just outside of Syracuse. The</b>
<br><b>house we lived in was not very old, in fact we were</b>
<br><b>only the second owners of the house. I lived there</b>
<br><b>until I was 12 years old.</b>
<br><b>My first strange encounter occurred when I was only 4</b>
<br><b>years old.&nbsp; I was asleep in my room on a cot. It was a</b>
<br><b>transition from crib to bed. The foot of the cot was</b>
<br><b>facing the door.&nbsp; I awoke and suddenly sat up in my</b>
<br><b>bed. I noticed a face of a man that appeared to be at</b>
<br><b>the top of my open door.&nbsp; I could not make out any</b>
<br><b>body to the face but I was immediately very frightened</b>
<br><b>and I pulled the covers over my head.&nbsp; I did not dare</b>
<br><b>to look to see if the face had vanished. To this day I</b>
<br><b>sleep with the covers over my head out of habit and I</b>
<br><b>am 23 years old.</b>
<br><b>Throughout the time that we lived there I would often</b>
<br><b>awake in the middle of the night to hear my name being</b>
<br><b>called. I never told my family about those occurences.</b>
<br><b>Years later, I happened to be asking my mother about</b>
<br><b>the house (after we had moved) and she told me that</b>
<br><b>she would hear her name being called as well. My older</b>
<br><b>brother reported the same thing that day. In the same</b>
<br><b>sitting she told me a story that I had heard before</b>
<br><b>but she never did tell me the ending until that day.</b>
<br><b>My mother returned home from running errands.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>brothers and I were in school and my father was still</b>
<br><b>at work. Almost immediately after she stepped in the</b>
<br><b>house she heard a door in the house slam. It was</b>
<br><b>winter at the time, so no windows were open to account</b>
<br><b>for it. She left quite quickly to get a neighbor to</b>
<br><b>help her investigate the house. They never did find</b>
<br><b>anything. I never thought to ask my mother which door</b>
<br><b>had been slammed until that day.&nbsp; She looked at me and</b>
<br><b>said "Yours". Needless to say I was a bit disturbed by</b>
<br><b>this.</b>
<br><b>Around the time that my father announced we were</b>
<br><b>moving to Ohio, I started hearing tapping.&nbsp; I could</b>
<br><b>not for the life of me figure out what it was. It</b>
<br><b>seemed to generate from my little brothers room, which</b>
<br><b>was next to mine, but they seemed to stop or fade when</b>
<br><b>I investigated. I must have picked up every single</b>
<br><b>loose object to see if, when I slammed it down, it</b>
<br><b>made the same noise I had been hearing.</b>
<br><b>Also, now that I think of it, things would disappear.</b>
<br><b>My barbies would be missing and then appear on the</b>
<br><b>floor. I thought that this was just my brothers</b>
<br><b>playing a joke on me. One time though, a watch that I</b>
<br><b>had been given for christmas was missing.&nbsp; I searched</b>
<br><b>the entire room, to no avail. One year later, almost</b>
<br><b>to the day, my friend and I were going to play chinese</b>
<br><b>checkers and as I opened the box, I saw the watch.</b>
<br><b>There is no reason I would have randomly left it</b>
<br><b>there.</b>
<br><b>The only other strange experience occurred over time.</b>
<br><b>I would often have a reoccuring dream in which a man</b>
<br><b>in his mid forties was trying to get in through my</b>
<br><b>bedroom window. I would wake up right before he got</b>
<br><b>the window open.&nbsp; The last night I spent in the house</b>
<br><b>I had the same dream only it had a different ending.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly as the man was trying to get in, a door</b>
<br><b>appeared next to the window and he came in. He told me</b>
<br><b>not to be frightened. He sat down at my desk and there</b>
<br><b>appeared a woman and a small child. He said that he</b>
<br><b>just wanted to say goodbye, that his family would miss</b>
<br><b>me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Later my mother told me that she thinks that she saw</b>
<br><b>shadows moving in the kitchen while she was there</b>
<br><b>alone. I am not sure what was going on since the house</b>
<br><b>was so new. I can just assume that it had to do with</b>
<br><b>the land it was built on. The field across the street</b>
<br><b>from my development was being excavated so they could</b>
<br><b>build a new development. In the process the local</b>
<br><b>neighbor kids would bring wheelbarrows full of stuff</b>
<br><b>such as old china, old glass bottles, etc. Quite</b>
<br><b>possibly the land had other houses on it long before</b>
<br><b>ours which may account for my experiences.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghostly Cottage</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nmezic@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My ghostly experiences started when I moved into my aunt's house.
I had been</b>
<br><b>living there maybe a couple of weeks when I heard my first ghostly
sound. I</b>
<br><b>was in bed, it was around midnight and I was home alone, my bedroom
is right</b>
<br><b>next to the kitchen so I can hear anything that goes on in there
clearly.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, I had been in bed about 10 minutes and was relaxed but definately</b>
<br><b>not asleep when I heard a bottle or glass shatter in the kitchen.
I sat</b>
<br><b>there in bed deciding whether or not I should clean up the glass
for about</b>
<br><b>20 minutes but since I was comfortable I put it off. The next day
I walked</b>
<br><b>into the kitchen expecting to see glass all over the floor but there
was</b>
<br><b>nothing!!!</b>
<br><b>About a month later I was watching TV when the room suddenly got
very chilly</b>
<br><b>and I saw a swirl of light similar to what you see if you draw in
the air</b>
<br><b>with a sparkler. At first I thought my contacts were dirty &amp;
therefore</b>
<br><b>responsible but then I saw it again closer and closer until it was
right in</b>
<br><b>front of my face. I never saw anything like that from dirty contacts
or</b>
<br><b>again for that matter. Coincidentally, my neighbor had died that
same day,</b>
<br><b>could the light swirl have been her checking me out?</b>
<br><b>The next thing was experienced by my boyfriend and I. We were sitting
in the</b>
<br><b>living room when we heard the dishes rattling in the sink. I had
recently</b>
<br><b>gotten cats so I thought one of them was licking the dishes in the
sink. I</b>
<br><b>jumped up to yell but when I went into the kitchen the sound stopped
and</b>
<br><b>upon looking into the living room I noticed both cats asleep. This
happened</b>
<br><b>several times that night, once right behind my boyfriend while he
was</b>
<br><b>standing in the kitchen.</b>
<br><b>Last week my boyfriend was home alone sleeping on the couch. He
woke up and</b>
<br><b>looked at the back of the couch. Sitting there was a mangled looking
orange</b>
<br><b>cat which promptly jumped down and disappeared before it hit the
floor. That</b>
<br><b>same night 3 bags of chips flew off the refridgerator &amp; really
freaked my</b>
<br><b>boyfriend out. The same cat appeared again a couple days ago, it
was</b>
<br><b>sniffing my cat Loki and Loki was looking at it, then it disappeared.
When</b>
<br><b>my aunt lived in the house before us she had an orange cat that
had</b>
<br><b>disappeared, could the ghost cat be hers?</b>
<br><b>Other things have happened to including my boyfriend &amp; I both
seeing people</b>
<br><b>out of the corner of our eyes. We've both heard disembodied voices
as well.</b>
<br><b>If anyone wants to write me about any of this feel free.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Hello, my name is Angela. as a child I always thought&nbsp; I&nbsp;
seen and heard</b>
<br><b>ghosts in the house I grew up in. my sisters did to. I think being
older that</b>
<br><b>maybe it was our father that might have did alot of&nbsp; trying
to scare us, but</b>
<br><b>deep down I know it was somthing else.I would always feel some presents</b>
<br><b>around me. some times alone in my bed room at night I would feel
the side of</b>
<br><b>my bed slowly move down as if someone sat on it. and I was always
by my self</b>
<br><b>laying perfectly still. so I know it wasn't me moving. my closet
light would</b>
<br><b>turn on by it's self . somtimes we would sleep in the living room
and I would</b>
<br><b>awake to a monster face in front of mine. so yes I would say I believe
in</b>
<br><b>ghosts or what ever it was. but now I have a daughter that is five
years old</b>
<br><b>and every night at the same times she wakes up and talks in her
sleep.</b>
<br><b>somtimes she talks to family but for the most part she talks to
someone or</b>
<br><b>something. she sounds scared and crys no I don't want to or I can't
go. one</b>
<br><b>night she was doing this so I went in to her room to calm her down
the hole</b>
<br><b>time she was sitting up in her bed and would'nt stop looking and
pointing at</b>
<br><b>the wall across from the bed. she asked me if I see the kids I said
no, she</b>
<br><b>said they were girls and that they were nice so I of course got
scared and</b>
<br><b>put her in my room. she only get's like this in her bed know where

<br><b>a few weeks before all of this I was sleeping on the couch I was
woke up by</b>

<br><b>THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS GHOST</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ralee@iolky.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was a child and woke in the middle of the night, I would hear
all kinds of sounds, the slightest of movement had to be something unknown
or a gggghooost!&nbsp; I would start off with a low whimper.&nbsp; Daaaddy,
daaaddy.&nbsp; Then if no response I would get a little louder.&nbsp; Daaaddy!&nbsp;
Daaaddy!&nbsp; Dad's must sleep with one ear open when they have a house
full of kids and one is in need. What is it son?&nbsp;&nbsp; I would hear
him say.&nbsp; Daaddy there's a ghost in here.&nbsp; Now son, there's no
such thing as ghost, now go back to sleep.&nbsp; Since my dad said there
is no such thing as ghost, then I guess there's no such thing as ghost.</b>
<br><b>I was in the Air Force and had been living in North Biloxi, Mississippi
for a few years with a side business mowing yards.&nbsp; My reputation
of doing a good job was keeping me busier than I really wanted to be, being
young with two small children,&nbsp; I liked making that extra money.&nbsp;
My business took in several surrounding communities and I was doing yard
work for one of the past owners of Paramount Pictures, a steel tycoon from
Chicago, a grand old southern lady, just like you see in the movies, and
twenty eight other yard owners.</b>
<br><b>A doctor from New Orleans phoned one evening to discuss maintaining
property he owned in the North Biloxi area.&nbsp; In a few days I met with
him on the tip of a beautiful peninsula where stood a new two story beach
home.&nbsp; He gave me a little history on the place, where the new house
now stood was the site of a large old plantation home that had been in
his family for well over 200 years.&nbsp; Camille, a record breaking hurricane
of 1969 completely destroyed the home.&nbsp; The yard was a mess, and had
not been mowed for some time, resembling a hay field more than a yard.&nbsp;
We agreed to a price for the first time clean up to get it in shape, then
a price to maintain it every two weeks.</b>
<br><b>Two weeks earlier I had purchased a 42 inch Simplicity mower, a
lot of money for the time, early 1970's, over $2000 and I was proud of
it.&nbsp; I freed up a Saturday morning knowing it would take me at least
the morning to complete the yard.&nbsp; With my new mower's capability
of picking up and packing sixteen bushels of grass, it wouldn't take long.&nbsp;
Since no one lived in the house I started before 7 a.m..&nbsp; After picking
up everything I could see in the yard, I for sure didn't want to hit anything
with the new mower, I started.&nbsp; Didn't get far, had a flat.&nbsp;
Took the wheel off the mower, took it to a local service station, removed
the tire from the rim, couldn't find a hole in the tire anywhere.&nbsp;
Air it up, back to the yard.&nbsp; Two more flats, same result.&nbsp; To
top that, one of the belts kept coming off, more time, more time and more
time wasted.</b>
<br><b>It was now mid afternoon, 107 degree temperature, and I hadn't even
started to trim. These were the days before the weed eater, so the trimming
had to be done with a&nbsp; push mower and hand clippers.&nbsp; Grabbing
one of the lawn mowers,&nbsp; I started to trim.&nbsp; I began to trim
around the remains of a foundation where once stood a small house. I suddenly&nbsp;
became very chilled, big goose bumps covered my entire body, I could see
my breath, I became scared, I didn't even know what it was I was scared
of.&nbsp; The mower I was using, stopped.&nbsp; I moved quickly away from
the spot where I was standing.&nbsp; I knew I should load up and get out
of there, but I also knew I needed to finish the yard.&nbsp; Everything
now seem so much different, I was spooked.&nbsp; Shadows of the trees were
stretching across the yard with the breeze off the Gulf making them move
in a eerie dance.&nbsp; With my heart beating fast, I quicken the pace
to finish.&nbsp; I could not get the mower to start, I took another off
the truck and started to trim not where I left off,&nbsp; but another part
of the yard.&nbsp; It was getting late with the shadows growing even longer,
to finish I had to cut the high grass around the foundation.&nbsp; Reluctantly
I closed in on the foundation.&nbsp; Again a cold blast hit me, sending
shivers up my back, I was freezing and the mower stopped running.&nbsp;
This time without hesitation I loaded the truck and drove away.&nbsp; As
I locked the gate, I knew this would be my first and last time to work
in this yard.</b>
<br><b>It took some time for me to calm down after the experience.&nbsp;
My wife listen patiently as I told her the details of the day.&nbsp; She
never told and I didn't ask what she actually thought of that part of the
story, a few days later she got to hear the rest of the story, we both
did.</b>
<br><b>I phoned the doctor to tell him that I had finished the yard and
he would have to find someone else to do the yard on a regular basics.&nbsp;
He asked why wouldn't I continue.&nbsp; I told him I would explain when
he came up the following week.&nbsp; I met with him about midday the following
Saturday, as we walked around the yard I explained the events of the previous
Saturday,&nbsp; surprisingly he listen without changing expression.&nbsp;
He then began to tell me that the foundation was all that remained of the
home of an eighty year plus old black man.&nbsp; This man was the last
of his family to live on the old plantation, his ancestors and his ancestors
before them had lived on the plantation as slaves.&nbsp; The doctor's family
had always owned the plantation and his ancestors had always treated their
slaves with respect and dignity.&nbsp; When the slaves were freed, this
family stayed and worked at the plantation.&nbsp; The old gentleman was
the last and receiving the news of Camille heading toward the Mississippi
coast did not bother him at all, he had lived on the same spot all his
life and had seen many hurricanes, and this one would be no different.&nbsp;
He refused to leave.&nbsp; Camille hit the with a savage, the plantation
old house and the old man's home was completely destroyed, the old man's
body was never found.</b>
<br><b>To get to the tip of the peninsula you had to go through a subdivision,
a tall fence and large gate separated the two.&nbsp; The doctor told me
of the sightings of the old black gentleman walking around the yard by
the residents of the subdivision.&nbsp; A figure of the man, not really
the man, but a ghostly figure of&nbsp; him.&nbsp; Some even said as they
watch, the figure would just disappear.&nbsp; I was the first person to
do any kind of yard work on the grounds of the old plantation house, other
than the man's family.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you explain all the trouble I
had?&nbsp; I never had it before and I never had it after that yard.&nbsp;
I think the old man just didn't like anyone working in his yard.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Getting Down To Science</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Lisa@Citynet.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I think everything could possibly be explained, but, This is a little
story of a husband watching over his family.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My father in law passed away with lung cancer in Feb of 97.
My daughter was born late Mar of 96. She was 11 mos when he passed and
about 2 when this happened. First, my mother in law would ask us ( me &amp;
my husband) if one of us had stopped by in the night. All of her 4 children
have a key. No body fesses up. She would hear somebody in the kitchen and
in the refridgerator. It wasnt unusal for one of her daughters to come
and sleep there since her work was close and she lived 20 min away. After
nobody would admit to being there she started investigating noises. she
never found a source. His favorite dog would growl at the door of the bedroom
that he died in. With my daughter, I took her with me to care for the dogs
while my mother in law was out of town, upon leaving she told me about
talking to 'the man'. I didn't think much of it because she has a couple
imaginary friends. When she told me the man said " give me that, that's
mine" Chill ran through me. That how dad used to play with the children,
trying to take their toy or what have you. Since she was 11 mos when he
died and he was sick her enitre life. I really don't think he ever played
with her. Mom re married and the noises have stopped. whenever I take her
I always ask her if she had seen the man and she hasn't.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Wierd Duplex</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ahoosier@email.msn.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>About 20 years ago I took a job in a small NM company and rented
a small 2</b>
<br><b>bedroom half of a duplex. Once my wife, my cat and I had moved in
we found a</b>
<br><b>few things wierd about the place. No amount of "fixing" by the landlord
would</b>
<br><b>let any heat go into the back bedroom, OK so we used it as a storage
room. We</b>
<br><b>also noted that the wall in the hall next to the room was always
cold and a</b>
<br><b>little creepy, but it wasn't until we noticed the cat hugging the
opposite</b>
<br><b>wall of the hall to get to the bathroom for his litter box that
we started to</b>
<br><b>wonder what was up.</b>
<br><b>While we lived there we just ignored what was going on and let it
alone. We</b>
<br><b>moved a year later after the job finished. A couple of years later
when</b>
<br><b>visiting we noticed the old house was gone and a new apartment complex
was</b>
<br><b>there instead. After asking about the old place and if the old owners
were</b>
<br><b>around we learned when they tore down the old place because no-one
would live</b>
<br><b>there for very long and the old owner sold out.</b>
<br><b>When they tore the place down they found where one of the past owner's</b>
<br><b>missing wife was buried. Right under the same bedroom! She has been
properly</b>
<br><b>buried and stalks the place no longer.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghost Story from a Pagan</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: time_girl_14@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I'm a pagan and I have believed in ghosts and the paranormal my entire
life.</b>
<br><b>I wish to remain known as only 'Moonwing Tree' so please don't send
back to</b>
<br><b>me asking for a first name. Onto what I am writing this for though.
While my</b>
<br><b>experinces have happened to me day and night the two that I'm going
to share</b>
<br><b>with you now happened at night.</b>
<br><b>Here is my first story. This one is a recurring one that I have
gotten</b>
<br><b>rather used to. At night, when I am laying down to go to bed, or
even when I</b>
<br><b>am watching a movie, even with my friends around once it passes
11 at night</b>
<br><b>the sound of feet can be heard running back and fourth across my
kitchen. On</b>
<br><b>occasion it will stop at my bedroom door and knock on the door if
it is</b>
<br><b>closed or knock on the door frame if it is open. Now, I cannot blame
this on</b>
<br><b>pets because I don't have any, my parents can't move that fast and
even if</b>
<br><b>they could why wouldn't I be able to see them when the door is open,
and my</b>
<br><b>little brother is out of the question because he's not even gutsey
enough to</b>
<br><b>climb out of his bed until it is well past sunrise. I'm very used
to this</b>
<br><b>visitor and hope it remains as long as I remain here.</b>
<br><b>The second is an occurence that has only happened a few times since
I</b>
<br><b>rearranged my room. My bed is now closer to my desk than ever and
since we</b>
<br><b>have moved it I'll be laying in bed well past midnight just staring
at my</b>
<br><b>ceiling, suddenly I'll hear the faint sound of clicink, like typing,
the</b>
<br><b>longer I lay there listening the louder it gets and once I look
over at the</b>
<br><b>computer it stops, I look the other way and once again it begins.
Now, the</b>
<br><b>computer I have is second hand, we've had it for along time and
I don't know</b>
<br><b>who the recent owner was, but it is the only object in my room that
can</b>
<br><b>produce the typing sound I've heard at night.</b><b></b>

<p><b>House Full of History</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: guitarguru00@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I live in Dothan Alabama.&nbsp;
The house I live in has a lot of history.&nbsp; It has always been in the
family.&nbsp; My grandfather's parents built it upon moving from Headland,
just north of Dothan, making the house somewhere in the 100 year old range.&nbsp;
It has antiquity written all over it.&nbsp; Well, nothing weird started
happening until about 2 weeks before we got ready to move in to the house
after my mother's father passed away.&nbsp; I was only about 9 and my cousin
and I were playing across the street at his house.&nbsp; We decided that
we would come and check out how far the contractors had gotten on renovating
the house.&nbsp; We walked up to the front porch to find a wet paint sign
on the doorstep.&nbsp; I glanced up and noticed a rocking chair on the
porch.&nbsp; Even at 9 years old I knew that it was weird for a rocking
chair to be on a freshly painted porch.&nbsp; Shortly after I looked up
the chair rocked a little bit and footprints began to appear in the wet
grey paint.&nbsp; My cousin saw it as well.&nbsp; He turned white as sounds
of guitar playing filled the air from within the house.&nbsp; My grandfather
used to play guitar on Saturday afternoons to pass the time.&nbsp; We just
looked at each other because we both knew that all the contractors were
outside and there wasn't anyone inside.&nbsp; I never had anything like
that happen again until I was in 8th grade and I started learning to play
guitar myself.&nbsp; I was playing some blues in my room one night when
I felt a tremendous chill overtake my room.&nbsp; I figured something must
be wrong with the heat but the heat was on 75 and I could feel the hot
air coming from the floor vent by my bed.&nbsp; I looked on my bed and
saw an indention impress close to the foot.&nbsp; My room was situated
where my grandfather's once was.&nbsp; I watched as the indention eventually
vanished.&nbsp; I felt a cool pass of cool air over my face and over my
back almost as if my grandfather patted me on the back and pinched my cheek
like he always used to do.&nbsp; I haven't had any encounters recently
that I've been playing in a band but I'm sure my grandfather will let me
know he's here when he's ready.</b>

<p><b>Ghost Girl</b><b></b>
<p><b>BY: chick_0109@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, my name is Sabrina and my friend Angel and I have a pretty weird
tale.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were sitting in our living room (we are
room mates and best friends) when the dream catchers we have hanging on
the wall started to swing. The windows were closed and it was the middle
of summer so the heat wasn't on. The only thing we had on was the air conditioner
which was in the other room.&nbsp; We got up and started looking around
for a logical explination when the lights went out. We screamed and headed
for the door when we felt like someone was watching us. I turned around
and saw a little girl around the age of three looking at us. I poked Angel
and she turned around and screamed. We left and didn't return for a few
days. We didn't see anything for about 2 weeks after we came back. The
night that we did was really scary. We were sitting in the living room
watching the show *FREAKY LINKS*. I went to get a drink, the girl was standing
right beside the sink. I looked at her and didn't move. She stared at me
and began to walk towards the living room. I called Angel's name</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ghost went into Angel's bedroom and started throwing
her stuff out of the drawers and messing everything up.&nbsp; I ran back
to the living room and woke Angel. We went to her room and all we saw was
the mess. No ghost. At first Angel thought I made the mess to piss her
off. She soon found out that it was the girl when she woke up to her stuff
being thrown out the window by an invisible force.&nbsp; She got pretty
upset so we decided to look up some info on our house. It was a two storey
three bedroom house that was from the early nineteen hundreds. We contacted
our landlord and got the records of the old residents. We found out that
there was only one family that had kids. Well a kid. Her name was Mary
and she was three years old. She dissapeared and was never seen again.
The only photo of her was the one we found in our basement.&nbsp; She was
wearing the same dress that she was wearing when we saw her. it was deffinatley
the same girl!</b><b></b>

<p><b>I've wanted to share this experience for a while now.&nbsp; This
happened</b>
<br><b>while married to my first wife/&nbsp; We lived in Jenkins, Kentucky
(in the</b>
<br><b>eastern Kentucky mountains near Hazzard) for five months; October,
1985</b>
<br><b>though March, 1986.&nbsp; The event occured in November, 1985, I
think.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>lived in her grandparent's (father's side) house/trailer back in
Camdon</b>
<br><b>Hollow (pronouned hollar, of course), across the road from her other</b>
<br><b>grandfather (mother's side).&nbsp; We slept in the add-on built
into the</b>
<br><b>trailer.&nbsp; At night spmetimes you could hear heavy booted foot
steps in</b>
<br><b>the trailer and muffled voices in the back room of the trailer (next
to</b>
<br><b>the bathroom).&nbsp; We had just gone to bed and turned out the
light on the</b>
<br><b>bed's headboard,&nbsp; My wife fell asleep quickly while I lay there
waiting</b>
<br><b>for sleep to come.&nbsp; The room was illuminated by the glow of
our coal</b>
<br><b>stove.&nbsp; I was looking at hte foot of the bed on her side when
suddenly a</b>
<br><b>human shaped shadow appeared and bent over my wife then disappeared..&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>was reaching for the light when my wife beat me to it.&nbsp; I thought
she</b>
<br><b>had seen it too but it turned out she had a really bad nose bleed.</b>
<br><b>After the bleeding was under control she said she had had a dream
about</b>
<br><b>her grandmother (mother's side, dead ten years), who told her to
wake up</b>
<br><b>as she had a nose bleed and was getting the sheet a mess!&nbsp;
When I asked</b>

<p><b>Ghost Encounter</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: pdb1951@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I recently came across your site and thougtht it is very well done.
I am</b>
<br><b>submitting an experience that both my oldest brother and i experienced.&nbsp;
In</b>
<br><b>October of 1981 i moved from Houston, Texas to St Petersburg, Florida
and</b>
<br><b>moved in with my eldest brother who was 36 yrs old at the time and
i was 30.</b>
<br><b>It was a small one bedroom apt. in a small apt. complex of around
20 units.</b>
<br><b>His bedroom was in the back of the apt. and i slept on the sleeper
sofa in the living room.</b>
<br><b>Almost immediately I sensed that something just wasn't right. I
couldn't put my finger on it, but</b>
<br><b>there was just something!&nbsp; I'd catch glimpes out the</b>
<br><b>corner of my eye of something, but when i'd turn towards where i
had just</b>
<br><b>glimped something, nothing was ever there. This went on for weeks.
Also at</b>
<br><b>the same time, when i would go to the bathroom at night, through
the</b>
<br><b>ventilation fan, i could hear what sounded to be, as an old man
severly</b>
<br><b>coughing. This went on every night and after a couple of weeks i
finely</b>
<br><b>decided to go to the apt. under us to see if i could be of some
help for the</b>
<br><b>poor old guy. He was obviously in dire straits. Well, to my surprise,
when i</b>
<br><b>knocked on the door, a young man answered. I then proceeded to ask
if his</b>
<br><b>Dad or Granddad was okay? He gave me this puzzled look and informed
me that</b>
<br><b>only his wife and small baby lived there with him. I told him as
was sorry</b>
<br><b>to have bothered him and left, wondering whether i was going nuts
or what!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I finally mentioned this to my brother
and he looked at me and</b>
<br><b>said"you, too!" That's when things really started getting interesting!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few weeks later, i had pulled
out the sofabed and was nodding off</b>
<br><b>to sleep after a short while. I had the covers pulled up to my neck
with</b>
<br><b>both hands holding them, when suddenly they were yanked halfway
off the bed!</b>
<br><b>Needless to say i was startled! I jumped up, turned on the light
and there</b>
<br><b>was nothing there! I walked down to my brothers room and as i stepped</b>
<br><b>inside, it was ice cold! I woke him and told him what had just happened
and</b>
<br><b>he informed me that when i woke him he was dreaming that something
was after</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As i was leaving his</b>
<br><b>room, starting down the hallway (with light still on in the livingroom
area)</b>
<br><b>I saw in the center of the hall what was a round dark shadow that
got darker</b>
<br><b>towards the center of itself, but you could see right through it!
I went</b>
<br><b>back into my brothers room and told him what i saw, he got up and
when we</b>
<br><b>got back to the hall, it was gone! I was off work the next day and
was</b>
<br><b>watching the idiot box when i heard rustling noises coming from
the back</b>
<br><b>room. I went to investigate and again, the room was cold! I noticed
that the</b>
<br><b>curtains were moving and checked to see if the window was open.
It was shut</b>
<br><b>tight! So i put my hand up to the air duct and no air was coming
out! I said</b>
<br><b>to myself, f... this! I'm moving!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got with Ron, my brother,
that night and we both agreed that it</b>
<br><b>was a good idea. We found another apt. comepletely on the other
side of</b>
<br><b>town!&nbsp; We had the power transferred to the new apt. and the
power to ghost</b>
<br><b>central was cut off, so that we had to use candles while moving,
for light.</b>
<br><b>I had to work that night, so Ron had to do the bulk of the moving
himself.</b>
<br><b>We had most of it boxed up and i was off to work!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let me say</b>
<br><b>this now...Ron is one big guy and there's not much that scares him....but</b>
<br><b>that night, he came screaming up to my place of work and i ran up,
because</b>
<br><b>something was obviously wrong!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When i looked in the van</b>
<br><b>at him, he was white as a, well, you know. His eyes where bloodshot
and he</b>
<br><b>was scare s...less.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I asked him what happened and</b>
<br><b>he told me that all the candles where lit as he was moving some
of the final</b>
<br><b>boxes. He went to his bedroom to get one out of there, and as before,
the</b>
<br><b>room was very cold! He picked the box up and as he left the room,
the candle</b>
<br><b>went out! As he went by the bathroom, that candle went out! As did
the</b>
<br><b>kithcen as he passed. There in the living room he saw the same round
shadow</b>
<br><b>in mid air as i had. He kind of slid around it and was out the front
door,</b>
<br><b>put down the box to grab his keys to lock the door. When he turned
to the</b>
<br><b>door, it slammed in his face and the deadbolt locked itself! He
grabbed the</b>
<br><b>doorknob and he said it was as if someone had sprayed freon on it!
Needless</b>
<br><b>to say, we never went back and we left stuff there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That very night we stopped at a Country
Kitchen and we were trying to</b>
<br><b>figure out what in the world was this thing and why was it pissed
at us?</b>
<br><b>After lengthy conversation Ron told me about his exwife whom he
had stole</b>
<br><b>from some guy in his late 50s. She had lived in that apt. with Ron
and thats</b>
<br><b>the last address that that guy had for her. The man had died if
throat</b>
<br><b>cancer earlier that month.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Do you think</b>
<br><b>it could have been him looking for her or trying to get even with
Ron?</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I know for the next two</b>
<br><b>months looking for that thing to show up at our new residence, but
, it</b>
<br><b>never did.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Mean Old Drunken Dead Man</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mailto:Soshysofine@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi my name is Mandy and this is my story I hope you like!&nbsp; We
(Mom, sister,</b>
<br><b>me) had just moved into our new apt and everything was fine for
a while.&nbsp; When</b>
<br><b>one night my Mom was out and my sister had 2 of her friends over
and I had one, my</b>
<br><b>friend had, had spiritual experiences in the past. we were all sleeping
out in the</b>
<br><b>living room on our couch that folded out into a bed, it was weird
(cause you know how</b>
<br><b>your supposed to wake up if a spirit is watching you) cause we all
woke up at the</b>
<br><b>Same time and from the living room we could hear the closet doors
in my moms room</b>
<br><b>opening and then shutting really fast, and the heater was on all
night and it</b>
<br><b>was almost cold enough to see your breath.&nbsp; My sister who didn't
believe in this</b>
<br><b>stuff got up to turn on a light right next to the couch and when
she tried to turn it</b>
<br><b>on it blew out with a weird really bright green light, my sister
being how stupid she is</b>
<br><b>most the time tried to turn it on again and it blew out again with
not such and</b>
<br><b>intense green light. it was about 3 in the morning then and it became
bright out at about 6</b>
<br><b>so we just waited until it was light out and finally got out of
bed, from then on I</b>
<br><b>felt really scared in my house I could just sense him and it scared
me. About a month</b>
<br><b>later me and two of my friends were at my house, and one of my friends
brought over a</b>
<br><b>camera she was just carrying it around by the string when it took
a picture</b>
<br><b>all by its self, and then we were walking around the house and all
of a sudden there</b>
<br><b>would be a cold spot and then it would be gone, then my friends
camera took another</b>
<br><b>picture all by itself. I had had enough of this and I wanted it
to end, so I went on</b>
<br><b>AOL and went into a psychic chat room and asked if anyone could
help, and I got an IM</b>
<br><b>and the lady told me he was a man in his 30's who was a drunk and
didn't like</b>
<br><b>kids (that explains why he would act up around my friends and I)
and she told me he was</b>
<br><b>by the window, then I thought I'm by the window, just then i felt
2 taps on my</b>
<br><b>right shoulder and I asked my friends if they did it and they said
no they weren't</b>
<br><b>close enough to do it anyway. Then he pulled back on my friends
chair, the lady</b>
<br><b>told my to pray for my guides in gods name and I did 5 times and
she told me there were</b>
<br><b>5 guides fighting him, and then she told me he was gone, me and&nbsp;
my friends</b>
<br><b>were just sitting here astonished when we saw little balls of light
on the walls</b>
<br><b>different colors and I asked the lady what they were and she said
they were my guides. I was</b>
<br><b>very happy to be rid of my extra roommate and always felt better
in my house from</b>
<br><b>then on. Well I hope you liked my story.</b>

<p><b>"Building 4"!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I'm sending you this message to inform you more about Building
4. My name</b>
<br><b>is Johnnie D. Short. I'm an Airman in stationed at Holloman AFB
New Mexico.</b>
<br><b>Six months ago I visited my brother after graduation. My brother
was a First</b>
<br><b>Luetenant at Fort Bliss. He was a cop. His Capt. said I could ride
along</b>
<br><b>with him on one of his patrols. That night we passed building 4
on our way</b>
<br><b>to Burger King. My brother stopped becouse I said that it looked
as if it</b>
<br><b>was haunted. My brother called the desk to ask if the building was
secure</b>
<br><b>and if they used it. They laughed at my brother and told him to
go secure</b>
<br><b>it. About five minutes later six other cops showed up telling us
about the</b>
<br><b>building. A few days later my brother came home and asked me if
I wanted to</b>
<br><b>go in the building with him. Of course I said yes. We went to the
house at</b>
<br><b>about 11:30 P.M. with our wives. They stayed in the car. As we started
to go</b>
<br><b>in we both got tears in our eyes as if we got our hearts broken
by a girl.</b>
<br><b>We went in and walked the bottom floor. It's like an abandoned house.</b>
<br><b>There's many rooms with glass swinging doors in the middle of the
hallways.</b>
<br><b>As we left the building I took pictures of the stairs where the
woman in the</b>
<br><b>blue dress was suppose to be standing at times. The filmed developed
strings</b>
<br><b>like those ones on your site. It also showed a face in the third
floor</b>
<br><b>window of a an older man with a mustach looking out towards the
car our</b>
<br><b>wives where in. Before we left we met a woman standing on the other
end</b>
<br><b>looking at the building. She was the one who took the picture with
what</b>
<br><b>appeared to look like a phantom. I think you once had this picture
but I'm</b>
<br><b>not sure. It was looking out the bottom floor window. One month
later she</b>
<br><b>got ahold of my brother and asked him if he would like to go to
the house to</b>
<br><b>ghost hunt. So they went. They had a camera set up on the third
floor of</b>
<br><b>this building and saw numerous orbs moving in front of the camera
shooting</b>
<br><b>in and out of the rooms. Then the orbs lined up and moved towards
them</b>
<br><b>slowly. They then went over and around the camera out of view around
them.</b>
<br><b>They got pretty scared. After that the three women went down stairs
with</b>
<br><b>some sort of magnetic sensor. My brother told them that the orbs
followed</b>
<br><b>them down. His Friend who is a NCO on base spotted only a few of
them</b>
<br><b>upstairs. When they where about to leave they heard numerous things.
They're</b>
<br><b>are no more blinds in the building but they heard someone running
thier</b>
<br><b>fingers along them. Building 4 is the only building that is not
used by the</b>
<br><b>Army due to these hauntings. When I get back home I'm going to go</b>
<br><b>investigate them some more. I'm in Kuwait but I'll be leaving in
two weeks.</b>
<br><b>I only live an hour from Fort Bliss. Well good luck on the rest
of your</b>
<br><b>hunts.</b>
<br><b>P.S. Something also kept shutting the camera off when they would
leave it</b>
<br><b>alone. And then the film made noise as if something was hitting
the</b>
<br><b>microphone as would a curious child.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Friends Haunted House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: letitride74@juno.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I haven't really seen any ghosts in My life, but I have talked to
friends</b>
<br><b>who had just seen something they could not explain. When I was younger</b>
<br><b>and in high school I had a fried named Chuck. His parents had bought
an</b>
<br><b>older house in the middle of town and were fixing it up. This house
was</b>
<br><b>three stories. One storie was under ground kind of like a basement.
In</b>
<br><b>this area of the country there are not many basements. Well, after
they</b>
<br><b>had fixed up the house and moved in that is when the sightings started.</b>
<br><b>Chuck had an older brother who was divorced and down on his luck
and his</b>
<br><b>child was living with his parents in the big old house. His name
was</b>
<br><b>Bryan. He was a good kid, normal kid, he liked to play hide and
seek and</b>
<br><b>things of that sort, and he would talk often about another boy he
played</b>
<br><b>with named George. Nobody really thought much about this coming
from such</b>
<br><b>a young child. He would talk about playing with George and the things</b>
<br><b>they would do together. One day his grandmother asked him if she
was ever</b>
<br><b>going to meet George and Bryan stated to her that she could not
see him</b>
<br><b>because he was dead. She inquired more about this and discovered
that</b>
<br><b>George was a boy who had lived several decades ago and was ran over
by a</b>
<br><b>wagon of some sort. I really don't remember the fine points because
it</b>
<br><b>was a while ago when this was going on. One day when I was over
at</b>
<br><b>Chuck's house I was talking to Bryan and I asked him what George
looked</b>
<br><b>like. He told Me that George was all gray and wore old clothes.
I asked</b>
<br><b>him if George every said anything about why he was here and he told
Me</b>
<br><b>that George wanted to live longer and he felt that he had not gotten
the</b>
<br><b>best out of his life yet.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Several times later when I would be staying at Chuck's I heard
sounds</b>
<br><b>and knocks that were loud enough to wake Me up from sleep. Several
others</b>
<br><b>claimed that had seen strange and unusual things in the house. I
never</b>
<br><b>really did, but I always try to keep an open mind about things.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Terror</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lengler@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I just wanted to relate an experience that I had about 15 years
ago.&nbsp; I've</b>
<br><b>never been the type to "dwell" on the paranormal, it was just a
part of</b>
<br><b>life as a child of a large irish family.&nbsp; I was raised by a
grandmother and</b>
<br><b>parents who believe that ghosts and spirits exsisited, but were
not</b>
<br><b>something to worry about or change your life over.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I was 24 and living on my own in Long Beach California. The
apartment I</b>
<br><b>lived in was actually part of an old turn of the century craftsman
house</b>
<br><b>that had been made into a duplex.&nbsp; It was a small, one bedroom.&nbsp;
On this</b>
<br><b>particular night, my boyfriend of the time was over and getting
ready to</b>
<br><b>leave.&nbsp; After he left, I got ready fro bed and looked at the
clock, set it</b>
<br><b>for 8:00 am and turned off the light.&nbsp; The next thing I knew,
I heard a</b>
<br><b>noise that sounded like the refridgerator opening.&nbsp; I looked
to the right</b>
<br><b>of my bedroom toward the kitchen and saw a light on, but not the
kitchen</b>
<br><b>light, a much lower watt light such as the light from inside a fridge.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>stared at the entrance to the kitchen, a small, dark figure suffled
into</b>
<br><b>the room.&nbsp; The best description I can give you is that it was
short, maybe</b>
<br><b>5 foot, and looked like it was hunched over.&nbsp; It was all black,
with the</b>
<br><b>exception of two eyes.&nbsp; It shuffled, like an old person across
the room,</b>
<br><b>going by the bottom of my bed.&nbsp; When it reached about the midway
point, it</b>
<br><b>stopped and looked at me.&nbsp; It then continued on through my
room to the</b>
<br><b>living room.&nbsp; During the time I had seen the light, I had tried
turning on</b>
<br><b>my bedside table light, and even the light in the room with the
switch on</b>
<br><b>the wall.&nbsp; Neither of these lights worked until this figure
left the</b>
<br><b>bedroom, then all the lights went on at once.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;One might think I was dreaming(it was my first thought) but
my boyfriend</b>
<br><b>had left my apartment at 12:55 am and it was only 1:16 when the
lights went</b>
<br><b>on.&nbsp; I had a terrible feeling about all of this and couldn't
stay in the</b>
<br><b>apartment for weeks by myself.&nbsp; I don't know if I'm predisposed
to these</b>
<br><b>things, I had often as a child,&nbsp; felt things sitting on my
bed in the</b>
<br><b>night, felt what seemed like children's hands on me at night.&nbsp;
I just past</b>
<br><b>them off as what my grandma used to term, souls looking for comfort.&nbsp;
They</b>
<br><b>never bother me...this incident frightened me.&nbsp; To this day,
I remeber the</b>
<br><b>terror I felt.&nbsp; What do you think?</b>

<p><b>Existence of Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: frog@slac.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I don't suppose I'm a true believer in ghosts... I don't really</b>
<br><b>disbelieve, either.&nbsp; There's an awful lot of evidence to support
the</b>
<br><b>existence of ghosts, I've just never seen any.&nbsp; I never really
thought</b>
<br><b>about it at all until last year, at Halloween.&nbsp; My husband
and I were</b>
<br><b>visiting my parents when the subject came up (I think there was
some</b>
<br><b>special on TV, because of the season).&nbsp; In the past, my father
has told</b>
<br><b>me several ghost stories, things he had seen.&nbsp; Of course, they
were all</b>
<br><b>things that happened long before I was born, and far away, so I
never</b>
<br><b>really thought of them as anything but entertainment.&nbsp; I also
don't read</b>
<br><b>books or watch movies about ghosts or the supernatural, because
I'm</b>
<br><b>easily scared.&nbsp; This particular night, however, my father informed
me</b>
<br><b>that there were several unexplained things going on in and around
our</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; I've taken all of this with a grain of salt, since
my father is</b>
<br><b>such a wonderful storyteller, I'm sure he sometimes bends facts
in order</b>
<br><b>to make a story more interesting, but other people have corroborated</b>
<br><b>some of these stories.</b>
<br><b>Now, I lived in the house in question for nearly 15 years, and never
saw</b>
<br><b>or heard things I couldn't explain.&nbsp; My mother insists that
it's because</b>
<br><b>we're basically the equivalent of psychically "colorblind."&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>believes wholeheartedly, despite having never seen anything.&nbsp;
I think</b>
<br><b>I'd have to see something digitally remastered in technicolor before
I'd</b>
<br><b>be willing to accept it so completely.&nbsp; Anyway, my father admitted
that</b>
<br><b>he'd been seeing things for years, but didn't mention it because
he knew</b>
<br><b>how skittish I was.</b>
<br><b>When we moved into the house my father converted one of the storage</b>
<br><b>sheds in the backyard to a workshop.&nbsp; He claims one night while
walking</b>
<br><b>back to the house from the workshop, he was looking at the sky,
and when</b>
<br><b>he looked back to see where he was going, he was less than an arm's</b>
<br><b>length from an older man, sitting in an old lawn chair, smoking
a pipe.</b>
<br><b>He could see the smoke rising, but couldn't smell it.&nbsp; The
man</b>
<br><b>disappeared in front of his eyes.&nbsp; One of my younger brother's
friends</b>
<br><b>saw the same thing, in almost the exact same way.&nbsp; He was walking</b>
<br><b>through the yard, not paying attention to where he was going, and
when</b>
<br><b>he looked, the man was just inches away from him, again, smoking
a</b>
<br><b>pipe.&nbsp; The man then took the pipe out of his mouth, and smiled
before</b>
<br><b>disappearing.&nbsp; Both my father and brother's friend said they
were</b>
<br><b>startled, but not really frightened.&nbsp; My father has seen it
several</b>
<br><b>times, and says that the apparition is wearing a long grey greatcoat,</b>
<br><b>like a Confederate officer.&nbsp; This fits with the history of
the area; our</b>
<br><b>house, in fact the whole development, was built on the land surrounding</b>
<br><b>a plantation house which was used as a hospital during both the</b>
<br><b>Revolutionary and Civil wars.</b>
<br><b>There is another apparition which the same friend of my brother's
has</b>
<br><b>seen, although my father has not.&nbsp; One night, several of us
were there,</b>
<br><b>when this guy got up to leave.&nbsp; I don't know how late it was,
but it was</b>
<br><b>quite dark out.&nbsp; A few moments later he came tearing back into
the</b>
<br><b>house, burst through the door and slammed it behind him, out of
breath.</b>
<br><b>Now, I should mention that while this guy (a U.S. Marine) isn't
above</b>
<br><b>playing a trick to frighten us, I seriously doubt he could act this</b>
<br><b>well, or that he'd be willing to let us see him even pretend to
be that</b>
<br><b>frightened if he could help it.</b>
<br><b>After he caught his breath, he told us he'd gone to his car (parked</b>
<br><b>across the street, as there were several people visiting at the
time)</b>
<br><b>and when he'd gone to open the door, he'd felt something behind
him.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>turned and saw a shadowy figure in the yard across the street.&nbsp;
Unlike</b>
<br><b>the other thing he'd seen, this one frightened him immensely.&nbsp;
He ran</b>
<br><b>back into the house.&nbsp; About 7 of us followed him back out there,
and</b>
<br><b>there was nothing, but he had left his car door wide open, with
the keys</b>
<br><b>hanging in the door to get away quickly.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Driving in the Night</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: XLauraMonDuneX@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi,&nbsp; my experience with the spitual world sin't like most that
you have read,</b>
<br><b>but still, It was eerie.</b>
<br><b>I was sitting home one night watching 'Gone With The Wind' with
my cat</b>
<br><b>sitting on my lap and suddenly he jumped up and hissed at the window.
So I</b>
<br><b>figured that the neighbors cat was outside and just ignored it.&nbsp;
about 5</b>
<br><b>minutes past and the dogs started barking the way they do when someone
is</b>
<br><b>coming down the road.&nbsp; I looked out the window and my dog were
looking</b>
<br><b>directly at the house and at the same time goose bumps popped up
all over my</b>
<br><b>body. I shut the blinds and sat back down onto the couch and turned
off the</b>
<br><b>TV in Case somebody was here. (I was home alone at the time) I listened</b>
<br><b>carefully as the dogs continued to bark and I heard the soft shouting
of men</b>
<br><b>and what seemed to be 1-2 horses walking by my window pulling wagon
with a</b>
<br><b>loud harness.&nbsp; Baffled, I looked out the window once more to
see my dogs'</b>
<br><b>heads move slowly from the house to the swamp that's about 50 feet
away from</b>
<br><b>the front porch as if they were watching something move by.&nbsp;
And it all faded</b>
<br><b>away with the sound of something large moving through the thick
cattails.</b>
<br><b>Shocked as I was, within the next week, I did a little research
about our</b>
<br><b>property and it turns out that the surrounding 1000 acres used to
be an old</b>
<br><b>ranch and about 2-3 miles away from where my house is now was a
grave yard.</b>
<br><b>Needless to say, it was both an odd yet intriguing experience.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Dancing in the Dark</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: PaleShadesOfGrey@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I really enjoy reading the stories of others who have had ghostly
encounters</b>
<br><b>and thought I would share one of my first, memorable encounters
with a spirit</b>
<br><b>- outside my family (we've had plenty of family members paying us
ghostly</b>
<br><b>visits, including pets).&nbsp; This encountered happened when I
was about 12-13</b>
<br><b>years old.&nbsp; My mother, my brothers and sister, my friend Bridget
and I had</b>
<br><b>gone to visit my cousin and his family in a small rural town in
Connecticut.</b>
<br><b>Their home was slightly back from the road in a well wooded area.&nbsp;
It was a</b>
<br><b>new house, no prior owners.&nbsp; Their neighbors were a fair distance
off on</b>
<br><b>either side with lots of trees separating them (zoning is 3 acres
in this</b>
<br><b>area).&nbsp; Later that evening when we were getting ready to head
back home my</b>
<br><b>friend Bridget and I 'called' the front seat for the ride - back
in the 70's</b>
<br><b>kids could actually ride in the front seat of the car untethered...!&nbsp;&nbsp;
To</b>
<br><b>ensure we got the front seat before anyone else laid claim to it,
Bridget and</b>
<br><b>I went outside and were leaning against the car, talking.&nbsp;
It was around 9pm,</b>
<br><b>dark, the only light coming from the porch light and the windows
of the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; Out there sharing the dark with the crickets and the
bullfrogs, a</b>
<br><b>sudden movement in my peripheral vision caused me to turn to the
right where</b>
<br><b>I saw something totally unbelievable.&nbsp; It was a puff of mist,
probably the</b>
<br><b>size of a cocker spaniel.&nbsp; It's not unusal to see little pockets
of mist</b>
<br><b>lingering in spots in the woods at night I'm sure, but THIS little
puff of</b>
<br><b>mist was moving through the trees at a fair pace.&nbsp; Well, moving
doesn't</b>
<br><b>exactly explain it. It was weaving in and out and around the tree
trunks,</b>
<br><b>swooshing up and around and down again, almost as if it were playing.
It was</b>
<br><b>definitely a happy, playful movement. There was no wind that night
- and even</b>
<br><b>if there were it would dissipate the mist, not cause it to move
like that</b>
<br><b>while the less talented mist lay still at the base of the trees.
Wide-eyed I</b>
<br><b>turned toward an equally wide-eyed Bridget, who was looking at me.
I said "Do</b>
<br><b>you see that?!" and she said "Yes. You see it, too?!"&nbsp; With
that we both went</b>
<br><b>running up the steps back in to the house.&nbsp; By the time we
managed to</b>
<br><b>convince the others to come outside for a look, the dancing mist
was gone -</b>
<br><b>all that remained were its less animate friends lying low to the
ground.</b>
<br><b>Needless to say, no one believed us at the time and we were teased
about it</b>
<br><b>for quite a while.&nbsp; All I can say is thank God Bridget was
with me to witness</b>
<br><b>the performance or I might have been inclined to agree with the
skeptics that</b>
<br><b>I had imagined it.&nbsp; That was one of my first encounters that
I vividly</b>
<br><b>recall. There have been many since that time - some definitely not
so funny.</b>
<br><b>I believe there are some people who, for whatever reason, are more
sensitive</b>
<br><b>to these experiences, and that spirits can feel this and lean toward
contact</b>
<br><b>with them for that reason.&nbsp; It can run in families, too.&nbsp;
My brothers, my</b>
<br><b>sister, my father and I were all sensitive this way. My mother and
older</b>
<br><b>brother were not.&nbsp; One strange experience:&nbsp; Growing up
I had many encounters</b>
<br><b>with 'ghosts'.&nbsp; Being ridiculed by my mother whenever I brought
them up made</b>
<br><b>me keep the smaller ones to myself (I only yelled about the ones
that really</b>
<br><b>scared me!).&nbsp; One incident in particular was the man in the
bedroom.&nbsp; There</b>
<br><b>is one bedroom in our home that for a time I used as my own.&nbsp;
Some nights I'd</b>
<br><b>be trying to fall asleep - or even be asleep and be awakened by
the sensation</b>
<br><b>that there was someone standing very close to the bed staring at
me.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>didn't have this feeling in any other bedroom in the house. I never
mentioned</b>
<br><b>it to anyone.&nbsp; One night I even heard a voice say "Good night."
to me. My dog</b>
<br><b>growled and my mother called out from her bedroom asking me what
I had said!</b>
<br><b>Eventually I married and moved away.&nbsp; My sister and her husband
bought a new</b>
<br><b>house and while waiting for everything to clear came to stay with
my mother</b>
<br><b>for a short period of time.&nbsp; They stayed in that room.&nbsp;
One day my sister</b>
<br><b>phoned me to tell me something strange.&nbsp; She said she was uncomfortable</b>
<br><b>sleeping in that room - that she swears she feels someone is in
the room with</b>
<br><b>them at night, standing by the bed in the dark staring at them.&nbsp;
She said she</b>
<br><b>didn't mention it to her husband, afraid he would ridicule the whole
thing.</b>
<br><b>Then one morning her husband told her "You know, I'm embarrassed
to say this,</b>
<br><b>but that bedroom gives me the creeps. I swear at night I wake up
sometimes</b>
<br><b>feeling someone is standing right next to the bed staring down at
me." To her</b>
<br><b>surprise I told her I never mentioned it before but I got the same
feeling in</b>
<br><b>there when I lived in that room. Three people, all getting the same
feeling</b>
<br><b>in the room, afraid to say anything to anyone for fear of being
laughed at!</b>
<br><b>I'm back with my mother now after separating from my husband.&nbsp;
I sleep in</b>
<br><b>that same room, but every night before I turn off the lights I think
"I don't</b>
<br><b>want to see you, I don't want to feel you, I don't want to hear
you, or even</b>
<br><b>THINK you. In the name of God go away and leave me alone."&nbsp;
It seems to work</b>
<br><b>- I haven't had any strange experiences in there since I started
that nightly</b>
<br><b>mantra.</b>

<br><b>Crazy Little Leprechaun and Other Wierd Stuff....</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: coreist@techie.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was probably 12-ish, I was sleeping in my bed, I share the room
with my</b>
<br><b>brother(or used to). I woke up for no reason other than I knew I
should(?).</b>
<br><b>I looked around, and sitting on my bookcase was a little guy, about
1 foot</b>
<br><b>tall, with this wierd little grin on his face. I just sat there
and watched</b>
<br><b>him, his was swinging his legs, like he hadn't a care about me watching
him.</b>
<br><b>Then he turned to me and said "I know you're scared". Then he hopped
off and</b>
<br><b>walked towards my bed, I yelled and looked away. When I looked back
he was</b>
<br><b>gone. I have never seen him again, but that was probably one of
the scariest</b>
<br><b>things I've ever encountered.</b>
<br><b>OK, my two other experiences are together. I was in bed trying to
go to</b>
<br><b>sleep, the rest of my family were still upstairs for some reason.
Anyway, I</b>
<br><b>was sitting there when the tap in my bathroom turned on full blast(I
can see</b>
<br><b>it from my bed). I was pretty freaked, but I didn't move. Then I
heard the</b>
<br><b>clinking sound. I turned around, and in the drink of water I had
brought</b>
<br><b>down, the ice was spinning around really fast in the glass.</b>
<br><b>I jumped up and ran upstairs.</b>
<br><b>No-one really believes me, but it's there loss, right?</b>
