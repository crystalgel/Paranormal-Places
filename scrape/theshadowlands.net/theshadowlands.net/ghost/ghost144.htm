<b>My Mom's Jealous Suitor</b><b></b>
<p><b>BY: apriljo1@prodigy.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>My mom lives in a two-story duplex that was built in either the teens
or twenties.&nbsp; She has air conditioning and my apartment doesn't so
I would often camp out at her house on the weekends during the summer;
I could visit my cat, watch cable tv, and take advantage of the laundry
facilities.&nbsp; Mom would more often than not stay with her fiance during
the weekends, and my brother would be at his girlfriend's house; it was
just me and the cats.</b>
<br><b>One weekend I was just starting to fall asleep, and my left arm
was dangling over the edge of the bed.&nbsp; I felt something soft brush
my arm, and I thought it was my mom's cat, because it did feel like a cat's
tail brushing against my hand.&nbsp; Smiling, I reached out to pet her
and I felt nothing.&nbsp; I opened my eyes.&nbsp; My cat Spunky was still
curled up at the end of the bed, and there was a bright moon that night.&nbsp;
I could see rather well in the bedroom but there was no Bunjee (Mom's cat).&nbsp;
Suddenly the room went pitch black and I knew at once there was a ghost.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; It pressed down on my arms that night until I threw a fit
and told it to leave me alone.&nbsp; Sulking, it paced all night long,
which is what it seemed to do best.</b>
<br><b>For a while, I was the only one who was experiencing any phenomenon.&nbsp;
The ghost liked to flicker lights from time to time, and every so often
I would hear a hushed male voice, but mostly it would walk upstairs and
pace in the hallway.&nbsp; The only thing I'd ever seen was the black shadow
that first night, but the pacing really began to unnerve me.&nbsp; Mom
told me just to pray and it would go away.&nbsp; But it never did.</b>
<br><b>Then, one Sunday evening, my mom got up to go to the bathroom, and
while she was in there, she heard the front door open, and someone walk
upstairs.&nbsp; Thinking it was me, she called out, "April?"&nbsp; No answer.&nbsp;
Then she called for Jay and Tammy, but they were fast asleep in Jay'sroom.&nbsp;
The footsteps had now begun to pace the upstairs hallway.&nbsp; She grabbed
the toilet plunger, now convinced someone was in her house.&nbsp; (She
didn't even think about the ghost at the time)&nbsp; But upon seeing no
one in the hallway, she remembered my stories.&nbsp; She muttered, "Oh,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;B.S.&nbsp; I'm just listening to April too much."&nbsp; She
went back to bed.The next morning when her alarm went off, she lay in bed,
thinking how much she really didn't want to get up.&nbsp; Suddenly, she
felt a force, like someone slamming their hand down on her bed!&nbsp; And
she saw a distinct handprint on her sheet!&nbsp; She sat straight up and
cried, "I'm up!</b>
<br><b>I'm up!"&nbsp; And she prayed all the time she was getting ready
for work.&nbsp; The ghost had stolen my keys around this time and I kept
demanding that it return them--we finally found my original keys about
four weeks later, in my mom's jacket pocket that she wore everyday and
reached into for her own belongings!&nbsp; They just appeared out of nowhere!My
brother Jay experienced a night of uneasiness when the ghost kept opening
and closing his dresser drawers and turning on and off his television!&nbsp;
Needless to say, he didn't get much sleep that night!&nbsp; By that time,
everyone whocame to the house would hear the stomping upstairs.&nbsp; We
noticed that the ghost would seem most active whenever Mom would mention
her fiance, so we figured that he was enamoured of Mom and was</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;a jealous suitor!&nbsp; Even though Mom and her fiance are
no longer together, the ghost acts up whenever she mentions dating someone!</b>

<p><b>I Feel Them</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:dreddish@charter.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Each year my mother and I would go on a trip.</b>
<br><b>the first year that we went some where was up to Gettysburg. We
went all over the place. and we went to the museum. And my aunt and grandmother
was with us. As my mother and aunt and i was looking around the part that
had all of the guns and things. something happened to me. i started to
cry and go around in cicrles and telling my mother to get me out of here.
they wont leave me alone. i felt like there was hands reaching out and
trying to grab me. well my mother got me out of that room. and my aunt's
face done turned white and my mother told</b>
<br><b>her that i was her spirt child.&nbsp; that was about five years
ago. now last year she and i was comeing home from my uncle's house in
virgina and we stopped at the natural brige. and we was walking around
and we came up to the salt peter mine.you had to walk across a small brigeto
get to it. so we did and i told my mother that i cann't go there. the air
was so cold that it went down to my bones. and we was therein june and
in the afternoon. and it was hot that day. we walked up to it and i was
holding my mothers hand and i pulled away and started to tell her that
i cann't go there. there was to much pain and i could feel it and i walked
away back to the brige and started to cry. and</b>
<br><b>we went on to end of the trail. and on the way back i looked at
the mine and to this day i still believe that i saw someone standing at
the opening. i have one more to tell. we was comeing home from idaho just
the other week. and we stopped at mount rushmore. and we did the sit&nbsp;
seeing thing. well we was getting ready to go and but first we had to go
to the restroom. when i went in there was NO ONE in there but me.</b>
<br><b>the toilets started to flush one by one and that was time for me
to leave. then my mother went in and something happened to her. the latch
on the door slid and the door opened for her and then the same thing happened
to her. the towlets started to flush on her. and she said that she was
the only person in there. now i know that you may not think that happened
to us. but i know what happened and believe it did.</b>

<p><b>The Haunted Wedding Ring</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Andrews767@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I don't believe that objects like rings can be haunted, but the emotions
that</b>
<br><b>they represent or the memories and emotions they cause in others
can create</b>
<br><b>an energy that attracts ghosts or entities attached to the ghosts.</b><b></b>
<p><b>When my father died in 1989, I got his wedding ring.&nbsp; It was
the ring he wore</b>
<br><b>for 21 years while married to my mother.&nbsp; In those 21 years,
he cheated on my</b>
<br><b>mom, beat the hell out of me, and eventually became a "Happy drunk".&nbsp;
(We</b>
<br><b>were happy when he was drunk because it was the only time he was
mellow!)</b><b></b>
<p><b>I had lived in my apartment with my 5 year old daughter for 1 year
prior to</b>
<br><b>getting the ring and we had our cat, Pyewacket, for almost as long.&nbsp;
I had</b>
<br><b>the ring sized down to fit my right hand (my mother was buried with
hers or</b>
<br><b>I'd have had hers), but I didn't wear it a lot - I said it didn't
look right</b>
<br><b>or something like that, and put it in my closet in my jewelry box.&nbsp;
Soon</b>
<br><b>after that, I started seeing "black clouds" in the corners of my
room, which</b>
<br><b>I could only see in peripheral vision, and vanished when I looked
right at</b>
<br><b>them.&nbsp; Things started to get moved - I "lost" a lot of stuff.&nbsp;
My cat</b>
<br><b>wouldn't go into my room on his own, and if I took him in there,
he'd run out</b>
<br><b>as soon as he could.&nbsp; The black clouds were getting bigger
and more frequent,</b>
<br><b>and I started seeing black figures the size of my cat running around.&nbsp;
My cat</b>
<br><b>was black, so I figured it was him until I saw him coming out of
another room</b>
<br><b>just after I saw the black figure running by.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Then one night, my cat looked up at the corner of my living room,
his back</b>
<br><b>went up, his hair fluffed and he started hissing and spitting and
backing</b>
<br><b>into the corner, all the while looking at the corner of the living
room.&nbsp;&nbsp; On</b>
<br><b>the other side of that wall was my bedroom closet -&nbsp; where
I had my father's</b>
<br><b>wedding ring!&nbsp; Up until then I thought it was all my imagination,
but since</b>
<br><b>animals don't usually hallucinate like that, I decided there was
more to it.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I wnt to my friend Ed who I was studying with in the paranormal,a
nd told him</b>
<br><b>what had been going on.&nbsp; After a tongue-lashing for not telling
him sooner,</b>
<br><b>he told me a few things to do.&nbsp; I did a clearing of the apartment.&nbsp;
That</b>
<br><b>escalated things to where they were getting scary - my daughter
was afraid</b>
<br><b>and my cat was going nuts in the house.&nbsp; Ed decided to help
me confront the</b>
<br><b>thing - he came over and we did an exorcism of sorts.&nbsp; He held
the ring and</b>
<br><b>his companion and I did the other stuff for the ritual.&nbsp; It
took several</b>
<br><b>hours, and when it was done, Ed's companion had a red mark on her
back like a</b>
<br><b>hand print, only no one had touched her, and it wasn't her own -
there's no</b>
<br><b>way her hand could have been twisted that direction.&nbsp; I think
she hadn't</b>
<br><b>protected herself enough, or fear took over in the middle of the
ritual and</b>
<br><b>she became vulnerable.&nbsp; The apartment seemed clear for a few
days, then it</b>
<br><b>all started up again.&nbsp; I did clearings and mini-exorcisms for
the next few</b>
<br><b>months, but stuff kept happening - smaller scale each time, though.&nbsp;
It only</b>
<br><b>quit when I sold the ring for god weight and had it melted down.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I don' think it was my father that was evil, I think his abusiveness
and</b>
<br><b>drinking opened him up to attract something evil, and when the emotions
that</b>
<br><b>connected the man with the entity&nbsp; were dredged up by my owning
the ring, the</b>
<br><b>entity saw an opportunity to create fear, which it lived on for
so long in my</b>
<br><b>house, fed by my father's frailties.&nbsp; When the focal point
was gone, so was</b>
<br><b>the entity.</b>

<br><b>Grandmothers Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: possegirlz@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;My grandmother lives in Cinnaminson, New Jersey.&nbsp; Her
bedroom is haunted.&nbsp; I don't want to give out her address because
she wouldn't like that.&nbsp; We believe that it is haunted by her father,
my great grandfather.&nbsp; At night my grandmother wakes up and sees flowers
growing on the wall.&nbsp; Sometimes she sees a dark figure next to her
bed, but when she reaches out, there's nothing there.&nbsp; I also have
a story of an incidentthat occured in that room.&nbsp; One weekend my grandparents
went to atlantic city.&nbsp; My aunt and cousin also live with my grandmom.&nbsp;
My uncle was</b>
<br><b>away, so just my aunt and cousin were left at home.&nbsp; My aunt
felt uneasy, so she called her mother in law to stay with her.&nbsp; My
aunt's mother in law slept in my grandmom's bed.&nbsp; Before she went
to sleep, she took off her favorite ring her mother had given her before
she died.She put the ring on the night table and went to sleep.&nbsp; That
night she had a dream of her mother calling to her.&nbsp; When she woke
up the next morning, her ring was in the exact same place on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the table, but it was completely twisted out of shape.&nbsp; This ring
was very strong and my aunt and her mother in law couldn't bend it back
into shape.&nbsp; She couldn't even fit the ring on her finger anymore.&nbsp;
At first she thought her mother did it because of her dream, but she knew
that her mother would never do that to her favorite ring.&nbsp; So, we
(my family) believes it is the ghost of my great grandfather, and he was
angry because a stranger was in his daughter's bed.&nbsp; My cousins, my
siblings, and I took pictures in the room and there are orbs of light in
the picture.</b>

<p><b>Haunted Maine woods</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Whoamommy@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>My mother and I vacation every year in Southern Maine.&nbsp; The
first year we did</b>
<br><b>so, we rented a little pre-fab cottage with two bedrooms in the
woods near</b>
<br><b>York.&nbsp; At the time I only had the one son and he was just shy
of two years</b>
<br><b>old.&nbsp; Although he was a terrible sleeper those early years,
what he went</b>
<br><b>through those two weeks I will never forget.</b><b></b>
<p><b>It first started out all right the first couple of nights; he was
restless</b>
<br><b>but I figured it was a new place and he was just uncomfortable in
unknown</b>
<br><b>surroundings.&nbsp; One night he was sleeping in my bed, and he
started having a</b>
<br><b>nightmare -- tossing and turning and talking.&nbsp; When he jolted
awake, he told</b>
<br><b>me about the native americans that were angry and he was very afraid.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>slept awful the whole time we were there, always mentioning the
angry</b>
<br><b>"Indians".</b><b></b>
<p><b>Whenever I am in a new place, I like to get a book on local ghost
stories.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>picked one up that covered that part of Maine and the part of Massachusetts</b>
<br><b>that is close by.&nbsp; There was a section on York, ME.&nbsp; Sure
enough, it detailed</b>
<br><b>a massacre that took place during its early settlement where only
one person</b>
<br><b>survived.&nbsp; I asked the owner and he reluctantly admitted the
massacres took</b>
<br><b>place "close by".</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well, although we still summer in southern Maine (in Ogunquit), we
never took</b>
<br><b>that cabin again!</b>

<p><b>Jacksons Grave</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: gilbert1@pc.edu</b><b></b>
<p><b>Lexington, VA - This is the reason that I found your site.&nbsp;
I have been searching the web to see if anyone else has ever reported this
but so far I can not seem to find it.&nbsp; About three weeks ago a friend
and I were in Lexington searching for civil war areas and we had found
a few and were searching for Stonewall Jackson's gravesite.&nbsp; It was
about 8:30pm and was raining hard and very dark.&nbsp; We entered the cemetary
were he is buried and began to look for his grave.&nbsp; On our second
pass my friend noticed a woman walking through the cemetary.&nbsp; I pulled
my</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;truck behind her and she continued to walk.&nbsp; I rolled
down my window and actually talked to her and she told me I should leave
the cemetary because it was dark and raining and that she just enjoyed
walking through the cemetary.&nbsp; I ask where Jackson's grave was and
she pointed and began walking again in front of my truck.&nbsp; I followed
her a little ways and she pointed again and we were right in front of Jackson's
monument.&nbsp; We looked up for about two seconds and my friend was startled.&nbsp;
He said "She's gone!"&nbsp; The lady disappeared.&nbsp; We drove the entire
cemetary and all the gates were locked except for the one we came in.&nbsp;
The girl was young and very attractive and soaking wet.&nbsp; That in itself
was pretty odd, but then she vanished.&nbsp; I know this is long but I
am trying to find out if this has ever been told before.&nbsp; If you have
ever heard of it please write back and let me know.</b>

<br><b>My Brother's House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jtgsjsg@email.msn.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was in a abusive relationship with a man and decided to move in
with my brother, his wife and their new baby instead of going back home
to my parents.&nbsp; My brother and his family were happy to have me and
wanted me to be in a safe place.&nbsp; They live in a Victorian home that
is over 100 years old.&nbsp; I was excited to live there, as I had the
whole third floor to myself.&nbsp; What I didn't realize was that the third
floor was where the servants quarters were. To get to my bedroom, you had
to pass my brother and his wife's room and go up a narrow flight of stairs.&nbsp;
The stairs were often drafty, but I thought nothing of it.&nbsp; For the
first several weeks, I didn't have any problems and soon became comfortable
in every day life.I started waking up at night freezing.&nbsp; My blankets
were always pulled off of me, like someone was pulling them off me.&nbsp;
The covers were alwas pulled in a neat fashion, almost as if I did it myself.&nbsp;
This would happen maybe two to three times a week.&nbsp; I then would start
waking</b>
<br><b>up in the middle of the night, while the covers were being pulled
off me, and I would see two to three dark figures standing over me-beside
the bed.&nbsp; I would start screaming and would catch myself.&nbsp; (I
didn't want my brother and his wife to be woke up by my childishness.)This
went on for several months and I finally apologized to my sister-in-law
for screaming the night before.&nbsp; My brother looked at me and asked
me why I was screaming.&nbsp; I told them that for about 2 months, I would
have my blankets pulled off of me while I was sleeping and there</b>
<br><b>would always be people standing over my bed.&nbsp; I told them that
I thought that I was dreaming, but it always seemed so real.&nbsp; I noticed
that my brother gave my sister-in-law a funny look.&nbsp; I apologized
for being silly and my brother told me that I wasn't.&nbsp; He noted that
ever since they moved in to their house, their kitchen cabinets would be
open when they knew that they shut them.&nbsp; He also noted that lights
would be turned on in the house-and both of them knew that it was not them
who did this.&nbsp; He also told me that both of them have seen "dark figures"
in their bedroom and he often had the covers pulled off of him when he
was sleeping.&nbsp; He noted that sometimes, he had someone pulling on
his toes, as if to wake him up.&nbsp; My sister-in-law told me that she
would wake up to have someone leaning over her while she was sleeping,
too.My brother then told me that he was down in their basement one day
doing laundry and he felt something cold and icy behind him.&nbsp; When
he turned around to see what was going on, a misty shape was right in front
of him and passed through his body.&nbsp; It took him hours to get over</b>
<br><b>the chill that was left in him.&nbsp; He noted that he often would
feel something in the basement, as if someone was in a corner watching
him.Needless to say, I then realized that what was happening to me in my
bedroom was not a dream.&nbsp; I started leaving the television on at night,
while I was sleeping as I was terrified.&nbsp; Things in my room would
often disappear and later return, but in a different spot.After several
more months of this craziness, I decided that I had to move back home with
my parents.&nbsp; I could take no more.&nbsp; Since this all happened,
I still have nightmares that someone is leaning over me in bed and the
only way I can fall asleep is to have the television on.</b>
<br><b>To this day, my brother and his wife experience strange occurances
in their home.&nbsp; Their first child (the one that was a baby when I
lived there) would often "talk" to something and would say that she had
a friend in the house.&nbsp; Now, the new baby has started doing the same
thing.</b>

<br><b>My Creepy Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Lucy</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have a strange story.&nbsp; I always grew up with strange things
happening in the homes I've lived in, however, the story I'm about to relay
is the most vivid.I had recently moved to a new city to be closer to my
dad.&nbsp; There was only one apartment available, at the time, in the
building he lived in;so I took it.&nbsp; The apartment was a small bachelor
suite with not much to it and no sunlight, which really bothered me.Now
I have always been a positive, generally up-beat person, however, after
moving into this place, I started on a downward spiral.&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>extremely depressed all the time, I didn't want to go out of the
apartment nor make any new friends.&nbsp; I even had thoughts of suicide.&nbsp;
I have never been like this before.There was always this writing that I
could faintly see, that was written on the wall above the window.&nbsp;
From what I could make out of it it said "Freedom is not to late".&nbsp;
I always wondered why this writting was there, but never really thought
much of it.&nbsp; It was only later on</b>
<br><b>that I really understood what it meant.I lived like in this misery
for about six months, before I couldn't handle it anymore.&nbsp; Luckily,
an apartment became available next door and it was big and bright.&nbsp;
I jumped at the chance to take it.&nbsp; I was to move into it the next
night.&nbsp; On the last night in the bachelor, I was sleeping soundly
when I just suddenly woke up.&nbsp; I looked towards the bathroom and this
thick black cloud was slowly creeping along the floor and wall; filling
the hallway and steadily coming towards me.&nbsp; The apartment that is
usually so</b>
<br><b>dark, became absolutely pitch black.&nbsp; The atmosphere was so
heavy I felt it hard to breath.&nbsp; I had an overwhelming feeling of
despair and hopelessness; I thought I would drown in the sadness.&nbsp;
I was terrified like I have never been before.&nbsp; I knew I had to stop
this or be consumed by whatever was oozing out of the bathroom.</b>
<br><b>I felt like I was in a daze, but I managed to pull myself out of
the fog and turned on the small lamp next to my bed.&nbsp; From that instant
theroom felt lighter.&nbsp; I lept from my bed and turned on all the lights
and the TV.&nbsp; Needless to say, I did not sleep that night.&nbsp; The
next day,as my dad and I were moving my things out of the apartment, the
manager came to see how we were doing.&nbsp; I relayed my story to him
and he didn't say much.</b>
<br><b>A few days later, he came to my door.&nbsp; I let him in and he
said he needed to explain something to me.&nbsp; So I waited for him to
continue.&nbsp; Apparently, there was a tenant who had committed suicide
in the bathroom.&nbsp; He had written the words on the wall (which they
have tried to cover over with paint and thick wallpaper to no avail) and
he had been on the verge of a breakdown in a fit of despair.&nbsp; He said
I was the longest tenant that had ever stayed there and he attributed that
to not informing me of the history of the apartment.&nbsp; He thought if
I knew then my imagination would create these stories, but because I told
him the same kind of story while ignorant of the facts, he was convinced</b>
<br><b>that the other stories from previous tenants had been true.&nbsp;
I am very happy now in the new apartment and I have lots of friends and
a great job.&nbsp; My whole life situation changed when I left that</b>
<br><b>opressive, negative place.</b>

<p><b>My Grandfather's Visit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Steppydawg@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I wrote you recently about some photos I have but this is different.My</b>
<br><b>Grandfather passed away on March 21, 1999. Shortly after his death
we</b>
<br><b>starting experiencing strange happenings. The television in our
spare bedroom</b>
<br><b>kept being turned on when I was here by myself. I turned it off
6 different</b>
<br><b>times one day. I could smell cigarette smoke when I was here alone
and no one</b>
<br><b>smokes in my house because my kids have asthma. Another incident
that</b>
<br><b>occurred my husband witnessed also we were downstairs just me and
him and we</b>
<br><b>heard a pager going off he is the only one that has a pager so I
asked him</b>
<br><b>who was paging him. He said that wasn't his that he had his and
then showed</b>
<br><b>it to me. I went upstairs and could not find anything and started
coming back</b>
<br><b>down when I heard it again. Still I could not find anything. Later
that night</b>
<br><b>I told my Mom about what happened and she informed me that my Paw
Paw had</b>
<br><b>gotten a beeper. The strangest thing that happened was my husband's
picture</b>
<br><b>went missing for a week we looked everywhere and could not find
it. As</b>
<br><b>mysteriously as it disappeared it returned back in the frame. My
husband</b>
<br><b>swears he did nothing with it and I know I didn't touch it. I have
visited</b>
<br><b>your site frequently but just have got the nerve to write my experience
I</b>
<br><b>thought people might think I was crazy. My friends that I told said
I had an</b>
<br><b>active imagination but it really happened. If you would like to
write me back</b>

<p><b>MY HAUNTED CHILDHOOD</b><b></b>
<p><b>by Kay Groark</b><b></b>
<p><b>My parents decided to move when I was about 14, our previous address
was</b>
<br><b>the only home I had known up to then.</b>
<br><b>The house we moved to was a normal 3 bed roomed detached house in
the</b>
<br><b>North East of England. The house was in need of some renovation,
so my</b>
<br><b>parents decided to start on it straight away. Thats when things
started</b>
<br><b>to happen. At first things would disappear ie. coffee mugs,toys,tools</b>
<br><b>etc. and then turn up in completely different places. This we just
put</b>
<br><b>down to fogetfulness. Then one day I had just come home from school,
I</b>
<br><b>walked in to the lounge, and as I always did looked on the window
sill</b>
<br><b>to see if I had any mail(from my penfriend). Out of the corner of
my eye</b>
<br><b>I saw an old man sat on the sofa, as I turned he slowly got up and</b>
<br><b>disappeared before my very eyes. I was slightly shocked as it was
only</b>
<br><b>4.00pm in the afternoon and brilliant sunshine outside. I decided
not to</b>
<br><b>say anything to my parents as they would say I was daydreaming.</b>
<br><b>The next time I actually heard something. I was taking my bath and
the</b>
<br><b>bathroom was filled with steam. I suddenly heard a very loud whistle
as</b>
<br><b>if they were bent low to my ear. It was an old song I had never
heard</b>
<br><b>of.(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I later found out it was "I`ll take you home
again Kathleen.")</b>
<br><b>I decided to tell my parents about the whistle and the old man I
had</b>
<br><b>seen. When I did my father looked very perturbed and I could tell
he had</b>
<br><b>noticed something to. Apparantly one morning, at about 5.00am, he
went</b>
<br><b>down stairs to get a drink of water, sat at the dining room table
was an</b>
<br><b>old man, who on looking up and seeing my father, disappeared. I
then</b>
<br><b>went on to describe the man I had seen, white hair stuck out at
the</b>
<br><b>sides, bald on top, white shirt with the old fashioned bands round
to</b>
<br><b>stop his cuffs getting in the way, dark trousers, slippers and small</b>
<br><b>wire rimmed spectacles. My father said this was the same man he
had</b>
<br><b>seen. A regular occurrence was, on going to bed I would hear footsteps</b>
<br><b>outside my bedroom door, as soon as I went to see who was there,</b>
<br><b>nothing. I almost felt like who ever he was, he was looking after
our</b>
<br><b>family. One night I was upset over something and I had gone to bed,
as I</b>
<br><b>was drifting off to sleep I felt something get hold of my hand,it
was</b>
<br><b>warm ,not cold as you might expect, then the feeling slowly went
away.</b>
<br><b>We decided to investigate who had lived in the house previously.
We</b>
<br><b>asked the previous owner to us and she said she had bought the house</b>
<br><b>from an old man who had to go into a care home. My mother had asked
for</b>
<br><b>a discription, and the way she described him fit our old man. He
was</b>
<br><b>called George. Thats all she could remember.</b>
<br><b>The whistling and other noises went on but we never saw him again.
I am</b>
<br><b>now 32 and married, but my parents still live in the house and things</b>
<br><b>still happen, only not as frequently.</b>

<p><b>My Haunted Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Tinkleweed2@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have luckily never had an unpleasant experience
with a spirit, though I</b>
<br><b>have met a few.&nbsp; Here's my story about my first one.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in '74 and '75, my parents owned a house
in Little Falls, NJ (I was</b>
<br><b>born in '73).&nbsp; It's a one-and-a-half story building, so the
upstairs was just</b>
<br><b>one big room; my playroom, to be exact.&nbsp; I don't remember this,
but there was</b>
<br><b>the ghost of a little blond boy, approximately 4 years old, that
lived there</b>
<br><b>with us.&nbsp; Mom would go upstairs to check on me, and would find
us playing</b>
<br><b>together time and time again.&nbsp; She said that Dad couldn't see
him (he would</b>
<br><b>also dissipate if Dad came into sight), but if she was quiet, he
would stay</b>
<br><b>and continue our game.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only memory involving him that I have
is one night just before my</b>
<br><b>sister was born in '76.&nbsp; I was in my "grown-up" bed, which
had a headboard</b>
<br><b>and a footboard.&nbsp; As I was dozing off, I looked up and saw
him standing at</b>
<br><b>the foot of my bed.&nbsp; I sat up, and it looked to me like he
ducked down to the</b>
<br><b>floor.&nbsp; I crawled to the end and looked over, but there was
nothing there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my sister was born, we moved into
a bigger house in a different</b>
<br><b>town.&nbsp; Mom said that she researched the house's history, but
it was</b>
<br><b>relatively new (we were the 2nd or 3rd owners), and before that
it was</b>
<br><b>farmland, so we never learned anything about him.&nbsp; I truly
hope that by now</b>
<br><b>he's found his way home.</b><b></b>
