Mom's First Hand Experience<br>
<br>
By: dracoslovebunny@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
This experience was told to me by my mother. If not for this, she tells
me, she would probably not believe in ghosts and the supernatural.
There's nothing like a firsthand experience to convince a nonbeliever.<br>
She was sleeping in her bedroom when she suddenly woke up for no reason
she could figure out. A glance to her window made her immediately look
back. There was a face there, loking in at her. Even in the
pitch-darkness that should have been in her room she could see it
clearly. Immediately she thought to herself, it ust be a peeping Tom.
Of course, my mother was a beatuful teenager so I'm sure she had plenty
of these. Then she realised she was on the second floor. Her next
thought was that it was a firefighter and the house was on fire. Then,
of course, she realised the blinds to her window were closed. She was
seeing this face, and it was only a face and nothing else, no body, in
front of her blinds, inside her bedroom.<br>

The Dark Lane Story<br>
<br>
By: Aaronmmiles@aol.com<br>
<br>
well it was a couple of years back must of been 1998 talking about it
makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up i was in the car with
my brother at that time and we were driving along a really dark foresty
road near hungerford in the uk apparently its where they used to hang
people or something anyway the car stopped suddenly i couldnt get it to
come back on my brother was in the back and he looked out onto the hill
and he saw an outline someone and then a flash then it dissapeared we
got the car back up again and we carried on down the road and then it
stopped again and a i turned the headlights on and there was a man
standing there he ran to the front of car started banging on it really
loudly and started shouting at us telling us to turned round then there
was a flash and he was gone to scared to carry on down that road we
turned back and chose another route.<br>
then in 1999 by uncle went on the same route and did a vigil there and
he came back with scratches all up his arm and he didnt have them
before he visited there. so that place must have some dark history to
it.<br>

The Grave by the Raod<br>
<br>
By: friendshiplis@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
This is a true ghost encountered that my dad had back<br>
in our country.&nbsp; Back in those days, seeing a girl is<br>
lot different than these days.&nbsp; You would have to<br>
travel by foot in the middle of the night for at least<br>
half an hour through the woodlands in the mountain<br>
&nbsp;cause the villages where people lives are quiet a<br>
distance apart.&nbsp; Also, there wasn t restriction on<br>
where people can and can t be buried.&nbsp; My dad knew<br>
about it that few days earlier, they buried this one<br>
guy next to the small dirt road that my dad took, but<br>
that was the only road leads to the village where my<br>
dad s girl friend lived.&nbsp; That night the moon was<br>
closed to being full.&nbsp; As dad was getting closer to<br>
the grave, he smelled this bad odor, a chill ran<br>
through his spine, his hair and goose bumps started to<br>
raised and all of sudden, this feeling that there was<br>
something there at the grave pop in his head so<br>
strongly.&nbsp; He turned his little flash light off and<br>
the only light now is the moonlight. Just as he was<br>
about 15 or so yard from the grave, there was this man<br>
in ragging clothes but for sure it can t be a human<br>
because this person is bigger than your usual human. <br>
The thing cut in front of my dad and started walking<br>
slowly the same way that my dad was going.&nbsp; My dad<br>
knew what is was, should he stop or should he turn and<br>
run back home but home is quiet a distance back too. <br>
&gt;From hearing what people said, he can t turn because<br>
if he turns back, it will chase him.&nbsp; So without<br>
saying anything or making any noise he took out his<br>
two pistols and his fingers clinging on the trigger<br>
pointed directly at the back of the object just in<br>
case the object turns around and goes after my dad. <br>
Nowadays, he s still not sure how long they walk that<br>
pace together but my dad sure kept his distance<br>
between them.&nbsp; During that forever time, my dad told <br>
himself that he s going to shoot the object if the<br>
object turns and come after my dad but what if his<br>
guns doesn t go off&nbsp; cause that s what normally happen<br>
when you shoot a ghost.&nbsp; Or what if it did go off but<br>
the bullet just pierce through the object and nothing<br>
happen.&nbsp; As they got closer to the village, the road<br>
split into two roads, one leading to the village, the<br>
other leads to somewhere else.&nbsp; The object chose the<br>
road leading away from the village and so that night<br>
dad wasn t going to come home by himself so he spent<br>
the night there in the village.&nbsp; I talked to a lot of<br>
the older people that lived the life that my dad lived<br>
and they all experienced or heard of situation like<br>
this and this is true.&nbsp; Give me your thoughts on this<br>

The Ghost in the Dept. Store Basement<br>
<br>
By: shawne@pmfinet.com<br>
<br>
I recently started a new job in a large local department store. This
store has a huge basement where empty shelves are stored and overstock
items&#8212;such as large ficus trees and so on.&nbsp; Many employees refuse
to go down there alone at night.&nbsp; I have found out why. One
evening, I went down to the basement to drop something off. There is a
very long hallway between two huge rooms down there. I walked to the
far room (going through the hallway). As I neared the end of the hall,
I thought I heard the &#8220;click click&#8221; of high heels. I turned, saw
nothing and walked on. I was standing at a counter down there doing
some work and heard the sound again&#8212;I looked and I swear I saw what
looked to be a woman literally walking into the ficus trees and
disappearing (yes I saw high heels) Well, I went upstairs rather
quickly. After talking with many co-workers, I discovered they ALL had
the same experience! Come to find out, the woman who used to handle the
incoming trucks died suddenly about 2 years ago. And yes, she always
wore high heels to work! The woman who replaced her made management
move the warehouse desk upstairs as she always felt so &#8220;creepy&#8221; sitting
downstairs.&nbsp; Did the former freight manager love her job so much
she hates to leave? Who knows&#8212;I just know I&#8217;ve joined the ranks of &#8220;I&#8217;m
not going down there by myself&#8221;<br>

Don't Mind Sharing a Home<br>
<br>
By: mrspizmit@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
In 3 months my husband and I will have been married a year.&nbsp; A few
months after we were married we moved to this house here in Minneapolis
and since we have gotten here I have never felt comfortable.&nbsp; My
husband's best friend was kind enough to let us share this HUGE house
with him after some of my new in laws sold a house out from under us
and kind of left us standing...ANYWAY.&nbsp; I have an extreme fear of
basements and when I say extreme I mean EXTREME .....our washer and
dryer are in the basement so come time to do laundry it took me weeks
to build up the courage telling myself you are 30 years old GROW UP...
so my first venture to this basement i swallow the lump in my throat
and continue with my mission.&nbsp; Under out stairs there is like a
triangle place that most people leave open to store things only on
these stairs the entire area is blocked in like boarded up so I tried
not to notice but my fear had me on my toes....I was alone except for
our 2 pitbulls who are larger than average so you would think I would
have NO FEAR.&nbsp; As I was putting the clothes in the washer our male
pit came downstairs and was laying on the floor beside me while I
loaded the washer as fast as I could he suddenly gets up and goes into
the spare room in the basement and starts this deep growling he only
uses when he is protecting....just like kids you get to know their
different sounds.....anyway I looked up from what i was doing and saw
something out of the corner of my eye that looked like another dog's
hind quarters in the doorway to the room.&nbsp; In this area we have
alot of idiots who think it is cool to fight their pits and we have
ours for family dogs only the are loved and protected just like
children but they a o know it is their job to protect us several people
have approached us wanting to fight our dogs and we always turn them
away so they get angry so the first thing that comes in to my mind was
someone found a way to get one of these fighting pits into my house sp
I panicked and grabbed this pipe beside the washer as I went to
approach the other dog my male came bolting out of the room and
straight up the stairs I got this feeling someone was behind me so I
ran after him.&nbsp; When my husband got home I told him what happened
and he finally broke down and told me there are some stories to this
house and one is for sure that right before his best friend moved in
here some idiots kept a dog on a 12 inch chain attached to the wall
downsatirs in the spare room and sometimes our dogs seem to see him.
Then he says he might as well tell me the rest that goes with this
house.&nbsp; Seems back in like WWII an older lady had lived here and
had fallen madly in love with this house her husband had been killed at
war and she was just living alone and she had made the request to be
buried with this house.&nbsp; I thought he was crazy an he told me to
wait and I would see things. I am a skeptic and I made this clear. I
was sitting on the couch one afternnon facing the stairway which has no
windows no reflections no nothing there is a window on the landing and
one at the bend but the stairway its self has no windows.&nbsp; I
looked up at my husband to say something cuz I had just seen him walk
down stairs and something was floating down my stairs. Wasn't a form
just a haze you know just something was there......I told my husband
again after that things have only been worse.&nbsp; I was sick in bed
sitting up one night when i felt something rub my back thought it was
my kitten but it was not so i sat back down and it happened 3 more
times like someone was trying to massage my back with tiny hands.&nbsp;
Instead of crying out to my hubby which I do so often I just turned on
my light and fell asleep.&nbsp; The next morning I t d my hubby and he
said something had been messing with him also..he let the dogs out when
they came in he shut and locked the door WE NEVER LEAVE OUR DOORS
UNLOCKED NO MATTER HOME OR NOT then he sat back down in the family room
to finish his show and he felt freezing air when he got up to check the
door was standing wide open to lock this door you need a deadbolt. I
said to my husband I dont care if anything is here I dont mind sharing
a home I just don't want to be touched again or see anything
else.....being touched by something not there is too scarey it has
happened to me in my sleep, in the tub, getting ready for work, alot of
times.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I aid that....dont see too many things
after the thing i seen in the dining room on all 4's but with human
shape i'm thankfull....now however I have heard someone outside my
bedroom door going PSSST&nbsp; PSHHTTT making those noises and a
woman's voice kind of moaning like she is tired of something...there is
so many things i could go on about i just wanted to know im not the
only one experiencing these things.<br>
Thank you for your time<br>

My Mom's Story<br>
<br>
By: crystald225@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
When my mom was 17 and her twin brothers were 15 they lived with my
great grandma whom I call "Nanny". My nanny lives in this old old house
that once belonged to her mother and her mother' pet bird who had both
passed just 8 months before(her mother b/c of sickness and the bird b/c
no one really paid it any attention after her mom died). I must say
myself that this house is weird. It is shaped like a barn and it's 2
stories high. My mothers incident happened on the second story. My
mother was down stairs watching T.V. while her brothers were upstairs
asleep in the bunk beds this was around 11 pm. My nanny wasn't home yet
she had been working late. While my mother was sitting on the sofa
debating whether to go to bed or wait for nanny she heard a loud
screech that sounded like&nbsp; her great grandma's bird. She shrugged
it off and got up to get a snack. From the kitchen you can clearly see
the twins' bedroom. She was walking toward the kitchen and looked up to
see the twins' light on in the room and went up to investigate. When
she got to the room the light switch was flipped down, but the light
was on. She flipped the switch a couple times and the light still would
not go out. About this time she heard the T.V. downstairs get very very
loud she ran to the stairs and looked down and didn't see anything and
walked back to the twins' room(the light still had not went off and it
was still flipped down) My mother then heard her deceased great
grandmothers voice say "Scottie, Scottie wake up!". Scottie who was on
the top bunk then started rolling towards the side of the bunk bed
opposite of the all where the rail should have been, but he refused to
put it there. He was getting ready to roll off when my Uncle Stephen
who was on the bottom bunk dead asleep threw a body pillow from the
side of him and onto the floor. Not a second later Scottie rolled off
and hit the pillow. The light went off the T.V. turned down and my
mother who nearly passed out heard the bird screech again and heard her
great grandma say "Calm down Femmi"(the birds name).&nbsp; <br>

MY AUNTS PRESENCE<br>

&nbsp;<br>
<br>
HELLO,&nbsp; MY NAME IS ROANNE.&nbsp; I REALLY ENJOY READING THE
STORIES POSTED HERE.&nbsp; I PERSONALLY HAVEN'T HAD AN EXPERIENCE
WITH&nbsp; A GHOST.&nbsp; ALTHOUGH WHEN I USED TO BE HOME ALONE I
ALWAYS FELT AS IF SOMEONE WAS WITH ME.&nbsp; I COULD SENSE IT.&nbsp; I
AM NOT A PARANOID PERSON ACTUALLY I ENJOY BEING ALONE AND I WISH I
COULD BE ALONE MORE OFTEN.&nbsp; I THINK I MIGHT HAVE AN IDEA OF WHO IT
IS,&nbsp; AN AUNT OF MINE.&nbsp; SHE DOES HAVE A CONNECTION WITH
ME.&nbsp; WHEN SHE PASSED ON I WAS VERY YOUNG AND I DIDN'T KNOW THE
HISTORY SHE AND I SHARED.&nbsp; NOW THAT I KNOW I UNDERSTAND WHY SHE
WAS STILL WITH ME.&nbsp; SHE WAS JUST HERE TO MAKE SURE I'M OK AND FOR
ME TO ACKNOWLEDGE HER.<br>
OFTEN WHEN I WAS ILL,&nbsp; MY MUM WOULD FIND ME IN BED WITH MY HAND
UP,&nbsp; AS THOUGH SOMEONE WAS HOLDING MY HAND AND SITTING AT MY
SIDE.&nbsp; SHE WOULD PUT MY HAND DOWN BUT A FEW MINUTES LATER WHEN SHE
WALKED IN SHE WOULD SEE MY HAND UP AGAIN.<br>
AT FIRST I WAS AFRAID,&nbsp; BUT SLOWLY THE FEAR DISAPPEARED.&nbsp; I
DON'T SENSE HER ANYMORE,&nbsp; MAYBE SHE HAS MADE PEACE WITH WHAT SHE
WAITED AROUND FOR<br>

Just a Story<br>
<br>
By: GGarza@vitro.com<br>
<br>
Hello. I thought of sending a peculiar occurrence that happened to me,
but I hadn't found the right place. Here it goes. My grandma was
diagnosed with cancer in 1996, she was treated&nbsp; (surgery &amp;
radiotherapy) and we all thought she was cured &#8211;in my case I really
didn&#8217;t know much about cancer and when the doctor said that the cancer
was out I never thought it would come back-. In December 1999 I was
living out of town and it had been a month since I had seen my grandma
(a really long time for us) I was supposed to come pick her up and take
her to my house for the Holidays, on the 18th she felt sick and went to
the hospital, I arrived on the 19th and she still wanted to go back to
my house for Christmas so against what the doctor thought best she
checked out, her bladder was no longer working and she felt weak all
the way (although now that I&#8217;m writing this it sounds that she was
pretty bad already I always thought it was going to pass, I mean she
had overcome cancer, hadn&#8217;t she?? stupid of me). After an 8 hour trip
we arrived to our destination and I had to take her to the hospital,
she stayed there until the 31st, an aunt and myself would take turns in
staying with her day and night, all through this I still thought she
was ok. On the 30th, my grandma had been in a great mood she had been
joking and playing with me all day and so when my aunt arrived I headed
home, I would arrive at home and start cleaning and preparing next
day&#8217;s supper I was pretty occupied with what I was doing and my two
children were sleeping as I was mopping the kitchen, the back door had
a sort of mirrored glass, I was in front of this door when I felt
someone walk behind me I looked up and I saw a shadow walk by (the
feeling was more intense than what I actually saw), what went through
my head as I saw this shadow was the memory of my grandpa deceased for
5 years at the time, I dropped the mop forgot about everything, ran up
the stairs and cuddled in between my sleeping children (although I
would love to say that when I thought it was my grandpa I felt at
peace, I can&#8217;t, I was scared to death). I woke up at around 6 in the
morning to the smell of roses, my aunt phoned at 7 to let me know that
my grandma had fallen into a coma, all day this smell of roses
persisted I would smell it everywhere. She died on Jan.1,2000 at 00:08
she never came out of the coma, the cancer had invaded most of her
organs. I know it&#8217;s not really scary, but it&#8217;s the only experience I
could not explain logically. I have never read of anything that has to
do with the smell of roses if anyone has had a similar experience
please let me know so I can understand this better.<br>

Strange Happenings<br>
<br>
By: philip.jacobs53@ntlworld.com <br>
<br>
<br>
Hi there my name is phil i used to live in a bungalow in surrey for 13
years with my parents the property was built in 1953 and we think was
built on an old forest, we moved there when i was 13 years old, im now
29 and i have moved out but things still happen my parents have now
sold the property on, any way when we moved in we wasnt told that the
previous owner had suddenly died in my mum and dads bedroom from a
heart attack. we where there about 3 months before we started noticing
odd things like objects that where put in safe places we would find
elsewhere like keys and pictures would move, strange cold areas that
normally would be in the hallway creaking floorboards at night and
strange shadows that the cat would avoid sometimes the cat would stop
dead in its tracks and not go into that room instead would just sit
there and stare at nothing as far as we could see. <br>
These things continued for about 3 years but we got used to them, but
we had the odd visitor refusing to go into the bathroom to wash there
hands as for some reason was never very warm including the summer
months, a chill would run down your spine and you wouldn't like being
in there very long. I remember one morning it was a Sunday i was 16 at
the time, i was lying in bed relaxing now i was definitely awake
because the tv was on and it was 7.7.30am, i was lying on my back just
deciding whether to get up or not when the cat jump of the bed at a
very high speed and ran from the room just then i felt this pressure on
my chest as if someone was pushing down on me i couldn't breath that
well i couldn't shout out for help nor could i move as if i was
paralysed, this must of lasted for about maybe 2 mins then whatever it
was lifted of me i jumped out of bed and went into the kitchen where my
mum was making breakfast she said i looked very pale and white and when
i told her what had happened she told me that she had had a similar
thing happen to her only that she felt as if someone was trying to
strangle her and at the same time about 7.30am, when i told a friend of
mine who at the time was into the paranormal suggested that the person
who died of a heart attack in the house that we were feeling the pain
he went through, but i wasn't sure about this thought as i think that
something or someone in that house wanted us out.<br>
A few strange things happened for the next few years but generally was
quite ish, but things started happening to me again when i was about 20
ish, i had the same experience of someone pushing down on me at the
same time as before also im sure it used to follow me about as
sometimes i would get this feeling of someone being right behind me, i
then saw a dark tall grey haired man standing in the hall when i came
home late one night and when i said whos there because my mum and dad
were on holiday at the time in dissapered in front of my eyes,
naturally i didn't stay there that night as i was by myself.<br>
But i then started seeing faces in the wall shadows moving at night
doors blowing open evening thou there wasn't any wind around so a
friend of my dads who was a born again Christian brought a clergy round
to move through the house and said prayers in each room, he didn't like
the hall, bathroom or my mum and dads bedroom whilst in this room he
had a picture thrown at him which smashed against the wall he then
simple left a bit shaken but not sure what quite happened. things were
bad for a while but then got better, i stayed another 6 years in that
house but had to leave as didn't quite feel happy there my mum and dad
have now sold the property on to someone else naturally we didn't
inform them of the problems there, my old neighbours have said that the
new owners have asked who the dark tall grey haired man is where they
think could be the previous owner who died there but they are not sure,
i was just wandering what sort of ghost or ghosts we had there and why
has it not found peace and why was it not happy maybe you could answer
these questions or maybe not im just curious now of what was there.<br>

My Best friends Ghost Named Jack<br>
<br>
By: ferreira@execulink.com <br>
<br>
I have a best friend (Manndie) and she has always said that there was a
ghost named Jack that watches over her, at the time she told me this I
was about 9 years old, I was invited to her house on a Saturday just
for the day but I eneded up staying there till after dinner, She told
me Jack likes to hang around in the basement of her house, and likes to
open this old refrigerator, freezer door. I never thought about it
until when we went down into the basement to play, I felt like someone
was watching me, later we went upstairs and her mother told us dinner
was ready and told us we were eating outside so before I went for
dinner I told my friend (Manndie) that i'll be out in a second and she
said o.k and she went out to have dinner, I forgot my toy downstairs
and I remeber when I looked downstairs the lights were off and the
freezer door was wide open, at this time I was thinking of wether or
not I should go down there so I just stood there for about 1 min, all
of a sudden I heard someone call my name it was like a soft whisper
voice, I thought it was my friend (Manndie) I knew she was outside with
her parents having dinner, but I thought maybe she came back inside to
get something, so I went downstairs I looked all over for her but
couldn't find her anywhere, now I felt very scared and I grabbed my toy
and ran upstairs thinking someone was watching every move I made. I
went outside and saw my friend ( Manndie) and her parents out there
having dinner, I didn't want to bring anything up about it in front of
my firends parent. So after dinner I told my friend (Manndie) what I
had heard and felt and she said that it was her ghost Jack, then she
started to bring up how Jack communicates to her and she sometimes sees
him walkin around down there, she dosen't seem to be startled at this
because she believes that Jack is there to watch over her.<br>

Knoxville, Tn, Evil on Copper Ridge Rd<br>
<br>
<br>
By: kburgess2004@comcast.net <br>
<br>
This past Sept. my sister and I visted this place. I have noticed that
it is no longer on your web site. This place is truley haunted. I am no
gohst hunter but we thought we would give it a try on our vacation. I
have never been so scared in my life as I was that night. <br>
When we got there no sooner than we got out of the car and crossed the
street I was overcome with fear. We went into the graveyard and was
looking around. I looked at the building and saw a glowing light, I
just thought it was from a street light on the other side of the
builing but my neice that was standing beside me never saw it.I was
taking some pictures of headstones when my sister started running
toward me yelling did you hear that? Was saying what i didnt hear any
thing. So to say we all ran scared, She said she heard a dog growling.<br>
We left and went back to our motel. We got brave and decided to go
back. When we got back we went in at the building and not the
graveyard.This time it was like i couldn't breath. After a few minutes
I was ok. We walked around the outside of the building , my sister
wanted to go inside but only if one of us went with her I said I aint
going in there. So we ended up back in the graveyard. We start looking
around again and my sister is at the biggest on there when I see this
black shadowy figurereaching for her. I start yelling run its going to
get you. My neice all so sees it. We run for my car and refuse to get
back out. My sister and her other daughter go back. I won't get back
out so my neice and I wait for them. So I do belive there is Evil on
Copper Ridge Rd.<br>
Thank You<br>

Haunted High School <br>
&nbsp;<br>
By: cgarza@wcnet.net <br>
<br>
<br>
I live in a small town in Texas. For as long as I can remember,
everyone has told stories of our high school being haunted. Before I
begin I will give you some background info. The high school was built,
I believe, in the 1920&#8217;s. As the years have gone by, the school as been
expanded on, but the original building is still there. It is in this
part of the building that most of the weird experiences have happened.
These are all stories told to me mostly by the teachers. I have never
experienced anything myself. I will try to remember everything. To
start with, one of the classrooms in the old building belongs to Mrs.Pr
(I wont mention anyone&#8217;s name for confidentiality). She has told me
that there is a cold spot in the corner of the room. She has placed a
large cabinet in that corner because her students would frequently mess
around there. She also told me of a time when she was picking up for
summer vacation and had neatly stacked all her books up in the desks
before leaving for the night. She was the only person there at the time
and she locked the room up. The next morning she returned to her room
and found all the books she had stacked open and thrown throughout the
room. I have taken her class and sometimes without warning the mobiles
on her ceiling will move, but there is no breeze to move them. Also,
the smell of lemons can be smelt everyone once in awhile; sometimes
when she has her own scented candles on which are never lemon.<br>
The main hauntings, I guess you could say, come from the gym. For
years, people have had strange things happen. About four summers ago,
we had a teacher bring in some paranormal investigators to have a look
at the high school gym. They told us that the center of the &#8220;enery&#8221; I
guess is located under the gym in the girl&#8217;s weight room. This made
sense since on several occasions the punching bag down there (which is
very heavy) will swing violently on its own. Also in pictures taken of
the girl&#8217;s basketball team, a white haze can be seen in the top corner
of the picture near the basketball goal.(I have seen this picture.) My
friend is a photographer for the yearbook, and in a lot of her pictures
taken in the old high school whites balls called orbs my a teacher
there can be seen in them. Anyway, the investigators took video of the
gym while they were walking around and twice when they cross the gym
they are followed by a burst of light I guess is the best way to
describle it. They also left a tape recorder in the weight room during
the investigation, and upon listening to it heard voices that sound
raspy and far off. I will never forget what the voices said though (
the reason we could view the tape and listen to the recording is
because the head of the investigation has a website that she posted
this on.). They said, &#8220; no one hears us.&#8221; <br>
I just thought I would share this with all of you after reading the
many experiences of others on this website. I attend this high school
currently. Many rumors fly around about who the ghosts can be. The most
reasonable is that of an old janitor who died, and also some of the
high school students were in a crash I don&#8217;t know in what year but many
believe they can be there as well. The investigator doesn&#8217;t believe
they are harmful, but she also recommended not trying to contact them
also. She believes they inhabit the gym because that used to be a
source of high energy. (Pep Rallies, athletics, and such) That is all I
know.<br>

Haunted? You tell me<br>
<br>
By: FEISTYBRIT@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Ok, after reading some of the stories here I thought I would take this
opportunity to share an experience I had back in 1992-1993 in an
apartment my friend and I were living in it at the time.&nbsp; It was a
relatively new apartment complex at that time, only 3 years old.<br>
Things were innocuous enough to begin with, so neither my friend nor I
really thought anything was odd.&nbsp; Items of food, jewellery or
clothing would disappear and reappear frequently, days or weeks later,
in strange places other than those where they had originally
belonged.&nbsp; We each thought the other person was misplacing these
items and forgetting we'd moved them.&nbsp; It was quite amusing at
times to open up the cupboard and find the cheese in with the dinner
plates or the chicken pies in your closet.&nbsp; Oh and socks used to
disappear a lot, well, usually one,&nbsp; but I think that was the
washing machine eating them.<br>
Often there would be a dark shape out of the corner of your eye and
when you turned to look there was nobody there. You could 'feel'
someone there too.<br>
Laying in bed at night I would hear the front door open and footsteps
walking across the living room, and thinking it was my roommate coming
back in from her night out I would call out to her and get no
reply.&nbsp; She hadn't come home.&nbsp; No one was home except me.<br>
I was woken up one night by voices whispering very close by.<br>
I thought it was someone chatting outside my bedroom window at 3
o'clock in the morning but when I woke up more fully I realised it was
coming from my bedside radio.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the radio was not turned
on. It was not even plugged in. <br>
The TV would turn on by itself.&nbsp; Usually when we were in bed. It
would come on really loudly and startle you awake.&nbsp; And it wasn't
even on a channel we liked to watch.<br>
One night my friend had volunteered to sleep in the living room on the
couch because my husband and daughters were over for a visit (another
long story) and my daughters had taken her bedroom over.&nbsp; Lynne
told me the next day that during the night she had been woken up by the
feeling of someone standing over her.&nbsp; She said the feeling was
very intense and (at this point she had not opened her eyes ) she just
KNEW someone was standing over her, watching her.&nbsp; She at first
thought it was either myself or one of my daughters but for some reason
didn't want to look.&nbsp; Eventually she said, she had to look and as
soon as she opened her eyes the feeling was gone, and nobody was there.
My family and I were all fast asleep.<br>
Then over a period of time things became even more weird.&nbsp; We had
some fresh skimmed milk in the fridge, just bought that morning from
the local 7-11 which was only across the parking lot of where we
lived.&nbsp; A&nbsp; short time later we went to use the milk and it
was curdled.&nbsp; <br>
No harm done, we took it back to the the store and they gave us another
fresh carton.&nbsp; We shook the carton and it sounded 'normal' so off
we trotted home for our 'tea'.&nbsp; We opened up this carton to pour
into our tea, and lo and behold, curdled again.&nbsp; I mean thick,
lumpy, sludgy goo.&nbsp; Not weak, watery, skimmed milk.&nbsp; So,
thinking this was just bad luck when all we wanted was a cup of tea, we
took it back again.&nbsp; The store clerk must have thought we were
boiling it or something, but gave us another carton and after we shook
it a few times and squeezed it to try and determine if it was fresh we
took it home.&nbsp; But that one was curdled too.&nbsp; We gave up on
having our cup of tea at that point.<br>
Not long after that I woke up one morning and my ring finger felt
sore.&nbsp; I looked down at my hand and my engagement ring was
buckled.&nbsp; It wasn't a little bit bent, but completely buckled into
a triangle shape.&nbsp; It had been perfectly fine when I went to bed
and my wedding ring was normal.&nbsp; It was extremely hard to get off
of my finger and when I did finally get it off it wasn't only bent, but
actually broken almost completely through the gold band in 3
places.&nbsp; I don't know how a ring could be broken even if I had
laid on my hands.&nbsp; They would only have pressed the ring into a
mattress and maybe I am wrong, but I don't think that is enough
pressure to bend a diamond ring. ( Of course, maybe hubby had bought me
a ring out of a lucky bag, never thought of that!).<br>
I took it to a jeweller for repair and he said in all his years as a jeweller he had never seen a ring broken like that.<br>
(After having it repaired, a short time later I somehow managed to drop
5 rings in the shower and the only one that disappeared down the
plughole never to be seen again was this engagement ring.&nbsp; All of
my other rings stayed in one place).&nbsp; <br>
I realise none of these events are horrifying, ( apart from the curdled
milk, have you ever seen skimmed milk curdle?....in 2 minutes or
less?...its worse than the regular stuff let me tell you!), but this is
the only house or living quarters that I have experienced any strange
occurrences like this.&nbsp; So I thought this was the place to share
it.<br>
We do, both my friend and I, believe that there is something wrong with
that apartment as the feelings and events were getting stronger and
less friendly the longer we stayed there.&nbsp; Eventually we moved out
into another apartment in the same complex and never had any other
things like that occur.&nbsp; I was often tempted to go and ask the new
occupants if anything weird happened to them but didn't want them to
think we were crazy.<br>

Black Shadow Man<br>
<br>
<br>
By: rodeo_rita04@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
A couple years ago, me and my dad moved in with my new stepmom.
Everything was going just fine, I just got a new horse so everything
was perfect. Well one night when I went to bed everything was normal.<br>
Just so you understand the story better I will explain what my room
looked like. I had my rat cage by my bed, and at the foot of my bed I
had my computer that I always left on. And on this night I had an extra
blanket on my computer chair.<br>
Well I just turned off my bedside light and was staring at my screen
saver, until I fell asleep. But while I was staring at the computer,
something seemed different. It seemed closer than usual, and seemed to
be getting even closer, so I looked at the opposite wall and it seemed
to be getting closer. Then it stoped and everything seemed to be back
to normall. I just thought maybe I fell asleep.<br>
So I shook it out of my mind, then everything seemed to be not normall
again, and some how I seemed to know what was coming. Because all I
could think of was 'Keep and eye on that door (bedroom door)' Then a
black shaped, shadowy man came in. Well of course I was scared.Then he
walked to the side of my bed and just stood there, did nothing but
stand there. He then walked back to my door way and turned to stare at
me again. So my thought was run past him and get to my parents room. (I
thought this was all a dream) <br>
So got out of bed and started to run to my door and get past this man.
But once I tried to kinda run through him, he was completely solid, I
knew this because I fell backwords, so I got up and ran to the other
side of my room. The man just stood there for about 2 minutes then my
light turned on and my dad walked in (the man vanished). He asked me
what was wrong and I told him about the man that was in my room and
then I asked if I ran into him a minute ago (thinking maybe it was a
dream and I dream walked into him.) but he said no, he woke up because
he herd me scream "Please daddy! Help Me! DAD HELP!" But I can bet my
life I never said that.<br>
This isn't the only time ive seen this man. When me and my family were
vacationing in Mexico, I had a nightmare and my parents woke me up and
brought me over to their room (This hotel room had 2 rooms and 1 bath.)
to calm me down. The lights were off of course, but they had the
bathroom light on, so there wouldnt be to much light in the room, and I
was sitting on their bed. Then I looked over at a couch that was in
their room, and there was the shadowy man sitting there laughing at me.
So I started screaming, because of course I was scared and my parents
didn't know y I was screaming, but the man was still sitting there
laughing, and I was trying to point this out to my parents but they
couldnt see him. <br>

The Little Girl<br>
<br>
By: Vlilangel190@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
One day while my family was out I stayed home by my self I then started
to feel a breeze so then i went to go get a blanket and i felt like if
someone was watching me. I went upstairs to my room I saw a really
bright shadow. I got frightened so I started running to my room but
right then my door opened. I went inside I saw a glare near my bed, and
its image started showing up it looked like a little girl. So I told
her to leave me alone. Covering my self up i felt a chill i started
crawling to the hall way near the steps and it was standing right there
in front of me. My parents came home right then so they tried to open
the front door, but i went to open it but it was already unlocked i
told them what had happened. They couldn't believe what i was saying. I
went to go drink some water then i went to sleep, but i couldn't it
seemed like the little girl was watching me i can still see her to this
day but it does not frighten me. it sometimes seems like she is talking
to me. I can tell when she is there because i either get the chills or
i feel if someone is touching me. i moved not to long ago but i will
always remember her. I wish i knew what she was trying to tell me or
leave me alone. i will remember that forever.<br>

I had to move Rooms<br>
<br>
By: ccool@cox-internet.com<br>
<br>
My family had moved into this house, the old owner a middle aged man
moved because of the memories, two years earlier his wife had died
giving childbirth. Soon after we moved in my older brother decided to
move back in and took the room across from mine. I hated my room it was
always cold and I was scared to be in it by myself. I would lay on my
bed and watch tv. Two times I saw "ghosts". my dad sometimes went in my
brothers room to play his play station. Out of the couner of my eye in
broad day light I was&nbsp; an older man slightly bald wearing a white
shirt walk into my brothers room. I thought it was my dad, but the
lights didnt turn on and my dog started to cry. Soon after I saw a
young girl walk into my brothers room, she had long dark brown hair and
was wearin a white night gown. We have a mirror at the end of the hall
between our rooms and while walking down the hall a couple times I
would see people behind me. One time there was a very tall skinny man
standing behind me about 10 feet staring into the mirror, i told my mom
and she thought it was funny, she gave him the name "frank". A second
time i was walking down the hall, looked up into the mirror and a dark
figure with a flowing dress ran across the hall. Then one night I was
sleeping and was woken up by a man standing beside my bed staring at me
and breathing deeply, I was to scared to move or talk. After I fell
asleep I had a dream about the devil, I swear I felt like I was awake
and somr<br>
ing was holding me down I couldnt even move my head. After those things
happened I wouldnt go to sleep until my brother got home. One night
after he got home I decided to sleep on the couch in tha living room.
my eyes were shut and it was dark. we have big speakers and there was a
flower pot on them by the window. I hurd the flower pot slide across
the speaker but was to scard to open my eyes. I was lying on myback
with one arm under the blanket and one arm on top of the blanket. Not a
minute after I hurd the flower pot move something grabbed my hand and
squeezed it I swung my arm out and didnt hit anything so i quickly
opened my eyes and turned on the light behind me but nothing was there.
I was so scard I couldnt sleep for days. my brother moved out soon
after and I took his room, ever since Ive been in his old room strange
things stopped happening.<br>

Grapevine Cemetery<br>
<br>
By: AKASHADOBIE@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I saw on your list of haunted places that Grapevine Cemetary in
Madisonville KY was on it. I have my own experience with the mentioned
Angel.&nbsp; The angel is known as The Morton's Angel.&nbsp; Here is my
experience.&nbsp; Me, my boyfriend at the time and a friend of ours
went there to see her on three separate occasions.&nbsp; The first time
we went I looked up at her and it was like I couldn't take my eyes off
of her, her eyes moved and it seemed that she looked at me and started
crying regular tears, she looked at my then boyfriend and started
crying regular tears.&nbsp; Well one night we took this devil
worshipper friend of ours up there to see her since he wanted to well
the same thing happened except we started hearing footsteps and when
she looked at our devil worshipper friend her face changed to looking
old and worn out, she started crying blood and her eyes started
glittering white light. Also this particular angel is not the only one
said to reside in this particular cemetary there is also a black angel
that locals have labeled the death angel and supposedly anyone who sees
her dies shortly after the encounter.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also noticed Hell's
Half Acre was listed I think it would be good to advise everyone that
nobody is allowed to go up there anymore and anyone caught will be sent
to jail or I've heard even shot by the land owner.<br>

Luckily For Me<br>
<br>
<br>
By: BabyBluYoshi@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
The first two stories are of private residencies... The second two are
public areas, which are both accessable thanks to tours. ^_^ ~Erika<br>
Story 1: The Resident<br>
My family moved into our LA/Orange county home about 18 years ago, so
I've been here all 16 years of my life. When I was little, I always
fancied my 'invisible friend', whom I have only recently named 'Erik.'
I talked to him up until I was about 5 (So my parents told me), then I
stopped. When I turned 15, I started seeing things. Out of the corner
of my eye, while I was on the computer, I would see a figure in black
standing in the doorway to my room (My computer is in my parents room,
being they have the alternate phone line - Their door is directly down
the hall from mine. You can look through my door from theirs.) I would
also smell odd smells, like death, or some sort of fish when none is
cooking. There will also be cold spots in the same parts of the
downstairs hallway, where most of the activity has taken place.
Occasionally, even, I will feel a hand ontop of mine while I'm waiting
for something, such as when my parents were yelling on the phone when
they found out my mom was unable to get a much-needed surgery.<br>
Lucky for me, that's not all. <br>
There was an instance where I actually -heard- something. I sat in the
salon, doing my homework as I normally did. I was home alone. Out of
nowhere came a 'THUD-thump-thumpa-thumpa' repatedly from our den. It
was rhythmic, and rather loud. I let it run its course for a moment
before becoming frustrated and yelling, 'Erik, please! I'm trying to do
my homework!' ...It stopped, and I swear... there was an almost
regretful sigh afterwards. <br>
I have also seen the same spirit in several places, which has led my
friend to believe he's my guardian. He had startled me once at school
by appearing in the doorway to our recreation room (naturally, only I
could see it), which caused me to move from the line of running
freshmen, who would have otherwise run into me.<br>
I am planning to do an EVP as soon as I get an external mic for my recorder.<br>
Story 2: Touched by an Angel<br>
A small home located in a suburb of Chicago houses a very strange
spirit. The room I stay in while visiting my grandparents' house is
across the hall from what used to be my Uncle's, now deceased. Every
now and then, the hanging doors on the closet will sway, even when
there is no draft nor air conditioner. In the night, there will be
occasional whispering. The spirit has never apepared to be malicious,
which has led me to believe it is the spirit of my uncle. Though the
house was built during WWII, there is no other reasonable explanation.<br>
Story 3: Nautical Happenings<br>
This is a story I'm sure many people have. It begins on a warm summer
day upon the Queen Mary, which is permanently docked in Long Beach,
California. I was visiting with my grandparents (from above story) and
my parents and brother, since I had been begging to go for a long time.
My grandmother and I had just passed the closed-off fitness room, which
my parents, brother and grandfather had stopped at to gawk at. Gran had
gone ahead a bit, so I was walking virtually alone. I descended the
stairs at the end of the hall slowly, half because I was tired, half
because I was waiting for the group of four to catch up. As I went
down, I felt a violent jerk on my backpack, as if someone didn't want
me to progress any further. I turned immediately, believing it was my
brother being a jerk. There was no one there.<br>
As we left, I turned back to the boat to take a final snapshot before
departing, knowing it would be a long time before I'd see it again. On
the highest point of the boat, closed off to the public, I saw a woman
in white with dark hair, her dress blowing in the wind. I thought it
was an employee, until I looked again, and there was nothing there, and
no door through which she could have gone. <br>
Story 4: Purple and Gold<br>
Luckily for me, this has only happened today, so the details are easy to remember. <br>
Of course, every ghost-researching person, serious or phony, in this
country has heard of the Whaley House... the most haunted house in the
United States, whose residents include the playful Yankee Jim and Anna
Whaley, whose lavander perfume can occasionally be smelled by visitors
and employees alike. <br>
I had gone upstairs long before my family did, eager to view the house
I had read so much about. There were only a few of us upstairs at the
time - one woman and three men, only one of which was wearing any kind
of body spray (I sniffed as I passed them... don't ask why. Impulse, I
suppose), which was Axe worn by one of the men. I entered the room
which had once been a playhouse, and froze in my tracks. The
unmistakable smell of lavander perfume hung in the air for a moment,
then dissapeared. This happened in several points in the house, which
can also be confirmed by my mother, who later smelled it in a different
area. We also witnessed a moving curtain, which I checked for a draft.
There wasn't any. No one had been in the room for a while, either - I
would have seen them, being I was in the room when the curtain started
moving.<br>

Late Night Visit<br>
<br>
By: labonte_grl@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
I also have a story. One Night, just recently, i was laying in bed, and
i had to go bathroom. I got up, when downstairs, and came back up and
looked in my mirror..I was wide awake..So you have to believe me..I was
looking in my mirror, and all of a sudden, i seen something walk by my
mirror.i rubbed my eyes, and it was right in front of me, looking at
me..it walked towards my window, and then turned around after 5 minutes
and walked back.&nbsp; then that morning, MY parents said that we all
left, and it was just them, and they heard our front door open and
close. my mom said, "Hello? Anyone there?" No answer.&nbsp; So, my dad
stepped in and said, "Welcome Home Edna!"&nbsp; Please email me with
any questions.&nbsp; I'll tell you about the ghost in my house.&nbsp;
Her name is Edna Othote, and She was born January 12, 1898. She died
January 15, 2000, a few years before we moved in here. She was 102, and
she died in our dining room. We see and hear her every now and then.
Thank you for u time to read this!<br>

Grandfather and Others<br>
<br>
<br>
By: dyatta@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
The first experience I had was one year after my grandfathers death.&nbsp; He <br>
died the year prior on my sisters birthday.&nbsp; The year after she was getting <br>
ready to go out and he walked into her bedroom.&nbsp; He told her to sit on the <br>
bed beside him and after a short conversation he told her he loved her and <br>
he was sorry he died on her birthday.&nbsp; She won't talk about it other than <br>
the fact he looked so "real".<br>
Now my own personal experience.&nbsp; After completing a survival school in <br>
California I took a couple weeks off and went home to cenral Pennsylvania.&nbsp; <br>
Being late summer the weather favorable and I decided to camp out in the <br>
woods.&nbsp; With a brand new flashlight, lighter and hot dogs I was set.<br>
Not long after I estblished camp and cooking a "dog", I heard leaves <br>
rustling.&nbsp; I pointed my flashlight in the direction of the noise and at the <br>
same time my player went dead.&nbsp; Just after that, this man came walking up <br>
through my campsite.&nbsp; The only thing I could see is he was wearing a white <br>
T-shirt and other than his head, that's it!&nbsp; He walked right past me and <br>
didn't even look. Needless to say, after that and no other noises in the <br>
forest, I jumped in my vehichle and left the site.<br>

Ghost's have Feelings Too<br>
<br>
By: sajajo2002@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
When I was 18, I moved into my Nanas house. Two of my<br>
aunts lived there too so I had a room in the basement.<br>
There was a ghost we called Sarah. (The reason is<br>
another story.) I had many experiences there. Once, my<br>
aunt and I were decorating my room and many wierd<br>
things happened all day. When my other aunt came in,<br>
we were telling her Sarah had been active. She was<br>
standing at the top of the stairs and never really<br>
believed in ghosts, so she was laughing at us and<br>
saying that we were imagining things etc. When she<br>
jerked forward like someone had pushed her and fell<br>
down the stairs. We ran to her to see if she was ok.<br>
She was bruised and shaken up, but mostly ok. She said<br>
she felt someone push her. There was no one else in<br>
the house (we doubled checked.) After that, she never<br>
laughed at Sarah again.<br>

Farewell Friend<br>
<br>
<br>
By: maryahharwood@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
I don't know if this would be anything but I thought I should share it.....<br>
I've been reading some stories about friends passing away and then
saying goodbye in their own way... Well I had a similar experience....<br>
When I was about 17 I dated a boy younger than I... We broke up and
still remained close friends.... I left for summer camp only to find
out when I returned that he had passed away the day I left.... I never
even got to say goodbye, I was devistated(sp?) I cried for what seemed
like forever the night I found out until I finally fell asleep...<br>
I dreamt that I was at summer camp and there was my friend.... I was so
excited to see him and I called for him... He ran over and I gave him a
huge hug, crying, telling him that I was told he was dead..... Well he
put me at arms length, smiled at me and said "you know I'm not really
here." Then someone called my name so I turned to see who it was and
when I looked back towards my friend, he was gone..... I woke up with
tears streaking down my face....<br>
Another time that I think he was with me teling me he was still there
was when I was at college.... I was looking on the internet for the
news article about his death when all of a sudden someone instant
messaged me... We got to talking and I found out it was his older
brother..... We ended up getting together and are still together to
this day.... We even have a beautiful 8 month old daughter....<br>
Now I don't know if this is anything, but it sure seemed like something
at the time...... I would appreciate any emails explaining this to me
or from anyone with similar experiences<br>

Haunted House in New York<br>
<br>
By: theshort2003@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I herd this story from my friends mom(the mom had 3 kids 2 girls 1 boy
keep in mind). They got a house that was 100 or 200 years old.&nbsp;
The only thing she thought was weird about the house was that there cat
would every night be in the middle of the hallway in the which was
between the rooms.&nbsp; The other thing was that there was a small
beavus and butthead lookin picture sketched on the wall in the attic
(where the mom's room was)that was freaky lookin and gave her a bad
fealing.&nbsp; Her two daughters in seperate rooms would complane about
there cover being pulled off of them and the oldest daughter talked
about a ghost who would talk 2 her named Agatha and the younger
daughter said once she woke up and her shoes were floating in the air
and she turned the light on and they were in a different place from
where she put them.&nbsp; The mom thought they were going crazy.&nbsp;
But one day..... the mom has her room in the attic sleeping and she
fealt weight on her bed so she thought it was there cat and she kicked
around her bed and moved her covers to push it off.&nbsp; Then her
mattress fliped over and she fell off and felt/saw a cold blck thing go
over her and could not move till 5 seconds and turned her light
on.&nbsp; Then she got a specialest in ghosts to come and she said
there are 3 ghosts in the house all girls 2 are bad and said the bad
ones liked to sit on the front steps of there stairs and the 1 good
ghost of the 3 is named Agetha that liked being around the laundry
room( after she said that she completly belived her because of her
oldest daughter menchoning&nbsp; Agetha) and the bad 1's are mean 2 the
good 1.&nbsp; The specialest also said they don't like your son and cat
and said the mom should sleep with them.&nbsp; e also took digital pics
around the house and showed how there was black foggyness and took a
thomoitor in that spot and showed how the teperature went down 20
degrees and told her when they are there you will smell burning sugar
or maple surup.&nbsp; The specialest also went around the house to find
the portal and it was where the odd picture of beavus and butthead
lookin thing was.&nbsp; Then the specialest closed it and recored it

The House Was Haunted<br>
<br>
<br>
By: alwaysopenminded2003@yahoo.ca<br>
<br>
This is one of my personal favorite experiences:&nbsp; <br>
Tracy, Mark, Joe (my hubby at the time) and myself all lived in an up /
down duplex in Calgary, Alberta the year was 1994. Mark and Tracy had a
6 month old dog by the name of Ace. Ace loved Joe and I. Whenever Joe
and I arrived home Ace would race us to our bedroom, which was located
on the lower floor of the duplex. This activity with Ace continued for
a long time. One day all four of us and Ace were sitting in the
livingroom watching t.v. Out of the corner of my eye I spotted Ace
looking very intently at the south livingroom wall. I nudged Joe, who
in turn got Mark and Tracy's attention. As we all watched Ace he was
staring at the wall and then he slowly moved his head as if he watching
someone walk from the wall, past himself, and into the diningroom,
which was attached to the livingroom. We all watched as Ace got up,
walked into the diningroom and started jumping around as though he was
reaching for a snack out of a hand, standing on his hind legs, dancing
around like a dog will. <br>
A few weeks later as Joe and I entered the house, Ace was not at the
door to race us downstairs to our bedroom. Joe had to take Ace by the
collar to have him come into our bedroom. Ace wanted nothing to do with
our room. As soon as Joe let Ace go he ran from the room... <br>
Strange things began happening in th house. <br>
One afternoon Joe and I were sitting at our diningroom table. Joe had a
butter knife in his hand (Joe is of Spanish decent, olive skinned and
does not scary easily) As I sat beside Joe I noticed him looking over
my left shoulder. I asked him if I had a bug on my shoulder (hate
bugs). He did not reply, instead he dropped the knife on the table and
walked into the kitchen, which was located right off the dining room.
As I approached Joe I noticed all the color was gone from his face, I
asked him what was wrong. I had never seen him in this state. Joe
looked at me and told me he saw a black robed figure standing behind me
in the reflection of his knife. I knew he was not joking. <br>
Right after this event happened things livened up even more. I worked
night shift and Joe would drive me to work . All lights, tv, stereo
were turned off, which was normal for us as we never left anything on
when no one was home. One night as Joe and I were locking up the house,
on my way to work, we heard the stereo turn back on. Joe unlocked the
door, went inside and shut the stereo off. As soon as Joe relocked the
door the stereo came on once again. I looked at Joe and told him to
leave it as we could be kept here all night playing this game. I am no
beginner to these types of experiences. <br>
One night we were all going to bed and I was in bed before Joe. As Joe
came out of the bathroom and into the doorway of the bedroom he stopped
dead in his tracks. He just walked through the ghost he said, there was
a very cold spot that he just walked through and he felt something very
strange.. <br>
The very next morning we had a large wet spot at the top side of our
bed. We never took any type of liquid with us to bed at night. Tracy
got up later that morning and told Joe and I about the experience she
had had the night before. Tracy went to bed and was awoken very early
in the morning with finding man staring down at her. This man was
floating between the window sill and Tracy's bed just watching her. As
Tracy saw this she began praying for God and Sweet Jesus to protect
her. As she prayed the man disappeared, he left a bad feeling behind
with Tracy. Lights turning off and on began to happen all the time . We
would shut off all the upstairs lights when we went to bed and as we
got into bed the upstairs lights would be back on. <br>
These things were nerve racking on their own, but the one incident that
made me respond happened like this. I had just finished using the
bathroom off the kitchen. As I opened the bathroom door I watched as
the taps at the kitchen sink, (which was located straight across from
the bathroom door), turned on full blast, steaming hot, instantly. <br>
NO ONE WAS THERE!!! <br>
I had had enough... I got on the phone to the University Of Calgary and
contacted the Paraphycology Department. I had a Paranormal Researcher
come to visit the house. The gentleman's name is long forgotten but not
his words. He told us that with all four of us having had our own
personal past experiences with the unknown that he felt all of our
energies put together opened a door for something to enter. <br>
He felt the house was haunted.. WE MOVED!<br>

My Great Grandfathers Unhappy Ghost<br>
<br>
By: Sileenwolfe@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
i was just a little baby and the story i have for you is of what my
mother, grandmother, and grandfather have told me of all of this. <br>
my grandfather or "papa" as we still call him had just found his
mother, his father had taken him away as a baby and he had really never
met her since he was a little kid of around four. well my grandmother
when to his fathers grave and laughed, saying ha ha, hes back with his
mom now, you cant do anything. big mistake. my mom came home and found
the back hall cabnets thrown open and all the things in there scattered
on the floor. she had gone back and gotten in her car and waited for my
grandma to get back, my grandma walked in the house and asked her why
she did it. and my mom told her that she had came home to this. my
grandma believed her because my grandma is some what of a phsycic, more
of an advanced intuition to better describe it. there was a picture
that my grandma had taken of my papa and mom together tacked to the
back wall. everytime she would go down that hall she would find that
picture on the floor. so that same day her my mom and my aunt karen
went into my grandma's room which is at the end of this hall. they had
taped that picture to the wall to were it would not come off. after a
while nothing happened with the picture and my aunt said that nothing
would happen so they went to look at the picture. my great grandmothers
face had been yellowed out and there were no scratch marks on the
photo, they took it to a photologyst i suppose you call them and he
told them that he could find nothing wrong with it other than the
yellowed out face. my papa came home and had his eyes burned from a
welding accedent. my grandma told him to tell his dad's vengfull and
very angry ghost to leave. so he did and that was the last we heard
from him. now for a funny conclusion to this disturbing but true tale.
my uncle carl and his friend boby, both 14 at the time were giving my
19 year old mom hell about being so scared, playing the macho act, and
the only way to help with pain like that in my papas eyes was to soak
bread in milk and put two cut out circles on the eyes. well my mom took
that peice of bread out to my uncle and his friend and told them a
story that the bread had apeared with eye holes and a mouth, since she
was and still is my demented mother, i love her for that, but they ran
screaming all the way to my other great granmothers house a block and a
half away. this is the end of my ghost storie, but it is only one for
my grandmas house is plaughed by hauntings all the time, the rest of
them not at all like this one, most just freindly guardian angel type
ghosts that warn us if somthing bad happens. i hope you all enjoy this
story for i can assure you it is 100 percent true. thanks alot, <br>

Never Drank<br>

I have so many stories, I am so glad to find this site and see that I'm not some freak.<br>
The story that freaks me out the most happened about 8 or 9 years ago
in Dallas, TX. I was studying for prep exams in college, it was about 1
am, my phone rang it was my little sister she was only 17 but had been
out drinking and begged me to come pick her up.&nbsp; so I got into my
truck and went to grab her. On my way back with her she really need to
use the bathroom, so i pulled off the highway, went onto a dirt road
and stopped at the trinity river. she got out and did her thing right
in the middle of the river. i stood between the headlights ready to
dive in if she fell it really wasn't that deep just under knee height
but she was drunk and God only knows what could happen. i had been
standing there about 45 seconds, she's yelling that she can't pee with
someone looking at her. out of the corner of my eye i see something
rise out of the bushes about 100ft away and VERY slowly start walking
towards the truck&nbsp; The first thing that caught me were its eyes.
they were red, and glowing, not like in the movies. but like when you
take a flashlight onto a cats eyes. i freaked out and ran into the
river, grabbed my drunk as hell sister and chunked her into the truck.
all the time this thing is coming towards the truck still very slowly,
but close enough that at a glance i got a good luck at it its face was
swollen and red and blue, the first thought that came in my mind was
when i was 12 my brother and i found a dead body in the river in New
York, it had been there for days, the smell was horrific but the body
was all bloated and distorted. i thought this was the same guy so i got
back in the truck and look in the mirror and there he is, he's standing
at the back of my truck, i floored it my sister had seen it so she's
screaming yelling what is that and looking behind us, it started
"running" but it wasn't running it was just keeping up with the truck,
but then I'm fishtailing and going about 50 mph its still "running"
along side the truck we lost it as we got onto the main road but we
were both very shaken. Just telling this story makes my skin crawl. Now
all this happened in a matter of seconds, but I remember it all clear
as a bell. when I finally told someone about it the someone was a cop,
he told me that that river is used but local gangs to dump bodies and
the find victims there almost on a weekly bases.&nbsp; So there's my
story, do with it what you will. But I'll tell you one thing my sister
never drank again, and i have never stopped to go pee<br>

No One In It<br>
<br>

<br>
A friend of my husbands mother died in her home several years ago from
a heart attack. She had found her husband involved with another woman
in her own bedroom. That is the room that where she died.<br>
Each time that I would visit the home, I could feel her presence in the
room where she spent most of her free time. It was always a warm
feeling, almost comforting. It always struck me strange that I had only
met this woman about three times while she was living. I do not
understand why I was the one to "feel" her. <br>
I spent a night in the house when my husband went on a business trip.
After going to bed I decided that I would watch the tv for a while.
About an hour later I say Mrs. D walking from her bedroom, across the
livingroom, check the front door and check each of the bedrooms, then
back to her own room. I was not scared by this at all. It almost felt
like it was something that I have experienced before. When I awoke the
next morning, I looked on the bureau and saw a picture of the woman who
checked on her house before retiring. The woman I saw that night was
Mrs. D in her early thirties and about 150 lbs lighter. Her wedding
picture. <br>
A few years later Mr. D passed also. Her son decided to put the urn of
ashes from his mom into the casket with his father. My next visit to
their home was extremely uncomfortable for me. The minute I went into
the living room I could feel a tightness in my chest and difficulty in
breathing. Since that time I avoid going into that room. On two
occasions we have heard Mr. D calling out names. The voice came from a
room where there was no one in it. <br>

The Tavern Ghosts<br>
&nbsp; <br>
<br>
By: plap@primus.ca<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; <br>
The following stories about the tavern have been experienced by the present owners, the Laplantes, and are true. <br>
In 1995, after some renovations were made to the second floor, the
Laplante family moved in. The tavern consisted of the first floor and
the living quarters were on the second floor. The third floor was
empty. Nothing seemed to be amiss at this time, except for their
two-year old son. His bedroom was at the back of the tavern situated
close to his parent's bedroom. The young boy became terrified of
staying in his bedroom and would often come screaming up the hallway,
often in broad daylight, crying that there was a monster in his room.
Eventually, he had to be moved from that room because he was too
terrified to stay in there to play or sleep. <br>
In 1996, as the Laplantes were preparing the tavern for the wedding of
their oldest daughter, Mrs. Laplante observed a &#8220;white thing&#8221; crossing
a doorway in the kitchen of the tavern on the first floor. Although it
was not frightening or as she stated, &#8220;it didn't creep me out&#8221;, she
remembered the occurrence. It was in the middle of the day and in an
unlit section of the tavern. No windows were open to the outside of the
building at this time. Later that evening, Mrs. Laplante's
daughter-in-law was tending bar. As she stood at the end of the bar
looking in toward the kitchen, she also saw a &#8220;white thing&#8221; cross the
room. This completely took the daughter-in-law by surprise and she
became extremely upset. She would not remain in the tavern by herself
and ran to her husband. Not wanting anyone to think her crazy, she
didn't tell anyone about her experience. Two weeks later, when Mrs.
Laplante and an employee were telling &#8220;ghost stories&#8221;, Mrs. Laplante's
son, happened on them and on hearing about their conversation replied
that the ladies would &#8220;freak&#8221; if they heard about the &#8220;white thing&#8221;
that his wife had apparently saw a few weeks before. Mrs. Laplante
states that the hair stood up on the back of her neck because this was
the first affirmation of a &#8220;white thing&#8221; that she had heard and she
hadn't mentioned her occurrence to anyone either. When the two ladies
sat down to discuss the &#8220;sighting&#8221; they discovered it was seen in the
same place on the same day, Tuesday, August 6. <br>
In 2002, Mrs. Laplante was reading a bedtime story to her young son. In
the next bed, her daughter was already fast asleep. Mr. Laplante had
been in the shower and headed off to bed in the next room. Shortly
after, footsteps could be heard coming down the hallway and stopped at
the children's bedroom door. Thinking it was his father, the young boy,
called out &#8220;who's there?&#8221; No one answered. He questioned Mrs. Laplante
on who it might be and she replied that it was most likely his father
coming to see if they were all going to bed. She also called out and on
getting no answer settled back down to their bedtime story. After their
story, the young boy decided he wanted to sleep in his father's room so
they both returned to where he was sleeping. On entering the room, Mrs.
Laplante inquired of her husband what he had wanted when he came to the
children's room. He was fast asleep so she asked him again. On waking,
Mr. Laplante had no idea what his wife and son were talking about and
stated that he had gone right to bed and sleep after his shower and had
not left the room. Mrs. Laplante stayed awake contemplating this whole
mystery. The next morning it was discovered that the day before was
also Tuesday, August 6, the same date as the previous sightings only a
different year. <br>
After a devastating fire, that closed the tavern in 1996, the Laplantes
abandoned the building for two years. In 1998 they made a decision to
move back and renovate the building into their home. During this time,
the same young son, who had experienced the terror earlier in his
bedroom, began to be afraid to go upstairs. He had questioned his
parents about &#8220;an old man&#8221;. At one point, he had told his parents that
he heard an old man tell him to &#8220;get out of here, you little bugger&#8221;.
His parents thought nothing of it and put it down to his imagination,
running wild. At this time, Mrs. Laplante began to feel eerie when she
went to one particular area of the hallway on the second floor. This
happened to be in the same area as the young boy's previous bedroom.
Most of the family avoided this area, as it did not &#8220;feel&#8221; right. The
boy's terror increased so much, that he refused to go upstairs to his
new room at the front of the building. When it came to the point that
he would sit at the bottom of the stairs and cry because he couldn't go
up, the Laplantes sat him down to discuss &#8220;his problems&#8221;. They
discovered that something or someone on the second floor was constantly
terrorizing their son. On relating his story to his parents, they
discovered, that &#8220;someone&#8221; was calling him to every time he passed that
certain hallway or area. He told his parents, that he would yell to
leave him alone. After contacting an entity clearer, it was discovered
that there were four entities in the tavern at the time. One of them
was in the same area as the boy had stated. These were asked to leave
and the Laplantes were told they were gone. The next evening after the
clearing took place, Mrs. Laplante took her son upstairs to the
specific area and told him that the &#8220;entities&#8221; were gone. She asked him
if he could see or feel anything there. He replied that &#8220;it&#8221; was right
beside her. On hearing this, Mrs. Laplante felt the hairs prickling on
the back of her neck and left the hallway immediately. The eerie vibes
dissipated slowly over the next few days until they were completely
gone. Since then, the boy has nearly returned to a relaxed state. He is
able to go upstairs to his room again. He still worries that &#8220;it&#8221; may
return and startles easily but he can and will talk about it and refers
to &#8220;it&#8221; as his ghost. <br>
The tavern displays old photos of the people and area on its walls. In
one of these photos is a picture of an old man who the owner's son says
resembles the one he saw upstairs. The picture is of Sam Schell, a
previous and well-liked owner of the Marlbank Tavern from 1938 to 1959.
<br>
These are but a few of the experiences that the Laplantes have had
since purchasing the building in 1994. Previous owners and employees
have attested to the fact that strange things have been seen and
experienced in the building.<br>

STRANGE HILLSIDE<br>
<br>
By: Shylock1041@cs.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I AM NOT SURE WHAT TYPE OF A STORY THIS IS AS I HAVE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING OUT OF PLACE HERE BUT IT IS AN INTERESTING PLACE ANYWAY. I
BELIEVE IN GHOSTS, HAVING HAD MY SHARE OF UNUSUAL EXPERIENCES, BUT HAVE
NEVER SEEN ONE (OTHER THAN QUICK GLIMPSES OF MOVING SHAPES GOING INTO
ROOMS THAT I FIND HAVE NO ONE IN THEM WHEN I INVESTIGATE).<br>
I AM 63 YEARS OLD AND DO NOT SCARE EASILY AND NEITHER DO I FIND IT
FASCINATING TO STRETCH THE TRUTH BUT I HAVE THIS STORY THAT I FIND
MIGHT BE WORTH TELLING.<br>
I HAVE BEEN AN AVID OUTDOORSMAN FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE AND THERE IS NOTHING
THAT I ENJOY MORE THAN TO SPEND A DAY IN THE WOODS, WHETHER HUNTING OR
JUST HIKING,PICKNIKING,ETC,ETC. I WRITE THIS LEAD IN TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT I DO NOT GET SPOOKED EASILY IN THE WOODS, ON THE CONTRARY, I LOVE
MY TIME THERE.<br>
THERE IS ONE PLACE THAT I KNOW THAT I HAVE HUNTED IN THAT I WOULD NOT
BE CAUGHT IN, AFTER DARK, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT
IS WRONG WITH THIS PLACE. <br>
SOMETIMES YOU CAN GO INTO THIS AREA AND THERE IS NOTHING WRONG AT ALL BUT THEN, THERE ARE OTHER TIMES........?<br>
A WALK INTO THIS AREA IS JUST A WALK IN THE WOODS, NOTHING UNUSUAL,
TREES ARE THE SAME AS THEIR NEIGHBORS, SAME BRUSH. THE FIRST INKLING
YOU GET THAT THERE IS ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY IS WHEN ALL OF THE
FOREST NOISES STOP. IT IS LIKE YOU WALK INTO A VACUUM. THEN YOU GET THE
FEELING THAT SOMETHING (SOMEONE?) IS WATCHING YOU AND THE LONGER THAT
YOU REMAIN IN THIS AREA, THE WORSE IT GETS. EVENTUALLY ALL THE HAIR ON
THE BACK OF MY NECK STARTS TO STAND ON END AND ALL THAT YOU CAN THINK
ABOUT IS PUTTING SOME DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU AND THAT PLACE. I AM NOT THE
ONLY ONE THAT THIS PLACE EFFECTS LIKE THIS. ALL OF MY DEER HUNTING
FRIENDS GIVE THIS PLACE A WIDE BERTH. <br>
I HAVE TAKEN MY LARGE CALIBER RIFLE WITH ME AND GONE BACK IN THIS PLACE
LOOKING FOR WHATEVER IT IS THAT IS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM AND HAVE NEVER
FOUND ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY. PUZZLING.<br>
A HUNTING FRIEND OF MINE HAD A FRIEND VISITING HIM AND HE ASKED TO GO
HUNTING WITH US ONE DAY SO WE TOOK HIM. WE TOOK HIM UP TO WHERE A SKID
ROAD GOES STRAIGHT DOWN THE HILL AND JOINS ON TO ANOTHER LOGGING ROAD
AT THE BOTTOM. WE TOLD HIM" FOLLOW THIS ROAD STRAIGHT DOWN AND KEEP AT
THE BASE OF A RIDGE ON YOUR RIGHT AND WE WILL MEET YOU AT THE BOTTOM".
ABOUT HALF WAY TO THE BOTTOM, THERE IS A FAINT ROAD THAT TURNS TO THE
LEFT AND HEADS OVER INTO THIS AREA THAT I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.<br>
WE HAD NOT MENTIONED A WORD TO HIM ABOUT THIS WEIRD AREA AT ALL!<br>
WE WENT ON DOWN TO THE BOTTOM TO WAIT FOR HIM TO COME OUT BUT IT SEEMED
TO US THAT IT WAS TAKING AN AWFULLY LONG TIME TO GO A FAIRLY SHORT
DISTANCE. I GOT DOWN OFF OF MY STAND, WENT OVER TO MY FRIEND AND ASKED
HIM" YOU DON'T SUPPOSE THAT HE TOOK THAT FAINT ROAD TO THE LEFT AND
WENT INTO THAT AREA, DO YOU?", " I HOPE NOT, HE REPLIED."<br>
ABOUT A HALF HOUR LATER, WE FINALLY SAW HIS HUNTING COLORS COMING THRU
THE BRUSH SO WE WHISTLED TO LET HIM KNOW WHERE WE WERE AND HE STARTED
FOR US AT A DEAD RUN. " WHAT KIND OF A BLANKEDY BLANK AREA DID YOU SEND
ME INTO, HE HOLLERED AT US"? AFTER ASKING HIM WHAT HE MEANT, HE TOLD US
THAT IN ALL HIS YEARS OF HUNTING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, HE HAD NEVER
BEEN IN A PLACE THAT SCARED HIM MORE THAN THAT PLACE DID. TALKING TO
HIM WHEN HE CALMED DOWN A LITTLE, HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD, INDEED,
VEERED TO THE LEFT AND ENDED UP DOWN IN THE SPOOKY AREA. HE TOLD US
THAT IF HE LIVED TO BE A HUNDRED HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN GO HUNTING IN
THAT PATCH OF WOODS. WE HAD TOLD HIM NOTHING OF THIS AREA!<br>
THIS MAKES A TOTAL OF FIVE OF US WHO REFUSE TO GO INTO THAT AREA AGAIN
UNLESS WELL ARMED IN THE DAY TIME. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS THE PROBLEM
WITH THAT PLACE OTHER THAN IT HAS THE FEELING OF DEATH HANGING AROUND
IN IT AT CERTAIN TIMES. IT DOES NOT FEEL LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME BUT YOU
NEVER KNOW WHEN IT WILL BE LIKE THIS AND I, FOR ONE, AM, NOT IN A HURRY
TO FEEL LIKE THIS AGAIN.<br>

My Parents' House<br>
<br>
By: subservice@icnfull.com<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All my life growing up until age 18, I lived with my parents in a small,<br>
one-floor, two-bedroom house in a suburb of Trenton, NJ (in Pennsylvania).<br>
The house included one bathroom, living room, kitchen and laundry room.&nbsp; Oh<br>
yes, an attic and the entrance were located in my bedroom. It was one of<br>
those ladders that dropped out of the ceiling. Although it was rather spooky<br>
at times, nothing really scared me in the attic itself. The back of the<br>
house was always cooler then the front due to the shade. My room was in the<br>
back, next to the bathroom. Since I can recall, there were many times I was<br>
woken up in the middle of the night by someone tapping on my shoulder<br>
lightly and whispering my name. No one was ever there. We had many cats<br>
throughout my childhood. More than one occasion, I would hear a loud bang,<br>
like something fell on the washer or dryer. I would assume it was the cats<br>
until I saw that they were in the room with me scared to death to leave it.<br>
I would bravely walk out into the laundry room to find nothing, nothing on<br>
or near the machines to have made that loud noise. Still other nights I<br>
would wake up to a noise outside the front door. I was small and the window<br>
on the door was very high, so I could never see what it was. It was so loud<br>
and only became louder as I would cower behind the wooden shield. I know now<br>
that it could have been a car, but why was I the only one who ever woke up<br>
the these strange happenings? My parents never heard a thing. When I was a<br>
teenager, I notice things started disappearing and reappearing again. This<br>
happened to my parents as well. It was odd things like cookware and cans of<br>
food. Some things just disappeared all together, never to be seen again. I<br>
thought we had a homeless person in the attic eating our food. That is when<br>
my mother started seeing a man sitting on the couch whenever she was up late<br>
at night by herself in the kitchen. She would catch glimpses of him and a<br>
dog. She was never scared. I was never really scared either. After I moved<br>
out and in to my own place, I had a couple experiences but that is another<br>
story. The most recent activities in my parents' house are pretty weird.<br>
Just two weeks ago, I was over for dinner and we were in the kitchen.<br>
Earlier I had been sitting on the couch and everything was normal. After<br>
dinner, I walked over to the couch and sitting on one of the cushions was a<br>
wolf figurine I had given to my mother for Christmas. I asked my mother what<br>
it was doing there and she was perplexed. She was even more mystified when<br>
she realized that wolf was originally sitting in the middle of several other<br>
figures in the closed cabinet. There was no way the cat could have gotten it<br>
out. Then last week, my mother was boiling water to boil eggs. It was a full<br>
pot of water with 4 eggs in it. She set the timer for 10 minutes and went<br>
into the bedroom to sit down. Not 5 minutes later, she heard 4 loud popping<br>
noises. She went to see what was wrong and the water in the pot was gone and<br>
the eggs had exploded. The water didn't spill and it could not have boiled<br>
done that quickly. I guess the ghost didn't want boiled eggs. Things still<br>
disappear and never return. My father thinks he is going crazy but mom knows<br>
what is going on.<br>

My Hamster<br>
<br>
By: elizabeth.roe@btinternet.com<br>
<br>
My experience isnt very spooky compared to your other stories, but my
hamster has died, and because we have got a new one, things are
starting to get freaky.<br>
One night, i couldnt sleep, and my first hamster had been in my room
more times than any one elses in my family, and all of a sudden, i hear
digging sounds, from where she used to dig,(when she was alive) and i
think that because we have got a new one that has her cage, her food
and everything, she is angry.More strange evidence is thaat i took a
picture with my new camera phone, and when i looked at it, there was on
orb, I was so then i just dropped my phone and screamed.<br>

Not Scared<br>

<br>
My name is Danitza&nbsp; unusual name I know.&nbsp; I would like to share some of my ghostly experiences with everyone<br>
I&#8217;ll start off with my home in Harlingen Texas.&nbsp; Now keep in mind
that my house was built recently (give or take 5 years) and we are the
only family that has lived in it. Strange things have happened there
that don&#8217;t really make much sense.&nbsp; One after noon, my mom and
little brother were in the living room watch televi on.&nbsp; My little
brother went to play on the computer which was on the other side of the
room.&nbsp; The light from the window was causing a glare on the
computer screen, so my mom got up and adjusted the blinds (these blinds
are perpendicular to the window sill).&nbsp; My mom sat back down on
the couch and continued viewing her program when something hit the
blinds with anger.&nbsp; My little brother got up like a bottle rocket
and ran to my mom.&nbsp; Still can&#8217;t figure out what had caused it to
do that.<br>
On another occasion, my mother thought she heard someone open the front
door.&nbsp; It was around three a.m.&nbsp;&nbsp; As she was leaving her
room, she thought she saw my silhouette running to my room.&nbsp; She
yelled after me asking me where I have been all night and when I didn&#8217;t
answer, she went into my room.&nbsp; She burst in yelling and I woke up
feeling drowsy.&nbsp; She felt my face and I was warm, like I had been
sleeping for a while, and then she started to panic thinking someone
had gotten into the house and was hiding in my room.&nbsp; We never
found anyone (By the way, I was sleeping)<br>
The next two experiences are the scariest for me.&nbsp; I was reading
late one night in my room when I heard knocking on the wall.&nbsp;
Since my room is adjacent to my little brothers room, I thought it was
him poking fun because he couldn&#8217;t get to sleep (he hadn&#8217;t been
sleeping well for a while).&nbsp; I playfully knocked back.&nbsp; A few
minutes went by and the knocking continued.&nbsp; I was getting fed up
fast and pounded the wall and yelled for him to settle down and go to
sleep.&nbsp; The knocking got harder and I was furious.&nbsp; I yelled
out that if he didn&#8217;t stop knocking on the wall he was going to be in
for it!&nbsp; Still the knocking continued.&nbsp; I had had enough and
as I was leaving my room, I saw my sisters door open from across the
hall, I was my little brother with a drowsy look on his face asking why
I was yelling at him.&nbsp; There was no way in the world I was going
to go into his room and yell at a ghost.&nbsp; <br>
This next experience I still have nightmare over.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know if
it was all in my head or if it was my nerves, ut here it goes.&nbsp; I
was getting ready for bed one night as usual and putting everything in
my room away.&nbsp; I turned off the light and started to feel around
for the edge of my bed.&nbsp; I found it and hopped in, for some reason
when in the dark, I always get the feeling that something is going to
pull my legs so I have gotten into the habit of jumping into bed.&nbsp;
As I was squirming to get comfortable, I suddenly felt like I was being
watched.&nbsp; I stayed still for a moment and then It felt like
something was climbing onto my bed.&nbsp; I clenched my eyes shut not
wanting to see anything that would traumatize me for the rest of my
life and I&nbsp; started praying for it to get off.&nbsp; Then I felt
it get off.&nbsp; The second time it happened, I as sitting in bed
studying for a pre-cal test.&nbsp; I had that uneasy feeling again and
I felt it get on.&nbsp; I was watching the edge of the bed closely but
I couldn&#8217;t see any noticeable change in the indentation on my
comforter, I then got the courage to say that I wasn&#8217;t scared of it and
for it to leave me alone.&nbsp; It hasn&#8217;t happened since, but I always
get that uneasy feeling every time I am getting ready for bed.&nbsp; <br>

House Built in the 60"s<br>
<br>
By: bellawest22@dodo.com.au<br>
<br>
When I was twelve my dad remarried and we moved to this two storey
house , which was probably built in the sixties. This house had a
miserable feel to it . I remember my dad telling me to go off to bed so
I got into bed and sat there for just a very short time and these
strange imp like devil like things were all around my walls , at least
fifty of them talking in&nbsp; gibberish all at the same time , they
were talking to me and their expressions changed constantly .I did as a
lot of people probably do and shut my eyes and open them again, also
pinch myself.It lasted a few minutes at least .I was scared but
strangely drawn to it a bit. That was sixteen years ago and I find
myself having nightmares about it and the house still . &lt;&lt;&lt; my
next similar experience was when i was seventeen and living with my
boyfriend.&nbsp; I saw sad desperate people on the ceiling injecting
themselves with drugs and i could feel their extreme sorrow. It went on
for about a few minutes .We found out from a neighbour that it was a
"heroin house" years before and my boyfriend and I were dumbfounded (
even though he didnt see it ).Apart from these experiences I have heard
my name being called crystal ,crystal clearly on occasions where there
wasn't another living sole in sight . I wander if similar things
happened to others. <br>

Castle of Goodhope, Cape Town<br>
<br>
By: jvaneck@ads24.co.za<br>
<br>
I've seen that you have the Castle of Goodhope in Cape Town, South Africa under your Haunted Places list. <br>
You also mentioned the "Dark Hole" or rather "Die Gat". I was very
young, maybe 9 or 10 years old, when I and other classmates visited the
castle. This was about in 1987. As you know, the castle is a museum
now, open to the public. We were about 15 children that day visiting
the castle that day, with our teacher of course and a tour guide. I can
still remember the huge old halls that was rebuilt in those years for
restoration. Things like old wooden pillars, floors and ceilings were
replaced with the same type of wood that was used in 1666 when the
contraction of this great building was started, which also was finished
in 1674 by Jan van Riebeeck.<br>
The staff at the castle was dressed in the old style clothing of the
1600's, so if I saw a spirit there, I couldn't be sure if it was a
ghost or not. The halls and passageways in the castle was eerie and had
a unnerving feeling to it though. It was as if you were watched all the
time, but not threatening. Just plain weird!! We came to point where we
all had to enter "The Hole" at one stage. You had to enter through this
small door, then you climb down about 15 - 20 small steps. You will
then be in a small room, I can't remember how small exactly, but it was
so small that all of us barely fitted into this room. There was a light
bulb hanging in the middle of the room that was on of course. In the
middle of the room, just under the light bulb, was a wooden bunk. (Like
a wooden chair that you may find at cafeterias at tables) It was long,
about the length of a human being, maybe 6 feet. It was narrow though,
about 1 feet in width. This is were they tortured the prisoners, you
could even see the blood stains on the bunk because it was still the
original bunk. When you face the bunk when entering, there's a wall
just across from the bunk.<br>
You could see 1 or 2 holes that was made into the wall, it was said
that one of the prisoners there, wanted to escape. He dug these holes
with his bare hands and fingernails!! Needles to say, he did not make
it because these walls was really thick, not by inches but by feet.
When we were all in there, the door was closed behind us by the tour
guide and he told us that he was going to switch off the light bulb for
a few seconds and will switch is back on then. We were a nervous but
when he switched the light off, you couldn't even see you hand right in
front of your face. I remember I had my hand on my face touching it and
slowly took it away from my face trying to see it. There was nothing, I
couldn't even see an outline!! Right there and then I knew how the
prisoners of that time must have felt like. Truly horrific. I was also
said that when a prisoner was being "released" from this cell, he was
taken to the courtyard of the castle where everybody could have seen
them. The prisoner had a blindfold over his eyes and he was forced to
kneel. Then, they would do the unspeakable. They would remove the
blindfold from his eyes and force him to open his eyes and look
STRAIGHT into the sun. Within a few seconds, the prisoner was blinded
for the rest of his life.<br>
Sorry if this story of mine is a bit long, but I really want people out
there to visit the castle when the opportunity arise. I don't have any
ghost stories for now, but if you want to know a bit of the history and
hauntings of the castle (yes, it's VERY haunted) you can go to:

The Little Girl<br>
<br>
By: Gr6333@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Hi, my story takes me back to 1987, my sister her boyfriend and
children moved into an old green duplex in Northeast Minneapolis, i was
24 years old at the time, and still lived at my mothers house. To get
out of there i spent a lot of nites at my sisters house, there two
children were 5 and 6 years of age. On weekends we would stay up late
watching tv, and drinking beer, and just having a good time, on
occasions we would here a girl laughing, toys being played with, and
balls rolling across the floor. My sister and her now husband would get
up to investigate, and find that there kids were sound asleep in there
own rooms. This went off and on over the next few years. <br>
In 1989 they decided to move to a new home, not because of the disturbances, but because they needed a larger place to live. <br>
Me and my other sister and her boyfriend decided to move in there then,
i took the room in the back and they had the room in the front. We were
there for nearly 6 months and nothing out of the ordinary happened to
us. <br>
One nite while sleeping on a hot and humid&nbsp; august nite, i awoke
to a strange feeling running through my body, a chilly feeling if you
know what i mean. I managed to get back to sleep not knowing what to
think of what had occured. I awoke about two hours later, after having
a terrible dream about a girl dying, i opened up my eyes, and turned my
head, and standing next to my bed was this little girl smiling at me
dressed in a white gown. I screamed at the top of my lungs for my
sister, who came running in to see what was the matter, i told her what
had happened, and what i saw. <br>
We later found out that a young girl did die in that duplex, and that i
was sleeping in the room that she once had. We did move out later that
year, iam now 41 years old and will never forget that little girl.<br>

Whittier Junior High<br>
<br>
By: bonugli@sbcglobal.net<br>
<br>
My grandma used to work at Whittier Junior High as a teacher in San
Antonio, Texas. When I told her about this website, she shared her
scarry experiences that happened before they were reasigned buildings,
and tore the building down. She used to work late at school and the
nights were particularly scary for the ones working there. When you
walked alone in the auditorium or in the school hallways, you could
hear voices, and you always got a terrible feeling of discomfort. You
would immediately want to get out of there!&nbsp; One time, a woman
janitor ran out of the building shaking, screaming at the top of her
lungs, because she was walking alone through the halls, and in the very
middle of the hall, she saw a broom standing straight up on its tip,
NOT leaning against anything! That school was haunted...without a doubt
it was. After asking some questions about the school's past my grandma
came to find out, that a janitor had indeed fallen down the stairs
there behind the stage in the auditorium and died from the fall years
before. Fortunately, they were reassigned buildings, but they will
never forget the scarry experiences there.&nbsp; <br>

She Was Awesome<br>
<br>
By: rmorales14@elp.rr.com<br>
<br>
okay, so I have to wash my face everynight right? well one night when I
was washing my face in the bathroom, I left the door open, because it
doesn't really make any difference to me closed or open. well finally
after like 20 minutes of scrubbing, I put the soap and rag away, and I
was humming this cool song by korn called shoots and ladders, and as I
turned off the light saw a girls face right there in from of me, it
looked solid though, it wasn't transparent or anything, it was just
right there in front of me. I don't remeber seeing a body, but I don't
think I ever checked for one either lol, well I screamed like there was
no tomorrow, and my sisters room was just a little further down the
hall, and she came running out and was like, "Trish! are u okay?" and I
couldn't say anything, I mean obviously I like to talk a lot, but I
couldn't say anything, I was out of breath because that face just
freak'd the crap out of me, and the chick had disappeared bye then, I
guess she was frightened, but I have to say I was a little happy that
she had left so soon. let me think of a face of a ghost I can relate it
to... the girl in the movie gothika, how she looked solid, and her hair
looked damp and blonde, that is what the face looked like to me, accept
not angry, she seem kinda observant, but those few seconds I saw her
before I screamed seemed like they lasted for ever, I observed so many
things, and now I can't get her image out of my head. there is another
where I think the same ghost was trying to get along with me, because
for the next few I days I still had the song shoots and ladders stuck
in my head, so I would always be humming it. well every night I have
this routine, I watch TV go to sleep then my dad comes and turns off
the TV, well this particular night when my dad turned off the TV, I was
only half asleep, and I just decided to let him turn it off since I
would be asleep soon enough. I was wrong about that dudes, I was just
laying there for, I'm guessing, a few minutes and then I felt something
cold touch my arm. I was scared I just sat there for like another ten
seconds, with a bunch of bad idea's, and explanations for them running
through my head, and then I sat up in my bed, and right next to my ear,
I could feel cold, not breath exactly, but air, and I heard a girls
voice whispering the tune to shoots and ladders by korn. I have to say
it did make me smile because I felt like she was just trying to be my
friend, she had obviously learned the tune and wanted me to know. she
hasn't come in contact with me in anyway for a few months now, but at
least I know she's pretty friendly now.<br>

My Hauntings<br>
<br>
By: lttlsxmomma18@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Hello. I live on a country road in East Tennessee, you might say, I
live in the sticks, literally. I have lived here for most of my life,
spare a year or so after i turned 18. Anyways, My parents bought this
house about a month before i was born. I have a sister that is 5 years
older than me. When we were really young my mom says she was getting
ready to go to work early (around 4 am) one morning when she got up
from the kitchen table to fix herself a cup of coffee when she heard
the chair she was just sitting in scoot back up to the table. She
turned and looked and saw the chair moving but nothing was pushing it.
So she left the house right then totally freaked out, and didn't tell a
soul thinking my dad would think she was crazy and thinking she would
scare her two small daughters. Later while we were still young, she
says she could be sitting in our den late when all was quiet and would
hear something going through the kitchen which sounded like a mason jar
tapping against the tile all the way across the floor, the times she
actually saw the girl she only could see here with the corner of her
eye but she says that the little girl is dressed like little house on
the prarie with the pettycoat and bonnet and all with long dark hair
couldn't be more than 3 or 4 years old. She always stands with her arms
up like a child would when they want to be picked up. My mom says
everytime she sees her she thinks her name must be Emily, cause that is
what comes to her mind. As we got older and started staying up later so
the house wasn't as quiet she came around less often. My parents
divorced and my dad moved out and my mothers mom moved in. She was very
ill. My sister was going to college and was home for the weekend when
she went to the kitchen to get a glass of milk when she turned around
there was Emily with her arms up, looking as real as you or me, not
transparent but sort of glowing, like an aura around her. With this
sweet smi on her face, needless to say my sis freaked and shattered the
milk glass all over the tile floor which awakened all of us. Of course
i was told to go back to bed. My sis and mom were talking about it and
my mother had said nothing of it up till now for fear of scaring us. So
they both knew that they couldn't just be imagining this little girl. I
have never personally seen her but i have felt her presence in my
mothers house. I have a 3 year old little boy now and he goes to my
mothers often since we live on her property about 200 yards from her.
We were all sitting down there one evening watching the tv when my son
came through the house and into the den and says that we need to help
the little girl. I asked him what girl and he said Natalie (Maybe he
meant Emily) He said that she has a rope around her neck and can't get
it off. now i know my son wouldn't just say that out of his
imagination, because he doesn't watch programs that would put that in
his head. Strickly preschool shows. So we asked him to show us and he
took us into his toy room and said she wasn't there anymore, but still
to this day he still plays with Natalie and you can hear them playing
in there like two laughing children having fun.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Another incident here at my house. I live in a trailer on
my moms property as i said before and the night i had finally settled
in here I had gone to take a shower from all the cleaning in the house
i had done. I looked at the clock on the stove as i went by and there
are cabinets galore above it and beside it and under the sink at a
right angle next to it. I got in the shower and for some strange reason
i felt like i was being watched. When i got out i went to look at the
clock again to see how long i was in there and all of my cabinets were
open. All of them. I called my mom and told her to come and look and
all she could say was that it was my granny coming to see if i had food
in my house and that she had had encounters with my granny also. Who
died in 99. Every year on my mothers birthday my granny would call her
at a minute or two after midnight (when she was born) and tell her
happy birthday. A couple of years after my granny died I was out in the
woodshop with my mother making christmas ornaments on my the night
before my moms birthday when my mother asked if i just touched her back
and i said no i was in front of her. a few minutes passed and she asked
me again with the same answer. She looked at the clock as did i and it
was a little after midnight (which made it her b day). My granny was
telling her happy birthday as always. My mother has had a lot of
encounters that i plan on recalling to you in the near future. All is
true i know as my mother would never lie about anything, she never has.
Also about Emily (Natalie) when i was about 10 or so my parents added a
garage to the house, which they found out that there was a flat rock
that the houses foundation itself is built on that takes up quite a bit
of space it is perfectly flat like it was the foundation to a former
house maybe from long ago. Anyone who may know why Emily is here or
what she wants please email me at the above address. Thank you.<br>

Green House<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I was an only child for most of my childhood. When my brother was born
8 years after I was, we had to move because our current house didn't
have enough room. We rented a small green house with 3 bedrooms to live
in until my house was built. My parents gave me the master bedroom
because the carpet was my favorite color, red. They figured that since
we wouldn't be there long , that I could have it.&nbsp; The strange
occurrences started in my bedroom. My closet door would never stay
closed. My father changed the locks repeatedly and it never stayed
closed beyond a crack. My room was always freezing. The coldness got so
bad that I would sleep in my parents bedroom every night. On Christmas
Day, I received a puppy. I had waited forever for a puppy so I was so
excited. I decided to sleep in my bedroom that night so my new puppy
could sleep with me. In the middle of the night I was awaken by my
puppy, who was barking at something. As soon as I woke up I called his
name and he ran to me and hid under the covers. I looked around my room
and I noticed that once again it was freezing cold and saw a Shadow
"float" from the corner of my room to my closet.&nbsp; This scared me
to death, so I ran to my parents room. They thought I was dreaming,
because I was known to sleep walk. They let me sleep with them the
remainder of the night.<br>
I also remember laying in my parent's bed on some occasions with my mom
and my baby brother. I always could hear people whispering, and I asked
her all the time if she could hear them and she said no. We moved out
to live in our new house, but I still couldn't stop thinking about our
old house. So, I asked my mom if she never really saw or heard
anything. She then told me that she had seen an old women standing over
her bed on some nights and she would ask her what she wanted and she
would just turn and walk out of the bedroom.&nbsp; My mom never told me
this because she knew how freaked out I had been and didn't want me to
worry any more about the house. We later found out that an old woman
had lived in our house long before we had moved in and had died in "my"
closet of a heart attack. The old women was not found until about a
week later...<br>

Ghost Story <br>
<br>
By: meshele_morris@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Three years ago, soon after being reunited with my cousin Jandi, she
had her first ghost experience (at least with me around.) This was the
beginning of a haunting from one of our great grandmothers, apparently
named "Sarah". As it was, Jandi was running to the back yard for
something, and came back pale faced. On the side of the house,
something had brushed against her, and when she looked to see what it
was, a vehicle with it's headlights going down the road revealed a
shadow of a figure of a human, light shining through where the eyes
should have been. The next day I beleive, my cousin got a clear view of
the spirit and told me what she looked like. Later that day, we once
again went to our great grandpa's house. Keeping what my cousin told me
in mind, I observed the old family photos, one of them matching the
description my cousin gave me. She told me that was her, and we asked
who it was. Her name was Sarah. Sarah remained with my cousin, and
Jandi was confused as to why she followed her. In a later experience
without me, she spent a weekend at another cousin's house. Either that
night or the next day, they found handprints on one of the kids, the
prints unmatched to anyone in the house. This was another ghost,
obviously an evil one. Now we understood why Sarah insisted staying
with my dear cousin. The dark ghost is gone, but thankfully Sarah
remains. I had my experience with Sarah last week when Jandi was sick
and slept on the couch, leaving me sleeping alone. As soon as the
lights went off, I knew she was there, and I became frightened, not
knowing if the dark ghost had returned or it was just Sarah on guard
duty. Eventually I slept, but awoke at six thirty to the same feeling.
The feeling went away when I approached Jandi. She was better and we
went back to her room and slept more. We all know of Sarah well now,
for the next day, I recall Jandi telling my uncle about it, and he
replied,"She worrying about the house ghost again?" Apparently, we all
have met her.<br>

Animal Ghosts<br>
<br>
By: ladypercy@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
I had a big grey cat who had to be put down when her kidneys failed. I was <br>
heartbroken and even missed work because I was so upset.<br>
It had been her habit to walk around on my bed at night, as I was going to <br>
sleep, and because she was a large cat, I could feel her when she did this.<br>
A couple of times after she died, she came to visit me. I did not see her <br>
but I sure did feel her, walking around the bed. I spoke to her the way I <br>
always did, called her sweet names, and sure enough, she settled down. Just <br>
as she always had.<br>

<br>
2 Instances<br>
<br>
By: shuffer@mac.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I live in Bredbury, in the United Kingdom. I have two instances of <br>
strange occurrences to send you, both of which, I suppose, could be <br>
explained in perfectly natural terms, but have always struck me as <br>
paranormal.<br>
The first happened when I was around eight or nine. My friends and I <br>
had erected a rope swing in the local woodland park at Tandle Hills in <br>
Oldham, Lancashire. We used to convene there most days in the early <br>
summer evenings. We did a lot of rope-swinging, but mainly just 'hung <br>
out'.<br>
One particular day (it must have been a Saturday as my father and I had <br>
just been to see Liverpool beat Manchester City at soccer) I set off <br>
for the park a little early as I had eaten a meal whilst out. I can <br>
remember that I felt very strange on that walk to the park; there <br>
seemed to be very few people around on what was usually a busy suburb <br>
and it was one of those hot orangey evenings that I now find quite <br>
evocative.<br>
When I reached the site of the rope swing, I was mildly surprised to <br>
find nobody there. I put this down to my early start and mounted the <br>
swing. As I idly dangled on the stick we had tied on the end to sit on <br>
and the minutes ticked by, I must now confess that I began to feel more <br>
and more uneasy. The swing was set in the classic position: the tree to <br>
which it was attached&nbsp; was on a slope with the pathway I had used on a <br>
ridge at the top. I was about half a mile into the wood with a deserted <br>
path visible about 100 yards away at the bottom of the slope and I <br>
literally could not hear a thing. The floor of the wood was perpetually <br>
covered in old leaves, the drifts of which were around a foot deep.<br>
What happened next, I can't explain satisfactorily. I was staring at <br>
the path at the bottom of the slope when I was grabbed very violently <br>
from behind at the waist. Then there was a distinct feeling of a person <br>
sliding down my legs as the rope swung with the force, then the sound <br>
of someone hitting the floor. I was turned round by this time and <br>
couldn't see anybody at the top of the slope. As I was spun around by <br>
the rope, I could then see that the area at the front of the swing was <br>
also deserted. I didn't feel scared for a while, as the whole event had <br>
lasted about one second and had felt quite natural, like a friend <br>
creeping up and putting the 'shits' up me. Then reality struck: there <br>
was no way anybody could have done this without me seeing their <br>
departure, or hearing the approach on dead leaves. I even wondered <br>
whether it had happened at all, but I was still swinging gently from <br>
the force of it. It actually took a while for me to pluck up the <br>
courage to let go of the rope, but once I did, by Christ I got home <br>
quick!<br>
Tandle Hill Country Park was originally a hunting lodge for&nbsp; a local <br>
Lancashire baron. The woodland area was planted to discourage meetings <br>
of disgruntled local serfs shortly before the Peterloo Massacre in the <br>
eighteenth century.<br>
The second event is much shorter in the telling. My friend Ian and I <br>
started a band in 1992 and spent a long time in my room that summer <br>
recording ourselves on a four-track reel-to-reel machine, and also <br>
dolby cassettes on a standard player.<br>
During one afternoon of recording, Ian and I were listening back over <br>
the tapes, when we both stopped what we were doing and immediately <br>
rewound the tape (dolby). We had both heard a voice (not either of <br>
ours) shouting loudly and aggressively, with the sound of a door <br>
slamming hard in the background. When we played it, it came again. It <br>
appeared to be shouting 'I'VE NOT GOT IT!' followed by the slamming <br>
door. When we cross-checked the same recording on the four-track, there <br>
was no shout, but a very high-pitched whistling when the door slammed. <br>
Needless to say, we were both a little freaked out and there was much <br>
nervous chuckling, as there was no question of any such sound being <br>
made live.<br>
I suppose I may still have the original recordings somewhere at my <br>
parents' house, but since seeing a trailer for the film 'White Noise' I <br>
have been thinking about the impossible task of verifying the genuine <br>
nature of the recordings. I remember there being a sarcastic reaction <br>
from friends when Ian and I told them of the event and have since <br>
realised that there is no way to prove whether our tale is true or not. <br>
It could simply have been a faulty dolby tape, but then why the <br>
whistling on the four- track?<br>
Hope you find these interesting.<br>

The Intruder<br>
<br>
By: sunflower_jones@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I was living in my friend s house this summer while he was in the
process of moving, in a nice old one-story house that had a bedroom
addition in the back.&nbsp; The house had five doors leading outside
(the front door, the living room door, the study door, the kitchen
door, and the door to the addition), and if you closed the middle door
between the living room and kitchen, it formed two pseudo-apartments
with a bathroom for each. My friend worked nights, so nearly all the
windows were covered with something to block out the light. <br>
I slept in the addition at first, but every night, I found myself
feeling as though I were being watched.&nbsp; I heard noises like
footsteps in the grass outside, but could see nothing outside. I called
my dad to come over the first night I heard them since he was only a
couple blocks away, but he didn t see or hear anything. We discovered
the closet there led to an opening into the attic and the closet door
didn't close, so I moved to my friend s old bedroom in the middle of
the house.&nbsp; <br>
His room connected to the living room and the study, the only room
without electricity.&nbsp; I slept only slightly better there, until
one night I woke to footsteps in the kitchen, and, immediately awake,
locked the door that connected me to the house just to be safe.&nbsp; I
was determined not to bother my dad again, but then I heard distinct
footsteps right outside my bedroom door and saw a flashlight shining
under the door.&nbsp; Terrified, I set my alarm to go off to frighten
away the intruder and called my dad. A co-worker answered the phone
instead and said my dad was busy, so I told him about the flashlight.
He told me to call the police and he d send dad right away.&nbsp; <br>
By the time I got off the phone with the police, the flashlight and the
footsteps were gone.&nbsp; Then there was a loud knock on the front
door.&nbsp; I didn t want the police to break down my friend s door, so
I toughened up and fled to the front door.&nbsp; It was my dad, and
neither of us saw anyone else around.&nbsp; When the police got there,
I told them all the doors were locked, which they verified.&nbsp; All
the windows were locked and dusty, and there were no footprints in the
mud surrounding the house.&nbsp; My dad tried to explain it away, but
even he couldn t explain how a flashlight shone under my door with the
windows blacked out in that whole section.<br>
The footsteps didn t stop, and I found I couldn t sleep in the
house.&nbsp; My boyfriend and I blocked every door with something heavy
or noisy, like a bookcase or a huge pile of pans, and I slept on the
floor in the middle of the house.&nbsp; I would wake up every hour or
so to check each door, and couldn t stand to go near the study for some
reason.<br>
The more I tried to catch the footsteps, the worse I slept, and the
house started to get infested with bugs, constantly.&nbsp; My boyfriend
and I set off a bug bomb every other week, and I started sleeping every
weekend at his place about an hour away.&nbsp; When we moved most of
the furniture to my friend s new place, it only seemed to make it
worse, though it all stopped when he was there. I figured they couldn t
resist his charm anymore than the living could, and they missed
him.&nbsp; Or they'd just gotten used to him in the eight years he'd
lived there and didn't appreciate the intruder he'd left in their home.<br>
Finally I just moved into the front half of the house and shut the
kitchen/living room door.&nbsp; I promised whatever spirits that I
would stay in my half if they would stay in theirs.&nbsp; I wouldn t go
through the door at night then except very rarely to get food from the
kitchen, and even then I would promise to leave quickly and apologize
for disturbing them.&nbsp; When I hosted parties, they were given their
private rooms.&nbsp; They didn t seem to mind as long as I gave them a
space. Then I could sleep again, though I still couldn t stand to be
near the study, day or night.&nbsp; Although it was in my half, I
wouldn t sleep in the bedroom it connected to unless my boyfriend was
there, and even then I slept right next to the other door.<br>
When I moved out, I told one of our friends I thought it was
haunted.&nbsp; She told me she knew, and my friend who lived there had
befriended the ghosts and given them names like the one at her
house.&nbsp; After the naming, he d never had any problems with
them.&nbsp; I never saw the ghosts, but there was no question to anyone
who d been there as to whether or not they were there.&nbsp; I m sure
they ll still be there to greet the next owners of the house too.<br>

Our Extra Resident<br>
<br>
By: Dcompton86@aol.com<br>
<br>
My family and I have just realized that there is a ghost living with us
- like an extra resident sharing our apartment.&nbsp; I had noticed
several weird happenings since we moved the the apartment in which me
and my parents currently live.&nbsp; We have lived here for almost a
year, but the ghost has only seemed to show up in the past couple of
months.&nbsp; I had noticed every since we moved in here, that if I am
in the kitchen alone, it feels like someone is watching me and is in
there with me though.&nbsp; <br>
A few months back, I was talking on the phone late at night and I
happened to look out my window and seen this weird face staring back in
at me.&nbsp; I didn't notice too much of it at that time since I
freaked out and closed the curtain quickly.&nbsp; I had seen a ghost
before - the story is on this site somewhere - but it didn't surprise
or scare me like this - it might be since I knew who the other ghost
was.&nbsp; The part I could remember was that it had a long scar on
it's face and had a mean face.<br>
The rest of the happenings have happened in the past week or so - the
date as I am submitting this is January 2, '05.&nbsp; I was walking out
my fiance one night and seen this figure run across the yard.&nbsp; It
appeared out of no where a few doors down, ran past our apartment -
ducking under a tree, a ran around the side of our apartment -
disappearing into thin air before it should have been out of
sight.&nbsp; The door to our kitchen - keep in mind - is at the back of
our apartment.<br>
Then one night my fiance and I was walking downstairs (again late at
night - we're late night birds) and smelled the scent of really strong
coffee.&nbsp; I heard a sound that was just like someone stirring a cup
of coffee - like one does after putting cream or sugar into it.&nbsp;
We looked through the living room and kitchen - the only two rooms
downstairs - and didn't find anyone or a pot of coffee.&nbsp; The doors
were locked also, so no one could have left the house without us
knowing it.<br>
The next night my fiance was over again visiting, and while I was
walking him out, I heard some noises coming from the kitchen.&nbsp; I
didn't look in there, but Chris (my fiance) did.&nbsp; The description
of the ghost is in the following paragraph.&nbsp; He didn't tell me he
seen it that night, but I did notice he looked scared.&nbsp; He wound
up walking me in there to investigate so I wouldn't be looking around
alone.&nbsp; I had to go in there to do dishes or something - and he
feared me being alone.<br>
He says he saw a greyish figure sitting in one of the kitchen chairs.
He said it was a man who was about six foot tall.&nbsp; The figure had
a week-old beard, really short to no hair, and a scar on his
face.&nbsp; There was something weird about his eyes - like the man
hadn't slept in a long time.&nbsp; He could make out that the figure
was also holding a mug of coffee in one hand.&nbsp; He said the figure
also stood up at one point and started walking around the kitchen.<br>
Another day, he was here again and me, him, both of my parents, my
sister and her husband, and her three kids were all sitting in the
living room.&nbsp; We were breaking some bad news gently to my
mother.&nbsp;&nbsp; Chris says he suddenly got this really strange
feeling like someone was standing in that hall by the kitchen though we
were all in the living room.&nbsp; He didn't brave up to look closely
and he never saw anyone, but the feeling was enough to know someone was
there.<br>
The latest - and kind of the freakiest event - just happened last
night.&nbsp; I had already went in my room to get online and my parents
went up to their room a few minutes later.&nbsp; My mother says she
seen this shadow walk up the stairs behind them - and after they went
in my room - the shadow continued to proceed down the hall to my
room.&nbsp; I guess the shadow - who I take it was the ghost - must
have vanished before he entered my room since I never saw him in here.<br>
Another strange feeling I can remember about our kitchen is the feeling
that both me and Chris get that something bad happened there.&nbsp; It
is like a feeling of claustrophobia and dread once we get down the
hallway right near the kitchen.&nbsp; He has read somewhere that people
with some disorders (like the epilepsy I have and the bipolar he has)
are more likely to sense and be sensed back by ghosts.&nbsp; I am
really starting to wonder if this is true.&nbsp; <br>
Anyway, the ghost so far has been friendly.&nbsp; He scared me the
night he appeared at my bedroom window, but he hasn't tried to bring on
harm to anyone.&nbsp; It is like he barely notices us and that we live
here too.&nbsp; I am more than willing to leave it like that for
now.&nbsp; I have heard of cases where ghosts try to hurt people and I
am happy for that.&nbsp; We have nicknamed the ghost "Mr. Kitchen
Ghost" since he hangs around our kitchen - and he has been called "Mr.
Ghost" for short sometimes.<br>

My House is Haunted by 6 Ghosts<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Lane8434@aol.com<br>
<br>
&nbsp;I live in a small Texas town, named boerne. I am 35 years old and
marreid. I have rwo children and two dogs. We moved into this house
back in 1993. Its a small, 3 bedroom 2 bath house way out in the
country. The house was said to be built back in the late 40's. 2 other
families had lived there before we moved in , and the first family had
lost a child, who died in the house in my daughter's bedroom. My
daughter has ran into our room in the middle of the night screaming, "
Theres a Baby in my room! Theres a Baby in my room!"<br>
Every time we run in there, only to find nothing. We started to call the baby ghost "Fred".<br>
Thats ghost 1. Ghost 2, or ," The demon ghost" as we call it, haunts me
and my wifes walk in closet. We are awaken many times in the middle of
the night to banging and clashing and curse words being yelled comming
from the closet. One morning, after I woke up, i walked into the closet
and found one of the crusafics inverted that was hanging on the wall.
Ghost 3, or " the Old lady ghost" haunts my sons room. She is a very
kind spirit , who makes my son's bed on some ocasions, and turns his tv
off when hes supposed to be sleeping! Yes, it freaks him out, but we
like her. Sometimes we can hear him arguing with her over turning the
tv back on. Ghost 4, or the "Kitchen ghost", obviousley haunts the
kitchen. Pots and pans fly across the kitchen sometimes and plates
shatter. Ghost 5 , has been seen on many occasions in the backyard,
standing by a barbwire fence. We call her Molly. Sometimes she pics
flowers out of our garden. Ghost 6 , is Bo. Bo was my dog that i had
for 10 years. I have seen him walk into my room and when i run in there
hes gone. I hav also seen him sleeping on the couch and then disapear.
Well, those are all of my ghosts. Thank you for taking the time to
listen to my story.<br>

My Encounters<br>
<br>
By: kezi123@direcway.com<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1) I lived in Imogene, Minnesota. A little town with about 19 people. My family, (consi-<br>
sting of my Mother,adopted Dad(Russ), and step-brother(Tim)and me) lived in the oldest <br>
house which used to be an old train depot. It was a two story house w/ a basement.<br>
At the time of this encounter, I was about 10 years old and Tim was about 14. The story <br>
of the house was that the owner of the house had died on the couch, drunk. That he had <br>
placed the couch over a heating vent, and he layed down on it, and fell asleep. Eventually <br>
when the heat came in the house, the couch caught fire and torched the man alive. So once <br>
in a while when it was late, Tim and I would be watching t.v.. We both could hear the man<br>
calling to his wife, who had moved out of the house after he had died. "Marry lee, come<br>
here darling." We never saw him we could just here him. We knew he was there because there<br>
would be drawers open, faucets turned on, washing machine and dryers started without any <br>
clothes in them. After a while we got used to it, never really bothered us. Except once.<br>
The whole family was sitting in the living room talking, and the tv turned on. What was <br>
weird about it was that both remotes to the t.v., were sitting on top of the t.v.. Explain <br>
that. Because no one in my family could.<br>
2) Remember how I told you about my little un-populated town? well here another encounter <br>
with my haunted town. My family's house was on the corner of the main street (Railroad st. <br>
and Peach st.) There was a little white house on the corner of Peach and Cherry st. In that<br>
house, there lived a elderly man, Earl. My mother and I had just recently moved in with my <br>
adopted Dad and Step-brother, when he dad of an un-known reason. But, he had died in his <br>
house. Well,years went by, Tim and I hadn't thought about it until Earl came back to visit his house.<br>
It was summer time, when Tim and I wear walking down the street to our friend Jason's. <br>
(Jason lived at the end of Cherry street) We were rounding the corner when I noticed some-<br>
one moving around in the house. Because if you look at the house, it is really rundown.<br>
The ceiling is caved in all the windows nocked out, you get the point. So it was pretty easy<br>
to see into the house. I told Tim about who I saw. He admitted to have seen Earl too. So<br>
the day after, we went over to Earls old house. Nothing looked like it had been moved, or<br>
out of place. So we went home. Once in a while before I moved to Wisconsin with my Mother, <br>
away from Russ and Tim, Tim and I would wake past the house and see him there. We just fig-<br>
ured that he felt more comfortable there. So he lived there alive and dead. Kinda creepy.<br>
Thanks for listening let me know what you all think.<br>

This is My Story<br>
<br>
By: einar214@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Hi, I would like to start by saying that I am glad that I am not the
only one who has had these strange encounters with the unknown. I
started to talk to people who have made an efford of undertanding these
things. All of them had not heard of my kind of experience, wich made
me doubt that it was real. But your stories have convinced me that it
was real <br>
Most people say that I am to young to know about anything of this sort
since I am only 20 years old. My first was when I was about 12 years of
age. I fell asleep on the sofa watching TV. My parents were having
dinner with some friends and my oldest brother was babysitting me and
my 2 other brothers. I lived in a house that had 2 floors. My brothers
were downstairs playing and they didnt hear me when I screamed. My
house was not that big so it&acute;s not possible that they
couldn&acute;t have heard me. I woke after having slept for maybe 30
minutes at the sound of someone sitting down next to me on the sofa. My
heart jumped and I screamed my lungs out at what I saw. There was a
girl sitting next to me, she looked pale and almost transparent. She
had a look of a person who wanted to cry. She reached out and grabbed
my arm. Her touch was as cold as ice. I panicked and ran down the
stairs still screaming. My brothers asked me what was wrong and I told
them. Ofcourse they didnt believe me. I mean who would if a 12 year old
came running screaming and said that he had just seen a ghost. <br>
I didn&acute;t see her again after that. But that hasn&acute;t been my
only encounter with these sort of things. But I am only gonna give you
one other story. <br>
This happend when I was 18 years old. I was still living in that house.
By then I had felt and seen many strange and scary things in there. My
parent didn&acute;t believe me and only my youngest brother had felt
the spirits in my home. This one happend when I was coming home from
work. I worked at a gas station at the time that was open 24/7. It was
about 2 am and everybody except me were asleep. I came in and went
straight to my room. Being the nightperson that I am I was usually up
until the earlymornings and slept most of the day. I sat in my room
reading when I heard a noise coming from the corridor outside my
bedroom. I thought somebody was awake and decided to say hi since I
hadn&acute;t seen anyone since this morning. It had just turned 3 am.
When I opend the door I heard a women shout "Leave me alone" and then a
door slam. I didnt pay much attention to it since my parent were having
problems at the time. I then started for the kitchen and heard that
someone was opening and closing the closets in there. That I was used
to since it happend almost everynight. But I decided to go in there
anyway since it always stopped when somebody came in. As I came in I
heard a women crying, I stopped dead in my tracks. I heard shuffling of
feet behind me and turned. I saw a man looking straight at me, he
looked like he was saying something but there was no sound. Then he
started to move toward me but he vanished before he came into
armsreach. <br>
One final word. Playing with something you dont understand or think is
harmless concerning the spirit world is always very dangerous. Not all
the stories are true, but some are. I have it as a personal rule not to
meddle with things that can be the cause for harm like oujia boards.
They are very dangerous! If you make the connection to the spirit world
and you dont know how to close it you could unleash something that is
not of this world and was not supose to be in it. Most spirits will
leave you alone and not bother or even let you see them, but there are
some who have the intent of causing harm. <br>
For the host of this site. I give my person to let others view this and
that includes posting it on your website. Feel free to check my
spelling since I am not from an english speaking country.&nbsp; <br>
I would like to keep my name away from this. For personal reasons =) <br>
Could it be possible to send me an email if you decide to use this story<br>

Occurances at Walla Halla in Columbus, Ohio<br>
<br>
By: akatheman82584@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
Hi,&nbsp;&nbsp; Me and a couple of friends went to walla halla
tonight.&nbsp; We actually went back 3 times because we were not sure
of what we saw.&nbsp; Every time we were there, we experienced
different super natural events.&nbsp; The first time there was one
candle light on in the house.&nbsp; The second time we went back there
we saw a light flickering in a window which soon went out.&nbsp; The
third time we went by there was a figure staring at us.&nbsp; The
figure never moved but gave off an earie feeling and kept staring at us
with never moving.&nbsp; We got scared as hell and quickly left.&nbsp;
When we returned home, we were looking up the sightings at walla halla
and we heard music comming from the speakers on my tv which was turned
off.&nbsp; There was a womans voice comming through the speakers saying
"I'm comming to get you" and then laughter.&nbsp; This went on for
about 3 minutes and then it stopped.&nbsp; I don't know if that means
anything to you but that was some experience.....Also as documented the
car sped up.&nbsp; We were not fortunate enough to stay till midnight
to see if there was anything else going on.&nbsp; But tomorrow night we
are going back around midnight to see if any of these unexp ined
occurances can be explained.&nbsp; If you would like to know more about
this situation, we would be happy to tell you more in detail.&nbsp;
Also the gas pedal of the car kinda seemed to have a mind of it's own
because while we were outside of the house, we had the car in neutral
and the engine excellerated without anyone touching the gas pedal and
we seemed to pick up speed even thought we were in neutral.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thanks for listening and for any additional information please e-mail
us back at akatheman82584@yahoo.com<br>

Mysterious Toilet Flushings at The Stanley Hotel<br>
<br>
By: Scline707@cs.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In September 2004 I stayed at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, CO for
my best friend's wedding.&nbsp; There is a bathroom with black and
white tile directly below the grand staircase and it is accessible by
another staircase leading straight down to the lower level.&nbsp; I
walked in to use the ladies room and noticed that I was the only one in
there.&nbsp; During the time I was fussing to get off my pantyhose and
adjust my bridesmaid dress so I could use the toilet, I felt as though
I was being watched and not alone.&nbsp; I brushed off the feeling and
contributed it to my over-active imagination because I had heard
stories about this famous hotel.&nbsp; Just as I was finishing up and
about to reach down and flush the toilet, all the toilets in the
bathroom flushed simultaneously (excluding mine), startling me.&nbsp; I
burst out of the stall to look around because I didn't hear anyone come
in while I was in the stall.&nbsp; Sure enough no one had come in and I
was still alone.&nbsp; Spooked, I checked all the toilets to see if
maybe the automatic sensors had malfunctioned, knowing that the toilet
I used didn't have an automatic sensor, and sure enough none of the
other toilets had automatic sensors.&nbsp; As I stood in the middle of
the empty bathroom trying to solve the mystery of the flushing toilets,
that feeling of not being alone increased.&nbsp; Something was in there
with me that I couldn't see and it felt like it was moving in on me,
getting closer fast. At that point I decided to high tail it out of
there not bothering to wash my hands or to finish flushing my
toilet.&nbsp; Later on I decided to ask at the front desk if they had
ever heard of anyone commenting on mysterious toilet flushings in that
bathroom.&nbsp; The guy behind the desk gave me a strange look and said
no.&nbsp; By the expression on his face it seemed he had more to say
but changed his mind and didn't.&nbsp; Other than that, my stay at the
Stanley hotel was without anymore supernatural incidents.&nbsp; It's a
beautiful hotel and I recommend it to all.<br>

My Interesting Story<br>
<br>
<br>
By: hazelduncan@austarnet.com.au<br>
<br>
let me start by saying, i am only young well 16 to be exact. but please
dont let that discourage you. like many other cases i beleive the
paranormal have "followed" my family for generations. when i was 10 i
moved to a house in the country. thats when it all started. at first it
was just little things like putting stuff down in one place and it
turnes up down the other end of the house five minuets later. then it
moved to slightly larger things like the television would mute itself,
or turn up really really loud or turn so quiet it may as well be muted.
then once again it got worse. when i was about 12 years of age 9i had
spent the night talking to my mother about my grandfather (her dad)
that i barely new, he had died when i was 8. after having a long
conversation about the man that raised her i went to bed. in my room my
bed is puished up against a solid besser brick wall, i was dozing of
slowly when i was startled by the feeling of 2 hands apon my shoulders.
the feeling wasnt scary it was warm like some one was just letting me
no that they where there. i never told any one about that due to the
fact they had never really spoken to me about any other occurences.
nothing seemed to happen for a long time then when i was about 14 it
started again but this time it was different. one night i had just
finished in the shower when i heared my naem being called. thinking it
was my mother i replied&nbsp; "what". there was no answer i finished in
the bathroom and went out to see what mum wanted me for she said i
never called you. and my farther was away on a hunting trip at the time
and my mum is a typicall female and her favorite telivisoin programm
was on and nothing could budge her from that chair not even an axe
weilding maniac so it couldnt have been her. the thing was about the
voice was it wasnt mean or scary sounding at was angelic and sweet.
from then on many things just like that carried on. some times i would
be at the computer while at home by myself and i woyuld her my naem in
the same sweet voice and then the computer would shut down ther screen
would just go blank. for about a year things like tis happened then one
day the thing that i think proves im not insane, my now ex boyfriend
heared the sweet voice calling me and he asked if it was my mother and
i repleid no because she had gone to town to get the groceries. hre
asked wot it was and i said i didnt no and that it had been hapening
for a while we just left it at that. about 6 months later i was at home
with my mum and she wanted to watch her program, she said to me could i
please wake her up when it came on i told her that i would. me being
hoplessly unreliable when it comes to staying awake fell asleep. wheni
awoke my mum was awake watching her program and i apologised fro not
waking her and she said it didnt matter because she had woken up just
as it started by some one wispering her name in her ear. after about a
month i then encured a messy break up with my boy friend. about a month
later i had a new boy friend thats when it got really strange one night
he was stayin at my house he had fallen asleep in my bed so i slept in
the spare room. during the middle of the night he had awoken to go to
the bathroom when he returned to my bed room he loaid down in my bed
and was startled by ther sound of a man growling in the bottom of their
throat he thought nothing of it until it happened a few seconds later
and again a few seconds after that. hes 18 and he hid under the
blankets and was to afraid to look out in case it got him. he woke up
in the morning and asked both my parents and myself if they had tried
to scare him in the night they both repleid no and i sllep like a log
and unless i was dreaming i dont think it was me. since then nothing
much has happened the occasional voice and things going missing but
nothing to dramatic. i have now learnet to live with the ghost that
live with me because ino that that they arent bad spirits becaus eof
the good feeling they give me when they are around. as for my boyfriend
being grolwled at i have put it down to a fried of the family that
commited suiced when i was young and according to my parents i was the
apple of his eye he treated my like his own so thank you so much for
taking the time to read my story and put up with my dodgy spelling.<br>

I'm not quite sure I really believe in all the ghost stories most
people tell, but this one, while some could be attributed to being self
created is quite odd and I assure you the physical parts of the story
are completely true.&nbsp; My family owned a video rental store and
after a few years we moved to expand.&nbsp; We began to occupy two
normal slots in a strip mall.&nbsp; We tore down the wall separating
the main parts of both units but left the wall in the back room in
tact.&nbsp; It really all started because my sister and I, both in our
late teens/early twenties refused to go into the back of the second
space because we always felt really uncomfortable.&nbsp; It was nothing
we could explain, just creepy.&nbsp; Overtime we began to notice that
customers routinely complained about the corner in the front room right
by the place my sis and I refused to go.&nbsp; Most of the time they
just told us it was really cold, but a few definately seemed to be
uneasy.&nbsp; One saturday night the store was quite busy and my sister
and I were working up at the front counter.&nbsp; After a rush one of
our normal customers came up to us and just out of the blue told us
"What is here won't hurt you."&nbsp; We didn't really think too much of
it at the time because she had always seemed a little off, but it was a
little odd all the same.&nbsp; Over the next week some odd things kept
happening.&nbsp; I was closing the store and counting the drawer up
front when I heard about ten clicking noises coming from the back
corner that was always cold.&nbsp; I figured it was just the building
settling or what not, but when I walked back to close up the store I
noticed that on the top shelf of one of the stands every movie box was
now face down on the shelf. Again, I sort of figured it was just some
customer being careless.&nbsp; I set the boxes back up (They were
angled about 30 degress backwards) went into the back room, turned off
the lights and when I was making my way to the door I heard the noise
again and sure enough the movie boxes were all back down.&nbsp; I
hightailed it home and didn't bother picking up the boxes.&nbsp; After
a few days my father mentioned to me that each time I closed he was
noticing that corner was always messed up so I told him what had
happened.&nbsp; he didn't really believe me at first but my sister
began confirming that the same had also happened to her multiple times.
Intrigued he began to start asking the customer that had told us "it
won't hurt you" some questions.&nbsp; He arranged for them to come in a
few weeks later after hours to investigate with some friends that like
this sort of thing.&nbsp; In the mean time I had a friend come from out
of town and once he heard of the "haunting" he wanted to check it out
first hand.&nbsp; When we arrived the movies on the same shelf, once
again, were all face down.&nbsp; We started talking about the
possiblilty of having a ghost and then all of a sudden a sign that was
suspending from the ceiling began to turn very rapidly.&nbsp; it was
quite heavy and no air flow had started so this freaked us all out a
little.&nbsp; It was turning really fast and then begun to start the
other way to unwind the string it was suspended by.&nbsp; Nothing too
out of the ordinary until it came to a dead stop once the string had
un-wound.&nbsp; Something that heavy spinning that fast would have
enough momentum to start winding the string the opposite direction a
few times, but it just stopped quite abrubtly.&nbsp; When the "ghost
hunters" came in they said there was definately a presence whose name
was Michael whose family owned the land previously.&nbsp; Apparently
the one unit that had issues was by an old well that Michael fell into
and died.&nbsp; I'm not really sure I believe that but that's the
explaination we got.&nbsp; All I know is that I hated closing the store
and almost everytime I would find the same videos knocked over on the
same shelf.<br>

As I was reading your story my eyes started to water because it was so
familiar to me. When I was younger I lived in a 2 family home, on the
bottom floor. It was an old home, not sure what year but it had a maid
pantry with a hole to the top floor to shimmy food up to the floor
above it.&nbsp; I shared a room with my sister who was only 5 months
old. I don't remember when it started, but one night, a felt something
was behind me while I was lying in bed. Then I felt tapping on my
shoulder, then a giggle and some words I couldn't understand followed.
I wouldn't look directly at it because I was too scared. But out of the
corner of my eye I saw that it almost looked like one of those troll
dolls, but life like. It was wearing a purple cape (that's the only way
I can explain it anyway) and it seemed to be about 2 feet tall with a
large head. But it would come almost every night, unless I made my
little sister sleep in the bed with me. There were some nights I would
try to stay up so that it wouldn't come, and as I would watch the
digital clocks' numbers change they would start going faster and faster
until it was actually morning. A few times while my mom was walking
upstairs from the kitchen (which was located in the cellar) a man would
appear directly next to her in the window. She would drop anything that
she was holding and run upstairs and call the police. I knew it wasn't
a real person, because my brother who was only 3 kept saying clown and
pointing to the window. The cops came and never found any evidence of
anything outside the window. No footprints or anything. There would be
writing on the mirrow backwards in lipstick, clothes ripped out of the
drawers. Everyone except me thought that it was a burglar or some
neighborhood kids pulling pranks. because no one ll believe me when I
tell them about the thing that used to come to me at night. Ironically,
a couple of months after these things were happening, our house caught
fire 2 days before christmas and we lost everything. We&nbsp;
eventually moved back into the house but I never saw anything ever
again. And I never fully told this story until now, because no one
would ever believe it. <br>
Thanks for reading.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

The Basement<br>
<br>
By: papaou@sbcglobal.net<br>
<br>
A friend of the family had purchased a home in one of the earliest
additions of Oklahoma City(okc)&nbsp; A very large two story affair
with a large basement which had at one time&nbsp; a coal heating unit
for heating the house.&nbsp; My work was generally on the first floor
but at times I had to go into the basement.&nbsp; While walking down
the steps I began to get an uneasy feeling and felt compelled to peer
around before fully going into the room.&nbsp; Once down the uneasiness
became sheer fear which centered around where the furnace had
been.&nbsp; I got out of there as fast as I could.&nbsp; From then on
an evil presence made itself known at the top of the steps but did not
enter the house proper.&nbsp; My Father began having the same feelings
as I.&nbsp; From then on we worked in the basement together.&nbsp; We
could still feel the presence but not as strong.&nbsp; One evening my
Dad brought his dog a full grown husky with him.&nbsp; Thor would not
enter the house.&nbsp; He went up on the porch and that was it.&nbsp;
Needless to say we were happy to finish and have never returned to the
place.&nbsp; That was near thirty years ago.&nbsp; Never had that
feeling before or since.&nbsp; I even worked on another house in the
neighborhood with no problem.<br>

In 1973 I lived with my parents in a nice house in a residential area.
One day for some reason I was taking a nap in my brothers room to this
day I don't no why. I had my own room. I was in a sound sleep and all
of a sudden I felt someone breathing on me I opened my eyes and saw a
man's face right in my face not one inch away staring at me all of a
sudden my Mother opened the door the same time I was getting ready to
scream. I said didn't you see that man she looked at me funny and
closed the door. I wasn't tried anymore and I went to my bedroom and
listen to music, pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon. I had a door in my
room that went into the backyard all my friends came to that door to
see me. My girlfriend came over and I told her what just happened and
she said right some man was in your brothers room. I said Yes it was so
weird and that was that, I didn't speak of it again. Until years later
My Mother told me a story of on her wedding night some man was at the
foot of her bed staring at her. I asked her if he looked like W. C.
Fields she said kinda he had on a top hat and tails. I said the man
that came to me had on a top hat and tails. My older sister was sitting
on the coach and said WAIT A DARN MINUTE, I've seen that same man on my
wedding night too. He had on a top hat and tails and his cheeks were
Rosy. I said Yes. I asked my Mother who could it be? She thought for a
moment and said I think its my Grandfather he's been dead for over
50years now and now that I think of it, it might be him watching us. My
brother has never said a word about seeing this man and one day his
daughter came to me and said Aunt Carolyn I had a terrible nightmare
last night, this old man was in my room staring at me. I said did he
have a top hat and tails on she said YES YES he did. This isn't a scary
story its a story of someone who fallows are family and watches over us
the weird thing is he only watch's us girls. I'm sure every family has
someone that watches over them and our man is in fact a family member.
In life he was a great Judge and Lawyer in Ohio his best friend was
Clarence Darrow a great lawyer himself and a man to be reckon with. I
was doing some research on Great Grand Dad and found an old photo of
him and sure enough it's him. My other niece has seen him too so now
he's been to all the female members of the family with a watchful eye,
my younger sister got killed in 1985 on a motorcycle very sad story and
she saw him too. I just wish he would have spoken to any of us if I see
him again I'll let you know I've only seen him once we all have only
seen him once in our life's. I wonder what he wanted us to know! It's
strange that one man could make his rounds to all of us. He just wanted
to let us know he's here and watching....and waiting<br>

Unsure<br>

I have had more than one experience in more than one place. As a child
I would see things at the house we lived in and in my great
grandmothers house. Starting with my great grandmothers house it
consisted of eight rooms and a built in back porch that had a door that
led to a very creepy cellar, my great grandmother always told the story
of mr and mrs miiligan visiting often( those were the previous owners
who had died) she had a picture of these people but it was nothing we
ever thought twice about or did we believe the story, in the attic a
story was told of someone falling and splitting open their head on the
attic floor and the blood had soaked into the wood floor I guess the
people tried to clean the wood floor but it was hopeless so they just
replaced the boards that were covered, when the boards were replaced
the next day the floor was checked on by the people and when they
opened the door and flipped on the light the floor where the original
stain was had came back onto the new floor and the reason I believe
this is I have been in that attic several times and I seen the stain.
If you looked at the stain you can see it is blood that has stained it.
At the top of the stairs to your right is the attic door, to your left
is one bedroom<br>
And straight ahead is another bedroom if you turn left in this bedroom
theres another bedroom straight off of that one,when I was about 3 or 4
I was sleeping in the room straight at the top of the stairs along with
my grandmother and my sister my parents were sleeping in the room off
of that room, my bed was facing the door that led into my parents room,
I woke up in the middle of the night and was scared by it being dark so
I started to cry my mother came out to check on me turned on the light
and comforted me and then returned to her room I saw her close her door
as I layed there trying to get comfortable I remember looking back
towards their bedroom door I saw a black out line of a women standing
in the door way I thought it was my mother checking on me so I called
out to her but received no answer as I called agin still no
answer(which would have been very unlike my mother not to answer) I
started to cry and then scream I woke the whole house when my parents
came into the room I heard my mom open the door I told them what I saw
and no-one believed me but my great grandmother and my father. For
years my fathers side of the family has seen things that would curl a
straight haired persons hair .<br>
My great uncle would see things they said was so ugly it
frightened&nbsp; my other uncle who had seen it one night along with him<br>
My dad was&nbsp; 16 and crawled in bed with his mom and dad because
where they lived he would see things that frightened him but never like
the one that grabbed him from under his bed he refused to sleep in that
room for awhile. This house that we lived in you had to walk through my
parents room to get to mine there was nights that I would wake up and
things would be standing by my door looking in at me I would be so
frightened I couldn't scream or cry or even speak after it was gone I
would scream till my parents would come get me my mom always told me I
was dreaming but my dad knew, now my oldest son and my youngest son see
things to where my middle son has never had any experiences, my oldest
says when he would be at school in the lunch line at his elementary
school he would see kids he could see through, my youngest son when we
bought our first house was only 2 when he turned 3 he would wake up and
ask me to ask the man to stop talking to him he said the man would
stand by his closet door needless to say he slept with us for along
time when he did return to his room he would cry and said the man was
beside his bed as he and I were talking, I switched our rooms hoping it
wouldn&#8217;t bother him anymore he woke up one evening needing to go to the
bathroom ( I should say our bedrooms were in a finished basement)<br>
So I took him upstairs to the bathroom got&nbsp; him a drink and
returned to his room I got him tucked in and just layed down myself
when he let out a shreak that woke eveyone we ran to him and he was
white as a sheet and was breathing so fast we had to take him out of
the room before he would calm down when we finally got what happen out
of him it frightened me I wouldn&#8217;t let any of my boys sleep in that
room for a while, after I tucked him in&nbsp; he says he looked over to
where the extension cord was plugged in he says his brothers coat flew
into the room from behind the basement stairs and was pulling on the
extension card and then turned and laughed at him and it had no face it
was just black I locked myself in the basement after that and told what
ever was there "you can stay I don&#8217;t care but leave my boys alone they
are just children and your frightening them after I told my dad what
happened he done the same thing but never told me until I had told him
what I had done he had no other incidents after that but my dog would
stand at the top of our steps that led to the basement and turn his
head like he was looking at something then just jump like someone or
something would startle him he had to be carried into the basement
refused to go down on his own and would put up a fight while my husband
was carring him sometimes you just don&#8217;t know why some people
experience these things while others don&#8217;t.<br>
