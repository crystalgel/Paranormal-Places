<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I'm writing this in reference to
an entry under the Haunted places index. If you click the links, then go to <st1:State><st1:place>Louisiana</st1:place></st1:State>,
scroll down to <st1:City><st1:place>Lake Charles</st1:place></st1:City>, Old
dirt Road there's mention of shadows on the road side watching you as you drive
past. I have seen these presences on a few different occasions, and it's not
limited to <st1:Street><st1:address>Lake Charles LA.</st1:address></st1:Street>
The times I have seen them were on LA28 between Leesville (Where I live, about
an hour and twenty minutes north of <st1:City><st1:place>Lake Charles</st1:place></st1:City>)
and <st1:Street><st1:address>Alexandria LA.</st1:address></st1:Street> The
first time I saw one, or it,(I'm not sure the three or so I've seen are
different from each other) My wife and I were returning home from a day of
shopping in Alexandria. It was around 9 or <st1:time minute="0" hour="22">10 pm</st1:time>
and we were about half way home. My wife was driving that night, and I was
sitting in the passenger seat we'd been talking about some of our purchases,
there came a point when there was a lull in the conversation. I recall there being
very little traffic that night, and I was just looking out the window, and I
saw what appeared to be a person standing on the side of the road. Not walking,
just standing there. As we came closer, it got darker; the shape became more
and more shadow like. It seemed to be turning to face us, as we passed it. It
had no features, only the shape of a man, and a very large man. My wife and I
had just looked at each other. "What was that?" she'd asked, knowing
I have a background in the occult, to which I'd replied that I had no idea what
it was. Suffice it to say that we were both pretty shaken, my wife couldn't
sleep well, and I had continued nightmares for a week.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The second sighting was on our
way back from <st1:place><st1:City>Jasper</st1:City> <st1:State>TX</st1:State></st1:place>,
which is about a 45 minute drive from where I live. We'd just crossed the
bridge that is the state line between LA and TX on LA 8 it was around <st1:time minute="0" hour="23">11pm</st1:time> or so, and there was no traffic, I was
driving, and my wife was dozing in the passenger seat. I slowed to make a shape
left bend in the road, and as I came out of the turn, there it was, in the
middle of the road, in full view of my high beams. Just a large 5-6 foot tall
shadow, no features, and the closer I got the darker it seemed to get. It was a
shadow, but darker than any shadow I have ever seen, it was black, coal black,
I kept slowing down, and it just sort of glided off to the side of the road,
where it turned as I drove past it. I feel as though it was facing me as I came
into view of it, and kept watching me as I passed it. Again it bothered me, but
was far less frightening that the first time; again I had vivid and recurring
nightmares for the following week.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The last time I saw one was on my
way to <st1:place><st1:City>Shreveport</st1:City> <st1:State>LA</st1:State></st1:place>,
I was on LA 117 on my way out of town, it was about 430 or so in the morning.
Again my wife was asleep in the passenger seat; I was going down a hill, when I
hit something. I stopped and got out of my SUV, and walked to the back of the
truck, and saw an armadillo lying on the ground twitching. I opened the back
glass hatch and got out a flashlight so I could look under the truck to see if
there had been any damage. I got down, looked and found nothing wrong, just
some blood. I stood up put the flashlight away and felt something watching me.
I turned around and saw one. This was the first time I had seen one and had not
been in the vehicle. My blood turned to ice, as I was filled with fear. The
fear was fleeting though, as I am a sensitive, and didn't feel as though it
meant me any harm. It stood there, watching me, I assume and made no movement.
I backed away to the door of my truck, opened it and got in. By this time my
wife was awake, and asked if everything was alright. I told her what I'd seen
and she turned to look, and saw nothing. I looked in the rear view mirror and
it was gone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">These events happened over a
three year period, once each summer in 2000, 2003 and 2004. This summer isn't
here yet, but I have a feeling that this summer will be no different. I have no
idea what they are, but I can say that they don't seem to be dangerous. I'll
keep you posted if I see anymore. Just keep your eyes on the road, and the
shoulders of the road, and if you think it's a hitch-hiker, look again, because
it may not be.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Me and a few friends of mine have
been looking on the Internet for haunted places around where we live and have
come across a few places that seem to be a little to weird to be true. One
place that seemed to be unreal was the City underwater and the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Livermore</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Cemetery</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. So me and some of my
friends decided to go check this place out, to see if some of the stories we
true or if the stories we just made up to scare you. We planned to take a trip
up there last weekend (<st1:date year="2005" day="16" month="4">April 16,2005</st1:date>),
there was like 10 people that wanted to go, so we all headed up to this place
around <st1:time minute="30" hour="21">9:30pm</st1:time>. We had alittle
trouble trying to find this place because it is back in a wooded area and very
easy to miss the turn for it. Once we found the road that leads to this place
it was around <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>. One of the
stories from the website says that once you cross these train tracks your car
will be blocked in by a "Ghost Train" or your car will stall out an
wont start for an hour...well neither of those happened (thank god)!! So we
pulled up in front of the gates to enter this trail which is 3 miles long, and
it takes you to this underwater city, and we were all hyped and planned to walk
this 3 mile trail to get to this lake. Well, we all had gotten out of the car,
and this place was so scary looking, there was dead silence up there, i mean
like no crickets chirping, no wind, no sound at all, just dead silence!! We
were standing outside the car for maybe like 2 minutes, talking and such..and I
had heard a scream come from the woods,i thought i was hearing stuff but then
other people in our group asked me if i heard that scream, and i said yes and
said it sounded like a high pitched scream(like a girls scream), and there were
no other people up in those woods because there were no cars parked outside the
gate where we were and that is the only way u can get into this place! So we
were standing there for alittle longer and a car drove up behind us and we all
had jumped into our cars because we had thought it was a cop , but it wasnt it
was the owner of that property and he had told us "Do not go into those
woods!!" he didnt say why he just told us not to go up there. So we were
getting ready to leave and all of us were in the car except for the 2 drivers
or the 2 cars we had drove up in, they were talking about who knows what when
the driver of my car claims to had seen a large dark shadow fly through the
woods infront of him, and the driver of the other car had heard it! After
seeing that they both got into their cars and we drove out of there real fast!
The driver of my car told us what he had seen an i had asked him if maybe it
was an animal or something, and he told me "It moved too fast to be an
animal and was too big to be an animal!" he said that it was human size so
we have no clue what it was, i know that he wasnt making that up because when
he got into the car after it happened he looked like he was ready to cry. We
had only been up there for like 15 mins an had already heard an seen something,
everyone that was with us says that they would never go back to that place, but
i would like to go back and actually walk through the trail...thats if i can
find some brave people to go with me! Other friends of ours that have went up
there before have said they've seen some weird stuff an heard some weird
stuff,one friend of mine said that his sister had went up there before with a
group of friends and was chased out by "Cult members"(on one of the
websites it says that you will be chased out, but says nothing about any cults!)
which i find hard to believe but who knows, one thing i do know is that there's
definately something not right about that place and it is definately haunted. I
suggest that if you decide to go visit this place to take lots of flash lights
because it is pitch black back in them woods, and go with a group of people
because you will get very scared, because i know i sure was. Thanks for
listening to my story</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Hi I'm Levi<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and I think I came encountered with a ghost
once. About a year ago me my little brothers and my moms boyfriend were all out
riding around. well it was about <st1:time minute="45" hour="23">11:45p.m.</st1:time>
and my little brothers were asleep. Well as we were driving down the road and I
looked over and saw an old lady. She was very very scary looking. There were no
houses nearby and she was shrunk back into the shadows. She was looking at me
and I was very scared. and my moms boyfriend was saying "oh my god! Who is
that! he was laughing at me and I said "GO GO GOOOOOO!" he drove around
the corner and came back she was gone! all i could say was "how" and
I never saw her again. To this day i have never seen her. And sometimes I sit
up awake thinking about that strange creepy moment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I have 5 experiances with ghosts
in my life<span style="">&nbsp; </span>all of them taking place at
my middle school. My first expiance was when I was in 6th grade and about 12
years old. I was walking to lunch when my friend said lets take the
"haunted staircase" being an extreme skeptic a mde fun of him a
little but agred to go. We started to decend the staircase and every thing
apeared to be normal until I heard the disembodied vioce of a woman I was un
able to mke out the words but my friend and I ran down the staircase as fast as
we could and stoped halfway down the hallway to catch our breath. I asked my
friend if he heard the vioce and he said yes. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">About a month later I had my
second expierience it was in the school cafeteria this time, that day there was
a book fair in the cafeteria and there were books placed on and ontop of the
book shelf. I was one of the few browsing when a book on top of a bookshelf
with no one near it flew off and hit the ground. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">my thid experience ocured at the
same staircase as my first I was walking up the staircase alone when a heard a
loud bang it souned somewhat like a gunshot but I was sure that somebody else
defininity could have heard<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when I got
up the stairs and asked on of my friends who had a loker near the stairwell if
he heard the loud bang he replied no and I felt confused becuse I was sure he
if anybody could hear it considering the hallway was allmost silent at the
moment I was also frightened becuse learning that my friend did not hear it
made me feel like the ghost was picking on me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">This was my last experiance until
two years later when I was in 8th grade my fist expeience that year may<span style="">&nbsp; </span>or may not have been a ghost but it ocurred
in a classroom and the coset door opend by itself the reason I'm not sure on
this one is because my teacher had said earlier that year that the closet door
had a faulty hinge. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My final and most frightening
expience ocurred lter that year<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in a
classroom down he hallway from the one whre I had an experiance earlier that
year. In this classroom the desks where in rows and the teacher's desk was at
the front of the room. On the teacher's deck were a stack of papers a grade
book and a small decorational glass bird. At the time of this experiance my
class and I were busy doing work and my eacher walked to the back of the room
to call the office because a student had just been trown out of class I
lookedup from my paper and a shining object caught my eye and I relized the
glass bird statue had levitated of the besk for<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>a few seconds and then hit the ground very hard and shattered as if
it<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was thrown intensionally the
sound<span style="">&nbsp; </span>obviously startled my teacher and
the rest of the class. My teacher then asked if every one was alright and if we
knew how it happend no one knew exept me and<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I knew no one would believe me so I said nothing. The only person I
later told what happened was my friend that<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I mentioned in my first experiance. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Over the course of years these
events occured I tried to find out why my school was haunted and i found an
article in the school newspaper the article was about the constuction of the
school it<span style="">&nbsp; </span>mentioned that the school was
condstuced on a peice of land the formerly was the site of a hotel called the
Mandeville Inn. It mentioned that when the boulding was being covertred into a
school a construction worker had found a human corpse in one of the rooms. My
friend also asked a teacher if he had heard any thing about the building being
haunted and he aid he heard rumors about a hauntings and he sid the ghost was
ven nicknamed "The Mandeville Ghost"</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I am now a sophmore in high
school<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and I hve not had any xperiances
with the supernatural after my last experiance in eight grade but I am eager to
have more expierences in the future</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Many years ago I was a 19 yr old
girl driving alone down the street minding my own business. The street was one
of those that is about 1 1/2 lanes but has no lane markings. It's not unusual
for drivers to treat it like a two-lane road but it's really not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, I was on my way home from work when a
car behind me tried to pass me. I tried to let him &amp; his female passenger
pass but the traffic from the other direction was too heavy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were then stopped by a stoplight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked in my driver's side mirror and saw
the young driver walking up to my car obviously very angry. Before I could
react he was right at my open window drawing back his fist to punch me! The
next thing I saw didn't hit me until several days later. He stopped in
mid-punch and there was a very stunned look on his face. He didn't say a word.
He simply backed away from my car and retreated to his car. His female
passenger was yelling from inside their car for him to get in and drive
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being the cocky person I was then
I got out of my car and started yelling at him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He told me he didn't want any trouble and got back into his car. I'm
convinced I had a guardian angel appear in my passenger seat to scare off that
raging lunatic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><st1:City><st1:place>St Louis</st1:place></st1:City>,
Historic Soulard area south of downtown: 8th and Russell </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I lived in an apartment facing
the back of the Amoco station, 1st building on <st1:Street><st1:address>8th
  street north</st1:address></st1:Street> of Russell, on the first floor. My
dog, Max, used to wag his tail looking at the wall (all I could see) at a point
a foot or so above his head. Sometimes he'd give a friendly bark. Didn't bother
me. But one night, I was in bed sleeping and he started his low, warning growl
and the hair stood up on the back of his neck. From the light coming through
the window, I could see a dark shadow in the doorway&#8230;like a man in a suit with
a hat. It moved a little closer and Max went ballistic, standing at the end of
the bed between me and it and barking his head off. The shadow backed off and
moved<span style="">&nbsp; </span>out of sight. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I turned on the light, we (Max
and I), investigated&#8230;nothing. I slept with the light on that night. :-) </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Although the "friendly"
presence still came around occasionally, there were no more "dark"
presences that Max picked up.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I think I'm subconsciously
attracted to places that are haunted. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><st1:City><st1:place>Overland</st1:place></st1:City>,
MO: The house I currently live in, I used to hear silverware clink in the
kitchen drainer sometimes. I figured I had mice or something. I'd come from the
office (next room) to investigate but never could find the source. Then one
evening I heard a male voice, sounded like he was in his 20's or 30's. I
figured it was coming from someone outside on the street or something. I was
hearing one side of a conversation, not loud and I wasn't paying much attention
since I was working in my office. Then something made me realize I couldn't be
hearing someone on the street because it was winter and all the windows and
storm windows were shut and it wasn't like the guy was yelling. So I walked
from the office to the kitchen through the foyer and looked out the little
window in the door and there was no one on the street. I realized heard it
better when I was in the kitchen, so I looked out the kitchen window to see if
maybe someone was talking to a neighbor or something. I went out and walked
around the house, went back in and went into the basement then went upstairs.
When I came downstairs and headed back to the kitchen, it just stopped. It was
very strange. So, I shrugged it off and went back into the office. After a few
minutes I started hearing the silverware in the drainer clink. And it hit
me&#8230;some entity was messing with me. So, I said "Hey, you're freaking me
out a little. You're here and so am I. You want to hang around, fine, just stay
out of the bathroom and bedroom and respect my privacy and we'll be cool."
I think he respects the bathroom but there's been a couple times in the bedroom
that I've asked him to behave and go although a couple times I'm sure he's
there. Since I got cats he's not around that I can tell&#8230;except in the bedroom
every once in awhile. So I guess he's a bit of a voyeur.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The funny thing is I think he
hangs out at my neighbor's house sometimes. Once I told her I thought I had a
ghost and thought she'd think I was nuts. She's a 78 year old italian widow
that's sweet as pie, great sense of humor and has all her marbles. When I told
her that, she told me about some of the stuff she's had happened that could
ONLY be the work of a ghost and she was completely serious&#8230;she keeps bags of
candy in the basement in a cabinet and once in a while she'll open the cabinet
for something and there will be a wrapper neatly smoothed out with the (and the
foil if it's a Hershey's) laying on the shelf in front of the candy and the
candy is gone. The first time it happened she thought kids were breaking in
through her basement window so she had it removed and replaced with glass block
and threw out all her candy, which she picks up when it's on sale for
Halloween. Well, the next time she went downstairs, the bag was opened and
there was a neat wrapper laying on the shelf. She figured she must have a
ghost&#8230;said it scared her at first but since she couldn't find anything else but
a wrapper here and there to throw away, she didn't figure it was anything to
worry about. :-)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">When I was about 11 years old,
which would have been in the year 2000, I </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">was in the habit of playing
outside in a sloped clearing in the woods, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">where my neighbors had hung a
rope from which we could swing (we called </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">it the Tarzan Rope and it was a
lot of fun to swing on it then just drop </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">in a pile of dead leaves). It was
in october, I think, because it was a </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">bit cold and I was dropping on a
pile of freshly fallen leaves. From </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">where I was, there was woods to
my left and my right, but only a bit at </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">my back, where my neighbor's
houses were, in a line. In front of me, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">down the slope, there was more
woods and still visible, a lake.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I was playing alone in the
clearing, as I often did because I was a </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">loner, when I heard a faint
wailing in the wind. I attributed it to the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">baby who lived a few houses down,
but since it was a cold october day </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">(the windows would have been
closed) and there was a good deal of forest </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">between me and the house, I think
it might have been something </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">supernatural.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My experience, however, does not
stop there. When I climbed back up the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">slope to get another swing done,
I turned around to see a little boy </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">standing in the middle of the
clearing, right where the rope would be if </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">it just hung vertically (I don't
know why that struck me, but it did). I </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">remember he had pale blond hair,
a pale complexion, white cloth shoes, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">red shorts and a black t-shirt,
which I thought was really weird for a </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">boy his age; he looked about
five. I remember the details and the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">feeling I got to this day,
they're VERY vivid, except for his eyes, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">which I couldn't seem to focus
on. I felt kind of worried , but not for </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">me and sort of embarassed being
caught playing, because I was supposed </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">to be 'mature' (as if he was an
adult reprovingly watching me play, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">though he was only a child).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I asked him what his name was,
because I'd never seen him before and </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">there were no new kids in the
neighborhood. Also the forest was very </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">quiet and I could not see anyone
else. I asked him where his mommy was </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">in english, french, lithuanian
and italian, the only languages I knew.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The weirdest thing about him was
that he did not answer or move. I could </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">see him breathing, I remember
that, but otherwise, he didn't move at </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">all. Wondering if maybe he was
lost, I turned to look for his mother and </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">when I turned around, he was
gone. There was no way he could have left </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">the clearing without me noticing
it: the leaves would have made crunch </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">sounds and the clearing was quite
big. I went home feeling odd and a bit </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">disoriented, but said nothing.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">When I was fourteen, I talked to
a neighbor a year younger than me about </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">it and he gave me a weird look.
He said that when he was eleven, in the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">fall, he'd seen the same thing
when he was playing on the Tarzan Rope. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">He said also his older sister,
who was five years older, had seen it </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">when she was eleven.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I was also told that a little boy
by the name of Derek had died in the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">lake after drowning a good twenty
years ago and that his mother had </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">buried a lock of his hair in that
clearing and put a cross as a memorial </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">there, though that is long gone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My cousin just recently came from
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
about a month ago and told me so many stories. One that I thought was very much
disturbing was of the bathroom in the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Central</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName>Philippines</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.
He told me that theres this one bathroom, the girls bathroom, which his friend
experienced terrible headaches everytime after washing her face. It was a dorm
which she stayed in. So anyway after the third time it happened she decided to
ask the janitor if any others experienced the headaches she kept having. When
she asked the janitor told her not to be surprised if it keeps happening for at
that spot, the third sink and the only sink which works in the bathroom, is the
exact spot which a girl student hung herself and her two feet are the things
hitting her forehead while she washes her face, causing the headaches.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Hi My name is Joyce and I have
sent in stories before but this one is really scarey. I have an older sisiter
Char, who for as long as she can remember has had wierd and unexplainable
things happen to her. The family just got used to her stories and excepted the
fact that she had a sixth sence if you will. Well one year back in 1998 my
mother and I went in to visit my sisiter, We had a nice visit and were spending
the night because she lived very far. In the middle of the night I awoke
because I heard someone call my name. I was sleeping on the couch and everyone
eles was upstairs. When I woke up no one was there and I knew I didn' t dream
it. I felt uneasy so I decided to go upstairs and crawl in bed with my mom. The
staircase was only about 10 feet away but when I tried to walk or rather run to
the steps it was like I was moving in slow motion,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>like someone or thing was holding me back. I
could not get to the steps. When I finally did I flew up those stairs. I told
my sister I was never going to stay there again. I didn't tell her what happen
until a few months later. She finally confessed to me that she had the same
feelings only when she went to bed at night if she didn't pray for Jesus to
protect her with his light she would feel an evil presence hold her down on her
bed. Her husband would be sleeping right next to her and she would be screaming
and he wouldn't even hear her. But if she prayed she would be ok. Well she has
long since moved out of the house and lives in another state. She lived in <st1:State><st1:place>Maryland</st1:place></st1:State>
and now lives in <st1:State><st1:place>Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>.
But hear is where the Gremlin comes in or whatever it was. A long time ago my
sister Char<span style="">&nbsp; </span>has<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a dream with herself, and a neighbor and I.
She said she<span style="">&nbsp; </span>had a dream way befor all
this happened that<span style="">&nbsp; </span>she was running from
something and it got on her back and she was trying to hit it with a hammer and
banging on the door for us to let her in. Finally the thing took off. But all
of us that were in that dream had some kind of force that was holding us down
in that house.She lives in a new house and hasn't had anymore stuff happen.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I have had some experiences that
I can't explain.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">We lived in a house in a city in
Canada when my whole family was alive it was during that time my sister was hit
by a car walking home with her two friends and nine months later my brother
died in a car acccident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After their
passing I came home one evening my parents were away and I heard loud music
coming from the basement this was where my brother had his stereo equipment set
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought this was unusual and was
frightened and the moment i put my key in the lock to unlock the door the music
stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then hated going into the
house when no one was home so another evening I came home and nobody was home
so I waited in my car out side the house . I saw a white apparation looking out
at me through the window. When my parents came home I didn't say anything as
they were still greiving over the loss of their children. My dad was sitting in
his easy chair in the living room when he sat straight up as he felt somebody was
right behind him. I then told him about my experiences. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I also saw my sister right after
she died in her bedroom and she told me tell mom and dad not to grieve I am
happy where I am</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">By: angelsheart423@hotmail.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I have a ghost story to share with you. I was
pregnant. and we were building onto the front of our house. Well we lived on 20
wonderful wooded acres in <st1:place><st1:City>Atlanta</st1:City>, <st1:State>Tx</st1:State></st1:place>.
We had done some logging on the property and that is when everything begin to
happen. I was sitting home alone in our newly finished living room the tv was
off and everything was quiet. I had a bathrrom just off of my dining room..My 5
yr old daughter was off at school and my husband and father in law was at work.
I heard the plastic glass that I use to wash my daughter's hair with fall into
the bath tub...(by the way I had NO inside pets at the time). I knew what it
was...I went in there and sure enough the glass was in the bathtub. The hair on
the back of my neck stood on end and I had goose bumps everywhere. I immediatly
told WHATEVER it was that they could stay as long as they DID NOT harm my
family. Then I would have to kick some butt...(Laughing) I also told them if
they were going to play they had to clean up their mess. About an Hr or so
later, I went back to find the cup neatly placed back where it was on the
bathtub. Later that afternoon just before the bus dropped my daughter off from
school I heard a big commotion in the bathroom. I went in a my daughter's bath
toys which were usually stored under the bathroom sink were scattered all over
my bathroom....*UGH* I then told "it" as I named the
"Thing"to clean up the mess.about another Hr later I went back in and
it was all cleaned up. This is not all. One night while taking a bath I heard a
voice of a little girl screaming for her mother coming from the bathroom. She
was crying and panicky. Although I saw nothing the hair on the back of my neck
AGAIN stood on end and I had goosebumps...I've always been able to "Feel
things" but nothing like this it was wierd. Anyways after several days of
hearing such stuff I spoke out and said your Mommy went to Heaven with God and
Jesus and the screaming stopped and I never heard from her again. After my son
was born about <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00</st1:time> in the morning I
woke up and heard a voice saying goodbye<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>son I heard it come from over my son's bassinet. After that my son woke
up for a bottle and a diaper change. We had a side door that went from my
hallway to the outside but it was very hard for any of us to get open due to
thick carpeting in my hallway. When I went to get up I felt uneasy and
goosebumps were all over my arms and legs I went in the hallway to find the
door WIDE open. Needless to say I was very scared and uneasy. I went and
immediatly woke my husband up and told him of all the instances that has been
happening. He told me of things he has experienced. Now I don't know how true
this is but I have heard rumors of cattle drives and wagon trains and indian
burial grounds and wagon train attacks in my area. I don't know if the loggin
disturbed them or stirred them up but I do know that it all started after that.
It's been a wierd but exciting experience. Thank you for listening. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">when my father was 18 his
father(my grandfather) died of a heart attack; he smoked a lot, i never knew
him,my dad's sister was about 8 when he died,. anyways my dad and his other
sisters were at work and my aunt (who is the youngest) was a home w/ my
grandfather and she was watching tv, and he went back into his room, and she
noticed that he was coughing a lot but didn't think anything of it, then the
dog started barking frantically, and my aunt saw her father(my grandfather)
walk through the hall outside and the dog was following him, so when my grandma
got home my aunt was still watching tv and my grandma asked, "wheres
dad?" and my aunt replied "i saw him walk outside" and there was
no one outside so my grandma walks into the bedroom ands sees my granfather
lying their dead. so in other words my aunt saw the ghost of her dad right when
he died, and she saw the ghost walk out the door, we figure that the dog sensed
that it was a ghost and that's why the dog was following him. another insident
happened to my dad when he was in his twentys, well one night my dad got up in
the middle of the night to go get a drink of water and when my dad was walking
down the hallway he saw someone sitting in the chair, and realized it was the
ghost of his father. my dad's father's ghost actually spoke to him; he said,
"come here" and my dad wouldn't move(i guess he was to parinoyed) and
he asked again and my dad still wouldn't move and then the ghost said,
"this is the last time you're gonna see me" and he vanished. and till
this day my dad still hasnt seen the ghost of his father sice that incident. i
havent seen anything but sometimes its pretty eerie in the back<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of my grandma's house</p>

out slowly and carefully.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We could never

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Interesting short story:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My husband and I were in <st1:place><st1:City>Ottawa</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Ontario</st1:State></st1:place> (he lived there at the time) and I
wanted to walk around the Canal and maybe visit the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Bytown</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Museum</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, a small museum about the
early days of <st1:City><st1:place>Ottawa</st1:place></st1:City> and the
building of the canal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From a ghost tour
we had gone on earlier, it was rumored to be haunted By Lt. Col. By, an early
settler and officer for Britian.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So,
being a weekday, the Museum was pretty much deserted except for the two ladies
working the front desk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we had the
museum to ourselves (which isn't incredibly big... about the size of a 3 story
large haybarn made of stone.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, we
entered through a set of glass doors between the lobby and the museum
entrance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This led to a set of stairs...
and My husband started upt he stairs first, followed by myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About halfway up, there were three sets of
footsteps on the stairs. I stopped and there were two sets to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hair on the back of my neck stood up and
I scooted up the stairs closer to my husband, and said nothing. I searched the
rest of the museum for other people, and there were none but the ladies in the
lobby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We spent about an hour milling
around the exhibits and then left the building.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I figured that I was just hearing things, but when we got outside, my
husband asked me "So, what did you think of the extra footsteps?" I mentioned
that I had heard them too!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, thus marked
my FIRST ghostly encounter!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I lived in a Condo in <st1:place><st1:City>Rolling
  Meadows</st1:City>, <st1:State>Il</st1:State></st1:place> and I would always
hear someone coming up the stairs. I never saw anything but my Bedroom would
get cold and I could definately feel a presence there. I had a kitchen timer
that just dissappeared and I couldn't find it anywhere. I subletted the place
to my Sister in laws, brother and he called me up 2 weeks later to asked if I
had ever seen a ghost. The night before he was in bed when a dark, shadowy
figure approached him in his bed , yelled and spun around and was gone. When we
investigated the history we learned that a 24 year old man had commited suicide
in the dining room by shooting himself in the head and that explained the
Z-Brick that had been placed on the back wall. He also had set<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a kitchen timer and when it went off that was
when he shot himself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Hi, Im not going to use my real
name for protection, in this story.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">So, I'll call myself,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>christina, I've always loved that
name...haha.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Ok, so I was about 14. I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>had just moved in with my father and
stepmother, in a new bungalow. We were living a suburb of <st1:place><st1:City>Charlottetown</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Prince Edward Island</st1:State></st1:place>, in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Im sure you all know where that is(wink, wink)...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My stepmother had lost a baby a
few years before that, due to lung failure. I had often wondered about the
little baby, that was my brother. He had only a few short days he was able to
live. I wondered what it would be like to have him around.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">It was weird, because I didn't
have experiences before like the ones about to come.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">So, I'll explain a little about
the house. It was a basic one level house, but my father had redone the
basement, so it was now a recroom, at the bottom of ther stairs with my bedroom
at the end of basement and the laundry room next to me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My room had no windows, as I
liked the dark when I was trying to sleep. Well, I had this one best friend
we'll call <st1:place>tara</st1:place>. She often stayed over on weekends, or I
would stay at her house. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">One night, she was staying over,
and we were watching tv. I went to change the channel with the remote, and it
was gone. We didnt really think much about it, just looking under the couch and
around the area. Later on, I went upstairs, to go to the bathroom, and there on
the ledge of the sink, was the remote. Things like that started happening
often. Just small, suttle things. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Now, downstairs, in the rec room,
we had a big CD player. I would often listen to my music on it. I loved music,
so thats mostly what I would do, after school hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day, I was upstairs getting something to
eat, i the kitchen. Now, the basement door is in the kitchen, and I had my
music on. All of a sudden the music turned up, really loud. Like deafening
loud. I thought the speakers were going to blow, because we had those speakers
that stand on there own, you know. Im not sure what theyre called.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I ran downstairs and turned the
music down. The CD player had a remote that went with it, which I brought
upstairs with me, so it wasn't like it could maybe have fallen off the
furniture on a button, or something. I didn't know what to think. Things like
the remote for the tv going missing and the music turning upon its own started
happening more frequently.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">One night, I was aslepp in my
dark room. On eiother side of my bed I had a night table. On my left table, was
my alarm clock. It read, and I still remember the exact time, <st1:time minute="13" hour="2">2:13 AM</st1:time>. I don't know what woke me up, but all
of a sudden, I was wide awake. I looked at the clock, and the numbers
dissapeared for a moment, as if something had walked by the clock. They
literally dissapeared, one by one. But, it wasn't possible, because there was
no room for anyone to walk in between my bed and nighttable.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I closed my eyes, and pretended
to sleep, and for a while was scared to death by what i had felt. I guess,
eventually I had fell back asleep. I told my friend, <st1:place>Tara</st1:place>
about it. She believed me because of the things that had happened while she was
at my house. We used to laugh and theorize that it was my little brother,
acting the way a little oy would, to bother his big sister. But, somehow, I
don't think it was him. I hope not, I would rather not think he is in limbo,
somewhere. But, I don't know. My father and stepmother had bought the house for
him, so he would<span style="">&nbsp; </span>have a nice place to
grow up in. But, he never got to see his house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I hope you enjoyed my story. Any
theorys would be great.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I used to live at 996 N. Grotto
Street #8 in Saint Paul, MN... it is across from Calvary Cemetary. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">At night they would make lots of
noises in the kitchen, as if they were cooking. I would hear dishes moving
around, silverware in the drawer being moved around. I would see shadows on the
walls and reflections of shadows on the glass light cover on the ceiling. I
would also feel like somebody was watching me from the hallway if I slept with
my bedroom door open. My 5 year old son would also see and hear the same
things.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I was a smoker when I lived
there, and every time I flicked the lighter to light my cigarette, they would
blow out the flame. They didn't want me smoking. Once when my child was sick I
went into his room to put him to bed, and I said out loud "ok now,
everyone just keep it quiet so Michael can sleep now. he's not feeling very
well"...all of a sudden the television shut off. I asked my two year old
if he did it but he was standing next to me, so I know he didn't do it! My
heart started to pound very fast. I continued taking care of my son, tucking
him in, and then I said out loud again, speaking to the spirit " ok, we
can leave the tv on, we just have to keep noises down tonite. please.". I
checked the cord of the television and it was plugged in. The spirit had shut
the television off when I said we all had to be quiet.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">A neighbor of ours also had a
spirit in the apartment next door to us. They would see an old lady in their
apartment. I don't know any stories from there, but I have seen spirits in the
background of photos taken in that apartment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">First of all we don't live ther
anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My last night there was over 7
years ago and what happened to me was<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>just too freaky for me to go back.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I lived there for 3 years with my
children Marc, Nick, Lisa and My oldest daughter Shannon and her husband Bud,
three grandchildren Steven, Bobby and Destiny.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">When we first moved in nothing
was happening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasnt until we did
some remodeling that people started having or hearing strange things going on
in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was built around
the turn of the century and according to the owner nothing bad had happened
there. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">There was also another house on
the property that had been vacant for several years and was just used for
storage and it always gave me the willy's, like someone was watching me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The first time I heard of
anything strange going on it was my children who told me about it. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">They were all sitting downstairs
and the baby was upstairs sleeping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
had the baby moniter on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They all heard
a male voice call for Marc, and repeated it several times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course they were a little scared,but the
baby was upstair by herself, so all of them went up there together, and of
course found nothing but the baby sleeping quietly.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">On another time they were all
downstairs when all of sudden it sounded like world war two had broken out
upstair!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sounded like furniture was
being thrown around and heavy footsteps banging on the floor, it lasted for
several minutes and finally stopped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When they finally got brave enough to go upstairs nothing was disturbed.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">All of my children at different
times reported either seeing something or feeling something touching them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My oldest daughter was lying in bed
reading,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when she felt someone touching
her leg.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thinking it was her husband<span style="">&nbsp; </span>she continued to read. Suddenly she felt
someone grab her legs and the covers came flying off the bed!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She quickly pulled away and ran down stairs,
and once again it sounded like world war three had broken out upstairs!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course later when they all went up, there
was nothing out of place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This sort of
thing happened to her on several occassions.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My grandson, who was about two at
the time, would bolt upright and start rocking back and forth, repeatiing
"kill mom" over and over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
would also sit at the thresehold of the stairs, staring upstairs and would hold
conversations with someone none of us could see or hear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This all stopped when they moved out and he
of course doesn't remember a thing.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Several people over visiting were
pushed off the back porch by someone that nobody could see, but the person
being pushed deffinatly felt them!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
dog was absolutly terrified by something we couldn't see, but he would do just
about anything not to have to go back there at all.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">So many things happened at that
farm house I could go on forever, or have my children tell there own
experiences, but what happend to me was the straw that broke the camels back
and other than going back to get our stuff I would never stay in that house
again!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now what I am going to write<span style="">&nbsp; </span>is even hard for me to believe and I have had
many strange experiences since childhood, but this is almost too unbelievable
and I woudn't blame anyone if they thought I made it up, but this is what
happened to me,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I came home that night, my oldest
son Marc was the only one home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
visited for a bit then I went out to the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dog started acting strange, like he was
afraid and he was whinning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I came out
of the kitchen in time to see the front door closing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thinking Marc must have gone outside for some
reason I walked towards the door,just as Marc came from upstairs and he had
seen the same thing and thoughtr I had gone oustide, at that moment the back
door opened, the dog started barking, and then the back door slamed shut!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say we were pretty scared. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">We finally decided to go to bed
as I was leaving in the morning on a weekend trip with a friend of mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now remember it was only myself and my son in
the house that night. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I remember having what I thought
was a very realistic erotic dream, but it was no dream. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">When I awoke in the morning my
nightgown was shoved way up over my breasts and my panty's were on the
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of the covers were off the
bed<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and without going into detail, there
was evidence of sexual activity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
figure the ghost or whatever who had been after my oldest daughter for months
had finally gotten what he was after.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">When I returned I told my family
what had happened and that I wasn't staying there anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The kids stayed for about another month and
couldn't handle it anymore either.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Whatever or reveler it was
getting much too active and obviously too aggressive!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The house I believe is still
there, and has new owners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't think
they live in it thought and I don't know if<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>anything more has happened, like I said I won't go back!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">One calm spring day me a nd a
friend of mine were going to a cemetary that was called the witches grave up in
west berne ny but there was a snow pile that blocked the road<span style="">&nbsp; </span>so we parked the car and started to go
towards the cemetary now remember it was a calm day </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">as we got closer the wind started
to pick up and as we got closer it picked up some so we went through the mini
cemetary and left as we got closer to the car the winds had died down </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">That freaked us out. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Then One night me and a friend
and 2 girls went up to the same cemetary it was past midnight<span style="">&nbsp; </span>so we had to shine the lights on the cemetary
as we got out we saw a hooded </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">person dressed in black sitting
on the worlocks headstone<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my friend got
scared and started yelling at me to get into the car but i froze up in
amazement on what i saw there is times i think about that night oh my it still
gives me chills</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">San Francisco Hauntings</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">By: mdkinney@usfca.edu </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I have always believed in ghosts,
but had never come into contact with </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">one until I moved to San
Francsico for college. These are a few of my </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">experiences.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My freshman year, I lived in a
high-rise dorm system. My roommate and </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I had bunk beds, and I slept on
the top bunk. I had about 3 feet </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">between my head and the ceiling.
Every few nights, I would hear </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">footsteps right above my head,
like a toddler running back and forth. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The footsteps were so rapid that
they couldn&#8217;t have been a person </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">taller than 4 feet, and this was
a college dorm. I asked the girls who </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">lived above me if they ran around
their room at 4 in the morning, and </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I was met with strange looks.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The next experience was during my
sophomore year. The building I was </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">living in, Lone Mountain, was
built on at least 3 of the city&#8217;s oldest </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">graveyards. Supposedly, they
moved all the bodies before construction, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">but may have missed some. The
night before Halloween, my friends </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Chelsea, Charles, and I went into
the building&#8217;s more remote </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">corridors, looking for ghosts.
There is an oddly placed mirror in the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">building that is supposedly
covering an old staircase. Legend has it </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">that a nun got pregnant and threw
herself down the stairs, trying to </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">kill the baby or herself. That
night, Charles and I pressed our ears </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">up against the mirror, and also
tried to look through it. We had our </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">ears up against it for a minute
when we heard a tap. We each thought </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">that the other had hit it, but
Chelsea saw that neither of us had. We </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">were still skeptical, but the
next time we were watching each others </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">hands, and the tap came again. We
were pretty freaked out. I had had </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">enough, but Charles wanted more.
The next time he put his ear up, he </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">took off like a bat out of hell.
He said he could hear someone </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">inhaling, but it sounded like
&#8220;they were sucking the life out of me&#8221;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The real meat of my ghostly
experiences happened when I moved into </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Chelsea&#8217;s apartment this past
January. They had told me that there was </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">a ghost, nothing more than
knocking on the door late at night, so I </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">was aware. The first night I got
there, however, we experienced more </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">than that. Only one of the
roommates, Meaghan, was home. The two of us </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">were sitting on the front stoop,
smoking cigarettes, when she started </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">telling me about the ghost, and
how it had been doing more things </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">lately, like opening the washer
and dryer doors, etc. from the point </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">when she started telling me about
this, the door, which was right </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">behind us, started shaking as if
someone was rattling it (not an </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">earthquake). From that point on,
more and more things happened in the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">3 months I stayed there. Once, I
took a girl home to show here around, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">when all the roommates were out.
When we got inside, all the doorknobs </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">for the inside doors were
missing, and the doors were closed tight. We </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">found them scattered all over the
apartment. My mP3 player was hooked </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">up to my computer speakers in the
living room, and once I was watching </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">a movie, and I thought I saw
Chelsea turn it on and leave the room. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">This was all in the back of my
mind, however, and I realized that </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Chelsea had been in the kitchen
for at least 15 minutes. Since then, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">my mP3 player has turned on by
itself many times. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">One time Meaghan and the third
roommate, Caitlin, were sitting in the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">kitchen and the CD player turned
on. After a minute, it turned off </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">again. Caitlin decided to
confront the ghost, and said &#8220;If you&#8217;re </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">really here, you can do that
again.&#8221; Sure enough, it turned on again. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The ghost has also wound up the
music box in Meaghan&#8217;s room, opened </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">windows, and moved things around
the house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The scariest experience, however,
was one night the week before I left </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">for Japan. Chelsea and I were the
only ones awake. We were sitting in </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">the living room when we heard
someone fiddling with the mail slot. We </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">went to check it out, and of
course there was nobody outside. When we </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">went back to the living room,
there was a thud on the window. Once </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">again, there was nobody on the
street outside. This was pretty </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">commonplace by this point. A
minute or so later, I went to the kitchen </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">to get a snack. When I walked
back, Chelsea told me that her mirror </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">moved forward. This got us to
talking about the ghost. We came to the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">conclusion that the events had gotten
worse when the landlords started </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">to redo the foundation underneath
us, which consisted of a lot of </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">noisy construction. I then said
&#8220;Maybe she&#8217;s buried underneath the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">house&#8221; when I said this, the room
went dead cold. Then, I stepped out </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">into the hallway, and said out
loud &#8220;Ghost, if you&#8217;re buried under the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">house, give us a sign.&#8221; The word
sign hadn&#8217;t escaped my lips when we </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">heard a woman laughing, really
loudly. This was one of the most evil </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">laughs I&#8217;d ever heard. It sounded
like it started at the end of the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">hallway, but ended two inches
from our face. We both bolted. There are </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">ten steps that lead up to the
apartment, and I touched two of them. I </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">made it across the street before
I realized that I was barefoot (not a </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">good idea in San Francisco) and
had to go back in.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Chelsea still hasn&#8217;t looked into
murders in the area, or the history </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">of the house, but I&#8217;m strongly
encouraging her. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">back in the 1800's there was a
family that lived where Haven Health center in Danilson,Ct is today. The
youngest daughter of the family was playing outside when the ball she was
playing with rolled out in to the street just as a horse and carrage were
comeing up the rode. she was runover and killed. at the center now all the
workers know that when a resident says that they see a little girl or they are
talking to a little girl and they cant see anyone there they know that
something is gonna happen to the resident either they will die or gett hurt in
some way and one of these little things happened once when i was visiting my
grandfather a women was talking to the little girl and after they put her to
bed she tried fallowing the little girl and she fell getting out of bed and
broke her arm.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">and other story is of my
grandfathers death in the same center. when my mother, aunt, and cousin went to
go see my grandfather she was acting a little strange she kept on seeing some
amn wiht a black berd and asking who he was but noone could see him. so the
next morning the nurses asked my grandfather if he would like anything and he
said, " yes i would, could u pack me some clothes and get the keys to my
car adn tell my wife that i am going somewhere with this berded man." but
see the chatch is that the nurse did not see anyone and my grandmother had
already passedon. so the nurse went to go get his pills and when she came back
he had died. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">heres a story about me. this was
about four years ago and it was a few days after my grandmother had died. i was
going through something at school and i was really upset about my grandmother.
so i was sitting on my bed crying when i felt a hand on my shoulder and i went
ot go put my hand on the hand and there was nothing there then when i looked
back i saw my grandmother. and to te u the truth i was freaked out at all i
actually felt pretty safe. and every once in a while the musical angel i got
after she died( it was her favorite and mine too) even if i dont go near it or
touch it for months it just will play of a little bit, and when i say "hi
mem`e" it stops playing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">This is another story I would
like to submit to your website, and although it is not a teffying tale of
ghostly spirits, it is nonetheless true.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">first off let me just say that I
have had my fair share of ghostly experiences, and that not all are happy ones.
After moving into our home, it came to my attention that we were not the only
ones residing in the house. After several attempts to convince my husband and
family that I seen small comet like lights, heard women speaking to each other
in our pantry,seen things that look like black bumble bees floating around the
ceiling, a little girl run passed me in the hall, and a man that would peek
around the doorway of our bedroom. Noone would believe me. As the year went on
I would experience more and more of the unexplained. I got to a point where I
would actually cry because I thought I was losing it. Finally my dear friend
Mallory said she believed. She had been to my house that Easter during the
beginning of our second year. She came to my house to visit my girls. She shot
a few pictures of my daughters with their easter baskets. When she got the
photos back she found several strange things in the pictures. We decided to
spend a day shooting pics around the house to see if we could<span style="">&nbsp; </span>catch more. After spending most of the day
and night doing this we decided to sit down on my living room couch and talk
about what all I had seen.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Let me explain how my living room
is set up. It is a perfect square, except for where the fireplace used to be,
the man who sold us the house walled it up causing a catty corner wall, instead
of two walls meeting to make a corner. My couch is against this wall facing the
room catty corner. Next to my couch is the entry way that leads to my dinning
room. We were both sitting indian style on the couch facing each other, my back
was to the corresponding wall, her back to the dinning room entry way. With
that set up I can continue.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">We were discussing our paranormal
experiences and I confided in Mal that it all frightened me (it did at the time
anyway, you get used to it), and Mal was consoling me saying that it was
"Okay to have these feelings" and "there was nothing to
fear" and "I speak openly to spirits all the time" and "I
am never fearful of ghosts or spirits" and "spirits usually
communicate with me often" and " I guess that it doesn't bother me
because they are always around me". The whole time she was saying this I
was watching something that seemed to be peeking around the corner of the entry
way at her. I noticed that everytime it peeked around at her she would shiver
as if she had a cold chill. Being polite I didn't say anything to her about
what I saw, because I did not want to interupt her speech about not fearing the
dead. After a few more "people always fear what they don't
understand" and "I don't feel that there is anything scary or
dangerous about this house", I watched as this thing peeking from the
corner,turn into a small comet like entity and<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>moved toward the ceiling and floated through the entry way into the room
with us. I was very calm and when I realized that Mal was still going on about
" all the spirits like to talk to me, why do you think that is?", I
looked at her and answered, I don't know Mal, but maybe that one there would
like to talk to you.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">At this point Mal spun around on
the couch to look at what I was pointing to. She didn't just turn her head, I
mean she jumped and spun in mid-air! It happened so quickly I thought for sure
she broke something, or injured herself, and to this day I have never seen
anyone move that fast! She looked up facing it, and that is when she started
screaming. She threw her hands out in front of her, like she was trying to push
it away. This thing started to move eratically, like trying to find a place to
hide, which made Mal scream even more, then she started doing this weird
jumping movement, she was at the opposite end of the couch, but managed to
clear the distance in no time to my end. It was like the girls bottom grew feet
and walked her to my end of the couch! All the while screaming at the top of
her lungs, OOOH NNOOO! NOOO! OOOH! NOOOO! She was all the way in my lap before
the thing finally shot down from the ceiling and vanished through my floor. All
I could do was laugh. Really hard. She kept saying "I didn't expect to see
that, I didn't expect to see that". It was the funniest thing I had EVER
seen in my life. I swear if Mal ever lost her legs or the use of her legs, she
could walk with her butt. Because that night she did. True story.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I grew up in Santee, Ca. born and
raised in the same home. As far back as I</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">can recall, I often saw shapes at
the end of my bed. I would here the sound</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">of someone walking that never
seemed to end, yet when I asked my parents who</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">was up walking around last night,
they stated that no one was. I would also</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">here dished in the dish rack move.
As I got older I began to hear my name</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">being called in a whisper. I
would turn to see and no one would be there. I</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">often would feel something push
my shoulder, gently, but a definate push or</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">pressure being applied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had my hair pulled gently one time getting
into</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">the shower. No one else in the
house seemed to feel or hear anything, just</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">me. I have since lived in a few

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I have worked at Lovelace Medical
Center in Albuquerque, NM, for about 18 years. At one point, the southwest end
of the 4th floor was used as a hospice unit. From the nurse's station you can
look down the hallway. Inside the fire doors is a long hallway, with 6 private
rooms on either side of the hall, for a total of 12 rooms.At the other end of
the hall is a fire escape stairwell. This hallway always has cold spots, which
give off eerie feelings. Also from several of the rooms you can feel
emanations, some of them very angry. One particular room causes many people to
veer away to the other side of the hall to avoid going near it. One evening I
was walking down the hall with 2 co-workers, and we were chatting, not very
loudly. We all heard a voice from one of the empty rooms say, "Be
Quiet". I should point out that for the last several months, this hallway
has not been used very often, and is usually empty. Another night, I bought a
disposable camera and took pictures there. The pictures at the nurse's station
(3 of them) all came out, but about 18 pictures I took down the hallway would
not produce prints. Also, the negatives show the outlines of all the doorways
and the plates on the walls with the room numbers on them, but they wouldn't
show up on printer paper. I still have the pictures, negatives and a CD. I then
took a few pictures of some friends, and my daughter took some pictures of
landscape near our house, all of which came out. I always feel as though the
back of my head tightens up when I am up on this unit. There are other
instances, and incidents from other of my co-workers, but it would take a long
time to detail them all.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My dad tells this story because I
was not even born when this happened. When</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">my mom was pregnant with me my
parents were living with my grandma. She</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">lived in a small town called Ft.
Lupton in Colorado. Many people in this</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">town swear that their houses are
haunted! Any way back to my dad's story.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">They were sleeping in a little
room built in my grandmother's basement. Mind</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">you that my grandma is very
sensitive to auras and she can feel a presence</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">if it exists. She absolutely
refused to go in that basement! She paid my</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">aunt or older cousin to do her
laundry for her because the washer and drier</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">was down there. The night when
the incident occured was a very scary night</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">for my father and the story goes
like this...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">When him and my mother were
sleeping he woke up and got a sudden feeling of</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">fear and dread. This is the same
feeling that another writer explained in</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">her story. He suddenly could not
move and he was frozen. He said he felt an</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">evil presense in the room. He
looked towards the door and saw a really dark</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">spot darker then the rest of the
room. He suddenly got the feeling that what</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">ever was there wanted to hurt the
baby (me). It seemed like 20 minutes but</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">finally he mustered up enough
strength to just place his hand over my</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">mother's stomach. He started to
pray really hard and after a while he felt</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">at peace and the dark spot
disapeared. Now this basement has the<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>only light</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">at the top of the stairs so he
would have to walk all the way across the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">room in order to turn it on!
Imagine how spooky that would be after that</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">experience. When he was able to
move again, he woke my mom and asked her,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">"did you feel that?!"
She did not. Later my grandma found out that the man</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">she bought the house from was a
doctor in the 60's and he used to practice</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">in his home using the basement as
his office. When she moved in she said he</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">left a bunch of strange gadgets and
furniture in the corner of the basement</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">that she refused to use to store
her things. Our theory is that maybe he was</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">one of those doctors who was
doing illegal abortions and his ghostly</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">intention was to do the same to
me. I have always been very interested in</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">the supernatural. I love reading
these stories but I always freak myself</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">out! I am just like my grandma in
the sense that I am also very sensitive to</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">auras and energies. I have never
seen a ghost or experienced one but I can</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">always sense a presence. I can
feel cold spots and I will pick up on</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">emotions that certain aura's give
off, I will feel depressed or sad or even</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">happy It is strange. But I kind
of am glad that I can not see ghosts or</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">spirits because it will probably
be to over whelming for me. I sometimes</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">have dreams that I encounter a
ghost and in my dream I always pass out.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Anyway thanks for listening to my
story sorry I babble on too long.. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My story:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">About 2 to 3 years ago I was
staying with my boyfriend at his mother's</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">house for the weekend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was recovering from lung cancer surgery. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">First, I would like to give you a
little history of his family before I</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">tell the story.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">When my boyfriend was 15 (he is
now 44) his brother was killed in a car</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">accident in Germany.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My boyfriend and his parents were living in a</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">community right outside of Fort
Dix NJ when this happened and his mother</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">still lives in the same house
today.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Now for my story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like I said above, I was staying with my
boyfriend</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">for the weekend at his mother's
house, she was recovering from lung</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">cancer surgery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went to bed and I was in a twilight type
of sleep</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">when I felt something reach into
me and pull me out of my body and throw</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">me in doorway of his
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While I was laying in the
doorway I felt</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">frozen like I couldn't move and
then I was pulled back into my body. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">After I was back in my body I
woke up and started to tremble and had</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">chills going up and down my
spine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not tell my boyfriend about</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">this at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, the next time I stayed over at his
mothers</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">house with him, I layed on the
other side of him when we went to bed,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">curled up facing his back and
wide awake (for obvious reasons).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
a</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">while I started to feel relaxed
and then it happened again, only this</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">time when I felt something reach
into me to pull me out I curled up</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">really hard and said no!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stopped immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I rolled over onto my</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">back and I felt like something
was laying right on top of me kind of</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">bouncing up and down like it
wanted to play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I layed completely still</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">and after a little while it
stopped and went away.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">After these two experiences,
everytime I was over at his mother's house</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I would fell ilke someone was
lightly tickling me on the back of my</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I decided to tell my boyfriend about the
experiences I was</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">having.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my surprise, he was not surprised at
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He proceeded to</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">tell me about an experience he
had when he was around 25 and visiting</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">with his parents for the
holidays.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was laying in his room
getting</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">ready to take a nap after dinner
when he saw a white fuzzy like figure</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">in his doorway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He layed still and it rushed him and layed on
top of</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">him for a short while and then
went away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He felt like it just wanted</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">to play with him and that was the
same way I felt when I had my experiences.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">A few months later, the water
pump busted and flooded the downstairs</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">area where my boyfriends room
happened to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The carpeting was</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">completely replaced throughout
the entire downstairs and there has not</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">been an experience since.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Thank you for allowing me to
share my story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have been searching
all</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">over the Internet and have not
been able to find anyone with a story</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">similar to mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It definitely happened and it is an
experience I will</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">never forget.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I should note that before this experience I
did not</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">believe in ghosts, but I
certainly do now!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">1506 East North Bay St, Tampa
Fl--While living in this house we had all kinds of weird things happen ,Dishes
flying in the kitchen, front and back doors which would open and close by
themselves, food disappearing from the house.The opening to the attic would
bounce up and down a if someone was messing with it.The worst was when a black
headed lady with a knife was seen. She was also seen by the next couple who
lived in the house. The woman left her boyfriend and told him she would never
return to that house. Years later {we had moved next door to 1508] a friend of
mine who attended USF wanted to write about our experiences. He came over with
a tape recorder. At the time I began telling him the story, the lights came on,
on the front porch next door. Everybody started freaking out. The house was
empty. Next the living room lights came on. We ran across the street to our
neighbor.She knew the landlords number. He said we were all nuts, because the
electricity in the house was shut off. In the morning when he came to check on
the house every light bulb in the living room chandelier was busted and laying
on the floor. No one would live in it, and it stayed empty for years, finally
it burned down.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Well, here's a few for you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I worked there, which was nearly 10
years</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">ago already, there was much talk
about a headless golfer there, dressed in</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">a green sweater and green plaid
pants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I personally never saw him, but a</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">few of the long-timers swear they
have and that he wasn't nice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, if I</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">recall correctly, that would be
where the being touched on the shoulder</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">part comes in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That, I did experience once, but never saw
anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">absolute freakiest thing that I
experienced there was when one day, a cook</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">and I went to the basement (can't
for the life of me remember what we were</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">looking for!).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, a little bit of info for you on the
basement there,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">it's HUGE and there are many
tunnels that lead away from the club and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">underneath the golf course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had gone into a room that was just about</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">under the golf course and while
we were rummaging through a shelf for</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">something a really cold draft
came through the room and then the door</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">slammed shut on us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no way this was wind from outside
or</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">anything, we were in the basement
for crying out loud, and deep into it for</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">that matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, you must also know that the door to this
room swung IN,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">so if another employee was
playing a joke on us, we would have seen them</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">close the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I, of course screamed, and the cook with me
did as well,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">although, I doubt he would admit
it now LOL!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The door seemed to be stuck</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">for just a few seconds when we
tried to open it, but it did open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
went</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">barreling down the halls and back
up to the kitchen and nobody had a clue</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">what had happened down
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, if you knew these people
they would</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">have been laughing hysterically
at us if it were a joke, but this time, no</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">one was laughing, in fact, they
all became scared as well, especially those</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">that had worked there for many
years.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The only other incident I recall
personally witnessing was being down in</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">the locker room bar, after
closing, with a few others and that a bottle or</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">a glass (can't remember exactly
which now) simply fell of the counter</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">behind the bar and broke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one had been back their for nearly an
hour. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">One girl with us, who has seen
many things there, just got up and said "Not</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My best friend and I were having
a sleepover just like anyother friday night. well we were trying to stay up all
night. It was about 2:00 AM and not a single light was on in my house except
for the computer that we were palying on. Well we started hearing noises coming
from my stairs it sounded like creaking stairswell the funny thing was is that
the stairs in my house wernt wooden they were covered by carpet. we just
ignored the sound not thinking anything of it when my best friend had to get a
drink well the kitchen was right next to my stairs and i decided i was thirsty
and i needed a drink to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when we were
walking past the stairs my friend stopped dead in her tracks. I started
laughing because she almost knocked me over. i looked where she was looking and
this little girl was just standing there starig at us! we were to scared to
move so we just stood there hoping that day wasnt the last day of our lives.
the little girl looked just like a pioneer girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had a white pretty dress on and she had a
bonnet on. she looked between the ages of 10-11 well when we couldnt stand it
anymore we ran as fast as we could back by the computer we were screaming our
heads off trying to wake up someone else in my house so they could scare her
off. but when we were screaming she just vaished into thin ai. it was like she
was floating there and then poof she was gone. after that my friend got really
freaked out and called home the next morning. when she was about to leave and
her parents were at my house the dorr swung open. there wasnt a slightest
breeze out side. well when it happened my friend and said "GO HOME
SALLY"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and the door slowly shut. my
mom was in the room and we jsut sat there thinking is this really sally and how
did we know what to say at the same time. my mom said that it was nothing. and
when we told her about that following encounter with her she said it was our
minds running wild and we were playing games. after fighting with my mom about
it for a while she said that she felt 2 cold hands put on her shoulders and she
finally believed us! well my friend has never came over to my house since then.
and she was saying how she thoguht she saw her at her house too. im sorry this
is a very long story but i swear to the bottom of my heart every thing that is
said in this is totally true!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">In my old home town, Cassopolis
MI, my dad and I used to take care of a yard that was around a very old stone
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got a job to mow in a small
fenced area with a small building in it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While mowing I heard children playing and felt someone watching me from
inside of the building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one lived in
the home at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While walking
around the yard after we finished, I noticed in the concrete a small cement
door with a rusty hand on it, I suspect that this was a house involved with the
Underground Railroad, or it was a Plantation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also, where I am now, Mishawaka IN, there are some strange things
happening in my house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Examples are
hearing voices through the vent when no one is home, hearing footsteps upstairs
when no one is home, Relfections of a face in a window behind me when no one is
there, a tall dark hooded figure standing over my bed in the dead of night, and
the weight of someone sitting near me when I am covered up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At my girfriends house, I have felt someone
lay down beside me in her bed when no one is at her house and my little brother
from the basement when he is at my house.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I really like your website.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are a lot of cool things there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I find the subject of ghosts and
things like Bigfoot to be absolutely fascinating.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Thank you for keeping up the
website.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I look at it a lot.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">There is a place just down the
road from where I work that I always thought felt quite strange.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Then, the other day, I read on
your website that it is haunted and has ghosts. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>TOO COOL!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I have a haunted house story for
you.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Up to you if you print it or not,
I just thought I would share it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I lived in Dallas, Texas for the
majority of my life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We moved there when
I was about 7 years old into a neighborhood called Pleasant Grove.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the corner of Gaylord and Hilburn, there
is a house there that was the subject of much talk around the
neighborhood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a 90 year old
woman next door to us who looked us in the eyes and told us not to ever go in
that house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we asked her why she
just always made us promise to never go in there because it was an evil, cursed
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you look at it, it just looks
wrong, not like any other house on the block.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Throughout the 20+ years I lived in that neighborhood, nobody ever
stayed in that house for even a year.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>People would move in and then move right out very quickly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There just seemed to be something wrong with
the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once, the owners of the house
next door to it came to do some repairs and told us that that house on the
corner did not like people in it and to never go in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody ever stayed in that house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stood vacant for years, and then the city
finally had it condemned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of the
children in the neighborhood ever went in or even dared others to go in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It just had a bad feeling to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It felt like it was&#8230; looking at you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never came closer than the front yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t know if it still stands, but it was
still there when I moved out 3 years ago, boarded up and wasting away.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Living with Spirits</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">By: HaLeYsCoMiT202@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">When I was 16 I was living in a
very old home that my mother had bought from my aunt. Well we already knew that
the house had spirits in it, but we had not known that they would be as bad as
they were. I will start by letting you know that I never tucked my covers under
my mattress because I would always pull my covers under my feet at night. Well
sometimes when I would try to pull my covers up they would not move! Someone or
something would be sitting at the end of my bed. We always kept the bathroom
light on at night well every now and then it would cut off by itself. My dad
and mom had went on to bed one night and my mom had told my dad to move over
well here walks my dad out of the bathroom 2 seconds after she had said that!!!!
I had my daughter shortley there after. I would lay in the floor sometimes and
watch television, my daughters toys would start playing by there self. One of
which had no batteries at the time. My dad would hear someone walking back in
forth in our hallway. Us kids had to sleep in the back of the house and that
was the most haunted part of the house. I had made my daughter a nursery in the
room that had an attick and I had set up baby monitors well my dad was in the
kitchen and he heard the baby cooing. He walked back to see what she was doing
and when he peeked his head around the corner this white object flew out of the
room going through the house and went into my parents room! Needless to say we
moved shortley afterwards. I wish I could tell you everything about this house
but I would be here for hours. Something happened everyday there I even caught
a glimpse of one myself. I hope you post this. Oh by the way the house is in
Pine Mountain, GA Thanks for letting me tell my story. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I was in manila(<st1:country-region><st1:place>philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>)
at that time for my review because I was about to take my board exam that
year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the first 3 months I stayed
with my sister in a boarding house in quezon city,I have experienced a few,
mildly scary situations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would have
classes in the morning and i'll be home for lunch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Normally, my sister and her friends would be
out that time and I will be left on my own.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It doesn't seem to matter to me for I thought there was nothing to be
afraid of but everytime I get to go to the cr, I hear knocks with nobody in the
house. It's the same rhythmic knock over and over again... like knock...
knock...and then it's gone... at first I thought it was just the wind but
because it was rather frequent, I noticed it sounded the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm the kind of person who would normally run
into something that scares me just to see that there's actually nothing to be
scared of so when I would notice the knocking, I would immediately open the
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As expected, there was nothing
there. But one time, during my sister's board exam(she was there for her exam
as well), I was all alone in the house and that time I was in the cr cleaning
up the head of the electric fan... The door was open at that time and when i
looked towards the door, I saw a mild white sil uette pass across the living
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw it through a mirror actually
and I ran towards it but it wasn't there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I got chills and was really scared so I sat down the sofa and
prayed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coincidentally or not, the
lights started blinking...It didn't do that before but it started blinking.
Well, I was told that a white lady was seen there before and those who have
seen it have all passed their board exams. Oh well, I guess that explains why I
passed.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">After my sister's exam, she had
to go back home and I was left in manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I decided to live in a dormitory. I never thought my ghost stories would
have a continuation there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even at home,
I normally have these dreams of the same entity, a black shadow-like image that
would try to kiss and rape me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Scary
stuff!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would actually feel it's
breathing and feel it doing it's thing on me. When I was there it happened to
me again and that wasn't only it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
night, I went to the cr to pee, I thought there were girls who were still awake
at that time(around 11:30) there were really loud laughters that sounded like
they were really having fun but when I left the cr,everything was still... it
was really scary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran to my room but
during that time, I saw a black sphere run pass me and when my eye followed its
path I saw a shadow that seemed to wanna run away from me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was it! I was so scared I ran so fast. A
few nights after that, I had a dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was going in circles then everything stood still, I was surrounded by girls and
this little boy around 9 years old walk towards me...I didn't see their faces
but we talked and they said they will guide me and my friends...When I told
this to my friend, she asked me as to what language we used and I said there
were actually no words... just an understanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then another friend got scared and asked me
about the boy...As to what age I think he was...I said around 9...She stood up
and said she had a dream too about that boy...He talked to her and said h name
was Nino... Scary stuff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, that
dorm used to be an adoption center and was run by nuns.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That's all thank you for reading it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pls tell me if you have anything to advice.</p>

</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Just to let you all know I was
not a believer. I'm the kind "gotta to see it to beleive it". We
lived in a farm house ( when I was a kid) out in Birch Run, Michigan. The house
was between Elms Rd. &amp; Morrish Rd. on Birch Run Rd. The house is not there
anymore. My dad said that it was haunted. He is big on reading novels. He would
lay his novel down. Get up to do something or to go to bed or to work. When he
came back to read the book its gone. Nobody has touched it or moved it. I'm 28
now. My dad told me about this few years ago.I never seen that ghost. I remeber
my dad use to joke w/ my brother &amp; me about a "blue invisible ghost
name George" at that time of living that house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Then when I was in Vassar High
School (MIchigan) my mom &amp; my ousin Rita sat my brother &amp; I down to
talk about a ghost that was in the trailor that we lived in at the time. The
night before Rita fell asleep on the couch. Before she fell asleep she shut the
living room light off. Later on Rita woke up to see my mom shuting the light
off. They had then conversated about how the light got turn back on. I guess
that's when they came to the conclusion that there was ghost. They told my
brother &amp; I about it. They said not to be scared (to late for me). That
kind of stuff scares me. Again I never saw anything at that time.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">When I met my husband I knew he
believed in spirits &amp; ghosts. He has told me in the Mill Rd Apartments in
Flint Township (Michigan) he saw the devil walking down the hallway.I asked my
husband (Blake) how did he know that was the devil. Blake said that he asked
him &amp; commande him to leave.That was the last time Blake saw him (there at
least)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Now we own our own house on
Concord Stout in Flint (Michigan). This is when I started to believe. Only
because I started to see. My husband told me that he &amp; friend (a Priest)
blessed the house all the way through.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i
asked my husband if he say any thing in the house. He said he sees angels in
our house. One time he got up &amp; saw an angel sitting on our couch. My
husband also believes the cats are evil spirit chaser. We have 3 cats.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Now my story, I know it took a
long time to get here. We have been living here for 4 years now. Shortly after
we moved in here is when I started to see things.At night when my husband is
sleeping, I'll sit up byself on the computer in the dark all the time. I would
see things moving out the corner of my eye. I saw this allot. Each time I
turned my head there was nothing there. We have a two bedroom house. One night
my husband was in bed I was in the dark on the computer. A moan came from our
spear bedroom. Nobody was in it. I was scared. I got up &amp; ran to our
bedroom where my husband was. I woke him &amp; told to shut the computer off
&amp; hurry back. I told him what happen. He doesn't beleive me. He beleives
that but doesn't believe me. After<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
gaved birth to my daughter &amp; brought her home, I was laying on the couch
Caitlyn (my daughter) was laying next to me in her bouncer on the floor. I was
just looking at the other end of my couch &amp; saw a shadow (body fiigure)
moving across my living room. It moved a couple of feet the disappear. I was in
shock that I couldn't move or use my voice.Then when Caitlyn was 3 or 4 monthes
I was up byself My family was in thier rooms sleepng. I saw a head in my
dinning room. It was dark in there. Then in the other direction in my living
room I heard a voice that went psssss. Again I ran to my husband to shut things
off.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Now I'm interested in learning
more about shadows &amp; the history of my house &amp; the people that lived
here. If you can help me in to learn please email me at nonya9677@yahoo.com. Or
if you lived any of these places that I have mention please share them w/ me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I was about 3 years old when this
occured. My mother and Aunt were driving on the expressway with me in the back
seat. I was sucking on a peice of hard candy. Momments later my mother noticed
that I was choking. She pulled the car over, her and my Aunt were trying
everything to get the candy out of my throat, they said I was turning blue and
couldn't breathe. The only thing I remember that day was a man in a grey suite
had approached us on the expressway. He walked up to me and placed his hands on
my throat. He was telling me that everything would be okay. Just then the candy
came up and I started to cry. My mother took me in her arms and was crying. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Years later I asked my mom about
that day and told her I remember little bits and pieces of what had happened.
She explained that it was the wierdest thing. When she turned around seconds
later the guy had vanished. Til this day my mother &amp; aunt are still trying
to figure out how did the guy get to the middle of the expressway where my
mother had pulled over. There was no car other than hers that pulled over. It
would be impossible for him to just be walking on the expressway, it was too
dangerious for anybody to do so. She also said if he was walking she would have
seen him walking away but there was nobdy in sight seconds after she turned to
thank him. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">There is only one explaination.
He was my guardian angel and seen that I needed help.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I live in Omaha, Ne, my son
Shane, wanted my apartment key so he could do some laundry while I was at work.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">He promised to be home at <st1:time minute="30" hour="21">9:30 pm</st1:time>, I get off of my second job at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
got to my apartment building at <st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30</st1:time>,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not see his van in the parking lot, but
I was tired, and I wanted to just take a shower and go to bed.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I went up to the second floor
where I live, tried the door, and of course, it was locked, I heard Pe'pe, my
Pomeranian, bark, then I heard a girls voice say "Quiet Pe'pe" coming
from inside my apartment. I thought for sure, Shane took a girl to my
apartment, and told her not to open the door, I was so mad at my son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I again pounded on the door, Pe'pe started
barking again, and I heard, coming from the other side of the door," Pe'pe
be quiet"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said to the girl behind
the door, "Look, I've been working all day, and I'm tired!"</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I finally gave up, and went out
to the parking lot, I got in my car, and waited for about 10 minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went back up to try again, I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>pounded on the door again, but this time
there's was no barking, I pounded again this time even louder, but it was like
Pe'pe was under a restraint. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I then again, went to the parking
lot, as I shut the door, I saw Shane's van coming into the parking lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He got out of his van and said" I'm
sorry Mom, I am so late".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said
" Shane, do you have a girl upstairs in my apartment," Shane said
"NO."</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I started to tell him what happen
as we went up to my apartment, he opened the door, Pe'Pe came bounding up to
see us, I checked every inch of my apartment, but there was no one there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My apartment does not have a back
door to slip out of, the only way in or out is through the front door.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Every now and then, the door to
the deck will open up, with no wind blowing, and I do feel a presence, though
not a bad one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This all started when we
got back from spending the night at the "Villisca Axe Murder House in
Villisca Iowa, could it be a ghost hitched a ride home with us???</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">There is a woman who lives in my
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She walks up and down the halls
and has been seen by several people out in the back yard tending to the
roses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This house was built in 1870.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I live in <st1:place><st1:City>Senoia</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Ga.</st1:State></st1:place><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She also opens and closes the back door. This happens after we lock the
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have actually asked her not to
leave the door open when we are at work, and so far she has been
complying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have had a psychic medium
come here and identify her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lady
that lives next door is 90 and has described this woman as a previous owner
around the 1900's</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">She is a very loving spirit and
loves this house.</p>

window.and it waved at me I was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>freaking
