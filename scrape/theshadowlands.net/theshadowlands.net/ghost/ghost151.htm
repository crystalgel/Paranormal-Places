<b>Red Rose</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; LILBUTTERBUTT@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi I'm Lindsay Llarena,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm 10yrs old and I just moved to Indio CA. Just
last week is when</b>
<br><b>this spooky ghost appeared to me.</b>
<br><b>Let me give you a discription of my house.</b>
<br><b>My house looks just like one of those little cute cottages. In the</b>
<br><b>garden; everything's dead except this beautiful red rose. There
are 3</b>
<br><b>bedrooms in the house, as you go into the living room there is an
arch</b>
<br><b>that leads you in.Well anyways here's the story...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as I was coming home from grade school I
saw three little boys</b>
<br><b>saying that they just saw a beautiful woman at ****** carmel circle
(mind</b>
<br><b>you this is my house that the three boys where talking about). So
I ran</b>
<br><b>to my house thinking my mom was home. As I got to the walkway that
leads</b>
<br><b>to the door I saw a woman tendering the "Red Rose." She looked right
up</b>
<br><b>at me and smiled, then she vanished into thin air. I was very spooked</b>
<br><b>after that. The next 2 weeks I kept on feeling this evilness while</b>
<br><b>passing the arch that leads into the living room. No one else felt
this</b>
<br><b>except me and my dog. When ever my dog passed the arch he'd always
groul</b>
<br><b>at it. After that I asked the neighboors if a woman had lived there
and</b>
<br><b>died underneth the arch. They only said "no sorry, I just moved
here"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I asked this lady that was called the "witch"
in our</b>
<br><b>neighborhood. She said there was a happy couple that built that
house</b>
<br><b>and after they moved in they got in a huge fight.(so I guess they</b>
<br><b>weren't a happy couple after all) The lady that lived in the house
had</b>
<br><b>came over to the witches house and told her what had happened to
her.</b>
<br><b>The night after that, the man had killed the beautiful woman UNDER
the</b>
<br><b>arch. Well I keep feeling the same evilness under the arch. If you
have</b>
<br><b>any questions about what happened next E-mail me at</b>

<p><b>Fright House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: KDWardMD@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I'm not too sure exactly what happened to me, but I have grown up
in a house</b>
<br><b>that was a rather frightening place for any child to grow up in.&nbsp;
For</b>
<br><b>starters, this is not a historic house, it was built in the 1970s
and is</b>
<br><b>modern in almost every way (thankfully, my mother finally replaced
the shag</b>
<br><b>carpeting).&nbsp; Anyway, at night, when I was a little girl, a
woman would come</b>
<br><b>into my room every night dressed in what I can best describe a corset
and a</b>
<br><b>skirt of some kind.&nbsp; She would tuck me in and sing me to sleep,
especially if</b>
<br><b>I woke up in the middle of the night.</b>
<br><b>When I was 16, though, I had an experience that made me wish I could
have</b>
<br><b>left for college right then and there.&nbsp; It was about 3 in the
morning and no</b>
<br><b>one was awake.&nbsp; My brother was away at college, my father worked
third shift</b>
<br><b>and my mother was sleeping in the bedroom 2 doors down from mine.&nbsp;
I woke up</b>
<br><b>because I could not roll over, like I was paralyzed.&nbsp; My eyes
took a minute</b>
<br><b>to focus, but I am not joking when I tell you I saw a blonde haired
man</b>
<br><b>hovering over me, holding my arms above my head (my brother and
father both</b>
<br><b>have black hair).&nbsp; He smiled at me and as I got enough energy
to sit up, I</b>
<br><b>passed right through him as he disappeared.&nbsp; Needless to say
I slept with my</b>
<br><b>mother the rest of the night and DID NOT even try to explain what
had</b>
<br><b>happened.</b>
<br><b>Another time, my mother was taking a shower at about 12 am, alone
in the</b>
<br><b>house, when the bathroom door opened and closed, causing the shower
curtain</b>
<br><b>to blow inward long enough for her to catch a glimpse of a shadowy
cloud</b>
<br><b>disappear through the door.&nbsp; She put her robe on and waited
outside, on our</b>
<br><b>front porch for one of us to get home before she would return inside.</b>
<br><b>Oddly enough though, these beings, whatever they are, prefer the
women and</b>
<br><b>don't bother the men that much.&nbsp; My father never saw them while
he was alive.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My brother, an ordained minister, could hear them and was
convinced they</b>
<br><b>were evil since they were not with God, but even his attempt to
banish them</b>
<br><b>was not enough to last for any length of time.&nbsp; It stopped
the sounds until I</b>
<br><b>moved out, but when I left permanently, they got very upset and
began things</b>
<br><b>anew.&nbsp; When I go home now, I can hear a piano playing (my piano
is now at my</b>
<br><b>home) and I can hear people laughing, but when I leave, my mother
always</b>
<br><b>tells me that there has been something happen to let her know that
they did</b>
<br><b>not like me leaving.&nbsp; The last time, the shadow paced between
my old bedroom</b>
<br><b>and the bathroom for weeks before giving it a rest.&nbsp; I do not
know if they</b>
<br><b>are linked to me in some way, but I am definitely someone they like
to see.</b>
<br><b>I reside in Maryland, some 600 or so miles from where I grew up,
so I do not</b>
<br><b>think it could be a poltergeist thing usually associated to growing
girls,</b>
<br><b>and they tend to get worse not better when I am not around</b>

<p><b>By: DRickPerry@cs.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I grew up in a very rural area in West Virginia in a large
two story house</b>
<br><b>built by my grandfather.&nbsp; The house sat in a narrow valley
with cemeteries</b>
<br><b>located upon both opposite hillsides.&nbsp; One of these cemetaries
holds my</b>
<br><b>sister who died at the age of three, and having been born about
four years</b>
<br><b>after her death, I never knew her.&nbsp; Another sister, also older
than I, had a</b>
<br><b>room across from mine and my brothers (we three shared the same
room, which</b>
<br><b>was larger than hers), both on the second floor of the house.&nbsp;
One night when</b>
<br><b>I was about six years old I awoke in the dead of night to hear my
sister</b>
<br><b>sobbing in her room, the sound muffled by her closed door.&nbsp;
I lay for a long</b>
<br><b>time listening to her, wondering if I should check on her and ask
if she was</b>
<br><b>all right (or wake one of my brothers to do it).&nbsp; Instead I
simply lay there,</b>
<br><b>somewhat paralyzed by the sound of the sobs as they ebbed and swelled.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>remember that at some point I realized goosebumps were chilling
my arms, and</b>
<br><b>pulled up my covers around my neck to warm them.&nbsp; I also remember
that the</b>
<br><b>sobs had at some point taken on a sound that I found hard to correlate
with</b>
<br><b>my older sister.&nbsp; They sounded too young for her.&nbsp; At
some point I fell back</b>
<br><b>into slumber and woke to the smell of eggs, bacon, and coffee being
prepared</b>
<br><b>by my mother in the kitchen below.&nbsp; I dressed and went downstairs.&nbsp;
Seeing my</b>
<br><b>mother I quite casually asked, "Mom, what was sis crying about last
night?"</b>
<br><b>She turned to me with a stunned look on her face, halting her work
to blurt</b>
<br><b>out "What?"&nbsp; "I heard her crying really late last night, just
thought you</b>
<br><b>might know why, that's all."&nbsp; Her face had gone white as she
stood motionless</b>
<br><b>looking at me.&nbsp; "There's no way you could've heard your sister
last night"</b>
<br><b>she said, "she stayed with her friend Tina out in Spring Valley."&nbsp;
I could</b>
<br><b>have swallowed my tonque, Spring Valley was over thirty miles away.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>goosebumps of the night before returned to my arms at that moment.&nbsp;
A moment</b>
<br><b>that I both cherish for the realization of my possible contact with
my</b>
<br><b>deceased sister, and fear, for the very same reason.</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;The Green Mans Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LorDsOFaciD17@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>ok one nite my friendwas telling me about this tunnel out in west
mifflin</b>
<br><b>pennsylvania. he saidit was haunted by a green ghost. the story
behind the</b>
<br><b>ghost was that the man was walking home from work during a storm
and stopped</b>
<br><b>in the tunnel to get out of the rain and in there was a loose electic
wire</b>
<br><b>and he was electircuted and now he haunts the tunnel. he told me
of all this</b>
<br><b>sutuff that happens in the tunnel while ur in their so i decided
to check it</b>
<br><b>out myself. well me and my freinds went up in a car and parked in
the</b>
<br><b>tunnel. my freind said u had to turn the car off and sit in the
tunnel completely</b>
<br><b>silent wit ur windows down so u can listen. well we did just that.
we sat</b>
<br><b>there for about 5 minutes and nothing happened so we figured it
was fake.</b>
<br><b>well then we decided to smoke a cigarette while waiting and if nothing</b>
<br><b>happened by the time we were done smoking we would leave. so we
light up a</b>
<br><b>cigarette and within a minute we noticed a light shining into the
tunnel and</b>
<br><b>coming closer towards us. we got nervous that it was a car coming
so we</b>
<br><b>started our car up well no car came we looked at the end of thew
tunnel to</b>
<br><b>see what t could be but all that surrounded us was woods. so we
went back</b>
<br><b>into the tunnel and turned the car off within minutes, the light
came again</b>
<br><b>this time we decided to wait it out and see what would happen. well
the</b>
<br><b>light came up the tunnel we all got scared and started screaming
then the light</b>
<br><b>stopped. we sat there again and we heard voices. but we could tell
what they</b>
<br><b>were saying. we heard a baby crying&nbsp; and then children laughing.
it was</b>
<br><b>really freaky. . we decided to leav. well as we were leaving my
one freind</b>
<br><b>said no lets go back. well they decided the only way theyd go back
was if</b>
<br><b>theyd walk through the tunnel. so they did. i waited in the car
parked</b>
<br><b>outside of the tunnel cuz i was scared. now what happened nextwas
probably</b>
<br><b>the scariest thing ive ever heard. im starting to get goosebumps
and tears</b>
<br><b>just thinkign about it. i watched them walk throught the tunnel
and they</b>
<br><b>made it all the way through. when they got to the other side they
started</b>
<br><b>screaming and yelling "yea what now green man?" like a bunch of
idiots and</b>
<br><b>started to walk throught the tunnel ten i heard a loud humming noise
from</b>
<br><b>the tunnel and they ran as fast as they could out of there and we
left.</b>
<br><b>i also have one more&nbsp;&nbsp; experience to share. ill make it
short. we told other</b>
<br><b>people bout it and they wanted to go too so we took two cars up.
well it</b>
<br><b>sucked cuz nothing happened and they were being all loud cuz they
didnt</b>
<br><b>believe it. well they drove out of the tunnel and parked outside
of it.</b>
<br><b>after sittin gthere for a while we began to see the light. but the
other car</b>
<br><b>started there car back up and it stopped well as they went to pull
away,</b>
<br><b>their car got stuck in mud and they couldnt pull out their tires
ept</b>
<br><b>spinning well as soon as the tires started going, we seen the light,
we heard the</b>
<br><b>voices and thenthe loud humming all with in a matter of minutes.
i guess we</b>
<br><b>upset the ghost. it was really freaky</b>
<br><b>id appreciate it if u would respond to my story and tell me what
u think, or</b>
<br><b>if u have ever heard of the ghost of green mans tunnel&nbsp;&nbsp;
thanks for reading</b>

<p><b>The Appariton</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nanci.grizzaffi@ericsson.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>First, let me preface my story with the fact that I am now 50 years</b>
<br><b>old.&nbsp; Although I have experienced&nbsp; several encounters
with, what I</b>
<br><b>believe to be, someone or something from the other side, the following</b>
<br><b>is the most vivid.&nbsp; Over the years I have tried, desperately,
to</b>
<br><b>logically explain what happened to me, but have come to accept the
fact</b>
<br><b>that there are things that happen to us which we will never truly</b>
<br><b>understand.</b>
<br><b>When I was a young girl, 13 or 14 years old, I would help my father</b>
<br><b>repair old houses he had purchased and would then rent them out
for</b>
<br><b>extra money.&nbsp; He must have bought 15 very old houses in need
of repair,</b>
<br><b>over a 10 year period.</b>
<br><b>I married when I was 18 and my parents gave my husband and I the
option</b>
<br><b>of&nbsp; renting one of the old houses for a very minimal amount.&nbsp;
Of course,</b>
<br><b>we jumped at the opportunity to have our very own home, knowing
we could</b>
<br><b>decorate and do what we wanted to with it.</b>
<br><b>The house we moved into was about 75 years old with three big bedrooms</b>
<br><b>and a large living and dining area.&nbsp; It still needed some repairs,
so we</b>
<br><b>spent much of our free time painting and making the place presentable.</b>
<br><b>In a years time, most of the work was done and we were quite proud
of</b>
<br><b>our new home.</b>
<br><b>My husband was in sales and would leave for work around 5:00 a.m.
in</b>
<br><b>order to miss the heavy morning traffic on his way to the office.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>would usually sleep in for another hour or so because I didn't have
to</b>
<br><b>be at work until 9:00 a.m.&nbsp; One morning, after he left, I started
to</b>
<br><b>doze back into a slumber when I began to get a very uneasy feeling.&nbsp;
Our</b>
<br><b>bedroom had a door that lead into a long hallway, but our bed was</b>
<br><b>positioned so that I could only see the doorway and not into the
hall.</b>
<br><b>I had my back to the doorway, but felt someone was watching me.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>almost afraid to turn around and, also, afraid not to!&nbsp; I did,
finally,</b>
<br><b>look over my shoulder toward the doorway and saw, what looked like
a man</b>
<br><b>in a suit, just standing there.&nbsp; It was still rather dark in
the room,</b>
<br><b>so I opened my eyes wider and sat up in the bed, thinking I must
be</b>
<br><b>dreaming!&nbsp; The moment I sat up, this "man" turned and drifted
down the</b>
<br><b>hallway.&nbsp; I say drifted because, although he turned and went
towards the</b>
<br><b>hall, his feet weren't moving.&nbsp; It was like he was floating
away.&nbsp; I, immediately,</b>
<br><b>jumped out of bed and looked down the hall, but saw nothing.&nbsp;
I thought</b>
<br><b>it had to be my imagination and I, surely, must have been dreaming
and</b>
<br><b>just awoke at a bad time.&nbsp; I couldn't explain it and I didn't
believe in</b>
<br><b>silly things like ghosts!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;About a week later, after my husband left for work, I began
to get this</b>
<br><b>same eerie feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know I was not dreaming or asleep
because I</b>
<br><b>looked at my clock on the headboard and it read 5:49 a.m.&nbsp;
I slowly</b>
<br><b>turned around, and there was this man again!&nbsp; I tried to sit
up and</b>
<br><b>tried to scream, but nothing would come out of my mouth.&nbsp; I
felt frozen</b>
<br><b>and unable to move.&nbsp; The moment I was finally able to move,
I sat up.</b>
<br><b>He turned, slowly, and, again, floated down the hallway.&nbsp; I
really</b>
<br><b>thought I was losing it.&nbsp; I called my husband, at work, and
attempted to</b>
<br><b>tell him what had happened.&nbsp; Of course, he thought I was just
dreaming</b>
<br><b>and told me to quit thinking about it.&nbsp; Yeah, right!!</b><b></b>
<p><b>This man appeared to me almost every morning over the next year and
a</b>
<br><b>half.&nbsp; As long as I didn't sit up in the bed, he would just
stand in the</b>
<br><b>doorway looking at me.&nbsp; No expression, no movement.&nbsp; Just
stand there</b>
<br><b>for several minutes.&nbsp; I memorized every detail about him.&nbsp;
He wore a</b>
<br><b>dark brown suit, a white shirt and a tie that had diagonal strips
of</b>
<br><b>blue and brown.&nbsp; He was mostly bald, but his hair color was
brown.&nbsp; His</b>
<br><b>expression never changed.&nbsp; His hands hung down straight on
his sides and</b>
<br><b>I could never quite see his feet.</b>
<br><b>I would have to sit up to see his feet and that is when he would</b>
<br><b>disappear.&nbsp; My fear finally left after several months and I
simply</b>
<br><b>expected to see him when I awoke each morning.&nbsp; My husband
never saw him</b>
<br><b>and he thought I had a very vivid imagination.&nbsp; I didn't mention
this to</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;my husband anymore because he started suggesting I see a specialist!</b>
<br><b>My parents lived two houses from us and they would visit us often.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>mentioned this apparition to my dad a couple of times, but he too,</b>
<br><b>thought I must be dreaming.&nbsp; He had bought this house from
an old woman</b>
<br><b>that had lived there for many years and now lived in a nursing home.</b>
<br><b>One weekend, he said this woman called him and wanted to see what
we had</b>
<br><b>done to the house.&nbsp; She knew we were remodeling it and wanted
to see the</b>
<br><b>progress.</b>
<br><b>The following Sunday, my father went to pick the previous owner,
Ms.</b>
<br><b>Brady, up from the nursing home to visit with us.&nbsp; I had baked
some</b>
<br><b>cookies and had coffee and tea ready when she got there.</b>
<br><b>She was a very sweet old lady and loved what we had done with the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; We sat and listened to her tell us how things were
back when she</b>
<br><b>was young and how she had lived in the house over 50 years.&nbsp;
She began</b>
<br><b>to pull out some old pictures of how the house looked in its younger</b>
<br><b>years and there in her wallet was a picture that made me lose my</b>
<br><b>breath!&nbsp; The picture was of her husband and daughter some 40
years</b>
<br><b>earlier.&nbsp; When she saw the shocked look on my face, she turned
to me and</b>
<br><b>said, "have you seen Joe before"?&nbsp; I searched her eyes trying
to figure</b>
<br><b>out what she meant.&nbsp; Before I could answer, she said, "you
know, Joe</b>
<br><b>used to visit me every morning after he died".&nbsp; My eyes began
to tear up</b>
<br><b>because I knew for certain I wasn't crazy and what I saw was real!&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>told her I had seen him many times in the doorway staring at me.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>said, "oh, he's probably ondering why you're in the bed and not
me".</b>
<br><b>When I described to her what he was wearing, she said those were
the</b>
<br><b>clothes he was buried in.&nbsp; She then told me, how he died.</b>
<br><b>He was walking home from work and a streetcar passed him going very</b>
<br><b>fast.&nbsp; A rock popped up from the street and hit him in the
temple.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>made it home, but told her he was going to lie down before supper</b>
<br><b>because he had a headache.&nbsp; He never awoke, dying in his sleep.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>said her daughter also died in the house and asked if I had ever
seen</b>
<br><b>her.&nbsp; I told her I had not.&nbsp; She said that she always
set the dinner</b>
<br><b>table for three after their deaths and saw both of them often.&nbsp;
Kind of</b>
<br><b>weird, but I certainly had no reason to doubt her.</b>
<br><b>I never saw "Joe" after that day.&nbsp; He never again appeared
to me</b>
<br><b>anywhere else in the house.&nbsp; Mrs. Brady died about a year after
our</b>
<br><b>visit.&nbsp; I hope they are together and happy.</b>
<br><b>To this day, I will never doubt anyone's word about seeing a ghost.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>know how real Joe was to me.</b>

<p><b>Sleep Paralysis</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: giantcactus@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I haven’t heard too many stories quite like mine and would welcome
any</b>
<br><b>explanation anyone might have for these ‘episodes’ I’ve experienced.</b>
<br><b>>From time to time during my late teens and into my twenties, I
would</b>
<br><b>have a fairly regular episode where I was not exactly asleep OR
awake,</b>
<br><b>but in a strange heightened state where I felt scared and sometimes</b>
<br><b>paralyzed.</b>
<br><b>The first one I recollect is when I was sleeping over at my older</b>
<br><b>sister’s new apartment, which was a fairly old building, by Vancouver</b>
<br><b>standards, maybe 50 years old. I awoke (on the sofa) during the
night,</b>
<br><b>feeling suffocated, as I had somehow managed to become severely</b>
<br><b>entangled in the sheet. It was wound tightly over my face in such
a way</b>
<br><b>that I couldn’t breathe. I have never felt comfortable with pulling
the</b>
<br><b>covers over my head so I’m not sure why I would’ve done this in
my sleep</b>
<br><b>(especially since my sister had the heat turned up and it was</b>
<br><b>uncomfortably hot for me), but it’s certainly possible.</b>
<br><b>I couldn’t move at all, I was paralyzed and panic set in, my senses
were</b>
<br><b>heightened and I had no doubt that I was very, very awake. I could
‘see’</b>
<br><b>and feel the sheet over my face and it took every ounce of energy
I had</b>
<br><b>to move, even slightly. Once I was able to move an arm, the spell
seemed</b>
<br><b>to have broken, and then I actually, really ‘woke up’, and grabbed
the</b>
<br><b>sheet away from my face and gasped for air -- I then opened my eyes</b>
<br><b>physically. I was terribly shaken by the experience.</b>
<br><b>It happened again when I moved into a similarly old apartment building;</b>
<br><b>I lived in the basement suite - newly remodeled, I don’t think it
had</b>
<br><b>ever formerly been a living space that was adjacent to a boileroom.
I</b>
<br><b>fell asleep one night on my stomach with my head resting on the
edge of</b>
<br><b>my beanbag chair (remember those?) and a comforter covering me up
to my</b>
<br><b>shoulders. I ‘awoke’ for some reason, and looked up at the windows,</b>
<br><b>which, in reality, were covered by curtains. In my ‘vision’ there
were</b>
<br><b>no curtains and I became scared because I felt something was out
there</b>
<br><b>and I would see it peering in soon. I saw and felt the comforter
sliding</b>
<br><b>off of me as I started to sit up. I suddenly REALLY opened my eyes
but I</b>
<br><b>was still lying down, and the curtains were closed over the windows.</b>
<br><b>That time may have been just a dream?</b>
<br><b>The worst time this happened to me, was still in that same apartment.
I</b>
<br><b>was lying in my bed, my back facing the wall to the boileroom, and
I</b>
<br><b>‘awoke’, feeling paralyzed again, and felt a pressure, like arms
from</b>
<br><b>behind me, encircling my waist, pulling me through the wall. I</b>
<br><b>(psychically?) SAW my arms that were stretched out in front of me,
being</b>
<br><b>dragged across the sheets as I was being pulled. Again, it took
every</b>
<br><b>ounce of my being to move just a muscle to stop this from happening.</b>
<br><b>Once I broke free of this feeling, again, I physically opened my
eyes</b>
<br><b>and I was still lying in the same position.</b>
<br><b>Since that time, I had a few other episodes like that but none quite
as</b>
<br><b>memorable or as scary. I used to hate going to sleep for fear it
would</b>
<br><b>happen, and sometimes a feeling of falling right through the bottom
of</b>
<br><b>the bed and floor and floating, as if I was separating in two when
I was</b>
<br><b>falling asleep would precipitate these experiences. This hasn’t
happened</b>
<br><b>much and not nearly to the extent that it once did, but recently
when I</b>
<br><b>took a nap during the afternoon (I now live in San Francisco and
this is</b>
<br><b>at least 15 years later!) I had the paralyzed feeling again, and
thought</b>
<br><b>I heard someone with a key coming into my apartment, and going into
the</b>
<br><b>kitchen; I thought it might be a friend of mine coming to borrow</b>
<br><b>something. I heard/felt a presence then, in my room and when I pulled</b>
<br><b>myself out of this paralysis, which was actually pretty foggy this
time,</b>
<br><b>I realized no one was, or had been there. I hadn’t thought of those
past</b>
<br><b>experirnces in quite some time.</b>
<br><b>So, what is this that happens? Perhaps just fears manifesting themselves</b>
<br><b>in a physical way, or psychic experiences? Does anyone know? I would</b>
<br><b>appreciate any comments.</b>

<p><b>Our House on Linden Street</b><b></b>

We used to live in</b>
<br><b>this house on Linden Street.&nbsp; The scariest story happened to
the</b>
<br><b>non-believer in my family which was my father.&nbsp; He was laying
down in their</b>
<br><b>bedroom when he felt the heaviness of a woman laying on top of him
naked.</b>
<br><b>He felt her hair and was trying to withstand the weight of her on
top him</b>
<br><b>(he couldn't move).&nbsp; She told him she was going to take one
of his daughters</b>
<br><b>away from him, the youngest one.&nbsp; My dad asked why and she
said that she (my</b>
<br><b>little sister) was just the first one and then she disappeared.</b>
<br><b>Of course my father told my mother whom is a believer since it runs
in her</b>
<br><b>family and she immediately became worried and watched my little
sister very</b>
<br><b>carefully.&nbsp; We are 4 sisters, at this time however there were
only 3 of us</b>
<br><b>born so the youngest was my 3rd sister Brenda.&nbsp; I'm not to
sure how long</b>
<br><b>after her appearance this happened but my mom was working in the
front lawn</b>
<br><b>garden and my baby sister was in her walker (she was too little
to actually</b>
<br><b>walk yet).&nbsp; My mom said she it took her all of 2 seconds to
scoop some dirt</b>
<br><b>out for a seedling when my she heard my baby sister screaming.&nbsp;
She wasn't</b>
<br><b>in front of my mother anymore she had landed on the driveway (concrete)</b>
<br><b>still in her walker head first.</b>
<br><b>While my mother was screaming my name (I was playing near the corner)
a</b>
<br><b>nurse walks up to my mother, (by this time I've arrived) and she
asked my</b>
<br><b>mom what happened to the baby.&nbsp; After my mom told her she checked
my baby</b>
<br><b>sister and told my mom she should relax the baby was fine and she
should</b>
<br><b>calm her down and let her take a nap.&nbsp; There were no visible
markings on my</b>
<br><b>sister, bruises or even blood.&nbsp; My mom however, didn't listen
to the nurse</b>
<br><b>and ran around the corner (we had a hospital right around the corner).&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>baby sister was so sleepy but my mother kept shaking her awake until
she got</b>
<br><b>to the emergency room.&nbsp; While my mom left for the hospital
I turned around</b>
<br><b>to run inside the house and get my other sister and noticed that
the nurse</b>
<br><b>was nowhere around.</b>
<br><b>After my mom got to the hospital they told her she was very lucky
since my</b>
<br><b>sister had a fractured skull.&nbsp; Also, you have to understand,
my baby sister</b>
<br><b>couldn't walk so how did she fall over the edge of the garden into
the</b>
<br><b>driveway about 10 feet away from my mother in a few seconds.</b>
<br><b>When my last sister was about 4 years old she told my mother amazing
things.</b>
<br><b>She said she in the living room when Jesus walked in and he told
her that my</b>
<br><b>mother was reincarnated several times.&nbsp; She said she was not
going to die</b>
<br><b>yet and that she would come back 1 more time.&nbsp; She said other
things that I</b>
<br><b>can't remember since I was so young but the one thing that stands
out in my</b>
<br><b>mind is the accurate description of the man walking thru the front
door.</b>
<br><b>Also, he asked my sister to go with him but thankfully she didn't
and went</b>
<br><b>to my mother instead.</b>
<br><b>My sister and I used to be woken up at night by footsteps going
up and down</b>
<br><b>the steps in the middle of the night.&nbsp; My 2nd sister used to
hear them and</b>
<br><b>would even have vivid dreams about people in the house.&nbsp; My
mom after the</b>
<br><b>incident with my baby sister the 4th who saw Jesus was tired of
ghosts</b>
<br><b>threating her children and did a ritual that took all the spirits
out of the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; She also had the house blessed by different priests
in every</b>
<br><b>religion she could find.&nbsp; After that we didn't have any other
problems in</b>
<br><b>that house with ghosts.&nbsp; It would be impossible at this point
for me to tell</b>
<br><b>you of all the encounters my family has had with spirits but I can
tell you</b>
<br><b>that they are real and we are living proof that sometimes they have
motives</b>
<br><b>we will never understand.</b>

<p><b>Hissing</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: katl@raex.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This&nbsp; is the story of my friends house let's call her Mandi.</b>
<br><b>I was taking Mandi home from a school dance that we had attended
. we pulled into her driveway that faced her bedroom window. I felt eyes
stareing at me from the window.&nbsp; I looked up and there was a little
girl stareing at me from the window. The</b>
<br><b>thing was that nobody was home when I droped her off. The little
girl had blonde hair, and was really pale.&nbsp; When I went to pull out
of the driveway she vanished.</b>
<br><b>About a week later I was in Mandi's room practicing for singing
that we had to do later that night at church when I heard a hissing sound.
I heard the sound again when I went down stairs to use the restroom. Recently
Mandi has told me that when she was in her room she has heard the hissing
sound.</b>

<p><b>Is This What I Think it Is???</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: YoungGlow@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hello, my name is michelle, and im 16. ive been
living in my home for the</b>
<br><b>past 5 years. as far as i know there have been no deaths here. but
i dont</b>
<br><b>know all the people who have lived here. I live in a New England
farmhouse</b>
<br><b>that is over 200 years old, so there is a lot of history.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i started noticing "odd things" about two years
ago. my room was on the</b>
<br><b>second floor. the room next to mine was only used for storage because
the</b>
<br><b>door wouldnt stay closed. when winter came i duct taped the door
closed with</b>
<br><b>a few pieces of tape before i went to bed. in the morning the door
was</b>
<br><b>opened. i thought it might have been a draft that opened the door,
so i put</b>
<br><b>more tape on it. the next morning the door was open again. every
night&nbsp; i</b>
<br><b>would put more tape on the door, but in the morning it would be
open. at one</b>
<br><b>point i had tape all down the side of the door maybe 10 to 15 pieces,
but the</b>
<br><b>door was open in the morning. i told my mom about it but she just
pinned it</b>
<br><b>on the wind, but with that much tape, and all the windows closed,
there was</b>
<br><b>no way. later on i was awaken in the night. i dont know why, i was
in a dead</b>
<br><b>sleep. (im used to that now.) i was laying there trying to get back
to sleep</b>
<br><b>when i heard the sound of the tape being ripped off the door. it
wasnt coming</b>
<br><b>off all at once either, it was one piece at a time. i decided it
would be</b>
<br><b>best to go to sleep as fast as possible. in the morning the door
was wide</b>
<br><b>open.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot more has happened over the years here.
stuff has been moved.(mostly</b>
<br><b>mine) my pets have acted strange. my dog will start barking for
no reason, or</b>
<br><b>start wagging her tail.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on item that is fooled around with is my stereo.
one day me and my friend</b>
<br><b>were sitting in my room when it just shut off. i didnt really notice
it until</b>
<br><b>a few minutes later. i reached down to put the plug back in the
wall</b>
<br><b>(figuring it had fallen out) when we heard three clicks, and it
came back on.</b>
<br><b>that was last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i mostly get feelings
now, like some one is watching. or ill feel like</b>
<br><b>some one is in my room with me. at night ill get an overwhelming
sense of</b>
<br><b>fear when im trying to sleep, so ill put on the cross my mother
gave me, and</b>
<br><b>it will go away. im thinking that ill have to do that tonight. i
dont think</b>
<br><b>that who or whatever it is will hurt me, (it hasnt yet) but its
like i feel</b>
<br><b>what it is feeling.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;i would really appreciate any advice on dealing with this,
if it really is something. thank you in advance.</b>

<br><b>I Miss You Grandma!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bounds@sofnet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>hi, I have had a ghostly experience involving my great- grandmother.
once when I was 6, I'm now 13, I was brushing my teeth after watching a
movie with my mom and dad. I was in the bathroom, when all of a sudden,
I saw my grandma behind</b>
<br><b>me ( she had been dead for&nbsp; 1 year). I turned around but there
was no one there. I bent down to rinse my mouth out, when I heard a voice
that said, " Sweetie, the lights." The voice faded in and out. Then, the
lights went out. My father ran up the stairs with flashlights. I remember
him running up because he is a police officer and he accidentally shined
his police flashlight in my eyes. they took me downstairs and the lights
suddenly came back on. then I heard my grandmother's voice again. This
time it said, " Connor, be ready for the storm. " I sat there on my dad's
lap puzzled. Then, I saw our</b>
<br><b>local weather man come on the T.V. and tell everyone in our county
to seek shelter immediately. Just after he said that, our city tornado
sirens went off. My Mom, Dad, and I got into the bathroom. We had a large
tornado then go down a main</b>
<br><b>street in our city. I feel that my great-grandmother was reaching
out from beyond the grave to protect us. I Miss You Grandma.</b>

<p><b>I Live With A Ghost</b><b></b>

<p><b>Hello my name is Nora and I have been living&nbsp; with&nbsp; a ghost
for about</b>
<br><b>ten years.&nbsp; We call her Mary.She seems&nbsp; to be a young
woman in her</b>
<br><b>thirties or early fourties, she wears a long dress like the kind
from</b>
<br><b>the time around the civil war. She seems to be&nbsp; waiting for
someone to</b>
<br><b>come back,she is so lonely. Mary is mostly active during the cool</b>
<br><b>weather months,she likes to take small items like&nbsp; bread ties,crochet</b>
<br><b>hooks,needle threaders,lighters and on the occasion keys. She also
likes</b>
<br><b>to turn the television off and on.</b>
<br><b>In the beginning I didn't know about her I only new that things
would go</b>
<br><b>missing and I never felt as though I was alone in the house&nbsp;
( I lived</b>
<br><b>alone here for about a year) My sister and nephew came to stay&nbsp;
while I</b>
<br><b>went to Desert Storm, after I came&nbsp; back , my sister told me
about</b>
<br><b>similar incidents . It was after then that we decided to open our

<br><b>to her,and introduce our selves&nbsp; to her , and that is how we
came to</b>

for some</b>

<p><b>My Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Summerd1@prodigy.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hello.&nbsp; my name is Sommer and I have a ghost story to tell.&nbsp;
I feel a little nervous talking about it.&nbsp; Maybe because I am&nbsp;
afriad that what ever it was may find me agian.&nbsp; It started in the
spring of ' 98.&nbsp; At the time I lived in Charlotte, North Carolina,
I have since moved from the house.&nbsp; I never saw a "ghost" but I had
plenty of other things occur over the four month span before I left the
house.&nbsp; One of the first things that happened was a picture in my
sister's room disappeared and then reappeared back on the wall after about
a month.&nbsp; She asked me if I knew where it went to and I was sorry
to say I&nbsp; didnt.&nbsp; I never really thought about it at the time,
well until it reappeared.&nbsp; Some time would pass and nothing happened.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Then it started getting serious.&nbsp; The happenings were
centered in the upstairs part of the house nothing ever happend on the
bottom floor.&nbsp; This was hard for me because only my sister and I&nbsp;
had our bedrooms on the top floor.&nbsp; Soon objects began disappearing
or being destroyed all together.&nbsp; A&nbsp; T.V. even disappeared.&nbsp;
I would come home to find things out of order and or broken.&nbsp; I started
to tell my folks but because things never happened downstairs they didnt
belive me.&nbsp; Only my sister did because the things were happening to
her belongings too.&nbsp; Then I became fearfull of what was happening.&nbsp;
I would hear footsteps of some one coming up the stairs and low voices.&nbsp;
I know the house well and what it sounded like when someone is coming upstairs.&nbsp;
One night my covers were pulled off the bed very slowly as I layed there
and watched.&nbsp; Even my dog know something was happening to the covers
he shot straight out from under the covers and got behind me.&nbsp; That
was the most scary</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;of the incedents.&nbsp; Other times I would hear someone whisper
my name.&nbsp; And my sister said she saw a blue light in the attic window.&nbsp;
A part of the attic only accesiable by a small hole in the ceiling of the
second floor.&nbsp; Soon after that we moved from the house and the state.&nbsp;
Thank goodness.&nbsp; I had lost many a nights sleep from the experience.&nbsp;
They only thing I can think of as to why the stuff started was that a few
years before I had played on the Ouija board numerous times with a friend
and always upstairs.&nbsp; We had to throw the board away because on mean
spirit would always come back and tell us cruel things.&nbsp; But the strange
thing is why did it take three years for the spirit to make itself known?&nbsp;
I can only hope that the people who bought the house are not having any
trouble.&nbsp; They had two young girls who would be taking the upstairs
bedrooms.</b>

<br><b>My Experiences ....SO Far!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: xenacat22@hotmail.com.</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I am a 23 year old that up until recently questioned all my experiences.
When I was younger (9-15) I constantly had night visitors. My bedroom sat
at the top of a 13 step staircase, a number I know well, considering the
times I counted the heavy footsteps that walked them every night. From
the time I moved into that room I felt uneasy, not scared since I was in
some ways curious. Each night I laid in bed I would get the sensation of
excitement and then I noticed that there were slow thudding style creaks
coming from the stairs outside my bedroom door. At first I would call to
my parents only to have them respond from the first floor. I would shrug
it off and fall to sleep. After awhile I would listen more intently and
eventually began counting the footsteps. Thirteen and two on floor outside
my door. It seemed as though it was slowly working it's way towards me
night by night. For the first years it would stop at my room's entrance
and&nbsp; I'd be able to sleep knowing it wasn't coming any closer. That
all changed. One night I listened as usual but, instead of stopping my
visitor decided to join me in my room. There was always a thickness to
the air and distinct deep breaths. I would even stop breathing myself to
make sure it wasn't an echo of my own frightened gasps. I would freeze
until I gathered the courage to turn on the light. It would end long enough
for me to get comfortable then start it's trek up the stairs again. I eventually
began sleeping with the light on. As soon as I was brave enough to try
the dark again it got worse. Not only would the breathing and heaviness
be in the air, but I would hear scurrying on the floor beneath and around
my bed. It made me feel as though there may have been a hundred mice running
in circles around me. I would refuse to even get out of bed for the bathroom.
Nothing ever ended I just grew up and passed it off as a good imagination.
I seemed to be free from it until a few months ago. I've since moved into
a 112yr. old home that once served as a funeral home. In fact it was the</b>
<br><b>first in our county. Late one night I was laying in bed staring
at the wall preparing for sleep. I noticed a fuzzy spot in my vision and
attempted to shake it off. The blurring seemed to float and slowly move
toward a chair that sat in the</b>
<br><b>corner of my room. I watched unable to move or even close my eyes.
I saw everything. I followed this transparent ball of energy ( I guess)
until it turned into an outline of a head and shoulders and sat itself
on my footstool. It glowed an odd blue color, not one you could easily
name. I was terrified and not at the same time. I never felt threatened,but
extremely suprised. I ran to the living room and tried to put it all together.
I could still feel the energy streaming from the hallway as I watched to
see if it would follow me. It didn't and I've yet to see it again. In some
ways I want to, if only I could I could stand my ground and not flee as
if my bed was on fire. Thanks for letting me share this with you. I almost
feel more prepared for the next time someone decides to come and visit.
If you'd like to contact me please do so</b>

<br><b>Mr. Cox</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Eric2.Williams@cibc.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was ten, my family lived in East York Ontario. We moved there
from</b>
<br><b>Jamaica. We owned an electronics shop which had a very large basement
and</b>
<br><b>a second level over the shop which was where our home was. I remember
my</b>
<br><b>parents always talking about the great deal they got on the property.
At</b>
<br><b>the time I was too young to understand what that meant. I have an
older</b>
<br><b>brother and sister. My older brother and sister use to always try
and scare me by</b>
<br><b>saying that the basement of the shop was haunted by an evil ghost.
Our</b>
<br><b>basement was pretty scary for some reason. It was very dark and
had no</b>
<br><b>windows that let in natural light from outside. It was a large basement</b>
<br><b>which had two stairways. One was located at the back of the shop
and the</b>
<br><b>other was at the front. The end&nbsp; which was at the front had
a wall which</b>
<br><b>had three glass windows.&nbsp; Behind the wall were two rooms. One
was the furnace</b>
<br><b>room and the other was just an empty storage room. We never went
inside</b>
<br><b>any of theses rooms alone if we ever did it was together and only
for a quick</b>
<br><b>look. we used to dare each other to go into the rooms alone but
none of us</b>
<br><b>ever did. We also use to stand at one end of the shop on the main
level</b>
<br><b>and dare each other to run down the stairs into the basement and
come back up</b>
<br><b>from the other set of stairs. my brother would sometimes try but
he would</b>
<br><b>usually end up coming back up the same set of stairs he went down.
I had</b>
<br><b>fear when I was younger but I never believed in ghosts. one night
I was</b>
<br><b>playing in my bedroom. the family dog named king was sleeping on
the floor</b>
<br><b>beside me. Suddenly king awoke barking. he got up and systematically</b>
<br><b>barked from one end of the bedroom to the door as if he was barking
at someone</b>
<br><b>visible to him but not to me. I thought that maybe he was dreaming.
I</b>
<br><b>opened the bedroom door to see if maybe anyone was out there but
there wasn't. I</b>
<br><b>followed king to see where he would lead. he walked down the hall
to the</b>
<br><b>stairway leading to the shop and slowly walked down, I followed.
he then</b>
<br><b>walked to the stairway at the front end of the shop leading to the</b>
<br><b>basement and stopped. he just stayed there barking but he would
not go down. I</b>
<br><b>looked but could not see anything. I could tell king wanted to go
down but I</b>
<br><b>could also tell that he was afraid. this made me afraid. king was
a huge</b>
<br><b>Siberian husky that was not afraid of anything. that same night
I told my brother</b>
<br><b>and sister what had happened but they just laughed like it was all
a joke. a</b>
<br><b>few weeks went by and nothing else happened. now I started to wonder
if what</b>
<br><b>my brother and sister said was true. was the basement haunted? one
evening I</b>
<br><b>decide that I would find out. I walked to the stairway at the backend
of</b>
<br><b>the shop and slowly walked down. I remember my heart racing. I was
scared but</b>
<br><b>I had to know. when I got to the basement I remember it being very
cold. I</b>
<br><b>began to walk toward the other end. when I reached about half way
I saw</b>
<br><b>two white figures. the figures looked like they were made of smoke.
this</b>
<br><b>scared the hades out of me and I turned around and ran back toward
the stairs I</b>
<br><b>had come down. to my fright there was a tall dark figure of a man
wearing a</b>
<br><b>hat standing in front of the stairs. the figure had no visible facial</b>
<br><b>features. I started to cry, I tried to scream but I couldn't. I
turned around and</b>
<br><b>ran the other way. the two white figures were still at the other
end but for</b>
<br><b>some reason I kept running the dark figure was far more terrifying
to me.</b>
<br><b>as I got closer to the white figures I was able to make out features.
they</b>
<br><b>were both human. one was a woman and the other was a young boy.
the glass in</b>
<br><b>the wall where they were standing started shaking. the woman and
young boy had</b>
<br><b>a look of fear on there faces. they held each other. I ran up the
stairs at</b>
<br><b>the front end of the shop and then up the stairs leading to the
bedrooms</b>
<br><b>and bolted strait into my parents room. I was hysterical. my parents
asked</b>
<br><b>what was wrong. when I told them they told me that it was just my
imagination</b>
<br><b>playing tricks on me because of what my older brother and sister
kept</b>
<br><b>telling me about the basement being haunted. ever since that day
I never</b>
<br><b>went anywhere near the basement. my parents sold the house about
two years</b>
<br><b>later. during that time I saw nothing else and never really thought
much</b>
<br><b>about what happened. as the years went on I tried to put it out
of my</b>
<br><b>mind. I even began to question whether or not it really happened
until a few</b>
<br><b>years ago. my family got together for the Christmas holidays. we
were all at the</b>
<br><b>dinner table reminiscing about growing up. we were joking around
about the</b>
<br><b>tricks we used to play on each other and the old house with the
shop we</b>
<br><b>used to live in. I remembered that my parents got a great deal on
the house</b>
<br><b>when they bought it. I asked my mother how much they paid for that
house. they</b>
<br><b>paid forty five thousand. I asked why the got it for that price.
she told</b>
<br><b>me that before we moved there the previous owner died in the house.
I asked</b>
<br><b>how and my mother said she didn't know. but the way she answered
seemed like</b>
<br><b>she was hiding something. I didn't press the issue at the time.
but it started</b>
<br><b>bringing back memories of what happened and I just had to find out
how the</b>
<br><b>owner died. I looked up the history of the house at the East York
public</b>

<br><b>Visit When I tell</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cmf6760@netzero.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I worry to tell my story as every time I do I am visited. Not only
by full</b>
<br><b>body goosebumps, but my little girl ghost as well. I would like
to think I</b>
<br><b>am starting to know her. My youngest as well has seen her. She enjoys
music</b>
<br><b>&amp; reading books to my youngest step daughter. She started out
by turning our</b>
<br><b>stereo on in the living room. Then she drop a shelf with my wedding
glasses,</b>
<br><b>a glass plate, a music box &amp; other preciouse items. She did
not come a round</b>
<br><b>for a while after that. I have seen her, my youngest has seen her,
my</b>
<br><b>husband &amp; oldest daughter say they feel her. I think she is
the wife of the</b>
<br><b>man that owned our property. The house was not buit until after
she died. I</b>
<br><b>started to look into it, her death certificate was in our paperwork
for the</b>
<br><b>house &amp; her husbands was not. When I went to the cemetary to
see some dates,</b>
<br><b>I found that her plot was not where it is supposed to be &amp; her
husband died</b>
<br><b>before her. That night I started to see a black shadow around the
house.</b>
<br><b>Once agian I am covered with goosebumps!!! After a few days of telling
my</b>
<br><b>husband of my find, I said I was going to drop it, I felt that the
black</b>
<br><b>shadow was trying to keep me from finding the truth. I am not sure
what to</b>
<br><b>do from this point. I have heard her singing when I go to sleep,
I see her</b>
<br><b>when I open my eyes at night, standing next to me in bed. My children
have</b>
<br><b>come to our room &amp; stood next to our bed looking down on us,
to realize the</b>
<br><b>next day, they have no recolextion of any of it. I am scared that
she is</b>
<br><b>being held some how, yet that she looks over all of us. My husband
feels &amp;</b>
<br><b>felt long before this started that I am a witch &amp; never realized
it. I dream</b>
<br><b>of a black room with a red pentagrm on the floor with red velvet
ropes</b>
<br><b>around it. I went to salem when I was 2. My mother said I was in
such a room</b>
<br><b>at that time. I was in a car accident when I was 15 &amp; lost 99%
of my</b>
<br><b>memories before that time. I am not sure what to do now, or if this
is</b>
<br><b>really happening or just emagnination.</b>

<p><b>House in Ontario</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: sdheih@telusplanet.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I am 40 years old and have many stories to relate of personal experiences
with the supernatural since I was 12.&nbsp; Almost all have occurred in
Canada; one in Montana.&nbsp; The first concerns a house in just outside
the tiny village of Ida, Ontario.&nbsp; In 1972 my family was on vacation
and spent a couple of nights with my father's foster parents in their (then)
150 year old brick farmhouse.&nbsp; The room I slept in was an upstairs
study in the huge two-storey house and I remember being awakened by the
sound of footsteps walking through the room, causing the fine china and
crystal in the room to rattle.&nbsp; I distinctly remember opening my eyes
to see a pair of black shoes or boots and lower pants pass by, with nothing
at all visible above them.&nbsp; I was not afraid that night; only annoyed
because it had been a very long journey that day and I was very tired.&nbsp;
After I awoke in the morning and thought about it over breakfast, I went
upstairs again to check the place out.&nbsp; Whatever was haunting the
place was waiting for me in the upstairs hallway and though I coudn't actually
see it, I could definitely feel it's presence between me and the library.&nbsp;
I stood there for a while trying to decide what to do; I knew for sure
I wasn't going forward but I did not want to back down, either.&nbsp; The
room I had spent the night in had two doors, one of which was adjacent
to me and the other down the hall past the presence.&nbsp; I decided I
would just go around it through the room and get to the library that way.&nbsp;
As I passed through the room there was the usual noise of china rattling
from the many beautiful items on display that were disturbed by my footsteps.&nbsp;
When I re-entered the hall I looked back to where the presence was and
could not feel it there anymore.&nbsp; I found out why moments later as
the sound of footsteps retraced my path through the room I had just exited
and were coming my way.&nbsp; At this point I abandoned my exploration
of the upstairs and bolted down the now empty hallway to the stairs.</b>
<br><b>I got little sleep that night as the presence decided it would be
amusing to walk back and forth past me all night,</b>
<br><b>occassionally stopping to stare (glare?) at me.&nbsp; Just before
we left the next day I asked the owner about the presence upstairs, and
he said that in the fifty-odd years he had lived there, the presence had
always been around.&nbsp; Him and his wife just ignored it as it never
did anything dangerous.&nbsp; He figured it was likely the ghost of the
previous owner who had died ears earlier, shortly before their purchase.&nbsp;
There was no mention of the house being haunted before then.&nbsp; I've
never been back since, and the owners passed away several years ago.&nbsp;
I do not know the current status of the house.</b>

<p><b>My Wifes Fathers Goodbye</b>

<p><b>By: Steven_Harrison@pancanadian.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>In about March of 1996 my future wife was reading in bed in her house</b>
<br><b>around eleven o'clock at night.&nbsp; The kids had gone to bed and
she was</b>
<br><b>not sleepy as she knew her father in Montreal, some 3 thousand miles</b>
<br><b>away, was dying of cancer and she could get a call at any time to
return</b>
<br><b>east for the end.&nbsp; She suddenly looked up and saw her father
pointing at</b>
<br><b>her from across the room, and disappearing quickly thereafter.&nbsp;
Minutes</b>
<br><b>later she received a phone call from her family telling her that
her</b>
<br><b>father had just passed away.&nbsp; She was told that the last thing
he said</b>
<br><b>(to someone) as he slipped away was "that's my daughter over there..."</b><b></b>

<p><b>A Brief Encounter in Las Vegas</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wyndrose@softhome.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My experience took place in July of 1999 at the New York New York
Hotel &amp;</b>
<br><b>Casino in Las Vegas. I'd heard stories of other casinos and hotels
in Las</b>
<br><b>Vegas being haunted but never anything about the NYNY so I was a
bit</b>
<br><b>surprised.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary by spending a night
away</b>
<br><b>from the kids and by seeing the "Lord of the Dance" show at the
NYNY. We</b>
<br><b>were lucky enough to also have gotten a room there for the night.
We had a</b>
<br><b>great night and went to bed around 1:30 am. At 3 am I woke up to
have a</b>
<br><b>cigarette and as I sat up I saw a tall dark figure standing about
a foot</b>
<br><b>away from the end of the bed. I blinked a few times to make sure
I wasn't</b>
<br><b>imagining it, I even rubbed my eyes but it was still there. I could
feel my</b>
<br><b>husband beside me but I looked to make sure anyway. When I realized
it</b>
<br><b>wasn't him I turned to look directly at the figure. It was about
6 feet tall</b>
<br><b>and looked to have the build of a stocky man. I couldn't discern
any</b>
<br><b>features and it didn't move for several seconds. As I stared it
seemed to</b>
<br><b>dissipate, fading away from the head down. Oddly, I wasn't afraid
nor did I</b>
<br><b>feel threatened. I felt a sense of peace from it as though whoever
it was</b>
<br><b>had only our safety and best interests at heart.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I know that I was awake because I was sitting up, my eyes were open
and I</b>
<br><b>could hear my husband snoring away. I've had other experiences in
the past</b>
<br><b>involving hearing footsteps and seeing doors close but this is the
first</b>
<br><b>time I've ever seen a figure. Both of my parents have had experiences
with</b>
<br><b>spirits but I seem to be the only child of theirs that has too.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By the way, the NYNY is a very nice hotel and the show was amazing,
if you</b>
<br><b>get a chance don't miss it!</b><b></b>

<p><b>A Few Weird Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: brenda.carradus@sympatico.ca</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Like many other people's stories that I've read, I've had my share
of</b>
<br><b>experiences with the paranormal. The first time was when I was about
7,</b>
<br><b>I was lying in bed, not quite asleep, I watched a disembodied green
hand</b>
<br><b>with long sharp nails float in through my bedroom door and just
sort of</b>
<br><b>hover there and then it turned around and disappeared. Needless
to say I</b>
<br><b>screamed until my mother came. Another experience that I had was
also</b>
<br><b>when I was little. I&nbsp; lived in an old house, about 50 yrs old
. I would</b>
<br><b>be again lying in bed and I would watch my doll high chair float
and</b>
<br><b>spin, even if there was a doll left in it, the doll wouldn't fall
out. I</b>
<br><b>know it seems strange but when this happens as soon as my mother
would</b>
<br><b>put me to bed and then leave, every night for 2 years. I learned
not to</b>
<br><b>mention it to my mother because she just doesn't believe in this
sort of</b>
<br><b>thing.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Another experience, my dog Cappy had just been hit by a car and died.
I</b>
<br><b>was distraught and couldn't stop crying in bed that night (I was
18). I</b>
<br><b>went to bed that night and I heard his collar faintly jingling as
though</b>
<br><b>he was walking down the hall. All of a sudden I felt something jump
on</b>
<br><b>the end of the bed and could see an indentation as though Cappy
was</b>
<br><b>walking on the bed. It finally stopped and looked like Cappy had
laid</b>
<br><b>down beside me and was saying goodbye. I fell asleep comforted thinking</b>
<br><b>he was with me.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I also have those black apparatitions out of the corner of my eyes
that</b>
<br><b>disappear when you look at them. I freaked out and went to the eye</b>
<br><b>doctor and he didn't seem too concerned but I still have them. They
are</b>
<br><b>unsettling.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Premonitionary dreams are my forte. I feel like Nostradamus. Everything</b>
<br><b>I dream, either happens the next day or a couple of days later.
This is</b>
<br><b>the scariest. Because no matter what happens, I'm powerless to stop
it,</b>
<br><b>even though I know something is happening that I've dreamt about.
I have</b>
<br><b>had too many experiences to recount here or you would never receive</b>
<br><b>this.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have always thought that I was a little different and don't quite
fit</b>
<br><b>in with everyone else that I was growing up with, especially when
I used</b>
<br><b>to describe their auras. I could see people's energies radiating
off</b>
<br><b>them and in such brilliant colours. As I've gotten older I have
to</b>
<br><b>concentrate and sometimes just see a faint glow. When I was little
I</b>
<br><b>thought everybody could see them. But I was wrong.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have one last story to relate to you about my daughter. I really
think</b>
<br><b>that she could be psychic or something. When she was about 2 years
old,</b>
<br><b>I separated from her father. He moved out of our house and into
the</b>
<br><b>basement apartment of his friends townhouse. I should explain that
at 2</b>
<br><b>years old my daughter couldn't speak well because she was tongue
tied,</b>
<br><b>she had too much tissue holding her tongue down and as such couldn't</b>
<br><b>pronounce very many words that involved moving her tongue. When
I used</b>
<br><b>to bring her over to her father's on the weekends she would run
to one</b>
<br><b>particular corner of the room and talk to the corner. She would
call it</b>
<br><b>ghostie and babble to whatever it was for the entire time we were
there.</b>
<br><b>Nothing could drag her away from that corner. Everytime we went
there,</b>
<br><b>this went on. I was getting a little spooked because she would talk
to</b>
<br><b>it, having actual conversations and she would pause and answer</b>
<br><b>questions. This went on for about 4 months. Then she started talking
to</b>
<br><b>"ghostie" at our house. Always in a corner. I was getting really
spooked</b>
<br><b>at this time. After awhile she started running away and screaming
that</b>
<br><b>the ghostie was following her, and I mean she was terrified, screaming</b>
<br><b>and crying all the time. For about a year this "ghostie" followed
her,</b>
<br><b>from her dad's to my house to my mother's and even to school. and
then</b>
<br><b>it stopped. About 5 years later I had found out (after my ex's friends</b>
<br><b>moved out of the townhouse) that a previous owner of the house had
hung</b>
<br><b>himself in that exact basement corner she had started talking to</b>
<br><b>ghostie.</b>
<br><b>Even now, my daughter refuses to talk about it and she's 13. She
can</b>
<br><b>also find an injured animal from a mile away. They gravitate towards</b>
<br><b>her. I have seen rottweillers who attack their owners run up to
her and</b>
<br><b>lay down on their backs waiting for her to rub their stomach. Any
wild</b>
<br><b>animal just lays down in front of her. Very strange.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Anyway I should stop taking up so much space and time. Thanks for</b>
<br><b>listening.</b>

<p><b>My Birds Goodbye!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cmcmillen@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>We were living in Beverly Hills at the time and I was 10 or maybe
9. Anyway, my parents were out buying a car. I'm a bird person and I've
always had one, but he was too loud so I took him to my parents room and
locked him in there. With the door shut and locked, I watched TV until
I was ready to sleep. It was dark and my parents weren't home yet. I walked
into my room, turned on the light, and saw a blue bird singing to the mirror
on the floor. I was freaked, because he didn't have the markings MY bird
had. I went into my parents room to see if he had escaped and my eyes were
playing tricks, but my bird was still there, on the bed, resting. I went
back to my room and there was nothing there. The thing is, it wasn't mine,
no one had one such as mine in the building, and the bird by the mirror
looked exactly like the one that had died 2 years before.</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;I know about 3 ghosts not on your list.One is in the Bristol

some times moves chairs around.I know about it becouse I am a member of
the club.I have never seen him but many others have.Another [actually 2]
are in the mile long railroad tunnel in Terryville or Plymouth,Conn.I know
about these 2 becouse I saw them once.They are the silloettes of 2 men
digging with shovels,and when you get close enough to start making out
detail of them they disappear.I have been in this tunnel about 50 times
when I used to ride a dirt bike but only saw the ghosts once and that time
I was walking.Against your advice I have taken my neice there to look for
them but havn't seen them again.I later found out that 2 men were killed
by a cave in while they were digging the tunnel.I didn't believe in ghosts
until I saw these 2.There was also another ghost in Masssechusettes&nbsp;
in a house on Rt.8 near Colebrook Dam.One time I was driving by,by myself
when a bottle in my car jumped into the air and crashed onto the floor
of my car.This house was later moved and heard stories from others that
the house was haunted,thus</b>
<br><b>being vacant.Also they told me that one or more people were murdered

<p><b>Ghosts In My Life</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lisamayer@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I feel like I've been visited by many ghosts in my life. When I was</b>
<br><b>about four, I slept on the top bunk sharing a bedroom with my brother</b>
<br><b>and sister. I cant even tell you how many times it happened because
it</b>
<br><b>happened a lot. But I would wake up in the middle of the night and
call</b>
<br><b>out for my mom and dad. Instead, usually I would witness a</b>
<br><b>figure...sometimes man, sometimes woman, walk to the edge of my
bed and</b>
<br><b>then disappear. I was never afraid of this. Being a kid, I think
I</b>
<br><b>thought this was just normal. When I got older, it was then that
I</b>
<br><b>realized what I was experiencing. The supernatural.</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was about 20, I lived with a boyfriend in an apartment in
the</b>
<br><b>city real close to six flags over Texas. We moved there during the
night</b>
<br><b>and I spent most the night unpacking. My boyfriend went to work
about</b>
<br><b>6:30 am and after that I decided to finally sleep. I curled up in
my bed</b>
<br><b>and was asleep for about an hour when I drempt of walking through
the</b>
<br><b>apartment and hearing a loud noise, like a storm or something. I
watched</b>
<br><b>as a huge demon rose out of the floor and said in his ugly, demonic</b>
<br><b>voice, "I want you, lisa." I tried to shake myself awake but instead</b>
<br><b>drempt the same scenerio again. When I finally woke up I felt like
I</b>
<br><b>couldn't move. It took several moments until I could regain myself.</b>
<br><b>My sleep was continuously restless there. I usually was by myself
when I</b>
<br><b>had these experiences, but not always. I would here people talking
to</b>
<br><b>me, or hear my boyfriends guitar playing unusual music (the house
was</b>
<br><b>always silent during these times...at least I didnt have any noise</b>
<br><b>going) Sometimes I would hear hot breath on my ear as "it " whispered
to</b>
<br><b>me as I slept. One time during my sleep the bed started shaking
up and</b>
<br><b>down like a scene out of the excorsist.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Several times the television would come on by itself. My brother
and</b>
<br><b>sister stayed with me sometimes and they began to experience the
same</b>
<br><b>kind of things. We would feel "someone was behind us." as we sat
on the</b>
<br><b>couch...and later we began to see apparations. One time a yellowish</b>
<br><b>figure, another time a greyish color. It got to the point where
all of</b>
<br><b>us were getting really scared. I even went to church and talked
with a</b>
<br><b>priest. He told me to anoit the place. So my sister , boyfriend
and I</b>
<br><b>prayed over oil and then decorated the walls in it. Praying as we
went,</b>
<br><b>as if we were in a trance of some kind. After about 15 minutes of
us all</b>
<br><b>walking around praying, we all three automatically went to the front</b>
<br><b>door to "let the spirit out." The ghostly&nbsp; activities diminished
some,</b>
<br><b>but not completely. We moved out shortly after. (we found out at
one</b>
<br><b>point that somebody had committed suicide in our building...Im guessing</b>
<br><b>that was whom the ghost was! )</b><b></b>
<p><b>One of my favorite stories happened in a spooky house my boyfriend</b>
<br><b>(then) and I moved into. The house was so creepy that there was
a door</b>
<br><b>to the right of the garage that had all this junk in it. The room
was</b>
<br><b>huge! But as much as I wanted to explore...I never could...something</b>
<br><b>kept me from it. I believe this place somehow "drew" spirits to
it.</b>
<br><b>It was only a couple weeks after Kirt Cobains death, singer of Nirvana.</b>
<br><b>I was not really much into them but thought that Kirts death was
a</b>
<br><b>stupid, stuipid thing. He had so much going for him...so much! And
it</b>
<br><b>just reminded me how I thought that anyone whom killed themselves
was</b>
<br><b>doomed to "something worse." So I wrote a poem about it in the silence</b>
<br><b>of the night. The boyfriend was asleep and so were the dogs, and
as</b>
<br><b>unusual as it was I didn't even have any rock n roll going. I finished</b>
<br><b>the poem after about fifteen minutes and then read it aloud to myself.</b>
<br><b>As soon as I finished it, I heard three raps coming from what sounded</b>
<br><b>like it was inside the wall. I freaked out and went downstairs near
the</b>
<br><b>"spooky hidden room, with all the junk," and curled up in bed&nbsp;
next to</b>
<br><b>my boyfriend and fell fast asleep. About an hour later I woke up
to</b>
<br><b>hear, "LISA...LISA!" I swear to you to this day it was Kirt Cobain</b>
<br><b>hovering over my head, about four inches from my face...with his
whispy</b>
<br><b>blonde hair and boyish face! I shook my head as if to shake myself
from</b>
<br><b>the image but it never faded! Finally I fell back asleep...even
though I</b>
<br><b>was totally tripped out. Later I told my little brother who went
to high</b>
<br><b>school then, and he was saying that kids in school were saying they
were</b>
<br><b>seeing him too. I dont know if this is true about other people seeing</b>
<br><b>him...but I know I seen him...because I seen him twice after</b>
<br><b>that....basically the same scenerio.I'd wake up to find him hovering</b>
<br><b>over me. I think he was p****d off about my poetry!</b>

<br><b>More Ghosts in my Life</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lisamayer@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;First off...I had a</b>
<br><b>dog I called Noey...she was a true love...so full of life and happiness.</b>
<br><b>But she had this problem with getting out of the back yard, and
I tried</b>
<br><b>everything to keep her from being a bad dog. We lived on a busy
street</b>
<br><b>and it was so busy it was like a highway...and I worried constantly</b>
<br><b>about her. (it was very frustrating). It was about noon time and
I had</b>
<br><b>slept in, when my( x) husband came running in to say Noey had been
hit.</b>
<br><b>A truck working the construction outside had hit her..you could
see it</b>
<br><b>by the tire tracks in our driveway and the blood....We assumed though</b>
<br><b>that she would be alright. Two hours later when I was by myself,
I made</b>
<br><b>a comment to my best friend who was on the phone with me..."Maybe
she'll</b>
<br><b>learn her lesson." Just as I said that she came wandering in my
bedroom</b>
<br><b>wobbling, and then fell to the floor. I screamed in panic. Somehow
she</b>
<br><b>ended back in the living room and I was trying to feed her milk
as I</b>
<br><b>cried, she passed away then. And we took her to the trees behind
our</b>
<br><b>house to bury her. We noticed later that a warn spot in the carpet
had</b>
<br><b>appeared right where she died. But what's better than that is Noeys</b>
<br><b>presence was constantly there. I'd drive up to the house and she'd
be</b>
<br><b>sitting on the porch. Or she was sitting under the table or in the
back</b>
<br><b>yard...I seen her all the time... but as time when on and eventually
we</b>
<br><b>moved, her visits became sparce. But I knew all along what she was</b>
<br><b>telling me...she was telling me it was okay...she loved me. I had</b>
<br><b>carried so much guilt about her death, but she was letting me know
she</b>
<br><b>was just fine.Besides that, I have Noey's son, and I swear my Smokey
is</b>
<br><b>also inhabited spiritually by his Mother! Smokey&nbsp; does the
same EXACT</b>
<br><b>things as Noey once did!</b>
<br><b>The second story is about my grandfather who was a watchmaker and
a very</b>
<br><b>spiritual man, as well. He died about 3:15 on a summers day in June...he</b>
<br><b>was out swimming in the lake that he had swam in constantly since
he was</b>
<br><b>a boy. Meanwhile, my uncle was living in Maine. He had just bought
a</b>
<br><b>pocket watch about 10 days before...a brand new pocketwatch. At
precisly</b>
<br><b>the minute and hour of my Grandfathers death, the watched stopped</b>
<br><b>forever. Remember, my grandpa was a watchmaker! My uncle knew he
had</b>
<br><b>been there to say, "I'm with you all!"</b>

<p><b>Grandmother Wants To Play</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: THEMS1@prodigy.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>When my daughter was about 5 years old she claimed to have seen an
old woman who always wanted to play with her in the middle of the night,
and since we had construction going on the house, she would try to play
peek-a-boo over the wood. This happened and my daughter decided to share
it with me, and of course I just said to pull the covers over her head.
But the woman would continue to bother my daughter and get her to play
around the construction. This began to disturb her. She consulted me again
about it, and I told her to tell the woman that she couldn't play and it
was time to go to bed. My daughter did as she was told and the spirit went
away. About 1 year later, my Aunt gave me a picture of my grandmother.
I showed this picture to my daughter. With a surprised voice she said "
Mom, that's the lady that used to try and play with me at night." I'm not
sure that it was my grandmother, but if it was I hope she knows I still
love her.</b>

<p><b>Hutchinson House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; mrchafin@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This beautiful,old, victorian home is on the corner of Market and
Union Streets across the street from the town's auditorium.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; We lived in this home for 2 years 1983 &amp; 4. We were looking
for a place to rent.&nbsp; I saw this location in the paper. Went to the
house, walked up to the door, knocked, tried the door and it was locked.&nbsp;
Went to the car to tell my son come look through the windows with me.&nbsp;
I tried the door again and it was opened. Almost immediately after we moved
there I began noticing that when I was cooking that I would sit down a
spoon, bowl, etc. turn to the stove or leave the room for and minute return
to my cooking and the item would be gone.&nbsp; I would look around for
a few moments and turn back to the place that I last placed the item and
there it would be!&nbsp; Our two sons, ages 9 &amp; 15 had experiences
in the basement of the house of hearing footsteps walk over to them and
even follow them up the steps.&nbsp; The house was heated by an old fashioned
boiler system.&nbsp; My husband would have to occasionally adjust the water
level that involved turning a certain knob.&nbsp; He would see that knob
turn to the off position.&nbsp; As we continued to live there more and
more things would happen.&nbsp; I always felt these spirits were friendly
and peaceful and glad that we were there b/c we are a very loving and happy
family and enjoyed the house so much.&nbsp; At times I would catch a quick
glimpse of a child or a small man in the dining/kitchen and pantry area.&nbsp;
Guests would often remark of hearing our little daughter (then two) crying
in the night.&nbsp; She slept in our very large bedroom and we knew she
never woke up once all night.&nbsp; I would often hear laughter of a child
other than my own.&nbsp; One morning after</b>
<br><b>I got my family off to school and work I slipped back to bed for
a few extra minutes of sleep b/4 my daughter awoke.&nbsp; 20 -30 mins passed
of sleeping. I awoke and saw a small stature man standing beside my bed.&nbsp;
My first reaction was that it was my son returning for a forgotten school
book.&nbsp; I blinked and soon realized it wasn't him.&nbsp; I closed my
eyes thinking my imagination was going overtime.&nbsp; I opened them and
he still stood there.&nbsp; I could see through him. I just kept looking
at this man.&nbsp; I wasn't afaid at all of him.&nbsp; Finally he faded
away.&nbsp; The last night we were in the house I couldn't sleep at all
and was sitting in my favorite chair watching TV.&nbsp; Around 3:00 a.m.
I got up, went into the kitchen and returned to my chair.&nbsp; There sat
our daughter's favorite teddy bear that she always slept with.&nbsp; I
thought she must be awake looking for me.&nbsp; I went to her bed and she
was sound asleep.&nbsp; I felt this was a way of this little spirit telling
me goodbye.&nbsp; After we moved from the house my husband told our Sunday
School class during a lesson of "good and evil spirits"&nbsp; about his
testing of this and not telling me until that moment.&nbsp; He would place
an item on purpose in a very hard place to find.&nbsp; Return from work
and check and it would be gone.&nbsp; He would look the next day and it
would be back.&nbsp; He also told of times he would wake up and see a mother
holding her child in the doorway of our bedroom.&nbsp; Thinking it was
me and our daughter. He would turn to check on us and we would be beside
him with our little girl in her bed beside us.&nbsp; When our daughter
was about 9 she asked me one day who the little lady was that use to visit
us when she was little.&nbsp; She described in detail a little lady that
would come to the Emporia house and just sit beside her or walk through
the room and wave at her.&nbsp; We vividly recalled her</b>
<br><b>at that age waving and saying, "bye bye little lady".&nbsp; We thought
it was just childhood play.&nbsp; She wrote a paper about it for her English
class and made an A on it.&nbsp; The house has many many rooms we lived
on the main street level and had full access to the basement except for
one room.&nbsp; The owner kept civil war relics in that room and would
occasionally come over and go through those things letting us browse over
them, too.&nbsp; There was an old horse drawn wagon in one room of the
basement and on occasion the seat of that wagon would bounce up and down
for at least 5 minutes.&nbsp; The day we finally moved out I went back
in for one last moment and told our little family goodbye and thank you
for letting us share their earthly domain.&nbsp; I never shared any of
this with the owners or heard of anyone that lived there that experience
anything.&nbsp; I only know that the real estate lady that was in charge
of renting the house said it was very hard to rent and to keep rented.&nbsp;
I wonder if that was why.We are devoted christians and did not nor would
we ever do anything to "conjure" these spirits.&nbsp; I know some christians
feel that it is evil to even believe in such things.&nbsp; But you cannot
deny a personal experience.</b>

<p><b>Haunted Van</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: dignacio@pacbell.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Here is my one and only first person haunting story:</b><b></b>
<p><b>About 6 years ago, my husband bought a 20 year old van at an auction.
We</b>
<br><b>found out that it had been owned by an old man who lived in it,</b>
<br><b>traveling around the country in his retirement. My husband fixed
it up,</b>
<br><b>and he started driving it around. When he drove it, there were no</b>
<br><b>problems. Whenever I drove it, there were always problems. The engine</b>
<br><b>would die (no pun intended) for no reason. I slammed my hand in
the door</b>
<br><b>three times on one errand. My clothes caught in the door, in the
seat</b>
<br><b>belt, even around my arms when I tried to put the key in the ignition.</b>
<br><b>Of course my husband thought I was being silly. None of that stuff</b>
<br><b>happened when he was around.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The only time he witnessed anything was one time on our way to a
camping</b>
<br><b>weekend. We had our two dogs with us, and while we drove, they were</b>
<br><b>sitting on the bed in the back of the van. We stopped at a mini
mart for</b>
<br><b>something to drink. My husband got out of the car, locking the door.
I</b>
<br><b>got into the back to settle the dogs before getting out of the van</b>
<br><b>myself. I heard the engine start again. I turned around, and my
husband</b>
<br><b>was outside, frantically trying to open the locked door. I went
to the</b>
<br><b>drivers' seat, and reached to the ignition turn it off. No key.
Oh,</b>
<br><b>yeah, my husband had it with him outside the door. My husband had</b>
<br><b>trouble getting in, even with the key. So I reach over and open
the</b>
<br><b>door. He slid into the seat, then drops his keys. I don't know why,
but</b>
<br><b>I decided to say something. I said, "You need to stop this right
now! If</b>
<br><b>you keep this up, we will turn around and go home. Then you won't
get to</b>
<br><b>go anywhere, and that's what you want to do, isn't it?" Right then,
the</b>
<br><b>vans' engine stopped.</b><b></b>
<p><b>After that, my husband never again laughed at me when odd things</b>
<br><b>happened in that van. A few years ago, my husband replaced the engine,</b>
<br><b>and we never had any sort of trouble from that van again.</b>

<p><b>Hillbarn and Another</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: susangypsy@email.msn.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I am an actress who works in local theatres in Northern California.
Late</b>
<br><b>last summer I was cast in the neil simon comedy "Biloxi Blues" at
the</b>
<br><b>Hillbarn Theatre in Foster City.&nbsp; One evening, as we were trying
on costumes</b>
<br><b>and showing them to the director, I went upstairs to the costume
room to</b>
<br><b>look for another actor, and had a distinctly uneasy feeling that
I had not</b>
<br><b>noticed in this building beforehand.&nbsp; Something was in the
room, and it</b>
<br><b>wasn't manifesting itself, but the feeling of needing to flee was
palpable.</b>
<br><b>Some weeks later, well into the run of the show, it was my custom
to go out</b>
<br><b>into the back parking lot to smoke since I had such a long wait
between call</b>
<br><b>and my entrance.&nbsp; As i walked from the dressing room area I
had to pass</b>
<br><b>through the set shop to access the back door to the lot.&nbsp; When
I stepped</b>
<br><b>into the set shop, which had a blue light burning and adequate light</b>
<br><b>spilling over from the dressing room area, I saw what I thought
was another</b>
<br><b>actor pass by in front of me, also headed out to the parking lot,
dressed in</b>
<br><b>the same World War Two khakis our actors were costumed in.&nbsp;
This man,</b>
<br><b>however, was not one of the small cast.&nbsp; I said "hello, where
are you</b>
<br><b>going?" and thought that perhaps they had had someone understudy
a role for</b>
<br><b>this one performance, since I was only in one scene myself I would
not</b>
<br><b>necessarily have known a substitution had taken place for a performance.</b>
<br><b>The man did not notice me, and proceeded forward toward the door,
seemingly</b>
<br><b>talking to himself.&nbsp; It was only when he walked straight THROUGH
the door</b>
<br><b>that I realized he was no ordinary member of our cast.&nbsp; I was
intrigued, and</b>
<br><b>followed.&nbsp; The parking lot was empty, and I lit a cigarette
and inhaled.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly the door opened as wide as it would to allow an adult to
walk</b>
<br><b>through, and was pulled shut from inside.&nbsp; No one was there,
the entire cast</b>
<br><b>was onstage and the crew was waiting for set change immediately
backstage.</b>
<br><b>Later that night, I was consumed with a vision as I left the theatre:&nbsp;
fire</b>
<br><b>in the dressing room.&nbsp; It was seen clearly, like a movie.&nbsp;
I blinked, it</b>
<br><b>disappeared, and I was feeling faintly unruffled.</b>
<br><b>The next week, a friend and her husband came to this show, and we
talked in</b>
<br><b>the parking lot until I noticed that everyone else had left.&nbsp;
Suddenly I was</b>
<br><b>filled with a striking desire to leave the area immediately, and
hurried</b>
<br><b>away, as if some terrible event would occur.&nbsp; As a matter of
fact, alone in</b>
<br><b>my dressing room I had the unnerving feeling that I was under constant</b>
<br><b>observation at all times.&nbsp; It wasn't necessarily bothersome,
it was just</b>
<br><b>THERE.</b>
<br><b>Further investigation has turned up that 1) the original founder
of the</b>
<br><b>theatre was in World War Two, and naturally in uniform, but I have
seen his</b>
<br><b>picture and this is not the man I saw, but the theatre was active
during</b>
<br><b>that time, and our show had a World War Two theme,&nbsp; and 2)
the original</b>
<br><b>theatre had burned to the ground, though not at the same location.</b>
<br><b>I don't feel that the man I saw was in the same dimension as I,
and I don't</b>
<br><b>think the man was related to the ominous fire vision , or the watcher
in the</b>
<br><b>dressing room or the evil presence in the costume room and parking
lot.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The second event occured around 1994 in San Mateo County.&nbsp; There
is a</b>
<br><b>locally well-known legend on the Peninsula about a former estate
there.</b>
<br><b>Allegedly a night watchman went insane and murdered two young women
who were</b>
<br><b>prowling around on the property, and tales were told of demons hanging
from</b>
<br><b>the trees.&nbsp; Naturally it seemed worth a look.&nbsp; I went
over there on a Sunday</b>
<br><b>night with my boyfriend, in my car.&nbsp; We drove around and could
not see it,</b>
<br><b>but we were on the original property, we had driven through the
original set</b>
<br><b>of boundary gates on the perimeter, which were clearly marked.&nbsp;
Up and down</b>
<br><b>the subdivisions we went, until we both had a feeling that we should
desist</b>
<br><b>from this excursion.&nbsp; I dropped him off at his car, and he
followed me back</b>
<br><b>to my house in Oakland.&nbsp; On the way back, driving across the
San Mateo</b>
<br><b>Bridge, I had this sudden feeling that there was someone sitting
in the</b>
<br><b>backseat of my car.&nbsp; It was alarmingly strong, it was malevolent,
and I</b>
<br><b>didn't dare turn around, not even to check if my boyfriend was still
behind</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; It got stronger, and the air was heavy.&nbsp; I raced
home, and lept out of</b>
<br><b>my car.&nbsp; My boyfriend pulled up immediately and raced out of
his</b>
<br><b>car.......and he looked terrified.&nbsp; Said he felt that someone
evil had been</b>
<br><b>in the back of his car all the way home.&nbsp; I hadn't said a word
about my</b>
<br><b>drive.&nbsp; We determined to exorcise the cars and we did, there
were no further</b>
<br><b>problems.&nbsp; I won't even name that estate, we made a pact never
to say that</b>
<br><b>name again, but anyone living in San Mateo County will know what
I refer to.</b>

<p><b>Stanley Inn</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jrosales@bwn.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I stayed at the Stanley Inn in Estes Park and my boyfriend
and I slept in the building that isn't the main house, but the one right
next to it.It was like a guesthouse or something.It was its own seperate
building. There is no front desk or anything,when you first enter, just
empty rooms off to your right and left.I recall a library/sitting room
off to your right. And directly in front of you is a staircase.It wasn't
tourist season , so we were very much alone.It was in the late spring Anyway,
you do get an eerie feeling when you go into the library.And the mirrors
on the back walls don't help the atmosphere It's kind of like a victorian,once
upon a time luxury hotel.It reminds me of Titanic.We slept on the second
floor, and in the middle of the night, after I'd consumed alot of vodka(it
was our vacation!),We retired to bed.That night I apparently awoke from
sleep telling my boyfriend very urgently that there was" blood on his shirt".
I have no recollection whatsoever of this? That's the scary thing.My boyfriend
was half asleep and so he just went back to bed, and told me about it in
the morning. He's not scared of anything;he's soo calm!! We had also went
swimming in the pool in the front of the hotel, that night. Don't ask me
what possessed us?the weather was certainly not right for swimming, but
not bitter cold yet , either.We couldn't resist the big ,deep old pool.Very
different from ones today.I was scared then because the lights weren't
sufficient&nbsp; for the pool area and the water looked soo black.I had
to go to the bathroom and the bathrooms had no lights.&nbsp; But I really
had to pee, so my boyfriend stood by the door.I wouldn't recommend the
Stanley unless your in a big group of people. I'ts</b>
<br><b>certainly not cozy, but you can feel the history all around you
when your there. The bathrooms are even pretty, but</b>
<br><b>uncomfortable. The bathtubs are old fashioned and sit on feet.And
the floors very cold.That is my experience, just thought I'd share.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been viewing your site for atleast 2 hours
tonight and finally</b>
<br><b>brought myself to send this.&nbsp; My husband and I just bought
a house in april</b>
<br><b>99, and thats when I noticed somehting wasnt right.&nbsp; We closed
on the house</b>
<br><b>and before we went for our girls we came by the house.&nbsp; We
left open the door</b>
<br><b>fromthe house to our garage and stepped out on to the back patio
leaving that</b>
<br><b>door open also, well the garage door slammed shut!&nbsp; Very,very
hard!&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>husband and i look at eachother and went to investigate, finding
nothing</b>
<br><b>ofcourse.&nbsp; That has happend a few times sincebut, the thing
that gets me is,</b>
<br><b>when we first moved in our neighbor told us the woman we bought
the house</b>
<br><b>from used to hear loud music late at night, every night,but none
of the other</b>
<br><b>people in the houses around our home hear it.&nbsp; I blew it off,
but came to</b>
<br><b>hear it myself every night around 11 pm.&nbsp; I have gone outside,
cant hear it.</b>
<br><b>Its loudest in the master bedroom, but audiable in the rest of the
house.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>always hear unexplained little noises that seem to loud for the
house</b>
<br><b>settling.&nbsp; My youngest daughter, the first night here screamed
the most awful</b>
<br><b>scream, saying there was a man looking at her from the window.&nbsp;
We had to</b>
<br><b>back porsh light and and there was nothing in the window to resemble
someone</b>
<br><b>or somehting.&nbsp; My kids and I avoid the back room, originally
their bedroom</b>
<br><b>and actually We all sleep in the master bedroom due to their fear
and mine.</b>
<br><b>My husband is not at all bothered by this, his childhood home is
very much</b>
<br><b>haunted, next door to a cemetary, also. Since living in this home
our family</b>
<br><b>life has taken a turn for the worst, frequent fights, just general
discord</b>
<br><b>approximately starting the 1st month.&nbsp; My mother says its the
house, she sees</b>
<br><b>the bad luck we've had since being here.&nbsp; My cat came close
to death when we</b>
<br><b>moved here and we took him to my mom's and he bounced back. My health
has</b>
<br><b>gotten so so, I am more moody, as long as I am out I feel fine just
the</b>
<br><b>thought of coming into the house gets me moody and snappy.&nbsp;
I appologize for</b>
<br><b>such a long letter, I tried to make it as short as possible.&nbsp;
I hear the</b>
<br><b>music now, it isnt something you hear like a radio, it's more like
a loud car</b>
<br><b>stereo with alot of base. One more thing, the way the lady had our
alarm</b>
<br><b>installed it covers the windows in the master bed adn the sensor
is right</b>
<br><b>above the hall in front of the door and also a sensor on the garage
door.&nbsp; My</b>

<p><b>My Ghost Story</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: chrisa079@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>The entire paternal side of my family has a history of psychics and</b>
<br><b>hauntings. In my house, where I lived with my grandparents, I was
the</b>
<br><b>focus.&nbsp; Other people in the household had creepy experiences
as well, but</b>
<br><b>it seemed as though most everything occured in my bedroom upstairs.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>started when I was about thirteen or fourteen, as just an almost
tangible</b>
<br><b>feeling of creepiness.&nbsp; Before long, when I would lie down
to sleep, I</b>
<br><b>noticed a glowing greenish spot in one corner of the room, where
there was</b>
<br><b>a doorway to an unused back room.&nbsp; At first I just thought
it was some</b>
<br><b>glow-in-the-dark paint, like I had used to put designs on my walls.&nbsp;
Until</b>
<br><b>it started moving.&nbsp; It started by just getting bigger and smaller,
kind of</b>
<br><b>pulsing, but after a week or so of this, it actually began moving
around on</b>
<br><b>the wall.&nbsp; Then other spots appeared.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Thinking that it might be light coming in from the window, I blocked
the</b>
<br><b>window off, then brought my sister and cousin (who also lived with
us) into</b>
<br><b>the room to see if I was the only one seeing it.&nbsp; I turned
off the lights,</b>
<br><b>and just asked them to look around and tell me if they saw anything.</b>
<br><b>Needless to say, they did.&nbsp; I hadn't told them where I had
been seeing the</b>
<br><b>spots, but they pointed out the exact same spot.&nbsp; Over the
weeks, I had</b>
<br><b>other people come look at it too, to make sure it wasn't a fluke.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>wasn't.&nbsp; I had about fifteen people total point out where they
saw the</b>
<br><b>spots, so I know it wasn't my imagination.&nbsp; It didn't stop
with the spots,</b>
<br><b>though.&nbsp; Soon they started moving around the entire wall, splitting
off and</b>
<br><b>almost dancing around the posters I had up.&nbsp; Then suddenly,
after a couple</b>
<br><b>of months, they disappeared.&nbsp; That's when the REALLY crazy
stuff started</b>
<br><b>happening.</b><b></b>
<p><b>As I mentioned before, my family has a history of psychics.&nbsp;
Though I don't</b>
<br><b>claim anything spectacular, I am a bit clairsentient, like most
of us.</b>
<br><b>Well, my cousin Angie (a different cousin than the one aforementioned)
and</b>
<br><b>I are like amplifiers for each other; we sense things more strongly
when in</b>
<br><b>each other's presence.&nbsp;&nbsp; She used to spend the night quite
frequently,</b>
<br><b>which is when what had been a tolerable presence in my room became</b>
<br><b>unbearable.&nbsp; Dark shadows would be visible in my room at night,
shadows</b>
<br><b>that moved and split off.&nbsp; Initially it would start as a man-shaped
shadow</b>
<br><b>coming out of the corner where the lights had appeared.&nbsp; As
it would</b>
<br><b>approach the bed where Angie and I were, the air became almost suffocating.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;It would get to&nbsp; the footboard, then split off into two
indistinct shapes,</b>
<br><b>slide up the wall where the lights had appeared, and onto the ceiling,</b>
<br><b>where it would join together again above my bed, where the pressure
on our</b>
<br><b>chests would become almost unbearable.&nbsp; At this point, Angie
and I&nbsp; created</b>
<br><b>a psychic bubble of sorts (some of you may know what I'm talking
about),</b>
<br><b>and believe it or not, it was actually visible at one point.&nbsp;
You could</b>
<br><b>actually see the shell around us, almost as a red static.&nbsp;
The spirit would</b>
<br><b>disappear, only to reappear a few minutes later out of the same
corner to</b>
<br><b>start all over again if we hadn't already turned the lights on and
left the</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; There are other witnesses to this phenomenon as well;
I had some</b>
<br><b>creepy-ass slumber parties!&nbsp; Sometimes curious friendly acquaintances
would</b>
<br><b>actually come over to the "batcave" (as my room had been dubbed)
to see if</b>
<br><b>anything would happen.&nbsp; Rarely were they disappointed, though
I won't say</b>
<br><b>that that never happened.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Most everything happened with the lights off, but occasionally things
would</b>
<br><b>occur with the lights on (though always at night), such as poltergiest</b>
<br><b>activity, though this was rare.&nbsp; I remember one time when I
was sixteen or</b>
<br><b>so, I was standing next to my dresser, when a pencil at the end
of the desk</b>
<br><b>next to it flew off and hit me on the shoulder.&nbsp; A few seconds
later, a</b>
<br><b>small jewelry box (one of those little treasure chests) flew off
of the</b>
<br><b>radio it had been sitting on and hit me in the head.&nbsp; I ran
screaming into</b>
<br><b>my sister's room, which was right next to mine, where she told me
I was</b>
<br><b>just imagining it.&nbsp; I told her to walk in there and tell me
she didn't feel</b>
<br><b>anything, and a few seconds later she ran out screaming as well,
saying she</b>
<br><b>had just walked through something that wasn't there.&nbsp; She herself</b>
<br><b>experienced a man-shadow in her room around that time, but that's
a story</b>
<br><b>for another time.</b><b></b>
<p><b>As I mentioned earlier, my room wasn't the only place to be afflicted.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>sister's room, my cousin's room, the bathroom, the laundry room,&nbsp;
the back</b>
<br><b>room next to mine, and the front and side yards all had creepy things</b>
<br><b>taking place there; as well as my aunt's house and two of my cousin's</b>
<br><b>homes.&nbsp; That's not even including the stuff that happened in
the homes that</b>
<br><b>we had moved from.&nbsp; The apartment that I moved into with my
fiance a while</b>
<br><b>back had occurances, as well as the house we just moved into recently.&nbsp;
But</b>
<br><b>the thing that I noticed?&nbsp; Once I became a bible-believing
Christian, and</b>
<br><b>told the spirits to leave in the name of Christ, they did.&nbsp;
Flat out, no</b>
<br><b>more little scare tactics.&nbsp; They just left. Amen.</b>

<p><b>My Ghosts</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: djyow@one.net.au</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I live in a house with my parents and its about 80 - 100 yo. (haven't
got</b>
<br><b>the exact date but we had a flood in the area in 1929 and the house
still</b>
<br><b>bares scars of that). Our house is occupied by ghosts we assume
around three</b>
<br><b>but that is undetermined.&nbsp; The house is built on a reclaimed
swamp, and we</b>
<br><b>put most things down to movement from vehicles but a when somethings
are</b>
<br><b>just to unnatural to be put down to mundane things.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Now as a kid I never really noticed them but I was always scared
of the dark</b>
<br><b>because I thought something was watching me, and I was right, when
I reached</b>
<br><b>puberty one ghost stood out, it was a female unknown age and dressed
in</b>
<br><b>white gown of some type.&nbsp; What happened and still happens with
her is when</b>
<br><b>I'm alone or sitting in bead thinking or reading she calls out,
now the</b>
<br><b>funny thing is that usually when she call out I'm listening to music
through</b>
<br><b>headphones and I can distinctly hear my name between tracks, also
she stands</b>
<br><b>at the foot of my bed watching over me.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The other two mischevious and like to play pranks, both (that we've
seen)</b>
<br><b>are old men and one is chinese we believe as a few years go we placed
a</b>
<br><b>chinese wind chime at the back door to keep spirits away (we checked
the</b>
<br><b>insriptions just to make sure) and some nights a male figure could
be seen</b>
<br><b>standing near the chime but not going any closer.&nbsp; Now both
like to do</b>
<br><b>simple things like move objects open doors and drop plates also
they like</b>
<br><b>making nightime visits and showing there forms and pissing of the
dogs.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Now you might think that these are all in the imagination of a pubesent
male</b>
<br><b>but I'm now 23 and after returning home to study at uni, the visitations</b>
<br><b>reoccured and the 'pranks', well they never stopped after I left.</b>

<p><b>My Ghosty, George</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: AirRsis@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have always been sensitive to the "other side",
although I didn't know</b>
<br><b>what it all meant when I was younger.&nbsp; I would talk to people
who I thought</b>
<br><b>were angels.&nbsp; Most of my family just thought that it was the
common</b>
<br><b>adolescent phase of keeping an imaginary friend.&nbsp; When I turned
fourteen, I</b>
<br><b>proved them wrong.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My dad wasn't home yet from his night shift,
so I was sitting at home</b>
<br><b>alone, playing a computer role playing game.&nbsp; I was fending
for myself in the</b>
<br><b>common teenager fashion.&nbsp; I became aware of the sound of water
running.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>let it go for about ten minutes until I finally got fed up with
it.&nbsp; Thinking</b>
<br><b>it was the game, I turned off the sound on the computer.&nbsp; I
still heard the</b>
<br><b>water.&nbsp; I crawled under the computer and pulled the plug on
the speakers.</b>
<br><b>Still heard water running.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I ran downstairs and shut off the fish
tank bubbles.&nbsp; The fish</b>
<br><b>will survive until I finish the level on my game.&nbsp; Halfway
up the stairs, I</b>
<br><b>still heard the water running!&nbsp; I ran to the bathroom at the
top of the</b>
<br><b>stairs and twisted the cold water knob hard.&nbsp; It had been the
faucet.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>didn't remember turning it on, nor hearing it when my father had
left a few</b>
<br><b>hours before.&nbsp; I shook of the feeling of being watched and
went back to the</b>
<br><b>computer in the bedroom.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I played another few minutes, trying to solve
a puzzle, and heard a</b>
<br><b>squeak and more water sounds.&nbsp; I cursed and spun around in
my chair.</b>
<br><b>Charging across the hall, I yanked the faucet shut again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After several minutes of alternating playing
the game, yanking the</b>
<br><b>faucet, and scratching my head, I figured that the place was haunted.&nbsp;
Was I</b>
<br><b>scared?&nbsp; Heck yes!&nbsp; I ran to my dad's room and cowered
under the covers until</b>
<br><b>my dad came home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, I came to call my resident spirit George.&nbsp;
I have no clue why; I</b>
<br><b>just decided he seemed like a George.&nbsp; As I came into more
contact with</b>
<br><b>George, I began to feel things clearly, even seeing fleeting glances
from the</b>
<br><b>corner of my eyes, or the shadowy outline of a man in front of me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George liked to play games.&nbsp; Caught between
being a full blown teenager</b>
<br><b>and a kid, I decided to play along.&nbsp; Sometimes he would hide
things from me</b>
<br><b>while I wasn't home, then I would find it later sitting on my stereo
or some</b>
<br><b>other obvious place.&nbsp; My father denied taking my things, even
went as far as</b>
<br><b>to say I was taking drugs and hallucinating.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After another of my arguments with my dad about
George, I went home to my</b>
<br><b>mother's house and told her about my day.&nbsp; Her eyes got wide
as she exclaimed</b>
<br><b>"You feel them too?"&nbsp; Apparently, it runs on my mother's side
of the family!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For quite a while, George and I played the hide
and seek game with my</b>
<br><b>things, until I finally gave up and told him it was childish.&nbsp;
Yes, I would</b>
<br><b>talk to him and almost hear him answer back.&nbsp; I would tell
him my entire day</b>
<br><b>as I went about my chores or studied, or at least until I went into
my</b>
<br><b>father's room.&nbsp; For some reason he wouldn't, or couldn't, go
in there.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>bonded (or at least I think we bonded), because he often followed
me to my</b>
<br><b>mother's house.&nbsp; How, I have no clue.&nbsp; I've never heard
of a spirit who's</b>
<br><b>bonded to a place following a living person across town.&nbsp; (If
anyone has</b>
<br><b>heard of such a thing, please share!)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I contacted a psychic friend after finding nothing
on the history of the</b>
<br><b>apartment or its occupants.&nbsp; She told me that George was an
English</b>
<br><b>professor.&nbsp; "He knows he's dead, but when he died, there was
something there,</b>
<br><b>blocking his way into the other side.&nbsp; Your ghosty is afraid
that the thing</b>
<br><b>is still there." she wrote me one day.&nbsp; That was when I started
to leave</b>
<br><b>books on my bed for George to keep occupied while I was at school.&nbsp;
Maybe</b>
<br><b>then he'd leave my stereo settings alone!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often he would be on the stairs or on the top
of the stairs.&nbsp; Sometimes I</b>
<br><b>would feel him by my stereo.&nbsp; Even a few friends thought they
felt someone</b>
<br><b>watching them as they were sitting in the living room.&nbsp; "That's
just my</b>
<br><b>ghost, George.&nbsp; Don't pay attention to him and he'll leave
you alone" I'd</b>
<br><b>tell them when they'd start to shiver.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My dad's moving out of the apartment now.&nbsp;
All of my old things are being</b>
<br><b>packed up and shipped to the next apartment.&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp;
Maybe George'll</b>
<br><b>follow me to the new place, like he did before when I went to my
mother's!</b>

<p><b>My house in Italy</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: harvey@flash.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>In 1994 or 95, I don't remember exactly.&nbsp; I lived in a house
in La</b>
<br><b>madalena, Italy.&nbsp; I was in the U.S. Navy at the time.&nbsp;
I was dating a</b>
<br><b>girl named Shannon from New Jeresy.&nbsp; The House I lived in was
old, I'm</b>
<br><b>not sure how old really but I think it was built around WWII or
sometime</b>
<br><b>after.&nbsp; Many odd things had happened before that were explainable,
but</b>
<br><b>on one particular night something happened that neither I or Shannon</b>
<br><b>could explain.&nbsp; On one of the few nights that Shannon stayed
with me is</b>
<br><b>when it happened.&nbsp; We were in bed, and had been there for quite
a while</b>
<br><b>and I was having a hard time falling asleep.&nbsp; Finally thoagh
it took a</b>
<br><b>while I began to fall asleep,then I started to feel cold, and tingly</b>
<br><b>around my feet.&nbsp; I tried to reach down and pull up the covers,but
I</b>
<br><b>could barely move and the tingling got stronger.&nbsp; I started
to get a</b>
<br><b>little nervous and then tried to open my eyes.&nbsp; I could barely
get them</b>
<br><b>open thoagh (just a crack).&nbsp; Mostly the tingling was around
my feet, but</b>
<br><b>it started to move up my legs.&nbsp; Soon it was around my midsection.&nbsp;
That</b>
<br><b>is when I tried to wake Shannon, But it was still impossible to
move.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>could only shake out of fear.&nbsp; I could'nt even speak when I
tried.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>only noises I could make were very soft groans.&nbsp; By this time
the</b>
<br><b>tingling sensation had covered me almost completely.&nbsp; With
my eyes only</b>
<br><b>cracked open I saw what seemed to be a gray illuminated haze. This
was</b>
<br><b>the straw that broke the camels back, and I passed out.&nbsp; The
next thing</b>
<br><b>I remember was Shannon jumping out of bed.&nbsp; She turned the
bedroom light</b>
<br><b>on, and walked towards the door.&nbsp; I asked her " What's wrong
".&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>said, " Nothing. Leave me Alone!" and went to the kitchen for a
glass of</b>
<br><b>milk.&nbsp; I tried to ask her if she felt the same thing I did
and she just</b>
<br><b>kept saying " don't talk to me!" as thoagh I had done something
wrong.</b>
<br><b>Later that morning on our way to work she apologized and said that
the</b>
<br><b>same thing had happened to her that very same night.&nbsp; Needless
to say</b>
<br><b>but she never stayed there again.&nbsp; She said that there was
obviously a</b>
<br><b>female ghost that lived there, and it had taken a liking to me,
and</b>
<br><b>did'nt much care for her being around.&nbsp; I tried for the longest
time to</b>
<br><b>come up with another more logical explanation, but I could'nt.&nbsp;
It seems</b>
<br><b>to me that maybe Shannon was right. One thing thoagh.&nbsp; If what
Shannon</b>
<br><b>thinks is true, then why did it happen again when I was sleeping</b>
<br><b>alone.</b>

<p><b>My Poor Husband</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Freddiefan68@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I come from a family of woman who reluctantly have certain "gifts"
(for lack</b>
<br><b>of a better word).&nbsp; My mother can tell on the spot the personality
of a</b>
<br><b>person, even if he/she seems to be the most genuine of souls.&nbsp;
Also, if my</b>
<br><b>mother remembers her dreams - watch out!&nbsp; My grandmother is
a very devout</b>
<br><b>Catholic woman who you can surprisingly tell your deepest, darkest
secrets</b>
<br><b>to.&nbsp; She is very open-minded about all things paranormal, and
encourages you</b>
<br><b>to use your gift.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My gift deals with places.&nbsp; I can walk into a place and tell
if something is</b>
<br><b>or was wrong there.&nbsp; When we tried to tell my fiance about
this, he did not</b>
<br><b>believe us.&nbsp; He thought it was all either in our imaginations
or being told</b>
<br><b>to him as a joke.</b><b></b>
<p><b>He decided to turn the tables.&nbsp; He has a friend who is a ghost
hunter, and</b>
<br><b>very open to dealing with spirits.&nbsp; Of course, my new husband
told me nothing</b>
<br><b>of this before he took me to this guy's house.&nbsp; When we left
this house, I</b>
<br><b>was so shaken that my husband got worried.&nbsp; I told him that
the whole time</b>
<br><b>that I was there, I felt a presence that was not good that continually
stared</b>
<br><b>at me.&nbsp; Later, he called his friend.&nbsp; It turns out that
there were actually</b>
<br><b>three spirits at this house.&nbsp; One was of a small girl who was
harmless and</b>
<br><b>whom they had in fact gotten very used to.&nbsp; The other was of
an old man that</b>
<br><b>stayed to the upper floors of the house.&nbsp; Once again, a harmless
sort.&nbsp; Then,</b>
<br><b>he hit us with the "wanderer."&nbsp; This man walked around the
outside of the</b>
<br><b>house, and avoided contact with our "ghost hunter."</b><b></b>
<p><b>Needless to say, I only went back to that house once more and for
a VERY</b>
<br><b>short time.&nbsp; Also, I convinced my doubting Thomas husband of
my "gift."&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>has agreed never to surprise me with a house I have not looked at
first.</b>

<p><b>The Old Lady</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: dyarbrough@cor-tech.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Atlanta, Georgia circa 1981</b><b></b>
<p><b>I graduated from High School in 1981. For the final two years of
that</b>
<br><b>experience, I had the same girlfriend and spent many, many hours
at her</b>
<br><b>house with her and her brother who was a year older. For the longest
time,</b>
<br><b>when I would leave at night (usually much later than I should have)
I would</b>
<br><b>have to walk out of the kitchen door of this typical tri-level house,
down</b>
<br><b>a short path to the garage then through the garage and out to my
car? It</b>
<br><b>always petrified me. I could never explain it nor did I try (why
face the</b>
<br><b>laughter of being afraid of the dark). I spent many times by myself
at the</b>
<br><b>house seeing as it was a second home and many things happened while
I was</b>
<br><b>there?things that could be explained away. The house had the kitchen,</b>
<br><b>living and dining room on the "main" level, upstairs were four bedroom
and</b>
<br><b>downstairs was the den (right below the kitchen) with a bathroom,
laundry</b>
<br><b>room and recreation room off to the side. Candles would fall out
of their</b>
<br><b>holders?often. That can be explained by a number of things. The
house was</b>
<br><b>noisy. But never in the area you were in. If you were downstairs,
the</b>
<br><b>creaks would come from upstairs and if you were upstairs the sounds
came</b>
<br><b>from the laundry room or the rec. room.&nbsp; Many times I felt
chills and cold</b>
<br><b>in the rec. room, but that could just be poor insulation?Finally
after a</b>
<br><b>year and a half, I was at the house one day by myself and walked
from the</b>
<br><b>kitchen into the dining room and stopped cold. Out of the corner
of my eye</b>
<br><b>to the left was an old woman sitting in one of the chairs in the
living</b>
<br><b>room. When I turned my head, she was gone. My heart pounding, I
stepped</b>
<br><b>backwards into the kitchen determined to step back through and see
if it</b>
<br><b>was a trick of the eye that I could duplicate. I took a deep breath
and</b>
<br><b>stepped back through looking straight ahead. She was again but just
for the</b>
<br><b>faintest of second, then gone when my eyes turned. I was stunned.&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>told everybody that night I was not ridiculed, but no one came rushing</b>
<br><b>forward with any stories of there own.</b>
<br><b>Later that month I was there alone at night (yeah, I know)?I was
upstairs</b>
<br><b>and there were creaks coming from downstairs that sounded something
like</b>
<br><b>someone coming up the stairs from the den to the kitchen. The sound
was</b>
<br><b>deeper, not a groan, but not a creak from a wooden stair. I was
on the top</b>
<br><b>level in a bedroom and was almost breathless. The sound continued
up the</b>
<br><b>carpeted stairs, muffled, but definitely there, and definitely the
sound of</b>
<br><b>something large. I pleasantly called out, "Hello?" Nothing, then&nbsp;
after a</b>
<br><b>long silent pause the cat walks around the corner and into the bedroom.
As</b>
<br><b>much as my imagination could have gotten away with me I know, even
now</b>
<br><b>almost 20 years later, that the cat while slightly overweight, could
not</b>
<br><b>have made the sounds. Still I said something to the cat along the
lines of,</b>
<br><b>"Thanks a lot." Then I felt the chill and the cat sat perfectly
in front of</b>
<br><b>me and started meowing?but with no sound?zero!&nbsp; I felt every
hair on my</b>
<br><b>neck stand up as I felt this chill and watched the cat open and
close its</b>
<br><b>mouth like it was meowing, but nothing coming out. I slowly stood
up walked</b>
<br><b>out of the room down the stairs and out the front door? I refused
to go out</b>
<br><b>the back and waited until my girlfriend got home? There was a basketball</b>
<br><b>outside and I dribbled in the dark so when she pulled in I had a
good</b>
<br><b>reason for being outside? Why I hadn't gone into the garage and
turned the</b>
<br><b>light on I couldn't explain. I've never told that story, as you
can imagine</b>
<br><b>why.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;A month or two later my girlfriend was awakened late one night
by some</b>
<br><b>presence, when her eyes opened she plainly saw the dark figure of
a woman</b>
<br><b>in a wide brimmed hat. She called, "Mother?" But her Mother answered
her</b>
<br><b>from her bedroom at the end of the hall. My girlfriend rolled over
and</b>
<br><b>focused, but nothing was there. She said later that she could feel
the</b>
<br><b>presence, more than see it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;A week or so later her brother, home from school awoke to
"feel" something</b>
<br><b>in his room?He refused to roll over or open his eyes. A year later,
home</b>
<br><b>again from school he was sitting in the den watching MTV and the
light</b>
<br><b>clicked on in the laundry room. He didn't remember his mother coming</b>
<br><b>downstairs and it was 2 in the morning anyway?After she did not
respond to</b>
<br><b>his calls, he (like me) slowly got up, went upstairs and crawled
under the</b>
<br><b>covers.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I don't know of any other "happenings" but someone finally
asked the</b>
<br><b>former owners if they ever had an experience in the house and they
said no,</b>
<br><b>"But our Grandmother passed in the upstairs bedroom."</b><b></b>
<p><b>Every bit of this story is true.&nbsp; I will never forget that feeling,
and</b>
<br><b>felt it again while helping my Mother look for a house in Hendersonville,</b>
<br><b>North Carolina?She felt "odd" and decided not to buy?thank goodness</b>

<p><b>Our Guard</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: alveyfamily@worldnet.att.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>We discovered we weren't the only residents to move into our brand-new
house</b>
<br><b>after living there a few weeks.&nbsp; I was taking a photograph
of our house and</b>
<br><b>the camera malfunctioned.&nbsp; The picture of a civil war soldier
briefly</b>
<br><b>appeared in the polaroid picture that half developed.&nbsp; There
were other</b>
<br><b>signs as well...disappearing and reappearing objects, cold spots,
shadowy</b>
<br><b>outlines and electrical equipment working itself.</b>
<br><b>It soon became evident that our spirits had come in a group.&nbsp;
Some where</b>
<br><b>friendly.&nbsp; Some where not.&nbsp; I found a book on clearing
out spirits.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>persisted in clearing out till only one was left.&nbsp; This one
was a soldier.</b>
<br><b>I never was sure which side he was on but I came to depend on him
and the</b>
<br><b>family came to love our guard.</b>
<br><b>As other homes were built around us people would prowl at night.&nbsp;
This was a</b>
<br><b>problem for me because my husband was gone a lot.&nbsp; But we had
our guard.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>would flip on light switches when someone was outside.&nbsp; He
would bang</b>
<br><b>objects around to make noise as well.&nbsp; One morning after a
night of banging</b>
<br><b>and lights switching on we found footprints outside the basement
door.&nbsp; Our</b>
<br><b>neighbors would swear someone was watching out our windows when
we were</b>
<br><b>gone.</b>
<br><b>When the kids were up past their bed time I would feel an icy brush
against</b>
<br><b>my cheek until I would get up and get them back to bed.&nbsp; At
night my son and</b>
<br><b>I could occassionally see a thin white outline pacing up and down
the hall.</b>
<br><b>I would always sleep easier when I saw that.</b>
<br><b>This past year the guard decided to leave.&nbsp; Our house is now
ghost free.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>do miss that one ghost though.&nbsp; He sure helped when I needed
it the most.</b>
