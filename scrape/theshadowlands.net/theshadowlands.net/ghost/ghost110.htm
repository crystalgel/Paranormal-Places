<b>Picacho Peak California</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; angelp@primenet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Picacho Peak is part of the chocolate mountians in southern</b>
<br><b>California in Imperial County. All up and down these rows</b>
<br><b>of mountians there are old gold mine that are not in opperation</b>
<br><b>and some that are still in opperations. At Picacho Peak there</b>
<br><b>was a gold mine that I worked at that has been in opperation</b>
<br><b>off and on for hundreds of years. While working there I experience</b>
<br><b>,along with co-workers, very strange, and I mean strange events!</b>
<br><b>Every thing that we experienced out there happened at night after</b>
<br><b>sunset. One night while walking out on the ora heap both my</b>
<br><b>co-worker and I started to hear a very loud whistling tone</b>
<br><b>which I did not know coming from right behind us. Just think</b>
<br><b>walking on this heap (2 to 3 football field size long) in the</b>
<br><b>middle of the night and hearing this sound coming from right behind</b>
<br><b>you. It scared the holy heck out of us. the bad thing is that</b>
<br><b>were 30 to 40 Miles from the closest town and we were the only</b>
<br><b>people out there at night. There was another time I was working</b>
<br><b>out there by myself when I locked up the Plant up, the building</b>
<br><b>which I was working out of in the mine site, to go check the</b>
<br><b>heap for any busted pipes or any unusal thing happening. when</b>
<br><b>I returned to the Plant I found that the front gate was open</b>
<br><b>and that the water to the fountian was on. the scary thing about</b>
<br><b>that was that I had locked the gate before I left with a master</b>
<br><b>lock and the only key to open it was on my possession.There was</b>
<br><b>another time when me and my co-worker were using the headlight</b>
<br><b>from the company pickup truck to work on a broken pipe on the</b>
<br><b>heap, when we both saw a shadow from one headlight to the other</b>
<br><b>as if someone was walking in front of the truck walk through. As
we turned</b>
<br><b>to see what it was, we saw nothing. Another time on a different
night as I</b>
<br><b>was standing outside the plant by the pickup truck I felt someone</b>
<br><b>tap me on the sholder. when I turned around there was no one there.
My</b>
<br><b>co-worker felt the same thing a couple of hours later. Another night
as we were</b>
<br><b>driving threw the mine site I saw what seemed to be a old time looking</b>
<br><b>miner holding a lantern just staring at up as if he was telling</b>
<br><b>us to get off his claim. The last thing to tell you is that</b>
<br><b>both me and my co-worker experienced this like about 12 times.</b>
<br><b>Every time we would drive through this certain area of the mine</b>
<br><b>we would see this bright light from behind us. This light</b>
<br><b>was so bright that we would be able to see our shadows in front</b>
<br><b>of our truck with the truck highbeams on. The light would be so</b>
<br><b>fast, by the time we would turn around it would be gone.The light</b>
<br><b>would be as if some one was using the flash of a camera. Well</b>
<br><b>there is alot of more storys I can tell you about this mine site</b>
<br><b>but Im going to have to stop. Thank you!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Beaver Township</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; Tammy0304@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Beaver Township,Mahoning County,Ohio-I wanted to let you know about
this</b>
<br><b>cemetery in Mahoning County.&nbsp; It sits right beside the turnpike
in fact</b>
<br><b>some of the graves have had to be moved when the turn pike was constructed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Several friends of mine and I have heard the sound of a small
child crying</b>
<br><b>and screaming in the middle of the night out there.&nbsp; There
are also one</b>
<br><b>grave in particular the has a whole that goes straight to the grave
from</b>
<br><b>the hillside it belonged to a child about 5 years of age.&nbsp;
The tombstones</b>
<br><b>are very old and hard to read but all of them date in the 1800s.&nbsp;
We have</b>
<br><b>also had problems taking photo's in this grave yard both at night
and</b>
<br><b>during the day.&nbsp; Those taken during the day come out way to
dark even</b>
<br><b>though the light meter registered optimum lighting those at night
taken</b>
<br><b>without a flash came out too bright even with a good light meter
reading</b>
<br><b>...We used 3 different manual none computerized SLR cameras and
out of 7</b>
<br><b>rolls taken on 4 different days or nights only 3 pictures came out
....</b>
<br><b>One of which we had to over expose to in the</b>
<br><b>final print to get the picture to develop.&nbsp; This one is the
one that</b>
<br><b>interested me the most and is the reason I refuse to go back to
the</b>
<br><b>cemetery at anytime of day.&nbsp; After Taking the picture and writing
down</b>
<br><b>which tombstone it came from and what my shutter speed and F stop
were as I</b>
<br><b>always do because at the time and currently I am a photography student
at</b>
<br><b>Youngstown State University.&nbsp; I developed the picture having
several</b>
<br><b>difficulties but eventually getting a good print of the negative
The dates</b>
<br><b>read March 4.1893 and death date of Feb. 12 1894 now to any normal
person</b>
<br><b>this would mean nothing but to me this had meaning the date I was
born</b>
<br><b>(excluding the year appeared as the birthrate and the death date
(excluding</b>
<br><b>the year) was my fathers date of death ......Noticing this and not</b>
<br><b>remembering realizing this before I checked my notes.&nbsp; My notes
read May</b>
<br><b>15, 1856, and Death July 28, 1896.&nbsp; I went back to check the
stones to see if</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I made a mistake and wrote down the wrong info or</b>
<br><b>wrote down the info off the wrong stone.&nbsp; Much to my dismay
not only were</b>
<br><b>my notes correct on the tombstone I wrote down about but no other
tombstone</b>
<br><b>in the graveyard had the dates in the picture.&nbsp; The exact location
of this</b>
<br><b>graveyard is in Beaver Township on Rt. 7 if you are heading south
from</b>
<br><b>western reserve rd it will be on your right in the woods near the
turnpike.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;There is a small field between the road and the woods the
graveyard is</b>
<br><b>visible from the road there is no parking area and I had always
parked at a</b>
<br><b>closed down restaurant called the Stagecoach it is just before the
cemetery</b>
<br><b>and also is on the right.&nbsp; You do require permission from the
owners of the</b>
<br><b>graveyard to be there without hassled from the local police.&nbsp;
Most of the</b>
<br><b>time they just want to know what you are doing especially if you
visit it</b>
<br><b>at night.&nbsp; I was unable to locate the owners due to limited
research time</b>
<br><b>about the place. But I do know it is privately owned but I am not
sure by who.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Zech Road</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; WWAX@AOL.COM</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Bill.&nbsp; I am 20 years old and from Miamisburg Ohio.
While searching for information on</b>
<br><b>Sleepy Hollow I found this page with the story about Zech road.&nbsp;
I flipped out about this because</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Zech road dead ends on the west end into woods and the east
into Union road where I live.&nbsp; One</b>
<br><b>time when I was about 18 or 19 me and a group of friends had a party
for a friend of mine who was</b>
<br><b>joining the Navy. We got a little drunk and decided to walk down
Zech road to the house of a girl</b>
<br><b>we knew Zech road is nothing but woods and fields until you get
to the west end where there are</b>
<br><b>about six houses.&nbsp; Half way down the road my friend Drew and
I heard laughter and felt like we</b>
<br><b>were being watched.&nbsp; We ran back towards my house, we got to
Union road and headed south towards</b>
<br><b>my house we passed a little old church called the Ark.&nbsp; we
stopped at a farm in between the</b>
<br><b>churchs graveyard and my house.&nbsp; We were standing on the driveway
to the farm which is lined</b>
<br><b>with trees and talking to each other.&nbsp; It was about three in
the morning and there are no lights</b>
<br><b>out in the country where I live I knew someone was standing beside
me and assumed it was Drew.</b>
<br><b>We were talking about what had just happened when I got the strange
feeling that the person one</b>
<br><b>tree down from me wasn't Drew.&nbsp; Drew must have gotten the same
feeling because we both turned</b>
<br><b>towards each other there was one tree inbetween the tree I was under
and the one Drew was under.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; What I saw scared the #### out of me.&nbsp; It looked like
a man in mechanics coveralls or something</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;of that nature he was completly black I couldnt make out much
because of the lack of light but I</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;know he was wearing a hat and had a beard.&nbsp; Drew says
that he was smoking a cigar.&nbsp; I dont know</b>
<br><b>for sure but he might have been. Where we were standing there was
no way for him to have snuck up</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;without us seeing. drew was on one side facing my house and
I on the other facing Zech road.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;also know that when I first got there he wasnt there because
I had glanced over as Drew came</b>
<br><b>running up behind me.&nbsp; We didn't say anthing to him we just
took off in a dead run for my barn.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I know every neighbor I have from Farmington to lower Maimisburg
Road and I know he wasnt</b>
<br><b>anyone who I had ever met before.&nbsp; The Johnsons, the owners
of the farm where we had stopped</b>
<br><b>running, are friends of my fathers and none of them wear a beard.&nbsp;
The only neigbor I had that</b>
<br><b>ever had a beard was Mr. Brewer and he died, but this man didn't
have his build anyways.&nbsp; I don't</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;know who or what was in between me but I spoke to all my neigbors
and no one knew either from</b>
<br><b>the description I gave.&nbsp; Mr. Lee who is 73 and has lived here
longer than anyone else I know said</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;that zech road was haunted but untill finding this page I
had never heard anything more about it</b>
<br><b>.&nbsp; I don't personally believe in ghosts all that much but I
know what happened to me and I know</b>
<br><b>it was very real.&nbsp; It may not seam that scary but let it happen
to you.&nbsp; I don't care much if you</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;print this or not I would just like to hear your take on it.</b>

<br><b>Park Place</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jtomblin@mail.nctimes.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>On Manhattan's Central Park South stands the Helmsley Park Place
Hotel,</b>
<br><b>one of several (including the Empire State Building) structures
in the</b>
<br><b>"Big Apple" owned by Leona Helmsley.</b><b></b>
<p><b>On my first visit to New York with a close friend of mine, we were
awed</b>
<br><b>like a couple of gomers by the overwhelming size of the city, a</b>
<br><b>consolidation of massive memorials to the entrepreneurial egos that</b>
<br><b>created it, and continue to do so.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Upon checking in to Park Place we settled into our room on the 37th</b>
<br><b>floor with a view overlooking easterly Manhattan and environs, where</b>
<br><b>countless skyscrapers disappear into the horizon.&nbsp; While unpacking,
we</b>
<br><b>heard at least three children running down the hallway, laughing,</b>
<br><b>yelling and slamming the door, several times, to the room at the
end of</b>
<br><b>the hall (located immediately next to ours), after which it would
become</b>
<br><b>very quiet (which was fine with us).&nbsp; We both knew the parents
must</b>
<br><b>really have their collective hands full with those kids with them
on</b>
<br><b>vacation.</b><b></b>
<p><b>We left the room to see the sites of the city, staying out well into
the</b>
<br><b>night.&nbsp; We returned to our room sometime after midnight, and
exhausted</b>
<br><b>from our excursions, and fell into a sound sleep.&nbsp; Until we
again heard</b>
<br><b>the children next door again running down the hall and into their
room,</b>
<br><b>slamming the door.&nbsp; "What are they doing up running around
at this</b>
<br><b>hour?" we asked ourselves, then drifted back to sleep.</b>
<br><b>&lt;BR></b>
<br><b>The next morning we continued our self-guided tour of Manhattan,
Park</b>
<br><b>Avenue, and Central Park, and ignoring advice we received from others</b>
<br><b>before our trip (it's dangerous!), went on the subway to travel
down to</b>
<br><b>see the Statue of Liberty.&nbsp; On the way back, we changed trains
- or at</b>
<br><b>least one of us did - I stepped out just before the subway doors
closed,</b>
<br><b>and like a comedy bit I've seen in more than one movie, was left
at the</b>
<br><b>platform while my friend sped off in the train.</b><b></b>
<p><b>While I was making my way back to meet her at the hotel, my friend
had</b>
<br><b>already gotten back, waiting for my return.&nbsp; And again, she
heard the</b>
<br><b>noisy kids running down the hall and slamming the door.&nbsp; In
no mood to</b>
<br><b>hear any more of this, she phoned the hotel desk,&nbsp; and a security</b>
<br><b>officer shortly appeared at her door, and she told him of the noisy</b>
<br><b>neighbors.&nbsp; He knocked on the door in question as well as the
door</b>
<br><b>directly across from us, with no response from either.&nbsp; He
used his pass</b>
<br><b>key and found no children anywhere; both rooms were empty.&nbsp;
He came back</b>
<br><b>to our room and told my friend that no one was there, and that he
had</b>
<br><b>been informed by the front desk that no children had been checked
in</b>
<br><b>anywhere on that floor.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I finally arrived back at the hotel, and she told me of what had</b>
<br><b>happened regarding the kids in the hall while I was making my way
back,</b>
<br><b>and halfway jokingly suggested that they must be ghosts.&nbsp; Later,
we went</b>
<br><b>out for dinner, had a few drinks and a good stogie at a cigar bar
(where</b>
<br><b>we saw the Mayor, who dropped by with several men in trench coats),
then</b>
<br><b>went back to our room, again ready for a good nights sleep.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Around 2:30 am we were both awakened by an eerie sound neither of
us had</b>
<br><b>ever heard before in our lives.&nbsp; It was that of an elderly
man, making a</b>
<br><b>noise not quite a groan or a moan, in short staccatos; something
weird,</b>
<br><b>almost inhuman, as though his jaw was wired shut, maybe being tortured,</b>
<br><b>maybe trying to say something, but nonetheless a sound that literally</b>
<br><b>make the hair on the back of my neck stick out, and chills run down
my</b>
<br><b>spine.&nbsp; It was indescribable, seemingly emanating from the
area near or</b>
<br><b>in the bathroom, from within the walls.&nbsp; It continued on, almost
like a</b>
<br><b>tape loop, going on and on.&nbsp; I just wanted it to stop.&nbsp;
My friend, a</b>
<br><b>caregiver for almost thirty years, has cared for elderly patients
with</b>
<br><b>many different types of conditions - yet she'd never heard anything
like</b>
<br><b>this.</b>
<br><b>After this little episode there was no doubt in either of our minds
that</b>
<br><b>this place was haunted.&nbsp; And downright creepy.&nbsp; Our vacation
was drawing</b>
<br><b>to a close the following day, and while there's more of this Great</b>
<br><b>Grandparent of all American cities we intend to visit, we'll be
lodging</b>
<br><b>elsewhere, thank you.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Little People in my Room</b><b></b>
<p><b>By;&nbsp; shekinah65@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I about fell off my chair when I read your story. It brought back</b>
<br><b>memories I would rather forget. I have never told this to anyone
other</b>
<br><b>then my mom,who I use to wake up nitely because I was so scared
of these</b>
<br><b>things, she said I was dreaming and to sleep with her. After reading</b>
<br><b>your story I am sure I wasn't dreaming. MY experiences were a little</b>
<br><b>diffrent.I was around 7 yeas old when this happened, at that age
I</b>
<br><b>didn't know how to describe to my mom what it looked like and I
told her</b>
<br><b>it was like little bears. I remember the clothing the best, robes
with</b>
<br><b>long wide sleeves and floppy hats that were long and hung down on</b>
<br><b>shoulder and the front of the hat covered part of the face. I don't
know</b>
<br><b>if the face resembled an animal or what because I don't remember
it now.</b>
<br><b>What I don't forget is the fear and the mental image of not one
but many</b>
<br><b>of these things surrounding my bed, their haeds could hardly see
over</b>
<br><b>the mattress and they had tools of some sort in their hands. I felt
like</b>
<br><b>if I moved or tried to get out of bed they would hack me up. As
an adult</b>
<br><b>now, this is the part that scares me most,I slept in an upstairs
bedroom</b>
<br><b>and these things would somehow make me think if I stood at the top
of</b>
<br><b>the stairs and steped off I could float to the bottom,I couldn't
tell</b>
<br><b>you the number of times I stood there thinking about trying it.
They</b>
<br><b>never spoke to me, it was just like ideas or knowledge would pop
in my</b>
<br><b>head. At this same time our neighbor died and I got the idea from
these</b>
<br><b>little pests that I could go with Sam if I jumped out my wndow,
so here</b>
<br><b>I was sitting in my upstairs window and ready to jump when somehow
my</b>
<br><b>mom showed up and pulled me out just in time.I don't remember seeing</b>
<br><b>these things come or go and I don't remember when it stopped but
when I</b>
<br><b>was a teenager I decided to sleep upstairs and I would be ready
for the</b>
<br><b>little devils now that I was older,but nothing happened. I honestly</b>
<br><b>think they were trying to kill me. Although my parents are now divorced</b>
<br><b>my dad still lives in the house and everyone there complains of
seeing</b>
<br><b>what I call shadow men, but as far as I know no one has seen these</b>
<br><b>little men again. I would never tell anyone this if it were not
for the</b>
<br><b>fact that my mom knows what I told her as a child and she saved
me from</b>
<br><b>that window. I would appreciate it if you know of anything like
this</b>
<br><b>happening to anyone else to please let me know. I know it happened</b>
<br><b>because I sit up in my bed wide awake and terrified many nites and
with</b>
<br><b>all the kids killing kids these days, could it be possable that
there is</b>
<br><b>an evil force behind some of it. It seams like these little pests
focus</b>
<br><b>on children,have any adults ever seen them? If you don't think I
am</b>
<br><b>looney or have a wild imagination feel free to print this, maybe
it</b>
<br><b>could bring peace of mind to someone as your story did for me.</b>

<br><b>My Little Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; kannibis@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>First off, I'd like to say that my story is absolutely true as far
as I</b>
<br><b>am concerned.&nbsp; There is no doubt in my mind as to whether or
not I saw</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; What it was, I do not know and can only speculate.</b>
<br><b>I am a big fan of railroads and such and several years ago, it was
my</b>
<br><b>hobby to frequent the railroad tracks near my house to watch the
trains</b>
<br><b>go by.&nbsp; Where I live, (Somerville, MA) most of the freight
trains come</b>
<br><b>through in the early morning hours of 1am to 6am.&nbsp; One particular
night,</b>
<br><b>I was walking the tracks alone trying to kill the time before the
nest</b>
<br><b>train would pass.</b>
<br><b>I had just passed under the Central St bridge and was approaching
the</b>
<br><b>School St bridge when I turned to look back over my shoulder.&nbsp;
It was</b>
<br><b>then that I saw something under the Central St bridge, about 50
yards</b>
<br><b>behind me.&nbsp; I wanted to dismiss it as nothing but as I stared
at it, it</b>
<br><b>would simply not disappear.&nbsp; Very nervous now, I approached
a little bit</b>
<br><b>closer to have a better look.</b>
<br><b>When I did this, I saw a glowing shape approximately the size of
a</b>
<br><b>person, transparent and floating above the ground next to the train</b>
<br><b>tracks.&nbsp; I had no idea what to make of this, but I should say
that it</b>
<br><b>sufficiently scared me so that I would not approach any further
and I</b>
<br><b>quickly exited the area.&nbsp; About an hour later, I returned to
the site</b>
<br><b>and there was nothing to be seen and no evidence of what I did see.</b>
<br><b>Now I have always believed that most stories about ghosts are made
up or</b>
<br><b>are tricks of the mind.&nbsp; All of my logic cannot exlain to me
what I saw,</b>
<br><b>and has me convinced enough that I have decided to look into this</b>
<br><b>further.&nbsp; If I do find anything new, I will be certain to write
back.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>want to know what I saw more than anyone.</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;The Swirling Mist</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>This event took place in the mid 1970s in the San Fernando Valley,</b>
<br><b>California. One night my friend and I were visiting my sister. The
area</b>
<br><b>where she lived in was semi-rural with horse ranches and citrus</b>
<br><b>orchards.</b>
<br><b>To get to her house, you had to drive up a winding road for about
a mile</b>
<br><b>and a half. her house sat on a ridge that overlooked the San Fernando</b>
<br><b>Valley - at night the lights of the valley were beautiful from her</b>
<br><b>house.</b>
<br><b>On this particular evening we had turned out of her property and
onto</b>
<br><b>the</b>
<br><b>road. When we rounded the first bend my headlights illuminated a
rapidly</b>
<br><b>swirling white mist-fog in the middle of the road. It was about
the size</b>
<br><b>of an average person, but there was no real discernible shape to
it - it</b>
<br><b>just swirled around into itself very radiply. as we approached it
I</b>
<br><b>slowed down and it moved straight up in the air off of the road.
I actually</b>
<br><b>drove under it and stopped a short distance away. my friend and
I looked at</b>
<br><b>each other in astonishment; we had both seen the swirling mist and
had no</b>
<br><b>idea what it was. Simultaneously, we turned around and looked through
the</b>
<br><b>back window of my car, and the swirling mist moved back to the road
and</b>
<br><b>continued to swirl rapidly. My friend and I were somewhat shaken
and, or course,</b>
<br><b>leftthe area immediately. I have to add that it was a warm summer
evening,</b>
<br><b>with clear skies or no wind - nor was there a manhole or any other
man made</b>
<br><b>object in the immediate area that would have produced this event.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Several years later I was visiting another friend who lived on the
same</b>
<br><b>road as my sister. he lived across the street on the next ridge.
We were</b>
<br><b>in his front yard talking and he pointed to the house directly across</b>
<br><b>the street from his house. He told me that the house was haunted;
a person</b>
<br><b>had committed suicide in the garage several years bofore. the house
was</b>
<br><b>eventually sold and the new owners began experiencing strange events</b>
<br><b>with their phones, house lights, strange voices, and foot steps.
He told me</b>
<br><b>that one night a teen age boy who lived in the haunted house came
to his</b>
<br><b>house terrified and asked for help because he was hearing footsteps
on the</b>
<br><b>second floor and the telephone was ringing constantly, and even
continued to</b>
<br><b>ring after he picked up the receiver. The boy was alone in the house
as his</b>
<br><b>parents were out to dinner. the swirling mist that my friend and
i saw</b>
<br><b>that night ten years before was directly in front of the house my
friend was</b>
<br><b>talking about! I had never told anybody about my previous experience,</b>
<br><b>but when my friend told me about the haunted house I just had to
tell him</b>
<br><b>about the swirling mist. I showed him the very spot where it occurred.
This</b>
<br><b>bothamazed my friend and helped to explain what my friend and I
saw that</b>
<br><b>night ten years before.</b>

<p><b>THE LADY</b><b></b>

( I had it</b>

bed in a</b>
<br><b>long cream colored dress.&nbsp; I rubbed my eyes to make sure I
was seeing what I</b>
<br><b>thought I was seeing and the lady was gone.&nbsp; Sense then I have
had my light,</b>
<br><b>and only the lights in my room turn on and off.&nbsp; The lamp shade
to my lamp</b>
<br><b>has acutely started swing back and forth, then all the sound in
mid-swing</b>
<br><b>stop and return to it's normal position.&nbsp; I have also had my
windows rattle,</b>
<br><b>and asked my family members if the saw'll or felt that and they
said no.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>have had my refrigerator spit ice cubes out at me also.&nbsp; I
believe we have a</b>
<br><b>sprit living with us.&nbsp; Sadly we moved three weeks ago, and
haven't seen</b>
<br><b>anything since</b>
