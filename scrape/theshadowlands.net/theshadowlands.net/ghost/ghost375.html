<p class="MsoNormal">#1When I was 6 or 7 my dog Lilly and I were playing in my
living room.We have a play room connected to the living room(just so you
know.).That was when I looked toxards the playroom door(which is clear
glass)and saw what I thought to be my Papa Frank who had died the Christmas
before standing at the door,at the same time Lilly barked annd barked at the
playroom door as if someone was there.I really think it wasn't a someone it was
a ghost!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">#2(My house is built on a battlefeild of the Revolutionary
War)It was a Friday night in the middle of summer and I woke up because it had
suddenly become very cold and the A/C was of so I went into my mom's romm where
it was always a little bit on the warm side and went to sleep.I woke up an hour
later because it had gotton really,really cold even though the A/C was of still
and saw a noticable yet hard to see a light in the corner that then took form
of a man wearing a war uniform.I did everything I could do to make sure I
wasn;t sleeping,I wasn't!After what seemed to be an hour and was really five
minites I got out of my mom's bed because I was scared.It suddenly
disapeared!!!!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">An Old House In Athens, Louisiana (revised)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: ZEPPULON@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There is an old house in <st1:place><st1:City>Athens</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Louisiana</st1:State></st1:place> that was built in the late
1800's. My father bought the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>two story
wood frame house for around three thousand dollars. It sits on about 2.25 acres
of land. This was my childhood home.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I became a teenager strange occurrences began to
happen.The windows in my room would be closed but later would be open and the
wind would whip the curtains but the trees outside would be still. These were
old heavy windows that you had to really put out an effort to raise them, and
then after you raised them you would have to prop a sawed off broom handle to
keep them open. I have had my sheets tugged off of the bed and land on the
floor.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In the summer time when everyone was away you could stand
outside and hear music and laughter inside the house as if there was a party
going on. I have had many strange occurrences happen while I lived there that I
won't go into. It was an old house and old houses make noises.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Several years later my wife and I was visiting my parents
one cold winter day. I decided to go to the large room and play an old smoked
up piano that I salvaged from a house that was partially burned. I was playing
a haunting melody that just came to me when I felt what I thought was my wife
leaning on my right shoulder, I smiled and turned to great her...but there was
no one there. I immediately left the room and joined my Father and wife in the
living room but didn't say what had happened. Then suddenly the room was filled
with the overwhelming scent of fresh cut Roses, so strong it was almost
nauseating, this was the dead of winter. We all smelt it and I asked my Dad did
he spray any kind of air freshener. He said no so we looked around and couldn't
find anything then as sudden as the fragrance came ....it left.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Several years later after my parents were deceased I went to
the property to gather pecans. While I was there I heard a loud noise like
furniture was being moved across the floor, I came closer to the house and
heard it again, I left the premises immediately!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Christine (my ghost story)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About two years ago, my family and I had our first
experience with our ghost when one night, my older brother got up to go to the
bathroom. While he was in there, he heard a scratching noise coming from behind
the shower curtain. It got louder and faster as it continued, and he ran out of
the bathroom and into my room with his trousers around his ankles. He called
for me to come into the bathroom. Drowsily, I got up and we started down the
hallway. We never did enter the bathroom, because we were both much too freaked
out when a shampoo bottle came hurtling out of the bathroom door, hitting the
wall opposite it, and rolling down the hallway. I slept in his room that night.
After that, we had many encounters with the ghost that we began to call
"Christine" after the famous Stephen King novel. Though I personally
never witnessed her, both of my parents and my friend did. My mom was the first.
One night, my friend Midge and I were asleep on the living room floor, when the
alarm on Midge's cell phone went off at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="3">3
 AM</st1:time>. It didn't wake up Midge or I, but my mom got up and came out
into the living room to turn it off. She saw who she thought was me standing in
the hallway on the other side of the room, but she ignored "me" to
retrieve the phone and silence it. That's when she noticed that I was asleep on
the floor beside Midge. Scared, she went back to bed. Later that night, Midge
woke me up crying, and insisted that I had just shaken her awake, then ran into
the kitchen. But when she looked over, I was asleep next to her. Several weeks
later, my dad was pulling into the driveway late one night and thought he saw
me sitting on the couch, pulling back the blinds and staring out the window. As
he pulled close to the house, "I" put the curtains back and got off
the couch. But when he came into the house, he discovered that I wasn't even
home.. I was spending the night with a friend. In between these experiences,
eerie things occured around our house. The silverware drawer would fly open and
slam shut, doors would open, close, and lock by themselves, lights would turn
on and off. Then, a very strange event ocured when I made a collage on my wall
of pictures of my friends. I had about 200 or so pictures completely covering
one of my walls, which took me a very long time to do. I went to bed, and awoke
the next morning to find that every lastpicture containing Midge had been taken
off the wall and was in a pile across the room with all the other pictures.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I lived (part-time, if that makes sense) with my dad in <st1:place><st1:City>Whitmore
  Lake</st1:City>, <st1:State>Michigan</st1:State></st1:place> before he commit
suicide last year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night, it was
about <st1:time minute="0" hour="2">2 A.M.</st1:time> my dad was out somewhere
and my brother and sister were asleep in the other room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sitting at the computer, talking to my
friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out of the corner of my eye I
saw something "peeking" around the corner of the room I was in at
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Usually this happens a lot to me and
then when I look at it, it disappears.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Frightened, I turned slowly to look at it and it stayed there, staring
at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to puke...it was
extremely tall (maybe 7 or 8 ft. tall) had long, boney fingers and long, sharp
nails.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had long, gray hair and its
face wasn't that of a persons, but looked decayed or like a monster.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got very scared and after about 3 or 4
minutes (which it seemed longer) it slowly backed away from the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told the people I was talking to on the
computer what was happening but for some reason I was too scared to get up to
call my dad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran upstairs and when I
turned the corner to go up the stairs I saw it again standing at the top of the
steps. I'm a huge scaredy cat so I was freaking out and I had tears in my
eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran up the steps with my eyes
closed and ran into my room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned on
my light and checked in the closet and under my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I slammed my door and locked i and layed
in my bed until I fell asleep. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The next
day I woke up and went downstairs and saw my dad in the kitchen. I told him
about the previous night and before I described what the creature looked like,
he already knew. He told me that he saw it all the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told me to just ignore it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My dad was definitely not a religious person
so it bothered me that he was ok with this crazy thing just staring at me (or
anybody).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this day that was the
scariest thing that has ever happened to me. I don't like to tell too many
people because they just look at me like I'm crazy....and now I wonder if the
thing had any connection to my dad and his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About a year later he got heavily into drugs
and was going down hill and even after he lost his huge house on the lake that
he spent his time and money and energy building, he still wouldn't leave the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He lived in between his house and
the neighbors house in his camper. In July 2004, my dad hung himself from the
tree in our old yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It makes me want
to go back and investigate.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thats my
story...Ashley.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Today (<st1:date year="2005" day="6" month="11">11/06/05</st1:date>)
marks the two year anniversary of my husband's Liver Transplant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to that date, we had been living in
northeast <st1:country-region><st1:place>Georgia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were notified by my company that, if we
had the procedure done at Mayo Clinic, it would be completely paid for,
including traveling and living expenses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We chose the Mayo Clinic in <st1:place><st1:City>Jacksonville</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Florida</st1:State></st1:place> and<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>went down there in August for the two week evaluation process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mayo Clinic approved Chuck's transplant and
told us to move down there by the end of September.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once we moved, they had to do a few more
tests before putting him on the UNOS (United Network for Organ Sharing)
list.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We received a letter stating that
Mayo had added his name to the list on October 25th.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 1st at approximately <st1:time minute="0" hour="3">3:00am</st1:time>, I woke up to the horrible sounds of
tires screeching on pavement and then a loud 'thud' as if the vehicle had made
impact with another object.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I jumped up
out of bed which caused my husband to jump up too, asking me what was the
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He didn't hear the screeching
like I had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was heading for the
front door, I told him that I had heard a bad car crash so, he followed me
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stood there in my yard, in my
pajamas and looked both ways up and down our street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everything was still and quiet except for
frogs creaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't believe it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went back into the house and tried to go
back to bed but, it was bothering me about what I had heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband said we should drive around the
neighborhood and out on the highway to see if there had been an accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We drove around, up and down each street and
out on the highway both ways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
no accident!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was so concerned about
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, when we got the call on the
early morning of November 6th to get to the hospital because they had a
compatible liver for him, I began to wonder if the liver donor died in a car
accident that I had heard but, not seen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My husband was only on the UNOS list for 13 days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A wonder in itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were unable to find out any information on
the donor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once my husband came out of
Intensive Care after two days, he had the appetite of a teenager.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I realize that he was sick and his appetite
was less than normal but, I had never seen him eat a Cheeseburger and fries
immediately followed by 4 chicken wings and a biscuit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's the way his appetite was after the
transplant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We haven't contacted the
donor's family yet because my husband thought it would be better to have them
get through their mourning process without attaching themselves to him because
he carried their deceased loved one's liver.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I would like to add that my husband is very sensitive to the
paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All through the process of
his illness prior to the transplant, there were spirits with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could feel them embracing him as he sat on
the edge of the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I even saw the
indentations of someone sitting on the bed beside him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took a digital picture and downloaded it on
my computer and there was a thick mass beside him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know what happened to the picture
after we looked at it because I don't have it on my computer anymore. There was
one spirit that did mischievous acts solely, I believe, to keep his humor up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would untie his shoes, something he never
did, and she would ruffle the sheets after we would get into bed, for
examples.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had to tell her to go on
and let us sleep. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I grew up in an old house in the rural area of Sandy Lake
&amp; Stoneboro, it was built around 1847.On the bottom floor the walls were 16
inch stone, the top floor was built during the time the brick builders traveled
through Mercer Co. Our kitchen was on the top floor and outside the door was a
large lilac bush. We milked cows but I did'nt care for milk but each night
after dinner I had to sit until I drank my milk and my parents went into the
living room. It was a nice night because I remember the door was wide open and
I saw an old woman come up the walk she had her hands wrapped in her apron, I
turned my head to yell at my Mom to tell her we were getting company and when I
turned back the lady walked around the lilac bush. When my Mom got there I told
her about the lady and she got very pale and called my Dad and I had to tell
him the story and being six I did'nt understand their looks. Dad went out to
prove to me there was nothing there but, I saw her. As I grew she stayed and
often stood just inside my closet door, even as as teen she caught me from
falling out of bed one night. I never enjoyed her being there but tolerated her
presence. Dad later told me it was probably my grandmother who lived down the
road and passed before my birth and she always folded her hands in her apron
when not busy as idle hands were the devils plaything. The house is still there
and I wonder if grandma is there too.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My name is Marilyn and I to have had very close encounters
with the paranormal, actually I've had them all my life and until recently I've
choosen to stop seeing ven though they don't go away so easy they've become
less in quantites. It started when I was about 4 and we were living in Brooklyn
in an apartment near sunset park, I was sleeping in my room that was at the
very far end of the apartment farthest from my mothers house.And at the time we
had just moved in so all I had to sleep on was some mattresses and candle light
because my mom was still moving our stuff and my night light was packed up; the
following was the beginnig of many things to come..( I wish i could forget it)
one night after my parents had fell asleep I woke up to a strange barking sound
I got really cold so I went to get up from the matress to get a blanket and I
saw on the wall the shadow of a dog barking I thought I was dreaming. But when
the dog looked at me and gave me an eveil kind of grin I screamed and ran out
the room down to my mom's room. When I reached her door a light came from the
window and hit the wall whem I looked at the wall the dog started laughing.I
was petrifed and my mom had to read the bible to me before bed, the apartment
gave me horrible nightmare of small demon like creatures and even sleeping in
my mom's room we weren't safe, in her room at 12 midnight you would here people
knocking or trying to break down the door and when you went to see who was
there it stopped. Till this day i get shivers because when my mother went to
complain to the landlord he said he had thrown the previous tenants out because
nieghbors complained about satanic rituals being done next door....The
apartment in Brooklyn wasn't the end of my paranormal encounters, when we moved
to the Bronx to Fulton ave. the apartment was more welcoming but I could have
sworn i felt like I saw somebody out of the corner of my eyes, one night while
watching TV my brother's door opened when it had been locked and there was no
draft and all of us were in the living room. Then one day while sleeping I felt
someone caressing my hair when I woke up to look around no one was there. Right
now I live in Boston with my mother in law and her apartment would creep me
out, one summer night I went to get my husband a glass of water and I felt
myself shiver and felt a hand on my back pushing me when I moved a can of beans
fell from the shelf and right were I was standing. I remebered what i had read
in <st1:City><st1:place>ur</st1:place></st1:City> page and I thanked the ghosts
and let it know I was protected by God's grace and his angels and if he was
there to help he could stay if he wasn't he had to leave imediatley. I really
don't know why I have so many encounter's but I have learned to live with it.
Thank you and keep up the good work.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Ghost Mother-in-Law</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: katwes@comcast.net </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've spent a great deal of time reading everyone's
experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can say that if you are
perceptive, clear your mind and allow yourself to experience the energies of
those who passed, most everyone will experience SOMETHING!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thank the Goddess that there are websites
like this one for people to learn and share.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I would like to share a story about my friendly, and sometimes not so
friendly, ghost mother-in-law.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I moved in with my boyfriend, now my husband, shortly after
I left my last husband in <st1:State><st1:place>Colorado</st1:place></st1:State>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had a son who lived in the basement of the
house he had inherited from his mother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My boyfriend lived upstairs and he and his son had established a rather
bachelor existence, coming and going with no notice, dishes everywhere,
etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My arrival was not met with joy and
friendship from his son because I brought structure and responsibility into the
house, as well as rules.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Family was very important to my then-boyfriend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His son tried to emulate him as much as
possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother-in-law made herself
known to me right away that she did not like the disagreements and bad feelings
in the house by removing items from the kitchen and around the house, some that
have never reappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I spent a great
deal of time in the house alone so I think I was aware of it the most -- plus I
was the only one who did dishes!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway, time went on and things disappeared only to reappear
in the weirdest places.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wooden spoons
which were obviously favorites due to their worn condition disappeared and
reappeared and disappeared completely, never to return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My husband, who is one of the most difficult people to
convince of supernatural occurrences, told me he saw his mother in a blinding
white light, standing in our hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
said I was sound asleep next to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
then faded to nothing.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The last occurrence was when I was thinking really bad and
evil thoughts about a co-worker of mine while doing the dishes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dishes were many and stacked all over the
counter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was concentrating on what I
was doing in the sink, washing dishes, when all of a sudden a landslide
occurred, sending several sharp knives flying as well as a cobalt glass globe
tea light holder my girlfriend had just given me crashing to the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was thrilled to see it hadn't broken except
for one large piece that could be glued back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As I was crouching, looking at the glass globe without picking it up,
bad and evil thoughts still running through my mind, I watched an antique knife
sharpening steel literally hopped off of its nail and crashed to the floor,
flipping several of the items already on the floor, smashing hard into the
cobalt tea light holder, crushing it to smithereens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the nail had a large head, and the
circular hook on the end of the steel was somewhat ornate, you had to lift it
off the nail, over the head to take it off of the nail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I never doubted again that thoughts are "things"
and my mother-in-law, who hadn't put in an appearance in years, thought I
should be aware of that, telling me to stop sending bad thoughts into the
atmosphere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She always seems to appear
during times of stress, not exactly a supporting spirit, but one telling you to
BUCK UP and get over it!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I was staying at a friends house a couple of years ago and
she did warn us that it was haunted, of course I didn't believe her but after
seeing this I do now! Unfortunately there is no evidence or photos but I swear
that I have seen a ghost! Anyway, there were three of us sleeping in my friends
bed, they were asleep, I was not. I looked to my left at a blank space on the
wall above my head, to my absolute shock, a hand began to move through the
wall. I thought it was just my imagination and woke my friends, and just
pointed at the hand coming out of the wall. We jumped out of the bed and ran to
the opposite side of the room and waited. The hand began moving out of the wall
and attached to the hand was the body of a woman. Now it wasn't what I imagined
a ghost would look like, all floaty and transparent, it just looked like a
woman standing there. She was about 5ft2" which is about my height and she
was dressed in black jeans and a button up white shirt, she was bare foot, long
brown hair. She stood there for what seemed an age, it was only about two
minutes but that's all she did was stand there and then she turned and walked
back through the wall. To this day I will never forget what she looked like,
unfortunately as I have said, there is no evidence that would make you believe
me, no-one else does either but I swear that I have seen a ghost! </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">i happened to stumble upon your site and i found it very
fasinating....</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and thought i would share some thing that happened with my
family with you.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">we live in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>uk</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
in a small town called stanley in co durham, my mum, my little sister rebecca
who was a week away from her 5th birthday at the time and i were going into the
town centre, when rebecca stopped at the top of the hill and turned around, she
pointed to the golf course that you could see from the top of the hill, looked
at my mum and said, " thats where i crahshed my plane when i was a man
mummy" we both laughed and said come on dont be silly, but she went on to
tell us that she was flying with her friend billy when they lost control and
crashed and that they both died, and how she thought it was nice she could
still remeber billy.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">when we researched it just out of curiosity really, it
turned out that a BE-2c, had actually crashed there in october of 1916, killing
both it pilots who were both member of the royal flying corpse, unfortinaly no
names were listed so we could not see if "billy" was there, but how
else would a girl who was not yet five and could not read well enough to
research some thing like this, know that the was the place a plane crashed and
killed its pilots years earlier.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">hope this is good enough for your page...... please let me
knwo what you think, could she really have been some one else years ago?.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Pithole Experience</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: BndtobBella@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I recently returned from a visit to my boyfriend and the
beautiful state of <st1:State><st1:place>Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On one of our day trips he took me to
Pithole...a large oil boom town with a life span of 500 days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Since it was fall and late afternoon, we were afraid the
visitor center wouldn't be open but were jovially greeted by 3 members of the
staff who told us we were "just in time for the movie".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Entering the small theater, we joined a
couple and their two giggling girls...20 mins later my boyfriend and I started
down the hill to what was once Pithole.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In the meadow you'll find descriptive markers of the
buildings and streets, a few old wells, and holes in the ground which were once
cellars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were reading the markers and
snapping pictures when I saw my boyfriend stop in his tracks and shake his
head.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I asked him if he was okay and he
said he was so we continued walking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
kept hearing a conversation between a man and woman and assumed it was the
couple with the girls so I kept looking up the hill to spot them but never
did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We got to the end of the street and
were talking about "French Kate", a brothel manager, when it got
really cold!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could still hear the man
and woman talking but my teeth were actually chattering and I was having
trouble breathing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I grabbed my
boyfriend's hand and started up the hill, thinking we might be having an
experience but not wanting to say anything.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He asked me if I was okay, I told him I was but it was so cold down
there I was having trouble breathing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
we walked up the hill the temperature rose and I was breathing easier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Once we got home, we talked about what we both experienced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My boyfriend stopped in his tracks because he
saw the back of a woman in a dress walking behind a tree, we both heard the
conversation and felt the drastic temperature drop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was the only one who felt breathless but I
guess we all have different reactions to experiences!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I kick myself now for not taking pictures when it was
happening but I guess I was trying to rationalize everything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: Happie7770@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Sorry this turned out as long as it did, but if it is hard
to summarize.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">From personal experience, both the second and third bridge
are haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You may think I'm crazy or
what have you, but my cousin and I both were "blessed" I guess you
could say to have been born with a sixth sense of sorts that our grandmother,
great aunt, and great grandmother also had.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We aren't psychic, but we do pick up on a lot of things that other
people wouldn't pick up on, such as being in a house where someone died, having
no knowledge of it, and being able to correctly tell someone who knows, only to
find out that we are right.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So as not to make this take too long, I'll go ahead and get
into our personal experience.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We went to <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Cry</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Baby</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Bridge</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> one night during the summer
last year around <st1:time minute="0" hour="21">9:00 p.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The temperature that night about in the high
70's-low 80's, bright moon, and no noticeable breeze.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We first parked on the second bridge for a
few moments, with the car turned off, the windows down, and of course to be
safe since it is in the middle of nowhere the doors locked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After about 5 minute of sitting there the
temperature dropped drastically, and a small orb appeared about 20ft from the
bridge on the edge of the creek bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
drifted towards us, and once it got within about 5 ft. of the bridge it
disappeared and the temperature returned to normal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the total of about 7 minutes that we
were parked there, we both got a feeling of urgency, almost panic like, not the
type of panic of being scared, but the feeling you get when something bad
happens to someone dear to you.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We cranked the car back up (with no problems like I've heard
some people mention about the bridge), and drove to the 3rd bridge, which is
supposedly <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Cry</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Baby</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Bridge</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As we started getting closer to the 3rd bridge the feeling
of urgency started coming back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once
again, we put the car in park, turned it off, and sat there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 15 minutes went by when this bright
white orb about the size of a baseball appeared on the left side of the bridge
about 10 ft from the actual bridge itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Within a matter of seconds we heard a loud splashing sound coming from a
short distance down the creek and getting closer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sounded as though someone or something was
"stomping" in the water coming closer to us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We continued to sit there watching the orb
and listening to the splashing sound until the splashing was coming from under
the bridge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The orb "freaked
out" and was darting back and forth closer to the creek bank, and backing
away from it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The splashing quieted down
and started turning into the sound of someone or something coming up the creek
bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The orb disappeared as quickly as
it had appeared and the sounds stopped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We continued to sit there a little bit longer and nothing else
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The whole time we were on the 3rd bridge I felt as though we
were being watched, and that we were very "unwanted" there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sense of urgency lingered until we
finally drove off the bridge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order
to get back out to the paved part of <st1:Street><st1:address>Whitesville Rd</st1:address></st1:Street>,
you have to turn around and drive back over the bridges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we neared the 3rd bridge to head back the
urgency returned again and remained until we had crossed the 2nd bridge, then
it completely lifted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Someone or several people definitely died or were severely
harmed on both bridges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You can feel it
in the air.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As many paranormal things as I have experienced since I was
a child, this experience tops the list of things that truly "got to
me".<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A few weeks afterwards, I
wanted to go back during the day, so I got my husband to go with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had him park the car on the other side of
the 2nd bridge, and I got out and walked to the middle of the bridge and
cleared my mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could feel a very
powerful energy around me, an almost "hateful" energy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked back to the other side of the
bridge, down the embankment and under the bridge, the hateful energy changed to
a very panicked, concerned feeling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
did the same thing at the 3rd bridge (Cry Baby bridge) and the feeling of being
unwelcome was just as strong as on the 2nd bridge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The feeling I got under the bridge though was
completely different, it was a sense of complete fear, worry, and extreme
sadness.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have never heard many stories about either bridge or than
supposedly your car won't start if your park on them and turn it off, but after
experience what I did those 2 times I went there, I do not want to go back ever
ever again.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Salem Shotwell Covered Bridge in Salem (right outside of
Phenix City, AL on HWY 280 N, it was on the same rd. that Wacoochee Jr. High is
on, you turn on the first rd. to the right, and go all the way to the
end.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bridge had been blocked off to
traffic since 1994, it was a Town Truss style bridge built in 1904.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason I am talking about it in past
tense is because over the summer, a large tree fell on the bridge causing it to
collapse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was taken apart and is
being stored, to be rebuilt in a park either in Opelika or Auburn.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I had been to the bridge numerous times as I lived about 10
miles from it for a couple of years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Going during the day and during the night was 2 totally different
experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the day there was
very little energy that I could pick up on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At night though, it was a whole other story.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Supposedly there were children that was killed in a car
wreck on the bridge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you ask a native
of <st1:City><st1:place>Salem</st1:place></st1:City>, preferably an older
person, there was never a car wreck on the bridge that involved anyone
dieing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor was there ever a car that
drove into the ravine as your site calls it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It distance from the bottom of the bridge to the creek below it was
about 10ft, and there are large trees on either side of the bridge that would
have kept anyone from being able to drive off the embankment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There was however a girl raped and strangled on the bridge,
an exact time of this happening as rather unclear as I have had a hard time
finding any old newspaper stories about it, but have had the pleasure of
speaking with the police officers who worked the crime scene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was raped and strangled by a soldier from
<st1:place><st1:PlaceType>Ft.</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName>Benning</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>,
which is the reason it was not made very public.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The night that me and my cousin went there, was the same
night we went to <st1:PlaceName>Cry</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Baby</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType>Bridge</st1:PlaceType> in <st1:City><st1:place>Columbus</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We pulled up to the guardrails at the edge of
the bridge, put the windows down, and turned the car off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sat there for several minutes and looked
through the bridge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My cousin asked me
if I was feeling something, and I was but was unsure what I was feeling at the
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told me that she felt like we
were rolling backwards, which was impossible as the emergency brake was engaged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I began to tell her that it was possibly what
I was also feeling and was unable to talk.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I felt as though someone was holding me around my neck very tightly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It started getting harder to breathe, and I
could not utter a single sound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
cranked the car up and began to drive off, the choking feeling stayed with me
for about a football fields distance from the bridge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We got to the stop sign at the end of the
road and I was still unable to speak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
throat felt like it had been squeezed to the point of being quickly
bruised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We decided to go back again the next night and the same
thing happened, other than this time I let her drive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was not the first time I had a
"spirit" take control of me in some way, but it was the worst way it
had ever happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I feared for my life
both nights, because the feeling that came over me, was a feeling of sheer
terror, like I was going to die and there was nothing I could do about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The experience at the covered bridge gave me nightmares for
weeks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would wake up in the middle of
the night feeling as though I was being strangled</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I hope the update on the covered bridge is some help and the
same for my experiences at both places.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I currently moved to NC, and am anticipating getting to visit some of
the places around the <st1:City>Durham</st1:City> and <st1:City><st1:place>Raleigh</st1:place></st1:City>
area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I find out about any places
that are not on your list, I will be sure to e-mail you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope to
hear something back.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We have lived in our home for 12 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We really love this house and our children
have always felt safe and sound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
children were 5 yrs., 18 months, 6 months when we moved into this home.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My husband happened to know the woman selling the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We felt very comfortable buying
the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have to say the things that
have happened to us have been NON-THREATING.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact our spirit friend is silly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We found out that the man had cancer and passed away in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a HUGE ND fan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband graduated from the "GOLDEN
DOME" in 87.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did some looking
and asking of questions from the community.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only thing we could find is the man loved children.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He also liked to play pranks and jokes on
people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My kids and I know that our
friend "Leo" is here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We feel
he watches over us and goofs with us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These are<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the reasons .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the kids were babies-- pacifiers,
blankest and favorite toys would disappear and then ------ boom-bada-bing -- -
-it would be on the child's bed or in the middle of the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a time when I thought I was
crazy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NOPE------- it is just Leo!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When something comes up missing, I say</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"Come on Leo I am not in the mood".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had a fourth child and he does not
"play" with her like the others.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She is </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">very clingy to Mom and dad.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I guess what I am trying to say is that NOT all spirits are scary or
threatening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everyone in the town we
live in loved this man and so do we.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thank you Leo (for keeping track of the kids pacifiers),</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When I was about 5 years old I would often go into my
parents' room in the middle of the night when I couldn't sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night I approached my mother's side of
the bed, but was stopped in my tracks by a tall, white figure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not a solid object, but kind of like a
white shadow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, I turned and went to
my father's side of the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Same
thing.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So, I turned around and went
back to my own bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I did not feel scared, but somehow knew that this figure did
not want me to wake them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was the
last time I ever went to their room during the night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">my name is <st1:State>brittany</st1:State> and i live in <st1:place><st1:City>greenfield</st1:City></st1:place>
mass.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i always thought i was crazy when i was little now i know im
far from it...ok so i was about 5 or 6 at the time i live in a old big whiteish
grayish house on woodly ave.in greenfield,i had two immagenary friends when i
lived there, hata and hidi(a little boy and an old lady),i used to always play
with them and my mom was a little confused at the time like:is it normal for a
little girl to have an old lady as an immagenary friend?but they were my best
friends.i used to go in my basement with them and see things like cofins and a
guy standing over them reading a book,i would run upstairs and tell my mom but
she would never go look.so we moved about 5 years later into a house on davis
st.in greenfield.this house was worse then the last one,i was about 11 or 12
when we moved (and i live in this house still)and i walked into my room (4 or 5
weeks after we moved in) and i saw two little girls in cute pink and white
frilly dresses rolling a blue ball bvack and forth in the middle of my room,i
screamed and ran out of my house,i called my mom at work and told her the
storie and she said "its ok they wont hurt you ive seen them to"i was
shocked that she said that.but i went back about 6 hours later not to find anything.my
phone rang 2 times before the ansering michen picked up and the smell of
ciggars filled my house,when i listend to the phone there was two little girls
talking on the other line,so i picked up the phone and said "hello who is
this?" and they hung up.so after about 6 months of me and my mom getting
hit on the back or tripped or lights clicking on and off we disided to go to
the librarry to get some kind of history on our house(and the old house as
well)we found that the house i lived in when i was 5 or 6 was an old funral
home and my immagenary friends were far from immagenary.the house we live in
now is an old bording house and the little girls have no records of ever living
in the house.they dont bother us anymore but you can still feel the every once
and a while.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Childhood visits from another world</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: CHERIANN4321@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Once when I was around five years old we were visiting my
grandfather. He lived in a small town near the north/east corner of <st1:State><st1:place>Colorado</st1:place></st1:State>.
My grandfather's house was very old, the only indoor plumbing that it had was a
kitchen sink, but even that was somewhat antiquated..the water would come out
of the faucet but it had to drain into a pot that sat on the floor underneath
it, which then had to be tossed out of the door. To go to the bathroom we had
to go to the outhouse in the backyard..(which in itself was rather scary!)..The
house was surrounded by trees, and I seem to remember that there were railroad
tracks nearby.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night during this particular visit wile everyone was in
bed, my brother in the front room on the couch, my grandpa in his room, and my
mom, dad and me in the second bedroom, a strange occurrence was about to
happen. It was pitch dark and I was lying in the middle of my mom and dad,
which made me feel very safe and secure. I was wide awake and happened to be
looking toward the bedroom door, thats when I noticed that someone was walking
through it. My mom and dad were both still in bed, and this did not look like
my brother or my grandpa. It looked like a very small woman wearing a vail with
her head slightly bowed. Anyway she, or whatever this was, walked past the
brass footboard of the bed, went to the window turned around walked past the
foot of the bed again and then out of the door. The image was extremely bright
in the otherwise dark room, and I did not feel frightened by it at all.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Now, this next story
scared the living daylights out of me!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was around ten years old, at home, in a very unassuming
bi-level brick house. My grandfather's house looked the part for a haunting,
but this one, not even close. It was just your average everyday house. However,
something not so average was about to take place in it. It was in the middle of
the night and for some reason I woke up. From where my bed was I could look
straight out into the living room. Which I just happened to be doing, and thats
when I noticed the dark image walking out of the kitchen. It walked to the
stairs and stood there for a few seconds. I concluded that this was my dad
about to go downstairs to check on my brother, who was a teenager at the time,
to make sure he had come home after being out with his friends. But, he seemed
to change his mind about doing this as he turned and started walking toward my
room, which was nothing out of the ordinary because he had to walk past my
bedroom to get to his and my mom's room. He stopped at my door and stood there
looking at me, I finally said "hi dad"..I got no response. I looked
at this dark image more closely, and noticed that it was staring at me with big
dark hollow eyes, nooooo this was not my dad..and in spite of the fact that it
was not threatening me in anyway, I lost it (!) and started screaming! This
screeching woke my mom, who rushed to my room, running right through the dark
figure, and it vanished. I slept on the floor in my mom and dad's room for
about a week after that!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Despite <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Ford</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Island</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
already being listed in the index, I suppose a few more accounts of it couldn't
be of any harm.My first story has nothing to do with this location, It was
merely my first encounter with the paranormal.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I recall a few years back my family was having a discussion
about hauntings and what not.I have a grandmother who has bought houses because
they are haunted, so there is no shortage of stories. My mother brought up one
which,regardless of being the subject of, I have no recolection (I was pretty
young when it happened). She told me that when I was about three, I had told
her about a man coming into my room in the middle of the night and sitting down
on my bed and provided a pretty vivid description of him.Upon hearing this, she
was starteled (no mother wants a strange man in there childs bedroom) but the
more she thought about how I had described him, the more she was unsure of the
truth. A few days latter she presented me with a photo of a man and to her
suprise I said "Yeah mom, that's the man who was in my room".The
reason for this suprise? It was my grandfather who had died some years before.
I had never seen any pictures of him and had no means of recognizing him. The
only explanation we can come up with is that it was my late grandfather coming
to meet his only grandson (me).By the way,If anyone ever tells you about the
Dam Site in <st1:place><st1:City>Hamden</st1:City>, <st1:State>Maine</st1:State></st1:place>,
my grandmother that I mentioned owned it way back and it is haunted. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now onto my more recent accounts of Ford Island.I had never
truely been convinced of the paranormal.I belived in it to some degree but
never had any first hand accounts that I could recall (I seriously have no
memory of my last story).This was until I started spending more times on Ford
Island with my friends.I have a handful of accounts that have made me a firm
believer.They aren't in any real order other tan how I remember them.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">1.My band dicided to stay late and practice one night at the
community center (Building 86 I believe). Midnight rolls around and our drummer
calls in need of a ride out to where we were.Our drummer and bassist both leave
to go get him leaving only me and my friend in the whole building. The pizza we
had ordered came about five minutes later. We went into te back room to get
some drinks out of the fridge. We were chatting about whatever and I turned to
look back into the main room and I saw a figure walk past the doorway. I figured
everyone was back and we just hadn't heard them come in. After a quick
investigation,we discovered that they weren't back yet and we were still the
only ones in the building. The figure was more of a shadow and it moved rather
quickly. I know exactly what I saw but can think of no other explanation than
that it was, in fact, a ghost.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">2.It was a situation much like the last. It was after
practice and we decided to relax and go for a walk. We were walking northbound
down the eastern side of the island talking and what not.About five minutes
into our walk, we started hearin a chain ratlling behind us. From the sound of
it, I would guess maybe 15-20 feet behind us. I heard it first and
stopped.Everyone asked me what was wrong and being unsure about it I said "nothing"
and we continued on. No more than 10 seconds later it happened again...and this
time everyone heard it.It was much loauder than the first time. Seeing no other
option, we kept walking. It followed us for probably 100 yards and suddenly
stopped. I really have no idea what to think of this one.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">3.We decided, yet again, to have a late practice. This time
at the dispensary. We unloaded all of our equipment and two of the four of us
left to go get some other people leaving me and my friend alone to take everything
inside (I'm begining to se a pattern). We are going back and forth taking
everything in and everything is going fine. It was our last trip in and as soon
as we got inside, we realize the light in one of the upstairs rooms was on. the
peculiar thin about this was it haden't been on two minutes earlier and we were
together the whole time. On top of that, the room in question has, was, and
probably still is locked. In all our adventures through the building, we found
the key to every room in the building except this one.Just as a note, the
building is off limits and it is alarmed. We were escorted out by MP's a week
or so after the night in question.It was probably against better judgement to
go in there and, after hearing what they had to say, I don't know why you'd
wan't to go in anyway.It turns out that after the Attack on Pearl Harbor it was
used as a make-shift morgue and bodies upon bodies were stacked up in the
courtyard (its a hard building to describe, you'd have to see it to
understand).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">4.It is said that the pool on <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Ford</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Island</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> is the most haunted place
out there so we were probably just asking for this one but thats beside the
point. I dont remember exactly what time it was but it was fairly late. We
parked our car in the lot at the pool. We were somewhat looking for a scare and
we got one...and then some. We sat there for probably 15 to 20 minutes hoping
we would see somthing. All of a sudden, we feel the car start to lurch back
slowly as if someone was sitting on the back bumper. We look back and confirm
that there is no one behind the car. We were all slightly spooked but
apparently that wasn't good enough. A few minutes pass and we had almost
forgotten the prior incedent. Suddenly, the car jerked backwards quite
violently. I would compare it to someone jumping on the back bumper with all
the force they could muster. All of our heads turn just in time to see a white
light dissapear behind a nearby dumpster. At first I wasn't even really scared,
just completely confused. The next moment I was scared to the point where I
wanted to throw up. Needless to say we left rather "briskly".</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">5.It was on another late night adventure that this
happened.We were walking around the south/south-western portion of the
island.Not far after we passed the brig, I started having the sensation that
someone was walking directly behind me. It was odd but I didn't say anything.
It was only a few minutes later that the friend I was walking with said that he
was having the same feeling.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: RGURL0585@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am 13 yrs old and my parents are recently going through a
divorce so My mom my sisters and I moved into another house. In 2001 my Grandma
died and it affected me greatly, i really loved her more than anything in the
world. My brother Lucas was born a still born. I never knew my brother Lucas
but i know that if i would have known him i would have loved him as much as my
Grandma. Well Sun. October 23 rd 2005 i was sleeping in my new room (the
basement) when i suddenly felt someone lean over me and put my teddy bear Fred
next to me {Fred was given to me by my grandma just before she died}. I woke up
immediately after i felt this and searched my whole room and there was no one
there. When i went up stairs to see if it was my mom or one of my sisters
playing a joke on me but no one was awake yet. When I told my mom about this
she said that she thought it was my grandma and my brother coming back to make
sure i was okay and was not hurt by anyone. I also was in my room reading a
book when i heard males voice say everything would work out between me and me
friend who had just had a big fight. I believed this voice to be my brother.
Ever since these two things other strange little things have occurred. I really
dont believe these to be haunting's but i dont know what to believe of them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I would like to tell you of an experience my husband and I
had when we were living in an old house in the <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>village</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName>Alamance</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>, NC.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We lived in this house for 2 yrs.and discovered we had
another child in our house other than our two children. You could sit on the
couch in our living room and out of the corner of your eye see the shadow of a
small child,female maybe 3 yrs.old. I know this was not my own children because
my daughter would be in school and my son was an infant. I never said anything
to my husband until he saw it and told him I had seen it several time but
didn't say anything to keep from being accused of being crazy. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That Spring I was reworking my flower garden in front of the
house and as I cleared away the grass to extend my borders I found a brick
edging in the ground about the size of a small child's grave. I have never been
able to find out any history on this land. We have sinced moved from this
house, but I have always wondered who this child was and why she is still there
at the house. We never felt uneasy in the house.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A nember of years ago, I took my family to visit the <st1:PersonName>John</st1:PersonName>
Jay Homestead in<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:City>Katonah</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>NY</st1:State></st1:place> on a late Sunday afternnon. There were
cars in the small lot and the sign indicated the home was open for tours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We tried the front door but it would not
open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We knocked loudly and repeatedly
but no one responded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told my wife
(now an ex-wife)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to go around<span style="">&nbsp; </span>one side of the building and try to locate
someone or another entrance while I tried the other side. She took our two
children with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked a short
distance to the left of the front door and saw full length windows or french
doors on the side. I looked in and saw bookcases running perpindicular to the
windows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could see in between the
bookcases and saw a woman dressed in a white or grey<span style="">&nbsp; </span>colored period costume walking slowly across
the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had a candle in her hand
and was moving very slowly with a distant, sad look on her face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knocked on the window and expected her to
turn and notice me as she moved between the bookcases.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She never turned my way. She just continued
walking toward the front of the room in the direction of the front door. I
banged on the glass a few more times and then ran to the front door
exclaiming"Someone is in there and they have period costumes".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We tried the front door again but it wouldn't
open. I knocked loudly and at last someone opened it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I expected to see the woman I saw through the
window but it was a diferent women in a business suit who had been sitting at
desk right at the front entarnce. She was surprised that we had trouble getting
in earlier because the door was not locked and she had been sittting there and
did not hear us knocking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked if we
were in time for a tour and she told us we could join the tour in progress
which had started just a few minutes before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I made a comment that I thought it was very appropriate that the tour
guides dressed in costumes of the period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She then told me that they did not dress in costumes and never had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started to tell her what I though I saw in
the side window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She brought us into the
room I indicated, which was a display are for <st1:PersonName>John</st1:PersonName>
Jay's family items.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were no
bookcases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just some floor glass
displays and encased items hung on the wall.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One of the items was a pearl colored dress that belonged to <st1:PersonName>John</st1:PersonName>
Jays wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could swear it was the same
dress the women in the window was wearing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I tried to discuss my experience with the caretaker in the hope of
getting more information but it was plain she wasn't interested or didn't
believe I saw what I claimed I saw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
joined the tour which was conducted by a pleasant young woman in jeans and I
said nothing more about my experience. I tried to research the story of <st1:PersonName>John</st1:PersonName>
Jay and learned that he died by falling on a pitchfork in the stable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were rumours that his wife was invloved
with a member of the staff, a stable hand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have not been able to learn anything additional or confirm what I
found out is the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I know what
I saw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will never forget the distant
sad look on her face, illuminated by the candle as she passed between the
bookcases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you could provide any
additional information it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Grandmother's Goodbye</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Mother was very young when she had me, so when I was
growing up, my Grandmother would help out alot. I was very close to her, having
been her first Grandchild. I know she loved me very much. When I was 17, my
Grandmother developed heart problems and had to have surgery. She was in the
hospital for a long time, never really getting any better. Then one cold night,
my Mom was going to the hospital to see her...I really wanted to go, but I was
very sick with a high fever, so we didn't think it was a good idea for me to
visit her. I went to bed. Around 12:10 am (I remember the time because I looked
at the digital clock next to my bed) on March 10, 1991, I was awaken out of a
sound sleep by the feeling of someone squeezing me so hard I almost couldn't
breath! That lasted for about three minutes and then I felt a feeling of
extreme sadness. I brushed it off as I must have been hallucinating due to 104*
fever and fell back to sleep. About forty minutes later, my Mom returned from
the hospital, and woke me up to tell me my Grandmother had passed away. I sat
up in my bed and asked when, and my Mom told me around ten after twelve. I
cried, and then I told my Mom what happened. I had such a close relationship
with my Grandmother, that I really feel like she wanted to say Good-bye to me
and hug me one last time before she left this world.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This story is not influenced by legend or rumor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, I always approach strange experiences
with an objective, scientific mindset, and fight hard to find logical answers
to everything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, I've had two
experiences in my 31 years I cannot explain.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Both of these events happened in the tunnel system on the <st1:PlaceName>Bemidji</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType>State</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceType>University</st1:PlaceType>
campus, in <st1:place><st1:City>Bemidji</st1:City>, <st1:State>Minnesota</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was about 7-8 years ago now when I was a
student there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was walking back to my
dormitory from the dining hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned
a corner, and about 20-25 feet into that stretch of tunnel, I started hearing
what I believed to be a woman in high heels, walking behind me, beginning from
the corner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it was so distinct,
I was certain that's what it was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
casually looked back over my shoulder to see who it was and saw nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stopped walking and gazed back in
confusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 'ghost' took two more
steps and stopped as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I examined
the situation, thinking maybe it was the heating pipe that carries steam to
heat the dorms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned ahead and
continued walking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took 2 or 3 steps,
and the footsteps behind me started up again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I looked back over my shoulder while walking, and there was absolutely
nothing there, and the steps continued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, they got closer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
picked up the pace a bit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly before
I was about to make the next corner, the following footsteps were only a few
feet behind me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned an ear back to
get a sense of location for the sounds, and they were coming off the concrete
floor, in perfect succession identical to that of footsteps, loud enough to
reverberate off the walls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
totally indistinguishable from the sound high heels make on a concrete
surface.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as I rounded the
corner, the steps stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to
school there 4 years, walked that stretch of tunnel well over 1,00 times, and
not one other time did I ever hear anything like that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If only I had a tape recorder with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One more note, I was wearing running shoes
which were nearly silent.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The other experience was more subtle, but there were other
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was near noon, between
classes, busy foot traffic, a different part of the tunnel system than the
previous experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was walking to a
different part of campus when I heard a soft cover book fall on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was very obvious and distinct, like a
'splat' sound, something that a small phone book or paper back textbook would
make when dropped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, I looked
ahead to where the sound came from and there was nothing there but
concrete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were two girls, 15-20
feet ahead of me, that were more direct witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sound came from right behind them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them stopped and said
"oops!", then turned around and started to bend down before she
realized she didn't drop anything, looking confused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This proved it wasn't in my head, and was
exactly where I heard it come from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello, my name is Roxane and I have had may experiences
through out my time. I am only 23 and have had may to speak of, but today I
will only explain of one.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was at my fathers house in Phelan <st1:place><st1:State>California</st1:State></st1:place>,
My step mothers sisters husband had just passed away a couple of weeks before
of cancer. Well one night I was asleep on the couch facing a big window that
faces the front porch and lawn, but in that state of asleep but awake at the
same time, anyway I was dreaming that I woke up from the couch and saw her
husband standing outside on the porch so in my dream I opened the front door
and asked him what he was doing out there, he in response said he wanted to see
if everyone was ok I said in return we were and asked him how is it possible
for him to be here if he is gone, He said he needed to make sure and to tell
everyone he is feeling better and not to worry, so in return I told him to
becareful and bye, He then disapppeared, As soon as he left I woke up and
immediatly looked out the window and nothing. I told my dad the next morning
and he said maybe it was him saying bye, but I told my dad why would he come to
me if I hardly new the guy, My dad said maybe I just have that connection with
people on the other side. To think of it now I believe it's true because why
else would I be able to see and have so many experiences from 5 and still
going.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I&#8217;ve several stories pertaining to strange occurrences in
remotes wooded areas. One was particular trial in the woods up the street from
the duplex apartment my family and I were living in at the time. I was quite
young, so in later years I thought my imagination may have embellished my
memories a bit. But a recent phone call to an old friend who lived in the same
neighborhood at the time had confirmed all my suspicions. This same friend and
I loved to hike through the woods when we were kids, carrying backpacks and
fake plastic guns as we also loved to pretend we were soldiers in some kind of
war. There were several trails in the wood that led somewhere. Some were old deer
trails, others hunter&#8217;s paths, the rest made by a few like myself trying to
find shortcuts. One day, we lost our way, in the middle of our war games, and
decided to rely on our compass to lead us back. Luckily it was still light out,
and we recognized some of the land to make sense of where we were. But as we
were heading back towards the direction of our neighborhood, or so we thought,
we came across an odd sight. The path somewhat opened up, or slightly widen. It
was almost wide enough to take a car through, but yet too narrow to try. Off
the side of the path, old rusted cars from earlier years sit in silence. The
windows were all busted out and the body of the cars all shared the same rusty
brown roughness. We walked in the path cautiously and glanced about, looking
into each car one by one. The woods around us seemed to halt into a dead
silence, no sounds of birds, critters, or breeze, as we trudged through the
tall grass that lines the path ahead of us. The entrance of the path behind us
had this dark tunnel like appearance to it as the trail opened up from the
woods then closed up at the end of the path in the same manner. It felt like
this place was separate from the rest of the world. The path was open to the
sky. No trees canopied above us, and no birds seem to fly over the area as
well. Both my friend and I got nervous about this place and decided it was time
to take off. So we tightened our packs and began to double time it out of there
in the direction we believed was home. But just as we were about to exit the
opened path area, we heard growling sounds coming from behind. As curious
explorers we thought ourselves to be, we turned to look. Now I can&#8217;t remember
how many there were, but at the time I only saw five. Five stray dogs just
appeared at the other end of the path from where we entered, and sneered at us.
My friend and I quickly glanced at each other and darted into the woods,
sprinting as fast as we could. Behind us, we could hear the sounds of charging
paws rustling in the leaves, and getting closer. As we high tailed it though
the trees, we came up to a trail we both knew very well and followed it
frantically. I remember the feeling of dread as I heard the growls and snarls
echoing just behinds us. We dove through the woods and ended up in an area just
behind our neighborhood. It was a place the other kids in the neighborhood
simply called the &#8220;Mud Pit&#8221;. An undeveloped part of the neighborhood that had
eroded into a crater like pit, where the older kids would show off their dirt
bike tricks. Realizing we couldn&#8217;t out run a pack of stray dogs through the
pit, we decided to stand out ground. So we gripped our play plastic machine
guns like baseball bats and turned around to fend off the dogs. But as we
turned to face to immanent onslaught, the dogs were gone. Not a sign of them
anywhere, nor were there any sign that they were chasing us at all. We stood
there for almost five minutes, holding our feeble weapons firmly breathing
heavily. We were so afraid to turns ours backs, even as we slowly made our way
through the Mud Pit. We told everyone who would listen, mostly other kids, and
of course, the belief level was 50/50. We never walked that path again. It
wasn&#8217;t until a few years later when I got older, I decided to visit a friend in
a neighboring subdivision, and I took one of the many familiar trails that led
there. On the way there, and on the way back, I didn&#8217;t pay it no mind where I
was, I just knew where I wanted to be.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By this time the trails were more prominent and easier to follow. But for
some stupid reason, I lost my way. I veered off the main trail thinking I where
I was going, and ended up in the same odd path with old rusted cars sit. It was
like deja vu. The path looked the same way as I remember. Tall grass, rusty
hulks of cars, and open sky above. I just grit my teeth and hustled through.
Then, just as I reached the end, I hear growls. I turn to look like last time
to see what looks like the same stray dogs sneering at me. I was scared, but I
knew I couldn&#8217;t run. But this time I was prepared, and I was much bigger than
before. I grabbed a loose tree branch, snapping hard and loud off the trunk. As
the dogs threatened to chase me, I stepped up and began screaming loudly
slamming the thick branch against the rusted car hulks on the side of the path.
I began picking up rocks and throwing them at the dogs at the same time
swinging my stick like a crazed barbarian. I guess my sudden change in tactics
worked they ran off, leaving me a nice quiet walk back home. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After my family moved out of the neighborhood several years
later, I went back to find that path, but was unable to locate it. I spent
hours trudging through the woods, I even went back a second day spending hours
trying to retrace my steps, but with no luck. That path is just a memory now.
That was almost fifteen years ago, and as years went on, I passed this memory
off as one of my many imaginative stories one tells and embellishes to
entertain others. But my recent phone conversation with the same friend who
found the path with me the first when we were kids tells me he remembers that
day as well. And he also tried to find the path a few years back just to
confirm he wasn&#8217;t making this up. But his results were just the same as mine.
We both believe, that particular path through the woods can only be found, if
you&#8217;re truly lost. But whatever keeps it hidden, plays off your fears. It was
the dream of being chased, but being able to run fast enough.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi my name is Missy and over the years I have experienced
quite a few unnatural things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember
when i was 14, the night that my best friend died, i woke up to find a black
orb floating really slow through my bedroom and then it floated out the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the next morning i woke up to my dad telling
me i had an important phone call from my friends mom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>she told me that he had been killed in a car
accident the night before and told me when the funeral was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that is one of the firsts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>here is another one that happened just about
a month ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I moved from <st1:place><st1:City>Tulsa</st1:City>
 <st1:State>Oklahoma</st1:State></st1:place> to Mcloud to live with my
fiance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well his mom and him went to
work and his dad went to church so i was alone with my 4 kids at the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it was getting dark and the kids
were asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i was at the computer
checking my email and talking to some friends on yahoo chat when i heard the
front screen door open and close then the front door open and shut really
hard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i thought it was his dad returning
home from church and when i got up to see if it was, there was no one home. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>the cars were still gone, so i decided to
check the other rooms of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>no
one was here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>so i got this really
uneasy feeling so when i went to walk back to my room, i got halfway into the
kitchen and i saw a shadowy figure standing in the kitchen by the china
cabnet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>well i looked away really quick
and when i looked back they were gone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>so i ran into the room to check on my baby to see if he was ok.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for some reason, ghosts seem to follow
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>even in the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i always let my fiance drive and when we get
to this one stretch of road in Mcloud, it feels like someone is hitting the
back of my seat with their feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>even
when we are all alone in the c with no kids.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>i have had so many experiences like this it is hard to document them
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>also i dream things before they
happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i remember when i was 5, i was
going to louisianna to live with my dad for a while and i dreamt how the house
would look down to the carpet and the bedspread on my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and sure enough when we got there it was the
same way as i had dreamt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it scares me,
but i try not to let it bother me too much. no ghost has ever tried to harm me,
and i dont mess with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>thanks for
letting me tell my story!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This story is compltely true though its quite creepy maybe
not to some people but the thought of it will always scare me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night me and my friends Alex Walters, Luisha Lewis,
Hayley Pratt, Aimee Westwood and Carol Lewis all had a Halloween sleepover it
was a Saturday night and we all wanted to be scared out of our skins because it
was Halloween all of us tried to tell spooky stories and some of them were a
little creepy but me Carol and Luisha wernt scared enough for Halloween night.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We tried to think up things that would be really spooky to
do, like Carol suggested we all camp out in the garden which would have been a
little creepy because it was so dark. But then Luisha had a really good idea
that would really scare us we would creep out of the house at 12.00pm and go to
St.Michaels church graveyard and sit in it for 30 minutes, me and Carol were
well up for it but it took a little time to convince the others but luckily we
did.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So at 12.00pm when my parents had gone to bed we got up and
put out coats on, we climbed down the stairs careful to avoid the creeking step
third from the bottom we all snuck out the back door it was a completely clear
nite and you could see all the stars and the full moon or near enough a full
moon im not sure.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We walked down all the little winding roads and finally got
to the graveyard the moment i got there i just fealt a shiver down my spine,
the graves in St.Michaels were very old one from 1688. All of us walked through
the arch at the front of the church and the main grave we could see in the darkness
(we couldnt see much because we didnt have torches) was a big grave with a
woman on it and a large holy cross it had a sort of a seat round it so we
planned on sitting there for the 30 minutes. So we all sat down until Carol
decided to go and look at a simalar grave to the one we were all on know exept
it was bigger and had a man on Carol looked at the writing it was very faint
but it said <st1:PersonName>Matthew </st1:PersonName>Kutcher died 31st October
1688 she told us to come and look because the man had died the same day but 312
years before (it was currently the year 2000) this majorly freeked us but me
and Carol and Luisha sat on that stone the others said they were too scared and
they were going back to the house but we said we were staying and they could go
if they liked and they did.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After they had gone and us three were alone on the grave at
12.52pm on the 31st of October 2000 we all started too get scared and it takes
a lot to scare us we had 8 minutes left to go though so we stayed, a few
seconds later we heard a tap tap tapping we wondered what it was but we stayed
on the grave then suddenly there was a bang bang from beaneath us it was the
grave stone something was banging the stone from within the coffin. If we hadnt
already been scared before we were terryfied now, we ran for it but the
weirdest thing was that there were footsteps behind us all the way home and
there was no traffic on the main roads we decided too pass this time when there
would usually be loads even at 1.00 am in the morning the footsteps came all the
way to my house though none of us dared to look behind until we got to the
house but when we turned round then there was nothing the footsteps stopped we
decided the footsteps could have been our hearts beating but i never believed
that i think it was <st1:PersonName>Matthew </st1:PersonName>Kutcher and we
couldnt see him because he was invisable because he was a ghost.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">And the weirdest thing about this story is that the only
person i ever told about my experience and what i thought died the day after
and was buried in St.Michaels grave yard.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">please put my story up it might teach kids like me not to go
to graveyards at 12.00pm at night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Working late one night (4-9 p.m.) in the cafeteria area, I
had seen a bright light which looked to be the appearance of a little girl. As
I entered the doorway to the supply room from the front of the cafeteria I saw
this light moving towards the wall and just as fast as I realized what I was
seeing the light went right into the wall and down to the childrens clothing
section. I felt as if I was going to faint, and yes you better believe it, I
had called into work the next day &amp; told them I was sick. I did not tell
anyone about what I had seen because I did not want anyone to think I was crazy,
however I could not stop thinking about it. One day as I was taking lunch with
a co- worker I had decided to talk to her about it, much to my surprise this
same ghost has been seen by many employees on many different occasions. They
say she plays alot of tricks (shoes floating around the room, stuff drops off
the shelf when people walk by,lights turn on &amp; off etc), but she had also
caused alot of destruction during the refurb in I believe the year was
1999-2000. I had already quit the job I had here and moved on to another,
however I had a couple of employess who were in the night stocking crew in
which I still kept in contact with and they have stated to me that in deed
"We y" is real. <st1:City><st1:place>Covina</st1:place></st1:City>
police has been called out to take reports on some of the damage she has
caused, there has also been 2 psychics called out to investigate, they had also
got to experience the sight of the shoes floating around the room.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I used to live in house with my family back in the mid-80's
to 1990.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as we moved in, strange
things started to happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance
my little brother's room was nice and clean with all his toys on shelves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went in there one day and all his toys
were strewn all over the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I used to
hear footsteps in the hallway when I'd watch TV late at night and everyone was
asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd quickly run up the stairs to
see who was awake but found the hallway (to the bedrooms) was empty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the bedroom doors were closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brothers and uncle also heard this same
thing when they were up by themselves late at night, or when they were the only
ones home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the creepiest things
that happened in the summer of 1986.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
aunt, who lived with us, was getting married and one day her sister (who came
to <st1:country-region>Canada</st1:country-region> from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>)
for the wedding, asked my grandmother who the Caucasian lady was (saw her in a
room) and if it was her friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
grandmother, of course, didn't have any friends in the house.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another time we were all in the basement
watching TV an my brother had to use the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The one downstairs was being used so he went
upstairs and as he passed my room he saw someone sitting on my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thought it was me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he came back down he asked me why I was
sitting on my bed in the dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told him
that I never left the basement, in fact none of us went up after he went
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That really creeped me out and
wondered why this entity had to sit on my bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Another time there were only 4 of us in the house, my brothers, myself
and my brother's girlfriend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were
talking in the basement one time and suddenly by bro's g/f got freaked out and
she said that she saw someone head peer our<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>from my bedroom (I had moved to the b/r downstairs) and just stare at
us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've seen a dark shadow in the
laundry room one time which scared the you know what out of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another time something happened to my
friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was waiting in the basement
for me and for some reason he said he was drawn to the laundry room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom had a clothesline in there to hang dry
blankets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well he went in and suddenly
the clothesline started to move as if there was some sort of wind pushing it
back and forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The windows to the
laundry room were never open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
freaked him out and he just left and didn't bother waiting for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We know something weird was happening in the
home and one day a family friend (who claimed to be clairvoyant) came over (we
threw a family party).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had never
come before and she didn't even spend a couple of hours in our home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A year or so later when we spoke to her she
said all she could feel was sadness and depression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was just a negative aura she had to
leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said she could hear someone
crying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom even told us (after we
move out) that she saw some lady sitting on our stairs crying or something like
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think my mom asked her what she
was doing there but didn't get a response.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Years later I discovered tha there used to be an elderly couple that
live in the house with a little girl and that the lady died in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My buddy who lived across me used to tell me
that everyone avoided walking near the house (even avoiding the sidewalk when
approaching the house).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He mentioned
that they were a weird old couple with a little girl.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I asked my mom why she told me the lady died
in the hospital when in fact she died in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told us that so that we wouldn't be
scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I guess we ended
experiencing our own ghostly encounters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even my bro's friends or my friends didn't like coming over because they
were just creeped out when I'd tell them about what was going on in the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We tried taping the basement for
a few hours but when we checked the tape there was nothing captured on audio or
video.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: Sasha_Cracker@hotmail.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've had a few experiences over the years with ghosts and
believe in them fully.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The first one I have to relate is that of my Aunt's
funeral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Aunt had just recently been
treated for cancer and had been determined to be cancer free.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course the whole family was happy with
this outcome; we figured we had more time with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Little did we know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not too long after being declared cancer
free, less than two months, she died suddenly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I'm not aware of any autopsy being done; I believe everyone, family and
doctors, assumed her cancer had come back, or hadn't really been gone, and it
had killed her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, during her
funeral I'm sitting there in those hard folding chairs that the funeral homes
are so full of inside the chapel trying to listen to the eulogy when I look up
at the stained glass windows high up near the ceiling (this chapel had an
actual old-time chapel ceiling so it was high up).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw a mist floating across the glass and I
knew, just knew that that was my aunt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don't know if she was there to give comfort to all of us there, or if she was
there for her mother (my grandmother, who declined rapidly after that--another
story) or if she was there for her husband, who ended up killing himself almost
one year to the date he missed her so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Life goes on and with life comes the feeling that maybe I
didn't see what I thought I'd seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
couple of years went by and I'm starting to doubt myself and what I saw in that
little chapel in North Augusta, GA at my Aunt's funeral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night while I was sleeping, or in a lucid
state--I still can't decide what state I was in, my Aunt came to me in my
dreams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were all at a funeral and
everyone was milling around as if it was the visiting time, or the time after
the funeral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In amongst everyone, across
the room from me, was my Aunt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
logical mind told me that it was impossible for her to be there, as she had
passed away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Aunt and I were then in
a conversation from across the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
told me she had come to me to verify that what I had seen in the chapel was
true; I had seen her spirit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I haven't
seen her, nor has she come to me again since, but one thing I do know is that I
did see her twice after she died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As a footnote, not necessarily to this story, I have since
found out through a medium that she watches over my children, especially my
middle child who was born on her birthday and whom she called "my birthday
present".</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In 1985 I moved to my Aunt and Uncle's in <st1:State>South
 Carolina</st1:State>, near the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Georgia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
border to live with them for my senior year in high school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a bit overweight and thinking about
going into the Air Force so my Uncle urged me to run everyday after
school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Aunt and Uncle had a dog who
had at one time, when I was younger belonged to my Great Aunt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This dog's name was Boomer and he remembered
me and we bonded again instantly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
lived in a very rural area and along our road was a farm which dead-ended our
road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everyday Boomer would greet me at
the door, excited about our run in the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would run the route together, him leading
me or running beside me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Boomer, a year earlier had been attacked by a Pitt Bull and
hadn't been the same since.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Aunt and
Uncle were happy to see him running with me, I think, because before that the
most he'd done was walking around the house or the outside of the house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Before I had been there six months, Boomer had to be put
down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Aunt and Uncle thought it best
as he was always in pain and while he enjoyed running with me, it was getting
harder for him to keep up, so I'd end up slowing for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to school and when I came home Boomer
was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to my bedroom and cried
until I thought I couldn't cry anymore.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I eventually fell asleep, without eating dinner or my evening run.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard my Aunt and Uncle talking about me
before I fell asleep, worried about me, but I needed that time alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That night Boomer came to me in a dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was standing in a field of wild flowers and
he bounded up to me with a spring in his steps that he hadn't had in
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I swear he was smiling at
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he was jumping up and down and
running around the field he spoke to me mind-to-mind "I'm doing good, I no
longer hurt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Don't worry about
me."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I woke up in the morning
I felt very comforted and as I related my dream to my Aunt and Uncle, I think
it comforted them as well.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A more recent occurrence just happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 12th of this year a very dear
friend of mine passed away after his third bout with cancer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hadn't seen him in a few months because he
neglected to call me when he was able to come to town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was stunned when I got the news of his
passing, but I was also angry at him for not contacting me when he was in
town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went upstairs to my bedroom and
began to meditate to try and see if I could reach him in some form or another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't meditate, I was too angry, so I
yelled at him for not contacting me when he was in town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I began the grieving process, crying and
yelling at him and asking him over and over, why?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After I had calmed somewhat and sat on my bed
watching television I saw a shadowy figure move past my doorway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought nothing of it, as these things
happen around me all the time, and we have a resident ghost in this house who
has never bothered us, so I put it down to being that entity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the next thing that happened put
that right out of my mind and made me sure that my friend who had just passed
away was visiting to reassure me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
friend has a strange sense of humor; one that not many people share, but it was
enough for me to identify that he was there with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was sitting on my bed watching
television that same day my downstairs fire alarm started going off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew I had just replaced the batteries in
that unit so I went looking for a fire.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finding nothing and smelling no smoke I reached up and unhooked it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was bringing the fire alarm down it
suddenly stopped shrieking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's when
I knew my friend was there with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had felt his presence with me previously between the crying and yelling jag and
the shadowy figure moving past my doorway, and this just proved that I wasn't losing
it; at least to me it did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That same
night, I had a dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't see my
friend in the dream, but what was important about the dream was that I saw his
cousin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and his cousin were closer
than best friends, closer than brothers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I think my friend was asking me to check on him, or help him, or
something--I'm still not sure what he wants me to do in regards to his
cousin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm relatively sure that my
friend was/is concerned about his cousin simply because they were so close and
wants someone there for him to talk with and to be there for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I promised him as soon as I got the chance I
would go see him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I no longer feel his
presence here, which is okay; he did what I needed him to do.</p>
