<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Paranormal
Experiences....<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By: <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Vickie<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I've had a few
paranormal
type of experiences, the 1st too small to mention; but below are a
couple that
still creep me out: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">EXPERIENCE #1<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">After a divorce, I
moved back
to my hometown with my then 8yr old daughter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We lived w/my parents until I got my bearings and then were
looking to
find a place of our own. I had a friend who had a trailer she wasn't
using, so
she said we could move in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had been
there several times when she was living there and never had anything
odd
happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well...my daughter and I moved
in and then things started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This trailer
was a single-wide w/3 bedrms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had the
large master and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">the end of a long
hallway, my
daughter had the rm closest to me, then the bedrm closest to the living
rm
pretty much used as a storage rm for my friends extra belongings.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, take in mind, i had hardly ever lived on
my own, so when the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>subsequent things
started happening, i really just thought it was my mind playing tricks
on me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 1st thing i noticed was that
after i'd
put my daughter to bed and i would then get ready for bed later on, I'd
be very
'creeped out" going down the long hallway to my room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It got so bad that I found myself literally
"running' down the hall, jumping into my bed, and pulling the covers up
over my head!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought this had to be
so stupid, but I felt really scared going down that hallway.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, there were times that I was in the
living room and I'd swear that I heard someone saying my name!!!<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The 1st time it happened, I just chalked it
up to<span style="">&nbsp; </span>thinking I was just hearing things
and no way could I have heard what I thought I had heard??<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, it happened a few more times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now,
what I hadn't mentioned was the room
that I didn't use.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend had a small
bed in there with boxes and things piled up on the bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I hardly ever went in there, maybe to stick
something I needed some room in as well.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I did notice though, that it seemed like when I was "running"
down that hallway, it was that room that I was uncomfortable going by.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn't live there too long, I ended up
renting a larger place and we moved out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>BUT, this is not where the story ends...I was talking to my
friend one
day about her trailer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She asked me if
anything "strange" ever happened while I lived there? I proceeded to
tell her about the "feelings and voices".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well,
what she then told me gave me
chills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A while after I moved out, she
sold her trailer and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>moved some of her
things into her current house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One thing
in particular she moved was the bed in that extra room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She had set it up in a bedrm at her current
house for 1 of her kids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not long
afterwards, her girls(and step-girls) started hearing their names being
called!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would think at first it
was a sister or herself, but it never was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They also started getting 'creepy" feelings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My friend started trying to think what could
be going on?? Well, she remembered she had gotten that bed from an old
boyfriend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somehow, (and i don't
remember the details), she found out that he had been into "satanism"
at one point, and that bed had been either used for something
ritualistic or
hexed or something???!!!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She got rid
of that bed that very day!!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even
then, i can't remember the details, but there was a special way she had
to do
so.....<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">EXPERIENCE #2:
Years later, i
got remarried and had another child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
proceeded to move away from home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
daughter was about 14-15 at the time. My son was 4-5.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Before we moved away when my daughter was
about 11 maybe, we ordered her a doll special made. Won't mention what
kind,
but it was supposed to look like her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She seemed to like it at 1st, but not long after, unbeknownst to
me, she
became uncomfortable with it around.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When we moved out of state, the doll was packed up with
everything else
and moved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While unpacking, I came
across the doll and put it up on her dresser on its stand. (not knowing
she
didn't like it anymore). She finally came to me after we got settled
and told
me that she felt like the doll was always 'staring" at her.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Said it gave her the creeps.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My husband thought this was all funny, and
would hide it under the bed and then tell her "i don't know how it
got<span style="">&nbsp; </span>there"..now, please understand,
he didn't know how badly this doll upset her or he never would have
played
jokes with it!! She had told me, not him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So, at this point, i put the doll and some other stuff in a box
and put
it on the shelf in her walk-in closet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not long after, strange things began to happen. Oh, i did forget
to
mention that when we moved into the apt, there seemed to be
"bootprints"
in her closet which noone remembered seeing when we 1st took possession
of the
apt (and noone helping move had boots).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>ok, so moving on...as i was saying, my daughter and her friend
were
sitting on the floor of the closet looking at pictures or yearbooks or
something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, the box with the doll
fell off the
shelf and crashed on their heads!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now,
this box fix very well on this shelf, It was not hanging over or
leaning in any
way...hmmm....So, after this event, other things started happening.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter would be her bathroom taking a
shower and would go to come out and couldn't get out the door.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It was like it was locked on the
outside!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would be convinced that her
little brother was standing on the outside holding the door shut so she
couldn't get out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd hear her yelling
his name from the bathroom and I'd go to see what she was yelling about
and she
tell me to have her brother let go of<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the door and he'd be sitting in his room playing or even out
with
me????<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened several times.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, my son had a toy Star Wars piggy bank
thing that would move and say things when you put coins in it.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It would all of a sudden go off by
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This had NEVER happened
before!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>...THEN, i was ironing clothes
one night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My back was right in front of
a diagonal wall. There really wasn't any room for anyone to get behind
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt a hand rest on my shoulder,
turned
about to see what "i thought" was my daughter wanted (even though in
my mind she shouldn't have been there cause there wasn't any room ),
and there
was NOONE there!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I absolutely know i
felt that hand very clearly!!!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now I
must admit, i have always been a believer of the paranormal, but upon
1st
hearing of this "creepy" doll, i really didn't think much of it.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Alot of people get the creeps around
dolls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>BUT, the hand on my shoulder
pretty<span style="">&nbsp; </span>much told me that i had to take
this seriously now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then went<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>online and looked up a site for a very well
known paranormal researcher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't
know what i thought I was going to ask, but I wanted advice.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>This was yrs ago, and i'm sure what happened
wouldn't happen these days, but I ended up actually talking to this
husband/wife team!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Boy was i
surprised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wife is a well known
psychic and i told her about the doll and she told me the following:<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She 1st asked how old my daughter was.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>When i told her, she said puberty for a girl
is an age where its easy for paranormal things to happen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even though the doll was brand new (which is
why i didn't really take it seriously at first), it wasn't impossible
that
there could be an issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said i was
right to be worried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was going to be
speaking at a college not "too" far from us and she wanted me to
bring the doll and come and see her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had all intentions of doing so, but there were a few <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">problems with this.
My
husband was on-call that week and it was at night and far enough away
that i
didn't feel comfortable driving my daughter<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and myself there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, my son
being young, my husband would have had to stay with him anyway.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Not to mention, I've heard stories about
"bad" objects being <span style="">&nbsp;</span>transported and things
happening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't want us to be driving
at night and
something happen to the car???<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got
scared!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this point, I told my
husband to take that doll and get it out of the house!!!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To this day, I honestly don't know what happened
to that doll?? He doesn't remember himself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I know him and his boss were cracking jokes about it for a
while, but I
had told him to throw it in the trash compactor and get it gone!!!!!
These
things were definitely enough to make me not have any doubts of other
worldly
things existing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Funny thing is....I'm
getting ready to go on an actual paranormal investigation in a week.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm excited, but have to admit...also
scared!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is possibly evil at the
place we're going???<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Don't want anything
coming home<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to my new place of
residence!!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I work at a store
that stays
open 24/7. I&#8217;ve worked there for 3 years on 3rd shift. I can&#8217;t give out
the
name of the Convenience store. All I can say is that I&#8217;ve seen and
heard many
weird and disturbing things there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
at this time I&#8217;m only going to tell of the most recent stuff that
happened
there (would hate to bore u with some of the long stories I have to
tell)
anyway. working there for 3 years I&#8217;m use to all the sounds that the
store
makes, it comes as second nature to hear stuff bang around and know
it&#8217;s just
the ice machine making ice and dropping it and so forth. I also have a
small
radio I listen to and it helps to pass the time I don&#8217;t ever have it
very loud
just loud enough to hear what&#8217;s on. To get on with the story it was
late 330 or
so on a Thursday about 4 weeks back, very slow and boring night and I
had just
walked out of the cooler and I was now to go behind the register for my
drink
when I heard a women&#8217;s voice say my name(and so u know and before I
forget
there is a buzzer that goes off anytime<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>some 1 opens the door<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to the
store so if any1 would have came in I would have known , and I made
sure the
store was empty before I took off into the cooler )as I heard my name
called my
first thought was like what in the H***, I know there can&#8217;t be any one
here, so
just for good measure I called out Hello?.. Hello any 1 there? No
answer so I
took off in search for the someone who called my name after searching
every
inch of the store I found no one in there except me and the parking lot
was
empty. Nothing else happened that night and nothing has happened until
last Thurs..
Same time about round that time. I was in the cooler and it was not a
cool
night but the cooler seems A lot more colder than it usually does and I
had the
feeling I was being watched I kept looking behind me expecting some 1
to be
there but nothing was (that I could see anyhow) so I headed out of the
cooler now
to the register and I heard a women&#8217;s voice (again I&#8217;m sure it was a
women&#8217;s
voice) Is that you? ...I was shocked I screamed WHO THE HE** IS THERE.
Where
are u? ... and all that greeted me was silence. I ran outside and
stayed out
there till it started getting busy with ppl. To this day I have never
seen a
spirit or ghost of a women there, I&#8217;ve seen shadows a man ( if that&#8217;s
what u
will call him ) all in black that full of evil its very disturbing, and
I&#8217;ve
seen<span style="">&nbsp; </span>other ghosts and things there. But
.... I&#8217;ve never seen a women .. only heard her voice. I hope in the
days to
come she will show herself to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Who are these 3
Spirits?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I am submitting my
story
today due to a lot of confusion and intrigue. Back in 1989, I was
living with
my mom and I had a newborn son. I was only 18 at that time. One night
as I
slept on her fold out couch in her living room, I was awaken to the
sight of 3
spirit-like, transparent/almost plasma-water appearing male figures.
They had
no faces, no appendages, but they were all torso and muscular like a
male. Each
one stood in a different spot around me. 1 at my head, 1 to my left and
1 to my
right. I was very startled to say the least and felt I needed to
protect my
child. I closed my eyes and wished/prayed them away. Nothing happened
after
that as far I my recollection. Flash forward to the year 2001, just shy
of 12
years from the first encounter, I was asleep in my new apartment a few
states
away. My now "children" (3 of them) were at a neighbor's house
sleeping because I came home late from work. I had never been alone in
the new
place before and welcomed the chance to have a break and sleep
peacefully. That
did not happen. As I slept on MY COUCH this time, I was awakened yet
again to
these same 3 beings. The terror that came upon me was overwhelming. I
had
awoken due to my couch shaking hard. (the couch had three legs and the
fourth
was replaced by phone books). So at first I thought the movement of me
sleeping
might have jarred the books causing the loud thud which startled me.
Yet, when
I saw the 3 see through water looking beings standing around me like
they did
years earlier, I knew it was not my doing. I have longed to find out
who or
what they were and why did they show up around me. If someone has a
similar
story I would love to read about it<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
caused no physical harm, and vanished as fast as they appeared. (not
looking
forward to yet another appearance. I have had many "coincidental and/or
unexplainable" phenomenons before and after than, and still continue to
have them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Mary Buth<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>molly.baumann@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My brother and his
friends
went to Germantown to stand outside the Mary Buth house. Apparently she
was a
woman murdered by her husband dating back to the civil war, and legend
has it
that you can hear shoveling sounds in the backyard or in the barn
because he
buried her there. Lights have been known to flicker off and on, and
figures
have been seen in the house. My brother and his friends saw a black
figure
walking back and forth across the room, like a huge black mass, and it
actually
stopped and stared at them, which totally creeped them out and they
also saw a
doghouse. Story goes her dog still watches over her grave even in
death. Also,
as they were walking down the driveway, they heard the frogs stopped
croaking,
as if they knew something was there, it was totally creepy, so they
decided to
leave and the guy in front of my brother opened the door and ran out of
his car
causing my brother to hit the brakes, but the person in the last car
crashed
into one car, which crashed into another, and the police, ambulance,
fire
department, and tow truck was called, and my mom had to go out in the
middle of
the night to sign a form saying my brother didn&#8217;t need to go to the
hospital,
and this was late at night, which is even scarier. And the guy who
jumped out
of his car said that while he was driving he could hear her whispering
in his
ear and freaked out. He also said that he &#8216;could see her&#8217; and was
completely
scared. Legend also has it that her fianc&eacute; left her at the altar
so she went
crazy and started killing soldiers with an ax (this was during the time
of the
civil war and she had taken wounded soldiers in to take care of them)<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>and while she was doing this, a farmer shot
her with his gun and killed her. Also, legend says that if you go all
the way
up to her house and then try to leave, she will chase you, and that is
what
happened to my brother and his friends. Apparently, one of the girls
saw a
white figure emerge from the woods and chase after them in her rearview
mirror.
It is also said that if the gate to Mary&#8217;s house is open, she is
outside and
that if the gate is closed, she is inside. Same thing with the stop
sign, if it
is not black, she is inside. If it is black, she is outside.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>On May first 2010 about 11 at night, a few
friends and I decided that we were going to go pay a visit to the Mary
Buth
House, legend has it that Mary Buth took in injured civil war soldiers
and
nursed them back to health.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day she
and one of her soldiers fell in love and decided to get married, the
ceremony was
to be held in a nearby field, but the solider never showed.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>This made Mary very mad which caused her to
go back to her house and begin murdering all of the soldiers with an
axe until
she was shot by a farmer that lived close by.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Story has it that if you see her like and you run away she will
attack
you because she will think you are her fianc&eacute; running away from
her again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also if you look at the stop
sign right out
front of her house and it is black it means that she is out, same with
the
fenced gate surrounding her house, if it is open she is out if it is
closed she
is in the house .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was buried by her
parents&#8217; graves about a mile west of the house; her pet dog was at the
ceremony
and sat at the grave staring at the grave stone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People
tried to take the dog home and feed it
but the dog refused to leave and eventually starved to death while
sitting at the
grave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn&#8217;t go to the grave but
from what I have heard if you go there you see two blood red eyes
hovering
above her grave and if you approach them it gets freezing cold around
you and
you hear growling, also Mary&#8217;s grave seems like it is sinking into the
earth
because the ground level over her grave is about two feet deeper than
the ones
next to hers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you stand on the grave
you get a strong sensation like you are sinking into it. .<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Back to my story, me and about 10-12 friends
went to the house to see what it was all about; before we went and
parked we
drove past very slowly and could see that there was a light on in the
front
yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we walked back to the
driveway the light was off so we knew something was going on.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>6 of us me my girlfriend, my best friend,
another couple, and another girl decided that we were going to walk
down the
driveway to get a better look.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
driveway is pretty long and twisted making it pretty difficult to see
the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we were about half way down
the driveway when things started happening first my best friend looked
up and
saw an owl in the tree staring down at us(nothing much but creepy all
the same)
everybody in the group stared at that for about 30 seconds but I looked
away
first and started looking at the house again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were two lights on, one in the upstairs floor and one in a
room
that looked to be the kitchen in the down stairs floor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Right as I looked at the house I saw a big
black figure move across the window (at the time I thought it was
hilarious)
but we continued to see this figure move across the window like another
8-10
times over another two minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
defiantly not a shadow and not a person dressed in black.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So we continued closer to the house, after
about another 30 feet up the driveway we saw a silvery white figure
move across
the down stairs window that really creeped me and the others out.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>After about 30 seconds of watching these two
figures move across the windows they both moved into the window at the
same
time and stopped then slowly turned to look down the driveway seeming
to look
right at us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that was when we
decided to book it out of there (I was laughing really hard as we ran
away) we
got back our cars, two of the people got in a car with four other
people who
were waiting at the end of the drive way and left right away. There
were six of
us left with four cars, I was driving me and my girlfriend behind a
solo driver
who didn&#8217;t even go down the driveway then behind me was the couple that
went
down the driveway, behind them was a girl that did not go down the
driveway
either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last girl that was following
was having car troubles that we didn&#8217;t know about, the back of her car
was
facing the house she looked up in her rear view mirror and saw a bright
white
oval of light approaching from the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A second later she booked it out of there and came flying down
the road
trying to play catch up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile I was
about 150 feet behind the guy in first, when all of a sudden he slammed
on the
brakes put the car in park and jumped out of his car faster than I
thought
possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I started slowing down to
see what was wrong, when all of a sudden I got hit from behind(keep in
mind we
only got a tenth of a mile down the road from the Buth driveway).<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t hear the collision behind me before
we were hit so I didn&#8217;t hear the girl In the car behind screaming and
my
girlfriend didn&#8217;t scream but when we got hit my head got fuzzy and I
heard
screaming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The girl that was trying to
catch up had hit the guy behind me who then hit me but I stopped in
time and
didn&#8217;t hit the guy who stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
everything was sorted out we asked the guy who stopped why he did he
said when
he started his car his radio went out so he turned it off then he said
he heard
somebody whispering in his ear and then he jumped out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the cops got there we were all ok
(weird enough no air bags went off even thought the initial collision
was at
about 40mph, and the guy that went furthest down the driveway got the
most hurt
In the crash) then the guy in who had stopped sat down by himself away
from
everybody and after about 5-10 minutes he laid down and started crying,
so my
girlfriend went over to comfort him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
then started to shake violently and he was mumbling stuff like &#8220;I see
her&#8221; &#8220;I
see the witch&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was all the weird
things that happened to us that night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Not Scary, But It
Happened to
Me<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>bioboy0714@hotmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">This one isn't
scary, but I
swear it happened to me about five years ago.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the year after I graduated from college, I took a temporary
job
working at a group home where mentally handicapped men lived in Canton,
Ohio.
There was always a staff member in the home to prepare meals,
administer
medication, and make sure that the guys got to their appointments. When
I started,
there were only four men living in my assigned home, as the fifth
resident had
died of old age a month or so earlier. I never knew that resident or
anything
about him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a couple of weeks in
training, I was assigned to work the night shift. It was pretty easy,
as the
residents were already asleep in their rooms by the time I got there at
11 p.m.
All that I had to do was some general cleaning and then I could spend
the rest
of the night on paperwork until the guys got up for the day at 6 a.m.
The home&#8217;s
basement was divided into two large rooms; one was finished like a den,
and the
other room was the pantry/storage area where all of the food and
cleaning
supplies were kept in large metal cupboards. Every night I would
conclude my
cleaning around 2 a.m. and then I would head to the den to finish
paperwork in
front of the TV. As I sat in the den my first night I was startled
several
times by what sounded like the metal doors opening and closing on the
pantry
cupboards in the next room. It sounded like someone was opening the
doors and
moving the canned goods around on the shelves. I would get up and peek
through
the doorway, but there was never anyone in there. This continued every
night,
so eventually I figured that it must be the heater/air conditioner
cycling on
or off. One afternoon a few weeks later, we had a staff meeting in the
home. As
we talked about maintenance issues, I mentioned that there may be
something
wrong with the heater. I explained that every night it sounded like the
metal
cupboards in the next room were opening and shutting, and that
sometimes it
sounded like metal cans were being shuffled around in there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">&#8220;Wait, what does it
sound
like?&#8221; asked the home manager. The other staff members were exchanging
glances.
As I explained my experiences I noticed that the hair on one woman&#8217;s
arm was
standing straight up. &#8220;Is this a joke?&#8221; another coworker demanded. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t
know what you&#8217;re talking about,&#8221; I said. &#8220;What&#8217;s the joke?&#8221;<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t know this,&#8221; said the manager,
&#8220;but that&#8217;s what Rich used to do.&#8221; &#8220;Rich?&#8221; I asked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&#8220;Rich was the resident who died before you
came. He was sweet, just like a grandpa. But Rich had a habit of
getting up in
the middle of the night, opening the pantry cupboards, and checking to
make
sure that the food was all where it belonged. Whoever was working
nights knew
to tell him that the food was ok, and that he could go back to bed. He
was just
fixated on making sure the food was in the right place.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&#8220;Maybe he still is,&#8221; someone else said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
that day after the meeting, I thought
about what I should do when I heard the noises that night. I was
nervous, but
Rich hadn&#8217;t ever done anything to bother me. I decided that I was the
new one
in Rich&#8217;s house, and that I should try to play by his rules.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Sure enough, that night at about 3 a.m. I
began to hear the sounds from the pantry. I didn&#8217;t get up off the
couch. &#8220;It&#8217;s
ok, Rich,&#8221; I shouted nervously. Instantly, the noises stopped. It felt
as
though something was listening. I took a deep breath and tried to sound
calm,
&#8220;the food is all there, buddy. You can go to sleep.&#8221; No one believes
this part
of the story, but I swear that as I said this I heard the cupboard door
click
shut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was it. I never heard the
sounds again. Rich just needed to know, that one last time, that
everything in
his house was ok.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I have a few
encounters from
Utah that could be of use to your site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">A haunted place in
Highland,
UT -- Mountain Ridge Jr. High. While it was being built in 1990 a girl
was hit
by a cement truck and died instantly. Also, a man escaped from the
prison
nearby and perished just down the road after being shot several times.
There
have been quite a few sightings of a little girl in the commons,
wearing a
white dress. Also, one account from a student in the school musical: "I
was at rehearsals, and it was around 7 o'clock. I was just exiting
backstage
into the hallway by the lunchroom. I saw a man in a jumpsuit that had
his nose
pressed against the lunchroom door. When I came closer he just 'poofed'
and was
gone. I asked a few friends if they'd seen a guy watching rehearsals
from the
lunchroom, and only one had seen him at the auditorium entrance."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My mother would
want this put
in the section on Haunted Indiana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attica
is a very small town, almost a Norman Rockwell or its A Wonderful Life
kind of
town. Still it has its share of unsavory things. In the 1930s a little
girl was
raped and murdered and her body found in Ravine Park. The man who did
it was
caught and there is no report of her haunting the park or causing any
trouble.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, there is a certain house<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>that if it's still standing I would recommend
people stay away from it. It looked completely ordinary from the
outside. This
really needs more research because I don't know the address, but if
you're in
Attica it is possible that some of the older residents might know what
you are
talking about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This house was haunted by
the living.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother was a schoolgirl
in the 1930s, going door to door collecting $ donations for something
(can't
remember what). She was let into this house and the people there stared
at her
in a very hateful way. She saw an older woman who she said had the face
of a
child murderer. She got out of there as fast as she could. She told me
this
story in the 1980s and told it like it happened yesterday.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">The street itself
is fine,
although I never visited any homes there. I once went to Mass at St.
Francis
Xavier Church and visited the public library.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both had a friendly, welcoming ambiance. Mom walked alone to
that
library and back just about every day from age six and never felt a
thing
wrong. So it was just that house. It is possible that the house was
torn down
or whatever was wrong has been cleaned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
are other hauntings in the town that are not harmful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">This story has been
given to
me from my late grandmother Laura, her friend Janet, and her friend
Tom. I have
also went to this location myself to find out what goes on there, it is
eerie,
I have seen what looked like a woman looking out a window and
vanishing, it is
in Alloway Township, the house is known as The Dickinson House, built
back in
1754 I believe. My grandmothers friend Janet herself has told me and
everyone
at her salon that she has been inside the Dickinson House and she went
up the
twin staircase to explore the place and she got to the top and felt a
chill run
down her spine, she got the nerve to look back and claimed she saw a
woman in
1700s clothing in skin like not see through but like a person, the
1700s style
woman told her to "get out" and Janet did. My late grandmother Laura
herself and her friend Tom themselves told me they witnessed that same
lady in
1700s clothing in person up in a window walking across a room to turn
on or off
a lantern or some kind of light. There have been rumors of people
moving in and
then out shortly after claiming the house is haunted. It is known as
The
Dickinson House.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Big screen TVs-
a new family bought the place and we installed the TV- a week later-
they
called us to ask if we could move the TV to a new house- when asked
why, they
reported hearing a little girl crying every night- the kids had to
sleep in the
parents&#8217; bedroom because it was so bad. The family asked if we could
remove the
TV without them (the owners) present. They were not stepping one foot
in that
house ever again. The house has been purchased and renovated multiple
times and
was striving to be a bed and breakfast. I believe it is a private
residence
now. I heard a story that the first family to live there had a Mexican
girl
that they treated like a slave and she died there unhappy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have been reading the Shadowlands sight
for a number of years and enjoy reading about the personal experiences
of
others. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Recently my partner, Patrick, and I have
had several hauntings in our home related to the recent death of his
sister,
Dian, who died suddenly the week before Christmas of 2010. Patrick
received a
call from her work place concerned as she had been a no call no show
for two
days. Patrick broke into her apartment and found her already gone for
about 2
to 3 days. As you can imagine this was very traumatic for him as he and
Dian
had been very close. In some ways she was somewhat of a mother figure
to him as
she was about 15 years older than him.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The hauntings began the very night that she had been found. We
returned home
somewhat in shock and were preparing a very light meal. All of a sudden
we
heard a loud noise from our guest bed room. We have not lived in this
house
very long but Dian called this her room and would sleep in this room if
she
came to visit over night. Our cat that was with us when we heard the
noise ran
down the hall way and into the guest room. We followed close behind to
investigate. Upon entering the room we saw the cat looking under the
bed at
something. As I mentioned Dian died several days before Christmas and
we had
decorated the windows of our home with battery operated candles placed
in
nearly every window of the house including this room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The cat was staring at one of the candles
which had fallen underneath the bed. Somehow it had fallen underneath
the
blinds which were fully closed and landed under the bed without
breaking. In
addition (this is a little bit scarier) the other candle had placed
itself
neatly on the nightstand. In addition a picture had fallen off the wall
but for
some reason the glass in the frame did not break even though the frame
itself
splintered apart.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
you can
imagine this made us a bit nervous. However, the following week and a
half were
filled with funeral preparations and somehow we managed to get through
Christmas.
I had almost put it out of my mind when experience number two occurred.
Perhaps
ten days later I was awakened by my cell phone going off at 2 am. The
number
was a local number that I didn't recognize but I answered it anyway in
the off
case it was a friend of ours in trouble. I answered sleepily "Hello?&#8221; A
woman's voice on the other end said "Hi! Did she give you a hard time?&#8221;<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>When I asked who it was the woman replied,
"It's Gia". I told her "Gia, I think you have the wrong
number", and hung up the phone. As soon as I put the phone on the
nightstand I heard a woman's voice in the hall way start to whisper
softly and
then progressively get louder. I could not hear any words but it was a
woman's
voice. At that point I told myself I did not want to hear any more and
closed
my eyes and pulled the covers over my head and forced myself to go back
to
sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For several
days I did not
mention this to Patrick because I did not want to upset him but finally
I
mentioned it five days after the fact. He said he remembered that night
when my
phone rang and he said he heard it not just a voice but voices. He
heard two
female voices and one male voice. He claimed he almost got up to go see
what it
was but just couldn't bring himself to do it. We both agreed that the
sounds we
heard were in our hallway and not outside. Like I said it was 2 am and
our
neighborhood is very quiet. In addition we know what voices sound like
outside
our home and what they sound like inside. In the hallway we have photos
of our
families both living and deceased. Our guess is that their father (gone
for 11
years) and a grandmother of theirs were trying to help her to what they
call
the other side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's just our opinion.
Impossible to prove of course.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The
last thing that occurred was at a birthday party for a friend. We had
mentioned
a few minutes earlier that if Dian was still around she would have
loved to have
been at this party. There were many people there who had known her. A
few
moments later Patrick took a picture with a digital camera and looked
at the
shot. He said "I guess Dian is here". He had taken a picture of our
friend and in the photo she was almost completely obscured by a heavy
white
mist that trailed off at one point. At the end of the trail of mist
there were
what appeared to be two or three orbs. In the future I will attempt to
forward
this to you.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
incident with the
photograph was the last occurrence that we have experienced. However,
we always
sense that Dian is hanging around in the background. In fact I rarely
go into
our guest room anymore and for some reason always feel better keeping
the door
to that room closed. The way I cope is that I keep reminding myself it
is just
Dian somebody who we knew and loved. Once her cremains are interred
this spring
maybe our sense that she is still around will go away. Thanks for
listening to
my story. It's not as exciting as some of the ones here but I just
wanted to
share it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I don't know if you
can
really say this is a ghost story since this has just happen to me
recently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About a 2 weeks ago I was in my
room(late at
night probably 1 or 2 in the morning since I don't sleep much) I was
watching
tv as I am ready about to go to bed I turn off the tv. As I am lying
down I
started to get this really bad gut feeling and next thing you know it
felt like
someone was grabbing my ankles, it felt like they wanted to throw me
out of
bed. Something told me to get the heck out of my room but the ghost
freak I am
I stayed and played with fire. But to the subject it was still grabbing
on my
ankles and suddenly felt like someone was sitting on my legs. It felt
like I
couldn't move or even try to get up. And then if things couldn't get
any
creepier it felt like it was sitting on my back and tickling me I
couldn't
resist the urge but smile a lil and slap my back to make it stop. It
eventually
stop after five minutes and I tried to sleep knowing that someone there
being
playful or trying to harass me? Because the next thing this persons
decides to
slip their hand underneath my cleveage and I scream and sat right up.
That was
really weird for me because it felt like an actual hand. I am not to
the creepy
parts yet. I told it to stop and after saying that I heard this joker
laughter
on the right side of my bed. I slept with the TV on after that. A week
after
that I went outside to have a cigarette (not this was at night so I do
not
sleep much.) I am sitting there looking around and everyone is asleep
where I
live and I hear this whistle it was so clear to me it sounded like a
love song.
It&#8217;s been a week since I heard from this thing but I don't think I want
it to
come back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
