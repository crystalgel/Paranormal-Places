<P>
<P><B>Embassy Suites, Room 832, Little Rock, AR.</B>
<P><B>I checked into room 832 on Tuesday, August 11th.  At about 5am on the</B>
<P><B>morning of August 12th, I heard a loud knock on my door. I awoke and</B>
<P><B>upon not hearing anything else and thinking that it was a prank, I


went</B>
<P><B>back to sleep.  As I started to doze, I heard footsteps on the carpet</B>
<P><B>and saw a shadow come into the bedroom and touch the blankets along


the</B>
<P><B>edge of the foot of the bed, as if to wake me.  I wanted to ask who


was</B>
<P><B>there, but the words would not come and I couldn't make a sound.


 After</B>
<P><B>a few minutes, I got out of bed and looked around the room, checked


the</B>
<P><B>door locks, and assumed that I had been dreaming.  It's now about</B>
<P><B>5:10am.  Again, I went back to bed.  I had requested a wake-up call


at</B>
<P><B>6am.  About 5:55am, I was half awake when I felt the presence again,</B>
<P><B>this time it got into bed with me and I thought that I could feel


it's</B>
<P><B>mass next to me.  I immediately jumped out of bed and asked, "who's</B>
<P><B>there?"  After not getting a response, the phone rang, it was my


wake-up</B>
<P><B>call.  I showered, shaved, and packed with no further incidents.  I


went</B>
<P><B>downstairs to breakfast to meet some associates.  Upon returning to


my</B>
<P><B>room, I had totally forgot the incident, much like one might forget
a</B>
<P><B>dream, and all of a sudden, I felt a chill and got goosebumps.  I</B>
<P><B>retrieved my briefcase and suitbag and I was out the door.  As I was</B>
<P><B>checking out, there were three employees speaking at the front desk.
</B>
<P><B>The young lady asked me if I was checking out and I said yes.  As she</B>
<P><B>was processing my checkout, I mentioned to all three that something</B>
<P><B>strange has just happened to me.  Without any additional information</B>
<P><B>from me to the trio, one of the other employees asked seriously,


"What,</B>
<P><B>did you see a ghost?"  I said, "Funny that you should mention


that...why</B>
<P><B>did you ask?"  He indicated that other guests had experienced strange</B>
<P><B>things in that room.  I asked if anyone had met with a fatal tragedy


in</B>
<P><B>that room and they said no.  I repeated my entire experience to all</B>
<P><B>three.  After recounting my story, the young lady employee and the


third</B>
<P><B>employee, were really spooked and I left without further incident.</B>

</H3><P><B>by Salora2t2@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My children and i lived in my great-grandmother's house during 1985-87.
She had died years ago just down the hill from her house. She had a heart
attack in her car going home and went off the bridge. During the time we
lived there we saw her many times. We had to rearrange the furniture in the


living room because people could see her reflection in the window glass.
At first we all thought she was outside trying to get in. One night i realized


she was inside walking right past us. We saw her reflection in the windows.
She formed a bond with my oldest son, i would hear her at night talking and
go into the boy's room and my oldest son; who was then 4, would be awake
and i would ask him who was in there talking to him and he would tell me
the red-haired lady. Eventually we moved out of her house and we moved back
in with my mother. Not long after that i heard my son talking to someone.
I went in their room and asked him who he was speaking to. He told me the


red-haired lady. She had come with him. Many of my friends here have seen
her as well she is quite a prankster. she likes to stick her hand and arm
or one of her legs out of the wall in the hallway where it can be seen in
the living room. Some people don't find that funny but we all do. We have
about 4 others here as well but none so remonstrative as my great grandmother.
I know she is here to watch over the boys and protect and help them. We are
okay with that. My oldest son is the one she talks to. He quit talking to
her for a while and she became much more noticeable. He has since started


acknowledging her presence and she feels much happier now.</B>

</H3><P><B>by rehehnly@epix.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>From the time that I got married, in 1972, I held most of our family</B>
<P><B>holiday dinners at my home.  We all would get together, my parents,


my</B>
<P><B>in-laws, my sister and her family, and my brother and his family.


 Over</B>
<P><B>the years the family diminished with the break-up of my marriage, the</B>
<P><B>deaths of both of my parents, and the estrangement of my sister's</B>
<P><B>family.  Eventually, our holiday group became myself, my sons and


their</B>
<P><B>families, and my brother and his family, a much smaller group than


was</B>
<P><B>originally. As the family grew smaller, and then larger again with


the</B>
<P><B>grandchildren, nieces and nephews, we continued the tradition of</B>
<P><B>gathering at my home, at which times we would reminisce about


holidays</B>
<P><B>past and the happy memories of years gone by.  Naturally, there were</B>
<P><B>always stories involving my parents.  Every gathering became a


bitter-</B>
<P><B>sweet recollection.  I had been very close to my parents, especially


my</B>
<P><B>mother, so obviously these gatherings were, and still are, extremely</B>
<P><B>important to me.  Over the years, I've had many, many dream


encounters</B>
<P><B>with my mother and my dad, sometimes as a warning of things to come,


and</B>
<P><B>sometimes as a solution to a problem.  Well, the most memorable event</B>
<P><B>happened a few years ago, on Thanksgiving.  As it turned out, my


oldest</B>
<P><B>son was out of state, my brother's family was unable to join us for</B>
<P><B>dinner, and the whole day was basically a "loner".  I did speak to
my</B>
<P><B>brother on the phone several times that day, but it just wasn't the</B>
<P><B>same.  Since I work nights, I took my usual nap that evening, and got


up</B>
<P><B>at my normal time to get ready for work.  I was in the bathroom,


doing</B>
<P><B>my hair, and looking in the mirror, when I remember saying out loud,
</B>
<P><B>"Your eyes have never looked so blue before".  As I stood there</B>
<P><B>transfixed by this, my mirror-image turned into the face of my mother.


</B>
<P><B>She was radiant and smiling.  I kind of shook my head, and the image</B>
<P><B>returned to my own face.  At this point, I didn't yet realize what


had</B>
<P><B>just happened to me.  It was only after I got into my car to go to


work</B>
<P><B>that it hit me.  I cried out "Oh my God!  That was really Mom!"  Then


I</B>
<P><B>remembered the warm feeling that enveloped me during the apparition,


and</B>
<P><B>I realized she was just trying to tell me not to feel so bad, that
we</B>
<P><B>were indeed together for Thanksgiving,and that she would always be


there</B>
<P><B>for me.  My only regret was that I didn't understand sooner, and try


to</B>
<P><B>communicate with her.  However, the warmth of her smile will always</B>
<P><B>remain with me.  Ironically, until that time, I was never able to</B>
<P><B>perfectly envision her features so clearly, as if I had erected some</B>
<P><B>form of a mental block after her death.  Since that time, I have no</B>
<P><B>problem "seeing" her whenever I think of her.</B>

<P>
<P><B>Although I have never had any first hand experiences I have still had
many people tell me their first hand experiences. I am only 18 years old
but have had a deep interest in the paranormal (ghosts) since I was about
8 years old. I am going to try and write as many stories as I possibly can
but bare with me as I have to change the names to respect peoples privacy.</B>
<P><B>When an aunt suddenly died of cancer the house in which she used to
live began to have strange things occurring. At first everything was quiet
until the youngest son became very ill. His temperature became extremely
high for a case of flue. As he lay on his bed having difficulty breathing,
he saw his paper aeroplane which, was hanging in the hallway rapidly start
moving at high speeds in all directions. You may think that this doesn't
mean anything but when there was no draft around at all then there is something


for the little kid to be frightened literally half to death. </B>
<P><B>Putting that down to some not present wind, The family tried to continue


with 'normal average family life'. One of the daughters went to hospital
for a minor operation and when she came home to recover, she awoke in the
middle of the night and felt very thirsty so was going down to the kitchen
to get herself a glass of water. When she got into the kitchen she was filling


her glass from the sink when she heard her name being called. When she looked
up at the window directly above her head, she saw an image of an old man.
It was a very old man with white hair, a long white beard and long fingernails.


He was calling her name and using his hands to call her towards him. She


frantically started screaming as he was floating about a metre or two above
the floor and he knew her name. The image was moving backwards as if to vanish


slowly into the background hoping that she will somehow follow. She screamed
and screamed until her other sister woke up and helped her to get up and
away fr!</B>
<P><B>om the kitchen. When she later told the rest of the family what it
was that she saw nobody believed her. They all thought it may be a delayed
effect of some medication she had previously but she was adamant that she
saw it in full consciousness. (Another friend of mine, totally unrelated
to this story and family told me once that she had seen a very similar man
once who nearly frightened her half to death too. This happened when she
was taking the rubbish out in the daytime. She saw the image of an old man
on the garage door, floating above the floor. The description of the man,
and what was happening i.e. the fading and repeatedly calling her name for
her to follow him, was very similar to what I have just said. This girl was
in a different city totally although it happened at maybe around the same
time.). </B>
<P><B>Although you may be thinking that this must be a one off happening
for the previous family, Many other unexplainable things happened. For example,


when in the kitchen listening to music alongside cooking, the music would


suddenly change. The tape of old songs would not even have to be in the system


but old music would still be heard coming from it, until the stop button
was pressed. This old music would be of the type their deceased mother would


listen to. Also when the front-room remains closed for a few hours during
the day especially, on walking in to it you can smell a sweet rosy smell
and also the room goes from stone cold the instant you walk in to a warmer


temperature. </B>
<P><B>The few times I had visited and stayed over prior to knowing about
any of these experiences I only felt a sense of fear. I, for some unknown
reason was scared of looking in the mirrors upstairs as I felt I was being


watched. After finding this out it may have explained a little bit but it
didn't make me feel any better. </B>
<P><B>I am really sorry if this is not as frightening as a lot of the others
that I have read here on this page but I felt that I should contribute. If
anyone else has had any similar experiences, or has any comments or explanations


then please do mail me at the above address. Also sorry if it is a little


long!</B><HR>

<H3><A NAME=gym>Ghost of the Gym</A>
</H3><P><B>by firemike@pe.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>In San Bernardino Ca. I was employed by Nautilus aerobics plus.After


working there for a short time the other employees stared to tell me of the
ghost who would come to play raquetball at night.The story was that there
was a member who used to play everyday at the club ,he never missed his


raquetball game.</B>
<P><B>I was never sure if he actually died at the club or on his way to the
club but he had a massive heart attack and died.shortly after the floor in
the court he always played in started to warp for no reason . lights started
to blow up in the sockets,electricians came in and could find nothing wrong
with the lights. The court was court number five his friends bought him a
plauqe with his name on it and had it placed on the wall outside of his court


.</B>
<P><B>someone decided to change the court numbers around in hopes of stopping
the events. the lights and floor stopped having there occruences but others


started.It was said you could hear him play ball at night.I myself never
doubted the existence of ghosts I always said if I had proof one way or the
other I would then decide. My friend and I decided to go in late one night
and find out for sure.My friend,his wife and myself went to the club one
saturday at about midnight and waited .  The hallway to the courts had two
red doors that were closed at night we went upstairs to thee overhead observing


areas and waited. After about 10-15 minutes we heard the doors open and close,
we thought our boss had come by to see what was going on so we went downstairs


turned on the lights to see. No one else was in the club but us.We then turned


the lights back off and went back upstairs.There were seven courts,after
about 4-5 minutes we heard a ball hit one time through each court.He seemed
to be selecting a court. he chose the 3rd court.He  then set his can of balls


down and proceded to play.Being a raquetball player myself I know what the
ball sounds like and this is what we were hearing the distinctive sound of
a raquetball being hit.you could hear his sneakers squeak agaisnt the wooden


floor and his raquet making contact with the wall. I strained to "see" who
was in the court but I knew it was empty of any "body".From that point on
I was a believer.The remainder of the time I worked there I heard,felt, and
knew George was there. He would roam the halls play ball and ocassionally
turn off the lights on employees. I thank you for this opportunity to relay
my story to others who share in my and our beliefs and I hope you enjoy and
can use my story.</B>

<H3><A NAME=sisters>My Sister's Haunted House</A>
</H3><P><B>by oldersha@netscape.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>My oldest sister, husband and their three kids used to live in your</B>
<P><B>average Silicon Valley suburban home.  They planned on upgrading to
a</B>
<P><B>larger home as the number of children outgrew the number of bedrooms.</B>
<P><B>They soon found the house of their dreams, and proceeded to move into</B>
<P><B>it, leaving their old house up for rent.  I was living at home at the</B>
<P><B>time, and my other sister of mine suggested that we rent the house


out</B>
<P><B>together along with her boyfriend.  It was a three bedroom, 2 full


bath</B>
<P><B>house...and the possibilities of me being out on my own were very</B>
<P><B>exciting!  He and I would primarily be living there full time, while


she</B>
<P><B>was away at college.  We went for it!  We took in a third boarder and</B>
<P><B>proceeded to settle in.</B>
<P><B>My sister would come down on the weekends, and we would have a great</B>
<P><B>time BBQ'ing and bonding...you know the types of things that you do


when</B>
<P><B>you're young and on your own.  One Saturday evening, we decided to


all</B>
<P><B>go to sleep at the same time.  We had shared a nice big meal, watched


a</B>
<P><B>movie and then proceeded to our separate bedrooms.   That night it


was</B>
<P><B>just me, my sister and her boyfriend.  The boarder was out of town


that</B>
<P><B>weekend.  My bedroom was directly across the hall from my sister and


her</B>
<P><B>boyfriends room.  Down at the end of the hallway, was a bathroom. 


The</B>
<P><B>hallway was a beautiful polished wooden floor.</B>
<P><B>We said our goodnights, and both shut the doors at the same time. 
No</B>
<P><B>sooner had I shut off the lights and settled into bed, I heard


footsteps</B>
<P><B>coming up the hallway from the bathroom.  Creak....creak...stepping</B>
<P><B>slowly...but in the silence of the night, it was very clear that</B>
<P><B>somebody was walking from the bathroom up the hallway.  I listened


until</B>
<P><B>the footsteps stopped at my doorway.  I laid in bed wondering to</B>
<P><B>myself...rationalizing...maybe it's my sister.  Perhaps she went out


of</B>
<P><B>her bedroom and down the hallway when I wasn't paying attention.  Why</B>
<P><B>would she use that bathroom when she had her own in her bedroom?  
I</B>
<P><B>waited for a moment thinking...what is she doing just standing there


and</B>
<P><B>not moving.  At the very moment I piped up to say her name...she


called</B>
<P><B>out my name from inside her bedroom.   We both jumped up out of our


beds</B>
<P><B>and opened the door at the same time.  We stared at each other in</B>
<P><B>disbelief, as we both had heard the same thing.  We were shocked. 


She</B>
<P><B>was listening to the same footsteps and wondering why I would just
be</B>
<P><B>hovering outside of her door without saying anything.  This just


clearly</B>
<P><B>proves that these were very audible, clear footsteps.  Not a settling</B>
<P><B>house...but footsteps.  We both kind of nervously laughed that off


and</B>
<P><B>went back to our beds.</B>
<P><B>The next morning, we all woke to the sound of the hallway bathtub


being</B>
<P><B>filled with water.  I figured that the boarder was home and running</B>
<P><B>herself a bath.  7:00 am on a Sunday morning was rather odd I</B>
<P><B>thought...but who knows.  Since I was awake, I decided to get up. 
I</B>
<P><B>immediately noticed the door wide open to the bathroom and moments


later</B>
<P><B>that her car was still not home.  She wasn't there!  My sister got
up</B>
<P><B>too to see what was going on.   Neither of us had turned on the


faucet.</B>
<P><B>CREEPY.</B>
<P><B>O.K...now here's where it gets really interesting.  We decided to


tell</B>
<P><B>our older sister and her husband what happened.  They both had these</B>
<P><B>really sympathetic looks on their faces and proceeded to tell us of


what</B>
<P><B>happened while they were living there.  Their youngest daughter who</B>
<P><B>slept in the same room that I took, used to wake up in the middle of


the</B>
<P><B>night screaming "lady, lady, lady, lady!"  This went on night after</B>
<P><B>night.  She was very young at the time and couldn't elaborate what


was</B>
<P><B>actually frightening her other than "the lady."  When she got a


little</B>
<P><B>older, she finally was able to tell my sister "lady say's my


house...I</B>
<P><B>say no, daddy's house."  Well, you can imagine...my sisters blood ran</B>
<P><B>cold.</B>
<P><B>They would periodically wake up in the middle of the night to the


sounds</B>
<P><B>of a muffled radio.  When her husband would check around, he would


find</B>
<P><B>that he radio in the garage had been turned on.  On an on...strange</B>
<P><B>things would happen like they would wake up in the middle of the


night</B>
<P><B>and their bedroom light would be on.   This completely freaked my


sister</B>
<P><B>out.</B>
<P><B>She finally asked a neighbor if anything unusual happened in that


house</B>
<P><B>before they lived there.  Well...as you guessed it, both the husband


and</B>
<P><B>the wife died in there (at different times.)  The lady of the house


was</B>
<P><B>apparently a very eccentric woman.  Very short...had very long hair


that</B>
<P><B>she piled high on her head, wore long dresses only, and had unusually</B>
<P><B>long nails.  Sounds scary already.... can you imagine her ghost!


 Well,</B>
<P><B>as you may have already guessed, when my sister asked her daughter


what</B>
<P><B>the lady looked like, she described her to a T!</B>
<P><B>Things got bad for my sister and her husband and they realized that


they</B>
<P><B>had to give up their new home and move back into the one that we were</B>
<P><B>renting.  (By that time I had already moved out.)  Anyway, things</B>
<P><B>started happening again.  Now my sisters husband was a skeptic...but


by</B>
<P><B>this time, he was starting to wonder what was happening.  I think he</B>
<P><B>finally decided that there was an unexplainable aspect to it.  My


sister</B>
<P><B>knew the whole time, that it was a classic haunting.  I spoke to a</B>
<P><B>psychic friend of mine and told her what was going on in their home.</B>
<P><B>She said that there was "something" in or on the house that still


tied</B>
<P><B>it to the previous owners.  Unless they removed this "thing" the</B>
<P><B>hauntings may never stop.</B>
<P><B>So....clean up day arrived.  They went through the attic, the</B>
<P><B>underground space, the garage, the side yards...the entire house, top


to</B>
<P><B>bottom.  Nothing.  It did however prompt a major spring cleaning to


the</B>
<P><B>point where they had rented a large industrial garbage dumpster out</B>
<P><B>front.  Then, as my sister and her husband were walking up the to the</B>
<P><B>front door, they noticed a hanging plant that they had for years, had</B>
<P><B>died.  Disturbed to lose it, my sister hesitantly reached up and took


it</B>
<P><B>down off of it's hook.  What she saw made her go white.  Behind the</B>
<P><B>plant...for God knows how many years...was the previous owners name,


in</B>
<P><B>black iron letters, nailed to the house.  Her husband quickly took
it</B>
<P><B>down...broke it up in to many pieces and threw it away.  The


hauntings</B>
<P><B>stopped almost immediately.  They have since moved from this house,


but</B>
<P><B>we will never forget the hauntings that went on there.</B>

<H3><A NAME=sad>My Mother-in-Law  and a Sad Little Girl</A>
</H3><P><B>by Sc jingles@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This happened in Memphis.  (I wish people would at least tell the state


where there stories take place.  It makes it more interesting to me.)</B>
<P><B>I've had a couple of different visits over the years.  I'd like to
relate two of them.</B>
<P><B>The first happened in 1977.  My ex-husband and I were having a great
deal of problems in our second year of marriage.  The biggest part of the
problem lied my feet at that time.</B>
<P><B>His mother had passed away when he was three years old.  I think the
things that took place at this time were her being there for her son.  She
wanted him to know she was watching over him.</B>
<P><B>One night, I was in the living room watching t.v.  He was taking a
shower in the master bath. </B>
<P><B>When he was finished with his shower, he came into the living room
still mostly wet and a towel wrapped around his waist.  He was smiling and
asked, "What were you trying to do, scare me?"  I asked what he meant since
I had done nothing, I had not even gotten up off of the couch since he started


his shower.  He continued........  "Next time, throw bills."  Now I was REALLY


confused.  I giggled and asked what he meant.  He opened his hand and in
it he held three brand new shiny pennies.  Again I asked, "What are you talking


about?"  He told me that I had thrown the pennies in at him during his shower.
 I giggled again.  And again he told me to "throw bills next time."  At that


time, I saw that he was serious, that this had taken place.  I told him,
I promised him, that I had not thrown the pennies in at him.  It took a few


seconds, but it sunk in......I had not done this.  He knew if I promised
that I was telling the truth.  Nothing much was said about this after that


night.</B>
<P><B>Not too long after that, we had a serious argument late one night.
 We had gone to bed, but we were trying to get it straight before we fell
asleep that night.  We were really afraid we were not going to make the marriage


work.  We both said some pretty hateful things that night.  I took my wedding


band and engagement ring off and tossed them about two feet.  They hit the
wall.  When they hit, we both started to cry.  We really started not only
to get THAT argument straight, but we fixed the marriage, too.  It lasted
another nine years.       </B>
<P><B>I got up to look for my rings.  The wedding band was no where to be
found.  We never did find it.  We about tore up that corner of the room looking


for it.  We even pulled the carpet back.  No wedding band.  I vacuumed the
carpet and then emptied the bag and sifted through its contents........ 
Nothing!  We had no pets that may have gotten hold of it.  There was no logical


reason for us not to find it, but we never did.  We looked again when we


moved.......no wedding band!!!!  So, to mark the beginning of us starting
over, we got new bands.</B>
<P><B>In between the shower and the ring occurrences, I saw a filmy figure
float down our hall.  I followed it and it vanished when it got to our


bedroom.</B>
<P><B>As I said, I fully believe it was his mother watching over her son.
 At that time, the problem lay almost solely at my feet.  After we fixed
our broken marriage, she never showed again.  Our next set of problems, the
one that tore us apart, was strictly him.  I assume that is why she didn't
show up then.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Then, in 1982, we moved into a huge two-story duplex.  I loved the
place.  It was a big comfortable home.</B>
<P><B>After we had been there about a month, I lay in bed trying to go to
sleep, recounting the days events.</B>
<P><B>I heard a child crying.  It was about 1:00 a.m. and had been going
on for a good 10 or 15 minutes.  I knew no small child should be outside
for that length of time at that time of the morning.  The duplexes were separated


by carports, no connecting walls.  So it was really like two separate homes.
 So it certainly wasn't anything I was hearing through the walls.  My husband
was asleep.  I saw no reason to wake him over this.  He had to get up and
go to work.</B>
<P><B>I lay there and listened.  It was very faint at first.  It got louder,
but only a very little bit.  Just loud enough for me to realize where it
was coming from.  That place was our closet.  The child sounded scared and
oh, SO unhappy.  The cry itself didn't allow me to distinguish whether this
was a little girl or a little boy.  I just knew in my heart that this was
a VERY sad, VERY lonely little girl.</B>
<P><B>For some time, that is all that took place.  She would just cry each
night in our closet.  Mark (my ex) never heard her and thought I was quite


possibly going of the edge.  That did not bother me.  I knew what I heard
each night.  It was heart-wrenching, knowing I could do nothing to comfort
this poor child.</B>
<P><B>If I remember correctly, the next thing was the "cold spot" in the
hallway upstairs.  She never left the upstairs part of the house.  I could
always "feel" her when I was upstairs, but never on the lower level.  Anyway,
our laundry room was up there in the middle of the hallway.  I was doing
laundry and backed up to fold a towel.  When I did, I stepped into a spot
that felt like someone had opened the front door on a slightly cold winters
day.  It was at that time that I started "feeling" her with me whenever I
was upstairs or in the attic.</B>
<P><B>The next thing, which I think is so cute, was her waking me up each
and every morning.</B>
<P><B>I have lupus.  I tell you this so hopefully you won't get the wrong
idea about my sleep habits.  It causes extreme fatigue and you need more
rest than some.  Anyway, I would come downstairs each morning when Mark would


leave for work and go back to sleep on the couch in the den.  (I'm afraid
in any two-level home fearing an intruder and I wouldn't hear in time if
I'm asleep upstairs) And, as I said, this place was huge.</B>
<P><B>It started about two months after her first sad cries from the closet.
 She would knock twice on the ceiling above my head each morning at exactly
9:57.  I guess she felt I'd slept long enough and I had to agree with her.
 I always got up then.</B>
<P><B>I would talk to her.  It got to a point that I felt as though she were
my own.  I loved having her there with me.  I never saw her, but my sister


did.</B>
<P><B>She was visiting about six months into all of this.  I took her upstairs,


showed her the closet and the cold spot (which she felt).  She could "feel"
her presence as strongly as I did.</B>
<P><B>When we were through, we went downstairs and sat at the bottom of the


stairs, about 3 or 4 stairs up.  I had a full length mirror at the bottom
facing the stairs.  We sat there and talked about the "whys," the "maybes,"
the "could be's" and "what if's" of this child.  I was in mid-sentence when
my sister grabbed my leg and said, "LOOK."  I turned and looked up the stairs


instead of looking in the mirror.  I saw nothing and asked her, "Look at
what?"  She said "oh, she's gone."  She had seen her in the mirror.  She
told me she had long dark hair, about four inches below her shoulder.  Very,
very sad and dark eyes.  She didn't have her head tilted to look down at
us, just downcast eyes; sad, sad eyes.  She had on a blue dress from around
the 1890s- 1900s.  The little girl did not move an inch.  But my sister looked
up the stairs when I did and when she looked back at the mirror, she was
gone.  That was the one and only time she presented herself.  I wanted so
badly to see her.  I don't know if she lived on that land or not.  There
was a cemetery about 700-1000 yards back behind the property.  I would love
for someone to tell me how to go about finding out what has been on that
land.  I know it may sound silly, But I know NOTHING about how to do this.
 I still feel such a connection to this child.  I was hoping she would come
with me when we moved, but she stayed in her home.</B>
<P><B>I'll tell this one last thing and then I'll close and keep my hopes
up that maybe someone can help me.</B>
<P><B>I had the feeling for the longest time that she died in a fire and
the feeling was a very strong one.  Then I had a dream one afternoon while


napping on the couch.  I dreamed I was asleep on the couch.  The floor of
the lower level of the duplex was on fire.  Now the fire was strange.  It
looked like 1000s and 1000s of pilot lights about 3/4 of an inch high.  The


flames had yellow, blue and a pinkish-purple color in each one.......  Not


assorted colored flames.  I could NOT move.  ALL my energy was completely
zapped.  My strength----------GONE!  And on top of all of that, I could barely


breathe.  I never saw her in my dream, but she was there.....near to me.
 I knew I had to help her.  I tried and tried.  I fought HARD to get up off
of the couch......trying desperately to breathe.  I could not even manage
to sit up.  There was no crying, no talking, not a whimper.  Not a sound
at all from her, but I knew she needed my help.  I was running completely
out of air and felt as though I was very near death when I woke up.  I had
a hard time being able to tell the dream from reality since I was really
napping on the couch and dreamed I was napping on the couch.  Also, I had
NO strength, No energy, And could barely breath when I woke up.  I had to
fight for air.  I could not get up off the couch for a good while.  When
I did manage to move, I was only able to roll off the couch and land on my
knees where I remained for about 15 minutes before being able to stand. 
My lungs ached.  It was a LONG while before I felt normal, I know it was
a good 2 hours before I could breath and move normally.  </B>
<P><B>That never happened again (thank the good Lord).  But to this day,
if I voice the dream to anyone, I go through the breathing problem all over


again.  It is not to the extent of the dream or what I went through upon


awakening, But it does cause difficulty in my breathing.  Even though, I
do not like to speak of it.  But, I do wonder if this was how she died and
did her mother have the problem that I did and was not able to rescue her


beautiful little daughter. </B>
<P><B>This is the first time I've told this to anyone outside of very close


friends and family.  Not because I don't want to talk about her, because
I would to anyone that would listen.  But I know there are a lot of people
who would not believe and I don't have the time to try and explain that it
is fact.  I don't owe this to anyone.  But I would love to speak to anyone
that does believe.  I miss my sad little girl.  I wonder if she is still


wondering around sad and lonely or has she found her way to a happier time
and place.  I wish her well..........I wish her the happiness that she most


greatly deserves.</B>
<P><B>Again, thanks in advance to anyone that can give me the information
I need.</B>

<P>
<P><B>I don't think that this story is really interesting enough to put on</B>
<P><B>your web page, but I thought I'd send it nonetheless.</B>
<P><B>I have always been intrigued by the supernatural, and yet I have


always</B>
<P><B>been terrified by it (yes, I am 25 years old and still sleeping with


a</B>
<P><B>night light.) I can clearly remember seeing shadows run across walls</B>
<P><B>when no one was in the room, hearing strange sounds and seeing things</B>
<P><B>from the corner of my eyes...but nothing was ever as strange as


this...</B>
<P>
<P><B>About 4 years ago, a few people in my college dorm experienced


something</B>
<P><B>we could not explain.  It started with me sitting on my bed talking


to</B>
<P><B>my roommate. She was wearing a tight, scooped neck t-shirt and she


was</B>
<P><B>standing in the center of the room alone.  While she was talking, I</B>
<P><B>suddenly saw her shirt get pulled down off her shoulders and then get</B>
<P><B>pulled back up (there was no one around and it was impossible for her


to</B>
<P><B>have done it to herself with me right there watching) - just as I saw</B>
<P><B>this she stopped talking and let out a loud scream.  We both ran out


of</B>
<P><B>the room when suddenly from upstairs we heard another girl yelling.


 We</B>
<P><B>went upstairs to see what was going on, and found our friend</B>
<P><B>hysterically crying in her bathrobe. She said that while she was


putting</B>
<P><B>on her makeup she saw a face appear in the mirror in front of hers.


 SHe</B>
<P><B>could still see herself through the other face because it was</B>
<P><B>translucent - and it appeared just as she heard my roommate's and my</B>
<P><B>screams. She said the face had long black braided hair, and she


thought</B>
<P><B>it was a woman but she could not really be sure. </B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>About two years later, while visiting my sister at the same college</B>
<P><B>(although she was living in a different dorm) I heard stories about</B>
<P><B>students seeing a tall black man with long braids walking through the</B>
<P><B>halls of the campus buildings.  Two of my sister's roommates were </B>
<P><B>foreign exchange students from another country (I don't remember


exactly</B>
<P><B>from where) and they believed in the supernatural and often held


seances</B>
<P><B>and used Oijui boards - yet after trying to contact this spirit, they</B>
<P><B>became so spooked that they moved out of the building.  They wouldn't</B>
<P><B>even tell us what they had learned about the ghost.</B>

<P><B>I'm 15 years old, and my bedroom is haunted.  We moved in two years

<P><B>1: Lights flicker.  When I am in my room alone the light bulbs fall
from their sockets or they go on and off.</B>
<P><B>2: Closet door wont stay closed.  Even if I put my dresser in front
of it, it will be open in the morning</B>
<P><B>3: Strange light.  At night when everyone is asleep (even me) a strange


light darts across my room.  That wakes me up and then it disappears</B>
<P><B>4: Figure.  A young girl looks at me.  That really creeps me out</B>
<P><B>So that is why my room might be haunted.  The ghost is not evil but

</H3><P><B>by CCrum3@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My family inherited a really old house last year, its an old plantation.


When we moved  in we found a piano in the upstairs, it was a baby grand but
in very bad shape. We fell in love with the piano and had it rebuilt. We
put it in the downstairs parlor and there I would practice on it every day
after school, one night after i went to bed i heard the piano start playing..at


first i thought it was the cat walking across the keys because it was a jambled


up mess of notes, but then it turned into a classical peice...and it kept
playing and playing. I was the only one at home and i thought it was a robber
or some theif, so i didnt dare go downstairs, i stayed in my room for about
30 minutes, but then i got really really curious and decided to risk it and
take a peek to see what was going on...when i stepped out of my room the
playing stopped and i went downstairs to see a really old book on the stand
that i had never seen, i played the first couple notes and sure enough it
was the first notes of the song i had heard..I than felt this really wierd


feeling and it got real cold so i put the book back on the stand and went
back to bed....the next morning i told my brother and my parents but nobody


beleived me, so i went to get the book and it wasnt there, Ive never seen
the book since, but there was a tear of a page that had some of the notes
on it from the song, i showed them and they STILL didnt beleive me......OH
well, i still play the piano, and i dont know if the Ghost does or


not.</B><HR>

</H3><P><B>by zbazz@mail.teleport.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>For a long time I hesitated to write about these experiences.  I</B>
<P><B>was afraid that by thinking about them too much, I might somehow


start</B>
<P><B>them up again.</B>
<P><B>     First of all, I've read the other stories that have been


submitted</B>
<P><B>and some of them have very similar beings to the ones that I and


members</B>
<P><B>of my family have dealt with.  The information that I have on this


large</B>
<P><B>shadow who likes to stand around and scare everyone might be of some</B>
<P><B>interest to those who know who I'm talking about.  Also, if all he's</B>
<P><B>done to you is stand around and peek at you from a distance, then


you're</B>
<P><B>lucky.  He did a lot more than that to my mother when she was growing</B>
<P><B>up.  Pardon the the bad pun, but he is so to speak, a real creep.</B>
<P><B>     The other thing that I'll say before I get into the story I


have,</B>
<P><B>is that I believe that hauntings tend to evolve around certain people


or</B>
<P><B>families...not just in certain houses.  Often times ghosts tend to</B>
<P><B>follow a person or they are inherited like from mother to daughter.
</B>
<P><B>Then again some of us have the interest in them naturally and they


are</B>
<P><B>attracted to us because we know when they're around.</B>
<P><B>     When my mother was about 8 years old she live in Florida.  I


don't</B>
<P><B>know much about the house except that it was located next to an old</B>
<P><B>grave yard.  That may or may not have anything to do with what</B>
<P><B>happened...we don't know.  She doesn't remember when it started but


she</B>
<P><B>remember being woken up by something jumping on her bed.  This


happened</B>
<P><B>to her every night for close to a year.  She told my grandparents who


of</B>
<P><B>course thought she was only dreaming.</B>
<P><B>     Every night for that time period she would wake up to a huge


shadow</B>
<P><B>(it often would change shapes) of a cat or sometimes a man.  He would</B>
<P><B>jump up and down on her bed and do little "dances" on her walls.  For


a</B>
<P><B>while this was all that happened.</B>
<P><B>     One afternoon she had a bunch of friends over to play.  They


were</B>
<P><B>out on her front porch standing around.  My grandmother was watching</B>
<P><B>them from the kitchen window.  All of a sudden one of her friends


spoke</B>
<P><B>up and told her to "Look out!".  They all witnessed a very large


shadow</B>
<P><B>of a man step toward her and violently push off the porch.  My</B>
<P><B>grandmother saw it too and ran out to make sure she was all right.
 To</B>
<P><B>this day my grandmother denies seeing anything.  It scared her. 


After</B>
<P><B>that the night time shadow just became more and more persistant. </B>
<P><B>Finally, my mom being the strong willed person that she is had


decided</B>
<P><B>enough was enough.  One night she jumped up out of bed and caught the</B>
<P><B>shadow and as she put it, strangled him.  After that, he never came</B>
<P><B>back.</B>
<P><B>     It may sound pretty far out there but my mom is one of the most</B>
<P><B>sane people I know...she's a councilor, has a college degree and is


very</B>
<P><B>intelligent.  If she says it happened, I believe her.</B>
<P><B>     My story is less violent but for me, frightening in it's own


right.</B>
<P>
<P><B>     When I was 20, I left for college.  My mom had always warned me</B>
<P><B>about messing with Ouija boards but I'm curious.  I'm drawn to things</B>
<P><B>that I can't expain.  Using the Ouija, with a couple of friends I met


up</B>
<P><B>with a guy named "Zo".  Imediately he became Very hostile with me.
 He</B>
<P><B>called me things that I won't repeat and then he said something that</B>
<P><B>caught my attention...he spelled out "Pushed mom off porch".  None
of my</B>
<P><B>friends knew anything about this story and they had no idea what he


was</B>
<P><B>talking about.  Then he told me about my uncle who is a priest.  He


told</B>
<P><B>me about my boyfriend at the time.  He told me that "J" would marry</B>
<P><B>Lori.  For the record, one year later "J" married Lori.</B>
<P><B>     Then one of my friends did what your not supped to do...she


asked</B>
<P><B>him to prove he was there.  Starting that night I saw strange shadows


on</B>
<P><B>my wall.  For a long time I slept with my light on at night.</B>
<P><B>     One afternoon I came home to find my stereo turned way up, and


my</B>
<P><B>window wide open.  Both things I always checked before I left my room.


</B>
<P><B>When I walk in the hall way my best friend came out of her room and


said</B>
<P><B>"I thought you were home..I heard talking in there and your music is</B>
<P><B>on."  My door was locked and there was no one inside.</B>
<P><B>     At this point I told my mom and she yelled at me for having


messed</B>
<P><B>with the Ouija.  I did what I had always heard worked on spirits and


lit</B>
<P><B>a white candle and asked him to leave.</B>
<P><B>     For the most part he didn't come back.  To this day though,


every</B>
<P><B>once in a while I catch something out of the corner of my eye.  It's</B>
<P><B>like he  just likes to make sure I don't forget him.  I am no longer</B>
<P><B>afraid of him.  I ignor him and from what I've read he doesn't care


too</B>
<P><B>much because he has other people to pester.</B>
<P><B>     About "Zo"...he will go by many names but it is always him. 


From</B>
<P><B>what I was told but someone who knows about these things..he's a pest</B>
<P><B>because he's never been alive.  He's attracted to us because he


doesn't</B>
<P><B>understand us.  Knowing this may help some of you.  Light a white


candle</B>
<P><B>and ask him to leave...it might help a little.</B>

<P>
<P><B>In Opelousas,Louisiana, Brittany,my sister's friend,lives in a haunted

house.Her house is in front of a graveyard that has a grave that glows every

night.The name on the grave has been erased over the years because it has
been aging.The ghost of that grave lives up stairs,where Brittany's bedroom

is.Brittany has seen the ghost shoving her stuff off her dresser when she
was done putting it up there and the ghost also unplugs her radio at

night.Now,the ghost doesn't show up as much,but it's grave still glows.</B>
<P>
<P><B>          Also,in Opelousas,Louisiana,there is a house that me and
my friend ride to alot.We liked exploring the house until we noticed that
the attic started to make sounds like someone was walking around in the attic.We

both didn't want to see what it was,but I was curious and wanted to see what
was up there.I asked my friend to give me a boost and she did.I saw a greenish

colored light in the shape of a man.I told my friend what I saw when I got
down and then she looked and saw it,too.We still ride bikes on the street
and pass in front of the house and every time we do,we see the ghost staring
at us through the front window.</B>
<P>
<P><B>                  Also in Opelousas,my friend,also my neighbor which
is the one who I saw the ghost with,has a ghost problem,but not a person
ghost ,but a pet ghost,a pet that I knew.Her dog,Buster,was a little,black
dog that she loved very much.She even put a basket on her bike to put Buster

in.Well,anyway,Buster got runover and was still alive for awile,just enough
for him to make it to her back door.When he reached her back door,he just
fell over,dead as a doornail.Frances,my friend,cried the whole day.About
a week later,me and Frances were playing in the backyard until we heard a
crash in the barn.It wasn't any rat because the mess could only have been
done by a little dog.When we left the barn,we saw Buster running toward us
we knew that that would have to be impossible because Buster had already
been burried in a box that was nailed shut.As Buster was running toward us,he
was disappearing into thin air,but when I left,she called me on the phone
just to talk and while we were talking,a small dog was barking up stairs.I
asked her if that was a new dog and she said that if she got a new dog,that
would be the first thing she'd tell me.As years passed by,the dog left,but
would come back on the anniversary of his death.</B>
<P>
<P><B>             Even at schools there are ghosts, just like my old elementary

school,Grolee Elementary,which is also in Opelousas.In the 1800s,there used
to be a cemetary where the Grolee building is.Now,the ghosts of the cemetary
are haunting Grolee.I don't know if they still are because I don't go there

anymore,but I will find out.Well,back when I was in the third grade,We used
to haev freaky things happening in the class.Once,all of the doors and windows
in the classroom shut all at the same time.In the fourth grade,my principal's

picture has a mysterious shadowy type person standing on his right side in
the picture.This was announced on the intercom one day at school.Also,on
the playground,I saw a shadowy figure of a girl hang by a rope from a tree.In
the sixth grade,everything on the top shelf flew off the shelf and shattered
all over the floor.For everything,there was no explanation except that the
school had a poltergeist problem.</B>

<H3><A NAME=can>What Can it Be?</A>
</H3><P><B>by MayLily10@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My name is Bette and I live with my mom in Connecticut. We live in
a house that was built around 1920. My whole family has experienced some
very strange goings on in this house. It did not start until my dad was killed
in an accident at work. My parents  were not even married a year. They worked

together at the same factory where he was killed. My grandparents came to
live with us after it happened, my mom took it really hard. The nights of
the wake is when it first started. My grandparents were sleeping in the living

room and I came downstairs because I could not sleep. I cannot remember the

reason why. I layed on the living room rug, nanna on the couch, Grampa on
a roll away. You could here someone walking across the floor upstairs. I
asked my grandparents if they could hear it too, they told me not to worry,
it was just my dad. The weirdest thing was there is no floor above where
we heard the walking. Part of the living room was extended out from an old
sun portch and what is above the ceiling is just the outside roof that just

slants down. That was only one thing. Another is within that year my grandmother

went in the hospital with cancer. My grandfather was getting ready to go
see her. he was in our bathroom.He had a heart attack and died on the bathroom

floor. My mom found him. During the days of his wake, I woke up from a sound

sleep only to feel the end of my mattress starting to go down as if someone
just sat down. I was petrified and ran downstairs crying. Sixteen days later
my grandmother died in the hospital.  My mother and father used to have this

thing when they gave each other cards at the end they would sign it 4:00a.m..
It was something they shared between them. I can't tell you how many times
my mother has heard either a solid knock at her bedroom door which she keeps
shut at night or someone tapping her shoulder all about the same time . My

mothers old boyfriend died on the living room rug(alcoholic).I sleep on the
couch at night (disability reason). One night I had the pillow on my stomach
and I was wide awake and something yanked on the pillow really hard.My cat
sits on the back of the couch and will stare at the corner of the wall and
the ceiling for 15 min. at a time then his eyes will move like he is watching

something that is walking up the stairs. Before I became disabled, I would
not sleep upstairs anymore. I just was overwhelmed with this god awful feeling

that still scares the hell out of me! My nephew who was14 at the time he
moved in with us(2 years ago) has had his own scares and also has had his
own experiences upstairs. We both went to bed and the 2 rooms are side by
side. We both laid in our beds listening to some strange knocking sounds.Joey
is his name.One time he stayed at his mothers when my mom was in the hospital.
I was sleeping upstairs.A loud voice(male)yelled my name as plain as day,woke
me right up. I started screaming for my mom to come upstairs. I guess I was
in shock because I forgot she was not at home. It was that day since I did
not sleep upstairs anymore! I had a party at my house 6 years ago. I brought
my friends down cellar to show them my weights and exercise equipment. There
was this one kid Frankie that was suddenly so quite and then out of nowhere
says this house is haunted and wanted to get back upstairs. He did not know
about anything that had ever gone on in the house. I found that to be disturbing.

There was also one time we were gone all day, the cat was alone in the house.

When we came home and unlocked the door the cat just about clawed his way
out before we could open the door. He booked like he was scared out of his

witts!! He was never a very timid cat, but now the slightest movement or
loud noise sets him off. I don't know what is going on here and I'm not sure
I want too, but if it was just me that has seen or heard it, I would probably

dismiss it as an over active immagination, but it is not. I know this is
gonna sound strange but would it have anything to do with my Dads untimely
death? Or the deaths in the house? I even went as far as thinking it was
because our house number is 66 and we are the 6th house on the right. My
mom is very level headed and old fashioned. She now would like to know if
there is something going on? We don't say too much to anyone about it because

Joey is under our foster care and we don't want to loose him because people
might think we are losing it.  I don't think my cat will ever be the same!

<H3><A NAME=other>My Other Experience</A>
</H3><P><B>by Heathe5447@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have always been a little sensitive to things sometimes its bothersome

but other times it just becomes somthing I have learned to accept.... One
of my stories is on this site but this is the newest experience.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Recently we moved into an old home out in the country not far from
were I was raised.  Now I will add before I go further that I have not had

experiences with "ghosts" if you will in a long time My "gift " manifests
itself in other ways most of the time... Anyway the other night got a phone
call from a relitive as I almost always do I started to go outside with the
phone to have my smoke ( bad habbit )  Anyway it was about 9ish at night
and the door was closed As I went to turn the door It was as if Someone or

somthing was pulling on it from the other side Like it was locked or somthing!!!!

Try as I would it just would not open!  Just as I was about to give up and
ask my husband to open it....I looked down and the knob just turned!  Then
I tried the door agian and it worked!</B>
<P>
<P><B>I thought nothing of it, in fact as I said before you become used to
it that is till I started to remmber back to a night a few weeks back when
we were all out on the front porch ( we being my husband his buddy and I
) anyway.. We live on a main road .. we were relaxed just enjoying the summer

night and getting a little drunk when we started to talk of ghost's and such
I mentioned at that point that I got the "feeling" that a man in his mid
30's or so was across the road, My husband knows me so he didnt make fun
of me but his friend was telling me to tell it to give him a sign you know
"I dont belive it if I cant see it person"  well being in the present state
I was not about to toy with it not having my wits with me and besides I DONT
MESS WITH THINGS I DONT UNDERSTAND PERIOD! so I just blew it off but i could
not shake the feeling.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Back to the present, I was at my neighbors house telling her about
the door and she turned and yelled to her husband "hey!! How old was that
guy who killed himself on the road??? "He answered late 20's!!!!!  Now here

husband has lived here in the area since childhood I guess some guy about
20 years back or so ran his car into a tree going about 80 mph !  so hard
was the impact that it knocked the headlights intact right out of the car!!</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was at this point all of it kinda feel into place,  Now I dont know
if that was the guy I was "picking up on " nor do I know if thats who did
not want me to go outside.. but little things have been happening ever since
and I know being that had not ever heard that story ..... I grew up a good
20 miles from here!</B>
<P><B>Oh well not as interesting as the other one but I thought you would
enjoy it :)</B>

</H3><P><B>by Sup CD@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> I am a believer of spirits, ghost, as well as God.  I've had a couple
of experiences myself.  I remember one, in Jacksonville in Florida.  My family

and I were moving into a new house from NY (and we just moved back to NY
about a week ago) and we were staying at a Holiday Inn in Jacksonville until
we could find a house to live in.  We weren't there long, I think about 2
or 3 weeks.  Anyway, I remember waking up one morning, it was 6:24am (I remember

looking at the clock), and I saw my parents and siblings were sleeping. 
Then I saw some light next to the bed, and it was still dark outside.  After
a couple seconds it took a figure.  It looked like an alien-shaped figure
to me.  It was a blue-white glowing color, and you could see through it a
little, but it was mostly solid.  It had a weird shaped face, with a big
head and big eyes..I've actually seen the face on some books written about

aliens.  It had 4 or 5 fingers..very long fingers.  It lifted up it's left
hand and it seemed to be waving to me.  Me, being terrified (I was about
9 years old), put the covers over my face.  About 10 seconds later, I peaked
a little, and I could still see a glow.  So then I prayed that God take the
ghost away, and then I peaked again.  I didn't see anything, so I took the
covers off my face, and it was gone.  Then I jumped in the bed my mom and
dad were in, and went to sleep there.  Looking back, I'm not sure why I didn't

scream, or wake up my parents and let them see it.  My mom says she also

remembers waking up one night and seeing one of the pictures hanging above
the beds glowing.  Since I've been 12 I've been wanting to see another ghost,
and try to talk to it and help it if it needs it.  I haven't had any encounters

since.  I really don't know if that was a ghost of a human, or maybe a ghost
of some other kind of being, or maybe a hologram of an outer-space creature.
 I also remember a siting..when I was being baptised at my church when I
was 6 or 7, I remember looking up right after the water was put on me into
one of the windows, right in front of me.  I saw a black spirit, holding

something in it's hand..looked like some kind of knife or a dagger.  I saw
my shadow, and it looked like it was trying to stab into me.  Like it just
got kicked out of my body and it was trying to get back in.</B>
