<P>
<P><B>Yes, sir.  I have had an experience with a entity.  Although I have
no </B>
<P><B>pictures, please let me tell you the story.</B>
<P><B>I came home one night and sat on my bed.  I removed my shoes, and they
</B>
<P><B>hit the floor lying on their sides.  A few seconds later, I looked
down </B>
<P><B>and noticed one shoe lean up against the chair leg.In astonishment,
I </B>
<P><B>freaked.  I had never seen anything like it.</B>
<P><B>I found out that the house I was living in used to be a little chapel
a </B>
<P><B>long time ago.  After that, the place was used for a painting studio.
 </B>
<P><B>And a few years later, several dogs were acidentally killed in a </B>
<P><B>electrical fire just meters from the house.  </B>
<P><B>Everytime I walk into the house, I get a cold sensation in it.  I have
</B>
<P><B>also felt feelings of pain and anguish when I entered the threshhold.
 I </B>
<P><B>can't explain it, but I believe the house has a restless entity(s)
</B>
<P><B>roaming within.</B>
<P><B>I am no longer in this home due to unfortunate circumstances, but </B>
<P><B>everytime I think about it, it sends chills up and down my spine.</B>

<H3><A NAME=kin>My Ghostly Kin</A>
</H3><P><B>by pkulas@iserv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I haven't lived for a great many years yet and have already had too
many </B>
<P><B>ghostly experiences and I beleive that this may be only so far....
   </B>
<P><B>When I was 2 months old we moved out of our small apartment and into
a 2 </B>
<P><B>story, grey house That we call"The grey House" and everyone knows what
</B>
<P><B>house we mean. This was, for the most part, my childhood house and
like </B>
<P><B>any child I refused to go into the basement alone. I had was the middle
</B>
<P><B>child of one brother(older than me by 2 years)and 1 sister(younger
than </B>
<P><B>me by 2 years). We were really active,always playing and romping and
</B>
<P><B>everything else. Our dining room was a good size and We weren'trich
so </B>
<P><B>we didn't have alot of china or anything in there. It was cozy and
there </B>
<P><B>was plenty of room to play.Very occasionally when I played in there
I </B>
<P><B>would see, out of the corner of my eye, a little girl of about , oh,
</B>
<P><B>anywhere from 8-10 years old. And she would do cartwheels. I never
saw </B>
<P><B>her face but she had long hair and was wearing a dress from the </B>
<P><B>1800's.Everything about her pointed torward the 1800's. I also ,just
a </B>
<P><B>few times saw a little chinese boy out of the corner of my eye-from
</B>
<P><B>about the same time also doing cart wheels. when I saw them I always
</B>
<P><B>thought that I was seeing things. We had an attic and the door was
close </B>
<P><B>to my bedroom so at night I would hear things up there. Sometimes I
</B>
<P><B>would imagine i heard a little girl giggling up there. There is one
</B>
<P><B>night in particular that I remember (Even though it happened more than
</B>
<P><B>once) getting up in the middle of the night and telling my mom I </B>
<P><B>couldn't get to sleep because the T.V. was too loud"I can hear them
</B>
<P><B>giggling on their T.V., mom", I said. But the T.V. which was right
by my </B>
<P><B>moms room wasn't on and she was in her room.    I lived in that house
</B>
<P><B>from the time I was 2 months until I was 10 years old. These things
</B>
<P><B>happened up until the time we moved out when I was 10 years old. We
</B>
<P><B>moved into an apartment which was for a very short time. In the first
</B>
<P><B>week that we lived there, the four of us(My mom, sister Gina and Brother
</B>
<P><B>Trever ,and myself)were sitting down on the couch together(on the floor
</B>
<P><B>near it. The t.V. was off and it was night time so the lights were
dim. </B>
<P><B>My mom said "since we're moved out of the Grey House now I can tell
you </B>
<P><B>something. I didn't want to tell you while we were still living there"
</B>
<P><B>She was even hesitant to tell us still but finally she did. She said
</B>
<P><B>that while we were living there,from the time that we moved in , she
had </B>
<P><B>these kind of experiences. she went on. I remember her telling us that
</B>
<P><B>at times when us kids were outside playing she would hear a little
girl </B>
<P><B>giggling upstairs.My mom said that that happened alot and she remembers
</B>
<P><B>me coming downstairs that night complaining of the T.V. She said that
</B>
<P><B>she would hear the little girl playing and giggles upstairs as if having
</B>
<P><B>a little tea party with a friend. More times than others,she sayed,the
</B>
<P><B>girl was alone but sometimes she wouls hear what sounded like a little
</B>
<P><B>boy with her. The giggling was always heard in the stair way or upstairs
</B>
<P><B>and ALWAYS with a dim light. Sometimes my mom would go upstairs and
our </B>
<P><B>toys that we hadn't played with would be out or our bed that had been
</B>
<P><B>made would look all jumped on and wrinkled up. And we either hadn't
been </B>
<P><B>playing upstairs or hadn't been home to do it. This went on until one
</B>
<P><B>time we were in the front yard playing and my mom heard her up there.
</B>
<P><B>She decided that she was tired of it,and she didn't want us to hear
it </B>
<P><B>and be scared so she confronted it.She said "-I've had enough, you
can </B>
<P><B>live in this house with us if you want to but I am the parent and you
</B>
<P><B>are the child and you are to behave yourself.I don't want to hear </B>
<P><B>anymore out of you" And from that time on -she didn't. Never heard
a </B>
<P><B>peep.At this time (sitting on the couch in the apartment)my brother
had </B>
<P><B>a very surprised look on his face. He said That sinca he can remember,
</B>
<P><B>he would be playing in the dining room or something and would,out of
the </B>
<P><B>corner of his eye, see aliitle chinese boy that looked about from the
</B>
<P><B>1800's.And he would do cartwheels. These are the reasons I know that
</B>
<P><B>what i saw and heard was real. It was a ghost.WE have talked about
it </B>
<P><B>since and come up with different sinarios. We found out that our house
</B>
<P><B>used to be a barn behind our neighbors house. It was as old as back
in </B>
<P><B>the 1800's. So my favorite sinario is that the little girl was hiding
</B>
<P><B>the little chinese boy stow away in her barn. One time they were doing
</B>
<P><B>cartwheels in the hay loft and fell through. Maybe they would have
</B>
<P><B>little tea party and giggle up in the loft. It has been years since
I we </B>
<P><B>moved out of that house. We live in the next city now as we have since
</B>
<P><B>about 6 months after we moved out of the grey house. Whenever we go
to </B>
<P><B>that city I have my mom drive by the old house that I still miss. I
</B>
<P><B>often wonder what ever happened to the kids. Do they still linger in
</B>
<P><B>that house. What is there unfinished business?   I hope to find out
</B>
<P><B>someday. I have another ghost story from another house-not quite so
</B>
<P><B>friendly and will be harder to tell but I'll try to find the time.</B>

<H3><A NAME=ambulance>Ambulance Ghosts</A>
</H3><P><B>by ims@clo.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>My name is Walter and I am a Paramedic in Ajax,Ontario,Canada. It is
a </B>
<P><B>foregone conclusion that our Ajax Ambulance Station is inhabited by
</B>
<P><B>beings of a supernatural nature. Late at night usually around 3am,
on </B>
<P><B>occasion, a few of the Paramedics have experiences with these beings.
</B>
<P><B>These experiences range from toilets flushing, pots and pans being
</B>
<P><B>thrown down the hallway from the kitchen, pillows flying through the
</B>
<P><B>air, many occasions of something heavy "sitting" on people to the point
</B>
<P><B>where these Paramedics are unable to get up from bed, shaking beds,
loud </B>
<P><B>doglike barking in the ears of sleeping Paramedics while they are pinned
</B>
<P><B>down (This incidence has only occurred once, and the Paramedic refused
</B>
<P><B>to work at the station for approx.1 year). This is a summary of the
</B>
<P><B>events that had taken place over the last 20-25 years. One Paramedic
had </B>
<P><B>even quit his job because of these incidents. I hope this letter is
of </B>
<P><B>interest to you, as these events are 100% genuine. I have the same
</B>
<P><B>passion for ghosts as you do, and I thoroughly enjoyed your web site.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Historical Note: The Ambulance station used to be part of the hospital
 </B>
<P><B>                 in which, as part of my investigation, many people
have</B>
<P><B>                 died.</B>

<H3><A NAME=attic>Ghost in the Attic</A>
</H3><P><B>by JJLA@snet.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>I'd like to share an experience my mom had that she has related to
me a </B>
<P><B>couple of times when I was younger.  When she was a young girl in the
</B>
<P><B>late 1940's in Germany, she lived in an apartment with her parents
and </B>
<P><B>two older sisters.  She and her sisters shared a bedroom in the attic.
 </B>
<P><B>She said that on some nights, she would be visited by a monk-like figure
</B>
<P><B>in a robe and hood who put his hands around her neck and try to strangle
</B>
<P><B>her.  She could never see its face, being obscured by the hood.  She
</B>
<P><B>always knew the nights when these visitations would occur because she
</B>
<P><B>would be awakened by a light shining in her face, and would then hear
</B>
<P><B>slow footsteps coming up the attic stairs.  Too paralyzed with fear
to </B>
<P><B>move, (or maybe by something else), she could only lie there and wait
and </B>
<P><B>watch helplessly until it made its appearance.  She even tried to </B>
<P><B>trick it one night by ducking down under the covers to the foot of
the </B>
<P><B>bed, but it only lifted the covers at that end instead! Her sisters
never </B>
<P><B>awoke to see what was going on, and she couldn't tell her parents (my
</B>
<P><B>grandparents), who were very strict, and she might get punished for
</B>
<P><B>"telling stories".  The experiences didn't cease until they finally
moved </B>
<P><B>away.  To this day, it still bothers her to talk about it, but she
has </B>
<P><B>considered going to a hypnotist to see if it really happened or not,
but </B>
<P><B>she is a afraid it will somehow find her again.</B>
<P><B>Anyhow, this story always gave me the willies, as it's one of the the
</B>
<P><B>only "firsthand" experiences I have ever heard, unfortunately.  Except
</B>
<P><B>for my sister's friend, who lives in an old house in New Milford, CT,
and </B>
<P><B>who sometimes hears a ghostly baby crying coming up from the basement
</B>
<P><B>from a hole in her fireplace.  &lt;&lt;shudder&gt;&gt; :}</B>

<H3><A NAME=one>My One Experience</A>
</H3><P><B>by KaitlynD@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have had just one short experience of my own to tell.  It was at
a friend's house which was very old and has recently been condemed and torn
down.  I was there one night alone house sitting.  I should, before I go
on with my story, explain the interior of this house.  The front door led
to a long hallway which had a set of stairs that led to the second floor
where there were two bedrooms.  If you traveled down the hallway past the
stairs you would come to a door that led to the rest of the house.  The living
room was on the other side of the hallway wall.  It was in the livingroom
where I sat that night watching tv.  It was getting late and I heard the
front door open and close and footsteps go up the stairs.  I then thought
my friend had come home early.  I went out into the hallway and up the stairs
to her bedroom where I found the light and tv on but she was no where to
be found.  I knew that the light and tv had not been on earlier but I shut
them off and went back down stairs with no real explanation of what I had
heard and why the and tv was on.  The whole night I just tried to rationalize
hearing the door open and close, the footsteps up the stairs, and the tv
and light being on; but I did not, after that night, have any further
experiences.  I did tell my friend when she came home of my experience and
she asked me while grinning "you mean I didn't tell you the house was haunted?"
 I am sure that she just dismissed what I had told her but I can't dismiss
what I experienced.  </B>

<H3><A NAME=clover>Cloverdale's Ghost</A>
</H3><P><B>by BRADDOCK@hershey.pvt.k12.pa.us </B>
<P>
<P><B>I don't know if you can really call these ghost incidents, but it was
</B>
<P><B>enough to scare us.  We live in Milton Hershey which is a private school
</B>
<P><B>for social orphan children.  I'm a houseparent's son so while the </B>
<P><B>students went to their real homes for vacation, I stayed there because
</B>
<P><B>that was home to me.  There was a rumor that a boy hung himself in
the </B>
<P><B>attic of the house, but we could never get it confirmed or denied.
 </B>
<P><B>		The first thing that happened was mom and one of the students were
in </B>
<P><B>the house by themselves.  They were both sitting in the kitchen when
</B>
<P><B>they heard somebody run down the stairs, run back up and slam a door.
 </B>
<P><B>The student ran outside she was that scared and when dad got back he
</B>
<P><B>looked around, but nothing was there.  </B>
<P><B>		The second thing that happened was the students were home on vacation
</B>
<P><B>and mom was checking their rooms.  It was dark out and as she walked
</B>
<P><B>down the hallway she felt a hand on her shoulder.  She turned around
</B>
<P><B>thinking it was dad, but nobody was there.  There weren't even any
rooms </B>
<P><B>to duck into it was just walls.</B>
<P><B>			There was a closet door upstairs that would never stay shut.  We
</B>
<P><B>would shut it, walk in a room and when we came back out the door would
</B>
<P><B>be open again.  The students would shut it and it still always came
</B>
<P><B>open.  We locked it, we put stuff in front of it, but it still came
</B>
<P><B>open.  It would stay closed as long as we stood there, but as soon
as we </B>
<P><B>left, it would pop open again.</B>
<P><B>		Probably the scariest thing happened in the basement.  There is a
big </B>
<P><B>room down there that is split in half.  The ping pong table was on
one </B>
<P><B>side and the TV and stereo were on the other.  You had to walk through
a </B>
<P><B>door into the ping pong side, then walk through an opening into the
</B>
<P><B>other side of the room so there was only one way in.  While we were
</B>
<P><B>playing ping pong (there was four of us) the radio came on just long
</B>
<P><B>enough for us to run around to the other side.  Just before we came
into </B>
<P><B>view of it, it shut off.  We looked at it and here it was on tape,
so it </B>
<P><B>couldn't have been playing the radio like it was.  Like everything
else </B>
<P><B>there was no one hiding or playing tricks.</B>
<P><B>	The home has since been remodeled.  We haven't had any problems since
</B>
<P><B>then.</B>

<H3><A NAME="white dog">The White Dog</A>
</H3><P><B>by katyc@ids2.idsonline.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>At eight years old I awoke in the middle of the night hearing a dog</B>
<P><B>barking in the back yard. I looked out a window in the back yard and</B>
<P><B>saw a white dog barking. I woke my mother and told her that whitey
was </B>
<P><B>out in the back yard (she was out white pit bull). She asured me that</B>
<P><B>whitey was inside and brought her into the room. I told her that
there</B>
<P><B>was a white dog in our fenced in back yard. She looked out the window</B>
<P><B>and said she saw nothing. I then had her turn off the light and look</B>
<P><B>again. She didn't see the dog. She then went back to bed and the dog</B>
<P><B>began to bark again. I looked out the window and saw the white dog</B>
<P><B>again. Until some years later I realized that the back yard was
really</B>
<P><B>dark and unless the dog was lit up I couldn't have seen such a bright</B>
<P><B>white color. I'm just wondering if anyone has ever had such a thing</B>
<P><B>happen.</B>

<H3><A NAME=mansfield>Ghost in Mansfield</A>
</H3><P><B>by Billybobbo@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am going to write a story relating to the college that I attended
this past semester, Mansfield University in Mansfield, PA. This story is
known by everyone who ever attended Mansfield.  I hope it will give you the
chills as much as it did to me!</B>
<P><B>Sarah</B>
<P><B>There is a building on the campus called North Hall.  This was built
in the late 1800's &amp; used as a female dormitory until it was condemned
for demolition in the 1970's.  The building was saved &amp; opened as a
multimedia library in the Fall Semester of 1996, filled with books &amp;
over 100 computers for students to use for writing term papers or for access
to the Internet.  Well, back in the 1910's (I'm pretty sure it was then),
it was still being used as a female dorm.  North Hall has a huge stairwell
in the middle of the building that spans all six floors of the building.
  This has inspired many events, such as all the girls gathering at the stairwell
on their respective floors &amp; caroling, or maybe even someone telling
a story, possibly one of the supernatural.  Well, one evening, Sarah, who
lived in North Hall &amp; was a major of the piano &amp; voice came to the
stairwell.  For no particular reason, she began to sing.  This attracted
many of the girls to the stairwell.  They listened &amp; some began to join
in.  Before long, just about all the girls were singing with Sarah, whose
voice still remained supreme among them all.  I do not know exactly how this
next part happened.  Either she was sitting on the banister of the stairwell
(as many did.  I''ve seen pictures) or if she was just standing too close.
 However, she hit such an awesome key in the tune she was singing that she
put her total effort into it.  This caused her to lose her balance &amp;
fall to the bottom of the stairwell.  Sarah was killed instantly as she hit
the hard-wood floors.  There were reports that she sang the whole way down,
not even letting death take away her beautiful pitch that she had accumulated
that fatal moment.  Well, it turns out that the image of Sarah's body never
left that hard-wood floor.  It was as if you could see an outline of where
her body landed.  The bottom floor of North Hall became carpeted soon!  
However, this could not keep Sarah out of North Hall. Throughout the rest
of the century, people have reported seeing her in the building &amp; from
outside the building.  There were also reports of a piano playing even after
all the pianos in the building were transferred to the new music center.
 I guess that reports became too much for school officials, because psychic
investigators have made a journey through North Hall on more than one occasion.
 During my stay at Mansfield, I was in North Hall on the Internet.  I was
having an enjoyable time.  I hadn't had internet access before.  Well, suddenly
this strange feeling came over me.  I got the chills very bad.  For some
reason, I had the feeling that someone was watching me.  I turned around
 to see who was there, but there was no one.  Well, I peered over the top
of the study carroll behind me, but no one was there.  I looked back along
the row.  No one!  I looked forward.  Again, no one!  It was late at night
&amp; I was all alone on the southern wing on the fourth floor.  I became
so scared.  I quickly packed my belongings &amp; got out of there as fast
as I could.  I always felt weird there after that.  I can't be sure if it
was anything behind me.  However, I wasn't about to give anyone or anything
the chance to present themselves to me!  This was the story of Sarah, the
ghost of North Hall.  Ask anyone who attended Mansfield about her.  They'll
be sure to tell you about her.  Many people have seen her too.  This is a
believer!!  So, believe it!</B>

<H3><A NAME=barrell>The Man in the Barrell</A>
</H3><P><B>by kmiller@kenrich.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>My story starts in 1969. I was five years old.  My brother and I
shared</B>
<P><B>a bedroom. Our twin beds were arranged side-by-side with the foot of
the</B>
<P><B>beds facing our door which entered into the upstairs hallway. If you</B>
<P><B>were in our room and facing the doorway, to the right of the door hung
a</B>
<P><B>picture of a map of the World.  If you were laying in our beds, to
your</B>
<P><B>right would have been our closet door.  This was a walk in closet.
 I am</B>
<P><B>describing the layout so you can get a sense of how this all seem to</B>
<P><B>happen.  Anyway, my bed was the one nearest to the closet door.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The first time I saw the man in the barrell, it was around 3:00 am.
It</B>
<P><B>was a summer night in Iowa, not too hot, not too cool.  I awoke and
saw</B>
<P><B>something that has periodically haunted me to this day.  I am now 32</B>
<P><B>years old.  To describe this figure will take some work.  The figure</B>
<P><B>looked very much like a troll.  He appeared to be approximately 2 to
3</B>
<P><B>feet tall.  He seemed to either be wearing a barrell or standing
inside</B>
<P><B>it.  His feet were exposed outside the bottom of the barrell and he
was</B>
<P><B>wearing shoes much like that of an elf. The toes of the shoes curled
at</B>
<P><B>the ends. At the top of the barrell, straps were connected and hung
over</B>
<P><B>his shoulders. He had very sharp and long finger nails, dirty hands
and</B>
<P><B>arms, jagged, sharp teeth, a very long dirty beard, and wore a hat
that,</B>
<P><B>now as I reflect back looked like something from a Rumplestiltskin
fairy</B>
<P><B>tale. The hat had a round brim and a long pointed top. His eyes were</B>
<P><B>eerie and piercing, a gray color with pupils shaped like a cat's but
as</B>
<P><B>black as the devil's.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This troll figure appear at approximately the same time on each of
his</B>
<P><B>visits to haunt me and was almost always floating in front of the map
of</B>
<P><B>the World.  He was pointing his finger at me, floating up and down
very</B>
<P><B>slowly.  He was laughing but no noise was heard.  I can remember
quickly</B>
<P><B>covering my head with my sheets during this first encounter. Hoping
that</B>
<P><B>when I uncovered by head he would be gone and I would be dreaming.
 When</B>
<P><B>I removed the sheets from my head, he was indeed gone.  However, for</B>
<P><B>about a period of year, from night to night, this man would return
and I</B>
<P><B>would go through the same routine of covering my head.  Usually, when
I</B>
<P><B>saw him he would be in front of that map.  On other occassions, he
would</B>
<P><B>be to my right, in front of our closet door. Always, he was laughing
and</B>
<P><B>pointing at me, never really talking or explaining why he was
tormenting</B>
<P><B>me. No noise was ever made.</B>
<P>
<P><B>During many nights, just before I was fully awake, I knew he was there.
</B>
<P><B>I didn't even have to look to know.  I could feel his presence.
 Several</B>
<P><B>times, I would wake up my brother, yelling and asking my brother if
he</B>
<P><B>could see him.  My brother, older than me, would tell me to go back
to</B>
<P><B>sleep as I was just imaging him.  To this day, my brother can
describe</B>
<P><B>in as clear of detail as I can, how this man looked.  The reason he
can</B>
<P><B>is because in the middle of the night, while I was looking at this
man I</B>
<P><B>would describe him to my brother to convince him the ghost was there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had told my parents about seeing this man and asked them to remove
the</B>
<P><B>map of the World from the wall as I felt this might have something
to do</B>
<P><B>with seeing him.  They took down the map but the man kept coming back.
</B>
<P><B>I asked them to move me into what was our guest room.  They agreed
to my</B>
<P><B>wishes but things only got worse.  In that room there was also a walk
in</B>
<P><B>closet.  If you can picture a clothes bar that was hung with "U"
shaped</B>
<P><B>wall mounts, the clothes bar rested in those mounts connected to the</B>
<P><B>wall.  One night a loud crash came from my closet, I ran to my
parents</B>
<P><B>room without investigating first.  I woke them and they went to my</B>
<P><B>room's closet.  When they opened the door, everthing was laying on
the</B>
<P><B>floor.  The shelves that held my games and toys and the clothes bar
and</B>
<P><B>all my clothes.  How this all came crashing down, nobody knows, but
I</B>
<P><B>have a strong suspicion it was the man I had been seeing.  For
several</B>
<P><B>nights from that day forward he would return to laugh at me and haunt</B>
<P><B>me.  Although I haven't had visits from him since we moved from that</B>
<P><B>house in Iowa, I can still remember the chills he gave me.</B>

<H3><A NAME=dead>Contacting the Dead</A>
</H3><P><B>by asthom@ieighty.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>A long time ago, when I was just thirteen years old, I had a
terrifying</B>
<P><B>experience.  My mom had died at a very young age, a few months earlier.
I was so</B>
<P><B>devasted about my loss, I wanted to talk to my mom again, to see if
she was alright</B>
<P><B>and happy. I know I was not happy. I was hanging around with my friends,
not</B>
<P><B>doing much of anything, when one of them said they wanted to contact
the dead.</B>
<P><B>My eyes opened wide to the prospect of talking to my mom again and
I heard </B>
<P><B>myself saying, yes, lets do it. We planned our big night for the night
of</B>
<P><B>Halloween.  One of the friends parents were going out for the evening,
we had the house</B>
<P><B>to ourselves. Their was eight of us and we were excited as the big
night</B>
<P><B>approached.  Around seven, that evening, we all entered the house,
laughing and</B>
<P><B>giggling, thinking this would be kinda stupid, not wanting to make
fools of ourselves in front</B>
<P><B>of the guy's, we sat around the huge oval table. Then the guy's said
they needed a leader</B>
<P><B>of some sort, the one to do the talking and comunicating. I was a quiet
shy girl,</B>
<P><B>who kinda sat in the backround, just watching my friends. (I was still
crying over my</B>
<P><B>loss) Then to my horror, the guy's pointed at me and said I had to
do the</B>
<P><B>talking.  I begged and pleaded with them, to no avail, I lost that
one straight away.</B>
<P><B>Well, we all positioned ourselves (me at the head of the table) and
the</B>
<P><B>guy's on one side, the girls on the other.(one of the guy's was eighteen
years old)</B>
<P><B>We all joined hands, with a candle burning in the centre of the table,
we</B>
<P><B>started to laugh out loud. (nerves) This went on a few times, untill
one of the girls</B>
<P><B>shouted out that we should not mess with the spirit world as they would
get angry, then</B>
<P><B>we end up with an evil spirit. Concenrate, she shouted again. Ask only
for</B>
<P><B>a good spirit, she told me.  I said I was going to ask for my mom,
my friend said she wanted her</B>
<P><B>Grandmother and another, their Uncle. But I started asking for my mom,
in</B>
<P><B>my mind, as I was asking out loud for a spirit, a friendly spirit to
come upon us.</B>
<P><B>I do not know whether I fell asleep or went into a deep trance, I do
know I</B>
<P><B>was not with my friends at that time. I felt scared and my body was
trembling and I</B>
<P><B>could not move. It felt like something or someone was holding my body
down, frozen in</B>
<P><B>time. I could not open my eyes, I could not talk and I could not move.
I honestly</B>
<P><B>thought I was dead. In the next moment, I felt like someone had slapped
me hard, I</B>
<P><B>fell back out of my chair and stood up, rubbing my eyes, I looked up
to see my friend</B>
<P><B>flying through the air. This room was twentysix feet long and no-one
was holding</B>
<P><B>her.  I looked around to see where everybody was and they sat in the
chairs with</B>
<P><B>utter disbelieve on their faces, scared was not a word I could possibly
use, for</B>
<P><B>what I seen their faces. My friend stopped above the T.V, still in
the air, she looked</B>
<P><B>asleep, not knowing what was happening to her. She fell on top of the
T.V, with a</B>
<P><B>sickening thud, but still did not wake from the comatosed state she
was in.</B>
<P><B>How could she of not? I was horrorfied and scared, the spot I was standing
in, seemed glued</B>
<P><B>to my shoes,not letting me move. My friend then lifted back into the
air,</B>
<P><B>up to the ceiling and flew across to the side of the room and fell
down</B>
<P><B>into the sofa. We all managed to move and ran towards her,the heavy
coffee</B>
<P><B>table lifted of the ground and got thrown on top of her body. The
eighteen</B>
<P><B>year old shouted,"What is going on" and lifted the table of her. My
friend</B>
<P><B>then started to thrash out, as if to ward someone away from her and</B>
<P><B>shouting "NO,NO,NO, I promise, I will never do it again, please leave
me</B>
<P><B>alone. I remember myself and a few others running out of that house,
not</B>
<P><B>looking back, even the girls who lived in the house ran from it. I
do not</B>
<P><B>know who stayed with our friend, but I do know that our group of
friends</B>
<P><B>never talked again, about that night. We also did not play with the
spirits again and never</B>
<P><B>returned to the house down my street. I will wait to talk to my mom,
there</B>
<P><B>is a time and place for everything and everyone.</B>

<H3><A NAME=tall>The Tall Stranger</A>
</H3><P><B>by StreetmanC@ten-nash.ten.k12.tn.us </B>
<P>
<P><B>My family has lived in West Central Georgia since the late 1820's and
</B>
<P><B>this is a story I heard when I was a child, and it must have taken
</B>
<P><B>place in the early 20th century.</B>
<P><B>Two of my young single male relatives had walked to visit someone one
</B>
<P><B>Saturday night.  On the way back home, on a sandy, unpaved country
</B>
<P><B>road, they met a tall stranger.  The moon was shining brightly, and
</B>
<P><B>they saw him coming quite a few yards before he reached them.  From
</B>
<P><B>their description, he must have been at least seven feet tall.</B>
<P><B>When they neared the stranger, both spoke but he ignored them and </B>
<P><B>continued to walk on with his eyes straight ahead.  They stopped and
</B>
<P><B>turned in the road to watch him until he was out of sight, then they
</B>
<P><B>continued on to their home.</B>
<P><B>The next morning after breakfast, they decided that such a tall man
</B>
<P><B>must have taken some exceptionally long strides, so they went back
to </B>
<P><B>the place where they had encountered him.  They found their own tracks
</B>
<P><B>where they had turned to watch the stranger go out of sight, but they
</B>
<P><B>never found a single one of the tall, quiet stranger's tracks.</B>
<P><B>That's the whole story.  They never were able to explain it but both
</B>
<P><B>swore to the incident.</B>
