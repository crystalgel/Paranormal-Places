<b>Babysitting Ghosts</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: DRWILL58@uswest.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was younger I was baby-sitting for a friend. I had the weirdest</b>
<br><b>experience. I was in a haunted house. We lived with my grandparence
and</b>
<br><b>I was baby-sitting for my friend bobby.She lived in a two story</b>
<br><b>victorian house in california, on this street there are alot of
houses</b>
<br><b>that are over a 100 years old. The house was made into an apartment.
The</b>
<br><b>downstairs was one and the upstairs is the outher. Both families
in the</b>
<br><b>house knew each other and had gone out together and I was watching
the</b>
<br><b>kids. We were upstairs and It was getting late. We were all in the
front</b>
<br><b>room when I herd a noise. All the lights were out except the one
in the</b>
<br><b>living room. I left the kids there and I went to see what wa going
on.</b>
<br><b>The noise was coming from the kitchen. I went in slowly and turned
the</b>
<br><b>light on. All the coubards and drawers were open and the sink faucet
was</b>
<br><b>on. It was cold in the room and it gave me the creeps. I closed</b>
<br><b>everything and shut off the faucet. I shut off the light as I went
back</b>
<br><b>to the living room. Ten minutes later it happen again. By that time
I</b>
<br><b>was getting nervous because I was going to be there all night. There</b>
<br><b>parence were not going to be home till morning. The kids were ok
but</b>
<br><b>getting scared. Then I herd water running. I got up an followed
the</b>
<br><b>noise. Some one had turned on the tub faucet. all the kids were
with me</b>
<br><b>so I knew it wasn't them. It kept happening, every time I would
turn it</b>
<br><b>off and leave the room it would come on again. so I shut it off
and</b>
<br><b>yelled out " leave it off!" . I left the light on and went back
into the</b>
<br><b>living room with the kids. They were all scared and didn't want
to go to</b>
<br><b>bed in there own rooms they wanted to stay with me. So we stayed
in the</b>
<br><b>living room, I had gotten there blankets and pillows and they went
to</b>
<br><b>sleep on the floor. At about 2a.m. I had just started to dose off,
when</b>
<br><b>I heard kids playing on the stairs. I sat up and turned the light
on and</b>
<br><b>did a head count. all the kids were still there. bobby had woken
up I</b>
<br><b>told her to be quiet. I could tell that it was a little boy and
girl by</b>
<br><b>there voices. So I went and opened the door and looked towards the</b>
<br><b>stairs I could faintly make out two figures but not that well. They
were</b>
<br><b>laughing and giggling and playing tag. Bobby was terrified and started</b>
<br><b>to cry so I turned on the hall lights and they were gone. it was
quiet.</b>
<br><b>Sojust to make sure that I wasn't hearing things I turned off the
lights</b>
<br><b>again and waited and watched. Within a few minutes they were back.
By</b>
<br><b>now all the other kids were awake so I turned on all the lights
that</b>
<br><b>were upstairs and we slept that way. No one in m family has believed
me</b>
<br><b>but my sister. It has been years sense that happened and I always
think</b>
<br><b>about it. Why were they there. I have always been interested in
things</b>
<br><b>that can't be explained, its nice to tell my story to someone who</b>
<br><b>believes in it to.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Devils Music</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: xtreme13@rochester.rr.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother has long accused me of listening to
what she callls the</b>
<br><b>devil's music. It is really the music genre heavy metal. i started
listening</b>
<br><b>to it when i was about 13, the same year i got an electric guitar,
then when</b>
<br><b>i turned 14 i began playing the loud harsh music on my guitar, thus
my mom</b>
<br><b>made me play it in the basement, now our house is brand new and
we are the</b>
<br><b>first owners, but whenever i play this music something happens.
it has only</b>
<br><b>occured when i was alone down there but it has been creepy. ive
seen</b>
<br><b>everything from falling pens and game peices to my amplifier shutting
off</b>
<br><b>automaticly. the most recent occurence, also the freakyest has been
3</b>
<br><b>strings popping simotaneously (excuse my spelling). also my cd tower
has</b>
<br><b>tipped over and cds have broken. i have no idea why this happens
but when i</b>
<br><b>leave i sometimes get the feeling something is chasing me up the
steps. i</b>
<br><b>sprint up them as fast as possibe everytime, and i scares me s***less.
if</b>
<br><b>anything furthur happens i'll be sure to post it but i want to say
i am</b>
<br><b>determind to solve this by myself, i mean, there could be a rash
explanation</b>
<br><b>for all this but truely i dont think so.</b>

<br><b>A Ghost in Arkansas</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: BrenOODave@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happened many years ago, in 1982.&nbsp; My ex-husband was stationed
at Little</b>
<br><b>Rock AFB in Jacksonville, AR.&nbsp; We lived in a nice, three bedroom
ranch style</b>
<br><b>house in a nice subdivision.&nbsp; We had two children; our 2 1/2
year old son,</b>
<br><b>Jerimiah, and our newborn son, Joshua.</b>
<br><b>The sightings began shortly after we moved in.&nbsp; I should say
at this point,</b>
<br><b>that the "sightings" were peripheral only in nature.&nbsp; Whenever
I was seated</b>
<br><b>in the living room, on the couch, I could see down the hall out
of the corner</b>
<br><b>of my eye.&nbsp; Occasionally, I would see a tallish, dark shadow
moving from one</b>
<br><b>bedroom to the other.&nbsp; I never felt threatened, just curious.&nbsp;
As soon as I</b>
<br><b>turned my head to actually look at it, it would be gone.&nbsp; I
never mentioned</b>
<br><b>this to anyone.&nbsp; I thought my ex-husband would think I had
lost my mind.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>kept this to myself until we moved out after about a year.</b>
<br><b>Shortly after we moved out, we were talking about how much we liked
the house</b>
<br><b>and wished we could buy something like it in the future.&nbsp; I
mentioned that I</b>
<br><b>would mind it coming with the same ghost.&nbsp; My ex looked at
me with a very</b>
<br><b>peculiar look on his face.&nbsp; "You saw it, too?" he asked me.&nbsp;
I was floored to</b>
<br><b>say the least!&nbsp; He had been seeing a shadow for as long as
I had, and kept</b>
<br><b>the information to himself.&nbsp; The only difference?&nbsp; He
saw a child-size shadow</b>
<br><b>only.&nbsp; I only saw an adult-sized shadow.</b>
<br><b>This is one of the most strange experiences of my life.&nbsp; I
truly believe we</b>
<br><b>were haunted.&nbsp; I would be interested in your comments.</b>

<p><b>England Castles</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: andyv_558@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>OK, this is true. It happened to me last night (25th April, 2000)
at</b>
<br><b>11:30pm.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Yesterday, me and my best friend were sitting around completely bored.
We'd</b>
<br><b>been sitting around drinking beer and then the conversation turned
to this</b>
<br><b>little village about 5 miles from where we live called Berry Pomeroy.
This</b>
<br><b>place is home to one of the most (in)famous castles in SW England.
It is</b>
<br><b>reputed to be the most haunted area and castle in Europe.</b>
<br><b>We decided that seeing as he had the night off work (he works in</b>
<br><b>sainsburys), and I had free time, we should go down to the castle
at</b>
<br><b>midnight and look for the spooks, especially the white lady, a woman
who was</b>
<br><b>apparently boarded up in a tower of the castle, and her spirit is
said to</b>
<br><b>roam the grounds, luring people to dangerous places where they often
have</b>
<br><b>fatal accidents.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, we got some people together and some torches and some food.
We set</b>
<br><b>out at 10:45pm. 4 of the 6 people going decided not to go, opting
to go</b>
<br><b>around the neighbouring fishing village stealing milk bottles. We
thought</b>
<br><b>"f*** em, they're just scared", and me and my friend got in his
car and set</b>
<br><b>off without them.</b>
<br><b>We had no apprehensions about the place, no fear at all. We filled
the car</b>
<br><b>with petrol, and took his mobile phone in case of emergencies, because
the</b>
<br><b>castle grounds are remote from civilisation. We were joking around
in the</b>
<br><b>car, thinking how cool it would be if we saw a ghost, I said that
I had</b>
<br><b>heard the white lady was pretty sexy, and if we found her I'd "like
to give</b>
<br><b>her a good shafting". I have to repeat myself, there was no fear.</b>
<br><b>This was all until we got to the lane leading towards the castle
at the end</b>
<br><b>of which the first signpost pointing it out rests. As soon as we
entered the</b>
<br><b>lane, the air seemed to change. The road is a very narrow, very
creepy</b>
<br><b>country lane with trees on either side, as you drive down either
side of the</b>
<br><b>car is dragging in the brambles. I cast a look back through the
rear</b>
<br><b>windscreen, and although we had turned off a busy main road, all
I could see</b>
<br><b>was blackness (I should still have seen the road). The road ahead
was narrow</b>
<br><b>and starting to flood very rapidly (it had only started to drizzle).
We both</b>
<br><b>suddenly felt uncomfortable. My friend who was driving said he couldn't</b>
<br><b>breathe, and seemed to be choking. I felt sick and headachy and
strangely</b>
<br><b>unafraid. Even though I was breathing, it felt as if there was no
air. First</b>
<br><b>I thought I was panicking, but I felt absolutely no fear, and my
pulse was</b>
<br><b>still going calmly. The only way I can describe how I felt was dead.
I felt</b>
<br><b>like I had two people in my head suddenly. One, which felt rational,
was</b>
<br><b>saying that if we kept going, we would never get back. The other
was telling</b>
<br><b>me, almost like a whisper in my ear, that I NEEDED to be down at
the castle.</b>
<br><b>Through this whole thing, I felt like a waking corpse, still feeling
no</b>
<br><b>emotion about it. Suddenly, I got a very vivid image in my head,
but I was</b>
<br><b>jolted from this by my friend saying "I can't do this, I'm going
back". He</b>
<br><b>turned into a sideroad and turned around, heading back the way we
came. As</b>
<br><b>soon as we were going back, all those feelings faded, apart from
the need to</b>
<br><b>get down there, which became stronger as we moved away. As soon
as we got</b>
<br><b>back to civilisation and off that road, everything felt relatively
normal</b>
<br><b>again.</b>
<br><b>I asked him what made him decide to go back, he said he felt sure
he was</b>
<br><b>going to have an accident on the next bend. He said he had gotten
this</b>
<br><b>strong image in his mind that they would be a figure stood just
around the</b>
<br><b>next corner, and that he would swerve to avoid it, resulting in
a crash. I</b>
<br><b>asked him to describe the person and he said it was a middle-aged
woman in a</b>
<br><b>black cloak/ shaul, staring at us. This had me spooked, because
that was the</b>
<br><b>exact image I had in my mind before he turned the car around. He
also</b>
<br><b>described the "dead feeling" I had experienced. I admit at this
time it</b>
<br><b>could have been suggestion, me unconsciously adding his account
into my own</b>
<br><b>memories of the event, but the next thing he described was that
he was sure</b>
<br><b>the last thing he would see was a penknife. He described it in great
detail.</b>
<br><b>This had me spooked, because I had found a penknife at the petrol
station,</b>
<br><b>and pocketed it, not telling him about it. He could not have seen
it.</b>
<br><b>Also, when I got home, I found a book of local folklore. At that
road we</b>
<br><b>were on, there have been many fatal road accidents at the bend we
stopped</b>
<br><b>at. Also, the road is reputed to be inhabited by the ghost of a
cavalier,</b>
<br><b>and a demon black dog who rips its victims apart. The presence of
the latter</b>
<br><b>is often preceeded by a feeling of emptiness and foreboding.</b>
<br><b>Another thing that scares me the most about the experience is that
he too</b>
<br><b>described the feeling of there being an intruder in his head, but
his said</b>
<br><b>"get out now", not "I gotta get down there".</b>
<br><b>We have both vowed we are never going back there again, there is
definitely</b>
<br><b>something about that place, and it is definitely bad.</b><b></b>
<p><b>That is the first part of my story.&nbsp; Despite the fact that we
both agreed</b>
<br><b>never to return, boredom set in soon, and on the night of Monday
7th August,</b>
<br><b>we were out driving around town and decided to go check that place
out</b>
<br><b>again.&nbsp; At about 10:30pm in town, we managed to attract the
attention of two</b>
<br><b>attractive females outside the cinema (we are fairly well known
in the</b>
<br><b>Torbay area because we are "boy racers" with a very distinctive
car- A red</b>
<br><b>mk1 Honda CRX with a LOUD stereo and exhaust...).&nbsp; We asked
them if they</b>
<br><b>wanted to come along to the castle, one had to get home but the
other- we'll</b>
<br><b>call her Jo- had just run away from home so had time to kill and
no place to</b>
<br><b>go so she agreed to come along.&nbsp; After dropping off her friend,
we set out</b>
<br><b>to the castle.&nbsp; I had this time taken my mobile phone with
me, because I was</b>
<br><b>supposed to be phoning my "kinda" girlfriend that night.&nbsp; I
was sitting in</b>
<br><b>the back, my friend was driving and Jo was in the front passenger
seat (left</b>
<br><b>side).</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, this time we got all the way down to
the castle without</b>
<br><b>incident, and on the road approaching the castle (about 11pm), I
decided to</b>
<br><b>give the girl a call on the phone saying where I was and what I
was doing.</b>
<br><b>The phone rang and she answered, but then my phone cut out completely,
as</b>
<br><b>did the car stereo we had been playing at a low volume.&nbsp; I
could not switch</b>
<br><b>my phone back on, then i remembered reading that electrical equipment
such</b>
<br><b>as cellphones, radios, cameras, etc, have a habit of malfunctioning
at the</b>
<br><b>castle.&nbsp; We thought that it was pretty cool that this was happening
but</b>
<br><b>didn't find it particularly scary.&nbsp; We were stopped in the
car, the only</b>
<br><b>light available was starlight (no clouds in the sky and the moon
had</b>
<br><b>buggered off for the night), and to the left of the car where we
were parked</b>
<br><b>on the left of the road (english road system, drive on the left)
was a wire</b>
<br><b>fence guarding a grassy slope.&nbsp; Beyond this, totally in silouette
and</b>
<br><b>looking very menacing was the castle towering into the night sky.&nbsp;
At this</b>
<br><b>point Jo got very uneasy and wanted to lock her door for some reason-
this</b>
<br><b>was understandable considering our proximity to the castle which
was about</b>
<br><b>50 metres away and bearing in mind the place's macabre reputation.&nbsp;
She got</b>
<br><b>a bit panicked because she could not find the lock in the dark because
in</b>
<br><b>the CRX it is positioned further down as a flick- lever by the door
handle,</b>
<br><b>instead of by the window like in most cars.&nbsp; I leaned forward
to help her</b>
<br><b>with the lock, so my head was below the bottom of the window.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said thankyou and I was getting up saying
"you're welcome" but I was</b>
<br><b>cut off halfway through saying it as something caught my eye.&nbsp;
I can't</b>
<br><b>describe what it was apart from to say, you know when you're brain
registers</b>
<br><b>something unusual or you catch a glimpse of something not quite
right, but</b>
<br><b>the detail is so minute that the only impression you are left with
is a</b>
<br><b>feeling that something is wrong.&nbsp; All I saw was a glimmer of
movement on the</b>
<br><b>grassy bank about 10 metres from the car- not that unusual seeing
as this</b>
<br><b>was the countryside, so after a moments consideration I dismissed
it as a</b>
<br><b>badger or a fox or some other form of wildlife.&nbsp; We sat watching
the castle</b>
<br><b>fora couple more minutes til we decided to got, my friend turned
the car in</b>
<br><b>a 3 point turn and drove off.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we were leaving, I looked back casually at
where we were parked and</b>
<br><b>saw something totally strange.&nbsp; I saw a pale figure, leap over
the fence</b>
<br><b>where we were parked like a hurdler in the olympics and land in
the road.</b>
<br><b>The figure immediately broke into a sprint along the road after
us- AND IT</b>
<br><b>WAS GAINING ON US!&nbsp; This is amazing considering we were travelling
at about</b>
<br><b>50mph by then (boy racer habits, not because my friend had seen
anything).</b>
<br><b>I couldn't see any features apart from the fact it seemed to be
a male</b>
<br><b>figure, quite lanky, totally white and solid.&nbsp; I yelled obcenities</b>
<br><b>and Jo shouted "what?!", almost screamed she was probably spooked.&nbsp;
I looked</b>
<br><b>at her and told her to look out the back window, and when we both
looked</b>
<br><b>again, there was nothing but empty country road again, even though
less a</b>
<br><b>second had elapsed when I turned away from the figure- it could
not have</b>
<br><b>left the road in that time.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This experience was very confusing because in
the months following my</b>
<br><b>last experience at that place, I had become quite well versed in
the</b>
<br><b>folklore and ghosts of the place, and there is no mention of anything
even</b>
<br><b>closely resembling what i saw that night.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for listening, I got some other stories to share with you
sometime,</b>
<br><b>maybe I'll get around to typing them for you soon.</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>A house on oak street in flint Michigan that I lived in when I was
a young</b>
<br><b>boy was haunted.&nbsp; My mother woke up one night to see the shadow
of a small</b>
<br><b>person outside her door. She called out the name of my older brother,
and</b>
<br><b>upon receiving no response, called my name. Naturally, I didn't
answer. the</b>
<br><b>door was then pushed completely open. There was nothing in the hallway,</b>
<br><b>except for the shadow. my mother gasped, and the shadow ran behind
the door</b>
<br><b>where she kept her shoes.&nbsp; The next day, Mom made arrangements
to move.</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Night of Battle</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ThCWrigh@southernco.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;This is an awesome website.&nbsp; Reading these stories, I
believe, could</b>
<br><b>turn even the most devoted skeptics into believers.&nbsp; I for
one have never</b>
<br><b>doubted.&nbsp; I have always believed in God and I've alway believed
that He</b>
<br><b>would protect me and see me through any and everything.&nbsp; So
far He has never</b>
<br><b>let me down.&nbsp; However, one horrifying confrontation with evil
taught me a</b>
<br><b>lesson that I will never forget.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I was about to be a senior in college and rather than spend
the</b>
<br><b>summer with parents, my two best friends and I decided to sub lease
an</b>
<br><b>apartment for the summer.&nbsp; Before I go any further let me reassure
you that</b>
<br><b>the apartment was a pleasant and comfortable place.&nbsp; No ghostly
instances to</b>
<br><b>speak of.&nbsp; However, one of my roommates was involved in a religion
that</b>
<br><b>involved chanting (which seemed to put her in some type of trance),
deep</b>
<br><b>meditation, and placing offerings before an alter. These practices
concerned</b>
<br><b>me but I tried to keep an open mind as I'm the first to admit that</b>
<br><b>everything that we don't understand is not always bad.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Halfway through the summer, I began to really draw close to
the</b>
<br><b>Lord.&nbsp; As my spiritual walk grew stronger, I suddenly became
aware of how</b>
<br><b>tormented emotionally, mentally and spiritually my friend had seemed
through</b>
<br><b>all of our friendship. (We have been friends since grade eighth
grade.)&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>was always subject to severe mood swings and depression and people
were</b>
<br><b>always claiming to dislike her and wanted to avoid her. I suddenly
wanted</b>
<br><b>nothing more than to see my roommate experience the joy that I was</b>
<br><b>experiencing walking with God as a Christian.&nbsp; I had begun
reading several</b>
<br><b>books about spiritual warfare and standing in the gap (or praying
and</b>
<br><b>interceeding) for others and soon felt battle ready to stand against
any</b>
<br><b>demons that might prevent my friend from seeing the light.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Right away I began praying daily for my friend and rebuking
any</b>
<br><b>demons that may be within her.&nbsp; I had anointed the apartment
upon moving in</b>
<br><b>and felt that would be enough covering.&nbsp; One night of terror
would prove me</b>
<br><b>wrong, wrong, wrong. One night I was up fairly late.&nbsp; All of
my roommates</b>
<br><b>were asleep and my boyfriend (now ex boyfriend) who decided to stay
the</b>
<br><b>night because of the time was asleep also.&nbsp; I sat up watching
television</b>
<br><b>until I got tired of flipping the channels.&nbsp; I did'nt know
why at the time</b>
<br><b>but I had felt a strange uneasiness all that evening.&nbsp; The
bedroom I was</b>
<br><b>staying in had two beds and since my boyfriend had gone to sleep
in my bed,</b>
<br><b>I decided to sleep in the other.&nbsp; Right away as I attempted
to go to sleep,</b>
<br><b>I felt an evil presense in the room.&nbsp; I said a prayer and tried
to brush it</b>
<br><b>off but suddenly the room felt thick and uncomfortable as if some
great</b>
<br><b>weight or heavy cloud was descending in the room.&nbsp; I turned
over on my back</b>
<br><b>to see a thick white mist in the corner of my room over the doorway.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>mist soon became defined as I was able to make out what appeared
to be the</b>
<br><b>lines of a thick white blob with features that seemed to shift in
and out of</b>
<br><b>focus.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I was so fearful that I ran to the bed my boyfriend was in.&nbsp;
As I</b>
<br><b>dived in the bed next to him, he barely flinched at all the commotion.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>was in a deep sleep. As I settled under the covers, I was still
aware that</b>
<br><b>the evil presence was hovering in the corner.&nbsp; Opening my eyes,
I prayed I</b>
<br><b>would see nothing. To my dissappointment, the shifting mist still
hovered</b>
<br><b>there and was joined by what appeared to be two other misty forms.&nbsp;
This is</b>
<br><b>where things get foggy because suddenly I was overwhelmed with a
sleepiness</b>
<br><b>I cannot explain.&nbsp; I was still afraid and I WANTED to stay
awake but</b>
<br><b>could'nt. As I drifted off to sleep,&nbsp; I heard the mist tell
me in the most</b>
<br><b>vehemently evil voice I had ever heard that I was going to die and
who did I</b>
<br><b>think I was praying for anyone.&nbsp; The last notion I remember
as I drifted to</b>
<br><b>sleep was "Oh my God! The demons in my room were my roommate's."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The next few hours were the most horrific of my life.&nbsp;
Soon after I</b>
<br><b>went to sleep, I was awakened ever few moments by something shaking
me</b>
<br><b>violently and it grew worse as the shaking went to punching and
sometimes</b>
<br><b>choking me.&nbsp; I promise you ever word of this is true.&nbsp;
I thought I was going</b>
<br><b>to die.&nbsp; What's worse is that I could'nt open my eyes and I
could'nt scream.</b>
<br><b>I could only try to punch groggily at whatever assaulted me.&nbsp;
When daylight</b>
<br><b>finally came, I was more than thankful as I did not know if I would
ever see</b>
<br><b>another day.&nbsp; My room felt completely different from the night
before.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>air even smelled different.&nbsp; I didn't discuss what happened
to me the night</b>
<br><b>before with my boyfriend. He was the king of skeptics and I knew
without a</b>
<br><b>doubt the validity of what happened to me the night before could
not be</b>
<br><b>challenged.&nbsp; Strangely enough, he did ask me what I watched
on television</b>
<br><b>that gave me such bad dreams.&nbsp; He said that I shook so violently
and punched</b>
<br><b>so fiercely during the night that several times he awoke but was
too sleeply</b>
<br><b>to try calming me down.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;For days I questioned how God could allow this to happen to
me.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>had only been praying for my friend and being attacked so violently
had</b>
<br><b>shaken my faith.&nbsp; My answer came swiftly from Ephesians 6:10-12
which says</b>
<br><b>"Be strong in the Lord and the power of His might.&nbsp; Put on
the whole armour</b>
<br><b>of God that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
For we</b>
<br><b>wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
against</b>
<br><b>powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
spiritual</b>
<br><b>wickedness in high places." I quickly realized the mistake I had
made.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>took on the forces of evil without thinking of the repercussions
and without</b>
<br><b>ensuring that I was protected and shielded by the armor of God.
I had</b>
<br><b>overlooked a very natural law of spiritual warfare that states that
whatever</b>
<br><b>is coming against the person you're standing in the gap for probably
isn't</b>
<br><b>happy about it and will come after you.&nbsp; Since then, I have
learned to</b>
<br><b>diligently seek the Lord's will and protection before I step out
into</b>
<br><b>spiritual warfare.&nbsp; It's mandatory that you do the same.&nbsp;
As I read many of</b>
<br><b>these stories, I always like to hear about those who called out
to God or</b>
<br><b>used the Word of God to get rid of pesky or evil spirits.&nbsp;
The paranormal is</b>
<br><b>real and it's exciting but what you must do is recognize that you
can't</b>
<br><b>afford to play with anything that you can't handle.&nbsp; Checking
out haunted</b>
<br><b>houses and being interested in the paranormal is one thing but the
practice</b>
<br><b>of witchcraft, the use of Quija boards, tarot cards, other occult
and etc</b>
<br><b>are all things that can land you in a heap of trouble and grief
if you're</b>
<br><b>not more than careful.&nbsp; You have to ask yourself is it worth
it? What am I</b>
<br><b>inviting into my bedroom, my home, my life?&nbsp; I'm still praying
for my</b>
<br><b>friend.&nbsp; She's not a Christian yet but she has begun seeking
the Lord for</b>
<br><b>herself.&nbsp; Atleast when she's ready to talk about it, I'll be
around for her</b>
<br><b>to talk about it with.&nbsp; Thanks for reading my story.</b>

<p><b>Freaky Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: idiot_user@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hiya to u guys i'm a guy that lives up north,so to say, I live in
Finland</b>
<br><b>and i'm 19 years old and i would like to share my experinces with
u.I</b>
<br><b>finally took up to writing this to u cause i've seen and felt many
odd</b>
<br><b>things inc 3 ufo experinces,and many ghastly encouters...My story
begins</b>
<br><b>when me and my cousine, Chris, were bout 11-13 years old.He was
sent to our</b>
<br><b>Granma and Granpa when his mother was out partying (his dad died
when he was</b>
<br><b>little so she was hubbysearching).Cause i live close to them I spent
the</b>
<br><b>summers there.AS u can imagine to young boys having a blast we stayed
up</b>
<br><b>late sometimes till morning...one specific nigth we were up and
we heard</b>
<br><b>footsteps in the isle walking up the stairs heading for our room(the
house</b>
<br><b>is a 2-story house and is over a 100 years old).We opened the door
to the</b>
<br><b>room thinking it was our Granma who was going to come tell us to
shut up(we</b>
<br><b>made quite a noise hehehe :)),well there was no1 there so we shut
the door</b>
<br><b>again and we heard the footsteps continue towards our room, so we
opened the</b>
<br><b>door again.This time we put the ligths&nbsp; on...Yep no1! At this
point we were</b>
<br><b>really freaked so we slammed the door shut without switching the
ligths off</b>
<br><b>and hid under our blanketts(scared as we were)the footsteps were
heard again</b>
<br><b>closing into our rooms door. Suddenly we heard a shriek and then
tumbling</b>
<br><b>noises and then the footsteps ran down the stairs..needless to say
we didn't</b>
<br><b>check after that. We grew accoustomed to those steps in the nigths
and</b>
<br><b>didn't give em any attention. That was until we heard the steps
inside our</b>
<br><b>room and we saw orbs flying on the ceiling.We stormed out of bed
ran</b>
<br><b>downstairs we heard the footsteps follow us all the way, we ran
out of the</b>
<br><b>house, heading for my house suddenly didn't hear any steps or anything...We</b>
<br><b>turned around the house was dark,which was odd cause we had outdoor
ligths</b>
<br><b>on when we ran out but not anymore!! I never ever slept over there
again...I</b>
<br><b>still live close to our grandparents house but I won't stay there
alone more</b>
<br><b>than 10 minutes. Sometimes I feel some1 or something watching me
from the</b>
<br><b>second floor stairs...It's drag cause i really like my grandparents
but i'm</b>
<br><b>scared shitless from that ghost or whatever it was...I've also witnessed
a</b>
<br><b>ghost cat with my girlfriend I know it is a ghost cat cause i accidentally</b>
<br><b>ran it over:(! It just stands by the road watching us drive by...and
at my</b>
<br><b>GF's house i feel some1 watching me from the top of her stairs but
it</b>
<br><b>disappears when i reach the top...i've also been ghosthunting with

<p><b>Grandmother Etta</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ndiangrl@zoomnet.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was 5 Etta came to me. I was sitting on Mom`s lap and Etta
walked by.I was the only one to see her and hear her. She told me to call
her Etta. She`s about 30-35 wears a tan dress, gold glasses and her hair
in a bun. I can feel her the most but I can hear her too. Mom asked me
what she looked like when I was 16 and I told her. She showed me a picture
of a lady and it was my Etta!!!!!! Turns out she is/was my GreatGrandma.
That`s why Mom can`t see her. Dad has seen her and my niece Mallory.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We also have Harvey. He`s 40-50 wears clothes from the 30`s-40`s and loves
to play pranks. There is a small boy who plays with my dogs and cats. He

<br><b>My Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lindsay_korman_is_my_idol@yahoo.co.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi my name is Rachel, I'm 16 and I live in Memphis. I have a Ghost
expierence that I would like to share.This happened in June of 2000. I
was home alone and was on the computer. I didn't realize it at first but
I kept hearing carnival music and people talking in the living room but
I thought I left the TV on. so I went around the house and there were no
TV's on. Well when I passed through the living room again I heard it and
it was very cold. I got kinda scared but not to scared to leave. Well it
stopped for about 2 hours and when I went to go to bed I thought I saw
something out of the corner of my eye when I looked over there was nothing
there. It was still very chilly. I went upstairs thats where I heard the
knocking noise. I thought it was the fan in the kitchen so I didn't think
anything of it. But it kept on and on. So finally I went downstairs and
turned off the fan. When I went back upstairs it was still knocking I went
around my room looking for something that it could be but couldn't find
anything. Then it got cold. (Note: this is the beginning of summer and
at night here it only dropped to 85 degrees and it is very hot upstairs.)
I usually don't sleep with covers but I had to. I fell asleep but around
3:00 am I awoke with something hovering over me and rubbing my back. I
sleep on my stomach so I was to afraid to turn around.&nbsp; So I went
back to sleep. That night was the last night I would stay by myself. But
when I thought about it alot I realized it could have been my Grandfather
who died 3 yrs ago. Watching over me. He always told my Grandmother that
he would do anything for me. And I still think from that day on he will
watch over me.</b>

<p><b>Ghost in North Hollywood</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: guineveredulac@uswest.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have an interesting ghost story that completes a cycle of my life.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>begins in 1972 and ends in the summer of 1991.</b>
<br><b>In 1972, my parents moved us back to California from Kentucky.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>stayed in a house with my uncle and his wife in North Hollywood.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>very young and remember few things about the house.&nbsp; I do however</b>
<br><b>remember the nice old lady that lived next door.&nbsp; She wore
big straw</b>
<br><b>hats and colorful dresses.&nbsp; She tended beautiful flowers in
the front</b>
<br><b>yard.</b>
<br><b>In 1989, my husband, son and I moved into the house “next door”.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>lady with the big straw hat was Hazel.&nbsp; My uncle had purchased
the house</b>
<br><b>from her shortly after she became incapacitated.&nbsp; She had to
move in</b>
<br><b>with a niece in Massachusetts.</b>
<br><b>The day my husband and I went to look at the house, the current
resident</b>
<br><b>gave us the grand tour of the 1000 square foot, two-bedroom cottage.&nbsp;
In</b>
<br><b>a matter-of-fact way, she noted that one of the rooms (the one that</b>
<br><b>would be my son’s) was “the haunted room”.&nbsp; We dismissed her
as being a</b>
<br><b>drug addict and proceeded to look at all the damage that was done
to the</b>
<br><b>home.</b>
<br><b>After we moved in, we immediately began repairs.&nbsp; After a few
days of</b>
<br><b>painting and spackling, I was ready to hang photos of my toddler.&nbsp;
There</b>
<br><b>was a beautiful archway that led to the bedrooms.&nbsp; I hung the
framed</b>
<br><b>photos around the arch.&nbsp; I sat in the chair across the room
to admire my</b>
<br><b>handiwork.&nbsp; At that moment, one of the photos fell to the floor.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>nail came shooting out of the wall and landed on the floor about
three</b>
<br><b>feet from the wall.&nbsp; At the time I thought it unusual, but
not scary or</b>
<br><b>surprising.</b>
<br><b>As the months progressed, more things began to happen.&nbsp; One
night, about</b>
<br><b>2:00 AM, my husband and I were awakened to a knocking on the wall
behind</b>
<br><b>the bed.&nbsp; The first knock woke us up.&nbsp; We both distinctly
heard the last</b>
<br><b>two.&nbsp; It sounded like hammering, although we could not see
what was</b>
<br><b>making the noises.</b>
<br><b>One evening we watched our cat, Scooter, play with what appeared
to be a</b>
<br><b>string or something hanging from the ceiling.&nbsp; We watched for
a few</b>
<br><b>minutes, but could not focus on what she saw.&nbsp; She clawed and
meowed at</b>
<br><b>an invisible plaything.&nbsp; I put my hand above her to try to
find a</b>
<br><b>spider’s web or something equally translucent.&nbsp; There was nothing
there.</b>
<br><b>Another time, Scooter sat in the corner near the front door.&nbsp;
She stared</b>
<br><b>at the wall; her eyes fixed on something several feet above her.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>meowed loudly.&nbsp; She did not move an inch.&nbsp; Again, I went
to investigate,</b>
<br><b>but found nothing there.</b>
<br><b>Soon Halloween was approaching.&nbsp; My 2-year-old son was preparing
to go</b>
<br><b>trick or treating.&nbsp; We were all excited about the events soon</b>
<br><b>approaching.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few nights before Halloween, I
was tucking him in.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>said to me, “Mommy, our house is haunted”.&nbsp; I felt a chill
run up my</b>
<br><b>spine.&nbsp; I laughed and said that there was no such thing as
ghosts.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>said as serious as could be, “There’s one right there.”&nbsp; He
pointed</b>
<br><b>behind me.&nbsp; Although I was scared to look around, I obliged.&nbsp;
“Baby,</b>
<br><b>there’s nothing there.”&nbsp; I did not want to scare him, but I
did believe.</b>
<br><b>My husband had two things he kept near his chair, the Sporting News
and</b>
<br><b>the New York Times Crossword Puzzle book.&nbsp; One day, both items
were</b>
<br><b>missing.&nbsp; We searched the whole house.&nbsp; I looked through
all the books</b>
<br><b>in the bookshelf next to his chair.&nbsp; I pulled all the books
out and</b>
<br><b>cleaned behind the bookshelf.&nbsp; His books were no where to be
found.</b>
<br><b>There were no spaces in the bookshelf where they once were placed.</b>
<br><b>Three months later, the books reappeared.&nbsp; Whatever filled
the spaces</b>
<br><b>before were now gone.</b>
<br><b>During this year, my husband, a New Yorker and definitely a skeptic,
was</b>
<br><b>defiant to any paranormal explanation to the events.&nbsp; His mind
would</b>
<br><b>soon change.</b>
<br><b>Approaching our first year in the house, we decided to repaint my
son’s</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; One day my husband was painting and the fumes were just</b>
<br><b>terrible.&nbsp; He opened one of the windows in the room and continued
to</b>
<br><b>paint.&nbsp; The window that usually did not easily move closed
suddenly.</b>
<br><b>Startled, he went back to the window and opened it again.&nbsp;
He went back</b>
<br><b>to the other side of the room to paint.&nbsp; Again, the window
closed.</b>
<br><b>Aggravated, he went back and opened the window.&nbsp; He also closed
the</b>
<br><b>roller blind.&nbsp; He said something to the air about keeping it
closed.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>then went back to the other side to paint.&nbsp; This time the window
did not</b>
<br><b>close, the roller blind went up.&nbsp; At the same time he distinctly
heard</b>
<br><b>his name being said and the words, “Thank you”.</b>
<br><b>That same week, my husband heard loud banging in our bedroom.&nbsp;
When he</b>
<br><b>went to investigate he saw our kitten standing on the dresser next
to</b>
<br><b>the hammer.</b>
<br><b>For awhile things were quiet.&nbsp; I had a discussion with a friend</b>
<br><b>regarding the paranormal activities.&nbsp; He suggested that he
bring his</b>
<br><b>girlfriend over.&nbsp; She was proficient in paranormal activity.&nbsp;
Later they</b>
<br><b>came over to take a look around.&nbsp; She was not told why she
was at our</b>
<br><b>home.&nbsp; She began to ask me about the house.&nbsp; I explained
that it was</b>
<br><b>built in 1929.&nbsp; I told her that from what I knew, this at one
time was</b>
<br><b>studio land.&nbsp; She asked if she could walk around.&nbsp; She
explained that</b>
<br><b>she had feelings and impressions of an entity still residing in
the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; She told me that he built the second bedroom (my son’s
room) for</b>
<br><b>his unborn child.&nbsp; She also said that the backyard used to
have</b>
<br><b>beautiful trees, a gazebo and a storage building.&nbsp; She had
an impression</b>
<br><b>that he was looking to the West and weeping over the loss of the
baby.</b>
<br><b>She said that there was a woman in a big straw hat and a colorful
dress</b>
<br><b>standing behind him.&nbsp; She too was crying.</b>
<br><b>After she left, I ran to my neighbors home (the house I lived in
when I</b>
<br><b>was 6).&nbsp; I asked them what the backyard looked like before
my uncle</b>
<br><b>owned the house.&nbsp; My neighbor said that the backyard had tall
trees,</b>
<br><b>gazebo and a storage shed filled with old furniture.&nbsp; Needless
to say, I</b>
<br><b>could not doubt the other things the psychic had to say.</b>
<br><b>Still the haunting activities continued.&nbsp; Items disappeared
all the</b>
<br><b>time.&nbsp; A mirror, jewelry, my husband’s wallet and a pocketknife
were all</b>
<br><b>lost and returned in unusual places.&nbsp; The mirror was taken
from the</b>
<br><b>bathroom over night and placed in the linen closet on the top shelf
all</b>
<br><b>the way to the back.</b>
<br><b>Before we moved from the house, my neighbor and I heard the ghost.&nbsp;
As</b>
<br><b>we sat in the living room, we could hear a voice coming from the
middle</b>
<br><b>of the room.&nbsp; We searched the house for a radio.&nbsp; The
voice was</b>
<br><b>definitely coming from the middle of the room, just under the floor.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>both got down on our knees and put our ears to the floor.&nbsp;
There was a</b>
<br><b>distinct, but unintelligible voice speaking from under the floorboards!</b>
<br><b>That same evening I noticed my old Mickey and Minnie Mouse figurines</b>
<br><b>were turned with their backs to us.&nbsp; The dust was displaced
as if the</b>
<br><b>figurines were picked up and turned around by someone.&nbsp; Oddly
enough,</b>
<br><b>the figures were placed so far back in the china cabinet, that if</b>
<br><b>someone had done this, they would have knocked down other figurines,</b>
<br><b>displacing the dust.&nbsp; Another friend came by.&nbsp; We asked
her if she</b>
<br><b>noticed something strange in the china cabinet.&nbsp; She immediately
flung</b>
<br><b>open the cabinet and squeezed her hand to the back.&nbsp; She spun
around</b>
<br><b>Mickey and Minnie.&nbsp; She replaced the other figures.&nbsp; As
she closed the</b>
<br><b>china cabinet doors, she lost all color in her face.&nbsp; She said
she felt</b>
<br><b>a chill up her spine.&nbsp; She noted, “I wasn’t supposed to do
that, was I?”</b>
<br><b>We moved from the house in July 1991.&nbsp; My uncle still owns
the house.</b>
<br><b>One day I’ll ask the current tenants if they have noticed anything.</b>

<br><b>Messenger Ghost in Canoga Park, CA</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: guineveredulac@uswest.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>One hot summer evening in the San Fernando Valley, my boyfriend,
our</b>
<br><b>roommate and myself spent the evening shooting the breeze trying
to keep</b>
<br><b>cool.&nbsp; After we had all retired, I was startled awake.&nbsp;
There was</b>
<br><b>someone entering the room!&nbsp; I looked towards the doorway and
saw a young</b>
<br><b>woman standing there.&nbsp; She wore a trench coat and a beehive
hairstyle.</b>
<br><b>She looked like she was from the mid 1960s.&nbsp; She proceeded
to model the</b>
<br><b>coat for me.&nbsp; She opened it to show the lining, she turned
so I could</b>
<br><b>see the back, etc.&nbsp; The dog in the room moaned and moved away
from the</b>
<br><b>doorway.&nbsp; I woke up my boyfriend.&nbsp; I did not expect him
to react too</b>
<br><b>much as he is blind, but I was scared and needed comfort.&nbsp;
When I looked</b>
<br><b>back to the doorway, she was gone.</b>
<br><b>The next morning, I totally forgot about the aberration.&nbsp; My
boyfriend</b>
<br><b>had a meeting with a music producer and we were all psyched up for</b>
<br><b>that.&nbsp; He teased me about the ghost.&nbsp; I felt chilled to
the bone.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>briefly discussed whether or not it was ghost from days gone by.&nbsp;
Canoga</b>
<br><b>Park had a great deal of nice apartments built a while ago.&nbsp;
Maybe she</b>
<br><b>was a previous resident?</b>
<br><b>We went to the meeting at a local bar.&nbsp; I received a call at
the bar.</b>
<br><b>It was my boyfriend’s mother.&nbsp; She said she had a call from
one of my</b>
<br><b>close friend’s mothers.&nbsp; It seems, one of my best friends had
been</b>
<br><b>killed tragically.&nbsp; As the words transmitted through the phone,
the</b>
<br><b>woman in the trench coat came back to my mind.</b>

<p><b>Summer Camp Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: AspenBreezes@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I've enjoyed the stories on your site.&nbsp; They are fun to read.
Im writing to</b>
<br><b>share one of my experiences with a possible ghost.&nbsp; This occurred
about</b>
<br><b>twenty years ago around 1980.&nbsp; I was 15 or 16 years old and
at a summer camp</b>
<br><b>near Idyllwild, CA. at the time.&nbsp; One of the girls in my cabin
had a pretty</b>
<br><b>bad asthma attack earlier in the evening.&nbsp; She was sleeping
on the bottom</b>
<br><b>bunk against the wall furthest from the window.&nbsp; If my memory
serves me right</b>
<br><b>the cabin was about 18 ft by 10ft or 12ft.&nbsp; I awoke in the
middle of the</b>
<br><b>night all the other girls were asleep.&nbsp; I turned over and saw
a white hazy</b>
<br><b>figure standing by her bed.&nbsp; My first thought was not that
it was a ghost but</b>
<br><b>maybe light shining in from the window.&nbsp; I studied the window
in relation to</b>
<br><b>the figure and came to the conclusion that that was not the source
of the</b>
<br><b>light.&nbsp; I thought it was strange but didn't become frightened
because I</b>
<br><b>thought it was probably something explainable.&nbsp; So I closed
my eyes to go</b>
<br><b>back to sleep.&nbsp; I thought I'd look one more time and opened
my eyes to find</b>
<br><b>the figure right in front of me looking back at me.&nbsp; That's
when I became</b>
<br><b>terrified.&nbsp; I squeezed my eyes shut and started praying for
help.&nbsp; That's</b>
<br><b>when I knew what I saw had to be a ghost.&nbsp; She was still hazy
white and very</b>
<br><b>vague in outline.&nbsp; She looked to me mostly like a white cloud.
She was</b>
<br><b>possibly wearing a dress.&nbsp; Her face also was very vague. But
it frightened me</b>
<br><b>real good.&nbsp; I've had a few more unexplainable experiences that
maybe I'll</b>
<br><b>share at a future date.</b>

<p><b>The House On Athol St.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: coteis@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>We moved into this huge Victorian style house which was a little
in need</b>
<br><b>of a paint job,it had 5brms(4 on the second and 1 on the main) and
a</b>
<br><b>bsmt suite that the landlord didn't rent out,but it need work in
order</b>
<br><b>for it to be suitable for rent.It made for a great play house but
I</b>
<br><b>never liked going in there,actually I hated the bsmt period!The
house</b>
<br><b>even had a laundry shoot from the top floor to the bsmt lol.</b>
<br><b>This house was one of the more quieter ones for mysterious noises
but</b>
<br><b>more in sightings!The first one that I remember happened actually
to my</b>
<br><b>two cousins,they were spending the week-end.They were sent to bed
as was</b>
<br><b>I,and I feel asleep but my cousins remainded awake and were fooling</b>
<br><b>around.They had been wrestling on the bed and had the door shut
so their</b>
<br><b>mom and dad couldn't hear them.The door slowly creaked open and
there</b>
<br><b>before them was a little girl probably not more than 4 in a white</b>
<br><b>nightgown,she had drk wavy hair.They thought it was one of my sisters</b>
<br><b>but they didn't own a nighty like that and didn't have wavy hair.She</b>
<br><b>stood there looking at them as if curious as to what they were doing.My</b>
<br><b>cousins stopped horsing around at this point and by then they too
had</b>
<br><b>wondered who this girl was,the girl turned around and went into
my mom's</b>
<br><b>room.They went to check in my mom's room and they couldn't find
her and</b>
<br><b>my cousins freaked out and went racing down the stairs to tell what
they</b>
<br><b>had just seen,well the grownups just told them your were seeing
things</b>
<br><b>and sent them back upstairs to bed,well they barricaded them selves
in</b>
<br><b>and slept with the light on for the night.I myself had never seen
this</b>
<br><b>little girl but i do remember my cousins couldn't stop talking about
it.</b>
<br><b>What I did see was a little boy who looked like he was my age at
the</b>
<br><b>time (10 or 12?)Only me and my aunt saw this and it was when we
were all</b>
<br><b>coming home.My aunt and I were the first ones through the side door,and</b>
<br><b>I looked in the direction of the fridge and saw a little boy jump
up</b>
<br><b>from behind the fridge at first I thought I was the only one to
see it</b>
<br><b>then my aunty said "did you see that?!!!!!".I immediatly knew what
she</b>
<br><b>was talking about and told her that I had seen it too.My mom asked
us</b>
<br><b>what we were talking about and my aunt told her....I wasn't quite
sure</b>
<br><b>if my mom believed us or not but we knew what we had saw that day.We</b>
<br><b>both describe this boy to one another to a T....even though all
we saw</b>
<br><b>was his head.We tried everything to re-enact what we seen but couldn't</b>
<br><b>do it.</b>

<p><b>I Wanted To Run</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: coteis@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was a single mother and just moved into the main floor of a house,the</b>
<br><b>occupants who lived downstairs had only rented the place to collected</b>
<br><b>welfare and he didn't live there,just came by to pick up his checks.Sounds
carry through</b>
<br><b>my house very easily and I knew when some one was heading down the
stairs.</b>
<br><b>That night I knew I was entirely alone in the house ,my</b>
<br><b>neighbours weren't home so I locked the back door,and I knew they
would have wake me to get downstairs.I was putting my baby to sleep on
my bed(I hated sleeping alone)well</b>
<br><b>I was laying down with him until he fell asleep and I had just closed
my eyes,then I</b>
<br><b>heard something in my closet(it was one of those portable wooden
ones)and the</b>
<br><b>clothes hangers were moving in there all by themselves but we had
mice and just told myself that's what it was and a few moments later I
heard this very loud BANG!!.Like someone had slamed a door very hard,in
the basement and I didn't hear anyone go down the stairs and besides I
would have to let them in.This happened at 11pm,I went and investigated
and came up with nothing,no doors were shut and nobody was home....so I
tried to put it out of my mind and went to bed.The next night,I did the
same thing locked everything,and was laying with my baby again at 11 and
I remember thinking to myself,I sure hope it doesn't happen again and had
just closed my eyes and..BANG!My eyes shot open and my heart was in my
throat and had aweful butterflies,I was so scared,I didn't move if my son
wasn't asleep I would've walked those 14 blocks to my mothers and spent
the night ,but I forced myself to stay and I managed to fall asleep about
3 hrs later,after just lying there trying to calm myself down.That was
the hardest thing to do is not run out of there especially when every fiber
of your being is saying RUN.</b><b></b>

<br><b>years old, so I kept fighting to break free.&nbsp; When I did I
awoke so very</b>
<br><b>cold.&nbsp; I cuddled my daughter, who was also freezing.&nbsp;
I looked over at the</b>
<br><b>door and it was cracked open.</b>
<br><b>This continued to happen to me 2 more times that Summer.&nbsp; I
talked with my</b>
<br><b>grandmother who told me that I must say aloud to this spirit that
I am a</b>
<br><b>visitor and I'm just here visiting.&nbsp; I mean no harm, and to
Leave me alone.</b>
<br><b>I did and it suddenly stopped.</b>
<br><b>After these 'attacks' things were pretty calm.&nbsp; My dad did
not believe what</b>
<br><b>had happened.&nbsp; 2 years later we stayed at my dad's for 1 month
awaiting to</b>
<br><b>get into our new home.&nbsp; My husband (who laughed at me when
he heard my story)</b>
<br><b>was sleeping in the same guest room with me.&nbsp; He woke up and
saw someone</b>
<br><b>standing outside the door.&nbsp; Next thing he knew he was being
pinned down and</b>
<br><b>he mouth &amp; nose were covered.&nbsp; All I knew is that he all
of the sudden jumped</b>
<br><b>in the bed and grabbed me.&nbsp; He was trembling cold &amp; scared.&nbsp;
Needless to say,</b>
<br><b>he believed everything that had happen to me previously.&nbsp; He
still will not</b>
<br><b>stay at their house!</b>
<br><b>About a year and a half later my dad did admit that he had felt
like he was</b>
<br><b>pinned down before in that house.&nbsp; He doesn't like to admit
he believes in</b>
<br><b>ghosts so he just laughs it off.&nbsp; I'd still like to know what
had happened in</b>
<br><b>that house!</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I work in the construction industry and
once I was transferred to a job</b>
<br><b>in Cuthbert,&nbsp; Georgia. A friend of mine had been at this site
for a few weeks</b>
<br><b>longer than me and so I felt quite at home there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day at lunch we&nbsp; were discussing
the old building and,&nbsp; (the fellow</b>
<br><b>I'll call Chip), told me that he'd gone to school there as a teen
and had</b>
<br><b>heard strange noises in the night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's the tale he told me:&nbsp;
During Shermans march to the sea&nbsp; in the</b>
<br><b>latter half of the American Ciil War a Southern soldier who was
wounded was</b>
<br><b>brought to what was at that time an all girls Christian college
converted in</b>
<br><b>to a make-shift hospital.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There he met as young nurse who he took
a liking to. Sad as it was, his</b>
<br><b>leg was amputated and fitted with the best prostesis medical science
could</b>
<br><b>devise at the time, a wooden leg, and this nurse had helped him
ot walk on</b>
<br><b>it. During his phisical therapy , the two fell in love.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As fate would have it, the amputation became
infected, and in short</b>
<br><b>order took his life.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day as we were all working late I was
alone on the fourth floor and</b>
<br><b>felt a cold pass through me that seemed so empty. I chalked it up
to fatigue</b>
<br><b>and thought no more of it, until I heard the strangest sound; thud
-</b>
<br><b>clack!...thud - clak!...thud - clak!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day, when I told Chip about my
experience he informed me that</b>
<br><b>what had happened was that I had heard the sound of&nbsp; "Peg Leg
Pete", the</b>
<br><b>spirit of the love sick Confederate Soldier who had died and occasionally</b>
<br><b>stomped around in the halls of the old building. It would seem that
the old</b>
<br><b>soldier is still trying to find out why the student/turned nurse
is no longer</b>
<br><b>helping him to recover.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told me that he had heard the
sounds often at night when "Old Main"</b>
<br><b>was used as a dormatory.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Chip and my knowledge, this spirit
has never hurt anyone, but I made</b>
<br><b>it a point to not give him a chance.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remains of this Mr. Pete are
interned at the old white section of</b>
<br><b>the local cemetary. I saw his grave.</b>

<p><b>"Tortured Soul"......</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ghettofabulouz@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was about 7 years old and living in Galveston, Tx.
I was down the</b>
<br><b>street at a friends house with my sister, who was like 12 at the
time. My</b>
<br><b>freinds mother wasnt home, and we were just sitting downstairs,
talking,</b>
<br><b>when we heard a knock. It was mid day, and we figured it was one
of the</b>
<br><b>neighborhood kids. But no one was at the door. We continued to hear</b>
<br><b>knowcking, and to make a long story short, we searched the house,
trying to</b>
<br><b>figure out where it was coming from. In her parents room was the
door to the</b>
<br><b>attic. It wasnt a normal attic though, it was more like a seperate
room,</b>
<br><b>slightly lower than the rest of the house, and had a bulkhead type
of</b>
<br><b>entrance. That was where the knocking was coming from, like someone
was</b>
<br><b>trapped in there, trying to get out. We ran out of the house, frightened.
We</b>
<br><b>paused in the front yard and looked at the house. The front window
had</b>
<br><b>curtains on it, and they slowly parted to the side, as if someone
was</b>
<br><b>looking out to see if we were gone. But there was nothing visible
there. At</b>
<br><b>this point, we ran, screaming to my house. My thoery at that age
was that a</b>
<br><b>previous owner of the house kept someone locked in that attic-room,
and they</b>
<br><b>died in there. ANd the owner died in the house. The ghost, knowing
we were</b>
<br><b>there wanted us let it out, and the owner looked to make sure we
were</b>

<br><b>Chapel Hill, TN - ghost light sighting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ShelbyW4664@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Russ.&nbsp; About three years ago, my friends Bobby, Melissa,
Kerrie</b>
<br><b>and I took the 90 minute trek from our hometown of Murfreesboro,
TN to Chapel</b>
<br><b>Hill on yet another journey to witness the legendary ghost light
over the</b>
<br><b>railroad tracks.&nbsp; This was our eighth trip out there, and previously
we had</b>
<br><b>no luck with any sighting experiences.&nbsp; The first few times
we brought ten or</b>
<br><b>twelve people with us in two or more cars.&nbsp; Most of the people
that came with</b>
<br><b>us initially got bored with the road trip to the country, and eventually
we</b>
<br><b>four were the only hardcore spookhunters that were willing to go.&nbsp;
By the</b>
<br><b>eighth trip, we had become rather apathetic about actively looking
for the</b>
<br><b>ghost, and just considered the weekly venture as an opportunity
to get out of</b>
<br><b>our hometown and be together as friends.&nbsp; Well, on the last
night any of us</b>
<br><b>ever drove out to Chapel Hill to wait for the "ghost that hunted
for his head</b>
<br><b>nightly with a swinging lamp," we decided to go to a part of the
tracks where</b>
<br><b>the road itself went UNDER the tracks.&nbsp; The girls did not want
to climb up</b>
<br><b>the hill onto the tracks so they waited in the car while Bobby and
I went up</b>
<br><b>onto the tracks and started walking.&nbsp; It was about 2 a.m.&nbsp;
Now railroad ties</b>
<br><b>are not conducive to normal walking and if one is not careful, one
could</b>
<br><b>easily trip in the darkness and get a face full of gravel to boot.&nbsp;
Needless</b>
<br><b>to say, in the pitch of night, Bobby and I were basically walking
and looking</b>
<br><b>straight down at the tracks to keep from tripping.&nbsp; Suddenly,
Bobby says, "Is</b>
<br><b>that what we're supposed to be looking for?"&nbsp; We stop walking
and observe a</b>
<br><b>glowing ball of light in the middle of the pasture on the right
side of the</b>
<br><b>tracks (the light was not ON the track itself, as the legend would
have it).</b>
<br><b>"Well, I guess... do you think that is someone over there holding
a light?" I</b>
<br><b>asked Bobby.&nbsp; "I don't know.&nbsp; I don't see anyone there,"
he replied.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>light illuminated the ground around it well enough that you could
make out</b>
<br><b>separate tufts of grass in the pasture and would have surely illuminated</b>
<br><b>anyone that was near the light itself.&nbsp; We strained our eyes
more and more to</b>
<br><b>determine the light's source.&nbsp; "It's too big to be a flashlight,"
I said.</b>
<br><b>"And a flashlight shoots light in ONE direction... usually," Bobby
offered.</b>
<br><b>In an instant the light started swaying to and fro and began directly</b>
<br><b>approaching us in a decidedly stalwart fashion.&nbsp; The hair on
my neck and arms</b>
<br><b>stood up. "What should we do?" I asked Bob.&nbsp; "Do you think
we are in some</b>
<br><b>kind of trouble?" Bobby said.&nbsp; "Bobby, can't you see there
is no one</b>
<br><b>there?!?" I hastily added.&nbsp; When the (beautiful) orange orb
was close enough</b>
<br><b>that we could actually see THROUGH it, Bobby said, "Wh-what are
we going to</b>
<br><b>do when it g-gets here, Russ?"&nbsp; Without hesitation I yelled
"RUN!"&nbsp; And we</b>
<br><b>did without looking back.&nbsp; I remember the sound of Kerrie's
little Nova</b>
<br><b>kicking gravel out of the ditch as we raced back home as fast as
the car</b>
<br><b>would go; and I tried the whole way to keep my very heart from leaping
out of</b>
<br><b>my chest.&nbsp; To this day, none of us have returned to Chapel
Hill, but I know</b>
<br><b>what we saw was extraordinary, and the event I will cherish as one
of my</b>
<br><b>fondest memories... forever.</b>

<p><b>An Austin, TX ghost</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By:karinlee@io.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Nice site.&nbsp; I've been having fun creeping myself out be reading</b>
<br><b>all the stories. :)&nbsp; I've got one of my own, as it happens.</b>
<br><b>First of all: despite the fact that ghost stories do creep me out</b>
<br><b>and make me very uncomfortable, I don't generally believe in</b>
<br><b>things that I can't see.&nbsp; I like to have proof.&nbsp; Nor am
I the</b>
<br><b>sort of person who walks into a building, slaps her hand to her</b>
<br><b>forehead, and says, "I feel a disturbance here..." or anything</b>
<br><b>like that.</b>
<br><b>That being the case.&nbsp; I'm the head of a swing dance group in</b>
<br><b>Austin, and every week, we rent out the ballroom in this large</b>
<br><b>old mansion that was built, I believe, sometime in the 1920s.</b>
<br><b>There's a teaching group as well, which uses the building for its</b>
<br><b>lessons.&nbsp; The teachers from the group, myself, and some of
the</b>
<br><b>other volunteers for the swing dance group have all had some</b>
<br><b>strange and inexplicable things happen to us there.</b>
<br><b>Once, during a class, one of the teachers had put a CD down on a</b>
<br><b>table.&nbsp; It fell off -- not simply in a gravity-wins way.&nbsp;
It was</b>
<br><b>almost as if someone had flicked the disc off of the table.</b>
<br><b>Another time, one of our volunteers heard running water coming</b>
<br><b>from the upstairs bathroom.&nbsp; He found the shower running full</b>
<br><b>blast, with no one around, and no sign of anyone using it.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>tried to shut it off -- and couldn't.</b>
<br><b>Finally, my own story.&nbsp; One night, I was closing up after a</b>
<br><b>dance, turning off lights and locking doors.&nbsp; There's a hallway</b>
<br><b>that goes from the ballroom to the rest of the mansion; as you're</b>
<br><b>standing in the ballroom door, the other end of the hall has a</b>
<br><b>short fight of stairs going up, and a pair of doors at the top of</b>
<br><b>the stairs.&nbsp; The light switch for the hall is on that end.</b>
<br><b>This evening, one of the doors was fully shut, the other standing</b>
<br><b>ajar.&nbsp; I headed down the hall to turn off the lights; halfway</b>
<br><b>there, the open door literally slammed shut.&nbsp; There was no
one</b>
<br><b>else back there.&nbsp; There was no draft, no error of ventilation</b>
<br><b>that could have pushed it shut...in other words, no reasonable</b>
<br><b>explanation.&nbsp; I shut off the lights and ran back into the</b>
<br><b>ballroom as fast as my feet could take me.</b>
<br><b>There are other stories, but those are the best-known ones around</b>
<br><b>here.&nbsp; We'd like to research this building a bit more and find</b>
<br><b>out about it; so far, nothing.&nbsp; I'm still a skeptic, although
I</b>
<br><b>can't deny the slamming door.</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The experiences I will be relating involve
the restoration of a 19th</b>
<br><b>century two-story home in suburban Pennsylvania and the odd occurrences
I</b>
<br><b>witnessed therein.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little over a year and a half ago, right
before I turned 15, my friend</b>
<br><b>Brian's&nbsp; parents purchased a run-down 19th century home which
they planned to</b>
<br><b>restore and subsequently move into. I had been having trouble at
home and</b>
<br><b>these wonderful people, who I'll refer to as "the Jones'" , understood
my</b>
<br><b>situation and allowed me to stay with them on many occasions. The
Jones' have</b>
<br><b>two sons one of whom is my best friend Brian, the other is his five
year old</b>
<br><b>brother Franky.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most evenings Mr. Jones would return from
work and head over to the old</b>
<br><b>home to complete restoration on it. The plan was to move in by the
following</b>
<br><b>summer.</b>
<br><b>Many times the whole family would go along with him to help out
and when I</b>
<br><b>was&nbsp; there I'd go along to do my part as well. It was the middle
of summer</b>
<br><b>and hot as hell outside, inside Mr. Jones had already gutted the
place out.</b>
<br><b>Now he was concentrating on re-wiring the old place and other such
things. My</b>
<br><b>friend Brian and I would go the house alot with Mr. Jones, especially
on</b>
<br><b>weekends where we usually would spend the whole day working with
no air</b>
<br><b>conditioning. The heat was stifling inside the house on those hot
summer</b>
<br><b>days,especially on the second floor where it was our job to lay
the flooring</b>
<br><b>down and nail it into place.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first strange incident I recall occurred
while my friend and I were</b>
<br><b>upstairs staining the floors. He was staining the master bedroom
and I was in</b>
<br><b>the smaller room across the hall. I had an old radio in the room
I was</b>
<br><b>working in which we'd blast everyday, the music helped us cope with
the heat</b>
<br><b>and get our work done faster. I had the radio tuned to our usual
station and</b>
<br><b>walked out to the hallway to get a Coke. When i returned the radio
was</b>
<br><b>playing a different station from where it had just been just a few
seconds</b>
<br><b>before. Not thinking too much about it, I re-adjusted the dial and
got back</b>
<br><b>to work. I had to leave the room again , this time to go outside
and help</b>
<br><b>Brian and his dad carry in some wood. When I got back upstairs the
station</b>
<br><b>again had been changed, the needle had moved all the way over opposite
the</b>
<br><b>side. Still wanting to believe it was nothing , I returned it once
more to my</b>
<br><b>station. Again I left and again it had been changed when I got back,
I looked</b>
<br><b>around the room, it was just a small square room but I had the sensation
I</b>
<br><b>wasn't alone in there.&nbsp; This happened again and again while
I was the only</b>
<br><b>person upstairs in the house. It got to the point where I'd turn
my back only</b>
<br><b>to hear the station change right when I was in the room. I told
Brian and his</b>
<br><b>dad about it and we all sort of laughed it off attributing it&nbsp;
to some odd</b>
<br><b>atmospheric condition.</b>
<br><b>This occurrence continued for many days then slowly subsided.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some time later, I had the job of preparing
the basement floor for</b>
<br><b>painting. It's more like a cellar really with creek stone walls
and half the</b>
<br><b>floor had been dirt before Mr. Jones had cemented over top. I was
to sweep it</b>
<br><b>clean and then use the shop vac. on it. By this time two little
neighbor boys</b>
<br><b>,4 and 6, had become friendly with Brians little brother Franky
and they were</b>
<br><b>over here quite alot. They would keep franky busy playing outside
while we</b>
<br><b>all worked inside. On this day, I was sweeping the basement floor,
everyone</b>
<br><b>else had left for various reasons and having no plans of my own,
I had</b>
<br><b>volunteered to stay and get the floor ready for painting the next
day. As I</b>
<br><b>worked, every once in a while I'd hear this banging sound, sort
of like</b>
<br><b>someone hitting cement with a hammer and it was coming from a corner
in the</b>
<br><b>basement by the floor which was directly under the house and no
where near</b>
<br><b>the outside door . It startled me at first, and everytime it would
bang id</b>
<br><b>stop working and nervously look around. I'd wait for it to bang
again but it</b>
<br><b>would only bang once I continued my work. It sounds crazy but it
was as if</b>
<br><b>whatever was making that sound purposely waited to do it until I
started</b>
<br><b>sweeping the floor again. The banging started to wear on my nerves,
to the</b>
<br><b>point where I became quite agitated and said outloud "Would you
STOP that</b>
<br><b>banging?!"</b>
<br><b>I thought about every possible thing that could be causing the noise
but none</b>
<br><b>came to mind, the plumbing wasn't even installed yet nor was the
furnace,</b>
<br><b>everything had been ripped out. There is a door in the basement
which when</b>
<br><b>opened leads up a flight of stairs to some swinging doors that lead
outside.</b>
<br><b>The little 6 yr. old boy from next door walked down the steps and
into the</b>
<br><b>basement to see what I was up to. He wanted to help me sweep the
floor and as</b>
<br><b>I was showing him how to use the broom we heard "bang!" , he and
I both</b>
<br><b>jumped and he asked what that sound was. I told him I thought the
house was</b>
<br><b>haunted and he got this scared sorta "deer looking into headlights"</b>
<br><b>expression so I laughed and told him I was only kidding. I didn't
want to</b>
<br><b>scare the poor kid. As he helped me sweep it banged a few more times,
then we</b>
<br><b>left. When i got back to the Jones' and told them about the sound
they also</b>
<br><b>had no explanation for it .</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day as we started to paint the
basement floor,Brian and I</b>
<br><b>continued to hear the occasional banging. After we finished, it
stopped and</b>
<br><b>to this day we've never heard it again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next odd occurrance happened again
when I was in the house alone,I</b>
<br><b>had noticed the strange happenings in the house seemed to center
around me.</b>
<br><b>It was a Saturday night , early fall, almost midnite and I was sanding
some</b>
<br><b>french glass doors in the kitchen. All the electric had been done
in the</b>
<br><b>house and I had the sander plugged in and also the radio, which
was blasting</b>
<br><b>so that I could hear the music above the loud hum of the machine.
All at</b>
<br><b>once, the sander and radio died, but the lights remained on. I jumped
as the</b>
<br><b>phone rang shattering the silence. It was Mrs. Jones telling me
that she had</b>
<br><b>become worried about me working so late in the house all alone and
had been</b>
<br><b>trying to call me for an hour. This was her last attempt to reach
me before</b>
<br><b>she was going to hop in the car and drive the 1/2 hr. to get me.</b>
<br><b>I explained how I had happened to hear the phone ring , Mr. Jones
came to the</b>
<br><b>phone and asked if a breaker had popped but I told him the lights
were on in</b>
<br><b>the kitchen and he said that would impossible because it's all on
the same</b>
<br><b>breaker. After hanging up with him the radio BLASTED back to life
as did the</b>
<br><b>sander, almost scaring me to death. After that I called Mr. Jones
and asked</b>
<br><b>him to please come pick me up because I was scared out of my mind.
How the</b>
<br><b>radio and sander turned off and managed to turn back on again is
beyond my</b>
<br><b>comprehension.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scariest thing that i've ever witnessed
in this house happened one</b>
<br><b>night when Brian, his little brother, and I were here alone. The
Jones' had</b>
<br><b>dropped us off some take- out and we had planned to do some spackeling
and</b>
<br><b>possibly sleep on the floor on an old air mattress they owned. Brian
and I</b>
<br><b>did some work on the first floor while Franky played with his toy
cars,</b>
<br><b>building bridges and roads with some old wood scraps that were lying
about.</b>
<br><b>We took a break and ate our food sitting on the livingroom floor
since there</b>
<br><b>was no furniture as of yet in the house. As we sat at our makeshift
table</b>
<br><b>Brian turned on the radio and Franky started to dance and jump all
around the</b>
<br><b>room. In the living room is the doorway to the cellar where there's
a long</b>
<br><b>flight of steps that descend down into the darkness. The doors weren't
in</b>
<br><b>place yet and so as a safety precaution we had placed a big board
to cover</b>
<br><b>the door way down into the cellar so that Franky couldn't fall down
the</b>
<br><b>steps. The only phone/answering machine in the house was down in
the cellar,</b>
<br><b>and without the lanterns we use for working down there it was very
dark with</b>
<br><b>only one bulb to light the place. Brian had decided to go down and
check the</b>
<br><b>messages so&nbsp; he slid the board over and then back&nbsp; into
place once he was on</b>
<br><b>the other side. Franky had continued to dance around and wanted
to play ring</b>
<br><b>around a rosey , which, while feeling rather foolish, I did with
him. We fell</b>
<br><b>down and laughed, as were on the floor I heard Brian coming back
up the</b>
<br><b>stairs and saw the board slide open but Brian never walked through
the</b>
<br><b>opening. Franky said "why didn't Brian come up?"&nbsp; As the seconds
passed I</b>
<br><b>became concerned and called out to him going ,myself ,over to the
opening and</b>
<br><b>looking down. As I walked down the stairs I could hear him over
on the other</b>
<br><b>side of the room listening to messages and as I got to the bottom
step saw</b>
<br><b>him writing them down for his parents. I asked if everything was
ok and why</b>
<br><b>he had come up but never come thru the doorway to which he replied
he hadn't.</b>
<br><b>In fact he said he had heard someone on the stairway and had thought
it was</b>
<br><b>me coming down. I thought it certain he was joking and after I told
him what</b>
<br><b>had happened he swore up and down that it hadn't been him. That's
when we</b>
<br><b>started to get scared, because we realized that SOMEONE other than
ourselves</b>
<br><b>had walked up the stairway and pushed the board aside so he/she/it
could</b>
<br><b>enter the room, or maybe it was just trying to scare us. We called
his</b>
<br><b>parents and told them, they were pretty concerned and came right
away to pick</b>
<br><b>us up. I have to admit that before they arrived we were pretty much
FREAKING</b>
<br><b>OUT !&nbsp; the whole time. The Jones' took it all very seriously
even to the</b>
<br><b>point of blessing the house and annointing it with oil.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that night I always got the creeps
whenever I'd come into the</b>
<br><b>house and especially down here in the basement. Coincedentially,
the basement</b>
<br><b>is where i live now and from where i'm writing this story. It's
not as dark</b>
<br><b>and dismal as it once was, the creek stone walls are now a cheerful
snow</b>
<br><b>white and the floor is a soothing blue/gray,and im no longer afraid
of this</b>
<br><b>house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a footnote, there was one frightening
occurrence just in the past few</b>
<br><b>months that happened to me late one nite while I was in the kitchen
getting a</b>
<br><b>drink. It must've been around 3am and I was standing near the sink
with my</b>
<br><b>back to the livingroom doorway when I heard a soft whisper like
voice call my</b>
<br><b>name once. I turned looking at the doorway to the living room from
which the</b>
<br><b>sound seemed to eminate and seeing no one assumed it was just my
imagination.</b>
<br><b>Then as I turned around to the sink I heard it a second time "zeke"
i heard</b>
<br><b>it whisper, and then a third time. Now I was sure I had heard someone
calling</b>
<br><b>me. Who or what it was I have no idea, but I DO know that every
hair on my</b>
<br><b>body stood straight up and I got the creepiest feeling. Be assured
I RAN up</b>
