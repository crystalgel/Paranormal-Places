<P>
<P>September 22, 1973 brought much sadness and happiness to my family. That
was the day 
<P>that I was born and my Great Grandmother was buried. I never knew anything
of my Great 
<P>Grandmother until I was 4 years old. I remember the visit like it was


yesterday even 
<P>though I meet her so long ago.
<P>
<P>I was asleep at my Grandparents house (my Great Grandma lived there too
before she 
<P>died)and for some strange reason I suddenly woke up in the middle of the
night with a 
<P>feeling that someone was looking at me. I opened my eyes and I saw an
old lady looking 
<P>at me. At the age of 4, I was scared out of my mind. I remember her telling
me not to be 
<P>afraid and that she was only there to look at me because she never got
a chance to. I 
<P>started to yell and just before my Grandmother came into the room to check
on me the old 
<P>lady disappeared. I told my Grandma what had happened and she told me
that it was just a 
<P>bad dream.
<P>
<P>The morning when I got up, I saw a picture of my Great Grandmother in
my Grandparents 
<P>bedroom and I told my Grandmother that that was the lady who visited me
in the middle of 
<P>the night. And that is when I found out the story about her dying 3 days


before I was 
<P>born. And deep down I know my Grandmother believes me and that I was not


having a bad 
<P>dream.

<P>
<P><B>This is a very true tale. Two years ago my father in-law died of cancer


</B>
<P><B>of the throat. He died early in the afternoon at home in his own bed,


</B>
<P><B>just as he wished. That evening I sat in my bedroom grieving for him.
I </B>
<P><B>heard a cough and I thought to my self, "God, that sounds like Barry."


</B>
<P><B>Apart from my 2 teenage daughters (his only grandchildren) I was the
only </B>
<P><B>one in the house. When I turned to look in the direction of the cough,


</B>
<P><B>there stood Barry. He looked just as alive as you or I, with one </B>
<P><B>differance, he was not thin or ill looking.</B>
<P>
<P><B>He said these words to me which at the time made no sense whatsoever
to </B>
<P><B>me, "Would you please tell Caroline (my youngest daughter) I am very
</B>
<P><B>sorry I did not buy her the green frog? When I was alive I didn't have


</B>
<P><B>the time and when I was dying THAT took up all my time. I have lots
of </B>
<P><B>time now and I would buy her one, but I seem to have left my wallet
at </B>
<P><B>home." Then he vanished.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next day I duly gave his message to my daughter and asked her if
it </B>
<P><B>made sense to her. She burst into tears and gave me this explanation.


</B>
<P><B>When they were young children they would visit their poppa every sunday


</B>
<P><B>for a few hours. He would take them to a cake shop and buy them a pastry


</B>
<P><B>in the shape of a green frog. Since I was not eager for my kids to
</B>
<P><B>consume treats, it became a tradition that I was not let in on.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The week before he died Caroline had been visiting him and holding
his </B>
<P><B>hand, his mind was wondering and he apologised for not buying her a
frog </B>
<P><B>on her 14 birthday. She had asked for one but he said she was too big
a </B>
<P><B>girl at 14.</B>
<P>
<P><B>For some reason this was still bothering him in the afterlife.</B>

</H3><P><B>by engl000b@frank.mtsu.edu</B>
<P>
<P> <B>Today you hear many stories of ghost and the supernatural.  I never
</B>
<P><B>paid much attention to ghost stories until my sister and her boyfriend


</B>
<P><B>had an experience that almost makes my skin crawl.  They both  saw
a </B>
<P><B>ghostly spirit in the same place on the same eerie night.</B>
<P><B>       My sister, Andrea, and her boyfriend, Mitch, were staying at
my </B>
<P><B>fathers house in Evansville, Indiana.  It is an older house, I would
say </B>
<P><B>about fifty years old and the basement was the only place in the house


</B>
<P><B>that had room for Andrea and Mitch to sleep.  The basement is old with


</B>
<P><B>concrete floors and has no ceiling.  When you look up, you can see
the </B>
<P><B>water pipes, and any other kind of piping the house has.  It is really


</B>
<P><B>kind of creepy.  The smell is musty and it feels damp.  There are only


</B>
<P><B>four rooms down there: a junk room, which is never opened up, the washer


</B>
<P><B>and dryer room, a bedroom which has a wooden door with vents, and just
an </B>
<P><B>old den that has no use now.  When you are down there, you can hear
</B>
<P><B>everything going on upstairs, and you can hear the furnace kick on
and </B>
<P><B>off which is kind of spooky.  </B>
<P><B>     One cold winter night, Andrea and Mitch were going to bed.  They


</B>
<P><B>went down the stairs and into the bedroom.  They made sure to shut
the </B>
<P><B>door behind them, so that if someone came down to do laundry the door


</B>
<P><B>would keep some sound out. They crawled into bed and slowly drifted
off </B>
<P><B>to sleep.  Andrea recalls about three hours later thinking someone
was </B>
<P><B>standing over her; she rolled over onto her back and opened her eyes.


 </B>
<P><B>Much to her surprise stood an old man with overalls on and an old farmers


</B>
<P><B>cap standing by the bed staring at her.  She started to kick the covers


</B>
<P><B>off of her because she wanted out of that room quick.  She was frightened


</B>
<P><B>so bad that she couldn't scream or make any kind of sounds.  She says


</B>
<P><B>when she started kicking the man just stepped back to the wall, but
was </B>
<P><B>still staring at her.  She ran directly passed him, opened the door,
 </B>
<P><B>went upstairs and got our dad.  My dad came down to check it out, while


</B>
<P><B>in the meantime Mitch slept  through the whole situation.  When my
dad </B>
<P><B>flipped on all of the lights there was no one in sight.   Naturally,
it </B>
<P><B>took my sister a while to be able to go back to sleep, but she finally


</B>
<P><B>did.  Well, about an hour later, Mitch woke up and rolled over  towards


</B>
<P><B>the door, which was shut, and he saw a woman's figure.  He thought
the </B>
<P><B>woman was our step mom so he spoke out, "Sherry, what are you doing
down </B>
<P><B>here this late?". The figure just floated off into the vented door.
 He </B>
<P><B>then realized, the figure was not our step mom, but a ghost.  He woke
my </B>
<P><B>sister up, and told her what had just happened.  With no hesitance,
they </B>
<P><B>both went upstairs and slept at the foot of our father's bed.  </B>
<P><B>     The only thing we can figure out is that these lost spirits were


</B>
<P><B>looking for one another.  Maybe they had unfinished business to do
when </B>
<P><B>they died, or maybe they never got to tell each other good-bye and
they </B>
<P><B>are stuck between worlds.  You never know, but I do know that I believe


</B>
<P><B>in lost spirits now.  I believe that if someone passes away in a sudden


</B>
<P><B>death, they do not really realize that they are dead so their bodies
</B>
<P><B>float around trying to take care of things that were left undone. 
I </B>
<P><B>believe when the lost spirit or ghost is at peace with himself, he
will </B>
<P><B>pass to another world.</B>

<P>
<P><B>Hello.  My name is Chris.  I am 14 years old.  My parents and I went
on a trip to Maine </B>
<P><B>to visit some of their friends.  While were staying there, we had rented
a small single </B>
<P><B>family house.  The house was built in 1935 and it was outside of town.
 My parents don't </B>
<P><B>believe me.  But while I was in the bathroom.  I saw and apparition
of just a face.  No </B>
<P><B>body.  Just a face.  I saw it in the shower.  Scared me to death. 
After that I would </B>
<P><B>only go to the bathroom during daytime.  My parents went into the bathroom

all the time </B>
<P><B>wether it be night or day after I saw the apparition.  One night after
I saw it a month </B>
<P><B>ago, I got up to go to the bathroom and I thought it couldn't be real.
 So I went </B>
<P><B>in...and I saw it again.  It freaked me out so bad, I told my parents
that I am not </B>
<P><B>staying in the house for the rest of the summer.  So I went and stayed
in a motel with </B>
<P><B>my big brother john.  They stayed at the house a while afterwards and
they saw nothing. </B>
<P><B> Why was I the only one to see it? Well, that's my real life encounter
with a "ghost"</B>

</H3><P><B>by cmp009@kali.nas.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I used to live in a house that was about 90 years old.  The only people

that had ever </B>
<P><B>inhabited the house were members of my step-fathers family, and nobody
had ever died in </B>
<P><B>the house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was about 10, my mother used to tell my sister and I that she
had heard somebody </B>
<P><B>walking around the ground floor of our two-story house....neither my
siter( who is two </B>
<P><B>years younger than myself ) or I had been up the previous night.  No

explanation could be </B>
<P><B>found.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was 14, my youngest sister was born, and this is when what I
call the haunting </B>
<P><B>really intensified.  Both my 'older' younger sister and I heard somebody

walking around </B>
<P><B>the house, both on the stairs to the second floor, as well as the stairs
to the basement. </B>
<P><B> During this time, we both had bedrooms on the ground floor.  We never

actually heard </B>
<P><B>anything on the ground floor, just on the staircases to both of the
other floors.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Not long after this, I was laying in my bed, trying to get to sleep
one night.  My </B>
<P><B>'older' sister had a bedroom opposite my own, with a bathroom in between

us.  There was a </B>
<P><B>door from either bedroom into the bathroom.  I heard the door on her
side open, </B>
<P><B>footsteps, and then the door on my side open.  I also heard very

distinctive footsteps on </B>
<P><B>my floor....the floor ALWAYS creaked when anybody walked across it.
 I assumed that my </B>
<P><B>younger sister had a nightmare or something, and had come into my room
to sleep as she </B>
<P><B>had done many times in the past.  I heard four or five footsteps, then

nothing.  I </B>
<P><B>waited, and waited, and waited...fully expecting her to say something
to me along the </B>
<P><B>lines of "I can't sleep, can I sleep in here?".  Nothing came.  I finally

rolled over, </B>
<P><B>and saw somebody dressed in a flowing white gown standing about 15
feet from my bedside. </B>
<P><B> I have poor eyesight, and at the time wore glasses exlusively.  I
still assumed this to </B>
<P><B>be my sister, and said something to the effect of, "What?  You can't
sleep?  You can stay </B>
<P><B>in here if you want to.".  I then waited, and the person said nothing
to me, just stood </B>
<P><B>there.  I thought that my sister was either sleep-walking, or didn't
want to wake our </B>
<P><B>parents by saying anything, so I rolled over again.  I waited about
a mintue, then rolled </B>
<P><B>over, and there was nobody there.  I heard no footsteps leaving the

room....I got out of </B>
<P><B>bed, walked over to my sisters room, and found her sound asleep in
here bed and she was </B>
<P><B>NOT wearing anything even remotely close to the what the figure I saw
in my room had been </B>
<P><B>wearing.  Needless to say, I did not sleep very much the rest of the

night.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Once my youngest sister was around one, I volunteered to move into
the basement, while my </B>
<P><B>older sister remained on the ground floor.  My youngest sister took
over the room that my </B>
<P><B>older sister had been in, and she in turn took my old bedroom.  Not
long after this, my </B>
<P><B>mother revieled to us that she had seen several green lights floating

around my baby </B>
<P><B>sister's bedroom....no source for the lights could be found or explained.

 The footsteps </B>
<P><B>continued to be heard by all members of the family, and my 'older'
sister and myself were </B>
<P><B>still being blamed for this.  When my youngest sister turned two (
I was 16 at the time </B>
<P><B>), she started telling everyone that she wanted the man in her room
to leave.  Nobody </B>
<P><B>besides myself ( as far as I know ) ever saw ANYBODY in the house that

should'nt be </B>
<P><B>there, yet my youngest sister constantly complained about the man in
her room, and she </B>
<P><B>wanted him to leave.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One of the WORST episodes I ever experienced in this house is when
I was about 17, and my </B>
<P><B>younger sister was 15.  We were sitting watching TV in the living room,
and nobody else </B>
<P><B>was home.  The main entrance to our house was off of the kitchen, where
you would walk </B>
<P><B>through the door, then through a pair of bar-style doors into the kitchen.

 We both very </B>
<P><B>distinctly heard the main door open and close, the bar-style doors
swing open and close, </B>
<P><B>then somebody walk across the kitchen floor into the dining room. 
The entire ground </B>
<P><B>floor creaked when you walked on it....there was absolutely no mistaking

somebody walking </B>
<P><B>on the ground floor.  We both assumed it was our mother coming home
that eveing, and both </B>
<P><B>of us called out "Mom?".  No answer.  Again with "Mom?", and again
no answer.  We then </B>
<P><B>walked out of the living room into the kitchen, and looked around.
 Nobody to be seen.  I </B>
<P><B>then walked to the front door, and the chain-lock on the door was in
place and the door </B>
<P><B>was locked.  Still, nobody anywhere in the house.  My sister was still
in the kitchen </B>
<P><B>when I went into the aforementioned bathroom between the two bedrooms
on the ground </B>
<P><B>floor.  I turned on the light, looked around, found nobody in either
the bedrooms or the </B>
<P><B>bathroom, then turned off the light....only the light would not turn
off!  The lights </B>
<P><B>dimmed to about 50% luminosity even though the switch was completely
off.  The lights in </B>
<P><B>this bathroom never did this before, nor did they ever do it again!
 My sister and I, </B>
<P><B>finding nobody in the house, decided it was probably a good time to
leave and got out of </B>
<P><B>the house as quickly as possible.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now, the WORST episode in the house came when I was 19, my younger
sister was 17, and she </B>
<P><B>had a friend living in the house of the same age.  Her friend had a
Ouija board, and for </B>
<P><B>fun, they pulled it out and asked who the cause of the haunting was.
 The board came up </B>
<P><B>with the answer of "Brad", our step-father.  It also, on it's on (
and without prompting </B>
<P><B>), said "Get out".  Very short, very simple.  We moved out of the house
not long after </B>
<P><B>this episode, and the house and grounds have been sold and buldozed.
 There is now a </B>
<P><B>major hardware store sitting on the site....I can't wait to here what

anyone who works </B>
<P><B>there has to say.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Everything I've told you is 100% accurate, and I would swear on a 100

bibles and 100 </B>
<P><B>polygraphs to the accuracy of this....even as I was typing it, the
hair on the back of my </B>
<P><B>neck is standing on end.  I had NEVER believed in ghosts until we moved

into this house, </B>
<P><B>and I thank my lucky stars that we moved a looooooong way away from
it, and have left </B>
<P><B>Brad behind!  I have absolutely no explantion for this haunting.  The
one thing I can </B>
<P><B>tell you is that I experienced a lot of things in this house that I

wouldn't wish upon my </B>
<P><B>worst enemy, and hope to NEVER experience again.</B>

<H3><A NAME=cowboy>The Cowboy</A>
</H3><P><B>by joanbob1@ix.netcom.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was five years old, I was befriended by a cowboy.  Our house
</B>
<P><B>was built on land that was formerly the "Hastings Ranch" in southern
</B>
<P><B>California.  My cowboy had red hair, wore a red bandana, plaid shirt,

</B>
<P><B>blue jeans.  I cannot say how old he was, because I was so young at
</B>
<P><B>that time.  But he seemed at least as old as my father.  I do not </B>
<P><B>recall seeing his feet.  In any case, he just appeared one day while
I </B>
<P><B>was outside enjoying our swing.  He told me he would be my friend and

</B>
<P><B>I gladly accommodated him.  I loved horses at the time and he always
</B>
<P><B>had many, many horse stories to tell me.   He would tell me when I
had </B>
<P><B>to go back inside to eat dinner, when I could go across the street
to </B>
<P><B>visit my girlfriend.  It soon became a big joke in my family, and in
</B>
<P><B>the neighborhood, that I had an "imaginary friend."  I recall once
my </B>
<P><B>older sister teasing me about my imaginary friend and he was standing

</B>
<P><B>right beside her.  I asked her, "but can't you see him?"  She said,
</B>
<P><B>"No."  I was the only one who could see him.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was so enthralled by his horse stories, and accounts of his cowboy
</B>
<P><B>days!  One day, he told me if I dug in a certain spot, I would find
an </B>
<P><B>old cowboy boot.  Excitedly, I started to dig where he indicated the
</B>
<P><B>boot would be.  I first uncovered some rusty barbed wire, but then
I </B>
<P><B>uncovered the boot!!  It was brown, rotten leather and I could hardly

</B>
<P><B>contain my excitement as I showed my mother the prize my cowboy had
</B>
<P><B>given me.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>"Get that filthy thing out of the house and wash your hands after you

</B>
<P><B>do!!"</B>
<P>
<P><B>I reburied the boot where I had found it.  It is probably still there.

</B>
<P>
<P><B>As I grew older, his appearances became less frequent.  Once, I hadn't

</B>
<P><B>seen him in a few weeks and I was getting concerned.  I went into the

</B>
<P><B>breezeway area of our house and, to my delight, he was standing right

</B>
<P><B>there.  "There you are!" I said, "I've been looking for you."  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I cannot recall what he told me that day.  But I do recall that </B>
<P><B>finally, one day, he told me I would not be seeing him anymore.  I
</B>
<P><B>remember that it was just before I was to start first grade.  After
</B>
<P><B>that, I never saw him again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The cowboy was the nice ghost.  But our house was filled with other,
</B>
<P><B>malevolent spirits that filled my younger sister and I with fear. 
For </B>
<P><B>instance, we shared a bedroom together and often heard the footsteps
</B>
<P><B>of heavy boots tramping on the roof from one end of the house to the
</B>
<P><B>other.  My older brother and sister never heard these footsteps on
the </B>
<P><B>roof, even when they were tramping over their own bedrooms.  Once,
at </B>
<P><B>our insistence, our father went out in the dark and checked the roof.

 </B>
<P><B>Of course, he found nothing.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My younger sister and I also heard the clicking of slippers going down

</B>
<P><B>the hall of our house, which passed the children's bedrooms.  Again,
</B>
<P><B>none of our siblings heard these slippers.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Finally, there was the blue bathroom in our home.  It was always </B>
<P><B>inordinately cold and always had a spooky feeling to it.  One evening,

</B>
<P><B>during dinner, I left the dinner table for reasons I cannot recall.
 </B>
<P><B>Again, I was five or six years old.  I got up on the counter to look
</B>
<P><B>at my face closely in the mirror.  As I was doing so, I saw movement
</B>
<P><B>behind me.  When I looked down, I saw a bizarre creature behind me,
a </B>
<P><B>stocky, brown, tree-trunk like figure, reaching up to grab me with
</B>
<P><B>long branch-like arms.  I scooted across the counter, but could not
</B>
<P><B>avoid it and it pulled me down onto the floor.  The next thing I </B>
<P><B>recall is being on the floor, crying, with my whole family standing
</B>
<P><B>around me.  When I told them what happened, they did not believe me.
 </B>
<P><B>Still, as an adult, I have nightmares about that blue bathroom.  </B>

</H3><P><B>by price@connect.reach.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have many ghost stories to tell but I will just tell you about two
of my </B>
<P><B>experiences.  I was about 18 years old at the time working as an assistant

chef in an </B>
<P><B>old house  that was turned into a restaurant.  I  have seen ghosts
and felt presences </B>
<P><B>since I was very young so I wasn't shocked when I had my most exciting

experience.  I </B>
<P><B>started having dreams of a young women who always looked the same.
 When I would go to </B>
<P><B>the cellar to get some food I could hear a women calling my name. 
I didn't know if I </B>
<P><B>was going crazy or if it was real.  When I went back up stairs into
the food prep room </B>
<P><B>with my back towards the door.  I heard someone calling my name expecting

to see my boss </B>
<P><B>I turned around and seen an image of this lady that I had been dreaming

about.  The hair </B>
<P><B>stood up all over my body.  I turned around to continue working when
two containers flew </B>
<P><B>off the shelf, one hitting me and one going across the room.  Later
I found a picture of </B>
<P><B>the lady standing in front of the house dressed in the exact same dress

that I seen her </B>
<P><B>in.  I knew then that I wasn't crazy. </B>
<P><B>  My second story concerns animals.  I have a very deep connection
with my animals.  I </B>
<P><B>worked at a horse stable and when I was cleaning out the stalls I would

hear a horse </B>
<P><B>with shoes on walking on the concrete on the other side of the barn.

 Thinking one of </B>
<P><B>the horses got back in I went to investigate.  I walked over to the
other side of the </B>
<P><B>barn and I seen a near solid horse vision standing in a stall swinging
his head up and </B>
<P><B>down.  I was curious of why this horse would continue to stay around.
 I questioned my </B>
<P><B>boss who is also a believer in the ghost world about this horse I see.
 I fully </B>
<P><B>described him explaining that one day he was sick and the next day
he was well again.  </B>
<P><B>She told me that it sounded like a horse that was put to sleep because
of a condition </B>
<P><B>known as the heaves where one day he was sick and the next day he was
okay.  Eventually </B>
<P><B>I seen less of him until his visits stopped.</B>

</H3><P><B>by galaxy@wpl.webster.lib.la.us</B>
<P>
<P><B>My family had just moved into this house from a different part of town,
it didn't seem</B>
<P><B>strange just driving by.  Once I came and got settled in I began to
hear strange</B>
<P><B>noises as if someone were walking around the ceiling in my room. The

entrance</B>
<P><B>to the attic was on the outside of the house, so I thought that it
was probably</B>
<P><B>just an animal that had wandered into the opening. The next day I went
up to</B>
<P><B>get whatever it was out so I could get some sleep the next night. 
I didn't</B>
<P><B>really believe in ghosts before this event occurred, but since then
my ideas</B>
<P><B>about the supernatural have changed drastically.  As I walked up the

stairs</B>
<P><B>a got really cold and the scent of antiquity became more apparent.
 This </B>
<P><B>surprised me because it was the middle of August and in definately
isn't that </B>
<P><B>cold in the south.  I heard a voice and it told me that it wanted my
family to leave.</B>
<P><B>I thought it was just my imagination and tried to find the source of
the noise, that</B>
<P><B>had kept me awake.  I came upon a large wooden mirror, in it I could
see my length</B>
<P><B>and the rest of the room behind me the cool feeling came back and I
felt a</B>
<P><B>cold clamy sensation on my neck I just stared into the mirror and behind

me</B>
<P><B>appeared a woman, she was very beautiful, but she held a look of sadness

that</B>
<P><B>I had never seen before.  I wasn't afraid she then spoke to me saying

we</B>
<P><B>had to leave before her husband came home.  I told her that the only
man </B>
<P><B>here was my father.  Then from out of no where came a sudden gust of
wind and</B>
<P><B>a dark cloud. I turned to look at her again, but she was gone.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I encountered her several more times and each time she told me the

samething.</B>
<P><B>Never was I afraid of her, but each time she left the same dark cloud
came and a bad smell.</B>
<P><B>I was out in the garden one night with a few close friends when she
came running from the house</B>
<P><B>I was sure of my sanity then because everyone else saw it as well.
 She was </B>
<P><B>wringing her hands and opened her mouth to speak but nothing came out.

</B>
<P>
<P><B>I did some research at the local library.  It turned out that our house

 once belonged</B>
<P><B>to Richard and Elizabeth  Montgomery in the early 1900's . Richard

murdered</B>
<P><B>Elizabeth and then shot himself. He thought that she had an afair with
his </B>
<P><B>brother and anger got the best of him. To make a long story short we
had the </B>
<P><B>house blessed and every once in a while, I still get a visit from her,
but she seems</B>
<P><B>happier now. The evil spirit is gone, I hope she can find peace now.</B>

last</B>
<P><B>night ,of course they did not									then came the dreams,not your</B>
<P><B>normal dreams but dreams of being thrown around the very room you
slept</B>
<P><B>in ,not being able to see your attaker, It's not very often that I</B>
<P><B>remember a dream for more than a couple of hrs after i wake up, to

a</B>
<P><B>shadow right beside my bed . you can't believe the chills i am
getting</B>
<P><B>,right this very moment as I describe what had happened.my sister got</B>
<P><B>kicked in her bed,my younger sister heard foot steps going from one
room</B>
<P><B>to another the eery feeling of being watched everytime we went
upstairs</B>
<P><B>or in the basement,I always felt that feeling in between my shoulder</B>
<P><B>blades.house plants that never grew but stayed dorment.What i"m about
to</B>

</H3><P><B>by sievers@localnet.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My story starts when I was nineteen years old. I started dating a guy
who </B>
<P><B>was in the US Navy attached to a submarine stationed out of Norfolk
</B>
<P><B>Virginia. He was one of the nicest fellows I had ever dated at that
time. </B>
<P><B>He treated me like a lady and I fell in love with him and we were married
</B>
<P><B>within the year. </B>
<P>
<P><B>The first time he took me over to his house (which actually was owned
by </B>
<P><B>his parents who lived out of state) he had been to sea for a couple
of </B>
<P><B>weeks,the house being closed up for that length of time. When he unlocked
</B>
<P><B>the door and walked in he said " Hello, house, I'm home!". Now, I never
</B>
<P><B>thought he was strange, but at that moment I thought he had lost his
</B>
<P><B>mind! I asked him why he had said that and his response was that the
</B>
<P><B>house was haunted and he wanted to stay on the ghost's good side. I,at
</B>
<P><B>this point didn't know what to think.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The story he told about his first experience was interesting. He had
been </B>
<P><B>out partying with some friends and came home a bit in the bag. He went
to </B>
<P><B>sleep and later woke up hearing something breathing heavily. He thought,
</B>
<P><B>Okay, I've been drinking and I am probably hearing myself breath or
maybe </B>
<P><B>I was snoring. He then held his breath for a minute, but the breathing
</B>
<P><B>did not stop! He jumped out of bed, threw his clothes on and drove
the </B>
<P><B>hour or so to the Norfolk Navy Base to spend the night on his
submarine.</B>
<P>
<P><B>He later returned home, thinking that it was because he had been drinking
</B>
<P><B>that he had thought he had heard the breathing. Not so! Things started
to </B>
<P><B>disappear and turn up much later in the strangest places. Sometimes
he </B>
<P><B>would get a feeling of approval from somewhere if he was doing something
</B>
<P><B>domestic such as sewing hash marks or patches on his uniform. I know
that </B>
<P><B>sounds strange, but I believed him. After all this man had a mind like
an </B>
<P><B>engineer. You know they don't believe in anything that they can't see
or </B>
<P><B>touch. He never would have even mentioned it if he wasn't convinced
that </B>
<P><B>he had a ghost.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway, to get on with my story of the house! Really nothing happened
at </B>
<P><B>first that was unnerving. I thought that maybe it really was a figment
of </B>
<P><B>his imagination. However, when he went to sea for the first time and
I </B>
<P><B>was alone in the house, I found out differently. First let me say that
I </B>
<P><B>never saw anything weird in the house. No ghosts floating down the
hall </B>
<P><B>or standing over me. There were however, several cold spots in the
house </B>
<P><B>that were so cold that it was like stepping into a freezer.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I would go to sleep at night and leave a brush or a teacup on the bedside
</B>
<P><B>table only to awake in the morning and find them gone. This drove me
nuts </B>
<P><B>because I knew that no one else was in the house with me. The only
time I </B>
<P><B>was really frightened was when the power would go off during a storm.
I </B>
<P><B>would get on the phone with anyone who would keep me company until
the </B>
<P><B>lights came on again. One night while I was on the phone with my </B>
<P><B>girlfriend's mother (my friend wasn't at home and I decided that her
</B>
<P><B>mother would do just fine keeping me company) I heard the ringing of
</B>
<P><B>small bells coming from the other room! My husband's parents had 2
small </B>
<P><B>poodles and when they came to visit had left the dog's toys behind.
The </B>
<P><B>toys consisted of a woman's stocking which had been knotted with a
small </B>
<P><B>bell attached to it. The dog's loved to play with these. I had just
</B>
<P><B>cleaned the family room that day and while dusting had seem the toys
</B>
<P><B>sitting on an end table. I know that I left them there. When the lights
</B>
<P><B>came back on, they were on the other side of the room on the floor.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The strangest thing happened one night when I had invited a friend
and </B>
<P><B>her boyfriend over for dinner. She and I had known each other for years
</B>
<P><B>and had never had problems communicating. It turned into one of the
most </B>
<P><B>strained evenings I have ever had to get through. She and I could hardly
</B>
<P><B>talk to each other. I kept wondering what I had done to tick her off.
Her </B>
<P><B>boyfriend was also very reserved which was not at all like him. I decided
</B>
<P><B>to muddle through the evening and hope that I could figure out what
the </B>
<P><B>problem was later. The next day, she called to "See if I was alright"!
</B>
<P><B>She said that while she was there that she felt something evil or at
the </B>
<P><B>least angry about the house. This was the first time she had been there.
</B>
<P><B>I guess I should say that the house was only about 10 years old at
the </B>
<P><B>time. Strange age for a haunted house. She had gone home that night
and </B>
<P><B>had a awful feeling that something bad was going to happen. She even
</B>
<P><B>called her boyfriend to see if he was alright. He was just about ready
to </B>
<P><B>call her to see if she was okay. She was so upset that she carried
a </B>
<P><B>weapon (knife) with her for about a week, not understanding what her
</B>
<P><B>premonition meant. She finally admitted to me that she would never
come </B>
<P><B>into that house again and that I shouldn't stay there when my husband
was </B>
<P><B>at sea. I thought she had lost her mind since I really had never felt
</B>
<P><B>threatened except when the power went out at night.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My husband came home from sea and we found out that I was expecting
our </B>
<P><B>first child. At first nothing really happened but then it started.
</B>
<P><B>Fortunately, my husband never told me the things that were going on
until </B>
<P><B>he convinced me to move to our own apartment. I kept thinking, why
should </B>
<P><B>we move from a 3 bedroom home with everything I could ever want and
move </B>
<P><B>to an apartment. His excuse finally was that his parents wanted to
sell </B>
<P><B>the house and we would have to move. Once we moved, he would never
let go </B>
<P><B>back in. I finally found out why!</B>
<P>
<P><B>When he was home from sea, he would get up very early in the morning
to </B>
<P><B>get ready to go to work at the Navy Base. I would stay in bed. He finally
</B>
<P><B>told me that when he would get up in the morning, that he would go
into </B>
<P><B>the kitchen to turn on the coffee. He looked into the dining room and
all </B>
<P><B>of the chairs which had been pushed up to the table would all be </B>
<P><B>rearranged all over the room. He of course would put them back where
they </B>
<P><B>belonged and not tell me. He also would find eggs broken in the sink,
</B>
<P><B>things that had been put up the night before were again out on the
</B>
<P><B>kitchen counter, also things were rearranged in the family room. The
</B>
<P><B>strange thing to him was that everything that was rearranged were things
</B>
<P><B>that I had owned when we got married. Nothing of his or his parents,
who </B>
<P><B>had graciously furnished the house, was moved! This worried him since
</B>
<P><B>none of this had started before I got pregnant! </B>
<P>
<P><B>After we moved, we would go back to check the house. Again, he would
not </B>
<P><B>let me go into the house! The house was on the market and the furniture
</B>
<P><B>had been left there until it sold. He would find everything in
disarray.</B>
<P><B>The realtor would call from time to time complaining that she couldn't
</B>
<P><B>get into the house. The key wouldn't work. She wanted to know if we
had </B>
<P><B>changed the locks.</B>
<P>
<P><B>To make a long story shorter than I might if I keep on rambling, we
did </B>
<P><B>some research on the house. Now, remember that the house was only about
</B>
<P><B>10 years old. What we found out was the original owner's wife had died
</B>
<P><B>from some sort of cancer that she had been battling for years. This
</B>
<P><B>cancer evidently prevented her from having children. We were told that
</B>
<P><B>she had wanted a large family. My husband thinks that when I became
</B>
<P><B>pregnant that this woman's ghost was jealous and somehow would have
</B>
<P><B>injured me or our son if we had stayed. I had my doubts since I had
never </B>
<P><B>really felt threatened while in the house, except when the lights went
</B>
<P><B>out! </B>
<P>
<P><B>I found out later that my husband had premonitions that came true!
He </B>
<P><B>told me one day that he was going to die young. He took out extra life
</B>
<P><B>insurance so that our son and I wouldn't have to worry about anything.
</B>
<P><B>Six months later he was dead from a freak accident at work that could
not </B>
<P><B>have been predicted. I still wonder if he was right about my being
in </B>
<P><B>danger because I was pregnant. Did she want our child or did she want
to </B>
<P><B>prevent the birth of our child? I will never know the answer to that
</B>
<P><B>question. I keep wanting to go back to the house and ask the present
</B>
<P><B>owners if they had experienced anything strange in the house. I have
</B>
<P><B>never had the nerve. </B>
<P>
<P><B>It has been 25 years since I lived there and sometimes I think that
it </B>
<P><B>was just an over active imagination and then I remember what really
took </B>
<P><B>place there. I haven't told all that happened because of limitations
on </B>
<P><B>time and of space, but I have given the basics. I hope never to live
in a </B>
<P><B>house where there is a vindictive spirit.</B>
