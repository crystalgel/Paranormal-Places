<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">My
ex and
I bought my house in 1974 from the original owners. The father was a
German <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">immigrant
who died in one of the bedrooms.That room became my husband's study but
since
the stereo and stuff was in there i would frequently enter. But enter
carefully.Everytime I had to go in that room I got a spooked feeling. I
would
run in on me tip-toes, grab what I needed and run back with an eerie
feeling. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">That
room
had a lighting fixture on the ceiling that was original (home built
1950) and
for 27<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">years
that
light bulb never burned out. While remodeling a few years ago i had to
take the
fixture <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">down
due
to faulty wiring and if it had been kept there believe<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that same bulb would be <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">burning.
The fixture in the kitchen has a bulb that is kept on 24/7 and has been
burning
at least 10 years (i never paid any attention to this until the other
one was
taken down). It is a two bulb <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">fixture
where one bulb burns one in a couple of weeks while the original bulb
still
glows.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I've
decided i live with the spirit of the previous owner who I call Herbert
He
loves to take my <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">car
keys.
One time i came home from work and put my keys in<span style="">&nbsp; </span>their
usual spot. However the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">next
morning they were gone. I spent almost 2 hours searching for those to
the point
I felt like <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">taking
the
wallpaper of the wall to see if they were there. Bye bye keys. About
two years
later I <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">was
setting up my Halloween decoration for the season (the front yard
becomes a
cemetery.) As I started digging a hole to put up the fence section I
hit
something metallic. There were the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">missing
keys. Another time , while changing clothes I heard my keys fall out of
my
pocket and hit the floor. Being lazy I figured I would get them later.
However
they were not there. The had to be in a space about 3" x 5" but they
were gone. About one year later I came home and those keys were sitting
in the
middle of my living room floor. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The
final
key adventure began when I went to get something off my computer desk
and
knocked <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">my
keys
off the desk. No biggie,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'll be leaving
soon and get them on the way out. Once again <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">there
was
no key. My desk is about 6" from my bed. I looked everywhere. I emptied
and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the
desk, moved and emptied the night stand, moved everything in a space
about4" x <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">6".
there was nothing there but hardwood floor.<span style="">&nbsp;

at

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>After my brother died in his home, my family
gave it to me to live in. It was an older mobile home. One day while on
my pc
which faced the same wall that my door was on, in fact, my desk was
next to the
door. My desk is huge, and a bigger desk top than most kitchen tables
are. So
sitting at my desk I could see part of the hallway while reading,
typing or
whatever on my pc. One day I just happened to look up at the door, and
there
came a figure of a man. I could only see his shadow on the emergency
door and
wall outside my bedroom. He was either bald or had very short hair. I
just sat
there and stared for what seemed like several minutes, waiting for him
to
either come into my room or say something. It finally turned and seemed
to go
into the bathroom which was on the other side of the wall, or went down
the
hall towards the kitchen and living room area, they are both open with
no wall
dividing them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was there alone except
for my dog chewie who is very large ( over 160 pounds ). I got up to
check it
out, because from what I saw as a shadow didn't look like anyone I
knew. I
walked by the bathroom peering in, and he <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">wasn't
there, so I kept going. When I got into the kitchen I saw Chewie on the
couch
looking out the window at the kids who had just gotten off of the
school bus
and were walking home. He would have barked even if he had known
whoever the
shadow was. He never made a sound. There was no one there, not even in
my sons
bedroom. I checked everywhere. If he had gone outside, I would have
heard the door
open and close. The only time my brother had short hair was when he was
in the
Marines, the only other person who ever had no hair or short hair was
my father
before he had died. The chemo and radiation treatments for cancer had
done
that. And both were dead for about 4 years, both dying about 4 months
apart. So
far this has been my only encounter with a shadow person or ghost. I
never
really knew they could or would show up like this.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This past year my daughter who works in a
nursing home was telling me they have seen shadow people there. They
seem to
only show up on this one hall section. I believe she said it was where
the
patience who weren't doing so well stayed. One patient even complained
about
being there on that hall. He said THEY kept bothering him and wouldn't
leave
him alone.When they moved him to another hall, he quit complaining. He
did
eventually die several months later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
did see this happen on Ghost Hunters too, where they saw a mans shadow
like figure
on a locker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have mentioned Shadow
People a few times on there too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Now
I
suppose your wondering if I were scared. For some odd reason, I wasn't
at all.
I just wish I knew who it was. I know dogs have a 6th sense too, and I
still
wonder why my dog didn't seem to know he was there. Chewie had never
met my
brother or my father. Even if he knew them, he would have barked at
being
excited someone came to visit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
have
long collected ghost stories from friends and find that nothing sparks
a dull
dinner party than spooky tales, no matter how slight they are.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately my story is slight. I was
terrified of my childhood home. My parents and I lived in a wooded part
of
Gary, Indiana, at night the darkness was complete.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyway I was playing by myself in my bedroom
one night, when just at my ear I heard a child&#8217;s voice babble something
in
toddler-speak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was over in an
instant, but it was unmistakabley outside of myself, a sound in my room.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I froze with terror and started screaming
bloody murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom ran in and calmed
me down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told me it was probably our
neighbors, a motorcycle gang of thugs, who were probably outside my
window
trying to scare me. I&#8217;m not sure why this was supposed to be less scary
than a
ghost, but I was comforted by the falsehood. I was so scared of the
dark as it
was!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Years went by before I experienced
anything else&#8230;but when I was prepubescent and stuck at home by myself I
had
some pretty typical ghost things happen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Small hand held games, Radioshack <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">versions
of arcade favorites like Gauntlet, would turn on by themselves. They
would just
go beep out of nowhere as they idled on the coffee table. I remember
the
buttons were pretty hard to push,too. In the end I thought it was the
crappy
manufacturing, but it sounds like a pretty typical ghost thing.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It didn&#8217;t scare me as much, and it only
happened on sunny afternoons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that&#8217;s
my haunting!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Centering around toys. I
read a woman&#8217;s story on this site, she thought her miscarried kids were
haunting her son, and it turned out my mom miscarried in our house when
I was a
kid, so maybe it was my kid ghost trying to play with me! Nothing too
malevolent, or ominous. At any rate I hope I&#8217;m too self-absorbed an
adult to
have a similar experience now!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m a
total scaredy cat!<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">at
all
being disturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cannot remember if
the dog followed me up there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
was
scared, but just went downstairs, again, and sat down and started to
write my <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">letter,
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Within about 15 minutes, the
whole thing was repeated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Another
time it was about midnight when the whole family was woke up by what <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">sounded
like a ceiling falling in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband
checked the bathroom on the main <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">floor
and
I checked the dining room...I then went up stairs to ask the kids if
they <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">heard
anything because it sounded to me that it came from up there.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Our oldest <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">son
said
that he heard the noise, too, but it sounded to him that it was from <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">downstairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
walked
down the front stairway to our bedroom and checked the other bedroom <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">next
to
ours and started toward our bed when I heard someone run up or down the
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">back
stairs from the upstairs to the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That really scared me and so I jumped <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">into
bed
and then heard something scratching on the wall or ceiling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Another
time I woke up in the middle of the night and it sounded like there was
a <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">party
going on in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No voices,
but lots of noises like things <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">being
thrown around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried to wake up my

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">finally
fell asleep and in the morning everything was normal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were a few <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">other
things, but too many to write about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
did find out that when we moved <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
was just
reading your entry on this location and remembered I had visited that
place
once (I&#8217;m 99% sure it&#8217;s the same cemetery).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was probably 5 or 6 summers ago.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I remember the visit fairly well as it was the night I became
open to
the possibility of ghosts or spirits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was around 2 or 3 n the morning when me and 3 friends walked through
the wooded
area around the cemetery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember
hearing sounds I couldn&#8217;t identify and random chills in the middle of
June.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And at one point seeing a shadow
near a tree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn&#8217;t investigate the
shadow to see if it was another person exploring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
took it as a cue to leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">That
was
my last supernatural experience until last December.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was at my fianc&eacute;s apartment in Skokie IL
while home on leave for Christmas and New Years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
woke up in the middle of the night and herd
movement in the apartment I looked out the bedroom door (it was open
about &frac14;
way) and saw a shadow of head and shoulders walk past.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I assumed it was her roommate until I
remembered he was out of town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I quietly
got out of bed thinking it was a robber.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I slipped into the hallway still hearing noise in the family
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I came around the corner the
family room
was empty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I checked the front and
backdoor both were still locked from the inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had heard from her, her current and past
roommates as well as from other friends of other occurrences in the
apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such as lights turning on and
off by themselves, cabinets opening and closing on their own, shadows
reflected
in the TV or seen for a split second in peripheral vision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My fianc&eacute; has also felt breezes in her room
when windows and doors are closed and her cat can be seen from time to
time
walking around looking u as if following someone when no one is there
to
follow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Hi,
let me
give you a little background. I have always been a big believer in the
paranomal and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">am
always
interested in hearing stories about other people's experiences. My
mother use
to see <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">her
parents (both passed away before I was born) in her dreams and
sometimes in her
room. She would tell me stories about her time in Vietnam (she was born
there,
came her in late 70's) and how haunted it was, which I believed turned
me into
a "fan" I suppose. Anyway, as much as I believe it, seek it, read
about it, research it, etc....I have never had an experience. And I
figured if
I ever did, I wouldn't let myself be afraid. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Well,
I
had an experience. About 2 years ago, my boyfriend's boss' father lives
in a
studio that <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">used
to be
a barn. Well, it's located in the older parts of the city we live in.
We were
asked to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">house
sit
one week. So I came over a few nights. Each night, I KNEW someone else
was
there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">There
was
no doubt in my soul and mind there was another person watching me those
few
nights <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
stayed
there. My boyfriend shrugged it off because I "think everything's
haunted." Besides, the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">boss'
father had two golden retrievers to protect me. Maybe. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">It
was the
third night I slept there. It was around 2 or 3 in the morning. I was
tossing
and turning <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">because
I
couldn't shake the fact someone was watching me. At this moment, I
layed there <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">awake,
casually looking at my boyfriend wondering how he could sleep so well.
I closed
my eyes <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">for
a
brief moment when someone touched my cheek. I opened my eyes and
brought my
hands <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">to
my face
because I thought it was a spider that landed on me. No, there wasn't
anything <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">crawling
on me. So I glanced at my boyfriend, thinking he was awake but he was
still
asleep. I <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">leaned
back and thought "You're paranoid" when suddenly I noticed a figure
standing next to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">me.
I am
still laying down so I look up and there is a shape of a head,
shoulders, and a
body. I <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">start
thinking "Hmm, maybe it's the boss' father wondering who I am....then
why
isn't he saying <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">anything?
Maybe it's the neighbor? No, I would hear the door open...OMG, it's a
break-in,
he's <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">going
to
try to rape me!" And at that thought, a car passes by and light streams
into the window <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">hitting
this man's face, which should have scared him away or revealed his
face.
Instead, the light <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">shined
on
a dark mass...with no face/features. I panicked. The figure started
bending
closer and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">closer
to
me. I kept looking at it and screaming at my boyfriend to wake up
because some
guy <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">was
in the
room trying to attack me. My boyfriend took FOREVER to wake up and when
he <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">did,
I
took one moment to look away at the figure to look at my boyfriend. My
boyfriend looked <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">at
me and
said "I don't see anything." I glanced back and it was gone. It took a
few hours before <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
could go
to sleep again, but that feeling of someone watching me NEVER went
away. I
didn't <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">go
back
into that room again. My boyfriend wanted to believe me. He's convinced
whatever it <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">was
didn't
intend harm on me and was just curious about me. He thinks if the dogs
didn't
react, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">then
it
couldn't have meant any harm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Well,
a
year later, we were asked to house sit again. I came over only twice.
My second
stay was <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">the
last
time my boyfriend and I stepped foot in that place. We built a fort in
the
living room and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">slept
with
the kitchen light on because I was still feeling, for the lack of a
better
word, freaked <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">out.
I
made sure one dog slept above my head, the other dog sleeping on my
left, and
my <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">boyfriend
on the right. Well, in the middle of the night (unsure what time it
was), one
of the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">dogs
started growling. I woke up immediately but stayed still. I looked
around the
room and did <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">not
see
anything that could upset the dogs. The dog laying next to me started
growling
even <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">louder.
The one at my head was on his feet, staring at the front door/hallway
area. I
turned to my <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">boyfriend
to wake him up but he was already awake. He looked at me and said
"We're
getting <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">the
%^&amp;* out of here now!" We both jumped up and turned on the lights.
We
started getting <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">things
together to leave. Both dogs are now sitting in the hallway staring at
the wall
by the front <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">door.
I
started taking pictures. Now, I know what people call "orbs" are
actually sometimes <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">pieces
of
dust...but what I saw in one pictures was NOT dust. I took five
pictures, one
right after <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">the
other,
of one of the dogs staring at the wall. Only in one picture did an
"orb" show up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Other
people have house sat since and none have had any experiences. Until
one day,
about 5 <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">months
after I last stayed there, another female stepped into the home and
decided
right then <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">and
there,
she couldn't go anything farther. She said she felt uncomfortable and
didn't
like the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">feeling
she was being "watched." She never heard of my stories, in fact, we
didn't know each <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">other
then, when she came to that place. I'm just glad someone else knew what
I was
talking <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">when
we
walked into the house and I immediately got a feeling of a presence <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">with
us.
My hair stood up on my arms and I really felt like somebody was in <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">the
room
with us. My daughter looked at me and asked if I felt that, I said <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">that
I did
and confirmed it when we both stopped talking and closed our eyes, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">you
could
really feel it. We got really spooked and I told my daughter that if <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">it
was
someone with us, it was indeed family and that they would not hurt us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">About
that
time, an overwhelming scent of Lilac perfume permiated the air. It <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">was
the
weirdest thing. My daughter smelled it as did I and we just looked at <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">each
other
in disbelief. It lasted for about a minute or so and then <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">dissiapated.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">At
this
point I was really freaked out. I called my aunt in Texas and told her <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">what
happened. She told me that was most definitely my great grandmother as <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">she
wore
that type of perfume and was indeed a real lady who had tea on the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">porch
every day at 2. It was about 2 when we entered the house. She also
said, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">it
would
make sense to her that she contacted me as I was the oldest female <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">heir
to
the family name! <span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
know now
that there are things that cannot be explained, but this has really <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">got
me
shaken up. It just makes me wonder what she was wanting to tell me. A <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">side
note
is that her son has recently mortgaged the family home to pay his <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">mother's
hospital bills and they could possibly loose the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Do
you
think she was maybe trying to contact me for this reason. Guess I will <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Years
ago I flew the nest and moved in with my fianc&eacute;, now husband. I
felt that I
left <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">behind
the
spirit of my dead uncle, who had died in a motorbike accident years
before I <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">was
born,
and so it was a hard day for all of us. 2 months later we got married
and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">went
through honeymoons et cetera, and we started to settled in to our
normal <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">routine.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>Early the next summer, just after the
anniversary of his death, we'd spent the day with <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">my
parents
and came home late in the evening, around 9:30pm. I went to the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">bathroom,
and took our dog with me because he'd been acting strangely all day and
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">didn't
want to be left alone even at my parents house. I started washing my
face and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">realised
that the door was moving, rocking slowly open and closed. I glanced
down and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">the
dog
was cowering against my legs, making a whimpering noise (this was
unusual to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">him
- he
very rarely made any form of noise). I heard the door slam and looked
around <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">to
find
the door shut tight, and this surprised me because the door was very
difficult
to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">slam
shut
due to the towels on the back of it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
was
terrified, and it took me nearly a minute to get the door open - it was
like it
was <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">wedged
shut. It did open, and I left the room with my dog and waited until my <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">husband
got in from the garden before retrying to wash my face. Nothing more <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">happened,
and we went to bed early because my husband had an early start the next
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">day.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">He
left
for work at 6am the next morning. He said goodbye to me and left, and I
slept <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">until
around 8:30pm when the dog woke me up. I got up and went downstairs to
make <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">some
tea,
and found that the loaf of bread we kept on top of the microwave was
spilled <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">all
across
the kitchen. There were 8 slices all scattered over the floor, and the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">packaging
that the rest of the loaf sat in was sealed up with a rubber band, just
as we <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">had
left
it the night before. My husband got his breakfast on the way to work
and so <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">didn't
go
in the kitchen at all that morning, so he couldn't have spilt the
bread, and my
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">dog
wouldn't scavenge for food (and couldn't have resealed the bag anyway).
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>Since then there hasn't been any activity
except the odd strange noise or unexplainable <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">feeling
that I get, except one day when we came home to find the back door

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
have
read a lot of the stories from the Website and have found them very
interesting, so i <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">thought
i
would share my experiences in the hope that other people find them
interesting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">When
i was
about 15 years old my Dad became the manager of Pub, i wont say the
exact Pub
as he does not run it any more. The Pub is located near Sheffield in
England
and is on a Country road. The pub is a converted from a farm house and
barn. To
get to the pub you come off the country road and follow a small track
only
about half a mile until you reach the car park.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>The first night we stayed there we all slept
in different rooms as the pub was also a small hotel <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">with
about
6 rooms spread over 2 floors. The first night i stayed in room number
3. When
we <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">started
to
go to bed, the family dog wanted to come into my room and it lay on the
carpet
and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">would
not
move even when my dad was shouting at it to leave, the dog did
eventually leave
to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">go
and
sleep in the corridor, but soon after my Dad closed his door i opened
mine
again to let the dog in. Now this dog is a Rottweiler with a head as
big a
boulder, but the poor thing could not get any closer to me and really
did not
want to be on its own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>I should mention that my parents divorced and
at the time i only saw my dad at the weekends. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">So
the
next time i went to stay there i stayed in room number 4. Just to set
the
scene, if you come out of room number four to the right is an emergency
exit
with a push bar to open the door which leads to the fire escape stairs
and to
the left leads to a staircase which leads to my Dad's room and a spare
room
that was not being used at the time for little more than storage. I was
not
comfortable at all in the room i did not want to turn the lights out
and tried
to keep watching TV as long as i could, eventually around 3am ish i
turned the
TV off but kept the lights on. My Dad had started leaving the Dog in
the pub
area downstairs and blocked the door leading up to the bedrooms i think
he
didn't want dog hair in the bedrooms as he wanted to start letting
guests <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">stay
in
the rooms. Anyway the dog was going crazy, barking non stop, i was far
too
scared to go <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">down
and
see what was up. I then started hearing the emergency exit bar on the
door
outside my room rattle as if someone was trying to open it but they
were not
pushing hard enough to open it. The next thing i heard footsteps really
loudly
running down the stairs from my Dads room and i saw shadows pass under
the door
of my room. I felt relieved i thought my Dad had come down to go and
see what
the dog was barking at. The next day i asked my Dad what the dog was
barking at
last night when he went down, and what he said sent shivers down my
spine. He
said he had no idea he never heard the dog and never went down stairs
at all
during the night. After some research i found out that a woman many
many years
ago had slipped on those stairs and fell down them breaking her neck
and she
died instantly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>Sorry if I'm rattling on i just want to share
my experiences of the Pub all in one go, feel free to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">stop
reading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>One time My Dads partner, her son and I came
home one night and the pub was in darkness <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">which
frequently happened, the lights would go out all by themselves, and my
Dad <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">who
previously was an Electrical Engineer and more than capable of
re-wiring a house
on his <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">own
could
not figure out why. Anyway we came home i cant remember why the pub was
closed <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">but
it was
and we just had a quick scan round to check no one had broken in (don't
forget
pub in <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">darkness,
no lights) and right at the back of the small restaurant area we could
see a
man sat at <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">one
of the
tables just staring at us, he was just solid black, other things
started to get
lighter like <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">the
flowers on the table and the chairs but this figure remained solid, we
panicked
and ran <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">upstairs
and stayed in one of the rooms till the lights came back on. It was not
a
burgualr, the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">next
morning we check everything was still there and all the doors locked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The
Kitchen area of the pub was a big room which was the old barn. And that
was the
worst <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">room
of
the house you could constantly feel someone watching you and walking
past <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">you.
Whoever was watching felt angry as if they were annoyed because you
were there.
No one <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">wanted
to
be in this room alone, my Dad had a few waitresses and bar staff leave
because
they <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">felt
uncomfortable working in there. Again after a bit of research we found
out that
the farmer <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">who
lived
in the farm hung himself in the barn, which is now the kitchen, and to
be
honest i don't <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">think
he
left. Objects would constantly go missing, spoons would turn up again
bent out
of shape and the whole kitchen was cold even when we had the cookers on
we
still had to wear jumpers in there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">My
step
brother and a family friend where staying in room number 7 the storage
room i <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">mentioned
earlier. During the night one of them (Neil) thought that the other

gotten up <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">and
was
leaning over him as if to check he was ok. And to make it a bit more

Jim had <o:p></o:p></span></p>

would

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">wasn't
good, so I would rather not know. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to
clear up any confusion my Nan was a good woman, very religious and a
loving
kind <o:p></o:p></span></p>

came

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">took
my

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">My
grandmother died along time ago. The last thing she said was don't let
the kids
forget me. 3 years later my brother, my dad, and I were alone because
my mom
was still at work. Our house is split so our neighbors live in the same
house
but next to us. So we were sitting down and we heard stomping on the
porch. So
my dad opens the door and no one's there. That happened about three
times. When
my mom got home she said she saw my grandmother sitting on the porch.
The next
night at like 2:00 in the morning my stereo goes on really loud to like
Leona
Lewis. I'm a girl so I like her music. So my dad goes in to turn it off
and it
was so cold by the radio, that he pulled his hand away and he had
Goosebumps
all up his arm. On my grandma's birthday, music started playing on my
mom's
computer. One day before school I heard voices and I said to my
brother, do you
hear that? he says yes and he's littler then me, like 7 and he assures
me it
was nothing. when we got home, we found out it was my dad's radio. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Christmas
music started playing on my mom's phone out of the blue one day. My
grandmother's favorite room was my room so at night I get a like weird
feeling
like all of a sudden I get Goosebumps on my arms. My cats move their
head
across the room like they are watching something. My mom just put this
bode
statue by our wood stove and I feel like it's watching me out of the
corner of
my eye right now. i told my friend about the stories and she slept over
to see
what i mean. the tv went on and off. then we decided to investigate. so
we went
into my mom's room and as soon as i got in there i felt weird. so my
friend
says if your here turn on the lights. nothing happens. so then her face
goes
white and she says did you here that? i was like what. and she said
there it is
again. and it sounded like something was over by the tv. we ran as
quick as we
could out of the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I've
been
looking for a site for a long time wherein I can outline an experience
that I
had back in the 80's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It remains
extremely vivid in my mind...as if it happened only hours ago.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Last year, while camping in Vermont, I
related the story to a couple who was camping next to us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were from Massachusetts and told me
about Freetown State Forest and what was going on there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She also told me that what I had described
was what was disturbing people there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She called it a Pukwudgie. (Guardians of the Forest.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Lets
go
back to the Story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am now 48 and I
live in Valley Forge, PA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
great-grandmother on my father's side was full-blood Lenni-Lanape.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was younger, I lived near Philadelphia
in a town called Flourtown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I used to
practically live in Fairmount Park, (Wissahickon Creek), within the
boundaries
of the city of Philadelphia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The park is
about 20 miles long and about 6 miles wide at the most.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You'd never know that you were in a major
city when you are in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a
steep valley and there used to be a ton of mills there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The park has a long, historical past and had
involvement in the Revolutionary War.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was also sacred land to the Delaware tribe of the Lenni-Lanape.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a Counsel Rock there, among other
things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
had been
there many, many times and there are many great places.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is "Devil's Pool" where the
Native American legends say the the Great Spirit defeated the Dark
Spirit and
an imprint was left on the rock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is the Ledge, which is a great fishing spot, secluded and out over the
water.
One of my favorite spots is called "Mom Rinker's Rock."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a finger of rock that sticks out from a
hillside deep in the park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is only
one way on or off and the drop on all sides may not be sheer, but they
are
steep and treacherous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the top of the
rock is an old statue of William Penn.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Engraved in the plinth is the word, "Toleration."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">One
night,
during the summer of my 26th year, 4 friends and I went to
"Toleration" before it got dark.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We sat on the rock until late, talking and enjoying the
peacefulness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of the guys with me, I
knew well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One, (named Stan), was always
seeing stuff and it was a joke of sorts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One, (named Andy), never believed anything unless he could touch
it. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Anyway, we were out there for a while
and Stan
came back from relieving himself and announced to me that there were
eyes in
the bushes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was talking to Andy and
was closest to the land side of the rock.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I laughed, but eventually I looked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sure enough, there were two human-sized points of
greenish-yellow
light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After about 10 seconds, they
blinked, twice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
asked
Andy if he saw him and he said, "yep."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About
15-20 seconds later, the owner of the
eyes stepped into the moonlight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'll
tell you, I never saw this before and never saw it again, (except in
dreams),
but have been trying to figure out what it was since that day.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">It/he
was
about 3.5 to 4 feet tall and he was squatting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, he walked in a squat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
moved that way until he was about 12-15 feet from me, then he stopped
and just
stared at us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could see the shadow he
was making on the ground, in the moonlight and he wasn't transparent,
(although
at times he seemed to shimmer.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
looked wet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His hair was long and
damp-looking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His face was human, but
his nose was long, almost over his upper lip.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I couldn't see any teeth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
eyes were greenish-yellow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
wearing a shirt that looked as though it was made of sticks and I think
he was
wearing a loincloth of sorts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(It may
have been his skin too.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His feet seemed
bare, but there weren't any discernible toes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His hands were human, but his fingers were very long also.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">One
hand
was held like a fist, with a stick in it that only protruded from the
bottom of
his hand and there were beads and feathers hanging from the end.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The other hand was empty and he kept opening
and closing it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He didn't make any sound
at all, not even on the dry ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
have no idea how long we were there like that, but I do know that he
was
looking at me, because my friends, (including Andy), not only commented
on it
later, but they were looking from him to me while we were in the
"standoff."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">After
a
while, he left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he didn't walk
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He moved to his left, (our
right.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The path that he chose was
directly off of the rock, but he didn't descend, he just moved through
the air
and we could see him passing through the trees until he was out of
sight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Needless
to say, none of us moved for a very long time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When we did, no-one wanted to lead or be in the back!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">We
eventually made it back to the car without incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Although, just before we got there, a shadow
moved across our path.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No-one was
frightened at all on the rock, only afterward.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We never went back there at night again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had dreams about it for years and did some research, but never
found
much.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went there, with a friend, on
the summer solistace this year with my camera.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had saved some soil from that night and brought it with me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing appeared, although there seemed to be
a "theme" that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everything
that we saw had red in it. Leaves, fungus, stray debris, and a passing
balloon
on the wind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We even saw a Scarlet
Tanager, (which is a very rare bird for our area.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
took
allot of pics and checked them all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
I got back and displayed them on the PC, one had orbs in it. Strange
during the
day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Mom
Rinker
was a tavern owner in Philadelphia during the British occupation in the
1770's<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She used to listen to the British
officers talk in the tavern, then she would pass the information, (in
balls of
yarn), down to Jacob Levering who was camped in the creek area.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>That is how the rock got its name.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>In later years, the rock was also the scene
of a report from a mill owner that stated, "Mom Rinker was a witch and
he
saw her there on the rock in the moonlight using it as the place where
she
would start her broomstick rides."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">This
could
very well be a typical report of what I saw, except from a man in the
18th
century.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, I've<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>shared my story with a few people over the
last 22 years, one of whom was in Vermont.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was staying at Jamaica State Park there, which had its own
reputation
with the native Americans and the massacre there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
told me that I had just described a
Pukwudgie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the first time that
anyone had the slightest recognition of this guy, much less a name.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I would like to know if anyone else has had a
similar experience and/or knows more about this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn't really want to start a discussion
thread unless the people on it were serious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I've attached some pics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I've
always been pretty much in tune with things since I was very young.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I've had more than a few experiences in
various places including Gettysburg, and some of the Revolutionary
sites around
here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But that is another story....<o:p></o:p></span></p>
