<P>
<P><B>Hello Dave ~ i have a story to tell you about my beautiful Starrbo
, a dog I </B>
<P><B>raised from a puppy. I also had her father, both of which were very
</B>
<P><B>intelligent animals and very in tune to people.Recently  I had to put
Starr </B>
<P><B>to sleep she had contracted diabetes and it was ravaging her entire
system </B>
<P><B>..she had gone blind but could still fine her way upstairs to my room
,,She </B>
<P><B>was 14 years old..She was a dear and loving animal but very protective
of me </B>
<P><B>...she was a huge white Samoyed. Well When the doctor gaveher tha shot
I  </B>
<P><B>held her until she was gone ..I can tell you this for absolute certainity

</B>
<P><B>..Dogs do have a soul and it is definately not entirely weightless.
This very </B>
<P><B>large animal became as light as a feather after she took her final
breath and </B>
<P><B>i could have sworn that I felt her leave. I know that I felt whatever
the </B>
<P><B>essence is leave . I hate to be longwinded but this is such an important

</B>
<P><B>thing to me I know of no other way to tell it. After i put her down
I had her </B>
<P><B>cremated and knowing how sad i would be left the next day for the island
of </B>
<P><B>Captiva..While there i had a strange dream that i had moved into a
basement </B>
<P><B>and iwas walking around looking at all the white walls and I approached
a </B>
<P><B>room that had a stove in it but it looked different than usual and
I remember </B>
<P><B>feeling the heat from it.I woke up sweating and thought it must have
been </B>
<P><B>having been in the sun all day. when i returned home it took me a day
to get </B>
<P><B>up the nerve to go to the Vet and claim Starrs Ashes ..I walked in
and asked </B>
<P><B>for them and they took them down and handed them to me .i had the strangest

</B>
<P><B>feeling a very warm feeling of being hugged by someone I loved , I
talked </B>
<P><B>with Dr. young briefly and glanced down at the date on the urn it was
wed and </B>
<P><B>I remembered i had had that dream on Wed. The Doctor and i talked as
i told </B>
<P><B>her about it i heard her breath in surprised ..she said that is exactly

what </B>
<P><B>the crematory looks like ...the crematory was in indiana I had never
been </B>
<P><B>there ..I live in ky.After i took her home on one ocassion and in broad

</B>
<P><B>daylight i was cleaning my room and i thought i saw her standing there
but in </B>
<P><B>my periferial vision ..not head on .It was just for an instant ..I
wished i </B>
<P><B>had not jumped and i could have seen her longer but it took me by

surprise.</B>
<P><B>Then some time passed and no more sign of her ..Then i began to be
awakened </B>
<P><B>every time i fell asleep by one unmistakeable bark loud and clearly
hers. I </B>
<P><B>would wake up and look around and the other dogs would be sleeping
..I have </B>
<P><B>two more her daughter and a terrier. well anyway One day the furnace
went out </B>
<P><B>and i had to call the furnace man to come ..What he found was a hole
in the </B>
<P><B>burner that was letting carbon monoxide into my house and thats why
I had </B>
<P><B>been falling asleep so much and having headaches...He told me that
it had </B>
<P><B>been an extremely dangerous thing and that i would probably have gone
to </B>
<P><B>sleep once too often and that would have been that. After having that

</B>
<P><B>fixed,No more barking ..I think Starrbo was still at her post guarding
me and </B>
<P><B>not allowing me to sleep too long or too soundly!!!About 6 months after

</B>
<P><B>that.I moved her urn into a secretary in another bed room to keep it
from </B>
<P><B>getting dusty ...You got it!! More Barking!!!! Moved it back to my
bedroom </B>
<P><B>..it is quiet once more...I don't see her on a regular basis but there
are </B>
<P><B>times when i feel her presence and times when Tasha wags he tail and
looks up </B>
<P><B>for no apparent reason ....and sometimes wheni think i catch a glimpse
of </B>
<P><B>that tail...very swift ..very illusive /..but my imagination ..?? I
don't </B>
<P><B>think so. As a post note i think love between people and animals transcends

</B>
<P><B>what a lot of us consider normal...Starr is scheduled to rest with
me someday </B>
<P><B>.....There is a lot of comfort in knowing that....</B>

<H3><A NAME=about><B>Story About my Weird House</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By:  scottbot@nls.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>My house was built in 1832 and was one of the first five houses built

in</B>
<P><B>the city of Cleveland, so you know that if there are such things as

ghosts</B>
<P><B>there are gonna be some in a house this old. The things I have seen

and</B>
<P><B>heard sent chills down my spine but there were never any realy scary</B>
<P><B>experiences. The most scary thing I have seen is probably the ghost
I seen</B>
<P><B>when I was about six or seven. I was laying awake in bed under my

covers</B>
<P><B>when I heard a strange sound ,like somebody lightly knocking on my</B>
<P><B>dresser. I peeked my head from under the covers and seen the shape
of a man</B>
<P><B>about a foot tall and swinging away at the top of my dresser with a</B>
<P><B>hammer. The figure was all white and had no defining features. The

hammer,in</B>
<P><B>proportion to his body , was about the size of a big sledge hammer
to a</B>
<P><B>normal person. I was afraid to run downstairs because of the way the

stair</B>
<P><B>case twist I feared that he would chase me and jump on me if I tried

to</B>
<P><B>run.(hey ,I was a little kid ,what do you expect.)I was also afraid
to yell</B>
<P><B>because he had not looked at me and I didn't want to draw his attention.

So</B>
<P><B>I crawled under my covers and fell asleep soon after. But that is not

the</B>
<P><B>only story in my house.</B>
<P><B>If I was home alone upstairs I would hear people talking downstairs

,but</B>
<P><B>couldn't make out what they were saying , also the same if I was

downstairs</B>
<P><B>,I would hear talking upstairs.My mother has also seen things in this

house</B>
<P><B>too.She told me about one time she seen the shadow of a woman walk
past her</B>
<P><B>room in the night ,her bed was at an angle that she couldn't see out
of the</B>
<P><B>doorway ,but could see the shadow cast into her room of anyone walking

in</B>
<P><B>the hall. She was the only female in the house ,so that's kinda creepy.

She</B>
<P><B>also told me that one time she was in the kitchen and seen a little
boy run</B>
<P><B>past her ,all she seen was the back of his head as he ran past so she</B>
<P><B>thought it was me ,but when she followed to tell me something she didn't

see</B>
<P><B>anyone. The hallway the boy ran into leads to the bathroom and no

where</B>
<P><B>else. Also ,I had been in the yard playing at the time. That's about

it</B>
<P><B>except for weird noises that could just be the house settling ,but
we</B>
<P><B>haven't seen anything in years ,and we have been remodeling , I hear

that</B>
<P><B>has an effect on ghost sightings.</B>
<P><B>Several months ago I had been sitting at home wathing t.v. when I heard

a</B>
<P><B>car pull up in the drive. I looked and seen an elderly woman sitting

behind</B>
<P><B>the wheel just sitting there.I went out to see what she wanted and

this</B>
<P><B>lady that looked to be about 70 years old or so told me she had grown
up in</B>
<P><B>my house and wanted to see what it looked like now. I didn't want to

invite</B>
<P><B>her in the house because a lot had changed and the house was a mess

from</B>
<P><B>having walls replaced and I thought she would be better off with her</B>
<P><B>memories ,though if she had asked to come in I would have happily let</B>
<P><B>her. We talked a little ,but she only stayed a short while and never

left</B>
<P><B>her car. I was realy kicking myself after that for not finding out

more</B>
<P><B>about the house when I had a chance.The only thing I found out was
that the</B>
<P><B>yard had been a lot bigger ,and there had once been a barn.I really
hope she</B>
<P><B>gets the impulse to come again.</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Hi, mysterious happenings have occurred all my life, starting when
I was just</B>
<P><B>three years old.  My parents rented this real big house and the neighbor

next</B>
<P><B>door to us told my mother to remind her to tell her something when
she moved.</B>
<P><B>My father worked nights then and my mom would here strange noises coming

from</B>
<P><B>the big staircase leading to our bedrooms.  She found this cute little

wooden</B>
<P><B>piece with wheels on it and said that she could use it for when she

scrubbed</B>
<P><B>the floors by kneeling on it, it came in quite handy.(the house was
a funeral</B>
<P><B>parlor before we moved in.) It turned out to be the thing they used
to wheel</B>
<P><B>out the coffins! </B>
<P><B>           One time we had company over and us kids were playing down

the</B>
<P><B>cellar and I was sitting on this long table that was against the wall

when</B>
<P><B>suddenly something tapped me on my right shoulder.  I was startled

and</B>
<P><B>frightened because the wall was in back of me.  I ran up crying to
my mother</B>
<P><B>telling her what happened   and she said it was just my imagination
...I was</B>
<P><B>only three years old at the time. That was my first encounter with

the</B>
<P><B>ghosts........</B>
<P><B>            My father had to quit his night job and we eventually had
to move</B>
<P><B>because my mom didn't want to be in that house anymore.  The woman
told my</B>
<P><B>mother that it was a funeral home. Since my incounter I have a fear

about</B>
<P><B>cellars especially at night when its dark.</B>
<P><B>            The next encounter was when I was twelve years old.....It
was New</B>
<P><B>Years Eve and I </B>
<P><B>was up in my bedroom by myself because I was punished for not cleaning
my room</B>
<P><B>that past week.  There was losts of company downstairs Aunts and Uncles

cousins</B>
<P><B>laughing and  my brother and sisters were all having fun. I was crying

and</B>
<P><B>sobbing in my room continously  crying and crying feeling sorry for

myself</B>
<P><B>that I wasn't down having fun on such a special night.  All of a sudden
as God</B>
<P><B>is my wittness I got slapped right across my face, I froze and did
not dare</B>
<P><B>move from such fright....Not a sound was in my room and I was afraid
to get</B>
<P><B>up. My body felt like a ton of cement and I couldn't even move, the
door only</B>
<P><B>maybe two feet above my head.  I finally got the courage to jump out
of my bed</B>
<P><B>and turn the door knob screaming to my mother that something had slapped
me in</B>
<P><B>the face. Naturally she didn't believe me and thought I was just telling

this</B>
<P><B>story so that I could join the fun, they still to this day do not believe

this</B>
<P><B>story.  Yes there are ghosts I know for a fact because I felt the slap
that was</B>
<P><B>so hard that it put me into a shock of hysteria fright. Many strange

things</B>
<P><B>occurred at that house  (Medford, Ma) One night when I was going</B>
<P><B>to bed I found my sister   standing in front of our radiator in our

bedroom</B>
<P><B>that we shared. The room was dark and  when I snapped on the light

switch</B>
<P><B>she turn from facing the radiator staring at nothing and walk slowly
to her</B>
<P><B>bed got on it and turn and closed her eyes. I ran downstairs, screaming
to my</B>
<P><B>parents and told them what had happened they ran upstairs and found
my sister</B>
<P><B>comfortably fast alseep. That scared  the hell out of me, she doesn't

even</B>
<P><B>remember sleep walking, she was not known  for sleep walking.  </B>
<P><B>  Another time after my brother got married, my sister moved her stuff

into</B>
<P><B>his bedroom and</B>
<P><B>I had my own room.  One night she was sleeping and saw a black figure

standing</B>
<P><B>at the end of her bed, she came out screaming "I just saw death at
the end of</B>
<P><B>my bed" she not believing in any supernatural things , was totally

petrifived</B>
<P><B>and doesn't remember that ever happening to her.     Another time was
a sad</B>
<P><B>time, my uncle died instantly in a car crash on New Year's Eve. My
mother and</B>
<P><B>her brother were very close, he use to live at our home because he
had    been</B>
<P><B>away for a while and needed a place to stay and he lived with us until

he</B>
<P><B>married. One day</B>
<P><B>after several months after his death, she was crying cleaning her bedroom

and</B>
<P><B>thought out loud to herself, "Frankie, give me a sign that you are
all right"</B>
<P><B>all of a sudden in my fathers'      </B>
<P><B>bureau drawer a sound of a small motor started up, in the drawer was
a battery</B>
<P><B>operated shoe cleaner, my mother was not even near the dresser when

this</B>
<P><B>occurred. That house was a </B>
<P><B>house filled with demons, not ghosts, the man that owned that house

died</B>
<P><B>there, he was brought around by wheel chair for years and was very

unhappy.</B>
<P><B>The years went by and I     grew up and got married and lost my husband

of</B>
<P><B>only five years, he drowned at Manaouth MA, he fell overboard on our

small</B>
<P><B>motor boat, he was with one of his buddies and his buddy  didn't see
he fall</B>
<P><B>over, just heard the big splash.  The reason for this telling is because

where</B>
<P><B>his body never came up, the government would not give me any help for
my son,</B>
<P><B>so after waiting 12 years they finally settled a lump some of money
which I</B>
<P><B>had to give a  </B>
<P><B>third to my lawyer, who tried for years for me, to collect insurance
money and</B>
<P><B>social security</B>
<P><B>funds. When I received my money I bought a house which I still am living
in I</B>
<P><B>been here 20 yrs.  Its a nice big Victorian house. It has four and
half big</B>
<P><B>rooms on the first floor; which is for a young couple (my son and his
wife and</B>
<P><B>three children reside there now) and upstairs is two floors the first

consist</B>
<P><B>of a big reception hall which is part of the up coming story, and

four</B>
<P><B>bedrooms and a bathroom.  after being married to my third husband who

died</B>
<P><B>tragically of cancer I was left with two small girls to raise they
were 7 and</B>
<P><B>8 years of age at the time.  </B>
<P><B>Getting back to the buying of the house, I moved in and was so excited

to</B>
<P><B>finally have a home for me and the boys who were just 8, 10 and 14
. That</B>
<P><B>night after my family left from helping all day my friend decided she

would</B>
<P><B>sleep over so she could finish helping me with the house.  She slept
in my</B>
<P><B>room and that morning she came down and we all sat and had breakfast.

 That</B>
<P><B>night I went to bed and was just lying there , thinking of how tired
I  was</B>
<P><B>from all the moving, I must have just dosed off and woke up to a man

form</B>
<P><B>leaning over my bed, he had a rope over his shoulder and I was

startled..... I</B>
<P><B>told my friend (Paula) about my encounter and she was all upset, she
said she</B>
<P><B>had seen something in my bedroom the night before and thought she had

been</B>
<P><B>dreaming, we were shocked and scared out of our wits to think that
a spirit</B>
<P><B>was in this house.   After that, strange things started to happened;
not all</B>
<P><B>the time but just certain times.  </B>
<P><B>    My sons were in the bedroom they shared together, my son Chris

the</B>
<P><B>youngest, was listening to the radio, when it decided to turn to all

differnt</B>
<P><B>stations. He ran down screaming, "my radio changed It's own stations".

 The</B>
<P><B>years went by everyone got older;  my oldest son is married now and

lives</B>
<P><B>downstairs, my second son bought his own house and my youngest son
lives in</B>
<P><B>his basement.</B>
<P><B>	 Downstairs my son has had many encounters by waking up from his sleep

seeing</B>
<P><B>black figures standing in his bedroom.  The latest one started about
two years</B>
<P><B>ago when he had a few      friends over, they where in the living room

when</B>
<P><B>suddenely they heard something in the kitchen</B>
<P><B>which is two rooms away from the room they where in. My son  started
to go out</B>
<P><B>to the kitchen  area calling my son Donald's name , figuring he was
trying to</B>
<P><B>play a joke on them , when suddenely a black figure crouched down

scattered</B>
<P><B>across the kitchen opening from the dining area  and  ran in saying
ok donald</B>
<P><B>where are  you? My son was never downstairs in his apartment.   My
son was</B>
<P><B>scared out of his wits along with his friends and they  had to sleep
over that</B>
<P><B>night.         </B>
<P><B>	     MY grandson was watching some old family videos and my late

second</B>
<P><B>husband was in one of them and my grandson  said to my son , daddy
I saw that</B>
<P><B>man in my room, who is he?</B>
<P><B>My son said "what do you mean you saw him."  He was standing in my
bedroom, (</B>
<P><B>the male figure was my dead husband.  </B>
<P><B>		My next ecounter was the eve of my first husbands' death , I was
lying on my</B>
<P><B>sofa watching some television, my daghters were upstairs in their rooms,

it</B>
<P><B>was quiet and I looked at the french door to the tv room and could
see the</B>
<P><B>reflection of the foyer . I saw a figure walking by into my parlor

and</B>
<P><B>thought which daughter was downstairs. I asked "whos that"? waited
and asked</B>
<P><B>again got up and went to the kitchen no persons, dining room,parlor
I was kind</B>
<P><B>of nervous by this time I went into the foyer and called up to my

daughters,</B>
<P><B>who was just down here, they said no one , why do you ask.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  Judy_and_Cass@email.msn.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>First off just let me say that I usually don't tell this story to

many</B>
<P><B>people as they may think I am a bit odder than I appear.  I am going

to</B>
<P><B>shorten this story to just a few of my (and my friends, families)</B>
<P><B>experiences because I would be here all day and be taking up quite
a bit of</B>
<P><B>room because alot has happened over a several year time</B>
<P><B>period......Well....here goes.  I moved out of my mother and father's

home</B>
<P><B>the day I graduated from high school and moved in with my grandmother
whom I</B>
<P><B>adored.  She was still working at the time on the 3 to 11pm shift so
I was</B>
<P><B>home alone alot of the time.  The first thing that ever happened was

one</B>
<P><B>night I came home from work and went into one of the living rooms to
turn on</B>
<P><B>the tv and saw the newspaper laying on one of the couches spread open</B>
<P><B>completely and carefully.  I thought nothing of this of course and

went</B>
<P><B>about my business.  In the following months things got quite a bit

stranger</B>
<P><B>though.  I started hearing noise from upstairs which seemed to be

coming</B>
<P><B>from a specific room, the bedroom right at the top of the stairs which
I had</B>
<P><B>to pass to get to my bedroom.  This graduated to hearing people talking

at</B>
<P><B>night through the registers in my room.  It sounded like the tv was
on.  I</B>
<P><B>could definately hear voices of different people talking.  I found
out I</B>
<P><B>wasn't crazy one night when a friend of mine slept over and woke me
up in</B>
<P><B>the middle of the night asking who was talking in here.  I have seen

lights</B>
<P><B>turn on and off that were right next to me, heard doors opening and

closing,</B>
<P><B>voices as well but I couldnt make out what they were saying.  In fact
I rang</B>
<P><B>my mother one night (my mother and I didnt get on very well at the
time) and</B>
<P><B>pleaded with her to come over just until my grandmother got home because

I</B>
<P><B>was hearing things.  She wouldn't at first but finally conceded.  When

she</B>
<P><B>got there I was in the kitchen sitting there with a look on my face.

 She</B>
<P><B>came in and looked at me like I had lost my mind.  Maybe 5 minutes

later</B>
<P><B>guess what....she heard it too!!.  A deep voice from right above our

heads.</B>
<P><B>I guess my mother believed me at that point because she looked into
it and</B>
<P><B>had a psychic come in after I woke up one morning to find my

grandfather's</B>
<P><B>(who died a couple months before I was born) Elk's ring on my dresser
and a</B>
<P><B>white tailored man's shirt on the floor of my bedroom.  Funny thing
was that</B>
<P><B>sometimes when things would happen I would be afraid and sometimes
I</B>
<P><B>wouldn't.  At one point my cousin, a friend of mine and myself decided

to</B>
<P><B>use the Ouija board up in my room one evening.  I won't do that again!!

 I</B>
<P><B>never really believed those things worked until that night.  I threw
it away</B>
<P><B>after that.  That graduated to hearing people walk down the stairs
and into</B>
<P><B>one of the rooms and then back upstairs again.  I wasn't the only one

to</B>
<P><B>hear it either.  Everyone who came to the house with me heard it. 
The only</B>
<P><B>one who wouldnt confess to hearing or seeing anything was my

grandmother.</B>
<P><B>The most frightening experience ( this one still gives me goosebumps)</B>
<P><B>happened one day when a very good friend of mine was over.  We were
in my</B>
<P><B>room listening to music and I had just purchased a new poster for my

wall.</B>
<P><B>I grabbed a chair and stood on it to put it up and leaned up against
it to</B>
<P><B>hold it tight against the wall.  I asked my  friend for a tack and
all of a</B>
<P><B>sudden realized I couldn't move!!!  I was sort of calm at first, but

soon</B>
<P><B>went into panic.  My friend I think thought I was joking and pulled

the</B>
<P><B>chair out from underneath me.  Bad news was.....I was still stuck.
 There I</B>
<P><B>was suspended in mid air up against the wall.  She panicked and

starting</B>
<P><B>pulling on my legs until I was finally released.  I could go on and
on.  The</B>
<P><B>stereo used to turn on, lights turned on and off, things would rattle

on</B>
<P><B>shelves ...just certain objects,  not everything on the

shelf.....footsteps,</B>
<P><B>voices, doors opening and closing.  Most of the activity ceased when
I moved</B>
<P><B>out, but it's still there.  My girlfiend and I were there not too long

ago</B>
<P><B>and no one was home.  We were in the kitchen making lunch and we could

hear</B>
<P><B>music and footsteps upstairs.  My girlfriend wasn't accustomed to

this</B>
<P><B>activity and just kind of looked at me strangely.   I told her to ignore

it,</B>
<P><B>it used to happen all the time.  It went on for some time and finally

we</B>
<P><B>went upstairs to check things out just in case someone was up there

who</B>
<P><B>shouldnt be.  No one was of course.  We came down the stairs and stood

at</B>
<P><B>the bottom for a moment then I yelled up for whoever was doing it to

knock</B>
<P><B>it off and something GROWLED at us!!!! .....anyway, I could go on and
on as</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>In 1977, my parents decided to sell our house and build a home in the</B>
<P><B>country about 15 miles away from town.  We sold our house quickly,

and</B>
<P><B>had to move into a rent home.  The house is not spooky at all, until

you</B>
<P><B>go inside.  I was only 11 at the time, but it is still very vivid in

my</B>
<P><B>memory.  </B>
<P><B>Everything began about 2 months after we moved in.  Our neighboors

kids,</B>
<P><B>my friends, would not go into our back yard at night.  It was a large</B>
<P><B>yard, and many kids took it as a short cut to get to the store across</B>
<P><B>the street.  They told us that a very sinister  Negro man had stopped</B>
<P><B>them one night-he just popped up behind them as they crossed the yard</B>
<P><B>goig home-and told them to stay out of his yard.  They got scared and</B>
<P><B>ran home to tell their dad.  Living in their house for over ten

years,</B>
<P><B>he did not know who this Negro man was-the rent house had been vacant</B>
<P><B>for a while. And he did not know of any Negro families ever living
in</B>
<P><B>the house.   They never went into our yard at night.  Ever.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was awakened by footsteps one night.  I heard deep moaning sounds,</B>
<P><B>more like frustrated humphs more than anything.  I woke my brother

Ryan</B>
<P><B>up and he heard them to. That was very scary.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My sister Julie Anne, who was around nine, woke up one night and went</B>
<P><B>into the living room to check on our Beagle puppy.  There, in front

of</B>
<P><B>the window a/c, were small children jumping up and down.  There was

no</B>
<P><B>sound, just the apparitions.  It scared the hell out of my sister,

who</B>
<P><B>woke up my mom and dad.  They dismissed it of course, but I believe</B>
<P><B>her.  Both she and my other brother Regan experienced something in

that</B>
<P><B>house one night (sperate times respectively) that neither will talk</B>
<P><B>about.  My brother is a professional, very accomplished in the law</B>
<P><B>field.  And he is profoundly honest.  He will get to the point of</B>
<P><B>getting snappy if you even bring up that house.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>We moved around 9 months later, when our home was finished.  Nothing</B>
<P><B>followed, and that house still stands.  Why, I don't know.  It has

not</B>
<P><B>been lived in since 1983.  I wonder what happened to them...Located

on</B>
<P><B>Main street in Robstown Tx.  </B>

</H3><P><B>By:  anikac@email.msn.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I had read your section on apparitions of living people, and was reminded

of</B>
<P><B>an incident that happened when I was about six.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was little, I was extremely close to my father, and had never

been</B>
<P><B>parted from him for any longer than a day; when I was six, he traveled

to</B>
<P><B>Beijing to visit his family for a week. I missed him horribly, of

course,</B>
<P><B>and one afternoon in our house, probably the third day into his trip,

he</B>
<P><B>came into the kitchen just as he would always do, dressed just as

usual,</B>
<P><B>acting very normally. He was there just long enough for me to see him,
and I</B>
<P><B>think I hugged him and was so happy that he had come back. Afterwards,

he</B>
<P><B>left the kitchen, and then was nowhere to be found, but called from

Beijing</B>
<P><B>that evening, and mentioned nothing of the sort--obviously, if he was

in</B>
<P><B>Beijing, then he wouldn't also be in our house in Illinois! My mother

never</B>
<P><B>mentioned seeing him, and I never said anything to her about it. I

believe</B>
<P><B>that some part of him could feel how much I missed him and returned
to see</B>
<P><B>me and make me feel better for a little while, because that is the
way that</B>
<P><B>my father was.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In China we speak of the dead "begging dreams" to the living, which
is to</B>
<P><B>say that they appear in dreams to the living to tell them something.

My</B>
<P><B>father died two years ago, and I promptly threw away all the plans
I had</B>
<P><B>made before he died, moved out to California, and sank into

depression,</B>
<P><B>drinking, drugs, and general self-destructiveness. A few months

afterwards,</B>
<P><B>at the nadir of my depression, my aunt, with whom I am also very

close,</B>
<P><B>called me to tell me that ever since I had moved, she had been dreaming

of</B>
<P><B>my father, who never said anything to her in the dreams but merely
looked at</B>
<P><B>her with a sorrowful and reproachful expression. She asked me if there

was</B>
<P><B>anything the matter, and I had to tell her what I had never voiced

before,</B>
<P><B>how low I felt and how disconnected I was from any kind of living or

joy.</B>
<P><B>Since then she has made a point of keeping in close contact with me,</B>
<P><B>offering me her support, encouragement, a shoulder to lean on and someone

to</B>
<P><B>scream at when I had to, and with her kindness and love I am now

emotionally</B>
<P><B>and physically fine. Was it the bond between my aunt and I or my

father's</B>
<P><B>concern from the afterlife that prompted her to call me? We won't know,

but</B>
<P><B>I know my father and I know ths at that is a way in which he would

have</B>
<P><B>behaved if he knew I was in trouble and couldn't help me himself.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Not all ghosts are malevolent. Sometimes, I believe, they are the love

of</B>
<P><B>another, love strong eough to overpower corporeal boundaries. If I
ever feel</B>
<P><B>my father's presence, it will be as it was when I was 6, and I will

merely</B>
<P><B>be happy for the chance to see him again, just for a while, without

asking</B>
<P><B>any question, simply taking with gratitude this gift of his love.</B>

<P><B> </B>
<P><B>When I was about 7 years old, my grandfather and grandmother were moving

to</B>
<P><B>Florida for his retirement.  They had been gone for about 3 days and</B>
<P><B>everynight we would hear from them and where they were--that kind of

thing.</B>
<P><B>One night after all of us were sound asleep, we were all woke up with
a phone</B>
<P><B>call.  It was around 3 oclock in the morning, and it was the kind of
news no</B>
<P><B>one ever wants to here.  They were about 8 miles from their destination

in</B>
<P><B>Florida,  when they were struck by a truck,  and grandpa was killed

instantly.</B>
<P><B>Grandma survived having to have her hip replaced.  </B>
<P><B>  About one week later,  my mother, my younger sister and I,  were
at a local</B>
<P><B>gas station that we went to all the time.  I was in the back seat,
 and my</B>
<P><B>sister was upfront with my mother.  As the man came out of the gas</B>
<P><B>station--this was the days when all gas stations was full service--I

yelled</B>
<P><B>out, "Mom, that is grandpa."  Of course,  mom went on to say..."We
have gone</B>
<P><B>over this,  grandpa is up in heaven now"....So the man came over towards

the</B>
<P><B>car taking the gas amount my mother wanted in the car,  and he started
to pump</B>
<P><B>and then came to my side of the car.  It was summer--so all the windows

were</B>
<P><B>down,  and the man proceeded to tell me about how much he will miss

his</B>
<P><B>favorite granddaughter and to never worry about him because he will
always be</B>
<P><B>with her.  He also said with a smile how much he loves his family and

the</B>
<P><B>grandma will be fine.  The whole time this was happening, mom and my

sister</B>
<P><B>just sat in the front talking to each another.  He then took the money
from my</B>
<P><B>mom and left,  but,  first he turned and smiled at me.  I know this

sounds</B>
<P><B>alittle strange, but the man looked exactly like grandpa and even smelled

like</B>
<P><B>him.  Mom says that he was only saying good-bye to me because he did</B>
<P><B>practically raise me as a child while her and dad worked and before
my sister</B>
<P><B>came along.   I truly believe too...that he said good-bye and felt
he was</B>
<P><B>taken from us too soon.  I miss him alot.  Although this happened about

20</B>
<P><B>years ago, all I have to do is think of that warm summers day and his

last</B>
<P><B>smile to me and all sorrow goes away.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  primerafinan@earthlink.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>Any encounter with a spirit entity can be one of the most frightening</B>
<P><B>experiences imaginable, especially for a child. Unless the spirit

entity</B>
<P><B>is their to assist you or your loved ones in some way such as a

former</B>
<P><B>family member, the experiences can become annoying or downright</B>
<P><B>dangerous . My encounters with what I consider to have been a very

mean</B>
<P><B>and nasty spirit began around 1970 in the state of New Jersey. We

lived</B>
<P><B>in a nice</B>
<P><B>two story home that my parents had recently purchased. It all seem
to</B>
<P><B>start when certain pieces of furniture</B>
<P><B>had been moved in the attic by me. I was then a child of 8 years of

age</B>
<P><B>and as innocent as they come growing up in a traditional home with</B>
<P><B>parents that still espoused victorian values. The entity which we

later</B>
<P><B>discovered</B>
<P><B>was a young man who had committed suicide made his first appearance
in a</B>
<P><B>hallway area adjacent to my bedroom. All I saw was a silhouette of

what</B>
<P><B>seemed like a man wearing a long coat and a hat. I thought it was

some</B>
<P><B>sort of odd refection from some light that came through the kitchen</B>
<P><B>window, that is until the shadow moved and shifted and then I freaked</B>
<P><B>out.  My parents were awakened and they searched the house hi and low</B>
<P><B>but no sign of an intruder. Things started to escalate very quickly</B>
<P><B>thereafter. In the following months I constantly felt a sense of fear</B>
<P><B>dread that something or someone was watching me and the hair on my

back</B>
<P><B>would stand up each and every time. Then I started seeing family

members</B>
<P><B>in places within the house when they were somewhere else or in

another</B>
<P><B>part of the home. Every time as I approached this apparition it

seemed</B>
<P><B>to just break up like a fog and disappear. At times I did feel that</B>
<P><B>something was pulling on my bed sheet and at times felt hands coming</B>
<P><B>through the bottom of the bed and touching my body, it was too weird

to</B>
<P><B>even talk about a thought I was really losing my mind. I was always

an</B>
<P><B>outgoing child making friends easy and getting good marks in school,

why</B>
<P><B>is this happening to me? Did I do something to deserve this? An 8

year</B>
<P><B>old child? The situation escalated after some 8 months until I felt

such</B>
<P><B>extreme terror that I made an attempt to take me on life. I really</B>
<P><B>wanted to die the fear and agony that I went through was beyond

words,</B>
<P><B>I truly do not wish it on anyone. I later feel into a deep depression</B>
<P><B>and slowly thereafter became very ill and had to be hospitalized.

This</B>
<P><B>was a medical hospital not psychiatric. I had lost my eyesight and</B>
<P><B>conscienceness, I was rushed to the hospital by ambulance where I was

on</B>
<P><B>a strict liquid diet for weeks, I had to be escorted to the bathroom</B>
<P><B>because I was to weak to stand up, lost control of my bowels and

slept</B>
<P><B>almost all the time. This is all happening to an 8 year old child

that</B>
<P><B>NEVER had any medical conditions of any kind previous to this period.

I</B>
<P><B>was eventually released from the general hospital and began to regain

my</B>
<P><B>strength.over a period of  weeks. We eventually moved out and sold

the</B>
<P><B>home. That was more than 23 years ago. I have since then graduated

from</B>
<P><B>the University with a 3.75 GPA a four your tour in the USAF and have

my</B>
<P><B>own business as well as being married to a beautiful woman. It seems

I</B>
<P><B>came out of it OK but the fear and questions linger. If you encounter</B>
<P><B>any entities DO NOT FEAR THEM they draw energy from your fear. Tell

the</B>
<P><B>entity to leave and say it FORCEFULLY. If it still persist you should</B>
<P><B>recite some biblical passages and rebuke the entity. Frankincense and</B>
<P><B>Myrrh are great to burn as in incense that has holy properties. If

you</B>
<P><B>doubt this, don't.</B>
<P><B>Its wasn't because the wise men thought that a little frankenscence

and</B>
<P><B>myrrh might be nice that they traveled hundreds of miles to bring it

to</B>
<P><B>the manger. No, they were told to by the almighty himself for very

REAL</B>
<P><B>and PURPOSEFUL reasons. It wasn't for fragrance, its much more

profound</B>
<P><B>and esoteric than that. Any way I hope this may help anyone out there</B>
<P><B>but, the Number one weapon is LOVE. Fill your heart with as much of

it</B>
<P><B>as you can in an unselfish way. Its the strongest of all and a

natural</B>
<P><B>repellent to anything evil.</B>

for</B>
<P><B>6 years, when the worker controling the big concrete pump boom lost</B>
<P><B>control. The concrete pump had crushed my uncle, and he died right

then.</B>
<P><B>2 weeks later, I was in this little room that my Aunt Joanne (Larry's</B>
<P><B>wife) had called my Playroom. I loved that room. I played sega

genesis,</B>
<P><B>watched TV, and played with my dolls. One day, I was watching videos</B>
<P><B>when, on the edge of my bed, in broad daylight, I saw my uncle Larry.

He</B>
<P><B>had his working clothes on, and was talking to me. He said "Jillian,

I</B>
<P><B>have come to say goodbye. You are my most darling niece and I will
be in</B>
<P><B>your heart watching over you". With this, I ran downstairs and told

my</B>
<P><B>mom that I saw a man with a beard in my room. She told me not to

worry,</B>
<P><B>for my uncle had come to say goodbye.</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>I just submitted a story about my father's spirit and had barely hit

SEND</B>
<P><B>when I remembered a ghost story in my family.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My mother comes from a family where 5 sons and 5 daughters survived

to</B>
<P><B>adulthood; they lived in rural Taiwan during and after WW2. The

third-oldest</B>
<P><B>girl was, they say, the prettiest, sweetest, and most outgoing of the

five</B>
<P><B>sisters, and the one with a busy social life in their town; everyone

loved</B>
<P><B>her, and even my grandmother, not by nature an affectionate or

demonstrative</B>
<P><B>person, adored her. When my aunt was in her late teens or early

twenties,</B>
<P><B>she became ill with what I understand to have been pneumonia. She saw

a</B>
<P><B>doctor, who prescribed medicine and promised that there was no

danger.</B>
<P><B>However, as the night wore on, my aunt grew worse and worse: she

could</B>
<P><B>barely breathe, her muscles weakened, and she grew deathly pale. That

night</B>
<P><B>my grandmother, knowing that her daughter would die, stayed awake,
and deep</B>
<P><B>in the night my aunt came to her to say that she loved her and to say</B>
<P><B>good-bye. She died before dawn.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It turned out that that doctor who had assured them my aunt was in
no danger</B>
<P><B>had given her the wrong medicine. What he gave her destroyed her heart

and</B>
<P><B>lungs.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Ten years later, the doctor was riding his motorcycle through town
when he</B>
<P><B>lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a tree. The accident

killed</B>
<P><B>him. Witnesses said that just before impact, he was screaming my aunt's

name</B>
<P><B>and imploring her to forgive him.</B>

<P>
<P><B>When I was seventeen I dated a guy named "Steve" who was twenty-two.
 I found</B>
<P><B>out that he was an alcoholic and broke up with him.  He was very upset
but I</B>
<P><B>we remained good friends.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A couple of years later, I was living by myself in a duplex, taking
care of an</B>
<P><B>elderly woman.  A friend of mine called to give me the bad news that
Steve was</B>
<P><B>killed in an accident.  I felt terrible.  I called his mother to give

my</B>
<P><B>condolences.  It was then that I found Steve had had an obsession with

me.</B>
<P><B>His family went as far as to bury my pictures, which he kept in his
room, in</B>
<P><B>his coffin.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I went to the grocery store and when I came back, after carrying two
bags in,</B>
<P><B>I came back outside to get more.  The area rug by the front door was

flipped</B>
<P><B>upside down.  (This was a very large piece of indoor/outdoor carpet.)

 I</B>
<P><B>flipped it back over and retrieved two more bags.  It happened again
and once</B>
<P><B>again, I flipped the carpet back over and I said out loud, "Stop it

Steve!"</B>
<P><B>The carpet was turned once more and after putting it back in its place
for a</B>
<P><B>final time I went inside to put up my groceries.  Curiosity got the
best of me</B>
<P><B>so I went out to see if it flipped again.  The carpet was laid neatly

across a</B>
<P><B>chair on the front porch.  Steve has been with me ever since.  Moving

things.</B>
<P><B>Whispering.  At first I was frightened.  Now I am used to it.  However,

Steve</B>
<P><B>has attracted other ghosts!  But that's another story!!    Ronni</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>I lived in a house for seventeen years where strange things </B>
<P><B>occasionally happened. our dryer would often stop in mid cycle and
the door </B>
<P><B>open by itself. It normally took quite a pull to open it and I am sure
it </B>
<P><B>would not just pop open without help. A couple japanese lanterns hanging

</B>
<P><B>would swing when we would walk by often would swing on their own even
when no </B>
<P><B>one had passed and there was no draft that could cause them to move
as they we </B>
<P><B>not near a window. Often my dog would run from one end of the house
to the </B>
<P><B>other just to sit and bark at some unseen thing in an upper corner
of a </B>
<P><B>room. Perhaps the scariest thing was when my sister saw a figure in
a long </B>
<P><B>hooded red robe pass down the hallway in front of her bedroom door
without a </B>
<P><B>sound lit only by the hall nightlight. One last incident there was
shortly </B>
<P><B>before we moved. I heard a cat jump down from the kitchen counter which

</B>
<P><B>was right above my bedroom. It then pitter pattered down the stairs
and </B>
<P><B>jumped up on the end of my bed. I heard the footsteps. I felt it </B>
<P><B>walk along the bottom of my bed and curl up behind my knees. The house
had </B>
<P><B>no history because it was new when we moved in. We did lose a couple
pet </B>
<P><B>cats when we were there.There seems to be no reason for the hooded
figure </B>

</H3><P><B>By:  Clh9876@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>Ok, I used live in a small town of Pennsylvania called Youngsville.
My mom,</B>
<P><B>brother, and I moved into a house on Poplar street. A girl I knew used
to live</B>
<P><B>there and she told me that the house was haunted. I didn't really believe

her.</B>
<P><B>I wasn't really interested in ghosts and stuff. I always thought that

Ghosts</B>
<P><B>stories and and the uija board were just a bunch of made up junk just
to spook</B>
<P><B>peoples interests. Boy was I wrong. A week after we moved in is when
I started</B>
<P><B>to hear strange and unusual sounds most likely coming from the atteck.
I tried</B>
<P><B>to ignore it but it kept on doing it's thing. The sound was a low tone.

More</B>
<P><B>like the dial tone sound of a phone but it was more high pitch. Well
I decided</B>
<P><B>to go check it out. so I went up to the attic and got this really

freaky</B>
<P><B>felling. I mean I had goose bumps on my goose bumps. I didn't hear
the sound</B>
<P><B>again so I went back down stairs to finish unpacking my stuff. I didn't

hear</B>
<P><B>it again for about another 4 weeks. only this time it was coming from

the</B>
<P><B>basement.  I of course went down to check it out and again, found

nothing.</B>
<P><B>well later that night I started getting ready for bed when I thought
I saw</B>
<P><B>someone or something standing in my window, but then again my window
was on</B>
<P><B>the second floor. I ignored it and got into bed. A few minutes later
I thought</B>
<P><B>I saw a person w/ red eyes watching me from the corner of my room.
I immediatly</B>
<P><B>sat up and turned on my light and saw nothing but my boxes of stuff.
I shut</B>
<P><B>the light off again, and laid back down. This time I thought I saw

someone</B>
<P><B>sitting indian style next to my bed w/ yellow eyes, and they were glaring

at</B>
<P><B>me. I sat up again and it was gone. I called for my mom, and she  did

the</B>
<P><B>whole "check the closet and bed there's no such thing as monsters and

ghost"</B>
<P><B>thing. I did manage to get to sleep later that night. A few months
later I had</B>
<P><B>a friend over for the night and we were home alone. We decided to sleep
in the</B>
<P><B>living room so we could watch t.v. or play w/ my dog. We were looking

at</B>
<P><B>magazines when we suddenly heard something crash on the front porch.

It</B>
<P><B>couldn't of been my cat cause he was sleeping infront of the fire place.

The</B>
<P><B>wierd thing was, was that the front porch door was locked right after
my mom</B>
<P><B>left, only when we went to see what happend the door was wide open.
We just</B>
<P><B>kinda laughed and locked the door and went back inside. An hour later

it</B>
<P><B>happend again only it was louder and we also heard the door slam shut.
We both</B>
<P><B>freaked and ran up stairs to my brothers room and grabbed his hocky

stick,</B>
<P><B>num-chucks, army knife, bb gun, the base ball bat, and a crow bar.
when we</B>
<P><B>got back down stairs we noticed that the porch door was open and the
back door</B>
<P><B>was open w/ My dog barking in the back yard when we went out side we

saw</B>
<P><B>nothing, but when we turned around and looked up at the attic window
we saw a</B>
<P><B>person standing in the window and then disappeared. We were both

completely</B>
<P><B>wigged out and went to her house instead.</B>

<P>
<P><B>I am 28 and at about age 12 , I can remember an incident involving
my</B>
<P><B>Grandmother whom I had never met that had passed away 13 years before

I</B>
<P><B>was even born. I have alway's felt this special connection to my</B>
<P><B>Grandmother , I have been told that out of seven Grandchildren I look</B>
<P><B>the most like her and that my mannerisms' are most like her. In fact

I</B>
<P><B>am quite identical to her. We had just moved in to a new home and I

was</B>
<P><B>nervous about meeting new people. I remember having a hard time

falling</B>
<P><B>asleep. I usually only sleep with a sheet over me . It was around

2:00</B>
<P><B>am and I remember this warm feeling and a soft white glow hovering

above</B>
<P><B>me . It was my Grandmother and her face was very distinct. I felt her</B>
<P><B>place a blanket on me. She gave me a reassuring pat as if to say,"</B>
<P><B>everything will be ok." I asked my mother the next morning if she had</B>
<P><B>maybe put the blanket on me overnight being a little skeptical of what

I</B>
<P><B>saw and felt. She said ,"No" and we checked the box which the blanket</B>
<P><B>had been in and it was opened.</B>
<P><B> It was a blanket that I had brought from her home that my

Grandfather</B>
<P><B>still resided in. To this day I ask my Mom if she thinks it could

have</B>
<P><B>happened, and her response is," If it was to happen to anyone it

would</B>
<P><B>have to be you, You would have held a very special place in your</B>
<P><B>Grandmothers' heart."  </B>

<P>
<P><B>It was hard to decide which on to write about, cause I've seen alot

of</B>
<P><B>things that can only be explained in one word, paranormal.  But the

one</B>
<P><B>that stick in my mind the most happened a couple years ago when some</B>
<P><B>friends and I decided to go road cruising in Clay County, Indiana.

 The</B>
<P><B>name of the area is known as Hells Gates, because if ya look at a</B>
<P><B>topographical map there are seven viaducts that are connected by

county</B>
<P><B>roods and if ya draw a line from on to the other it makes a

pentagram.</B>
<P><B>Any ways we were driving around this country road and stopped in

front</B>
<P><B>of what we call the Virgin Mary Cemetery, because of the statue of

the</B>
<P><B>Virgin Mary standing in it.  Some other people we know said that

across</B>
<P><B>the street from it was another cemetery in a groove of trees, so a</B>
<P><B>couple of friends wanted to check it out.  They had ran into some guy

in</B>
<P><B>Terre Haute that was supposedly a paranormal investigator that had</B>
<P><B>showed them some photos of a house in Greencastle and there was an</B>
<P><B>entity on the film.  So they wanted to see if they could get one on</B>
<P><B>video, since the guy said that they would also show up on tape as

well.</B>
<P><B>As they got out of the trucks I decided to stay behind with a couple

of</B>
<P><B>other friend because it was cold and I was gettin a cold, and got a</B>
<P><B>really bad feeling about it.  So four of my friends took off across

the</B>
<P><B>field towards this grove of trees.  As soon as they started walking

we</B>
<P><B>heard what sounded like coyotes behind us, which wasn't unusual for

that</B>
<P><B>time of the morning, and that area.  The only thing is as my friends

got</B>
<P><B>closer to the cemetery the howls got louder and more abundant, not

only</B>
<P><B>were they coming from behind us but they were coming from all around</B>
<P><B>us.  I seen my friends starting to run back towards the trucks, and

they</B>
<P><B>were about a hundred yards away so I figured I would buy them some

time</B>
<P><B>and stepped out of the truck to fire off a couple of rounds in the

air</B>
<P><B>to scare anything off that was in the woods around us.  Fortunately

they</B>
<P><B>were fast runners and I didn't get any shots off.  The weird thing
is</B>
<P><B>that we've been back there a hundred times since then and never heard

a</B>
<P><B>sound, until someone decides to go walking towards the groove of

trees.</B>
<P><B>Then the howling starts again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Like I said this is only one of my experiences, but one of the</B>
<P><B>strangest!!!!!!</B>

<H3><A NAME=1956><B>The 1956 Chevy</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By:  TerrysAngel@webtv.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>When I was in high school, my friend Heather was given a 1956 Chevy

car</B>
<P><B>for her 17th birthday.  It was in pristine condition, for being so

old.</B>
<P><B>The fist night, Heather, myself, and two others went on a joy ride
on</B>
<P><B>the outskirts of our little town.  The small winding roads that went</B>
<P><B>into the countryside were very common for the small Texas towns near</B>
<P><B>ours.  Heather didn't know much about the car, only the name of the

woman</B>
<P><B>who her father bought it from.  After an hour or so, out of the

darkness</B>
<P><B>we saw something in the road.  It was a cow.  We knew that if we hit

it,</B>
<P><B>there would be severe damage to both the car and the cow.  So Heather</B>
<P><B>steered towards the fence.  The car crashed into the fence, and none

of</B>
<P><B>us were hurt.  We got out of the car to see if the cow could be

herded</B>
<P><B>into the pasture, but the cow was gone!  Not even a sight of it!  We</B>
<P><B>looked around and decided that it must have been lights playing

tricks</B>
<P><B>on us.  The car had minimal damage to the front fender, and we went</B>
<P><B>home.  The next week, Heather was picking me up for school, and we

made</B>
<P><B>a stop at the local conveneince store for breakfast. The car just</B>
<P><B>wouldn't stop!  We went right through the glass in the front of the</B>
<P><B>store.  The car was examined, and the brake line had been severed.

 And</B>
<P><B>the last and final incident was two weeks later.  Heather, myself and</B>
<P><B>another friend were driving home from the next town from a football</B>
<P><B>game.  It was getting late, so we decided to take a shortcut through</B>
<P><B>some of the backroads.  All three of us were in the front seat.  All

of</B>
<P><B>a sudden, Heather screamed.  She stopped the car and got out, we</B>
<P><B>followed.  When she finally caught her breath, there was a moment of</B>
<P><B>silence when she told us what she saw.  She claimed to have seen red</B>
<P><B>eyes in the backseat as she glanced in the rearview mirror.  We all</B>
<P><B>believed her.</B>
<P><B>The next day, we all took a trip, in my car, to see the woman whom

her</B>
<P><B>father had bought the car from.  We told her about the events that

had</B>
<P><B>occured in the few months that Heather had the car.  She was not</B>
<P><B>surprised at all.  Her husband bought her the car as a wedding

present</B>
<P><B>back in 1956, and it was his pride and joy.  She had only decided to</B>
<P><B>sell the car after he died just weeks before she sold the car.  She

told</B>
<P><B>us that the money would be returned to her father if that was okay.

 We</B>
<P><B>all believe that the spirit of the man who loved his wife so much

could</B>
<P><B>not bear to see their car sold.  We all believe that these events

were</B>
<P><B>caused by the man to make the car come back. </B>

</H3><P><B>By:  fnm@matrixinet.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi  I'm glad that there is a place for people like me to tell their</B>
<P><B>stories with out being laughed at or scoffed at.  I've told some of

my</B>
<P><B>stories to a few  people but I get strange looks, they nod and smile

and</B>
<P><B>walk away. I have tried to write the stories but I get interference.</B>
<P><B>Something always stops me.  Family emergency, pencils breaking,</B>
<P><B>typewriters screwing up, mental blocks, I start shaking

uncontrollably.</B>
<P><B>The last only happened when I tried to write in the house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I lived in the same house for almost my whole life.  There were

little</B>
<P><B>things that happened back then.  I remember being terrified to go to

the</B>
<P><B>bathroom because I had to go through the utility room to get there.

 The</B>
<P><B>worst part was the closet right by the bathroom door.  I would run

"Hell</B>
<P><B>for leather" to get past that door.  The upstairs was a night mare.

 My</B>
<P><B>brothers told me that they saw things walk through the room on

several</B>
<P><B>occasions.  I didn't sleep up there but I was afraid to go up there</B>
<P><B>alone because it felt like I was being watched.  The landing in</B>
<P><B>particular was the worst.  I'd jump across it and didn't want to be</B>
<P><B>there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I got married and moved out.  A few years later I moved back in.  My</B>
<P><B>father had died and Mom had moved out leaving the house empty.  My

Now</B>
<P><B>ex husband and I moved in with our two little boys.  My husband

became</B>
<P><B>violent and abusive.  He had always been verbally abusive but he

started</B>
<P><B>beating me.  He also started drinking and smoking dope more

regularly.</B>
<P><B>That made it worse.  He finally moved out.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My girlfriend "T" moved in.  She was a girl I went to school with and</B>
<P><B>she was divorced..We decided to share the house.  She claimed to be</B>
<P><B>Psychic was her Mother. I don't know if they were. I do know I had
to</B>
<P><B>go to her on one very frightening experience and they did help. One</B>
<P><B>night  she  left the house to call her mother,(Ididn't have a phone).

 I</B>
<P><B>was struggling to get the coal burning stove going. It was bitter

cold</B>
<P><B>and it was my only source of heat.  The kids were there and the house

was</B>
<P><B>freezing I had to get that thing going. I only had some paper and

some</B>
<P><B>little sticks.Most people don't have experience with coal, but it is</B>
<P><B>very hard to start, nothing like charcoal.  I'd say 10 times harder

to</B>
<P><B>get going.  I threw some coal on top and turned to get some more wood</B>
<P><B>and the fire started on it's own.  I hadn't been home since the night</B>
<P><B>before and there were no embers left.  I hadn't lit a match.  It just</B>
<P><B>started by itself.  It didn't just start it roared to life.  I had
to</B>
<P><B>slam the door to keep the fire from scorching me.  You could hear the</B>
<P><B>flames crackling and whooshing up the chimney.  It was terrifying.</B>
<P>
<P><B>"T" came back right after that. I stood in the living room and she

came</B>
<P><B>in with a smile on her face and said something about the fire and how</B>
<P><B>warm it was getting.  She was acting weird. Finally she said someting</B>
<P><B>about getting a little unsolicited help, and suddenly I couldn't</B>
<P><B>breath.  I wasn't choking, my throat just closed, i couldn't breathe,

I</B>
<P><B>was freezing cold and tears were streaming from my eyes.  She grabbed

me</B>
<P><B>and told me that it was my father and to stop fighting it.  He just</B>
<P><B>wanted to let me know he was okay, afraid but okay.  It let up a

little</B>
<P><B>and I could breathe again. She told me that Dad knew he was gone but</B>
<P><B>didn't want to move on. I don't remember too much after that it's

kind</B>
<P><B>of blury and hazy.  I remember feeling very warm and safe for a short</B>
<P><B>time, (maybe Dad gave me a good bye hug).  She was talking to" Dad"

and</B>
<P><B>told him that he had to move on and he could keep watch but not from</B>
<P><B>where he was now.  Like I said before I don't remember much it all</B>
<P><B>disjointed and jumbled.  I do remember watching the back door for

some</B>
<P><B>reason.   I woke up the next morning and nothing was mentioned about

the</B>
<P><B>night before.  Months later she refered to it in some manner or</B>
<P><B>another.  She said I had abilities that I should practice, but I'm

not</B>
<P><B>clear on what she meant.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That was a mild event.  Maybe I'll tell that one some other time.

 Maybe</B>
<P><B>one of the stories that doesn't like to be told.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  gregk@zoomnet.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B> When I was about 14-15 years old, two friends </B>
<P><B>and I went on a camping trip. None of us were old enough to have a
driver's </B>
<P><B>license, so we walked the 3 miles from our hometown, Point Pleasant,
WV. We had </B>
<P><B>gotten permission to camp on the farm of one of our old elementry school

</B>
<P><B>teachers. It was </B>
<P><B>the middle of the summer, so we didn't bother with a tent. We just
dropped our </B>
<P><B>sleeping bags in a small grove of trees in a hill-side pasture-field
(The cattle </B>
<P><B>were in another pasture at the time.). We picked the spot both because
the trees </B>
<P><B>would block any inclement weather, and because it was within 50' of
a large </B>
<P><B>spring-fed concrete cattle tank that was perfect for a cool soak on
a hot </B>
<P><B>evening.</B>
<P><B>By the time night had fallen, we had a good fire going, and after the
usual </B>
<P><B>round of b.s. and horseplay that occured wherever we happened to be,
we turned </B>
<P><B>in. I managed to go to sleep on top of a knotty root (as usual), and
the </B>
<P><B>discomfort woke me, probably sometime after midnight. The fire had
burned down </B>
<P><B>to a tiny pile of glowing coals, giving off no light to speak of. As
I </B>
<P><B>readjusted myself, I noticed the lights on the opposite </B>
<P><B>hill. That hill was entirely and </B>
<P><B>heavily wooded, and about 300 yards away across a grassy bottom with
a tiny </B>
<P><B>brook running running through it where the grass gave way to woods.
The view was </B>
<P><B>relativly clear even in the darkness . A fine mist was just beginning
to rise, </B>
<P><B>but it was not thick enough to obscure anything; I could still make
out </B>
<P><B>individual trees and bushes. A light was moving through the trees along

</B>
<P><B>the side of the opposite hill. It moved several yards, then abruptly
went out. I </B>
<P><B>took it to be a coon-hunter's flashlight at first, although I had heard
no dogs. </B>
<P><B>Another light came on a short distance away, and repeated the performance

</B>
<P><B>of the first one. About this time, Bob woke up and noticed the show;
like me, he </B>
<P><B>assumed that it was either someone coon hunting, or maybe some aquaintances

from </B>
<P><B>school trying to scare us. Soon, the whole hillside was dotted with
moving </B>
<P><B>lights, all of which traveled about the same distance as the first,
before going </B>
<P><B>out (average duration about 5 seconds). We began to get scared when
we realized </B>
<P><B>that there were too many lights for a hunting party, they were moving

faster </B>
<P><B>than a man could run in heavy woods, and they were getting closer!
We tried </B>
<P><B>awakening our other friend with hissing whispers, but he is a notoriously

sound </B>
<P><B>sleeper, and we could get no more out of him than a snoring grunt.
Soon, the </B>
<P><B>lights began to appear in the grassy bottom. Our fright went to a whole
new </B>
<P><B>level, for the grass was not over ankle high, and the lights drifted
over it; no </B>
<P><B>one was holding them! They came closer, as Bob clutched a knife and
I held a </B>
<P><B>hatchet; I don't know what we would have done with them, but we were
near panic. </B>
<P><B>They came within 50'; one of them even made half a circut around the
cattle tank </B>
<P><B>in plain view before winking out like the rest. After that, they began

drifting </B>
<P><B>back toward the other hill. The entire sequence was repeated in reverse

order, </B>
<P><B>until the last light winked out near where the first one had appeared.
The whole </B>
<P><B>thing took probably 15 min. to half an hour. Neither Bob nor I had
ever seen </B>
<P><B>anything like this before, or since, for that matter. I've never heard
of anyone </B>
<P><B>else seeing anything similar in this area, either. If anyone has, then
I'd like </B>
<P><B>to hear about it.</B>

<P><B>One night when I was baking I had set my cookbook on the counter and
left the</B>
<P><B>room for a minute. I came back and the cookbook was inside of a pot
of boiling</B>
<P><B>water. I freaked and went to bed. The next night it had snowed and
I opened</B>
<P><B>the curtains to watch the snow fall down. Then I left the room and
came back,</B>
<P><B>and the curtains were closed. Just the other night I was online and
I heard</B>
<P><B>someone talking so I opened the door and both of our sterios were turned

on</B>
<P><B>along with the T.V.'s . I went out of the room and turned everything

off</B>
<P><B>thinking it was just a power surge. But when I went back into the room

where</B>
<P><B>the computer was there was someone or something standing by the window.
It was</B>
<P><B>a black figure, very short and had no arms or head. Every since then
we've had</B>
<P><B>no problems. But I later found out that a person was murdered in my
attic 1</B>
<P><B>year before we moved in here. Someone had broken into the house and
cut off</B>
<P><B>the guys legs and arms and shove him into the attic and left him there.

<P>
<P><B>Well, first of all, I have to admit, I </B>
<P><B>have read EVERYONE of the stories on your page, and I think they are
</B>
<P><B>great. Most of this stuff scares the bee-gee-bees out of me, but I
can't </B>
<P><B>help but to continue reading. I have a couple of other experiences
I will </B>
<P><B>send at a later date. However, today I wanted to send you a quick mail

</B>
<P><B>telling you about a place out here in CA that is 'supposedly' haunted....

to </B>
<P><B>me... there is no 'supposedily' part to it. Well, this is a restaurant
in </B>
<P><B>Los Gatos, CA. It is called the Chart house. Unfortunately (or </B>
<P><B>fortunately for those that enjoy this kind of stuff), this place has
a couple of </B>
<P><B>.......'residents'. This restaurant once was a Morgue! Well, it </B>
<P><B>obviously is not something that they owners like to be known to the
public, </B>
<P><B>being bad for business and all. Well, I had the occasion to dine at
the </B>
<P><B>Chart house one evening. We had ordered and the food had arrived...
</B>
<P><B>everything good so far. Well, I decided to use the restroom (RR) (which
is </B>
<P><B>in the downstairs part of the resturant). Well, in the RR, its as normal

</B>
<P><B>as any other, except that it has a nice, old, and tall standing mirror
that is </B>
<P><B>in one corner of the RR, and looking into the mirror, you can see the

</B>
<P><B>sinks. Well, I was in there, all alone... so I thought. I was </B>
<P><B>putting on some lipstick, and making sure that I looked ok...normal
stuff, when </B>
<P><B>the faucet (which I can see from the mirror) came on FULL BLAST. Needless

</B>
<P><B>to say, it scare the you-know-what out of me. I know that this sounds

</B>
<P><B>stupid and all, but the only thing that I could think of was to say
out loud (as </B>
<P><B>calmly as I could) Please, Don't scare me like that!!! and I walked
</B>
<P><B>over (ok... I moved pretty quickly) to the faucet, turned it off, and

pretty </B>
<P><B>much took off upstairs to my table. Well, I talked to the guy I was
having </B>
<P><B>dinner with and he told me that the place used to be a morgue.... I
was a tad </B>
<P><B>freaked on that. The waitress had to wait until the table next to us
left, </B>
<P><B>(she didn't want to scare them off I guess) then she came over and
told us the </B>
<P><B>brief history of the place.... and yes, it was a morgue at one point.
I ended up </B>
<P><B>taking my dinner home.... </B>
