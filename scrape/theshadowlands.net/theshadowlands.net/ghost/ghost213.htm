<p><b>The American Morgue at Japan</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: BMCSWJIM@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;This is a true story that took place at Yokosuka Japan.&nbsp;
There is an</b>
<br><b>American Naval Base there.&nbsp; When I first arrived in the spring
of 1981 there</b>
<br><b>was a white building on the corner of the property that the Naval
Hospital</b>
<br><b>was located.&nbsp; I learned that this building was the Morgue where
many of the</b>
<br><b>bodies of American Service Members killed in combat at Korea and
Viet Nam had</b>
<br><b>been staged prior to returning home to their families in the United
States.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Shortly after my arrival, bulldozers demolished the building
to make way</b>
<br><b>for two high rise apartment buildings that would house American
Service men</b>
<br><b>and their families.&nbsp; My family and I would be housed in one
of these</b>
<br><b>buildings after its construction.&nbsp; The buildings were named
Kyuban and Jyuban</b>
<br><b>Towers.&nbsp; The Japanese words for nine and ten, (there were already
eight of</b>
<br><b>these towers on base).</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Immediately after construction was completed, my wife was
notified that she</b>
<br><b>was to move into an apartment in Kyuban Towers, I was out at sea.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>complied, and it wasn't long before she started noticing strange
occurences</b>
<br><b>in the apartment.&nbsp; Minor things like the lights being on and
she was sure she</b>
<br><b>had turned them off.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Months later I returned home, and was please that we had moved
into much</b>
<br><b>better housing on base.&nbsp; But I was met with strange stories
from my three</b>
<br><b>year old son.&nbsp; He told me of a "Marine Sentry" who visited
him each night in</b>
<br><b>his room.&nbsp; I assured him that he was dreaming.&nbsp; My first
night home I tucked</b>
<br><b>him into bed and turned off all of the lights in the house.&nbsp;
At 3:00 AM I was</b>
<br><b>awaken by&nbsp; a presence at my side of the bed.&nbsp; It was my
son, and all of the</b>
<br><b>lights were on in the apartment.&nbsp; I asked him what was going
on, and he said</b>
<br><b>that the "Marine Sentry" was in his room and wanted the lights on.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>ofcourse checked out his story to make sure the house was safe.&nbsp;
No one else</b>
<br><b>was in the house besides my family and I.&nbsp; I tucked my son
back into bed and</b>
<br><b>turned off the lights.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The next morning I asked my son to discribe for me the man
who kept</b>
<br><b>visiting him in his room.&nbsp; That three year old boy floored
me when he</b>
<br><b>discribed an Infantry&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marine in full combat gear.&nbsp;
This problem continued</b>
<br><b>for several weeks.&nbsp; One time, a buddy of mine suggested that
I turn the</b>
<br><b>lights out at the breaker box which was out of my sons reach and
my son did</b>
<br><b>not know where the box was.&nbsp; So I did.&nbsp; At 3:00 AM I awoke
to the same</b>
<br><b>scenario as always.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;So then my buddy agreed to spend the night in my sons room
with him.&nbsp; At</b>
<br><b>3:00 AM I awoke to an awful rukus in my sons room.&nbsp; My son
ran into my room</b>
<br><b>to tell me that Mr. ***** was fighting with the Marine Sentry.&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>arrived in my sons room, my buddy was sitting on the floor in the
coner of</b>
<br><b>the room, the bedroom looked as if a bar brawl had just occured.&nbsp;
My buddy</b>
<br><b>told me that he woke up and seen a Marine standing over him, he
was wearing</b>
<br><b>face paint to camoflague his appearance, and was in full combat
gear.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>Marine face looked as if he were in a jungle and he had stumbled
onto an</b>
<br><b>enemy camp.&nbsp; It was clear that the Marine was on a mission.&nbsp;
But no Marine</b>
<br><b>was there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;From that night on, no one in the house seen the Marine again,
but either</b>
<br><b>he or one of his friends was still in the apartment as we still
experienced</b>
<br><b>strange occurrances.&nbsp; We could be setting at the dinning table
eating and all</b>
<br><b>of a sudden the tv would come on and go to full audio.&nbsp; Or,
the washing</b>
<br><b>machine lid would open and close and the washer machine would start
up by</b>
<br><b>itself.&nbsp; Try setting on the toilet without the bathtub/shower
turning itself</b>
<br><b>on.&nbsp; We put up with it as it seemed more amusing than annoying.&nbsp;
We were</b>
<br><b>never awakened in the middle of the night again though.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Finally during our last week in the apartment it was obvious
that the</b>
<br><b>"ghost" wanted us to stay.&nbsp; Things began to disappear.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Just wanted to share this experinence my mother had while she was
in Mercy</b>
<br><b>General Hospital in Sacramento California, recovering from a hysterectomy.</b>
<br><b>One night mom woke up and out of the corner of her eye she saw a
dark mass</b>
<br><b>floating in the hallway. It floated between her door and the doorway
across</b>
<br><b>the hall where a very sick woman was a patient. It never entered
the rooms,</b>
<br><b>it just hoovered there. When she tried to look straight at it, it</b>
<br><b>disappeared. For three nights she saw this black mass floating in
the</b>
<br><b>hallway..then on the fourth day mom heard "code blue code blue"
on the</b>
<br><b>intercom and heard a loud commotion in the hallway as doctors and
nurses</b>
<br><b>hurried into the room across the hall pulling their equipment behind
them.</b>
<br><b>The woman in that room died. Mom didn't see the dark mass that night
or any</b>
<br><b>night after that during the remainder of her stay.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Blue Man</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MWyatt13@cs.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>In 1977 I was 8 years old and lived with my parents and my younger
brother in</b>
<br><b>a big house in the Northwest suburbs of Chicago. There I had an
experience</b>
<br><b>that I remember like it was yesterday.&nbsp; One night I awoke feeling
cold, I sat</b>
<br><b>up in my bed to reach for an extra blanket that was folded at the
foot of my</b>
<br><b>bed.&nbsp; When I did so I saw a "ghost" standing several feet from
the foot of my</b>
<br><b>bed.&nbsp; The figure I saw looked like that blue dot you see in
your vision after</b>
<br><b>looking into a flash from a camera, but it had the distinct shape
of a</b>
<br><b>person.&nbsp; After looking at this form for some time I jumped
from my bed and</b>
<br><b>ran down the hall into the bathroom turning on the lights and shutting
the</b>
<br><b>door.&nbsp; Eventually I got the courage to look down the hall and
turned on all</b>
<br><b>the lights.&nbsp; The Blue Man had disappeared and I eventually
went back to sleep</b>
<br><b>with all the lights on.&nbsp; I told my Mom (and only my Mom as
I did not think</b>
<br><b>anyone would believe me) the story the next day.&nbsp; The strangest
thing about</b>
<br><b>this is that a week or so later my Mother was talking to the neighbor,
who</b>
<br><b>told my Mom her son had told her almost the exact same story, describing
the</b>
<br><b>ghost in the same way. I never discussed my sighting with the neighbor
kid or</b>
<br><b>anyone other than my own mother for years.&nbsp; My mother still
lives in the</b>
<br><b>house and has had several strange experiences since then but no
more</b>
<br><b>sightings of the Blue Man.</b>

<p><b>The Blue Roof Runner</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: darren english@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is minsue and i would like to share my supernatural experiences
with you because no on else is willing to belive or accept my encounters.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it all started about 3 days ago at about 2 in
the mornig. I woke up to hare some very loud and disturbing footsteps.This
probably wouldnt have scared me so much except that the footysteps came
from the first roof of my house. I didnt know what to do so I just lied
there scared.</b>
<br><b>But 10 seconds later what ever made the foot steps on the roof was
breathing loudly at my window. At this point I jumped out of bed and ran
into my mothers room.I looked out her&nbsp; window and saw absolutly nothing.
The next day i told my mother what I had heard and ofcourse she just snickered
and thought nothing of it.the next night I was determined to&nbsp; stay
up and see what was going on.At 3:30 in the moprning this time i was startled
by a loud thump in front of my window and quickly shot ouit of bed to see
what it was.again I sae nothing.At this point i was scared and puzzled
at to what this was.I climbed back into bed and continued to listen, the
thumping went on but as it did i began to hear something different, something
in the backround of all the noise.It was laughter, Not normal funny laughter.It
was histerical, mad in a way.The thumping continued and the laughter faded
and i began to slowly doze off.When i awoke this time I immideatly told
my sister what I heard.Unfortunatly she was the only one who believed me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although this thumping and laughter was very
frightning,it may have had some connections to the encounter i experienced
just few weeks ago.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in my sisters room, looking for a book
I had lost,under the bed i was sure.when all of a sudden i saw a woman
dressed in blue standing over me.i let out a scream and ran downstairs
to tell my mom.we went back up stairs to check things out. Nothing was
there. but this time my mom was considerably worried.She thought maybe
it had been a burgler and franticley checked under the bed and in the closet,
but found nothing.These two experences my be connected some how but for
now they will remain a mystery.</b>

<br><b>Missouri City, Texas</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tiger_oscar@ev1.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was raised in Missouri City Texas which is a suburb of Houston.
If you head south on Murphy Rd(1092) past Cartwright Rd. on the left you
will come to Eldorado Drive. Travel down Eldorado until you cross the bridge
and turn right at the first street. Drive down this street until you come
to Hampton Dr.&nbsp; There you will see a very large fence covered in overgrowth.
Through the fence you can see a large home that backs itself to the golf
course. This home is known by all who live in it's vicinity as the Hampton
House or the Cartwright House. The story begins about forty years ago.
Mr. Cartwright and his wife lived in the house and owned all of the property
which Quail Valley is built upon today. Cartwright Rd was actually named
after him. All was well until Mrs. Cartwright came down with a terminal
illness of some sort. When Mr. Cartwright was no longer able to give his
wife the care she demanded he hired a live in nurse. As his wife's condition
worsened Mr.. Cartwright began fraternizing with the nurse. One day when
Mrs.. Cartwright's calls went un answered, she made her way into her wheel
chair and into the living room catching her husband and the nurse in a
moment of passion. Mrs. Cartwright died the next day.</b>
<br><b>Mr. Cartwright and the nurse soon after moved away together and
were married.</b>
<br><b>He left all of the furniture and some of his possessions in the
house when he left.</b>
<br><b>After His death, the property was left to his son which would not
live at the house, but hired security guards to keep looters out. My father
was a Fort Bend county Sheriff Deputy for many years, and has had friends
work security at the house in the evening. He says that the guards were
paid very well and were given a large cooler of food to take with them
into the house. There has never been a security guard that has stayed in
the house more than 3 hours. They have reported the elevator going up and
down on its own, Sounds of a woman crying, an invisible wheel chair that
travels up and down the hallway leaving tracks in the carpet, and even
books flying off the shelves at them. One of my fathers good friends is
from Ireland and says he has had encounters with ghosts before and is unafraid.
He worked in the house and left after 2 hours. He said he has never seen
anything like it. Well the security guards have sense stopped in the past
ten years. The House has never been lived in since the Cartwright's. I
have always wanted to sneak into it some Halloween night and see for myself,
but since it would be breaking and entering and hence illegal I will not.
I have never seen anything about the house listed anywhere, yet everyone
in the area seems to know about it.</b>
<br><b>Pretty cool Huh?</b>

<br><b>The Cat in the Window</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ARudisill@foleylaw.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was driving up to my home and since it was dusk outside my headlights
were</b>
<br><b>on.&nbsp; As I arrived at the driveway my headlights beamed on the
window of a</b>
<br><b>front bedroom in my home.&nbsp; There sat a gray cat on the sill
just gazing out</b>
<br><b>as cats do but then abruptly she jumped down and away.&nbsp; I was
dumbfounded</b>
<br><b>because I knew distinctly that that portion of the house had doors
closed at</b>
<br><b>all times so that my present cats (a gray cat and a calico cat)
would not go</b>
<br><b>into those bedrooms and spray.&nbsp; But I thought well, perchance
a door was</b>
<br><b>left ajar.&nbsp; I entered the house and sure enough the hallway
door was</b>
<br><b>completely closed.&nbsp; I opened the hallway door and sure enough
said bedroom</b>
<br><b>door was shut closed too.&nbsp; So before I even open the bedroom
door I hear my</b>
<br><b>cat (she also gray) shuffling in the kitty box in the kitchen which
is</b>
<br><b>situated at the other side of the house.&nbsp; I haven't even opened
the bedroom</b>
<br><b>door yet.&nbsp; So now I open the bedroom door, go in and sure enough
the blinds</b>
<br><b>are askew at the corner where I saw the cat make her exit.&nbsp;
A day bed</b>
<br><b>resting against that side of the wall next to that corner of the
window,</b>
<br><b>well the stuffed animals were strewn on the floor and behind the
bed against</b>
<br><b>the wall.&nbsp; A cat ghost?</b>

<p><b>The Child Who Talks To His Deceased Grandfather</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: psc1436@cstel.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have several stories that I could tell and I will probably post</b>
<br><b>another&nbsp; as time goes on, but this is the most recent. In March
of</b>
<br><b>1998, my step-daughter was pregnant with her first child and at</b>
<br><b>the same time her father-in-law was in the last stages of cancer</b>
<br><b>and dying. Her husband spent about 3 weeks at a central Georgia</b>
<br><b>hospital by his father's bedside. He died on March 23rd. and was</b>
<br><b>buried on March 25th. She had the baby on March 26th. It was a boy</b>
<br><b>and he was named after his deceased grandfather. They kept a</b>
<br><b>picture of the man that had died on the refrigerator and had told</b>
<br><b>their son&nbsp; that was his grandaddy Kenneth. When the child was</b>
<br><b>about 2 1/2 and talking, there were several times when they heard</b>
<br><b>him talking to someone when noone was in the room with him. Each</b>
<br><b>time they would ask him who he was talking to, he would say</b>
<br><b>"Grandaddy Kenneth". When they would ask him who that was, he</b>
<br><b>would say "that man on the refrigerator". When they asked him what</b>
<br><b>they had talked about, his answers were always about things that</b>
<br><b>the child would have had no way of knowing, had someone not told</b>
<br><b>him of them and his parents never had. It has been a couple of</b>
<br><b>months now since he has had conversations with his grandfather</b>
<br><b>that they know of.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Dearly Departed</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: arangel@enesco.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Ever since I was young, I've had various experiences with odd things.</b>
<br><b>Not so much a rememberance of ghostly things, but of dreams and
visions</b>
<br><b>that came true.&nbsp; One time while out with my family I began
to get this</b>
<br><b>feeling that something was wrong.&nbsp; We had just recently bought
a puppy</b>
<br><b>and I thought for some reason that the gate we had put up to block
her</b>
<br><b>descent to the basement didn't work and that the dog had jumped
over</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; I could even see it happening in my mind.&nbsp; When we
got home, we</b>
<br><b>found her unharmed, but whining up at us from the basement floor.</b>
<br><b>While in high school, I dreamt of various people and situations
that</b>
<br><b>came true.&nbsp; Whenever something that I dreamed would come to
pass, all</b>
<br><b>sound would leave me and my vision would get blurry and I would
see the</b>
<br><b>scene come to pass as though I were dreaming it awake.&nbsp; If
that makes</b>
<br><b>any sense.</b>
<br><b>The reason that I talk about this is that it makes me wonder if
this</b>
<br><b>sensitivity to...I don't know...other extrasensory abilities has
made it</b>
<br><b>possible for other things to happen.&nbsp; Such as while living
with my</b>
<br><b>husband in our first apartment we would constantly have power surges,</b>
<br><b>things could be heard moving in the kitchen, and our cat would look
at</b>
<br><b>the door and start jumping and crying at something even though there
was</b>
<br><b>nothing.&nbsp; One night we woke up and there was a bright light
shining in</b>
<br><b>our bedroom.&nbsp; At first I thought I was dreaming, but then my
husband got</b>
<br><b>up and looked out the window because he could have sworn that someone</b>
<br><b>had to be shining one of those huge spot lights into our window.&nbsp;
But it</b>
<br><b>was pitch black outside.&nbsp; Even the cat was looking around.&nbsp;
The next day</b>
<br><b>our roomate came home to all of the lights being on in our house.</b>
<br><b>We lost our daughter a little over three years ago, prior to moving
into</b>
<br><b>our home.&nbsp; On several occasions I have come home or been at
home when</b>
<br><b>the sorrow overtook me and I would begin crying almost hysterically.</b>
<br><b>One of the last gifts given to my daughter prior to her death was
the</b>
<br><b>"Sleep and Snore Ernie".&nbsp; One of the catch phrases he says
upon</b>
<br><b>physically being sat up was that "I feel great".&nbsp; On the first
occasion</b>
<br><b>that I was crying heavily I was standing in my bedroom and the doll
was</b>
<br><b>lying on the bed.&nbsp; Suddenly it began to repeat over and over
the phrase</b>
<br><b>"I feel great".&nbsp; I remember walking over to the doll and lifting
it in</b>
<br><b>my arms as it repeated it.&nbsp; I thought at first that it was
broken.&nbsp; As</b>
<br><b>quickly as it started, it stopped.&nbsp; And nothing I did would
get it to</b>
<br><b>repeat it.&nbsp; When we moved into our current home of 3 years
I had another</b>
<br><b>crying episode.&nbsp; This time the doll was lying in the crib in
another</b>
<br><b>room beside our bedroom and I was lying on my bed.&nbsp; Suddenly
it started</b>
<br><b>to repeat the phrase.&nbsp; I can no longer have any doubt that
my daughter</b>
<br><b>IS fine and has let me know it.&nbsp; My husband on several occasions
has</b>
<br><b>seen her sitting on a bed (she was only 9 months old), and my nephew
has</b>
<br><b>seen her in our basement.</b>
<br><b>Another thing that happened a few years ago was that we were painting</b>
<br><b>our kitchen.&nbsp; It didn't show up right away, but shortly there
after I</b>
<br><b>was looking at the wall by our back door when I noticed what looked
like</b>
<br><b>a hand print.&nbsp; Unbelievingly I stepped up closer to it.&nbsp;
And there it</b>
<br><b>was.&nbsp; You can distinctly see the palm and five fingers.&nbsp;
It looks as</b>
<br><b>though it were placed there by a small child reaching up to touch
the</b>
<br><b>wall.&nbsp; I cannot remember if we had our niece there that day
or not, but</b>
<br><b>from the size of the hand print and the way it was made, it couldn't</b>
<br><b>have been her because she was taller and her hand was larger.&nbsp;
Plus my</b>
<br><b>sister-in-law would have said something and it would have shown
up right</b>
<br><b>away instead of showing up months later.</b>
<br><b>Another thing that happened was a girlfriend of mine had a sick
daughter</b>
<br><b>with a terminal illness.&nbsp; While drying clothes in a dryer I
was told the</b>
<br><b>following day that her daughter was in the hospital on a respirator
and</b>
<br><b>that during the trip to the hospital in the ambulance she had stopped</b>
<br><b>breathing and it had been a close thing to try to bring her back.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>girlfriend believes that her daughter did in fact die at that time
and</b>
<br><b>they were only supporting her body back at the hospital.&nbsp; But
the funny</b>
<br><b>thing was that when I went the next day to take my clothes out of
the</b>
<br><b>dryer, they smelled like the little girl.&nbsp; And it's never happened</b>
<br><b>again.</b>
<br><b>My husband once had an experience that terrified him.&nbsp; I was
working</b>
<br><b>late one night and when I came home it was to find the garage door
open</b>
<br><b>and my husband standing in the doorway with nothing more than a
towel</b>
<br><b>wrapped around his damp body and armed with a large butcher's knife.</b>
<br><b>When I parked and stepped out of the car he asked me if I had just</b>
<br><b>gotten home and when I said yes he stated in a scared voice that
there</b>
<br><b>was someone in the house.&nbsp; At first I couldn't believe it,
but then he</b>
<br><b>finished by saying that as he was standing by the front door looking
for</b>
<br><b>me, out of the corner of his eye he could see the distinct figure
of a</b>
<br><b>man with a sombrero walking past the opening into the kitchen and
then</b>
<br><b>the heavy thud of his boots as he walked downstairs.&nbsp; He thought
that</b>
<br><b>maybe it was me trying to play a practical joke on him.&nbsp; Needless
to say</b>
<br><b>I was spooked and arming myself with another knife we decided to</b>
<br><b>investigate and look for this man.&nbsp; Well, our search ended
in nothing</b>
<br><b>and he put it off as his imagination, even though he swears that
the</b>
<br><b>sound of the footsteps were loud and clear.&nbsp; He finished dressing
and</b>
<br><b>went out to play soccer with his cousins that night as originally</b>
<br><b>planned.&nbsp; While he was gone I received a phone call from his
mother in</b>
<br><b>Mexico.&nbsp; His grandfather had passed away the evening before.&nbsp;
I believe</b>
<br><b>that the figure he saw was his grandfather coming to see him one
last</b>
<br><b>time as he was very close to my husband.</b>
<br><b>The home I live in is constantly being bombarded by power surges,</b>
<br><b>strange noises of things dropping (very heavy things that when we</b>
<br><b>investigate there's nothing out of place), and creaking of the steps
as</b>
<br><b>though someone were coming down them and the suddenly you get a
chill</b>
<br><b>that stays for a while and then suddenly leaves you.&nbsp; If I'm
by myself</b>
<br><b>the activity seems to pick up and it's only when I yell to the girls
to</b>
<br><b>go to bed that things quiet down.&nbsp; I'm sure that there are
people out</b>
<br><b>there that don't believe in ghosts, but with everything that has</b>
<br><b>happened to me, I can't doubt it.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Entity in the Trailor</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have been reading stories from here for some time now and I figured
it</b>
<br><b>wouldn't hurt to explain a little of what my family went through
in the</b>
<br><b>early 90's.&nbsp; It was something that I thought was never going
to end.&nbsp; But it</b>
<br><b>did and I thank God that my son doesn't remember much of it.&nbsp;
My now</b>
<br><b>ex-husband and I lived in a Trailer in Tampa Florida at the time.&nbsp;
My oldest</b>
<br><b>son was only 3 years old and the other was only a year old.&nbsp;
Ever since my</b>
<br><b>oldest was born we had this entity that followed us.&nbsp; I had
seen it several</b>
<br><b>times but I thought is was my father in law that never was able
to see his</b>
<br><b>grandchildren.&nbsp; This thing was not bad,&nbsp; but it did show
up at the damndest</b>
<br><b>times.&nbsp; I would see him staring at me at the end of the hall
and I once saw</b>
<br><b>him in the bathroom.&nbsp;&nbsp; He would hide things from us, among
the usual things</b>
<br><b>that ghost find amusing.&nbsp; I used to stay up late at night and
he would walk</b>
<br><b>down the hall and stop at the couch. Stand there for a while then
go back to</b>
<br><b>the other end.&nbsp; This never really bothered me,&nbsp; but it
was un-nerving at</b>
<br><b>times.&nbsp; My ex really didn't believe me about that part.&nbsp;
He thought I was</b>
<br><b>making more of this then what there was.&nbsp; So one night I told
him to stay up</b>
<br><b>and find out for himself.&nbsp; He did,&nbsp; and wouldn't you guess.&nbsp;
As that thing</b>
<br><b>was walking down the hall my ex started to squeeze my arm.&nbsp;
It stopped, then</b>
<br><b>turned around and walked back.&nbsp; By this time. I was used to
it.&nbsp; It wasn't</b>
<br><b>bad. It was just there.&nbsp; Then about two months later I realized
my son was</b>
<br><b>talking to it.&nbsp; I watched him from the crack in his bedroom
door talking to</b>
<br><b>someone in the closet and playing with toys.&nbsp; Then at nap time
he would tell</b>
<br><b>me that Papa said he was a good boy for eating his lunch and that
papa said</b>
<br><b>he was a good boy for cleaning up his toys.&nbsp; This was getting
to be a little</b>
<br><b>much because I thought that maybe it would lead to worse things.&nbsp;
I have</b>
<br><b>always been interested in the paranormal and such things.&nbsp;
I believe in</b>
<br><b>ghost and worse.&nbsp; I didn't want the latter to come to my son
and harm him.</b>
<br><b>But I was too late in thinking about this.&nbsp; Three days went
by and my son</b>
<br><b>said nothing of papa and his room was ice cold.&nbsp; I had him
sleeping with us</b>
<br><b>and the other baby,&nbsp; because the room was cold enough to see
your breath in.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I told my husband I wanted to move but he said we didn't
have the money.</b>
<br><b>Then on the third night I had the boys sleeping in my bedroom The
oldest in</b>
<br><b>my bed and the other in his crib.&nbsp; We fell asleep in the livingroom
watching</b>
<br><b>tv.&nbsp; About 2 am we woke up to my oldest screaming in a frantic
way.&nbsp; We ran</b>
<br><b>in the room and he said that the bite was squeezing his legs.&nbsp;
When I picked</b>
<br><b>him up his legs were white at the bottom, like they were being squeezed
very</b>
<br><b>hard.&nbsp; My husband grabbed the baby and I had Kenneth we went
into the living</b>
<br><b>room and was trying to sooth Kenneth.&nbsp; Matthew didn't wake
up at all through</b>
<br><b>this.&nbsp; In fact through the whole ordeal it never effected Matthew.&nbsp;
Only</b>
<br><b>Kenneth.&nbsp; I asked him what the bite was and he told me that
it was big and</b>
<br><b>hairy and had a snotty nose and big teeth.&nbsp; And that it looked
like what he</b>
<br><b>called a walking animal.&nbsp; I thought he had one hell of a dream
and tried to</b>
<br><b>put him back to sleep but he would have none of that.&nbsp; I even
put the marks</b>
<br><b>on his legs out my mind until the next night.&nbsp; The next night
he didn't want</b>
<br><b>to sleep in his room or mine.&nbsp; He said that the bite would
come back. I let</b>
<br><b>him fall asleep on the couch with me while my husband slept in my
room with</b>
<br><b>the baby. At about twelve that night I was still watching tv on
the couch</b>
<br><b>while Kenneth laid sleeping next to me and I heard it for the first
time.</b>
<br><b>It ran and stomped all the way down the hall.&nbsp; it was hard
enough the make</b>
<br><b>the trailer shake. As it got to the end of the hall it stomped again.
My</b>
<br><b>husband came out of the room and asked what the hell was that and
I just</b>
<br><b>looked at him and said very scarred at that point.&nbsp; I think
it is the bite.</b>
<br><b>He then got the baby and came out into the livingroom with me and
kenneth.</b>
<br><b>he put Matthew in his playpen to sleep and we pulled out the sofa
bed so we</b>
<br><b>could all sleep in the same room.We sat up for a while talking about
what we</b>
<br><b>might be going through and then we slowly went to sleep.&nbsp; A
short time later</b>
<br><b>or what it seemed Kenneth again woke up screaming about the bite.&nbsp;
He said</b>
<br><b>that it was in the room with us and that it was going to touch daddy.&nbsp;
This</b>
<br><b>was the worst feeling we ever had.&nbsp; Because at that point the
room started</b>
<br><b>to smell like sewer waste.&nbsp; It was like the smell was a thick
fog or</b>
<br><b>something.&nbsp; The smell was so thick I thought I was going to
suffercate.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>prayed out loud for a few minutes and rebuked what ever it was scaring
my</b>
<br><b>son.&nbsp; It finally left and we didn't sleep for the rest of the
night.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>next day we left the house and went to look for a new house to move
to.&nbsp; On</b>
<br><b>arriving back to the house Kenneth got so scarred when we pulled
into the</b>
<br><b>driveway that he threw up black stuff.&nbsp; We had nothing black
to eat that day</b>
<br><b>so I didn't understand.&nbsp; Well we couldn't find another house
we could aford</b>
<br><b>at the time so we took turns staying up watching over Kenneth.&nbsp;
It came back</b>
<br><b>several times after that within a months time frame. Enough to scare
Kenneth</b>
<br><b>while he was awake also.&nbsp; It one time ran between my husband
and myself you</b>
<br><b>could hear it and you could smell it but you couldn't see it.&nbsp;
Only Kenneth.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; he was terrified.&nbsp; He screamed no Mommy,&nbsp; no daddy.&nbsp;
As it ran between.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>tried to explained to him that it couldn't harm mommy or daddy that
it was</b>
<br><b>just trying to scare him.&nbsp; But all the same it was torturing
my son.&nbsp; And I</b>
<br><b>was completely helpless or I felt so. The stinch was bad,&nbsp;
the feeling was</b>
<br><b>bad.&nbsp; My poor baby was terrified.&nbsp; And to make things
worse.&nbsp; That night</b>
<br><b>when it was my turn to sleep.&nbsp; It touched me not once but twice.&nbsp;
Just to</b>
<br><b>show me that it could touch us I guess.&nbsp; We would let Kenneth
sleep in our</b>
<br><b>arms just so he felt safe and he did.&nbsp; But it didn't always
keep him from</b>
<br><b>waking up scared to death that the bite was gojng to get us. After
alot of</b>
<br><b>praying and a pastor blessing the house three different times it
seemed to</b>
<br><b>go away. A month went by and we could finally afford to move. We
moved to an</b>
<br><b>upstairs apartment and about two years went by.&nbsp; All was well
and we had</b>
<br><b>another baby boy in the family.&nbsp; One morning while Kenneth
was helping me</b>
<br><b>change baby Jack's diaper he told me that a little indian girl named
Donka</b>
<br><b>came to his window (second floor) and was telling him that she was
scared</b>
<br><b>and that she could not find her mommy and daddy.&nbsp; I asked Kenneth
how she</b>
<br><b>came to his window when we lived on the second floor and he told
me that she</b>
<br><b>was just there.&nbsp; I asked him what she was wearing and he said
light blue</b>
<br><b>cloths and that she looked like she was really tired because her
eyes looked</b>
<br><b>funny. Then he said that she told him that he could fly and that
he should</b>
<br><b>jump out of the window.&nbsp; Well that was it.&nbsp; I&nbsp; got
his clothes and his</b>
<br><b>brothers clothes out of the room along with some toys and locked
his door</b>
<br><b>shut.&nbsp; I went down stairs to my aunts house and was telling
her about this.</b>
<br><b>I then prayed over the apartment and was truly afraid for my son.&nbsp;
This was</b>
<br><b>now too many times he has had been effected by something. A few
days later</b>
<br><b>while down at my aunts house with all the kids we heard someone
running</b>
<br><b>around from room to room in my apartment. My aunt asked who was
in the</b>
<br><b>apartment and I said no one, that I locked the door on my was out.&nbsp;
She was</b>
<br><b>scared and said go check and that she would keep the kids.&nbsp;
I went up stairs</b>
<br><b>and heard someone in the apartment.&nbsp; Like they were going from
room to room</b>
<br><b>looking for something.&nbsp; As I unlocked the door I flung it open
and caught a</b>
<br><b>glimpes of someone short running into the hall.&nbsp; Not thinking
I ran after</b>
<br><b>it,&nbsp; and couldn't find nothing.&nbsp; I was scarred as you
can imagine and ran</b>
<br><b>back down stairs locking the door behind me.&nbsp; Then I called
my church and</b>
<br><b>asked my pastor what I should do.&nbsp; He said to bring Kenneth
to him so he</b>
<br><b>could teach Kenneth the Lords Prayer and that God was in his heart
and there</b>
<br><b>is nothing stronger or mighter than God.&nbsp; Kenneth no longer
has any problems</b>
<br><b>since than and he is a very good little 12 years old.&nbsp; He doesn't
remember</b>
<br><b>anything but the indian girl.&nbsp; He says that she really was
scary looking and</b>
<br><b>that he is glad that he has god to protect him from those kinds
of things.</b>
<br><b>I an sorry this was so long.&nbsp; But I can't tell just anybody
about this.</b>
<br><b>They start asking Kenneth questions about ghost and the such and
it confuses</b>
<br><b>him.&nbsp; Thanks alot for reading.</b>

<p><b>The First Time I Saw Something</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:wfannon@mail.tqci.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was 7 years old at the time. I was fast asleep when I was awakened
by my bedroom light coming on, I could see the orange glow if the light
through my eyelids. I was laying on my back, so I turned to my sisters
bed to see if it was her, but as I did I saw it. It was what appeared to
be a woman, wearing nothing, and her body was rotted. She was standing
on a pile of laundry that my mom had left on the floor to wash the next
day. It appeared to be stomping on the clothes. I just looked.....my mind
a complete blank. Suddenly it looked up at me, and I saw that it had no
eyes, or teeth, just dark holes where the mouth and the eyes should be.
Its hair was matted up and standing on end, the skin was horrible and putrid
looking...then it started to motion to me to "come here" with it's rotten
arm and hand. I believe that I was beginning to lose it...when I heard
clearly, a voice say, "Roll over and pretend you are asleep!". I did that
very thing...I rolled over and laid there with my heart pounding in my
throat and my hair on my neck standing on end. Somehow I managed to fall
asleep. I never told anyone about it until I was 30 years old and talking
to the sister with whom I shared the room. She said "Oh yes, don't you
remember how our bedroom light used to come on all the time?" I told her
no. I just always wonder what would have happened if I had walked towards
it when it motioned me over to it. And what if that voice I heard tell
me to roll over and pretend I am asleep, Had not helped me out, and who's
voice was it anyway? I will never forget what it looked like. I drew a
picture of it, and it still scares me just to think of it. It turned out
that my siblings and parents also saw and heard things in the house.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Footprints in the Carpet</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Bearbruno6@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My wife and I live in Southern California, in a house we share with
my wifes</b>
<br><b>sister and mother. In 1999 we lost my mother-in-law to cancer. She
went as</b>
<br><b>peacefully as one could with that desease, here at home surrounded
by family.</b>
<br><b>With the exception of her grand daughter, who visitsfrom time to
time, no one</b>
<br><b>sleeps in the room. Yet one night my sister in law was going to
the restroom,</b>
<br><b>which by the way is connected to her mothers bedroom and you have
to go in</b>
<br><b>the room to get to it, when she noticed something on the floor.
Now bare in</b>
<br><b>mind that it had been a year since her mothers passing, and my neice
had not</b>
<br><b>come to visit for sometime, yet on the floor by the bed were footprints
in</b>
<br><b>the carpet. My sister in law, Sheila, called for me and my wife
to come and</b>
<br><b>see and verify that she was not seeing things. Sure enough, there
in the</b>
<br><b>carpet were two very defined footprints. We put our shoes next to
the prints,</b>
<br><b>taking care not to disrupt them, and none of our shoes matched.
We had a pair</b>
<br><b>of my mother in laws bedroom slippers and placed them next to the
prints and</b>
<br><b>they matched perfectly. And these slippers were kept in Sheila's
room in a</b>
<br><b>box with her mother's things. That box was taped shut. Could they
be old</b>
<br><b>prints? Maybe, but for one exception. After she passed on, we had
to put her</b>
<br><b>bed back in the room when they took the hospital bed away. The floor
had been</b>
<br><b>vaccumed before and after the bed was placed back in room. The prints
lasted</b>
<br><b>for a few weeks before they were no longer noticeable. The interesting
thing</b>
<br><b>about her room is, I get a real calm feeling when I go in there.
See there is</b>
<br><b>a sliding door that leads to the patio, and I sometimes go there
to check on</b>
<br><b>the dogs, who by the way&nbsp; can be seen sometimes looking in
the direction of</b>
<br><b>the bed and the corner where we found the prints. I was raised to
have a very</b>
<br><b>opened mind towards things that aren't easily explaned, and my mother
is a</b>
<br><b>woman of unshakeable faith and the one who taught me that just because
you</b>
<br><b>can't see it, doesn't mean it isn't so.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Ghostly Airman</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: craft@uk.pocket.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>1939-45 saw the construction of aircraft hangers at Rawcliffe near
York for the air offencive against German cities from the Clifton Moor
airfield. After the war an auto-parts manufacturer took over the hangers
to produce parts for automobiles. Workers at the plant have often seen
'the airman' a man dressed in 1940s RAF uniform walking about in the hanger
sheds. I asked one man who had been at the factory for many years what
he thought of the veracity of the reported sightings he said: "people have
seen a man walking about the sheds but the stories have become exaggerated.
Usually it's a man seen walking into a shed, when other workers go into
the shed they can't find the man anywhere". The factory has now closed
down. Elvington airfield near York also has reports of airmen in 1940s
uniforms walking alongside the runway.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Ghostly Dog</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: craft@uk.pocket.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>While visiting the picturesque medieval ruins of Kirkstall Abbey
one warm summer afternoon, I asked local folk if they knew of any psychic
occurences in the Abbeys splendid remains. The results of my questions
surprised me; ghostly monks? nuns?. No, it seems the grounds of the Abbey
are haunted by ghostly dog. The Abbey has been abondond by monks for 500
years, but local people walk their dogs amidst the ancient trees and broken
walls of the Abbey. One night a man out walking his dog was murded by robbers,
his faithfull dog barked and howled in grief next to his fallen friend.
To this day, around sunset the sounds of the barking dog can occasionaly
be heard echoeing through from amongst the massive trees surrounding the
Abbey. I suggested to one woman who had heard the dog; "surely a dog barking
at dusk could be any dog", she replied, "no, it echoes, you know it's that
dog".</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Girl in the Bathroom</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: 34rodcoupe@carlsbadnm.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm only 12 yrs. old so I hope you believe me. Okay' so here it goes.
This restaurant that's called the Fire House has been opened a year and
a half where I live. A few people say it's haunted in one of the bathrooms
( I think it's in the girls bathroom, cause my cousin Tina works there
and she's told me when she's in there all alone, she hears creepy stuff).
So the other night my family and I went out to eat, and ended up eating
there. My cousin was working there that night and she walked up to us to
say hi and stuff. She knows I'm all in to hauntings, ghosts, and this website,
so she told me if I went to the bathroom, to watch out for the ghost. She
was just joking or so I thought. Later on I needed to go to the bathroom
so I did. When I got out, I went to go wash my hands (and let me tell you
I was the only one in the bathroom, and if someone walked in I would've
heard them). When I was done, I was drying my hands and then I glanced
in the mirror and gasped when I saw this little girl staring strate at
me. I turned around and she was still there staring. My heart just dropped.
She had realy white-blonde hair and was wearing a dress. I know for a fact
that she wasn't waiting for anybody, cause I was the only one in there
before I saw her. I also know for a fact that if that little girl walked
in I would've heard her walked in, cause when you open those doors to the
bathroom their very noisy, even if you open them quietly, they still make
a noise. But when I was walking out the door that little girl even looked
back to watch me go. The people who say that the bathroom is haunted in
that restaurant, they also say people see a little girl, thats why they
say it's haunted. When we left the restaurant my cousin was setting up
a table. We said bye to her and I told her that she wasn't joking about
the ghost, she saw the serious look on my face and knew I wasn't joking.
I hope you believe me, cause I've read almost every single story on this
website and I believe every single one of them.</b>

<p><b>The Grandfathers</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Baybgurl00@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I'll never forget the first time that I had an experience with a
ghost.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>first experience was in Brooklyn, NY.&nbsp; I had to have been about
4 or 5 yrs</b>
<br><b>old when my maternal grandfather died from diabetes.&nbsp; I really
didn't</b>
<br><b>understand what dying was so I thought that he would be back, that
he was</b>
<br><b>going on a trip.&nbsp; Needless to say, that wasn't the case and
I never got to</b>
<br><b>really say good-bye.&nbsp; It had to be around 3 days after he died,
me, my Mom</b>
<br><b>and my sister who was 2 yrs old at the time, were coming back from
my</b>
<br><b>grandmothers house and I saw my grandfather who died just a few
days before</b>
<br><b>sitting on our front steps, with a big smile on his face waving
to me.&nbsp; I, of</b>
<br><b>course, got really excited and began waving.&nbsp; My mother looked
at me and</b>
<br><b>said, "Who are you waving to?" and I began screaming, "Papa!&nbsp;
Papa!"&nbsp; I ran</b>
<br><b>to my house to give him a hug, and when I got there, he was gone
and I wanted</b>
<br><b>to cry.&nbsp; My Mom looked at me like I had 10 heads and she said
that papa was</b>
<br><b>dead.&nbsp; All I could do was say, "But I saw him.&nbsp; He was
sitting right here!!"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;After about 5 times of saying that, my Mom say how serious
I was, she became</b>
<br><b>teary eyed, and said that it was his way of saying good-bye to me.</b>
<br><b>Another time was when I was in the 6th grade, my paternal grandfather
had</b>
<br><b>died from lung cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp; when about 2 yrs. after,&nbsp;
we were in Toms River, New</b>
<br><b>Jersey and&nbsp; my parents, my grandmother and her friend had gone
food shopping</b>
<br><b>and they were gone for a while.&nbsp; Me and my sister were the
only ones in the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; Now for some reason, each door makes its own should
so I know the</b>
<br><b>difference between the front and garage door coming in to the house.&nbsp;
So it</b>
<br><b>had to have been 1:30pm, and my parents were gone for almost an
hour and a</b>
<br><b>half, when I hear the front door open and close.&nbsp; Now my sister
is in a room</b>
<br><b>that has a lil rec room and the kitchen connected together.&nbsp;
I think that its</b>
<br><b>my parents and grandmother back from shopping so I got to help.&nbsp;
I get into</b>
<br><b>the living room and no one is there.&nbsp; I go to where the garage
door is and</b>
<br><b>nothing.&nbsp; I look at my sister and asked her if she went out
side or opened</b>
<br><b>the front door.&nbsp; She looked at me like I was crazy and said
no.&nbsp; Now normally</b>
<br><b>I would say ok I'm hearing things but it happened again, about 5
minutes</b>
<br><b>after the first time.&nbsp; My parents didn't come back until about
2pm.&nbsp; After my</b>
<br><b>heart stopped racing, I figured that it was my grandfather making
sure that</b>
<br><b>me and my sister were ok.</b>
<br><b>Still in Toms River, New Jersey but at another time I saw a ghost
was about 4</b>
<br><b>months ago, I was staying at my grandmothers house for Easter weekend
with my</b>
<br><b>family, and me and my sister were sleeping in my grandmothers room.&nbsp;
It had</b>
<br><b>to have been around 12 in the morning, I wasn't tired so I turned
on the TV.</b>
<br><b>That's when I saw it.&nbsp; I didn't feel cold but I did feel as
if someone were</b>
<br><b>in the room watching me.&nbsp; I sat up but didn't see anything.&nbsp;
So I laid back</b>
<br><b>down and go that feeling again.&nbsp; My grandfather has been dead
since I was 11</b>
<br><b>yrs old, at the time this happened I was 19 yrs. old and I saw him
walk by</b>
<br><b>the side of the bed my sister was sleeping on.&nbsp; I jumped up,
looked around</b>
<br><b>the room and saw nothing.&nbsp; I thought that I was seeing things
but I saw him</b>
<br><b>do the same thing again.&nbsp; This time I was freaked so I sat
up and turned on</b>
<br><b>the lights.&nbsp; Now its about 12:30am and I hear the front door
open and close,</b>
<br><b>I hear footsteps walk thought the living room and I hear my grandmothers
dog</b>
<br><b>walking across the kitchen floor.&nbsp; I should also tell you that
the dog was</b>
<br><b>put to sleep when I was 13 yrs old.&nbsp; Then it became quiet.&nbsp;
My sister woke up</b>
<br><b>about 15 minutes later to use the bathroom.&nbsp; About 5 minutes
later, she comes</b>
<br><b>running in the bedroom, jumps in the bed and pulls the cover over
her head.</b>
<br><b>She tells me later on that day that she heard the same thing I did
15 min</b>
<br><b>before she woke up.</b>
<br><b>Brooklyn, NY - My uncle died in March of last year.&nbsp; It was
really hard to</b>
<br><b>deal w. bc he was only in his early 60's, plus his youngest son
was getting</b>
<br><b>married in less then 3 months.&nbsp; Even though he has been dead
for a little</b>
<br><b>over a year, lately it feels like he's in my house.&nbsp; The first
person to see</b>
<br><b>him in the house was my sister.&nbsp; She was sitting on the couch
and I was</b>
<br><b>sitting on the love seat w/ my boyfriend at the time.&nbsp; She
kept jerking her</b>
<br><b>head toward the bathroom.&nbsp; After the third time that she did
that I said,</b>
<br><b>"Ok, what do you see?"&nbsp; Her face went white and she said, "Uncle
Junior".&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>thought nothing of it bc&nbsp; I was use to hearing stuff like that
but she looked</b>
<br><b>scared out of her mind.&nbsp; I told her not to worry, that he wouldn't
hurt any</b>
<br><b>of us.&nbsp; Now my boyfriend at the time, seemed a little edgy.&nbsp;
I told him to</b>
<br><b>relax that nothing would happen.&nbsp; About 2 months ago, I would
see something</b>
<br><b>walk back and forth in my hallway.&nbsp; When I would go to look
I of course saw</b>
<br><b>nothing.&nbsp; I would see something by my front door looking from
behind one of</b>
<br><b>the walls; I would look in that direction, again I see nothing.&nbsp;
I would see</b>
<br><b>something stand by the bathroom, a white figure, from the corner
of my eye</b>
<br><b>but when I would look at that direction nothing.</b>
<br><b>Now these last 2 stories don't have anything to do with my grandfathers
but I</b>
<br><b>thought that they were a little weird.&nbsp; About 1 yr. ago, my
family and I were</b>
<br><b>at my aunts house in Toms River, New Jersey for my cousins graduation
party.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;It was about 3pm and I was out front watching my cousins and
my sister goof</b>
<br><b>around.&nbsp; Then my aunt called my 11 yr. old cousin into the
house for</b>
<br><b>something, and when she opened the screen door to go in I saw a
pale little</b>
<br><b>boy standing in the middle of the floor.&nbsp; I got up from where
I was sitting</b>
<br><b>and walked toward the door.&nbsp; As I go to step in the house,
the lil boy smiled</b>
<br><b>and waved at me, then disappeared.</b>
<br><b>That following winter, I was hanging out w. a friend of mine in
Brooklyn, NY</b>
<br><b>and she wanted to stop and see her other friend who was really sick.&nbsp;
So we</b>
<br><b>go to her house and she's standing by her door talking to my friend.&nbsp;
Out of</b>
<br><b>nowhere, I see this muscular guy very slowly walk from one end of
the house</b>
<br><b>to the other.&nbsp; It was a very dark gray figure, no face, almost
transparent</b>
<br><b>but not quite.&nbsp; I asked the girl if anyone was in the house
and she said her</b>
<br><b>mom and sister.&nbsp; Then I asked her if there were any guys in
the house and she</b>
<br><b>said no.&nbsp; She asked me why and I told her I&nbsp; saw a dark
figure&nbsp; walk around</b>
<br><b>in the house and that it had the body of a really big guy.&nbsp;
The funny thing</b>
<br><b>is, after I told her what I saw, she didn't seem all that surprised.</b>
<br><b>Most of my experiences have never really had any "cold spots".&nbsp;
Just the</b>
<br><b>feeling of something/someone watching me, and a lot of unexplained
noises,</b>
<br><b>seeing something but then it being gone.&nbsp; I use to think that
ghosts were</b>
<br><b>just a bunch of crap but that was until I had my own experience.&nbsp;
So for</b>
<br><b>those who say that ghosts aren't really or think that it's just
all in your</b>
<br><b>head..........just wait until it happens to you.&nbsp; Then you'll
believe.</b>

<p><b>The Haunt in the House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: BillyJudyLovett@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in Arkansas. And I think I may have a ghost</b>
<br><b>story for you.</b>
<br><b>Two years ago My husband and I bought a house that we later learned
has some</b>
<br><b>of a history to it.</b>
<br><b>The house was built in 1977 the first owners wife died here from
a tick bite.</b>
<br><b>On the day they were moving out his 13 year old son fail off the
back of the</b>
<br><b>truck and died from head injury.</b>
<br><b>The second owner moved in and took a friend in that was sick and
he died</b>
<br><b>here, and from what I am told his ashes are in my front flower bed.</b>
<br><b>The third owners moved in and did not even live here a month when
she left</b>
<br><b>her husband he followed her shot her then shot himself.</b>
<br><b>>From the moment we started looking at the house I could feel a
strange</b>
<br><b>present, but just thought it was me for moving into a strange place
but soon</b>
<br><b>things begin to happen chairs would be moved, things came up missing,
doors</b>
<br><b>would slam shut, and you would be sitting or in bed and you could
feel the</b>
<br><b>bed move as if someone had just sat beside you. This has happened
many times.</b>
<br><b>I truly did not know what to think about it until Mother's Day of
this year</b>
<br><b>when the second owners daughter came to visit and wanted to know
if she could</b>
<br><b>look around. Her mother had died last February and loved the place
so much</b>
<br><b>and she just needed to feel close to her.( I had never meet her
until that</b>
<br><b>day).</b>
<br><b>We told her sure and has I was showing her the house I turn to her
and said</b>
<br><b>"You know the placed is haunted?" She said "Yes, we wondered if
you knew."</b>
<br><b>She ask me if thing move or come up missing and I told her "Yes
all the</b>
<br><b>time." And she stated telling me what she knew.</b>
<br><b>She told me about the little boy and wondered if I had ever seen
him, she</b>
<br><b>says he comes to the window and taps. I have never seen him but
one night I</b>
<br><b>woke up and did see a man standing in my door way, when no one else
was here</b>
<br><b>but me.</b>
<br><b>She told me there were three sprits here but they were good sprits.</b>
<br><b>Every since she was here more has started to happen drawers open,
my water</b>
<br><b>glass was stirred I could her it and when I turned to see nothing
was there.</b>
<br><b>My lighter was missing and with in an hour it showed up right where
I had</b>
<br><b>left it.</b>
<br><b>I feel like a crazy women even thinking these thought, or even talking
about</b>
<br><b>it. But I must say others who have come to visit have heard things
and some</b>
<br><b>have felt things.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I was told they were good sprits and they mean no harm, and
I don't care if</b>
<br><b>they want to stay but I just don't want to know about it.</b>
<br><b>And I would like to see them go to their resting place. It sadden
me to think</b>
<br><b>of a child lost or any one.</b>
<br><b>I truly believe my home is haunted, and it does worry me some of
all the</b>
<br><b>death that have occurred here, that maybe it's an Omen.</b>
<br><b>Are there such things?</b>
<br><b>There is truly so much more but I think you understand.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Haunted Motel</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Andrea</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Everyone has feelings like they are being watched at</b>
<br><b>one time or another.&nbsp; I've had those in high school</b>
<br><b>when I was alone in the hallways, and there were</b>
<br><b>stories about my school being haunted.&nbsp; I also had</b>
<br><b>those experiences with my first job.</b>
<br><b>As my first job, I worked for a popular motel chain as</b>
<br><b>a housekeeper.&nbsp; I had the job for four months.&nbsp; Our</b>
<br><b>motel had three floors and over 60 rooms.&nbsp; And it was</b>
<br><b>haunted, which was strange considering that the motel</b>
<br><b>was only five years old--fairly new.&nbsp; Ever since I had</b>
<br><b>started working there, the second floor hallway had</b>
<br><b>scared me.&nbsp; The hallways in that motel were long and</b>
<br><b>did not curve or turn.&nbsp; I could see from one end of</b>
<br><b>the floor to other with nothing to block my view.&nbsp; And</b>
<br><b>whenever I was in the hallway, I felt like I was being</b>
<br><b>watched by something, and I always knew when I was</b>
<br><b>alone on the floor.&nbsp; I alkways felt okay in the rooms,</b>
<br><b>but it was the hall that scared me.&nbsp; It wasn't until a</b>
<br><b>few weeks later that I found out I wasn't the only one</b>
<br><b>who felt that way.&nbsp; All the housekeepers did.&nbsp; As far</b>
<br><b>as I know, no one ever saw anything, but we all felt</b>
<br><b>the same on the second floor.&nbsp; As a result, no one</b>
<br><b>spent much time in the hall.</b>
<br><b>A couple of weeks after my friend and I started</b>
<br><b>working there, she and I were working together on the</b>
<br><b>second floor.&nbsp; I was making a bed when she walked into</b>
<br><b>the room and asked if I was talking to myself.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>answered no and asked why.&nbsp; She told me that she had</b>
<br><b>been walking down the hallway when she heard someone</b>
<br><b>whisper her name.&nbsp; She looked around, but saw no one,</b>
<br><b>but she knows what she heard.</b>
<br><b>She got another job shortly after that, and it wasn't</b>
<br><b>until a few days after she quit that I found out she</b>
<br><b>and I weren't the only housekeepers who'd felt watched</b>
<br><b>or scared.&nbsp; One of the other housekeepers asked me if</b>
<br><b>anyone had ever died there.&nbsp; To my knowledge, no, and</b>
<br><b>I had lived a mile and half away from the motel since</b>
<br><b>it had been built.&nbsp; But she felt the way that I did,</b>
<br><b>watched in the second floor hallway.&nbsp; And her cousin</b>
<br><b>did too.</b>
<br><b>Eventually, we got used to the idea that the motel had</b>
<br><b>more than guests and workers in it, but you wouldn't</b>
<br><b>find us with our backs to the ends of the second floor</b>
<br><b>hall.&nbsp; We knew nothing would happen, but it was the</b>
<br><b>thought of something there that we couldn't see that</b>
<br><b>scared us.</b>
<br><b>A couple of months later, I was working on the first</b>
<br><b>floor, just a matter of feet from the front desk.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was standing at my housekeeping cart looking at my</b>
<br><b>list of rooms to do, when I got that creepy eerie</b>
<br><b>chill like I wasn't alone.&nbsp; I looked both directions,</b>
<br><b>but again there was no one.&nbsp; I could hear the TV in</b>
<br><b>the lobby, but other than that there were no sounds,</b>
<br><b>and no people.&nbsp; The direction I got the feeling from</b>
<br><b>was the second floor stairwell, way at the other end</b>
<br><b>of the hall.&nbsp; I fled into the room I was cleaning and</b>
<br><b>that was the last of my experiences with the motel</b>
<br><b>ghost.</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>my friend aaron was telling me about weird happenings in the shed
behind his</b>
<br><b>house. the shed is a very large building aaron's dad used to build
furniture</b>
<br><b>in. his dad died about 7 years ago of cancer. the shed is being
used for</b>
<br><b>storage right now by aaron's uncle. he keeps it locked. he told
us that when</b>
<br><b>he goes in there boxes will be moved and sometimes even the concrete
floor</b>
<br><b>would be cleaned. in february 2001 we went in the shed and decided
to look</b>
<br><b>around. i had my video camera and aaron had his 35mm. camera. we
had 2 other</b>
<br><b>friends with us: justin and drue. aaron lead us in. it was the first
time he</b>
<br><b>had been in there for 7 years. i followed behind and i kept feeling
like</b>
<br><b>something was following me and watching me. we walked further and
i noticed</b>
<br><b>what appeared like a ball of smoke or fog floating in the air between&nbsp;
aaron</b>
<br><b>and justin. i told them and as they turned to look at it it vanished.
we</b>
<br><b>walked further and found a block wall with what appeared to be writing
in</b>
<br><b>blood on it it said "quik x" on it and the rest at the bottom was
splattered.</b>
<br><b>we were studying the wall when a large shadow appeared on the wall
beside</b>
<br><b>drue's shadow and disappeared. we then took a picture of the wall
and after</b>
<br><b>the flash went off a shadow appeared on the wall of what appeared
to be a man</b>
<br><b>with a knife in his head and then vanished. we took more pictures
and we got</b>
<br><b>some strange "dark figures" on film one of them appeared to be a
head with</b>
<br><b>devil horns on it. i&nbsp; don't know if this was a demon or something
else. we</b>
<br><b>left the shed and havent been back since. aaron's uncle said that
many more</b>
<br><b>strange things have happened lately. he said he went in there and
the wall</b>
<br><b>had started to be cleaned off. he also that some more boxes have
been move</b>
<br><b>and rubber marks from the fork lift tires have been cleaned off
the floor. a</b>

<br><b>The Leprecan</b><b></b>

<p><b>Hi.&nbsp; My name's Theresa.&nbsp; I was reading one of the stories
on your website</b>
<br><b>about a leprecan and was so surprised that someone had actually
SEEN one</b>
<br><b>other than myself.&nbsp; So I TOTALLY believe that story.&nbsp;
But when I encountered</b>
<br><b>a leprecan, it was some what different.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's how it all started...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever since I was younger, I always thought that
there was something in my</b>
<br><b>basement.&nbsp; But nobody believed me when I told them that it
was a leprecan.</b>
<br><b>Then one day I had to get something from the basement with one of
my friends.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I told her to be careful when we went down because SOMETHING
was down there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;We were halfway down the stairs when I looked in one of the
corners of the</b>
<br><b>basement and saw an ugly little face staring at me.&nbsp; i screamed
and dragged</b>
<br><b>my friend up the stairs.&nbsp; I told her what I saw and she said
that she saw it</b>
<br><b>too.&nbsp; When we settled down a bit we decided to go back down.&nbsp;
when we were</b>
<br><b>halfway down, again we saw the face but this time it had its mouth
wide open.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Let me tell ya, it was an UGLY mouth with BIG teeth.&nbsp;
That was scary enough.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;About a year later, I had to get something from the basement
stairs...I did</b>
<br><b>NOT want to, but I went down anyway.&nbsp; When I was halfway down,
I heard little</b>
<br><b>feet skipping up to the stairs, then I heard soft gigling coming
closer and</b>
<br><b>closer to me.&nbsp; I ran up the stairs and slammed the door shut!&nbsp;
something had</b>
<br><b>to be done.&nbsp; So I told&nbsp; my friend who know's what to do
in situations like</b>
<br><b>these.&nbsp; She got it out of the basement, and out of my life!&nbsp;
YES!&nbsp; That was</b>

<p><b>The Most Recent Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ravensgrin@galatinriver.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am Jim Warfield, I own the Ravens Grin Inn, a "haunted house" that's
open for tours all year long. (hauntedravensgrin.com)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;15 years ago I thought that this house would make a perfect
house for my haunted house business that I wished to start, now I'm sure
that some people think that I'm a pretty "lazy" guy, that I knowingly bought
a house that's already haunted!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The first two weeks of ownership brought a crowd of former
tenets down here to tell me about their scary experiences they had suffered
with when trying to live here!</b>
<br><b>I eventually found out that a "Lady-In-white" had been seen in the
wine cellar ever since at least 1925. At first when some of my customers
would ask me, "How do you do that special effect?" I thought that they
were just lying trying to get me excited, then one day it dawned on me,
there was no way that all of these people could all be conspiring to get
their stories straight, because the descriptions and location were always
the same!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Seven years ago I met the wonderful little woman who would
then become my wife, she's a very sensitive person, she was always uneasy
here. We very recently were divorced, something that was very heartbreaking
for both of us. She just couldn't stay here anymore, "they" seemed to be
picking on her.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;She experienced all of the supernatural things that other
people have had happen to them here , plus a few more "personal" ones.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Last September she was down in the most haunted room of this
house , the wine cellar(she's always hated this room)she went down there
all on her own, I didn't even know that she was there, she was trying to
help me, we were very busy at the time.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;"Something" pulled her hair, three times , straight up off
of her head!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The ceiling in the wine cellar is 16 feet high, nothing simply
caught any of her hair! this incident was explained to me three weeks ago
by a strange man I met here who called himself a "Warlock-Psychic", he's
from a long way away from here(Missouri) he told me things about this house(that
I know to be true) that he shouldn't have been able to know!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; With the departure of my wife, the ghost of the-"Lady-In-White"
seems to have become more frequent and her "territory" somewhat expanded
here within the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Five nights ago I was leading a group through here when a
very frightening experience befell one of the young women .</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;None of them had ever been here before, we were upstairs in
the third room , I was facing them all, talking, when a very definate "Thud"
happened right in the next room. After 15 years here, I know the noises
of this house very well, I thought someone was sneaking around in here.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I went into that room , no one was there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I returned and proceeded with my "normal" routine which requires
a volunteer that leaves the room with me, we left, the "show" continued.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Next we all enter the room that the "Thud" eminated from earlier,
as we walk in, a young woman (20? Ms. "R") asks me, "So who's your helper?"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I give her a blank look?</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Who was that woman that was waiting for you when you went
into this room alone? Is she your wife?"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;"There was NO woman in this room!"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Now all of the others in her group all say in unison, "There
was NO Woman in here!"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;"Stop it! You are all just saying that you didn't see her,
just trying to scare me , you all saw her, she was as real as any of you
look , right now!" (she was to spend alot of her efforts over the course
of the next hour pleading with her friends to tell her the "truth" and
admit that they HAD seen a woman in the room,but they hadn't, she was trying
to talk herself out of having seen this as they were getting in the car
to leave, because the thought and the strange fear she now had didn't set
well with her mind and emotions, "I dont want to be this afraid and try
to go to sleep like this tonight, maybe I really didn't see her?" she didn't
sound as if she was going to convince herself when I last saw her)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;"So can you describe this woman ?"I asked.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;"You know what she looks like, she has on a white dress, and
she has straight black hair!"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;"you have just described "The-Lady-In-White" who has been
seen here ever since 1925.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;"She was standing right between you two guys when you were
in this room!"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;"There was NO WOMAN standing between us!" Her friend emphatically
said.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;There remains much more to this event to tell, but right now
I have to open for the tour-business of the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;(None of this is fiction)</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MYSTEROUS MAN IN THE DOORWAY</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hockey_queen99@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Well it all started when I was little. At least 3. When I
lay in bed I used to see a man in my doorway. He was transparant. He was
a skeleton and wore farmer clothes. I told my older sister Emily who I
shared a room with. She said she saw him too.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Well I never told anyone about him. When I had my best friend
Sara to sleep over she told me that there was a dead farmer in my doorway.
I confessed about how I saw him too.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;When I was about 7 I had my close friend Alicia over. She
said that there was a skeleton in my doorway. I told her.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Up to this day I still see him. He looks at me and smiles.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Well last year I read an article on Hamilton MOuntain &amp;
it said that where my house was built there used to be a farm that belonged
to a family called Inch.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I almost choked!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The man did look like a farmer. (with his clothes)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I had Sara over a month ago and she woke me up in the middle
of the night. She pointed to the doorway and there was the man. I was freaked.
Sara ran and turned on the lights. We saw a almost milky thing slither
down the stairs. (outside my door)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Well I've never really been able to identify that man but
I'm pretty sure he's Adam Inch. I moved into a new room last week so I
can't see him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;That's my story.</b>

<br><b>a brick wall in the garden.&nbsp; However when me and my family
moved into the</b>
<br><b>house we experienced more than cats.&nbsp; For example at night
my mum and dad</b>
<br><b>heard the clattering of pots and pans in the kitchen accompanied
by the</b>

came upstairs to</b>
<br><b>see me sitting bolt up right in bed and saying that the old man

<p><b>The Phantom of Princess Pass</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: LSamaniego@ci.sat.tx.us</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Polo, my grandfather
was working at Alamo cement at the time in</b>
<br><b>the mid twenties. During that period the cement plant was out near
the</b>
<br><b>cities edge. Polo got up to go to work one morning only to find
that the</b>
<br><b>weather was not very good.&nbsp; It was raining and very dark, especially
early</b>
<br><b>in the morning as he was getting up. He took the trolley car to
work as his</b>
<br><b>method of transportation, so he was out the door and on his way
to the stop</b>
<br><b>before the sun was up.</b>
<br><b>The place where he usually waited for the car to come was on a street
called</b>
<br><b>Princess Pass. It was a very large and very old oak tree, so wide
that it</b>
<br><b>would take three men hand to hand to go around the massive trunk.
It was in</b>
<br><b>an old neighborhood with a lot of old homes in the area.&nbsp; He
was the first</b>
<br><b>one to catch the trolley in the area , so he didn't expect to have
any</b>
<br><b>company as he waited for the car to arrive. As he approached the
Tree where</b>
<br><b>he hoped to get out of the rain, in a flash of lightning he thought
he saw</b>
<br><b>someone standing there. For some reason it made him a little uneasy
and he</b>
<br><b>pulled his rain coat a little tighter around his body.</b>
<br><b>The foilage of the tree seemed to engulf him as it hung low, laden
with</b>
<br><b>water. For a few moment he had forgotten the stranger on the other
side of</b>
<br><b>the tree, then he noticed him out of the corner of his eye. The
stranger had</b>
<br><b>come out from behind the tree and stood facing Polo.&nbsp; He didn't
think</b>
<br><b>anything of this stranger until it seemed that this person was edging
closer</b>
<br><b>and closer to him. Polo attempted to ignore this person and hoped
that he</b>
<br><b>would go away, but still the stranger came closer. When Polo felt
a twig</b>
<br><b>crunch directly behind him, he had had enough and twirled around,
ready to</b>
<br><b>fight. Instead of staring into the face of the stranger, Polo was
looking</b>
<br><b>into pitch blackness where a face should've been. Polo was terrified.
He</b>
<br><b>blinked and tried to clear his vision, all the while the stranger
kept</b>
<br><b>coming closer. Polo backed away as quickly as he could and was tripped
by</b>
<br><b>the sprawling roots of the great oak. He scrambled&nbsp; and scraped
as fast as</b>
<br><b>he could when he finally reached his feet he ran as he had never
run before.</b>
<br><b>When he finally had the courage to turn around and look behind him
there was</b>
<br><b>nothing at the tree. No body and no one around for blocks. Who this
was, or</b>
<br><b>what this was, we'll never know for sure.</b>

<br><b>The Spirit or Spirits at my Grandmother's House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JacksAngel19@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am a 15 yearold teenager living in Omaha, Nebraska. I have had
weird things</b>
<br><b>happen to me that I can't explain. A lot of them happen over at
my grandma's</b>
<br><b>house. I always feel cold in the house. I feel ...... i can't really
explain</b>
<br><b>the way that I feel when I'm over there. I just feel like something
isn't</b>
<br><b>normal or right. When I was little, I remember that I was always
afraid of</b>
<br><b>the house. I never wanted to be alone. I loved going in the basement
because</b>
<br><b>it was like another house. I loved it, but I hated it. I remember
being a</b>
<br><b>young girl going in the basement in the kitchen to get a pop (alone)
and I</b>
<br><b>would feel like I wasn't alone, like someone else was down there
with me. So</b>
<br><b>I would run up the long stairs to get back to people. I remember
that when I</b>
<br><b>would run up the stairs, it felt like it took so long and I always
could hear</b>
<br><b>someone breathing behind me or running after me. More things have
happened to</b>
<br><b>me. More recent things. I have seen like a cloudy or misty thing
floating by</b>
<br><b>the fireplace at my grandparent's house. Then it would go away.
I also was</b>
<br><b>sitting on the bottom steps with my cousin waiting for something
weird to</b>
<br><b>happen. The lights flickered above our heads, which might have been
the</b>
<br><b>"ghost" or it probably wasn't. I lived at my grandparent's house
for one</b>
<br><b>summer and I lived in the basement in a small room with a lot of
antiques. My</b>
<br><b>grandma is an antique collector. She has a lot of old things. I'm
beginning</b>
<br><b>to think that maybe spirits are attached to these objects and they
don't want</b>
<br><b>to leave them. I slept on a really old bed and next to the bed was
a very old</b>
<br><b>baby bed. It might have been for a real baby or for a baby doll.
I always</b>
<br><b>feel like something is watching me in that house. When I was on
the steps</b>
<br><b>with my cousin, I was looking in my old room. I saw something start
to form</b>
<br><b>by the bed. To me, it looked as it was partly "in the bed" like
part of the</b>
<br><b>mist was in the bed and part of it was by it. It's hard to explain.
My</b>
<br><b>grandma told me that the house was haunted just recently. The woman
that</b>
<br><b>lived there before told her that. I have this weird dream that I
remember. It</b>
<br><b>occurs at my granma's house. Right in front of the doorway to my
bedroom was</b>
<br><b>an old man. He was really freaky looking. He was really pale, his
hair was</b>
<br><b>sticking up all over, he had white hair and white EYES!!! It was
really</b>
<br><b>weird. My friends always never want to be alone when they go over
there. I</b>
<br><b>have had to go inside the bathroom while they went!!! I try to tell
my</b>
<br><b>parents about everything, and they hate it when I tell them. I feel
as though</b>
<br><b>they don't beleive me. I wish they could see what I see and I wish
they could</b>
<br><b>feel what I feel. I hate it that they don't believe me. I really
like the</b>
<br><b>paranormal. It's interesting. I watch shows about it. My parents
always tell</b>
<br><b>me to change it because "it's just a bunch of bull". Am I weird
because I am</b>
<br><b>the only one that believes in this stuff? I know what I see is real.
That's</b>
<br><b>enough for me. But, I wish my parents would believe me. More things
have</b>
<br><b>happened in my new house that we just built. Can spirits follow
you?</b><b></b>

<br><b>The True Story of :The Haunted Gambling House</b><b></b>

<p><b>Hello, my name is Zola Lee.I am about to tell the story of a two
story</b>
<br><b>gambling house,that my mother lived in as a child.This gambling
house was</b>
<br><b>so haunted that ,my grandmother and the children sat on the front
porch</b>
<br><b>and waited each day for my grandfather to come in from work.Inside
the</b>
<br><b>kitchen,you could hear dishe's being smashed,and my mother said
it</b>
<br><b>sounded as if everything in the cabinet's was falling out.When my</b>
<br><b>grandfather came home,and they entered the house,nothing had been</b>
<br><b>disturbed.They heard chain's rattle,footstep's running on</b>
<br><b>stairway's,argument's between people.There was one room if you put
a lock</b>
<br><b>of any kind on it&nbsp; ,it would be lying on the floor the next
morning.My</b>
<br><b>mother and my aunt was sleeping in the bed in one of the room's
,in this</b>
<br><b>huge house,the bed cover's would slowly be pulled from you,and go
to the</b>
<br><b>corner of the bed.My uncle Herbert Sizemore,came home one night,drunk,and</b>
<br><b>went to hang his hat in the closet(my mother found this humorous)and</b>
<br><b>"something"grabbed him around the neck.My uncle&nbsp; died in a
horrible</b>
<br><b>accident in Massassachusett's.One night my grandmother came to my
mother</b>
<br><b>and said"Ollie,Mommy want's you to sleep with her tonight,she has</b>
<br><b>something she want's to show you".My mother was excited,because
my</b>
<br><b>grandmother was a big woman,and she loved sleeping with her.She
went to</b>
<br><b>bed,and during the night,she felt my grandmother gently nudge her
and say</b>
<br><b>"Ollie,wake up,look at the big dog!"My mother said a white German</b>
<br><b>shephard came up between the two bed's.My mother said "Mommy,what
a</b>
<br><b>pretty dog!"My grandmother said "Ollie,reach out and touch him".She</b>
<br><b>did,her hand went straight through him.The dog would appear every
night</b>
<br><b>and he was looking as if he were protecting someone.He would come
up</b>
<br><b>between the bed's,and walk out of the room&nbsp; and&nbsp; disappear
down the</b>
<br><b>hall.There was one room,with such a bad feeling,you could not be
in it a</b>
<br><b>minute,you had to get out of it.The house ,you see,there had been</b>
<br><b>murder's and God only know's what going on.I guess you could say</b>
<br><b>gambling,prostitution.The house was located in Hazard,Kentucky.It
was too</b>
<br><b>haunted for my mother's family to live in.They moved out,the townspeople</b>
<br><b>promptly burned it down.I wish they hadn't done that.Because I have
heard</b>
<br><b>some haunting's in my life,but I think we could've learned so much
from</b>
<br><b>that house.If record's are checked in or around Hazard,this burning
down</b>
<br><b>would probably be verified.I hope you enjoyed my family's haunted</b>

<p><b>The Unwanted Spirit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: caroline_braeken@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>One night my friend Jennie and I were sleeping on the couch of her
aunt's</b>
<br><b>old house. We were snuggled up under the covers when I heard someone</b>
<br><b>coughing. At first I thought it was Jennie and she thought it was
me, but it</b>
<br><b>was niether one of us. We weren't really scared and just kept on
watching</b>
<br><b>the movie on tv, not thinking about the coughing. About 30min. later
we</b>
<br><b>heard footsteps in the hallway. We were starting to get a little
more</b>
<br><b>freaked out and there was no way it could have been her parents,
older</b>
<br><b>sister, or aunt and uncle becasue they were all out. We snuggled
in deeper</b>
<br><b>under the covers and turned up the volume of the tv. For a while
we didn't</b>
<br><b>hear anything, but then the footsteps apeared again and they seemed
to get</b>
<br><b>closer and closer to us. We sat still and held in our breaths hoping
that it</b>
<br><b>wouldn't hear us. Then the footsteps stopped and turned the other
way. They</b>
<br><b>were headed towards the stairs and slowly went up. Then the footsteps
died</b>
<br><b>down and we didn't hear anything anymore. We fell asleep later that
night</b>
<br><b>and didn't wake up until 8 the next morning. We decided to have
some</b>
<br><b>breakfast and went into the kitchen. We found that everything had
been moved</b>
<br><b>from it's original position. The forks were 2 drawers away from
where they</b>
<br><b>were supposed to be. Pots and pans were hanging from the wrong racks.
It</b>
<br><b>seemed like someone had rearranged everything. Jennie asked her
parents,</b>
<br><b>aunt and uncle and older sister if they done it, but they all said
it wasn't</b>
<br><b>them. This was getting wierder and wierder. We made breakfast and
then</b>
<br><b>Jennie went upstairs to take a shower and get dressed. I was sitting
in her</b>
<br><b>room reading magazines, waiting for her to get done so that I could
go take</b>
<br><b>a shower. All of a sudden I vagley saw a shaddow pass by out of
the corner</b>
<br><b>of my eye. I looked up but no one was there. I went back to reading
the</b>
<br><b>magazine and ignored what i had seen. I could hear the water running
from</b>
<br><b>the shower because the bathroom was right next to the bedroom and
I knew</b>
<br><b>that Jennie wans't done with her shower yet after 5 minutes, but
all of a</b>
<br><b>sudden the water turned off. Jennie tried to turn it on again but
it</b>
<br><b>wouldn't work. She started calling out to me for help and I ran
to the</b>
<br><b>bathroom door and called in and asked if she was ok. She said that
she</b>
<br><b>couldn't turn on the water anymore. It wasn't a water shortage becasue
her</b>
<br><b>mother was useing water in the kitchen downstaris. I ran down and
told</b>
<br><b>everyone that the water wasn't working anymore. Jennie's dad and
uncle came</b>
<br><b>up to see what was wrong with the shower. But by the time they got
up there</b>
<br><b>it was working but the water was all yellow. I went back to the
room and</b>
<br><b>kept on reading. When Jennie was done taking a shower, she started</b>
<br><b>screaming. I ran to the bathroom and went in. Jennie was standing
there with</b>
<br><b>her bathrobe on, staring wide eyed at the sink. I looked down and
saw a red</b>
<br><b>liquid pouring, presumibly blood, down the drain. Everybody was
outside in</b>
<br><b>garden chatting and lazing about. Jennie and I just stayed silent.
The blood</b>
<br><b>was dripping for only a few seconds and then it disappeared without
a trace,</b>
<br><b>and we both knew that it wasn't there before and it wasn't from
Jennie. We</b>
<br><b>haven't spoken about it to anybody since.</b>

<p><b>The White Rooster</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LSamaniego@ci.sat.tx.us</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some cultures believe that when a soul is
preparing to depart this</b>
<br><b>earth, guides are sent from the other side to help the dying person
make the</b>
<br><b>transition. I often think about this when I remember a series of
incidents</b>
<br><b>that happened right before my grandfather became ill.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; It had already been quite a few years since my grandmother
Grace died of</b>
<br><b>cancer in 1973. Every morning since her death, my father, Lupe would
take</b>
<br><b>Tata breakfast and lunch and check on his well being.&nbsp; One
morning Dad</b>
<br><b>walked in and found Tata sitting at the table with his cane in his
hand,</b>
<br><b>visibly shaken.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " Get that damn thing out of here, "</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There, sitting in the corner of the
kitchen, was a very large and very</b>
<br><b>white Leghorn rooster. He was very calmly watching everything both
men did</b>
<br><b>to try and shoo him out of the house. It took my father a broom
and a lot of</b>
<br><b>noise to get the animal to leave.&nbsp; After he got the rooster
outside, Dad</b>
<br><b>shut the door behind him and asked Tata</b>
<br><b>how it possibly could've gotten in the house. Tata didn't say anything.</b>
<br><b>The next morning when Dad arrived at the house, the rooster was
pacing at</b>
<br><b>the front door. Dad had to kick it away, because when he opened
the front</b>
<br><b>door the rooster tried to enter the house. This continued for the
next few</b>
<br><b>days. Very soon after this period my Grandfather began to deteriorate
very</b>
<br><b>quickly. Tata died in September of 1983. The Rooster was never seen
again</b>
<br><b>after those few strange morning visits, not across the street, not
up the</b>
<br><b>street, or anywhere. Was he just a stubborn animal or did he have
a</b>
<br><b>foreboding message to deliver?</b><b></b>

<br><b>Their Home or Mine</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dsh@arkansas.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I bought a house that had been built by a family in 1955.&nbsp; The
owners</b>
<br><b>had built the house for them and everything was high quality and</b>
<br><b>technologically advanced for such a time.&nbsp; It was obvious to
anyone who</b>
<br><b>entered the house&nbsp; that it was loved by special people.&nbsp;
When my husband</b>
<br><b>and I moved in, in 1998, we were pleased with the care taken in
details</b>
<br><b>such as lighting, window treatments, tiling, wallpapering, electrical</b>
<br><b>and such.&nbsp; In addition, the lady of the house was enamored
by</b>
<br><b>Christmas.&nbsp; There is a pull mechanism activated by the opening
of the</b>
<br><b>front door which chimes "Come all Ye Faithful".&nbsp; I have never
been</b>
<br><b>fearful in this house but am steeped in peacefulness.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several months after moving in, I had a
dream in which the previous</b>
<br><b>owners showed up at the doorway, and my being so pleased and contented</b>
<br><b>with our new home, I asked them to come inside only remembering
later in</b>
<br><b>the dream that they had passed on.&nbsp; The lady was quite cheerful
but the</b>
<br><b>gentleman was somewhat irate that we had purchased their personal
items</b>
<br><b>at an estate sale.&nbsp; He said,&nbsp; "I never meant for them
to have these."</b>
<br><b>In the dream I was riled and told him they were mine and that I
had</b>
<br><b>purchased them legally.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lady mildly chastised him
with good humor</b>
<br><b>and he was docile.&nbsp; It was obvious they loved each other.&nbsp;
I have never</b>
<br><b>dreamt of them since but the dream is still vivid.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several times I have been awoken in the wee hours
by LOUD banging on</b>
<br><b>the front door.&nbsp;&nbsp; BANG, BANG, BANG.&nbsp;&nbsp; At least
on one occasion, I</b>
<br><b>distinctly remembering elbowing my husband awake to tell him there
was</b>
<br><b>someone at the front door, banging, and to find out what was about.&nbsp;
As</b>
<br><b>he investigated, I remember lying in bed and wondering why whoever
it</b>
<br><b>was did not ring the bell.&nbsp; As you might have guessed, there
was no one</b>
<br><b>at the door.&nbsp; I haven't heard the loud knocks in the early
morning for</b>
<br><b>at least a year.&nbsp; I wonder why they stopped trying to make
contact.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>only guess is that the lady of the house has pulled the master from
his</b>
<br><b>earthly abode&nbsp; to a more wonderful existence.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Things that make you go "hmmm?"</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mconklin1@cfl.rr.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have lurked here long enough.&nbsp; After
reading many stories I have</b>
<br><b>decided to send in some of my own.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a young girl, the oldest of 6 brothers
and sisters, we lived in</b>
<br><b>a old house.&nbsp; It was over 100 years old when we live there.&nbsp;
This first</b>
<br><b>time I ever saw anything was when my brothers and sisters &amp;
I were</b>
<br><b>playing in one of the living rooms.&nbsp; We were spinning around
and jumping</b>
<br><b>and doing who knows what when I saw, 10 feet in front of me, an</b>
<br><b>apparition of a young girl.&nbsp; She was dressed in older period
clothing.</b>
<br><b>She wore a dark dress with an apron type looking thing over it.&nbsp;
Long,</b>
<br><b>dark, heavy stockings and what appeared to be button up shoes.&nbsp;
She had</b>
<br><b>long brown hair curled into ringlets.&nbsp; It seemed that she was
playing</b>
<br><b>along with us, as she seemed to be clapping her hands and laughing.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>disappeared quickly.&nbsp; I was staring into space when my sister
Nancy</b>
<br><b>asked me what was wrong.&nbsp; I really wasn't sure of what I had
seen so I</b>
<br><b>shook my head and told her I had must have became dizzy.&nbsp; That
was that.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the years progress and we became more
aware of the house and all</b>
<br><b>its quirks, we noticed more things.&nbsp; My sister Nancy and I
shared a</b>
<br><b>bedroom at the top of the stairs.&nbsp; It was a Friday night and
my parents</b>
<br><b>were having some friends over for night game of croquet.&nbsp; All
of us kids</b>
<br><b>were safely tucked into bed.&nbsp; I fell asleep before my sister
did only to</b>
<br><b>be rudely awaken by her shaking me violently.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could
tell by the tone</b>
<br><b>of her whispers that she was terrified.&nbsp; She was asking me
"did you hear</b>
<br><b>that?"&nbsp; Of course I was angry at being woke up and told her
I didn't</b>
<br><b>hear a thing because I was asleep.&nbsp; She told me to listen.&nbsp;
Well, I</b>
<br><b>waited and waited, but heard nothing.&nbsp; I finally drifted back
off to</b>
<br><b>sleep, only to be awoken again by her asking me the same question.</b>
<br><b>Still I replied the same as before.&nbsp; She insisted that I lay
there and</b>
<br><b>listen.&nbsp; She was clutching me tightly.&nbsp; So, after awhile
still nothing.</b>
<br><b>I began telling her she must be hearing things and to go to sleep.&nbsp;
As I</b>
<br><b>was laying there, trying to calm her down, I heard it!&nbsp; It
was a</b>
<br><b>knocking sound.&nbsp; I was come from the other side of the wall,
directly</b>
<br><b>above the head of our bed.&nbsp; It knocked in a pattern.&nbsp;
One knock, a</b>
<br><b>pause, three knocks, a pause, than one knock.&nbsp; This kept up
for awhile.</b>
<br><b>Over and over again.&nbsp; We were terrified to leave the room as
we had to</b>
<br><b>walk by a attic closet door, which would have led to the unused
space</b>
<br><b>where the knocks were coming from.&nbsp; So on the count of three,
we</b>
<br><b>screamed for Mom.&nbsp; Mom and Dad arrived moments later and tried
to calm</b>
<br><b>our fears.&nbsp; They turned on all the lights, and looked into
closets and</b>
<br><b>under beds, finding nothing, of course.&nbsp; We ended up sleeping
on the</b>
<br><b>couch downstairs that night, and pretty much every night after that.</b>
<br><b>Until my parents got tired of that and moved us to another unused</b>
<br><b>bedroom upstairs, and moved my brother Ken into THAT room.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nancy and I really liked our new room.&nbsp;
We spent a lot of time in</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; At night we would lay in bed at night with the lights
off</b>
<br><b>talking before we both drifted off to sleep.&nbsp; Like I said earlier,
the</b>
<br><b>house was over 100 years old and was always creaking or "settling"
as my</b>
<br><b>Dad would say.&nbsp; But to Nancy and I, the settling noises sounded
like</b>
<br><b>footsteps to us.&nbsp; The footsteps would walk up the stairs and
down the</b>
<br><b>hall to our bedroom door and stop there.&nbsp; My sister and I would
lay in</b>
<br><b>bed at night and count the steps up the stairs and the amount of
steps</b>
<br><b>down the hall to our bedroom.&nbsp; It was the same exact number
of steps of</b>
<br><b>the stairway and the same number of steps it would have taken to
get</b>
<br><b>down the hall to our bedroom door. I know because we practiced it
over</b>
<br><b>and over again.&nbsp; And it did sound like footsteps because you
could tell</b>
<br><b>by the tone of the noise,&nbsp; that it was getting closer.&nbsp;
I thought it odd</b>
<br><b>that the house would settle in a pattern like that.&nbsp; From the
bottom of</b>
<br><b>the steps to the top.&nbsp; Sometimes, I would swear that someone
even</b>
<br><b>crawled into bed with me at times.&nbsp; I was never really frightened
by any</b>
<br><b>of this.&nbsp; My sister, and brother, and I often spoke of the
strange</b>
<br><b>things happening in the house.&nbsp; We would ask Ken if there were
any</b>
<br><b>strange things happening in the room, and he told us he was always</b>
<br><b>terrified there and always slept the the blankets pulled over his
head.</b>
<br><b>He still doesn't like to talk about it to this day.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was years ago, and my parents sold
the house and we moved to</b>
<br><b>another part of the state.&nbsp; I was older and moved into my own
place.</b>
<br><b>Things have pretty much gone on as normal.&nbsp; My Dad passed away
over 10</b>
<br><b>years ago.&nbsp; I was living in Florida at the time and still do
now.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>used to work at a grocery store.&nbsp; One day I was heading to
the front of</b>
<br><b>the store to send an order.&nbsp; Something told me to turn around
and look.</b>
<br><b>I noticed a man that resembled my Dad (in looks) alot.&nbsp; The
way he</b>
<br><b>walked, (he had a limp) and the way he dressed for work.&nbsp; I
turned down</b>
<br><b>one of the aisles and thought to myself I better have another look.&nbsp;
So</b>
<br><b>I quickly turned around and got to where I could see the customers
along</b>
<br><b>the back aisle and that person was no longer there.&nbsp; So I shot
up to the</b>
<br><b>front of the store to cut this person off at the path.&nbsp; I searched
the</b>
<br><b>whole store twice and I did not see this person there.&nbsp; There
was no way</b>
<br><b>this person could have left the store without me seeing them.&nbsp;
I really</b>
<br><b>do believe this was my father just letting me know he is around.&nbsp;
One of</b>
<br><b>my sisters also says she has seen him in the house that they live
in</b>
<br><b>now.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 17 years ago I lived with a man I
loved very much.&nbsp; We had a</b>
<br><b>child together.&nbsp; For reasons that I won't go into, things didn't
work</b>
<br><b>out for us and we went our separate ways.&nbsp; After many years
we connected</b>
<br><b>again for talks and a visit or two.&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the blue,
he passed away,</b>
<br><b>due to an unknown health problem.&nbsp; I was very saddened and
mourned for</b>
<br><b>him immensely, thinking of things that might have been.&nbsp; After
he</b>
<br><b>passed, I felt his presence around me many times.&nbsp; It seemed
as if he</b>
<br><b>was trying to comfort me.&nbsp; After the memorial,&nbsp; his friends
and family</b>
<br><b>settled matters, they sent me some momentos of his.&nbsp; They also
sent me</b>
<br><b>some, not all, of his ashes, asking me to take them with me to Key
West</b>
<br><b>the next time I go.&nbsp; Well, I haven't been to Key West yet,
and I am not</b>
<br><b>sure when I will be going.&nbsp; So his ashes sit in my sons, (his
son)</b>
<br><b>bedroom.&nbsp; One afternoon, I arrived home from work.&nbsp; I
went into my room</b>
<br><b>to change clothes.&nbsp; I came out of the bedroom and I looked
down the hall</b>
<br><b>towards my sons room.&nbsp; Something caught my eye.&nbsp; I saw
a human figure at</b>
<br><b>the end of the hall.&nbsp; It had no head to speak of and was missing
lower</b>
<br><b>legs and feet.&nbsp; It was wearing a short sleeved light blue shirt
and</b>
<br><b>white slacks.&nbsp; I stopped for a moment to check my vision, than
it</b>
<br><b>"floated" into a locked bedroom (unused) door.&nbsp; I thought&nbsp;
I had just</b>
<br><b>seen a ghost, but didn't know who.&nbsp; A week or so ago I went
into my</b>
<br><b>son's room to talk to him about cleaning it up and noticed the box
of</b>
<br><b>ashes on his dresser.&nbsp; He told me he wanted to get something
nice to put</b>
<br><b>them in.&nbsp; I was telling him he didn't have to keep them in
his room if</b>
<br><b>he didn't want to.&nbsp; I opened the box that contained his ashes
and</b>
<br><b>noticed a photograph of him on top.&nbsp; I pulled it out to look
at it and</b>
<br><b>in the photo he was wearing a light blue shirt and white slacks.&nbsp;
Like I</b>
<br><b>said earlier, I had some, not all of his ashes.&nbsp; Thanks for
listening.</b><b></b>

<br><b>would pass this mysterious looking house. One day I was coming home
from a</b>
<br><b>late night school event when we passed the house. I saw two figures
standing</b>
<br><b>outside very dark looking staring right into my eyes! The next day
I was on</b>
<br><b>my bus and when we passed the house I heard a voice say "Erin, come!
please</b>
<br><b>come!". I took my head phones off and looked around. I was the only
person in</b>
<br><b>the back of the bus! Everyone else was up front and were all 1st
graders who</b>
<br><b>didn't even know my name. So about a week later I had to stay after
school w/</b>
<br><b>a friend and she believed my story so we stopped at the house. I
was going to</b>
<br><b>make up something like: Are these keys yours I found them out front?
So I</b>
<br><b>went and knocked on the door while my friend sat in the car ears
distance. I</b>
<br><b>knocked only one time and someone opened the door immediately! Like
they knew</b>
<br><b>when I was going to knock at that exact moment or something! It
was a young</b>
<br><b>woman about in her early 30's or so. "Can I help u?" She said looking</b>
<br><b>straight into my eyes. "Are these your keys?" I asked feeling pretty
stupid</b>
<br><b>since she was so normal looking. "No, I'm sorry they aren't." She
said in an</b>
<br><b>English accent smiling in a very devilishly way as if she were inviting
me</b>
<br><b>inside. "OK sorry to bother u" I said just about to leave in a scared
voice.</b>
<br><b>Then I heard a voice in the back ground yell Marie! She turned around
for</b>
<br><b>just a sec to look at the voice. When she turned back she was about
to shut</b>
<br><b>the door when again she looked straight into my eyes but this time
she had</b>
<br><b>none! It was like a deep Pitt of blackness. The next day I was looking
in the</b>
<br><b>obituaries (Like I do everyday, I know it's strange) when I came
across the</b>
<br><b>memorial section that said: Marie Wilson, 35 died from car crash
on local</b>
<br><b>bridge. The memorial date was 6/10 the same day I went and knocked
on that</b>
<br><b>door. The picture was also there and it was the same woman I saw
at that</b>
<br><b>house! She was also wearing the same cloths she was wearing the
day before!</b>
<br><b>So now whenever I pass that creepy house I feel and sometimes see
someone</b>
<br><b>staring at me through the window and sometimes outside looking me
in the eyes!</b>

<br><b>Two Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: vaughaner316@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I was laying in bed one night, a regular dark winter night, and right
after i turned off my T.V. in my room, and I started to try to go to sleep,
I started hearing scratching up by my head which appeared to be under my
bed.&nbsp; If I remember correctly i got up, ran to my light switch, turned
it on and looked under my bed...I saw nothing.&nbsp; I turned off my light
and went back to bed.&nbsp; Then i heard it again, except this time it
was like growling and scratching noises.&nbsp; I got REALLY scared. I thought
to myself, "It's probably just the wind"(and that's what my parents thought
too)But when I was outside just hours before, it was a calm night with
no or little wind.&nbsp; I still havn't figured out what it was.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is my second story... When this
experience happened I was again laying in my bed.&nbsp; But since long
gone to sleep, then i woke up with no reason at all in the middle of the
night.&nbsp; I was used to waking up in the middle of the night then (from
nightmares and stuff, I was 11) But that night for some reason I was scared,
obviously I was scared all the other nights from nightmares but that night
i didn't have a dream when I woke up.&nbsp; I looked over my bed to see
if a presense was there that would make me scared.&nbsp; I saw a dark blackish
shadowy figure walking around the edge of my bed.&nbsp; I yelled for my
parents and when my dad came in it seemed to dissapear.&nbsp; Maybe it
was just my eyes playing tricks on me like when i wake up in the morning
sometimes, but i dont know. Thanks for reading this!!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Many Short Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: angelab@stargate.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I just found your site today &amp; I love it...please
keep up the good, no great, job!!&nbsp; You said that we could send personal
stories about our own ghosts.&nbsp; Well, I have a few stories for you.&nbsp;
You can put them on your site or in your newsletter if you would like.</b>
<br><b>Short Story #1</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; My grandfather, my mom's dad, died almost twenty years
before I was born.&nbsp; Obviously I never knew him, but I know what he
looked like because of pictures on our walls &amp; in photo albums.&nbsp;
One night I was home alone, watching TV, when I felt someone looking at
me.&nbsp; At first I just ignored it, but the feeling wouldn't go away.&nbsp;
After a while I slowly turned my head toward the dining room.&nbsp; In
our dining room we have two windows with curtains.&nbsp; As I looked I
saw a man standing there with his hand holding the curtain open.&nbsp;
At first he was looking out the window, but when he realized that I saw
him he looked at me and smiled.&nbsp; I could see this man perfectly but
could also see right through him!&nbsp; When I took a good look at him
I realized that it was my grandpap.&nbsp; He was wearing black pants, a
white shirt, suspenders &amp; glasses.&nbsp; After he looked at me &amp;
smiled, I looked away for a quick second.&nbsp; When I looked back at the
window, the curtain was back in its place &amp; he was gone.&nbsp; Ever
since that night I'm never afraid to be home alone, because I know that
there's always someone watching over me.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Short Story #2</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been sleeping soundly in my bed.&nbsp; I have
a blanket that my grandma made for me when I was born, I keep it at the
foot of my bed.&nbsp; In order to get my blanket to put it on, I would
have to get out of bed to get it.&nbsp; I began to dream about my grandfather,
my dad's dad, who at the time had been dead for at least five years.&nbsp;
In this dream, or what I thought was a dream, my grandfather came into
my bedroom.&nbsp; I remember looking at him, smiling, and telling him that
I've missed him.&nbsp; He smiled at me and asked me if I was cold, I said
that I was.&nbsp; So, he got my blanket that my grandmother had made for
me and put it on me, then he left my room.&nbsp; When my mom came to wake
me up for school that morning, before I opened my eyes I asked her what
blanket I had on top of me.&nbsp; She was a bit startled to see the blanket
that her mom had made for me.&nbsp; When she told me that I had that blanket
on, I opened my eyes quickly &amp; asked her if she had gotten up and put
it on me during the night, she hadn't.&nbsp; I told her that I had dreamed
about my grandfather during the night.&nbsp; She told me that she had been
awakened by voices in the night, as she listened she realized that it was
me and an older man.&nbsp; She didn't go to find out who I had been talking
to because, like me, she assumed that she was dreaming.&nbsp; Apparently,
my grandfather really had come to visit me in the middle of the night and
indeed did put my blanket on me!&nbsp; Okay, you could say that I could've
gotten up &amp; gotten the blanket myself.&nbsp; But the truth is, I'm
paralyzed &amp; it isn't easy for me to get around without my wheelchair
since I don't have use of my legs.&nbsp; So, my mom heard me talking to
someone, I remember my grandfather being in my bedroom &amp; my blanket
was on me when I woke up in the morning.</b>
<br><b>Short Story #3</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; My mom had a miscarriage in between having my older
brother and myself.&nbsp; One night I was in my room taking out my contact
lenses when I heard a banging noise.&nbsp; It startled me so I looked throughout
the house to see what the noise was, but couldn't find anything out of
the ordinary.&nbsp; Since it was nighttime, I was a bit nervous after hearing
that noise, but I tried to go on with what I had started.&nbsp; A few minutes
later I felt something or someone touch my shoulder.&nbsp; When I turned
around there was no one there.&nbsp; Then I heard, in a very faint, child-like
voice, "Don't worry, sissy, I'm here with you."&nbsp; You could say that
it was just my imagination running wild, but I know what I heard...the
brother I never had a chance to meet.</b>
<br><b>Short Story #4</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; My mom and I had gone to the airport to pick up her
best friend for her son's graduation from the State Police Academy.&nbsp;
Once we left the airport, I decided that I was going to finish the trip
with Helen's (my mom's best friend) daughter, who still lives in the area.&nbsp;
The next day, on our way back home, I was again with Nicki in her car.&nbsp;
Our mom's were in my mom's car.&nbsp; We had been following my mom home,
but got separated when my mom had to pull over to get gas.&nbsp; About
halfway home, we got caught in a terrible rain storm.&nbsp; Although Nicki
was driving slower than usual and being careful, she lost control of the
car when a tractor trailer drove past us and splashed the car with rain
from the road.&nbsp; Her car stayed on the road but turned around three
times, and as it was turning we felt something hit the one side of the
back end of the car very hard.&nbsp; When the car finally came to a stop,
and we both realized that neither of us was hurt, I said to Nicki that
I think we had hit the guard rail or median barrier.&nbsp; Apparently she
had realized more than I had at the time.&nbsp; We hadn't hit the guard
rail or median barrier, there was another tractor trailer behind us and
when our car went out of control, the truck swerved to try to miss us.&nbsp;
He didn't completely miss us, but at least he only smashed up the back
end of the car.&nbsp; Anyway, after the truck driver pulled over to see
if we were okay, another couple of men came to the car to see if we were
okay.&nbsp; Once they saw that we were okay, they used their cell phone
to call for some help for us.&nbsp; After the ambulance, police, a tow
truck, and even a fire truck showed up, my friend got out of the car to
go thank the men that had used their phone to call for help for us.&nbsp;
But when she got out of the car, there was no car there and the men we
had seen and talked to were gone, too!&nbsp; So, Nicki asked the truck
driver who was still there if he had seen the men leave.&nbsp; He asked
her to describe the car, so she did.&nbsp; He had a puzzled look on his
face and then told us that there had been no one else there except him!&nbsp;
Nicki and I both know that we saw two men and a car behind ours, but they
quickly disappeared into "thin air"!&nbsp; We truly believe that those
men were indeed angels, they came to help us but then quietly left without
a trace.</b>
<br><b>Short Story #5</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; This last story just occurred a few days ago.&nbsp;
A very good friend of my mom's passed away after a short illness.&nbsp;
This woman was very special to my mom and I.&nbsp; Before this woman got
terribly ill, she and I talked on the phone every other day if not every
day.&nbsp; Whenever we would end our conversations, she always ended it
the same way.&nbsp; She'd say, "Love ya, gorgeous!"&nbsp; Well, I was watching
TV the other day when I saw a commercial that this woman and I always laughed
at for some reason.&nbsp; I laughed out loud and said, "Oh, Katie, where
are you?"&nbsp; As the commercial was ending the phone rang.&nbsp; When
I answered it all I heard at first was static.&nbsp; But a second or so
later, I heard a woman with a raspy voice (like my mom's friend) laugh
and say, "Love ya, gorgeous!", then I heard the static again &amp; the
phone disconnected like it always does at the end of a phone call!!!&nbsp;
This would be no big deal except for the fact that no one except my mom
knew that Katie said that to me every time we ended a phone call.&nbsp;
I knew it wasn't my mom playing a joke on me because she was at work and
isn't allowed to make outgoing phone calls, and she wouldn't play a cruel
trick like that on me.&nbsp; As I hung up the phone I had a huge smile
on my face, looked up toward the sky and said, "Love ya, too, gorgeous!"&nbsp;
Although Katie is gone from this earth, she hasn't completely left us...which
is just fine with me!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Two Stories of Spirits</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: scoobyjack@houston.rr.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I no longer live in the house. It was once the second story to a
garage apartment. It was a two bedroom house that my husband lived in before
we were married. I had been to the house many time before and I had felt
nothing strange. When we got married in 1999 i was already pregnant with
our first son. I moved in and for the first few weeks everything seemed
alright. Then one night I came home from work and somethings looked like
they had been moved around. Shrugging it off thinking i had just forgotten
i had moved some stuff around i forgot about it all. Then again i came
home and stuff in the kitchen looked like it had been moved around. Thinking
that my husband was moving stuff before he went to work I ignored it again.
But i decided i would wait for a day when he would leave work before me.
Then i purposely set out a mug with half drunk hot hea on the end of the
counter and went to work. When I came home the mug was clean and in the
sink. I asked my husband if he had come home for any reason and he told
me no. He asked why and i told him. He laughed and told me i was being
silly.</b>
<br><b>Everything seemed to stop for a while then i was in the bathroom
when i felt like i was being watched. i looked into the bedroom and no
one was there. A few days later i walked into the bathroom to see the shower
curtain moving but the vent in the bathroom was off. To make sure no air
was coming through the vent i shut off the air and still the curtains moved.
Off and on while i was in the bathroom i would feel someone watching.</b>
<br><b>Then i had a friend come over and she yelled from the bathroom what
i wanted and i told her i didn't call her. about two minutes later she
flies out of the bathroom pale as a ghost saying she heard her name. She
came over once more about a month later and again heard her name in the
bathroom and her daughter who was six heard her name also. Needless to
say they never used my bathroom with the door shut.</b>
<br><b>This whole time i was telling my husband what was going on and he
refused to believe it. Then one night we had just come back from the movies.
We were in bed when my husband jumped out of bed saying hair just brushed
his feet. I had been sound asleep so we knew it wasn't me. But still my
husband refused to believe it could possibly be a ghost.</b>
<br><b>At this time we had a lad rottweiller mix. She would sit in the
middle of the second bedroom which was designed to be the babies room and
bark and chase things around the room like she was playing. She never seemed
to be scared of the presence or what ever it was.</b>
<br><b>Six months passed with nothing then i was sitting in the livingroom
watching t.v. I heard foot steps in the kitchen. My husband was in bed
snoring. The hair on the back of my neck stood on end. Scared i decided
to get my dog to keep me company but when i opened the front door she was
pulling on her chain with all her might trying to get away from the house.
When i went to get her she bit me good. That was the only time she had
ever shown any aggression and she was about eight months old at the time.
I went back into the house and the evil feeling was gone. A few days later
my husband has scratch marks on his back,{ neither of us has nails} and
i had scratch marks on my breasts. But it was six fingers not five.</b>
<br><b>Nothing happened then i had our son. The night my son was born my
dog dissapeared. I'm pretty sure it had nothing to do with the house. My
dog was a barker and i'm sure one of the irritated neighbors took her.
We brought my son home and that night i was sitting on the couch feeding
out son when my husband went into the bedroom to get something. He suddenly
started talking to himself in a low voice. He came back into the livingroom
asking why i hadn't answered his question. I looked at him strange and
told him i had been on the couch and he was speaking too low to hear so
i thought he was talking to himself. He shook his head and swore he turned
his head to the side while he was walking into the bedroom and saw me right
behind him.</b>
<br><b>Another incident happened when we went out to eat for the first
time after the birth of our son. We came home and my husbands surround
sound, vcr, tuner, and television had been rewired.&nbsp; By this time
we changed our locks several times. We changed them again.</b>
<br><b>Nothing seemed to happen again. Then one night in bed my husband
and i saw a man walk from the baby's room to the kitchen. All i saw was
a white shirt, but none like they have today. I checked on my son and he
was sound asleep with a smile on his face.</b>
<br><b>That was the last of the incidents in the house. But before my husband
and i got married he and a friend were living together. His friend had
been in bed one night which was in the babies room and distinctly heard
a woman whisper in his ear his name and a good night in his ear and he
also had the tv, vcr, turner and surroundsound get rewired.</b>
<br><b>I had lived in the area of Jacinto City and Galena Park Texas all
my life and i knew that Santa Anna had been captured around that area.</b>
<br><b>Another friend of mine lived about seven streets down and no one
went into her mother in law's garage alone for fear of being attacked.
The garage is now locked up I believe and no one goes in there.</b>
<br><b>When i was younger and living with my mother I would smell a cologne
i had never smelled before. No men lived in our house since my father died
when i was four. It would appear then would dissapear. Everytime I did
something wrong when i was little i would smell that smell. Then i graduated
and started working. I had just started a new jod at a convience store
when i began to smell that smell again. It was a very pleasant smell. About
a minute later I was robbed at gun point but i knew i would be okay.</b>
<br><b>Later my mother and i were shopping when there was an open bottle
of cologne that smelled like that smell i knew. I asked my mother about
it and she told me my father had always worn that cologne.</b>
<br><b>Less than a year later working at the same job and three months
pregnant with our first son that smell came again and i was robbed again.
And again I knew I was going to be okay but i didn't hang around at that
job either. I quit not wanting to take anymore chances.</b>
<br><b>There was an incident with my sister. She had been up late one night
and the next morning she got up and went to church. I don't know if it
was on the way to church or on the way home when she fell asleep behind
the wheel.</b>
<br><b>She suddenly heard a deep male voice yell her name and she woke
up just in time to keep from hitting the divider.</b>
<br><b>Some of this incidents could be explained and some cannot. I'll
let you be the judge. But every once in a while I still smell my father's
cologne. But this time instead of me getting in trouble it's my son!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Unanswered Questions</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: imfdood@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well, I am 14 now, and I am still kinda spooked when I think about
this but</b>
<br><b>I feel bad that I didn`t have time to do anything about it...</b>
<br><b>First of all, my grandmother and my grandfather were in the hospital.
My</b>
<br><b>grandfather had the most easy treatable form of cancer, and it went
into</b>
<br><b>remission, so he was going to be back home in six days. My grandmother
was</b>
<br><b>in the hospital because an intestine ruptured and toxins were spreading</b>
<br><b>through her body. They said my grandmother was not going to make
it, and my</b>
<br><b>grandfather was to be home. Six days later, my grandmother was home
fine and</b>
<br><b>my grandfather was dead. Now, one night I was sleeping in my bed.
I had my</b>
<br><b>back turned and was facing the wall. I awoke with a jerk. I had
a very very</b>
<br><b>perplexed feeling like I`ve never had in my life. I turned to face
the room.</b>
<br><b>I saw a man standing near my door. He was dressed in an old style
suit with</b>
<br><b>a cap on. I freaked out and couldn`t breath, this was my first time</b>
<br><b>remembering seeing an apparition or ghost or spirit, or entity,
as people</b>
<br><b>put it.. He would just stand there, and I would talk to him. He
wouldn`t</b>
<br><b>respond, just stand there. I fell asleep. I woke up, he was gone.
He</b>
<br><b>appeared every night after that. After about a month, he was still</b>
<br><b>appearing. I was still a bit spooked at him though. One night, I
awoke to</b>
<br><b>nothing. He wasn`t there. But there was something outside my door.
I thought</b>
<br><b>of demons and monsters awaiting, but I grit my teeth and opened
the door. I</b>
<br><b>looked down the hallway, and my dad was standing there. There was
a noise</b>
<br><b>coming from the kitchen. My dad turned and looked at me, his eyes
wide. This</b>
<br><b>scared me. Then he spoke, he said "..the scratching noise in the
kitchen, my</b>
<br><b>father is getting closer." I stared for a moment, then realized
what he just</b>
<br><b>said, and gasped, ran into my room, slammed the door, backed up
agains`t my</b>
<br><b>wall, couldn`t breath. Then, I knew he was real. Next night he was
back. In</b>
<br><b>my mind I was thinking what the hell does he want me to do, at the
time I</b>
<br><b>had enough problems in my life. A few nights later, he was gone.
There was</b>
<br><b>no sounds outside my door, and I could hear a scratching noise in
the</b>
<br><b>kitchen. I stayed in my bed. The problems in my life erupted, and
I moved</b>
<br><b>out of the apartment. I now live with my mother. I haven`t seen
any ghosts</b>
<br><b>since. But I feel sad, maybe he wanted me to do something, right
some sort</b>
<br><b>of wrong. I wonder if my father sees the person..</b>
<br><b>I moved in with my mother about a month ago, so this is a fresh
story. I</b>
<br><b>read your conduct your own safe ghost hunt thing and would absolutely
LOVE</b>
<br><b>to try it, but well I`m not really wanted back at my fathers apartment,
nor</b>
<br><b>would I want to be there. But if I were alone or perhaps with a
friend with</b>
<br><b>the equipment, I bet I would find something.</b>
<br><b>My theories are:</b>
<br><b>1. The ghost is my grandfather and he wants me to change something.</b>
<br><b>2. The ghost wants me to do something in the kitchen or dig something
up</b>
<br><b>which wouldn`t be possible because you are on the 22nd floor of
a 25 story</b>
<br><b>apartment.</b>
<br><b>3. Its someone who died there previously before my father and I
moved in and</b>
<br><b>wants me to find something. (but what happened to my dad when he
was</b>
<br><b>'sleepwalking'?)</b>
<br><b>4. Its all in my head (I don`t think so but I`ve been told that)</b>
<br><b>One fact I have gathered is that spirits have power over people
when they</b>
<br><b>sleep and can invoke dreams or something. I have to get that fact</b>
<br><b>straightened out and learn more about it, so that will explain my
fathers</b>
<br><b>'sleepwalking'.</b>
<br><b>I would like to go back there perhaps with a Ouija board, even though
they</b>
<br><b>aren`t influenced, and see what will happen, ask a few questions,
cause I am</b>
<br><b>really troubled if there is something very wrong and my grandfather
knows</b>
<br><b>some bad event will take place or something bad was done to him,
or he wants</b>
<br><b>something done, or I don`t know. If the Ouija board fails, I would
like to</b>
<br><b>conduct a ghost hunt. Hopefully, any of the above will help me contact</b>
<br><b>and/or find out what the ghost wants, who he is, and why he is here.</b>

<br><b>on 12/20/81 at the age of 31;My mother,little brother and I were
living in a</b>
<br><b>shelter;He was going to fake a suicide attempt(his 3rd)in order
to get my mom</b>
<br><b>to come back to him</b>
<br><b>but he was drunk,possibly stoned and had fell from the attic(where
he was</b>
<br><b>hiding,waiting for my mom to come by and retrieve our presents)and
apparently</b>
<br><b>passed out and hung himself;Anyway,nothing really strange had ever
happened</b>
<br><b>to me until I was around 25;(I was 13 when he passed away)I am now
32 and</b>
<br><b>every once in a while something strange will happen;I sent in a
story a while</b>
<br><b>back about someone playing w/my hair in the middleof the night;Well,before</b>
<br><b>that I had another experience;</b>
<br><b>Here goes;In the summer of 97 my younger sister (my moms 2nd marriage)was</b>
<br><b>abducted and assaulted and left for dead;She was 12;Well,of course
my mother</b>
<br><b>took it very hard and sought help for her immediately;My mother
and</b>
<br><b>stepfather were in fact arguing about that help in the fall of 97
when my</b>
<br><b>mother(understandably stressed)suffered a seizure;I was waiting
at home for</b>
<br><b>word of how she was doing;it was around 10:00 pm;my children were
asleep,my</b>
<br><b>husband at work;I was alone,making my husbands lunch for the next
day,worried</b>
<br><b>sick;No television,radio,etc.,was on;I began to bargain,out loud,with</b>
<br><b>God,dead family members,"just let my mom be ok";Then I said out
loud "Hey</b>
<br><b>Dad,Why dont you help her out?You never did anything&nbsp; good
for her while you</b>
<br><b>were alive,I'm sure you could&nbsp; try to help her now;God knows
you probably</b>
<br><b>need all the help you could get now!!"</b>
<br><b>Well,no sooner were the words out of my mouth,I heard a loud noise;I
had a</b>
<br><b>small entertainment center that,at one time,had a glass door,but
having two</b>
<br><b>children the door did not last long;($199 K-Mart specials;it was
a</b>
<br><b>gift)Anyway,on the bottom shelf,I had a row of my childrens Disney
movies all</b>
<br><b>standing w/the spines facing out where you could see the name of
the</b>
<br><b>movie;They were tightly wedged together to keep the baby from constantly</b>
<br><b>pulling them out and tearing them apart;You&nbsp; really had to
work to get a</b>
<br><b>movie out of there;Well,after hearing the noise,I went and checked
on the</b>
<br><b>chldren thinking one of them got up;They were crashed,snoring,the
works;I</b>
<br><b>walked back to the living room and glanced at the entertainment
center;All of</b>
<br><b>the movies were all laying back w/the spines facing upward;It was
if someone</b>
<br><b>had taken their hands,arm,whatever and had I guess "swept"for want
of a</b>
<br><b>better word,all of the movies onto their backs and up against the
wall;I told</b>
<br><b>my mom(she was fine)about it later and&nbsp; she said :"dont talk
to him;He was</b>
<br><b>throwing one of his tantrums"I said "him who?"</b>
<br><b>She said "your daddy,who else were you talking to ?"</b>
<br><b>Another quick story (I amsooo sorry this&nbsp; is long)</b>
<br><b>June 1996;My husband and two small children were living in rental
house;It</b>
<br><b>had a bolt lock on the front door that once locked on the outside,you
could</b>
<br><b>not unlock from the inside(make sense??)My husband had the only
key;One</b>
<br><b>saturday he took the children on an outing and bolted the door behind
him;My</b>
<br><b>only way out was the back door since I could not unbolt from the
inside(I</b>
<br><b>think it was installed backwards)</b>
<br><b>Anyway,I was blow drying my hair( I know,I know,you always hear
the phone</b>
<br><b>ring or the doorbell when you are drying your hair or vacuuming)Anyway,I</b>
<br><b>SWEAR that I heard my brothers voice,clear as a bell,yell "HEY SHELL!!"It
was</b>
<br><b>so clear that I holler back "Hang on!! I'll be right there!!"so
I hurry and</b>
<br><b>dry my hair,go into the living room,</b>
<br><b>and there is noone there;I look out the window;No car;then I realize,there</b>
<br><b>was no way for him to even get in w/out a key;I asked him a few
days later if</b>
<br><b>he came by;He was in Oklahoma that weekend;Not even in the state;The
only</b>
<br><b>person Whose voice closely resembles his was my fathers;to this
day,every</b>
<br><b>once in a great while,I will hear a man call me;Thinking its my
husband I</b>
<br><b>will go to him asking "what?"he works nights so usually he is alseep
or he</b>
<br><b>says he didnt call for me??</b>
<br><b>I was told by a friend that maybe he is in limbo and is trying to
contact</b>
<br><b>me;I dont know&nbsp; what to think;Insanity runs rampant in my paternal
side,and I</b>
<br><b>sometimes wonder if perhaps I am merely hearing voices that exist
only in my</b>
<br><b>mind.</b>

<p><b>Hi, I have Hquite a good experince on this subject. See a ghost had
been</b>
<br><b>haunting me, and my friends for a little while now.One night as
I was</b>
<br><b>drifting off to sleep, I started to dream. I didn't dream ,anything
ummm</b>
<br><b>well, unuasul. Then I awake&nbsp; very suddenly. Almost like something
was pushing</b>
<br><b>me. I got this just horrible, horrible feeling in my stomach. I
knew some</b>
<br><b>thing was wrong, and in this very second that this spirit&nbsp;
woke my from my</b>
<br><b>pleasent rest, I knew it had to do with this ghost. I was mad, and
scared at</b>
<br><b>the same time. I didn't know what it was doing, and I thought some
bad things</b>
<br><b>it might have been doing, to my family. So I got up rather fast
to find</b>
<br><b>nothing. When I came into the living room I found all of the windows</b>
<br><b>unlocked, and the doors too. Some people sleep like this, and that
is</b>
<br><b>perfectly fine, but alot of my nieghbors were having break ins.So
I locked</b>
<br><b>every thing up, and as I was going back in to my room I saw my ghost
, not</b>
<br><b>scary, but just a white glowing light. I felt pretty grateful that
night, but</b>
<br><b>since&nbsp; it was late, I went back to bed, and almost immediantly
feel asleep.</b><b></b>

<p><b>hello , my name is Brian Chandler and when i was 14 { I am 25 now
} I did an overnight stay with the sea cadets troop I was with , aboard
the USS ALABAMA . Mored in Mobile bay as a museam . All was quiet until
around 9:00 when we had lights out and the first cadet { our leading cadet
} took watch . Well around 11pm he woke me up because my duty watch was
at midnight . about that time we heard sounds like machinery running and
engineers working on the ship . We both heard it and woke up our commander
which he also heard the noises . All 3 of us walked from one end of the
ship to the other and we were the only group on board for the overnight
tour . As we got closer to the engineering area we could hear people working
on the equipment , but noone was in there also the main doors are sealed
. as we started getting chills up our spines we walked up towards the top
deck to see if anyone was playing pranks on us . but then we also felt
someone rush between us and we started hearing men screaming and in pain
. That lasted about 2 hours and i dont think all 3 of us got any sleep
after that . I have talked to a couple of people in boy scouts and employees
of the ship and they admitted to hearing freaky things also .</b><b></b>

<br><b>Visiting Cats?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Newswriter1@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I think my deceased cats come to visit every once in a while.</b>
<br><b>Two years ago, my oldest cat, Wizard, a black tabby mix, came down
with</b>
<br><b>diabetes. His weight dropped from 13 pounds to about 6. He spent
five days in</b>
<br><b>the kitty hospital, then my vet brought him home and told me how
to give him</b>
<br><b>insulin shots. He basically told me he was an in-door cat now. Well,
Wiz</b>
<br><b>would want to go out in the morning and he would go out the back
sliding</b>
<br><b>glass door and walk along the house to the front, where we have
two sliding</b>
<br><b>glass doors. The glass door near the house door is always locked,
unless</b>
<br><b>we're expecting friends, and the other door is cracked open about
nine inches</b>
<br><b>so the cats can come in and get out of the heat or rain. It's kind
of an</b>
<br><b>elongated patio. Where the opened sliding glass door is, there is
a huge</b>
<br><b>saguaro cactus and it's impossible for a person to get in that way.
Also,</b>
<br><b>even if it's very windy outside, it never rattles the wrought iron
screen</b>
<br><b>door, which is in front of the wooden door.</b>
<br><b>I also have diabetes and I thought it was kind of funny being a
diabetic girl</b>
<br><b>with a diabetic cat. Anyway, one Friday my husband and I came home
from work</b>
<br><b>at my request. We usually go out and have a couple beers, but I
felt like</b>
<br><b>going home. My husband was working on the computer and I was watching
TV. I</b>
<br><b>noticed Wizard hadn't come out to greet us and after an hour I went
to look</b>
<br><b>for him under the bed, one of his favorite places to sleep since
he became</b>
<br><b>ill.</b>
<br><b>I took the flashlight and looked under the bed and he had wetted
himself and</b>
<br><b>was almost comatose. I yelled for my husband and he pushed the mattresses
off</b>
<br><b>the bed to get to him. Wiz started convulsing and my husband called
our vet</b>
<br><b>and said we needed him right away (I have a vet that comes to your
house, he</b>
<br><b>has a mobile van, can do medical procedures in there, give you the
meds the</b>
<br><b>animals need and he's less expensive than going to a clinic. Also
less trauma</b>
<br><b>to the animal if they don't like being transported).</b>
<br><b>The doctor was there within 20 minutes. My husband and I had discussed</b>
<br><b>previously about putting him down because I was concerned about
his quality</b>
<br><b>of life. I've had my cats long before I met my husband. I made the
decision</b>
<br><b>to do so, even though I was torn if I was doing the right thing.
I thought of</b>
<br><b>the toll it was taking on me too, being at work and wondering if
he was</b>
<br><b>alright (if only I were a housewife!).</b>
<br><b>So Wizard went to the Rainbow Bridge.</b>
<br><b>I had three other cats, Troll-bug, Booga-Bear, and Nemmie. It's
routine when</b>
<br><b>they are outside and want to come in, they go to the front through
the</b>
<br><b>sliding glass door and take their paw, stick it in the screen on
the door and</b>
<br><b>bang it back and forth two or three times, signaling their servant
they want</b>
<br><b>in. You should see what the screen on the wrought iron door looks
like!</b>
<br><b>So, I had been home by myself and I heard the screen banging. I
went to the</b>
<br><b>door and no one was there. In the following weeks, this would happen
two or</b>
<br><b>three times a week. There was no wind blowing, I mean nothing can
disturb</b>
<br><b>that wrought iron door because everything is closed off. I told
my husband</b>
<br><b>about it and I said I thought it was Wizard. One night we were watching
TV</b>
<br><b>together and we heard the rattle and thought it was one of the cats.
He got</b>
<br><b>up to let the cat in and nothing was there.</b>
<br><b>Last year, Troll-bug, my 14 year-old black cat, died. I found him
in the back</b>
<br><b>yard on the day before my birthday. I don't know how he died. He
was fine the</b>
<br><b>day before and he always slept by my side. I had gotten up several
times that</b>
<br><b>night to see if he was at the door, but he wasn't. Both cats are
cremated and</b>
<br><b>I have them side by side with a picture of them both on the bed
together.</b>
<br><b>They were buddies.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, we still get the mystery knocks. The last one happened just
a while</b>
<br><b>ago. My husband and I were watching the final episode of the second</b>
<br><b>"Survivor" show and we heard the banging at the door. At the commercial
my</b>
<br><b>husband went to use the restroom and I got up to get the door. No
one was</b>
<br><b>there.</b>
<br><b>As my husband was returning to watch the program, he headed toward
the front</b>
<br><b>door to let the cat in and I told him not to bother, no one was
there.</b>
<br><b>So we've both heard it.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, my girlfriend was taking me to lunch the day Troll passed.
I was</b>
<br><b>only working a half-day and was amazed I made it through that.&nbsp;
I asked her</b>
<br><b>if we could go to the Humane Society so I could have Troll cremated
and asked</b>
<br><b>her to carry the body because I couldn't. She's an animal caretaker.&nbsp;
I also</b>
<br><b>wanted to stop and look at the cats, so we did.</b>
<br><b>The next day, a Saturday, my husband took me out to breakfast and
I asked to</b>
<br><b>go to the Humane Society because I saw a kitten I really liked.
He was a tiny</b>
<br><b>guy with a loud meow. I picked him and while I was filling out the
paperwork,</b>
<br><b>John came out into the lobby and yelled "We're getting two!" When
he was</b>
<br><b>holding Little Guy, my baby, the kitten next to him reached out
his paws to</b>
<br><b>the other kitten and John melted.</b>
<br><b>Both cats are black like the two we lost. It's eerie, but Leggo,
the kitten</b>
<br><b>my husband picked, reminds us a lot like Troll-bug. He has the same
sleek,</b>
<br><b>panther build and he's a hunter. We even wonder if he's reincarnated.
I have</b>
<br><b>a number of friends who say if they are reincarnated, they want
to come back</b>
<br><b>as one of our cats.</b>
<br><b>So I don't know if you can use this or not, but my feelings won't
be hurt.</b>
<br><b>Feel free to edit or if you have any other questions, just let me
know. And</b>
<br><b>by the way, this isn't the best example of my writing, but I am
a journalist.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Voices in the Night</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: papajohn72@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was never a real believer in ghosts or hauntings
until I was stationed in England during the early 70's.&nbsp; I was an
Air Force Security Policeman, assigned to the Weapon Storage area.&nbsp;
The base that I was station at was a B-17 bomber base during WWII.&nbsp;
On this particular night I was assigned to a sentry tower that was on the
perimeter of the weapons storage area.&nbsp; The security tower was approximately
35 feet off the ground and it was an old WWII guard tower that had been
used when the weapons storage area was a prisoner of war camp during WWII.&nbsp;
The tower had two search lights on top that turned 180 degrees to either
side.&nbsp; So here I am sitting in my tower all alone, trying to stay
awake, when I heard the voice.&nbsp; The voice came from somewhere outside
of the security fence.&nbsp; I heard "hey you, up in the tower".&nbsp;
I got up from my chair and used the search lights to see if I could see
anyone.&nbsp; The area outside of my tower was a very large field with
no obstructions.&nbsp; I didn't see anyone so I went back to my chair.&nbsp;
A few minutes later I heard the voice again.&nbsp; So I got up and began
to search the area again with the search lights, and I saw nothing.&nbsp;
Well enough was enough, I started thinking that some of my SP buddies was
playing a prank on me.&nbsp; So I called to the Entry Control Point and
asked the Entry Controller where the two mobile teams were.&nbsp; The E/C
advised me that both mobile teams were in the E/C playing cards.&nbsp;
That's when I let them know that someone was yelling outside of my tower.&nbsp;
Both mobile patrols responded to my location and made a check of the area,
but found nothing.&nbsp; After the mobile patrol units left I heard the
voice a few more times.&nbsp; Until this day it remains a mystery of where
this voice was coming.from.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this same area on a different night in the
same tower, I heard what sounded like several children laughing and playing.&nbsp;
I used my search light again to check the field out and nothing was there.&nbsp;
This time I didn't call anyone to come check it out.&nbsp; But I later
learned from other guys who had been stationed there a lot longer than
me who had also heard the children laughing, they told me that many years
ago their was a train crash.&nbsp; On this train were several school children
who died in the crash.&nbsp; It was said that every so often the ghost
of these dead children would come out to play.</b><b></b>

<p><b>"What A Child Sees"</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Prtybrowneyes01@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Well this didnt happen to me, it actually was told to me by my step
sister.</b>
<br><b>Her mother, her older sister, niece and her moved into this old
house a</b>
<br><b>couple of years ago.&nbsp; While being there her niece, Taylor,
(who was only 5)</b>
<br><b>told her mother that a man was watching them from the hall...(and
there were</b>
<br><b>no men in the house living with them) but her mother didnt see anything
and</b>
<br><b>thought nothing of it. Then when they were all sitting in the living
room,</b>
<br><b>pictures of my step mother's parents would fly into the middle of
the room</b>
<br><b>and fall.&nbsp; They moved out of the house about a week later.</b>
<br><b>Another thing happened with Taylor...about 20 years ago, my step
mother had a</b>
<br><b>baby that died in a fire. Her name was Angela.&nbsp; Supposedly
my two twin step</b>
<br><b>sisters started the fire because they were playing with matches
in the</b>
<br><b>closet.&nbsp; Well the baby (Angela) died because they couldnt get
to her crib in</b>
<br><b>time.&nbsp; Well about the same time as the other hauntings....Taylors
mom her her</b>
<br><b>talking to someone.&nbsp; Her mother asked Taylor what she was doing
and taylor</b>
<br><b>said that auntie Angie was playing dolls with her.&nbsp; And then
taylor said to</b>
<br><b>her mother that auntie Angie wanted her to know that it wasnt her
fault for</b>
<br><b>the fire and that she forgave her.&nbsp; (the most chilling part
of the story is</b>
<br><b>that no one ever talks about Angela because it is still to hard
for them to</b>
<br><b>think about, and so Taylor wasnt suppose to know)</b><b></b>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>What I Saw!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: a witness and believer</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>First of all let me say that I have always believed in spirits,
and have felt</b>
<br><b>several while only seeing just one.</b>
<br><b>I lived with my husband, 2 sons and a daughter. My husband worked
3rd shift</b>
<br><b>so it was left to me and my oldest son ( 16) to watch over the house
so to</b>
<br><b>speak.</b>
<br><b>This particular night he wanted to spend the night with a friend,
and it</b>
<br><b>being on a weekend it wasnt a problem. The only people there were
my daughter</b>
<br><b>and my youngest son.&nbsp; My son was asleep on the couch and my
daughter sitting</b>
<br><b>next to him watching tv with me. My chair was on the other side
of the room,</b>
<br><b>and for some reason, I still dont know why but, I looked down the
hallway and</b>
<br><b>at the end of the hallway right by my bedroom door I saw him. I
was frozen,</b>
<br><b>couldnt move or speak, just in total shock. He was about 5" 10"
thin to</b>
<br><b>medium build, but more on the thin side, gray hair, and had on these
what</b>
<br><b>looked like work pants, shirt, and suspenders.&nbsp; I dont know
how long I looked</b>
<br><b>at him, but it didnt seem too long, then I yelled for my daughter
to come</b>
<br><b>over to me. She did and was screaming, " Whats the matter?" I pointed
to the</b>
<br><b>hallway and asked if she saw him.&nbsp; She said no, and I looked
and he was gone.</b>
<br><b>I started shaking and she asked me what I saw, I told her and it
was then</b>
<br><b>that she said that she had a feeling of being watched at times.
Now, I had</b>
<br><b>the same feeling numerous times, and there were times I would put
something</b>
<br><b>down on the kitchen counter, go back a couple of seconds later,
and it would</b>
<br><b>be moved. No one else was in the kitchen with me.</b>
<br><b>Needless to say we all slept in the same bed that night for my husband
to</b>
<br><b>come home and find. He didnt believe me, and has never believed
in spirits or</b>
<br><b>ghosts. He kidded me a lot about it, and one night he said " Fine
if you are</b>
<br><b>here, then show me."&nbsp; About that time the remote controls flew
up in the air,</b>
<br><b>to the side then fell.&nbsp; My husband looked at me then down at
the controls on</b>
<br><b>the floor, and just got real quiet. Now of course I just had to
ask him what</b>
<br><b>made them do that, just to get his reaction. He finally admitted
he didnt</b>
<br><b>know, and later on that night he supposed there were just things
as ghosts.</b>
<br><b>There were times that the presence was protective and at other times,
seemed</b>
<br><b>to be somewhat mean. We do not live there any longer. The last time
I saw him</b>
<br><b>he was leaning over my bed peering down at me, and that was enough
for me to</b>
<br><b>decide it was time to move.</b>

<p><b>What Was It?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SUVLAKO@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happened to me, personally, back in 1990. I had a friend who's
house was</b>
<br><b>"different" from others, it was haunted. I haven't read your story
yet, but</b>
<br><b>something you said on your page made me feel that you would understand
me</b>
<br><b>when I say that I always thought it would be "soooo cool" to see
a ghost or</b>
<br><b>something of that ilk. Funny, when it actually happens it's not
very cool or</b>
<br><b>neat at all, but rather terrifying. The other thing I was real suprised
about</b>
<br><b>was how quickly the mind tries to force you to dismiss what you've
just</b>
<br><b>experienced, I guess it's a safety mechanism in the brain so some
don't go</b>
<br><b>nuts. I've always believed, ya know, I have always understood that
just</b>
<br><b>because it's not around all the time for me to see, that there is
another</b>
<br><b>reality all around me. I first got interested in the supernatural
from the</b>
<br><b>movie Amityville Horror, and thus lead me to the Warrens whom I'm
sure you</b>
<br><b>know of. I've read everything I could ever get my hands on by them
and others</b>
<br><b>that were accounts of true hauntings. When I read The Haunted, I
didn't sleep</b>
<br><b>for 2 days! Anyways, I digress, forgive me. My friend, when we were
seniors</b>
<br><b>in high school in 1986, began telling me of how strange things were
happening</b>
<br><b>in her house. This was before I really did alot of research on the
subject,</b>
<br><b>but did know a thing or 2. What was happening was that she had these
2 dogs,</b>
<br><b>on was a black Lab, the other a very old Shepard. The shepard was
just about</b>
<br><b>crippled by arthritis at this time, but sometimes would manage to
get up,</b>
<br><b>walk down a hallway to the doorway that lead into the family room,
and would</b>
<br><b>just howl and bark until he foamed at the mouth. The other dog would
do the</b>
<br><b>same, but since he wasn't experiencing almost complete paralisis,
it didn't</b>
<br><b>seem that big a deal, ya know? Anyways, the shepard would have all
his fur on</b>
<br><b>end also. I know animals are sensitive to these things, and this
is what I</b>
<br><b>told her jokingly, that she must have a ghost or something that
the dogs are</b>
<br><b>seeing. It was the first of many stories to come. My friend, her
younger</b>
<br><b>brother and mom would often go shopping at record stores, as all
were very</b>
<br><b>avid music fans, and after having breakfast, after cleaning up every
dish,</b>
<br><b>all the food and putting everything away (that was rule #1 in that
household,</b>
<br><b>everything must be washed, dryed and put away before doing anything
else,</b>
<br><b>absolutely NO exceptions!), they'd all go to their rooms and start
getting</b>
<br><b>ready for their shopping adventures. My friend always managed to
get the</b>
<br><b>bathroom first, and this one day was no exception. She had been
drying her</b>
<br><b>hair when there was a banging on the bathroom door. She yelled at
her</b>
<br><b>brother, whom she figured was pounding for her to hurry up, that
she's almost</b>
<br><b>done. The pounding continued and as you can guess, when she opened
the door,</b>
<br><b>nobody was there. Her brother was on his bedroom phone, and her
mom was</b>
<br><b>watching the tv in her room, she let it pass. I personally would
have packed</b>
<br><b>up and moved the heck away, but that's because I am not dumb about
ghosts!</b>
<br><b>Anyhoo, she finished in the bathroom, she asked her mom and brother
if they'd</b>
<br><b>been knocking, they said no. When they were leaving out the front
door, her</b>
<br><b>mom forgot her keys on the kitchen counter, so my friend went back
to get</b>
<br><b>them, what she saw scared the crap out of her, she called her mom
and brother</b>
<br><b>into the kitchen and showed them the sink. In the sink was all the
dishes,</b>
<br><b>silverware and glassware that had been used at breakfast, dirty
and all. Her</b>
<br><b>mom tried at first to blame it on her, she was convinced that my
friend was</b>
<br><b>playing a joke on her. But my friend pointed out that the stuff
was unclean,</b>
<br><b>how could she have done that in like 2 seconds? Her mom had no answer
for</b>
<br><b>that. They just went shopping and didn't talk about it again. My
friend would</b>
<br><b>hear footsteps and see things out of the corner of her eye, feel
cold spots,</b>
<br><b>ect. All very usual haunted house stuff. So we did some research,
very</b>
<br><b>limited mind you, but we found out that not only was it a place
where Indians</b>
<br><b>either left their sick to die, or left them as they died, I cannot
remember</b>
<br><b>anymore, but back in the 20's and 30's the mafia dumped dead bodies
all along</b>
<br><b>where her house was. We live a Chicago suburb, I'm sure you can
gather who</b>
<br><b>the "mobster" must have been. I'm thinking it wasn't so much the
Indian stuff</b>
<br><b>as the mafia dumping the dead bodies. Anyways, we graduated high
school, she</b>
<br><b>met a guy and moved in with him. She stayed with him for about a
year and</b>
<br><b>ended the relationship. Her parents, who are strange to begin with,
didn't</b>
<br><b>allow her back into their home for 6 weeks, just to make sure she
wouldn't go</b>
<br><b>running back to her abusive ex. She stayed with me for the 6 weeks.
Let me</b>
<br><b>say that I never seen anything or ever experienced anything supernatural
in</b>
<br><b>my house. Ok, when she moved back home, there was a new order of
things,</b>
<br><b>first of all her brother had decided that drugs and drinking were
just fun</b>
<br><b>and dandy and participated in both as often as possible and would
come home</b>
<br><b>at like 5 am almost every night. The other new thing was her parents
had</b>
<br><b>taken up camping on the weekends, so she was home alone from Friday
morning</b>
<br><b>until Sunday evening. For a couple of weeks she said she noticed
strange</b>
<br><b>things happening again, it was beginning to scare her and would
I please</b>
<br><b>spend the weekend with her. In my ignorance, I said SURE, NO PROBLEM!
Big</b>
<br><b>mistake! She had been describing seeing something in her room at
night, I</b>
<br><b>snickered at her when she described it to me, about 3 feet tall,
hooded with</b>
<br><b>red glowing eyes, it could also grow as tall as the ceiling. I laughed
out</b>
<br><b>loud at her! I did! When I spent the night with her after she had
asked me</b>
<br><b>too, we goofed around, listened to music and watched a little MTV
before bed.</b>
<br><b>I wrote in a journal at that time, and I was a bit shocked that
while writing</b>
<br><b>I felt a coldness that wasn't there a second before that. I ignored
it, I was</b>
<br><b>sitting close to the bedroom windows and figured it was just a draft.
One</b>
<br><b>thing that sticks out in my mind like a beacon is the fact that
we had been</b>
<br><b>drinking cranberry juice that evening, at first it was real good,
but (and</b>
<br><b>this was after I felt the cold "draft") all of a sudden it had gotten
very</b>
<br><b>bitter, not it's natural "sourness" either. We gagged and went to
the kitchen</b>
<br><b>to dump it out, washed the glasses, put them away and threw out
the empty</b>
<br><b>bottle it came in. Ok, we went to bed around 12:30ish, I kept looking
around</b>
<br><b>the darkened room, joking that I didn't see any ghosts yet! I wasn't
laughing</b>
<br><b>for long, 'cos the 3rd time I looked, there was the hooded figure
with the</b>
<br><b>glowing red eyes in the corner. At first I made sure it wasn't her
clock</b>
<br><b>radio, her clock radio was blue anyways, so that theory went out
the window.</b>
<br><b>Speaking of out the window, her room was on the second floor and
I seriously</b>
<br><b>considered jumping out the window! The hooded figure started moving
towards</b>
<br><b>the bed, of course it was on my side of the room, I asked her to
look to see</b>
<br><b>if this was what she'd been seeing, she's like "yep, that's it alright",
I</b>
<br><b>made her change sides with me. I lived under the covers for the
rest of the</b>
<br><b>night, I called my mom crying and begging her to help me get out
of the</b>
<br><b>house, she laughed and said that this joke was unfunny. (she believes
me now)</b>
<br><b>Anyhoo, I was shaking so hard that the bed moved! I have never been
that</b>
<br><b>afraid in my life, before or since! When the sun came up, I braved
a glance</b>
<br><b>out from under the sheets, it was gone. I jumped up and got dressed.
She was</b>
<br><b>getting dressed and coming with me too. She then said, "uh, look
at my</b>
<br><b>dresser Liz." I did, our glasses of juice were there still with
the juice in</b>
<br><b>them! I ran out of that f*****g house as fast as I could, I forgot
everything</b>
<br><b>that I had brought with me and made her go back in by herself to
retrieve</b>
<br><b>them for me. On the way home my mind was working overtime to get
me to</b>
<br><b>"rationalize" everything that had happened, but I finally said "no,
it</b>
<br><b>happened, I saw it with my own eyes!" From that day on I never spent
the</b>
<br><b>night over there, and she begged me every week! She even told me
one week</b>
<br><b>that she'd give me 1,000.00 to stay with her or to let her stay
with me, too</b>
<br><b>bad a couple of days before that she mentioned that she'd seen that
thing in</b>
<br><b>my house when staying with us those 6 weeks! Wait, I should have
mentioned</b>
<br><b>that she had gone home to speak with her parents when she started
staying</b>
<br><b>with me for those 6 weeks, I've wondered if this is how that thing
followed</b>
<br><b>her to my house? One night we were on the phone and she started
crying, she</b>
<br><b>said there was noise coming from the family room. Now this night
her parents</b>
<br><b>were both home and so was her brother, so she wasn't alone. She
was like</b>
<br><b>"can't you hear it? It's so loud!" I said no, but no sooner had
I said no</b>
<br><b>that I heard this.....moan....but to call it a moan doesn't even
begin to</b>
<br><b>describe the sound! Imagine a demon being tortured and screaming,
it was</b>
<br><b>closer to how I would think that sounds. It was so loud that I had
to pull</b>
<br><b>the phone from my ear, and it woke my mom up! She was like, what
the hell is</b>
<br><b>that? I said yes, it's hell mom. My mom don't go for this stuff,
it scares</b>
<br><b>her way too much. She didn't sleep for a week after hearing this
sound, and</b>
<br><b>thankfully she made me get off the phone! I remember hearing that
sound, the</b>
<br><b>tears coming to my eyes, my stomache dropping and knotting up, my
heart</b>
<br><b>feeling like it was going to explode. I didn't sleep for a week
either! Funny</b>
<br><b>thing is, nobody in her house heard a thing, not her parents, her
brother or</b>
<br><b>the dogs, but it was loud enough to be heard over the phone and
wake my mom</b>
<br><b>out of a sound sleep. I sort of stopped talking to her after that,
about half</b>
<br><b>a year after that. Stuff kept happening to her in that house and
all, but we</b>
<br><b>just grew apart. Actually, she started telling my best friend lies
about me</b>
<br><b>so she could go live with her and get out of that house. I got mad
at her and</b>
<br><b>have never spoken to her again. And trust me, it wasn't anything
in that</b>
<br><b>house that made her lie, she was born doing that!</b>
<br><b>Well, that's my story, sorry it was so long. I was wondering if
you have any</b>
<br><b>idea what that thing is called that I saw? When I saw it, it was
only about 3</b>
<br><b>feet tall, hooded and had the glowing red eyes. Why did it follow
her to my</b>
<br><b>home and back to her families home? Like I said before, I never
saw anything</b>
<br><b>supernatural in my house. Her house was blessed, her family was
rather</b>
<br><b>religious, going to church and all, but they were nuts I tell you.
They'd</b>
<br><b>stab the other in the back to get what they want. I've gone past
that house</b>
<br><b>since, the family's gone btw, and it still gives me the chills!
Any help</b>
<br><b>would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance, I'll stop babbling</b>
<br><b>now......</b><b></b>

<p><b>One Good, One Not!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ukicarus@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My girlfriend and I moved into that apartment in September 1998,
and weird</b>
<br><b>things started to happen</b>
<br><b>almost immediately.&nbsp; Neither of us were scared because in the
beginning,</b>
<br><b>these happenings were quite tame.&nbsp; Personal objects like keys,
wallets and</b>
<br><b>cell phones would mysteriously disappear, and after searching the
entire</b>
<br><b>apartment to look for them, we'd find them in the place we KNEW
they</b>
<br><b>should've been all along.&nbsp; This continued for about four months,
and</b>
<br><b>although it was rather annoying at times, we didn't pay much attention
to</b>
<br><b>it.</b>
<br><b>Just after New Year 1999, these events were stepped up a little.&nbsp;
We'd go to</b>
<br><b>bed at night and wake the following morning to discover ornaments
and</b>
<br><b>pictures in the front room had been moved and rearranged.&nbsp;
This was</b>
<br><b>happening almost on a nightly basis.&nbsp; When we came home from
work in the</b>
<br><b>late-afternoon, electrical appliances such as television, stereo,
CD player</b>
<br><b>and hair dryer were all switched on.&nbsp; Even when we had to resort
to</b>
<br><b>unplugging these appliances and switching off the main power supply
to the</b>
<br><b>house, we'd come home to find everything 'on'.&nbsp; But all these
weird</b>
<br><b>occurances only lasted a matter of weeks before other happenings
replaced</b>
<br><b>them.</b>
<br><b>By early Spring 1999, things were becoming quite freaky around the
place.</b>
<br><b>There were several 'cold' spots in the apartment.&nbsp; Not just
cold, I mean</b>
<br><b>freezing.&nbsp; Sometimes you were able to see your own breath,
and that's when</b>
<br><b>we started to become afraid.&nbsp; One Saturday afternoon while
I was alone in</b>
<br><b>the apartment, I actually witnessed furniture in the front room
rise about</b>
<br><b>three inches or so off the gruund and ever-so slowly move.&nbsp;
I don't know if</b>
<br><b>I was just fascinated or petrified, but I</b>
<br><b>stood and watched for almost an hour as the furniture moved around
me.&nbsp; When</b>
<br><b>I decided it was time to leave the room - as I feared my own safety
- the</b>
<br><b>door wouldn't open (even if it didn't have a lock).&nbsp; Out of
pure anger, I</b>
<br><b>shouted at whoever was doing this to stop and it did.&nbsp; As I
went to leave</b>
<br><b>the apartment, I heard crying coming from the living room.&nbsp;
Not like an</b>
<br><b>adult crying, but more like a child.&nbsp; I don't know why, but
I didn't feel</b>
<br><b>scared anymore and stayed.</b>
<br><b>That was the only time something like that happened, but still,
our playful</b>
<br><b>little ghost was still with us.&nbsp; It sounds stupid, | know,
but when weird</b>
<br><b>things started going on, I used to 'talk' to whoever was doing it.&nbsp;
I'd just</b>
<br><b>say 'he' was scaring us and would he stop.&nbsp; This worked every
time.&nbsp; Until</b>
<br><b>one night my girlfriend and I realised our 'little boy' as we referred
to</b>
<br><b>'it' as wasn't the only spirit in the house.</b>
<br><b>While my girlfriend was cooking dinner, she claims she felt 'someone'
touch</b>
<br><b>her on the shoulder.&nbsp; Thinking it was me who was just trying
to scare her,</b>
<br><b>my girlfriend didn't turn around.&nbsp; But she realised it wasn't
me because</b>
<br><b>whoever was doing it was 'stinking' of alcohol and cigarette smoke
(I don't</b>
<br><b>drink or smoke).&nbsp; When she felt uneasy, my girlfriend ran out
of the kitchen</b>
<br><b>and we both WATCHED as cooking utensils, food, plates and pots flew
into the</b>
<br><b>air as if 'someone' was throwing them.</b>
<br><b>This was too much for us, and we left the apartment and stayed the
night</b>
<br><b>with my parents.&nbsp; After speaking with a family friend, we got
in touch with</b>
<br><b>a very reputable spiritualist based in our town, and he came to
the</b>
<br><b>apartment the following day to 'help' us.&nbsp; It has to be said
that we gave</b>
<br><b>him NO information other than the place was haunted (nor did he
ask for a</b>
<br><b>fee either).&nbsp; As soon as the gentleman walked into the place,
he said he</b>
<br><b>sensed there was the spirit of a young boy.&nbsp; When the spiritualist
entered</b>
<br><b>the front room, he said he could sense the spirit of an old man
too.</b>
<br><b>To cut a long story short, the spiritualist 'talked' with both spirits.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>'young boy' said he wanted to 'move on', but the 'older man' wouldn't
let</b>
<br><b>him.&nbsp; This made 'him' upset.&nbsp; According to the spiritualist,
the older man</b>
<br><b>was very abusive and reluctant to communicate.&nbsp; After a while,
the</b>
<br><b>spiritualist 'contacted' a member of the 'young boy's' family and
she (an</b>
<br><b>aunt, I think) 'took' him</b>
<br><b>(if that's the right phrase).</b>
<br><b>A couple of weeks later, we got the opportunity to move to another</b>
<br><b>apartment, and we took it.&nbsp; When we were collecting the last
of our</b>
<br><b>belongings, the whole place stank of stale cigarette smoke.&nbsp;
But what really</b>
<br><b>scared us both was the loud evil laughing.&nbsp; I mean, even the
scariest horror</b>
<br><b>movie couldn't produce a terrifying laugh like that.&nbsp; And we
literally ran</b>
<br><b>out of the apartment.</b>
<br><b>Our experiences of living in that haunted apartment made me curious
more</b>
<br><b>than anything else, and I decided to do some research.&nbsp; According
to public</b>
<br><b>records, there was an old gentleman living there in the 1950s, and
died in</b>
<br><b>'57 in that apartment.&nbsp; Two years later, the then occupants
complained of a</b>
<br><b>'smell' coming from a cupboard.&nbsp; When the housing department
investigated,</b>
<br><b>the decomposing body of a young boy - about 7 years old - was found
behind a</b>
<br><b>'false' wall.&nbsp; I checked with police records, and to this day,
the identity</b>
<br><b>of the body remains unknown.&nbsp; After speaking with the spiritualist
again</b>
<br><b>earlier this year (2001), he told me he 'sensed' the old man had
killed the</b>
<br><b>boy, but didn't want to tell us should we have stayed.</b>
<br><b>There is one last bit to tell you:&nbsp; a friend of mine - who
knows nothing</b>
<br><b>about our experiences - works in the housing department that leases
that</b>
<br><b>property, and he told me (quite innocently) that the new tenants
have</b>
<br><b>complained about a lingering stench of alcohol and cigarette smoke.&nbsp;
Makes</b>
<br><b>you wonder...</b><b></b>

<p><b>Dinner Time</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: delaire@tournet.com.ar</b><b></b>
<p><b>It was lunch time. Seven members of my family, including me,&nbsp;
were having our meal in the kitchen when a terrible noise made us</b>
<br><b>look up just to catch a glimpse of what many people would call "a
ghost". The noise we'd first heard came from the sudden opening of the
yard's door (one metre from the kitchen itself) , which of course closed
back violently after hitting the wall at 90&deg;. The" white thing" didn't
go "trough" the door (as many films show), and what's more, it avoided
a huge TV set that was placed in the middle of the kitchen, opened a second
door with the same violence, making it close again with a strepituous noise
after hitting another wall at 90&deg; . All of us were panick-stricken
and couldn't utter a word. Suddenly, my aunt stood up and went to look
for the strange visitor behind the 2nd door, where the bedrooms are. Nothing
or nobody was there, just silence. When I describe this experience, it
sounds as if it had taken a considerable time to happen, but it was just
as quick as a ray of light. Something important I have forgotten to say
is that it was not windy that day, so I can't blame the weather for it.</b>
<br><b>From then on I've been trying to avoid going to that part of the
house where that "thing" vanished. I was 12 when I saw that thing, and
still after more than 20 years, it keeps bothering my mind. Sometimes I
think that perhaps it could have been my eagerness to have proves of God's
existence which made all that thing happen. When I was around 10 years
old I used to pray</b>
<br><b>to God for a sign of his world; perhaps that was a way to show me
he exists. I don't know. Some other times I associate the experience with
a dream I used to have: a witch in black coming down the stairs from the
roof, cross the yard while I was hiding under the kitchen table. But the
thing I saw when 12 was not black.&nbsp; It's difficult to find a logical
explanation, as much as it is to find professionals in the area. Something
easy to find is people who laugh at your experience, but I don't really
care, for I know I'm telling sth true; I just look at them and think "poor
people, they don't know what they're laughing at". People tend to refuse
what they can't understand, so I understand those who just laugh or don't
believe in ghosts.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Ghost Dressed in Black</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: shell310@paralynx.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was about 7 years old my parents, 5 brothers, and one sister
moved into a</b>
<br><b>large five bedroom house on a farm.&nbsp; Shortly after I started
seeing a small</b>
<br><b>child-like image visiting me at night time. It would come and just
sit on the</b>
<br><b>edge of my bed and watch me until I fell asleep.&nbsp; It was greyish
in color but</b>
<br><b>not solid.&nbsp; I could not tell if it was male or female.&nbsp;
Other times a tall man</b>
<br><b>dressed all in black would come to my bedroom and just stand in
the middle of</b>
<br><b>the room and watch me also.&nbsp; I would get really scared when
I would see him.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>had a feeling he was there to scare me.&nbsp; At night I would lay
awake and watch to</b>
<br><b>see what would happen.&nbsp; these two "spirits" would never appear
at the same time.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;This went on for about nine years.&nbsp; Then I moved out
on my own.&nbsp; Shortly after</b>
<br><b>I was on my own,&nbsp; I continued to see the tall man dressed in
black.&nbsp; His</b>
<br><b>presence scared the crap out of me for some reason.&nbsp; For ten
years after that he</b>
<br><b>continued to visit me on regular basis.&nbsp; About once a week.&nbsp;
I felt like he was</b>
<br><b>trying to tell me something and got angry when I would not address
him.&nbsp; I would</b>
<br><b>try to ignore him and hide under my blankets.&nbsp; It wasn't till
13 years after I</b>
<br><b>first witnessed the apparition that I went to a physiatrist for
help.&nbsp; In fact I</b>
<br><b>went to a few.&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp; my doctor put me on medication
for&nbsp; schizophrenia.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>haven't had a problem with that spirit since.&nbsp; Although ocassionally
I do see</b>
<br><b>other spirits "floating around".&nbsp; But I am happy that he is

<br><b>A Strange, Not So Scary Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:sgc256@qwest.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This experience didn't happen to me but it happened to a close friend
of mine.&nbsp; I used to live in Sierra Vista, a small town near Tombstone,
Arizona.&nbsp; Tombstone is a ghost town with a lot of paranormal activity.&nbsp;
My friend was sitting on the Charleston Bridge which is supposedly haunted.&nbsp;
There are two bridges one is old and made of wood so they closed it and
the other is, of course, new and made of cement.&nbsp; He and his friends
were drinking and a girl that was with them looked at the old bridge and
said "Hey who hung up the new tire swing under old Charleston Bridge?"
and they just thought she was imagining things.&nbsp; So they passed it
off as nothing all except my friend.&nbsp; He suddenly felt a cold breeze
on what was a hot summer day.&nbsp; The sudden change in temperature made
him feel uncomfortable so he decided to go home.&nbsp; The next day he
heard that someone had been hung suspended in the MIDDLE of the old Charleston
Bridge.&nbsp; The unusual thing is:&nbsp; How were they hung in the middle?&nbsp;
There were only two ways to get to the middle of the bridge and that was
climbing on top of the bridge and going underneath which couldn't have
happened because the night was so bright they would have seen someone.&nbsp;
The second way was if they were hoisted from the river bank up towards
the bridge.&nbsp; It was so dark under the bridge they wouldn't have seen
anyone if they were underneath.&nbsp; My friend was at the bridge from
dusk until midnight.&nbsp; The person died somewhere between 10 and 12
that night.&nbsp; In retrospect my friend was there while that person died.&nbsp;
The cops passed it off as a suicide but using common sense we know better.</b>
