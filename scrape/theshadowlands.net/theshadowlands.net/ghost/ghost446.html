Back in the late 70's I took the same route home I had done for many
years.&nbsp; I had been visisting my grandparents in Gallatin
Tennessee.&nbsp; I was travling on old highway 41 which runs from
Springfield Tenn. to Gurthrie Kentucky.&nbsp; It goes through Adams
Tennessee which is well know for the Bell Witch.&nbsp; At this point in
my life the rumors of the witch weren't as well pronounces as it is
today. It was dark by the time I got to Adams so there weren't any
folks out and about so when I saw a little girl standing along side the
road I was shocked, after passing her I recalled to my self that she
was pale and all dressed in green.&nbsp; I could even remember the type
shoes she was wearing high tops with buttons down the side.&nbsp; For
many years my grandfather was in the shoe repair business and he had
some like it in his store window for shoe.&nbsp; Her dress was ruffled
with lace and she wore a bonnet that was also green.&nbsp; The girl was
pale in the face and she did not smile she just stood there.&nbsp; I
got an errie feeling about her.&nbsp; Later in years my sister and I
were reading The Bellwitch of Adams a childrens book we had gotten at
the library.&nbsp; As she started to read the part where the witch was
swing with Betsy Bell she read what the witch was wearing and she
discribed the girl I had seen on the side of the road that night. As of
this day I will not go through Adams at night in fear of seeing the
girl again.<br>

Crab House<br>
<br>
<br>
By: carlosgirl12@sbcglobal.net<br>
<br>
Bob Chin's Crab House in Wheeling, IL is suppose to be haunted. During
prohibition, before it was a resturant, Al Capone and other mobsters
use to hang out upstairs in the different rooms they have. Well one of
the waitresses or women that was with the group of mobsters in the
front room got shot. She made them mad or something or other and they
shot her. According to a family friend who is the niece of Bob Chin and
worked there; when waitresses and bartenders now leave when the place
closes at wround 12-1 in the morning, you can see her sitting in the
window watching everyone. Also if you go up in that room, you can see
her blood all over the wall. Bob Chin had people paint over it, take
down the old wallpaper..everything, but the blood keeps coming through.
When the resturant was first opened, you could hear footsteps from
above, people making noise and it sounded like someone was throwing a
hissy fit when the painting in the room started anc such like that. Bob
Chin had a psychic come into the room...the psychic was told that she
would leave the restuarant alone if they left her room the way it was
and wouldn't set foot in there again. No one has since in honor of her.
They don't bother her and she does the same. No one is allowed to do
any type of research or hunt or EVP session due to the agreement that
Bob Chin made. He plans on honoring this until he passes the resturant
to his kin or whoever he passes it to and is making sure that they do
the same. Like I said..this is from a close family friend who has
expierenced this first hand..how accurate the story behind it is, I
have no clue.<br>

Bremerton, WA experience.<br>
<br>
By: Krycek7530@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Greetings! My name is Eric and I am a property manager in Bremerton,
WA. I reside in the townhouses that have previously been under
management of my family for the last 25 years or so.<br>
&nbsp;A year or so ago, my friend and I started to notice a lot of
creaking in the house, which is pretty normal in any building, but
after a while there seemed to be patterns and some odd occurences that
happened along with them. At first, it was kind of a joke and we gave
the ghost a name, Robert, suggesting that it may have been a spirit of
former roomates lover who passed away. (who I caught him talking to on
occassion). I kept looking in the house to see if there was something
of Roberts in the house. To this day, there are a few items that I know
my roomate left here that may have been Roberts.<br>
I have always studied the paranormal, since i was a kid I wanted to be
a parapsychologist. As I grew older, I became very skeptical, but
longed for that kind of realm to exsist. I still do believe it exsists
and am trying to understand it, to this day.<br>
After a while, Robert, became less and less of a joke. He seemed to be
highly active when anyone in addition to my female friend and I being
there. Her fiance, at the time, would come by and hear the footsteps
moving across the floor and to the top of the stairs. It sounded like
someone hurrying sometimes, and at others a slower pace. In fact one
time, I was walking my friend to the door after some creaks, and the
creaking continued closer to the top of the stairs, down them, and we
both felt something by the door. It was hard to explain, but she ran
out and said that I could deal with the ghost.<br>
A few months had gone by and the creaking was a constant: loud when I
had company over (especially males), seemed more intense the few times
when my friends would argue. A few of them even claimed to have some
pressure on them, like a fingertip. They were quiet when it happened
and when it was over the looked over to me as if I would have some
explanation. A few times whispering was heard in a friends ear and once
we both heard a young child talking outside but there was no one up or
out there at the time. <br>
My female friend worked with a former tenant and figured that we all
knew each other. She said she is there all the time at my place. He
said that was his favorite place to live.....and then paused, asking my
friend if we had ever expirienced any paranormal activity here!!!! He
claimed that a small black child would come into his room at night and
poke him until he would wake up. Alllegedly while this was happening, a
seperate force was pressing on his bedroom door. Funny enough, a few
months later, and I dont know how else to explain it, but when I was
clearing out my guest room I could smell a very distinct smell: (dont
know how else to say it, but it smelled like a poor black family's
house....sweet, yet foul). It was the strangest thing and the minute I
smelled it, I knew what it was.....or what I thought it was...the young
black boy.<br>
Well most of the activity seemed to be in my bedroom. I remember that
night i was moving all of that stuff around there was a chair next to
my bed and for some reason (and I dont act on these urges often) I
swore there was someone sitting in that chair. So sure, that I had to
move the chair away from my bed because I felt like someone was sitting
there staring at me.<br>
So, for the most part there were only personal experience on my part
and about three other friends. The part that convinced me was the
reactions of two individuals to my house. First, my friends dog hangs
out in my house all the time. I invited him upstairs for the first
time. He poked his head in the bathroom, the guest room, and walked
around and then I let him into my room. He took one step in and turned,
running downstairs to his master. The second, my friends 2 yr old son
always wants to "see the man" at my house. I entertained the idea and
showed him the upstairs. Again, looked in the bathroom and said he
wasnt there. Looked into my guest room and he said he wasnt there.
Finally, he went into my room and asked where he was. Then he started
looking around my room as if he was sure he was SOMEWHERE in there.
Finally I went to my closet and slid it open. He looked up and paused,
and then he tripped overhimself trying to get out of the way as if
someone was running out of the closet. I asked him about the man and he
said " hes black and white and black and red". When he was leaving with
his mother, apparantly he was waving to my upstairs window, saying BYE
to the man. Still to this day, he asks about the man and tries to look
for him, still describing him as black white, black and red.<br>
Im not sure if it's even real, but there are some consistencies that
lead me to believe that it is entirely possible for this place to be
haunted. And above all, maybe its the whole building....my friend's
friend lived 5 units down. My neighbor says it sounds like people are
walking upstairs and tenants are making some noise complaints that
arent making much sense. I understand floorboards get creaky and kids
have imaginations, but just when I think its in my head, i find the
candy i have thrown down arranged by color in a circle on my coffee
table, or i am missing something and days later, I find it next to
something like my lamp, that I use everyday......how could I have not
seen it when I am looking so hard and it ends up next to a switch i use
3 or 4 times a day????<br>
On a side note, I am at a great location.....Holland Rd is right down
the way as well as the Bremerton Community theater, both claiming to be
haunted.<br>
I have a video also that I have taken of a possible ghost, but I am
kind of keeping that to myself right now, while I analyze it some more.
I have shown some friends and family and it knocks their socks off!!!<br>

Now with that said I have a story to go along with my info. Back when I
was a teenager a bunch of us would get together and have parties on the
road next to the cemetery. We never went inside the cemetery showing
some respect to those who were there. <br>
One summer night there were about six of us still hanging out waiting
for our fire to go out, it was some where between one and two in the
morninig. The fire was still burning good but you could not feel the
heat from it and it felt like it started to get colder. Everything
around us seemed to get real quite and the hair on the back of my neck
stood up giving me a chill. A couple of my friends thought they saw
something in the cemetery but weren't sure. We put the fire out and
left, that was the only night that I ever felt like something was
there. <br>
As far as the other two sights you have listed, I went to school at
Hindsdale and and Suckerbrook Dam was another one of our hang outs and
I have never seen or heard anything at either location.<br>
Thank you for having an interesting web sight, I enjoyed visiting it and will be back again.<br>

I have Several Ghost Stories<br>
<br>
<br>
By: composerk1993@yahoo.com<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
This is the first ghost experience Ive had. <br>
I was about 5-6 yo at that time and i was at my grandmother's house. Her house is over 100 yo.<br>
I was watching my older cousin "playing" a broken down piano when my
brother called me in to listen to a song on his Lion King cd.<br>
Well, after listening to the song I was running back to the piano down the hall.<br>
Halfway down the long hall is an old cabinet and I saw a transparent figure appear peeking from behind it.<br>
I stopped stunned and stared for a while at the figure. I could tell
that is was a bald male. It looked like It had Chemotherapy- sickly
looking, very&nbsp; depressed in a way.<br>
I blinked and It was gone. It is amazing that I can remember it well
way back then because I could hardly remember what happened last month.
Ive had&nbsp; many other&nbsp; encounters&nbsp; but after&nbsp; praying
to&nbsp; God to take away the ability last year, I haven't really had
many since last year.<br>

Something Strange<br>
<br>
<br>
By: shdbbs@charter.net <br>
<br>
&nbsp;A few years back my family and I lived in a very old house in a
really old town. This was Jackson Michigan where everything there is
very old.We searched and searched and found a house that we all liked
it was big and off my room there was a loft type thing i guess you
would call it and down stairs separating the kitchen from the living
room there were french style doors. the wierd thing was the number of
the house was 612 Oak street. You put two and two together 6&amp;6
equal 12....Well we all started getting comfortable in our new place
and then things started to happen. For instance at night time my mom
would come in my room and ask, hey are you alright i said yeah why? She
swore up and down that i would be screaming for her. It wasnt long
after this that i started hearing loud footsteps coming up the stairs
creeking. I kind of had the attitude that i didnt really care unless it
tried to hurt any of us so i just ignored it from time to time, but i
dont think it liked that much i think it wanted to be noticed. We
started leaving durring the hot summer days and making sure everything
was locked and turned off. We would arrive back at home in the late
afternoon.We noticed from outside the lights being on inside the home
and thought that maybe someone had broken in. My dad decided to go in
first and realized the tv was on the lights were on the sterio was
playing pretty loud and we couldnt figure out why nothing was stolen or
tampered with other than they were just on..After this would happen so
often we started expecting it really. None of us were really afraid we
figured there is more reason to be afraid of living people rather than
a spirit. A couple weeks later we were all sitting down in the kitchen
eating dinner when this horrible bang, crash, boom came from down our
basement steps and we were thinking that boy that really sounded like
someone just busted our basement window out. My dad says, stay back to
my mom and I grab the phone and get ready to call 911 if anything
happens so we did so. My dad comes up and says well thats strange there
is no basement window and all that is down there is a lot of cardboard
boxes, nothing that could have made the noise. Again we really had no
where else to go so we stayed. The noises kept happening along with
other strange instances, but to this day I have to wonder why this
spirit still remains there and who when and why it may have wanted to
stay.<br>

Woolworths<br>
<br>
By: Chrissieb2002@aol.com<br>
<br>
Hi I work in Woolworth , back in February I walked into my aisle in the
stockroom and saw a glowing ball bouncing up and down from the far end
up to me and back.<br>
The following week I saw the same thing 3 times in the next aisle to
me, again "bouncing" up and down the aisle, nobody believed me, I was
so scared and couldn't even face going to the stockroom on my own, I
even considered leaving!<br>
My next move was to take a friend who worked with me and is a
nonbeliever to the stockroom and take photo's of each aisle with the
lights on then off, the photo you see is of my aisle in the dark, at
the time of taking the photo I did not see it, however it was there
when I viewed it on my digital camera, people still think it's just a
trick of the light, however I know different.<br>
I still work there and am very nervous when going up alone, but I do it.<br>
It's not the first time I've "seen" things I saw a woman in a previous
place of work and she looked solid and smiled at me before vanishing.<br>

Beaumont TX<br>
<br>
By: mizzou_sweetheart@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Hi , I do need to tell ya I have enjoyed the many experiance ppl have
wrote about on here. Just thought I would send ya all another one of
mine! Back in 1980 my mother (Chris ) had been dating a trucker(Tom),I
was so excited that I was going to get to ride in an 18 wheeler! He
decided that he would let my mom and I ride with him to Beaumont ,Tx .
When we got down there,we stayed with some friends of his while he went
to drop off his load. He told us he would be back in 3 days. The first
night was uneventful, then the second night came and his friends all
went out ,Mom and I and one other girl stayed at the house. We were
watching tv when I heard what seem to be a heartbeat (thump thump thump
thump!) I kept listening when I turned around mom and this other girl
just had a look of being scared on their faces . I didn't say anything.
just covered up my head and went to sleep! The third night came and
again the friends went out but this time just Mom and I stayed at the
house .we was sitting there talking when we heard this heartbeat sound
again then we looked at the kitchen where the sound was heard, which ya
could see from the livingroom, The front of the stove lit up with this
face that looked like it was on fire and we heard someone say 'GET
OUT!' it didn't take us long .We got the Hell out of there . mom called
her boyfriend from a lil store down the road, he told us to stay there
till he got there he was about an hour away ! well when we got in the
truck , her b/f took us back to that house the next morning to talk to
his friends, and the friends started to tell us the story of the old
house, it appears back in the late 1800s a couple was killed in that
house and that they was burried in the basement .they said the last
owners had found this out when the basement floor had started to crack
and they had to replace it.They found the bones when they tore up the
basement floor! I don't know how true that story was but , I know what
happened them 2 nights to my mom and I was very real .... thank you for
listening to this long story. and sorry it was so long!<br>

Having Experiences All my Life<br>
<br>
<br>
By: davidjmusic75@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I have been a fan of Shadowlands.net for a long time but I have never
written you about any of my experiences. First off I must tell you that
I have been having "experiences" pretty much all my life.<br>
Ever since I was little I could sense things that others could not sense.<br>
There is one story that I have been wanting to share with you that made a huge impact on me.<br>
So here is goes.....<br>
I was about 22 years old going to college for music education.<br>
Being a voice major I was involved in one of the top competing Barbershop Quartets at my school.<br>
So needless to say we had to practice a lot and travel a lot to compete.<br>
We were rehearsing one night at the bass's house.<br>
His father had passed away about a year prior do to a horrible battle
with cancer which took a big toll on Ken. Since his fathers death ,
every time I was in that house I got that "sense"....that feeling that
something was happening in that house. <br>
Any way the five of us Ken, Tony, T.J., myself and our professor
David&nbsp; were&nbsp; rehearsing in the finished basement. We were
facing the stairs that led up to the first floor. <br>
David(our professor) was facing us with his back towards the door way
that led upstairs conducting us through the rehearsal. I was standing
next to T.J. who was next to Tony and Ken was on the end.<br>
To the right of the stairs there is an office that Ken and his brother used a lot.<br>
While we were singing I started to get a chill and was scratching my neck.<br>
I glanced behind David and thought I saw something but it did not register at first.<br>
Then I froze.<br>
I couldn't breath and it felt like time had stopped.<br>
There sitting on the stairs with his arms resting on his legs was Ken's father.<br>
He was a translucent blue color mixed with white patches and it stirred like the ocean does on a calm day.<br>
Then in an instant he morphed and blew into the room next to the stairs.<br>
This all happened with in about a minute tops maybe less.<br>
At that moment I turned to my left as pale as the snow to see T.J. staring at the exact same spot.<br>
He then muttered shaking "Did you see that!?"<br>
I started to cough and couldn't catch my breath!<br>
I looked at T.J. and he says "I just saw something on the stairs!"<br>
Holy crap cakes it was real! He saw what I saw an described it in perfect detail!<br>
David decided we were crazy and packed up to go home.<br>
Ken started asking what we saw.<br>
I just wanted to get out of there ASAP.<br>
So we are walking to the car and Ken is insistent on coming out with the rest of us to get a drink.<br>
What do you do in this situation?<br>
"Hey man I just saw your dead father on the steps at your house do you want a beer?"<br>
So we get in the car and I am still freaking out a bit.<br>
Ken asks:"What's your problem dude? Why are you acting so weird?"<br>
So I just swallowed the lump in my throat and I tell him what I saw.<br>
He quickly told me to shut up very angrily. I fired back immediately.... <br>
"I would NEVER ever make up something like that Ken....why would I do that to you?"<br>
Ken was silent for a second with his head down then he looked at us and dropped the bomb.<br>
He went on to tell us that the house has been haunted for years. He
regularly talks to his father and sees him in the house all the
time.His father told him he was there protecting the family from the
other angry spirits.<br>
Then Ken goes on to talk about how he hears voices in his bathroom and
gets very negative angry feelings around the house. Screams and moaning
can be heard while he showers as well has was appears to be writing in
the steam on the shower door sometimes.<br>
Umm yeah that freaked me out even more!<br>
Well needless to say I NEVER&nbsp; stepped foot in that house again.<br>
We rehearsed at T.J.'s house from then on.<br>
After college I lost contact with Ken but I started to be more aware of things because of that night.<br>
Hope you enjoyed the story....I got goose bumps sharing it again :)<br>
Thanks for your awesome website and for having a place where we as believers can share our experiences!<br>
<br>

New Story of a Ghost<br>
<br>
By: Bradleyglov@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Just found your really nice web site.&nbsp; I am/was a&nbsp; member of
the NJ Ghost Hunters Society and see you want true stories so I'll tell
you of the first ghost I ever saw.&nbsp; I just moved to the foot hill
of the Adirondacks I'm 48 now but was when I was a child and living in
NJ.&nbsp; I was about 4 or 5 at the time I remember because I wasn't in
school yet but my older sister was.&nbsp; I was watching TV while my
mother was up stairs when I saw something move in the dining
room.&nbsp; I thought I might be my sister.&nbsp; I got up walked to
the dining room door and saw a woman all in black Victorian clothing. I
was less then eight feet away from her.&nbsp; She walked through the
dining room table and into the wall next to the china cabinet.&nbsp; I
can still see this as if it was happening right now before my
eyes.&nbsp; I ran to tell my mother who was also a believer of
ghost.&nbsp; We looked around, the side door was locked so no one got
into our house.&nbsp; And we even felt the wall where I saw the ghost
go through.&nbsp; I have had many sightings of ghost over the years.<br>

Santee, Ca<br>
<br>
By: ReggieandTere@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I'm not sure if the house is still there, but I was about 10 when this
happened. My brother and I shared a room, he slept on the top bunk. It
was about 2:30 am and I heard him laughing , the he starting screaming.
I looked towards the bedroom door and there was the dark figure of a
man. We started screaming and our dad came running into the bedroomMy
brother said at first the man was ticking him, then the man tried to
grab him. My brother was about 4 at the time. My parents used to use
the Oujia board alot. My parents grabbed the board and asked who was in
our room. The board spelled out that he was our grandfather and he was
just playing with Donny, he didn't mean to&nbsp; scare us.&nbsp; My
friend Cindy saw him watching us pick blackberries in our backyard and
said he chased her like they were playing a game. She didn't know he
was a ghost. I was never comfortable with him around because I thought
if he was on the board, he wasn't in heaven, and that wasn't a good
thing.<br>

Westchester, IL<br>
<br>
By: gymkels313@aim.com <br>
<br>
I have a few stories about the house where I used to live in
Westchester IL. I cannot give you the address because of privacy issues
but please put a warning about snooping people being arrested. Here are
my stories:<br>
There have been claims of spirit sightings. For example, my father woke
up in the middle of the night and looked at the end of his bed. He saw
a little boy and an old man sitting there. When my mother looked, she
saw nothing. On the stairs leading up to my parent's room, (which had
the attic included up about 4 stairs) my father saw a transparent
woman. In the middle of the night, my door would open and close with no
<br>
windows open or anything. In 1st grade, a long time ago, when we were
about to move, we had everything out of boxes, ready to be packed. I
heard something downstairs, once again, in the middle of the night. I
heard the front door open so I went out to the hallway. A black shape
moved across the downstairs and into the kitchen. I heard the back door
close and ran back to my room. There have been no reported deaths or
anything, so the reasons to the paranormal events are unknown currently.<br>

The District Lounge in Old Town Orange<br>
<br>
By: tgallows@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
<br>
i was at the district lounge in old town orange and i was standing
talking to a couple of my friends who were sitting at a table. i was in
mid sentence when i felt a hard tug on my keys. i keep my keys on one
of those clips that rock climbers use on my belt loop. i stopped to
look around to see if it was a friend who was walking by that grabbed
them but other than my two friends sitting at the table there was no
one close enough to grab my keys. my friends asked me what i was doing
cause i stopped mid sentence and started looking around and i said i
felt someone grab my keys and they said no one walked by. the district
lounge is a really old building and has been many businesses through
the years before it became the bar it is today. i decided to ask the
bartender if stuff happens there a lot and she told me about this one
time she was working and the only customers there happened to be in the
booth my friends were sitting in and she saw this bright flash as if
someone had taken a picture. she asked the customers if they had and
they said no. also after the bartender finished telling me this story,
the owner of the bar who was sitting there while we were telling these
stories, told us that there has been times when he was in the back when
it was closed and he could hear voices. he has the monitor for the
cameras right in front of him and he says he can see that no one is in
the building but he can hear voices.<br>

AST house Moravian College<br>
<br>
By: stkam09@moravian.edu <br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lived in the Alpha Sigma Tau house at Moravian
College and have had an experience with the ghost, Alicia.&nbsp; This
occured in October, 2007.&nbsp; It was my friends 21st birthday, and
she had some friends up from home to visit her.&nbsp; They were all
going out late that night to celebrate.&nbsp; I was not 21 at the time,
so was therefore not able to participate in the festivities.&nbsp;
Because my roommate was sleeping out, I told my friend that I would
keep my door unlocked if any of her friends wanted to sleep in my
roommates bed.&nbsp; Now, the only way you can lock the bedroom doors
in the house is from inside the room because they still use deadbolt
locks.&nbsp; there is no way that you can lock it from the outside
because the keys do not work.&nbsp; At 1 a.m I woke up randomly to find
that my door was deadbolted locked.&nbsp; I thought that was weird, but
didnt think to much of it.&nbsp; So, I got up and unlocked my door, and
then went back to sleep.&nbsp; The next morning, I woke&nbsp; up at
about 8:30 am to find that my door was deadbolted locked.&nbsp; This
was weird considering I was the only one in my room, and distinctly
remember unlocking it before.&nbsp; I told my friend whose birthday it
was about this, and she said it was weird considering she heard a
female voice speaking when she was trying to fall asleep.&nbsp; she
stayed up and watched her friends, thinking it was them speaking, but
it wasnt.&nbsp; this occured shortly after 2:30 a.m.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
only conclusion that we can come up to due to these events is that it
was Alicia.&nbsp; throughout the year, weird things would occur, such
as hearing footsteps in the attic, and the attic light randomly turning
on, but there was no way to turn it off.&nbsp; Once, we ran up in the
attic to try to turn it off, but, although we flipped every switch
available, it would not turn off.&nbsp; it wasnt until we were all back
downstairs that the night turned off.&nbsp; <br>
I hope you enjoyed reading about my haunting experience!<br>

Black Dog Story<br>
<br>

<br>
I have been an avid reader of the shadowlands since 2002 and i am madly
in love with the site! i sent you a story which you added back in 2005,
and i have something i would like to add to the black dog section, or
wherever you deem appropriate. <br>
The story is as follows:<br>
Back during WWII my grandfather and siblings were rudely awoken by
their mother (my great grammie) screaming in Italian and making a lot
of noise in their kitchen. What they could make out her saying was
things like "Get out of here! Shoo!" My grandfather and siblings ran
over to the kitchen and asked frantically what the problem was. She
answered back "there's a big black dog that got in the house! get him
out of here!" and she was using a broom to sweep him out from under
their stove (which was one on legs, so there was space underneath it.)
When they got the light on, they had to tell her there was nothing
there, and there was no way a large black dog could have run by all of
them to exit the house, as it was a small house with about 10 occupants
at the time. Also, it was the middle of the night so there were no
doors open. Right when she realized that there was no "real" black dog,
she started wailing in italian about the bad omen it was to bring. A
few days later they received a telegram that my Great Uncle Frank, her
son, was killed in the war.<br>
Strange, huh?<br>
thanks!<br>

Colbert County/Shady Grove Church<br>
<br>

My grandmother told stories of ghosts in the woods that once surrounded
this small church on River Road.&nbsp; She said that when she was young
(in the early 1920's) there was a huge old tree on the church property
that was used for hangings. The woods that were around the church were
said to be filled with strange crying and very odd apparitions.&nbsp;
Since these were the days of mule and wagon travel for many, mules and
horses would become spooked entering the hollow next to the church. My
great aunt claimed to have been attacked by a two-headed dog apparition
as they left church one evening,causing their horses to bolt. My mother
has told of when she was a child (1940's) the family was in their wagon
and entered the wooded hollow to go to church and a woman in white came
to the road from the woods and tried to get into the wagon with them.
Their mules bolted and by the time my grandpaw had settled them down,
the ghost was gone, but their was an awful wailing coming from behind
in the hollow. My grandmother said it was the ghost of a woman who was
hanged on the tree.<br>

Dachau Concentration Camp<br>
<br>

Dachau was a Nazi German concentration camp, and the first one opened
in Germany, located on the grounds of an abandoned munitions factory
near the medieval town of Dachau, about 16 km (10 miles) northwest of
Munich in the state of Bavaria which is located in southern Germany.<br>
I visited this concentration camp in 1960, long before the the display,
which was reworked in 2003, and now takes the visitor through the path
of new arrivals to the camp.. Then, the camp was more in it original
state and captured the horror that transpired inside.<br>
As the tour was being conducted, I could feel cold hands being placed
on my shoulder and the hair on my head, played with.&nbsp; <br>
While visiting the shower and barracks, visitors would often see dark
shadow moving about in the corners and the passing fragrances of dirty
smelly sweat, no doubt those of former prisoners.<br>
As soon as you walk through the gate you will be overwhelm with a feeling of fright, despair, fear, and misery.<br>
Well worth investigating......<br>

Hearing a Spirit<br>
<br>

I've never actually seen a ghost, but I have heard one. It was about
five years ago when we first moved into our new house in Old Fort,NC. I
was 15 years old at this time. My parents were gone to the grocery
store, and had been gone for around 20-30 minutes. My little step
brother and I were sitting in my room playing Monopoly. All of a sudden
I heard my mother's voice scream from the other side of the house: "
Spencer! Come here!" I sat there a minute and my brother looked up at
me and said: " Your moms calling you". I looked at him and said: " Yea
I know". I got up and went walking through the house only to remember
no one else was there other than my step brother and I. Feeling kind of
awkward at the situation I went back to my room continue the game of
Monopoly. Later on that night my older brother came home from work, and
I tolled him about. He said he wasn't shore what to make of it. Around
2:30am. that night we both went into the kitchen for a snack. Do you
know that feeling you get when someone is watching you? Well that's the
feeling that me and my brother both got when we entered the kitchen.
Looking over into the living room we could since there was something
there. But we couldn't' see anything! Just awkward! An hour later in my
room I got that same feeling of someone or something watching me. I got
up and grabbed my Bible lying on my dresser looking for a since of
security. The only thing I could think to do was to try and talk to
whatever; if anything was there, to it. I said: " I feel your presence
here." Nothing happened. " Please leave; I do not wish for you to be
here!" After I said this the feeling went away as quickly as it had
come. And to this day I have yet had anything "unnatural so to speak";
like this happen.<br>
