<P>
<P><B>I grew up in North Canton, Ohio, a fairly small town. I lived off Schneider
Road in a ranch style house with an underground garage and basement in which
my bedroom was located in a place in the old days called the Schneider valley,
which had been the site of a large farm.  I was in Junior high school , it
was around 1981.  I was in bed in my basement room reading a Hot Rod magazine,
with my dog Tara, a German Shepard-Collie mix lying at the foot of my bed.
 The door to the main basement was open, and the main lights to the basement
were off.There were three ways to access the basement, either from the stairs,
a door from the driveway, or a door aprox. 3 feet from that that led from
the double garage.  I heard the door from the garage open and close.  It
had a distinct swooshing then slamming noise when it opened and closed which
differentiated it from the other door.l  I heard heavy footsteps, like boots
in the basement.  I assumed it was my father coming in from either working
on his car or his motorcycle, but I couldn't figure out why he didn't ruturn
on the lights.  The dog leapt up and started growling and her hackles rose.
 I grabbed her by the collar and said "Tara, shut up.  It's just dad" and
attempted to drag her to my doorway.  She snapped at me.  This dog never
snapped at anyone, and that's when i realized she was terrified of something.
 The lights to the basemnent came on and my dad said"Goddamnit Dave, would
you quit clomping around.  People are trying to sleep".  I yelled back "Dad
it ain't me, I thought it was you walking around"  MY dad said "Oh shit,
stay where you are" and I heard him come down the stairs.  The dog had calmed
down by this time.  Dad checked out the whole basement and all was secure.
 The doors from the outside were both locked with the door lock and the chain
lock.  My dad said "Damn, I locked both of these doors earlier when I came
in.  Did you hear the door from the garage open?"  I replied that I had.
Dad said we both must have been dreaming and went back upstairs.  Later,
in July of this year, I took my family to visit my parents in their new home,
about 3 and a half miles from the old one, after being away in the Army since
1986.  I asked my mother about this experience, and she too remembered hearing
the door open.  Neighbors of ours had a downstairs sewing room where the
lights would go on and off and the doors and cabinets would open and close,
and our other neighbors on several occassions saw a floating, vaguely luminescent
hand</B>

<H3><A NAME=tippy>Tippy</A>
</H3><P><B>by cpeter@stlnet.com@stlnet.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was little, around five I think, one of our dogs had puppies.
 In the litter was </B>
<P><B>a pair of tricolor twins, one male and one female.  We kept the male
and named him Tippy </B>
<P><B>for the five white hairs at his tail-tip, you could only see them if
you really looked </B>
<P><B>for them.  Tippy and I were best friends for thirteen years, we did
dog obedience </B>
<P><B>together among other things.  I graduated from High School in June
'88 and was enjoying </B>
<P><B>my freedom, the following February Tippy came into my room and threw
up on the floor </B>
<P><B>just inside my doorway.  He gave me a really appoligetic look as if
to say I'm really </B>
<P><B>sorry I have to bother you but I'm sick.  I told my mother we had to
take him to the </B>
<P><B>vet, we didn't take him till he became really sick and couldn't do
his business anymore, </B>
<P><B>he had kidney failure and had to be put to sleep after a week or so.
 I cryed myself to </B>
<P><B>sleep that night, I woke up around 3:AM and I could feel Tippy in the
room with me, when </B>
<P><B>you have a dog that long you know when he's around, you can feel him.
 Since then I've </B>
<P><B>felt him in my room at night at least once or twice each year.  I also
felt him in </B>
<P><B>the house when I was by myself for a week, I think he knew that I felt
uneasy with </B>
<P><B>just the other two dogs with me.  I'm also marginally precognitive,
but I seem to have a </B>
<P><B>paper fetish, except once when I saw Tippy with my grandfather (whom
I never met, he </B>
<P><B>died long before I was born) playing in a field of yellow flowers.
 So I think that </B>
<P><B>Tippy is waiting for me with another of our dogs, Duke in the field
being looked after </B>
<P><B>by my grandfather till my mom and I can join them.</B>

<H3><A NAME=haunting>Guyanese Haunting</A>
</H3><P><B>by tubetech@classic.msn.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My name is Amanda, and the story I have to tell you </B>
<P><B>concerns myself as a newborn infant and my Parents when we were living
in </B>
<P><B>Guyana, South America in 1962.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My parents had been married for 2 years before I was conceived and
in late </B>
<P><B>pregnancy my Mother was approached in her shop by a woman who had heard
that </B>
<P><B>my parents were looking for an apartment (which would have been their
first </B>
<P><B>home together, as they were living with my Grandmother at the time).
 </B>
<P><B>Obviously, my parents were delighted, especially when they discovered
that it </B>
<P><B>was so near the shop and the rent was cheap.  The woman and her family
lived </B>
<P><B>on the ground floor and rented the top floor of the house to my parents.
  </B>
<P><B>Everything was fine until just after I was born.  It was then that
strange </B>
<P><B>things started to happen.  Slowly at first in a way that made my mother
think </B>
<P><B>she was overtired from having a newborn and that she must have imagined
</B>
<P><B>turning off the tap - only to find it still on, lights that she was
sure she </B>
<P><B>turned off mysteriously switched themselves on again.  Both my parents
were </B>
<P><B>very level headed and ignored these happenings until they reached a
point that </B>
<P><B>they could not ignore them anymore.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The first thing that really scared them was the lights going on in
their </B>
<P><B>bedroom in the middle of the night when they were in bed.   Then my
father </B>
<P><B>heard footsteps on the narrow staircase leading to the ground floor
outside </B>
<P><B>their room and waited for someone to knock or enter their room, but
no one </B>
<P><B>did.  When he went to look, there was no one there.  He tried to dismiss
this </B>
<P><B>by blaming it onto my mothers mischievous brother who always denied
playing </B>
<P><B>such a prank (and still does).  However, events took a sinister turn
which </B>
<P><B>made all the other incidents up to that point fall into place.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Things had reached an almost unbearable level of disturbance.  What
with the </B>
<P><B>lights and my incessant crying (I never seemed to settle in that house
</B>
<P><B>although when I was at my grandmothers I was calm so Im told), footsteps
etc, </B>
<P><B>when one night - which turned out to be the very last my parents would
stay in </B>
<P><B>the house something awful happened.  I woke at about midnight or
thereabouts </B>
<P><B>for a feed and both my parents were awake, my father watching my mother
</B>
<P><B>feeding me.  As my mother looked at me whilst feeding she screamed
in absolute </B>
<P><B>horror and then fell back on the bed in a faint, dropping me on the
bed.  My </B>
<P><B>father in shock picked me up but thought I was dead, he said I was
deathly </B>
<P><B>pale and my eyes had rolled right back into my head so he could only
see the </B>
<P><B>whites of my eyes and my head was bent back at such an angle he thought
</B>
<P><B>somehow my neck looked broken.  Not knowing what to do for his new
infant he </B>
<P><B>tried to revive my mother who quickly came round.  As he did so they
both </B>
<P><B>heard me gasp and scream.  The colour came back to my cheeks and I
appeared </B>
<P><B>unhurt but shocked and distressed.  My mother, sobbing incoherently
managed to </B>
<P><B>tell my father that she was not staying another night in the house
and they </B>
<P><B>both left immediately, leaving clothes and possessions to go to my
</B>
<P><B>Grandmothers house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>As if this was not bad enough it was some months later when talking
to someone </B>
<P><B>who knew the family who rented my parents the house, that they were
told that </B>
<P><B>the Indian family had a male relative who lived on the top floor of
the house </B>
<P><B>and who had committed suicide by hanging himself.  They had found it
difficult </B>
<P><B>to rent the top floor to anyone who knew them and so my parents think
that is </B>
<P><B>why the woman approached them.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Reading my own story, it sounds fantastic even to me.  However, for
anyone </B>
<P><B>reading this, I have related the details as I recall my mother, father
and </B>
<P><B>Grandmother reminiscing together while I listened unobserved by them,
for they </B>
<P><B>would never tell it to me directly as I think they did not want to
frighten me </B>
<P><B>because I was so directly involved.    </B>
<P>
<P><B>Thank you for listening.</B>

<H3><A NAME=first>My First Ghost</A>
</H3><P><B>by tomeleven@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>  This event started it all for me.  Ever since then I KNEW  what we
call "ghosts" are REAL.   About 1966 I discovered that there were BOOKS on
the subject and I have been studying "ghosts" and paranormal  phenomena ever
since.  I am ALSO a Scientist and inventor--So my approach to understanding
the phenomena is somewhat unique---  I beleive that "ghosts" are as of yet
"undiscovered" natural physical phenomena that can tell us much about how
the universe actually functions .  The study of them could lead to new
technoligies such as time travel and travel between parallel worlds.</B>
<P><B>     About 1954,  when I was about 6 years old, my family was stationed
in the</B>
<P><B>UK--(My father was in the Air Force.)  We were living in a rented house
on</B>
<P><B>the outskirts of Huntinton  (I think that's the way it is spelled)</B>
<P><B>   This house was a two storied thatched roof farm house, It was said</B>
<P><B>(then) to have been 360 years old.  One feature of this house was a
long,</B>
<P><B>low ceiling living room with a large beam down its center.  The
electric</B>
<P><B>light consted of a light bulb and lampshade that hung downwards from
the</B>
<P><B>beam from about 2 feet of wire.</B>
<P><B>     The dining room opened up into the living room and a "dimmer
switch"</B>
<P><B>near the door controled the light.</B>
<P><B>     As far as "ghosts" were concerned, I didn't really consider
them,</B>
<P><B>despite the envronment.  At my age, I was "frightened" of "monsters"--and
then only in my bedroom.</B>
<P><B>     One night our neighbor lady from across the street, Miss Mary,
came</B>
<P><B>over to help my mother cook dinner in the kitchen.  I was bored, so
I</B>
<P><B>began to play with the living room light switch.  I turned the light</B>
<P><B>rapidly on and off, on and off-----Suddenly a greyish form appeared
under</B>
<P><B>the lamp---Actually its HEAD was IN the lampshade!</B>
<P><B> (no kidding) </B>
<P><B>    What passed for arms and legs, "tubes" that seemed to terminate
in points, could be seen failing about with  rapid wave like motions.  The
lampshade was jumping up and down as the form thrashed about. </B>
<P><B>    Quickly I turned the light back ON and the "ghost" dissapeared.
 I</B>
<P><B>walked "rather rapidly" to the kitchen and stood behind a cabnet
against</B>
<P><B>the far wall.  My mother looked kind of angrily at me and asked "Whats
the</B>
<P><B>matter with YOU?"</B>
<P><B>    "I think I saw a ghost", I replied</B>
<P><B>Miss Mary threw up her hands and shouted  "Oh He DID!, He DID!"</B>
<P><B>    I led them both into the living room and told them how it
dissapeared</B>
<P><B>when I turned on the light.  When I described it, my mother put her
hand</B>
<P><B>up to her mouth and said, in a low voice, "God he saw the SAME thing
I</B>
<P><B>saw"</B>
<P><B>    Years later I learned that SHE had been playing with my little
sister</B>
<P><B>in the living room, when all of a sudden she saw the lamp shade on
the</B>
<P><B>light "flip up" "what in the world?" she thought.  The lampshade fliped
up</B>
<P><B>once more and she then saw the grey thrashing form beneath it.  She
pickrd</B>
<P><B>up my baby sister and left the room.  She did not tell ANYONE about
seeing</B>
<P><B>it--Untill MY experience.  She said that she was afraid to tell my
father,</B>
<P><B>because , before SHE had been TEASING HIM about his "feelings" that
there</B>
<P><B>were "ghosts" in the house.--(-My father had been a beleiver, but he
did</B>
<P><B>not see THIS ghost)</B>
<P><B>    This event ALSO was the explaination for an odd question  a
former</B>
<P><B>tennant asked my parents a few months before---"Have you noticed
anyyhing</B>
<P><B>'funny' in the livingroom?"   When my parents said that they did not</B>
<P><B>understand, She sort of "droped" the question and said "Oh ,
Nevermind"</B>
<P><B>    </B>
<P><B>    It is from THIS event that I KNOW that ghosts exist---At least
3</B>
<P><B>people saw the same thing. I also know that Ghosts are an "ExternaL"</B>
<P><B>rather than "mental" or "telepathic" phenominom as it MOVED the
physical</B>
<P><B>lampshide.-</B>
<P><B>--There was NO chance of trickery or illusion--It was in MY home. 
It was</B>
<P><B>perfectly obvious what it was!--A Ghost!-- The real thing.   </B>
<P><B>    This event prompted me to begin studying ghosts about 1966, when
I</B>
<P><B>began finding books on the subject.  As I have a scientific mind--and
am</B>
<P><B>NOW a Scientist,  It has become importaint to me to "figgure out"
just</B>
<P><B>what ghosts are. </B>
<P><B>    Sure, I know what I saw was NOT TYPICAL of ghost reports, but I
saw</B>
<P><B>what I saw as did OTHER people.  I beleive that it was the BEST
sighting</B>
<P><B>that anyone could have as It could not have been a hoax and it
affected</B>
<P><B>physical matter (good clue to its substance nature)</B>
<P><B>  Other notes---  I have often wondered why the ghost was there--with
its head in the lampshade--One clue was that there was an old large iron
hook driven into the beam just above the light--"my mother always jokingly
refered to it as "the meat hook".  I think someone might have been hung (or
hung themself) there many years ago.--That would explain the failing about
and its proximity to the light which was a more recent addition to the house.
 I have also (finally) found a picture of a ghost that closely resembles
what I saw.  It is the "Anderson Cemetery Ectoplasims" in the Ghost web
(http//:ghostweb.com) Gallery--The image on the left.  It appears to be made
up of 2 or 3 vortexes--giving the impression of "arms and legs"  Being that
the ghost I saw might have been several vortexes, it would explain why the
arms and legs terminated in "Points" any why they seemed to "whip about"
in a kind of "flopy" motion.         </B>

<H3><A NAME=grim>Grim Reaper </A>
</H3><P><B>by DGallo1398@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have been reading several stories on this page and I'm
thinking.....Finally, I have met other people with similar experiences that
some of my family members and I have had through out the years. I would like
to share one story in particular that happened twenty years ago, in August
and September of 1977.</B>
<P><B>     My husband and I were married in June of 1977. He was in the military
and stationed in Rome, N.Y. We found a small trailer in the village of Blossvale
to live in. </B>
<P><B>This trailer was the size of a large Winnebago. We were so happy and
cozy! Any way, it was my habit to get up in the mornings to fix a large breakfast
for my husband and then go back to bed when he left for work and sleep until
about 9:00 a.m.. </B>
<P><B>     One morning in August, I awoke with a start and knew that someone
was staring at me. (I was laying in the bed with my feet facing the back
door and my back to the living room and front door.) I rolled over and almost
"bumped into" this dark figure leaning over me. It looked like the Grim Reaper!
Full Size and Terrifying! (Now up until this moment, I always thought that
the Grim Reaper was a fictitious character made up some long ago
Halloween.....but right this instant he was standing over me.) I was terrified!
 Being young, terrified and trapped in my bed I did the only thing I could
do..........covered my head with my blanket!  I was in a panic. (My keyboard
keys are chattering!  No seriously, I always start shaking when I relay this
story to anyone.) </B>
<P><B>     Well, I started praying like I never prayed before and finally
got up the nerve to look out from beneath my blanket.  IT was gone. </B>
<P><B>     About a week later the same thing happened. My mind is reeling!
What is happening, what does IT want???? Is it coming after me????  What
can I do to protect myself????  I finally told my husband what had happened.
He got this strange look on his face and I took it that he thought I was
crazy so I dropped the subject and tried not to think of it. I kept telling
myself that I was crazy and imagining things simply because I didn't like
the alternative. The thought of it left me trembling. I was all alone everyday,
twenty miles from the city and hundreds of miles from my "Mommy"!</B>
<P><B>     About two weeks after the second appearance, IT came back. This
time, as I awoke with the now familiar feeling of someone staring, I lay
there considering my possibilities. I could continue to hide under my covers
and eventually let IT "get me" or face it. I figured I'd rather die facing
the situation. Now I don't know that I would call it courage, but something
made me able to roll over and fling back the covers to confront this thing!
(I had never seen its face before as its hood was in the way.)</B>
<P><B>     Well, to my surprise, as I flung the covers off me and sat up
on the side of the  bed, it recoiled from me. IT brought its arms up and
crossed them over what would be its face.....But it had no face. Just empty
darkness within the hood opening. As I come up off the bed it turned and
took off in one fluid motion toward my kitchen. I looked down at its feet
and it had no feet and was about 4 to 5 inches off the floor. Well, seeing
as how this thing was fleeing from me, I worked up the nerve to yell at it
to leave me alone and never come back! </B>
<P><B>     I peered around the wall to look into my kitchen and it was not
there. Now if it had left through one of the two doors I would have seen
it from where I was standing beside my bed. Believe me I was waiting for
something to exit via one of the doors but it didn't. It just disappeared.
</B>
<P><B>     Twenty years later, I still wonder what the heck it was after
and what the visits meant if they meant anything at all.</B>
<P><B>I do have an interesting post script to this story.</B>
<P><B>      In 1995, eighteen years after this happened to me, I brought
the subject up once more to my husband. I wanted to know if he thought I
was crazy or just what did he think about it?  He ruefully told me that he
got that funny look on his face when I told him about it because the Reaper
had visited him also and in this same time frame that it visited me. He told
me that IT had grabbed him by the ankle on two seperate occasions and shook
it until he was awake. He said that when he would wake up and look at it,
it would disappear. I was shocked!  At least the thing never touched me!</B>
<P><B>     My husband said he was terrified also but did not tell me about
his events because he knew how frightened I was and he didn't know what to
do about it. How do you fight something that is not even supposed to be
real?</B>
<P><B>     What do you think? Has anyone else seen the Reaper? What does
he want? I have my ideas and some things happened to us around that time
that I felt could be associated with IT, but I guess I will never
know........................</B>

<H3><A NAME=pumpkin>Pumpkin's Farewell</A>
</H3><P><B>by Mama2Dogs@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>An animal lover all my life, I adopted a lost cat found in the parking
lot at work. Suzy lost her eyesight when I had had her about three years
most likely because of malnutrition as a kitten. She loved other animals
and a couple of stray cats I fed would visit her. She seemed to stay attuned
to her surroundings with another cat around. After the disappearance of the
last stray, I brought home a little orange-striped bob tailed kitten to be
her companion -- this was Pumpkin.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Pumpkin was a charmer! His first task was to de-leaf every house plant
I had. Suzy gradually accepted him -- she was accustomed to more sedate
buddies.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When he was about six months old I became aware that he was having
bladder spasms. After weeks of observation the vet suggested I make him a
full-time outdoor cat which I tried, but he still came in and slept at night
with Suzy and me, curling up on his towel at the foot of the bed.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Pumpkin could jump straight up about three feet, and did often when
trying to catch a butterfly or some other critter. He frequently caught lizards
and even brought a garter snake inside once. One day I found him sitting
on the edge of my neighbors' fish pool, his fur glistening in the sun, not
trying to snag a goldfish as accused, but admiring himself. Pumpkin enjoyed
being alive.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When he was three years old he developed bowel problems and would become
blocked. Along with the vet's help and instructions from a friend whose cat
had similar problems, I learned how to give him enemas. He would purr and
purr, knowing I was giving him the relief he needed. In the next year his
blockages became more and more frequent. The vet suggested I put him down.
I could not do it. When he was well he was so Fine! He had such a beautiful
little soul. And he was young; I just could not bring myself to give him
up.</B>
<P>
<P><B>At Christmastime three years ago my extended family and I went on a
ski trip. I had made arrangements for a friend to look in on the cats each
day, but the day before we left, Pumpkin experienced another blockage. I
left him with the vet.</B>
<P>
<P><B>On the third night we were in Utah, I woke up to find Pumpkin sitting
on my chest like he did when he wanted out. The little cat stared directly
into my eyes with his beautiful round ones and then he was gone. </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I returned home, I did not call to pick up my cat until the afternoon
of the first day home. I knew Pumpkin had died because he came to me to say
good-bye.</B>

<P>
<P><B>I Will try to be as specific as i can.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was thirteen years old, a friend had gotten me intrested in the</B>
<P><B>occult, i was reading about astrology at the time and had just talked
to</B>
<P><B>a psyich about what she did and how she became involved with her</B>
<P><B>profession. She had grabbed my hand rather suddenly and said "You
have</B>
<P><B>been marked, be carefull about what you wish for. Don't forget to
pray</B>
<P><B>tonight." I remember her words because I wrote it down in my diary,;</B>
<P><B>plus it scared the hell out of me.  </B>
<P><B>	That evening I went to bed feeling pritty good about things having</B>
<P><B>pushed the incident into the back of my mind, thinking that it had
just</B>
<P><B>been a joke. But I couldn't get the feeling that she had been just
a</B>
<P><B>little to earnist about it to be a joke. I said my prayers and went
to</B>
<P><B>bed. (Just a little note here, I had a bed in my mothers room since
this</B>
<P><B>was a brand new house with only two bedrooms and my brother had the</B>
<P><B>other one.) I awoke from a deep sleep, I couldn't seem to move
anything</B>
<P><B>but my eyes. Beside me was a hazy silver man, well part of a man for
i</B>
<P><B>could only see the top half of his body, he reached out his hand to
me,</B>
<P><B>gesturing for me to follow him. Something inside me rebelled at the</B>
<P><B>thought of following that figure, but against my will I felt myself</B>
<P><B>lifting from my body. I tryed to scream, but couldn't move my mouth,
I</B>
<P><B>silently shouted NO I'M NOT GOING! to the man, he mearly grinned and
the</B>
<P><B>grin transformed his face into a face that reminded me of a monky's</B>
<P><B>face. I drew back slightly I was amazed that I could control myself
that</B>
<P><B>much and tryed even harder to draw away, with what I considered</B>
<P><B>considerable effort. I tryed again to scream, and I actually did. 
My</B>
<P><B>mother sat straight up, and rushed to my side. The man shivered as
I</B>
<P><B>said a quick prayer and dissapeared.</B>

<P>
<P><B>To give you a little more information, I arived on Okinawa in January
of</B>
<P><B>1991,as the new guy I had to my time with the worst job and posts.</B>
<P><B>I had worked the Flightline post many times, and the fist time I had
seen</B>
<P><B>any thing was about September, if I remember right.</B>
<P><B>I was walking down the North end of the flight line when I heard two
voices</B>
<P><B>arguing, I was too far away to tell about what but beeing the Marine
stereo</B>
<P><B>type, I ran around the courner of the last hanger to stop the problem,
as</B>
<P><B>soon as I turned the courner, the yelling stopped and there wasn't
anyone</B>
<P><B>there.</B>
<P><B>The next time I had any incedents, was several months later, once again
as</B>
<P><B>a flight line sentry, I observed what I believe to be a pilot run from
one</B>
<P><B>of the hangers, and into the rear of a C-130 airplane. when my partner
and</B>
<P><B>myself arived at the aircraft the rear door was down, but no one was</B>
<P><B>inside.</B>
<P><B>at first we thought it was our imagination, being about two, or three
in</B>
<P><B>the morning and just ignored it.</B>
<P><B>other Marines who had been asighned to work on the flightline have
told me</B>
<P><B>the they have heard people talknig, moving things around and
different</B>
<P><B>things inside the hanger.</B>
<P><B>after a while (3 years) of working there i began to tell my Marines
not to</B>
<P><B>worry about, they wont bother you.</B>

<H3><A NAME=theater>The Ghost in the Community Theater</A>
</H3><P><B>by nantz@rocketmail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I think I was possessed by a ghost.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had volunteered my time to help out with a production for a</B>
<P><B>community playhouse as artistic director.  We had to work late at</B>
<P><B>night on the stage set and backdrops because the director of the play</B>
<P><B>insisted on using the stage for practice during the day.  There were</B>
<P><B>only three of us working on the set, my ex-husband Bob, the friend
who</B>
<P><B>got us involved in the project &endash; Chris, and myself.  They were
working</B>
<P><B>on the construction and I took care of all the painting.  We would</B>
<P><B>bring a bottle of wine each night and about half way through would</B>
<P><B>take a break.  The night of the incident we were the only ones there,</B>
<P><B>since it was a Sunday night most people had other commitments, but
we</B>
<P><B>were so far behind on production we had to come in and get some work</B>
<P><B>done.  To be able to get the work done we had to turn the stage
lights</B>
<P><B>on from the control room.  There was only one problem, you had to go</B>
<P><B>up the back stage stairs across a large platform that served as the</B>
<P><B>woodshop for the theater and through a prop room, on either side of</B>
<P><B>which were locked doors and we did not have the keys.  After locating</B>
<P><B>a ladder backstage our friend Chris was able to get close enough to</B>
<P><B>the catwalk in front of the control room, pull himself up and turn
the</B>
<P><B>lights on for the stage, but still we  could not get access to the</B>
<P><B>control room via the prop room because of the locked doors.</B>
<P><B>During our break that night, around 11:00 pm, Chris began telling us</B>
<P><B>about the ghosts that people had seen in the theater.  While I always</B>
<P><B>felt that ghosts were a probability, I thought he was just trying to</B>
<P><B>scare us.  So I jokingly said,  "If there are any ghosts in this</B>
<P><B>theater I want to see you."  My friend freaked out pointing out that</B>
<P><B>you should never invite a ghost unless you add that they come in the</B>
<P><B>name of God.   So again jokingly I said, "If there are any ghost in</B>
<P><B>this theater, and they come in the name of God,  I want to see you."
</B>
<P><B>My friend was pretty freaked out and kept telling me that I
shouldn't</B>
<P><B>mess around with things that I don't know about.   We took a longer</B>
<P><B>than usual break this night and a hour later were still sitting
around</B>
<P><B>talking.  Chris and Bob were really into a discussion about something</B>
<P><B>and totally forgot I was there.  So I got up and just casually walked</B>
<P><B>backstage and up to the top of the stairs where I sat at the top of</B>
<P><B>the landing expecting them to call after me at any minute.  I sat</B>
<P><B>there for 10-15 minutes getting very perturbed that they hadn't
missed</B>
<P><B>me yet, when I heard one of them say, "Hey, were did she go?".  It
was</B>
<P><B>almost pitch black backstage yet I got this overwhelming desire to</B>
<P><B>hide.  As soon as I had that thought a man appeared before me.  He
had</B>
<P><B>light almost glowing skin, clear blue eyes, red hair, and a full</B>
<P><B>beard.  He told me to follow him and he would should me were to hide</B>
<P><B>so that they could not find me.  When asked later why I was not
scared</B>
<P><B>and why I went with someone I didn't know, all I can say is that it</B>
<P><B>never occurred to me.  Anyway, I tried to stand up to follow him but</B>
<P><B>he insisted that I crawl saying that if I stood up they might see us</B>
<P><B>and kill us.  Why this did not send up an alarm I'm not sure either.
</B>
<P><B>I began crawling and crawling after him, but at some point he</B>
<P><B>disappeared, yet I could still hear him and feel his presence. </B>
<P><B>Flashes of an old house with old flower wallpaper and wood slatted</B>
<P><B>walls kept coming into my head, then it changed and I was in a field</B>
<P><B>and I heard men yelling at one another in the background.  I could</B>
<P><B>hear the bearded man and he told me to stop that we would be safe</B>
<P><B>where we were for now.  He started repeating to me to be quite and
not</B>
<P><B>to move or they would find us and kill us.  I continued to hear the</B>
<P><B>men's voices but then I began to hear other voices mixed in with
them.</B>
<P><B> It was Bob and Chris calling for me.  I remember telling the man
that</B>
<P><B>I was going to call for them, but he insisted that I not say anything</B>
<P><B>or THEY would find us and kill us.  He kept frantically repeating
this</B>
<P><B>over and over, and I kept asking who, who, who?  He was hysterical
by</B>
<P><B>this point and I was really beginning to get scared.  All I could</B>
<P><B>think was, "I don't know who is going to get you but they are not</B>
<P><B>going to get me!"  I began to scream for Bob and Chris to find me,
and</B>
<P><B>to hurry because I didn't know where I was. When I began to scream
the</B>
<P><B>man just disappeared.</B>
<P><B>The next part had to be told to me because I don't remember it</B>
<P><B>happening at all.  Bob and Chris followed my screaming and found me
in</B>
<P><B>the locked prop room (the door now wide open) under a table with my</B>
<P><B>legs crossed, hands on my knees, skin white, lips blue, and my eyes</B>
<P><B>rolled back in my head.  Bob began to shake me and scream at me to</B>
<P><B>wake up.  They said that I stood and started saying that he's
trapped,</B>
<P><B>he can't get out, we have to help him.  Bob grabbed me by the
shoulder</B>
<P><B>and spun me around asking me what the hell I was talking about.  That</B>
<P><B>is when they say I came too.  I remember seeing them standing there</B>
<P><B>and then looking around.  I asked them where we were, how we got</B>
<P><B>there.  Chris was really spooked by it all.   It all began coming
back</B>
<P><B>to me and I told them the story.  Chris was so scared he had us out</B>
<P><B>the door and in our cars so fast I barely remember leaving. Now you</B>
<P><B>might try to discount this incident by saying I had too much to
drink,</B>
<P><B>but I only had 2 glasses of wine in 1 &#189; hours time,  that I had
a</B>
<P><B>seizure and dreamed it all up, but explain this if you can.  I
managed</B>
<P><B>to end up in a locked room, that was pitch dark.  When looking at the</B>
<P><B>only path I could have taken through the prop room we realized that</B>
<P><B>there was no way anyone could have navigated that space in the pitch</B>
<P><B>dark unless someone was guiding them (it was filled with pointed</B>
<P><B>objects that stuck out from all directions and the path made several</B>
<P><B>curves and turns before stopping at the nook where I ended up).  I</B>
<P><B>know this must seem pretty unreal because it does to me, and I often</B>
<P><B>wonder if I didn't just dream it all.  But all the details are just
as</B>
<P><B>fresh in my memory today as they were 6 years ago.  That was only the</B>
<P><B>beginning of supernatural occurrences for me, although none have even</B>
<P><B>come close to my experience in the theater. </B>

<H3><A NAME=tower>The Water Tower</A>
</H3><P><B>by jgwilliam@shoal.net.au</B>
<P>
<P><B>This occurence happened to my friend Collin P. and</B>
<P><B>myself John G. in about 1959. At the time we were</B>
<P><B>about 13 and still attending Hagley RC High School.</B>
<P><B>The time was about 8.00 - 8.30 PM, the month I no</B>
<P><B>longer remember but it was in the Northern Hemisphere</B>
<P><B>Autumn - Winter because it was dark quite early.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The local town was Kidderminster in the County of</B>
<P><B>Worcestershire, roughly in the middle of England.</B>
<P><B>The area was Birchen Coppice, a housing estate owned</B>
<P><B>by the local council, it was then, a respectable area</B>
<P><B>as it was only probably 8 years old, I believe the </B>
<P><B>area is now more of a slum but I haven't been there</B>
<P><B>in 33 years as we moved in the middle '60's and then</B>
<P><B>I re-located to Australia in '67.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A bit of geography is needed here so;</B>
<P>
<P><B>The street we lived in was Kinver Ave, the rear of our</B>
<P><B>houses backed onto undeveloped bushland which went on</B>
<P><B>into some pretty, unspoiled countryside in most directions.</B>
<P><B>However the area just to the rear and to the south was</B>
<P><B>called "The Burlish Camp". This Camp was built in WW2 as</B>
<P><B>a repatriation hospital for US servicemen. After WW2 it</B>
<P><B>was used to house Polish war refugees. As children we</B>
<P><B>played, mixed and schooled with their children. In the</B>
<P><B>middle '50s the people were re located and the whole area</B>
<P><B>was knocked flat, except for one lonley structure called</B>
<P><B>the "Water Tower".</B>
<P><B>As the name suggests it was exactly</B>
<P><B>that, a very large brick tower, from childhood memory</B>
<P><B>about 50ft by 50ft by 80 - 100ft high with a giant water</B>
<P><B>tank in the top. It was used to supply the Burlish Camp</B>
<P><B>with water.There were 8 windows, 4 at the rear and 4 at</B>
<P><B>the front. The first pair about 30ft from the ground, the</B>
<P><B>next pair another 30ft up. There was a steel door on the</B>
<P><B>southern side but it was bricked up in the middle '50s.</B>
<P><B>There was never any electricity to it and it was now</B>
<P><B>inaccessible.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Back to the story;</B>
<P><B>Colin and I were just hanging out, at the end of our</B>
<P><B>street under a street light.This street light was at</B>
<P><B>the junction where our tarred street met with a wide</B>
<P><B>dirt track that lead over to the Burlish Camp, straight</B>
<P><B>passed the Water Tower and onto a small town called </B>
<P><B>Stourport-on-Severn about 4 miles further on.</B>
<P><B>During our conversation Colin said " hey look at those</B>
<P><B>lights in the Water Tower", (the tower was probably 1/4</B>
<P><B>mile away but could be made out in the moonlight).</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was quite supprised, because we could see some form of</B>
<P><B>moving or blinking light in the window area of the Tower.</B>
<P><B>The light colour did not appear as normal to what we call</B>
<P><B>light ie, candles and incandescent light seems to have a</B>
<P><B>warm and yellow content, this light light was very sallow</B>
<P><B>white to opaque. A short time later, about 20 yds from us</B>
<P><B>on the dirt track at angle of about 45 degrees we could</B>
<P><B>see a light, the same colour light that was in the Tower.</B>
<P>
<P><B>From this point on, in the following events, I have no</B>
<P><B>recollection of time; I remember we  thought it was someone</B>
<P><B>on a bicycle because the light seemed to fall to the ground,</B>
<P><B>we started giggling saying it must be someone drunk and fell</B>
<P><B>off their bike. </B>
<P><B>In the next instance, I remember myself drawn and staring</B>
<P><B>wide eyed at the figure of a man particularly at the face,</B>
<P><B>it was side on, very distinguinshable features; vertical</B>
<P><B>flat forehead, long pointed nose, sunken very staring eyes,</B>
<P><B>because my concentration was so intense and to the head,</B>
<P><B>I did not seem to observe any body detail, except the lack</B>
<P><B>of normal motion movements, he appeared to float along.</B>
<P><B>Opaque, we could see right through him.</B>
<P><B>Also the ground all around  seemed to crackle, as if</B>
<P><B>Rice Chrispies were being trodden on. Next, I picked up</B>
<P><B>a stone and threw it in his direction, Colin was pulling</B>
<P><B>at my left arm screaming at me not to throw it. The stone,</B>
<P><B>I estimate, fell short but in line, as it hit the soft</B>
<P><B>grass with a "thud" the man brought up his arm as if to</B>
<P><B>protect his face, my legs went to jelly, I fell to the ground</B>
<P><B>and the vision disappeared, Colin ran off holding his ears</B>
<P><B>and screaming as he stumbled off running through peoples</B>
<P><B>front gardens. </B>
<P><B>BUT..... I vividly recall floating above the street light,</B>
<P><B>I can remember detail such as the bird droppings on top of</B>
<P><B>the post. I watched Colin pulling my left arm, me throwing</B>
<P><B>the stone, collapsing on the ground and Colin running away</B>
<P><B>screaming. I recall a lady from a nearby house coming out</B>
<P><B>and bending over me. </B>
<P><B>The next thing I remember was lying on the ground and a</B>
<P><B>lady, Mrs Sayers, bending over me asking if I was ok, and</B>
<P><B>"what was all that shouting"?</B>
<P><B>I ran home very scared. Collin lost his hearing for 2 days.</B>
<P><B>We made a pact not to tell for fear of ridicule, anyhow</B>
<P><B>as time went by we told, and we got laughed at. But I could</B>
<P><B>never see anything funny about it, this occurrence left an</B>
<P><B>indelible mark on me.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Some years later at age, maybe, 16, I had been out fox</B>
<P><B>hunting with a companion Peter G. Peter wasn't a local and</B>
<P><B>was unfamilliar with our area, we were heading back to</B>
<P><B>my home, on a "Dirt" motorcycle at about 2.30-3.00 am,</B>
<P><B>Peter was pillion, I was riding. When we were directly</B>
<P><B>in front of the Tower, a few hundred yards away, Peter</B>
<P><B>shouted to me "who lives over there", I said,"overwhere"?</B>
<P><B>as I concentrated on riding with no lights; "over there",</B>
<P><B>to your left, as I looked to my left I was looking at</B>
<P><B>the Tower. My eyes nearly popped, my jaw dropped, I was agast. </B>
<P><B>Each of the windows in the tower had those same lights as</B>
<P><B>years before, but even more startling, we could distinctly</B>
<P><B>see  people like figures, lined up as if waiting to go in</B>
<P><B>where the door used to be, the figures were not</B>
<P><B>distinguishable seperatley but were the same opaque colour</B>
<P><B>as the "little white man". That motorbike became the fastest</B>
<P><B>bike in the land.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Many years later, talking to my late dad, we were passing</B>
<P><B>the time talking about our familly,being kids, where we lived,</B>
<P><B>neighbours and the like,dad was telling me how in the  post war</B>
<P><B>years 1956 - 1960 times were hard and 5 or 6 of the local</B>
<P><B>ladies would work continuous night shifts in an electrical</B>
<P><B>insulator manufacturing plant, in the above mentioned town</B>
<P><B>called Stourport-on-Severn. He said they would cycle 8 - 10</B>
<P><B>miles to work each way instead of 3 miles short cut through</B>
<P><B>the Burlish Camp. I said "how come dad", oh he replied,</B>
<P><B>"Mrs Hawker next door says that none of the woemen </B>
<P><B>feel good going that way, it always seems very still and</B>
<P><B>eerie when they goe past the Tower, and when they come home</B>
<P><B>in the morning, the birds are singing but, not up there by</B>
<P><B>the Tower, its always still and quiet". Dad chuckled.</B>
<P><B>I didn't, I knew just what they meant.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, in the mid to late 60's the tower was to be removed</B>
<P><B>to make way for a communications repeater station, the local</B>
<P><B>news was there to cover the big Bang, it took 3 days of</B>
<P><B>drilling and explosives to finally fell the Tower, the</B>
<P><B>experts were scratching their heads, they couldn't</B>
<P><B>understand how it stayed up through so many explosive attempts.</B>

<H3><A NAME=dreams>The Thing in My Dreams</A>
</H3><P><B>by ptp@primenet.com</B>
<P>
<P>  <B>For about a year or so as a child of about 9-10 years old, I had
a</B>
<P><B>: series of dreams with a recurring person in them. This was no
ordinary</B>
<P><B>: person, however. In each dream he would chase me, catch me, and do
things</B>
<P><B>: to me. It got so bad I had trouble sleeping, until I hit upon a novel
way</B>
<P><B>: to stop the dreams. At any point, in the dream, when things got too
hairy</B>
<P><B>: I would will myself to repeat, "No, no, no!" over and over until
I awoke.</B>
<P><B>: My first tentative steps with lucid dreaming, I suppose. Anyway,
the last</B>
<P><B>: dream in the series went like this.....</B>
<P><B>:      "Once again, I found myself walking down a broken and cracked</B>
<P><B>: sidewalk. Large, dark brick buildings rose up on either side of me.
As I</B>
<P><B>: rounded a corner, I bumped into him. He was dressed in a black,</B>
<P><B>: three-piece suit. Black hat. His featureless face was ghost white,
except</B>
<P><B>: for where the lips should have been. Drawn on, with lipstick, was
an</B>
<P><B>: overly exaggerated pair of lips. He tipped his head down towards
me, and</B>
<P><B>: lifted his arms up to shoulder height. It was then I noticed he was</B>
<P><B>: holding an oversized black burlap bag. "I've got something for you!"
he</B>
<P><B>: said, opening the empty bag and lunging towards me. I started to
run back</B>
<P><B>: the way I came. The more I ran, however, the slower I went. I kept
looking</B>
<P><B>: over my shoulder, seeing him walk at a fast clip ever closer.  </B>
<P><B>:      The last time I looked back, it was just in time to see him
right</B>
<P><B>: behind me. He pulled the bag over my head, straight down, and covered
me</B>
<P><B>: completely. Yanking it over and up, I was in the bag and the
pull-stringed</B>
<P><B>: opening was closed and above me.  He then proceeded to start dragging
me</B>
<P><B>: back the way he had come from.</B>
<P><B>:     It was at this point I knew my goose was cooked. I had no way
out,</B>
<P><B>: except to start chanting "No no no" until I awoke. Fighting back
tears, I</B>
<P><B>: began yelling, "No , no, no, no, no..." He stopped dragging the bag.
It</B>
<P><B>: must be working, I thought. I continued chanting. Then, he opened
the top</B>
<P><B>: of the bag just slightly. His head, its evil lipsticked grin almost</B>
<P><B>: mocking me, tilted downward. Holding the bag with one hand, he
reached</B>
<P><B>: behind his head with the other. He began pulling at his neck. I
kept</B>
<P><B>: chanting. In one fell swoop, he pulled his ghostly white head off
like</B>
<P><B>: a mask as the hat flew off and out of view. A bulbous, hairless,
thickly</B>
<P><B>: wrinkled dark grey head with big, round all black eyes was now
looking</B>
<P><B>: down at me. "NO, NO, NO!" I screamed. The creature's thin lipless</B>
<P><B>: grey mouth cracked open slightly, as I heard its words reverberate
in my</B>
<P><B>: head.... "Oh, YES, YES, YES!" </B>
<P><B>:     I awoke, screaming."</B>
<P><B>:  </B>
<P><B>:      While this was the last in a series of DREAMS I post it here
because</B>
<P><B>: both the masked and real look of the creature uncannily resembles</B>

<H3><A NAME=late>Late Night Visitor</A>
</H3><P><B>by 4fc2@qlink.queensu.ca</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is an account from my tutor who just retired from her teaching</B>
<P><B>career.  She is a very well respected person, which makes her story
very</B>
<P><B>believeable.  The story occurred nearly 50-60 years ago, when she was
a</B>
<P><B>college student in England.  She was living in the dorm with a girl
from</B>
<P><B>the local community.  Her roommate is a very social person, and loves
to</B>
<P><B>invite friends over to chat; my tutor is a very easy going person and</B>
<P><B>doesn't really care if the room gets overly crowded occasionally.
 Both</B>
<P><B>of them weren't in the habit of closing the door when either of them</B>
<P><B>were in the room.  One night during exams period, my tutor was up
late</B>
<P><B>studying while her roommate was studying in a friend's room.  It was</B>
<P><B>past midnight when a pale looking girl walked into their room and sat
on</B>
<P><B>her roommate's bed.  My tutor assumed that she's one of her
roommate's</B>
<P><B>friends, waiting for her roommate to return, so she gave her a
welcoming</B>
<P><B>smile, and continued to study.  After a while (30 min I suppose), the</B>
<P><B>roommate wasn't back, and the girl walked out of the room again. 
They</B>
<P><B>didn't have any conversation of any sort.  The shock came the next
day</B>
<P><B>when my tutor and her roommate were walking down the corridor of
their</B>
<P><B>department building.  A graduation photo caught my tutor's attention.
</B>
<P><B>She recognize one of the girls in the photo as the late visitor from</B>
<P><B>last nite.  She remembered that she hadn't mentioned the visitor to
her</B>
<P><B>roommate, so she told her of last night's incident and pointed out
the</B>
<P><B>girl from the photo.  Her roommate went totally pale when she heard
the</B>
<P><B>story, and told her that the girl was brutally raped and murdered a
year</B>
<P><B>ago, before my tutor even came to the college.  She told her that it
was</B>
<P><B>a really shocking news around the campus, considering the peaceful</B>
<P><B>neighbourhood they had...</B>

<H3><A NAME=black>The Black Ghost</A>
</H3><P><B>by guenther@mnsinc.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>My sister also had an experience with ghosts.  One day, she was coming
up</B>
<P><B>the stairs to get her water baby.  When she looked up, she saw a
black</B>
<P><B>shadow hovering over top the bathroom door.  She thought that she was</B>
<P><B>seeing things, so she continued her climb.  When she entered the toy
room,</B>
<P><B>the "shadow" moved along the wall towards a pile of magazines on top
of a</B>
<P><B>filing cabinet.  When she reached her baby doll, the black ghost
knocked</B>
<P><B>over the pile of magazines on top of her.  She shrieked and ran out
of the</B>
<P><B>room.</B>

<H3><A NAME=mom>Mom and Aunt Jean</A>
</H3><P><B>by Haven@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I want to share my story of what occurred on September 17th of 1967.
I</B>
<P><B>was living in the city of Los Angeles, seedy area, near MacArthur
Park.</B>
<P><B>I was 17 years old then and I am one of those who don't believe in
the</B>
<P><B>supernatural! But after this experience I am not so guick brushing
off</B>
<P><B>something like this again! I was living with an alcoholic mom. I
slept</B>
<P><B>in the closet behind old fashioned wall bed in an apartment. The
reason</B>
<P><B>for this is that the closet's dark and cool. I wanted to sleep</B>
<P><B>undisturbed during the night from my alcoholic mom often keeps me up
the</B>
<P><B>night! What happened at 2:15 A.M. on the 17th of September was an</B>
<P><B>unforgettable event for me! Mom woked me up and was crying
hysterically.</B>
<P><B>I had assumed her drinking, as usual, had something to do with this.
But</B>
<P><B>her behavior was entirely out of character for her! I know how she</B>
<P><B>behaves when drunken but that morning it was something else! It seem</B>
<P><B>something scared her and sobered her up quickly. She was telling me
that</B>
<P><B>Aunt Jean (mom's older sister) had passed away.  I looked around our</B>
<P><B>small apartment and therewas no one else around excepted for two of
us.</B>
<P><B>I asked her who told her that Jean had passed away? We did not have
a</B>
<P><B>phone as we cannot hear (Deaf) hence don't need one. She replied that</B>
<P><B>Jean had appeared before her (mom) in bed. Mom saw Jean's saddened
face</B>
<P><B>looking at her . Mom knew immediately that Jean had died. Gee, I was
not</B>
<P><B>one to believed this stuff and mom knew it. I assumed her drinking
made</B>
<P><B>her seeing things. She looked at me and said,"Frankie, I know you
don't</B>
<P><B>believe me! You think I am drunk!". She continued crying. I stayed
up</B>
<P><B>with her comforting her for about 45 minutes then went back to bed.</B>
<P><B>While I was lying in bed I looked around in the dark closet  </B>
<P><B>pondering what was happening. I had strange feelings that night even
tho</B>
<P><B>I had not witnessed anything or seen Jean's apparition . I woked up
10</B>
<P><B>in the morning and found mom sitting in a chair and crying . She
looked</B>
<P><B>at me and was upset that I did not believed her. She wrote a note and</B>
<P><B>had me walked over to grandma's. Grandma (mom's mom) lived two blocls</B>
<P><B>from us.  I had met my step grandfather half way to their place.
Grandpa</B>
<P><B>told me that Jean died at 2 tjhis morning! He was on the way to let
us</B>
<P><B>know! I was stunned to say the least! When we walked in mom looked
up at</B>
<P><B>me and screamed," I told you Jean's dead! You did not believed me and</B>
<P><B>thought I was drunk!" . Step grandfather was stunned and puzzled. Mom</B>
<P><B>asked him if Jean was dead. He replied yes. What am I to make of this!
I</B>
<P><B>cannot say it was merely a coincidence! It's too much for me to write
it</B>
<P><B>off as coincidence! I know somehow mom was able to get the
information</B>
<P><B>that Jean had passed away. Jean must have somehow communicated to mom</B>
<P><B>from the grave! Now mom's dead. She died while her twin sister Mary
was</B>
<P><B>in coma (hospital). One week later Mary passed awaywithout ever</B>
<P><B>regaining ger consciousness! Mom lived longer mentally than Mary but</B>
<P><B>Mary lived physically longer than mom. They shared everything in life
as</B>
<P><B>twins even in death! They are buried beside each other! I grew up in
a</B>
<P><B>family with strange bondness! I am the sole survivor of the family
since</B>
<P><B>I was in my teens. They are all dead but my memory of them lives on,</B>
<P><B>especially those strange events! Frank</B>

<H3><A NAME=night>Night Encounters</A>
</H3><P><B>by Ultraman1a@AOL.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I never really put much stock in "ghost stories."  In fact, I
consider</B>
<P><B>myself very stable and mature.  I am a professional, 35 year old
father</B>
<P><B>of three.  It started about five years ago.  My wife moved out of
state</B>
<P><B>for several months.  Her company relocated and she was sent to help</B>
<P><B>establish the business in the new state.  During the nine months that</B>
<P><B>she was away, I felt as if someone was in my bedroom with me.  It was
an</B>
<P><B>overpowering feeling.  I would talk with my wife each night by phone
and</B>
<P><B>tell her about the strange feeling.  She thought I was just not used
to</B>
<P><B>sleeping alone and was "spooked."  Several times, I could feel the
bed</B>
<P><B>moving and a pressure pushing down on spots in the bed.  On nights
when</B>
<P><B>my then 5 year old daughter would sleep in our bed, the "thing" would</B>
<P><B>not be there.  Truth be told, I was  relieved when my daughter wantd
to</B>
<P><B>sleep in our bed. Couldn't believe a grown man was afraid to sleep</B>
<P><B>alone.  When my wife's duty was over and she moved back home, the</B>
<P><B>"Hauntings" stopped.  Until recently...</B>
<P>
<P><B>Last week, my wife,sister-in-law and children went on a camping trip.
 I</B>
<P><B>could not go due to business.  On the second night they were away I
felt</B>
<P><B>the base of my bed depress and the covers press up tight against me.
 I</B>
<P><B>laid still thinking that I was going crazy and this could not be</B>
<P><B>happening.  I kept telling myself, "This is not happening..Stop it."
but</B>
<P><B>it kept touching me.  Very gently pressing my calves and inner thighs.
</B>
<P><B>I rolled over to my side and pulled the covers up tight against me.
</B>
<P><B>-still determined that "this was not happening."  Then I felt strong</B>
<P><B>pressure on my hips.  At that point, I flew out of the room and slept
on</B>
<P><B>the couch the remainder of the night.  I told my wife about it and
I</B>
<P><B>think she somewhat beleived me.  Nothing more happened until last
night.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I went to bed late, around 3:00 a.m.  I just got into bed when I felt</B>
<P><B>pressure on the base of the bed.  At first I thought it was my
daughter</B>
<P><B>Emily who occassionally gets frightened by a dream and runs to our
bed. </B>
<P><B>-But it wasn't.  I felt the bed depressing as if someone was crawling
on</B>
<P><B>all fours over my body. This encounter was the most vivid and</B>
<P><B>"strongest."  I felt emense pressure as it "hugged" me.  I could feel</B>
<P><B>something touching my lips and cheek.  I called for my wife and she</B>
<P><B>awoke. She told me everything was alright and held me.  Nothing more</B>
<P><B>happened...</B>
<P>
<P><B>I don't know what or why this is happening.  If I was going crazy why</B>
<P><B>does this only happen at night when I am in bed?</B>

<H3><A NAME=gloria>My Friend Gloria</A>
</H3><P><B>by deborah.wasserman@Sun.COM </B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a about afriend of mine who killed herself, This is the</B>
<P><B>fast forward version year 1997:</B>
<P>
<P><B>I went ghost hunting a bit on my B-day.A friend of mine took me </B>
<P><B>to lunch at the le Baron hotel in San Jose, Calif, which </B>
<P><B>(suppose to be) is haunted, And I know the ghost personaly, A friend</B>
<P><B>of mine killed her self there in 1979, at the time there was a big</B>
<P><B>article written in the paper about her and the fact that the maids
and </B>
<P><B>guest were complainting about strange things happening</B>
<P><B>in the room where she kill her self. According to the paper (there
are </B>
<P><B>2 stories, one from the local newspaper and one from the Enquirer).</B>
<P>
<P><B>The story goes:</B>
<P><B>(Please note that ** are my comments.)</B>
<P>
<P><B>Gloria Marcus was found dead of a drug over dose in room #538</B>
<P><B>of the Le Baron hotel in down town San Jose, a maid found her</B>
<P><B>body. Hotel mananger Ralfeal Molter called in physic Silvia Brown</B>
<P><B>after getting several complaints from maids and guests about hearing</B>
<P><B>whisperings and sobbings coming from the room, and seeing a figure</B>
<P><B>in a white coat or robe with long black hair. </B>
<P>
<P><B>**Gloria had long black hair.**</B>
<P>
<P><B>The maid told the reporters that when cleaning the room they would
hear</B>
<P><B>water coming from the bathroom and hear someone whispering their
name,</B>
<P><B>Someone would also tug on their hair.</B>
<P>
<P><B>**Strangely Gloria use to wash her face, I swear 10 times a day, and</B>
<P><B>when she would talk to you face to face, she had a habit of reaching</B>
<P><B>out and bushing your hair off your shoulder**</B>
<P>
<P><B>They would also feel someone watching them clean the room. when
finished</B>
<P><B>cleaning and leaving the room when they would close the door they
would</B>
<P><B>hear the chain on the door sliding into place. when the maid would
re</B>
<P><B>open the door the chain would be swinging.they would than hear soft</B>
<P><B>sobbing. and the bible in the room would be turned to the first page</B>
<P><B>of PSALMS. Physic Sylvia Brown told reporters that she gets the
feeling</B>
<P><B>that when Gloria realized that she had taken too many pills she tired</B>
<P><B>desperately to call her sister but passed out before completing the</B>
<P><B>call,</B>
<P><B>the story mentioned that the phone was on the floor. Silvia Brown
says</B>
<P><B>that Gloria deperately wants her family to know that she is ok and
that</B>
<P><B>she didn't mean to kill her self. Gloria's family refuse to believe</B>
<P><B>anything about the stories.</B>
<P>
<P><B>**You know the thing about her trying to call someone struck a funny</B>
<P><B>cord in me at the time because the day she died, when I got home</B>
<P><B>from work @ 5 pm, my mom told me that I had received a strange phone</B>
<P><B>call</B>
<P><B>from a girl who was looking for me and that the girl sounded drunk</B>
<P><B>(my mom chewed me out) That the girl just kept saying/asking for deb</B>
<P><B>over </B>
<P><B>and over, my mom kept telling her I was at work.it wasn't until the
next</B>
<P><B>day that we heard Gloria died, makes me wonder if she was trying to
call</B>
<P><B>me,</B>
<P><B>not her sister, because  Sylvia brown could of mistaken</B>
<P><B>me for her sister, we look alike. My mom told me to go to the Hotel</B>
<P><B>(after the articles) and to tell Gloria to go on to the next life,</B>
<P><B>that maybe she did not know she was gone or needed to be told.</B>
<P><B>I was only 21 at the time and you would not of gotten me there for</B>
<P><B>all the tea in china :-) no way. Well I am older and wiser, not</B>
<P><B>to mention braver and my co worker and I went and had lunch there,</B>
<P><B>we took pictures (the camera would not work at first, leslie accused</B>
<P><B>me of breaking it) than it worked, I was hopeing the pictures would
show</B>
<P><B>something but there was nothing. We asked the waitress and bartender</B>
<P><B>and they told us that yes Gloria was still there and for us to come</B>
<P><B>back and rent the room. I'm still thinking about doing just that,</B>
<P><B>The hotel is a bit expensive.</B>
<P><B>My mom has always wanted me to do this since I have always had the</B>
<P><B>ability to</B>
<P><B>know before hand when something is going to happen. I got this
feeling</B>
<P><B>when I got to the fifth floor, the air felt thick and I got the
feeling</B>
<P><B>I was being watched......</B>
<P>
<P><B>Any comments are welcome, and if you had heard this before let me
know</B>
<P><B>I would be interested.</B>

<H3><A NAME=floor>The Third Floor Mystery</A>
</H3><P><B>by rcm@bright.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Since as long as I can remember, I have had strange things that</B>
<P><B>happen to me at our house.(Our house is over 250 years old) I could</B>
<P><B>always hear someone walking or running up stairs on the third floor.
</B>
<P><B>Another time I heard music and a whole bunch of voices, that were
pretty</B>
<P><B>loud, up stairs on the third</B>
<P><B>floor.                                          When I was 14 years
old,</B>
<P><B>I had a slumber party. We slept up on the third floor, I had a little</B>
<P><B>idea to see if they heard or saw anything up on the third floor. It
was</B>
<P><B>about 1:00 in the morning, we heard someone moving around the room,
but</B>
<P><B>we were all in a circle, so it couldn't be one of us girls. so we
looked</B>
<P><B>around the room and saw nothing at first.      Then I saw a shadow
move</B>
<P><B>and then I saw the figure running straight towards me. I got really</B>
<P><B>scared and couldn't move, the figure ran straight through me. I
didn't</B>
<P><B>even realize that, I was in shock.That figure turned around and
called</B>
<P><B>my name,then disappeared. That night none of us got any sleep. </B>
<P><B>    The next night I was having trouble sleeping,I have was still</B>
<P><B>thinking about what happened the night before. I was finally going
off</B>
<P><B>to sleep when a shadow moved in my room. The figure was moving right</B>
<P><B>toward me. Then the figure stopped right by my bedside, looking at
me. I</B>
<P><B>was in scared, and didn't do anything. I finally saw the figure, it
was</B>
<P><B>a ghost of a teenage boy, looked about 17. He told me to follow him,
so</B>
<P><B>I got up and followed him. He lead me up to the third floor and I saw</B>
<P><B>something I could not beleive, It was a slumber party going on, just</B>
<P><B>like mine. But it was all guyz. Then it disappeared, and I realized
it</B>
<P><B>was a flashback of something that of the past that happened in the
house</B>
<P><B>I live in.</B>
<P><B>    I looked up past things that were in the newspaper about my
house,</B>
<P><B>and I found an article about a teenager of 17 was murdered in the
house</B>
<P><B>I live in now!! It had a picture of the teenager that was murdered</B>
<P><B>there. It was the ghost I saw the night before. I was scared what was</B>
<P><B>going on. I went home and mentioned what I found out about our house
to</B>
<P><B>my parents. They didn't really care about that. So I told my friens</B>
<P><B>about it, and they wanted to stay there again, at my house on the
third</B>
<P><B>floor. I didn't know what to say, so they stayed the night again. And</B>
<P><B>the same thing happened again as the last time they stayed at my
house.</B>
<P><B>    I haven't yet figure out what he wants me to see, but He keepes</B>
<P><B>haunting me at night, in m dreams, beckoning me to help him. I'm 15</B>
<P><B>years old now, and the haunting continues. When I stop the haunting,
I</B>
<P><B>will finish my true story about the ghost.</B>

<H3><A NAME=apartment>Haunted Apartment</A>
</H3><P><B>by sds130@psu.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>Nothing big, just an odd occurence, possibly a dream, similar to a
story</B>
<P><B>on your page (Attacked by Ghost)</B>
<P><B>I am 22 and live in an apartment at Penn State (during school).</B>
<P><B>Our apartment was rumored to be haunted.  Someone died in our
apartment</B>
<P><B>(was pushed down steps).  The upper level was boarded up and we were
not</B>
<P><B>to open it.  Well, curiosity got the best of us.  There was nothing</B>
<P><B>really exciting up here, but some odd things stared happening.
 Nothing</B>
<P><B>major, almost unnoticable.  One night I was describing one of these</B>
<P><B>stories on the internet via email.  I heard my modem click off.  This</B>
<P><B>was not unusual, because my roomates have a habit of picking up the</B>
<P><B>phone.  I kept typing and then all of the sudden everything on the</B>
<P><B>screen disappeared.  It had never happened before and there is no</B>
<P><B>command to get it to do that.  I asked my roomate about picking up
the</B>
<P><B>phone and he hadnt.  Again, nothing that couldnt have happened somehow.
</B>
<P><B>Well later that night (around 2 or 3), I was up studying.  I saw a
green</B>
<P><B>smoke like mist come out of my closet.  It sorta had a face that was</B>
<P><B>forming, but nothing solid.  It hovered over me.  I couldnt move or</B>
<P><B>breathe.  I tried to scream, but nothing came out.  I shook
violently,</B>
<P><B>but was not moving.  It seemed to be coming into me.  All of the
sudden</B>
<P><B>it started to leave and I ran out into the living room.  I was</B>
<P><B>terrified, and put on all of the lights and television.  To this day,
I</B>
<P><B>still think that it was  a dream, but I dont remember falling asleep
&amp; I</B>
<P><B>dont remember waking up.  It seemed too real to be a dream.  Similar</B>
<P><B>things have happened since, but I did fall asleep before-hand and
they</B>
<P><B>werent as intense ( I think they are a flashback sort of dream). </B>
<P><B>Although I kind of think its a dream, every so often I get nervous
like</B>
<P><B>i feel something is there, and something small will happen (only in
my</B>
<P><B>apartment at school), such as noises, or a ceiling tile in the
bathroom</B>
<P><B>move, but nothing that cant be explained away.</B>

<H3> <A NAME=school>Ghost at My School</A>
</H3><P><B>by gawkey@worldnet.att.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi. I was seaching through the web and ran into this site. I have a
story</B>
<P><B>to tell about my school. About 4 years ago, these two boys were
ditching</B>
<P><B>class. We have a really big autorium in our school. Anyways, they were
in</B>
<P><B>the back of it and they climbed these stairs that led to the vents.
On of</B>
<P><B>the vents led to the roof, which was their destination. The rest of
the</B>
<P><B>vents contains really big fans. They were crawling through the vents
and</B>
<P><B>somehow the fans got turned on. By the janitor I guess. The guy in
front</B>
<P><B>thought that the next vent was the one that led to the roof and he
stuck</B>
<P><B>his head up to see. Needless to say, he didn't make it. I was in
school</B>
<P><B>that day and was at lunch. Everyone on campus heard a scream. It
really</B>
<P><B>upset us all. The guy that lived is now in Whitfield which is a
mental</B>
<P><B>instution here in Jackson, Mississippi. When we have programs in the</B>
<P><B>autorium, you can still see the blood on the floor. Not much but like</B>
<P><B>droppings of it. There is always that one part that is always so very
cold.</B>
<P><B>I sat in a seat above the vent one time and got goosebumps. I kept
feeling</B>
<P><B>chills of wind. I am going to stop wasteing your time. Thank you for
it. </B>

</B>
<P><B>course, when I was a girl growing up, my friends and I would sit up
late </B>
<P><B>and tell frightening stories, each of us trying our hardest to scare
the </B>
<P><B>others.  I used to think that monsters and ghosts lurked around each
and </B>
<P><B>every corner and I was always prepared for the worst.  Naturally, as
the </B>
<P><B>years passed, I would dismiss all gut feelings and scares as an </B>
<P><B>over-active imagination.  I thought that palpable things were reality
</B>
<P><B>and nothing really ever phased me... that was until my family moved
from </B>
<P><B>my home town of Pueblo, CO to the small, yuppie haven of Evergreen.
 It </B>
<P><B>was a gorgeous place... my mom and I would drive there every week-end
</B>
<P><B>searching for that +perfect+ place that we would call home.  Well,
I </B>
<P><B>wasn't with mom when she found the house that we were to purchase.
 </B>
<P><B>While I was still in school, she and my stepdad ventured out into the
</B>
<P><B>deep forrest with the realtor and found the "dream" house.  I remember
</B>
<P><B>her coming home and telling me all about it.  It sounded great.  And
</B>
<P><B>then, I started having these dreams.  I dreamt of my new room and there
</B>
<P><B>was an old vanity in it.  In my dream, I would look into the mirror
and </B>
<P><B>I would see the reflection of a golden retrievor in the glass.  I would
</B>
<P><B>stare at the dog and then, in every dream, I would see a man standing
</B>
<P><B>behind the glass of the mirror staring at me.  That is all that he
would </B>
<P><B>do, was stare and his eyes really gave me the creeps.  I had the same
</B>
<P><B>dream over and over again.  I had not yet seen the new house and you
can </B>
<P><B>imagine my horror when the room that I was to live in was the SAME
room </B>
<P><B>in my dream.  Also, our new neighbors had two golden retrievors named
</B>
<P><B>duke and daisy and the window of my new room was ground level, so the
</B>
<P><B>dogs could easily look into my window.  Well, to make it all worse,
mom </B>
<P><B>decided to put my late great-grandmother's vanity in my room.  Now,
I </B>
<P><B>tried not to think too much about all of this and I tryed my hardest
to </B>
<P><B>dismiss everything as a nice coincidence (kinda wierd... but nice all
</B>
<P><B>the same.)  Well, One night, I was trying to fall asleep and my </B>
<P><B>imagination went wild.  I thought that I heard someone breathing right
</B>
<P><B>next to my ear.  Well, I just layed there in my bed concentrating on
</B>
<P><B>falling asleep.  I then heard ( I KNOW that I heard this) foot-steps
on </B>
<P><B>my carpet and something rustling some shopping bags that were lying
on </B>
<P><B>my floor.  I Lost it at that point.  I quickly got out of bed and ran
</B>
<P><B>upstairs to my mom's room.  I was in tears when I woke her up.  I told
</B>
<P><B>her that something was down-stairs.  I was so distraught that mom </B>
<P><B>actually got the small pistol that she keeps in her nightstand out.
 She </B>
<P><B>went down-stairs and searched everywhere.  Of course nothing happened.
 </B>
<P><B>I was 16 years old and I had not slept with my mom since I had been
at </B>
<P><B>least 7.  I refused to go down to my room and ended up sleeping with
</B>
<P><B>mom.  I stayed in the guest room for the next couple of months, going
to </B>
<P><B>my room only when ABSOLUTELY necessary.  Well, nothing really happened
</B>
<P><B>after that, until my friend Mecale stayed the night.  She brought her
</B>
<P><B>"poweful" oija board.  Earlier that day, one of my old friends had
</B>
<P><B>called me with a problem.  HEr boyfriend had been cheating on her.
 I </B>
<P><B>had told only my mom about it.  I never mentioned it to mecale and
she </B>
<P><B>did not even know my other friend.  Well I was VERY upset about all
of </B>
<P><B>this.  Mecale asked a "spirit" that we were talking to about what was
</B>
<P><B>upsetting me.  The board spelled out Aaron.... THE NAME OF THE FRIEND"S
</B>
<P><B>BOYFRIEND!!!!!  I just stared at the board in disbelief... we then
asked </B>
<P><B> the "spirit" some other questions.  I guess it thought that was pretty
</B>
<P><B>and that is why it was bugging me.  It said that it was not the thing
</B>
<P><B>that had  been in my room that hight I freaked ouut but that it would
</B>
<P><B>protect me from the thing that had been in my room.  I invited it to...
</B>
<P><B>and that is shen things REALLY weird started happening.  My cat would
</B>
<P><B>freak out and stare at nothing and I always had the feeling of something
</B>
<P><B>being there.  I asked my "protector" to leave me ( I did this because
I </B>
<P><B>could not handle the thoughts of "ghosts").  After I asked it to go...
</B>
<P><B>everything stopped.  I don't  know if I am just REALLY imaginative
or </B>
<P><B>what... i DO KNOW THIS!  I almost have a BA in international business,
I </B>
<P><B>am a legal spesialist in the US Army and I tend to think of myself
as </B>
<P><B>very RATIONAL woman.  Despite all of this, I still can't talk about
what </B>
<P><B>happened to me without feeling chills crawl up my back.  I don't know
if </B>
<P><B>ghosts are real... but I hope NEVER to experiance that again.</B>
