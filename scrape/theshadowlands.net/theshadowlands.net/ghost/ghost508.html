<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">I
go to Albuquerque for work and stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in uptown,
ABQ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On a recent visit on August 4, when
standing at the checkin counter, my top-heavy suitcase<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>fell over.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The gal behind the desk laughed and said "well we DO have ghosts
around here".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not think much
of it and we laughed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That night I was
laying in bed at 240 in the morning, awake, when I felt something about
the
size of a cat or dog was traveling between the mattress and box springs
from
about my buttock level up along by body towards my head.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When this "thing" got to my
shoulder the mattress lifted me up about 1 foot so that the corner of
the mattress
with me on it was up off the box springs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This startled me so bad that I jumped out of bed, turned on the
light
and was afraid to look under the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
seriously thought someone was under my bed and was going to attack me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I finally did look under the bed and in
between the mattress and box springs and nothing was there.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>This hotel has adjustable mattresses where
you can dial in a soft or more firm mattress.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I spend about a half hour playing with the dial to see if I
could
recreate this occurrence and explain what had happened by finding out
that the
mattress had maybe malfunctioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
never did find out what that was but it scared the heck out of me and
the fact
that the front desk girl made a comment about ghosts&#8230;&#8230;.very weird.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">I
started a blog shortly after all of this started happening to us so I
could
recount what's happen. Since then, my family has moved out of the
house...
First, a little pre-story: In the final months before my husband I
moved over
here, things lined up pretty well that we figured God had a pretty damn
good
plane for us. So, as of June 14th, our 2 year wedding anniversary, we
officially moved over to Eastern Washington. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">We
moved into our rental house on the 2nd of August. When I saw it, it was
the
perfect place. Nice little quaint, 110 year old house with history and
possibilities. Things started to happen to my husband for the first
week while
I was at work (I worked nights at the time). My husband at one point,
texted me
saying that something was in the house. I told him that if he wanted,
we could
invite over the pastor from our church and have him pray over the
house. So we
set a date night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">On
the 11th of August, we had<span style="">&nbsp; </span>pastor Dennis
from our old Nazarine church come over and pray with us. Pastor, his
wife, my
husband and I were all in the living room, praying for the house and
the
spirits that might have been trapped and that was the night I fully
accepted
Christ into my life. My husband was already a Christian and we've had
our
daughter dedicated when she was born and all that's left is my baptism.
Between
the 11th and 12th at 0230, I remember waking up because my foot hurt
and I felt
the burning. By that time, my hubby and daughter woke up as well and he
turned
on the light and there was a good 10-12 cat-like scratches on the top
of my
left foot. Right off the bat, I knida knew what it was from and my
hubby said
the same thing to me, out loud, and we really didn't sleep that much
that
night. I kept on freaking out and having worse-case scenarios run
through my head.
But most of all, I couldn't get out of my head the 'why me?' bit.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two days later, as I was getting
dressed, my
hubby started freaking out because I had the same scratches down my
back that
were on my foot. So, we got pastor Denny and his wife over from the
Assembly of
God church we go to now and we prayed in every room after the pastor
anointed
us and every doorway with oil. When we were praying in every room, the
pastors
wife started speaking in tongues and I just about fainted. They both
said that I
was filled and "drunk" off of the Holy Spirit. But before all of this
transpired with the two pastors, my hubby was able to get pictures of a
face in
the bedroom wall in my daughter's room and every room after that had
orbs in
the pictures. After we had the second pastor do his thing, we took pics
again
and there was nothing in them. Shortly after, Phil fell off the back
porch (now
confesses he felt a 'push' from behind). I partly <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">saw
him go down, but it's kinda of odd that he would fall in the first
place. Turns
out, the stairs were slippery as shit also. He ended up spraining his
left knee
and ankle.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two weeks after, Phil was
working out by the shed, splitting wood. As I was walking home, I saw
him
swinging the axe. No more than ten minutes of me being inside the
house, I get
this text from Phil saying he needs me. I went back outside thinking he
needed
me to help bring in the wood. Not so. Phil's on the ground, crying, and
holding
his face. At first I thought he hit himself in the face with the recoil
from
the axe. Through sobs, he managed to say that his ankle hurt. He
hobbled to the
trailer and I went back inside to grab his crutches. We ended up going
to the
hospital again- this time he had a high ankle sprain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The last few nights, Phil and I talked and we
both noticed that this kind of thing only happens after we've had some
serious
prayer over/for us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">I
read many of the stories on your site and decided tell one of my own.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the scariest and most unexplainable
thing that has ever happened to me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First, I&#8217;ll give a little background information. I grew up on a
farm in
rural south Georgia, and spent a great deal of my free time fishing,
hunting,
and exploring, and always doing this by myself, since there weren&#8217;t a
lot of
other kids around and I had only a younger sister.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I never really experienced any fear of
anything (other than being late for dinner) all the years I was growing
up, and
can&#8217;t recall any paranormal experiences other than the one I am about
to share
with you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a best friend from
school that I started &#8220;hanging out&#8221; with after we became old enough to
drive
and got our trucks (required for country boys).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the next two years we did most of our hunting and fishing
and troublemaking
together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After we graduated from high
school we even went to the same local college and continued to hang out.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My granddaddy owned a farm in the same county
that we lived in, and I would go deer hunting on his land sometimes,
but I had
never taken my friend there with me. Behind my grandparent&#8217;s house were
several
barns, then several large fields, then a large pond with a swampy area,
then a
large pasture that stretched from one side of their property to the
other
(property line to property line).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
wooded area was immediately behind the pasture and also encompassed the
entire
back side of the property. The woods were also enclosed on the back and
on each
side with a four foot tall fence, since cows were allowed into the
pasture and
wooded area at times. (You will soon see why all this detail is
important)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the 3 sides of the wooded
area were large
open fields belonging to the neighbors, with each field belonging to a
different neighbor. (Take note that there are no more trees or woods
close
by).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the fall of our first year
in college, I had scouted these woods and put up two deer stands, one
on each
side of the property, on the property lines, but also close to very
active deer
trails and signs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These stands were no
more than 100 yards apart, and about 150 yards into the woods from the
pasture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I decided one weekend to treat
my friend to my little hunting paradise, although I had yet to see
anything
other than squirrels all season long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
went into the woods about 4:00pm, with it being dark by 6:00pm.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I took him to his stand then proceeded across
the woods to mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just after the sun
went down, I heard my friend whistle loudly, obviously trying to get my
attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I whistled back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He whistled again, as though he didn&#8217;t hear
me. Again, I whistled back, even louder this time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was no response.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 5
minutes passed, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">then
I heard him whistle again, but he was closer to me than he should have
been,
but still through the woods somewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
found this very strange, since we were supposed to sit in our stands
until
after dark then meet up in the pasture to walk back out to the house.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>He whistled again, and was even closer, and I
could then tell that he was almost running, and he started calling out
my
name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He sounded panicked, and was coming
straight toward me, although there is no way he could know where my
deer stand
was, since he had never been here before and I didn&#8217;t respond to him
until he
called my name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I climbed down from my
tree stand as he approached, and when I got on the ground he ran up and
said,
&#8220;We gotta get outta here!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something BIG
is after me!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of joining him in
the rush I stood there looking and listening.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sure enough, in a few seconds it sounded like a bulldozer was
coming
through the woods, but without the engine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I could hear trees breaking and large bushes being shaken and
trampled&#8230;.and it was coming right at me with the sound becoming
deafening, as
though it were right on top of us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
started running down the fence headed for the pasture and realized that
my
friend had run ahead of me and stopped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When he saw me running he took off running again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We ran as fast as we could through the woods
with the sound of massive destruction right on our heels.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As we broke out into the pasture and got
about 50 feet from the edge of the woods the sound stopped.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We continued to run until we were half way
across the pasture and turned to look at each other as we ran, both
realizing
that either we were no longer being chased, or there was just nothing
to be
torn and crushed in the pasture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We both
stopped and turned around, dropping to the ground and shouldering our
rifles,
aiming to kill whatever was behind us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To our amazement, there was nothing there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
daylight was almost gone, causing the
woods to appear as nothing more than a black blob.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I told my friend to get up and run for the
pond while I guard the rear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he
would stop and guard the rear while I ran to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
meeting up again at the pond, we both
walked in silence back to my grandparent&#8217;s house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
got into our separate trucks and drove to
our parents&#8217; houses, not mentioning this event until <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">many
years later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We still remained close
friends then and even today, but we still don&#8217;t know what happened in
the woods
that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did return to those woods
a week later by myself, but in the middle of the day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I walked over the entire wooded area, and
never saw even one broken branch or bush.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I walked in the fields around the wooded area and saw no large
or
unusual footprints.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend never
returned
to those woods with me, though I returned many times, day and night,
and I
never again experienced any strange occurrences or sounds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I know there was nothing physical in the
woods that night, but whatever it was obviously did not want my friend
there,
and he got the point loud and clear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Just
thought I would take a moment and share a few things with you.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>First of all, THANK YOU for your website!<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I've been a fan for so many years I don't
remember. I am familiar with more than a handful of your listings
through
personal experience as well as locally published lore and word of
mouth. The
Craven Hall (Warminster, PA) entity does in fact exist and I have seen
him at
the window-- what a shocker. It was late at night and I was coming home
from a
hospital in downtown Philadelphia, totally exhausted. I glanced over
through
the rain and when I realized what I saw I looked back and he was gone.
Locally,
there are many people at EMS who talk about the Warminster Ambulance
Corps
ghost. I know several people who have had the daylights scared out of
them
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As for the Keshena, Wisconsin Hwy
VV note. My father-in-law lives on the Menominee Reservation. Hwy VV is
just
about the biggest road through the res. Talking to him this evening,
the topic
of this listing came up. He was quite aware of the 'eyes' you mention.
With the
locals it is joked about. According to him, the eyes are actually
reflectors
that can be seen coming into Keshena from the Shawano direction. The
perspective, according to dad, is such that it looks like there are
these huge
glowing eyes, but in fact the reflectors are actually about twenty feet
apart.
It just gets creepy looking at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
too has heard tell of the Casino children you mention. It's not much
talked
about with the <span style="">&nbsp;</span>locals, as to them the
idea of children trapped in the limbo of haunting is nothing short of
tragic. I
forgot to ask him about the Sheriff's office. However my mother in law
is a
department head there and I will ask her if she knows anything about
the
haunting there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thanks again for
maintaining such a great site.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

stories from all those brave enough to share their experiences!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">I
have, for the last 6 months or so have had what amounts to a very weird
sort of
massage on my lower legs when I go to bed. It seems I'm the only one it
"works" on as my wife has never commented on it. This
"massage" takes place at different times(as I really don't have a set
time <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">anymore)after
I hit the sack. It always starts with a firm pressure being applied to
my ankle
area(not in a forceful way mind you)and a sort of rocking side to side
motion
going up to my thigh area. It almost feels like something a cat would
do when
it gets ready to go to sleep, but without the pressure on my ankles. I
can also
feel the pressure being applied to the mattress as well during this
event.
There is no scent/odor" or sound associated with this event so I'm not
sure what to make of it. I don't know a lot about the house, but know
it has
been occupied consistently for the last 10 years or so.I know of no
deaths in
it, but will have to do a little digging around to make sure.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>As I have stated already the
"massage" does not have a forceful/aggressive nature to it and almost
always last 5 or so minutes. I have "asked" whoever is doing
this<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to make some sort of noise as a
response, but have not received a response as of yet. I want to use a
tape
player in the room to see if I can get an EVP and ask the questions
again, maybe
get lucky!! That's it for now.....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this day I have no explanation, but an extraordinary event that I wish
I can
experience again, was one of calmness. Early May 2nd 1987, my then
husband and
I sat in our living room couch watching television,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>just a<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>few days before we had buried my 16 year old sister Monica who
died of
lupus. It was a nice warm normal evening in southern california. All of
a
sudden in the middle of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>our living room
there were 2 orbs of light coming at each other from opposite
directions.. they
crashed into each other then produced a brilliant lightening bolt,<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>like thunder and lightening but in the
middle of our<span style="">&nbsp; </span>living room..<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>no rain outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sat there
..looked at each other as it was
happening but we remained sitting as if mesmerized or hypnotized.
Neither one
of us had a sense of fear.. We were awe stricken at what we had just
witnessed
but had no true explanation. It wasn't one person witnessing this it
was both
of us. It was a beautiful experience.. like watching souls roaming
through our
lives without hesitation. Only wish I could experience it again.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Was it my sister or my sister being guided by
another soul. Or just other souls that just happened to be there.<span

story is about my dad, he's 72 years old when he passed away last march
because
of late stage lung cancer. 2 months before he died he did not have any
symptoms
of his illness until it was too late. he is a very religious person and
never
believed in ghost. he has a very strong faith in God until his last
breath. the
incident happened somewhere around january of this year(he does not
have any
symptoms yet). the whole family likes to to this restaurant about 12
miles away
from my house and the way there is to pass by the manassas battlefield
park. it
was around 6 pm in the evening and since its winter time-it was already
dark
and we are on way way home. we pass by the entrance to the park and i
was
driving. my mom and dad were sitting in the back of the van. if there
was
somebody beside the road, i will be the first one to see it. probably
after 2
miles after passing the entrance- my dad all of the sudden mention
something
about a person "all white" standing in front of the entrance. he said
he didn't say a word right then and then because it might scared
us-especially
my wife who pass by there every day. i ask him to described the entity
the he
saw-he said he knows its a person but couldn't see its face but <span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>its wearing all white. i swear i did not see
anybody there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>after he passed away- i
just realized that date was exactly a month before he was diagnosed

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">I
was beginning life over again at 42 years of age, having recently ended
a
decade long abusive marriage. With a protective order in hand and a car
full of
photo albums and clothes, I traveled 2,800 miles to safety and a new
start on
the opposite coast. I was searching for something really inexpensive to
rent. I
met a couple who had inherited property on which sat the old family
farmhouse.
They built a modern octagon house to live in about an acre back into
the woods.
Now, they wished to rent out the farmhouse, and I fell in love with it
immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I walked through the
house for the first time, I felt embraced by positive energies that
defied the
general unkemptness of the house. Every square inch of floor space was
covered
in trash. The exhaust hood dangled from wires on the stovetop. The wood
stove
was the only source of heat for the cold northeastern winters and
needless to
say, there was no A/C to temper the humid short summers. Upstairs the
entire
south side of the house was bowed due to water damage from siding that
had been
missing for an unknown number of years and the shower wall was
impregnated with
water damage. In the attic, I quickly saw a large snakeskin draped
across the
trellises. Underneath all the years of neglect was the most charming
spacious
farmhouse surrounded by fields and woods. Here is where I made my home
for the
next four years. I must add that these were four of the best years of
my life.
Alas, all good things must come to an end.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I began the cleanup and moved into the house. I never felt
alone, but
there were areas of the house where the energy felt stronger. As my new
friends
came to visit me, the same event would be played out over &amp; over
again. I
would open the door and welcome my friend inside. One step inside, the
intuitive friend would say, &#8220;Wow. There&#8217;s a spirit in here.&#8221; The other
friends
would say, &#8220;Wow, what is that? Can you <i style="">feel</i>
it?&#8221; I always responded the same way. &#8220;Come inside; look around. Go
anywhere
you want. There are three floors. Open any door you want. Go into any
room you
want. Tell me where you feel this energy the strongest.&#8221; I would then
hang back
and give them free roam throughout the house. After completing a
walk-through
of the maze of rooms and hallways and staircases, every single person,
regardless of psychic sensitivity, would stand in the <i style="">exact
same spot</i> in the second floor bedroom with the weird closet. The
spot happens to be directly in front of the weird closet. The weird
closet made
it appear that the floor plan had been altered at some point over the
past 100+
years that it&#8217;s stood. The result was a long narrow space that didn&#8217;t
make
sense as a closet for clothes. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Even
though the energy felt the strongest in that one spot upstairs, that
was not
where most of the activity was seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
sensed some emotions right away. The energy felt like a very loving
&amp;
nurturing presence. I felt quite certain that it was an elderly woman
who had
raised her family in this house. Over time, I became more and more
convinced
that I was correct. At the time, I was a bit frail, shell-shocked and
recovering. I needed a mother and this spirit did her best to be one
for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I would sit at my computer at
night
working on my college papers, at some point I would inevitably hear the
sound
of gentle footsteps coming down the staircase. I would look up
expectedly and
watch the crystal doorknob slowly turn and the door open. I would then
always
extend a greeting; such as, &#8220;Hi! Glad you came downstairs. I&#8217;m working
on my
paper for math class. We&#8217;ve got a test tomorrow.&#8221; Then the door would
gently
close and latch and I would go back to what I was doing. I could feel
the
presence go past me and into the kitchen. I would hear busy sounds
coming from
the kitchen, knowing that I was completely &#8216;alone&#8217;.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On Wednesday nights, I hosted a study group
at my house. There were five of us that got together. We would usually
fix
something to eat first and then study and quiz each other on test
material. One
night after studying, we all decided to watch a movie together. We went
into
the living room and left the dishes in the sink to wash later. During
the
movie, no one got-up, no one went to use the bathroom, every one of us
stayed
seated until the movie was done. When we walked back into the kitchen,
the
dishes were washed and stacked and the counters were wiped clean.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>One afternoon I was having a particularly
rough time. I sat down on the couch, put my face in my hands, and
sobbed and
cried and carried on for a little while. As I began to feel better, the
sobbing
turned into sniffles and I leaned back against the couch. Suddenly,
right there
in broad daylight, I felt my hair stroked back behind my ear followed
by a kiss
on my cheek. Just like a mother comforting her child would do. <span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>I finally became intrigued enough to start
asking questions about the house and its&#8217; previous residents. I learned
that
the house was originally built in 1898 by a farmer for his new wife.
They
raised a family together in this house; the husband eventually died,
the
children grew-up and moved, and the wife lived there alone until her
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here&#8217;s the interesting part about
the weird
closet. It&#8217;s a long and narrow space because it was originally the
stairs going
from the second to the third floor. The wife had a sewing room on the
third
floor. She loved to sew; it was her passion. As she was descending from
her
sewing room, she fell down the stairs and died right there, <i style="">on
the very spot</i>, that the energy is the
strongest. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Saturday
August 6, 2011-A lightbulb slowly flickered and then went out over my
husband,
George's head here in the kitchen and that had been the 3rd in as many
weeks.
I, too, had a lightbulb go out over my head in the living room
previously.
Well, George wanted to go for a ride and he had a very disturbing
feeling that
something is coming. The very night air felt like something would
happen. An
eerie stillness permeated the night and George decides to pick up a
friend and
even she noticed how creepy the night was. We took her for a ride and
then took
her home and went back out and discussed these feelings that we had.
George and
I both agree that we can expect something to happen or some kind of
news.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sunday August 7, 2011 @ 9.52PM-There
was a
thunderstorm and I sat outside on the porch. I was alone and felt so
creeped
out that I could barely stand it. I had a thought of something
happening and
then I heard a thump on the upper side of the house. @10.27PM-I was
inside
after the storm, watching TV and I heard a noise to my right and it
sounded
like it came from my Father-in-law's music instruments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- Thursday August 11, 2011-I called my Mother
and she told me that she was having more casket dreams, this time she
dreamed
of a gray casket in the ground. Then she felt someone sit down on the
bed with
her while she was alone. Plus she heard a knock on their door. Mom said
that
Dad had had that feeling of someone sitting down on the edge of the bed
while
he was alone there too. - Tuesday August 16, 2011 @ 3:00AM-I was
sitting in bed
writing when I heard a crash from the kitchen. Being here alone, I
jumped and went
to see what had happened. My Father-in-law's pans had fallen into the
floor. I
picked them up and went to write the event down. @3.24AM-I heard two
more
noises that were not me and I did not investigate those. @4.02AM-I
heard more
noises that I did not check out. @4.13AM-I went to the bathroom and
came back
into the kitchen and I heard a knock on the wall behind me! I turned
and there
of course was nothing. I went to write it down. I found out too that
George had
heard what sounded like a plate smashing to the floor or on the wall
around 8AM
or so. And of course, he could find nothing to have caused the noise. -
End of
July 2011-I was sound asleep and I heard the frantic knocking that I
always
hear before I hear of a death. Well, it always gets me up and I am
always
groggy. I heard it plainly and went to the door and nothing was there.
George
was with his Dad in his camper and he told me that a delivery guy had
shown up
and I had dismissed it. Well, I started thinking about it this morning,
8/17/11. The knocks I heard were like someone beating the door down and
it was
the same sound as I always hear before I get news of a new death. The
delivery
guy doesn't knock that long or hard he just sets the stuff on the porch
knocks
a few times and leaves. So, I am very sure I had a death warning.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>- Tuesday August 23, 2011@3:00AM-I heard a
dog howling and I heard a loud popping noise that my husband slept
through. I
am writing these things down as they happen and they are really piling
up
again. Also, this evening, my father in law went to the store and the
phone
rang. It was the younger brother of one of Bill's friends who had died
of a
heart attack over 20 years ago. This man has not contacted Bill since
before
his brother had died. Bill called him back and filled him in on what
had
happened in the many years since they had not talked. This reminds me
of before
my grandfather died, his two youngest siblings who lived out of state
called
him on his birthday to talk to him because as they said, they had him
on their
minds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Friday August 19, 2011-Early
AM-I was here alone and my father in law was in his camper. My husband
was at
work and I was watching tv when I saw a light like a car's headlights
fill our
door window even through the blinds. This light did not show up on the
living
room window, just the door and it lasted over 5 seconds. I got up to
look and
nothing was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- January 2011-My
husband, George had a weird experience. He was laying in the living
room floor
and he heard his dad's camper door slam and heard his footsteps come up
to the
door but that was all that happened. Then, George saw a blue light form
on the
couch beside him and it looked like a person's shape sitting there.
Then George
and I both heard the kitchen door close as if someone was leaning on it
from
the other side and there was no one else in this house. Plus George and
I
watched the rocking chair move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-
January 2011-George and I went to visit our friends and while I was
sitting in
a desk chair, a large sheaf of grain in a glass vase slid over towards
me.
Nothing was near the vase and it had stood up there for a while. -
August 18,
2011-A strange phone call turned up on the answering machine. It
sounded like
two people having a conversation but I swear it was George's sister
Amanda. There
was a lot of static and it was hard to understand the conversation but
I made
out these words, "I really really don't know what is going on." She
sounded worried and the overall feeling I got was eerie.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- Around the 23rd of August-I learned that
three men that my father-in-law knew died. One of them had started a
fight in
our local Walmart and when he was hit, he went down and hit his temple
hard and
died as a result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- A few days after
this, I heard my husband call my name but he had not said anything and
no one
else was around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Around the first of
September 2011-my nightlight flickered like crazy and I got up to go
look to
see if a storm was going on but nothing was amiss. My husband said the
electric
had not flickered once. Also in January of 2010-I saw a white light in
my room
where the nightlight would be but found that the nightlight was
unplugged. One
of my husband's aunts died two weeks later.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Okay
my first supernatural experience was going to class getting deja vu
feeling
because I had already heard what my classmates were going to say and do
in a
dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Next we got a phone call from my
moms friend Frank at about noon. I talked with Frank for a little while
before
giving my mom the phone. My mom looked pale after the call and I asked
her what
was wrong? She said, "Frank died at 7:45 this morning of a heart
attack." So I had talked on the phone with a dead man.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was going up to see my brother Chris after
he'd been put into a residential treatment center. I had looked out the
window
during the car ride and saw a woman walking along the side of the
expressway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The woman was dressed the way
Mary the mother
of god is shown in pictures. Not sure if it was Mary or not. No one
else saw
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the friends I had at a camp
had inoperable incurable brain cancer. We prayed for him and the
inoperable
cancer had disappeared the next time he was checked. on by the doctor.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought my mom was calling my name and kept
checking because I kept hearing my name being called. My mom told me to
ask god
what he wanted. I was told that my mom shouldn't drive to church that
day. I
told my mom and she walked to church. There was an accident at the
corner and
if she had been driving she would have been hit and killed.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to the Indian mound Boy Scout camp.
While there we practiced rappelling. I was the last one finished so I
put up
the ropes while the rest of the troop headed for the campfire. While
making my
way there an Indian that was green looking waved at me and walked back
into the
woods. I thought it was a trick of the moon light making him look green
since
we had a group of Indian dancers visiting our multi-troop campfire.
Once there
I found out I was the only person not yet at the campfire and none of
the
costumes matched the outfit I saw the Indian wearing. I went on a night
hike
with my boy scout troop and it looked like something was following us
about
fifty feet back and paralleling our path. After noticing that we heard
loud
pounding noises off to our right back near a wood pile. Then we saw a
green
ball of light go up a tree really fast <span style="">&nbsp;</span>and
come down slowly. At that point we started getting scared so the scout
master
who was an Indian headed to camp while saying a chant to scare away
spirits.
The scout master told us to stay there. After the scout master got over
the
rise in the trail two burning eyes like you see in scary movies
appeared. we
heard a darkly evil voice that said, "Come to me I am more powerful"
the other scouts wanted to run off into the woods. I calmed them down,
and we
waited for the scout master. I got the feeling that it could only hurt
us if we
went to it or got hurt running in the woods. We found that there had
been no other
scouts there except all the way across the campgrounds. Which meant10
or more
miles between our campsite and theirs.We were doing an Indian ceremony
where
everyone had to be silent except for the person performing the
ceremony. Well
one of the boy scouts wouldn't keep quiet and then a wind whipped up
that was
almost strong enough to blow away the tents. Once the boy quit talking
the wind
quit immediately. During another night hike we saw what appeared to be
a small
patch of fog. Problem was fog was heading wrong way into a stiff wind.
Two of
the guys got lost during the hike. The two guys walked into camp
looking pale
and weak. The fog enveloped the two of them the one guy passed out and
the
other heard a voice say, "He is worthy of joining the tribe." We had
been out there trying to determine if we were worthy to become honorary
members
of an Indian tribe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At a prayer meeting
I told a woman that her dog was doing fine. I had never met her before
and the
dog that I had called by name had just died.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After that during a prayer meeting I looked over after being
tapped on a
shoulder and was face to face with my guardian angel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After that during a retreat I was seeing
everyones guardian angel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the bus
stop a guy gave me a very evil feeling and he seemed to be preaching
about god.
I later found out that he was a satianist trying to lure people to be
sacrificed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got a very evil feeling in
my kitchen and got feeling it was a devil. I bound and rebuked it in
the name
of god after calling for the protection of the precious blood of Jesus
Christ.
The evil feeling left after I did that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
got a very bad feeling about the guy who was taking my friend from work
to the
prom. I warned her to watch out for him. She had to kick him in the
chest to
get away when he tried to rape her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was at a prayer meeting again and saw the angel of death walk up to one
of the
prayers members shakes his head three times and walks off. His robe was
brown
not black and carrying an executioners axe but I couldn't see any
extremities
or his face. A week later the woman was diagnosed with terminal cancer
and
given six months to live. She died about three months later.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Now at work I have heard my name being
called. Footsteps on the roof and the Sound of stuff being moved
around. When I
look nothing has been moved and I'm still alone in the building. I have
seen a
black shadowy shape moving when the lights are off. Problem was how was
I
seeing a shadow when it's too dark to see my hand? I have seen a white
shape
moving in the kitchen and there is nothing white in the kitchen. My
co-workers
have seen the white shape moving as well.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have also got the feeling of a woman from pioneer days. I also
got an
image of what the area around my work looked like at that time.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I have seen a man in a suit wearing a hat
walk up next to me. When I turned to talk to him no one was there.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I have also felt like I'm being watched and
gotten feeling something is waiting to jump out at me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have had the thought about hanging in the
hall by a rope. But it's like I was feeling Someone else's thoughts.
Not sure
if someone was hanged in the hall or committed suicide. Not sure if
maybe
someone was trying to get me to commit suicide too so they'd have
company or
just getting residual feeling from when the person died. Not sure if
person
hanged themselves from a rafter or a chandelier. But got feeling it
involved
original ceiling above the drop ceiling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
