<b><font size=+2>Letting us know...</font></b>
<p><b>By: Ladypnther@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>First of all, I should state that these experiences were not experienced
by</b>
<br><b>me, but by my imediate family.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should start like most others explaining the
layout of the house " to</b>
<br><b>give you a better mental picture".&nbsp;&nbsp; The house had " at
the time" a screened in porch.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The front door leads to the living room and dining room" seperated
partially by</b>
<br><b>bookshelves".&nbsp; The first door off to the right imediately after
the front</b>
<br><b>door leads to a bedroom, and a main bathroom" off to the right corner
of the room".</b>
<br><b>Stepping back out into the front room walking the length of the
two rooms the second</b>
<br><b>and last doorway is off to the right, the kitchen" believed to be
the original</b>
<br><b>master bedroom".&nbsp; The door directly in front is another bedroom
with another</b>
<br><b>newer bathroom directly after that.</b>
<br><b>The first story my mother told was one with me being a baby and
my brother in</b>
<br><b>kindergarden.&nbsp; It was around eight pm, my father was working
second shift at</b>
<br><b>a factory.&nbsp; My mother was with my brother finishing up his
homework in the</b>
<br><b>front room when they heard what she described as a heavy book being
dropped</b>
<br><b>on the floor coming from the room I was in.&nbsp; She rushed in
to find me</b>
<br><b>sleeping soundly in my crib, nothing awry.&nbsp; The second story
or incident took place when I was</b>
<br><b>around two.&nbsp; Again it was late at night, my father and brother
were out on a fishing</b>
<br><b>trip with one of my uncles.&nbsp; My mother had me in a highchair
feeding me cerial when,</b>
<br><b>what she described as hard sole footsteps slowly making their way
from one side of</b>
<br><b>the porch to the other" left to right"&nbsp; she went to the front
door, turned on the</b>
<br><b>porchlight and there casts the shadow of a man " or what&nbsp; she
believed could be one"</b>
<br><b>just as though someone was standing at the door themeselves.&nbsp;
But there was noone</b>
<br><b>there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; A period of years went by and nothing seemed to happen.&nbsp;
My mother said she</b>
<br><b>told my father of these two incidences, but she said he never believed</b>
<br><b>her....until he had a story of his own.&nbsp; He was laying down
on his right side close to a</b>
<br><b>TV that was placed in mine and my brother's room " first room off
to the right"&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>mother, my brother and I had just left to go to the next town around
three minutes</b>
<br><b>prior. The door to the bedroom leading to the front room was open.&nbsp;
My father said he</b>
<br><b>remembered hearing and feeling the door open and shut within a few
seconds of</b>
<br><b>each other.&nbsp; For a second he thought my mother had returned
for something but</b>
<br><b>only for a second.... He remembered getting up to look out the bedroom
window" as</b>
<br><b>it faced the porch and driveway" to find no car.&nbsp; This was
after he had no</b>
<br><b>response to the name calling.&nbsp; He then peeked around the doorway
of the bedroom to find</b>
<br><b>our cat staring intently at the front door.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Only one other incidence occured with my brother.&nbsp; It
was in the middle of</b>
<br><b>the night, his bed and dresser were placed in the dining room for
the winter so as to be</b>
<br><b>close to the heater.&nbsp; The foot of his bed faced the doorway
of the kitchen.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>remembers one night of waking to find someone with blonde hair "
believed by him to be</b>
<br><b>a yound man" standing at the foot of his bed.&nbsp; There was an
outside light in our</b>
<br><b>front yard that dully illuminated the front rooom and dining room
as well as the first</b>
<br><b>bedroom. This would aquire for enough light to sufficiently guide
any healthy sighted</b>
<br><b>person through these rooms.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No other incidences " that I've heard about"
have happened .&nbsp; I theorize</b>
<br><b>that this is just a way of the " other side" letting us know both
it and they "</b>
<br><b>the spirits" do exist.&nbsp; There are many different scientific
discussions, theories, and</b>
<br><b>hypothesis on this subject and they are all equally interesting
and entertaining to</b>
<br><b>study, so I&nbsp; suggest you " the reader" do so.</b>

<br><b><font size=+2>My bedroom</font></b>
<p><b>By: Jessica1@Bit-net.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Ever since I was very young I have had a feeling of intrigue towards</b>
<br><b>ghosts and I have never once doubted their experience especially
since I</b>
<br><b>was about seven years old. I cannot remember the exact date of when</b>
<br><b>these happenings began, but I believe it was during the summer.
One</b>
<br><b>night I was sitting up in my bed reading with my cat when suddenly
I was</b>
<br><b>ovetrcome with a jelid, prickly feeling. The cat's back arched and
her</b>
<br><b>fur stood up on end and she bounded out of the room. Ever since
that</b>
<br><b>night, there has been a spirit of some sort inhabiting my room.
He or</b>
<br><b>she is constantly changing the radio stations on my radio from</b>
<br><b>contemporary music to a station that plays only music from the 30s
and</b>
<br><b>40s. Also, The ceiling fan is often seen rotating while the switch</b>
<br><b>remains stationary. Also, the lamp by my desk is often flicked on
and</b>
<br><b>off. The only uncomfort or fear I experiance with any of these</b>
<br><b>supernatural happenings is at night. Small, glowing spots, about
the</b>
<br><b>size of a child's shoe can be seen almost floating above the floor.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Except at night, I feel absolutely no fear or worry when in
the</b>
<br><b>prescence of this spirit. I feel it has no cruel intention what-so-ever.</b>
<br><b>The only problem is that the happenings cease when anyone but me
is in</b>
<br><b>the room, so no one will believe me. But I know I am not crazy and
I</b>
<br><b>know I am being protected.</b>

<br><b><font size=+2>My childhood home</font></b>
<p><b>By: sdcd@interlog.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>My parents have lived in the same home for around 35 years now, and
there was only one previous owner (who built the house).&nbsp; The only
reason that they moved out was that the house had become too small, and
they needed a larger one.&nbsp; I have several experiences to tell you
about,not scary but it certainly has made me think twice about ghosts.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of my very first memories is of me
when I was a very very young child and a woman with very long black hair
was rocking me in herarms.&nbsp; I don't know if I was dreaming, but to
this day, and I'm 32 years old, the memory of this dream stays with me
vividly.&nbsp; A few yearsago, when my son was born I told my mother about
this pleasant dream and she said that her mother had long black hair.&nbsp;
Her mother died afew weeks before I was born, so I never met her.&nbsp;
I don't know what to make of this, but I'm sure it was just a dream (a
pleasant one at</b>
<br><b>that).</b>
<br><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I always had a reoccurring dream when I was
a child.&nbsp; I don't know at what age they started and at what age they
stopped, but they were always the same.&nbsp; I would either be at the
top of the stairs of the upstairs yelling downstairs or on the main floor
yelling upstairs.&nbsp; In my dream, I would be yelling the ghosts to get
out of the house and to leave us alone.&nbsp; I would always wake up very
frightened.</b>
<br><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was around 8 and my brother was 10,
we were in our living room one day after school watching t.v.&nbsp; Depending
on where you sat in the livingroom, you would have a clear view of the
stairs leading to the bedrooms upstairs.&nbsp; All of a sudden we heard
"thump, thump, thump".&nbsp; It was a noise like someone had just slipped
on the carpeted stairs and was falling down them.&nbsp; We both looked
at each other and said "whojust fell down the stairs".&nbsp; My brother
had a better view of the stairs and he saw a blurry ball coming down the
stairs and a child (which</b>
<br><b>was also blurry) running after it.&nbsp; When the child reached
the bottom of the stairs, it just stopped and disappeared.&nbsp; I never
saw anythingbecause I didn't have the view of the stairs, but to this day
my brother and I still talk about the loud noise and he mentions the vision.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a teenager, I would stay at home on
the weekends while my parents and brother would go to the cottage.&nbsp;
At night when I was in bed in my bedroom.&nbsp; I always had a feeling
of something or someone watching me.&nbsp; I always left my bedroom door
open when I slept alone.&nbsp; While laying in bed, I would always here
noises coming from the mainfloor.&nbsp; This sound is very very hard to
describe.&nbsp; It was like a commotion was going on downstairs, even though
you heard no people walking, talking or dishes clanging.&nbsp; It was just
there.&nbsp; My brother has experienced</b>
<br><b>this as well.</b>
<br><b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got engaged when I was 22 and my fiance used
to stay over on the weekends when my mom and dad and brother would go to
the cottage. When we would go to bed at night, he slept in my bed as it
was only a single bed.&nbsp; It wasn't until much later that he told me
he got a creepy feeling and he would fall asleep facing the wall everytime
he slept over.</b>
<br><b>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My brother was home early from work one day
and was laying on his bed.&nbsp; He was awoken by my voice and I was talking
on my phone in my bedroom.&nbsp; He said he lay there for quite awhile
listening to me talk.&nbsp; When he went downstairs he asked my mother,
"when did I get home"? My mother said that I wasn't home yet.&nbsp; He
was shocked.&nbsp; He told my mom what happened and she didn't believe
him.</b>
<br><b>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was around 7:30 one weekday morning, and
everyone had left for work.&nbsp; I was in my parent's livingroom waiting
for my fiance to pull into the driveway, so we could leave for work together.&nbsp;
I was sitting in the chair, no t.v. or radio was on, I just heard the refridgerator
rattling.&nbsp; Next thing you know, the vibrating had made it's way into
the livingroom and then a loud noise started to come from the middle of
the room.&nbsp; The only way I can describe this noise is as "sucking",
like when the last water from the bathtub is being sucked down the drain.&nbsp;
I got up so fast, ran out the door with my shoes in my hand, just as my
fiance was pulling into the driveway.&nbsp; He is my witness as to seeing
my frightened face.&nbsp; To this day, my parent's house is peaceful.</b>
<br><b>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This happened in my condo just over a year
ago.&nbsp; My husband's grandmother had passed away in England.&nbsp; She
never met our son but had quite a few pictures of him.&nbsp; It saddened
her that she was never able to come over to see her grandchild due to her
health.&nbsp; It was about 5&nbsp; days after she died, that in the middle
of the night, our son was crying very loud and very frightened.&nbsp; He
was not quite 2 1/2 at the time.&nbsp; I ran into his room and he was sitting
up in his bed sobbing, as soon as he saw me he literally jumped into my
arms, and as we were walking out of his room, he kept looking over my shoulder
towards the foot of his bed.&nbsp; The next morning, he told me he saw
a lady in his room and she had touched his cheek.&nbsp; I asked him where
was the lady standing and he pointed to the foot of his bed.&nbsp; To this
day, no one mentions the lady but my son asks if the lady is going to comeback
and I say no.&nbsp; He still remembers.</b>
<br><b>Like I mentioned earlier, these are just some of the small occurrences
that have taken place in my life.&nbsp; I can't explain them, they arejust
odd.</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>Christmas Visit</font></b>
<p><b>By: playtech@sprint.ca</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I haven't had much experiences with ghost. But recently I went away
to families for christmas. The house I stayed in is known to be haunted
by ghost. I am a mother of 3 small children, the first night I stayed there
I had a very sleep less night, my baby kept waking up and crying, I don't
know why but he seemed to be afraid of something. so in order of not waking
up anyone else me and my husband decided to take him downstairs. we fell
asleep on the couch, in the morning my other 2 boys came down and woke
me up. i just want to tell you a bit about this</b>
<br><b>house, when you come into the front door you enter a dark room,
if you go around the corner you find the kicten and a door to the laundry
room, and another door into the livingroom. this is the layout of the main
floor. on the second floor there is 3 bedrooms and a small bathroom.&nbsp;
okay on with my experience, when my children woke me up i said to them
lets go up stairs and get dressed, as i left the livingroom and head to
the stairs&nbsp; my son pointing to the door to the laundryroom said to
me that he seen a girl go into that room. as i looked at the door i</b>
<br><b>was aware that the door was locked. there is no way anyone human
could have gone in there with the door still being locked. i excepted the
fact that my son may have seens something but didn't want to say anything
to him.</b>
<br><b>the next night i was awoken to a flash of light in my room. and
my baby crying again. duriung the days in this house i really didn't notice
anything except for the dog staring at the ceilling and barking, he would
then run around and growel and grab a ball. it felt as if something was
playing with him.&nbsp; a few nights later i took my kids into a doctors
office, when we got home my uncle informed us that the ghost were up stairs
moving around.</b>
<br><b>that night more things happened my husbnad got up to go downstairs
to use the bathroom down there. as he was in the bathroom he seen a shawdo
walk accross the door, at this time he thought it was on of our boys thinking
it was time to get up. as he left the bathroom he went and turned on the
light, there standing in front of him was a small child. one he has never
seen before.&nbsp; as the days went on my children started to see something
in the laundry room it seemed to be playing with them, i couldn't see anything
it was dark in the corner they were pointing at.</b>
<br><b>the night before christmas as i was sleepiong my oldest son woke
me up and said his brother was hitting him in the head, as i looked at
my younger son, i noticed he was sound a sleep i resured my son he was
okay and to go back to sleep, a few hours later i felt something really
hard hit me in the head, the pain was unbarable. i didn't see anything
and new there was no way my kids could hit me that hard.&nbsp; on christmas
morning i decided it was time to go home. so it was aranged that we would
leave the next morning. after the last experience it seemed the ghost had
stop hounding me it was a s if they wanted me to leave.&nbsp; the history
of this house was taken a few years ago, down the road from the house is
a gravel yard. and the people burried there all have lived in or around
the house.</b>
<br><b>there are about 6 ghost around the house, there are 2 little girls
that are out side and it was said that they were killed in the field befind
the house. and a younge man that can be seen from time to time on the roof
had fallen and broke his neck. the others i don't now how they died, but
what i am told the is a lady that walks around the inside of the house
that looks to be from the 1800, and a man that wallks around outside. and
one more but haven't got a clue what he looks like, this one i believe
to be the one that seems to be playing with the dog. he seems to be around
all the time. every couple of hours the dog stares at the ceiling and just
starts to freak out.</b>
<br><b>some other stories i have been told about the house is when my aunt
and uncle first moved in there, they had problems. my uncle seemed to be
the first to see the ghost and feel their power, my uncle and his wife
were fighting really bad at the time, wehn every he would go to the doors,
someone or something would slame the door in his face. there was a time
when he had a few people over, he had his back to the front window and
talking to a friend when his friend seen a plant pot on the window bieng
picked up and was slamed into my uncles back.</b>
<br><b>when the looked at the durt on the floor they seen a foot print
in the sand, and it wasn't a small print but a large one.&nbsp; this is
all i can say about my experiences. there is one more thing i will not
being going back there anytime soon.&nbsp; just one more thing the house
is being torn down in the spring.</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>My friends' haunting experiences</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>BY: MagMug6531@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>When I was twelve my friends and I decided to make a 'fort' in my
basement.</b>
<br><b>The house I grew up in was a split level so the basement also had
a lower and</b>
<br><b>upper level.&nbsp; The lower level was under the kitchen and living
room and had a</b>
<br><b>'ceiling" of only aboout 3 feet tall. You couldn't stand up in it.&nbsp;
The rest</b>
<br><b>of the basement an gargage were about 8 ft. tall.&nbsp; We decided
to make our</b>
<br><b>fort in the lower level.&nbsp; We attached old blankets to the exposed
beams and</b>
<br><b>put carpet remnants on the cement floor.&nbsp; This gave us a place
of our own to</b>
<br><b>play cards, listen to music and talk.</b>
<br><b>One afternoon, when noone else was home, we were in our fort and
heard</b>
<br><b>footsteps and closing doors from upstairs.&nbsp; We figured somebody
came home</b>
<br><b>early, so we went upstairs to investigate.&nbsp; When we got to
the top of the</b>
<br><b>stairs in the kitchen I called "hello, is anybody home?"&nbsp; There
was no</b>
<br><b>answer.&nbsp; My friends and I got so scared we ran out of the house
and went to</b>
<br><b>their house .&nbsp; We never used our 'fort' again.</b>
<br><b>I met my husband while I was in college.&nbsp; I lived in the dormitory
except</b>
<br><b>during school vacations.&nbsp; The first Christmas we were dating,
I spent</b>
<br><b>Christmas eve at his parents and we didn't get back to my house
until late.</b>
<br><b>Since he was spending Christmas Day with my family, he decided to
spend the</b>
<br><b>night.&nbsp; That night passed without incident and we had the best
Christmas</b>
<br><b>ever.&nbsp; We went to a party on New Years Eve and again, didn't
get back to my</b>
<br><b>house until late.&nbsp; He decided to spend the night on the living
room couch</b>
<br><b>again.&nbsp; We said goodnight and I went upstairs to bed.&nbsp;
No sooner did I start</b>
<br><b>to fall asleep, when someone was shaking me awake.&nbsp; I opened
my eyes to see</b>
<br><b>David looking very upset with his eyes as big as dinner platters.</b>
<br><b>"Someone's walking around in the living room", he said</b>
<br><b>I went downstairs and we looked all around the living room, but
noone was</b>
<br><b>there.</b>
<br><b>"It was probably the cat", I said.&nbsp; "Go back to sleep".</b>
<br><b>I went back upstairs.&nbsp; Shortly after, David was shaking me
again.</b>
<br><b>"I'm going home.&nbsp; When I turned the lights, off I can hear
someone walking on</b>
<br><b>the carpet and I can feel someone looking at me.&nbsp; When I turn
the lights on,</b>
<br><b>noone is there."</b>
<br><b>I told him he was probably dreaming it, but he insisted on leaving,</b>
<br><b>explaining to me that he was now wide awake and perfectly capable
of driving</b>
<br><b>home.&nbsp; He never spent another night in that house.</b>
<br><b>Later in the same week, I ran into a friend during registration
at college.</b>
<br><b>She had been living next door to me in the dorm and needed a place
to stay.</b>
<br><b>I offered to put her up until vacation was over.&nbsp; One night,
Dave was over</b>
<br><b>and we were sitting around in the living room.&nbsp; I remembered
that I had to</b>
<br><b>put another log on the fire in the woodstove in the basement.&nbsp;
Dave came</b>
<br><b>downstairs to help me.&nbsp; We had put more wood on the fire and
were poking it</b>
<br><b>when we heard my friend yelling for us to get upstairs.&nbsp; We
ran upstairs to</b>
<br><b>find her standing on a chair in the living room, face as white as
paste,</b>
<br><b>pointing at the floor.</b>
<br><b>"There.&nbsp; It was right there. l saw footprints on the carpet
and they were</b>
<br><b>coming toward me."</b>
<br><b>After calming my friend down, we explained about some of the strange</b>
<br><b>happenings in the house and that noone had ever been hurt.&nbsp;
The rest of her</b>
<br><b>stay passed without incident, however, she would stay up all night
( or</b>
<br><b>pretty nearly) and sleep during the day.</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>My haunting experience</font></b>
<p><b>By: MagMug6531@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>On a summer night when I was eight years old, I awoke to find a woman</b>
<br><b>standing by my bed looking out the window onto the street.&nbsp;
One hand held the</b>
<br><b>curtain back and the light from the street illuminated the form
from the neck</b>
<br><b>down.&nbsp; The face was in the shadows and I couldn't see it (
I wear glasses for</b>
<br><b>myopia).&nbsp; The figure was solid (not transparent at all) and
was wearing a</b>
<br><b>long dress with long sleeves.&nbsp; The fabric had a print of very
small flowers</b>
<br><b>all over on a dark background.&nbsp; At first I thought I was dreaming,
so I</b>
<br><b>closed one eye then opened it.&nbsp; The figure was still there.&nbsp;
I did the same</b>
<br><b>with the other eye and then both eyes, first closing then opening
them.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>figure remained.&nbsp; It didn't move and I didn't speak to it.&nbsp;
I didn't feel</b>
<br><b>threatened or scared in any way.&nbsp; I realized it could be my
mother checking</b>
<br><b>up on me and she might get mad if I spoke because it would mean
that I had</b>
<br><b>been awake.&nbsp; So I went back to sleep.</b>
<br><b>The following morning I went downstairs to breakfast and asked my
mother if</b>
<br><b>she had been in to check on me the night before.&nbsp; She said
no.&nbsp; When my older</b>
<br><b>sister came down, I asked her the same question.&nbsp; She also
said no.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>mother told me I must have been dreaming.&nbsp; I told her about
my "eye trick"</b>
<br><b>and she said I must've dreamt that too.&nbsp; My dad just laughed
and said "it</b>
<br><b>must've been a ghost!".</b>
<br><b>Thirty eight years later, I can remember that event so clearly.&nbsp;
I know I</b>
<br><b>wasn't dreaming.&nbsp; I don't know if it was a "ghost" or maybe
an angel (I'm</b>
<br><b>Catholic) but I do know it was real.&nbsp; No one in my family had
passed away, so</b>
<br><b>if it was a ghost, it belonged to the house, not the family.&nbsp;
That experience</b>
<br><b>sparked an interest in the paranormal for me and I started reading
about the</b>
<br><b>subject.&nbsp; I subsequently had another experience in my teens
and have several</b>
<br><b>friends who also experienced "weird" happenings in that house.</b>
<br><b>My parents sold the house shortly after I got married and another
family</b>
<br><b>lives there now.&nbsp; I've often wondered if they have had paranormal</b>
<br><b>experiences.&nbsp; I guess I'll never know.&nbsp; Thanks for listening.</b>

<br><b>being in a haunted house and your sense tells you that you're not
the only</b>
<br><b>one there!!!</b>
<p><b>The house that I lived in previously is said to have a ghostly occupant</b>
<br><b>which is a girl. I have no idea of who she was and why she was still
roaming</b>
<br><b>the place of the living. She usually resided in the only bathroom
in the</b>
<br><b>house. A few time when I was taking a shower I could feel her there.
It was</b>
<br><b>an indescribable feeling. I usually talked with her in my thoughts
and asked</b>
<br><b>her politely to just leave me - it wasn't nice to have a living
stranger</b>
<br><b>watching you while you were taking a shower, especially a dead one.
She</b>
<br><b>would just leave then as I couldn't feel her anymore.</b>
<br><b>As I mentioned previously that my brother could actually see them.
It</b>
<br><b>started when he was a little boy, especially when he was sick..
I remember</b>
<br><b>that he used to scare the hell out of me and how I tried to avoid
being</b>
<br><b>around him when he was sick. He said that even now he still could
see them</b>
<br><b>but only when he is really sick. He still lives with my Mom and
once when he</b>
<br><b>was really sick, he was awoken at the early hour of the morning
and heard</b>
<br><b>our dogs howling at something. Firstly, you have to know that Mom's
house</b>
<br><b>located in the part of a real estate that still has vacant parcels
full of</b>
<br><b>big trees and long grass. Okay, to continue with the story, he said
that</b>
<br><b>when he was awoken, he saw some transparent people just walked over
Mom's</b>
<br><b>front yard and one of the dogs was after those people. These 'people'
used</b>
<br><b>to go back and forth through Mom's front yard during certain times
for God</b>
<br><b>only knows what purpose. We still don't now who these dudes were
and why</b>
<br><b>they do what they've been doing. And, no, they never bother any
of us in the</b>
<br><b>house so we just accept them...</b>
<br><b>As for me, once I was invited to a friend's new house. She rented
it from</b>
<br><b>someone and didn't mention about the spirits that live in the house
to me.</b>
<br><b>Eventually I heard it from another friend but it was too late, I
guess.</b>
<br><b>Being a chicken, I tried to avoid those scary places. Anyway, I
went there</b>
<br><b>with a few more friends and the moment I stepped into the house,
I could</b>
<br><b>feel that there was something wrong in it. Again, there came the</b>
<br><b>indescribable feeling. The friend who rented the house insisted
me to stay</b>
<br><b>over and I said, well, okay. But, the older the night grew, the
more intense</b>
<br><b>the feeling and at exactly midnight time, the light went off. We
were</b>
<br><b>playing cards in one the rooms upstairs when it happened. So, the
only guy</b>
<br><b>in the group went downstairs to flick up the electricity control
panel (or</b>
<br><b>whatever it is) and went back up. Not long after, the light went
off again</b>
<br><b>and this time when he went downstairs, we, the girls, heard beeping
noises</b>
<br><b>from the computer room. We didn't hear it the first time the light
went off.</b>
<br><b>So, we just tried to be brave and went into the computer room. We
saw that</b>
<br><b>the computer and the printers and everything weren't&nbsp; even
turned on. To us,</b>
<br><b>it just didn't make sense. So, we unplugged the whole things and
went out.</b>
<br><b>The worst time that made me running out of the house was when the
guy (he</b>
<br><b>was my fianc&eacute;) started acting strange. He is usually quite
and reserved but</b>
<br><b>at that time he wasn't the one that I knew. Being so close to him
and we've</b>
<br><b>been living together and never separated from the first time we
met, I just</b>
<br><b>knew when something went wrong with him Later he told me that he
felt so</b>
<br><b>familiar with the house for no reasons. So, at about one thirty
in the</b>
<br><b>morning I just dragged him out of bed and went back home. I really
don't</b>
<br><b>want to know what would happen if we stayed there until morning
- the</b>
<br><b>feeling that I had told me that there was something bad going on
and it</b>
<br><b>might harm us, or at least him.</b>
<br><b>Other thing that unrelated to the story but I need the advice in,</b>
<br><b>nevertheless, is this : My Dad used to say that I have inherited
the ability</b>
<br><b>to say something to somebody that will come true at the end without
my</b>
<br><b>knowledge, if you know what I mean. I would just say things to somebody
and</b>
<br><b>tada....&nbsp; It happened twice that I can remember. I told Dad
that I don't</b>
<br><b>want this ability - I mean what good would it do to you if you just
say to a</b>
<br><b>friend that something bad will happen to him/her and it happens
? But, he</b>
<br><b>said I'd better keep it since it's a sort of legacy and it looks
I am the</b>
<br><b>only one in my generation who has it. Could you explain to me why
is that</b>
<br><b>and what is it actually ? Any comments are most welcomed. E-mail
me to</b>
<br><b>adenanang@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b>I have some more stories but for the time being I think that'd be
all and</b>
<br><b>thanks for listening.</b>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was 9 years old I served as an alter boy
for my church. The year</b>
<br><b>was 1980 and I was going on a trip to see my father for the first
time.</b>
<br><b>Before I left on this trip my priest gave me a hand shake and thanked
me for</b>
<br><b>helping serve the church. In that hand shake was a twenty dallar
bill and a</b>
<br><b>bone crushing grip. Father Smith had throat cancer and had part
of his voice</b>
<br><b>box removed, he was a kind man who always took time to talk to familys
after</b>
<br><b>service. Three weeks later I returned from my trip, only to discover
Father</b>
<br><b>Smith had died of a heart attack. That was the last time I ever
saw him.</b>
<br><b>Several years passed by, and I was spending the night at a friends
house, we</b>
<br><b>were sitting down stairs in the basement talking about girls. In</b>
<br><b>mid-discussion my friend stoped talking, his face suddenly became
pale and he</b>
<br><b>had this deadpan look on his face. I asked him what was wrong, he
said I just</b>
<br><b>saw a priest walk past behind you. Behind me was a coridoor that
led to the</b>
<br><b>stairs. My friend never knew I served as an alter boy, I never discussed
how</b>
<br><b>upset I had been that I could'nt have served at my priest's funeral,
or that</b>
<br><b>I even Knew a priest. My friend was'nt one to make things up.</b>
<br><b>One last thing, inbetween those several years there had been two
instances</b>
<br><b>some one or something sat on my bed in the middle of the night,
but nobody</b>
<br><b>was there. These are things that i will never forget. And perhaps
the oddest</b>
<br><b>thing that's ever happened to me. When I was seven, the last thing
I can</b>
<br><b>remember saying to my baby sitter was "What's it like to die?"&nbsp;
One week</b>
<br><b>later she was hit and runover by a drunk driver. I have no idea
why i asked</b>
<br><b>her that. I don't make things up to entertain people or for any
other reason.</b>
<br><b>These are just a few strange things that have happened in my life.</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>My Story...</font></b>
<p><b>By: Ucberk599@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I'm not sure what exactly this experience is, but i'll tell it anyway
just</b>
<br><b>for people out there to let me know what their opinion is.</b>
<p><b>This experience occurred during my high school years.&nbsp; One morning,
I woke up</b>
<br><b>without an alarm at about 6 am.&nbsp; I didn't open my eyes because
I sensed</b>
<br><b>someone standing next to my bed.&nbsp; I can't explain it because
I never had this</b>
<br><b>feeling before.&nbsp; So the first thing I knew not to do was to
open my eyes</b>
<br><b>because I didn't want to see a face, a figure, or something that
would scare</b>
<br><b>me to death.&nbsp; After a couple of seconds, the next thing I felt
was every</b>
<br><b>muscle in my body tightening up.&nbsp; It was excruciating pain.&nbsp;
I still didn't</b>
<br><b>want to open my eyes because I rather live life not knowing the
unknown than</b>
<br><b>live life in fear.&nbsp; Eventually, the pain stopped and I was
in a relaxed</b>
<br><b>state.&nbsp; I carefully opened my eyes and nothing was there.&nbsp;
(Thank goodness!)</b>
<br><b>Ever since then, I question if that was a spirit, a ghost, a guardian
angel.</b>
<br><b>What do you think?</b>
