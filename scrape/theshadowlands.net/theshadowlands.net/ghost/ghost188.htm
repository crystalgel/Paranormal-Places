<br><b>My Ghost"Nellie Ellen"</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ptlevin@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am going yo tell you about a ghost that I am pretty sure is haunting</b>
<br><b>me.Her name is Nellie Ellen.I have never actually seen Nellie Ellen
but</b>
<br><b>I can really feel her presence.It started when I was about five
years</b>
<br><b>old. I had one of my friends over and we were sleeping in a tent
under</b>
<br><b>the sky lights.My friend woke up at about 2 in the morning and said
she</b>
<br><b>wanted to gto home.She was sweating prefusely and was very pale.I
got</b>
<br><b>scared and I asked what was the matter.She didn't want to tell me
but I</b>
<br><b>finally dragged it out of her. She said that she had seen an old
lady</b>
<br><b>looking at us through the top of the tent through the skylights
and she</b>
<br><b>was bloody holding a broken tea cup.we ran to my mom and slept in
her</b>
<br><b>bedroom that night.I never saw her though but my friend really scared</b>
<br><b>me.Over the next five years only small stuff happened;footsteps
down the</b>
<br><b>hall,knocking,etc.When I was ten I had one of my very good friends</b>
<br><b>over.She woke me up around 2 (like my other friend had) and she
was</b>
<br><b>crying.The room was dark so I turned on the lights.My friend had
a</b>
<br><b>bloody nose and was crying really hard now.I asked what had happened
and</b>
<br><b>she insisted that she got them all the time and we called her mother.Her</b>
<br><b>mother came and we were talking about how my friend was really upset.I</b>
<br><b>said that she told me that she got nosebleeds all the time.Her mother</b>
<br><b>said that it was odd that she lied because she never got nosebleeds.When</b>
<br><b>I went to&nbsp; school I asked her what really happened and she
said "Nellie</b>
<br><b>Ellen" and we've never been friends since.Years later odd things
began</b>
<br><b>to happen again.I was up late watching tv and I heard knocking coming</b>
<br><b>from my window.Nothing was there though (that I could see anyway).The</b>
<br><b>nexy day I did some research on my house.I found out that there
used to</b>
<br><b>be a woman named NellieEllen who owned a tea shop in the bottom
of the</b>
<br><b>house.I asked a neighbor about her.My neighbor said that she used
t o be</b>
<br><b>friends with NellieEllen until she went crazy.I was informed that
Nellie</b>
<br><b>Ellen would sit on the roof in the late hours of the night with
her</b>
<br><b>teacups and talk to herself.One night though NellieEllen accidentally</b>
<br><b>locked herself out of her house and was stuck on the roof in the</b>
<br><b>blistering cold.She tried to get in but she couldn't so she had
to break</b>
<br><b>a window to get in.But some of the window hit her and she&nbsp;
was so weak</b>
<br><b>from breaking the window and the cold she was left to die on the
roof</b>
<br><b>with the things she loved most;her teacups.A few weeks had gone
by and</b>
<br><b>nothing had happened but one day my dogs got up and started barking
at</b>
<br><b>nothing.(They are very protective).They usually can't get up the
stairs</b>
<br><b>but somehow the managed to and started barking at the roofI was
sure it</b>
<br><b>was NellieEllen.I asked her what she wanted and the dogs stopped</b>
<br><b>barking.They just stared at the window in the attic.She didn't say</b>
<br><b>anything so I told her to leave me alone and never come back.Then
I</b>
<br><b>heard a faint voice say warm.I said"what" and i heard it again and
it</b>
<br><b>said "blanket"Then I said,"if I give&nbsp; you a blanket will you
promise to</b>
<br><b>leave me alone.It said "yes" so I grabbed a blanket that the dogs
used</b>
<br><b>to sleep on and shoved it out the window.I heard a faint"thank you"
and</b>
<br><b>I haven't had any more encounters with NellieEllen but once in a
while I</b>
<br><b>hear footsteps on the roof but I don't worry anymore because she
is in</b>
<br><b>her favorite spot with what she needed to go to rest with in peace.</b>

<p><b>Not Much Different</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Kadleo@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My Experience with a ghost isn't much different than many other people
have</b>
<br><b>sent in.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had just moved into my house about 1 year
before I noticed wierd</b>
<br><b>things happening. On night I was home alone and was just watching
TV. I</b>
<br><b>didn't really like being home by myself much because I wasn't to
sure if I</b>
<br><b>was really alone. I have always kind of been into the spirits and
ghost and</b>
<br><b>your website. I recalled sitting on my couch watching TV when i
heard a wierd</b>
<br><b>noise upsatirs. I knew it was a ghost or something because I was
alone in</b>
<br><b>the house. I listened quietly more when I heard footsteps coming
down the</b>
<br><b>stairs. I couldn't make out a vision or anything, but could here
somebody</b>
<br><b>walking around. I than looked over to where my stove is and saw
a quick</b>
<br><b>glance of a white shadow. After that I turned my TV up really loud
and went</b>
<br><b>into my parents bedroom. They have a sliding door so when i was
watching TV</b>
<br><b>in there I could here someone trying to open the door but every
time I looked</b>
<br><b>nobody was there.It was definetly a creepy experience.</b>
<br><b>Another time I was painting my room and I was standing in front
of my bedroom</b>
<br><b>door on a step ladder. The door was open and I was stretching up
to reach the</b>
<br><b>top of the wall. When something brushed past me down the hall. It
scared me</b>
<br><b>so bad that I fell off the step ladder. I looked and called out,
but nobody</b>
<br><b>was there. During that time I also saw it walk by and noticed that
the papers</b>
<br><b>on my wall were moving like a gust of cold air had moved through
my room. It</b>
<br><b>than grew very cold in my room and I began to shiver. Those are
my ghost</b>
<br><b>stories.</b>

<p><b>Mainard on Elm Street</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: loi@terraworld.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>The yellow house on Elm Street in&nbsp; Kansas was home to a</b>
<br><b>restless spirit that had died from illness in the bedroom upstairs.
I,</b>
<br><b>as a young girl in high school chose his room as my own.&nbsp; It
was soon</b>
<br><b>after moving in that I heard scuffing noises as if he was walking
around</b>
<br><b>wondering what i was doing there. one night i in fact awoke to find
him</b>
<br><b>lying next to me. it was like millions of grey dots forming a human</b>
<br><b>shape. at the time, i thought it was my imagination and blew it
off.</b>
<br><b>then he became more active. i could hear a slamming of the back
door and</b>
<br><b>someone running up the stairs and then you could not hear anything
else</b>
<br><b>after a big stomp at the top of the stairs. One night in particular
i</b>
<br><b>heard a stomp outside my bedroom and then a scuffing of someone
walking</b>
<br><b>slowly. it came to the right side of my bed and stopped, then to
the</b>
<br><b>left side and stopped. Then it went to the end of my bed and stopped,
at</b>
<br><b>the same time my heavy brocade curtain flew out over my bed straight
as</b>
<br><b>an arrow. needless to say i was scared out of my wits. i knew i
had to</b>
<br><b>do some research and find out what needed to be done to lead him
to the</b>
<br><b>other side. i went to the library and read up on everything i could.
i</b>
<br><b>asked around town and found out his name and that he had died in
my</b>
<br><b>room. i then decided to talk to him. i said, "mainard, you need
to go on</b>
<br><b>to the other side now, your work here is done." I cannot remember
how</b>
<br><b>much time lasped but one night i heard another thump in the hall
outside</b>
<br><b>my room, but this time an elderly lady was leading an elderly man
from</b>
<br><b>the hall into my closet. I watched them without any fear at all.
It was</b>
<br><b>such a peaceful thing to witness. someone came to lead mainard home.</b>
<br><b>I am now 47 and still remember this so well. My father lives in
the same</b>
<br><b>house and i do not feel any presence there now.</b>
<br><b>i will add a p.s.</b>
<br><b>when i first moved there a mans wedding ring fell from the top of
a door</b>
<br><b>and rolled across the floor to me. at the time i was a "romantic"
and</b>
<br><b>said, "i will marry the man who fits this ring" i still have the
ring,</b>
<br><b>and since it is so large no man has ever been able to wear it.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Haunting in 1984</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Fw1021@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Several years ago, sometime in 1984 , I was living in a small
town outside</b>
<br><b>of Ft Worth, TX. By the name of Crowley. At the time I was in my
early</b>
<br><b>twenties and had a roommate, his name was Mike. Anyway, one night
Mike and I</b>
<br><b>were sitting around watching TV and having a couple of beers. As
it got late</b>
<br><b>and we were getting tired the strangest thing happened. In the bathroom
in</b>
<br><b>the hallway just a few feet away we heard what sounded like the
toilet</b>
<br><b>flushing. Mike looked at me kind of surprised and asked me if I
heard it too,</b>
<br><b>I kind of laughed and said no. I guess curiosity got the better
of me and I</b>
<br><b>went in the bathroom to look. As I switched the light on, I felt
my hair</b>
<br><b>stand up, the water in the toilet was still going around. Since
we lived in a</b>
<br><b>trailer house we both just blew it off as poor construction. We
continued to</b>
<br><b>sit and have a few more beers when Mike looked at me and said "do
you smell</b>
<br><b>that." I sniffed a little an! d said it smelled like gas, since
the stove in</b>
<br><b>the kitchen directly behind us was the only gas in the house I immediately</b>
<br><b>stood and turned to look. What I saw absolutely scared the hell
out of me.</b>
<br><b>All four burners on the stove were on. I finally got up the nerve
to turn</b>
<br><b>them off and we had no more problems that night. But thats not the
end of the</b>
<br><b>story. Several days later Mike called me at work, it was around
11:00pm, he</b>
<br><b>asked me if I could come home right now. I could hear the fear in
his voice</b>
<br><b>and asked him what was wrong. He said he was lying on the couch
when he heard</b>
<br><b>what sounded like kitchen cabinets being slammed closed and he was
very</b>
<br><b>scared. I went home as quickly as possible and found Mike outside
waiting,</b>
<br><b>afraid to go into the house. We quietly went inside and found nothing
out of</b>
<br><b>the ordinary.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I know that this sounds very strange and would be easy to
make up. The few</b>
<br><b>people I have told this to just don't believe it. But I was there
and it did</b>
<br><b>happen. The only problem is that for all these years I have wondered
what</b>
<br><b>happened. Was it something paranormal or just ordinary things that
go bump in</b>
<br><b>the night.</b>

<p><b>Haunted House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>Last winter in Febuary 2000 I was ask to stay with my daughter while
her husband as well as mine was out on the road as they&nbsp; are both
truck drivers that are gone Mon thru Fri. Let me start by saying that the
reason that I was ask to stay (along with another family friend) was that
she and my granddaughter was experiencing some strange things. I arrived
on a Sunday evening about dusk and about 9:00 PM we started to smell very
strong, very sweet cologne and the house had gotten real chilly especially
in the living room area and absolutely fridgid in my granddaughters bedroom.,
we turned up the temp. control to about 85 degrees and the furnace ran
constantly but the house continued to get colder during the night and a
thermometer said it was only 31 degrees by 4:00 AM. By morning things had
warmed up and thinking it must have been a furnace problem we put it off
by having the landlord check the furnace. That night everything was on
the up and up until the following morning when the upstairs apartment which
was empty for the day had awful noises coming from it. It sounded like
heavy furniture being moved, things being dropped on the floor and arguing
(loud) was going on.My daughter checked to see for sure that was no one
at home. Later my other daughter came home who lived in the upstairs apt.
and upon entering the house found a huge blood clot on her livingroom floor.That
same night some other incidents started to happen that almost drove us
to the point of insanity for the rest of the week. The livingroom floors
would shake so hard that the sofa's would move across the floor , my granddaughters
TV and video game would come on and play by themselves writing would appear
on the mirrors saying things we did not understand (looked like scribblings
of a young child) and 2 incidents where I could physically see that something
was biting my granddaughter and I tried to get it off of her but that is
hard to do when you can't see what your struggling with.By the end of the
week I physically moved my family in with me until they was able to find
another residence.I had forgotten to tell you that during this week 3 different
priests blessed the house and one ran from the house after going through
my granddaughters bedroom door. The experiences I will never forget even
thought I have always been a believer. This is something serious and nothing
to play with. To this day my granddaughter still has imprints in her chest
and upper leg from the biting incident and terrible nightmares.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Green Lady Cemetary (Burlington, Ct)</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Redwaterr@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My freinds and I have been going to the Green Lady Cemetary for quite
some</b>
<br><b>time now, and nothing bizzare ever happened, until just recently,&nbsp;
two</b>
<br><b>carloads of us took a trip down there on October 30, 2000.&nbsp;
As soon as we</b>
<br><b>pulled in, the radio in my Dad's car stopped working, and my cell
phone</b>
<br><b>stopped working, so we decided to ignore it, and shrug it off as
a</b>
<br><b>coincedence.&nbsp; There were 9 of us there, and 5 people(not including
myself),</b>
<br><b>and the dog decided to take off in the woods behind the cemetary.&nbsp;
Now, the</b>
<br><b>cemetary is on the right side of the road(from the direction we
drove in),</b>
<br><b>and we watched them disapear into the woods, but we started to get
worried</b>
<br><b>when we could'nt hear them anymore.&nbsp; So we shined the flashlights
into the</b>
<br><b>woods, and started calling their names.&nbsp; We started to hear
footsteps coming</b>
<br><b>from the left side of the road(also woods), and the 4 of us that
were left</b>
<br><b>behind started to get nervous.&nbsp; We shut the flashlights off,
and remained</b>
<br><b>really quiet, trying to figure out what was going to pop out of
the woods at</b>
<br><b>us...it turned out to be the five weirdos that started off on the
right side</b>
<br><b>of the street.&nbsp; They somehow ended up on the left side, and

<br><b>Great Yarmouth Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MJones1570@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi,here is an account of something I saw on Great Yarmouth beach
on August</b>
<br><b>Bank Holiday</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;1989:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was on a scooter rally,to
Gorleston-on-sea,Aug Bank Hol 1989,when</b>
<br><b>my friends and I arrived there(on our scooters),we could not find
any</b>
<br><b>accomodation,so went into Great Yarmouth,to try our luck there.As
it was just</b>
<br><b>down the road.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No luck there either,so we decided to sleep
on the promenade shelters</b>
<br><b>about 10ft from the&nbsp; actual beach itself,the prom is concrete,and
we were</b>
<br><b>pretty close to the pier,about 100 yards give or take a few.That
is an</b>
<br><b>important part of the story!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friends had gone around the town to
the pubs etc,and my girlfriend</b>
<br><b>and I were in this shelter,and were settling down in deck chairs
after</b>
<br><b>building a wind break with the remaining deck chairs.As the night
was pretty</b>
<br><b>rough.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked out over the beach and saw
what looked to me like a luminous</b>
<br><b>white flag blowing in the wind,it looked like a woman in a long
flowing dress</b>
<br><b>and wide brimmed hat,1900s or earlier type. I thought it was the
surf from</b>
<br><b>the sea at first,but the surf was beyond this shape,as the "figure"
was too</b>
<br><b>far inland to be surf,about 50 yards away from&nbsp; where I was.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I then thought it might be a warning flag
of some sort,so I didnt think</b>
<br><b>any more of it,after watching it for some time,it just stayed there,so
I</b>
<br><b>settled down to get some sleep and thought no more of it. All this
time I</b>
<br><b>never mentioned it to my girlfriend whom I thoght was asleep.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said I thought no more of it until a few
months later,when I saw in</b>
<br><b>a book about unsolved murders etc.,an article about a woman who
was murdered</b>
<br><b>on the beach near Great Yarmouth pier in 1900!!!!! A shiver still
goes down</b>
<br><b>my spine even now,as I write this,she was strangled with her boot
laces,and</b>
<br><b>her clothes were a long dress and a wide brimmed hat!!!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The story does not end there,they caught
the "killer" and hanged him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; But,in 1910 another woman was found in the same place,murdered
in the same</b>
<br><b>way! so did they get the right man in the first place????</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The identities of the first victim and
her killer are established and</b>
<br><b>they were seen arguing the night before etc., even their house still</b>
<br><b>stands,and the boarding house where they stayed in Great Yarmouth,I
know this</b>
<br><b>as there was a T.V. programme investigatin mysterious deaths and
this was</b>
<br><b>featured! But hardly anything is known of the second victim to my
knowledge.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; So,the thought in my mind is if the "ghost" I saw is
the first or second</b>
<br><b>victim??</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen other apparitions too,but this
one had the most profound</b>
<br><b>effect on me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will tell
you about the others some other time if you like.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope I havent bored you too much,but there you have

<br><b>Restaurant Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: philmb2@iland.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is not as complex or as insteresting as other stories, but very
real nonetheless. I was working as a janitor in a restraunt in the Sacramento,
CA area in the mid 1980s. During this time I had bought some books on ghosts
and hauntings, to include one book called "Poltergeist" which gave detailed
accounts of numerous poltergeist cases. It was&nbsp; this book that I had
left laying about the house and that one of my older brothers noticed.
He pulled me aside to warn me that I should be&nbsp; careful with what
I was messing around with because, in his words, "messing around with this
is like knocking on the gates to Hell!" I light of the fact that he had
experienced (ironically while also working as a janitor) a very disturbing
encounter of his own, I took this warning seriously. So one night at work,
shortly after my brother's words had gotten the best of me and I had put
the books aside, I was busy cleaning the dinning room carpet. The place
was closed and the only ones in the building were two other janitors and
myself. Picture a Denney's-like place, with the cook's line adjacent to
the dinning room, a larger kitchen in back, and an upstairs with a storage
room, an office, and employee restrooms. I Had coompleted about two thirds
of the carpet, utilizing a big, rotary-style idustrial butter. It was 4:00
AM and I had parked the buffer and the cleaning items with it in the middle
of the "no smoking" area, away from any tables. I turned and headed for
the cook's line, where one of my coworkers was busy cleaning. We exchanged
words, commenting that it was time to&nbsp; take a break and make something
to eat. He was looking at me as I approached the sandwhich side of the
cook's line. Then, about fifteen seconds after I had left the buffer, there
came the loudest,&nbsp; bangs that I have ever heard indoors. Three heavy
"raps", BANG - BANG - BANG! It sounded exactly like a giant fist had pounded
down on one of the dinning room tables. It had hit the&nbsp; table so hard
that I could hear the silverware rattle! The hair on the back of my neck
stood up. I spun immediately around as the sounds came ffrom where I just
left, the buffer and the no-smoking area. I saw noting, and spun back around
to my coworker. "What was THAT?" I asked. "I don't know," was his answer.
I thought that strange since he was looking in the exact direction of the
noise. To this day he maintaiins that he s aw nothing. I immediately went
over to see if the buffer had gone off on its own and banged into one of
the tables. To my amazement, the buffer was as I left it! I expected to
see one of the tables (these are your heavy, wooden tables) tipped on its
side. All the tables in the section were okay. No silverware was disturbed.
We immediately searched the building, armed with knives and cooking utinsiles,
for the illusive visitor. Noone was to be found. We tried , but could not
even come close, to duplicating what the two of us agreed was a banging
on one of the tables. We could barely get the silverware to rattle. This
was way beyond what any person could accomplish, and get away with without
either of us seeing him. I would say that if we took one of those tables
and dropped it from the roof onto the parking lot, it still would not be
loud enough! Sorry, but I cannot say that I smelt something, saw shadows
or heard voices. I ditched the books after that, all except for one called
"Poltergeist."</b><b></b>

<br><b>Different Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MystykAquaMoon@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I live in Hawaii and their are many different types of ghost here.&nbsp;
We even</b>
<br><b>have our own tour of the most haunted places on the Island where
I live</b>
<br><b>(Oahu).&nbsp; Every year my family camps down at the beach for Labor
Day Weekend.</b>
<br><b>In 1992 my boyfriend and a close friend of my cousins joined us
for the</b>
<br><b>weekend.</b>
<br><b>The place we camped had a lot of ghost stories.&nbsp; The beach
and all around it</b>
<br><b>was said to be haunted.&nbsp; It did not help when that year a person
was found</b>
<br><b>murdered only a short distance from where we were camping.&nbsp;
My boyfriend and</b>
<br><b>our close friend had to work and were coming down to the camp site
one night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My cousins and I were on the beach relaxing, waiting for them
to return.</b>
<br><b>When they got back we made a fire and sat around talking.&nbsp;
All of a sudden we</b>
<br><b>got on to the subject of ghost and my boyfriend started to tell
us of what</b>
<br><b>him and Robbie saw while they were coming back.&nbsp; Robbie did
not want to admit</b>
<br><b>to what he saw and while they were arguing my cousin who was sitting
behind</b>
<br><b>us stared to freak out.&nbsp; All of us thinking that something
horrible had</b>
<br><b>happened turned all of our attention to her.&nbsp; She said that
she saw a guy</b>
<br><b>floating on the water and he had told her that she should be very
afraid.</b>
<br><b>After we had calmed her down my two cousins and I had to go to the
bathroom.</b>
<br><b>Upon returning from the bathroom we were all talking and did not
notice our</b>
<br><b>shadows. I was in the middle of my two cousins.&nbsp; Our shadows
had a slight</b>
<br><b>outline because our backs were facing the light.&nbsp; My one cousin
stopped all</b>
<br><b>of a sudden and we looked down at our shadows.&nbsp; Next to my
cousin stood a</b>
<br><b>shadow of a man.&nbsp; The shadow was lighter than ours and did
not have an</b>
<br><b>outline.&nbsp; Nobody was by the bathrooms except for us.&nbsp;
I tried not to panic</b>
<br><b>but both of my cousins ran and left me there for a brief second
by myself and</b>
<br><b>then I started to run.&nbsp; All of us grabbing on to the one in
front.&nbsp; We did</b>
<br><b>not stop until we met up with the guys and told them what happened.</b>
<br><b>That same ghost haunted us for about one year.&nbsp; Sometimes still
to this day</b>
<br><b>he will come back on the same night when we first met him.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Who Knew?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: foxy@lni.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I first meant my husband in August 15th, 1992 and he brought
me to his house and I walked in the house for the very first time,&nbsp;
I said to him.... you have a ghost here.&nbsp; (We had meant only hours
before).</b>
<br><b>He looked at me in disbelief.&nbsp; And ask me how I knew that?</b>
<br><b>I told him I could feel the ghost here.&nbsp; And the ghost was
from the civil war.&nbsp;&nbsp; As time went on, we heard noises, and things
moved around, and lids from paint cans would pop.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a lot
of little strange things went on over the years.&nbsp; I told my husband
that he had nothing to fear but fear it self.&nbsp; I knew the ghost would
not hurt us.</b>
<br><b>But I still don't know what it wanted.&nbsp; We have chosen to ignore
it now.&nbsp; and we don't get disturbed to often now.&nbsp; I know the
ghost just wanted our attention for some reason, but I wasn't quit sure
how to communicate with him.</b>
<br><b>I feel bad about not knowing what to do, because our ghost seem
to be in some emotional pain for some reason.</b>
<br><b>I think there was a battle on these grounds and our ghost died here.&nbsp;
I have not done any research on the subject as of yet.&nbsp; I'm sure our
library will have some help.</b>
<br><b>I have went into a lot of houses that had ghost in them and for
some unknown reason I always know the second I walk into a&nbsp; house.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It seems to be in the air.&nbsp; The air will feel real heavy to me.&nbsp;
I've been right 99% of the time.</b>
<br><b>But, I just do not know how to communicate with them.&nbsp; I was
told once that if you ask a ghost what they want and they tell you,&nbsp;
better do just what they want or you will be in big trouble with them.&nbsp;
Is this true?</b>
<br><b>My story is done now.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Freddy Kruger lives here</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: john_aud@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in 1985 my family moved to a large
house on Whibey Is Wa.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>17 when we moved into this place and from day one it gave me the
creeps.</b>
<br><b>The constant feeling of being watched was unnerving.&nbsp; With
in the first two</b>
<br><b>weeks of moving in, I had my first real experiance.&nbsp; We had
finally gotten</b>
<br><b>our furniture and was thrilled to get my bedroom unpacked.&nbsp;
That night, I</b>
<br><b>lay in my bed.&nbsp; Very smug in my cosy room.&nbsp; The house
was dark and my two</b>
<br><b>younger brothers, little sister and parents were asleep.&nbsp; I
began to feel</b>
<br><b>very cold and nervous.&nbsp; I lay there, wondering why I was feeling
so odd.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly there was this horrible screamming comming from the hall
way.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>jumped out of my bed, grabbed my baseball bat and ran out of my
room.&nbsp; I ran</b>
<br><b>down the hallway towards my little brother's room, convinced that
someone</b>
<br><b>had broken in and was attacking them.&nbsp; I ran in their room
to find them</b>
<br><b>sound asleep and safe.&nbsp; I checked my sister's room and my parents.&nbsp;
All were</b>
<br><b>sleeping and fine.&nbsp; I went back to bed thinking I must have
imagined it.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>happened again three more times.&nbsp; Finally, I woke my Dad and
told him what</b>
<br><b>was happening.&nbsp; He thought I was nuts.&nbsp; Nothing else happened
that night.</b>
<br><b>Of course...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some time later that year, I began to hear
"scatching" sounds. The</b>
<br><b>sounds mostly came from outside my bedroom windows.&nbsp; It sounded
like someone</b>
<br><b>was taking a rake and running it along the siding right under my
windows.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>had three windows in my room.&nbsp; One faced the south, and two
faced the west.</b>
<br><b>My bestfriend and I would stand infront of my windows, looking down,
trying</b>
<br><b>to figure out who or what was causing this sound.&nbsp; We could
actually hear it</b>
<br><b>move from one side of the house to the other, but could see nothing.&nbsp;
When</b>
<br><b>this sound would happen, I would say, ":it's just Freddy Kruger."&nbsp;
( From</b>
<br><b>Nightmare on Elm street...)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other interesting things would happen,
not so scary but weird all the</b>
<br><b>same.&nbsp; In the wee hours of the morning, say around two or three,
you could</b>
<br><b>hear the kitchen cabnets opening and shutting.&nbsp; As if someone
was looking</b>
<br><b>for a glass.&nbsp; When you'd near the kitchen, the sound would
stop.&nbsp; I've hear</b>
<br><b>this along with my bestfriend, her boyfriend and my siblings.&nbsp;
When I would</b>
<br><b>be standing in the front yard&nbsp; with my friends, you could see
the livingroom</b>
<br><b>curtins open slightly as if someone was peeking out.&nbsp; This
would happen even</b>
<br><b>when none of my other family members were home so I know it wasn't
them</b>
<br><b>spying on me.&nbsp; My friends would point it out to me. "who's
watching us?"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a spare bedroom in the furnished
basement that would cause a</b>
<br><b>strange sensation.&nbsp; You would stand in it and become disoriented.&nbsp;
You</b>
<br><b>couldn't figure out what wall was west, south, east or north.&nbsp;
YOu know how</b>
<br><b>you can stand say, in your livingroom and say," this wall is east
and behind</b>
<br><b>it is the kitchen...."? In this room couldn't pin point any landmarks
behind</b>
<br><b>the walls and you would become dizzy.&nbsp; I had a friend ( he
was in the Army</b>
<br><b>and very "mocho") stay in that room one night because he didn't
believe me.</b>
<br><b>In the middle of the night he left, he said it freaked him out.&nbsp;
To this day</b>
<br><b>we still talk about it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Items would disappear and reappear somewhere
odd.&nbsp; Music from a music</b>
<br><b>box could be heard in the afternoons ,when I came home from school
and I was</b>
<br><b>the only one home.&nbsp; The kicker was....we didn't have any music
box!!!&nbsp; You</b>
<br><b>could hear someone walking up and down the stairs.&nbsp; Only when
I was home</b>
<br><b>alone.&nbsp; Nice, huh? When I would talk to my parents about it,
they refused to</b>
<br><b>say anything other than, "don't say anything to your brothers or
sister!!"</b>
<br><b>I spoke to my youngest brother six months ago ( he's now 20) and
he informed</b>
<br><b>me that he was aware of the haunting and had many a scary story
of his own.</b>
<br><b>The same with my other brother and sister.&nbsp; Although it had
been over 11</b>
<br><b>years sense we moved out, we still think about this house and I
wonder if</b>
<br><b>the current owners are having a problem with "Freddy".</b><b></b>

<p><b>Evil House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ambrebamba@optusnet.com.au</b><b></b>
<p><b>In 1992 I was living in an old old house opposite a cemetary, in
Frankston Victoria, Strange occurances began to happen almost innediatley
after my father, my little brother, me my boyfriend and my three month
old baby moved in there.</b>
<br><b>First little things, like certain items would not be where I had
left them, at first I blamed the others in the house for moving my things,
but they insisted they had never touched them.</b>
<br><b>I would wake up in the middle of the night to find my baby was saturated
and so was his cot, but his nappy was dry. Also a baby crying, when mine
was not there. I put these little incidents away thinking if I told anyone
they would think I was crazy.</b>
<br><b>One day all of us were sitting in the kitchen, having a coffee,
when all of a sudden my coffee cup picked it self up and smashed into the
wall. Odd. But then we all heard what sounded like a groaning coming from
the ceiling. We all bolted out of the house and spoke about whatn had just
happened. When we were calm enough we went back inside. All was quiet for
a few weeks, but then it seemed it came back with avegence. It was the
middle of summer and my room was always freezing cold, no matter what the
temperature was, also my boyfriend and I would get constant headaches in
there, which would go away if we entered the lounge room. The fire place
in my room would light up by iit self, and my cross at the end of my bed
would always be turned upside down.</b>
<br><b>The first room of the house which was the spare room, no one would
enter unless it was absoloutly neccessary. It was even more colder than
my room and you never ever felt alone in there.</b>
<br><b>Then at night when I put my head to the pillow, I could hear whisperings,
and my name being called. there was knocks at the front door and when someone
answered it no one would be there. Someone or something locked my brother
in the bathroom, we couldnt get /him out for over an hour.</b>
<br><b>One night whilst we were all watching tv, I saw something like a
black shadowy figure coming towards the lounge room, from the kitchen,
it floated straight towards me and my dad it kept on going and dissapeared
through the wall.</b>
<br><b>Another time when my friend was in labour, I left the house to be
with her, I forgot to tell my dad that I was going. When I got home the
next morning my dad told me that while I was out, he walked into my room
to ask if he could borrow my stereo, I apparently was sitting on my bed
holding a new born baby, He said I looked at him and smiled then a totally
strange voice came out of my mouth and started to yell profanities at him.
He got the hell out of there, but did go back in later to find that my
room had been ramsacked. And my stereo was playing at full volume.</b>
<br><b>About a month after thatmy boyfriend and I was sitting in the kitchen
talking, when we started to hear loud crashes coming from the lounge, they
kept on coming and the sound of like loud foot steps coming towards us.
I felt someone behind me and when I looked there stood a man in a top hat,
with tails and a cigar, a woman in an eighteenth century dress staring
daggers at me, another man in no clothes at all and two kids. Behind them
there was another lady telling us to get out of there, it's evil, it's
evil, she kept saying. My boyfriend and I ran to the back yard to where
our car was parked. We sat in our car for about five minutes and looked
at the kitchen window. our house was flashing like a christmas tree. In
the kitchen window we saw the most evil face we had ever seen. That's when
we got out of there. We went to my dad's friend's house and explained to
my dad what had just happened, he didn't really believe us. He went back
there the next day and continued living there for about another 3 months.
As for my boyfriend my babyand I, never went back there again. I got my
dad to pack all our belongings and send it to our new house.</b>
<br><b>I sometimes have to past that old house on Cranbourne road, in Frankston
and sometimes there are occupants there, but for some strange reason they
never seem to stay for long.</b>

<br><b>Elerbe School</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Unknown</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, my name is Daniel Hanson and I live in</b>
<br><b>Shreveport, LA.&nbsp; I am trying to start a haunted places site
for the area,</b>
<br><b>because we actually have many places to cover and the only mention
of</b>
<br><b>Shreveport I can find on any haunted site is about Elerbe school
and the</b>
<br><b>reports I've seen are not entirely correct.&nbsp; I would like to
set the record</b>
<br><b>straight on this.</b>
<br><b>I have been to Elerbe numerous times and let me say first off that
it IS on</b>
<br><b>private property and it is illegal to go out there.&nbsp; But it
is arguably THE</b>
<br><b>most haunted place in the area and kids are always going out there
on dares</b>
<br><b>and for thrills and such.&nbsp; The last time I was out there was
about a year and</b>
<br><b>a half ago when the owner drove up in his truck and brandished a
shotgun.</b>
<br><b>Needless to say I have not gone back!&nbsp; Now, onto the story...</b>
<br><b>Elerbe was a segregated black school.&nbsp; When desegregation became
law, the</b>
<br><b>school was desegregated and the students were shipped to another
school.</b>
<br><b>They closed Elerbe down and for some unforseen reason never demolished
the</b>
<br><b>buildings.&nbsp; There WAS a fire there, but that occurred after
it's closing.</b>
<br><b>Now don't get me wrong, the remaining structure definitely has a
haunting</b>
<br><b>presence, and I have had many of the classic haunting experiences
there (cold</b>
<br><b>spots, goose bumps, overwhelming fear, strange noises...) but I
have never</b>
<br><b>heard laughter nor school bells while I was there (neither have
several of my</b>
<br><b>friends.)</b>
<br><b>I believe that it's not so much the school itself that has caused
the</b>
<br><b>haunting, but the land's history and the residual affects of all
the fear</b>
<br><b>that people have released there.&nbsp; The land it is on has two
distinct reasons</b>
<br><b>for unrest.&nbsp; At first it was land owned by the Caddo Indians
and it has been</b>
<br><b>rumored that the land was sacred.&nbsp; Now pay attention to the
word RUMORED,</b>
<br><b>because I really don't know that for sure.&nbsp; The main unrest,
however, lies in</b>
<br><b>the fact that the land was part of the battle site of the Battle
of</b>
<br><b>Shreveport during the Civil War.&nbsp; Many deaths = much unrest.</b>
<br><b>Having said that I can tell you of a couple of local myths and actual</b>
<br><b>experiences had out at Elerbe.&nbsp; One of the biggest myths is
that it has been</b>
<br><b>used as a place of worship for Satanists.&nbsp; I don't believe
that, but I seem</b>
<br><b>to remember at least one newspaper articles i the past about police
arresting</b>
<br><b>teenagers in robes apparently trying to pull a prank.&nbsp; Another
myth is that a</b>
<br><b>murderer took his victims there to die.&nbsp; I have seen no evidence
of this</b>
<br><b>whatsoever.&nbsp; The myth that has caused the most vandalism is
the one about</b>
<br><b>writing your name on the wall.&nbsp; Apparently you will die if
you do.&nbsp; My name</b>
<br><b>is on the wall.&nbsp; So are the names of most of my friends, and
I assure</b>
<br><b>you...we are very much alive.</b>
<br><b>Now of actual experiences, I can tell you of two places on the grounds
that</b>
<br><b>totally freak me out one (the stage in the gymnasium) I swore I
would never</b>
<br><b>trod upon again and the other (the "alter room") I never even entered.&nbsp;
This</b>
<br><b>is a small room that for some unknown reason has a huge slab of
concrete in</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; According to myth this is where the Satanists sacrificed
their victims.</b>
<br><b>A few of my friends have had bizarre experiences with blood out
there.&nbsp; Two</b>
<br><b>swore they walked down one of the halls and stepped into a large
puddle of</b>
<br><b>blood and another said they felt what they thought was water dripping
on them</b>
<br><b>and when they went to wipe it away discovered it was blood.&nbsp;
Now I was not</b>
<br><b>present at these times, but I really have no reason to doubt them.&nbsp;
There are</b>
<br><b>possible explanations, such as the many cows which wonder in and
out of the</b>
<br><b>buildings, or prank pulling teens, but still...blood is freaky...no
matter</b>
<br><b>what.</b>

I JUST COULDN'T FACE IT. I ALSO PAYED EXTRA MONEY TO HAVE THE VET DISPOSE
OF HIS BODY. THIS MIGHT SEEM CRUEL, BUT IT'S HOW I COULD DEAL WITH IT AT
THE TIME. ANYWAY, WHEN I GOT HOME I NOTICED HIS WATER DISH WAS UPSIDE DOWN

COULD HAVE DONE IT. I CLEANED IT UP AND THOUGHT THAT HE MUST HAVE KNOCKED
IT OVER BEFORE WE</b>
<br><b>LEFT, BUT I JUST DIDN'T NOTICE IT. I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT IT AFTER
THAT. ABOUT 15 MINUTES AFTER I CLEANED IT UP, I WENT INTO MY ROOM AND WAS
SHOCKED TO SEE ALL MY BED COVERS PULLED OFF AND ON THE FLOOR. THIS FREAKED
ME OUT BECAUSE I HAD MADE MY BED BEFORE I LEFT. I WAS REALLY UPSET BY THIS
BECAUSE WHEN BENNY WAS A PUP, IF I WENT OUT AND LEFT HIM ALONE IN THE HOUSE,
HE</b>
<br><b>WOULD GO AND PULL ALL THE COVERS OFF MY BED! AS I HAVE SAID, I PAYED
FOR HIS BODY TO BE DISPOSED OF AND WHEN I ASKED THE VET WHAT BECOMES OF
THEM, HE TOLD ME THAT THE LOCAL COUNCIL COME AND PICK THEM UP AND TAKE
THEM AWAY. HE TOLD ME THAT THEY PICKED THEM UP THE DAY AFTER THEY WERE
PUT TO SLEEP. A WEEK AFTER BENNY HAD GONE, FOR SOME REALLY SILLY REASON
I FELT AS THOUGH I HAD TO RING THE VET TO SEE IF HIS BODY WAS STILL THERE.
I WAS SHOCKED TO FIND OUT THAT IT WAS! I WAS EVEN MORE SHOCKED WHEN THE
VeT TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD OVERLOOKED HIM 3 TIMES BECAUSE HIS BODY WAS SO
SMALL AND THEY JUST DIDN'T NOTICE IT! I ASKED THE VET IF I COULD TAKE HIM
HOME WITH ME SO I COULD LAY HIM IN THE BACKYARD. HE SAID I COULD AND I
WENT DOWN AND PICKED UP HIS BODY.A FEW DAYS AFTER I HAD PUT HIM TO REST,
I WENT IN MY ROOM AND FOUND HIS FAVOURITE TOY ON MY PILLOW!I HAD PUT IT
IN THE CLOSET DAYS BEFORE THAT AND HAD NOT TAKEN IT OUT. I THINK IT WAS
HIS WAY OF SAYING THANKYOU FOR BRINGING HIM HOME! I ALSO THINK THAT HE
KNOCKED OVER THE WATER, AND PULLED THE COVERS OF MY BED BECAUSE HE WAS
MAD AT ME FOR LEAVING HIM THERE.</b>

<p><b>Animal Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've had a 'strange occurance', searched the web and found your site.</b>
<br><b>My story:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Sam was our dear dog, a family member for 13 years.&nbsp;
He was 'always' by</b>
<br><b>my side, rode in the car daily to deliver/pickup kids from school,
went</b>
<br><b>on vacation, and "walked the kids".</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; On Nov. 26, 2000 Sam died peacefully at home in his favorite
spot in</b>
<br><b>the living room.&nbsp; I took his remains to be cremated at the
emergency vet</b>
<br><b>location as our normal vet was closed for the weekend.&nbsp; All
of us grieved</b>
<br><b>heavily for Sam - especially me.&nbsp; I could not bring myself
to go pick up</b>
<br><b>his ashes.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; On Dec. 24, 2000 we all went to bed as usual. During the
night I had</b>
<br><b>several dreams of Sam - the first since he had passed on.&nbsp;
I didn't</b>
<br><b>mention them when I first awoke as as I didn't want to spoil the</b>
<br><b>Christmas morning for the family.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Imagine my surprise as the oldest daughter mentioned she
dreamed of Sam</b>
<br><b>during the night (12/24/00).&nbsp; She saw him in his prime and
was playing</b>
<br><b>with him.&nbsp; The youngest daughter also said she dreamed of him
(12/24/00);</b>
<br><b>she saw him as an old dog and was petting him.&nbsp; I was shocked.
During the</b>
<br><b>night (12/24/00)I would awaken and go back to sleep several times,
having</b>
<br><b>several dreams of Sam. I dreamed of him in his prime, walking from
room</b>
<br><b>to room to check on the family as he had always done during the
night and</b>
<br><b>in the mornings.&nbsp;&nbsp; In another dream Sam came to me in
the morning to wake</b>
<br><b>me up (as in the past).&nbsp; He came in his prime, with his trademark
smile</b>
<br><b>and walked up to bed to be face to face with me.&nbsp; In the final
dream I</b>
<br><b>dreamed he was in his prime and at the vets.&nbsp; He was not at
the normal</b>
<br><b>vet's - he was at the vet's where I had taken his body to be creamated.</b>
<br><b>He stood on his hind feet behind the counter and barked at me/to
me to</b>
<br><b>come pick him up - it was time to go home!&nbsp; In the dream, a
woman worked</b>
<br><b>at the counter and did not seem to notice a five foot tall Golden</b>
<br><b>Retriever standing there barking and wagging his tail.&nbsp; I awoke
and my</b>
<br><b>first thoughts were to run to the vet's to pick up Sam - and then
I</b>
<br><b>remembered he had passed on.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I was surprised we had all dreamed of Sam that night.&nbsp;
The next day I</b>
<br><b>brought Sam home.&nbsp; I placed the box with his ashes in one of
his favorite</b>
<br><b>spots.&nbsp; That night as I walked into my room I glanced down
in front of me</b>
<br><b>- and saw Sam walking along in front of me as had done for years!&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>image was brief but absolutely clear.&nbsp; There is no doubt he
was walking</b>
<br><b>along in front of me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I 'hope' to have Sam as my friendly ghost in the house.&nbsp;
I do wonder</b>
<br><b>'if he was really here' - and then think about all of us dreaming
of him</b>
<br><b>all night.&nbsp; I loved him dearly and would love to have him for
a long,</b>
<br><b>long time with me.</b>

<p><b>My Ghost Family</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ghalls@frontiernet.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My grandmother had a stoke in her home when I was very young.&nbsp;
Because we only lived a short distance away, and my grandfather was so
scared he called us before an ambulance.&nbsp; She basically collapsed
mid sentence.&nbsp; When we got there my mother called the ambulance and
grandpa packed her a bag.&nbsp; She was basically unconsciance.&nbsp; But
my younger sister and I took turns holding her hand and talking to her.&nbsp;
She couldn't talk or open her eyes but she squeezed out hands so tight
it hurt.&nbsp; Unfortunately she never regained conscienceness and died
a short time later at the hospital.&nbsp; Many years later shortly after
my grandpa passed away, I volunteered to move in the house to keep away
vandals and save money for the estate insurance so it wouldn't be clasified
as "vacant".&nbsp; Because the family is so large and spread out over the
entire country( 11 siblings over 40 grandchildren) many of my grandparents
belongings were stored in the partially finished basement, where there
were 2 bedrooms and a large living room type area.&nbsp; I rented the basement
rooms to a couple that were friends of mine.&nbsp; In the living area there
was 2 rocking chairs and an old music box all of which belonged to my grandmother.&nbsp;
On one occasion I woke up in the morning to find my roomates sleeping upstairs
on the floor of my living room.&nbsp; When I asked them why they came upstairs
they told me they were in the main room downstairs talking when one of
the rocking chairs began to rock back and forth as if someone were barely
moving it.&nbsp; This is a basement room there are no windows near the
area and they were sitting by themselves so no one could've brushed it.&nbsp;
I thought they were crazy.&nbsp; Although I did not like to be in the basement
by myself.&nbsp; Because I would sometimes feel as if someone was watching
me, I say sometimes because there were times when I had to go down there
I would feel nothing at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to brush it off as imagination
but I also let it get the best of me.&nbsp;&nbsp; One evening while I was
home alone one of the cats got downstairs (where they are not allowed)
and I tried to catch it by following it while I was looking I heard someone
walk in the backdoor through the kitchen and to the front bedroom, a path
that was directly overhead of where I was.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the basement
was not finished and that was a heavy traffic area the floor creaks very
loudly in that area.&nbsp; Thinking it was my roomates looking for me after
arriving home I called out but no one answered.&nbsp; So I left the cat
and went upstairs to see who was in my bedroom (formally my grandparents
room)&nbsp; I didn't hear any more movements and when I reached my room
from which there are no other exits No one was there.&nbsp; Just old house
noises I dismissed them as, more, I think now just to calm my own fright.
There was also a cane that was hanging downstairs, visible from the top
of the stairs that I saw swaying as if someone was tapping it with their
finger.&nbsp; I never went downstairs alone ever after that.&nbsp; Unfortunately
a short time later my younger sister was in car accident and died at the
scene.&nbsp; I moved back home temporarily to comfort my parents.&nbsp;
Less tahn one week after I moved back to the grandparents home,&nbsp; I
was looking for the room mates so I called down to them.&nbsp; I heard
my grandma's music box start to play as I was about half way downthe stairs,
it wasn't playing when I started down the stairs.&nbsp; So I assumed they
were just curious about the old jewlery box, and were playing with it.&nbsp;
It was made by one of my Uncles and can only play when the bottom drawer
is all the way open, it also needs to be wound with a key in the back.&nbsp;&nbsp;
When I turned the corner I realized I was alone in the basement and I was
startled by the fact that the music box was completely closed.&nbsp; I
ran like I have never run before, I toke those stairs 3 at a time, slammed
the basement door and grabbed the car keys.&nbsp; I drove over to my parents
at mach 5 and Told my mom the whole story.&nbsp; She stared at me wide
eyed becuase the path that I told her the creaking sounds toke was the
exact path my grandmother was taking when she collapsed half way through
the house.&nbsp; I could not have known that because while they were telling
the paramedics about what happened the day of my grandmothers stroke we
were told to go play because we were so young we were in the way of the
EMT's trying to help.&nbsp; Also The music box was supposed to be left
to my younger sister which was also unknown to me at the time it was an
arrangement that my grandpa and mother had come to shortly before he passed
on.&nbsp; So even though she didn't claim it in life I know she used it
at least once after her passing, even if only to get a reaction out of
me.&nbsp; I never really felt threatened or like I was in any danger there,
on the contrary I actually felt more at home there than I have anywhere
else.&nbsp; It was just the unknown that made me run that day.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But in the future I plan on being a little more cooperative if they try
to contact me.&nbsp; I haven't had any strange happening since I moved
out of that house nearly 2 years ago.&nbsp; To be honest I kind of miss
living in my haunted house.&nbsp; So thats my story as hard as it may be
to believe, it is real and I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't lived
it.-</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ages as She Pleases</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: eightsailor@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I need help in trying to figure something out, can a ghost who is
in no way</b>
<br><b>related to you (friends family ect.)come and keep watch over you,
not like</b>
<br><b>an angel, it's hard to explain what it's like. You see my first
encounter</b>
<br><b>with her (in meaning the ghost) was when I was about 6 or 7. My
brother and</b>
<br><b>I were riding our bikes down a hill when a car started coming, I
was still</b>
<br><b>at the top, and I saw the car coming straight for my brother, I
stood there</b>
<br><b>petrified, then something hit me and I yelled at him, but not with
my exact</b>
<br><b>voice, it had more power in it. He stopped so quickly he nearly
slid farther</b>
<br><b>out. When he came back up he asked, "Who yelled out to me? It didn't
sound</b>
<br><b>like you..", I looked at him and said I didn't know, "I guess..well
I don't</b>
<br><b>know.." When he started peddling home I looked at both my sides
and I saw a</b>
<br><b>faint figure smiling at me. She saved my brother through me. About
2 yrs.</b>
<br><b>later I was free climbing, I was just about to the top of a rock
"mountain"</b>
<br><b>when I slipped I felt pressure under my foot as soon as I slipped,
it pushed</b>
<br><b>me to a ledge to where I could get to the top easier, once again
I saw the</b>
<br><b>face smiling she looked about my age, the same when I was 7 when
I looked at</b>
<br><b>her. This leads to another question, can a ghost age? It seems like
a yes</b>
<br><b>somewhat either that she died at an old age and made herself young
again and</b>
<br><b>grows at any rate she wishes..it doesn't make sense I know. Since
the free</b>
<br><b>climbing, I've always felt her presence. I am only 11 at this moment.
But</b>
<br><b>during school, when someone bothers me and bullies me I can see
her glaring</b>
<br><b>but she won't do anything, just set her eyes on the person who's
bugging me.</b>
<br><b>At night I watch her play, or it seems like she's playing with an
object I</b>
<br><b>can't see. But by day she follows me. With her around you could
throw me in</b>
<br><b>a pit with hyenas, bears, and wolves who haven't eaten in weeks
and I would</b>
<br><b>still come out alive (though I'd rather not like to see and try
^_^;). Well,</b>
<br><b>that is my story. A girl ghost who seems to age as she pleases and
follows</b>
<br><b>me about. I know nothing of her, I tried looking in old town books,
but</b>
<br><b>nothing. I checked the cemetery pictures of the people who had died
and were</b>
<br><b>buried there, but nothing. So, I have no info. on her.</b>

<p><b>No One There</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lsimson@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My ghost story is not very long, nor signifigant, but here it is:</b>
<br><b>Once, I was sitting in my room and I was playing my flute and then
I looked at the window (for no real reason) and what I saw almost gave
me a heart attack!!!&nbsp; There was a shadow of a person's body.&nbsp;
It was silhouetted against my window shade.&nbsp; I was so freaked that
I nearly fell off my bed!&nbsp; You see, it wasn't the body that was freaking
me out, it was the fact that it was inhumanly possible to get somebody's
whole body in front of my window because I'm on the second floor.&nbsp;
The only possible way would be if the person used a ladder, but there was
not a shadow of a ladder.&nbsp; The body did not appear to be moving at
all and I wondered if my eyes were playing tricks on me.&nbsp; I waited
about 20 seconds more and then I got up and walked shakily over to my window.&nbsp;
I yanked the string that pulled the shade up.&nbsp; I did a complete double-take!!
There wasn't anybody there.&nbsp; I let go of the string and went downstairs
and told my grandma.&nbsp; She didn't believe me.</b>

<br><b>My Updated Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lia_seria@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>i submitted a story earlier this year about my experiences with ghosts
and i</b>
<br><b>just thought u might want an update on my experiences.</b>
<br><b>september 29th 2000:- the night before my 15th birthday, i had a
bunch of my</b>
<br><b>friends stay over at my house to commemorate my last birthday in
highschool</b>
<br><b>before i graduate. we were having dinner at this restaurant within
a walking</b>
<br><b>distance from my house. thus we walked there.</b>
<br><b>after dinner , at around 9:30pm, we headed home,i had this horrible
feeling</b>
<br><b>that something bad might happen. as we reached the 4th street before
going</b>
<br><b>to my neighbourhood the feeling was getting stronger. i told my
friends</b>
<br><b>about it and maybe we should just take a detour, and they passed
my feelings</b>
<br><b>off as not used to walking at night ( i am afraid of the dark and
they know</b>
<br><b>it, however the feeling i had that night was not like any feeling
i have</b>
<br><b>when i am in a dark room).</b>
<br><b>we continued on the walk home. me trying to dismiss the feeling.
i sensed</b>
<br><b>that someone or something was following us.... i looked behind and
saw</b>
<br><b>nothing. but infront i saw this person walking with us at a constant
pace.</b>
<br><b>however, two things struct me.... no matter how slow or how fast
we were</b>
<br><b>walking, the person was still like about 10 metres ahead of us,
and he was</b>
<br><b>bare footed wearing grey, three flourescent orange striped track
pants, the</b>
<br><b>guys were commenting on it. when we hit my neighbourhood, the person
some</b>
<br><b>how vanished at the turn, not to be seen anywhere and i was very
sure that</b>
<br><b>he/she didn't go into a house because all the houses at my neighbourhood
has</b>
<br><b>electric gates that open with a loud buzzing or clicking sound when
it open</b>
<br><b>or close, no one heard any buzzing or clicking. and for it to close
so quick</b>
<br><b>was impossible because we were only about 30-50 seconds behind him/her.
and</b>
<br><b>it takes the gates about 1-2 minutes to open and another 1-2 mins
to close (</b>
<br><b>i measure all the time spaces after this incident to try to prove
that it</b>
<br><b>wasn't a hoax). thats when&nbsp; i totally lost it and told them
that something</b>
<br><b>was very wrong and they agreed with me. so we ran all the way back
home.</b>
<br><b>when i was crossing the 3 house from my house i out of no where
had this</b>
<br><b>suffocating feeling, like i couldn't breathe. i just collapsed and
the guys</b>
<br><b>had to carry me home. ( i am not an astmatic patient), i took some
medicine</b>
<br><b>and went to sleep while the others partied cos i felt really weak
for some</b>
<br><b>reason. next morning, i saw an ambulance and police outside the
house where</b>
<br><b>i has the suffocating feeling. i walked in&nbsp; and there it was
my neighbour,</b>
<br><b>Albert Wong*, a 62 year old good willed man, getting zipped up to
go to the</b>
<br><b>hospital. he apparently died at around 9:00 pm from a heart attack&nbsp;
about 2</b>
<br><b>hours after takeing his evening walk, and there was one significant
thing,</b>
<br><b>he was bare footed&nbsp; and he was wearing those track pants that
i noticed on</b>
<br><b>that guy that walked home with us.</b>
<br><b>mrs. wong*, let me into her house. she told me everything as she
is very</b>
<br><b>close to my family and me.</b>
<br><b>*names has been changed to respect the deceased family's privacy</b>

<p><b>Museum</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sarahprice3@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b>About two years ago I was doing an internship at a local museum.&nbsp;
This place was very old and the building that I was working in used to
be an old house for servants.&nbsp; One day, I was left alone in the building
to work on my own.&nbsp; I was working on the computer and the printer
was in a different room.&nbsp; So, everytime I printed something out I
would have to go down the hallway to the room where the printer was.&nbsp;
While working in the office, I heard the front door open several times,
and then I would hear someone walk up the stairs.&nbsp; However, I didn't
ever see anyone.&nbsp; Then when I would walk to the printer there was
a door to another office that would alternate being closed and opened each
time I passed.&nbsp; The windows were all closed so I knew it could not
be the wind.&nbsp; I started to get nervous, so I figured I would wait
and get all of the paper's off of the printer when I was finished.&nbsp;
As I continued working a woman came upstairs and asked time before leaving.&nbsp;
I knocked on the door again and put my hand on the door handle.&nbsp; I
heard the door unlocking from the inside and was grateful.&nbsp; I thought
the cleaning lady was there and was letting me in.&nbsp; The door swung
open, and no one was there.&nbsp; I called out the woman's name and there
was no response.&nbsp; I went to all the offices and no one was there,
so I left a note that I had come but no one was there and got out as fast
as I could.&nbsp; When telling this story to a friend of mine who used
to use the building for piano recitals, she told me she had heard the door
unlock and open and no one would be there.&nbsp; To this day, I believe
that building is haunted.</b>

<p><b>Face in the Mirror</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:ambrebamba@optusnet.com.au</b><b></b>
<p><b>I first recall seeing a spirit at the age of three. I am now 27 and
still see them now and again.</b>
<br><b>At the time of this particular spirit, I was 23 and living on the
17th floor of a highrise in fitzroy, melbourne.</b>
<br><b>Let me explain the circumstances. When I was 22, my boyfriends (now
my hubby) best friend Drew killed himself in front of a train. I had felt
Drew plenty of times before, but this time I decided to do something different
with my friend Gabby and her brother Matthew.</b>
<br><b>Gabby and I started to tune in to Drew's thoughts, we were getting
all sorts of images of him from his childhood up to when he died, he was
talking to me through thoughts. I thought this was pretty cool, as did
Gabby. Matthew was watching us and decided he wanted to join in. Matthew
had never met Drew, and when he started to get images and thoughts he freaked
out just a little. (at first he thought we were just imagining, and didn't
believe us.)</b>
<br><b>Matthew told me to sit up in front of the mirror and close my eyes.
At this moment I felt as though I had left my body, and was oblivious to
what was going on around me. I quickly snapped out of it when I heard matthew
screaming for God. I asked what had happened and Gabby and Matthew said,
that when I closed my eyes, my face began to change into Drew's, and the
look on his face was evil. I said that was impossible for I only had my
eyes closed for a brief second, they told me they were closed for a good
10 minutes.</b>
<br><b>Well I thought that was all over for the night, but I was wrong
we all huddled into bed together, because we were scared. I then felt someone
tickle my feet, then my hair was being stroked. I freaked out and lay awake
frozen in fear until the sun came up.</b>
<br><b>I should not have been scared for he was my friend, I have felt
him around me plenty of times after that night and my son can see him clearly.
But I have never done that mirror thing ever again, and probably never
will.</b>
<br><b>Thankyou for reading my story.</b>

<p><b>Been Haunted a Few Times</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Fyrebug64@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I live in Charleston, West Virginia
and have lived here all of my</b>
<br><b>life... Many strange things have happened in my house.&nbsp; When
i was a little</b>
<br><b>girl i lived in an old house ( where my current house is now standing)
built</b>
<br><b>before the 1940's.&nbsp; We know very little about the old house
but when we tore</b>
<br><b>it down we saw that past owners had used newspapers for insulation
between</b>
<br><b>the old hard wood floors and the most recent ones, the papers were
dated</b>
<br><b>1941. At a young age I heard strange sounds at night... and day.
I frequently</b>
<br><b>saw a young woman in a dark green gown, as if she was a bride's
maid or going</b>
<br><b>to the prom.&nbsp; I saw her clean and smelled a sweet perfume with
her</b>
<br><b>presence... other times she was badly beaten and smelled of liquor
and smoke.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;No one believed me because little girls, as i unfortunately
was, had</b>
<br><b>over-reactive imagina! tions.&nbsp; I saw the woman for many years
and became</b>
<br><b>unafraid for she was more like a friend than a strange woman because
i had</b>
<br><b>practically "grown up" with her image, if you would say it that
way.&nbsp; When i</b>
<br><b>was about 9 or 10 years old i was looking through my mother's old
year books</b>
<br><b>and spotted the woman, Deborah as I now know her.&nbsp; I immediately
took the</b>
<br><b>yearbook and ran to my mother and explained that that was the woman
i had</b>
<br><b>seen.&nbsp; My mother told me it was rediculous...&nbsp; The next
day, i invited my</b>
<br><b>best friend, April, who had once seen Deborah, to look at the yearbook.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>waited until my mother left for work and i went to her room and
got the</b>
<br><b>yearbook.&nbsp; I opened to where the page was supposed&nbsp; to
be; but the page was</b>
<br><b>ripped out.&nbsp; My mother still won't admit to doing it but i
am quite sure that</b>
<br><b>she was trying to hide something.&nbsp; We tore the old house down
and Deborah</b>
<br><b>just seem! ed to disappear though i haven't seen her i sometimes
still smell</b>
<br><b>her perfume.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen a face with
no hair, or other body parts for that</b>
<br><b>matter, and the brightest blue eyes i have ever seen staring at
me through</b>
<br><b>the kitchen window.&nbsp; The face was floating in the middle of
the kitchen.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>facial features looked like that of a man and its skin was flawless
and very</b>
<br><b>pale but had a soft glow to it.&nbsp; It just stared at me and i
couldn't move.</b>
<br><b>Finally, it just disappeared and i haven't seen it again .</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had many experiences
with ouiji boards but one with only two</b>
<br><b>explanations: one, i made contact with a spirit, or two, i am absolutely</b>
<br><b>silly in the head and someone with a little white jacket in their
trunk needs</b>
<br><b>to come and take me away now.&nbsp; There was an "unknown" headstone
and grave</b>
<br><b>outside my window.&nbsp; When i was around 15 curiousity got the
best of me...</b>
<br><b>having slept less than 3 yards away from this unknown dead person
for 15</b>
<br><b>years.&nbsp; So, I took my ouiji board that i had gotten for Christmas
that year</b>
<br><b>and went, alone, to the grave.&nbsp; It may not seem much now...
but being a</b>
<br><b>teenager, alone, outside, in the dark it was a big deal!&nbsp; I
asked a couple of</b>
<br><b>questions with no response.&nbsp; I was getting fed up and asked
my final question</b>
<br><b>" Who is buried here?"... now, keep in mind that I AM ALONE... the
freakin</b>
<br><b>thing spelled out "TOM RIS..." it was still m! oving and i ran as
fast as i</b>
<br><b>could inside my house without staying to read the rest.&nbsp; The
next day i</b>
<br><b>traded rooms with my brother.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are too many stories
to tell but, most recently my radio</b>
<br><b>switches off everytime a certain love song comes on and the shower
turns on</b>
<br><b>and off... not to mention that when i tell it to stop it does...&nbsp;
oh yeah,</b>
<br><b>and just a little bit ago i heard something in the kitchen and i
thought it</b>
<br><b>was my cat or dog and then something... well a bunch of stuff fell
out of the</b>
<br><b>cabinet and the doors are closed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh well.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Paranormal Experiences??</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rdywrkr@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>After reading your web page, I just decided to share my "experiences."&nbsp;
First of all, my father always used to tell us his dreams at the breakfast
table.&nbsp; He always dreamed about the dead members of his family.&nbsp;
The few times he dreamed about living ones, they died soon after.</b>
<br><b>When we moved into our house on Turner Ave. in Madison, WI, in 1961,
my uncle "Nook" in Christie, WI was diagnosed with brain cancer shortly
thereafter.&nbsp; Dad started dreaming about times they had had together
growing up.&nbsp; In 1961, there was no hope for anyone diagnosed with
brain cancer and, although we really did not acknowledge it, Dad's dreaming
about Nook and their childhood sort of confirmed to us that Nook (actually
La Verne) was going to die.&nbsp; When the call finally came that he had
passed on, we headed to Christie for the funeral.&nbsp; At the time of
the funeral, I went up to my uncle's coffin and placed a kiss on my forefinger
and touched his forehead.&nbsp; I really loved my uncle and his passing
was really hard for me.&nbsp; At the gathering after the funeral, I felt
really terrible and I was sitt was sitting on the couch in his living room,
when my aunt came into the room to tell us that the food was being served.&nbsp;
Right next to her stood my uncle, in his bib overalls, just like alsays.&nbsp;
I bolted from the room and locked myself in our car and cried.&nbsp; The
whole family was very upset by my behaviour and thought I was being really
rude; but I really saw him there, just as real as he ever was, even though
I knew he was dead.&nbsp; It was one of my first experiences with "unusual"
happenings, but not my last.</b>
<br><b>About 6 months later, it was Christmas time, and I was very sick
with a serious sinus infection.&nbsp; I had been in bed for about a week
and it was just Christmas Day.&nbsp; I had gotten up with the rest of the
family to open presents, but I was still really sick.&nbsp; One of the
presents I received was a transistor radio (a very expensive gift in those
days).&nbsp; Being still so sick, I went back to bed right after we opened
presents.&nbsp; Most of the morning, I lay with the radio on the chair
next to my bed, listening to music.&nbsp; Mom asked me later if I wanted
lunch, but I was still too sick to get up and eat lunch.&nbsp; I remember
hearing Mom doing dishes after lunch and my radio was playing "The Lion
Sleeps Tonight".&nbsp; I was laying on my right side, with my hand extended
onto the chair next to my bed, beside the radio.&nbsp; I remember feeling
horrible, with severe headache and nausea, and praying I could just go
to sleep forever, to be rid of the pain.&nbsp; Mom came in and moved my
radio up onto my desk and sat with me, holding my hand, until I fell asleep.&nbsp;
I felt so comforted and loved (this being a very unusual act for my mother,
who did not like me very much) and I felt so much better.&nbsp; I slept
until Mom called me for supper.&nbsp; I actually felt well enough after
my nap to get up and eat something.&nbsp; I thanked my mother for coming
and sitting with me.&nbsp; She said I was lying, as she had been too busy
with house work to come in and hold my hand.&nbsp; I said she had and I
even said she had a pink, flowered dress on.&nbsp; Mom always washed up
and changed clothes before my father came homefor supper in the evening,
so I did not think it odd that she had on another dress then.&nbsp; She
vehemently denied being in my room at all that afternoon.&nbsp; She said
I was quiet all afternoon and she had just ignored me and let me rest.&nbsp;
My radio, however, was on my desk, where "she" had put it.&nbsp; To her
dying day, my Mother denied being the "person" who held my hand when I
felt so sick and stayed with me that afternoon.</b>
<br><b>Ever since my mother died in 1975, I have dreamed of her frequently,
and we still fight and quarrel in most of these dreams.&nbsp; My father
died in 1982 and became part of my dreams shortly after his death.&nbsp;
I also frequently dream of my other relatives who are gone, even some I
only met once or twice.&nbsp; My brothers&nbsp; (who were both younger
than me) have also died and are now part of my dream world.&nbsp; My dreams
are also very vivid and often repetitive.</b>
<br><b>Just another quick incident, I had a beautiful collie dog, which
I adopted from a mother and son, who were moving and could not take "Nick"
with them.&nbsp; I lived out on a farm at that time and Nick was a farm
dog, so he was happy to come live where he could run.&nbsp; He had been
hit as a puppy, though, and was very shy about the road - that is until
he made the acquaintance of Shoestring, my neighbor's dog.&nbsp; Nick began
going over to Shoestring's house fairly frequently, but our road was not
much travelled and he seemed to be very cautious about crossing it.&nbsp;
One night in May of 1998, Nick was outside.&nbsp; It was about 10 p.m.
and I was watching the news.&nbsp; I thought I heard a truck going very
fast up our road and then a bang; but no one stopped and I could not see
anyone when I looked out.&nbsp; I had a very strange feeling, though, that
something was wrong.&nbsp; I went to the door and called Nick to come in.&nbsp;
He was an extremely obedient dog and always came when I called him; but,
this time, he did not come.&nbsp; I called him several more times, then
thinking he was on one of his rare jaunts with Shoestring which could take
them hours, I went to bed.&nbsp; I could not settle down, however, and
went to the door to call him again.&nbsp; He was sitting in the front yard
and I ordered him to come into the house.&nbsp; He just laid down on the
grass and did not move.&nbsp; I went out the door to give him a nudge,
but he was not there anymore, just a patch of white moonlight I had taken
to be his bib (chest hair).&nbsp; The next morning, Nick still was not
home, and I was worried.&nbsp; Finally it was time for me to leave for
work and I could not wait any longer.&nbsp; I knew he and Shoestring would
be home whenever they felt like it, so I got into my car and pulled out
of the driveway.&nbsp; Just past the neighbor's house, I saw a large blob
of red and white fur lying by the side of the road, just about 300 yds.
from my driveway.&nbsp; It was Nick and he was very dead.&nbsp; Now, as
I live and breathe, I know I saw Nick in the yard at about 11 p.m. that
night before, when I went out to call him the 2nd time.&nbsp; He was sitting
up on the lawn and then laid down, when I scolded him and told him to get
into the house.&nbsp; However, when the neighbor's brother came to pick
up the body, he said that Nick could not possibly have moved from the spot
where he was hit, as his injuries were too severe.&nbsp; He had also been
out there all night, because it had frozen that night and his coat still
had frost in a couple of spots.&nbsp; I know he was trying to tell me he
could not come home and I should not be angry with him for not obeying
me.&nbsp; Now, Nick is in my dreams, too.</b>
<br><b>So, these are my "paranormal" experiences.&nbsp; I don't really
believe in ghosts per se, but I do believe in an afterlife and that sometimes
the veil between becomes very thin.&nbsp; Thanks for letting me tell my
stories.</b>

<p><b>Unexplained Encounter in Texas</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bcpuente@vsta.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I had always been skeptical about ghosts and other unexplained things
until it happened to me.&nbsp; I was sixteen at&nbsp; the time that this
happened. The JROTC Drum &amp; Bugle Corp had been invited to Louisiana's&nbsp;
Fairmont Hotel to play at a convention honoring the Korean War Veterans
back in 1992.&nbsp; I was one of the twenty-some cadets that attended that
week-long convention.&nbsp; Our chaperones decided to take us for a tour
of the city's historical beauty. We walked through Jackson Square and visited
the Cathedral.&nbsp; However, we were all amazed by Bourbon Street. We
were not allowed to go into any of the shops for fear of getting left behind.&nbsp;
Well, that was letting a five year old loose in a candy store and not expecting
him to sample the goods.&nbsp; I disobeyed and walked into a voodoo shop
out of curiosity. It was very scary.&nbsp; The shop was full of things
that you would definitely see in scary movies where witchcraft was involved.&nbsp;
The people in there were mostly dressed in black and had chains, piercing,
and tattoos all over.&nbsp; I was only sixteen and had seen more than what
I was interested in.&nbsp; I quickly got out and luckily was not scolded.&nbsp;
After the convention we all headed back to Texas.&nbsp; It was a very long
bus ride, and I could not wait to get home.&nbsp; I was extremely tired
from the trip, so I decided to take a nap as soon as I got home.&nbsp;
The strange thing is that while I was resting my eyes, I remember seeing
a pair of arms floating around me.&nbsp; There was no torso in between
these two muscular arms.&nbsp; I thought I was just dreaming, so I tried
to wake up (or so I thought).&nbsp; As soon as I tried to get up from the
bed, these two arms pressed me to the bed.&nbsp; I began to panic and I
tried to scream, but no sound would come out of my&nbsp; mouth.&nbsp; It
was like a bad dream, but I was not asleep!&nbsp; Just then, my ten year
old brother walked in to the bedroom to see what I had gotten him from
the trip.&nbsp; As soon as he came in, I felt a sense of release.&nbsp;
I was in shock and my brother kept asking me what was wrong.&nbsp; I immediately
told my mother and I confessed that I had gone into a voodoo shop while
in Louisiana.&nbsp; I thought that I had probably brought "something" with
me.&nbsp; I am now twenty-four years old and still think about that incident.&nbsp;
It was a very scary thing to experience. I often think that whatever it
was, it did not wish to hurt me or it would have done so. However, the
powerful restraint was overwhelming. I could see the arms restraining me,
but there was nothing there. If anyone can make this out, please help me
understand it.</b>

<p><b>The Ghost I Saw</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DELWILLIA@southernco.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was about 17 yrs old, I went with a friend to someone's apartment
I</b>
<br><b>had never been to before.&nbsp; We were all sitting around in the
living room,</b>
<br><b>(about 10 of us).&nbsp; I looked down the hallway to the front door
and I saw a</b>
<br><b>foggy looking mist shaped like a person.&nbsp; I could not tell
if it was a man</b>
<br><b>or a woman.&nbsp; The shadowy figure went from the kitchen to the
stairs leading</b>
<br><b>to the second floor.&nbsp; I knew I saw something very unusual,
but for some</b>
<br><b>reason I did not say anything to anyone.&nbsp; Later during the
night, someone</b>
<br><b>noticed the old antique rocking chair was slightly rocking, though
no-one</b>
<br><b>was sitting in it.&nbsp; The guy living there explained that the
rocking chair</b>
<br><b>was his grandmothers and was passed down to him when she died. He
said that</b>
<br><b>it rocks by itself quite often and he frequently sees her.&nbsp;
I knew right</b>
<br><b>away that I had seen his grandmother.&nbsp; I did not tell anyone
there what I</b>
<br><b>saw because I did not think they would believe me.&nbsp; Why would
I say anything</b>
<br><b>after he told the story and not before he told it?&nbsp; Anyway,
I have never</b>

<p><b>Scary Date</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: catania4@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, I just want to say that I think this site is great.&nbsp; It's
so interesting to hear about other peoples experiences.&nbsp; Here's one
that happened to me when I was around 18 years old.&nbsp; I was out on
a second date with this guy Brad*.&nbsp; We had gone out for dinner and
were going over to his best friends house to hang out with some of his
friends.&nbsp; I had never met his friends before, because I didn't go
to the same high school as they did.&nbsp; So I was a little anxious about
meeting them.&nbsp; We got to his friends house.&nbsp; It was out in the
country, it was one of those old farm houses, with the big wrap around
porch.&nbsp; As soon as I got out of the car, I began to have a eerie feeling.&nbsp;
We walked up the front stairs and into the house.&nbsp; His friends came
in to the foyer to meet me, and I couldn't focus on any of them.&nbsp;
I felt extremely frightened, and it had nothing to do with them, they were
all very nice.&nbsp; I knew that I had to take off my shoes, but I was
afraid to look down, I wanted to keep looking around because I felt like
something was watching me.&nbsp; I finally managed to pull off my shoes
without really looking at what I was doing, then we went into the living
room.&nbsp; Brad and I sat down on a sofa, his friends all sat down across
from us. Everyone was chatting and I was starting to relax a bit, when
I felt a presence beside me.&nbsp; I couldn't see anything, but I could
feel it.&nbsp; I felt every hair on my body stand up.&nbsp; I knew that
whatever it was, it was female and very evil.&nbsp; Then I started to feel
cold sweeping through my body.&nbsp; Not just on my skin, but actually
through me, like I was freezing on the inside.&nbsp; I moved closer to
Brad, but didn't say anything to him or his friends, I didn't want them
to think I was crazy.&nbsp; The feeling finally stopped but I could still
feel the presence.&nbsp; About 15 mins later the T.V.&nbsp; turned on (I
remember it was this old Cheech and Chong movie on).&nbsp; Then it turned
off, then on, then off.&nbsp; It kept on doing it.&nbsp; Everyone just
kept on talking, and I was looking around to see who was holding the remote.&nbsp;
When they realized my concern, Brads best friend said, "Oh don't worry
about that, It's just the ghost".&nbsp; I looked and saw that the remote
was laying on the ottoman.&nbsp; And I realized that what I was feeling
was a ghost.&nbsp; I guess they realized that I was freaked because they
said that the ghost wouldn't hurt me, that it was very benevolent.&nbsp;
I told them that it most certainly wasn't and I told Brad to take me home.&nbsp;
He did take me home and on the way tried to convince me that the ghost
was really nice.&nbsp; Even after I explained to him about what it had
been doing to me.&nbsp; Needless to say, I never went back to that house
again.&nbsp; I also never went out with Brad again.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Paramount's Great America in Santa Clara, Ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Jim.Kohl@kla-tencor.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I worked at the amusement park when I was 16 and 17. I worked in
the stores.</b>
<br><b>There were stories circulating from my first day there that the
store I</b>
<br><b>worked in and one other store were haunted by a brother and a sister
that</b>
<br><b>were killed in a house fire on the land where the park now stands.
I don't</b>
<br><b>know the legitimacy of this claim.</b>
<br><b>My store was haunted in the upstairs store room, supposedly by the
brother,</b>
<br><b>where we kept all the stock (candy and amusement park souvenirs).
I didn't</b>
<br><b>believe in ghosts at the time because it was more convenient not
to, but if</b>
<br><b>when I was alone in that store room stacking inventory, I would
often freak</b>
<br><b>out and feel like I wasn't alone. "Go ahead and help yourself to
any of this</b>
<br><b>candy." I used to say out loud, thinking that I should make friends
with the</b>
<br><b>ghost, and that he would probably like candy since he was a kid.
I didn't</b>
<br><b>believe, like I said, but better to cover my bets!</b>
<br><b>One time I was up there with a friend of mine, and the two of us
were going</b>
<br><b>to break for lunch. I had gone downstairs, but she didn't realize
it. The</b>
<br><b>stairs were outside and led from the attic door to the back entrance
to the</b>
<br><b>store. My friend, evidently, called out to me that she would meet
me on the</b>
<br><b>stairs. I, of course, didn't answer because I was already downstairs
in the</b>
<br><b>store. My friend came running into the store looking very pale and
explained</b>
<br><b>to me that she was waiting for me to come downstairs while sitting
on the</b>
<br><b>steps when she heard the attic door open and close again behind
her and she</b>
<br><b>heard footsteps on the stairs behind her. She felt the stairs shaking</b>
<br><b>beneath the weight of someone walking on them. She wasn't freaked
because</b>
<br><b>she thought it was me, and she turned when she felt like the person
walking</b>
<br><b>down the stairs would be right behind her. There was no one there,
and</b>
<br><b>that's when she ran into the store pale as a stereotypical ghost
herself.</b>
<br><b>I started believeing in ghosts that day. This girl was really conservative</b>
<br><b>and scientific and had no room for the paranormal in her life. I
guess</b>
<br><b>that's why she was so convincing.</b>
<br><b>Just thought I would share...</b><b></b>

<br><b>Not Natural</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; Peter Whitlock</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Thought I'd write this down as I want to get all the details correct
while they're still fresh in my mind, we've all heard ghost stories from
time to time but have been cynical due to the stories tend to get passed
from hand to hand, the facts distorted and we're not sure on the reliability
of the witnesses, or&nbsp; what they seen may have been&nbsp; only for
a split second - a trick of the light or whatever. This story is different,
I know the witness very well and the sighting couldn't be put down to any
natural occurrence.</b>
<br><b>Due to the wishes of the people who own the house, unfortunately
I can't disclose exact names and locations as a) the people who own the
house have 3 young children, 2 boys aged about 10 an 12, and a young girl
- the two boys have seen the apparition but the girl hasn't, and the parents
don't want her to find out about it until she is of an age when she is
able to understand, and b) it would be fairly difficult to sell the house
if people found out it were haunted.</b>
<br><b>The sighting took place on the 29th November 2000 at approx. 13:30pm.</b>
<br><b>My Father In Law (David) is a painter and decorator, he was working
at a private residence in Surrey, England. The owner of the house was using
the cellar as a storeroom for David's paint pots etc.</b>
<br><b>David had been to the cellar earlier in the morning to retrieve
some paint and had left the light on as he anticipated making more than
one trip to the cellar that day.</b>
<br><b>At around 1.30pm he returned the cellar to get another pot of paint
and saw a chap sitting just inside the doorway of the cellar, slightly
to one side. David thought it was the telephone engineer who had been working
in the house the day before, but as David had locked all of the doors in
the house earlier that day, fearful of thieves gaining entry, he was rather
taken aback to see him there.</b>
<br><b>David was about to say "How the hell did you get in here ?", but
didn't get a chance to finish the sentence, he realised that the man was
in a sitting position and working at something, but the stool wasn't there,
neither was what the man was working on.</b>
<br><b>David was rooted to the spot, he admits he was frightened, but not
hysterical. The fear soon merged with curiosity. David, by this time, was
aware that he was looking at a ghost, his hands running backwards and forwards,
almost like he was playing a piano, but not quite, as his fingers looked
like they were fiddling with something, like doing up nuts and bolts.</b>
<br><b>The chap looked perfectly human, a man in his sixties, bald on top
with grey hair around the edges. The only thing David can remember about
his clothes are the boots, they had longer tongues than usual, and the
laces were wrapped around the neck of the boots. David also said that the
mans' skin looked really rubbery, almost like latex, which we put down
to old, weathered skin.</b>
<br><b>David thought, "If this is a ghost he won't have any eyes", as the
mans' head was bent over, engrossed in his work, David bent down to look
at the mans' face. He had eyes, they were just staring ahead, the man was
oblivious to David's presence in the room.</b>
<br><b>David estimates that he observed the ghost for around two minutes,
he was standing within 2 feet of the apparition, and the room was lit,
as I mentioned before.</b>
<br><b>Curious, David returned to the cellar about 1 minute after the original
sighting and the ghost remained there for about 30 seconds, and then just
vanished.</b>
<br><b>David told me the above story when he got back from work, and was
worried that he was hallucinating (he had been on strong painkillers 3
days earlier as he suffers with gout). I told him the only way to satisfy
his curiosity would be to tell the man he was working for about it, as
they would be bound to have witnessed it before. David was originally against
the idea as the family had only been in the house for a year, and had 3
children, and may think him mad if they hadn't seen anything. As I had
a week off work I offered to go with him the next day with my dog, as they
are more aware of supernatural activities. (but couldn't because the family
were there for the duration of the work)</b>
<br><b>As David had had a sleepless night, turning the day's events over
and over in his mind, he did tackle the man who owned the house about it
the next morning.</b>
<br><b>David said "I had a funny experience in the cellar yesterday", the
man replied "Don't tell me, you've seen the resident ghost" (he had a pet
name for it, something like 'Old Obstinate')</b>
<br><b>Apparently the man was the first of the family to see it. They&nbsp;
had a thunderstorm which took out the main fuse box. The man went down
to the cellar, armed with a torch to replace the fuse. He didn't see the
ghost until he had replaced the fuse and the lights came back on. It was
standing in the corner of the cellar, just staring at him. Not a malicious
stare, just looking.</b>
<br><b>The man contacted the previous owners who reluctantly admitted to
have seen the ghost, and locked the cellar up, never to go down there again.
I know they didn't sell the house due to the haunting, but due to divorce,
as David had worked at the house before, for the previous tenant (and of
course, didn't go to the cellar as it was out of bounds)</b>
<br><b>The previous occupants had tried to have an exorcism performed in
the cellar, but it didn't work.</b>
<br><b>The two boys have also seen the ghost, but aren't that worried about
living under the same roof as it. The man took his father to the cellar
to see if they could see it, the man could see the ghost but his father
couldn't. David said he was going to see if he could spot if again and
try to prod it with a paint roller but the man told him that once he had
reached out to touch the ghost and it had vanished.</b>
<br><b>Some years ago, David had worked for a well-known expert in the
field of para-normal activities, and offered to contact him so he could
take a look, and maybe find out a little about the ghost, but the householder
declined the offer, as he didn't want any publicity, as mentioned before.</b>
<br><b>David went down to the cellar at the same time the next day, but
the ghost wasn't there, he worked in the house until the end of the week
and didn't see it again.</b>
<br><b>The family aren't that worried about living in the house as the
ghost is only ever seen in the cellar, and doesn't make any noises, this
may be due to the fact that the cellar is the only original part of the
house still standing, the main part was destroyed in a fire in the 1920s.</b>
<br><b>As the ghost is often seen working, we presume that he was possibly
a builder, maybe he worked on the original house, maybe he lived there&nbsp;
-who knows, but one thing is certain, the clarity of the sighting, backed
up by 3 other people that have seen it makes this the most convincing ghost
sightings I have experienced.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Grandfather's Experience with a Medium</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:dma1@shentel.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My grandfather, Dennis, was born in 1888 in Lawrence County, Ohio,
on the banks of the Ohio River.&nbsp; He told me a "haunting" story when
I was about 15 years old.&nbsp; You would have to know my grandfather;
I am sure this really happened to him.</b>
<br><b>When he was a young man, seances and mediums were all the rage.&nbsp;
Consequently, there were many charlatans; those who took advantage of peoples'
belief in the afterlife.&nbsp; In a town on the Ohio (I think it might
have been Cincinnati, but I am not sure) there was a medium named Mrs..
Blake who had so much success contacting spirits that some thought she
must be a fraud.&nbsp; Therefore, the local newspaper dared Mrs.. Blake
to go with some of their reporters on a raft into the Ohio River, and contact
spirits from there, which she did.&nbsp; My grandfather had a friend who
decided to go visit Mrs.. Blake and try to contact his father, who had
died without a will.&nbsp; He asked my grandfather to go with him.</b>
<br><b>Mrs. Blake lived in a small house in town.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was in
the summer, and they had to wait on her porch for a while before they could
see her.&nbsp; When it was finally their turn, they entered a sunny room,
where she sat in the middle of the floor in a rocking chair.&nbsp; She
had a metal horn in her lap. She commented on the heat, and that she was
tired.&nbsp; My grandfather's friend started to explain why he was there,
but she told him just to be quiet.&nbsp; In a few minutes, my grandfather
said that the "horn" jumped on her lap and she answered it, like we would
a telephone.&nbsp; She told my grandfather it was for him!&nbsp; He was
very surprised.&nbsp; He said that he picked up the horn, and it "jumped"
and pressed against his ear.&nbsp; He heard the voice of a niece of his,
who had died the previous year, when she was only 10.&nbsp; She said "Uncle
Dent? This is Sarah.."&nbsp; He recognized the nickname Dent immediately--that
was what his family called him, at home.&nbsp; Even the friend he was with
didn't know this name.&nbsp; He asked Sarah where she was, and she said
"the ninthsphere" (whatever that is) and that she was very happy, but sorry
that her mother was still so sad.&nbsp; He asked her how he would know
that it was really her, and asked her where HE was when she died.&nbsp;
She replied that he was on the way to the train station to pick up another
relative who was coming to see her.&nbsp; Which was exactly what had happened.&nbsp;
He had gotten back to the house with this relative, only to find that she
had passed away while he was gone.&nbsp; Suddenly, a rude voice interrupted
their conversation, saying "you have talked long enough, now it is my turn"
(or something to that effect) and Sarah's voice disappeared.&nbsp; This
rude "person" turned out to be an Indian that my grandfather had met as
a child years before.&nbsp; I can't&nbsp; remember what this person said,
unfortunately, or how it was that my grandfather's friend eventually came
to talk to his father, but he did.&nbsp; This fellow talked with his father
about the family business for a bit, then asked for proof that this was
indeed his father.&nbsp; The voice replied that the noise under the floor
of the hunting cabin where the fellow had been staying the week before
had been him.&nbsp; The guy said that it could have been groundhogs, so
the father said that he would visit him that night in the hotel that he
and my grandfather were staying in.&nbsp; Sure enough, that night a round
light appeared coming in the window, traveled along the wall, and went
out through the crack at the top of the door.</b>
<br><b>I had known this story for a number of years before I discovered
while watching a TV documentary called "The Stately Ghosts of England"
that ghosts sometimes appear as round lights and travel along walls.&nbsp;
And years after that I saw the type of horn that my grandfather described,
that mediums used for communication, in a museum.</b><b></b>

visiting the</b>
<br><b>shadowlands quite often ! anyway, my name is lisa from knoxville,
tn, and i</b>
<br><b>am a firm believer in the paranormal world because i have had personal</b>
<br><b>contact with it, like all of you. my first and most important experience
to</b>
<br><b>relate takes place in martin, tn when i was 9 years old--my father
had just</b>
<br><b>married my stepmother and we had moved into a new house that he
had built</b>
<br><b>for us, but it was on old farmland -don't know the history, since
we moved</b>
<br><b>back to knoxville when i was 13.&nbsp; I was asleep in my room one
night, and i</b>
<br><b>awoke to feel a presence standing by my bed--i was on my side facing
the</b>
<br><b>window, and i got the strong sense of a very tall, almost up to
the ceiling</b>
<br><b>tall, form standing looking down at me--got the sense that if i
were to turn</b>
<br><b>and look at it, it would be black--also sensed that it was not friendly
at</b>
<br><b>all--i was so terrified that i literally could not move, and i lay
like that</b>
<br><b>for some time until i must have fallen back asleep--and no, it was
not a</b>
<br><b>nightmare--i think children are very open and sensitive to pyschic
things,</b>
<br><b>and we must believe them when they say that something happened--I
was not</b>
<br><b>believed.&nbsp; This left such a strong impression on me that i
remember it to</b>
<br><b>this day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ---------Another experience happened
to me in 1995 when me and</b>
<br><b>my then-husband had just moved into a house built in 1942 near downtown</b>
<br><b>Knoxville--it was our first night in the house, and since it was
July, we</b>

in the</b>
<br><b>living room unpacking boxes, when i turned around and saw a big
orange and</b>
<br><b>white cat sitting on the front porch staring right at me-not my
husband,</b>
<br><b>just me--being an animal -lover, i went to the door hoping to be
allowed</b>
<br><b>outside to pet it, but the cat disappeared.--i looked for it in
the weeks,</b>
<br><b>months, and years that have followed, but have never seen it again,
and have</b>
<br><b>asked around the neighborhood, but nobody else has ever seen it--i

<br><b>doesn't sound unusual, but even my husband said there was "somethin'
wierd</b>
<br><b>about that cat" !---i still live in this house by the way, and sometimes
i</b>

<p><b>Is it just my imagination?</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know if this is true,
or just my imagination being that both</b>
<br><b>times I saw a ghost I had just awakened to a dark room.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One time when I was about 7 or 8
I woke up and looked down from the</b>
<br><b>top bunk of a bunkbed and noticed a little boy not much younger
than myself</b>
<br><b>standing in front of my dresser.&nbsp; To this day I can still picture
him very</b>
<br><b>vivdly.&nbsp; He was in blue footed pajamas and he held a yellowish
colored</b>
<br><b>blanket in his right hand.&nbsp; I remember him as having brown
hair.&nbsp; He just</b>
<br><b>stood there and looked at me.&nbsp; I then closed my eyes and tried
to force</b>
<br><b>myself to sleep, and when I woke up the next morning I told my brother
about</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; To my surprise, he told me that he too had a visitor.&nbsp;
He was visited by</b>
<br><b>a little girl, but he did not go into detail about what she did
or what she</b>
<br><b>looked like.&nbsp; I can't say that my brother is the most truthful
person in the</b>
<br><b>world, so I don't know if he made that up.&nbsp; What I do know
is what I saw</b>
<br><b>though.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second thing that happened to
me was when I shared a room with my</b>

were not</b>
<br><b>bunked.&nbsp; I woke up at about 11:00 - midnight and I looked behind
my bed</b>
<br><b>towards my clock to see what time it was.&nbsp; I didn't see the
time, but what I</b>
<br><b>did see was a small woman glowing white.&nbsp; She appeared to have
little hair,</b>
<br><b>but what I saw of it was long. He clothes were torn at the bottom,
and she</b>
<br><b>appeared not to notice me.&nbsp; She was walking or floating towards
my bookshelf.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I put my head down and closed my eyes as tightly as they would
go as if to</b>
<br><b>give her the impression I was sleeping.&nbsp; But I couldn't do
that because I was</b>
<br><b>shaking with fear so badly.&nbsp; The only thing that I could do
was get up and</b>
<br><b>make a mad dash to turn on the light.&nbsp; Once I did this I never

<p><b>The Cemetery</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Janet.McCormack@sciatl.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Everyone I know has heard this story and I feel compelled to share
it with you. My name is Janet , I'm a Georgia native, and I grew up running
around in the woods of North Georgia near Lake Burton. Burton is a town
that has disappeared - it is actually under the lake, which was built in
the early 1900s. It is a beautiful area, and one very dear to my heart,
but one which experienced great hardship and disease in the 1800s and early
1900s.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, there is a small cemetery in the woods just off the little
dirt road where my parents live. The best my family and I can figure is
it was moved there prior to the flooding of the valley to make the lake.
There is no apparent settlement or church or anything nearby. Sadly enough,
almost everyone in the cemetery is under 20, and there are several babies,
children and women who died in childbirth. The stones are made of local
granite, and some are literally uncut stones that have been simply hand
chiseled with a name and date of death by a grieving father or mother.
There are indentations in the ground from the deteriorated pine coffins,
and there is beautiful thick moss carpeting many of the graves.</b>
<br><b>When I was about 13 or 14, I was up there in the summer (the cabin
was only a vacation cabin when I was a child; my parents live there now)
and I was alone, bored, and riding my bike on the dirt road in the middle
of a sunny, hot afternoon. Last thing I expected was to see a ghost. I
rode my bike past the little graveyard, and across the street from the
graveyard, I saw two children about my age or a little younger standing
in the middle of some leafy huckleberry bushes looking at me rather solemnly.
I didn't get a good look at them, but I distinctly saw that one was wearing
a purple/lavender top and they appeared to be a boy and a girl. I was bored
and hoping for someone closer to my age to talk to, and they really looked
perfectly alive and real, only very quiet and serious. I waved at them
and called out to them... and they disappeared. I thought they must have
ducked down in the undergrowth or ran away, so I went up in the woods to
look for them and I didn't see or hear anything. I called out and no one
answered. I got very spooked and chilled and I ran and grabbed my bike
and pedaled home as fast as I could.</b>
<br><b>That's it! I really don't know if they were ghosts or just kids
messing with me but it sure scared me. That's the only ghost story I know
of where the ghosts appear in broad daylight. Spooky, huh? I don't think
these ghosts need investigating; I think they should be left in peace,
but I saw your website and thought I'd share my one and only ghost story
with you.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Ghost Katrina</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ed@futnet.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm a fourteen year old raised by a skeptic family.Well I clearly
believe. One day I was home alone late at night. I walked past the window
and seen a girl with really curly golden hair. she had the most beautiful
brown eyes. She was wearing a light-blue dress and her arms were reaching
out toward me. That was the first time I seen her. The second time I seen
her I was outside in the dark alone walking down the street. I suddenly
got chills down my spine. Then I looked at my side and there she was again.</b>

into the air without touching them. I saw this with my own eyes!&nbsp;
He was trying to see who was in my room because my aunt looks alot like

<br><b>Friend Died</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I am only in the 10th grade but I still think that younger people
have more</b>
<br><b>of a connection with the other side(ghosts). Well, I will be 17
next month</b>
<br><b>and I had to go through one of the worst experiences of my life.
A friend</b>
<br><b>from K-10 grade had died and I felt terrible I didn't want to eat
or</b>
<br><b>anything. I always had a dream and saw her in it one way or another,
even if</b>
<br><b>you only saw her face and that was it but she was always there.
Well, one</b>
<br><b>night I had a really weird dream that she was not dead but we were
all at her</b>
<br><b>funeral. It was like she just came back to life to talk to me and
tell me</b>
<br><b>that she was fine. When I told her that she was dead and I would
never see</b>
<br><b>her again she said that she was not dead and that I would see her
really</b>
<br><b>soon. When I woke up I was crying really hard and I woke up my Mom
to talk to</b>
<br><b>her so I would not be alone and she told me it was all just a dream
and I</b>
<br><b>would be fine. well a few weeks had past and I still could not get
that dream</b>
<br><b>out of my head. Then one night I went to sleep at about 10:30 and
had the</b>
<br><b>same dream but she had something in her hand, and it was a best
friends ring</b>
<br><b>that I had given her in the 4th grade. I had lost mine a long time
ago and</b>
<br><b>she told me that I was always going to be her friend. Then a flash
back of</b>
<br><b>the last time I saw her came to me in the dream. She told me that
she loved</b>
<br><b>getting her PIC taken. Then I woke up the next morning to get ready
for</b>
<br><b>school and I opened my jewelry box and the ring that was in her
hand that I</b>
<br><b>had lost was there in my box with the obit of her but it was the
picture part</b>
<br><b>not the hole obit. I have not told my Mom anything about that night.
The ring</b>
<br><b>that she had in her hand s still in my box. Well, after that my
dreams had</b>
<br><b>stopped until the other night. The only thing that happened in the
dream was</b>
<br><b>when she said that I was going to see her soon and that was the
end of the</b>
<br><b>dream. I had to walk home from school the next day and I decided
to take the</b>
<br><b>back roads. I was getting ready to walk through the alley in the
back of my</b>
<br><b>yard and I couldnt. it felt like somebody pushed my away and all
of a sudden</b>
<br><b>I saw my friend and then out of nowhere a car came zooming by! My
friend told</b>
<br><b>me that I was going to see her soon and when I did I was really
happy. I</b>
<br><b>believe that she saved my life and I will see her again one day
in heaven.You</b>
<br><b>are the only people that I have told this too. The reason that I
told it to</b>
<br><b>you is because I think that you will not make fun of me. I am scared
that all</b>
<br><b>of my friends would say that I was not telling the truth. I beleive
that you</b>
<br><b>would not do that to me and I am going to trust you good people.</b>

<p><b>In My Old House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: STRONGBREW55@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>About two years ago me and my family moved.In the house i used to
live in i</b>
<br><b>had a some things happen to let me know it was haunted. We lived
on the</b>
<br><b>second floor and my granpa lived on the first floor. The first experience</b>
<br><b>happened when i was about 6 or 7 years old, it was early in the
morning and</b>
<br><b>everyone was sleeping ,i walked to the hall and could see straight
to my</b>
<br><b>brothers room and i seen a white blurry spectere with an odd shaped
pointy</b>
<br><b>head peeking out from behind the door way. I&nbsp; just woke up
and thought i was</b>
<br><b>seeing things maybee,but now when i remember it, i did see something.
The</b>
<br><b>next thing was the foul odor(had a very vapory presence to it) in
the</b>
<br><b>dowstairs hall way by my grandfathers door,the smell would come
and go mainly</b>
<br><b>in the morning hours.Another thing was the feeling of being chased
up the</b>
<br><b>basment stairs up into the hall(where the odor was) and up the stairs
to the</b>
<br><b>second floor.My sister dreaded the basement. The most striking incedent
was</b>
<br><b>when i was doing dishes in the kitchen and i could see the doorway
and hall</b>
<br><b>from the corner of my eye ,my brother was facing towards me and
in the</b>
<br><b>doorway i seen a woman in a long brown dress casually walk by the
kitchen ,my</b>
<br><b>heart droped into my stomach.There were also&nbsp; a time when my
brother was</b>
<br><b>coming from his room and saw someone dart into the kitchen,thinking
it was me</b>
<br><b>but No that was not me darting in the kitchen. One creepier thing
was when we</b>
<br><b>were out and my brother was home alone he heard a sinister impish
laugh from</b>
<br><b>behind the tv. And to finish the story off every now and then i
had some</b>
<br><b>vivid freaky dreams associated with certain areas of the house.So
thank you</b>
<br><b>for reading and that ends my tale of the occurences that happened
in my old</b>

<br><b>Hockey Ghosts?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: don.mccauley@sympatico.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I live in a small town in northern Ontario, Canada.
Directly behind</b>
<br><b>our family homestead (which was built in the mid 1920's) there runs
a</b>
<br><b>small winding creek. Because beavers are common in the area, the
creek</b>
<br><b>is often blocked by beaver dams which results in wide flooded areas</b>
<br><b>(these are referred to as beaver ponds.)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beaver ponds, when frozen over in winter, make
great outdoor skating</b>
<br><b>rinks. Local legend has it that at sometime shortly after the end
of The</b>
<br><b>Great War (WWI) a terrible tragedy occurred somewhere along the
run of</b>
<br><b>this creek. Apparently two young boys (their ages vary depending
on who</b>
<br><b>is telling the story, but I am inclined to believe that they were
about</b>
<br><b>11 or 12 years old) were out on a beaver pond playing hockey when
the</b>
<br><b>ice gave way and they plunged into the black frigid water. Their
home</b>
<br><b>was some short distance away (actually it is said that their homestead</b>
<br><b>was built close to where mine now stands, but that it was destroyed
by</b>
<br><b>fire a few years before our family home was built.) Regardless,
it is</b>
<br><b>assumed that their cries for help went unheard and they perished.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a boy I do remember finding certain remnants
(rusted nails etc.)</b>
<br><b>of a house or cabin in the field near the edge of our property.
I also</b>
<br><b>recall a rough and weather-beaten old cross in the local cemetery
which</b>
<br><b>my parents had told me marked the grave of the boys. The exact locale
of</b>
<br><b>the sad death of the boys is rather uncertain as the geography of
the</b>
<br><b>marshy area tends to change dramatically over the years. Still the</b>
<br><b>entire area can best be described as lonely and desolate. Many times</b>
<br><b>small lights (exactly like the glow of a cigarette tip) have been
seen</b>
<br><b>in swampy areas along the banks of the creek at times when no-one
should</b>
<br><b>be there. One night, when I was a teenager, some friends and I were
out</b>
<br><b>in my driveway when we noticed a cigarette tip (so we thought) in
the</b>
<br><b>distance glowing bright orange and then momentarily disappearing
from</b>
<br><b>sight as if someone were standing in the distance facing us and
casually</b>
<br><b>smoking. The only problem was if someone was standing there they
would</b>
<br><b>be up to their knees in muddy water. Also it was between three and
four</b>
<br><b>o'clock in the morning (very late to go traipsing around in a marsh.)
We</b>
<br><b>grabbed some weapons and went toward the glow to investigate, but
it</b>
<br><b>simply disappeared.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A year or so afterward another local man was
walking home very close</b>
<br><b>to this same general area. When he reached the bend of the road
that</b>
<br><b>comes closest to the banks of the creek, he swears that he could
hear</b>
<br><b>splashing and rustling sounds as if something (or someone) were</b>
<br><b>following him. Out of breath he stopped at our house to call home
for a</b>
<br><b>ride. He nervously tried to laugh it off as he explained the story
to my</b>
<br><b>parents, but I was there and I can tell you in all honesty that
I have</b>
<br><b>never seen a person who looked as scared as that man did. Other
people</b>
<br><b>have claimed to have seen and heard odd things in that area (there
is</b>
<br><b>even one, admittedly dubious, account of an apparition of an old
man ...</b>
<br><b>supposedly the father or uncle of the drowned boys who has appeared</b>
<br><b>twice near the banks of the creek ... both times to the same witness.)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must conclude with one last account involving
myself. At the time</b>
<br><b>I dismissed it without much thought, but as the years go by I am
more</b>
<br><b>inclined to be amazed at how inexplicable this simple event actually</b>
<br><b>was. When I was very young (about eight or nine) I was down on the
creek</b>
<br><b>skating on the rough scarred surface batting a couple of ragged
dog</b>
<br><b>chewed pucks around. About midway through my work-out I took off
my hat</b>
<br><b>and placed it somewhere in the area. By the time I was finished
playing</b>
<br><b>I had forgot where I had left it. Now my mother was extremely psychotic</b>
<br><b>over lost hats and mitts and I had received a blast on the subject
only</b>
<br><b>days earlier. Needless to say I searched extra hard for the hat,
but to</b>
<br><b>no avail. Finally I walked wearily (and wobbly as anyone who has
had to</b>
<br><b>walk over rough ground on old-fashioned ice skates will sympathize
with)</b>
<br><b>up the trail&nbsp; from the creek to where I had left my boots.
And there</b>
<br><b>tucked neatly inside one boot was my green woolen hat. How quickly
I</b>
<br><b>told myself that I had left it there all along, how quickly I dismissed</b>
<br><b>it as no big deal. Except I never ever tucked my hat in my boots,
it was</b>
<br><b>not a habit of mine to do so. And like it or not I remember distinctly</b>
<br><b>taking that hat off because I was sweating like a pig from playing</b>
<br><b>hockey. It was the last time I ever skated on the creek, and although
I</b>
<br><b>have since inherited the homestead from my parents I seldom venture
down</b>
<br><b>the hill to the creek. And I bring my son to the community rink
to</b>
<br><b>skate.</b><b></b>
