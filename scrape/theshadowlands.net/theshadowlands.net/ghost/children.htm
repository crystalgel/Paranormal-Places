<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">The existense of ghosts has been debated for
centuries.&nbsp; It is only in modern times with technology having advanced
to it's current stage that we may now capture on film and audio what many
believe to be images of the supernatural.&nbsp; The questions of why some
can and yet others cannot see or sense the presense of these entities has
been contested with numerous theories both for and against the subject
of spirits.&nbsp; One such cause for speculation is do our children see
and sense what many adults either cannot or will not see?</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">&nbsp;&nbsp; One theory is that children have
not had years to adjust their thinking and have not had the time to train
themselves as to what to accept or not accept as reality like adults have.&nbsp;
Adults program their thinking and consequently refuse certain images, noises,
and feeling as real simply</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">because in our minds we cannot accept impossible
or unproven science.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">&nbsp;&nbsp; Some parents unknowingly start
to teach and train their children at a very young age to block these images.&nbsp;
They do it out of protection and misunderstanding of the situation.&nbsp;
How many parents have tucked their little ones back into bed with the words
that they thought were reassuring; there are no such things as ghosts,
you just had a bad dream, it wasn't real, it</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">was just your imagination? I think most parents
are guilty of this including myself.&nbsp; How many parents are guilty
of telling their children that their imaginary friend is not real, maybe
not realizing that not only is that friend real but a ghost?&nbsp; I am
sure it has happened before. Do you ever wonder if any of those bad dreams,
those images seen in the night, those imaginary friends how many may actually
be ghosts that for whatever reason have shown themselves to a child?</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we tell our children
it was just a bad dream we may inadvertently teaching them to mistrust
what they may have actually be seeing.&nbsp; Eventually training themselves
to block what they have been taught cannot be real.&nbsp; Where as the
opposite side of this theory; the parent who teaches their children that
sometimes for whatever reason, a spirit may linger after death,</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">is leaving a space in that child to be able
to accept the vision, the noise or the feeling of the supernatural.&nbsp;
Could this be why some people are able to accept the supernatural with
an open mind and yet others cannot? Does the door get shut at childhood
or can it remain open?&nbsp; This is just one of the may theories used
to explain why children see more of the supernatural world</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">then adults do.&nbsp; Comments are indeed
welcome!</font></b>
