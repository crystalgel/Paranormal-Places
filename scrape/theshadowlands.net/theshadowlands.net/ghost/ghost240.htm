<BR><B>Experience</B>

<P><B>By: clifwilson@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>I had an experience one night at the now Pittsburgh</B>
<BR><B>Job Corps Center.&nbsp; Rumor has it that it used to be a</B>
<BR><B>asylum or hospital for the criminally</B>
<BR><B>insane....something to that effect.&nbsp; Of course I</B>
<BR><B>didn't believe it, but one night something happened</B>
<BR><B>that changed my thinking.&nbsp; One night, as I lay in bed,</B>
<BR><B>I was laying on my stomach when I heard a voice come</B>
<BR><B>from right over my head, "Young man, young man",</B>
<BR><B>calling me in a sort of whisper.&nbsp; I was the only one</B>
<BR><B>in that room, so I jumped up, ran out to the hallway,</B>
<BR><B>and asked the monitor had he seen anyone in the</B>
<BR><B>hallway or in the room.&nbsp; This guy, who was religious,</B>
<BR><B>replied, "No, noone's been out here for the past 15</B>
<BR><B>minutes, why?"&nbsp; I stayed up all night, but it never</B>
<BR><B>happened again after that.</B>

<BR><B>Dreams Come True</B>

<P><B>By: frankt@localaccess.net</B>

<P><B>Back in 1991 I had a dream that my boyfriend and I were sitting in
a well</B>
<BR><B>lit room talking. I was sitting on his lap telling him a funny story
or</B>
<BR><B>incident when I noticed people giving me weird looks ( it was a
small get</B>
<BR><B>together of some kind). Finally a guy yelled over and asked me who
I was</B>
<BR><B>talking to. I said: " I'm talking to Norman!" The guy said: "that
isn't</B>
<BR><B>possible - he's dead"! This went back and forth for a bit till I
finally</B>
<BR><B>woke up crying with that ache in my chest you get when you get very
bad</B>
<BR><B>news. I'm sure alot of you know what I mean. To make this short,
my</B>
<BR><B>boyfriend was killed one month to the day, in a freak motorcycle
accident!</B>
<BR><B>Needless to say I never want to ever have another dream like this
one!</B>
<BR><B>Anyone out there know about this kind of thing? My Dad said it was
God's</B>
<BR><B>way of preparing me for the loss - didn't work though. NOTHING prepares
you</B>
<BR><B>for that!!!! One more thing that I find strange. He died in the
same year</B>
<BR><B>that the movie Ghost came out, the only movie we saw together in
a theater,</B>
<BR><B>and I had agreed to marry him the same day he died like the characters
in</B>
<BR><B>the movie</B>

<P><B>Conneaut Lake Hotel</B>

<P><B>By: tleydig@mmlpc.com</B>

<P><B>My husband, 3 year old son (Bret) and I visited the hotel and park
on</B>
<BR><B>Memorial Day weekend of this year.&nbsp; When my son and I entered
the hotel,</B>
<BR><B>I approached the front desk.&nbsp; My son wanted to go in the common
room</B>
<BR><B>opposite the front desk.&nbsp; I peaked in the told my son it was
empty, he</B>
<BR><B>could go in, but be careful.&nbsp; I turned back to the desk clerk
to check</B>
<BR><B>in and my son came back out of the room and said "Mommy, I see someone</B>
<BR><B>in here."&nbsp; I looked in the room again and said again that it
was empty,</B>
<BR><B>to go ahead and play in that room.&nbsp; When I turned back to the
desk clerk</B>
<BR><B>she looked stricken and said that that room was haunted as well
as the</B>
<BR><B>third floor.&nbsp; She said a man shows up in your photos sometimes.&nbsp;
I went</B>
<BR><B>in and took a picture of my son in front of the fireplace.&nbsp;
When I got</B>
<BR><B>the photos develed, that picture (as well as the next picture that</B>
<BR><B>someone took for me of my son and me in that room) were so blurry
it you</B>
<BR><B>can't distinguish our features.&nbsp; The rest of the roll of film
is fine.</B>
<BR><B>Later that night my son and I went "exploring" on the third floor.&nbsp;
We</B>
<BR><B>took my&nbsp; camera and a flashlight (even thought there was lighting
in the</B>
<BR><B>hallways).&nbsp; When we approached the room which I believed was
to be</B>
<BR><B>haunted (it was unmarked with a door number), I checked the door
to see</B>
<BR><B>if it was unlocked.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it was locked.&nbsp; My
son and I then</B>
<BR><B>walked past the room and then the flashlight went out.&nbsp; I turned
quickly</B>
<BR><B>and started to take a picture down the hall.&nbsp; I was drawn back
to the</B>
<BR><B>door to take a picture, but then decided to take a shot of the long</B>
<BR><B>hallway with the doorway in the photo in the foreground to the right.</B>
<BR><B>That was the last of my film so&nbsp; my son and I headed down the
hall to</B>
<BR><B>leave.&nbsp; I became disoriented and could not find the stairs
down.&nbsp; I told</B>
<BR><B>my son that mommy was lost and he calmly took my hand and said he
would</B>
<BR><B>get us "outta here".&nbsp; He lead me right to the stairs (even
though we had</B>
<BR><B>the turn several times to get there).&nbsp; The photo that I took
of the</B>
<BR><B>hallway has (I believe) a dark figure standing by the door to the
right</B>
<BR><B>and it is even blocking the chairrail for a part.&nbsp; The first
lighting</B>
<BR><B>fixture on the right in the photo is blocked and defused and it
looks</B>
<BR><B>like a figure standing with a veil.&nbsp; I do not scan well, but
will try to</B>
<BR><B>send the photos soon.</B>

<BR><B>Black Magic</B>

<P><B>By: purple_haze85@lycos.com</B>

<P><B>All though some people are really haunted by ghosts, others are victims
of black magic and unfortunately I fall into this category. I was only
12 when this happened to my family&nbsp; and although I knew what was happening
to our house was very much real I really didn t bother much, though now
I realize it was pretty serious. It all started in December around 4 years
back. It started off with knockings on the door which became more fierce
and intense as December changed into January. Although at first my mother
and sisters thought it was just a ghost, we were wrong. We never opened
the door, as the knockings took place everyday exactly at sunset. All we
could do was pray and chant holy verses. They seemed to have no effect.
We could all hear something scratching on the main door as if something
wanted to come in. there was another room in our house, the guest room(rarely
used and secluded from the rest of the house) where high paranormal activity
took place. We actually felt the presence of&nbsp; something&nbsp; over
there. it has been four years and everyone has well...forgotten about it,
my sister and I still feel&nbsp; its&nbsp; presence, even (only) our beds
shake sometime, but as soon as we utter holy verses it stops. No one goes
into the guest room though! But sometimes I am strangely attracted towards
it; I go and sit there for hours... alone, I really don t know why! Well
that s my story, just keep in mind if your house is haunted it could very
well be black magic!</B>

<BR><B>Black Circle</B>

<P><B>By: CARLYFREDSON@prodigy.net</B>

<P><B>Dear Shadowlands:</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night, I was home alone and it was pitch
black.&nbsp; I decided to go to bed, since it was already midnight.&nbsp;
As I was falling asleep, I felt a hand parting my hair down the middle.&nbsp;
I didn't know who or what it could be, and I was so scared that I couldn't
move for a while.&nbsp; Finally, I gathered up the courage to turn around,
and face whatever this thing was.&nbsp; There was no one there, and I was
still home alone--nobody was in the house with me.&nbsp; Then I looked
up in the corner of my room and saw a small, round light, which seemed
to move a little, then disappear right into the wall.&nbsp; I finally fell
asleep after what it seemed like hours, and decided to check the corner
where the light disappeard.&nbsp; There was a hole in the wall and a black
circle around it--it was never there before that night.</B>

<P><B>Beloved Dog</B>

<P><B>By:lance.simcox@btinternet.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Hi there... I am sending this from the UK... found your site through
Laura Haskell " Bluemoon" to which I subscribe.....</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thought you might be interested in an experience I
had some 11 years ago concerning a much loved dog I lost at that time....in
fact, I have had a couple of similar experiences concerning the loss of
a dog.....</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;This particular experience happened within a week or so of
having to have an Alsatian called "Fritzy" who was 14, put down through
the regrettable illness most Alsatians suffer from in their old age, which
culminates in them not being able to walk on their hind legs and they also
loose control of their bowels, which I believe, cause's the dog a great
loss of dignity, so there is then only one course of action for an owner
to take, and that is a trip to the vets....</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; We nursed Fritzy for over a year with this complaint,
but one day, as I walked down the stairs, Fritzy looked at me, lying in
his bed in the hallway, with such pity in his eye's, I could not put off
the inevitable any longer....I did the morning clean up, phoned the vet,
and the deed was done......</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; A couple of months or so before this time, we came home from
a shopping trip to find a small, black, long haired, Welsh border collie
bitch, trying to get at some water in our outside kitchen drain, she was
on her last legs and unable to stand up, we took her indoors and cleaned
her up. My! was she in a pitiful condition... we adopted her &amp; nursed
her back to health, I would estimate her to be around 9 months to a year
old at the time......</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time Fritzy had to be put down, Lady, as we
called her... had settled in nicely and was gaining weight and her coat
was beginning to shine with the daily care she was getting......although
we noticed she was a very nervous dog, we put this down to the ill treatment
she had suffered before we found her.....</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a long garden by average British standards
which I have landscaped over the years, it is 80 feet long by 30 feet wide,
and I have it in 3 separate sections with a greenhouse and all that goes
with that near the house, then 2 sunken lawns and raised flower beds in
the centre section, leading to a circle of trees down the bottom, in the
centre of which I have a Koi pond some 23 feet by 12 feet.... at the far
side of the pond there is a waterfall, a double garden seat where I would
sit with my dogs in the evening on returning from work, Fritzy had this
habit of putting his fore paws on my thighs and licking my face, before
settling himself down comfortably at my side...to the rear of the seat
a tall privet [10'] hedge borders a public foot path, at the other side
of this is the Derbyshire countryside, with remnants of the old Sherwood
Forest [Robin Hoods home] about a 1000 yds from the bottom of our garden..</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Lady and I were down by the pond with a sandwich and a cup
of coffee after I came home from work a week or so after Fritzy went...
when all of a sudden, Lady's coat bristled, and she went absolutely berserk,
barking and growling, frothing at the mouth and she seemed to be looking
at a spot with some determination to the side of the pond where the path
around it was situated.. I looked, but could see nothing... but she had
her eye's fixed on something, and as I said, she was going absolutely berserk.....suddenly,
she backed up across the front of me and lay down, still barking and growling,
and still, there was nothing to see.......then I felt this heavy pressure
on my thighs and a warm, wet tongue on my cheek...then the pressure went
and Lady immediately calmed down.... I was quite shaken by this event......it
happened the once and then all was peaceful as though nothing had happened,
Lady wasn't even shaking as I stroked her thinking to calm her down...
there didn't seem to be any need to do that, as the pressure on my legs
diminished, so she calmed down completely..........as though nothing at
all had happened....I touched my cheek, and it was still wet..</B>

<P><B>. An Experience</B>

<P><B>By: mammak6@bellsouth.net</B>

<P><B>Hi , my name is Andrea and i have a little story to tell. My grandmother
and grandfather owned some property in a small town in Tennessee. I was
rasied there untill i was15. The next door neighbors whose property boardered
my grandmothers, was always like grandparents to me I spent holidays in
their home and stayed with them very often even living with them for a
while at one point. They had bulit the home themselves doing all the work
while my grandmother and her husband helped. The story goes that my grandmother
and the neighbor had an affair and my mother was the product of that affair.
I often wondered growing up why they were so good to us and know I guess
I know why. My grandmother denied this but he said it was the truth and
begged me to tell her to tell the truth so my mother would know it was
true . The ol gent live a great 93 years , my grandmother passed away before
him , never telling the truth. He asked me on his death bed to take&nbsp;
care of his wife they never had kids together and I was all they had. I
agreed&nbsp; of course because I loved them both so much&nbsp; and they
had been&nbsp; there for me all my life. After his death his wife couldnt
live in the house anymore so we bought the home from her . Me, my husband
and 4 children moved here almost 2 years ago . I love this house and I
feel very at home here . I have been in this house all my life. Since we
have moved in I have had a couple of experinces. One night after the kids
had gone to sleep my husband and i were up watching T.V. when I had gotten
up and gone into the bed room and he was in the kitchen. As I walked out
of the bed room I felt this feeling I dont know how to describe it really
but as I reached the kitchen I saw out of the corner of my eye this tall
black shadow move from behind me like it was following me and it turned
to go into the hall as I went strait into the kitchen. I just stopped and
stood frozen for a second as I got this huge chill run all through my body
I visably shook and my husband seeing me shake he also got a cold chill
and shook he looked at me puzzled and asked "what ?" , I told him what
I had seen and we just got quiet for a minute and then continued our evening
not givivng it to much more thought. Then once when I was in the shower
washing my hair I had both hands above my head and my eyes closed when
I felt two fingers sweep around my shoulder blade I let out a little screach
and turned to see my husband who was obviously playing a trick on me but
when I turned around there was no one there I looked outside the shower
curtian and no one was in the bathroom at all . When I finished my shower
I asked my husband if he had been sneaking around in the bathroom trying
to scare me . He had no clue what I was even talking about . I belive this
is the spirit of my real grandfather the man who bulit this home . I think
he is pleased with the changes that we have made here and that I am taking
care of his wife. I have had some experinces in the past but none like
this . I actually felt two fingers I know thats what it was . I was kinda
creeped out for the fact I was in the shower naked and thats not where
any one wants to experince things like this I would imagine. But I am not
afraid at all if it is him or my grandmother then I know they mean me no
harm just checking on me and the kids&nbsp; I guess . I love your web site
and I just wanted to share to be a part of it .</B>

<BR><B>A Midnight Walk</B>

<P><B>By: gwhite1@adelphia.net</B>

<P><B>I am a 13 year old girl, from Whitesboro New York. I have always
believed in paranormal stuff. One summer night, my best friend and I were
at our friends house a few blocks away from ours. It was about midnight
when we decided to head home. When we had gotten to the corner of the street
we noticed a white shinning figure (it had no face at all) walking toward
us. We ran back to our friends house screaming. We made them walk us home,
when we got to that same corner like 2 minutes later it was gone. It was
said that there had been ghost hauntings here before but no one ever believed
it. Now we do. Of course the guys think were crazy but I don't care because,
one other night at my house around midnight also, I was taking a walk by
my self and I saw the same white figure only he was holding something...
the next day I went out side to where he was walking and saw a piece of
paper with symbols written on it. I never found out what they meant I did
as much research as I could but I found nothing on it.</B>

<P><B>A Ghost Story?</B>

<P><B>By: babiedink@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>Hi. First of all I would like to say that I have had</B>
<BR><B>very few encounters with anything unhuman...if it was</B>
<BR><B>unhuman. But this all happened when I lived in another</B>
<BR><B>house a few cities away about 3 years ago. Since then,</B>
<BR><B>nothing has happened to me.</B>
<BR><B>Well, when we first moved into my old house about 10</B>
<BR><B>years ago, we could never get the back bedroom warm,</B>
<BR><B>which unfortunately was my older sister and mine's</B>
<BR><B>bedroom.&nbsp; My sister used to complain about me walking</B>
<BR><B>past her in the middle of the night, but I never had,</B>
<BR><B>she also saw cats...she says 5 of them but Im not</B>
<BR><B>sure...running around in our room all of the time.</B>
<BR><B>Then, we both got our own room when our parents added</B>
<BR><B>on to the house.&nbsp; My sister still said that I came in</B>
<BR><B>her room in the middle of the night and paced in front</B>
<BR><B>of her bed.</B>
<BR><B>Now, right before we moved out of the house, I spent</B>
<BR><B>the night in my sisters room because I was sick and my</B>
<BR><B>other sister was home for a week and she was staying</B>
<BR><B>with us.&nbsp; I was laying on my sisters bed with my head</B>
<BR><B>in Sara's (the sister home for a week) lap and she was</B>
<BR><B>playing with my hair.&nbsp; I closed my eyes for what</B>
<BR><B>seemed like a few seconds to me and when I opened them</B>
<BR><B>again, Sara was standing beside me.&nbsp; I still felt</B>
<BR><B>someone underneath my head playing with my hair.&nbsp; Sara</B>
<BR><B>said she could see an older woman dressed in a white</B>
<BR><B>gown as if she was wanting to go to sleep.&nbsp; She also</B>
<BR><B>said that the woman was looking at me as if I was her</B>
<BR><B>child and singing to me.&nbsp; Now, I couldnt hear her</B>
<BR><B>singing at the time, but ever since then, when I am</B>
<BR><B>sick I have a strange tune stuck in my head and I know</B>
<BR><B>that I've not heard it from anywhere recently.</B>
<BR><B>My mother and father always got up and checked on us</B>
<BR><B>in the middle of the night because they would hear</B>
<BR><B>pots and pans rattling like someone was looking for</B>
<BR><B>something to cook with.&nbsp; Things sometimes came up</B>
<BR><B>missing and were found in another room, the doorknobs</B>
<BR><B>turned but the door never opened and no one was</B>
<BR><B>outside in the middle of the day.&nbsp; Can anyone explain</B>
<BR><B>these things?&nbsp; My dad named whatever it was that moved</B>
<BR><B>things and turned knobs "Fred".&nbsp; I've never been</B>
<BR><B>afraid of whatever it was and its never done anything</B>
<BR><B>harmful.&nbsp; Its always a cold but comforting feeling</B>
<BR><B>when something was about to happen.</B>

<BR><B>A Couple of Ghost Stories</B>

<P><B>By: one_eyed_bassethound@hotmail.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Hey Guys, I love your site.&nbsp; Just wanted to add a couple of
family ghost</B>
<BR><B>stories for your collection.&nbsp; Which I presume are true because
they have</B>
<BR><B>come from my dad and my aunt straight to me, because they know I
have an</B>
<BR><B>interest about this stuff.</B>
<BR><B>The first one concerns my dad, when he was ten his mother(my grandmother)</B>
<BR><B>passed away.&nbsp; He says that about a week after he died he distinctly</B>
<BR><B>remembers waking up in the middle of the night, with the feeling
my</B>
<BR><B>grandmother was in the room.&nbsp; He said he didn't feel scared
or anything just</B>
<BR><B>felt really calm.</B>
<BR><B>The other story I have to tell you involves the Royal Roads University
in</B>
<BR><B>Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.&nbsp; A brief history is it
was built by a</B>
<BR><B>former Governer of British Columbia who owned a couple of coal mines.&nbsp;
His</B>
<BR><B>son however died during the first World War.&nbsp; During the Second
World War it</B>
<BR><B>was used as a military barracks,&nbsp; this is when the first reports
of it being</B>
<BR><B>haunted started coming in.&nbsp; Two stories here are that the wife
searched</B>
<BR><B>among the young soldiers for her lost son, one soldier said he remembered</B>
<BR><B>waking up with a "very old" women pulling his blanket off him.&nbsp;
The other</B>
<BR><B>story is at times even to modern times the lost son's favorite song
has been</B>
<BR><B>heard playing in the building(My aunt has witnessed this.)&nbsp;
The building is</B>
<BR><B>now a Public University which my Aunt works at.&nbsp; She was walking
through the</B>
<BR><B>building one day at work when one of the hidden doors(the building
has many)</B>
<BR><B>opened when she was beside it and a cold gust blew out of the opening.&nbsp;
She</B>
<BR><B>looked at the door thinking that the wind just blew it open but
the door</B>
<BR><B>opened AGAINST the wind.&nbsp; In other words the door opened away
from my aunt,</B>
<BR><B>but the wind blew towards her.&nbsp; I've been in the building myself
but haven't</B>
<BR><B>felt anything strange.&nbsp; It's quite an interesting house to
look through and</B>
<BR><B>the history is very interesting.</B>

<BR><B>A Bed &amp; Breakfast Haunting in New Bedford, MA</B>

<P><B>By:rrothmann@earthlink.net</B>

<P><B>This past Memorial Day weekend, our family spent a nice mini-vacation
in a beautiful, Georgian Revival mansion in New Bedford, MA.&nbsp; New
Bedford was (and is still) known as the capital city of the 19th century
Yankee whaling industry.&nbsp; Since my husband has always been fascinated
with this era, we frequently vacation in the New Bedord/Cape Cod/Nantucket
area.&nbsp; Bobby always likes to buy books and souvenirs that have to
do with whaling and New England life.&nbsp; Now to get to the point.</B>
<BR><B>Let me emphasize that I have always been fascinated with the paranormal
but Bobby (my hubby) scoffed at anything that had to do with the "unexplainable."&nbsp;
He would dismiss the paranormal as "mumbo-jumbo."&nbsp; I would&nbsp; sometimes
get frustrated when he would poke fun at anyone who had witnessed or gone
through something weird.&nbsp; We have been married for over 15 years,
and I used to tell him some old stories my grandfather shared with me from
his boyhood.&nbsp; I was totally convinced that there were members in my
family who had some kind of "gift" to see the future in dreams.&nbsp; Sometimes
they would see the departure of loved ones before the news got to them
by phone or by word of mouth.&nbsp; Try sharing these experiences with
a person who doesn't believe and all you get is humiliation.&nbsp; One
day I told Bobby, "Just wait and see.&nbsp; It will happen to you, and
I hope it does so you'll know how it feels when someone makes fun of you!"&nbsp;
He responded with "Yeah, yeah, yeah."</B>
<BR><B>As I said, we rented a suite in this gorgeous house that had once
belonged to a whaling captain.&nbsp; We were particularly pleased because,
for once, we had our own bedroom and our two daughters had their own as
well.&nbsp; It was located on Orchard Street, but I'll refrain from mentioning
the name of the house.&nbsp; Traffic getting out of New York had been especially
slow, and we arrived late Friday evening.&nbsp; The cordial and friendly
owner showed us our rooms.&nbsp; The only thing I found unusual about the
house was that we were given keys to every room in the suite and we had
to lock our doors from the "inside" for privacy.&nbsp; The keys had that
typical "skeleton key"&nbsp; look.&nbsp; The house was immaculate, beautiful
and impressive with pictures of exotic places and ships.&nbsp; Anyway,
that first night I slept like a baby.&nbsp; On Saturday morning, as we
were preparing to have a continental breakfast in the downstairs dining
room, Bobby complained that he was very annoyed at hearing the dragging
of very heavy furniture during the night - at around 2:15 a.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I believed him because he always sleeps with his watch on when we go on
vacation.&nbsp; Bobby couldn't tell in what area of the house the dragging
took place, but he was convinced that whoever was doing this was very rude
and inconsiderate.&nbsp; I asked him how long the noise had lasted and
he said that it had gone on from 15 to 20 minutes.&nbsp; The owner, who
sleeps in a restored carriage house across the yard from the main house,
was flabbergasted.&nbsp; There were about five guests in the dining room
and they denied making noise of any kind nor hearing anything.&nbsp; There
were two exceptions:&nbsp; my oldest daughter heard the noise, and one
child guest, a boy, said he heard a heavy chest being dragged across the
floor.&nbsp; So Bobby wasn't alone experiencing the incident.&nbsp; We
all forgot about it as we were enjoying the rest of our vacation.</B>
<BR><B>Two evenings later, after returning to the house from one of our
excursions, I was using a bathroom that was located between the two bedrooms
(ours and our daughters').&nbsp; The doorknob started rattling and I thought
it was my youngest daughter .&nbsp; I yelled that I was finished as I was
drying my hands and immediately opened the door.&nbsp; There was no one
there and I heard the children's and my husband's voices in the downstairs
dining room. I felt this adrenaline rush and tried to dismiss the weird
feeling that came over me.&nbsp; The icing on the cake comes next.</B>
<BR><B>It was Memorial Day evening.&nbsp; Bobby and I were trying to decide
whether to pack late at night or first thing in the morning, since we were
checking out at 11 a.m.&nbsp; I told him let's have a cocktail to relax
and then we'll decide what to do later on.&nbsp; Our daugthers were in
the T.V. room, which was next to our master bedroom.&nbsp; My husband decided
to take a long, leisurely shower.&nbsp; Now here are the details to the
layout of our suite.&nbsp; Our bedroom opened onto a very large bathroom
containing an all-glass shower stall and a jacuzzi.&nbsp; A door at the
other end of this room led to a tiny room containing a toilet and sink
(this was the room in which I had experienced the door-rattling incident).&nbsp;
This little water closet room could be approached from either the shower
area or from a door that led to the girls' bedroom which, however, we kept
locked, with the key in the keyhole.</B>
<BR><B>Before my husband turned on the shower, he made sure that the little
room containing the toilet was locked so that no one could enter from the
girls' bedroom.&nbsp; He also turned out the light and closed the water
closet door as he entered the shower room.&nbsp; Now, I was lying on the
bed having my drink and reading a book. Both girls were in the adjacent
T.V. room.&nbsp; After awhile, my oldest daughter said she didn't want
to sleep in her room and could she crash here with me alongside her younger
sister (who was already sleeping next to me).&nbsp; Before we knew it,
we were all three asleep.</B>
<BR><B>All of a sudden my husband wakes me up.&nbsp; I was a little startled
because he looked slightly agitated and he insisted on showing me something.&nbsp;
I caught this horrible wave of nausea as I was rising from the bed.&nbsp;
First he asked me if any of the girls had attempted to go to the bathroom
while he had been showering.&nbsp; I told him that the girls had never
left my side.&nbsp; When I made it clear that both girls had been with
me all along, he said the oddest thing had happened.&nbsp; Before getting
into the shower, he decided to light the scented candles that were placed
alongside the jacuzzi.&nbsp; He had been showering in the dark, enjoying
the glow and scent of the candles when a sudden&nbsp; flood of light illuminated
the room.&nbsp; When he whirled around to see where the light was coming
from, he saw the private bathroom door open, and he noticed that the light
(which he had turned off before going to the shower room) was on.&nbsp;
When he tried to focus to see if it was one of the girls, the door slammed
shut.&nbsp; He said it was as if someone had accidentally walked into an
occupied bathroom and shut the door in embarrassment.&nbsp; When he got
out of the shower, he immediately went into the water closet room from
which the light had emanated.&nbsp; He found it&nbsp; just as he had left
it:&nbsp; locked, with the key in the keyhole, and dark.&nbsp; In other
words, someone had entered a locked bathroom door, turned on the light,
opened the door that led to the shower room, then slammed it shut.&nbsp;
Oddly, the incident had not scared or spooked him as it was taking place,
as his initial reaction was to think that one of his daughters was trying
to get into the shower room from their bedroom.&nbsp; However, when he
realized that no one could have entered from the girls' bedroom because
that door was locked and besides, they were both sleeping in our bedroom,
he was totally stupefied.&nbsp; How could anyone have gone through a locked
door?!&nbsp; Especially one that had the key in the keyhole, so that no
key could have been inserted into the lock from the outside.&nbsp; (I forgot
to mention that we had the house to ourselves since all of the guests had
checked out.)</B>
<BR><B>My husband reluctantly had to admit that he experienced something
paranormal.&nbsp; After relaying these strange events to the owner, he
did admit that a previous owner, who happened to be an architect, sent
him an email wanting to know if the owner's guests were aware of the manifestations
of a child ghost.&nbsp; At first we thought the owner was kidding us.&nbsp;
He then elaborated that before the architect purchased the house, it was
once owned by prominent family with a well known name.&nbsp; They had something
to do with stainglass or something like that.&nbsp; Apparently a little
girl, I believe she was 7 years old died of a sickness on Christmas Eve.&nbsp;&nbsp;
There have been guests who witnessed seeing a child run right through a
wall.&nbsp; Now my husband is among the believers even though it still
disturbs him to this very day!.&nbsp; As Catholics, we were to believe
that once you die, you go somewhere else.&nbsp; You don't remain earthbound.&nbsp;
My question is:&nbsp; How can a child remain earthbound when he or she
dies?&nbsp; Why isn't the soul taken to the afterlife or heaven?</B>
<BR><B>Well. that is all I have to say about that and I'm glad that my
husband finally experienced the "unexplainable".</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for listening...</B>

<P><B>my family used to live in a house in city point, va. this is rumored

the two story house burnt down. they rebuilt upon what could be salvaged.
years later my brother moved into the house, and reported hearing strange
sounds, as if someone was going through boxes stored under the steps leading
upstairs. on several occasions he claimed to have seen the image of a young
girl in the house, but on each occasion, she would dissappear shortly after
being seen. as far as we know, she still occupies the house, though we

i could not make out a face, but the body was very clear. the figure then
slowly turned around and went through the door, which i have already stated,

<P><B>At about 1:00am in february of 1996 I was sitting in bed, reading,
when i got this really cold feeling and it made my neck hairs stick up,
whilst at the same time painful shivers were running down my spine.</B>
<BR><B>My door started opening I thought it was my mum so i walked to the
door, nobody was there I shut the door and locked it.</B>
<BR><B>I went back to sleep.I was then awoken by my TV on full volume,
that had to be turned on by hand (Because the remote was broke).I got up
&amp; turned it off I went to sleep thinking nothing of it.</B>
<BR><B>A few days later I told my sister what happened, she said she didnt
hear my TV even though her room is right next to mine.</B>
<BR><B>After a few weeks I forgot about the incident until I was awoken
by a loud scream that sounded like my mum, I ran up the hallway I looked
in my mums room she was sound asleep (the time was about 2:12am) I ran
to my sisters room and she was also asleep.I was shivering again so I ran
back to my room locked the door and curled up into a ball.</B>
<BR><B>Later there was another scream which was louder, whilst mid-way
through it just halted.</B>
<BR><B>I got up and found my door wide open, there was a white figure standing
there holding a triangular object in its hand.The figure had a huge grin
on its face that I could hardly make out.</B>
<BR><B>I stood there frozen with fear, then the figure disappeared.</B>

when my</B>
<BR><B>ex-husband and I were passing through Redmond a couple of years

I</B>
<BR><B>experienced something there. Although we had no idea of the history
of the</B>
<BR><B>hotel, I awoke in the middle of the night, keenly aware of a presence
in the</B>
<BR><B>room with us. Somehow, I knew that it was the presence of a woman.
Although</B>
<BR><B>I have never really gotten too bothered about the paranormal because
of my</B>

my then</B>

we slept</B>

we</B>

<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Dear Shadowlands,</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a ghost story
to tell you</B>
<BR><B>and it happened in broad daylight. I</B>
<BR><B>have always believed in ghosts since</B>
<BR><B>I was fifteen but thats another story</B>
<BR><B>I'll tell later.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This story takes place in Spokane</B>
<BR><B>Washington and in the morning,no less.</B>
<BR><B>My husband and I drove to Spokane</B>
<BR><B>one morning from Kennewick,Wa. to</B>
<BR><B>have a new windshield placed in our car.We arrived around 8 a.m.
and</B>
<BR><B>left the car at repair shop and as it</B>
<BR><B>was going to take an hour for them</B>
<BR><B>to install the windshield,we decided to walk down the street to
a cafe and</B>
<BR><B>have coffee while we waited.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As there wasn't a sidewalk on</B>
<BR><B>the right side of the street that the repair shop was on ,we crossed
over to the left side.We were walking with the flow of the traffic and
there were a steady stream of cars passing us</B>
<BR><B>as we walked. It was an ordinary</B>
<BR><B>sidewalk,and it was sort of a cool day</B>
<BR><B>with an overcast sky.It was a narrow sidewalk so i was walking in
front of</B>
<BR><B>my husband.There was the open high</B>
<BR><B>way on the left side of us and a fence</B>
<BR><B>on the right side with homes behind</B>
<BR><B>the fence. My husband has a bad knee</B>
<BR><B>so we were walking pretty slow be</B>
<BR><B>cause he would have to stop to rest</B>
<BR><B>every little ways.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We both saw the woman coming</B>
<BR><B>down the sidewalk behind my husband</B>
<BR><B>and in just a moment she had caught</B>
<BR><B>up with us.She passed my husband</B>
<BR><B>without saying anything and I was walking along and she came up
even with me,close enough to touch,smiled,</B>
<BR><B>and said,"I hope I didn't startle you".</B>
<BR><B>She was dressed in a bright blue</B>
<BR><B>cardigan sweater over a blouse and</B>
<BR><B>blue slacks,white tennis shoes.She</B>
<BR><B>was an older lady,around 60 years old</B>
<BR><B>with short grey,curly hair.She seem</B>
<BR><B>ed real pleasant and she then was right</B>
<BR><B>in front of me,walking ahead.I had my</B>
<BR><B>eyes on her the whole time.I thought</B>
<BR><B>she was a lady out for her morning stroll.We walked along for a
few minutes,and I saw a beautiful flower growing in the yard we were passing.</B>
<BR><B>I spoke to my husband about the flower,just glancing away for a
second.</B>
<BR><B>I looked back and she was gone.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wasn't crossing the street</B>
<BR><B>because it was full of cars,and there wasn't time for her to go
into a house</B>
<BR><B>we were passing because most of the lanes up to the houses were
long and</B>
<BR><B>she would have been seen walking to</B>
<BR><B>them but she was nowhere.My hus-</B>
<BR><B>band exclaimed at the same time.We</B>
<BR><B>looked and looked but she wasn't there.For a few minutes we thought</B>
<BR><B>our minds were playing tricks on us</B>
<BR><B>but we knew what we saw.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We walked on to the cafe and</B>
<BR><B>told the waitress but she just laughed</B>
<BR><B>probably not believing us. I don't know</B>
<BR><B>what it was but we'll never forget</B>
<BR><B>it. It was the strangest thing we had</B>

<P><B>Gizmo</B>

<P><B>By: Lee_Cromer@Trimble.com</B>

<P><B>Hi,</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; My name is Lee Cromer and I wanted to tell you about my Siamese
Cat Gizmo.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I'd gotten Gizmo in September of 1984 as a kitten and she
was the best cat I'd ever had.&nbsp; She would always sleep under the covers
curled up at my stomach and was very affectionate unlike the stories I'd
always heard about Siamese Cats.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Anyway she lived a long life for a cat.&nbsp; We had to have
her put to sleep for health problems it was 4 years ago.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Giz would always jump up on the dresser in our bedroom to
chew on the silk flower arrangement I had up there.&nbsp; One night about
a month or so after she was gone,&nbsp; I felt her jump on the bed and
then heard her jump over to the dresser and start nibbling on the silk
plant.&nbsp; She woke me up every time she did this and I'd always say
her name to get her to stop.&nbsp; This particular night was no different,&nbsp;
except she'd been gone for a month.&nbsp; I told my husband about it the
next day thinking I had maybe just dreamed it and then he proceeded to
tell me that a few nights before this happened to me he was sitting in
the living room watching tv and she trotted through like she was going
to go get something to eat or drink.&nbsp; He saw her a couple of nights
in a row.&nbsp; After my incident we didn't see her anymore.&nbsp; I actually
didn't see her like he did,&nbsp; I just felt her presence and heard the
noises she was making.</B>

<P><B>Glensax , Adross , Scotland</B>

<P><B>By: Billabongburba@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Around about the 1850's&nbsp; our house lay within the boundaries
of the Ardross Castle grounds, and was used as the school for children
in the surrounding area.&nbsp; the main part of the house was the residence
of the teacher, and the 'newer' part was used as the school room. i say
'newer' because the school room would have originally been one big room
all the way to the rafters, but it was section off into living quarters
in the mid twentieth century. Adjoining our house is a smaller cottage
which was the nurses living quarters. (the land owned by the castle has
now severely diminished and is only about 1/8&nbsp; of what it used to
be.)</B>

<P><B>the main bulk of paranormal activity has taken place in the older
part of the building - 'the teachers quarters'.&nbsp; without the newer
living areas, the house would have consisted of;&nbsp; downstairs -&nbsp;
2 rooms sizeable enough to be used as a sitting room &amp; study, a kitchen,
a corridor connecting all the downstairs rooms and a front hallwhere the
stairs begin. the upstairs - landing, two bedrooms, and a large room of
which may have been used for anything.&nbsp; the toilets were in a shed
outside, which is now used as a toolshed (lovely eh?).&nbsp; Having redecorated
the house several times it is obvious to see that everyroom had a fireplace.
in the schoolroom there is an enormous fireplace.</B>

<P><B>when we first moved in my brother experienced sightings of a tall
figure moving around the large room upstairs.&nbsp; within the first week
of unpacking every family member had experienced somesort of spectre (
i cant remember as i was only 9 months old). the 'most haunted' areas are
the spare bedroom and the front hall.</B>
<BR><B>the spare bedroom -&nbsp; the door has always been hard work to
open, as the top snags. anyway - one night when my uncle and aunt were
staying over for a while, my uncle was getting undressed. my aunt had already
fallen asleep so he didnt turn the lights on.&nbsp; in the pitch black
( which noway i would have been able to cope with) he was pacing around
getting ready for bed , when he heard the door open and then close. (bear
in mind the snagging corner..) normally my uncle would have shaken it off
but he was terrified - and this is a cynical middle-aged burly Irishman.
he wont stay in that room anymore. it has always had a bizarre feeling
to it.</B>
<BR><B>i myself have experienced many weird sightings. i have woken in
the middle of the night to see a small child standing at my door, and a
tall figure looking out of my window. when i was&nbsp; around the age of
5 i was kept awake for what seemed hours by the movement of things on my
shelves and chest-of-drwaers. i was awoken by something falling to the
floor, then the sound of someone pushing things to one side. i screamed
for my mum as i could not get to a light without leaving my bed. when she
came she turned on my main light and almost instantly the noises stopped.
i told her what i had heard and she simply told the naive little 5yr old
that it was mice. leaving she turned off the light and shut the door again.
then slowly but surely the clicks, bangs and scrapings started up again.
i told my self it was just the mice walking around but i screamed for mum
again anyway.&nbsp; when she came through the same thing happened - the
light went on they stopped. and no sign of mice. this time she left the
light on foi have also seen a dark figure standing in the middle of my
room, and one standing at the bottom of the stairs. my mother has seen
figures and animals moving through the rooms and corridors.</B>
<BR><B>in the newer part of the house my brother has seen a man in blue
walking across the back yard and into the back door, from the kitchen window.</B>
<BR><B>as recently as this summer (2002) my brother and wife were getting
married, and we were holding a big party celebration at our house. one
of my brothers friends was in the room, where the back door is, getting
some drinks from the fridge, when she felt something brush past her, she
turned around and caught a glimpse of a white figure. the only white figure
i have ever seen in the house was the small child at my door.&nbsp; in
that room (which we call the flat kitchen) both my mother and i have seen
a figure in black standing just inside the doorway.</B>
<BR><B>we call it the 'flat' kitchen as this is the old school room which
has been sectioned off. in the 60s and 70s it was used as separate accommodation
rented out to the sons of the people staying in the main part of the house.&nbsp;
the original kitchen units are still in the 'kitchen' but we only use that
room as a sort of DIY area, so we have no real need to do it up.</B>
<BR><B>all in all our house is fairly 'active'. most of the time the activity
doesn't have a threatening feeling to it, but there have been 2 or 3 times
when i have felt uneasy.&nbsp; i dot think i could handle the intensity
of an exorcism - plus, i dot really feel the need for one at the moment.</B>
<BR><B>i hope this has been of some interest to you.</B>
<BR><B>(i would love to find out more about my house and area - so in the
rare chance that somebody reading this knows anything then please email
me at cottonBerol@aol.com)</B>

<BR><B>Heres One For You</B>

<P><B>By: EffusiveMusic@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Well, I have always had vivid dreams that seem almost real. I remember
that I was having a dream that I was at my mothers friends house and they
were having lunch. I went into the restroom and looked into this mirror,
but my reflection was a man. He was dressed in sack cloth and his eyes
were withdrawn yet full of life. He told me that he was looking for my
mother. I told him that she was in the living room but he didn't seem to
hear me.</B>
<BR><B>He said "You have to tell your mother to help me"</B>
<BR><B>I realized that was dreaming and said to him "How should I tell
her, who are you?"</B>
<BR><B>He said "I can't tell you my real name because then I can't come
back and talk to you, just tell her that My name is LEAF."</B>
<BR><B>I woke up and thought nothing about it but the dream had left me
with an eerie feeling not easily shrugged off. When I went to sleep the
next night he was there again.</B>
<BR><B>He asked "Did you tell her?"</B>
<BR><B>I said "No I didn't she will think I am crazy"</B>
<BR><B>I guess I realized again that I was dreaming.</B>
<BR><B>"He said you have to tell her I need her help, my name is LEAF,
don't forget!"</B>
<BR><B>The message seemed really urgent this time. When I woke I told my
mother about my dream but she didn't seem to recognize the name LEAF or
the description I had given her. I decided I must have simply had a strange
dream and left it at that.</B>
<BR><B>One week later my mother received a call from her friends mother.
Her friend had fallen into a comma and had been calling her name. He unfortunately
died in his comma 3 nights before. His mother was not sure how to get hold
of mine until she saw someone who had contact with her. It was strange
to say the least. It wasn't a ghost in chains but it was definitely an
experience.</B>

<P><B>Ghosts on a First Hand Basis</B>

<P><B>By: Jaderaptor@aol.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, I have just
found your site and i must say that i am in love. I too have encountered
ghosts first hand. Let me tell you a few of my experiences from when i
was a child.&nbsp; Between the ages of 4 and 9ish, we used to live in an
old victorian home.&nbsp; Close to the industrial sector of town, it was
granted that it would have alot of history behind it.&nbsp; From what me
and my family infer, we know somewhere between 3 or 4 ghosts inhabit the
house.&nbsp; I shared a room with my younger brother.&nbsp; I was rather
large and we had a bunk bed nearly tucked against the wall.&nbsp; Since
we moved in, I can remember hearing the stairs creak, one by one, as if
someone had steped on them. It would begin at the bottom and slowly make
it to the top. Then I could feel the presence of someone standing at the
bed's side, watching me.&nbsp; At times i swore i could hear and feel their
breaths. Then after a few minutes, the whole process would start over and
repeat..&amp;nb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We looked
up the history of the house at the library and found that a woman fell
to her death down the stairs. She was an elderly woman.&nbsp; As for the
other ghost, it was a child who was accidently killed by his sibling while
they played with thier father's gun.</B>
<BR><B>I have many more stories to tell of that house. E-mail me if you
want them</B>

blood red color) well we moved in early 1991 my parents fell in love with
it...it was oroginaly a full size house built in 1904 it was than converted
into a dupex later on (im not sure of the date) the house ha beautiful
high faulted cilings with beautiful floor to ceiling windows hard wood
floors very spacious place......only 2 bad things about the house was 1
the cellar looked like a dungeon because it was never re-done and very
creepy i might 2 the attack was the same exact way just wood in stead of
old moldy green colored rocks like the cellar but you see when my parents
first went and looked at the house they dident explore the attack or td
from our house thats when it all started!!!!!!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

stumbled across the same thing my mother and father did that casket!!!!
and instead of having it removed they desided to move out of that place
.....and my mom couldnetfind out who lived there b4 them because the owner
of the duplex wouldent give them any info...and my mom asked the owner
if he knew anout the caket and he swore he didet my mom believed him.......</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
about 2 weeks after the casket was removed fromo ur attack odd things started
happining around our home ....my mom was wakin up in the middle if the
night to whispers but shed wake up and shed look around the house and everyone
was sound asleep.....but the thing that really moved her was one morning
she woke up for work at 4am to be there early for she had things hse had
to do.....well she did her regular thing...woke up made coffee and sat
at the kitchen table drinking her coffee she was faceing the backwindow
and she saw a shadow go past so she got up and wet into the still dark
living roomand she heard the whispers again&nbsp; she walked in instead
of standin inthe door way and out of the corner of her right eye she thought
she saw someone sitting in our reclyer chair thinking it was my father
just sittin there she looked over but it was this little old lady my mom
said hello and the lady just went up in a clourd u guy .......well needless

<P><B>Old Abandoned House</B>

<P><B>By: palmerhill@cybersouth.com</B>

<P><B>Back in August, I was walking around where I live at now.&nbsp; I
went to this old abandoned house.&nbsp; I didn't think of anything whenever
walked in.&nbsp; All the sudden I felt a cold breeze come across my neck.&nbsp;
All&nbsp; the sudden the hair on my arms stood straight up.&nbsp; I kept
on walking through the house though ( Keep in mind this house was built
in the early 1800's, and has been abandoned since October of 1995.)&nbsp;
It was about 3 minutes later that I heard somebody walking and talking.&nbsp;
I thought about running out of the house, but stupid me I stay and figure
out what the hell is going on.&nbsp; I turned to the back side of the first
door and saw a shadow moving across the floor.&nbsp; I got so scared that
I stood their without making a single movement for at least 5 minutes.&nbsp;
After I set myself free of fear I started to move again.&nbsp; I saw three
women walk toward me and disappear.&nbsp; I started to run out and the
door slammed in my face.&nbsp; I tried to open the door but it wouldn't
budge.&nbsp; I yelled out for help, but none would answer.&nbsp; Then the
door opened I ran out, and the door slammed shut.&nbsp; They say that the
house been condemned, and none is allowed inside.&nbsp; The house is supposedly
haunted because three women and a man lived in the house,&nbsp; two women
were daughters, and the third was the mother.&nbsp; Their also was a man
which was the husband.&nbsp; They say that back in April, 19. 1872, the
man killed the three women and himself.&nbsp; The only reason that the
women are still in there, is because they are looking for the mothers deep
dark blue wedding stone.&nbsp; This is in ALAMO,GA</B>

<BR><B>My Terrible Experience</B>

<P><B>By: SMHoewing@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I have had quite a few weird experiences.&nbsp; Usually I try to
explain them away, but there are a few that just can't be explained as
a natural thing.&nbsp; I will tell you of the worst experience I've ever
had.</B>
<BR><B>My family likes to go to the graveyard late at night and take a
look around.&nbsp; We go usually after 10 at night and stay a couple of
hours.&nbsp; Sometimes we see different colored lights flickering about
or we'll see dark shadows lurking around us.&nbsp; None of this frightens
us.&nbsp; Next to the cemetary, there is another extremely old cemetary,
referred to as the " Preacher Part" because of all of the graves that hold
priests, nuns and the like.&nbsp; We never go there because of weird happenings
and strange feelings.</B>
<BR><B>One night my mother had my boyfriend and I listen to a tape her
friend had made in the Preacher Part the night before.&nbsp; There were
distinct sounds of children playing and women talking, which amazed us
because we could also hear the wind blowing.&nbsp; My mother suggested
we go that night to see if we could get a tape of noises.&nbsp; Not thinking
anything of it, we agreed.</B>
<BR><B>That night we got to the Preacher Part around 1 in the morning and
put a tape recorder on top of a tall headstone.&nbsp; My mother said some
things and we left.&nbsp; We planned on returning in an hour to retrieve
the recorder.</B>
<BR><B>When we returned, the temperature seemed to drop a lot event hough
it was in the middle of July and the night had been extremely hot.&nbsp;
We had a bit of trouble locating the tape recorder, even though the headstone
we picked was at the edge of the cemetary.&nbsp; When we did find it, it
was turned upside down and looked like it had been dropped onto the headstone.&nbsp;
Also, the wind seemed to pick up every time we shone our flashlight beem
on the headstone.&nbsp; My boyfriend picked up the recorder and we left.</B>
<BR><B>When we got home, we rewound the tape and listened to it.&nbsp;
For a good 20 minutes, there was absolutely no sound.&nbsp; Then there
was a strange tapping sound, like the recorder itself was being tapped
against the headstone.&nbsp; Then there was a scraping sound and a cough.&nbsp;
We got an impression that someone was playing with it, but had no idea
what it was.</B>
<BR><B>We listend on for about another 20 minutes until the tape made a
hissing sound.&nbsp; We fastforwarded it and heard nothing, like before.&nbsp;
All of a sudden a shriek came from the tape and more hissing sounds.&nbsp;
At first we thought the hissing sound came from the tape itself, not anything
put on it.&nbsp; Now we are convinced it was something else.</B>
<BR><B>We shut off the tape and went to bed.&nbsp; The next morning, I
brought the tape over to my friends' house.&nbsp; We replayed the whole
thing, but there wasn't a noise on it.&nbsp; Just the hissing noise that
usually signals there isn't anything on it.</B>
<BR><B>It sounds unbelieveable, but I swear it's all true.&nbsp; The freaky
thing about it is when we went back to make a new tape, there wasn't any
action going on for months until we just stopped going.&nbsp; We think
that something was warning us away or trying to get a message across.&nbsp;
We feel that in doing so, it was able to rest in peace.</B>

<BR><B>Weird Dreams</B>

<P><B>By: smart_azz@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>When I was younger, I used to have this weird dream about a girl
sitting alone in a room with this doll on the other side of the room. The
girl just sat staring at it, and it seemed like hours passed. I used to
have this dream all the time, however I didn't exactly think much of it.
Anyhow, when I turned about 12 (I am 14 now) we moved into this old house.
It was the first hospital of the town I lived in. However, I didn't find
this out until later. The house was very old and it had a weird passage
which lead into the attic. It hadn't been lived in for years so in the
attic we found lots of things you would find in a hospital. Since we were
only renting, we asked the owners about this and they told us not to mind
it, because it was once an old hospital. I was always interested in the
attic but I was never allowed to go into it, but whenever I could, I went
up there to investigate. One day, I was looking around when I found an
old black and white photograph of that same girl in my dream holding the
same doll. There were other photographs and many of which had that girl
in it, including the doll. I thought it was very creepy. About a week later,
I was alone in the house with my friend who was sleeping over. My parents
were at a friend's house. It was pretty late so we decided to make some
popcorn and watch a movie. I totally forgot that we still hadn't unpacked
the movies and they were upstairs in the attic. Since I really don't like
going up there at night, I told my friend we should just watch T.V but
she really wanted to watch House on Haunted Hill (she hadn't seen it yet
I decided to go up a grab it quickly. Once I got up there, I looked around
for the chain to pull the light on, even though it wouldn't make much difference.
I found the light and turned it on but when I looked around I couldn't
find the box with the movies. I finally found it but it was over by the
chimney. I went to grab the movie but all of a sudden I heard something
behind me so I looked and there was the little girl holding the doll but
she didn't exactly look the same, there was one difference in her eyes
and skin. Her skin was unnaturally pale and her eyes had blood around the
edges. It really freaked me out, so I ran for the stairs but when I did,
I tripped on something and I fell and it really hurt. My friend came and
helped me but when I tried to show her the girl but she was gone. At the
time, I hadn't realized it was the same girl in the photos and my dreams
but after I realized it. I had to get stitches by the way because when
I fell I cut my leg badly on a nail in the floor.</B>

<P><B>Our Haunted House in 1994</B>
<BR><B>By: Anita_Zompero@trihealth.com</B>

<P><B>I love the website and spend much time reading other's experiences.&nbsp;
I have</B>
<BR><B>read them all and come back each month for new stories.&nbsp; I
thought it was</B>
<BR><B>about time to submit my own.</B>
<BR><B>This occured in Cinti, Ohio over the course of two years from June
of 1994</B>
<BR><B>through June of 1996.&nbsp; I had just remarried and our new family
moved into</B>
<BR><B>this beautiful bi-level home.&nbsp; I came to the marriage with
3 children ages,</B>
<BR><B>13, 10 and 8.&nbsp; My husband had 1 son who was 4.</B>
<BR><B>This was a three bedroom home, so our sons shared a room and my
daughters</B>
<BR><B>the other.&nbsp; We were so excited about renting this house.&nbsp;
It was beautiful.</B>
<BR><B>It was layed out just like a typical bi-level, except for the Great
room,</B>
<BR><B>which was a step down from the kitchen or dining room.&nbsp; It
was very big with</B>
<BR><B>hardwood floors, cathederal ceilings and a wet bar.</B>
<BR><B>Downstairs there was another family room with a fireplace and a
big laundry</B>
<BR><B>room with alot of shelves that we stored all of the kids games on.&nbsp;
I always</B>
<BR><B>felt like I was not alone in the laundry room and found myself hurrying
to</B>
<BR><B>get out of there as quick as I could.</B>
<BR><B>The very first occurance happened maybe 2 days after we moved in.&nbsp;
My step</B>
<BR><B>son was back in his room playing with his toys.&nbsp; My husband
and I were in</B>
<BR><B>the living room.&nbsp; My children were with their father for the
weekend.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>step son came shooting down the hallway his eyes very wide and he
was a</B>
<BR><B>little pale.&nbsp; He was 4, he said "I don't want to play back
there anymore",</B>
<BR><B>"I said why not"?&nbsp; "He said they keep talking to me".&nbsp;
I said, "Who keeps</B>
<BR><B>taking to you"?&nbsp; He said, "the voices, they keep talking to
me and they</B>
<BR><B>won't stop.&nbsp; We did not know what to think of that.&nbsp; We
thought maybe he</B>
<BR><B>heard someone talking outside, but when we looked there was no one
around.</B>
<BR><B>At that time my husband worked nights and I would often be there
alone with</B>
<BR><B>the children.&nbsp; I was never really afraid, just uneasy.&nbsp;
I would at night</B>
<BR><B>always here footsteps.&nbsp; Of course I kept my bedroom door shut,
but I could</B>
<BR><B>still here them.&nbsp; Strange things would occur from time to time,
like we</B>
<BR><B>would turn off all the lights, ceiling fans etc, off before going
to bed.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning the ceiling fan in the living room would be going
full</B>
<BR><B>blast.&nbsp; This happend quite a few times.</B>
<BR><B>The event that really started me wondering was one day I was standing
at the</B>
<BR><B>stove cooking, to my left was the step down into the great room,
the patio</B>
<BR><B>doors that led outside to the backyard were on the same wall as
the stove.</B>
<BR><B>As I stood there I saw my 8 year old standing just inside the patio
doors,</B>
<BR><B>and I said, "Get cleaned up for dinner, it's almost ready".&nbsp;
No answer.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>looked over and no one was there.&nbsp; I went outside on the patio
and there was</B>
<BR><B>my 8 year old on a swing.&nbsp; She had never come in.&nbsp; I stood
there thinking</B>
<BR><B>about what I had seen.&nbsp; I saw a little girl the same height
as my daughter,</B>
<BR><B>with the same long hair to her waist, then I rememberd that she
had on a</B>
<BR><B>long old fashioned dress.&nbsp; To say the least I was spooked.&nbsp;
I later told my</B>
<BR><B>husband what I had seen, but we never told the kids as we didn't
want to</B>
<BR><B>frighten them.</B>
<BR><B>It was maybe a week or two later when my 8 year old came to me and
said,</B>
<BR><B>"Mom I was downstairs looking for a game to play and when I was
coming</B>
<BR><B>upstairs I saw a little girl standing by the fireplace.&nbsp; She
looked alot</B>
<BR><B>like me with long hair, but she had on a really long old fashioned
dress.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>kept looking at her and then she just disappeard.&nbsp; This really
freaked me</B>
<BR><B>out, since I had not mentioned to her what I had seen and she described
the</B>
<BR><B>little girl exactly as I had seen her.</B>
<BR><B>The next major thing to happen was during the day also, but this
time it</B>
<BR><B>happened to my husband "the skeptic".&nbsp; He was home during the
day as he had</B>
<BR><B>worked the previous night.&nbsp; I was at work and the kids were
at school.</B>
<BR><B>He was sitting in the dining room, (where we had our computer),
when he</B>
<BR><B>heard a noise in the basement/family room.&nbsp; It had a parkay
floor, no</B>
<BR><B>carpeting.&nbsp; He heard boxes being dropped and scooted, it sounded
like from</B>
<BR><B>one end of the room to the other.&nbsp; When the sound of scooting
stopped, he</B>
<BR><B>would hear another box being dropped.&nbsp; This went on for a min
or so.&nbsp; He was</B>
<BR><B>sure someone was in the family room.</B>
<BR><B>He went and got his pistol from the lockbox in our closet, loaded
it and</B>
<BR><B>chambered a bullet.&nbsp; That is how sure he was that there was
an intruder in</B>
<BR><B>our house.&nbsp; He continued to hear these boxes being dropped
and scooted as he</B>
<BR><B>crept down the steps to the family room.&nbsp; As soon as stepped
on the last</B>
<BR><B>step and stepped down to the parkay floor the noise stopped.&nbsp;
He crept</B>
<BR><B>around the corner knowing he was going to confront someone.&nbsp;
There was no</B>
<BR><B>one there.&nbsp; Not only was there no one there, but there were
no boxes to be</B>
<BR><B>found anywhere.&nbsp; He looked in our closet that had a lot of
storage under the</B>
<BR><B>stairs, and there were no boxes in there either.&nbsp; They had
all been emptied,</B>
<BR><B>broken down and stored flat against the wall.&nbsp; He searched
the entire house</B>
<BR><B>and of course found nothing.&nbsp; He was baffled to say the least.</B>
<BR><B>We all knew something else was living there with us.&nbsp; There
was alwasy a</B>
<BR><B>feeling of not being alone.&nbsp; It wasn't a scary or evil presence
at all, just</B>
<BR><B>kindof creepy.</B>
<BR><B>One other event that stands out in my mind is one evening, I was
alone, my</B>
<BR><B>kids in bed and my husband at work.&nbsp; My mother in law and a
friend of hers</B>
<BR><B>were up from Florida on vacation and staying with us.&nbsp; I was
sitting in the</B>
<BR><B>great room watching t.v.&nbsp; I was expecting my mother in law
and her friend</B>
<BR><B>home at any minuet.&nbsp; I heard the keys turn in the look and
footsteps coming</B>
<BR><B>up the stairs into the kitchen.&nbsp; Then I heard keys being laid
on the kitchen</B>
<BR><B>counter.&nbsp; I got up to greet them and when I stepped into the
kitchen it was</B>
<BR><B>empty.&nbsp; No keys on the counter, no one had come in.&nbsp; They
arrived about 10</B>
<BR><B>mins later.&nbsp; I was totally freaked.</B>
<BR><B>Many other small things happened.&nbsp; Anyone that spent the night
would hear</B>
<BR><B>footsteps throughout the night.&nbsp; My two sister in laws slept
in our living</B>
<BR><B>room one night in sleeping bags and the next morning they talked
about foot</B>
<BR><B>steps that traveled around their sleeping bags all night long.&nbsp;
Needless to</B>
<BR><B>say they would not spend the night any more.</B>
<BR><B>We moved from there in June of 1996.&nbsp; We are into our second
house since</B>
<BR><B>then and have never experienced anything like that again.&nbsp;
The man that</B>
<BR><B>rented the house to us passed away last year, and I didn't know
the</B>
<BR><B>neighbors that well to questions them.</B>
<BR><B>We were told that the previous owner before the man that rented
it to us was</B>
<BR><B>a physician.&nbsp; We always thought it strange that in&nbsp; the
back yard, we would</B>
<BR><B>find surgical gloves and scalples in the ground.&nbsp; We thought
maybe he used</B>
<BR><B>those items for gardening, who knows, it just seemed strange finding
those</B>
<BR><B>type of items outside in the backyard.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were also
told he had a young</B>
<BR><B>daughter because the man that rented us the house told all of the
games that</B>
<BR><B>were in our laundry room on shelves, the kids could have because
they were</B>
<BR><B>left here from the previous owner.&nbsp; I alwasy wondered of the
little girl</B>
<BR><B>died and was attached to the house for some reason.&nbsp; (I was
told that she</B>
<BR><B>had been ill, but I don't know if she was okay or not".</B>
<BR><B>We were sad when we moved from that house as it was so unique and
the first</B>
<BR><B>home we lived in as a new family, but I wasn't sad to leave the
strangeness</B>
<BR><B>behind!</B>
<BR><B>Sorry this has been so long and thanks for reading.</B>

<P><B>Poland Spring</B>

<P><B>By: wgnout@webtv.net</B>

<P><B>one of the places on you're Maine list is a place in Poland Spring.
the</B>
<BR><B>ghost of Hiram Ricker. not far from the Poland Spring Inn, down
a dirt</B>
<BR><B>road&nbsp; there are four cottages, these are rented out now to
guests of the</B>
<BR><B>Inn. back in the early 1970's we lived in the cottage now known
as the</B>
<BR><B>Hiram Ricker House. my mother, stepfather, and myself all had</B>
<BR><B>experiences in this house that were unexplainable, and scared the
shit</B>
<BR><B>out of us. to this day, my stepfather will not talk about what he
saw</B>
<BR><B>one night,while he was taking a bath. he ended up staying in the
tub all</B>
<BR><B>night because he was terrified to move! in my parents bedroom, someone</B>
<BR><B>had painted a beautiful angellic figure accross the ceiling, all
was</B>
<BR><B>beautiful except for a hideaous grinning face. no matter where you</B>
<BR><B>stood in the room its eyes were always looking at you. they painted
over</B>
<BR><B>it because it bothered us, it would wake theme up at night. they
tried</B>
<BR><B>several times to paint over it and it would still show through.
we all</B>
<BR><B>heard footsteps follow us, even sometmes when no one was home. it
would</B>
<BR><B>slam doors in the middle of the night. i would hear voices at night
and</B>
<BR><B>go wake up my mom because she had just been in my room and wanted</B>
<BR><B>something, so i thought! we only lived in that house for a couple
of</B>
<BR><B>months, but it had long lasting emotional effects on all of us.</B>

<P><B>Queen Mary</B>

<P><B>By: eldave@ev1.net</B>

<P><B>I have had a few different experiences, but the one I'm about to
tell you happened in 1987 on the Queen Mary.&nbsp; My family was taking
a family trip to CA from TX.&nbsp; We did all kinds of touristy stuff:
Disneyland, etc.&nbsp; One stop on our trip was to stay on the Queen Mary,
when it was docked and used as a hotel.&nbsp; We happened to stay in Queen
Mary's suite.&nbsp; I had always been fascinated by the Titanic, and was
equally fascinated by this up close encounter with a similar ship.&nbsp;
The suite was fairly small.&nbsp; There was an entrance hall with a sm.
room to the right that I had assumed was for a servant.&nbsp; There was
a full bath to the right, and a living area straight ahead.&nbsp; The main
bedroom was through the living room and to the right.&nbsp; I, being the
older sibling, claimed the small room as my own.&nbsp; My brother got the
couch in the living room.&nbsp; I was pleased to get the upper hand, and
I went straight away to fully move into my room.&nbsp; The room was like
a small closet, no windows.&nbsp; There was a small cot like bed with a
small chest of drawers and a mirror above that.&nbsp; It was pretty drab
compared to the rest of the suite, so I went so far as to try and pretty
things up and make it my own.&nbsp; After settling in, we went about the
boat on tours and things until it was time to go to bed.&nbsp; I was fairly
young, about 12 or so, and I don't remember exactly what happened that
night, but I know that after all the lights were out, I was scared out
of my mind. I tried to just go to sleep, but I couldn't.&nbsp; I thought
that maybe my brother would change rooms with me, but that meant swallowing
my pride. After deliberating, I couldn't stand it anymore, and I woke my
brother up and tried to persuade him to change rooms with me.&nbsp; He
wouldn't do it, so I had to go one step further and sleep on the floor
with him, because I was so scared.&nbsp; The next morning, I tried to explain
to my parents, but they just shrugged it off.&nbsp; Later that next day,
I had stayed behind to get ready for the day while the rest of the family
had gone out.&nbsp; I walked from my small closet room into the hall.&nbsp;
I pushed the button (the light switches were not switches, but 2 sets of
buttons - when you push one in, the other pops out and turns the light
on or off).&nbsp; So, I turned on the light, and walked across the hall.&nbsp;&nbsp;
While in the middle of the hall, the light turned off.&nbsp; I tried to
remain calm and tell myself that the light burned out.&nbsp; I went to
the end of the hall and pushed the button and the light went back on.&nbsp;
I took a deep breath and decided to go ahead and take a bath and get ready.&nbsp;
I was taking a bath, and felt so self conscious, like someone was just
watching me, that I pulled the shower curtain around the tub.&nbsp; We
left that day, and I tried to tell my family that the place was haunted,
but they didn't believe me.&nbsp; I had never heard any stories about the
boat until 2 years later - they ran a special on the Queen Mary and talked
about the hauntings.&nbsp; I told my mom who was watching it with me, "See,
I told you."</B>

<P><B>Family's Ancestral Home</B>

<P><B>By: neonkappa@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>In the Philippines, my family was a pretty prominent</B>
<BR><B>one. It may be a third world nation, but our house on</B>
<BR><B>Buendia Avenue in Manila was really something else.</B>
<BR><B>The closest comparison I can make here in the States</B>
<BR><B>is if we had a home growing up on Fifth Avenue in</B>
<BR><B>Midtown Manhattan, here in NY.</B>
<BR><B>This house, however, was not our ancestral home. It</B>
<BR><B>was just the one I grew up in.</B>
<BR><B>My ancestral home was located on the island of Buoc,</B>
<BR><B>in the northeast if I'm not mistaken. It is a mansion</B>
<BR><B>of an old house. I'm not sure why our family was so</B>
<BR><B>important; I heard all these stories later in the US</B>
<BR><B>when I was at least 8 years old.</B>
<BR><B>To give you a sense of my mom's maternal family,</B>
<BR><B>here's an example: in the province of Pangasinan,</B>
<BR><B>there is a bridge there that connects that province to</B>
<BR><B>the rest of the country's mainland, named after my</B>
<BR><B>grandmother (It's still in use today... it's the</B>
<BR><B>Carmen Bridge). The one who designed it was the</B>
<BR><B>nation's leading architect at the time, educated in</B>
<BR><B>MIT, and was her uncle. My grandmother herself was a</B>
<BR><B>fashion model, and performed piano recitals to two</B>
<BR><B>different Presidents of the Philippines as a little</B>
<BR><B>girl. Up until World War II, it was unwritten custom</B>
<BR><B>for any President of the Philippines visiting the</B>
<BR><B>province to stay in our ancestral home. Before her,</B>
<BR><B>other women had done the same. My grandmother was</B>
<BR><B>always a Flower of the national May Parades. This was</B>
<BR><B>a filipino thing where beautiful social</B>
<BR><B>butterfly-girls were chosen to the Flowers of</B>
<BR><B>different things, such as saints, provinces, months of</B>
<BR><B>the year, etc. I don't know the custom too well, so</B>
<BR><B>I'll leave it at that.</B>
<BR><B>In any case, my family was pretty big then,</B>
<BR><B>member-wise and status-wise. We WERE the most</B>
<BR><B>prominent family in the province, if not one of the</B>
<BR><B>pretty prominent ones in the country. Our home, so I'm</B>
<BR><B>told, was a thing of beauty.</B>
<BR><B>During World War II, Japanese forces managed to invade</B>
<BR><B>the island. They stormed their way further and further</B>
<BR><B>inland at Buoc, and stationed beachheads there. The</B>
<BR><B>residents were all in a panic, especially over the</B>
<BR><B>religious items (the nation being 98.9% catholic, you</B>
<BR><B>can understand the importance we placed on religious</B>
<BR><B>things), so they stored all of these in our ancestral</B>
<BR><B>home's basement/underground storage area, not</B>
<BR><B>believing they could invade that far. After all, the</B>
<BR><B>house is in an island of its own in that province.</B>
<BR><B>When the Japanese did invade, they slaughtered</B>
<BR><B>everyone who still remained in that house. But because</B>
<BR><B>of the religious statues there, it instantly became</B>
<BR><B>cursed. One of the Japanese soldiers went insane while</B>
<BR><B>inside plundering the house, and killed many of his</B>
<BR><B>fellow soldiers before he himself had to be killed.</B>
<BR><B>Ever since then it's been haunted... by spirits of the</B>
<BR><B>Japanese, or of the people murdered there, no one</B>
<BR><B>cares to find out.</B>
<BR><B>All of my aunts swear by this story. My mom says she</B>
<BR><B>spent a night there and vows to never return. My older</B>
<BR><B>cousin in Canada, Fran, whom I respect very much, was</B>
<BR><B>among the last to be in the house, and he agrees with</B>
<BR><B>all of the accounts that the house is haunted.</B>
<BR><B>The house is still under our name, and it still</B>
<BR><B>stands. Anyone claiming to be from our family can pick</B>
<BR><B>up the keys from the local bank and open it up, but</B>
<BR><B>none dare to do so.</B>
<BR><B>My mom told me once of her staying there when she was</B>
<BR><B>younger. She ran a bath for herself, and heard someone</B>
<BR><B>calling for her, so she left the bathroom. Finding no</B>
<BR><B>one having called her, she returned only to find the</B>
<BR><B>tub filling up with blood. Screaming, she sought out</B>
<BR><B>the maids, her mother, anyone at all, but when she</B>
<BR><B>showed them the tub, it was simply filling up with</B>
<BR><B>water....</B>
<BR><B>Fran told us a story about a certain stairwell in the</B>
<BR><B>house. If you go up the stairs after a certain hour,</B>
<BR><B>you will hear people laughing and snickering and</B>
<BR><B>muttering in Japanese behind your back. When you look</B>
<BR><B>over your shoulder, no one is there....</B>
<BR><B>My relatives of course wanted to remove the religious</B>
<BR><B>statues from the bottom cellar of th house, but</B>
<BR><B>anytime you get near it, so they say, you will hear</B>
<BR><B>filipino and japanese voices pleading together to not</B>
<BR><B>touch them. Once the doors to the cellar were actually</B>
<BR><B>thrown wide open, only to discover that every single</B>
<BR><B>statue was covered in some drying, sticky red stuff.</B>
<BR><B>And then all their candles went out....</B>
<BR><B>I used to know more stories, but they all slip my mind</B>
<BR><B>right now. I AM writing these in from a kiosk in the</B>
<BR><B>mall, after all, so I'm a bit distracted as well.</B>
<BR><B>People who have been inside the house all swear by</B>
<BR><B>their stories, and shake their head when I tell them</B>
<BR><B>that my curiosity has gotten the better of me, and</B>
<BR><B>that I want to see for myself.</B>
<BR><B>"Go ahead," says Fran. "Feel free to. I guarantee you</B>
<BR><B>won't want to spend a night in that place."</B>
<BR><B>And that's the story of my family's ancestral home.</B>

<P><B>The Dishwasher</B>

<P><B>By: gbird@bellsouth.net</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>When I was about six years old I lived in a rented house in</B>
<BR><B>Framingham, Massachusetts for about a year between 1970</B>
<BR><B>and 1971. I lay awake in bed one morning fidgeting because</B>
<BR><B>I couldn't get back to sleep. I clearly remember staring at the
ceiling</B>
<BR><B>and watching the light of morning start to fill the room. I could
hear</B>
<BR><B>my father snoring and my brother grit his teeth in his sleep ( it
was</B>
<BR><B>always</B>
<BR><B>very loud). The door to my room was open and I could just see the
top of</B>
<BR><B>the</B>
<BR><B>stairwell from my bed. As I lay there I suddenly heard what sounded
like</B>
<BR><B>the</B>
<BR><B>rhythmic droning of the dishwasher running. I thought it was strange</B>
<BR><B>because</B>
<BR><B>I knew everyone was still asleep. Well, this droning sound started</B>
<BR><B>getting louder</B>
<BR><B>as if it were coming up the stairs. I started getting scared and
my</B>
<BR><B>heart started</B>
<BR><B>beating very fast. I knew that I didn't want to see whatever it
was that</B>
<BR><B>seemed</B>
<BR><B>to be approaching so I turned over on my stomach and faced the wall
next</B>
<BR><B>to my</B>
<BR><B>bed and threw the covers over my head. The sound had gotten really
loud</B>
<BR><B>as though</B>
<BR><B>it must have been in my room. At that point, one half of the bed
got ice</B>
<BR><B>cold and the</B>
<BR><B>other half seemed to get real hot. Then it all stopped, no more
sound. I</B>
<BR><B>just laid there</B>
<BR><B>with my heart pounding in my ears. I could still hear the sounds
of</B>
<BR><B>morning outside</B>
<BR><B>and my father's snoring. It never occurred again. I swear to this
day</B>
<BR><B>that it was not a dream.</B>

<P><B>The House That Was Meant To Be Ours</B>

<P><B>By: SexyBluEyez97@aol.com</B>

<P><B>Hi. I'm writing to tell you a story that just happened last year
to me, my Mom, my fiance, and my sister. I'm 23 years old and living in
Virginia. My Mom is in the process of getting a divorce and moved out of
my childhood home and asked my fiance and I to move in with her until she
got on her feet. We did just that and found an old house for rent. That's
where the story begins.....</B>
<BR><B>The house (plantation at the time) was built in 1871. The wealthy
owner was the President for a local college and also a big political advisor
for his time. He had a wife and 5 children, 1 boy and 4 girls. The house
is a Victorian style with 3 bedrooms, walk in closets, and fireplaces in
every room. It's only 2 floors as well as a unfinished basement with a
spiral staircase.</B>
<BR><B>My fiance and I moved in two weeks before my Mom did. We were putting
clothes up in our closet when we heard a man woman's voice coming from
downstairs. It started out as mumbling, but it continually grew louder
and louder until it sounded like there were 45 voices instead of 2!! Shawn
went to go check it out and found nothing. That was our first experience
with our ghosts.</B>
<BR><B>My Mom moved in two weeks later and we were sitting in the living
room around 9:30pm watching TV when all of a sudden, the strangest smell
developed. It was fresh peach cobbler! Mom looked at me and exclaimed,
"Wow, that smells so good. Is it almost done?"&nbsp; I was stunned. I told
her that I wasn't cooking anything and she gave me a weird look. We both
got up and started following our noses and it lead us to the basement.
Why you ask? Well, that was where the slaves prepared the meals! While
we were walking back up the stairs, the doorbell rang twice. It didn't
seem unusual until we opened the door and saw a man wearing a top hat,
a long trench coat, and carrying a black bag. We asked him if he was in
trouble or needed any help but he kept walking. Both my Mom and I looked
at each other and turned back to the man to say something, but he vanished!</B>
<BR><B>The most frightening experience happened to me and my fiance. We
both had trouble breathing in our room and always had a humidifier going.
I woke up one nite to get a drink and saw a woman walking past our room
towards the stairs. I thought it to be my Mom until I noticed that the
dogs were not with her (which is unusual). I walked out of my room and
from the top of the staircase saw the back of a woman's head with her hair
in a bun and a shaw draped across her shoulders. I followed her down the
stairs and heard the swooshing sound of a dress against the hardwood floors.
I stepped into the kitchen and all of a sudden, the basement door slammed
shut and I heard a woman crying. I hauled ass upstairs and Shawn was awake
looking for me because he heard someone crying and thought it was me!</B>
<BR><B>The most intriguing experience happened to my sister when she was
coming home around 9:15pm from play practice. She was driving down the
road and saw our house on fire! She started speeding up and as she got
closer, she realized that our house was fine. Nothing was on fire. Then
she saw the same man with the top hat, trench coat and black bag walking
from the house towards the road (we hadn't told her the doorbell story
b/c we thought we'd scare her if we did).</B>
<BR><B>I have many more experiences with this house but I'll wrap it up
with what we have found out through newspaper research (remember, the man
who built the house was a prominent man) so the family's tradegys and fortunes
were almost ALWAYS published. The room that my fiance and I occupied was
the little boy's room who died of TB when he was only 12 (the reason why
we had trouble breathing). He was frequented by a doctor every week around
9pm-9:30pm for medicine!!!! I believe the man who rang the doorbell was
the doctor.&nbsp; And the lady I saw walking down the stairs? She was the
wife of the political man and had tripped down the stairs on her dress
losing her baby that she was carrying in the process. I believe she still
searches and cries for his soul.</B>
<BR><B>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to tell you SOME of my experiences
with my old house. If anyone would like to email me, please feel free to
do so. :)</B>

<P><B>The Old Hotel</B>

<P><B>By: lskala@look.ca</B>

<P><B>My experience first happened when my family went to an old hotel(the
hotel had real keys instead of the card keys) We settled in and my brother
decided to go swimmimg. I told him I would be there in a minute. The door
to our room was locked at this tim after he left. I was going through my
bags to get my bathing suit when the door that was locked to our room creaked
open. As it opened a rush of cold air shwooshed though the room. That night
I was going to get ice when I saw a figure walk around a corner i front
of me. I was 2 feet away from it when it turned the corner and i looked
down the hallway where it went and the hallway was empty.</B>

<P><B>The Old Lady and The Boy</B>

<P><B>By:Sick_dude85@Hotmail.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>When I was young in my old house I used to lie in my bed and all
of a sudden feel cold and then a figure of an old woman would walk through
the room door to the middle of the room and vanish into thin air, when
my parents moved into the house before I was born my father was carrying
a box of stuff into the living room when he froze solid as there in the
middle of the room in front of the fire was the same old lady who used
to stay in the house, she was sitting in an old armchair then after about
2 minutes her and the chair vanished. After the house got re-modelled my
dad never saw anymore sightings but every night at the same time she would
walk into my room and then vanish, I asked someone who stayed round the
corner for years who it was and she told me she had died in front of the
fire in the armchair my dad saw and that her bedroom was the bedroom I
slept in, one night I was lying awake and she came in but this time for
the first time ever she was talking to someone and it was weird but I ignored
as by this time I was used to it and went to sleep. We moved out of that
house 4 years ago and the new owners have renovated again but I dont know
if they have had any experiences. When I started High School the school
building is 89 years old currently as it was started to be built in 1910
and they completed it in 1913, to cut a long story short there is a lot
of ghosts in the building and I have seen a few of them, and also my street
a man of about 40 or more was walking down the street and then just suddenly
vanished that is my latest sighting I see him every now and then at about
3am. I swear all of this is true and I am glad I have found somewhere to
post my story I will keep you posted on any new sightings I have i hope
to get new ones.</B>

<BR><B>The Room</B>

<P><B>By: boredmindedwomen@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>I was about 13 or 14 my mom and I had moved from Florida to Michigan!
We ended</B>
<BR><B>up in a small town called Hillsdale .She found us a little apartment
on ac side Rd. not</B>
<BR><B>to far from town.It seemed like an ok place.After 2 or 3 months
of living there i</B>
<BR><B>finally started sleeping upstairs in the 1st bedroom there were
2 .The 1st bedroom had a open staircase wooden floors and 2 windows in
the middle of the wall on</B>
<BR><B>the north side of the bedroom. Everynight i would lie in the bed
witch was on the wall</B>
<BR><B>to wear my feet were by the end of the bed pointin north.There were
2 windows throwing in shadows from the steert lights behind me on the wall
. But on the wall between the 2 windows on the north side of the bedroom
there was always a shadow</B>
<BR><B>of a skull and topp hat. T always thought it was my emagination
,but how could it be</B>
<BR><B>swhadows from the street light on the wall faceing away from the
street lights?It scared me enough that i changed rooms 2 the back bedroom.Until
1 night i went</B>
<BR><B>in the back bedroom to go to bed i had 2 big dolls my aunt had made

<BR><B>Things that have Happened to me and my Family</B>

<P><B>By: dwayde@peoplepc.com</B>

<P><B>These are only a few things that have happened to my family, I have
pictures to send also. I am so thankful I have finally found someone to
share these stories with that will not laugh at me or think I'm crazy.</B>
<BR><B>Laura League</B>
<BR><B>My family has a long history of dealing with the unknown. We built
a house in the out in the country in the mid 70's and that's when it all
started. Most of the people we have talked to about the things that went
on in that house have all told us the same thing. You have 6 teenagers
under the same roof and that we are the reason for all the things that
happened. I guess in some ways we were, we were all open minded to what
was going on. For instance my sisters and I liked to stay up late watching
TV in the living room there was a large picture window that practically
covered one of the walls in the living room, so any where you would set
in that room you could see out side. Well one night the power went out
while we were up late one night so we sat in the dark looking out the window
at the stars and we realized there were lights dancing in the front yard
so we ran outside to see if someone was playing a trick on us but no one
was there. When we went back in the house and looked out the window again
the lights were zooming around the yard like crazy after about a minute
they were gone. After that we had strange things happening in the house
like when we would leave the house, when we would get back home all the
lights in the house would be on and all the TV's and radios would also
be on. Then we started having something run up the basement stairs and
shake the door like they were trying to get in but if you opened the door
no one would be there only an ice cold breeze. My dad said we were crazy
until one night when it happened to him.(Now we aren't considered crazy).
There were other things like doors opening by themselves or dishes falling
in the kitchen when no one would be in there. I think the scariest was
when my sister and I&nbsp; were recording some songs from the recordplayer
in the basement. When we listened to the tape later there was no music
only something that sounded like a strong wind and some one talking in
a low voice it was a man but we couldn't make out what he was saying.</B>
<BR><B>When my grand father died my parents sold our house and moved next
door into the house my grandparent owned. My grandmother didn't want to
live in it without my grandfather there. By this time I was married and
had a son. One night I stayed in the house with my mother because she said
she didn't like staying there alone and my dad was gone on a trip (he was
a long haul truck driver).Now I know why she didn't like to stay there
alone. I was sleeping in the guest room with my back to the door, I kept
hearing something tap on the door. Three taps and then three more this
went on for a while and finally I turned over thinking it was my brother
(he would come in late some times and wonder through the house) when I
turned over I saw a man standing in the doorway plain as day but I couldn't
see his face, I thought it was my brother so I called out his name twice
and he never answered or moved so I got up walked across the room to turn
the light on and when I did I walked right through it. I told my sister
about it the next day and she said oh you met Bob.Bob turned out to be
somewhat of a family friend over the years he came by quite often my oldest
nephew would talk to him. I went into the room one day and he was looking
up talking to something and when I ask who he was talking to he just gave
me an odd look and said why it's Bob he seem suprised that I couldn't see
the quy. Well the kids are older now and Bob scared the fool out of my
nephew a few weeks ago. Jeremy had spent the night with my parents and
stayed in the quest room.(But not for long) My mother said he came running
out of the room about 30 mins. after he went in to go to bed. She said
he was white as a ghost and told her there was a man standing in the closet
just staring at him. When they went back in to check the closet it was
empty. Jeremy slept on the couch that night.</B>

<P><B>Angel of Death or Guardian Angel of Hope</B>

<P><B>By: MarsAngel13@aol.com</B>

<P><B>When I was about 4 yrs old I used to be left home alone. I was a
hyper kid so if the door wasnt locked I'd probally let them in. One day
while my grandmother was out and her boyfriend was sound asleep, a stranger
knocked on the door. I went to open the door and the wierdest thing happend.
It wouldn't open, it was unlocked but wouldnt budge. After trying for a
halfhour to open it I gave up and went to get a popcical. Thats when I
saw a figure that was wearing a black cape and hood in the darkened hallway.
I freaked out. I went to hide, and didnt come out til my grandmother got
home. Whenever I have felt unsafe I always look to the darkend spots and
the stands that figure.</B>
