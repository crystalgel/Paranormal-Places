<P><B>Encouraged to Move</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cherylcraig@lycos.co.uk</B><B></B>

<P><B>My story happened about 2 years ago over a period of 8</B>
<BR><B>months and I am so glad I no longer live in the same house.</B>
<BR><B>We moved to our current house because we had to but the</B>
<BR><B>happenings in our house just encouraged us even more. As I</B>
<BR><B>am tying this I have just remembered something else that</B>
<BR><B>happened when I was 14 years old. My parents split up when</B>
<BR><B>I was 14 and my sisters were both 11 and 9. I had always</B>
<BR><B>believed that negative energy could cause strange occurrences</B>
<BR><B>and so it was no surprise to me when things went a big strange</B>
<BR><B>in our house. First thing that happened was the TV on my</B>
<BR><B>chest of drawers would shake from side to side which was just</B>
<BR><B>not possible. I put it down to vibrations elsewhere in the</B>
<BR><B>house but this was not the case. Second, after returning home</B>
<BR><B>one night I came home and went straight into my room without</B>
<BR><B>turning the light on however I could see from the light coming</B>
<BR><B>in from the hallway. The picture I had on my wall came flying</B>
<BR><B>off the wall sideways (not possible) and hit the door side on</B>
<BR><B>and to this day there is still a massive dent where it made</B>
<BR><B>contact. My youngest sister also claimed to have seen the</B>
<BR><B>figure of a young girl standing beside her bed one morning</B>
<BR><B>however I was quick to dimiss as I felt as though if I</B>
<BR><B>acknowledged it, it would become real. Nothing else happened</B>
<BR><B>until 6 years later. We were in our new flat, my mum, me and</B>
<BR><B>2 sisters and everything was totally normal up until I'd say</B>
<BR><B>about 1 month of being there. Can't really remember the</B>
<BR><B>exact order events except that last and final one. My sister</B>
<BR><B>Jane had told my mum that she had been in bed the night</B>
<BR><B>before and had the feeling of someone pushing the covers</B>
<BR><B>down at either side of her like almost trapping her in the bed</B>
<BR><B>but she put it down to being really tired. My mum being the</B>
<BR><B>world's biggest sceptic said she was havering and to get a grip</B>
<BR><B>on reality and not to mention it to our younger sister Jemima</B>
<BR><B>as it would freak her out. She did not tell me also until after
a</B>
<BR><B>few things happened. A couple of days later, my youngest</B>
<BR><B>sister Jemima comes to my mum with an identical story and</B>
<BR><B>automatically assumes they are both in on it and are trying to</B>
<BR><B>wind her up but when both confronted denied all knowledge</B>
<BR><B>and my mum began to think along the lines that they may be</B>
<BR><B>telling the truth. By now I know about the whole thing and so</B>
<BR><B>as you can imagine I am slightly apprehensive about going to</B>
<BR><B>sleep at night. I was in my bed one night and I had a room of</B>
<BR><B>my own so I was last up in the house and I think I was reading</B>
<BR><B>a book or something and my cat Hamish was lying on the bed</B>
<BR><B>next to my thigh leaning on it. I was the only one that would</B>
<BR><B>allow him to sleep in my room because I always felt safer with</B>
<BR><B>him there. I heard a noise outside my room. Nothing you</B>
<BR><B>could really put a name to and I started to read again and I</B>
<BR><B>looked at Hamish and he was lifted 6 inches straight up in the</B>
<BR><B>air still in his curled up position, I freaked, the cat miaowed</B>
<BR><B>really loudly and ran from the room. I then went in to my</B>
<BR><B>mum's room because I was slightly petrified. Now my mum</B>
<BR><B>was sure something was happening yet nothing had happened</B>
<BR><B>to her. I was now beginning to think that maybe it was</B>
<BR><B>negative energy again because this house move had been a</B>
<BR><B>result of the breaking up of my parents and my mum really</B>
<BR><B>didn't want to live in this house and she was miserable and we</B>
<BR><B>were in turn miserable because she was. So 2 months passed</B>
<BR><B>with nothing happening until my sisters and I went to Irleand</B>
<BR><B>with my dad on holiday and left my mum in this house on her</B>
<BR><B>own for a week. I phoned my mum whilst we were away and</B>
<BR><B>she seemed on edge but wouldn't say what was wrong so that</B>
<BR><B>she didn't spoil our holiday but I had a feeling it was about the</B>
<BR><B>house. When we got back she told me that one night she had</B>
<BR><B>went to sleep and she always kept the bedroom door shut and</B>
<BR><B>the way the doors are you can't just push them to get in you</B>
<BR><B>have to physically turn the handle which was good because it</B>
<BR><B>meant my mum could keep the cat out. She said she was just</B>
<BR><B>drifting off to sleep and she felt the bottom corner of the bed</B>
<BR><B>being depressed as if someone had just sat on it. She thought</B>
<BR><B>at first the cat had got into the room but when she put the light</B>
<BR><B>on the door was still completely closed. She then put it down</B>
<BR><B>to her imagination and tried to fall back asleep. She then felt</B>
<BR><B>the same feeling of the covers being pushed down at either</B>
<BR><B>side of her and she also felt a pressure on her chest like</B>
<BR><B>someone was sitting on it. She tried to sit up but couldn't and</B>
<BR><B>she also couldn't reach the bedside lamp and the next thing</B>
<BR><B>she knew something hit her really hard in the face full force</B>
<BR><B>and the chest pressure released instantly. She couldn't sleep</B>
<BR><B>again that night and spent the night in my grans house. We</B>
<BR><B>came back from holiday and I then had to spend the last 9</B>
<BR><B>months sleeping in the same room as my mum as she was too</B>
<BR><B>scared. She was so convinced of something bad in the house</B>
<BR><B>that she went as far as to go to the libarary to check what was</B>
<BR><B>on the land previously as these flats had only been up for</B>
<BR><B>about 3 years. The library couldn't help as they had no files.</B>
<BR><B>My mum gave up until my sister met a lady at the bottom of</B>
<BR><B>our street who spoke to her unexpectedley and said that she</B>
<BR><B>had lived in the area all her life and were we new. My sister</B>
<BR><B>took the opportunity to ask if she knew what was there before</B>
<BR><B>the flats had been and she claimed that the carpark to the flats</B>
<BR><B>had once been completey sealed with a wrought iron fence</B>
<BR><B>over 6 feet high that you could not see through and the home</B>
<BR><B>beyond the fence was that of a scandalised councillor and</B>
<BR><B>there was a lot of mystery surrounding his death. We have</B>
<BR><B>since found out that this was true but there is virtually no</B>
<BR><B>information on the councillor or the land on which he lived.</B>
<BR><B>Now, needless to say my mum is not a sceptic and nothing has</B>
<BR><B>happned in our new house. Any info on what this could have</B>
<BR><B>been would be great as it would help to satisfy my curiosity!</B>
<BR><B>Please feel free to email me at the above address.</B>

<P><B>During the Night Shift</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: logic316@technologist.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I realize my experience is probably quite mundane compared to the
other</B>
<BR><B>stories I've read on this site, but here goes:</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; A few years ago, I used to work as a security guard at Texaco's
corporate</B>
<BR><B>headquarters in Harrison, New York.&nbsp; I had left another job
site that closed</B>
<BR><B>down and begun working the 11PM-7AM night shift there with my partner
Carlos</B>
<BR><B>(a White Plains policeman who was moonlighting as a private guard).&nbsp;
This</B>
<BR><B>happened approximately one month after they had the anti-discrimination</B>
<BR><B>protests which had recieved widespread media attention in the U.S.&nbsp;
Each</B>
<BR><B>night, one of us would stay at the front desk (by the only entrance
to the</B>
<BR><B>building that was open at nighttime) monitoring and logging into
a book who</B>
<BR><B>came in and out while the other guard would either drive around
in the</B>
<BR><B>patrol vehicle outside or walk around the inside of the large office</B>
<BR><B>building checking fire exits, making sure doors were locked (raiding
the</B>
<BR><B>refrigerators, putting his feet up on the president's desk, catching
naps,</B>
<BR><B>etc) and basically making sure everything looked okay on all floors.&nbsp;
We</B>
<BR><B>would remain in radio contact with each other and with Neil (our
sarcastic</B>
<BR><B>and overbearing supervisor) who was in the security console room
located in</B>
<BR><B>the basement.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; After working with Carlos for a few weeks, he started complaining
to me</B>
<BR><B>about seeing strange apparitions while going through the deserted
corridors.</B>
<BR><B>Whenever he saw one, he would sort of catch them flitting around
the corner</B>
<BR><B>of his eye or shooting across his path and then they were gone.&nbsp;
He had</B>
<BR><B>mentioned that one of them looked like a construction worker wearing
a</B>
<BR><B>yellow hardhat.&nbsp; Then later one night he reported over his
walkie-talkie</B>
<BR><B>hearing strange footsteps on the top floor and not finding the person
making</B>
<BR><B>them.&nbsp; I told him that according to our log book and judging
from our</B>
<BR><B>previous tours around the building, there simply couldn't have been
anyone</B>
<BR><B>up there.&nbsp; The only people on the whole property were me, Carlos,
Neil, and</B>
<BR><B>an engineer working in the console room with him.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I've done security work for over 5 years (gate/desk/tour
guard,</B>
<BR><B>supervisor, manager, etc) and at almost every job site I've been
to I would</B>
<BR><B>hear ghost stories from some guard or other.&nbsp; I kept an open
mind and</B>
<BR><B>listened to them politely, but up until now I have never experienced</B>
<BR><B>anything personally so I always just shrugged my shoulders and never
really</B>
<BR><B>knew what to make of them.&nbsp; Besides, over 85% of security guards
I've known</B>
<BR><B>in the business have little education, below average intelligence,</B>
<BR><B>frequently dishonest, and often don't play with a full deck (that's
the</B>
<BR><B>REALLY scary part about this job!).&nbsp; I guess I can understand
how walking</B>
<BR><B>through deserted dark buildings can be kind of creepy, but I always
liked</B>
<BR><B>the quiet and solitude.&nbsp; One thing that struck me as kind of
odd, though, is</B>
<BR><B>that the Texaco office building was only relatively recently built
in the</B>
<BR><B>1970's - I thought that only old buildings are supposed to have
ghosts.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, I figured that Carlos was probably just really tired and
overworked</B>
<BR><B>from having two jobs and not getting any real sleep.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Well, two nights later I was going up one of the fire exit
staircases like</B>
<BR><B>usual and opened the door to the top floor.&nbsp; At that point,
I clearly heard</B>
<BR><B>loud footsteps coming from the corridor around the corner from me.&nbsp;
I walked</B>
<BR><B>around the corner and heard the footsteps walking down the corridor
away</B>
<BR><B>from me and becoming fainter, but I didn't see anyone.&nbsp; I was
certain that</B>
<BR><B>nobody was supposed to be there, so while going down the hall I
loudly</B>
<BR><B>called out in my most authoritative voice "TEXACO SECURITY.&nbsp;
WHO IS UP</B>
<BR><B>HERE??" two times.&nbsp; Right then, I distinctly heard a shoe squeak
against the</B>
<BR><B>floor as if whoever was walking made a quick turn, then a brief
pause, and</B>
<BR><B>then the footsteps continued and sounded like they were going out
the other</B>
<BR><B>fire exit (even though the door remained shut).&nbsp; I specifically
noticed that</B>
<BR><B>the footsteps had a sharp 'click-clack-click-clack' sound as if
somebody was</B>
<BR><B>walking on a tile floor.&nbsp; The only problem is, every inch of
those floors</B>
<BR><B>are CARPETED.&nbsp; If there was a person walking up there, I shouldn't
have</B>
<BR><B>heard anything!&nbsp; I then remembered Carlos' report two nights
before so I</B>
<BR><B>hurried after the sound to catch whoever it was, ran through the
other fire</B>
<BR><B>exit, and looked down the stairs.&nbsp; The sound had completely
stopped and</B>
<BR><B>there was noone in the stairwell.&nbsp; All the fire exit doors
remained closed</B>
<BR><B>like they were supposed to be and no one had gone out any of them,
since</B>
<BR><B>those big metal doors echo through the whole building when you close
them</B>
<BR><B>and I would have heard it being right in the area.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I radioed down to Carlos in the lobby and Neil in the console
room and</B>
<BR><B>checked whether they let anybody up there.&nbsp; I then started
looking through</B>
<BR><B>all the offices, which turned out to be empty.&nbsp; There were
no other workers</B>
<BR><B>in the building.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neil responded "Ehhhhh, right, that's
just my ghost.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>send it up there to keep an eye on you two losers".</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Neil always was a jerk.</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was about seven years of age I had a dream that i was on the
beach with my sisters and my mum and dad.&nbsp; The reason for the dream
i suppose was we were heading off for our summer holiday about a week later
so i was probably excited about that nothing unusual so far</B>
<BR><B>i woke up the next morning and at the bottom of the bed and in between
my toes was full of sand?</B>
<BR><B>not very ghostly i admit but strange yes its true</B><B></B>

<BR><B>CHILD GHOST IN HOUSE???</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Unicorn1108@cs.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I thought I was seeing my son who was about 11 yrs. old at the time.
Then I realized my son was not home that night. He was at his Dad's.&nbsp;
The little boy was hiding,almost like he was playing or was scared (He
was hiding behind a couch, when I woke up and saw him.)&nbsp; I also used
to hear very softly--usually waking me up-"can you help".&nbsp; Things
like my heat would be on 90 degrees when I would arrive home, things would
fall off the dryer when there was no wind and the dryer would be off.&nbsp;
Also, a ball would roll across the room.&nbsp; Things usually happened
if my son and I would have an argument.&nbsp; I was newly divorced and
having problems with my son.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Carol</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:berjettej1@webtv.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I had moved back home in the summer of 1998.&nbsp; I started working
for the</B>
<BR><B>county at a chemical health clinic by December that same year.</B>
<BR><B>My position had been an ex-office employee's named Carol.&nbsp;
She had died</B>
<BR><B>from an over-dose of sleeping pills, but I was not informed of this,
I</B>
<BR><B>was just told that she had moved on (notice the play on words?&nbsp;
At the</B>
<BR><B>time, I didn't).</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, I was very happy in my new role as Office Specialist III,
doing</B>
<BR><B>computer assignments, managing our resource center, delegating office</B>
<BR><B>duties and above all, just making sure that work flowed smoothly.</B>
<BR><B>Well, one day I was in my office (Carol's old office) and I was
very</B>
<BR><B>busy doing some computer work.&nbsp; I had just sat down from getting</B>
<BR><B>something out of my file cabinet when I noticed movement out of
the</B>
<BR><B>corner of my eye.&nbsp; I turned my head towards the door (to my
left) to</B>
<BR><B>look but saw nothing (the office was at the end of a long hallway).&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>shrugged it off and went back to working when all of the sudden,
I</B>
<BR><B>actually saw the picture of my (deceased) father move!&nbsp; It
sat on top of</B>
<BR><B>my printer which was right next to my monitor (no, the printer was
not</B>
<BR><B>printing!).</B>
<BR><B>I know it could not have been any wind because all the windows in
the</B>
<BR><B>building are screwed shut, my office door was shut, and I kept a
cover</B>
<BR><B>over the vent in my office because it was always too cool for me.</B>
<BR><B>Then, as I sat there staring at my dad's picture, I suddenly felt
a</B>
<BR><B>pinch!&nbsp; Carol has pinched me on my left thigh!!&nbsp; I had
on nylons and I</B>
<BR><B>also saw where she pinched me because the strands of fiber were
still</B>
<BR><B>recoiling from where she had pulled them!</B>
<BR><B>That was it!&nbsp; I ran out of that office and down the hall to
the</B>
<BR><B>reception area and told my co-workers.&nbsp; And when I showed them
my ruined</B>
<BR><B>nylons (why would I purposely ruin a perfectly good pair of $15.00</B>
<BR><B>nylons!?), they all stopped what they had been doing and just stared!</B>
<BR><B>Finally, one of them pulled me aside and told me that I needed to
speak</B>
<BR><B>with our manager.&nbsp; She said that the manager would explain
(I found out</B>
<BR><B>from the manager that she had asked them not to say anything to
me about</B>
<BR><B>Carol and the fact that they ALL had been visited by her AND that
they</B>
<BR><B>knew the office was haunted!)</B>
<BR><B>Well, the excitement from the incident slowly faded away and a couple
of</B>
<BR><B>days later, I was doing some serious cleaning.&nbsp; I was going
through some</B>
<BR><B>floppy discs I had found behind the desk.&nbsp; One especially caught
my eye</B>
<BR><B>because it was orange.&nbsp; When I placed it in the computer--to
my</B>
<BR><B>surprise, I found myself reading what turned out to be Carol's diary.</B>
<BR><B>She had been distraught over the suicide of her best friend. Carol
was</B>
<BR><B>also an alcoholic who was sick and refused to get help (imagine,
an</B>
<BR><B>alcoholic working for a chemical health clinic!).&nbsp; There were
many other</B>
<BR><B>things mentioned that I cannot get into because it would fill a
novel.</B>
<BR><B>I felt so sorry for Carol.&nbsp; So, I added my own thoughts to
hers.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>asked her to please let go and--let God.</B>
<BR><B>After that, I deleted everything and never told anyone about what
I had</B>
<BR><B>found.</B>
<BR><B>About 2 months later and many more encounters, the manager decided
to</B>
<BR><B>move me to another office .&nbsp; Carol's old office was given up
for storage</B>
<BR><B>space.</B>
<BR><B>I have since resigned my position there and although I had prayed
for</B>
<BR><B>forgiveness for Carol's soul and asked that she be sent to a better</B>
<BR><B>place--to this day still--no-one likes going into that office.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Can Ghosts Move</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: JustJuggling@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Robert. I grew up around a ghost. I am now researching&nbsp;
to see what kind of spirit it was. I no longer live in the home. My parents
live in another town about 40 miles from there. I live about eight or nine
miles from there now. I drove by the house again the other day.</B>
<BR><B>Its been over 10 years since I have been in the home. To my knowledge
my parents never complained about any "strange activity," but I witnessed
it and I remember every encounter&nbsp; vividly.</B>
<BR><B>The first time was with my closet door. It opened slowly but&nbsp;
completely. I mean I always completly closed my door.&nbsp; That one night.
I watched it open. I watched it open. Naturally I was terrified. I also
thought someone may have played a joke on me at first, but they did not.
Not in our house. The house was a two story and the floor made noise when
walked on. I don't mean an old house. We moved into a new house. We lived
there about four or five years.&nbsp; This was the first of many different&nbsp;
things to happen.</B>
<BR><B>Every time there was an occurrence, It involved an object. I could
write all night about these things but I feel chills when I do.</B>
<BR><B>I wonder if ghost can move. Things happen here too,,,,,,sometimes.</B>

exactly someone who will be sure to get them there</B>
<BR><B>40clock that afternoon thery called and said they were put on brandons
grave</B>
<BR><B>i felt so happy i did that</B>

<BR><B>but the story doesnt end here</B>
<BR><B>4 months after i kept seeing a crow around my home and it was there
for 5 nights straight.</B>

<BR><B>as i got out of the car i started to feel faint and couldnt understand
why.</B>
<BR><B>as i entered the store to my right i saw a guy who was the mirror

<BR><B>Bradock Roadhouse Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mjcoffman@alleganyinternet.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>In 1994-95 I lived in Cumberland MD just off the old Bradock road
that dates back to colonial times as a then wilderness route to the unexplored
country to the west.&nbsp; I offer that as a backdrop that may help provide
context for the perception of the guys that i experienced, since this apartment
building was 1960's era modern, and it's hard to pin this stuff down, but
this would seem to be a real example of the place, the locus of experience,
being the map of the haunting.</B>
<BR><B>In 1994 I went to bed around 11 o'clock but was sleeplessbecause
of the banging and thrashing sounds that were happening on the other side
of the wall.&nbsp; Yet I was drifting off when&nbsp;&nbsp; I was shocked
into wakeing by the sounds of a rape just inches from my ear.&nbsp; There
was a piercing scream&nbsp; of outrage, then I heard the sounds of a death
rape.&nbsp; I can't even start to tell you how awful that sounded, so i
won't try.</B>
<BR><B>I am describing this real time so I was very awake when I heard
this person scramble over the balcony and the felt her body snuggle into
mine that night.&nbsp; This presence told me about her need for protection
since her mother took on this latest boyfriend.&nbsp; I took this disembodied
baby into my arms and I told her that she would be safe with me, that anyone
the wished to harm her would need to come through me first.</B>
<BR><B>For two days after this child asked for and received my promise
I was visited&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by&nbsp; her dog, that would run up and
lay down on my bed.</B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My name is Leah and I'm 13. I live in Louisiana and my trailor is</B>
<BR><B>haunted. Here's how I know. One time about a year ago, my mom had
gone</B>
<BR><B>to the grocery store. I was alone, except for the cats. I was watching</B>
<BR><B>MadTV when all of a sudden I heard footsteps coming down the hall.
It</B>
<BR><B>sounded like someone wearing big, heavy boots.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The door to my bathroom (which is right next to my
room) opened, the</B>
<BR><B>light flicked on, then off. The bathroom door slammed and the footsteps</B>
<BR><B>went back down the hall. When my mom got back, I tried to tell her
about</B>
<BR><B>it, but she didn't believe me.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, during summer break this year, I had come home
from my friend's</B>
<BR><B>party and I left my platforms in the living room. My mom brought
them to</B>
<BR><B>me and I swear they were there when I went to sleep. The next morning,</B>
<BR><B>my mom came to my room, holding my platforms and asking what they
were</B>
<BR><B>doing up front. I didn't know.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; But here's how I really know my trailor is haunted.
Last month I was</B>
<BR><B>in my room listening to my stereo and dancing. Well, I have bad
knees</B>
<BR><B>and sometimes they give out and I fall. That happened when I was</B>
<BR><B>dancing. When I was a few inches away from the floor, I felt two
icy</B>
<BR><B>cold hands on each of my shoulders, pulling me up. As soon as I
was on</B>
<BR><B>my feet, the hands let go.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think the ghost is out to hurt anybody. In
fact, if it kept</B>
<BR><B>me from falling (and possibly hurting myself) it must be a friendly</B>
<BR><B>ghost. I've jokingly named it Bob (I'm pretty sure it's a man),
and</B>
<BR><B>everytime something unexplained happens around the trailor, I just
say</B>
<BR><B>"Oh, must be Bob".</B><B></B>

<BR><B>All My Life</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:AmyColvin@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; This is my story of what has happened to me all my life.</B>
<BR><B>Ever since I was about 4 or 5 I have had 2 sprits with me.&nbsp;
When I was young they never scared me.&nbsp; When they first came was in
the first house I remember living in.&nbsp; My sister and I shared the
same room at the bottom of the stair's.&nbsp; My bed was in the corner
where you could see the doorway right in front of you.&nbsp; They would
come in at night when I was trying to go to sleep or they would wake me
up.&nbsp; They never really scared me they just stood there and stared.&nbsp;
I would lay there frozen, but not scared.&nbsp; They never talked to me
for that matter I never talked to them.</B>
<BR><B>The man wore a letterman sweater like they did in the forties and
fifties.&nbsp; The woman dressed from the same era.&nbsp; I could tell
they didn't want to hurt me.&nbsp; No matter where I slept in that room
I always woke up with a dandy long leg spider on me.&nbsp; I am terrified
of spiders even very small ones.&nbsp; However dandy long legs don't scare
me.&nbsp; It was as if they where protecting me from something.&nbsp; The
spiders that is not the ghosts.</B>
<BR><B>Any way as we moved from house to house the presence moved with
me.&nbsp; Although it wasn't the man and woman from before.&nbsp; They
grow to be meaner somehow and more scary.&nbsp; I always felt people not
just someone, but people watching me.&nbsp; At night I could be watching
T.V. with my brother and sister and see something out of the corner of
my eye dart past real fast they were most of the time small black spots.&nbsp;
They where sometimes full sized black thing's I am not sure what they are.&nbsp;
But they scared the piss out of me.</B>
<BR><B>As time went on and I grow older they got stringer or something
because when I was about 18 or 19 I moved into my own apartment and was
fine for the first couple or weeks after that in the middle of the day
(when before it was always at night,) I felt some one watching me and my
friend did too.&nbsp; We went to her house and got here bible, and some
of her mom's holy water that she had, and some holy roseries that she had
one for each door way and one for a mirorr that I owned that I got about
the same time my friend and I felt the very evil being watching us. By
the time we got back to my place the evil had almost more then tripled
in size I can't explane the felling of all the evil in my home almost like
every evil being was in my house.&nbsp; We read from the scripture I don't
remember which one but at first it was like it was working then it was
worse. We then light white candles and put crosses above the doorway's
and on the mirorr with the holy water.&nbsp; That to helped a little but
not enough. Just as fast as we got them to leave more came I cuoldn't take
it any more I had to get out So My friend and I went for a walk that took
about half an hour give or take.&nbsp; By the time we got back they where
all gone.&nbsp; They stayed gone until my husband, and I moved in with
some friends of ours and again I felt watched only at night and only when
I was alone.&nbsp; I had my pastor come bless the house it helped but didn't
get rid of the presence that still to this day follows me.</B>
<BR><B>After my sister passed away due to medical problems I would see
her in my sleep come charging down the hall at me almost as if she was
angry with me for not coming to she her in the hospital of something I
don't know.&nbsp; I was very hard for me to go and I think she knows that.&nbsp;
Her charging at me lasted about 4 months.&nbsp; She then acted like she
was helping me all the time. She is still in my dreams at least once a
month.</B>
<BR><B>The other night I was sitting here reading the story that went with
the Jesus pitcher and I felt someone standing behind me as if they where
going to harm me until I turned around real fast. I know that I am haunted
rather then where I live is haunted because all my life I have had this,
and I have moved 600 miles from all of that and it is still wayching me
what ever it is.&nbsp; No matter where I go it will be there.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>A Whatsit?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kcostello@houston.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello,</B>
<BR><B>I'm not quite sure what we have, if anything at all.</B>
<BR><B>First off, I assure you that my husband and I are both fairly intelligent
and very logical people.&nbsp; We are opened minded but not gullible to
every thing we see or hear.</B>
<BR><B>Here goes nothing..... We bought this house in May 1994, the house
was built in 1975-76, the land from what we understand was used for raising
rice, sugar and cattle.&nbsp; The neighbors on both sides bought their
houses at the same time this one was built.&nbsp; We asked them about the
people who lived here before.&nbsp; Nothing of real interest, no deaths,
no killing, no suicides.&nbsp; The first owners sold in the early to mid
eighties.&nbsp; It then became a rent house until we purchased it.&nbsp;
It had so many different renters, that the neighbors could not say just
how many and the fact that it stood empty for long periods of time in between
renters.&nbsp; And that it had been empty for over a year before we bought
it.&nbsp; But, there were no problems that they knew of.</B>
<BR><B>When we looked at the house, I had gone out the day before and chose
five houses for the realtor to show my husband.&nbsp; I wanted this house,
goodness knows why, I did not tell my husband this, for I wanted to see
if he felt the same.&nbsp; Out of the five, he walked into this one, into
the front hall, and said "cold spot, cool".&nbsp; and kept walking.&nbsp;
I just giggled and the realtor just looked at me as if we were nuts.&nbsp;
The house was very run down and dirty, but it had a lot of potential (in
my mind).&nbsp; He looked around for a long time and the realtor kept wondering
why I wanted this house, there were so many others in much better shape.&nbsp;
I just smiled and shrugged.&nbsp; When Richard came back to us, he said
that he wanted to speak to me alone, we walked out into the over grown
back yard and he said "I want this house, what do you think?"&nbsp; I told
him that he needed to see one more, then we'll decide.&nbsp; As we looked
at the one last house, Richard (not interested in this one) kept talking
about "Cold Spot", so the realtor took us back for one last look.&nbsp;
We walked through it together, and decided to buy this one.&nbsp; One of
the happiest days in our lives.</B>
<BR><B>When we moved in, 3 weeks later, I had my first feeling.&nbsp; I
was alone waiting for Richard and two other guys to come back with the
1st load, I was sitting on the fireplace hearth, when I felt as if someone
else were here.&nbsp; I became a little edgy so I got up and started walking
around to calm my nerves and kept telling myself, that I was edgy due to
the move.&nbsp; Finally, they showed up and we started to unpack.</B>
<BR><B>Things were good for a while, nothing out of the ordinary, new sounds
we needed to get use to, settling, birds in the fireplace chimney, squirrels
in the attic, the usual.&nbsp; We took care of all that, then we noticed
(not at the same times) doors were opened that were closed tight just minutes
before, lights on in one of the spare bedroom closets, music (that we though
were our neighbors), sounds that weren't really voices, shadows down the
hallway, toilets flushing, water running in a bathroom sink, the unsettling
feeling of dread in the back bedroom, when our (from previous marriages)
teenage kids came to visit, they slept on the couch or floor in formal
living room(other side of the house), the dog barking and growling at the
back bedrooms door, stacks of pennies here and there, things falling from
shelves, fans/lights turning on by themselves, for the longest time we
were not able to keep a light fixture from burning out bulbs on a weekly
basis.</B>
<BR><B>One day I came home from work, as I walked into the porch area,
I heard a woman's voice (outside and behind me) say "hello", I turned around
and found no one, I walked back out and looked around for a neighbor or
some one else, no one was out, shrugged and went back into the porch about
to put the key into the door when I heard voices and what sounded like
band music(playing very softly) in the front bedroom (window is next to
front door), so I tried to put the key in very slowly and turned the knob,
open the door to......nothing.&nbsp; I could not hear anything, when I
went to check on that bedroom, the door was open and the closet light was
on, so I walked in and went to the closet and turned off the light, and
said out loud, (this is something I had been doing for my own sanity) "turning
off the light and closing the (closet)door", then turned around and walked
out, closing the door behind me "closing the (bedroom)door".&nbsp; As I
was doing this, I then noticed the back bedroom door was opened, a chill
went up my spine and horrible dread, I just reached in very slowly and
closed the door, turned around and walked off as fast as I could, for I
don't think I had taken a breath since I spotted the back bedroom's open
door.&nbsp; When I came back later the back bedroom door was ajar.&nbsp;
My husband was still at work and I was the only one in the house at the
time.&nbsp; I can not tell you how many times I have closed those doors,
(I hate for doors to be open for rooms not in use)and my poor husband got
blamed alot that first year or two.&nbsp; Come to find out he rarely went
into either room, (and because of me, he always closed the doors tightly
after use)for he did not like to go in them for anything.</B>
<BR><B>All these things happened over a 3 year span, they did not happen
every day, seemed to occur at all hours of the day or night, never seemed
to happened while just waking or falling asleep.&nbsp; When Richard and
I finally sat down to compare notes, we decided not to say anything to
the kids, we did not want them to worry or start to see things when they
came to visit.&nbsp; Come to find out, they came to us and told us that
they would not sleep in the back bedroom, nor did they really want to sleep
in the other spare bedroom, "you know you have a ghost or something in
your house, don't you?"&nbsp; That is when they started telling us of seeing
and hearing much of the same things that we were experiencing.&nbsp; What
a relief that was.</B>
<BR><B>We are still in the house to this day, what ever was/is here, doesn't
show itself much anymore, been very quite the last few years.&nbsp; For
a while there, it showed it self strongest during the holidays, from early
October till late January, early February.&nbsp; It's still here, we just
don't see or hear much anymore, but every once in a while it let's us know.</B>
<BR><B>One night (about a year or 2 ago) while my husband was changing
his shoes, sitting on the end of the bed, he had this strange feeling that
he needed to look up, like someone yelling in his head, DANGER! Just as
he looked up, he saw our ceiling fan starting to fall from the ceiling,
it just missed him, if he hadn't looked up it would have hit him on the
head.</B>
<BR><B>It also, dislikes non believers.&nbsp; Our son-in-law while staying
with us, came in from work (very late), and went in to shave and take a
hot bath, after he finished shaving, he used the toilet and then got into
the tub, he said that he was laying there soaking for maybe 10 minutes,
he then shampooed his hair and went under the water to rinse, as he came
up, he said that he heard water running and looked over at the sink across
from him, he saw both faucets opened up wide and was splashing water everywhere.&nbsp;
He then jumped out of the tub, grabbed a towel and ran to the spare bedroom
where our daughter was sleeping, shook her awake and started yelling at
her for pulling such a stupid joke, she calmed him down and told him, "I
was asleep, you had to wake me, remember?&nbsp; I did not get up at 2:30am
to pull a joke on you" and then she went to check the bathroom, the water
was splashing everywhere, so she turned it off.&nbsp; She then walked back
into the room and got back into bed and said "now, do you believe?"&nbsp;
That was the last time anything exciting happened, and that was close to
2 years ago.&nbsp; Our oldest son (almost 24)is now living with us, in
the back bedroom.&nbsp; He says it's not really bad, but he stays up very
late and is on the computer most of the night, and I have noticed his light
is sometimes on when I get up in the morning. He says that he doesn't remember
turning them on.&nbsp; Go figure.</B>

<P><B>A Strange Long Term Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: criskim144@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am sending in the following experience for two reasons.....one,
I think it is a story that, like so many of the others, needs to be shared.....and
two, I was hoping to get your opinion on this ghost....was it once human,
was it ever dangerous, and could it possibly have just gone away?&nbsp;
I have spent many moments pondering these questions, but, to be honest,
I am afraid to step foot i nthat house now that I no longer have to.&nbsp;
Anyway, here is my family's story...hope I didn't leave anything out.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My family had, for several years, a ghost
who's existance began as a joke (we have several skeptics in our family)
and turned into an unerving reality to even the most adamant disbelievers.&nbsp;
Three siblings and their families all lived in one neighborhood, so needless
to say, we were all fairly close.&nbsp; "George" as the ghost liked to
be called, first appeared to my cousin, Jay,&nbsp; who was around 4 at
the time.&nbsp; Jay's parent's thought that this person whom Jay was always
speaking of and blaming things on was his imaginary friend and didn't think
much of it.....until Jay failed to outgrow this imaginary friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My aunt and uncle then moved into a newly built house with Jay and his
new sister, Kim (though as a sidenote, I must add that one of the workers
died on the roof while they were building the new house...but I doubt that
this has any significance since the ghost was with Jay before).&nbsp; "George"
followed.&nbsp; Strange things began to happen for all to see.&nbsp; Things
dissapeared, only to be found later wrapped up in out of the way, impossible
places.&nbsp; My aunt brought home a new plant, and immediatly it began
swaying about in a frenzied fashion.&nbsp; Both being fairly logical people,
my aunt and uncle checked the area around the plant for drafts or perhaps
a hidden string, suspecting someone was playing a trick on them.&nbsp;
There were none.&nbsp; The next day the plant was dead.&nbsp; My uncle
awoke one night with an eery feeling, and got up to check on Jay.&nbsp;
As he opened the door,&nbsp; Jay's electronic car started up, went around
the room, and stopped at my uncle's feet.&nbsp; Finding Jay sound asleep
and the remote control for the car safely on the other side of the room,
my uncle tried to make up a logical answer, saying that perhaps the car
had picked up on some other frequency which had caused it to move......but
in such a deliberate patern?&nbsp; That particular bedroom was also cold,
always.....no matter waht the weather or the temperature of the rest of
the house...there was always a prevailing chill there.&nbsp; Lights began
to go on and off for no reason,&nbsp; Kim was startled by a loud knock
on the wall as she was taking a bath.&nbsp; She ran out into the hall screaming,
and when everyone went in to invesitgate, they found a small hole in the
wall that looked as though someone had tried to break through from inside
the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp; After calling in an electrician to go over the wiring
and make sure everything was alright, my aunt was disconcerted whn the
man told her"Lady, the only thing I can tell you is that this place is
haunted.....there is nothing wrong with your house otherwise."&nbsp; The
adults began to question Jay, now, who was school aged and spent a great
deal of his time on the computer.&nbsp; Jay told them that he talked to
his friend telepathically.....and that he couldn't make the ghost show
up, it just did.&nbsp; The ghost had told Jay that in life it's name was
Mark, but now it prefered the name George.&nbsp; They advised him to tell
George to just leave him alone the next time...advice he took a few evenings
later when the family was about to go out for dinner.&nbsp; The voice in
Jay's head stopped immediatly, and all was forgotten, until the family
got back.&nbsp; Jay had gone immediatly back to his room and sat down at
his computer without a second thought, when he felt a sharp pain.&nbsp;
To his horror, he discovered shards of broken glass strewn all over the
chair.&nbsp; The glass was like none my aunt had ever owned, or seen for
that matter, and after showing it to family and niegbors she concluded
that it didn't belong to them, either.&nbsp; My mother began babysitting
Jay and Kim around this time, always at their house, and she had several
strange things happen to her, including a setting a can of throat spray
on her dresser only to wake up in the middle of the night to discover,
just in time, that the medicinal spray had been replaced by an almost identically
shaped bottle of toxic cleaning fluid.&nbsp; My mom tried to talk to Jay
about these strange things but as soon as he tried to talk about it, George
would warn him, and he would go pale and silent.&nbsp; Then George started
moving around the neigborhood.&nbsp; My parent's were having a small gathering
one night, and the topic turned to ghosts....my Mother had become a believer,
my father was still a staunch skeptic....so my mother challenged the ghost....she
said that if "George" really did exist, her car wouldn't make it to work
the next day.&nbsp; Everyone had a good laugh and the stament was forgotten
about....until my mother left for work.&nbsp; Halfway there the vehicle,
which had always ran fine, stalled, and refused to start.&nbsp; A mechanic
looked at it and could find nothing wrong.....the day afterwards, it my
mother tried the engine and it worked perfectly, and did so until the vehicle
was sold several years later.&nbsp; A few months later, my mother, 7 months
pregnant, was working alone late in my father's store, when she heard a
crash in a back room....after investigating, she found that a huge mirror
in the bathroom had fallen and shattered.....though it had been there for
years and was securly hung in place.&nbsp; Frightened, my mother began
having pains in her stomach and sat down.....telling "George" aloud that
if she lost the baby it would be his fault and asking him to leave the
family alone.......and he did......for a time.&nbsp; His next two appearances
were harbringers of misfortune to family members.&nbsp; Several years later,
Kim was getting ready for her wedding in the family home, when she walked
out of one room into the hall to see a dark mist shrouded figure fleeeing
from the room at the end of the hall......she wasn't as frightened as she
thought she should be, but felt wierd.&nbsp; Her new husband turned out
to be a horrible man who beat her until she finally managed to escape and
divorce him a month later....to this day she thinks George was trying to
warn her.&nbsp; My father was the next one to see George.&nbsp; He was
contemplating a business deal, when he walked outside early one morning
to see a man jogging past him on the street.&nbsp; As the man approached,
Dad noticed that the figure had no lower half, it was merely a misty upper
body.&nbsp; My father was a bit shaken, but attributed it to lack of sleep
or some other unknown cause.....the business deal ended up driving him
to banckruptcy.&nbsp;&nbsp; My aunt and uncle moved to another town and
the house stood empty for some time, until my father and stepmother decided
to buy it.&nbsp; During the time it stood empty , after the electricity
had been turned on for my family's approaching move in, a bunch of junior
high kids, including me, decided to play hide and go seek in the house.....everyone
had cleared out and we had locked it back up when we noticed a light had
been left on.&nbsp; Myself and a neighborhood boy went back inside to turn
it off.&nbsp; We were halfway through the large living room when the light
turned itself of with a little click.....we ran, horrified, to the back
door...only to find that it wouldn't open.....we panicked and screamed,
almost hurting each ther in an effort to get out, and a few seconds later,
it opened.&nbsp; Thinking someone had held the door as a sick joke, I was
shocked to find the rest of the party several yards away.....no one had
beeen near the door, nor were there any signs that anyone had run from
the door to hide the prank.&nbsp; A few days later, the family moved in...it
was a roomy house, perfect for a family of 5 (myself, then 15, my parents,
sister age 11, and step-brother age 18).&nbsp; The strange things died
down but by no means went away.&nbsp; I once threw a slumber party and
one of the girls thought it would be fun to bring a Ouija board (having
no idea just how dangerous it could be).&nbsp; In the room we decided to
use, a medium sized sitting room, there was a large picture of Christ hanging
on the wall&nbsp; Well, we went about our amateur ghost-contacting, and
things were fairly uneventful, until one of the girls screamed...of course,
being a group of easily panicked kids, we threw the board and the pointer
down the hall and fell all over each other in our rush to the brightly
lit kitchen....where we calmed our friend from her hysterics and got her
to tell us why she had screamed.....it seems that she had seem the picture
of Christ moving, slowly and rythmically...as had my little sister.&nbsp;
One of the braver girls and I went back to the room to retrieve the board
and pointer.....only to find that, though the board was laying in the hall
where we had clearly seen it and the poiner land.....the pointer was back
in the room, pointing directly up toward the picture.&nbsp; No one could
have gotten back to that room without passing us first.&nbsp; Needless
to say, very few people ever stayed the night at my house again.&nbsp;
After that, most of the stuff that happened was sporadic at best.....we
would hear furniture move in rooms where no one was.....or very heavy,
stable furniture would be turned over, usualy while&nbsp; I was alone in
the house.&nbsp; The family dog would sometimes bark at corners for no
reason, as though he could see someone we could not....once while he slept
on the couch he jumped up, yelping as though he had been hurt, and growled
at and avoided the couch for the rest of the night.&nbsp; my brother was
once trapped in the living room closet..he tried to push the door open
but somethign heavy was in front of it.....and he was in the house alone.&nbsp;
Also, many people who had never heard the stories and did not know each
other, complained about having the feeling that someone was following them
in the hall....I knew this feeling well...I was never brave enough to look,
but I just knew that were I to stop suddenly, someone, or something, would
run into me.&nbsp; And Jay's old room, then my room, was always so unaturally
cold.&nbsp; Sometimes, late at night, I would hear whispers, like so many
voices together.....but I could never understand them.&nbsp; It was like
I was mentally getting in a radio station, but it would never come in clear
enough for me to hear what was being said.&nbsp; When I was 18, our family
moved out of the house....and though it stood empty and dark for almost
2 years, the one day I stopped by to visit my aunt and uncle, who lived
next door....I noticed something.&nbsp; There were no shades on the windows....and
the door to the living room closet...the same one my brother had been trapped
in, was standing open....and a light was on inside it.&nbsp; The neighbors
all said that the light had not been on the day before....the ydidn't even
think that the place had the electricity turned on.&nbsp; No one had the
courage to go turn it off this time....I guess George just wanted to welcome
me home.&nbsp; We sold the house, and a new family moved in....and lives
there now.&nbsp; I have never talked to the people, hence I doh't know
if they have had problems with the house or not......I hope for thier sake
they haven't.</B>

<P><B>Precious Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: HUGHES2156@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My mother is a preacher and she would always tell me and my sister
the same stories about her ghost experience. Well i was about 11 in the
6th grade(1999) And her and my dad told me the story about when she was
34 years old she had to have surgery. She was very nervous about it. Well
the doctor(an african-american, female) named Dr.Wing came and sat at the
foot of my mothers bed and touched her on her knee and told her everything
was gonna be alright. Well everything was alright, she pulled through and
came out fine. The next week or so her and my dad went back to the hospital
to give her some flowers,candy, and a thank you. When they went to the
front desk and asked for Dr.Wing they nurse said there has never been a
doctor in that hospital ever named Dr.Wing. My parents were so surprised
at this moment. When my mom was finished with the story i asked her these
questions about her facial features and they were all right. I had seen
this lady in my dreams, and i've seen her at my school, and in my bedroom.
The last time i seen her she told me she was there to protect me. I asked
her well why was you at my mother's hospital bed. She said if something
went wrong with my mother 3years later she wouldnt have been able to have
me. :)</B><B></B>

<BR><B>I Know What I Saw</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: snowboy@snowcrest.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Many years ago, when I was only 10 yrs. old, even though very young,
I knew what I saw. I had gone down into the cellar to get something of
very little importance and all of a sudden, the door slammed behind me.
I did not think anything of it, but then it started getting deathly cold.
Literally. I started to get very cold. Then, as I went to get what I was
pursuing, I started seeing faces. Faces I knew, faces I know. I ran up
the stairs without getting the object I was after. The door would not open.
I screamed because the faces were coming after me. Then, the door opened
and my mother came down with a bottle. I am not sure what it was, but when
my mother sprayed it, the "faces" disappeared. My mother told me that she
knew she shouldn't have sent me down there. She also told me that the contents
of the bottle were an old family tradition. I had scratchmarks on my arms,
my mother and father moved me out of that house 2 days later. I know it
sounds funny, my story, it sounds like something that would come out of
a movie. Please don't exclude it from your website though. I want others
that have gone through something like this to know that they're not alone,
and that they shouyld not hide or run from them. There is nothing to fear
but fear itself, as I always say. I still have the marks from that night,
but they do not run as deep as the scars in my heart. Thank-you for taking
the time to read my story, and I wish you fearless days for the rest of
your life.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>At 2 A.M.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: berjettej1@webtv.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Back in 1983, me, my ex and our 4 year old son had made a trip to
Tyler,</B>
<BR><B>Texas with my ex's mother (who I will refer to as "H"), brother,
and</B>
<BR><B>nephew.&nbsp; We went to visit H's father, whose wife had recently
passed</B>
<BR><B>away.&nbsp; He lived in a house that H had grew up in.</B>
<BR><B>The house had a huge bathroom with connecting doors, each one to
a</B>
<BR><B>bedroom.&nbsp; That night, as we prepared for bed, H's father gave
us his old</B>
<BR><B>room that he had shared with his wife (I now know why he no longer
used</B>
<BR><B>it!), and H took the adjoining bedroom (it was her room in the past).</B>
<BR><B>Around two am, I woke up and needed to use the toilet.&nbsp; As
I rose up, I</B>
<BR><B>saw and heard H's pink, fuzzy, slippers as she was walking across
the</B>
<BR><B>bathroom floor (the bathroom door had one-half inch between it and
the</B>
<BR><B>floor).&nbsp; I sat and waited patiently while waiting for her to
get done.</B>
<BR><B>Finally, my bladder getting the best of me, I got up and opened
my door</B>
<BR><B>only to find it unlocked and the bathroom empty!&nbsp; Well, my
bladder</B>
<BR><B>reminded me of my reason for being there so I didn't have time to
ponder</B>
<BR><B>it.&nbsp; I walked over to shut the door that lead to H's room.&nbsp;
Just as I</B>
<BR><B>started to pull it shut, I encountered resistance but on the other
side</B>
<BR><B>was H.&nbsp; The look on her face was one of sheer horror!&nbsp;
I asked her what</B>
<BR><B>was wrong and she said that she had been waiting to use the bathroom
but</B>
<BR><B>thought that I was the one in the bathroom and said she had got
tired of</B>
<BR><B>waiting and got up to rush me on only to find I had just entered
the</B>
<BR><B>bathroom, that's why I scared her when I was trying to shut her
door.</B>
<BR><B>Realization set in then and I told her that I thought she was in
the</B>
<BR><B>bathroom because I had seen her pink fuzzies under the door.&nbsp;
She said</B>
<BR><B>she saw and heard the same thing but thought it was me shuffling
across</B>
<BR><B>the bathroom floor in my slippers.&nbsp; We both looked down at
the same</B>
<BR><B>time--with stark revelation--I had on black, flat slippers, she
had on</B>
<BR><B>shiny, blue ones!</B>
<BR><B>Later on that morning after breakfast, my ex, his brother, nephew
and I</B>
<BR><B>left to go to the store because I was catching a cold and needed</B>
<BR><B>medicine.</B>
<BR><B>While we were leaving we encountered H's aunt, who was there for
her</B>
<BR><B>usual visit to help her brother with house chores.&nbsp; When we
got back, we</B>
<BR><B>noticed she was gone and H was outside.&nbsp; We asked why her aunt
had left</B>
<BR><B>so fast (we were only gone about 10 minutes).&nbsp; H told us that
her aunt</B>
<BR><B>told her she had went into the bedroom that I had stayed in and
when she</B>
<BR><B>approached the bed, she noticed that I was still sleeping!&nbsp;
She said she</B>
<BR><B>walked out and told H that she was so sorry to have disturbed "the</B>
<BR><B>woman" in the bed.&nbsp; H said she told her that there was no one
in the</B>
<BR><B>bed, that we all had left to go to the store.&nbsp; Her aunt kept
insisting</B>
<BR><B>that either I or some woman was still in the bed sleeping.&nbsp;
So when they</B>
<BR><B>both went back to look, the lady was still there!&nbsp; They both
bolted out</B>
<BR><B>of the house and that is where we found H.&nbsp; Her father told
us he didn't</B>
<BR><B>bother to leave because he was used to his wife's visits and that
she no</B>
<BR><B>longer scared him.</B>
<BR><B>H's father passed a few years later and before the house was finally</B>
<BR><B>raised, people in the surrounding area (the house was on a farm
and</B>
<BR><B>hadn't had any modifications) would always see the bedroom light
come</B>
<BR><B>on--at two am.</B>

home,</B>
<BR><B>school wasn't far away, afterall, and the summer my parents went
on</B>

<BR><B>One night I was scared, it was far too late to call my older sisters,</B>
<BR><B>and storms were getting worse outside.&nbsp; I was all gittery..walking</B>
<BR><B>around the house...when I happened to look up the stairs.&nbsp;
I saw a woman</B>
<BR><B>standing at the top of the stairs...in an old house coat..and curlers
in</B>
<BR><B>her hair.&nbsp; I said, "mom?" but the woman shook her head and
just</B>
<BR><B>vanished.&nbsp; But the strange thing was..I calmed down.&nbsp;
I wasn't scared of</B>
<BR><B>the storm or the dark..whatever or whoever that was..made me feel

<P><B>Something from Twighlight Zone Perhaps?</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By:catie_angel_voice@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have a few stories to share about unexplainable experiences.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My last day with Gram:</B>
<BR><B>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</B>
<BR><B>One thing that I have learned over the years, is to trust your instinct.</B>
<BR><B>My family has always had a connection to the psychic world... mostly
its</B>
<BR><B>the women in my family.&nbsp; My grandmother and I were exceptionally
close.</B>
<BR><B>I guess you could say, we still are.&nbsp; My Mom, and my Grandmother
all lived</B>
<BR><B>quite a distance from each other, and I used to say that we kept
"Ma Bell"</B>
<BR><B>in business.&nbsp; It was usually my Grandmother that I would call
when I was</B>
<BR><B>worried, and she always knew just the right thing to make me feel
better.</B>
<BR><B>One Saturday evening, my Mom called to say that my grandmother had
slipped</B>
<BR><B>while getting off the bus, and the doctors thought that she had
cracked a</B>
<BR><B>rib.&nbsp; They were keeping her in the hospital for observation
and to do some</B>
<BR><B>tests.&nbsp; On Monday evening, my Mom called back to say that the
test results</B>
<BR><B>on Gram, had showed widespread cancer in her body.&nbsp; I was devasted,
when</B>
<BR><B>she told me that the doctors predicted that Gram would have 6 months
to a</B>
<BR><B>year to live.&nbsp; She ended the call with the information that
Gram would be</B>
<BR><B>released from the hospital at the end of the week, and would continue
to</B>
<BR><B>live in her home until her health declined.</B>
<BR><B>I was so totally dumbstruck by this, I dont think I really slept
that</B>
<BR><B>night.&nbsp; I got up that morning, and had a terrible time concentrating
at</B>
<BR><B>work.&nbsp; I decided that I had to go visit my Grandmother as soon
as</B>
<BR><B>possible.&nbsp; It's quite a drive from where I live to the hospital,
so I</B>
<BR><B>resolved to leave early the next day.&nbsp; It takes about 5 hours
in good</B>
<BR><B>weather, and we had been suffering from awful winter storms for
days at</B>
<BR><B>that point.&nbsp; I woke that morning to find that the sun was shining
and the</B>
<BR><B>roads were wet-bare of snow.&nbsp; I made it to my Grandmother's
side just</B>
<BR><B>before lunch time.&nbsp; I spent some time with her talking, but
at times it</B>
<BR><B>seemed that she was halucinating due to the pain medication.&nbsp;
(I think</B>
<BR><B>they had her on a morphine drip)&nbsp; We chatted about many things,
but at one</B>
<BR><B>point, she said up and leaned close to me.&nbsp; She whispered to
me, "your</B>
<BR><B>Papa (what I called my grandfather) was here last night".&nbsp;
Papa had passed</B>
<BR><B>away nearly 20 years before, and perhaps most people would&nbsp;
write this off</B>
<BR><B>as 'the medication talking', but I asked her what he said.&nbsp;
She replied</B>
<BR><B>"He told me that he is coming for me soon".&nbsp; I then thought
that well,</B>
<BR><B>maybe that WAS medication making her hazy, so I tried to steer the</B>
<BR><B>conversation on to how she would be home soon, and that I we would
make</B>
<BR><B>plans then.&nbsp; She fell asleep a little while later, and I left
her side</B>
<BR><B>shortly after.</B>
<BR><B>I called my Mom after getting home late that night.&nbsp; We talked
briefly</B>
<BR><B>about my visit with Grandma, and how I had had this conversation
about my</B>
<BR><B>grandfather coming to visit her.&nbsp; Mom agreed that Gram was
likely</B>
<BR><B>halucinating.</B>
<BR><B>It was only later on that night, when I was wakened by the phone
from a</B>
<BR><B>sound sleep, that I realized Gram wasn't halucinating.&nbsp; My
Mother had</B>
<BR><B>called to say that Gram had passed away.&nbsp; I still feel her
presence at</B>
<BR><B>times.&nbsp; Perhaps she is still keeping in touch.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The House on Oxford Street</B>
<BR><B>London, Ontario:</B>
<BR><B>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</B>
<BR><B>It was July of 1986, and I was just out of college. I had found
a job, but</B>
<BR><B>still had to find a place to live cheaply on the small salary I
was</B>
<BR><B>making.&nbsp; Out of the blue, I bumped into an old school friend
who was</B>
<BR><B>living with her boyfriend.&nbsp; They had a small apartment, but
were moving in</B>
<BR><B>a couple of days, to a new apartment in town that had an extra bedroom.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>was amazed at my luck, and agreed to move in with them.&nbsp; The
house was a</B>
<BR><B>two story home that had been converted into two apartments: one
on the</B>
<BR><B>main level and one on the upper level.&nbsp; The basement was unfinished,
and</B>
<BR><B>was used for storage and a small laundry room.&nbsp; The upper level
apartment</B>
<BR><B>had slanted walls that followed the roof line down to about waist
level,</B>
<BR><B>and then the eaves were blocked off to give flat wall space for
furniture.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The apartment was accessed from a side door, and up a turning
stair.&nbsp; You</B>
<BR><B>came in the door to a landing, turned left and up half a flight
of stairs</B>
<BR><B>to another landing, and then turned 180 to go up the remainder of
stairs</B>
<BR><B>to our floor.&nbsp; There was no other way in or out of the apartment.</B>
<BR><B>Moving day was hot and chaotic, and we had a busy time of getting
all of</B>
<BR><B>our stuff into the upper level.&nbsp; A few things seemed to go
missing, but</B>
<BR><B>put it off to the chaos of two different sets of moves coming in
at one</B>
<BR><B>time.&nbsp; On about the second or third day, we started to clear
out a closet</B>
<BR><B>in the living room.&nbsp; It used to be a bedroom at one time, and
we decided</B>
<BR><B>we would use it to store our winter coats.&nbsp; Shoved up on the
top shelf of</B>
<BR><B>the closet was an old box, and in it we found a cool old air force
cap.</B>
<BR><B>My room-mate decided that this would be a cool addition to her wardrobe</B>
<BR><B>and promplty put it on for a lark.</B>
<BR><B>There was a small sunroom off the kitchen at the back of the house,
and we</B>
<BR><B>were all sitting out there cooling off a bit with a few friends,
when</B>
<BR><B>someone came back from the washroom to say they saw smoke in the
living</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; We all ran to the front of the house, and sure enough,
flames were</B>
<BR><B>coming out of the closet.&nbsp; It was only a small fire, and the
fire</B>
<BR><B>department arrived quickly to put it out.&nbsp; Only ONE coat was
damaged, and</B>
<BR><B>the firemen could only attribute the fire to possibly old electrical
wire</B>
<BR><B>shorting out. The coat that burned was a bright red leather coat
belonging</B>
<BR><B>to my room mate.</B>
<BR><B>After that, things started to really heat up.&nbsp; Keys and combs
would go</B>
<BR><B>missing, and other small stuff.&nbsp; We would hear voices and footsteps
but we</B>
<BR><B>just attributed it initially to noisy neighbours downstairs.&nbsp;
Then we</B>
<BR><B>realized the noises were on OUR stairs!&nbsp; The funny thing was,
that you</B>
<BR><B>could hear the scrape of shoes on the old wood as the footsteps
moved up</B>
<BR><B>the stairs... but the stairs were covered in carpet!</B>
<BR><B>Then it was the ceiling lights going on and off by themselves.&nbsp;
We had the</B>
<BR><B>old kind of push button wall switches, so you really had to push
to turn</B>
<BR><B>them on or off.</B>
<BR><B>After living there for nearly a month we had a note in our mailbox
from</B>
<BR><B>our neighbours, a young couple downstairs.&nbsp; In the note, they
asked that</B>
<BR><B>we keep the noise down a bit, as the loud music at night and the
sound of</B>
<BR><B>footsteps were keeping them awake.&nbsp; Funny thing is, that we
hadn't been</B>
<BR><B>doing any of this.&nbsp; A few more days after this, and one of
them was at the</B>
<BR><B>door, asking if we left the water running in the tub because there
was</B>
<BR><B>water pouring into their kitchen cupboard.&nbsp; Of course we hadn't,
and we</B>
<BR><B>found out later that this water flowing into their cupboards stopped
and</B>
<BR><B>started a few times in spite of a plumber finding no cause for the
leak.</B>
<BR><B>We sort of got used to the footsteps, and waiting for our missing
keys to</B>
<BR><B>show up in plain sight.&nbsp; Sometimes I would be sitting in the
living room</B>
<BR><B>with friends, and they would hear the door and say "oh your room
mate is</B>
<BR><B>home" and I would have to listen to hear if the footsteps were scratchy
or</B>
<BR><B>not to know if it was my room mate or my ghost visitor.&nbsp; It
really freaked</B>
<BR><B>out my friends when the footsteps would stop and there was no one
there.</B>
<BR><B>We heard from the old lady next door that there had been a murder
in the</B>
<BR><B>driveway there, but we really never found out what was the cause
of our</B>
<BR><B>ghostly visitor.</B>
<BR><B>I stayed there in that apartment for only a year, and then moved
in with</B>
<BR><B>my boyfriend.&nbsp; My roomates left not long after. The house is
still there,</B>
<BR><B>and I drive by it sometimes but I have no idea if the house is still</B>
<BR><B>haunted.&nbsp; My roomate got rid of the hat by the way.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Ghostly Visitors</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dswann2@csc.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi There,</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've been reading a few of the stories on your Shadowlands website
and</B>
<BR><B>decided that I should let you know some of my encounters with the
"other"</B>
<BR><B>side.</B>
<BR><B>My earliest recollection of a visitor is probably when I was about
5 or 6</B>
<BR><B>years old.&nbsp; I remember waking up very early one morning and
looking toward</B>
<BR><B>the end of my bed.&nbsp; There standing and watching me was a tall
man wearing a</B>
<BR><B>long black coat and top hat.&nbsp; He had a longish face and grey
hair.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>remember calling my father but before he could arrive,the man was
gone.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>father assured me I had been dreaming.&nbsp; I never saw the man
again, but</B>
<BR><B>years later my father told me that my description of the man fit
that of my</B>
<BR><B>great grandfather.</B>
<BR><B>On another occasion I was staying over at my brother's apartment
and</B>
<BR><B>sleeping in his bedroom.&nbsp; His month old baby daughter was asleep
in her cot</B>
<BR><B>alongside the bed.&nbsp; I remember waking up slowly and looking
over at the</B>
<BR><B>cot.&nbsp; There, standing looking down at the baby&nbsp; was an
old lady.&nbsp; She</B>
<BR><B>looked at me, put her finger to her mouth to quiet me and smiled.&nbsp;
Then she</B>
<BR><B>was gone.&nbsp; To this day I believe that the lady I saw was my
sister-in-law's</B>
<BR><B>grandmother who had passed away a few months before the baby was
born.</B>
<BR><B>I would often lay in my bed as a young teenager and hear scratching
sounds</B>
<BR><B>coming from the old sewing machine cabinet in my bedroom.&nbsp;
I was always too</B>
<BR><B>afraid to look directly at the cabinet in case I saw someone there.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>noises stopped as soon as the cabinet was moved to another room.&nbsp;
Could</B>
<BR><B>there have been something there?&nbsp; I'll never know.</B>
<BR><B>My boyfriend (now husband) and I had been living together for a
few months</B>
<BR><B>in an apartment close to the beach in Cape Town when I began to
sense a</B>
<BR><B>presence in the living room.&nbsp; One evening we were lying on
the sofa,</B>
<BR><B>becoming amorous, when I suddenly heard a childs voice.&nbsp; I
looked over his</B>
<BR><B>shoulder toward the middle of the room and saw a body hanging from
the</B>
<BR><B>ceiling.&nbsp; The body had no feet, they had been burnt away.&nbsp;
Around the body</B>
<BR><B>there were four children (ranging from 4 - 8) dancing and singing.&nbsp;
I could</B>
<BR><B>not make out the song they were singing but it sounded like a child's</B>
<BR><B>nursery rhyme.&nbsp; I screamed and pushed my boyfriend away from
me trying to</B>
<BR><B>tell him to look.&nbsp; When finally he did, the body and the children
were</B>
<BR><B>gone.&nbsp; I must admit that this was the first time that one of
my "visitor's"</B>
<BR><B>had scared me.&nbsp; I refused from then on to go into the living
room and</B>
<BR><B>eventually we moved from the apartment.</B>
<BR><B>After my husband and I had our first baby, we moved into an apartment
in a</B>
<BR><B>slightly run down area of Cape Town.&nbsp; The apartment was on
the third floor</B>
<BR><B>and was large and airy.&nbsp; Entering from the front door you would
have our</B>
<BR><B>bedroom on the immediate left and straight down the passage was
my baby</B>
<BR><B>son's bedroom.&nbsp; Things started happening almost from the time
we moved in</B>
<BR><B>to the apartment.&nbsp; At night when my baby woke up I would hear
footsteps</B>
<BR><B>rushing down the passage toward his room.&nbsp; It sounded like
a woman's</B>
<BR><B>footsteps - a woman wearing a long gown or dress.&nbsp; I would
enter the room</B>
<BR><B>only to find that the baby had quietened and lay looking up at ME?&nbsp;
This</B>
<BR><B>would be a nightly happening and it strangely enough never ever
bothered</B>
<BR><B>either my husband (yes, he would hear it as well) nor me.&nbsp;
Then a month or</B>
<BR><B>two later we started hearing another sound in the room.&nbsp; It
was a strange</B>
<BR><B>sound like something rubbing against a metal pipe.&nbsp; Our son
would wake up</B>
<BR><B>hearing this and would cry until I took him out of the room.&nbsp;
On these</B>
<BR><B>occasions the ghostly steps would rush faster than normal to the
bedroom.</B>
<BR><B>My baby was a year old when we moved from this apartment.&nbsp;
The day we were</B>
<BR><B>moving out I went over to our neighbour to say goodbye.&nbsp; While
having a cup</B>
<BR><B>of tea with her she asked us whether we had ever experienced anything</B>
<BR><B>peculiar in the apartment.&nbsp; When we told her about the rubbing
sound, she</B>
<BR><B>looked quite stricken and then told us that the apartment had been
vacant</B>
<BR><B>for about a year before we moved in.&nbsp; The reason being that
the previous</B>
<BR><B>occupant had committed suicide in the back bedroom - he had hanged
himself</B>
<BR><B>from the pipes in the ceiling!&nbsp; She could not give us any explanation
of</B>
<BR><B>the footsteps in the passage but I like to believe that it was my
maternal</B>
<BR><B>grandmother that was looking after us.&nbsp; The reason being, she
was the only</B>
<BR><B>person I knew who wore a long dressing gown made of a swishing type
of</B>
<BR><B>material and the steps had a slight limp - just as she did.&nbsp;
Thank-you Ma!</B>
<BR><B>We moved from that apartment into my paternal grandmother's house.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>family had moved her to a frail care institution after my grandfathers</B>
<BR><B>death and we rented the house from my uncle.&nbsp; The house had
been in the</B>
<BR><B>family for at least 40 years - my father and his brother and sisters
grew</B>
<BR><B>up there.&nbsp; It was a wonderful old house and I loved it dearly
along with</B>
<BR><B>all its faults and ghosts.&nbsp; I can remember as a child my uncle
Dirk saying</B>
<BR><B>to his wife that they needed to leave the house before dark and
now I know</B>
<BR><B>why.&nbsp; If ever a house was haunted, this one was. We would often
wake up at</B>
<BR><B>night hearing a child playing in the passage and often my son (2/3
years</B>
<BR><B>old at this time) would run down the passage laughing and playing.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>minute he reached the entrance to the kitchen (which was at the
back of the</B>
<BR><B>house) he would start crying.&nbsp; We later found out that the
kitchen and back</B>
<BR><B>bathroom had been built on to the house long after the original
house had</B>
<BR><B>been built.&nbsp; My son never appeared to be afraid of the child
that he on</B>
<BR><B>some evenings would play with.&nbsp; I only saw her once.&nbsp;
I went to his room to</B>
<BR><B>cover him with his blankets and looked toward the bay window - there
in the</B>
<BR><B>shadow I saw a little girl dressed in a longish dress that appeared
to have</B>
<BR><B>a lace trimmed bodice.&nbsp; She had long hair tied in two pigtails
and carried</B>
<BR><B>a little doll.&nbsp; Before I could do or say anything she dissapeared.&nbsp;
We</B>
<BR><B>never found out who she was but she became almost part of the family
and</B>
<BR><B>did us no harm.&nbsp; Some days we would come home and find toys
randomly</B>
<BR><B>scattered throughout the house as if someone had been playing with
them.</B>
<BR><B>There was a long brick shelf in the formal lounge that I had arranged
some</B>
<BR><B>novels on.&nbsp; Every now and then one of the books would fly of
the shelf onto</B>
<BR><B>the floor.&nbsp; Surprisingly it was always the same book, The Exorcist.&nbsp;
We</B>
<BR><B>were never afraid of any of our paranormal visitors though.&nbsp;
Often we would</B>
<BR><B>also see my grandparents wondering through the garden or glimpse
them in</B>
<BR><B>the house.&nbsp; My mother being sceptical would say we were being
fanciful</B>
<BR><B>until the day she saw something and could'nt explain it away.&nbsp;
She and my</B>
<BR><B>dad were alone in the house.&nbsp; She was way in the back of the
house doing</B>
<BR><B>laundry when from the corner of her eye she saw what she assumed
was my</B>
<BR><B>father walking past her into the kitchen.&nbsp; She called out to
him to make</B>
<BR><B>some coffee.&nbsp; When he didn't answer she walked into the kitchen
to ask him</B>
<BR><B>again.&nbsp; There was no-one there! When she called him my father
came from the</B>
<BR><B>garden at the back of the house - there was no way that he could
have</B>
<BR><B>passed her before.&nbsp; Strange - no just my grand-dad.&nbsp; Other
things happened</B>
<BR><B>in the house as well, but I fear I may end up writing a novel about
our</B>
<BR><B>experiences if I continued now.</B>
<BR><B>Both my husband and I have experienced other paranormal events in
and</B>
<BR><B>around the houses we have lived in.&nbsp; Most people are skeptical
when we tell</B>
<BR><B>them our stories but I truly believe that there is another world
out there</B>
<BR><B>and often they are in parallel to each other.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>A Visitation in Church</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: angelena.boden@blueyonder.co.uk</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am writing to you in a state of deep grief. After a cruel and abusive
marriage of 20 years I fell in love with a man of 65 earlier this year.
He was our organist and music director in church. He helped me to sing
again, built my confidence and loved me dearly. We were soul mates.</B>
<BR><B>On December 17th at 2.00 om (UK time) he came to see me. We had
a wonderful afternoon together, talking, listening to the music of our
forthcoming carol service in which I was to sing solo. Later on he went
home, rang to say what a perfect afternoon it was, how much he loved me
and how much I had changed his life. Fifteen minutes later he was dead
of a massive cerebral aneuryism. I am heartbroken and don't want to carry
on living. I vowed never to sing again, especially in the carol service.
I got some strength from somewhere and as I did sing felt wrapped in the
warmth of his arms. Hysteria I thought.</B>
<BR><B>My daughter, a down to earth student at Cambridge University, later
told me that she had seen him come into church and sit down with her to
watch me sing. She was terrified at first because ghosts are not part of
her ( or my) belief system. She said he was so happy to see me and I looked
so full of an ethereal spirit it was surreal to her.</B>
<BR><B>At the end of the service he left.</B>

<P><B>I Have a Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: fred@lvcm.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My mother's house was built in the 50's. During that time a group
of people inhabited the house. My mother told me that when she bought the
house, she walked into a room , and saw writing on the wall in red, and
satanic signs, and was told that a satanic group had lived in the house.
A man was supposedly sacrificed. One morning my mother and her boyfriend
were watching TV in their room, when they both suddenly looked at the door
, and saw a headless man in the doorway, just standing there. Then he just
disappeared.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Also, one night I was home alone , getting ready to go out
with friends, when I reached for the door handle, the back door opened,
then closed, as I started to walk back, the front door did the same, as
well as the side door.&nbsp; Then all the doors began to open and close.
That's when I grabbed my things, and ran out. I guess he just wanted company?</B><B></B>

<BR><B>True Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: vaelyn@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My house is haunted by a ghost named Charlie and at least one (probably</B>
<BR><B>more) ghost kitty. Charlie was the husband of the previous owner.
He died</B>
<BR><B>from cancer in the master bedroom. The kitties are probably some
of the cats</B>
<BR><B>we've had who have died. My mother has said she has heard someone
call out</B>
<BR><B>her name when no one else was around and has felt someone get in
the bed</B>
<BR><B>when she was alone. My father has felt ghost kitties get on the
bed and has</B>
<BR><B>felt Charlie poke him in the back. When my parents were fixing up
the master</B>
<BR><B>bedroom they took pictures of their progress. A weird ghostly fog
appears in</B>
<BR><B>three of the pictures. My sisters have seen shadows of Charlie around.
My</B>
<BR><B>older sister has felt the ghost kitties. Their friends have seen
a strange</B>
<BR><B>man with a baseball cap (Charlie wore a cap when he was getting</B>
<BR><B>chemotherapy). I have had Charlie wake me by whispering my name.
He once</B>
<BR><B>jumped on my bed nearly knocked me out of it. He has made music
come from</B>
<BR><B>the window fan. And the ghost kitties have started climbing on my
bed (I</B>
<BR><B>probably sound like a raving lunatic but I swear this is all true).</B>

<P><B>Strange House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:sedks@iland.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I lived in a house that strange things would happen in, I thought
it was just me. One time I had closed the curtains in my kitchen and I
would go in 10 mins later and they would be open. At first I thought that
maybe my husband was opening them up.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it would happen when
I was the only one home, me and my daughter and she couldn't reach the
curtains.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was only 2.&nbsp; One night I got up to feed
my other daughter, and I didn't turn any lights on because I didn't want
to wake up my 2 yr old. I was sitting in my front room, which you can see
into the kitchen from it.&nbsp; I heard a noise in the kitchen it was the
refrigerator door opening and I could even see the light from it. I thought
I didn't get it shut all the way, but then it slammed shut. I had goose
bumps all over.&nbsp; Something had opened and shut my refrigerator door
and I couldn't excuse that. How could I? I was the only one awake there
was nobody else who could of done it.&nbsp; Anyway I told my husband about
it and he thought I was crazy.&nbsp; But one night I had a friend over
and I was telling her about it.&nbsp; And she had babysitted for me before
and she told me of a time that she was watching my kids and a little music
box in my daughters crib kept going off and no one was in that room.&nbsp;
She said that she checked it for the voice activation because she was going
to turn it off, but it was on the manual setting not the voice activation.
She said she'd never said anything because she didn't want me to think
she was losing it.&nbsp; After that talk we went in the kitchen and I closed
the curtins and I said now wait, we went back in the front room and we
BOTH stayed there, noone was in the kitchen, after about 10 mins. we went
back in the kitchen and the curtains were open. It was unexplainable. We
didn't live there very long.&nbsp; About 2 months after we moved out it
caught fire and the owners tore it down.</B>

<P><B>Scottsdale AZ</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: brennerdunn@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>It's been 25 years later since this expierence I'm about to tell,
but the</B>
<BR><B>memory will not leave me. Back in 1975, my folks moved us to Scottsdale
AZ.</B>
<BR><B>We moved into a rented 2 story house that was over a 100 years old.
My folks</B>
<BR><B>were never told of any "problems", however the neighbors knew all
about it.</B>
<BR><B>Four days after we moved in the "welcome wagon" came over to greet
us and</B>
<BR><B>welcome us to the nieghborhood. One striking comment stood out during
my</B>
<BR><B>mother's conversation. "Living in a haunted house doesn't bother
you, huh?"</B>
<BR><B>My family laughed it off, and I later learned the landlord never
disclosed</B>
<BR><B>that fact. For the first 10 days nothing seemed out of the ordinary,
after</B>
<BR><B>that, windows were open, lights would be on when we would come home
from an</B>
<BR><B>outting. My dad used to yell at my mom and me for leaving the lights
on, and</B>
<BR><B>windows open before leaving the house! Soon afterwards it became
a ritual to</B>
<BR><B>check the windows, lights, doors etc...before leaving. When we came
back</B>
<BR><B>home Viola!, lights on, windows open, even after my dad had personally</B>
<BR><B>verified they were off, locked, closed, etc... My dad thought someone
was</B>
<BR><B>playing a joke on us. Then things got stranger and more convincing.
Around</B>
<BR><B>our second week, our dog, a black lab, would start barking at "nothing",</B>
<BR><B>would refuse to go into certain rooms at different times, and yelp
for no</B>
<BR><B>apparent reason. A short time after that, lights would come on by</B>
<BR><B>themselves, along with faucets, door slamming, and even the occasional</B>
<BR><B>toilet flushing by itself. I remember at least two instances where
I was</B>
<BR><B>watching TV in the living room, by myself, and the lamp by the couch
clicked</B>
<BR><B>on by itself. Many times, door slams, and the faucets turning on,
would</B>
<BR><B>happen with company over. Never the less, most of my friends refused
to come</B>
<BR><B>over there anymore. I don't remember if there were any cold spots
and things</B>
<BR><B>of that nature, but I do remember the family seeing a apparition
in the</B>
<BR><B>shape of a man with a cowboy hat and jacket on. After that, my mother</B>
<BR><B>couldn't take it anymore and we moved less than 6 weeks from moving
in. I've</B>
<BR><B>always found "ghosts" interesting and have even tried to expierence
another</B>
<BR><B>contact, but I've had no success. Even living here in San Diego,
the so</B>
<BR><B>called "most haunted city in America". Well, that's my story, I
hoped you</B>
<BR><B>enjoyed it, and if you ever need someone to help with a investigation
in the</B>
<BR><B>San Diego area, I'd be more than willing to attend. Take care.</B>

<P><B>Are They Real</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: chalina77@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;This is about the 3rd time I've tried to send this</B>
<BR><B>story.&nbsp; The first two attempts, the e-mail window</B>
<BR><B>disappeared, so I don't even know if it was sent.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Anyway, here's my story....&nbsp; When I was little, my</B>
<BR><B>family moved a lot from one house to another.&nbsp; There</B>
<BR><B>are 9 of us in my family, me being the youngest.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>mother is very superstitious and now that I'm older</B>
<BR><B>(I'm 24 now), I understand why.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;When I was 7 years old, my parents bought a home that</B>
<BR><B>fit all of us in.&nbsp; It was a beautiful house but I</B>
<BR><B>found it to be very creepy.&nbsp; One evening during the</B>
<BR><B>summer, my parents were running late coming home from</B>
<BR><B>work.&nbsp; Two of my older brothers had to stay home with</B>
<BR><B>me.&nbsp; Before this day, weird things had already</B>
<BR><B>happened that the rest of my family had witnessed but</B>
<BR><B>I didn't.&nbsp; Until that time.&nbsp; I didn't believe my</B>
<BR><B>brothers when they told me that our house was haunted.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I thought it was ridiculous and being 7, what did</B>
<BR><B>haunted mean anyway.&nbsp; So I just ignored them.&nbsp; But</B>
<BR><B>they kept on pushing it on me and I just could not</B>
<BR><B>believe them and I think part of the reason was</B>
<BR><B>because I was starting to get scared.&nbsp; There was a</B>
<BR><B>radio on a kitchen table that my brother turned on and</B>
<BR><B>it came on loud, and then it suddenly turned off!&nbsp; He</B>
<BR><B>tried to turn it back on again but when he picked it</B>
<BR><B>up, the cord was dangling - - it wasn't even plugged</B>
<BR><B>in!!! We all screamed and ran into one of the</B>
<BR><B>bedrooms.&nbsp; After we all calmed down, I figured there</B>
<BR><B>must be batteries in there and thought they were</B>
<BR><B>playing a trick on me. When everyone came home that</B>
<BR><B>night my brothers told my parents what had happened</B>
<BR><B>and I told them that they were lieing and that there</B>
<BR><B>are probably batteries in there.&nbsp; Another one of my</B>
<BR><B>older brothers went to take a look at it there</B>
<BR><B>wasn't!!!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Throughout the years that we were there, we got to</B>
<BR><B>know our next door neighbors and so we would tell them</B>
<BR><B>about things that were happening.&nbsp; They told us that</B>
<BR><B>there had been 2 other families who had lived there</B>
<BR><B>and they didn't last for more than a year and that</B>
<BR><B>they had complained of ghostly presence as well. We</B>
<BR><B>stayed at that house for only about 3 years and</B>
<BR><B>decided to sell it.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;When I was 10, my grandmother had passed away.&nbsp; We</B>
<BR><B>were living in a small in-law at that time.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>remember vividly because it was when that movie</B>
<BR><B>Nightmare on Elm Street came out.&nbsp; We had a black out</B>
<BR><B>in our house.&nbsp; We didn't have candles because we</B>
<BR><B>weren't expecting it to happen, but the smell of it</B>
<BR><B>was all over the place.&nbsp; We had nothing else to do so</B>
<BR><B>we turned in and went to bed.&nbsp; The smell of candles</B>
<BR><B>were pretty strong in the girls bedroom so I decided</B>
<BR><B>to sleep out in the living room.&nbsp; When morning came,</B>
<BR><B>one of my brothers woke everyone up screaming.&nbsp; When</B>
<BR><B>we all went into the boys bedroom, one of them was on</B>
<BR><B>the floor with his pillows and blanket nicely placed.</B>
<BR><B>We didn't understand what was going on, but he</B>
<BR><B>explained to us that he had slept on the bed that</B>
<BR><B>night so he doesn't know how he got on the floor.&nbsp; Our</B>
<BR><B>rooms were really tiny so it would be really</B>
<BR><B>uncomfortable for him to sleep on the floor.&nbsp; He was</B>
<BR><B>really puzzled and he said that he dreamed of our</B>
<BR><B>grandmother talking to him but he couldn't hear what</B>
<BR><B>she was saying.&nbsp; A few minutes later, our doorbell</B>
<BR><B>rang and it was our cousins there to deliver the bad</B>
<BR><B>news - - apparently, our grandmother passed away the</B>
<BR><B>night before!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;One last experience I had was when I was 15. My</B>
<BR><B>parents, my boyfriend and my brother and wife were</B>
<BR><B>sitting in the living room watching a movie.&nbsp; I had a</B>
<BR><B>little nephew who was about 2 years old.&nbsp; He was</B>
<BR><B>playing in the hallway with a ball.&nbsp; The ball had</B>
<BR><B>rolled into my bedroom.&nbsp; It wasn't very dark yet at</B>
<BR><B>that time so he could've just ran in and got it but he</B>
<BR><B>was hesitant to go in there.&nbsp; He just looked at me and</B>
<BR><B>pointed at his ball as if he wanted me to get it for</B>
<BR><B>him.&nbsp; I found that really odd.&nbsp; I told him to go ahead</B>
<BR><B>and get it but he refused to.&nbsp; I got up and stood next</B>
<BR><B>to him by the doorway and he ran in and picked it up</B>
<BR><B>really fast and as he was running out of my room, he</B>
<BR><B>was looking back as if someone was standing there. I</B>
<BR><B>felt creeps crawl up my spine.&nbsp; My sister in-laws</B>
<BR><B>mother came to visit us and stayed for a while and she</B>
<BR><B>told us that she felt spirits living there with us.</B>
<BR><B>We since then have moved (again).</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Anyway, I really love your web-site because I now</B>
<BR><B>have a place where I know I can relate to people and</B>
<BR><B>some of the stories I read are similar to my own</B>
<BR><B>experiences.&nbsp; Keep up the good work!&nbsp; and thanks....</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Ghost Encounter</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: grebo2k@yahoo.co.uk</B><B></B>

<P><B>One day whilst walking my dog to the Blue Lagoon- a big lake a mile
from my house, I was going through some bushes near the brook when I saw
a boy curled up on the grass with his knees drawn up to his chest.</B>
<BR><B>I really and truly thought he was dead, because he was so still-and
appeared not to see us, and i wondered if he needed help,so I asked if
he was alright.I suspected he was a boy on drugs at first, from the vacant
look in his eyes.</B>
<BR><B>He said he was fine and when I asked his name-he said Sam.I carried
on walking, thinking nothing of it, and a couple of minutes later my dog
pulled me to an old stone set of steps, once leading to Bishop-Parker school
field.</B>
<BR><B>I noticed there were a lot of old grave-headings around,which was
odd because there is no graveyard there. When i kicked one with my foot
my heart stopped.It said Sam Golding, 15/4/1988- 5/9/2000.There was a picture
set into the heading and i swear it looked exactly like Sam- the boy we
had spoken to moments ago.With that I ran with my dog back to the spot
where the boy had just been, and he was gone.....even though i looked everywhere
i couldn't find him, and believe me no-one, however fast they were, could
have got away that fast, because the river-walk is too long.I never saw
Sam again.......</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Haunted Shoe Store</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: annemercedes01@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I had just been promoted to manager of a national shoe store and
took over the store on Burnet Road in Austin, Texas.&nbsp; An Assistant
Manager was already there and she made me feel welcome but there was a
certain "feeling" I had about her and the store.&nbsp; Months go by and
she had resigned and things started happening.&nbsp; I have had experiences
like this before but always seem to think I am crazy.&nbsp; There were
stools up and down each aisle with mirrors on each side.&nbsp; They were
quite heavy stools but every&nbsp; now and then one of them would just
topple over.&nbsp; Shoes were placed inside their boxes with the tops underneath
on racks and they would just fall out of the racks.&nbsp; Sometimes when
I would arrive at the store in the mornings, the store would be a mess
as if it were ransacked.&nbsp; I would get onto the girls about cleaning
up the store before they left at nights and they would insist the store
was in perfect shape before leaving.&nbsp; All along I never said anything
to anyone else about the strange happenings.&nbsp; I would get phone calls
from the business next door asking me to stop making so much noise during
the early hours (around 7am) because of patients.&nbsp; I was never there
that early in the morning and explained that to them but cooperated anyway.&nbsp;
After a month of hiring a new assistant manager, I was in the back room
doing paperwork and she came to me wanting to talk to me about something.&nbsp;
She was going to leave because she too had noticed strange things going
on and was afraid.&nbsp; Finally someone else was experiencing the same
things I had!&nbsp; I called a meeting of the two other workers and asked
if they had noticed any strange things going on in the store.&nbsp; They
said yes and were afraid.&nbsp; I said ok let's name this "ghost" and each
day when we come in just say hi to him.&nbsp; No one wanted to participate
in naming him so I did.&nbsp; I called him Jeffrey.&nbsp; Things seemed
to calm down after that but still my assistant manager wanted to leave.&nbsp;
I soon hired another girl for assistant manager and told the other employees
not to say a word to her about what has been going on.&nbsp; One night
she calls me in hysterics from her house and says I have to go lock up
the store because there was something or someone in there.&nbsp; I calmed
her down and asked what happened.&nbsp; You see, the braker switches are
in the back room and you have to turn them off before leaving each night
and walk through a dark store to get to the front door.&nbsp; She explained
she checked the store to make sure no one was in there, went to the back
room and turned off the lights and was walking down the aisle to the front
door when she heard someone walking in the store.&nbsp; She thought a customer
had somehow still been in the store and called out to them and no answer.&nbsp;
She started walking back to the front when someone was walking behind her
and she quickly turned around to find no one there.&nbsp; It scared her
so badly that she just took out of the store without even locking it.&nbsp;
I finally told her about things that had happened in the store but she
still was not comfortable.&nbsp; One day the original assistant manager
walks in and all I said to her was why didn't you tell me about him.&nbsp;
She knew exactly what I had been talking about.&nbsp; She said she knew
I could feel that something was there and thought it not worth mentioning
and that the presence grew stronger since I started working there.&nbsp;
Time passes and I am onto another job when I get a phone call from the
last assistant manager who is now manager of the store.&nbsp; She told
me a story that sent a chill down my spine.&nbsp; The district manager
came to the store to tell her they had decided to move the store in a different
location.&nbsp; She said good because this one was haunted anyway.&nbsp;
The district manager said you know you are the second person who has told
me that.&nbsp; The first being the manager before myself.&nbsp; He told
her that a guy used to work at this store and his girlfriend worked for
the same company but at a different location.&nbsp; She committed suicide
and the police arrested him for thinking that maybe he killed her.&nbsp;
After the investigation it was determined that she in fact did kill herself
so the boyfriend was let go.&nbsp; Some days later he was so distraught
about losing her that he killed himself.&nbsp; This boy that worked in
the same store years before I had.... his name was Jeffrey.&nbsp; My name
is Anne and so was the name of his girlfriend.</B>
<BR><B>I had disturbances in my home soon thereafter and asked him to leave
and he did.&nbsp; Of every home I have been in, I have always had paranormal
activity and have just learned to live with it.&nbsp; Anyway, hope this
story is something you may be interested in.&nbsp; Thanks for your great

<BR><B>THe House of Evil</B><B></B>

<P><B>The House of evil is a Brooklyn Brownstone apartment, that's haunted
by</B>
<BR><B>evil spirits. Many strange, and unexplained events have happened
to me, and</B>
<BR><B>my family in the past 10 years. The building is haunted from top
to bottom,</B>
<BR><B>but</B>
<BR><B>the top floor seems to be the center of activity of this house.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had many encounters with spirits, my first
experience happened in</B>
<BR><B>the summer of 1990, when i saw strange balls of green lights, moving
across</B>
<BR><B>my sister's bedroom. In Feb. 1994, after the big snowstorm, my brother-in
law,</B>
<BR><B>who lived across the street from my house, was looking out of his
top floor</B>
<BR><B>window that afternoon, and he saw, with his own eyes, an apparition
of a 19th-</B>
<BR><B>century man, who looked as if he was shoveling snow off the roof.
At least a</B>
<BR><B>half an hour later, during investigation, by my father, and my brother-in
law,</B>
<BR><B>they were spooked to find no footprints, or obvious signs of shoveling
on the</B>
<BR><B>rooftop. My other experience, occured on a hot August night in 1993,
my</B>
<BR><B>sister,</B>
<BR><B>and i were talking, in the living room, and we both heard a door
slam shut,</B>
<BR><B>as if</B>
<BR><B>someone entered our top floor apartment, and we heard it, not once,
but a</B>
<BR><B>number of times. there's alot more to my true ghost story,</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Voice on the Dance Floor</B><B></B>

<P><B>A story to those who hear voices.&nbsp; This happened to me a few
years ago, on my birthday.&nbsp; My friend took me to this club in Toronto,
Canada.&nbsp; It's called Whiskey Siagon and has 3 floors.&nbsp; My bud
had been there before and said this was a great place. With excitement,
we went to the second floor where they play rock.&nbsp; He went to go and
get me a drink while I waited against a pole.&nbsp; No sooner than he was
out of site I leened back on the pole to take in the tunes when I heard
a voice.&nbsp; A mans voice.&nbsp; I thaught someone was behind me trying
to get my attention, but when I looked, no one was there. I heard the voice
again, louder this time as if right beside me, in my head even, saying,,,</B>
<BR><B>"It would be so easy to kill someone in here.&nbsp; So easy."&nbsp;
I looked around again and only saw people dancing. It repeated, but this
time with instructions...</B>
<BR><B>"All you have to do is stab them in the back going up to peirce
the lung, they can't make a sound. You just lay them near a wall and people
will just think the guy is passed out. It'll take all night before they
notice, and you could be long gone and no one would know the wiser. Yeah,
easy."&nbsp; My eyes were showing all the whites by the time my friend
came back from the bar.&nbsp; He said I didn't look so good.&nbsp; I asked
if there was somewhere else we could go and he took me upstairs.&nbsp;
Later that night I told him what happened and why I couldn't stay.&nbsp;
As odd a story as he found it, the more he thaught about it, he said it
would probably work.&nbsp; That's the quiet kind of stuff my bud learned
in the army.&nbsp; I no longer go to that club and often get bad vibes
and other strange voices when I'm in the city.&nbsp; Has this happened
to anyone else?</B>
