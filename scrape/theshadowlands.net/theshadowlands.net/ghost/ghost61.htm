<P>
<P><B> This is a true story, as we are still dumbfounded as to what
happened.</B>
<P><B>My niece and nephew Were spending the weekend with my husband and I.
At</B>
<P><B>age 12 and 9, both children liked to tell and hear spook storys . Me
and</B>
<P><B>my niece Stephanie needed to go to the grocery store, to pick up a
few</B>
<P><B>odds and ends. On the way out the door, I said to Stephanie..." We</B>
<P><B>should take Chris (Her lttle brother) back behind this old convent,</B>
<P><B>where there is a Graveyard, and we can all tell scary stories. My</B>
<P><B>husband over heard us and said..."Don't go back there today it is to</B>
<P><B>dark and dangerous, for you three alone.  We said,"Ok we won't", and</B>
<P><B>promised not to go.</B>
<P><B>Little Chris decided to stay home, so Stephanie and I were on our way
to</B>
<P><B>pick up some goodies for the fellows. </B>
<P><B>      Forgetting the promise we made, we headed for the graveyard</B>
<P><B>anyway. When we got behind the convent, it loked unusually
dark,maybee</B>
<P><B>due to the stormy weather earlier in the day. As we drove toward the</B>
<P><B>graveyard we noticed two people, a young man and lady , walking
toward</B>
<P><B>us in the middle of the street, they were dressed in white, and
slowing</B>
<P><B>the car down, I thought in my mind...that it was strange for them
both</B>
<P><B>to be dressed in the same manner and in all white clothing.  They
walked</B>
<P><B>to the side of the road and as I passed them we noticed the road
ahead</B>
<P><B>looked darker and darker, so we decided to turn the car around,and
not</B>
<P><B>go into the graveyard. Now this had been a matter of only a few
seconds,</B>
<P><B>and as i turned the car around, Stephanie said," Aunt pam, where are</B>
<P><B>those two people that were on the road?". We did a quick, frantic</B>
<P><B>search: There was an open field, no cars nearby, no dark shrubs or</B>
<P><B>trees, in other words, no place for them to hide or not be seen by
us ,</B>
<P><B>if they were really there. We both became extremely frightened by the</B>
<P><B>event that just happened, but decided to go to the grocery store,
then</B>
<P><B>head home like nothing happened.</B>
<P><B>When we  got to the store,which is usually open 24 hours a day, the</B>
<P><B>doors were locked, although the lights were on but no-one would let
us</B>
<P><B>in. By this time we were really scared and food or no food, we
decided</B>
<P><B>to go home. On telling my husband this story he replied," Maybe they</B>
<P><B>were your gardian Angels, because you had promised not to go back</B>
<P><B>there"! ...While we were talking, Stephanie had picked up the tv
remote,</B>
<P><B>and was flipping through the stations...each station that she stopped
at</B>
<P><B>said either that," Angels were watching you or someone up there was</B>
<P><B>gaurding you", by then we were both screaming and my husband said,"
Calm</B>
<P><B>down, i'll get you a glass of warm milk" and then I said to him..."
I'll</B>
<P><B>do it, i'll get us both a glass ". As my husband opened the fridge,
to</B>
<P><B>get the milk, I reached into a cupboard, for the mugs, and came out
with</B>
<P><B>an old mug that we had not seen for years... my husband grabbed it
and</B>
<P><B>said," Whats this ". When he turned  the mug around, there, barely</B>
<P><B>visible...was a picture of two angels a young man and lady, both
dressed</B>
<P><B>in white...To end our story, we have never yet been back to that</B>
<P><B>graveyard again, and we truely believe in angels.   </B>

<H3><B><A NAME=sri>Sri Lanka House</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:  pdudd@cyberus.ca</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is an actual experience that I had when I was twelve and living
in</B>
<P><B>Sri Lanka with my parents, who were doing development work. We lived
in</B>
<P><B>a very large old house with several bedrooms. We rented it from a
family</B>
<P><B>who had moved out of the country and it had an attic which was
locked,</B>
<P><B>although the family assured us that we could use it for storage space</B>
<P><B>while we lived in the house. The house was divided into wings,</B>
<P><B>accessible by separate staircases. My parents and my brother had</B>
<P><B>bedrooms in one wing of the house, while my room and the rooms of the</B>
<P><B>nanny, driver and housekeeper that we had were in another. The house
had</B>
<P><B>a very strange feel to it, and indeed, it was constructed in a
strange</B>
<P><B>way - it had several small shrines in various alcoves to Hindu Gods,
as</B>
<P><B>well as an indoor open air garden that made it rain in our living
room</B>
<P><B>and let in swarms of insects.</B>
<P><B>    The supernatural aspect of the house did not become apparent
until</B>
<P><B>we had lived there for almost a year. It began with a late night</B>
<P><B>disturbance that the servants and I began to notice in the early
hours</B>
<P><B>of the morning. Large houses in Sri Lanka are walled in to prevent</B>
<P><B>theft, and almost always have a heavy metal sliding garage door, to</B>
<P><B>allow cars to enter, and seal off the house to intruders. These doors</B>
<P><B>were very heavy, and I certainly could not pull it back alone at age
12.</B>
<P><B>Also they made an immense racket when opened. I began to be woken up
by</B>
<P><B>a loud clanging of  what sounded like garage doors being pulled back
and</B>
<P><B>pushed forward rapidly, all over the neighborhood, between 3 and 4
am</B>
<P><B>every morning. After a few nights I mentioned it to my parents, who
said</B>
<P><B>that they had not heard a thing. The noise continued every night for</B>
<P><B>about a week, until I asked our driver if he had heard it. he said
that</B>
<P><B>he had, and had gotten out of bed on several occasions to see what
was</B>
<P><B>happening in the neighborhood, but when he went outside there was no
one</B>
<P><B>on the street, and he could no longer hear the noise, although the
nanny</B>
<P><B>claimed she had heard it all the while he was gone.</B>
<P><B>    That was the first of the strange occurrences of the house.
Although</B>
<P><B>there was nothing definite I could put my finger on, the house had
a</B>
<P><B>strange atmosphere, and I began to feel as if someone were watching
me</B>
<P><B>while I was alone in my room.</B>
<P><B>    The next occurrence was a sad one. Our nanny, Pushup, was married
to</B>
<P><B>the driver. She became pregnant while living with us, and continued
to</B>
<P><B>work as a nanny to my brother and myself. My family trusted her</B>
<P><B>completely and felt her and her husband to be part of our family. One</B>
<P><B>day, while she was about 5 months pregnant, she was walking up the</B>
<P><B>stairs to her room carrying a glass bottle of water. From the living</B>
<P><B>room, my family and I heard her scream, and the bottle break. Found</B>
<P><B>unconscious, she was rushed to the hospital, where she lost her</B>
<P><B>otherwise healthy baby. She claimed to have seen a small figure hover</B>
<P><B>down the stairs towards her, and felt a cold hand touch the back of
her</B>
<P><B>neck before she fainted. We knew Pushpa as a completely trustworthy
and</B>
<P><B>levelheaded person, who would not be likely to fabricate a story.</B>
<P><B>    Pushpa's sister Rani came to stay with her during her recovery,
and</B>
<P><B>to help her around the house. Meanwhile, the nighttime clanging
seemed</B>
<P><B>to have subsided, and we didn't think much about it. Several months</B>
<P><B>after Rani arrived, Pushpa's husband woke my parents, and told them
to</B>
<P><B>come quickly into their rooms as Rani was very ill. I was not allowed</B>
<P><B>into the room, but my parents told me later what was wrong with Rani.</B>
<P><B>She was convulsing, with her back arched, and both Pushpa and her</B>
<P><B>husband were required to keep her lying down. My mother has medical</B>
<P><B>training, and assessed that she was not having an epileptic seizure,
but</B>
<P><B>was reluctant to send her to a hospital as there was a curfew on that</B>
<P><B>night. (Sri Lanka is in the grip of a civil war, and those who broke</B>
<P><B>terrorist imposed curfews were likely to be in some danger). Rani was</B>
<P><B>speaking frantically in a strange language that Pushpa said was
neither</B>
<P><B>Sinhala or Tamil, but a language she had never heard before, spitting
at</B>
<P><B>those in the room and grinning hysterically.</B>
<P><B>Finally, Rani fell asleep, and my parents and the servants took turns</B>
<P><B>watching her in the night. The next day she claimed to feel better
and</B>
<P><B>have no memory of what had happened the night before. Later in the</B>
<P><B>afternoon, while Pushpa was busy, she ran away. Pushpa contacted</B>
<P><B>everyone she knew, but we never heard from her again.</B>
<P><B>    We moved soon after that occurrence. Other than the things I</B>
<P><B>mentioned, the only strange things about the house were that more
often</B>
<P><B>that normal we would lose or mislay various small possessions. After
we</B>
<P><B>moved from the house, it remained vacant for at least the two years
we</B>
<P><B>remained in the country. My whole family was glad to move away, as
we</B>
<P><B>all said that we felt depressed when alone in the house. The next
house</B>
<P><B>we lived in was completely unremarkable in terms of the supernatural.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=time>A Life Time of Ghosts </A></B>
</H3><P><B>By: philocrates@acsworld.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>My first Ghost was one on my Grandfather's farm.  During the first</B>
<P><B>settlement of the area in PA [1740ish] the first grant owner's sister
went</B>
<P><B>to get the cow.  However the Indian's in the area had taken the cowbell
off</B>
<P><B>and were ringing it.  They scalped her.  She was buried where she died
in a</B>
<P><B>field near the main house.  On a calm summer night we could hear the</B>
<P><B>cowbell.  Even those who didn't believe could hear it.  They still
didn't</B>
<P><B>believe in Ghosts but it scared the daylights out of them.  It always</B>
<P><B>stayed just ahead of you.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In the woods above the house [on top of a hill] there was always
shadow</B>
<P><B>shapes moving at the very edge.  I was strictly forbidden to go up
there</B>
<P><B>and it was strong enough that I didn't. [Which is strange because I
was</B>
<P><B>always doing what I shouldn't]  I found out later when I was in my
teens</B>
<P><B>there use to be a house there.  No one would ever tell me what happened
to it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My Grandmother appeared  after she died to me.  She was basically my
mother</B>
<P><B>and raised me.  She would always show up when I was just getting very
sick</B>
<P><B>leaning over me and looking concerned.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I tend to "feel" rather than see.  I feel the emotions.  When I was
in my</B>
<P><B>teens my aunts elderly friend hadn't been seen for a day.  My mother
and</B>
<P><B>cousin when to check on her and found she had broken a hip.  The house
was</B>
<P><B>a 1700s origin and I was excited to be able to go in it.  I stepped
inside</B>
<P><B>that door and was met with a feeling of such pure unadultrated HATE
I</B>
<P><B>immediately became sick and had to leave.  My mother [who never did
believe</B>
<P><B>in this stuff] said maybe I was picking up on the woman's feelings.
 I told</B>
<P><B>her no "THAT HOUSE HATES".  It was hating something or someone so much
you</B>
<P><B>made yourself sick all over [wave after wave of nausa].  I never went
back in.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have had riders as I call them.  There is a mountain area near here
with</B>
<P><B>a dirt road over it.  I took it late one night as a shortcut.  That
way cut</B>
<P><B>off 30 miles. I realized there was something in the back seat.  It
was a</B>
<P><B>rotting corpse.  It stayed with me thru the whole valley from one
mountain</B>
<P><B>top to another [you have to cross 3 mountains on this road with very
narrow</B>
<P><B>valley's in a 10 mile stretch] and it suddenly was gone. He wanted
to scare</B>
<P><B>me and he was enjoying it.  A friend told me there had been a man who</B>
<P><B>missed one of the sharp curves and ran his buggy off the side.  They
had</B>
<P><B>found the horse and buggy but never found him.  He was the first but
not</B>
<P><B>the last.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I have also noticed in the fall while I was walking thru the Graveyard
the</B>
<P><B>sound of foot steps following me in the leaves. It is where most of
my</B>
<P><B>family is buried.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In boot camp when we were being punished we would be what is called
cycled.</B>
<P><B> It is exercises including running in place.  The housing is 3
stories</B>
<P><B>high.  We had the second floor.  I slept in a bottom bunk.  My bunkmate
and</B>
<P><B>I woke up one night to the sound of running feet and thumping.   I
said to</B>
<P><B>her what the $#$#^ is that and her reply was "They are cycling the
guys</B>
<P><B>upstairs they must have done something to piss of their Company
Commander"</B>
<P><B>I said at 1 AM?</B>
<P><B>We both rolled over and went back to sleep for this wasn't unusual.
 It</B>
<P><B>dawned on us the next morning there was NO company in the upstairs
unit.  I</B>
<P><B>hated patrol up there.  The shower curtians would sway for no reason
and</B>
<P><B>there was no air and I kept getting feelings of fear.  [not being
afraid</B>
<P><B>but of fear very similar to the hate feeling]</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>When I lived in Fla for a while one of my cats got out with her collar
on.</B>
<P><B>I heard her in the middle of the night and went out to look for her.
 I was</B>
<P><B>worried about her hanging herself with a nonexpandable collar.  Coming
down</B>
<P><B>the road toward me was a glowing greenish figure that took shape as
it got</B>
<P><B>closer.  It was half raw muscle and veins with exposed guts and eyeball
and</B>
<P><B>the other half was bones.  It was not a pretty sight to say the least.
 It</B>
<P><B>was also grinning.  I ran back into the house woke my boyfriend and
said</B>
<P><B>there is a ghost out there and described it.  He just said Oh that
is raw</B>
<P><B>head and bloody bones my grandfather use to use him to scare us to
be good.</B>
<P><B> Yeah we have all [members of his family] seen him.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The place where he lived was strange.  At a certian point the world
looked</B>
<P><B>flat.  If you stepped outside of that the perspective went back to
normal.</B>
<P><B>It was about the shape of a large house.  His home was a much smaller</B>
<P><B>modern one within the shape.  When I was inside it felt as if I was
being</B>
<P><B>watched from the windows.  I could not look out them.  The
overwhelming</B>
<P><B>feeling was if I did I would see something so horrible I wouldn't be
able</B>
<P><B>to stop screaming.  I found out later that there had been a much
larger</B>
<P><B>house there at the turn of the century which was rebuilt in the
1910's.</B>
<P><B>The first house was used to house the insane and had burned with the</B>
<P><B>inmates in it late one night in the 1880s or 90s.  The second house
had</B>
<P><B>burned in the 1970's for no reason they could ever determine.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Currently I live with the little black kitten.  [I have birds so it
must be</B>
<P><B>having a heyday]  You see it streaking around and it will come under
the</B>
<P><B>table as if to rub on your legs... </B>
<P>
<P><B>I have my buddy who is a sort of poltergeist.  My buddy spends his
time</B>
<P><B>finding things [course I think he does some loosing of them too].
 Suddenly</B>
<P><B>they appear.  The newest incident was the logging boots.  We were to
have a</B>
<P><B>snow storm last week.  I have been hunting my logging boots forever.
[with</B>
<P><B>our strange warm fall I didn't need them until now]  I went in and
they sat</B>
<P><B>in the bathroom one on either side of the commode [won't miss seeing
them</B>
<P><B>there will I?].  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I also have the one who lives upstairs.  This one resides in the back</B>
<P><B>attic.[even my landlord who doesn't believe in ghosts hates that attic]
 He</B>
<P><B>use to venture all over the top attic and downstairs at night.  He
was a</B>
<P><B>walker with heavy tread and noises.  However can I say we made a deal
He</B>
<P><B>has full rein of the back attic which is his primary spot.  I don't
go in</B>
<P><B>there and he don't come out here.  Seems to have worked.  He hasn't
been</B>
<P><B>downstairs in a long time.  After all even a ghost needs his space.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>It is strange for me to think that people have isolated incidents or
have</B>
<P><B>never had a ghost "experience".  I have been dealing with them since
I was</B>
<P><B>little.  My mother swore she never saw one because she didn't want
to see</B>
<P><B>one. She believed she blocked it.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Advice?  Go on the feeling.  Not your reaction but the feeling.  If
it is</B>
<P><B>bad or fearful then it is.   As to reactions... IF you were dead and
NO one</B>
<P><B>noticed you how would you feel???  And if someone could... HEY....
They</B>
<P><B>know I am here....  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I worked with the criminally insane as a prison guard.  Worry more
about</B>
<P><B>the live ones than the dead ones.  There are some very sick people
out</B>
<P><B>there.  </B>

<H3><B><A NAME=jar>Possessed Coin Jar </A></B>
</H3><P><B>By: hohrt@wans.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Ridiculous as that sounds, it summarizes what I think happened 3
weeks</B>
<P><B>ago yesterday.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The setting is where I am now (in front of computer desk, with file</B>
<P><B>cabinet to the right), going through this web site, about 1 am CST.
 I</B>
<P><B>started remembering an incident when I was very young (nothing</B>
<P><B>supernatural) when I felt this bear-shaped coin jar (on top of above</B>
<P><B>mentioned file cabinet) looking at me.  Just that, looking at me. 
It</B>
<P><B>was as real as any day time encounter with another human being.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Tense as I became, I waved at the jar (hoping 'it' was the person who</B>
<P><B>gave the jar to me, a sweet old lady Red Cross worker I knew in the</B>
<P><B>Army).  Going to bed became a high priority right then.  Next day
after</B>
<P><B>work, that jar went into the storage room, and three pennies went
over</B>
<P><B>the door to my apartment (a ritual read about here).</B>
<P>
<P><B>The pennies must have worked, not so much as to do with the jar (its</B>
<P><B>hidden, so who knows), as the movements in my peripheral vision I had</B>
<P><B>been plagued with had become centered in the direction of the door.</B>
<P><B>I.e., something had been locked out.</B>
<P>
<P><B>If I offended something benign, I am sorry.  However, I was
frightened.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=myth>Myth or Monster?</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By: JStew72@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am now 26 married with two children and very interested in all of
the</B>
<P><B>stories posted on this site.  I write because of an incident that has
left my</B>
<P><B>sister and my self pondering for years.  As young girls, we shared
an antique</B>
<P><B>bed that had about a foot of space under it.  One night with my cat
sleeping</B>
<P><B>on my head, I was awaken by the sound of an animals claws walking across
the</B>
<P><B>hardwood floor of our bedroom.  My cat, Chester had also heard it,
as he at</B>
<P><B>full alert, and stopped purring.  I wondered if the neighbors weener
dog had</B>
<P><B>gotten in somehow, because the clicking of claws was loud enough that
it had</B>
<P><B>to be the size of a small dog.  My face grew hot from blood rushing
through my</B>
<P><B>body, and I could hear my heart pounding.  I was too frightened to
 speak to</B>
<P><B>my sister, so I laid perfectly still untill Chester jumped off the
bed.  I</B>
<P><B>beleived him to be my protector, untill I heard him hightailing it
down the</B>
<P><B>hall.;-)  Suddenly my sister tells me to go turn on the light, as she
had</B>
<P><B>dropped her beloved stuffed animal.  Thinking she would've heard it,
and would</B>
<P><B>never send me into harms way, I hopped off the bed and walked over
to the</B>
<P><B>light switch.  As I rounded the bed, I saw two large red pointed eyes
staring</B>
<P><B>at me from under my dresser.  I flipped on the light, (and I still
don't know</B>
<P><B>why,) I got down on my hands and knees to look under my dresser.  I
had a full</B>
<P><B>view under the bed and dressers and open closet.......... Nothing.
 Boy, I was</B>
<P><B>sure relieved.  My sis said," o.k., turn off the light."  I did, and
low and</B>
<P><B>behold, there they were again under my bed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  YIKES!
 Still I</B>
<P><B>did not say a word to my sister, as acknowledging it would make it
real.  As I</B>
<P><B>lay there and tried to sleep, it began wandering and actually ran into
a</B>
<P><B>little book shelf my daddy had made.  Eventually I slept and told a
friend the</B>
<P><B>next day who laughed and said I was lying.  About 6 years later I brought
it</B>
<P><B>up to my sister who couldn't believe it. She had peered over the side
of the</B>
<P><B>bed to see what was wandering around and saw the exact same eyes staring
back</B>
<P><B>at her.  That's when she told me to turn on the light!!!!!!  My brother
and</B>
<P><B>brother in law said it was probably a huge rat, but central Washington
doesn't</B>
<P><B>have a real problem with dog sized rats.  Not the mention the eyes
were facing</B>
<P><B>forward, not on the sides, and they were pointed, not round.  I will
belive my</B>
<P><B>son if he is ever scared of the boogy man.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=haunted>Haunted House in Bangkok</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:  kristinnewell@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am in the entertainment business here in Thailand.  To begin with
</B>
<P><B>Thailand is a very spiritual place, there are very few skeptics here.</B>
<P><B>On with the story.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was invited to do a tv show that deals on the subjects of ghosts.
 </B>
<P><B>They were having a sort of real documentary piece about a very infamous
</B>
<P><B>haunted house in Bangkok.  The story of this house is that there was
</B>
<P><B>once this japanese maid that lived there who worked for this really
rich </B>
<P><B>thai guy who would constantly come home and rape this poor lady.  The
</B>
<P><B>maid had about all she could take and comitted suicide, hanging herself
</B>
<P><B>in her bedroom.  After that, her ghost would come back and literally
</B>
<P><B>just terrorize this man, and the man finally moved out. Everyone knew
</B>
<P><B>the story of this house, and the house was never to be sold again.
 The </B>
<P><B>house has been vacant for over 10 years now, it is a place where drug
</B>
<P><B>dealers go to sell drugs, but nobody dares to stay there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When they asked me to go to this house, of course I was petrified!
 But </B>
<P><B>I agreed to go because 2 of my friends were going to go in with me.
 We </B>
<P><B>had the whole camera crew and lots of bonfires set up in side the house
</B>
<P><B>so we could see, which made it a bit less frightening.  To make this
</B>
<P><B>long story short,  while we were filming nothing scary happened to
us, </B>
<P><B>except for some practical pranks the film crew played on us.  But just
</B>
<P><B>before the show was over, a friend of mine, who came to watch asked
me </B>
<P><B>for my car keys so we could get the hell outta there when it was done,
</B>
<P><B>so I agreed.  We were finally done!  Just then my friend came over
to me </B>
<P><B>and told me the doors locked by themselves, with the keys in the </B>
<P><B>ignition, and the engine already running.  I tried to think practically,
</B>
<P><B>it had to be a screwup with the alarm.  I told my friend he needed
to go </B>
<P><B>back to my house (about a 15 min. drive) and get my extra set of car
</B>
<P><B>keys, so he left.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was now pitch dark with only a couple of friends there and a couple
</B>
<P><B>of the cameramen waiting around.  All the sudden I hear this loud scream
</B>
<P><B>of woman from inside the house, I freaked!  I asked my friends if anyone
</B>
<P><B>heard it, the only guy that said he had heard it was my friend that
had </B>
<P><B>actually gone inside the house with me.  I tried to ignore it and not
</B>
<P><B>long after my friend arrived with the keys.  We all got into the car
and </B>
<P><B>tried to hurry ourselves out of there, then BOOM! My tire explodes,
</B>
<P><B>right in front of the damn house, I didn't care, I kept on driving
</B>
<P><B>until I found some street lights.  After that, there was no way I was
</B>
<P><B>going to sleep at home.  I ended up sleeping at my friend's house,
now I </B>
<P><B>have stayed at my friend's house a lot and I never knew he had any
dogs, </B>
<P><B>but that night they started going crazy!  We got so scared we didn't
</B>
<P><B>know what to do so we prayed, and I swear to God the dogs just stopped
</B>
<P><B>barking.  The scary thing is this ghost is infamous for following people
</B>
<P><B>home.  Ever since then I have learned that ghosts ARE real, no matter
</B>
<P><B>what science tries to prove, and people need to respect them. </B>

<H3><B><A NAME=my>My Levittown Haunting</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By: Morrisville@erols.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi.  I don't know if this is really the right place for me.  I feel
kind of</B>
<P><B>silly writing all of this down.  I don't even know who's going to see</B>
<P><B>this...  First off, my name is Joanna .  Feel free to call me Jo. 
I'm</B>
<P><B>21 and haven't lived with ghosts for a while.  For years now.  But
my</B>
<P><B>memories in that house are enough to keep me convinced for a
lifetime.</B>
<P><B>Nothing tragic happened there.  I was never hurt or attacked.  I
haven't</B>
<P><B>been traumatized for life.  But everything that happened there was
so...  It</B>
<P><B>was incredible for me.  I hope no one minds my coming here and sharing
my</B>
<P><B>stories.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My friend Russ told me that his psychic friend (not off the phone,
he</B>
<P><B>insists he really had one) told him I was something of a ghost beacon.
 That</B>
<P><B>they could see me easily and they were attracted to me.  That's why
there</B>
<P><B>were so many in the house.  I was sure of the woman, the man, and the
little</B>
<P><B>girl, although there may have been others.  I'll talk about each</B>
<P><B>individually.</B>
<P>
<P><B>There was a lady who hung out downstairs.  I hope this doesn't bore
anybody.</B>
<P><B>I picked her first because I decided to save the best for last.  Anyway,
we</B>
<P><B>all saw here.  Ever see somebody approaching from the corner of your
eye and</B>
<P><B>then no one shows up?  Well, this happened so many times.  But more
clearly</B>
<P><B>than that.  And everyone in my family saw her from the same exact
place.</B>
<P><B>Downstairs we had a backyard porch right behind the kitchen.  My
step-father</B>
<P><B>turned that porch into a family room, but never took the windows out
of the</B>
<P><B>kitchen.  It was an odd set-up, but it worked.  Well, occasionally
when I'd</B>
<P><B>be sitting on the couch I'd see my younger sister coming through the</B>
<P><B>kitchen.  To get back there you went through the kitchen, through the
dining</B>
<P><B>room, then back.  I'd often see her go into the dining room, but no
one</B>
<P><B>would come out.  Going in to look for her...  Of course she'd never
be</B>
<P><B>there.  But I wasn't the only one who saw her.  Once my step-father</B>
<P><B>approached me and my sister and asked who it was.  He had seen one
of us go</B>
<P><B>into the dining room clearly.  We laughed at him.  We knew who he had
seen.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now there's the man.  He's the only one who actually... touched stuff.
 Once</B>
<P><B>he flung the lid to my trinket box onto the floor.  It was a
malevolent</B>
<P><B>gesture.  Kind of, a "Hey, guess who's around!" type of thing.  He
did</B>
<P><B>things like that often.  Let us know he was there in friendly ways,
only he</B>
<P><B>ended up terrifying one of my friends so that he'd never come back
to my</B>
<P><B>house.  I lived every other weekend with my two step-sisters and</B>
<P><B>step-brother.  That just added to me and my sister and my brother.
 Six of</B>
<P><B>us total (not including the newest addition to our group who wasn't
around</B>
<P><B>or old enough for most of this stuff).  So of course there were tons
of</B>
<P><B>childish pranks and practical jokes.  One night my friend had to call
home.</B>
<P><B>I tossed him the cordless and he told me there was no dial tone.  I
checked</B>
<P><B>the other kitchen phone and he was right.  I ran upstairs to my phone
and</B>
<P><B>saw that someone had hit the speaker phone button.  I hit it again,
and when</B>
<P><B>the red light went out, I ran down and told him to make his call.
 Once</B>
<P><B>again, there was no dial tone.  I ran up again, annoyed this time.
 Once</B>
<P><B>again, the red button was on.  I ran back down told him to go ahead.
 He put</B>
<P><B>the phone up to his ear and just looked at me.  I yelled up the steps,
"Who</B>
<P><B>ever's doing that better knock it the hell out!"  That's when my
girlfriend</B>
<P><B>who had also been there said, "Jo, everyone's in the family room."
 We both</B>
<P><B>looked up the steps with a mixture of awe and fear.  We told Keith
we'd</B>
<P><B>watch the phone while he made his call.  We went up, hit the button
(of</B>
<P><B>course the red button was on again) and called down to Keith to make
his</B>
<P><B>call.  Wouldn't you know it worked this time.  But Keith ran out the
door</B>
<P><B>and said, "I'm sorry Jo, but I'm never coming over your house again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This fellow loved jokes.  Once when we came home from shopping at a
nearby</B>
<P><B>mall, I called dibs on the bathroom.  My brother was the only one out
of the</B>
<P><B>car first and he made a bee-line for the house.  I didn't see where
he had</B>
<P><B>gone, but when I pushed the door open to the hall-way the door shut
in my</B>
<P><B>face.  When I pushed on it again, my brother pushed back from the
other</B>
<P><B>side.  I started yelling at him and fighting with him to open the door
and</B>
<P><B>let me in.  I was struggling with him for about ten seconds (I was
really</B>
<P><B>surprised because he was usually a lot weaker then that) when I
finally</B>
<P><B>burst, "Chris, let me in now!"  All of a sudden I heard, "Jo..?"  Of
course</B>
<P><B>Chris (and I believe everyone else, too) was in the living room staring
at</B>
<P><B>me.  I looked to the door and gave it a gentle nudge.  It swung open
easily.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now for the one I actually without a doubt saw.  One night I was</B>
<P><B>baby-sitting my mother's best friend's daughter.  She was two or three
at</B>
<P><B>the time.  A small girl.  I woke up in the middle of the night to see
her</B>
<P><B>figure standing by my bureau (not a whole lot of light through the
window).</B>
<P><B>I sat up groggily and said, "Mandy, Honey, what are you doing out of
bed?"</B>
<P><B>She gasped and absolutely took off down the hall.  I never saw a kid
bolt</B>
<P><B>like that.  I heard her footsteps go back into her room, but I figured
I</B>
<P><B>better tuck her in.  When I got to her room, she was out like a light.
 And</B>
<P><B>this child wasn't pretending to be asleep.  And she certainly hadn't
just</B>
<P><B>sprint like a leopard, either.  That little girl didn't appear often.
 I</B>
<P><B>only saw her once.  But my Daddy told me that when my sister and I
were</B>
<P><B>little, he saw one of us walking around upstairs while we were supposed
to</B>
<P><B>be napping.  When he went up to put whoever it was back in bed, he
found us</B>
<P><B>both asleep.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That's pretty much it.  There was one incident that confuses me,
though.</B>
<P><B>One night when my cousin was sleeping over I felt her throw a pillow
at my</B>
<P><B>face.  I yelled at her and started feeling around for the pillow. 
Of course</B>
<P><B>there was none.  She told me she hadn't thrown anything.  It had felt
like a</B>
<P><B>pillow almost.  Or like a really strong puff of wind.  Just with more
mass</B>
<P><B>then air.  I don't even know if that was a malevolent gesture.  Just
an</B>
<P><B>isolated incident.  One that doesn't seem to fit with the others.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, that just about does it.  I hope I didn't put anyone to sleep.
 It</B>
<P><B>really was a pleasure getting all of this down, though.  If anyone
wants to</B>
<P><B>get back to me, please, I'm begging you to write me.  I'd love to give
what</B>
<P><B>I can.  This stuff didn't terrify me.  It scared me a bit at the time,
but</B>
<P><B>gave me a love for ghosts and an eagerness to find out more about them.
 So</B>
<P><B>if you want to hear anything more or talk to me about your
experiences,</B>
<P><B>please email Jo.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hope to hear from you!</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=dress>Burial Dress</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By: JSi9997271@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I must admit, I had never been much of one to believe in ghosts or</B>
<P><B>supernatural phenomena until I had a rather chilling conversation with
a</B>
<P><B>friend of mine's mother back in 1989.  She was a cherokee lady, and
one day at</B>
<P><B>my friends house she began to tell me that weird experiences had  followed
her</B>
<P><B>from place to place since childhood.  As we talked, she told me the
story of</B>
<P><B>her daughter.  Her daughter had been murdered in a park in Durham,
North</B>
<P><B>Carolina in 1985. It seems that the next night after the funeral, she
had a</B>
<P><B>very strange dream, or so she thought.  At about 3:00 a.m. , she heard
a knock</B>
<P><B>on the door.  She went to answer the door, and when she opened it ,
her</B>
<P><B>daughter was standing in the doorway wearing the dress she was buried
in.  Her</B>
<P><B>daughter said "mamma, i've come home, i'm home mamma".  She told me
that she</B>
<P><B>woke up immediately after this, but attributed it to the trauma of
having just</B>
<P><B>lost a child. The next morning, she was preparing breakfast for her
two sons,</B>
<P><B>who were only around 10 and 12 at the time.  They were playing in the
sisters</B>
<P><B>room, and one of them opened the closet. They came out terrified
yelling</B>
<P><B>"mamma, the dress is in the closet, the dress is in the closet."  Not
knowing</B>
<P><B>what they were talking about, she went with them into her sisters room.
 There</B>
<P><B>hanging in the closet was the dress that her daughter had been buried
in the</B>
<P><B>day before!  I thought this was all crazy, saying "yeah, right."  Then
she</B>
<P><B>proceded to show me a couple of pictures.  She had taken a picture
of her</B>
<P><B>daughter in the casket right before they had closed it .  (why do people
do</B>
<P><B>this?)  Anyway, she showed me where there was a little blood on the
collar</B>
<P><B>where the mortician had done a sloppy job (she had been badly beaten).
She</B>
<P><B>then showed me the dress that had been hanging in the closet, and it
had the</B>
<P><B>exact same blood marks on it as did the picture! I had unbelievable
chills run</B>
<P><B>down my spine. Even weirder when I went to pull out of their driveway
that</B>
<P><B>night, I looked in my rearview mirror, and he daughter was sitting
in my back</B>
<P><B>seat smiling at me. I turned around quickly, and she was gone.Nothing
in my</B>
<P><B>mirror either.  I almost did not believe this, but it's funny how it
takes</B>
<P><B>something like this to get someone to believe sometimes.  This was
my first,</B>
<P><B>but not my last ghostly experience.  It seems like this opened a door
for</B>
<P><B>weird stuff, but I will never forget that night.</B>

<H3><A NAME=between>Connection Between My Neighbors and Me</A>
</H3><P><B>By:  semery@contractconxxion.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello again, this is Sherry. Last night I wrote to you about an</B>
<P><B>experience in my California home...seeing my daughter in the window,</B>
<P><B>then discovering that she was at her friends house and not where I
had</B>
<P><B>seen her at all. When I first began my letter I had mentioned that
I</B>
<P><B>wanted to tell you about two experiences. Well, tonight I am writing
to</B>
<P><B>tell you about the second experience. For me it was the most
terrifying</B>
<P><B>experience in my life.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It happened this way...</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had just wakened from my sleep, it was about 7:00 AM. The state I
was</B>
<P><B>in was some where between being awake and asleep when all of a sudden
I</B>
<P><B>began to experience a terrible sensation all over my body. It felt
as if</B>
<P><B>my body was inside a compression chamber. At first I felt hands
touching</B>
<P><B>me, then I felt a body covering my body. It all happened in a very</B>
<P><B>intimate way. Once I felt the presence of this thing pressing against
by</B>
<P><B>entire body, I mean, It was like I was in a vice grip from head to
toe.</B>
<P><B>I began to experience a tremendous amount of fear, yet mentally</B>
<P><B>questioning what was happening at the same time. Then the pressure
began</B>
<P><B>to increase, it became stronger and stronger, to the point where my
fear</B>
<P><B>began to turn into terror.  It became so intense and  horrifying. My</B>
<P><B>body was being squeezed to the point beyond pain. I sensed the most</B>
<P><B>heightened sense of evil, it was beyond anything that I could
possibly</B>
<P><B>imagine. I felt it crushing my life away. If it didn't stop, I knew
I</B>
<P><B>was going to die.  I was in such a state of terror that even when I</B>
<P><B>tried to scream I could not. Finally, upon my realization that my
only</B>
<P><B>tool was my mind and heart I began praying to God, saying his name
over</B>
<P><B>and over, begging for his protection. It was only after this that I
felt</B>
<P><B>it's grip on me slowly began to break and release. Finally, it seemed</B>
<P><B>like it was gone. It actually was gone. But the effects of what it
had</B>
<P><B>done to me kept me completely horrified. When the whole experience
was</B>
<P><B>over I couldn't tell if it was really real or just a very bad
nightmare.</B>
<P>
<P><B>what was really strange was that this was the second time that I had</B>
<P><B>experience this. The first time it happened it was very mild or
subtle</B>
<P><B>and not threatening at all, just strange. It was the latter that was</B>
<P><B>terrifying. That same morning I called a friend of my who had always</B>
<P><B>been physic. I explained to her what had happened and asked her if
it</B>
<P><B>were a dream or real. After some consideration she said that she
thought</B>
<P><B>that it was a dream, however, for a long time she has sensed
something</B>
<P><B>very evil in the back part of my house, where my bedroom was.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Even though I didn't experience that again, for many nights after the</B>
<P><B>experience I slept with all my lights on and cried myself to sleep.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A couple of years earlier while I was out of the State and living
with</B>
<P><B>my husband where his job was (in Florida), my oldest daughter was
living</B>
<P><B>in the house by herself. So I had decided to call her and ask her if</B>
<P><B>anything strange had ever happened to her while living in the house.
She</B>
<P><B>told me that there were several occasions when she heard things and
a</B>
<P><B>few times she actually saw some very strange things.  Many of the
noises</B>
<P><B>we sounds of doors opening and closing, the TV coming on by itself
and</B>
<P><B>then shutting off. Then she said that the house became so cold</B>
<P><B>everywhere that she felt forced back into my bedroom, she said it was</B>
<P><B>the only place she could get warm. So she began to sleep there. Then
one</B>
<P><B>night she said she was awakened by something and when she opened her</B>
<P><B>eyes she saw a line of people who looked Amish walking down the hall</B>
<P><B>toward her, they continued walking right into the bedroom and right</B>
<P><B>through the walls leading outside. She said she was horrified by what</B>
<P><B>she saw and as a result she moved a bed out into the living room and</B>
<P><B>continued to sleep in there from then on.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After I spoke to her about all of what had seen and my own experiences
I</B>
<P><B>remembered that my next door neighbors had mentioned years earlier,
when</B>
<P><B>we had bought the house that they had a ghost. At the time I laughed
and</B>
<P><B>shrugged my shoulders, but now I decided that I would go talk to them</B>
<P><B>about all of this. But first, before telling them anything I began</B>
<P><B>asking them a lot of questions, trying to assertion any correlation.</B>
<P><B>They had lots of stories to tell me and they did. They had been
living</B>
<P><B>in their house for about 30 years or so. I didn't see any connection</B>
<P><B>until after they were done telling me their experiences, I began
telling</B>
<P><B>them about my daughter's and then mine. Their were two instances
where</B>
<P><B>our stories connected. The first one was when they had their daughter</B>
<P><B>home one night and had some girlfriends at their house for the
evening.</B>
<P><B>To make a long story short. They had seen a forth girl sitting on the</B>
<P><B>floor with the other girls talking and laughing. when they left the
room</B>
<P><B>and then returned just a few minutes later, the girl was gone. When
they</B>
<P><B>asked about her whereabouts everyone one said there's no one else
here.</B>
<P><B>You must be seeing things. There was another time when they saw the
same</B>
<P><B>girl walking into a bedroom of the house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The connection? you may wonder is this: After my first experience of</B>
<P><B>seeing whom I thought was my daughter in the window late at night
(the</B>
<P><B>experience I sent you last night) was where I started to make a</B>
<P><B>connection. You see later after that experience, I began to analyze
the</B>
<P><B>whole "ghost theory" and after much thought I realized that whom I
saw</B>
<P><B>in the window may very well have been the image of my sister who died
at</B>
<P><B>age 14, she was almost 15 when she had died from a terrible freak
horse</B>
<P><B>accident. My youngest daughter Sara resembles my sister very much.
Once</B>
<P><B>my neighbor Al told me about seeing this young girl those two times
in</B>
<P><B>his house I asked him to describe what she looked like to me. The
more</B>
<P><B>he described her the more she sounded like my sister. Finally I went</B>
<P><B>home and got an old photograph of my sister and took it over to Al.
I</B>
<P><B>showed the photo to him and asked him did the girl resemble her. He</B>
<P><B>looked at it for a good long minute and said, yes.  What is so
strange</B>
<P><B>is that when Al and his wife Wilma saw this girl years before, It was</B>
<P><B>many years prior to my buying the house next to them. Although it was</B>
<P><B>after my sister's death. As things turned out Al and Wilma have
become</B>
<P><B>my closest and dearest friends. If fate were something that is real
I</B>
<P><B>would say that it was just that that brought us together.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The other connection was when I was sitting in Al and Wilma's living</B>
<P><B>room with them talking one night. I began to tell them about my</B>
<P><B>horrifying experience of the hands and body, then the pressure to
near</B>
<P><B>death. Once I had finished telling them about what had happened Al</B>
<P><B>looked at Wilma and then at his arm, then he looked at me and said
look</B>
<P><B>at my arm. I looked at his arm and the hairs were standing straight
up.</B>
<P><B>He then told me that there had been several occasions when he had</B>
<P><B>experienced almost exactly the same thing. The only difference was
that</B>
<P><B>his experience wasn't as intense--to the point of near death as mine.</B>
<P><B>Then Wilma told me about waking up several times because she felt
hands</B>
<P><B>on her. She would ask Al to stop touching her, thinking that it was
he.</B>
<P><B>But it wasn't. She described the hands lightly caressing her back and</B>
<P><B>shoulders in a very motherly way. Strange.</B>
<P>
<P><B>There have been many experiences in both houses by both Al and Wilma
and</B>
<P><B>their girls, and also by my daughter Jessica and myself. Like I</B>
<P><B>mentioned last night, the only thing that has ever seemed to make a</B>
<P><B>difference was when my husband is home, in the house. Everything is</B>
<P><B>quiet then.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am very curious as to what other's thoughts might be about these</B>
<P><B>events. I Especially would like to hear from people who have some
kind</B>
<P><B>of knowledge of the paranormal.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Thank you for listening.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=old>Ghost Encounter in an Old Hospital</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By: BigSouza@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>             It is now Decemeber 3rd, 1998, and I am writing about
this</B>
<P><B>encounter now at the suggestion of a friend who I told it to the
previous</B>
<P><B>evening. Although this was a very strange and frieghtening experience,
I am</B>
<P><B>not sure of the exact day and date on which it happened, except that
it was in</B>
<P><B>September of 1995. I have not spoke of this to anyone since it happened
other</B>
<P><B>than my friend and I must admit I feel a little bit uncomfortable
writing</B>
<P><B>about it, but maybe it will help me deal with this experience better,
as I</B>
<P><B>still think about it on a day to day basis. I was a security officer
at an old</B>
<P><B>hospital in Massachusettes, which was purchased by the state and had
several</B>
<P><B>abandoned floors and wings. The hospital contained a detox unit, a
court</B>
<P><B>ordered program for people convicted of drunken driving offenses, and
of all</B>
<P><B>things to go along with these programs, a unit for people suffering
from</B>
<P><B>respiritory difficulties. We were required to do patrols throughout
all area's</B>
<P><B>of the hospital, interior and exterior, and even check the floors and
wings</B>
<P><B>that had not been in service for years. I had been working in the hospital
for</B>
<P><B>about four months at the time on the overnight shift, and although
I was</B>
<P><B>slightly weary of checking these vacant floors, which were in semi-darkness
at</B>
<P><B>the time, tried to put any "Fears" I may have had out of my head. There
were</B>
<P><B>two of us on during the midnight shift, and I think it was either at
two or</B>
<P><B>three in the morning it was my turn to do the rounds. I started the
way I</B>
<P><B>usually did, working from the sixth floor down. I finally began to
check the</B>
<P><B>second floor, which at one time was a wing to treat terminally ill
patients, I</B>
<P><B>knew thats what it was for at one time but never really thought anything
of</B>
<P><B>it. I checked the floor from one end to the other , checking all the
rooms and</B>
<P><B>the old office behind the nurses station, and all was clear. As i
started</B>
<P><B>making my way back towards the elevator to go to the first floor, I
heard the</B>
<P><B>sound of voices. I could not make out whether it was two or three,
but they</B>
<P><B>were without a doubt there coming from not to far down the hall that
I had</B>
<P><B>just checked. The first thing that came to my mind was that these were
detox</B>
<P><B>clients that had gotten off thier unit, past the detox staff and made
thier</B>
<P><B>way down to the second floor, and were fooling around, possibly hiding
in the</B>
<P><B>closets of one of the rooms I had just checked. I listened very intently
to be</B>
<P><B>sure of myself, and could clearly hear the voices. The strange thing
was that</B>
<P><B>they sounded like they were just voices, which could be heard very
clearly,</B>
<P><B>but there were no words, just voices. I called out down the hall for
who ever</B>
<P><B>it was to step out of the room into the hallway. I got no response
to this</B>
<P><B>request. I called out again. Still no response, but the voices were
still</B>
<P><B>there. I used my radio to contact my partner and alert her that I had
a</B>
<P><B>trespass situation on the second floor as this is what I thought I
was dealing</B>
<P><B>with and needed her assistance. The response I got back over the radio
came</B>
<P><B>back broken up and nearly in-audible. To me personally that was no
surprise as</B>
<P><B>that was a typical occurance with our communications system, but I
was sure I</B>
<P><B>had gotten a response out of her as I thought I heard her voice through
all</B>
<P><B>the crackling and interference. I began to make my way down the hall,
thinking</B>
<P><B>without a doubt in my mind I was dealing with detox clients. I called
out</B>
<P><B>again for whoever it was to step out into the hallway. That's when
I noticed</B>
<P><B>the temperature suddenly drop in the hallway that was warm just a few
seconds</B>
<P><B>ago, due to the fact that it was a warm September night. And although
in the</B>
<P><B>back of my mind I knew it was there, it finally hit me that a crackling
sound</B>
<P><B>was coming over my radio even though I had not hit the button to transmit.
I</B>
<P><B>tried once again to contact my partner over the radio, knowing full
well that</B>
<P><B>if she heard me the first time she would have been here by now, but
the</B>
<P><B>crackling and interference continued to come over the radio whether
I hit the</B>
<P><B>button to transmit or not. At that point I could feel something was
just not</B>
<P><B>right, but I tried to tell myself that this was just a couple of people
who</B>
<P><B>had wandered onto the hospitals old out of service unit. I noticed
at this</B>
<P><B>time that the voices had gotten louder and the hallway had gotten colder,
and</B>
<P><B>all I could think about was getting off the floor to the elevator or
the</B>
<P><B>stairway. The stairway was closer to me so I turned and began searching
for my</B>
<P><B>keys to unlock the door. The voices were louder now and more presistant,
and I</B>
<P><B>could clearly hear footsteps along with them, not coming from one direction
of</B>
<P><B>the hallway, but all directions. The voices started coming from all
directions</B>
<P><B>as well, and that's when I fell to the floor, which was ice cold, just
as cold</B>
<P><B>as putting you're hand on a steel fence outside during the dead of
winter, I</B>
<P><B>wanted to push myself away from the floor as soon as I touched it but
I did'nt</B>
<P><B>have the energy to do so. All I could hear was voices, but I still
could not</B>
<P><B>make out what was being said, and the footsteps were growing louder.
I was on</B>
<P><B>my hands and knees, looking at the floor, I struggled to hold my head
up, just</B>
<P><B>so I could find the door leading to the stairs, but what instead caught
my</B>
<P><B>attention was what looked like several people walking around me. I
could'nt</B>
<P><B>make out what they looked like or if they were male or female, as they
had no</B>
<P><B>faces and no type of clothing could be seen. They simply looked like
wrinkles</B>
<P><B>and blurs in the air with a human shape walking all around me through
the</B>
<P><B>dimly lit hallway. It was then that one of these "shapes" walked towards
me as</B>
<P><B>I was still on my hands and knees, and then walked right "through"
me. At that</B>
<P><B>point I had severe difficulty breathing, and seemed to lose more control
of</B>
<P><B>myself physically that</B>
<P><B> I already had. I struggled painfully to get air into my lungs and
then force</B>
<P><B>it out. After repeating this process several times, I noticed a funny
taste in</B>
<P><B>my mouth, and then noticed several small puddles of blood on the floor,
which</B>
<P><B>I was exhaling with the air. It was then that I panicked and then
forced</B>
<P><B>myself to then stairwell door with every ounce of strength that I had,
which</B>
<P><B>was not much, and when I almost had myself standing, fell to the floor
again.</B>
<P><B>I was really begining to lose control of myself at this point, due
to the fact</B>
<P><B>that I was very scared, and, I don't know if people always feel this
way in</B>
<P><B>ghost encounters, but thought I was going to die. I was still having</B>
<P><B>difficulty breathing, and still had blood coming up from my throat.
I was also</B>
<P><B>shaking uncontrolably, and was struggling to regain control of myself,as
the</B>
<P><B>hallway was still very active with voices, footsteps, and blurry images
which</B>
<P><B>continued to wander up and down the unit. I tried once again for the
keys and</B>
<P><B>practically crawled to the stairwell door. My hand touched the doorknob,
which</B>
<P><B>even though I was very cold already, was absoloutley freezing and
almost</B>
<P><B>stingingly painful to the touch. I grabbed for the key, the whole
time</B>
<P><B>thinking that it was so cold that the lock may be frozen. I managed
to control</B>
<P><B>my shaking just long enough to get the key into the lock and turn it.
I fell</B>
<P><B>through the door and out of the unit out into the stairwell, crawling
from the</B>
<P><B>hallway to the stairs. The door finally closed once I got my legs out
of the</B>
<P><B>way, and the warm air in the dimly lit stairwell hit me almost
immediately,</B>
<P><B>and I could feel some of the energy coming back. If this phenomenon
was still</B>
<P><B>going on behind the door I had just exited, I did'nt care one bit,
I wanted to</B>
<P><B>get as far away from it as I could. I grabbed the railing for support
and</B>
<P><B>walked myself, still quite shaken, down the stairs to the first floor,
and</B>
<P><B>into a bathroom. I was breathing easier now, but was coughing heavily,
I made</B>
<P><B>my way to a toilet, which I coughed up several clots of blood up into,
and</B>
<P><B>when I was done checked myself out in a mirror. My eyes were glassy
and</B>
<P><B>bloodshot, my skin was very pale, and for a guy freezing his rear off
a few</B>
<P><B>minutes ago, sweating like a pig. I splashed some cold water on my
face,</B>
<P><B>toweled off and tried to compose myself the best I could, and then
made my way</B>
<P><B>back to the security office, where my partner immediately noticed that
I</B>
<P><B>was'nt back in the same condition that I left in earlier. She questioned
me on</B>
<P><B>why I took so long on my patrol, at which point I realized she did
not get my</B>
<P><B>transmission over the radio earlier, and when I asked her about it,
stated</B>
<P><B>that she had her radio with her the whole time, and not once did che
receive a</B>
<P><B>transmission from me. I used the excuse of illness for the reason why
the</B>
<P><B>patrol took as long as it did, and further stated that I thought I
should go</B>
<P><B>home. A replacement was called in for me and I left immediatley upon
his</B>
<P><B>arrival. I arrived home and sat in the living room trying to make sense
of</B>
<P><B>what happened, but I could'nt. I never spoke a word of this to my fiance,
my</B>
<P><B>co-workers on that job, or the one I have now, or any of my friends
until last</B>
<P><B>night. I still don't fully understand what happened that morning. Although
I</B>
<P><B>was apparently hurt physically, I don't think it was done intentionally
by</B>
<P><B>whatever it was, I had been on that floor several times before and
never</B>
<P><B>encountered anything at all like what I came face to face with then,
or</B>
<P><B>anywhere else throughout the hospital for that matter. I think I may
have just</B>
<P><B>been up there at the wrong time or my presence there set something
off.</B>
<P><B>There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about what happened.
I never</B>
<P><B>spoke about it because, like alot of other people who have been in
this</B>
<P><B>situation feel I'm sure, I thought nobody would believe me or they
would think</B>
<P><B>I'm crazy. I was very scared at the time, but looking back on it now,
it was a</B>
<P><B>freightening, but interesting experience, and I actually hope to have
another</B>
<P><B>encounter without the same side effects. Thank you for giving me the</B>
<P><B>opportunity to write about this experience, and thank you for
listening.</B>

<P><B>dear sir I am writing in regards to a haunting by a ghost and a cat
in our old home.we were not forced out by the ghost.but rather,haunted by
sightings nightly and noise.not just slight noise but books and papers crashing
to and around the house.this only happened once or twice.but the sightings
were nightly to the point of waking me and my family by staring at us. We
built our home and this is when the problem started. It never attempted to
hurt any of us but made it's presence well known to anyone that spent more
than one night. I told my wife of this ghost for several months. But she
thought that I was perhaps having a little to much to drink. Until one night
this ghost made itself known to her by waking her up in the middle of the
night. She awoke me with a elbow in the ribs. I looked and said to her I
told you about him. Loud voices didn't bother it at all, but when I turned
on the lamp it disappeared from sight. We often seen and heard the ghost.
This wasn't the worst of the problem. I then started having dreams about
things happening. At first I thought nothing of it but after having a dream
three times one week, I then  told my wife about the dream. I dreamed that
a vacant double wide home next door would burn down. Needless to say 45 days
later it burnt down. One week later I dreamt that our neighbor house next
door several hundred yards away burnt down. 29 days after my dream it also
burnt down.i then had another dream about another house burning down and
28 days there about it  burnt down. By this time my wife was getting nervous,
and I dont mind saying I myself was also getting very nervous. Soon after
that we were forced to move because of the lack of work. I later was told
that this property was an old indian battle ground. Since we have moved this
problem has ceased. I don't mind saying I am glad. Thanks for your time.

</H3><P><B>By:  parulis@gibralter.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi, I am sorry I do not have a story to tell you ,but I do want to
say</B>
<P><B>that</B> <B>I read the story Camp Zama. I thought it was really neat
because I just</B>
<P><B>moved from Japan 7 months ago.I went to Zama American High School.
I was</B>
<P><B>in</B> <B>the JROTC program,and we went on a tour around the base.
They told us</B>
<P><B>how</B> <B>the road leading to Zama was one of the first paved roads,
because Zama</B>
<P><B>was</B> <B>a Japanese military base for WW2. I was shown the area where
the</B>
<P><B>suicides</B> <B>took place and there is now a man-made pond and park
where the stables</B>
<P><B>burned down. There is also a statue for the men who died and the
horses</B>
<P><B>with a small description of what happened. I also had many friends
that</B>
<P><B>lived on Sagami-hara, who told me of the many times they heard moving</B>
<P><B>around in their houses and would wake up to find things missing. Also</B>
<P><B>there</B> <B>were the times when my friends would be out walking around
late at night</B>
<P><B>returning from the park there. They always saw beams of light moving
in</B>
<P><B>between the houses like someone was trying to find something. Another</B>
<P><B>story</B> <B>was that the park was haunted, and if you went there late
at night you</B>
<P><B>could hear the moaning of the dead who wanted their place of death
back,</B>
<P><B>and some say they were even chased out of the park by apparitions</B>
<P><B>carrying</B> <B>flashlights. I can not tell you if these stories are
true, but I have</B>
<P><B>every</B> <B>reason not to doubt them, along with the first author
of Camp Zama. I</B>
<P><B>wanted to write and say that it is a small world, and how neat it was</B>
<P><B>that</B> <B>someone else knew of the sightings and stories of Camp
Zama.												</B>

<P>
<P><B>I have been reading your stories and have two to share. They are not
as</B>
<P><B>exciting as some of the ones I have read but would like to know if
anyone else</B>
<P><B>has had similar experiences. </B>
<P><B>When my husband and I were first married we lived in a small mobile
home on a</B>
<P><B>small tidal creek in Beaufort, South Carolina. It only had 2 bedrooms
and a</B>
<P><B>very small kitchen that was located in the very front with the sink
facing 2</B>
<P><B>windows. This meant that when you were washing dishes that your back
would be</B>
<P><B>facing the the rest of the mobile home. Whenever I was in the house
alone or</B>
<P><B>my husband was sleeping and I was doing the dishes I would feel like
someone</B>
<P><B>was walking up behind me and I would have to turn around. No one was
ever</B>
<P><B>there but the feeling always remained. It got so bad that I started
doing the</B>
<P><B>dishes turned sideways or only when someone else was there with me.
I first</B>
<P><B>thought that I was just being paranoid until things started turning
up</B>
<P><B>missing. We would put groceries in the cabinet and then go to get them
and</B>
<P><B>they would be gone. My husband thought that someone was coming into
the house</B>
<P><B>and taking them but we could never figure out how they got in and why
they</B>
<P><B>would take the items that were missing. I always knew what was missing
because</B>
<P><B>we lived on a very tight budget and bought groceries with each meal
planned.</B>
<P><B>Also, we would go to bed and wake up with all the cabinet doors in
the kitchen</B>
<P><B>open. Never any of the cabinets in any other part of the house just
the ones</B>
<P><B>in the kitchen. My husband lived in this mobile home before we got
married and</B>
<P><B>he told me that before I moved in there was a door between the livingroom
and</B>
<P><B>the hallway that connected the 2 bedrooms and the bathroom. Because
he was</B>
<P><B>single he often slept in the livingroom in front of the T.V.. He said
that he</B>
<P><B>finally took the door off the hinges and put it outside because
everynight</B>
<P><B>when he shut the door he would walk up to find it wide open. Everyone
we told</B>
<P><B>this story to told us it was just pressure changes in the house or
that we</B>
<P><B>were imagining things but when we moved we never had these kind of
experiences</B>
<P><B>in our new home. I still feel like there was something there but I
never</B>
<P><B>really knew what.</B>
<P><B>My second experience happened after we moved to another town in South
Carolina</B>
<P><B>called Walterboro. My husband was working out of town and my sister,
2 of her</B>
<P><B>friends and I decided to go Charleston to have dinner and catch a movie
and</B>
<P><B>just waste some time. On the way back to Walterboro my sister told
me of an old</B>
<P><B>haunted church called Pon Pon that we would pass by on the way home.
Pon Pon</B>
<P><B>is the ruines of a church that was burnt down several times before
it was</B>
<P><B>finally decided not to rebuild. All that is left standing is 4 brick
walls</B>
<P><B>with large holes where the stained glass windows would have been. The
story</B>
<P><B>around this area is that sometimes there will be lights in the windows
that no</B>
<P><B>one can explain. We all agreed that it would be fun to stop and check
it out.</B>
<P><B>We all thought it was a great joke. When we got there it was pitch
black and</B>
<P><B>we used the headlights from the car to see. When we got out of the
car and</B>
<P><B>walked towards the church I felt a deep feeling of cold and the hairs
on the</B>
<P><B>back of my neck stood up. The closer to the church I got the worse
the feeling</B>
<P><B>was until I couldn't go any further. I have never felt a feeling like
that</B>
<P><B>before, not even in the mobile home where we lived before. Although
I had felt</B>
<P><B>something in our mobile home it was never like this. The only way I
can</B>
<P><B>explain it is just a feeling of WRONGNESS. No one else felt it but
I wanted to</B>
<P><B>leave right then and made everyone get in the car. I never saw the
lights that</B>
<P><B>everyone said would appear but what I felt convinced me that I would
never go</B>
<P><B>back. From then on whenever anyone says something about Pon Pon I always
tell</B>
<P><B>them that I will NEVER go back. People always tell me that I just
scared</B>
<P><B>myself but I KNOW that I felt something and I didn't like it. Since
then I</B>
<P><B>have wondered if other people have had similar experieces. I know I'm
not</B>
<P><B>crazy and I didn't scare myself. Something was there and whatever it
was</B>
<P><B>wasn't nice. I later found out that people say that Pon Pon is used
for Black</B>
<P><B>Mass and have wondered if this had anything to do with what I felt.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=strange>A Strange House</A></B>
</H3><P><B> By: lhauselt@softcom.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>            I was born and raised in the California gold country. 
The</B>
<P><B>house I lived in from the time I was three to 14 years old</B>
<P><B>was DEFINITELY strange.  It was located just outside of town off of
 the</B>
<P><B>main highway at the edge of a wooded area.</B>
<P><B>It wasn't that old at the time, maybe 20 to 30 years old.  I didn't
know</B>
<P><B>the history of it, other than we were renting it from</B>
<P><B>a college history professor and his wife, who seemed a little odd to
me</B>
<P><B>at the time.</B>
<P>
<P><B>            I started sensing that the place was kind of strange when
I</B>
<P><B>was in grade school.  At night I often felt like something</B>
<P><B>else was in the house that you couldn't see, and I was scared a lot.
 I</B>
<P><B>heard lots of noises - the normal ones like settling</B>
<P><B>and wood rats that had gotten inside our walls, but there were other</B>
<P><B>things that could not be explained.</B>
<P>
<P><B>            In the summertime I would hear human footsteps outside
my</B>
<P><B>window.  This would start at around 2:00 a.m., and it</B>
<P><B>was usually around August that I heard them.  This happened for
several</B>
<P><B>years that I can remember.  I was never brave</B>
<P><B>enough to look and see what was making the sounds.  I knew there was
no</B>
<P><B>reason for anyone to pace around there night</B>
<P><B>after night at that time (or any other time for that matter).   I'd
go</B>
<P><B>to my mother's room and beg her to let me sleep in her bed</B>
<P><B>and she'd reluctantly let me sleep there.  I felt better not being</B>
<P><B>alone.</B>
<P>
<P><B>            One night, during another part of the year, I got up to
go</B>
<P><B>to the bathroom.  I stepped into the small hall in the center</B>
<P><B>of the house and looked into the living room.  There was a row of</B>
<P><B>windows along the front wall in there, and the drapes were</B>
<P><B>usually kept open.  I saw the siluoette of a man's head moving down
and</B>
<P><B>up in front of one of the windows.  There was no</B>
<P><B>sound.  I shot into my bed and pulled the covers over my head, my
heart</B>
<P><B>pounding.  There was absoutely no reason for that</B>
<P><B>guy (whoever or whatever he was) to be there!</B>
<P>
<P><B>            On another occasion, I awoke to find myself on the other</B>
<P><B>side of my double bed.  I felt the presence of another body</B>
<P><B>on my side but I thought it was my mother, so I didn't think any more</B>
<P><B>about it and went back to sleep.  She had fought with</B>
<P><B>my dad earlier in the evening, and I told her she could sleep in my
room</B>
<P><B>if she wanted to.  The next morning she was not in</B>
<P><B>my bed when I awoke, so I asked her about it.  She said she did not
come</B>
<P><B>into my room that night - she slept in her own bed</B>
<P><B>as my dad left and went to the place he was staying in Stockton (he
was</B>
<P><B>doing some work for my grandfather just outside of</B>
<P><B>that city).  Who was in my bed that night?  I have no siblings, and
no</B>
<P><B>one else was there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>            Just below the window closest to my bed there was a robin</B>
<P><B>and her babies in a nest she built in the bushes that grew</B>
<P><B>there.  I liked to watch them, and thought it was really neat that
they</B>
<P><B>were there.  This was in the late spring-early summer,</B>
<P><B>so I kept that window open a lot, even at night (no
air-conditioning).</B>
<P><B>This window was about eight feet up from the ground</B>
<P><B>and the nest was about 18 inches below the window.  The window was</B>
<P><B>double-hung and had a screen that hung from two</B>
<P><B>hinges at the top and was latched shut.  I woke up one morning to
find</B>
<P><B>the screen opened, hanging from one hinge and the</B>
<P><B>lower left corner was caught in the bushes and opened about a foot</B>
<P><B>wide!  There was no sign of the robin family or any part</B>
<P><B>of their nest.  I was horrified.  We had two cats and I thought maybe</B>
<P><B>one of them had done it.  If they had, they would have</B>
<P><B>fallen out the window, given the distance between the window and the</B>
<P><B>nest.  They were both in the house, and had not gotten</B>
<P><B>out.  When I closed and relatched the screen, I checked to see if a
cat</B>
<P><B>could have unlatched the latch.  It hooked in pretty</B>
<P><B>tightly - a cat could not unlatch it.  I checked all around outside,
and</B>
<P><B>there was absolutely no sign of the nest, or that the birds</B>
<P><B>had ever been there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>            One night my mother had some people over to visit.  When
we</B>
<P><B>walked the last guests out to their car at about 1:00</B>
<P><B>in the morning, we heard a sound coming from another part of the</B>
<P><B>property.  We went to investigate, and found one of the</B>
<P><B>faucets turned on full blast!  (There were several faucets located
on</B>
<P><B>the property).  My mom questioned everyone who was</B>
<P><B>at the house that night and nobody turned on that faucet.</B>
<P>
<P><B>            On yet another night, I woke up and looked out the
window.</B>
<P><B>An orange-gold ball came down from the sky(?) and</B>
<P><B>made a weird bouncing motion through the air.  It went behind some
trees</B>
<P><B>and made a flash.  I looked at my clock and it</B>
<P><B>was about 3:15 a.m.  That could have been ball lightning, but I'd
never</B>
<P><B>seen anything like it before or since then.</B>
<P>
<P><B>            Years later, I discussed that house with my mom.  She</B>
<P><B>admitted to feeling uneasy living there and had also seen the</B>
<P><B>siluoetted man in the living room.  We both heard many of the same</B>
<P><B>sounds and thought there was something strange about</B>
<P><B>the place.  The house has since been sold twice, and as far as I know</B>
<P><B>the current residents have been there for quite a while.</B>
<P><B>I now live in a city about an hour and a half's drive away, and the
last</B>
<P><B>time I was up in that area visiting was in Jan. 1996.</B>
<P><B>That house had been repainted and the kitchen enlarged (from what I</B>
<P><B>could see from the road).  I do have to wonder if</B>
<P><B>the current residents ever experienced anything unusual.</B>
<P>
<P><B>            Well, that's my story.  Thanks for reading.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=phenom>Strange Phenomenon</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:ctessier@francomedia.qc.ca</B>
<P>
<P><B>My name is Laura.  I`m submitting you a true story of a strange</B>
<P><B>occurence that I hope you won`t consider as "pass&eacute;"  since it
happened</B>
<P><B>to my mother a very long time ago and would be now difficult to</B>
<P><B>investigate.   Here it goes:</B>
<P>
<P><B>The following is an actual event which happened to my mother along
with</B>
<P><B>two relatives back in the late 1940`s when she was 13 or 14 years
old.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My mother, a city child, used to spend her summers at her aunt
Patsy's</B>
<P><B>farm situated in Albany (now known as Carignan) Quebec, Canada.  
Back</B>
<P><B>then in the area lived several Polish and Ukrainian farmers.  One
calm</B>
<P><B>sunny afternoon in 1948 or 1949, my mother, her mother (my
grandmother)</B>
<P><B>and her aunt Anastasia (my great aunt and half-sister of my
grandmother</B>
<P><B>and aunt Patsy) &endash; all three (except great-aunt Patsy) went to
visit a</B>
<P><B>neighbour at his house.  He was a very old man &endash; a Ukrainian
immigrant</B>
<P><B>in his 90's &endash; whose wife (also over 90) had died just a few
months</B>
<P><B>earlier.  My mother had met the woman while she was alive a few times</B>
<P><B>before and had found her to be a very nice old lady.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The visit that afternoon went along well.  My mother recalls that the</B>
<P><B>elderly neighbour had mentioned to them during their conversation
that</B>
<P><B>he felt lonely not having his wife anymore.   When it was time to
leave,</B>
<P><B>it was still a calm sunny afternoon outside.  The old man said to
them</B>
<P><B>in Ukrainian  "Oh please wait before you go, I would like to give you</B>
<P><B>some extra potatoes from my garden as I have too many for myself`".
 So</B>
<P><B>they agreed, and off the neighbour went outside to his garden in the</B>
<P><B>back of his house, leaving all three standing in the kitchen.  
During</B>
<P><B>the wait, my grandmother and great-aunt Anastasia began talking
between</B>
<P><B>themselves.   My mother remembers that my great-aunt Anastasia had
made</B>
<P><B>a foolish remark about the dead lady, joking that since the woman was</B>
<P><B>now dead, her husband could no longer make love to her anymore.  
Then</B>
<P><B>immediately after &endash; it couldn't have been more than a minute
 - the</B>
<P><B>screen kitchen door opened from outside.  (Now this was the type of
door</B>
<P><B>common on old farmhouses &endash; a wood frame screen door held by
a strong</B>
<P><B>spring, and that a visitor would have to pull open from the outside
to</B>
<P><B>come in).   With a swooshing sound - like a gust of wind - came in
an</B>
<P><B>object over and around their heads that looked like a dirty dish towel
&endash;</B>
<P><B>it was greyish-white - and it kept circling wildly and frantically</B>
<P><B>around and around them in the air towards the ceiling.   All three</B>
<P><B>relatives were astounded and terribly frightened.  My grandmother</B>
<P><B>exclaimed in horror: "My, it is the soul of the dead woman!" and with</B>
<P><B>that, she grabbed my mother by the arm and all three ran out of the</B>
<P><B>house just as the old man was coming out of his garden.  He saw them</B>
<P><B>running and he shouted after them,   "Wait, wait!  Why are you
running</B>
<P><B>away, don't you want the potatoes?"  Great-aunt Anastasia who was</B>
<P><B>running, along with my mother and grandmother, turned her head around
in</B>
<P><B>the direction of the old man, and shouted back waving:  "Oh! No! No!
No!</B>
<P><B>we must leave right now, we can't stay, we have something important
to</B>
<P><B>do" and all three ran back in terror to my great-aunt Patsy's farm.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Never again did they go to visit the old man.  They were just too</B>
<P><B>scared!   Being superstitious women, my grandmother and great-aunt</B>
<P><B>cautioned my mother to never tell anyone about what happened or else</B>
<P><B>people will think they are crazy or that something bad will happen
to</B>
<P><B>them.</B>
<P>
<P><B>As I was growing up I could never discuss this occurrence with my</B>
<P><B>grandmother (she was senile by the time I was born in 1961) but I did</B>
<P><B>try with great-aunt Anastasia at a wedding shower in 1987 before she</B>
<P><B>herself died.  She didn't appreciate my having brought up the subject</B>
<P><B>but nevertheless dismissed the word "ghost" (being as superstitious
as</B>
<P><B>she was) and said that she thought that the object was a bat that
flew</B>
<P><B>in.   I have wondered if it were a bird, but of course a bird more</B>
<P><B>closely resembles a bat and it would have made chirping or screeching</B>
<P><B>sounds since it would have been probably frightened in its new</B>
<P><B>surroundings.   My mother, on the other hand, believed and still</B>
<P><B>believes to this day that it was a ghost.  It certainly didn't look
like</B>
<P><B>a bat, bird or even animal to her  (as far as we know, bats come out
at</B>
<P><B>dusk or night - not in broad daylight - and are usually dark
coloured,</B>
<P><B>not greyish-white), and how could a dirty dish towel or rag of some
kind</B>
<P><B>come in by itself from the outdoors and fly like crazy around and
around</B>
<P><B>people standing in a room? (especially when the door had to be pulled</B>
<P><B>from outside in order for someone or something to come into the
house).</B>
<P>
<P><B>I saw the house myself  (from outside and at a distance of about 100</B>
<P><B>yards) a few times in the 1970's as a child.  I recall it being an
old</B>
<P><B>two-storey brown farmhouse from the turn of the century situated not
far</B>
<P><B>from railroad tracks.  Today I do not know if it is still standing
since</B>
<P><B>I haven't visited that part of town since 1979.  (I've heard that
most</B>
<P><B>of the farms are now gone  - the area has become more urban - as
people</B>
<P><B>have been building themselves bungalows there since the
1980's).</B>
<P>
<P><B>Every now and then over the years (now counting 50), the memory of
this</B>
<P><B>event comes up with my mother and still to this day it remains a</B>
<P><B>mystery.  Although we are both not great fans of the paranormal and</B>
<P><B>distrust the majority of psychics, this did happen and we would like
an</B>
<P><B>explanation.   Was the object truly the spirit of the dead woman (as</B>
<P><B>believed by my late grandmother) who appeared because she was upset
by</B>
<P><B>my great-aunt's remark?   Or did an invisible force or spirit open
the</B>
<P><B>door and propel a dirty cloth (resembling a greyish-white towel for</B>
<P><B>wiping dishes) inside the kitchen?   Or was it something else?  We
would</B>
<P><B>also like to know if occurences similar to ours have been seen
before.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Nevertheless, here is a valuable lesson the experience has taught our</B>
<P><B>family: "Speak no evil of anyone, even if they are dead".</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=bed>The Shaking Bed</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:	Desiree26@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was 10 my family moved into a 3 bedroom condo in San Diego.
(My</B>
<P><B>mom, step-dad, 5 yr. old sister and me) After our parents signed the</B>
<P><B>lease, they took me and my sister to go see the place and pick out
or</B>
<P><B>bedroom. (my sister and I were to share one room and make the other
one</B>
<P><B>a playroom for us) We picked out the room we wanted. As my mom, me,
and</B>
<P><B>my sister were standing in that empty room, I said it smells like
peanut</B>
<P><B>butter in here. My mom gave me a startled look then said , yeah, it</B>
<P><B>does. Someone must have had a sandwich in here when they were
cleaning</B>
<P><B>up the place. I woudn't know why my mom looked so startled when I</B>
<P><B>mentioned peanut butter until later. </B>
<P><B>About a week into living in the place, I awoke from a deep sleep in
the</B>
<P><B>middle of the night. My bed was shaking pretty hard. I screamed out
to</B>
<P><B>my mom down the hallway. I said my bed is shaking! My step-dad said
it</B>
<P><B>was probably a little earthquake and to go back to sleep.(By then,
my</B>
<P><B>bed had stopped shaking, so I rolled over and went back to sleep)</B>
<P><B>The next night the same thing happened. The bed was shaking a little</B>
<P><B>harder this time though. It startled me so bad, I jumped up and ran
down</B>
<P><B>the hall to my parents room. I woke up my mom and told her my bed was</B>
<P><B>shaking again. She didn't feel any earthquakes or shaking so she
thought</B>
<P><B>it was my imagination or something and told me to go back to bed. 
</B>
<P><B>A few nights went by and nothing happened to wake me up. Then after</B>
<P><B>about 3-4 days of peaceful nights it happened again. My bed was
shaking</B>
<P><B>very hard. I felt like I was being bounced.(My little sister seemed
to</B>
<P><B>always be in a very deep sleep and would never wake up during the bed</B>
<P><B>shaking like me) I stayed in bed,but I sat up and really screamed out</B>
<P><B>for my mother to come in there. The bed still was bouncing and my
sister</B>
<P><B>didn't even wake up after I had just screamed out for mom. I heard
mom</B>
<P><B>down the hallway saying out loud that this was ridiculous. She got
out</B>
<P><B>of bed and started walking down the hall to my room. She planned on</B>
<P><B>telling me it was just my imagination because the whole house was
sound</B>
<P><B>and quiet and my bed couldn't be the only thing to shake if
everything</B>
<P><B>else wasnt. But as she entered my room, it was very dark and she</B>
<P><B>couldn't see my bed(which was still shaking very hard). She walked
over</B>
<P><B>to my bed's edge and sat down to talk to me. The bed just shook her
like</B>
<P><B>it was shaking me and my sister. My mother realized that the bed was</B>
<P><B>shaking hard and it scared her. She paniced and said go get in her
bed</B>
<P><B>NOW and she scooped up my still sleeping sister in her arms. We all</B>
<P><B>slept in their bed that night . My step -dad said it was all our</B>
<P><B>imaginations now, but they never made me sleep in that room again.
I&lt;</B>
<P><B>usually slept downstairs on the couch from then on.</B>
<P><B>My mom later told me that the landlord had told them that an old man
had</B>
<P><B>died in one of the bedrooms before we had rented it. He died chockig
to</B>
<P><B>death on a peanut butter sandwich. She had thought he meant the room
we</B>
<P><B>made into a playroom, but found out it really was our bedroom.</B>

</H3><P><B>BY: kdale@bellsouth.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I went to college in Brevard, NC. There was an old abandoned house
there</B>
<P><B>just past a daffodil farm.  It was at one time a summer home for a</B>
<P><B>family from Charlotte.  But now it was torn up and run down.  There
is a</B>
<P><B>big farmhouse type house in front, then a brick building RIGHT behind</B>
<P><B>it.  Then behind that on either side, concrete one level rooms
(separate</B>
<P><B>from the buildings) where migrant workers stayed.  Then a big barn</B>
<P><B>behind that.  We used to go to the house because they said it was</B>
<P><B>haunted.  And it IS.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We went there DURING THE DAY.  You could hear voices....several.  And
a</B>
<P><B>woman's voice.  I turned back from standing in front of the barn and
saw</B>
<P><B>a woman standing in the top right back window of the FIRST house. 
I</B>
<P><B>looked away for a second and looked back and realized that you CANNOT</B>
<P><B>see that window from where I was standing - the second building
blocks</B>
<P><B>it!!  I thought maybe I imagined it, but another person with us saw
the</B>
<P><B>same thing.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I went up there one night with a friend.  It was dark, and misty. 
We</B>
<P><B>went into the house.  We had gotten inside the front door and walked</B>
<P><B>into the front right room.  I turned and saw a figure standing in the</B>
<P><B>next room, facing me.  He was a grey figure, an older man.  And so
so so</B>
<P><B>SAD.  I felt a deep and stabbing sadness go from the top of my head
all</B>
<P><B>the way down to my feet.  The friend that was with me was asking me</B>
<P><B>questions about what I saw, and I quietly explained it to him...but
had</B>
<P><B>a hard time speaking and could not move.  But when my friend got to
the</B>
<P><B>door of the room that the figure was standing in, the figure</B>
<P><B>disappeared.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We left right after and the next morning I found myself hugging one
of</B>
<P><B>my stuffed animals, curled in the fetal position and sucking my
thumb.</B>
<P>
<P><B>To THIS DAY I can see that figure in my mind and feel that sadness
as</B>
<P><B>though it was that same day.</B>
