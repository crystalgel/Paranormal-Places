My Cat and I<br>
<br>
By: Jessica.Jantti@HendrickAuto.com<br>
<br>
I have a story to share with everyone. In September of 2005 my mom
kicked me out and I moved into a little 500 square foot apartment in
Kansas City, MO. About 2 weeks after I got all moved in and got
situated I felt eyes staring at me and could never find the source. So
I would leave the TV on thinking that would help the problem. It
didn&#8217;t. I got a cat and she freak out mainly in the bathroom. She would
see something and her tail would puff out real big and she would run
under the bed. Also when I take a shower I have to face out because it
freaks me out to bad to have my back to the shower curtain. In the
middle of December my boyfriend Greg moved in with me. He feels eyes on
him and he has to shower with the bathroom door open. One night when we
were in bed the cat was at the foot of the bed and he felt someone
rubbing his arm I was on one side of the bed and he was on the other
side.&nbsp; We have a king size bed. So there is no way that I or the
cat was rubbing on him. Greg hates being at home by himself.&nbsp;
That&#8217;s my story. Not as scary as some of the others, but true.<br>

My 3 Experiences<br>
<br>
<br>
By: danngo44@googlemail.com <br>
<br>
Hello my name is Dan, and I have had 3 weird paranormal experiences
that i can recall, over the years, I have told the stories many times
and some people believe me, a lot don't. I wouldn't believe me. Now
when I tell the stories I explain that I PROBABLY had an over active
imagination, and I am starting to actually believe it myself, but other
times I think back and then they were so real. <br>
I will start at the beginning, this is my most earliest memory.<br>
I do not know how old I was, but I believe I was around the age of 3 or
4. All I remember is suddenly waking up, and being aware of myself and
my existence, there was no curtain on the window and the bed was
positioned so I could see out of it, it must of been the early hours of
the morning the sky was very dark, and i remember looking at the stars,
as i said earlier I was very aware of myself and everything was really
clear, and i said "God sent me here." but I didn't just say it, and I
didn't just believe it, I knew it. I can not begin to explain why I
said this. I am not religious neither are my parents, but i remember
that night like it was yesterday, the clarity, the tranquility of the
night and how perfect the sky looked outside that bedroom window. I
also remember this feeling of being born, like that very moment was my
first thought and i was fully aware of this fact, and I had a mission.
Saying that "I had a mission" I do not want to fool you into thinking,
that I think that I do have some higher mission on earth, I am just
describing the way I felt at that time. <br>
My second experience.<br>
&nbsp;I was about 6 or 7 years old. It was in the very same bedroom and
once again it was the early hours of the morning, and for some strange
reason I can not explain, I got out of my bed, and headed towards the
window. The window looks out onto our back garden, the garden is about
7 metres in length and 2-3 metres wide. As I looked out of the window
at the end of the garden was a nun, but the colour of her outfit was
not black but white, her dress was flowing in the wind and she was
slightly transparent. and her face was of a middle-aged woman and she
was staring up at me, she was looking right into my eyes, and she did
not look away. her face was warm and I sort of knew that she wouldn't
harm me, but neither the less, I was still very scared, and quickly ran
to my bed, with the covers over my head. Next morning I asked my mum if
she had left a sheet on the washing line, she said no, so i went to the
garden to make sure, and i saw no sheet or anything that could resemble
a nun. Evan to this day after these happenings I am not religious, but
I do believe that there is something out there, but do not know what.
My next experience I had was not a religious one at all, it was scary.
in fact to this day it still is the most terrifying thing that has ever
happened to me. <br>
I was 11 or 12 years old, by this time our family had moved house. at
this age I&nbsp; was scared easily at bedtime, and get paranoid over
little noises, and sleep with the blanket covered over my head so "the
ghosts" couldn't get me, in fact I only stopped sleeping with the cover
over my head till I was about 16 years old, so maybe the previous
incident with the nun had a greater impact on me then I thought. anyway
back to what happened, it was maybe 8-9 pm. We are a big family, and my
mum was going to the shop and she was taking my younger sister with
her, and she asked me to stay at home with the 3 youngest who had fell
asleep watching TV downstairs. So they left for the shop. It must of
been a hot evening because all of the windows were open upstairs, I was
in my bedroom sitting on my bed, when all of a sudden there was this
HUGE roar from the winds, it sounded like nothing I had ever heard
before, it was like 20 men, women and children wailing and shouting as
loud as they could, I quickly jumped out of bed and opened my door.
looked out and all the bedroom doors, apart from 1 of my sisters and
the airing cupboard, were all open, the bathroom door was also open.
Then suddenly I hear BANG one of the windows in a bedroom slamming
shut, BANG another then more BANG BANG BANG BANG. Then what happened
next is the doors all started shutting 1 by 1, by shutting i mean
slamming very hard BANG BANG BANG. I was frozen the whole time when the
windows and doors were slamming but as soon as it stopped, petrified I
ran towards the stairs, I had to get away. a split second later I was
at the stairs. I have to explain that the stairs had a&nbsp; banister,
and also to get down stairs you have to first go down 1 step and there
is a mini square landing, turn 90 degrees to your left and there are 2
more steps and another mini square landing, turn left once more and
take the final lot of about 10-15 steps to take you down stairs. back
to me at the stairs, I get to the first step and WHAM there is this
massive force that hits me from behind and forces me to crash into the
wall, so I'm on the first square landing, turn to my left about to run
then BAM again this unexplainable force thrushes me into the wall by
the next landing. I quickly turn with the final flight of stairs to go,
quickly go to run, got 2 steps when this time another force hits me,
but feeling different this time, instead of pushing from behind it
pushed me from the right, it pushed me towards the banister, then
upwards, my whole body was being lift of the floor then over the
railing, tried to fight back, but it's too late I'm falling, and in the
split seconds I'm falling I'm thinking this is gonna hurt, suddenly I
hit a pile of clothes. we kept the tumble dryer under the stairs, so
some clothes were chucked into a pile. A second after I have fallen and
realised I didn't hurt anything I stood up and turned left where the
door was right in front of me. and yanked open the door, I opened it
about 30 cm's wide, then&nbsp; the door slammed shut with a big bang, I
tried again instinctively as hard as I could, and ran out the door
screaming with horror. I ran down the road relieved to be out the
house, I kept running, caught up with my mum and sister, tried to
explain what had happened, but couldn't in the panicked state I was in,
then my mum reminded me about the younger brothers and sisters. I had
left them, I then tried to mumble the whole story in a rushed 2
sentences (that didn't make sense) and ran back to the house faster
then when I had ran away from it a minute or so earlier, got to my
front door held my breath and went in, ran towards the front room. They
were fine, all sound asleep like nothing had happened. Soon after my
mum and sister arrived and I explained what had happened, they knew I
wouldn't lie about such a thing and leave my little brothers and
sisters for no reason, but were baffled. <br>
Now when I tell this stories, as I'm telling them I try to find ways of
explaining them, maybe with the one about being pushed down the stairs
can be explained that I was in such a panic that I was just running to
fast or had an over reactive imagination. I am 18 years old now and not
scared easily, and I try as hard as I can to rationalize what happened
in each of these 3 events, but I can't, because they were so real, and
even talking about it now spokes me out. <br>
So that was my 3 experiences, and I haven't&nbsp; had anything like
that happen to me since. Thank you for taking your time reading this. I
would be happy for any feedback<br>

Ghost That likes Music<br>
<br>
By: KimTheBossLady@aol.com<br>
<br>
My family has just built this brand new house.&nbsp; We have had
problems before where our stuff would disappear and come back in other
rooms.&nbsp; We seem to have a ghost that likes certain kinds of
music.&nbsp; My sister likes to listen to rap and stuff like that,
while i listen to rock.&nbsp; I take her radio sometimes and put it on
my station, and two minutes later it changes to her channel, i have
never once touched it.&nbsp; Last night we were exersizing and
listening to music.&nbsp; We had three different things we were
listening to.&nbsp; Rock, a cd that was rock, and her rap
station.&nbsp; After we were done, we unplugged all the two radio's on
the floor, and turned the radio off on her alarm clock.&nbsp; When we
into the living room and sat down.&nbsp; A couple of seconds later we
heard music coming from one of the rooms, it was really loud.&nbsp; We
both looked at each other and went back down the hallway.&nbsp; When we
entered the room her alarm clock raido was playing, and normally if it
was playing that loud it would be all fuzzy and hard to hear, but it
came in perfectally clear, it was so strange.&nbsp; Then just this
morning my sister, my brother, and i were sitting on the couch when we
heard the computer turn on after we just turned it off, my brother got
so scared he sat on my lap.&nbsp; Our former ghost from our other house
has followed us.&nbsp; It's been with our family since before i was
born.<br>

Ghost of a Little Girl<br>
<br>
By: Slvrbck05@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
in 2000 i held a job in shaker heights ohio as a apartment manager.I
took care of everything, repairs, grounds mant.,etc. After moving in on
the property, and settling in in my shop, i noticed that i felt like i
was being watched all the timw while i was in my shop. the apartments
were built in 1923, so i knew thqt there is some history there. about
three weeks of being there, i decided to paint ,my shop floor. i was
nasty and it really needed it.<br>
i started at the rear door and painted out the back door. i remember
locking the front door, and i also locked the back door.i came back
sunday moring to check on the floor. i went in the front door, i looked
around, and saw footprints in the paint. i was pissed, because i
thoguht i was the only one with the key to the shop, i had some
expensive tolls in there, and i did not want them stolen. i then
noticed that the footprints where of a child, i did unlock the door to
get in, and the prints looked as if they walked in, and faded away into
the middled of the room. so i was freaked out a little.about a week
later just before easter, i had a oppoinment with the fire marshell to
inspect the property, for smoke detectors, extinguishers, fire hazards,
etc. after walking the whole property we started to talk, i asked him
had there been any fires recently, he looked at his history sheet,
which gave the whole history since 1923, and yes there was a fire. it
involved a mother and a little girl. the fire happend in the D building
on the ground floor. that was next to my shop, he said it happend right
before easter, about a week before easter. i was shocked by all of
this. he also told me that they both died in the fire.<br>
i do remeber for about a week i did smell a strange odor, it smelled
like burning garlic.it was really strong, and i did feel as if
something or someone was watching me.<br>
it has been almost 6 years now, and i dont remeber a-lot about the
place, but there were some strange things that did happen,a-lot of
electrical problems as well, but never saw a ghost, only felt them.<br>

Further Oddity In My House. . .<br>
<br>
<br>
By: hart2art@pacbell.net<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I recalled a few more things about my various encounters. . .One time
while sitting in my room, I was sitting facing a large cabinets which
is in the middle of my wall between two doors, above the cabinet, was
one of those wall clocks that look like a miniature grandfather
clock(which incidentally, my grandfather had actually given me)I was
sitting and all of a sudden, the clock flew out vertically away from
the wall some four feet and spun about top over bottom about three
times and crashed down directly between my legs and as if that weren't
bad enough, I noticed that somehow despite the fact that the glass upon
the little door and face of the clock was and is made of very thin
tissue glass, it did not even fracture even though it came down with a
crash.&nbsp; There was also a time where I was lying down to catch a
nap in my room and I dozed off and when I awoke, I looked at my
reflection in a large mirror which I had moved into the room thinking I
might hang it decorationally and when I looked at myself in it, my
reflection sat up and put it's legs over the side of the bed and simply
looked at me, this went on for some time until I finally jumped up and
as I did my head turned for a moment and "the reflection" had left and
there was only me.&nbsp; More recently, I was home alone with all of
the doors locked and taking a shower in the back shower which is on the
opposite side of the house from the living-room when I heard what
sounded like someone pounding on the door to the bath-room and I moved
the shower curtain to look and it looked as if the door were bulging
inward as if someone were throwing themselves bodily into the door and
it was crashing and then it stopped and everything went dead
quiet.&nbsp; I then heard the most horrible shrieking woman's voice in
the living room I don't know how on earth to explain it except that it
was beyond bone chilling.&nbsp; It sounded as though pain and fury were
combining in some unspeakable way in a woman's shrieking voice from the
living-room which terrified me.I had turned off the shower as soon as I
heard the door pounding and I know it was not the shower making any odd
screechy sounds as the pipes Never make Any sounds and almost all of
them had been replaced several months earlier and the sound came from
the living-room beside and that still wouldn't explain the door bulging
inward or the banging upon the door.&nbsp; Luckily the door did not
actually open, but just then I heard the front door open and my mother
asking how I was that day(she had just come home from her job).&nbsp;
The only other occurrence which I can recall at the moment is that the
room on the other side of the wall which my bed is pushed against, is
the corner bedroom which is reached by the back of the hallway and in
which the suicide attempt occurred and from which so much of the
previous malevolence seemed to emanate seems to frequently have sounds
as of people mumbling on occasion and of heavy furniture moving upon a
hard floor even though there is no furniture in the room and certainly
no heavy furniture, let alone hard flooring as the room is floored in
thick shag carpeting from back when my grandfather was around. . .I
can't think of anything else at the moment.&nbsp; Thank you for having
read my story.<br>

Energy<br>
<br>
By: lynn-jewell@cableone.net<br>
<br>
This is a true story.&nbsp; No one believes me.&nbsp; But I know what I
saw and the following is an accurate accounting of that one summer
night.&nbsp; <br>
In the summer of 1973, my baby was around 18 months old.&nbsp; We lived
in an older wood-framed house in the south Texas coastal area.&nbsp; We
had lived there since early 1972.&nbsp; We didn&#8217;t have central
air-conditioning and the only room that had an air conditioner was the
den.&nbsp; At night we, my husband, two daughters and myself, slept in
the den.&nbsp; My husband and I slept on a full-size mattress on the
floor.&nbsp; My daughters each had a foam cushion for a bed which also
was on the floor.<br>
There were two doors to the den.&nbsp; One door led to the outside, the
other led to the hallway and the front part of our house.&nbsp; Both
doors were solid.&nbsp; There were two sliding windows with lined
curtains.&nbsp; At night, with the lights out, doors closed and drapes
pulled, the den was as dark as cave.&nbsp; So dark, in fact, that you
could not see your hand in front of your face.<br>
On this particularly hot, humid, south Texas night, I woke up to the
sound of my youngest daughter crying.&nbsp; I rolled off my mattress
and crawled on hands and knees toward her foam pad to comfort
her.&nbsp; Before I reached her pad, I saw her in the middle of the
room.&nbsp; As I crawled towards her, she rolled away from me.&nbsp; It
wasn&#8217;t until I reached her sleeping pad that she stopped rolling away
and sat up.&nbsp; At the same moment that she sat up, I touched
her.&nbsp; She was asleep on her pad!&nbsp; What I had thought was her,
rolling away from me, disappeared.<br>
This is my story and I&#8217;m sticking to it.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; <br>
Remember I said the room at night was as dark as a cave?&nbsp; I
decided what I saw was energy.&nbsp; It had to be, why else could I see
it?&nbsp; As far as I could find out there were no deaths of a very
young child.&nbsp; (I really thought I had seen a ghost.)&nbsp; When I
laid back down, my heart was pounding.&nbsp; There is no way I could
have dreamed it.<br>
I have explained what happened to myself in the following manor:<br>
My baby was only around 18 months old.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t old enough to
know how to control her mind and therefore, part of her mind, the part
that older humans shut off, was able to send energy out in what could
be called &#8220;an out of body&#8221; experience.&nbsp; I know this sounds
crazy.&nbsp; If you have a better explanation, I would love to hear
it.&nbsp; I know I saw something that I thought was my baby.&nbsp; I
know when I touched my baby and disturbed her sleep, what I saw
disappeared.&nbsp; I KNOW I did not dream this.&nbsp; <br>
Do you have any idea what I could have seen?<br>

Weird Occurances in Our New Condo<br>
<br>
By: Rachel.Villalobos@fresnoeoc.org<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Last March My husband myself ,our 2 daughters 13 and 17 and toddler son
moved into a beautiful 3 bedroom Condo. We were so excited to have
gotten such a Huge place for such a good price. Looking back I am so
glad we rented and opted out of buying it. Event #1. My 3 year old son
was afraid to enter the kitchen. He told us there was a man or "thing"
under the kitchen table. Never saw him look so frightened. Event #2. I
was in my walk -in closet kneeling on the ground arrainging shoes,when
I felt "something" hit my back .I thought my toddler had ran into me. I
turned to see what was wrong and no one was there. very creepy feeling
.Event#3. My oldest daughter tells me she has been seeing a black shape
moving in the darkness of her room in the middle of the night and
sounds in the closet. she says she just ignores it and it goes away.
I'm scared for her. ( my husband either doesn't sense anything creepy
or won't admit to it. ) Event #4 . my oldest hears something scrathing
at her window. opens the curtains and sees a huge crow hovering at her
window scratching on the window.Yikes!<br>
2 nights later my 14 yr old daughter runs into my room cause the bird is at her window.<br>
A few nights later I hear scratching at my bedroom window. I feel
watched. I don't get up to check. We've noticed a presence near the
long dark hallway. I find myself anxious to get past that area of the
house.I feel a sickly evil presence-like something enjoys seeing us
suffer.we've all heard<br>
During the 3 months we lived there we had the WORST luck. I lost my
job, our car got towed away, then broke down for good, our PGE
skyrocketed from a normal bill of $75 a month to $600.(we never used
more electricity,) we became sickly and irritable. we couldn't afford
to stay, we couldn't afford to move. so we packed up and moved into my
mother's house. As the days passed our luck chaged for the better and
the black cloud of despair lifted. We look back now and feel that
whatever is in that house drains everything good and is evil. I
researched the history of tenants and found no one lasts long living
there. and Bad luck has happened to all who live there. thats as far as
I will go. I'm afraid to look any further. I don't want to know.<br>

A Child's Sighting<br>
<br>
By: englishmrss@msn.com <br>
<br>
While I have never seen an actual ghost, something very strange
occurred a few years ago that I cannot explain.&nbsp; My then four year
old daughter, Savannah, was on the third floor playing on the computer
and printing pictures.&nbsp; I had gone upstairs to call her down for
lunch and she started calling for her father to show him her
artwork.&nbsp; "Daddy!"&nbsp; "Daddy!", she called.&nbsp; I reminded
her that Daddy was working and not at home as was the norm, but she
insisted he was here.&nbsp; After a few rounds of, "Honestly, honey,
he's at work.", she asked me, "Then who was that man?"<br>
My daughter was not prone to imaginary friends, and I asked her, "What
man?"&nbsp; Savannah replied, "Who was that man at the bottom of the
stairs?"&nbsp; <br>
Again I protested that there wasn't a man, but she insisted.&nbsp; I
asked her, "What was the man doing?"&nbsp; She replied, "I was watching
him, and he was watching the bathroom."&nbsp; When I asked her what
happened to the man, because I certainly didn't see him, she replied,
"He disappeared."<br>
At that point I was thoroughly spooked, but I let the issue drop.&nbsp;
She had no idea of ghosts, and wasn't afraid of the dark, and I
certainly didn't want to put any ideas into her head.&nbsp; Nothing
more was said, but few days later, out of the blue, my daughter asked,
"Mommy, what happens if the man comes back?"&nbsp; I told her she
should call me if she saw him again because he didn't belong
here.&nbsp; Fortunately, she never saw him after that.<br>
About six months later, my five year old niece slept over and told me
the next day about a nightmare she had.&nbsp; She had a dream that she
saw a man in my daughter's doorway.&nbsp; When I asked her what
happened to the man, her reply was the same, "He disappeared."<br>
If this is a ghost, he's a very quiet ghost because nothing out of the
ordinary had happened, but I believe the children.&nbsp; If they say
they saw something, they saw SOMETHING - something I can't explain.<br>

Two Experiences<br>
<br>
By: charkl@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Been reading your site for a while.&nbsp; Keep up the good work. The
first experience i call the objective, and the second the subjective.
The first time I was visiting my mother's house in 1984, where I and my
siblings grew up. My mother was the only one living there as my father
had passed away a year earlier. At this time there were five of us: me,
my wife at the time, my mother, and my older brother and his
girlfriend.&nbsp; We were playing Trivial Pursuit on a table in the
middle of a large room. There was a frosted, semi-spherical bowl with
two light bulbs inside directly overhead. It was an old house with an
ornate tin ceiling, and I believe at one time there must have been a
chandelier where this bowl was. The bowl was held in place by a
threaded nut piece that fit over a threaded shaft. As the game neared
completion, and we moved our "pie" pieces toward the center of the game
board, the light bowl fell straight down into the exact center of the
game board, scattering and actually breaking the game pieces. The bowl
didn't break, but just sat there. We were more annoyed than shocked,
and no one was creeped out in any way. We were more amazed that the
bowl didn't break. The only thing that remained to be done was to find
missing end nut so the bowl could be put back up on the ceiling. I
crawled around for ages on my hands and knees, looking under everything
and never found it. I asked my mother months later about it and she
looked for it too and ended up going to the hardware store for a
replacement. It turns out my mother was having experiences with things
"dropping in" that I only heard about later from my sister, who heard
about it from my brother. About a year after my father died, she would
be lying in bed, about to fall asleep, when there would be this rush of
sound and light, then silence as a heavy weight would drop into bed
next to her. She sensed it was my father, but wasn't about to turn
around and find out for sure. This happened a number of times and the
only reason she told my brother was to find a way to stop it! (he has
written about the paranormal) The other experience happened in 2002. My
mother was in the process of selling the same house when she had a
stroke and went to the hospital.<br>
As i was the only one nearby, it fell to me to finish up clearing out
the house for the new owners. I moved in temporarily and room by room
emptied out the old family homestead. It was depressing. And December
no less. I was down to a single bed and lamp and nothing else in this
big old house. One night I woke up from a sound sleep for no reason .
(we've heard this before - a sound sleep, no reason) I was facing the
wall and my eyes popped open like I had just laid down in the middle of
the day and why should I be sleeping? I just lay there absolutely still
thinking: I should really cover up my shoulder - I don't know why but
I'm going to find out, just waiting. Then I feel this overwhelming
fear, this kind of "it found me" feeling.<br>
No bumps or creaks, just fear. A kind of vertigo, falling. I knew
instinctively there was no physical danger, but I could not help
myself. I was giddy, like I'd been tickled till my fingers were weak
and rubbery. I wasn't about to turn around and look. I figured I would
pretend I was asleep and "it" would leave me alone. After awhile I
actually dozed, but I was awoken by a wind. My first thought was that a
window was open. But then I realized that if a window were open it
would be freezing cold, and it didn't seem to have any temperature at
all. My hair was blowing straight up toward the head of the bed. I kind
of didn't mind it because the fear and vertigo were gone. I knew I was
awake, but I was again pretending to be asleep, and did fall asleep
eventually. I think I missed something. I wish I had had more courage,
then I could have seen who was saying hello, or goodbye.<br>

Houston Haunted House<br>
<br>
By: JNM0502@aol.com<br>
<br>
there are two different houses here in houston, texas that i am aware
of them being haunted or what ever it is called. they are both on the
east side of houston, well okay in this house we lived when i was
small. it was me, my little brother and my parents. my parents bought
this house and we had just moved in and then one of my mom's sisters
moved in also with my younger cousin and my uncle.&nbsp; my parents had
had their eye on this house for quite some time, but for some wierd
reason everytime they had the money together to buy it, it was off the
market then something or other would happen and the money would be
spent. then a couple months they would have money again and the same
thing would happen all over. but what is wierd to us now that we thing
about it everytime some one new would purchase the house the new family
would not live in it more than 2 to 4 months and they would leave the
house again. well getting back we had just moved in and were settled in
already when it all began. my parents had the master bedroom with their
own bathroom, me and my brother shared a room and in the third bedroom
was my aunt, uncle and cousin.&nbsp; the first thing that started to
happen was that you could hear a new born baby crying, then we started
to hear the door to garage start to open and close and then the
footsteps walking in to the house and up to the thermostate of the a/c.
then you could hear the thermostate click on and the heater would turn
off and a/c would start to run. this was going on everynight just
about. after about 3 weeks or so my parents while asleep in their room
started to hear the sink run in their bathroom, this only happened a
couple of times to them, and in the morning when they would get up they
found lon straight black hairs in the sink. what made us move out after
all of this going on for about couple months was when my dad and my
aunts found pennies in all of the door knob holes, and they of course
started to pull them all out of curiosity, and that night neither my
dad or aunt were able to sleep.&nbsp; my dad was lying in the bed and
my mom was already asleep when all of a sudden a lady appeared floating
above him with a white gown and long straight black hair trying to get
to my mom and the next morning my dad awoke with scratches on his arms
from that lady, and at this same time my aunt in the other room didnt
sleep either because my cousin kept feeling things crawl all over her.
after this night he moved left the house. my parents didnt even care
that by leaving the house they could have thier credit burned. and
mysteriously the finacnce company didnt do anything about it, the house
is still there and for many years the same thing would happen new
buyers leaving within a couple of weeks or at the most 3 or 4
months.&nbsp; <br>

the second house&nbsp; as well expect it is a mobile home, in which me
and my husband lived in for a short while. in this house i myself had
the experince as a adult already, first it started with hearing
footsteps walk down the hallway from the kitchen to the bedroom. then i
started to hear the doorknobs turn to open and close the doors. i could
also feel a cold presence from time to time. then one night i was about
5-6 months pregnant and i had stayed up late watching tv and my husband
was asleep already and i went to bed. a little while later i got up to
go to the bathroom and as i walked out from my bedroom into the hallway
i saw a lady stepping up into the kitchen at the end of the hallway,
(the hallway is not that long it is about 10 to 15 feet long) this lady
was like glowing faintly she was wearing a long flowing gown or dress
and had long black hair going all over all messed up, she turned her
head back to see me and just had this blank stare. i ran back and
jumped in bed then some time went by and i experienced this again. i
saw this lady again, i have no idea who or what this was. also on
different occasions i would hear some one calling me. after this
happened for a second time we bought a house and moved out.<br>

The Red Eyed Monster<br>
<br>

<br>
A few years back, my stepmother was dating a man other than my
father.&nbsp; This man had a friend that needed them to housesit while
they went on vacation for a couple of days. The family that lived in
the house consisted of two parents and a six year old daughter. All of
the bedrooms and the bathroom were upstairs, and the kitchen,
livingroom, and den were downstairs. When My mother walked into the
house, she immediately had an overwheliming urge to leave the
house.&nbsp; She felt uneasy, and uncomfortable. She was sick at the
time, so she thought that her feelings might have been off. Her
boyfriend decided to run her a bath. When he came back down, his face
was flushed.&nbsp; She asked him what was wrong, and he replied
"Nothing at all darling....You go get in your bath..." So she went up
and took her bath.&nbsp; The whole time she was upstairs, she couldn't
help but feel like something was with her.&nbsp; When she was done, she
walked downstairs and sat with her boyfriend.&nbsp; She told him how
she was feeling and said that she wasn't sure if she would be able to
stay the night.&nbsp; When he heard this, he replied to her, "Honey,
when I went upstairs to run your bath, as I closed the bathroom door
(Which if you opened the door, it blocked the bathroom doorway) after
getting you a towel, there was deep black shadow lingering in the
daughter's bedroom doorway (Which was across the bathroom doorway) It
didn't have a specific shape, but it had distinct, red eyes that glowed
ever so bright.&nbsp; All I could say was, you don't scare me, the
power of the lord protects me. Over and Over I said this. After about
the sixth time of saying this, it turned into the girl's bedroom, and
lurched across the floor, into the closet (The door was shut) My Mom
was so scared that she left the house immediately.&nbsp; Later she got
upset because he let her go upstairs after what he had seen!<br>

The Lady in Pink<br>
<br>
By: astar2envy@yahoo.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This is a pretty long one.<br>
I was around nine years old when this happened. When my brother was
born we turned our garage into a toy room for him. It has a pull out
couch in it so when I had friends over we would sleep there. I had a
friend over one day and we were watching T.V. in the garage while lying
in the pull out couch. We were getting tired so I turned off the T.V. I
closed my eyes but felt a weird chill pass over my body. I opened my
eyes again and looked back at the T.V. for some reason and I saw a lady
sitting on top of it. She had brown hair pulled back into a really
fancy bun and a really nice pink dress on. She just sat there looking
at me for while. Then she disappeared. At the moment I was extremely
tired so I didn't think much of it but then in the morning I woke up
and remembered what happened. My friend thought it was a dream when I
told her but I know it wasn't. I have another experience with the same
lady. I had a different friend over this time and this was when we were
much older so we didn't sleep in the garage anymore. But I have a
refrigerator in there. So my frie and I went in there to get a soda
from the fridge at about 9 at night. We opened the door and there was
the lady sitting on the same T.V. My friend and I both saw her so I
know it wasn't a dream. We flipped the light on and looked back at the
T.V.. She was gone. After this I kinda got scared. My friend and I got
our soda and got out of there. After that I didn't see the lady for a
while. But then about a year later I was sick with a fever and a soar
throat and I was in my parents bed. They have a T.V. hanging from the
wall. My parents were out at dinner for my aunts birthday so I was home
alone with my brother who my parents had put to bed before they left.
It must have been around 9:30 this time. I was just drifting off to
sleep when I, for some strange reason, looked at the T.V.. I saw the
same lady sitting on the corner of it. I was pretty delirious from the
fever so I ignored her and went to sleep. I woke up the next morning
and was in my own bed. My parents had put me there when they got home.
I remebered what had happened and told my parents. Ofcourse they didn't
believe me. They said that I was sick and that it was my imagination.
After this I realized that it all happened at night when I was in a
dark room and by a T.V.. The only witness I have is my friend who is
still scared of my garage at night. My house isn't haunted. The only
thing that might relate to it is that my grandma died in my house. but
she doesn't look like her and it doesn't explain why I always see her
at night and by a T.V. I'm just glad that the ghost isn't violent.<br>

The Apartment<br>
<br>
By: elvalene@peoplepc.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I've had a couple few different experiences with ghosts.&nbsp; Mostly
when I was a child, and I guess a couple times when I was a baby
according to my mom,but of course I don't remember those
experiences.&nbsp; I'll tell you about my first experience that I can
remember.<br>
When I was about four or five, my moms husband moved us to Peublo,
Colorado.&nbsp; We moved into what I guess was an apartment building
but to me it looked like a giant house.&nbsp; I think it was really
old.&nbsp; My mememory of what the outside of the house looked like is
kind of blurry.&nbsp; It seemed like it was two or three storys, with a
victorian kind of build, but it looked adobe style too, like the walls
were made of clay.&nbsp; Our apartment was in the lower right corner
(if you were faceing the house).&nbsp; We had a one level apartment and
part of the basement down below.<br>
You could tell whoever owned the place tried making the basement into a
room.&nbsp; It was completely conrete, but they had carpeted part of it
and painted the concrete walls white.&nbsp; The other half of the room
was the laundry area.&nbsp; On the side of the room that was carpeted
there was a giant hole in the wall.&nbsp; It was perfeclty square and
purposefully put there when whoever made the place.&nbsp; It ran the
entire length of the wall except for one side that ended at the
stairway.&nbsp; It was about three feet off the ground and I'm guessing
maybe a foot from the ceiling.&nbsp; To this day I have no idea what
the purpose of that hole could have been.<br>
The moment I saw that hole, which was when the realtor lady was showing
us the apartment, I was scared to death of that hole.&nbsp; I didn't
know why, I just hated it.&nbsp; It was so dark inside you couldn't
tell where it ended.<br>
As it turned out, this basement room ended up being my room because it
had the most space for all my toys and belongings.&nbsp; I hated it
there.&nbsp; Every night I was frightened stiff.&nbsp; I would just lay
there and try not to make the slightest move until I fell to
sleep.&nbsp; It was like I didn't want to get anyones attention even
though I was the only one in the room.<br>
I'm not sure how long we lived in that house but I would guess about a
year.&nbsp; Nothing happend for the first few months and I was starting
to relax more in my room, though I still never stepped foot anywhere
near that hole.&nbsp; I remember watching my mom hang clothes up to dry
in front of that hole and thinking how brave she must be.<br>
And then one night when I was sleeping, I felt someone pull my
hair.&nbsp; It wasn't just a couple little hairs getting caught under
my head either, it was like someone grabbed a good lock and yanked on
it very fast and very hard.&nbsp; It hurt quite a bit and it jerked me
awake.<br>
I automatically looked up towards the hole in the wall and I saw from
the back what appeared to be a very tall, very wide man.&nbsp; He was
wearing a big black coat that looked "oldfashioned".&nbsp; I'm not a
fashion/history expert, but I would guess it was 40's style.&nbsp; This
is kind of silly, but when I look back at the image of him I still have
in my head, his coat kind of looked "Dick Tracy" style.&nbsp; That's
the only example I can think of.&nbsp; He walked very slow and swayed
from side to side as he did so.&nbsp; He walked straight into that hole.<br>
I immediatly ran upstairs for my mom but she worked graveyards at
Dunken Doughnuts and wasn't home.&nbsp; It was just her jerk husband
and I didn't like him.&nbsp; So I went to go lay on the couch in the
living room but before I got there, I got this feeling that I should
stay away from the couch and the livingroom in general.&nbsp; So
instead, I went and layed on the floor in front of my moms bedroom door.<br>
I think I might have dosed off, I'm not sure, but eventually I got
really cold.&nbsp; I decided to be brave and sit on the very edge of
the couch, closest to the kitchen (which is where I was, my moms
bedroom was on the opposite side of the kitchen across from the
livingroom).&nbsp; The couch had a blanket on it that I wanted to cover
up with.<br>
As soon as I sat on the edge of the couch, the man appeared
again.&nbsp; He walked through the door (literally through it) and was
moving slowly towards me.&nbsp; He wore the big black coat, and had a
long, bushy, dark brown beard that covered almost all of his
face.&nbsp; The hair on his head was shaggy and dark brown as well and
he may have been wearing some kind of cap.&nbsp; He had his arm
stretched out and was pointing at me.&nbsp; He was either moaning or I
just couldn't understand what he was saying but it seemed more like he
was trying to make words but couldn't.<br>
I slowly tried to grab the blanket off the couch but it seemed like he
started moving quicker when I did this.&nbsp; So I left the blanket
there and ran to my moms room.&nbsp; I layed down again on the floor in
front of my moms bedroom door and eventually I fell asleep because the
next thing I knew, my mom had come home.&nbsp; <br>
I told my mom everything that had happend.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when I
described the man, I compared the way he looked to "Chubaka" from that
movie Star Wars.&nbsp; It was because he was so hairy.&nbsp; As a
child, that was the only way I knew how to best describe him.&nbsp; My
mom told me I had just had bad dreams because of that movie.<br>
It seems like more happened in that house, but I don't remember
anything else.&nbsp; I kind of think I might have blocked some things
out because it scared me so much.&nbsp; As I said, we didn't live there
that long anyway.<br>
My mother and I never spoke about that house again until I was
twelve.&nbsp; I started telling my mom all kinds of memories I had from
when I was very young and I ended up telling her what happened that
night with greater detail.&nbsp; She said that she remembered that
night too, and that she had believed me but didn't want to scare me
anymore than I allready was, so she said it was nightmares.&nbsp; She
said that quite a few "strange" things happend to her also and that she
had tried to tell her husband but he didn't believe her.<br>

My experience started in 1986 the night after my Father died.&nbsp; I
had spent the previous night with my Mother and went home the next
night to rest.&nbsp; in the middle of the night I was Waken up by cold
wind blowing on me, as i opened my eyes i seen a soft bur bright light
move toward the end of my bed.&nbsp; The light was my Father he sat
down and patted my arm and said that he loved me and that I should take
care of my mom.&nbsp; I felt a cold brush on my cheek and he told me "
I love you and remember I made the choice to make you my daughter you
are that special,&nbsp; and i will always be with you."<br>
He has come to me in the summer of 1993 when i was swimming and got a
cramp and I was going down into the water.&nbsp; People on a boat were
yelling but I knew that they could not reach me in time.&nbsp; Then I
felt arms holding me up until the boat could get to me.&nbsp; "
Remember your special and I am here," in a whisper.<br>

Scared Stiff<br>
<br>
By: keysers1girl@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
When my ex-husband and I were dating, we lived for a couple of years
with his sister in the house that he grew up in. The house was an older
house, probably built in the early 1900's in downtown Rochester
Michigan. My ex-husbands mother had died in that house and I heard
somewhere that a man had hung himself in the garage in years past. I
had always had that uncomfortable feeling like someone was staring at
me in that house. You know that feeling like someone is burning holes
in your back? When I would turn around there would, of course, be no
one there.<br>
One weekend my ex-husband and his sister went up north for the weekend
and I stayed home alone because I had just started a new job and
couldn't get time off to go with them. That Sunday night, while laying
in bed in our room (the room where his mother died, by the way), I
heard them come home. It was about 11:30pm and I heard the back door
open, I heard them go down the stairs to the basement and I heard them
unloading t truck (they brought stuff home from the cabin up north). I
heard them going down the stairs and moving stuff in the basement. When
I got up to go say "Hi" and greet them, I opened the door to the
basement and it was pitch black down there. The back door that leads to
the basement was shut and deadbolted from the inside. I suddenly got
the most horribly uncomfortable feeling. I took off right away and went
to sleep at my mom's house.<br>
Another time when I was staying there alone, I was (again) laying in
bed and someone banged on the window that was less than 3 feet from my
head. Not a knock or a tap, but a bang so hard that it rattled the
glass in the window. Again, it was about 11:30 at night. For a while I
was frozen and couldn't move at all. I was scared stiff..........I left
the house and went to my mom's again that night.<br>
Also, when I was about 2-3 years old we lived in Royal Oak Michigan and
I remember (very clearly) a horrifying exerience that has stayed with
me my whole life. I had a doll that, when you turned it on, would crawl
across the floor. When it crawled it made a humming or whirring noise.
One night while in bed, I woke up to this noise and could see the
silohette of this doll as it crawled across my bedroom floor (my room
was dark, but the hall light was on). I started screaming and my mom
came in and took the doll away. From that day on, I would have nothing
to do with it. My mom even took the batteries out and everything, I
still wouldn't touch it. This is one of my first memories as, like I
said I was only 2 or 3 at the time.&nbsp; It creeps me out, just
writing all of this down.<br>

Rotten Smell at Eleven Oaks<br>
<br>
By: tohicha7@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I grew up on a five-acre tract in Witcher, Oklahoma that is 2 acres of
cleared land and 3 acres wooded.&nbsp; Over the years we mowed paths in
the woods, careful to protect a small portion of the Chisholm Trail
that runs through our property.&nbsp; There are many psychic &#8220;hot
spots&#8221; on our land and some of these spots provided experiences for me
that began in my early childhood.<br>
One spot in particular is an area in our woods we have always called
the &#8220;Eleven Oaks&#8221;.&nbsp; This area is not large but has always smelled
of rotting flesh.&nbsp; We thought at first that the odor was caused an
animal carcass or by some sort of vegetation and were proved wrong when
the smell was just as noticeable during snows, ice storms, etc.&nbsp;
There is little underbrush in this wooded area and we were never able
to find a source for the smell.<br>
Two years ago I had a friend visit who is incredibly sensitive to
spiritual phenomena.&nbsp; I took her through our woods and we ended up
at Eleven Oaks.&nbsp; This was in the late fall and we mutually decided
to enter the midst of the Oaks to see if we could pick up on any
vibes.&nbsp; I had only informed her that there was a smell in this
area.<br>
Immediately we both had difficulty breathing.&nbsp; I felt water in my
nose and mouth and continually tried to spit it out and was only able
to produce a tiny amount of spittle.&nbsp; I had the impression that my
head was being shoved into an old wooden barrel and frantically tried
to get my head out of the water by pushing against the sides of the
barrel.&nbsp; My struggles became ever more feeble as the long-past
individual whose memory I shared lost their life.&nbsp; <br>
My friend helped me out of the area and we were able to breathe freely
once again.&nbsp; The smell was back in force and I explained to my
friend that I felt that the drowned person was a man.&nbsp; I also felt
that he had been sealed in the barrel after his life was taken.&nbsp;
She had felt the same way and ventured to say that he might even be
buried there.&nbsp; I am not yet brave enough to dig and find out &#8211;
perhaps in time.<br>

Real Story<br>
<br>
By: khuranakshitij@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It is quite nice to learn about the existence of a website such as
yours and the way you care about the people who are scared and need
some help.<br>
My name is Kshitij and am a citizen of India. My story is not as bad as
it could have been, but still i would like to share it with the people.<br>
It was in the month of March in 2004 when i was standing at the porch
watching my younger brother and his friends play cricket. One of the
batsman took a shot and the ball went out of the fence that had been
there since more than 10 years. It was a real pain to go all the way
round and reach the other side of the fence as it involved several
minutes of walking. <br>
Interestingly, it&nbsp; has always been preferable to wait for a
passer-by and ask him/her to throw the ball in. The kids had been
waiting for someone to pass that place so that they could ask for that
favor. I was standing and doing the same. My brother had his hand near
the fence and he was quite keen to catch the ball which was expected to
come in their directon anytime in few moments.<br>
Then to my surprise, a ball suddenly came from nowhere directly into
his palm. I was shocked to hell as i knew there was noone on the other
side. <br>
Fortunately, the kids thought that it was me who had thrown the ball
and were amused by the precision that i could direct the ball. They saw
me with some sort of excitement and i asked them to continue their
game. I acted as if i had thrown the ball. I knew if i would have
denied, it could have created some sort of horror amongst them.<br>
I tried to look again if there was someone who might have thrown the ball, but in vain.<br>
I cannot forget that incident and it almost scares me to visualise the whole scene again.<br>
I know for sure, if there was a ghost involved, then it dint mean harm and wanted the kids to play.<br>
But who threw the ball? And was that a different ball or it was the one that had popped out of the boundary?<br>
That was my first hand experience. I hope you reply back with your views on the same.<br>

Blast from the Past<br>
<br>
By: SDaughtery@unumprovident.com<br>
<br>
When I was a young teenager around 13 or 14, my cousin Judy and her
family had rented a home on the Tennessee/Georgia line. This was a huge
house with plenty of bedrooms for Judy and her 4 siblings. It had a
wraparound porch and three fireplaces. It was a gorgeous old home;
probably built in the early 1920's if not earlier; and there were huge
oak and maple trees complete with tire swings in the front yard. Judy,
who was 2 years older than me, instantly hated that house. She said
that it scared her. Her mother passed it off as that adolescent dislike
of anything and everything. <br>
After about a month in that house, Judy had changed. She was always
sleepy and cranky, always jumpy and looking over her shoulder like she
was scared. When I asked her what was wrong she insisted that it was
the house. She said that there were strange voices, odors and
unexplainable movement from furniture at night that she was almost
unable to sleep at all. When I tried to be rational, she snapped at me
and demanded that I go and see for myself. <br>
That night, I arrived with a small tape recorder and blank cassette
tape (something one of my classmates told me to do) and readied myself
for bed. Just after 11 pm, I awoke to the sound of fingernails tapping
rhythmically on a wooden table. Figuring it was just Judy trying to
save face, I rolled over and went back to sleep. A short time later,
the radio alarm clock sounded, blaring some static-filled rock tune. I
turned it off thinking again that it was just Judy pulling another
prank. Later still, I awoke freezing cold. All of the blankets were
piled at the foot of the bed. Judy was sitting with her back to the
headboard and her knees curled up under her chin and her arms wrapped
around them. She was staring glazed eyes at the dresser mirror where
there was this faint, fog-like mist reflecting in it. Again, thinking
it was all Judy's doing, I gathered up the covers and went back to bed.
<br>
Finally, very late in the night I was again awakened to the sound of
someone calling my name. It was very distinct and not something Judy
could pull off especially considering she lay next to me sound asleep.
I shook her awake and she heard it too. We sat there listening for what
felt like hours then it just stopped and there was an uneasy stillness
in the room. Suddenly, the bedroom door slammed shut and the dresser
drawers opened and slammed closed of their own accord. A guttural
growling sound filled the room; getting louder and louder until it was
echoing throughout the house. When it finally subsided, we could hear
beating and knocking on the bedroom door. It took us a few moments to
realize that it was Judy's mom trying to get in to us. <br>
When her mom finally got in Judy and I were in tears. Somehow the door
had locked itself and it was one of those old locks that require a
skeleton key to lock or unlock. Her mom wanted to know what we had been
doing to cause such a raucous. When we began to tell her about all of
the odd events, she shushed us and emphatically stated that "There are
no such things going on in this house!" No sooner had she gotten the
words out of her mouth the rocking chair in the living room just
outside of Judy's bedroom began rocking. I mean rocking so violently
that it was pounding the floor. After that, the kitchen and living room
lights began to flicker on and off. <br>
Judy and her family moved from the house the very next day. The day
after Judy and her family moved, one of her brothers found the tape
recorder and began listening to the tape. There were at least 3
different voices heard and no one could decipher what language the
voices were speaking in. Judy threw that tape in a brush fire after
listening to it and said that those were the sounds she'd been hearing
since day one. <br>
On a side note, that tape recorder NEVER worked again. When my dad took
it to a repair shop, they could not find a thing wrong with it; it
simply would not work. <br>
I had forgotten about that night and that house until this past
weekend. My spouse and I were driving around looking for a place to
hunt when we stopped at a 4-way stop. A chill came over me and my feet
began to burn as if I was suddenly standing on hot coals. I felt light
headed, nauseous and weak when he said "Man, look at that house. It's
like its staring at us. Gives me the hee-bee-gee-bees." When I looked
to my left, there it was like a nightmarish blast from a long forgotten
past. <br>
I called Judy when we got home and told her about seeing that old
house. Judy, now almost 35, was extremely upset at the mention of that
house. She made it very clear that she did not want to discuss that
house or anything that went on behind its doors and she made me swear
to never bring it up to her again. <br>

Our Very Active House<br>
<br>
By: fluffiepie.1984@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
From 2001 to 2003 my Grandma and I lived in a house in Boonville,
Mo.&nbsp; The house was my uncle's house, but it used to be a duplex,
so my grandma had one side, he had the other, and I had the upstairs
that went from his side up.&nbsp; First I have to say, that the house
always felt weird.&nbsp; It used to be a vets office, and between the
two halves of the house, there is a little hallway about 3 1/2 feet
long with a door on her side, a door on his side, and a door to the
basement. The doors in the house stuck at sometimes of the year, and
wouldnt stay shut the other part of the year.&nbsp; This was the part
of the year that they wouldnt stay shut, they just swung all the way
open.&nbsp; I went downstairs to go talk to my grandma, and when i went
into the hall, both doors slammed shut. The basement door, which always
latched very well and stayed latched, started to swing open and stopped
at about an inch. I know it was about an inch because my hand was on
the door.&nbsp; There was a really really cold draft coming from the
crack in the door, and our basement wasn't that cold around that time
of year.&nbsp; I screamed and started banging and pushing on all three
doors (it was pitch black in there, there wasnt a light.) and finally
the basement door shut quickly and both doors just swung open.&nbsp; I
went in and told my grandma, and she said she heard the doors shut, and
thought it was weird, but didnt hear me screaming.<br>
Another time, we had been gone all day, and so had my uncle.&nbsp; We
didnt have a big ladder, and no one around there had seen anyone on our
roof.&nbsp; I went upstairs, and walked into the bathroom, which was
right across from a window.&nbsp; I paused for a couple seconds, then
turned around.&nbsp; The window, frame and all, were laying on the
floor, there were a couple marks on the wall where the corners hit as
it was falling down, and there were linters of wood all over the floor.
We checked and there werent any pry marks, and no marks outside, and no
handprints on the window like someone had pushed it.&nbsp; My uncle
still thinks i somehow pryed it off the wall.&nbsp; That is the window
he kept telling me to keep shut.&nbsp; I tried but it was one of those
windows that opens from the top and leans in...everytime i shut it and
locked it, it would come open.&nbsp; He slammed it shut and the next
time it was open, was when the window "fell off the wall" as we put it.
<br>
There were other things that happened in that home...almost all of it
happened upstairs...The locked doors would pop unlocked, open, shut,
then re-lock themselves.&nbsp; If I put too many things on top of the
filing cabinet in the corner of my bedroom, it would shake violently
until some stuff fell off.&nbsp; When anyone went up or down the
stairs, something grabbed your ankles about halfway, and tripped
you...I had a particularly nasty fall down the stairs one time.&nbsp;
The closet doors in the hallway would open and close slowly sometimes.
The stairs came up in the middle of the hallway, and there was a
walkway all the way around, the side that no one ever walked on had
really really cold spots.&nbsp; The couple of things that happened that
were not upstairs were one time I had my door open and was just laying
there thinking, and I saw something come from my upstairs living room,
and walk down the stairs slowly.&nbsp; I followed it down the stairs
(on my rear end so i didnt get tripped) and through to my grandma's
side of the house.&nbsp; My grandma started talking when it was still
in the shadows, she thought she was talking to me, and I was still in
her kitchen.&nbsp; When I ran in there, she stopped and asked if I was
standing there, who was in the shadows?&nbsp; I told her...that was her
first experience with a ghost.&nbsp; Also, all of the time, it seemed
that the house was listening and watching everything that I d, even
outside.&nbsp; All in all, that was a very "active" house and I am glad
I dont live there anymore.<br>

Our Story<br>
<br>
By: MLDavis@Sauer-Inc.com<br>
<br>
We moved into our house in August of 2001.&nbsp; We first realized we
had a ghost when I was sitting on the toilet and the toilet paper in
front of me suddenly and very quickly began to unroll into a perfect
pile on the floor.&nbsp; This happened once to my husband also.&nbsp;
Soon it began.&nbsp; Here are some of the things we have experienced
with our ghost.&nbsp; We have a woman who died in our sons room, her
name is Della (we know this from buying the house from her nephew) and
we have a male ghost, but we do not know who he is<br>
&nbsp;*Our son will sit in the game room and turn his stereo on.&nbsp;
It will turn off.&nbsp; He will get up and turn it back on.&nbsp; It
will turn off.&nbsp; He finally after awhile gets frustrated and leaves
it off.<br>
*Once my husband was plugging in the television in the game room and he
felt a breath on his neck and heard a female voice say &#8220;Too hot&#8221;.&nbsp;
We do not know what she meant by that.<br>
*Our son was sitting in the upstairs TV room on day.&nbsp; We have a
bookshelf in this room.&nbsp; On the top shelf were two tall candles
and plants.&nbsp; The candle came up over the plants, across to the
middle of the floor and hit him on his knee.<br>
*One evening my husband and I were the only ones home and we heard a
crash in the kitchen.&nbsp; One of our glasses had come out of the top
cabinet and smashed into the middle of the kitchen floor.<br>
*One morning we woke up and the kitchen stool which had been under the
table at the end of the kitchen was in front of the stove as if Della
had been sitting there watching something cook.<br>
*We had several people over and video taped the comforter on our bed being straightened by invisible hands.<br>
*Also at this time we asked &#8220;What are you doing here&#8221;.&nbsp; A male
voice whispered &#8220;Watching&#8221;.&nbsp; That is when we realized we had not
only Della but a male ghost as well.<br>
*We smell her perform a lot.<br>
*We have had on numerous occasions the smell of baking bread and no one was baking bread.<br>
*According to her nephew she died in our son&#8217;s bedroom in the month of
June.&nbsp; The first June that we were there we had approximately 7
times that the police would call and say that they had just received a
hang up 911 call.&nbsp; After awhile we figured out who was doing it
and removed the telephone from that room. It never happened again.<br>
*One summer evening my husband was in the back yard.&nbsp; When I
walked out he asked &#8220;Where&#8217;s my beer?&#8221;.&nbsp; I did not know what he
was talking about.&nbsp; He said he thought it was me walking through
the kitchen and he had yelled up for me to bring a beer.&nbsp; I had
not been upstairs I was down in the laundry room.<br>
*Our son took a picture with his camera cell phone of the dark figure of a man sitting at our desk in front of the computer.<br>
*We have things like our shoes being upstairs and ending up downstairs, just small things like that being moved.<br>
*We can hear someone walking around upstairs when we are downstairs in the game room.<br>
It has just become our way of life.&nbsp; They are like part of the
family.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t even consciously notice half the stuff happening
anymore because we are so use to living with them.<br>
<br>

My Story<br>
<br>
By: yellowpinkrose22@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Hey, my name is Kelly and i dont have much of a story but it sure as
heck freaked me out. The other night i was out playing with a little
girl i know and it started to storm. My mom called me and told me she
wanted me to come home so i wouldnt be out in the middle of the storm.
The drive is probably about 10 mins at the most. Well a friend of
mine's house that was killed in a car accident house is on my way home.
As i was driving past i got this urge to look at the house and in the
yard was this fog looking stuff. It scared the crap out of me because
the fact that no where else around had any kind of fog. After i thought
about it for a few seconds i felt it was him just protecting his family
and that i shouldnt been scared.<br>

My Haunted House<br>
<br>
By: Imbiggiemac@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
(I attempted to send this recently but wasn't sure if you got it...excuse me if you did get it)<br>
My name is Carolyn and I'm from Virginia.&nbsp; I was born in the small
college town of Lexington, VA...home of Washington &amp; Lee Universary
and Virginia Military Institute (VMI) and a very historical town.&nbsp;
One steeped in Confederate history and southern culture.<br>
I was born in 1950, literally in a historical house that was built
right before the Civil War, a house that was the parsonage for the
black Methodist Church back then.&nbsp; We had many frightful sounds
that couldn't be explained, such as moaning's, mumbling's, walking,
toilets flushing all by themselves, grandfather clock, ticking sounds
when there were none of these clocks in the house, gasping sounds like
someone unable to breathe and many more weird noises.&nbsp; There were
no furnaces to explain this, only coal and wood stoves in the
three-story home.&nbsp; A home with an old 1800's wooden coffin in the
basement along with an old well inside the basement with boards
covering it.<br>
Also, once my mother saw what looked like a man in a long black coat
and hat where no one could have been, who vanished before her
eyes.&nbsp; My sister saw what looked like two small girls in white
floating in the air and I saw doors open and shut on several different
occasions when no wind or draft was present.&nbsp; Footstep sounds were
a common occurrence.&nbsp; There were noises that sounded like someone
clinking glass around and scratching sounds to mentions a few other
noises that would keep us awake and frighten us.<br>
Growing up in a Christian home, we were taught not to be afraid, to
just call on God and His Son, Jesus Christ.&nbsp; That they were
"ghosts" and couldn't hurt us, just maybe make us hurt ourselves
running from them.&nbsp; But from the Bible I learned that they were
evil spirits posing as "ghosts."&nbsp; I realize that this isn't a
popular belief but this is the one that I find sits well with me.&nbsp;
The Bible says "the dead don't know anything" and that we are "forbid
to speak to the dead." <br>
I have seen chairs rocking by themselves, things disappearing and then
reappearing later.&nbsp; I watch TAPS shows since I at least see others
having some of the same strange occurrences happening to them that I
did.&nbsp; Kudos for at least alerting people to the fact that there
are spiritual entities out there and you can't just deny it any
longer.&nbsp; That there is a way to get rid of those "unwanted guest."<br>
My point is, whether they're called "ghosts," "demons," or "spirits,"
there is a spiritual element out there whether you believe it or
not!&nbsp; As for me I KNOW that there is something out there and it's
not always friendly and peaceful or "Grandma" or "Aunt Bessie".&nbsp;
Why some see or experience them, I don't know but the Bible talks about
a gift called "the discerning of spirits" and that's good enough for me
as an explanation.<br>

Murdered Lover Materializes<br>
<br>
By: marigold33@earthlink.net<br>
<br>
One of the scariest things that ever happened to me happened at a
beautiful old three story apartment building on the north side of
Chicago, on Beacon Street.&nbsp; It was over a hundred years old and
had a beautiful carved stone masonry facade, though inside it was quite
drafty and the plumbing ancient.&nbsp; But it was quite
affordable.&nbsp; I went to live there in 1996 and eventually had to
leave when the owner sold the building and it was converted to condos.<br>
Now the Beacon St. place was spooky as hell. I'm not sure if it was all
the same entity or not but there were footsteps and the clinking of
china and silverware unmistakably from our kitchen that I would hear in
the evenings and on weekends. It was always dark in the place, no
matter what we did. I never spoke to my roommate about the things I was
hearing because she was a scaredy cat.&nbsp;&nbsp; I never really
acknowledged the activity to myself, either. <br>
But the worst thing that happened in the place, to me, was this: I was
reading on my bed one day, not in the bed, and laid the book down and
was awake and daydreaming, far far away from my immediate surroundings.
I was suddenly paralyzed - couldn't move a muscle, couldn't scream, and
at the foot of my bed a man materialized. He was pretty young and
handsome, perhaps in his late twenties, and such a terrible negativity
came off of him, such hatred and nastiness, that it hurt my body.. He
was very solid for probably only a few seconds, staring at me fixedly,
before he started dematerializing. I was just gasping when he let go of
me. It was horrendous.<br>
The kicker: My roommate had had the place for 5 years or so before I
moved in with her - 10 years by the time we had to leave. The landlord,
a Greek lady name of Georgia, told us that right before the roommate
moved in, two gay men had lived there together. They were heavy drug
users and heavily into S&amp;M, and often had terrible fights - she
told us the cops had to come out often. One night the older partner
stabbed the younger partner to death - I never found out in what room.
But I'm guessing that was who visited me that night.&nbsp; Georgia only
told us this on the eve of our leaving, not wanting to frighten the
roommate out of the place, though I have a feeling something might have
happened in the past that made her doubly afraid to say anything.<br>

Mom's Visit<br>
<br>
By: sue32336@netscape.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I wanted to share a story that proves that love continues even after
death.&nbsp; My son and his wife (who live in another state) were
expecting their first baby in the first part of December.&nbsp; My 80
year old mother couldn't wait for the baby to be born.&nbsp; She was so
excited!&nbsp; Every time I talked to her everything would be about the
baby. In mid October, Mom suddenly fell ill and was hospitalized.&nbsp;
My son and his wife came down and spent a lot of time with Mom in the
hospital, making plans for the baby, etc.&nbsp; On November 5, Mom
died.&nbsp; My beautiful granddaughter was born December 1 and was
named after her Great-Granny.&nbsp; It was very bittersweet, as we love
the baby more than anything and so glad she was healthy but it was also
very sad knowing how much Mom wanted to see her.&nbsp; Well, death did
not keep Mom from seeing her first great-grandchild!&nbsp; While in the
hospital, my daughter-in-law was alone in the room with the baby, kind
of dozing in and out.&nbsp; Suddenly, she felt something nudge the end
of her bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked up and saw Mom at the foot of her
bed, smiling at her.&nbsp; About this time, the baby started to
fuss.&nbsp; My daughter-in-law watched in awe as Mom glided across the
room to the baby and started rubbing her back.&nbsp; The baby
immediately quieted down and Mom slowly faded away.&nbsp; <br>
The baby is now a month old and my daughter-in-law says that now that
they are home, the house will start to feel "different" and the baby
acts like someone is playing with her!&nbsp; I think we know who her
Guardian Angel is! <br>

Lady in White<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
This is a kind of lame "ghost" story, but here goes.<br>
The encounter has confused me for many years...<br>
Something bizarre happened to me when I was about 11 years old.<br>
I had been sleeping and woke up to find (in broad daylight) a woman standing at the foot of my bed.<br>
Everything in the room was hazy.&nbsp; I know it sounds very clich&eacute;, but she was wearing a white gown.<br>
She was a white woman with shoulder-length brown hair.<br>
Strangely enough, she was not interested in me.&nbsp; She was actually rifling through my collection of Atari game cartridges.<br>
I was not scared at all.&nbsp; Looking back on it gives me the chills,
but at the time, it was not scary, and she seemed peaceful.<br>
I sat up in the bed and inquired, "Mom?" Knowing very well this person was NOT my mom.<br>
My mom was much shorter and Japanese.&nbsp; The woman never looked at me.<br>
I laid back down, confused.<br>
Sat back up and she was gone.<br>
After that, I've never experienced any paranormal activity.<br>
My mom passed away in 1993.&nbsp; I had always HOPED that she would appear to me, but she never did...<br>

Is there a Ghost in my House<br>
<br>
<br>
By: arleneodiaz@earthlink.net<br>
<br>
Hello!&nbsp; I have been enjoying your site for about 3 months
now.&nbsp; I have great interest in the paranormal, but from a
distance. . . I'm not sure I want to have an actual experience, if you
know what I mean.&nbsp; Supposedly, my grandmother who I never met was
clairvoyant and could contact spirits.&nbsp; This gift was not passed
on to me - I have never had an encounter.&nbsp; But some one in my
family did - in my&nbsp; home!!<br>
About 4 years ago we went on vacation to Florida for a glorious 2 weeks
(my husband, son, and myself).&nbsp; We had been in our home about a
year.&nbsp; We asked my brother in law, whom I will call "Jake", his
wife "Susan" and their daughter "Emily" if they would spend the
weekends in the house and cut the grass for us while we were gone and
they said yes.&nbsp; That Friday night when they came over, Jake was
asleep in our bedroom on the first floor (cape cod) along with Emily
and Susan was watching TV in our family room.&nbsp; Susan sees her
daughter Emily come out of the bedroom, cross the living room towards
the stairway heading upstairs (there are 3 bdrms and a full bath
upstairs).&nbsp; She called out to her and Emily did not answer, so
Susan got up to follow her.&nbsp; Mind you, Emily did not want to sleep
upstairs in our sons' room because she was scared, the here she is late
at night heading up there!&nbsp; So Susan is wondering, Where is she
going?&nbsp; <br>
When Susan reached the living and looked at her daughter, at the bottom
of the stairs, she realized it was not her daughter at all, but a blond
woman of about 25.&nbsp; My niece is 11 at time, long black hair!&nbsp;
My sister-in-law ran to my room where both her husband and daughter
were sound asleep.&nbsp; Susan was convinced that someone "alive" had
broken into the house because the woman she saw was no apparition - she
looked like flesh and blood.&nbsp; She made Jake check every room,
closet and all through the basement, to make sure they were in fact
alone.&nbsp; They checked to make sure all doors/windows were locked
and they were.<br>
Well, they went through the whole house and found nothing.&nbsp; My
sister in law was starting to believe (at her husband's suggestion)
that she had started dosing and dreamed this, so she went back to her
movie in the family room and Jake went back to bed.&nbsp; She again saw
the exact same thing!&nbsp; The woman coming out of my bedroom and
heading to the stairs.&nbsp; While I am fairly certain I have never had
a paranormal encounter, I have experienced something I have in common
with many of the stories I have read in your site.&nbsp; I have had
dreams where I just know there is something not right at all, or there
is a presence, and I try like crazy to wake up and cannot, and when I
finally do, I look around as if expecting to see someone.&nbsp; Once as
I was desperately trying to wake up from one of these dreams, precisely
in that moment of being awake, I swore there was someone standing in my
door way - didn't see it, but sensed it and heard like when someone
stands for a while and shuffles their feet.&nbsp; It was so weird and
when I woke, my heart was pounding so hard and fast!!.&nbsp; Other
times, I cannot sleep in my own bedroom and have gone to sleep in&nbsp;
my son's room, where I always sleep soundly.&nbsp; During these times,
I wake up scared out of my mind, not wanting to move, or even breath
and trust me, I don't!&nbsp; Often, I pray and while praying, I fall
asleep again.&nbsp; <br>
So, you tell me what you think, I would really like to hear!&nbsp; I
also would love to know if there is a way I can contact this spirit in
a "safe" manner - I don't want to make contact with anything
malevolent.&nbsp; I am terrified to use a Ouija board because of the
many experiences I read about in your site.&nbsp; I am truly a "chicken
* * * *!"&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, for my son's sake too, I want hime to
feel safe and secure.<br>
Our home is a beautifully restored little cape cod, it's 70 years
old.&nbsp; We feel so at peace in the house and once home rarely want
to leave!&nbsp; Many people are amazed with how beautiful the little
house is and the lot it sits on is very pretty too!&nbsp; I can't
imagine that we've been living a house that has a spirit and have not
sensed it.&nbsp; <br>
I would truly appreciate your comments and if you post this story, anyone else's.<br>

Hitcher in the Desert<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
Now, this is another weird experience I had with the supernatural. This
story takes place about a year after the other story I've written
('I've come for my daughter'). I was transferred to another State
(Northern Queensland) to work as a country cop in a small country rural
town where the only crime that happens when someone steals a cow or
gets drunk and try and ride a cow through town (I saw this on my first
night and thought I was in the Wild West). Anyway, my patrol took me to
isolated Aboriginal Communities and I would have a check up on the
local Aborigines (nice people, too, I should add). <br>
I just finished 'visiting' one of the communities and was on the way
back to town (a 120km drive). I had another constable who I'll call
Sally. She was born and bred in the North End of Australia and knew the
area really well, and knew most of the Aboriginal Elders who held her
in high respect. We driving along the road as it was getting dark.
Pretty, I have to say, with the night sky turning purple with the
sprinkles of stars thrown in. Sally and I were chatting away when out
of the darkness we saw a man walking along the road. He had no bags
just wearing a tee shirt, jeans and desert boots. I slowed down and
Sally wound the window down. The man kept walking, actually he kept
pace with the patrol car, which I thought was pretty bloody good. Sally
asked the man if he wanted a ride but the man said nothing. We got
closer to him and Sally had a good look at his face and gasped. <br>
"Just drive on," she said as she quickly wound the window up. I did
what I was told but I asked her for an explanation. That man, she said,
was an old local from way back. She recognised him. The thing was, she
told me, that that man has been dead for two years now. They never did
find his body. Now, here he was walking the road trying to get home. We
weren't the only ones who spotted him. A trucker came in a few days ago
and told me that he picked the guy up but within a minute his cab was
empty. <br>
Poor bugger, no one knows where his body is but he's trying to get home to his family.<br>

Haunting in Windsor<br>
<br>
<br>
By: cind13johnson@adelphia.net<br>
<br>
I want to start by saying I really have never believed in ghost, until
my daughter and I moved into an apartment building on Cherry Street.
Our apartment number was 13(my lucky number).Things were good to start
the only thing strange was while sitting in the living room a black
shadow kept crossing in the door way. I put it up to cars going by .The
living room was at the front of the house.<br>
Soon my daughter kept telling me she heard a voice saying Mommy in her
ear. I chalked that up to being scared and alone and her imagination
going crazy.<br>
Shortly after that my daughter was telling me how the water in the
bathroom kept coming on after she had shut it off and walked into the
kitchen.She also said when ever she took a shower water would pour out
of the vent which was directly above the shower unit.I still figured ok
it is a plumping problem. So I called the land lord and told him. He
came and brought plummers to fix the problem they ripped the ceiling
apart checked the upstairs apartment's toilet and tub but could not
find anything but could see were water had been running.It was ok for a
while and then water actually started coming down the bathroom wall. I
called him again when he came 2 weeks later he could see the stains on
the wall apologized and started again checking all the piping ripping
the ceiling apart........nothing They repainted the wall and ceiling.
It didnt stop. But being an old home I thought well maybe the roof is
leaking coming down that way something there had to be a reason and my
daughter when alone was the only one experincing anything . IMAGINATION<br>
Then one night my daughter stayed at a friends I was home alone. I
don't drink or do drugs. I went to bed my normal time. I awoke to a
very very bright light coming in my window. And I couldn't move. I
heard the bed springs popping ...I started to feel the bed springs
popping down by my feet..I got up yelled knock it off looked under the
bed nothing was there. I got back into bed almost asleep I heard the
sounds again only this time I couldn't speek I couldn't move I was on
my back arms crossed across my chest and started to be lifted into the
air. I figured ok I am dreaming. Something white in front of my face I
struggled to move one of my arms and finally got one arm free enough to
touch the white in front of me, it was the ceiling, as soon as I
touched the ceiling I dropped like a ton of bricks back on to the bed.
This happened two more times until I finally could move and jumped out
of my bed and ran for the bathroom splashed water on my face and just
couldn't believe what just happened.<br>
We moved out shortly after that never spoke about it only to each other
until one day 2 of my neices dropped by and told us how glad they were
that we moved out because that place gave them the creeps. They said
when ever they visited and got ready to leave it was like they were
being chased out the door. They actually thought maybe it was me
running after them because they forgot something or to tell them
something but I was never there. Other family members felt the same.<br>
My daughter and I also felt this when ever we left . It was like we were being chased.<br>
I do now believe in Ghost. And will do some research into this home.<br>

Haunted House Almost Twenty Years Ago<br>
<br>
By: SwampRat@cfl.rr.com<br>
<br>
My wife and I purchased an old Mediterranean style house in Cocoa, Fl
in 1980. It was built in 1925 by Dave Davis&#8217; Construction Company,
before Mr. Davis&#8217; strange disappearance on a ship bound for Paris in
1926. His body was never recovered and there is some controversy that
he may have gone overboard and took his life because of the large
amount of money he was financed by the banks that he could not repay
with only $30,000 coming in for that year.<br>
Shortly after we purchased this old house we started to notice some
strange occurrences, especially in the upstairs portion. Lights being
turned on and doors slamming hard that could not be explained as no one
was up there.<br>
My wife had a friend that knew a Medium and she was asked to come to
see if she could sense the presence of a spirit. As soon as she entered
the upstairs bedroom she fell into a trance like state and scaring the
kids half to death. She said that she felt a strong presence of a
spirit occupying the bedroom closet. I was skeptical and passed it off
as not being much a believer, but the lights still came on and the door
slamming continued at all hours.<br>
A few years later I was doing some remodeling and tiling the kitchen
floor with my back to the stair case when I heard what I thought was
one of the kids running down the stairs. I called, but no answer. As
soon as I set the piece of tile I turned around and there on the living
room floor at the bottom of the stairs was an opened Bible that had
tumbled down from a bookcase that was at the head of the stairs.<br>
I did not read the passage that it opened to, but I have wondered many
times of all the forty plus books that were in that book case why was
it the Bible that came tumbling all the way down and lay opened on the
living room floor. <br>
This happened almost twenty years ago and many have told me I should
have read those pages the Bible open to. At the time I did think about
it, but closed it and placed it back in the book case.<br>
