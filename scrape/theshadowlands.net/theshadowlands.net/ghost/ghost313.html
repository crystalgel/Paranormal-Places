<br><b>i would often see an old man sitting in a chair on the porch when
it was</b>
<br><b>quite cold out ( January / February). too cold to be relaxing outside.</b>
<br><b>one night i passed the house - saw the image and walked quickly

<br><b>Haunting in Lindenworld</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: eglii@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My family use to live in a haunted house&nbsp; well one day I was
vacuming and my girls little at the time were playing.Well out of the corner
of my eye I thought I saw my daughter run and jump into the laundry pile
in the kitchen. So I turned off the vacume and walked over saying what
are you doing boo boo and she wasn't there.I really didn't think anything
of it but knew I had seen something. Well as time went by I started hearing
the door knobs shake thinking that my children were in the room trying
to get out I would open the door and no one would be in there. Some days
it would pull on the back at my shirt at the bottom 2 little tugs almost
like a child that is trying to get your attention I would always turn around
and no one there. Well we came to the conclution lthat it was a child.
and because of the day i saw her jump into the laundry with her little
white dress on that it was a child looking for attention.She was just like
part of the family. Even when we moved we asked her to come with us because
my girls were concerned about what would happen to her.I don't think she
came. But we still have had weird things happen in our california home.But
all not as fun filled as our little girl. She never frightened us we acctually
loved having her for the short time that we experienced her.</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;My Strange Happenings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Mothercorky@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My dad started to get bad with Alzheimer's Disease in the mid 1990's.&nbsp;
There came the day we had to place him in a nursing home.&nbsp; He had
many collecting hobbies and made clocks from kits.&nbsp; He had three clocks
- one for each of us.&nbsp; My older sister chose the regulator clock and
my younger sister took the mantle clock.&nbsp; I got the grandfather clock.&nbsp;
We had never been able to get the thing to run after moving it from my
dads old house to ours.&nbsp; My dad passed away on January 13, 2001 which
was a saturday night.&nbsp; We made arrangements on sunday.&nbsp; Two of
my three children live out of state and flew in for the funeral.&nbsp;
The day after the funeral my oldest flew back home.&nbsp; Later that night
my husband needed a nap and my youngest was down in his room.&nbsp; My
daughter went to her room to change clothes.&nbsp; Her fiance was standing
by the grandfather clock admiring and asking questions.&nbsp; I explained
how&nbsp; my dad bought the kit and had the clock in his living room but
we hadn't been able to keep the thing ticking.&nbsp; I no sooner said that
and the pendulum started going and the clock was keeping time.&nbsp; Her
fiance stood and pointed at the clock and was almost in a panic!&nbsp;
I got up and said that my daddy must want us to set it so I set the time
on it.&nbsp; When my daughter came out from getting changed she asked if
someone had tried to get into the room because the doorknob was moving.&nbsp;
Our house has become a stopping place for wandering spirits.&nbsp; I am
involved in researching my family history.&nbsp; But I'm finding as I go
that I seem to keep that spirit with me.&nbsp; I have taken pictures in
different rooms of my home and there are orbs in them.&nbsp; I was asked
to put them up and zoom in on them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the orbs you can
distinguish a face.&nbsp; One is that of an old man who appears to look
like my 3rd great grandfather.&nbsp; I was fortunate enough to have a copy
of his family portrait hanging on my wall.&nbsp; I don't know why they're
all here except that I am to help them do something.&nbsp; I don't sense
them or feel the coldness like some do.&nbsp; But when my dog is laying
down sleeping and suddenly jerks her head up and stares - I know that "someone"
is close to her!</b>

<br><b>Scotland Encounters</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kaz@kraig.fsnet.co.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>Maybole Castle located in Ayrshire, Scotland was built many hundreds
of years ago and is reputed to have its share of ghosts. Ther have been
many sightings over the years - one of which may be the young Lady Jane
who had been imprisioned in the turret for falling in love with a gypsy.
I recently had been invited to participated in a sponsered ghost watch
at the castle but chickened out at the last minute due to a recent visit
by a ghost expert who reported the presence of at least three ghosts -
one of which was a crying child who had been tortured and tied in the basement.
There is regular paramormal activity reported as the Castle is still being
used as offices. Anyway, I'm sort of two minds about losing my nerve as
the ghost watch had proved eventful - crying had been heard from the basement.
When the team left at 4am they made sure all lights had been turned off
- but in the carpark the looked back and all lights had been turned back
on. When the cleaner came in the morning the energy conscious ghost had
turned them off again!</b>
<br><b>Off course, such paranormal happings are not rare in Scotland -
I can quote hundreds from friends and family. These are just a few.</b>
<br><b>My sister &amp; husband walked into a bookshop housed in a very
old building where the books shot straight off the shelf one after the
other.</b>
<br><b>My youngest sister lived for years in a haunted house - possibily
the spirit of a young child. There were occasional temper tantrums.</b>
<br><b>This is a tragic but true tale. My youngest sister &amp; her then
boyfriend George had friends over for the evening. Off course the talk
turned to ghost stories in general, when suddenly the door of the sitting
room flew open with such force it crashed against the arm of the sofa and
slammed shut again. George jumped up and pulled open the door but no-one
was there. Everyone was shaken by the violence of the event. Later it was
learned that at that precise moment in time, Georges cousin and his friend
had drowned in the River Irvine after a night of drinking &amp; high jinks
that went badly wrong. I remember reading about the drowning of these young
men in the local paper at the time but did not learn of the connection
to my sisters boyfriend until later.</b>
<br><b>A friend heard a voice via the baby moniter which urged to the baby
"Come..come..". It was hard to distinguished from the low gutteral toned
whether it was male or female. When they went to investigated no-one was
there in the room besides the baby.</b>
<br><b>My brother as a young teenager witnessed the speaker of his music
stereo levitating in the air for a few seconds before being placed back
on the floor.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Shadowman in the Hallway</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mstgirl1987@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, my name is Andrea. I got on to your website and decided to tell
you about one of my ghost experiences. Well, I was around nine years old
and I was sitting on my sisters new bunk beds. My little sister was getting
something from the kitchen when it happened. It was a stormy night in our
town. So, I was sitting on the bed when I see a tall shadow of a man pass
by. None of the lights were on behind me in the window. But the shadow
man passed and I thought it was my father walking in front of the door..
I jumped off the bed and followed the shadow. But it had faded into the
air.</b>

<br><b>Started in 1988</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cosmicfreak2003@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in Arlington, Washington. When I moved into my house the forks
started bending . Now when I am there by myself I can hear people walking
upstairs. When I am upstairs trying to sleep I can hear people or things
running up and down the stairs.If I get up and look down the stairs I can't
see anything, but I can still hear it. Soon after we moved into this house
our pets started dissapearing. One of our cats came back, covered in what
looked like blood. He was gone about an hour after he came back.All of
our pets were inside pets. My aunt saw a little girl in my yard and in
the house with blond hair. Nobody I live with or live near has blond hair.
When my mom lived with me she saw her, too. My sister loved to listen to
her stereo, but then the stations started changing by themselves. We could
actually watch the bar move back and forth across it. Recently my dad's
stereo started doing that, too. I go an I-Zone sticky film camera for my
birthday one year. I took a picture and there was an orb in the corner
of it. When I am home alone it can be totally silent, i'll be reading a
book and my dog will start barking. I can get her to calm down, but as
soon as I sit down again, she starts barking again. My cousin and I both
get really big chills right before we hear any of the noises upstairs.
We look our attic doors, but every morning the look is unlocked, and sometimes
on the ground. Sometimes at night I can even hear faint talking. I had
a friend sta with me once and she tried to get up out of bed, but she said
she felt something heavy on her. There was nothing that I could see on
her. My dad went into the kitchen in the middle of the night to get a glass
of water and the freezer was wide open. This all started in 1988. My aunt
even had someone come and bless the house. I guess it didn't work because
it still is happening.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Strange Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: honeyimhome@verizon.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Now for my own story. This is about a house in Brooksville, Fl..
It originally belonged to one of the founding families of the area. I ran
into the resident ghost when I went to work for the then current owner.
This was in the early "80's At that time the place was being used as a
bridal shop and a catering business. With the owners residence in the other
half of the house. The owner had had a number of strange happenings before
I started to work there.. But I will only relate what happened to me and
My family.&nbsp; The first time we were house sitting while the owners
were on vacation, and I was running the shop for them. Late one night,
my boys were sleeping in the motor home that the owners used in the business
from time to time.&nbsp; My youngest daughter was in the living room watching
TV taking advantage of the movie channels that we did not have at home..
She was watching some version of Friday the 13th on one of the movie channels.
she got up in the middle of the movie to use the restroom and when she
got back to the movie, the channel had been changed and there was a commercial
on. at that point she came running into the bedroom we were sleeping in,
climbed into the middle and said Mom this house is haunted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
. Someone changed the station I was watching. My husband and I never left
the bed and no one else was in the house. Another time we had been house
sitting and were leaving on Sunday to go home because my kids had school
the next day and another employee was coming to stay that night.. There
are 6 outside doors on the house. My husband and I went through the house
together and locked all the doors. and rechecked them to make sure that
they were all locked. An hour later the other employee came to stay and
found every door in the house unlocked. He brought his younger brother
with him the little boy walked into the house&nbsp; and settled down until
after dark and&nbsp; then something scared him so badly his older brother
had to take him home because he was so frightened by the feelings in the
house.&nbsp; Local stories had the original owners wife dying in very mysterious
circumstances. Supposedly shooting herself in the right temple. except
for the fact that she was left handed. (murder was never solved) There
were other happenings after we moved into the house for a year to sell
out the bridal shop and keep the house occupied until the sale.&nbsp; Perhaps
some other time I can relate more stories</b>

<br><b>The House with the Painting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: twinsis2tomcat22@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Trisha and I am writing about one out of the many few
ghost experiences I have had in my life. I am fortunate to have found this
site to talk to many of those who have experienced with the supernatural.
I moved to Bemus Point, New York from Woodbridge, Virginia on May 1, 2004
into a house which as to this date, I still call that house my dream house
because all my life I always wanted to live in a home so big and so beautiful.
The house had 5 bedrooms, one bath, a basement, and a beautiful yard. I
want to explain why I have chosen to talk about this particular experience
in this home in Bemus Point, NY. Of course I wasn't the only person living
in a 5 bedroom home. It was me, my fiance, and my 4 year old son. My fiance's
brother and father were going to live there with us, however that didn't
work out. So it was just the three of us, for a while. Before we all had
actually moved into the house, my fiance and my father went to the house
to drop off some belongings of ours and my fiance had videotaped every
room of the house. The home was just exraordinary to us, like something
we never seen before. As of this date, we still hold in possession the
tape which had been recorded of that home. One of the bedrooms had been
painted with art work from a very artistic person. That art work is believed
to have been finger painted, and very unusual. At the time I had looked
at the house before we all had moved in, I went to that room with the painting
many times. I knelt down on my knees in front of the painting and touched
it with my hands to get a feel of its characterization. I will say to this
date that the painting that was on the wall at that very moment changed
once we had moved into the home. First, it was a painting of a turkey,
very unusual. There were many things in this house that were strange. Onl
we didnt catch the unusual things about them until we had moved in. To
this date, I only hope to find who had lived there before we had and I
will in time find my answers.</b>
<br><b>Now you will know the beginning of this unusual experience. It started
with that painting. After we had moved into the house, we began to refresh
our minds a little bit of what we thought was strange. I was in the process
of unpacking and settling into our new home. I went back to that room with
the painting and was in shock from what I seen. That painting was a woman
and there was writing above the painting of that woman which said, "Earth
+ Hater..........Everything". The painting of the woman was on the wall,
right on an outlet cover where a television had been sitting. I will explain
to you what description I seen in that painting. It was a woman, whose
face was intensely beaten with blood flowing from her hair down through
her face and then to her arms. Her hair was hung up as if she had been
in an electric shock. Her face was bruised badly and cut up with scars
on the side of her face. Her eyes were open and the smile on her face was
extremely intense, as if she was angry. I looked around the room more thoroughly
and there on the other side the wall were more paintings. One was of a
butterfly and a mushroom was the other. On the closet door was a poem written
by the famous poet, Keats. I believe to this date, the same person who
had written the poem on the door had to have been the same person who did
the painting on the wall. I looked around the room closer and came upon
some blood on the floor on one side of the room. It was not fresh blood,
because it looked like it had dried up and had been there for a long while.
I closed the door behind me and left the room. I didn't go back to the
room until later on through the next week. One of the rooms upstairs was
right next to that room where we had turned into an office. Across the
office was the bathroom. On the other side was another room we used for
our bedroom. Of cour , there was an attic, located right across from the
room with the painting. On the door that leads to the attic is a sign that
says, "Private". I always wondered who slept up there in that attic. In
the attic there were beds, two of them. The beds were built into the floor
and the walls. Underneath the boards of the beds were pipes. I won't say
what kind of pipes because I do not know. My only guess, they are water
pipes. The attic was made to be one of the 5 bedrooms in the entire house.
This room however, was among the most strangest thing I have ever seen,
in exeption with the room with the painting. In this room of the attic
were cross spaces large enough to fit almost 10 or more bodies depending
on size. In one of the cross spaces was another painting. This painting
was put together with boards. It was hand made and the colors of the painting
were the exact same colors used in the painting of the other room. It seemed
to be a painting of the devil, however it was never confirmed of what the
painting really was. There was a sofa left in the room with strands of
brown hair, which seemed to be the color of my own hair and I never even
sat on the couch when we found it there,&nbsp; let alone had it belonged
to me. Along with the sofa, there had been a brown recliner chair sitting
next to the sofa. Underneath the recliner there had been a huge blood stain,
in turn could have passed to be a huge stain of grease.&nbsp; This attice
could have been turned into atleast 2 more rooms by the size of the cross
spaces, and that's an example of how big they were. When I left the room
of the attic to go back downstairs, I noticed as I walked down the stairs
had there been names engraved into the carpet of each step as I walked
down. I could not make of the names, but it was in deed visible to the
eye. It was very strange to me. I wanted to find out some information about
the house because I began to get nervous and anxious of the situation.
I turned to our next door neighbor for information and hope to find out
all I could. On one side of the house was cut off by a wall where the next
door neighbor had lived. It was in deed unfortunate to us because that
wall that separated us from the neighbor had not been closed off to him,
as he had all entrances into our part of the house. No door on our side
had locks to keep him from coming through on our side of the house. This
made me very nervous, especially throughout the night. With an exact total
of 4 rooms upstairs and the bathroom, and only one bedroom downstairs.
We had turned that room on the bottom level downstairs into my son's room.
It was not safe enough to put my son upstairs due to the stairwell and
the fact that I was afraid he would get hurt. Therefore, the only room
downstairs we had used for his room. Just outside of my son's bedroom was
the basement door, and another door that lead to the next door neighbor's
bathroom. We were told the door that lead to the neighbor's bathroom had
not been used because the bathroom toilet was broken. To this date, I don't
believe that theory which had been said to us. I noticed on the side where
my son's bedroom was, each door had locks on them at the top, which made
me nervous because I was concerned that someone could get locked in and
would not be able to get out. However, the only door without a lock was
the bathroom door to the neighbor's side of his house. That seemed a bit
unusual to me, as if it was purposely set up that way so that the next
door neighbor could have entrance into our side of the house whenever he
wanted to come on our side. Another entrance that the next door neighbor
had to our side of the house was in the kitchen right where the pantry
closet is. In the process of unpacking I had sat some pictures against
the door until I got around to hang them up. Other entrances the neighbor
had to our side of the house were upstairs and in the basement. There was
a storage space located right between the office and the bathroom which
had two doors inside the storage space that the next door neig or could
use to come on our side of the house. On our side of the storage space
were locks, therefore we were fortunate for the matter. The doors to the
storage space were made of glass, therefore it would have to take someone
to break the glass or professionally remove the glass in order to enter
on our side. As far as the basement, the neighbor would have to break the
chain on our side to come up the stairs on our side. Anyway, after having
suspicions of what might have happened in this house or what could have
happened, I had to talk to someone and find out something. That's when
I started questioning the next door neighbor.</b>
<br><b>One day I ran into our neighbor outside, not literally and asked
him about the painting that was on the wall. I asked him if he had known
of the tennants who used to live in the house before us, and possibly all
he could tell me about the painting and who stayed in the room where the
painting was. The neighbor claims that a girl by the name Anna stayed in
that room at one time and told me that she was the one who did the painting.
At that very moment, I felt there was more he had known and more that I
needed to know. With having a few supernatural experiences previously,
the feeling that something would lead me to some kind of answer clinged
me to ask him more about what he could tell me. He told me that Anna was
about the same age as me, and knew that she had been invloved in many serious
circumstances with others dealing with gothic rituals, practicing witchcraft,
and had camped out with others in the back of the house at a camp site
where most of their rituals were performed. He offered to take me to the
camp site one day, although I never was able to get around to it. Thereafter,
I insisted on letting him take a look at the painting himself as well as
the poem from Keats that was written on the door in the room. We also went
to the attic to look at the stain that was on the floor. He could not agree
with me that it looked anything like a blood stain. I howed him the names
engraved in the carpet on the stairs to the attic. He could not make a
vision of what I had been seeing, therefore he wasnt able to discuss that
matter with me. As far as the blood in the room on the floor of the room
with the painting, he did in fact agree with me that it appeared to be
blood stains. However, he could not give me any explanation of why or how
it gotten there. The neighbor explained that he rarely ever payed any attention
to anything in the house and hadn't been in the house but a few times to
do some work to it. I did not agree with that theory at all. I knew there
had to be alot of information missing that he wouldnt tell me then. The
neighbor insisted on finding someone to come look at the painting. I told
him that it would be a good idea for someone to come out to take a look
at everything I had seen, and to examine the house in case their was to
be any signs of a supernatural crisis. When the neighbor left, I assumed
that what he intended to do was not going to happen only because I felt
he knew more that he wasnt telling me at that time. I left the matter alone
long enough for me to stumbble across anything else that seemed unusual
to me. The day after, my fiance and I along with our son left the house
to take care of some business and when we had returned to the house that
evening, we saw the neighbor coming out of our house with a cooking pot.
It was quite unusual to us knowing that the house had been locked up and
could not understand how he had gotten into the house without having a
key. My fiance and I got out of the car and the neighbor walked over to
us, explaining that he had went into the house. He told us that we had
made him quite nervous about the discussion with the painting as well as
everything else we talked about, therefore he decided to speak with his
cousin on how to bless the house. The neighbor explained that he blessed
the entire house using some ancient herbs that were give to him and told
us that he was trying to help us out because he felt that it would resolve
the situation. After his explanation, he continously explained that he
would not go back in the house without us knowing about it first. We let
this incident alone being as it was a first time affense and he said he
was trying to help. When we walked in the house after speaking with him,
we could smell the scent of the herbs he used all through the house. It
was a very strong and painful scent, almost as if it was the smell of marjiuana.
The smell was in a long stretch throughout the house, I was more concerned
for my son. We had to leave the house for a few hours more in order to
escape the smell and painful irritation of our eyes. Finally, once we returned
to the house the smell settled and we could breathe again. I wasn't actually
pleased for the matter that he had came into the house uninvited and blessed
the house with no knowledge of what he was doing. Still, I left the matter
alone believing that he would not do it again. In order to concentrate
on other things, I used my time trying to unpack my things and cleaning
from one room to the next. It wasnt til the next few days later, I had
an incident of my own.</b>
<br><b>It was in the middle of the night, we were all asleep and I was
awaken by a man whom layed there on top of me with all his weight pushing
on me so tight that I could not breathe. I thought I had been having a
nightmare, although my eyes were open and the force I had been using to
fight and pull to escape this man's weight and the fear he had been pouring
over me, was only a nightmare in my life, in reality. I looked beside me
as I layed there fighting to escape the fear amongst this man's desire
to rape me, trying to wake my fiance from his sleep to save me. My fiance
layed there in deep sleep as if he could not hear a peep from my crying
screams of what I had left to breathe. I had been raped that very night,
laying there in my own ed with my fiance laying right next to me. With
one horotic scream, I used all my weight to escape this man's arms and
pushed him off of me. Frightening, all I could see was his brown hair,
and his back that turned to my face as he walked away with not even two
seconds, and disappeared. I sat up in my bed next to my fiance, waiting
there holding my body, hoping he would awake and&nbsp; hold me. I could
not make sense of this, not then and not now. Even after, I knew it wasn't
over. I could not call the police because I wouldnt have been able to explain
to them of this such incident. Even so, they wouldn't be able to believe
me. Amongst all things, they would turn it on my fiance and I will not
take that route. Not then, and not now. After my fiance had awaken, I told
him about what happened. He just held me tight and worried. After a while,
I was too angry to sit there and do nothing. I was determined to get my
answers. Even one, Why Me? I know I am not the only person in the entire
world who has had this exact same incident. There are others. I know because
I have read about them. I know there are others out there whom have been
beaten and raped in incidences like this. I have now moved out of that
house and live only 10 minutes away from there. I have not been back since
we moved. There are others I am aware of who live in that same house right
now as I am telling you this. Four of them I am aware of are girls. I fear
for them. I worry for them. Even though this isnt the only incident that
happened to me in that same house they live in as I speak, as there have
been many incidents not so much severe to this one, I worry for anyone
who lives there. This will come back to me one day. In some form, some
way, it will find me. And I will find my answers. I have had the experience
of the supernatural ever since I was a young child around the age of 7
years old. It has followed me. I am 22 years old now. This house I lived
in at Bemus Point, New York was said to be over 100 years old. The supernatural
exper nces I have had are real. It may be of some kind of gift that I have
been given, but it's frightening at the same time. I only seek to understand
it. Even so, it's frightening to know the answers I am looking for. I can
only do what I can to accept this the best way I find is reasonable. I
will tell you that the man who raped me that night, is no way in comparison
to any person I have ever met or come across my entire life. This will
be one of many experiences I will never forget. I know there are others
out there who wonder just the same as I do, Why Me? Is there really ever
an answer to that question? And if you ever wonder what ever happened to
the painting or the hand made art work that was found in those rooms, I
wont be able to explain that to you. All I can tell you is that the neighbor
that lived right next door to me went into the house without telling us,
carved that painting off the wall literally, and told me that he burned
it. As far as the hand made art work made of boards, I won't ever know.
The neighbor took that too. To this date, that painting exists as well
as the hand made art work made of boards. Everything in this house exists
to me. And as far as the girl that I was told did the painting on the wall,
Anna. What does she know? Where is she today? My last question is in regards
to the landlord, John. Do you always allow your son to go into the house
whenever he wants to, especially when other tennants are renting the house
from you? Trust me, one day it could end up being a big mistake for him.
My guess is, is there something to hide?????</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Older Woman</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: francisc.galicia@sbcglobal.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello! my name is eric and I have a couple of occurences that are
rather interesting, nothing amazing but defenately weird. I've always been
interested by dark things, I like to dress in black and I like to listen
to extreme metal and such things like that so I've always kept an open
mind on such things. Well anyways when I was about 8 years old&nbsp; me
and some of my brothers slept in the floor of the living room for about
a couple of years, well one night I awoke for no real reason I guess, I
was still tired so I didnt want to get up or open my eyes. when I felt
something unexplainable, it was the feeling that someone was neer me that
wanted to hurt me, I cant explain it I just felt that. well being curios
I opened my eyes and I saw an older woman crouching down next to me and
her face was right in front of mine as if looking right at me. I closed
my eyes again in sheer terror,&nbsp; but i was still curios to see if it
was still there so I looked and the womans face was still there, I didnt
actually see her body I just assumed she had a body or something. I closed
and opened my eyes several times and she was still there I was more scared
than hell. but somehow I went back to sleep. It never happened again and
I never told anybody because I thought it could have been my imagination,
but I know what I felt, and I'll never forget that terrible feeling that
I got. another interesting experience was a und the same year a few months
later. I woke up for no real reason, when I opened my eyes I saw an older
looking woman standing on the base of my brothers feet that slept next
to me. I didnt close my eyes because I wanted to see if it was real, at
one moment I felt that same threatening feeling but not for myself, but
I actually feared the wellbeing of my brother, i went to sleep again and
it never happened again either, I never told anybody for the same reason
as last time because i'm skeptical but still with an open so it could have
either been a real apparition or just my stupid imagination, I guess I'll
never know.</b><b></b>

<p><b>True Experiences in Ohio</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: routtyone@earthlink.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have been looking at your website for the last couple of weeks
and have read some of the experiences people have had with the supernatural.
I have had several experiences in my life.</b>
<br><b>The first one that I can really remember is when my grandmother
died. I was 16 yrs old and lived most of my life with my grandma. The night
she passed away from cancer, I was devastated since I never got to say
goodbye to her. But the night she passed she came back to say goodbye to
me. I remember being in that state between awake and asleep, I remember
her coming to my bed, sitting beside me and telling me she was perfectly
fine and so happy to be with my grandpa. I told her I loved her and she
left.</b>
<br><b>The second thing that happened was about 2 months after I had my
3rd child. We moved into a beautiful home in NW Ohio. It had been totally
remodeled except for one room upstairs in which we made into a toy room
for the kids. My daughter who was 2 at the time was in that room playing
when she started screaming for me. I ran up the stairs to see what was
wrong with her and she was in a corner with her hands protecting her head
and screaming for the "bad" man to go away. I did NOT see a man! I picked
her up and headed back downstairs and when I was on the 3rd or 4th step
down I felt as if someone was behind me and very very angry with me. Needless
to say I ran the rest of the way down.</b>
<br><b>Also in that house I was in the kitchen washing my sons bottles
and directly behind the sink was our stove, I had placed my son in his
carrier by the stove. My daughters had brought in their stuffed animals
that my mother had gotten them for Easter and layed them down beside the
stove. Now these stuffed animals were the kind that make noise, as in the
Duck Quacked, the Pig Oinked and the Cow Moo'd. I know my son was just
a little too young to be able to reach over his carrier and play with the
toys let alone make them "talk". While I was washing his bottles the Duck
started in...I thought nothing of it...I thought maybe it was just malfunctioning
but then the cow started in and a few seconds after that the pig...I turned
around and my son was just all smiles. Needless to say I hightailed it
out of the house.</b>
<br><b>I always hated to go into the basement of that house. It just felt
wrong for me to be down there. But one afternoon I had no choice but to
go down. I had to take a bag of old clothing down to be stored. I thought
I would just leave them on the floor right at the bottom of the steps.
So I leaned down to re-tie the bag and as I looked up I saw 2 little girls
standing in front of me. They were NOT my little girls! They looked to
be about 7 and 5 yrs old. And let me tell you I didnt waste anytime getting
up those stairs! They did not make me feel very safe.</b>
<br><b>I did research on the house and found that the house was built in
the mid 1800's. A man and his family lived in the house and he had 2 daughters.
The man owed some money to a loan shark and when he couldnt repay his debt,
the loan shark killed the&nbsp; 2 daughters and buried them in the basement!
My family and I didn't stay long in that house. The longer we stayed the
more "evil" it seemed to be.</b>
<br><b>The most recent experience has been happening for the last 2 1/2
yrs. My father passed away and I have had a very hard time dealing with
his passing. I was made to make all of the decisions when it came to taking
him off of life support. I felt and still feel guilty for letting him go.
I know that my dad comes to visit me and I hope he never stops visiting.
I don't let anyone smoke in my home and my dad hated it! He hated to go
outside in the garage, he was always on my case about it. Well, now that
dad has passed away there are many nights and even days that you can smell
cigarette smoke so plainly, like its right next to you. I know its my dad
and I tell him to take it to the garage. And he does. I know that he is
looking out for me and my family. I just wish he would show himself to
me just one time.</b>
<br><b>Thank you so much for your website, it is a comfort knowing that
I am not alone and definately not crazy!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Upland CA Haunting Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: socontroversial@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>this story involves my aunt and uncle and took place in the late
70's and early 80's. my aunt and uncle and (then) baby cousin lived in
a nice, modest house in upland, california, a very nice little city near
pomona and ontario. the "nice"ness of the house didn't last long... almost
immediately my family began experiencing weird things.</b>
<br><b>every night on the way to bed, my uncle would latch closed the door
to the spare bedroom across the hall from he and my aunt's master bedroom.
every morning as he passed the same door, it would discreetly unlatch and
push open on its own. this same room once locked in my uncle's sister,
with her and my uncle both frantically turning and pushing/pulling on the
door as things flew out of the closet at her. all at once everything stopped
and they both jumped back -- to have the door unlatch and push itself open
as it always did. needless to say, my uncle's sister didn't stay much longer
in the bedroom... let alone the house.</b>
<br><b>when my aunt would leave the house to run errands in the daytime,
she would return to find all the pictures from the wall on the ground --
not knocked over, but propped against the wall, directly under the nail
it was once hanging on. this would happen nearly everytime the house was
left empty, no matter how many times they would put the items back up on
the wall.</b>
<br><b>another nightly struggle was the pounding up and down the walls...
like someone banging their fist across the center of the wall, back and
forth, back and forth... my own grandma (as well as my mom and dad) witnessed
this and hightailed it out of there asap.</b>
<br><b>one day in the summer my cousin, who was about 2 or 3, was sitting
in a high chair next to a long hallway. my aunt was just outside the back
door when my cousin asked "mommy who's that man in the hallway?" my aunt,
not quite listening, asked back somewhat distracted, "what man?" my cousin
proceeded to explain that the man looked like her uncle mike, who lived
out of state...</b>
<br><b>when my family had decided enough was enough, they decided to sell
the house and move to calimesa, just outside of yucaipa, CA. on one of
their last nights in the house, it seemed as if everything was going crazy.
the pounding was out of control, there were loud bangs and unusual noises
everywhere, and their dog was at the front door, its hair on end, and growling
out at the front porch. my aunt and uncle looked outside to the wraparound
driveway and saw their van -- rocking back and forth as if people were
inside jumping around. within seconds everything had stopped.</b>
<br><b>once my family had moved out, they eventually learned that their
house was built over an old indian burial ground. I have tried to ask my
aunt more about this story but she will rarely talk about it and I think
is subconciously trying to block it out. my aunt and uncle are very straight-laced
and don't make up these sorts of things, and I think that if my other family
members had not been there to witness a lot of them, I would not even know
about these occurances in upland. I've had to rely on my mom re-telling
what she remembers my aunt telling her as it was happening. there are probably
many more things that went on that I would love to find out... I still
don't even know the address of the old house, to see if the place still
exists.</b>
<br><b>as for the significance of "uncle mike"...? my cousin's uncle mike
had long, black, flowing hair, with darkly tanned skin, and often wore
a leather head band across his forehead (think 70s rocker fashion). looking
somewhat like an indian perhaps...?</b>

<p><b>I think it was My Grandmother</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: barbara.newbury@tesco.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I would like to share with you one of the nights that i will never
forget.</b>
<br><b>It happened back in the late 80s. It was the night after my Grandma
died. I decided to sleep at her bungalow, all by myself. I slept in her
bed that she died in, the night before. Well it was about 1.00am, i was
woken by a very hard push on the bottom of the bed, so i got up and looked
at the bottom of the bed and i saw a faint outline of my grandma sitting
on the bottom of the bed. I thought i was just imagining things, so i went
back to sleep. About 1 hour later, i was woken again, this time i was woken
by a bright light, i looked where it was coming from, it was coming from
the underneath the door, so i watched it, it came from underneath the door
and floated right on top of me. I was soo scared, it was a big bright light.
So with that i had to get in my car and go home. I never did return to
my Grandma's bungalow.</b>
<br><b>I think my Grandma was trying to get in touch with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;
What do you think???</b>
<br><b>I was very shooken by this experience.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Glory Beach Resort</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rogertkloo@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have seen a ghost apparition at the Glory Beach Resort at Port
Dickson. It happens around 3.00 a.m. when me and 3 of my friends started
talking ghost stories. We were reaching one part of the story and a shadow
suddenly forn up and it zoom by. Although my friends saw the shadow but
they can't see it clearly. Unfortunately for me I saw the shape with my
own eyes and it is in a form of an orb.</b>
<br><b>Later that morning about 4.00 a.m. we decided to take a walk by
the beach and this time I seen the spirit is following us. I was the only
one who can see and feel it. The spirit was in a form of a woman.</b>
<br><b>During the way back to our apartment, the spirit is still following
us and when I ask them whether they can see anything and they said they
cannot see it.</b>
<br><b>In our apartment, Mani one of my friends turning the toilet knob
and we heard something click inside the toilet door and it was unlock.
As you can see the toilet are adjoin to 2 doors. One is always remain lock
and one is open. When the door opened we started to feel a sudden breeze
and we began to pray.</b>

<p><b>Faces in the Mists</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happened quite recently - a few weeks ago.</b>
<br><b>Apart from what I think are a few cases of what I think was more
likely sleep paralysis with resulting hallucinations, this is the only
experience I felt was truly……well, weird.</b>
<br><b>A bit of background first:</b>
<br><b>I live alone and rent an apartment in a newly built block (1 of
3) of low-rise units. These were built on the grounds of an old public
primary school which is over 100+ years old.</b>
<br><b>The far end of the strip of land where the school used to be is
preserved and still has the school hall; a beautiful sandstone building
and is used for public functions.</b>
<br><b>My particular block is built where the playgrounds etc used to be
- I know this as I grew up in the area and remember the school when I was
a teenager (though I did not go there) and remember what it looked like
beforehand. I personally am unaware of any hauntings in the area, nor am
I aware of the history of the site as I have not researched it.</b>
<br><b>There is a fairly modern funeral place directly across the road
containing offices, a small chapel and a large garage with several hearses.</b>
<br><b>Whilst I assume bodies are prepared etc there, there are no burials.</b>
<br><b>The story:</b>
<br><b>I had a very hard day at work, and have been under a lot of stress.
It was a Friday night, fairly late, and I eventually decided to go to bed.</b>
<br><b>I had a lot of trouble sleeping as my mind working at 100kph (you
know the feeling) - I simply couldn't turn off.</b>
<br><b>After staring at the ceiling for an hour I became frustrated and
finally I thought i'd open my mind and try to meditate.</b>
<br><b>It was an effort, but after almost half an hour of this I drifted
off.</b>
<br><b>Shortly after, I had an odd feeling, and I woke up and opened my
eyes. I immediately I noticed a web of white mist above me.</b>
<br><b>This network of yellow-white coloured mist was basically sort of
like a spider web about a metre above my bed and almost stretching across
the entire room.</b>
<br><b>Actually the whole room was a bit foggy in general.</b>
<br><b>I blinked - and then did a "I don't think so" double take and rubbed
my eyes (no sleep paralysis this time) - it was still there.</b>
<br><b>I tried to focus my eyes on it (it was not easy), and I saw what
I thought were transparent faces outlined in the mist, the effect was very
like the outline of an invisible person in smoke.</b>
<br><b>One moved through on my right side and looked directly at me. The
fear started to hit me now, but I tried to calm myself down and think rationally
and thought "just hold on here - I must be seeing things just because I
am so tired and stressed, and I've just waken up too".</b>
<br><b>I forced myself be distracted and take my attention away - I shifted
position in bed, closed my eyes - rubbed them, blinked several times, and
looked over at my</b>
<br><b>clock-radio - it was about 01:10 I think. Then looked back up -
it was still there.</b>
<br><b>I then started to feel a slight vibration in my bed - not a strong
one, just like you'd feel through the ground at a station as a train went
past.</b>
<br><b>I remember thinking "what the..?!" and thought at first it was just
my body shivering because I was cold, or I had a muscle twitch. My attention
on this now I flexed my muscles a few times and then tried to hold still
and feel if it was still there - the bed was definitely vibrating, even
a bit more pronounced now.</b>
<br><b>I was getting quite frightened and not knowing what else to do short
of running out of the bedroom began to recite a prayer softly and also
verbalise that I wanted</b>
<br><b>any spirits to leave this place (basically anything that came to
mind) - just in case I wasn't imagining things!</b>
<br><b>After about a minute of this it faded. After a while I wanted to
go back to sleep as I was super-tired but every minute or so I was worried
it was still there so I snapped my eyes open to check; it had gone.</b>
<br><b>A few minutes after that I fell asleep again with no more events
that night.</b>
<br><b>Now after the event when I think about it I wonder if it was just
my imagination or something else.</b>
<br><b>What surprised and concerned me is that I felt very lucid - I felt
quite clear headed.</b>
<br><b>The only other event which is vaguely similar, which I dismissed
at the time, was a about a year ago when I woke up in the early hours of
the morning to see a similar face above and to the left of my bed (no mist)
looking at me. I rather sheepishly recall in the shock yelling and then
punching it. Honestly…..who punches a ghost!</b>
<br><b>Seemed to work though - the action either jolted me out of my sleep/hallucination,
or made whatever it was go away.</b>
<br><b>I'm not sure what to make of the above event to be honest. As a
general comment in my apartment itself I don't typically feel anything
strange or a presence and other than this there have been no odd goings
on.</b>
<br><b>Plenty of unusual sounds mind you - but i'm fairly sure these come
mostly from the neighbours etc.</b>
<br><b>Usually from what i've read hauntings tend to be more or less repetitive
and don't just hit you like that and go away, so i'm still not 100% convinced
it wasn't a half-dream, but still…..what a freak-out.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Warning from GHost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cmccord1863@netzero.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi I've wriiten here once before and since then my family and I have
had more experiences. It was toward the end of last month and me and my
mom were sitting in our living room watching t.v. and we have this front
room in our house and my dad had just cut the lights out in that room,
and came into the living and sat down to watch t.v with us. well about
a minute or two later the lights in the front room came on by there self
and there was nobody in the room, and then two days ago my mom was asleep
when she woke up and felt someone watching her, but yet there was no one
there. Now this next stuff may be just Coincidental, but I think its a
warning from the ghost because everytime this stuff happens something has
happened to my dad. Because about a week after my mom had seen the dark
shadowy figure standing at the end of her bed and I heard the whisper my
dad had to have surgery on his elbow, and then about a week and a half
after the lights my dad reinjured the same elbow he had surgery on.</b>

<br><b>My "Peeves"</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kristiashworth@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I now believe that I officially have a poltergeist in my home.&nbsp;
At first, my live-in boyfriend thought I was nuts.&nbsp; Now, he believes
it too.&nbsp; The first day I moved in, I was doing laundry in the basement.&nbsp;
My cats both began acting strangely, and circled me wherever I was in the
basement...I thought they were just hungry and trying to get my attention.&nbsp;
But when I walked out to go up stairs, I had this terrible feeling that
someone was standing behind me, staring right through me.&nbsp; The 12year
old inside me told me to run up the stairs like I did when I was a kid,
and I did.&nbsp; Then, one day I was looking for my favorite tank top.&nbsp;
I couldn't find it anywhere, and could swear that I brought it to this
new house.&nbsp; I dismissed it, as having left it somewhere.&nbsp; The
third day we lived in this house, I broke my ankle playing softball.&nbsp;
I ended up having to sleep on the couch in the living room.&nbsp; Throughout
my two month stay on the sofa, I could swear I heard someone going up/down
the basement steps, cold breezes, etc.&nbsp; I just thought that the pain
medications were kicking in, and that my mind was playing tricks on me.&nbsp;
After I could walk again, and venture into the basement to do the laundry,
I still had the same creepy feeling that someone was standing behind me,
staring at me, etc.&nbsp; One night when I was getting ready to fall asleep
in the bedroom (my boyfriend was out of town fishing), I had both dogs
in the room, one on the bed, and the cats too and one dog on the floor
next to the bed.&nbsp; Out of nowhere, I heard a loud thump, like a book
had just fallen off of a bookshelf and onto the hardwood floor. Well, I
don't have any bookshelves in the bedroom, nor was anything on the floor
except for clothes when I turned the light on.&nbsp; Just this last week,
I came home to discover the bed neatly made, pillows stacked just so, and
the blankets pulled up neatly and turned down.&nbsp; When I thanked my
boyfriend for making the bed, he just stared at me.&nbsp; He said, "what
are you talking about?"&nbsp; And I said that I didn't know what got into
him to make the bed so nice, but it was a nice thing to do.&nbsp; He said
he though I came home on my lunch hour and made the bed.&nbsp; He had been
gone all day, and didn't come home until I was already home.&nbsp; The
basement lights continually go on and off, the light switches don't work,
and the light bulbs are new.&nbsp; The circuits have been checked and are
fine.&nbsp; I never know when they will work.&nbsp; The other night, the
toilet handle in the bathroom jiggled for 10 minutes straight, at 3am,
we both heard it.&nbsp; The night before last, my boyfriend witnessed a
light come on in the hallway outside our bedroom, and then heard the light
switch flip.&nbsp; The light faded, and later when he got up to go to the
bathroom, the kitchen light was on, which had been off when we went to
bed. Last night, I saw a light come into our bedroom from the hallway,
and then fade.&nbsp; I also heard another very loud thump at the foot of
the bed.&nbsp; When I got up, only my tennis shoes were in the floor (hardwood
foor) and nothing else had fallen or was out of place.&nbsp; It was so
loud, I physically jumped when I heard it.&nbsp; My boyfriend was sound
asleep.&nbsp; I am convinced that someone or something is totally screwing
with me!</b>

<p><b>Mom's Terrifying History</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Cugini_Larry@emc.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This is a very personal story to my family, but I think your readers
might find it as fascinating as I do...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother grew up in an infamous mental institution
in Massachusetts, now closed, and I won't name the facility for privacy's
sake. She was placed in state custody in 1948, at six years old, because
my grandmother, a&nbsp; Portuguese gypsy immigrant (and closet psychotic),
claimed she was mentally disturbed. In actuality, my grandmother was just
not capable of raising&nbsp; her so she successfully pawned her off on
the state. My mother was not only a beautiful and innocent child, but was
totally mentally capable and 100% sane. In those days, there was no system
in place for accurately assessing a child's mental condition. They simply
took the parents' word for it. After living at various orphanages and state
facilities, she ended up at this institution just outside of Boston. The
place is notorious for paranormal activity, even on the outer grounds where
some of the buildings once stood. She was about twelve when she got there.
She said there were many mentally and physically incapacitated young people
there and the stories she has told us about "the school" (or "the institution")
were both heartbreaking and terrifying. There were mental abuses, deprivations,
beatings, medical experiments on patients, and cruel punishments galore.
So-called 'professional care'&nbsp; was barbaric and even the terminology
was outdated. My mother's own records, which I've seen myself, showed her
mental assessment as "moron," even though she said she was never really
tested by any mental health professional.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she was around 13, she began helping the
other patients whenever she could. She would bandage their injuries, break
up fights, and speak to the matrons on behalf of those who could not speak.
This created enemies among the staff who knew she was not handicapped and
who felt she was a threat to their employment. Therefore, whenever they
could, they punished her severely. One such punishment led to a horrifying
encounter with the supernatural.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One dark, stormy afternoon, Mom had had words
with a matron, trying to tell her that certain handicapped children were
frightened of the thunder and that they should not be forced to go outside
to exercise that afternoon. The matron appeared to give in, then asked
my mother to please go down into the cellar of the building to get the
rain gear for those who wanted to go outside. Mom was terrified of that
cellar, and the matron knew it. There was a long, steep, narrow, rickety
stairway ending at a long, dark hallway with no windows and just a tiny
yellowish light bulb in the ceiling. At the end of the hallway there was
a cabinet that contained raincoats, boots, etc.&nbsp; When my mother hesitantly
stepped onto the stairway, the matron slammed the door, bolted it shut
behind her, and shut off the light. My mother screamed and pounded on the
door for an hour, only to be laughed at by matrons who had been instructed
to let her spend the night down there. The stairs being steep and dangerous,
she decided that she would rather creep to the bottom and at least huddle
on the damp floor. As she descended, she noticed a dim light coming from
the long hallway beneath her. She came to the bottom of the stairs and
looked ahead. She said she saw a man in a dark jumpsuit about twenty feet
from her, leaning against the wall and just smiling at her. She thought
he must be a custodian, so she walked towards him, asking him to please
let her out. But as she approached him, he kept getting further away. She
realized he was not a solid being and that the dim light seemed to be coming
from his outline. The light began to fade, and she found herself screaming
again, only in the total dark of the dingy basement. She was disoriented
and stumbled forward until she bumped into the cabinet which held the rain
gear. As she squinted in the dark, she began to make out shapes forming
on either side of the cabinet. What appeared to be a pair of detached hands,
forming a clawed shape, were each coming from around opposite sides of
the cabinet and heading for her. She turned and ran, faint with terror,
until she tripped on the bottom step. Frozen with fear, she could only
sit on the bottom step and cover her face with her hands. After a minute
or so, she peeked through her fingers down the hallway. The strange dim
light was back. She chanced to look down and what she saw filled her with
horror. One of the smoky floating hands was reaching for her skirt hem
as if to pull at it. She again screamed and ran back up the stairs, tripping
and falling several times in the dark, convinced she was being chased.
The air was cold and she heard a strange rustling sound behind her as she
frantically climbed. When she reached the top of the stairs she pounded
furiously on the door and found that it had been unlocked. She never found
out who unlocked it, but she didn't care, either. She ran all the way to
her room and hid on her bed. She never told the school staff what had happened,
fearing reprisals. And she never set foot in that cellar again, despite
the punishment of defiance.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's fine today, despite her horrific youth.
There were many other strange happenings there during her stay, but I am
considering a book about them and I want her to reap the benefits of its
sales if it happens. I'll save the creepier stuff for that.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Clown Face</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: margcop@adelphia.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a true story. About two years ago I went to a birthday party/sleepover
at a hotel.(I can't remember the name) It was just the three of us and
my friends mom. We were jumping on the beds and taking pictures with one
of those cameras were the picture comes out right away. I didn't realize
it till I got home but in one of the pictures,&nbsp; there was a an "evil"
clown face on a corner of the tv screen. The TV wasn't on and there was
no glare or anything. It totally freaked me out. Perhaps the hotal is haunted?</b><b></b>

THE OLD BUILDING WAS FASCINATING. A KOREAN COUPLE OWNED THE PLACE AND LIVED
DOWNSTAIRS FROM US IT WAS TWO LEVELS. SOMETIMES IT'S HARD FOR ME TO TELL
THIS STORY. I WAS IN MY TWENTY AND I LIKED TO PARTY AND SO DID JUNE. SO
AFTER THE BARS CLOSED WE'D GET FRIENDS TOGETHER TO COME OVER AND PARTY.
ONE NIGHT ROSEMARY STAYED THE NIGHT AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT I HEARD
HER SCREAMING AND SAYING STOP NO STOP, I STARTED TO GET OUT OF BED WHEN
SHE CAME IN MY ROOM BUGGED EYED AND CRYING SHE WAS UNASSAILABLE, I TOLD

<br><b>My Playmate and Others</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: htelehowski@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had many paranormal experiences since I was a young child.
At the age of four my mother and grandmother would visit the graves of
my father and grandfather, staying all day. I would play with a little
girl there while my grandmother and mother sat and talked. They believed
I had a imaginary playmate. Both are now dead themselves. I had decided
to check the records of the cemetery and had little trouble since it is
a small place. I found one girl that could have been the one I played with.
Her name was Mary Jane Walker and she died in 1866, at the age of nine
years of age. My husband and I decided to see if we could find the girls
grave, I told him to check the back of the cemetery because that was where
we played. He found the grave. I asked Mary Jane if I could take her picture,
I took three of the grave and one of my husband sitting on a tree stump
not far away. I had the pictures developed all the pictures were normal
except for the one of my husband there appears to be a vortex in it. I
have looked for all the usual problems but can find no rational explanation
for this. I now feel that I have proof of my friends existence.</b>
<br><b>My husband and I rented a house in Southwest Detroit in the 80's
that was very haunted. The first thing that happened was I was waiting
for the gas company to come to turn on the gas. I felt as though someone
was watching me, and I smelled pipe tabacco. I figured ok I am alone in
a strange place. I also thought that maybe the people who lived in the
front part of the house used pipe tabacco. I found out later that these
people were from India and were visiting that country. They moved out within
a week of returning to the US. All the problems in the house seemed to
originate in the attic. There was a log cabin built up there for children
to play in, it was complete to glass in the windows and a drawstring latch
for the door. I was only in there once but the feeling of uneasiness I
felt was real. We never allowed our children to play in it. The attic door
had no lock but my five year old daughter got locked in and was screaming
for us to let her out, although you could hear any noise from the upstairs
we never heard her, the door opened on it's own. I started to dream about
an old indian woman with a pock marked face, but since this was a dream
I never told anyone about it. One day a woman I had become friendly with
asked me if my mother was visiting, I told her I sure hoped not since my
mother was dead. She said that she saw a woman with long black hair in
my bedroom window, this sort of freaked me out since I was dreaming of
that indian woman and she had long black hair. One day this friend was
visiting me and we were sitting in the kitchen having coffee and talking
about nothing really. She seemed to go into a daze and was starting to
go up to my attic in fact she was insisting that she was going. I got her
back to the table and sitting down when something punched her in her head
hard enough to leave a red mark. She left and refused to come to visit
anymore. My husband and I had cleaned out the basement but yet my kids
found a ouija board down there. They showed us where it was nd we got rid
of it right away, we dont mess with that thing. Things seemed to quiet
down for a couple of weeks when the apartment in front of us was rented
to a young couple. They started to have problems right away. The keys hanging
on the wall would begin to sway. The rocker in the frontroom would start
rocking by itself. At first things only happened at night but these people
decided to contact this thing and things got bad from then, She would get
phone calls and when she answered no one would be on the line, except one
time she told me a voice told her to get out. We are christians and decided
enough was enough we had to have help. I turned on the radio to listen
to Evangel Echoes and call their prayer line for suggestions on what to
do. This program wasn't on yet but another one was and someone on that
program was praying in the spirit, suddenly from the basement came an unearthly
howl. Needless to say this woman and I got out of the house and waited
on the front porches for our husbands to get home. While all this was going
on my husband never noticed anything. One night my nephew was spending
the night and while he was praying this thing shot from our apartment to
the other one, banging things in its haste to leave. My nephew refused
to stay another night. One night my husband was in bed sleeping and I was
on my way up when I asked the man in the next apartment to go wake him
up and tell him to come sleep on the couch, he asked me what was wrong
and I told him I could see my husband in pieces. He did and the couch was
occipied that night. The only thing my husband noticed was one night we
were watching tv and it sounded like a dresser was being dragged down the
stairs, he heard that. We moved from there and the next place was no better.
What ever was there caused arguments. My nephew and his then girlfriend
were constantly fighting and it got that my husband and I were fighting
to, this was something we didn't normally do. We had the normal arguments
that married people have but this was getting se ous. Even one of my children
was being effected by this thing. It was appearing to her as a little girl
and talking to her, at first it was nice to her but as time went on it
was starting to get mean. We had bought this house and it might sound silly
but the best thing that happened was a arsonist burned us out and we had
to move. We have had no problems since. I don't believe this was a ghost
but rather a demon and why it hasn't followed us I have no idea but I thank
God that it hasn't. I have more stories but I have taken up enough time
as it is. I am glad that I can finally tell this story without fear of
people ridiculing me.</b>

<p><b>Bacon's Castle</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: christiansinger15@rcn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>There's a place in Smithfield, Virginia called Bacon's castle. It's
not really a castle, just a gigantic plantation house. They give tours
there on a daily basis. It was in the summer of 2003 that I went with a
summer Creative Writing group to tour this magnificent house and plantation.
As we toured the house, the tour guide told us all kinds of stories of
happenings, and how the house was shifted from family to family to family.
When we went up the stairs, we were greeted by a sudden draft. As my friends
as I sauntered through the house, it didn't get warmer. In fact, it got
colder. But the best part was when we reached the room where the woman
and her husband would have stayed. There was also a small cradle in the
center of the room. The tour guide spoke of a woman during the Civil War
who stayed in the room for months after her baby was born, because something
went wrong with the birth, and the child was terribly sick. When the child
died, the woman wouldn't leave the cradle. She remained there; convinced
she had to rock her to sleep. She wouldn't eat or sleep, and eventually,
she too died. As I stared into the room, I didn't notice anything, but
my friend Crystal asked me if I felt a breeze. When I said I didn't, she
said she didn't either, and pointed at the cradle, which was swaying back
and fourth noticeably. I didn't really think much of it, and after everyone
left, I took a picture, and then followed my friends up the stairs to the
attic. A few weeks later, I was looking through my pictures, and something
caught my eye in the picture of the room with the cradle in it. Sitting
in front of the cradle was a woman dressed in a Victorian style dress.
She was transparent, and a wispy hand gripped the cradle. I looked even
closer, and it looked as though she was smiling.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Hi, this is Andrea again and I would like to send you another of
my experiences with ghosts. My brother, Walter Hodge is especially sensitive
to ghosts and the supernatural. He has three special friends named Carlos,
Frank, and T. Lately they haven't been around much. But, a couple years
ago when my mom, my brother, and my sister were traveling by car from the
grocery store, my little brother said something to my mom about his friend
Carlos. So, my mom replied,"Well, you can tell Carlos to go away if he
is going to act that way." Walter then leaned toward the seat next to him
and suddenly looked at his mom and said,"Carlos doesn't like you anymore
mommy." My mom was incredibly frightened and talked very kindly about Carlos
ever after the experience.</b>

in half and was boiling hot. This is not the strange part. Not only had

<p><b>No One Home But Robert!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Gibbstrio@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello my name is Ray and I would like to share with you the experiences
that happened to my small family in 1996.&nbsp; We had been transfered
to the Houston area from San Antonio and found a two story four bedroom
house in the Clear Lake City area. A real fix it upper and&nbsp; it was
the worst looking house in a very nice community called Green Acres.&nbsp;
My Brother-In- Law (Robert) and sister helped us for six months remodeling,cleaning
up and making the place a nice home. Robert had sold his own home two years
earlier and lived in a travel trailer but missed his home.&nbsp; He jumped
in and was happy to do most of the work and was proud of the results.&nbsp;
A month after the house was finished we found out that Robert had terminal
cancer and had less than six months to live.&nbsp; The trailer was small
and so my wife and I decided to bring Robert into our house for his final
days.&nbsp; We put him downstairs in the formal living room and with the
help of Hospice we knew we could help Robert with a peaceful quiet death.&nbsp;
This was not the case.&nbsp; Robert fought hard for life and was terrified
of death because he had fought in Viet Nam and had killed many.&nbsp; He
did not know what was waiting for him on the other side.&nbsp; The end
came with Robert fighting to get out of bed, the look on his face one of
horror.&nbsp; As per his request he was left in his room for six hours
after death and then the funeral home was called and Robert left---or did
he!&nbsp; The week after the funeral things started not being right.&nbsp;
Odd bumps and sounds from downstairs late at night, our dog would not go
dowstairs after dark and furniture being moved.&nbsp; One morning the living
room sofa was standing on end with all the cushions still in place.&nbsp;
Dining room chairs would be taken and lined along the living room wall
and mirrors would vibrate.&nbsp; We called the Hospice Minister to the
house and he blessed every room but Robert still did not leave. We did!!!&nbsp;
The house stood vacant for awhile and new people moved in but their stay
was short, neighbors say two more families came and left.&nbsp; It has
been eight years now and just a while back I was in the area and went by
the house---it sits vacant again with a for sale sign in the front yard
--standing in front of the window of the room in which Robert died.&nbsp;
As I stood there remembering our last few months in that house a chill
ran down my back and I quickly got&nbsp; into my car drove away.</b>

<br><b>Possibly the Same</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Jjessi1971@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I sent a story to this site about 2 months ago "Is it my imagination
or something paranormal"</b>
<br><b>Well since then some new things have happened and I found out some
interesting information I didnt know before.&nbsp; When I first sent out
my story, I told my sister in law Jenna about it. (shes Jehova witness
too, but shes alittle more opened minded then my mother _in law) anyway
I told her what I had wrote, and she told me she had a girlfriend when
she was a teenager, about 15 years ago, that lived next door to her. The
side where I heard the whispering, and the house where the old couple had
died. I believe her family bought the house after the couple died. Anyhow,
she told that her friend was a little odd, because she had been sleeping
with her parents at night, but Jenna had found out later WHY. One night
she had stayed the night at her friends house and they slept in her friends
bed.&nbsp; Early in the morning Jenna had woken for some reason and noticed
that her friend was squirming alot, and moaning (almost like she was doing
the deed with someone, but no one was there)her arms where at her side.
So Jenna thought maybe she was having a dream, then she thought she may
have seen imprints on her friends body.&nbsp; She got startled with this
and woke her friend up, and told her friend what she had witnessed. Her
friend got so upset about it, she didnt want to talk about it at all, and
never did. To say the least Jenna never got asked again to stay another
night.</b>
<br><b>Then there is this other story that my mother_in law told me recently.&nbsp;
About my other sister in_laws house (linda), which ironically is across
the street from my mother in laws, and the other house. About a shadow
that lingers in her hall way, shaped like a person. They all have seen
it including my mother in_law. She swears that there is an explanation
for this, but she has admitted she cant find one. when she told me about
this shadow I got real nervous and I started to get goosebumbs and get
real cold.&nbsp; I told her some time last year when I stayed the night
at Lindas house, I was sleeping on her couch in the living room my back
to the hallway. There was a small light on where the fish tank was so it
wasnt completly dark. for some reason I woke up and turned around and I
saw this dark shadow move from the open hallway and disappear in the intrance
of Lindas kitchen.&nbsp; I was startled at first then got up to investigate
things, to see maybe it was the shadow of the fish tank, but theres is
no way it could have been with the position where the tank was. So I went
back to sleep thinking it was just my imagination, and I never told anyone
of that incident, until my mother-in law said something.&nbsp; She told
me not to say nothing to Linda because she gets freaked out about it, and
she said she will still be looking for a logical explanation for it. (good
luck on finding one in all 3 houses I was thinking to myself)</b>
<br><b>But one last thing. Back at my mother_in laws house. A couple of
weeks ago my neice Christine was staying the night, and my neice told that
when she went to got the bathroom in the middle of the night she came out
running, screaming, and petrified out of the hallway.&nbsp; She told my
neice crying histerically, that when she turned the corned to go into the
hallway that she saw a shadow figure walking towards her, my neice went
to look and nothing was there.&nbsp; And my 2 year old daughter will not
go near that hallway at all, one time I went to carry her down there to
show her nothing was down there she started crying real hard and grabbing
my neck and wouldnt let go, shaking badly.</b>
<br><b>So what ever is in my mother_in laws house, is possibly the same
THINGS that are in the other two houses. Makes me wonder if it goes in
the other neighbors houses!!!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghost in Cemetary</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: crazyalne@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was doing some just for fun ghost hunting with a couple of my friends
one night in a cemetary on an old gravel road. Two of my friends were out
in the cemetary looking around and my other friend decided to stay in the
car. As the two guys were out in the far corner of the cemetary I looked
to the center of the graveyard and seen something that made me loose my
breath for a few seconds. A blurry gray figure floated above one of the
grave stones and then looked to run through the air across three other
stones and then drop right behind another stone. After it disapeared I
asked my friend in the car with me if he had seen it too and he said he
did and he was as freaked as me. It was not light that created this because
it is pitch black out there. It was my first and so far only time I have
seen something like a ghost. Thankyou for sharing my story and keep going

<br><b>Scary Stuff</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Sun0630@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>These are some of the experiences that my friend had in her house.</b>
<br><b>First story:&nbsp; Her and her boyfriend were in the kitchen making
dinner for her Mom and there are some pans hanging from her wall.&nbsp;
All of a sudden a pan flew off the wall onto the middle of the floor.&nbsp;
There was no reason for it to fall because the nail was still there.</b>
<br><b>Another story is: Her and her boyfriend were watching TV in the
living room, and from the living room, they heard the distinct sound of
a pan falling, thinking that there was something wrong with the nails holding
the pans because of the other incident.&nbsp; Her boyfriend walked into
the kitchen to get the pan and found that there was nothing the floor.&nbsp;
On his way back to the living room, he saw that in her hallway, a Crucifix
had fallen.&nbsp; However, it was made of plastic and there was no possible
way for it to replicate the sound of a pan.</b>
<br><b>3rd Story:&nbsp; Everyone in my friend's house was asleep with the
exception of her Mom, who had to get up early to go to work.&nbsp; Her
Mom went up stairs to get something from my friend's brother's room.&nbsp;
Her brother likes the movie "Creature from the Black Lagoon" and has an
action figure that moves and makes sounds when you press a button.&nbsp;
When she entered the room, the action figure started to move, but she didn't
press the button and it didn't make any noise.&nbsp; BOO.</b>
<br><b>Fourth Story:&nbsp; My friend and I were watching a scary movie.&nbsp;
During one of the creepy parts, the TV shut off and the movie ejected by
itself. DUN DUN DUN</b>
<br><b>Last Story:&nbsp; My friend and her boyfriend were watching TV,
and decided to go to the kitchen to get a snack.&nbsp; They turned off
the TV, and started to fix up the living room.&nbsp; While they were cleaning,
the TV turned back on and the channel switched to 13.</b><b></b>

I recently moved to Arkansas and bought a home in April.&nbsp; 3/1 rock
house with a huge pond on 1.63 acres in Booneville, Arkansas.&nbsp; I fell
in love with this house as soon as I saw that it had a "for sale by owner"
sign in front of it. I called the number and they were selling it for 48,000.&nbsp;
I thought "My God, this is cheap for such a beautiful home."</b>
<br><b>I moved in.&nbsp; I have a 9 year old son and 1 cat. About the end

my left side looking out into the black of the living room, and I heard
what sounded like someone walking in it.&nbsp; Now, my sons sometimes wake
up in the middle of the night and come sleep with me, so I naturally thought
it was them.&nbsp; I called out their names. No answer.&nbsp; Then I thought
maybe it was my cat, but then I noticed her laying at my feet on the bed.&nbsp;
It sounded like someone was walking from the kitchen/livingroom entrance
towards my room.&nbsp; Second, my television is hooked up to the stereo
because the speaker on the tv is blown.&nbsp; Well, when I have to be to
work at 11:30pm, I usually take a shower around 9:45pm, and my 9 year old
goes over to his fathers house. One night I turned my stereo on and put
a disk in (5 disk cd changer).&nbsp; It was on disk 4 song number 11 (there
were 2 songs) and it should have switched to disk 5 after it was done with
song 12.&nbsp; I took my shower and had the stereo loud enough to where
I could hear it.&nbsp; All of a sudden I didn't feel the vibration of the
music anymore.&nbsp; I thought well maybe it's at a quiet part.&nbsp; When
I got out of the shower, I still heard nothing.&nbsp; I put my ear to the
door. Nothing.&nbsp; I went out and looked at the stereo and it was not
on cd anymore, but on FM radio on 101.00 and that is not a station at all.
It's just fuzz. There was no one else in the house but me and my cat.&nbsp;
That was on a Friday night.&nbsp; Two days later on Sunday night, my son
and I were watching television around the same time between 9:45 and 10:00pm,
in the middle of television, the radio goes from Auxillary to FM Radio
101.00. Fuzz. My son says, "Mom what did you do I was watching that."&nbsp;
I told him I didn't do anything.&nbsp; On a Saturday, my son was at his
fathers and I was there alone with the cat, and she started going crazy.
At one point she was standing in the doorway of my room and the living
room looking at me. She meowed and took off like crazy into the back bedroom
belonging to my youngest son. She came racing back into the living room.
Just then I heard a loud boom come from the room like something fell. It
shook the entire house. My stomach had butterflies in it then and I got
up to go see. My son one tall dresser with small bionicle toys on it. But
they were all still on there.&nbsp; There wasn't anything else that could
fall from any place.</b>
<br><b>I have always heard pipes rattling under the house since I moved
in.&nbsp; Out of the corner of my eye, I always see things dart quickly
about.&nbsp; I haven't seen it full on, but I know it moves quick.&nbsp;
I haven't took pictures in my house yet or out of it for that matter.&nbsp;
Also, I have a 2-car garage. Sometimes when me and my son pull up from
his school, both garrage doors are closed.&nbsp; In the morning, sometimes
the right one is open.</b>

<p><b>Ghostly Faces</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: pintsizedpenguin@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have never really been a great believer but for the past 8 or so
years, since me and my mum moved from our old flat to our new house i have
experienced numerous experiences. The fisrt was when i was about 6. My
bedroom is the box room and so its small, my bed touches each side of the
room with the door to the left. I was lying in bed waiting for my grandma,
who was babysitting, to bring my water. I looked up at the wall and saw
a strange shadow. It was like a side profile of someones head, i could
see the nose, mouth and hair clearly, it couldnt have been my own shadow
since the only light came from the ceiling and i was lying down in bed.
I watched it for a few senconds then it semed to fade before my eyes. I
though it was just because i was tired and so ignored it.</b>
<br><b>I had no further experiences until seven years later in 2003. i
was lay in bed once again, the light off and about 12 o clock at night.
I was really tired and was trying to fall asleep. My bedroom had been rearranged
so the door was opposite my bed and one side of my bed was pushed against
the wall. I had my back to the walland was staring into the darkness when
i felt a cold breeze on the back of my neck. Thanking it was just a draught
i rolled over to face the wall. On the wall probably 3 inches from y face
was another face. I could tell it was a man and he had a black hood up,
all i could see of his face was a pair of cold eyes and what i can only
describe as green pint of face paint on his cheek. I closed my eye for
a few secons thinking i was seeing things and when i opened them the face
was still there. I dont know how long i stared at it but in the end i fell
asleep and in the morning could find no trace of what was there the night
before.</b>
<br><b>These sightings carried on for weeks, always appearing on the wall
at night. I didnt tell my mum about the face but asked if i could have
my bed moved back to its original place. We moved it and i sleep peacefully
that night. The following night i went to bed about 2 o clock since i had
been up watching a movie on television. I got in bed as usual and rolled
over to face the radiator like i had done for years before but the face
was there again. This time however it was more vivid and real. It seemed
to be sneering in the dark and more treatening than before. I rolled over
so my back was to the wall but i could feel the cold breeze that i had
felt the last few weeks whenever the face appeared, I pulled the covers
round me, refusing to look back at the face. The incidents got less frequent
over the weeks and i believed that the face was going. One night i was
sat at my computer in the corner of our living room. I have a cockatiel
whose cage is right next to the computer desk who was asleep and my mum
was in the kitchen making a drink. I didnt really notice anything until
i heard my bird start to hiss and back away into the corner of his cage,
wondering what fightened him i heard a scarping noise. I looked to the
side of the computer to see my glass moving towards the egde of the desk.
There was no way it could be moving because of our house being set on a
rise because it it where so it should be sliding the other way. I lifted
my hand to stop the glass from falling off the desk, when i touched it,
the glass was cold, even th gh i hadnt had a cold drink in it. The strangest
thing was that when i went to push the glass back i couldnt, something
was still trying to push the glass. I had to shove it quiet had before
i could get the glass to move. When i did my bird came back to the fornt
of the cage and looked as though nothing had even happened.</b>
<br><b>I had gone to bed earlier than my mum that night and must have been
asleep when she came up. Once again the face was there but this time the
presence was really strong, my bedroom was icy cold when it is normally
the hottest room in the house. About 1 o clock i woke up shivering and
could feel something gripping my arm but as i come to it released its grip.
I rolled over to see the face once again but it looked different. The smirk
had gone and it looked more angry than anything else. I didnt sleep that
night and i couldnt stop in the room so i spent the night sat on my sofa
with the lights on downstairs.</b>
<br><b>When my mum came down in the morning she was shocked to see me up
but i just said i had woken up early and come down, i didnt want her to
know. Later that afternoon we where having dinner when she asked if i had
had a nightmare last night. I couldnt recall anything but the face and
the cold hand so i asked why. She said she had heard my talking in my sleep
which i had never done before that. She said i was telling someone to get
away and dont touch me over and over. Then after about 5 mins i when quieter
and was mumbling things like, why are you doing this and just go away.
When i asked her what time she said it was about half 12, just before i
woke with the hand gripping my arm.</b>
<br><b>I havnt seen the face or had any strange experiences since that
night and im not quiet sure what happened either. I dont know if i did
something to make it all go away and that was why the mans face looked
so angry but im glad there gone. I still expect to see the face every night
but so far i havnt. I finally told my mum about it all and she sked if
i wanted to have the house blessed but i said no, although scary the face
did no harm to anyone and its gone now anyway.</b><b></b>
