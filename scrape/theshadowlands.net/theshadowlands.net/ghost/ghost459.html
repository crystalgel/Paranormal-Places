<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Personal Experiences - The
'Ghost' Named Bel<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By: rainforestia@yahoo.ca<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">The house I lived in for most
of my life had a strong reputation for being haunted even before my parents
bought it. It makes me think &#8216;what in the name of god possessed them to buy it,
then?&#8217;, but it always seems young people are attracted to ghosts. Maybe they
thought, &#8216;Hey, how long could we stay in this house before being scared
shitless?&#8217;. Maybe it was &#8216;my lifes goal is to live with a ghost! How cool!&#8217;. Of
course, their motivation doesn&#8217;t really matter to me, since they were settled
in by the time I was born (April 28th , to be precise). Maybe they experienced
things before me, maybe not; I never really discussed it with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My mom was deeply religious,
one of those bible freaks, always telling me to think of &#8216;what jesus would do&#8217;.
I went to a catholic school. As such, my love for religion flickered out at an
early age, and it became merely an annoyance. I didn&#8217;t like believing in things
I couldn&#8217;t see. I suppose you might call me an athiest, although I&#8217;d rather not
be associated with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Back to the house: the house
was quite big, lots of rooms (that I can remember getting lost in a few times
as a kid), with a big backyard. The backyard had a fence on the east and west
sides, and where the fencing ended a forest began. It was a forest of those
dark, needle trees (not sure what kind, sorry), that always exited me as a kid,
thinking &#8216;oh, I have a backyard full of christmas trees!&#8217;. At the same time I
never liked that forest, it was so dark even when the sun was high above it. I
never really liked the whole backyard, either, despite it being furnished with
a swingset, a sandbox, and a garden to get lost in. I was never outside at
night, either, even if my parents and their friends were out and holding a
party&#8212;it was just so dark and forboding and eerie.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">The backyard is, however,
also the place I first saw Bel &#8211; and by saw I mean he was standng right there,
in front of my two eyes, at the edge of the forest. I was on the swings, going to
and fro with a light wind in my face. When I spotted him, the wind just kind of
stopped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">At the distance I was, I
couldn&#8217;t make out much, just a little boy in some sort of green shirt and blue
pants, with brown hair. I froze, stopped the swing instantly, wondering why a
kid was in the forest, and just how he&#8217;d managed to wander his way to my
backyard. I was four at the time, I hadn&#8217;t started school yet, and I&#8217;d never
socialized with the kids in my neighboorhood beyond a smile and a wave (I was
so shy back then), so I didn&#8217;t really know how to react.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My dad was just a little ways
off, and he saw me stop. He came over, asking me what was wrong, and I just
looked at him with wide eyes, pointing to the trees. He looked. &#8216;What, honey?&#8217;
he asks. I look back to where the boy was, and he had dissappeared. I assummed
he&#8217;d run back into the forest. When I realized this, a tension and fear I
hadn&#8217;t known had slipped over me fell away, and I can remember the rest of the
day being vividly happier (When I remember this encounter, the colors always
seem dimmed, like an overcast day).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I didn&#8217;t actually learn Bel&#8217;s
name then, in case you can&#8217;t tell. After that, I never saw him for a long
while. At six, I met him again. Ever since some things that had happened when I
was five I was afraid of the dark, and I slept with a nightlight. I could never
fall asleep without backround noise for the same reasons, so I always kept my
fan on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I remember this part vividly
for such an old memory&#8212;I woke up in the middle of the night, feeling something
was wrong, and my guess was spot on. My fan had stopped, the night light gone
out, leaving me in pitch black. The only light streamed in from my curtains and
glowed from my clock&#8212;which read 1:30 (an important number from here on out).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Once that settled in on me I
got scared, wondering if I would hear scratches or knocks or footsteps, or see
anything out of the corners of my eyes. I felt a weight on my bed then, at the
very end (back then I didn&#8217;t take up much space on my bed, being so tiny. Also liking
to curl up when I fell alseep made the space I took up even smaller). As my
eyes adjusted to the darkness, I could see whatever it was better&#8212;and then I
could really see him, sitting crosslegged, hands on his lap.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">He had a cute face, with
short brown hair that came to his chin and pretty blue eyes. He was wearing
that same green longsleeve shirt, the same bluejeans. His feet were bare, and,
I noticed, his toenails were sharp-looking. Despite the harmless appearance, I
was uneasy (Who wouldn&#8217;t be, at a boy that randomly appears at night in your
bed, and also is in possession of sharp toes?). Then he grinned, revealing
ordinary teeth, and the feeling diminished (though never actually disappeared,
it&#8217;s always been there, even now; a kind of instinctual danger, like he could
kill me without a moments notice).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I asked him who he was, to
which he responded with a name I can&#8217;t ever remember. His voice seemed to suit
his boyish appearance, though, and I was at ease. I asked him, &#8216;Can I call you
Belle?&#8217;. He said if that was the french word, then no, and I pouted playfully.
He took my hand, and traced out the letters B, E, and L. I noticed he had sharp
fingernails, too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">&#8220;Nice to meet you, Bel,&#8221; I
said, and he smiled, then vanished. Slowly, the devices in my room whirred back
to life&#8212;my nightlight, my fan, my computer. I knew that if something turned off
electronics with its presence it was bad news, but I was smitten with my first
ever friend outside my family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Over the years, only a few
people other than me have seen Bel. First was my friend Lulu (A nickname I made
out of her initials, L.L.), and Lulu still sees him to this day. She think&#8217;s
he&#8217;s awesome, but is a little more unsettled by him than I am.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Second was my older sister,
whom I was especially close to when I was 12-15. As we grew closer, we&#8217;d like
to sleep in the same room at night, staying up well into the sunrise talking
and playing games, the favourite being Pokemon on our GBs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">One night when we wee in the
same room, Bel appeared in the mirror opposite my bed, grinning. When my sis
realized I wasn&#8217;t paying attention to my game, she looked up, only to be scared
shitless by said &#8216;boy&#8217; (who looked older than he had when I was six; he seemed
to alter his appearance to suit my age). After a year she got used to Bel. We
never told our mom of him (having enough problems with her without the ghost
boy). Then, when I was 15, she and I got in a big fight, and after that night
she&#8217;s reported a total lack of Bel sightings, to her confusion. Noticably, that
night my sis had sleep paralysis for the first time. Wether it&#8217;s related or not
I can&#8217;t really say. I was well versed in what caused sleep paralysis at the
time, but a little voice likes to chalk it up to Bel being naughty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Also, it seems Bel likes to
have an opinion on my boyfriends. He disapproved of my first one, was alright
with my second, and hated my third. In fact, he may have saved my dignity with
the third one. Mister 3 was unsatisfied with my not putting out with him, and
one night we were alone in my room and he was being too touchy-feely for me, he
happened to glance into that big mirror across from my bed. At the time I
wasn&#8217;t sure what was wrong; he stiffened and after a moment of silence started
screaming and ran out of the house. I was kind of freaked and confused as I
watched him get into his car and drive away, until I turned around and saw Bel
in the mirror, chuckling. Next day 3 broke up with me via text message.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">In case you may think he&#8217;s
there all the time, he&#8217;s not. He comes and goes, sometimes with me for hours at
a time, sometimes gone for weeks at a time. Sometimes he appears as real as I
am, and sits with me on my bed or walks with me and we talk, and other times
he&#8217;ll appear in a mirror or reflection. Every time he does he scares the shit out
of me, it&#8217;s just like, bam, and he&#8217;s there.There are times he won&#8217;t appear at
all, and he&#8217;ll just be a kind of presence, like he does sometimes at night or
during class like in my highschool years. In HS he liked to freak me out during
exams by just coming as a voice, though it also had the effect of taking away
my exam jitters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I suppose you could pass him
off as a hallucination, but would I have the same hallucination for 20 years?
Also, my sis saw him, if only for a few years, and my friend sees him, too. Not
to mention that freakout my 3rd had (though it might be completely unrelated).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I&#8217;ve contemplated him being a
ghost, but I asked him once, and he just laughed at me. I&#8217;ve thought of demon,
which might explain the forboding-ness? But if I take into account your
explanation of demons, he&#8217;d terrify me, and I probably wouldn&#8217;t be unharmed. I
thought of angel, but that just... no. For some reason I find the existance of
demons more plausible than the existance of angels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Haha, there was one time he
and I talked about that, and he said, &#8216;if you can believe in the existance of
extremely evil beings, why not extremely good ones?&#8217;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Keep in mind, when figuring
out what he is, that he&#8217;s been in plain sight of people like my mother and
father and yet been totally undetected. He&#8217;s done little dances around them
without the faintest trace of them noticing (it&#8212;haha, I&#8217;m sorry, those were
just hilarious). He&#8217;s like a person, except a person that can appear and
disappear at will, and not be seen by those he doesn&#8217;t want to be (which is so
awesome).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Damn, this is long. If you&#8217;ve
read through all my ramblings, I congratulate you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Bel&#8217;s been an.. Entertaining
part of my life, even if I&#8217;m not quite sure what he is.... Ah, I just realized
I mentioned nothing else on the 1:30 topic. Oh well. And everythingI write,
ever, comes out kind of like a story. :/<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">After Death Experience<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By: pierre.briand@rogers.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">In 1984 my father in law
died. We were living in their house, in the basement, because my father in law
was dying of cancer and my mother in law was paralysed. On February 16 he died
during the night. We had to call the emergency services and the doctor to
confirm his death. We called my wife's sister to come home and take her mother
with her for a little while. The house was a nice bungalow my father in law
bought after he retired. He died 2 years after. There was a service at the
funeral home and we got back in the house. We were alone in hte house and we
were living with our 2 boys. The kids went to sleep early and we started
watching TV my wife and I in the basement where we were living. There was no
one on the main floor, the house was empty. I went a few time upstairs to get
refresment from the fridge and I went back downstair. I always make sure all
the doors and windows are closed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">We were watching when we
started hearing the rocking chair rock. My father in law was always rocking
slowly on the chair. It was the same sound. Suddenly we hear foot step on the
first floor and coming through the stairs to our apartment. The footstep
stopped at the door. I was standing at the door and opened it very fast. There
was nothing, no one. We went upstair and seached all the premises, every rooms,
every wardrobe, The door were closed and there was no one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">It was a frightening experience
however I don't know why I opened the door as the footsteps stopped in front of
the door. My wife helped me to search all the house, the kids were sleeping
heavily and never woke up during the event. My wife remembered that a long time
before she told her father that if he dies, he should do something to show her
there was something after death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">The house was sold a few
months after and we moved in another city. The house was sold and I dont know
if any phenomena occured in the house after.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">This is a true story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Ok, I know this is a weird
way to start off a story about a ghost/haunting, but it&#8217;s what happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t think I have ever lived in a place
that didn&#8217;t have &#8220;something/someone&#8221; else there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t believe in ghosts, I KNOW there are
ghosts. This was last Sunday, January 18th about 2:30 p.m.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know the time and I think I know why this
happened at this time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the heck am
I talking about?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well&#8230;okay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here goes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">The catbox, is one of those
kind that has a tray and 2 sifter trays.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It had just been cleaned the night before, and wasn&#8217;t too messy
yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My husband and I had gone out
to get Burger King for lunch, and bring it home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We come in the house though the laundry room,
into the kitchen, past the cat box and go into our room.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I went and sat on my bed (we
all hang out in my room, me, hubby and room mates) to get ready to eat my
burger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could hear the cats playing in
the living room, and my dog was in his &#8220;bed&#8221; (a crate, he is a husky and can&#8217;t
be trusted to not get into everything and he thinks the kitties are wonderful
squeaky toys!).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we leave the house
he goes in his &#8220;bed&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn&#8217;t want to
let him out yet, since we were going to be eating lunch and he like any other
dog, begs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My husband forgot something
and went back into the kitchen mere seconds after we just walked through.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He calls back to us (my room mate and I) &#8220;Hey
who did that to the catbox?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Huh? Who
did what? Where?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was fine when we
just walked through a second ago!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got
up and went in the kitchen with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">One of the sifter trays had
been lifted, sifted and set back down diagonally on the edge of the rest of the
catbox!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was like someone had been
trying to clean it, set it down again so they could grab a bag so they could
dump it!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There wasn&#8217;t time for my
husband to do that (he&#8217;s a big fellow and doesn&#8217;t bend over to well).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It couldn&#8217;t have been the cats getting their
nails caught on the sifter part (one is declawed, the other has his
claws).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would have made a tremendous
noise (and mess) too, aside from that; there just wasn&#8217;t time for it to
happen!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn&#8217;t my dog either, as he
was locked in his &#8220;bed&#8221; (side note, he was &#8220;crying and fussing&#8221; but we thought
he just wanted out of his bed).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn&#8217;t
my room mate, because she is in a wheelchair, and she was in the room with
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other room mate was gone to
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sitting on my bed and I sure
didn't do it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Well, who did it?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think it was my father in law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You see, Sunday, January 18th was the 4th
anniversary of his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He died about
2:30 a.m. (even though this happened at 2:30 p.m.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also could have been my mother in law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was a neat freak and cleaned her cats box
several times a day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes, I think
I wish she would come back and continue with that chore!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hate cleaning the catbox!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">The Cheshire Ghost ((Ike.))<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By:

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My ghost story wasn't
particularly unpleasant. I knew the ghost well, and I'm hesitant to call him
just a ghost. In fact, to understand the story, you'd probably need to know
what he was like before he died. For all intents and purposes, we'll call him
Ike.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>He was in seventh grade when he died,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a week and a day shy of his thirteenth
birthday. He had always been a...disturbed child, with his parents not
emotionally being there and physically abusing him. After his mother gave birth
to a harlequin child, she began to believe that the child was posessing her to
beat him. She would slam him up against the wall until he started to bleed, or
until somebody else interfered. He came from a bad family, so nobody ever did.
After his mother died and he foud her body, he was never right. He'd walk down
the halls, whispering frantically about ceiling fans a cables [she hung herself
with a cable hanging from their ceiling fan] and not even the school counsellor
could get a coherent sentence out of him. After thirteen months and thirteen
days, he commited suicide by cutting himself up. The thing they decided that
made him "crazy" was not that he killed himself, but that he killed
his cat first. He loved his cat more than anything. Pumpkin. He killed Pumpkin
so that they would always be together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">A week after the funeral, his
dad and brother left shortly after with their bags packed soon to head off to
Oregon, I thought I saw Pumpkin in my lawn. It was a usual occurence, so I
didn't think much about it until the painful reality hit me. I looked back, and
Pumpkin was at my feet, purring and rubbing against my leg. I didn't feel cold
or anything, in fact, I didn't feel the cat at all. It might have been just
another cat, you say, but it wasn't. Pumpkin didn't look like any two cent cat.
His fur was mostly the color of the the sunset. A red with with a kind of
orange streak. His ears were black, with orange tips, and the section around
his eyes were black and his face was white, giving him the appearence of a
raccoon. Unsure of what I should do, I reached down. Pumpkin looked up at me
with his beautiful sapphire eyes, and walked away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I walked inside, trying not
to think too much about the fact that what I just saw and heard was impossible.
I did my math, my reading, my science all in silence, which is, looking back,
weird. Nothing else happened for the rest of the day. After school the next day,
Pumpkin was there again. And the next. And the next. But it three days after my
first encounter that changed me. My cat, Phrenic, can't stand other cats. He
looked at Pumpkin, the only cat he had tolerated, then at me, and tried to rub
up against Pumpkin. Pumpkin stepped back from my cat, and looked at me again.
It never seemed ghostly at all. It wasn't see-through, it didn't simply vanish,
it just...seemed. I walked towards the cat, and reached out my hand towards it,
when I heard a chuckle from behind me. Startled, I turned around quickly, but
no one was there. I looked back at the cat, and it was already in the other
lawn, running away quickly. Other animals in the neighborhood seemed to be
watching it and trying to run after it, while the owners struggled with the
leashes. The chuckle replayed itself in my mind like a broken record, the
memory haunting me that night. I had heard before. But from where?<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">The next day I didn't see
Pumpkin in my lawn, but I did see something else. Phrenic was holding something
in his mouth, and try to bury it. I took it from him and studied it. It was
Pumpkin's collar. I felt my head get light. His dad had pretty much thrown me
the cat for me to bury. I had buried the collar with it inside the shoebox. I
swallowed, figuring that some dog probably dug it up and Phrenic found the
collar and was attempting to give his friend another burial. I put the collar
around my wrist, and went inside. I put it on my nightstand, and went to do my
homework. I was in the process of writing my math down, when I could have sworn
I saw an arm near my nightstand. I looked up sharply, and didn't see anything
out of place or out of the ordinary. I opened my door and my windows to let in
more light.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Later that night, while I was
just drifting off to sleep, I felt a presure on my bed. Figuring it was my cat,
I shifted to make room. I heard the sound of breathing, and kicked a little.
The pressure went on my leg. My eyes snapped open and I sat up quickly, face to
face with Ike. Terror gripped my heart, and tears stung my eyes and nose. He
frowned at me, and put his finger on his lips. I was overcome with feeling of
grief, despair, and...loneliness. I reached out to touch him, and he gripped my
hand. It was icy, but that's how his skin felt in life. He put his head on my
head, and looked up at me with a smile. The negative emotions started to slide
away, and I wanted to shift closer. He shook his head no, but took both of my
hands in his. He didn't really speak like he did when he was alive, but I heard
his voice in my mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">"I feel better
now."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">His eyes, in life they had
been a dull teal, were now a bright blue, filled with happiness and emotion.
Tears were streaming down my face, no longer from grief but of joy. He looked
at my night stand, and he...I don't know how to describe the motion. He didn't
walk, he didn't glide, he just...moved. He moved to the nightstand and got the
collar, and he was back beside me. Pumpkin jumped up on his lap, and Ike put
the collar around Pumpkin's neck. He looked at me, with a slow, unsure sort of
look. "I love you." I whispered, unsure. He smiled, and leaned over
to kiss my forehead. "Goodbye." My voice was tight with effort not to
cry out for him to stay, not to go away again, but he put his finger now to his
lips. My thoughts cleared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">"I'll watch." <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">For two years I didn't see
Mickey after that. I never said a word to my parents, always afraid they would
think I was a lunatic. In December of 2008, I saw him again. I had been going
through tough times, going through the drama of being a freshman in highschool
and I had basically become depressed. One night I felt the pressure of the bed
again, and I sat up, face-to-face with Ike. He still looked like a twelve year
old. He shook his head, and put his finger to my lips.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">"I'm still here."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">With those words, everything
that I had been bottling up came pouring out of my mouth. Emotions, teachers,
everything. He listened to me like no counsellor ever would or could. He nodded
when I was done, and shrugged. He told me that at the end of the game, the king
and the pawn go into the same box. He leaned over and kissed my forehead. He
took Pumpkin in his hand, and he went clearer and clearer until you couldn't
see him anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought, after he left,
of the Cheshire cat. He was gone, but I could still feel his lips on my
forehead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I haven't told anyone about
Ike, as you can imagine they would think I'm bonkers. I didn't read any stories
like this, so I'm wondering if I'm seeing a ghost or just losing my mind. Then
again, I did read all of one page of the site's stories.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know if there's a way that you can
send me an email back, but if you could just...maybe give me some kind of link
or advice or anything? I'm starting to feel like I'm honestly and truly crazy.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By: jericcox@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I've been visiting The
Shadowlands webpage frequently for many years. I really enjoy reading all of
the stories and articles. They're very fascinating, and you and all of the
others who work on it have done a superb job. Anyway, let me get to the main
point, although my experiences are not very dramatic when compared to the other
stories I have read on your site. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I've been living in the same
house all of my life. For most of this period, strange things have happened,
albeit very infrequently, maybe only a handful of times each year. Primarily,
I've heard noises. The most common is the sound of a kitchen cabinet door
slamming shut when I'm the only one in the house. Usually, this occurs maybe
two or three times a year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Things have also been known
to fall for no apparent reason. Now, I will admit that these occurences are by
far the most suspect of all of them. However, the one that I'm most convinced
about was the ironing board falling over last year. It was propped up at a
slight backwards angle against a closet door, when it fell forward with nobody
near it. That's the only time it has ever happened. If it had been completely
verticle, I could more readily explain this as natural, but the fact that it
was leaning backward at the time makes it harder for me to do so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Several years ago, one of the
more uneplainable events occured. My father smokes, and keeps his cigarettes on
the counter in the kitchen with his lighter on top of them. We were watching
the end of a NASCAR race one night in May, when we heard a noise behind us.
When we went over to check it out, the lighter was laying about one inch away
from the cigarette pack. No one had been anywhere near it to cause that to
happen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">The most recent occurences
happened over the last few nights. Twice, I've felt something like a cat rubbed
up against my leg in the kitchen. I will say, however, that I'm still not ready
to chalk this one up entirely to the paranormal just yet. I was wearing loose
clothing, which can move easily. The only thing strange is that I've never felt
that before, and I've worn these same clothes many times prior. Two nights ago,
I also saw a red orb-like object in my bedroom about six feet above the floor,
which disappeared nearly as soon as I saw it. Just like the cabinets, perhaps
it was my eyes playing a trick on me, but that's the first time I've ever seen
anything like it in my home. Anyway, the jury's still out, so to speak.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">All of these I could probably
brush off in one way or another, if it wasn't for two things. The first is the
most convincing experience I've had in my home ever, which occured last year. I
was preparing to go to bed one night and had just walked out of the bathroom
into the hallway, when I felt (and heard) someone blow into my left ear. I
can't say that I was frightened, but definitely startled. Also, a former
co-worker (and a friend of one of my cousins) who has a fairly substantial
psychic ability, commented that she saw a spirit standing behind me one day at
work. She could only give a vague description (height, build, etc), but one
thing that stuck out was the ten-gallon hat he was wearing. I mentioned some
relatives to her, all of whom she said didn't feel right. However, when I
mentioned the name of my great uncle, it felt like a match to her. I went home,
rounded up some photographs, and took them to work the next day. After showing
her the photos, she positively identified the figure as my great uncle. It's
not surprise he would be following me. He had a deep love of history, a passion
which I also have. Regrettably, he died when I was only about six years old, so
I never got to talk with him. His only son died in Vietnam, and he and his wife
were devastated as a result. Perhaps I remind him of his son, and he's drawn to
me as a result. I can't prove that, but it's the only thing that makes sense to
me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I have had other experiences,
but these are pretty much confined to sensations of chills running down my
spine and other typical physical reactions that people have when spirits are
supposed to be present. These sensations occur with great frequency, at least
several times a week. These are the only experiences that occur regularly.
Also, my cats will stare at apparently empty space for no reason, suddenly
turning their heads to look at something that caught their attention when
there's nothing there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">As of now, I have no
conclusive explanation for these events. I don't know who or what is
responsible, and honestly don't have any intentions of finding out unless it
becomes necessary. Who knows, perhaps all of these can be explained naturally,
and there's nothing to any of it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">In closing, I will say that I
have a strong belief in the supernatural and in hauntings. However, I will also
say that when it comes to paranormal occurences, I try to be rational as well,
looking for any natural explanations before jumping to conclusions. I admit
that in most of these cases, I'm undecided as to whether or not they are truly
supernatural, and likely will never really know. The only two that I have
extreme difficulty explaining away are the lighter being moved and my ear being
blown on. Again, I realize that my stories are not nearly as remarkable as many
of the others I have read, but I just thought that I would share them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Again, thanks for all of the
work that you, Dave, and the rest of the staff have put into the Shadowlands.
Y'all are extremely dedicated to it, and it definitely shows. Y'all have made
it by far one of the most interesting and informative websites on the internet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Even though I am terrified of
this kind of stuff, reading stories and watching things on tv about it is very
interesting to me. I have a story to share. It is still very fresh to me even
though it has been many years ago that it has taken place. My husband and kids
laugh at me when I tell them my story just because of some of the things that
went on. They find it more humorously amusing than seriously true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This story took place when I was about 5 or 6
years old in a house we lived at in Oregon, Ohio. I really even dont know where
to begin...The house was a 2 story home that wasn't huge, but sure wasnt small.
I had 2 brothers and they shared a bedroom with me having my own bedroom right
next door to theirs. In their closet was this blue plastic hanging shoe rack
that was left when we moved in. It was completley empty except for a few
bouncey balls and metal jacks in some of the pockets. Every day we would check
these pockets becasue whenever we would empty them, there was always more the
next day! I never thought anything weird about that...it was cool finding
things in there. My room had a door that led to the closet. I never heard
anything scarey in my room, but one night my grandparents spent the night..they
came from <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">florida</st1:place></st1:State>
and were visiting us before moving on to other relatives. In the middle of the
night, everyone ran into the room because my grandpa woke up screaming. He said
the cat had crawled under the mesh part of the box spring and scared him.
Everyone went back to bed, and nothing was thought of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Months went by and summer was here. My
brothers and I used to all lay in the hallway upstairs outside our rooms in
front of a box fan my dad would put up cause it was soooo<span style="">&nbsp; </span>hot. Sometime in the middle of the night my
younges brother Mike woke up, I guess to sleep in my room, and began screaming.
He said my older brother Jake's face was on the wall scaring him! Jake had been
laying in the hall way the entire time with me and Mike! Still, everyone
shrugged that off like all the other things that happened, and figured he was
sleep walking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have heard things
through out the night on and off after that last incident. But the last and
scariest part of this house that happened to me,and Im not sure how much time
in between this happened,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>is one night
when I was sleeping with my cat. It was sometime in the middle of the night and
for some reason I woke up. My cat also woke up. My cat was tucked under my arm
at my side and all of sudden it opened its eyes wide and hissed with its hair
standing up on its back. Then he darted out of my room. I didnt understand why
the cat acted like this...and seconds later, at the end of my bed was this
figure. It was definatley human, but was all white and misty. It had no
features, or limbs. the only feature I remember seeing is<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and "O" like shape mouth. It was
just standing there...but then looked like it was moving slowly closer. I
kicked my feet at it, and nothing happened. I had just kicked right through
it!!! I was scared to death and ran into my parents room and slept there the
rest of the night. I thought I heard sounds coming from the drawers of my dads
dresser the rest of the night, but never heard or seen anything since.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband like I said, finds this humorous
so last year he bought some ball and jacks and placed them on my pillow and
laughed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would love to find out if
anyone living in that house after or before me ever had any experiences like
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I always wondered why that
"thing" would want to scare us like that!!! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

ghost hunting story<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By: dablainester@gmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">One night in October of 2008,
my friends, Scott, Denny, and Steve, and I decided we wanted to go ghost
hunting. Scott was the only one who had experience with anything and he had
seen things and had things happen to him and other people in his past
groups.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We started off by going to Peace
Church Cemetery in where the murderer Billy Cook is buried. We were equipped
with a video camera (me), a digital camera, a digital voice recorder, a 'heavy
duty' flashlight (Scott), and two smaller flashlights with the other two
people. We walked around for a little bit as Scott instructed us to let our
senses take hold of us and guide us as they please; if we got an impulse to do
something, do it. We had all had weird feelings, but eventually realized we
weren't going to find anything here. We left, deciding to go somewhere that
Scott had had experiences before: the Waco Cemetery. Once we got there we said
our opening prayer and made our way out into the cemetery. Eventually we split
into two groups, me and Steve in one, Scott and Denny in the other. Steve told
me to get a couple of specific things on video, he thought he had seen
something he said was best described as a specter, with a head that shaped into
a point and a cloaked, black body. We walked around for a bit longer and he
told me he had seen it again. We walked toward the area he saw it and didn't
see<span style="">&nbsp; </span>anything. We met back up with Denny
and Scott on the other side of the cemetery and Scott started talking about the
things that had happened to him here. He had been asking questions and talking
in general trying to pick up some EVP. He started talking about what he called
the 'prankster' that had slapped him in the face, and possibly put scratches down
his friend's back. We made our way back to the center of the cemetery where
there were no graves, just a patch of grass. We stood around and Steve told the
other two about the 'specter' he had seen and where he had seen it. Around that
time, Scott said, "lights out." He took a couple of pictures, and the
rest was silent. Then we turned our lights back on for a few seconds, before
Scott repeated his order of "lights out." This part gets a little
blurry, I can't remember if it was before or after we turned the lights back
on, but Scott is a BIG guy, wide and tall. He 'fell' backward onto Steve who
would have fallen on me had I not moved in time. He had fallen hard. He layed
there and just looked confused and his face was red. His glasses had flown off
on impact of the fall. He asked where his glasses were. Then he asked,
"Did I fall?" We tried to explain what had happened from each of our
perspectives quickly, as we were pretty freaked out since this was our first
experience. He asked a couple more times as the rest of us came to the
conclusion that he fell too hard to have just fallen from a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>loss of balance. I, for one, think he was
pushed by some force. Anyway, we got him up to his feet, he looked around, and
said "We're leaving." Scott was shaken, and that was all we needed to
hear. As we walked back to our cars to say closing prayer, Scott started
coughing, which progressed to dry heaving. We had eaten Hardee's before we went
to the first place, so we knew that he had something to throw up. We stopped to
wait for him, and after he felt better we proceeded to walk to a space between
the cars to say the prayer. Scott began, "Our Father which art in
heaven-" and was interrupted by more dry heaving. Steve said, "Scott,
are you okay?" He nodded and said, "Hallowed be thy-" and cut
off to dry heave some more. This time it was so bad that he lost his glasses
and was down on his knees coughing up something that wasn't there. He looked
up, straight at me, and gave the most evil glare I have ever seen. I immediately
recoiled in fear, with tears forming in my eyes, I asked "Scott? Scott,
are you there?" He got over this fit eventually as Steve said,
"Hallowed be thy what? Finish the prayer Scott. You have to finish
it." Scott straightened up a little and hoarsely started to finish,
"Hallowed be they name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth as it
is in Heaven." He had another small break for coughing. "Give us this
day our daily bread and forgive us our tresspasses--" "What Scott?"
"As we forgive those who tresspass against us" "And lead us not
into what? Scott, say it" "And lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us--" "Deliver us from what Scott?" "Deliver us
from evil" At this point Scott has regained his composure enough to
finish, and says, "For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,
for ever and ever. Amen" As we each followed with a thankful 'amen' he
said, "Now lets get the hell outta here!" I was ahead of him in
parking, so I started the car and drove out of the cemetery as fast as possible.
We stopped into a church parking lot up the road. Scott got out of his car and
we started talking about what had just happened. He claimed to have no
recollection of falling or anything after that. That's the story of what
happened in southwest Missouri on a late October night. May you form your own
conclusions, and I hope you enjoyed!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I have felt the presence of ghosts and some
places I have been or lived at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have
never had the experience of seeing a ghost but I can walk into a place and tell
if there is a ghost there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know if it
is a male, female or child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have seen
dark shadows but not all have been black.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some are gray like the color of a rat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One night a very good friend of mine came over and we were watching a
movie and eating pizza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw the dark
outline of a male child peeking around the corner of the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told my friend Dawn who is very religious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first she didn't believe me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept seeing the outline of a head and shoulders
peeking around the corner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then about 5
minutes or so later we started hearing a scratching noise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told Dawn that's the ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said it was just a mouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, I heard a loaf of bread fall on the
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bread is kept on the counter far
back next to the microwave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got up to
investigate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bread was laying on the
floor but had no holes in it from a mouse.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I put the bread back and went back into the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dawn got up to get a class of soda and when
she went in the kitchen she yelled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
said the loaf of bread moved across the counter and dropped on the floor at her
feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She started praying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every time she stopped praying you could hear
scratching noises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She kept praying and
the scratching continued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then it got
quiet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We finished the movie and as we
were talking we notice the lid on the pizza box which was propped up started to
slip down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of just falling down
it closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was very slowly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dawn said she had had enough and went
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She took the pizza and box home
with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She called me later that night
and said the ghost followed her home because her bread was constantly sliding
off the counter and she actually saw te pizza lid open when it was closed in
the box.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said she threw the bread
and pizza box off her balcony and prayed really hard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She didn't have any more problems and our
bread stayed on our counters after that. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">It was just this Summer. I was
up on the computer, trying to get over my parent's recent divorce. "1:45
AM" I muttered to myself, trying to hide tears. While staring at blank
chat rooms, I heard a voice. Small at first, the louder and louder.
"Maddy. Maddy. Maddy." It called to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I started breathing harder,
afraid to look away from my computer screen. Finally I did. Another,
frightened, girl just about my age looked back at me. She had shoulder length,
light hair, and was a transparent white. She smiled at me, mouthed "I understand."
And dissapeared. Frightened, I turned back to my computer before hearing a
single voice say "My names Jamie, by the way."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Jamie has kept her
appearances to a minimum but I still feel her presence. She has really made me
feel better.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">When I read your article on
Alcatraz, I had no idea that it was that haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But while reading the stories about 14-D,
something slipped into my stomach. I looked at my pictures of when I went, and
the room I felt a presence in was one of them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I took it upon exiting the room so I would remember which one it
was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought I would tell you about
it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">On a school trip to San
Francisco in 2007, we went to Alcatraz. I was really excited and had a great
time learning about it, even though it has an awful history. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">However, during the tour in
Block D and room 14 something felt strange.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We were taking pictures and going into the rooms for fun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody would go into the last one because
they claimed, "We'd been in others--its probably the same." I wanted
to go in because I had just barely caught up with my group and hadn't been in
the other cells yet. I convinced another girl to come in with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Smiling, thinking "This
is awesome!" I entered the dark cell.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After five steps, it got chillingly cold and I was wearing a
jacket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned to look at the door,
and it felt as though something was behind me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I turned to look at the corner the presence was coming from, it
intensified 100-fold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know how I
knew, but there was definitely something else in that cell with us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I think we should get out of
here," I said to my friend, even though she had barely entered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She took two more steps, looked into the
corner behind me and said, "Oh my god. Do you feel that?" That's when
I grabbed her hand and bolted out of the cell as fast as I could.When I asked
my friend, "What did you think?" She said, "I'm really freaked
out... None of the other cells were like that."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I was freaked out as well; we both held
onto each other for the next ten minutes because we were both shaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even remembering it now, I get the chills and
my heart races.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Guess it really is haunted!

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Where my daughter use to live there was always
hauntings in the basement. the house was built on an indian burial grounds, at
night she could not go down the basement at all. i had tried several times and
each time it was like an extreme push to make me leave. I felt very scared and
I am not a <span style="">&nbsp;</span>person who feels scared. My
grandma owned the house years ago and there were newspaper articles found in
the walls after her death tht showed she was <span style="">&nbsp;</span>part of the KKK in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Kentucky</st1:place></st1:State>. She was always a bitch to me, to put
it bluntly. My daughter was gone for 20 minutes in April and it was on what
would <span style="">&nbsp;</span>have been my grandmas birthday,
the house caught on fire. Her precious dog <span style="">&nbsp;</span>"King Leonidas" was in the house. My
daughter got the back door open, but the police would not let her go in to get
her boy. The fireman did not go through the door that was open. They kept
trying to get open the front door in which was barracated because her neighbor
kept coming over with his shotgun. King Leonidas died in the fire. It has still
not been determined what started the fire. Although 2 weeks before the house
was hit by lightning. The urge ruined her tv's and computer. The night of the
fire I went down the basement and there was no longer the feeling that
something or <span style="">&nbsp;</span>someone was pushing me and
I did not have any feelings of being scared. Even though I guess my body was
like in shock from losing King Leonidas I feel the spirits from the graves that
the house had been built on were at rest now. My mom who rented the house to my
daughter, only gave us 2 days to get everything out. Over half of my daughters
things=A0were still there. It <span style="">&nbsp;</span>was
impossible to get it in two days. My mom had the house leveled recently. I hope
the spirits are now haunting my moms house<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My grandfather was a member
of <st1:State w:st="on">washington</st1:State> county golf club in <st1:State w:st="on">washington</st1:State> county, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>.
The club house sits on top of a hill and used to be a very old farm house that
dates back to the 1800's. He told me stories of him along with a group of
friends spent the night at the club house. Members were allowed to stay there
if they wished. It was said the old farmer who lived in the house lost all of
his money and the farm went under. This happening the farm hung himself off the
staircase. My grandfather said that during the late hours of night you can hear
footsteps walking back and forth upstairs. They went upstairs and no one was to
be found. In the ball room lights and be seen turning off and on a well as
doors being opened and closed. I myself have been in the club house which is
very old with wooden stairs and floors. I have even seen the bar going across
the staircase where its said the farmer hung himself. I have heard this story
from other members of the club. Weather this is true for sure or not I do not
know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Another story I have heard
takes place in peters township in washignton county. I have been told by an old
football coach whos family lived in the town all their life dating by to the
1700's I believe. He tells a story of and old haunted railroad tunnel. Close to
hidden valley road in the area. Its said that many years ago when the railroad
was a busy place a man was hooking up two boxcars. The boxcars then rolled
together putting the man in between the two hook ups. The man was cut in half
from the two boxcars. Many people say they have walked the tunnel holding hands
across the tunnel very late in the night. They said they have seen a man
walking at the other end of the tunnel with an old oil lamp in his hand
swinging back and forth. They say a train can be heard off in the distance but
no train even came. This story has been known as "boxcar willy". I
have heard this story from many different people in the past. I have seen the
tunnel myself one night with 2 of my friends we held hands going across the
front of the tunnel. We all then saw a very small light at the end of the
tunnel. Never went to check it out but something was there. We all saw this
light it may have been something off in the distance but I believe it was
boxcar willy we all felt something very weird that night. Thats why I get the
feeling something was there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I hope you look into these
two stories for the fact that I know the truth of this as well. Stories are one
thing to me I like to know the truth if you might have any answers. Thanks for
taking the time to read these stories. I hope to hear something from you. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">This story happened in the
1940's. One summer evening my Granny Dawson sat on her front porch peeling
potatoes, trying to stay cool while she got things ready to cook supper for my
Grandpa who was working in the field that day. Granny had both the front door
and back door open only their screens where shut. Granny's heart jumped when
she suddenly heard the back screen door slam! she sat still and listened, and
this is what she heard, small foot steps walking in the house, like the pitter
patter of babies feet. Granny heard the foot steps wonder all around inside the
house going room to room, and finally she heard the back screen door slam
again! Granny gathered her nerves and opened the front screen to go in side,
slowly walking and looking around the house, when Granny reached the kitchen,
she dropped the bowl and knife she was carrying, because there in the kitchen
floor lay a pair of her own deceased baby boy's walking shoes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I live in a small town south
of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Columbus</st1:place></st1:City>,Oh.
I worked at a hardware store in another small town named Circleville,Oh. I
worked there for awhile but I noticed that one of the old warehouses that were
connected to the store always gave me the creeps. It was cold back there even
in the summer time. It got to a point where I did not like going back there by
myself. The other employees would laugh at me and make fun of me. But I knew
something was going on. Several times mechandise would just fly off the
shelves,I would hear these things hit the floor,go investigate and put the
items back on the shelf.My radio behind the counter would come unplugged by it
self.A key we had to unlock our gate outside disappeared,only to return a month
later. Things I would go and get for customers would be sitting there waiting
for me on the aisle floor. One of the guys that worked with me in that dept.
was a total skeptic. One day he and I were talking when something went flying
off of the shelf. It was heating and air filters. He said someone is back
there, I said no one is back there and have'nt been for quite sometime.The only
way someone could get back to that area is to pass our counter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We both walked back to the area to find a
whole section of these filters laying on the ground. I'm not an idiot,I know
that the way these filters sat on this shelf,there was no way that they could
have just fallen down by themselves. There was a lip on the shelf that was
about 6in. tall. So it had to have been lifted up and thrown down. I had been telling
this guy about the things that had been happening back there,and I asked him if
he believed me now. He just laughed and played it off. Another time an employee
was cutting gas pipe on the thread machine.This area of the store is employee
only area,and it's right next to the older warehouse,when he said that someone
started banging on the dock door. He said he thought it was one of us wanting
in or a delivery was being made,but deliverys were not generally done at this
door. When he opened the door no one was there. There are two bars that we had
to put in the dock door to keep it closed,a cheap security measure, after he
put these bars back,the bars went flying out by themselves. This guy would not
make up a story like that, I believed him and told him of the scary things that
had been happening to me since I worked there. I would every once in a while go
back to the old warehouse and stand by myself just to get the crap scared out
of me. I heard footsteps all the time,knowing no one else was back there. One
day I went back to get my daily scare and I became so dizzy and cold that I
almost went to my knees. I got sick also from the dizziness. After that I did
not go back there alone.To finish up this story I've saved the best for last. I
was outside dumping garbage in the dumpster. There was another dock door on
this side of the building,with an entry door next to it with a window. For some
reason I was compelled to look at the door, and staring right at me was the
face of a man. He was whitish grey in color,and he was wearing glasses. He
stood there for about 20 sec. and then kind of backed up and faded away. I
jumped with excitement because I knew that it was'nt anyone who worked there
and no one was back on the dock.This gave me assurance that all the things that
had been happening at this store was not just coincidence. My family lived in
several haunted houses,my family members have had experiences,I have had them
also,but not like this, so ghosts have been something I've always been
interested in. But that was the best experience I've ever had. Come to find out
after I talked to other employees, a few had seen the face in the door window.
It kind of pissed me off because they always laughed at me when I would tell
them of the strange happenings there. Another thing which I did'nt know about
til after my experience was about 15 yrs. ago an employee of that hardware
store died of a massive heart attack back in that warehouse that I did'nt like
going in. I asked one of the older employees if that man wore glasses? They
said yes he did !!! Needless to say I was very excited about that news because
I knew then for sure that I had seen this man's spirit. But it also saddened
me. To die at work and still be there unable to go on.So many things happened
at this store I could'nt possibly write all of them. This hardware store is on
S.Court st. Anyone who reads this and is from Circleville will probably know
this hardware store. Thanks for letting me tell my story, I love Shadowlands.
Please keep the stories coming!!! <o:p></o:p></span></p>
