<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My
Guardian Angel</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
T3809.Security@target.com&nbsp; </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I
have been reading all these great ghost stories and now I feel it is
safe to
share mine.&nbsp; First I need to give you a
lil back ground info so you can understand. I have been in the martial
arts
since I was 12 years old. When I was 14 I ment a Brazilian Jiu-jitsu
Black Belt
named Sensei Ruah. I learned BJJ under him and we became inseparable,
he was a
second father and mentor to me. Fast forward to early 2010 I was going
through
a very tough time in my life. It was February 23 when I got the
horrible news, he
had passed away in a car accident he had a brain aneurism and the
accident made
it bleed and he bleed to death. I was crushed my mentor and hero was
dead. To
make things worse I was two weeks away from my Black Belt ceremony.
Well the
day of the ceremony had finally came and as I was sitting in the back
room of
the gym alone when I felt a warming sensation all around me and a sense
of love
and security over came me. I thought nothing of it till I was accepting
my
black belt and I swear to you I saw sensei&nbsp;
Ruah standing in the doorway to the gym I looked away for a sec and
then
looked back and he was gone. I have also had a run in with him recently
as
well. I had been trying to find my place in the world recently because
of some
events that had befallen me. So after about a month or so of searching
I got no
answers. I slowly became depressed. At this time I was running a junior
mixed
martial arts team and it was one of the few things I took pride and
happiness
in. it was probably the end of march beginning of June when I went to
bed one
night in a very depressed mood because of&nbsp;
my day it was rather hard and unnerving. It was about two am when I got
this dream. I was drilling with my team in my gym and sensei rauh alive
and
well pulled me outside said he wanted to talk to me he said that he
dead and
gone now and he wanted me two carry on his teachings and the warrior.
Then I
woke up to see him standing there in the corner of my room in his Gl.
It was so
white and his skin so dark he was flawless and the room was filled with
a sense
of peace I have never felt before! He the bowed or saluted me and
disappeared.
Ever since the whenever I get nervous or scared or I am injured or sick
I can
feel his presence and I can often smell the smell of cologne to this
day. I
know he watches over me, and when I am alone I often feel a presence
with me. I
still compete in martial arts tournaments and when I put on my black
belt I can
feel his spirit engulf me and give me strength. Well that&#8217;s my story
believe it
or not cus I know its true.Thank you and god bless</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My

me tons
of her own ghost stories from when she was my age. But this one in

just stood out to me. Here it is in her own words.&nbsp; "When I was
your age, me and my sister
Nelly were sleeping one night in our twin beds. &nbsp;&nbsp;Everything
was normal I was dreaming, but
thats when I was freezing terribly, I woke to find a young red-headed
man standing
at the foot of my bed watching over me. I could tell what he looked
like by the
moon's light. I instantly awoke my sister Nelly, to tell her about the

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My
Experience at Margaritas Mexican Restaurant in Concord NH</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
kesenwine@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Around
a year ago, i went to have dinner at margaritas in concord NH; it was
my 14th
birthday and my sisters 17th birthday. As most people know, the
restaurant was
once a jail, and the jail cells are used for seating people. i was
sitting at
my table, back to the opening. I was talking to my dad and my sister
who were
sitting across from me. A dark shadow past behind them going to the
left, i
looked to my side where there was a window and there was no one there.
Later on
in the night when my father left to go to the bathroom, my sister and i
heard
what sounded like chains rattling, and a jail cell close. That was
un-expecting; I can&#8217;t wait to go there again.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My
1st Haunting</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
athenarusso@verizon.net</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>This
story was my first real experience with a ghost (Real meaning that I
saw
something not just &#8216;heard&#8217; something as I had many times in the past).&nbsp;
I am 34 years old now and will never forget
some of the horrific nights that I went through as a young child due to
the
hauntings in the two houses I lived in while growing up.&nbsp;&nbsp;
First you will need a little background&#8230;It
was in the house I was born in and lived in until I was around 7 years
old.&nbsp; The house was a huge two story
house (plus a basement &amp; attic).&nbsp; My
sister and I shared a bedroom and our bedroom was on the second floor,
and our
bedroom door was caddy-corner (sp?) to the door which led to the attic.&nbsp;
Practically every night we would hear
footsteps and things being moved upstairs &#8211; which scared us enough to
begin
with &#8211; but then the next phase began one night when I was around 5-6
years old.&nbsp; It was pretty late in the evening, everyone
(mom, dad, sis, &amp; me) had been asleep for a few hours, when I woke
up
thirsty and went downstairs to get a drink (which is a nightly
occurrence to
this day).&nbsp; I sat at the kitchen table
for a few minutes and drank my drink and then suddenly a chill ran up
my spine
and I knew that I was not alone.&nbsp; I
sprinted upstairs ran into my bedroom and threw my covers on. (Now
since like I
said before we would hear things at night &#8211; I would make my parents
keep their
and our doors open at night with the hall light on)&nbsp; After a few
minutes I felt safe again (I
lined my bed with teddy-bears &#8211; don&#8217;t ask me but for some reason I felt
safe
when I did that).&nbsp; Our beds faced
directly toward the door (so that the foot of our beds were closest to
the
door) and if lying in bed we could look out the door into the hallway.&nbsp;
I just closed my eyes to go to bed when all
of the sudden I felt that sensation (cold, prickly) and knew that
things were
not alright.&nbsp; I opened my eyes (this is
all within seconds) and standing in the doorway of our room was this
tall
shadow &#8211; I always consider this as a man &#8211; as it&#8217;s figure was that of a
mans.&nbsp; It was just standing there, legs
apart with a firm stance. The shadow looked as dark as black wet ink,
not
transparent at all.&nbsp; I closed my eyes
again pretending that if &#8216;it&#8217; thought I was sleeping it would go away
and not
harm me.&nbsp; I then peeked out a few seconds
later and &#8216;it&#8217; was standing at the foot of my bed &#8211; with &#8216;its&#8217; head
tilted to
the side a bit.&nbsp; This whole time I tried
to yell for help &#8211; but words and sound escaped me &#8211; I was paralyzed
with
fear.&nbsp; I closed my eyes again and felt
something pressing against the bottom of my bed right next to my feet &#8211;
I
opened my eyes WIDE and saw this figure with its hands pressing down by
my feet
and his body leaning over the bed.&nbsp; I
remember my mouth was wide open (me trying to scream) and finally I let
out
this wrenching, blood curdling scream (which started out really hoarse
and
raspy but then led to shrieking).&nbsp; The
next thing that happened only must&#8217;ve been in the time span of about 2
seconds
&#8211; but at the time and every time I replay it in my head it was like in
slow
motion &#8211; was the figure pulling away from my bed, turning around and
walking to
the door and getting ready to turn to go towards the attic door, but
before
leaving my room it turned around toward me and pausing to &#8216;glare&#8217; at me
&#8211; the
glare was so penetrating I can still feel the feeling I felt that night
right
here typing this.&nbsp; Like I said it was
only seconds but it felt like &#8216;It&#8217; stopped to glare at me for about 5
minutes.&nbsp; Of course my parents were running down the
hallway to see what was wrong by then and I told them what had just
happened,
they told me it was just a "nightmare".&nbsp; While we were living in
this house all the
neighborhood kids would tell me that my house was haunted and that
someone had
died there.&nbsp; My parents, of course,
denied this at the time.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t until
a few years after we moved that I was told that a teenager had indeed
killed
himself upstairs in the attic by hanging himself.&nbsp; I verified this
with the next door neighbor
when I was older.&nbsp; I believe the
footsteps we would hear were those of him walking up the attic stairs
at night
and pacing the attic.&nbsp; I also believe
that he was possibly the one at my feet that evening.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Monticello
- Charlottesville</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apaforu@gmail.com
</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I
visited Monticello a few years ago and had a very interesting encounter
while
there.&nbsp; I am one of those people who are
sensitive to ghosts and I KNOW when a place is haunted.&nbsp; I was
taking the guided tour of the home when
we came to Thomas Jefferson's bedroom.&nbsp; I
immediately knew someone else was there.&nbsp;
I stayed behind and said loudly, "Ok, I know you're here make
yourself known", nothing.&nbsp; I leaned
over to peer into a glass case that held his spectacles and as I did,
my hair
lifted on the left side and I felt as if someone had just blown in my
ear!&nbsp; I got the impression that he has laughing at
me but it was enough for me to get out of that room.&nbsp; I later
contacted management and they denied
that they had ever heard of Monticello being haunted by Jefferson.&nbsp;
But I think he is still hanging out and
following the tours around.&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Challenge</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:pawrestler2387@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Three
of my friends and I did the melonhead challenge last night. It&#8217;s when
you get
left on velvet drive aka Dracula drive for ten minutes and then picked
up
again.&nbsp; There are no lights on this
street and only two houses and the street is over 2 miles long.&nbsp;
So my friend dropped us off and drove away
and everything was fine for the first minute.&nbsp;
We all were looking a different direction to cover the whole are, then
I
saw a dim green light and the appearance of a man behind it then it
disappeared, then it was three feet closer. I thought it was just my
eyes
adjusting to the light.&nbsp; But all of a
sudden the human shape was less than 3 feet in front of me. Is stepped
forward
and swung as hard as I could and my hand stopped as I hit whatever it
was in
the face and it disappeared into thin air, but I felt something when I
hit it.
Out of the corner of my eye I saw another humanish shape start to
charge at me
from the other side and I screamed </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&#8220;what
the f**k?!&#8221; And the other guy I was with turned and we saw it running
away the
two girls started screaming and they huddled in between us.&nbsp; This
is when I called the kid that dropped us
off and he was bugging out because no one had ever heard me actually
afraid so
he started to turn around.&nbsp; We saw a car
coming towards us and we thought it was him so we ran to it and it
turned out
to be 5 girls. We tried to get in before we say them inside and they
didn&#8217;t
react at all. The one was just like &#8220;uhh what are you doing?&#8221;&nbsp; and
she&#8217;s the only ne that would even look at
us it was creepy as hell.&nbsp; The one
driving said &#8220; we gotta go people are coming &#8220; and I turned and looked
and said
&#8220;there&#8217;s no one on the road?&#8221; she said &#8220;there will be soon were leaving
before
it happens.&#8221;&nbsp; And that&#8217;s when our friend
pulled up and we high tailed it outta there.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Klamath
Falls - Old OIT on Old Fort Rd.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
mwilcox81@gmail.com </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I
will let you know that I am a sceptic on ghosts/scary tales. But what I
experienced there really scared me , Of course there has to be a reason
for
what I've seen and heard there. I was 15 at the time, pretty new still
to
K.Falls and one night on Halloween&nbsp; my
friends and I decide to drive up there , just to try and get someone
scared . I
thought I could let the legend die with my none beliefs of the
paranormal, but
that night sitting there in the car no one was talking you could here
people
almost chanting , the windows to the building looked like rust was
dripping
from the corners of almost each window . My non beliefs were not
helping me
stay calm . when you sit there you get goose bumps all over your body
that no
warmth will take away, I told my friend we need to go ,&nbsp; but
before we&nbsp;
were clear&nbsp; we drove down just a
little and stopped, one of my friend got out and put baby powder on the
back
bumper of the car&nbsp; , I asked why&nbsp; and they replied just wait
and see . we put
the car in neutral and was at a dead stop , there is a hill that you
have to
drive over to move away from the Old OIT. We were sitting there and I
said lets
go ! just then the car started moving on its own&nbsp; I checked out my
friends feet to make sure
they weren't pressing the gas no, but also I would have heard the
engine .We gained
speed before going over the hill .&nbsp; when
we were just over my friend pulled over and told me to look at the
bumper,
there were signs&nbsp; that little hands
touched it . you could see the prints in the baby powder . Now I still
don't
believe in all the nonsense but I couldn't explain that night. Also
just to let
you know&nbsp; that rust colored drippings off
the sides of the windows were&nbsp; not there
the next day also.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ghost
Experience</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
trenton6754@aol.com </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>About
a few years back my niece, who was 18 at the time, came over to stay at
my
house because her family had moved further north and she wanted to
finish
school where she started.&nbsp; Anyways, about
a couple weeks after she initially arrived it was around 2 am and we
were both
sound asleep.&nbsp; When suddenly multiple
doors all slammed at once.&nbsp; I instantly
jumped up and shook it off considering it might be the wind since I did
have my
window open.&nbsp; The next day around the
same time I was on the computer paying some bills when suddenly out of
nowhere
a DVD flew off the shelf about 10 feet or so behind me.&nbsp;
Considering there was no other person in the
room I quickly finished paying the bills and went straight to bed.&nbsp;
An hour or so later I'm dead asleep when all
of a sudden I hear humming, thinking it's my niece I wake up and see a
lady in
a white gown in the hallway staring at me.&nbsp;
I start asking her(thinking it's my niece) if somethings wrong.&nbsp; I
rub my eyes because I was tired and right
after, the lady was gone.&nbsp; I checked my
niece's room and completely freaked out when I saw she was asleep in a
completely different outfit.&nbsp; I ran
downstairs and called the police thinking someone had broken into my
house and
might still be in here.&nbsp; The police had
arrived and saw no forced entry and all the windows and doors still had
their
locks intact.&nbsp; I quickly started
researching this problem and concluded I was dealing with an
ectoplasmic
ghost.&nbsp; Fearful for my life and fearful I
had no other options I stood in the hallway and pleaded with the spirit
to
please leave me at peace and to not attempt to kill me.&nbsp; After
this breakdown everything stopped
besides the occasional banging on the wall.&nbsp;
As my niece left I yelled at the spirit to cross over or to leave me in
peace.&nbsp; The spirit left me in peace and
followed my niece like it originally did.&nbsp;
I hope to never experience anything like that ever again.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Home
with a History</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mmlsang@shaw.ca</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I
grew up in a city in southern Ontario, and I have had several
encounters with
paranormal activity.&nbsp; When I was eight
years old, my mother and my brother had moved into a single family home
that
was attached in the front to a store for clothing alterations and such.&nbsp;
The home was built in the 1930s and I was
unaware as what the history of the home was.&nbsp;
However, there was always the strong feeling on the back of my neck
that
I was being watched in a way that made me feel horrid and vulnerable.&nbsp;
There were certain parts of the house that
felt more 'evil' than the whole house felt.&nbsp;
The first part was the stairs going to the basement and the upstairs
bathroom made my stomach turn.&nbsp; I always
felt 'eyes' of anger on my neck.&nbsp; My
little brother, who was 6 years old at the time, and I were
roller-blading in
the basement that was not developed enough to be a problem with the
rollerblades.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a separate room
in the corner that had a glass paned door, and we had never gone into
that room
as it just really creeped us out.&nbsp; We
both very suddenly stopped bladding and both looked to the lass paned
window and
we both had seen a clear apparition of an older man who had the evil
look in
his eyes just like we always felt looking at the back of our necks.&nbsp;
We ran upstairs with the blades on to tell
our mom.&nbsp; She refused to go look as she
had then admitted to having the same fear in the home.&nbsp; We did
move out within six months as it
seemed to be getting worse with things going missing, and my barbey
dolls doing
missing for weeks and then re-showing itself mutilated.&nbsp; It was
just felt horrid to be there for all
of us.&nbsp; As an adult I had shared that
story with a woman that I had met and she knew exactly which house I
had spoke
of.&nbsp; I showed her the exact home and she
said that the house had been a funeral parlor.&nbsp;
The house was evil, and I could never go into it again!!!</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Stories
from Down Under</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By&nbsp; cam.sha@bigpond.com </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Being
a ghost tours operator and investigator for many years now I have had
many
scary experiences but the strangest so far happened ,not in some dark
abandoned
gaol but in my own home. It happened about 5 yrs ago now. I was sitting
reading
a magazine in the family room by myself. Everything was as normal, TV
giving me
some background company, kids in their rooms and hubby doing whatever
hubby&#8217;s
do.&nbsp; Then out of the corner of my eye I
saw movement. I looked up and saw it was my husband going into my
stepson&#8217;s
room. Nothing weird about that so I looked down again and continued
reading my
magazine. Just as I started to read again my stepson came out of his
room .I
looked up and said to him &#8220; what&#8217;s dad doing in your room &#8220;?.&#8221; Dad&#8217;s
not in my
room&#8217;, was his reply! As he saw my look of puzzlement I explained to
him what I
had seen. Just then my husband came in the front door!! He had been
outside the
entire time having a cigarette!!&nbsp; I have
no explanation for this.&nbsp; &nbsp;I clearly saw my husband as he
reached to open
my stepson&#8217;s room door. He had the same clothing on, same hair, same
everything!&nbsp; About 2 months after this I
was in my sons room folding clothes. My son was 8 yrs old at the time
of the
experience I am about to tell you.&nbsp; He
and his sister, 10 at the time, were out in the backyard playing. My
son was on
the trampoline showing off to big sister. He then saw his Dad watching
him
through the kitchen window so he showed off a few more tricks even
getting a
couple of waves from Dad for his efforts.&nbsp;
They both then decided to come in, Dad was still at the window as they
turned the corner to come in the backdoor.My son went straight to the
kitchen
for a drink and chat to Dad wanting to hear what he thought of his
tricks. Dad
wasn&#8217;t there. He then called for him and came to his bedroom where I
was still
doing his clothes.&nbsp; He asked me where Dad
was. I then informed him Dad was in bed as he had a late shift. &nbsp;He
was so disbelieving that I had to take him
to our room , at the other end of the house , and show him Dad was very
much
sound asleep , snoring and all !Neither my husband nor I can explain
these
incidents and I would very much love to hear from anyone who can.We
even
thought maybe it was my husbands Dad making a ghostly appearance but
that
doesn&#8217;t explain the same clothes ect when I saw him.&nbsp; We never
told any of the children about my
experience so as not to scare them. We have also experienced a few
other
strange occurrences in this house but these 2 are the weirdest.&nbsp;
Ghost hunts Australia.</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>MONTE
CRISTO HOMESTEAD</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Said
to be the most haunted house in Australia Monte cristo , literally
mount of
Christ , was built by the wealthy Crawley family in 1884/5 as a status
symbol
for newly acquired wealth.The ghost of Mrs Crawley is seen as well as
mysterious lights ,&nbsp; full body
apparitions , cold spots and disembodied voices.. The regular ghost
tours there
have captured photographic evidence of strange mists and shadows.&nbsp;
</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>HITCH
HIKER TO NOWHERE&#8230;</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Australia
also has it&#8217;s own version of the hitch hiker story made famous by the
actor
Telly Savalas many years ago.&nbsp; In New
South Wales the highway to Byron Bay is said to be haunted by a young
hippy
woman who stands at the side of the road hitching a ride.&nbsp; When
picked up she directs the driver further
down the road and then..Disappears.&nbsp; </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>PICTON
TUNNELS.&nbsp; Picton tunnels in New South
Wales are another location at the top of the ghost hunters lists. The
abandoned
rail tunnels, used more than 100 years ago, are now the scene of
regular
paranormal occurrences.&nbsp; A young lady who
was run over by a train in the tunnels still lingers at the sight and
is seen
and felt often.&nbsp; Many have experienced
lights/orbs , shadows and sudden gusts of wind. The ghost of a girl who
hung
herself in the tunnels entrance is seen and heard crying. </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>PORT
ARTHUR TASMANIA&nbsp; </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A
famous location for all the wrong reasons in recent times Port Arthur
was the
scene of one of Australia&#8217;s worst mass murders. But the old convict
site has a
long history of violence so it&#8217;s not surprising that many a ghost still
lingers.&nbsp; Witnesses have seen full body
apparitions; bells are heard ringing, cold spots and feelings of being
followed
and watched are all regular occurrences here. It is rare to take a
photo at
Port Arthur and NOT get something unexplainable in the frame. Well,
this is
just a few of the hauntings&nbsp; we have here
, and very brief for you. Hope you enjoyed them .</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I
have been to Church Road with a group of my friends, it is haunted,
where the
house used to be(has been torn down) the temperature will change about
ten to
twenty degrees. we tried to test the ghost so we put my friends jeep in
neutral
and was pushed uphill by something. The red eyes are true and if you
walk
outside your car he will follow behind you. we also had handprints down
the
side of our vehicle. We went out there every night for a week and
experienced
something everynight.&nbsp; I have lived in
hillsdale county all my life and my family lives right down the road
from the
Cemetary on Burt rd. The truth, Its haunted, I have never seen the sign
change,
but i will agree that the people who are buried there are not at rest,
there
are a lot of people who died there of murder,suicide and accidents. I
have seen
people walking through there at night and you just get a very uneasy
feeling
about the whole place. &nbsp;&nbsp;You also have to
remember that right behind the cemetary is a gravel pit where a woman
drowned
while swimming out there with her friends.&nbsp;
I love to ghost hunt and i have seen spirits since i was little, i also
know that the one on church rd is not a nice man, i have watched him
make one
of the people that were in my car very sick and she didnt get better
until we
got off the rd. The legend is that you have to enter from holcomb rd
and you
have to exit from holcomb rd, if you dont he will follow you home, we
tried
that one night and he didnt follow us home, but something did, because
we woke
up to a little girl singing every day till we went back, once we went
back and
entered right and exited right, the little girl was gone. i havent been
out
there in years but am planning to go back there in a few weeks to see
if things
have changed since they started building a house on the old foundation
where the
house used to be.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It
was the Fall of 1972, and I was 10 years old when this happened to me.
I was
lying in my bedroom one night, awake, my sister's talking in their room
next
door at the end of the hall. My parents were watching a tv program down
the
other end of the hall in the livingroom. Well, out of nowhere, a pair
of hands
grabbed my ankles and pulled me straight out of bed and I landed flat
on my
back against the hardwood floor. My parents immediately yelled, "What's
going on back there?" I yelled back, "Nothing, just fell out of
bed." They laughed, and so did my sisters.&nbsp;
I never told anyone this for years, for fear that someone would think I
was crazy, or that they would make fun of me, or, it would cause "that
thing" to do even more stuff to me. Nothing else ever happened like
that
to me again, but I have always wondered what it was that pulled me out
of bed
that night.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hi
- I wanted others to hear this....just to relate... I know about a
ghost from
my travels in the forest --- in the Santa Monica Mountains in CA. A
very
restless spirit who has revealed himself to be Ghost Pirate Jack.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>He
seems to want help from me...I've talked to other campers in the area
who have
seen him and he seems to try to be leading us to something.I want to
help him.
He doesn't seem dangerous but I am also scared. I see a flash of a bit
of light
and feel a cold blast of air. But sometimes I just hear him.Thank you
for
understanding and I hope you get to post my experience.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ghost
in My Grandmother's House</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fossilhund@aol.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I
have been a fan of Shadowlands for years, so here is one of my stories.&nbsp;
When I was young my Dad's Mother and her
second husband (not my Grandfather) lived in a 1920s vintage flat top
stucco
house in West Orlando. &nbsp;&nbsp;My brother and I
both spent nights over there.&nbsp; The room
in which we would sleep had a bed that was, from a four year old's
perspective,
about midchest high. I remember, when I was about four years old,
walking into
that room one day and seeing this white haired lady in the bed. I
remember she
had dark eyes and a prominent curved nose with large nostrils. I
remember that
she and I looked at one another. She seemed to want something from me,
but I
didn't know what that could be. She was not either malevolent nor
cuddly like
my Grandmother. She seemed to me to be a business like person who, when
she
wanted something, didn't hesitate to ask the nearest person around to
help; in
other words, a matter of fact person.I believe at that point I turned
and left
the room.&nbsp; To the best of my knowledge my
Grandmother never had anyone like this stay in her house.As I got
older, I
remember my Mother talking &nbsp;&nbsp;about my
Step-Grandfather's Mother who had lived with them for some time. During
one of
these conversations I said that I remembered her, thinking of the older
lady I
had seen in that &nbsp;bed.&nbsp; My Mother said there was no way I
could
remember her, since she died before I was born.I never brought this up
with
Mother again, and &nbsp;since then my Mother
has passed.I still can't help but wonder who that older lady was.</big></p>

Comfort</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fossilhund@aol.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I
have one last story (for now) to tell you.I was born in 1955, so I went
to high
school starting in 1970. Needless to say the fashion and hair styles I
liked
were very different from those with which my Mother was used to. We
frequently
had clashes over these things.&nbsp; Also,
from the get go of my life I had always been interested in things like
camping,
fishing, hiking and nature in general. My Mother, to say the least, was
disappointed because she had always envisioned having a daughter who
was
interested in clothes, makeup and flirting with boys; I just wasn't the
daughter she had wanted.&nbsp; I ended up
working in Forensics for years, and I do believe she was proud of me
during the
last twenty years of her life.&nbsp; The year
and a half after my Father took his life and she died were filled with
sadness for
us both.&nbsp; Looking back, if I had known
then what I know now I would have done things differently, but that is
Monday
morning quarterbacking.&nbsp; I did the best I
could to care for us both during that time, but I feel I could have
done
better, and I regretted it after she passed on.&nbsp;
One night, not too many months after she died I dreamed of her as she
appeared in a black and white photo taken of her as a young woman.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Framing this photo, in my dream, were white
and red lacy strands, as in a Valentine's day card.&nbsp; As I viewed
this picture in my dream I heard
her tell me "I love you". Her voice radiated nothing but one hundred
per cent love. It was as she were saying to me, I know we had our
differences
when I was there with you, but I can see things so much more clearly
from where
I am now and so I want to tell you now I Love You. This was a very
intense
dream and I do believe it was a message from my Mother. The memory of
this
dream has been a great comfort to me.</big></p>
