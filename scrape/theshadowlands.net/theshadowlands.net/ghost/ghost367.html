<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Ghost Story???<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Im not really sure
if this is a ghost story or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
serving in the Royal Navy about 2 years ago, i was asleep in what we call
gulches, which means bed space, the bed spaces were in groups of six, which
consisted of 2 rows of three beds in a bunk system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was asleep and suddenly awoke, i slept on
the top bunk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldnt feel the bed and
was pressed against the ceiling of the gulch with the various wires and pipes<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that kept my ship running, pressing softly at
my face, for some reason i was floating.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">This was the first
time and only time it ever happend, and up until that point i was a total non
believer in anything like this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Does anyone out
there have any explanations for this.?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">A girl named Wendy<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My name is LouAnn. I
am 19 years old and live in a little redneck town, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="">Va.</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style=""> I live with my grandparents and have lived
all my life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom was 14 and in the
8th grade. My mom had a very best friend named, Wendy who was 13. They did
everything together. Soon after our house was built,Wndy's parents were not
getting along and were going through seperation and divorce procedures. Wendy
and her mother had to move to </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="">Woodbridge</span></st1:City><span style="">, </span><st1:State><span style="">Va.</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style=""> soon. During the time of the separation, Wendy spent a great deal at my
mom's newly built house. They spent much of their time in my mom's room, which
is now my room. Then came the time for Wendy and her mom to move. It was very
early one morning. Wendy was in the back of the van holding a glass coffee
table steady (this was in the days before seatbelt laws). There was a drunk
driver on the road and hit the van head on. Everyone made it out with semi
serious or minor injuries, but not Wendy. The corner of the glass coffee table
hit her in the head and killed her instantly. Years later, in 1985, a week
before my mom found out she was pregnant with me, she was in the family room
talking to my grandparents about going on birth control. My grandmother, and my
uncle both caught a glimpse of a girl standing behind my mother shaking her
head, and after that one 2 second glimpse she was gone. My uncle and
grandmother agree it looked like Wendy. We believe that she was shaking her
head because she knew my mom was pregnant and didn't want her to go on birth
control. Ever since then, everyone in my family has caught a glimpse of her in
our house. I have even seen her. Because my room used to be my mom's room, she
is in my room most of the time. I feel her present in there a lot. When I am
upset no matter where I am in the house, I can feel her there, but it is a
comforting feeling, not weird eerie feeling. No one has seen her until my mom
became pregnant. My family believes that she was sent to watch over her best
friend's daughter. Everything I told you is true, and I was wondering if I
could have my house investigated to make sure it IS Wendy, or if me and my
family are going crazy. If it is Wendy, I would like to communicate with her.
Please send me an e-mail psykosexy@aol.com thank you for reading my story. ps. our
house was built in 1979 (that is so it correlates w/ the beginning of the
story.) and I also have pictures of me from when I was a baby and on, where
there is an orb or fog or some kind of light near me and none of us can figure
out where they come from. They are in every single picture taken of me at my
house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I submitted a few
stories a few years back so if I repeat any of them sorry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">This happend to my
cousin and I in late '02 in a ranch style house my family and I used to live
in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My cousin woke up in the middle of
the night to my voice or so she thought it was my voice, she looked at me and I
was sound asleep and not talking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also
that night actually it was probably 4 or 5 in the morning I felt someone
pecking on my knee and it wasn't my cousin because she was sound asleep so I
just thought it was my imagination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
we were eating that morning my cousin told me what she had heard I freaked
because I knew that whatever had pecked on my knee was not my imagination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing was ever actually seen in this house
that I know of, but a lot of things were felt and heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few months after that incident my cousin
was staying the night again everyone in the house had been asleep for atleast 2
to 3 hours, but my cousin being addicted to the Sims was still on the
computer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she was shutting down the
computer she heard voices coming from the hallway directly to her right she
looked down there and saw nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
voices she heard she knew were not any or ours so she ran to the floor where
she had made her bed an covered her head up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I guess the voices must of stopped after that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A lot of times I would hear cabinates shut,
dishes clank together, and other odd unexplanable noices. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>One night my brother got home from a friends
house around 1 or 2 in the morning I had been asleep on the couch in the
livingroom for atleast 4 hours and my parants had been asleep in their room for
about the same amount of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As my
brother got out of his car he looked toward the door that went directly into
the livingroom from the outside it had a little window on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could see the light from the tv that i
always left on at night, but he also saw a black figure looking at him from
inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He ran in the house and seen I
was on the couch sound asleep then he went into my parants room and asked if
they had been up and they hadn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
is scary is that thing was in the same room with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next night I slept on the couch again, do
not ask me why, <span style="">&nbsp;</span>my brother was not home
yet and my parants had went to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was watching tv and I got kind of uneasy so I layed down and covered up my
head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After awhile I heard the glasses
in the kitchen sink clanking together I started to sweat then I felt as if something
was coming into the livingroom, where I was, when my brother arrives home and
the noises stop I got up and looked at the dishes in the sink and none of them
had been moved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">About 14 years ago
we moved into a house that was built in the 1950's I believe that used to be a
boarding home and was right in front of a cemetary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were lots of noices heard there as well
as a few spirits seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember
staying home one day from school and my mom was asleep because she worked
nights and I heard a voice say my name it scared me because we were the only
ones home and it was a voice I had never heard before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom would be home during the day by
herself while my brother and I were at school and she would hear a music box
playing, at the time we had m ic boxes, but they did not play the song she
heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom would be sleeping on the
couch and she would hear footsteps coming through the kitchen which was right
next to the livingroom where she was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One time when that happened she grabbed her shoes and didn't come back
till we got out of school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also
would be sleeping in her bed and it would start shaking this also happened to
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shed in this house was directly
behind my parents bedroom because their bedroom used to be the garage well
anyways my mom would be lying on her bed and she would hear someone or
something walking in there the odd thing was it sounded like boots on wood, but
the floor in there was concrete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had
a little dog out there at the time, but there is no way it could of sounded
like that when it walked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night my
mom, dad, brother, and I were all sleeping in my room because we put the air
conditoner in there in the summer well anyways it was a cool night so they had
turned the air off and left the door opened my mom for some reason looked at
the doorway and felt as if there was a presence there she just put her face
into my dads back and went to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
next day she found out her dad had died who lived in Kansas and hadn't been found
for a few days, she believes that it was him in the doorway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brother saw a ghostly head in his bedroom
one night it was in a mist and was bald on top with hair around the edges of
his head we believe it was my great grandpa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">This happened at my
grandmas house on </span><st1:date year="2004" day="2" month="9"><span style="">September 2, 2004</span></st1:date><span style=""> it was my grandmas birthday and my mom, my
little cousin, and I went there to have cake and ice cream, well my little
cousin decides she wants a miracle whip sandwich.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She pressed up against the door frame asking
my grandma if she can have a sandwich when all of a sudden she looks towards
the micorwave in the kitchen and screams, drops the jar, and runs to the couch
where my grandma is and my little is crying hysterically.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were all like what just happened?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For some reason I became very cold and get
goose bumps and had the urge to sit up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My little cousin wouldn't tell us what she saw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandma tried to tell us it was a mouse or
a bug, but I highly doubt it because she wouldn't of acted like she did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandma believes in ghost, but I think she
said that to make herself feel better because she knew she was going to be
there alone when we left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My little
cousin I believe has forgotten about the incident so I still do not know what
happend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other things have happened at
the grandmas like something kicking her bed very hardly one night and she also
seen the spirit of young girl dressed in white one day while lying on her couch
in her livingroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She seen a shadow
like figure outside her window which she knows wasn't a human because her cat
started hissing and acting weird and there's probably been other things that
happed that I do not know about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I don't believe I've
actually ever seen a spirit, but I know I've felt them because in certain
places or sometimes when I talk about spirits the back of my neck starts to
hurt and feels weird and sometimes my head will start hurting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I have so many more
stories to share with you, but I will send them at a later time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you have any questions about my stories or
would like me to send you some more of my stories please feel free to contact
me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">This story happend
about 2 years ago. My moms dad Peter died when she was like 6 years old. So she
never really got to know him and naturally I didnt know him. One night my friend
Mandy was staying the night at my house. We had been planning to shaving cream
my brother that night because he had gotten us twice before and we were looking
for revenge. LOL Both our rooms are upstairs with the stairs in the middle of
them. About 2am Mandy and I got up to do the deed. I told Mandy to go
downstairs and get the shaving cream. I stayed in my room and waited. She
walked out the door then came back in a few seconds later and said "Josh
is standing at the bottom of the staris and he seen me!" I opened my door
and looked across at Josh's room and seen him laying in his bed. I told Mandy.
"</span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="">Ur</span></st1:City></st1:place><span style=""> seeing things, look his still sleeping"
She was like then "Who's at the bottom of the stairs." I looked
around the corner and down the stairs and there was a man standing there. He
was there just stairing at us. He didnt seem angry nor happy. But he didnt seem
to be a threat. He looked slightly fimilar but I couldnt place a name. But I
could see where Mandy thought it was Josh becasue I could see some resemblence.
I looked at Mandy and said "Get back into bed because I dont know who that
is!" When she looked around the corner and down the stairs she whispered
"He's gone". When I looked again...sure enough he was gone. The next
morning my mom was going through some pictures and putting them in frames.
Mandy picked up my grandparents wedding picture and nearly fainted. I asked her
what was wrong and she showed me the picture. I hadnt seen the picture in years
and the man we had seen the prevouis night had been my grandpa!! We told my mom
about what appened and she was shocked. But she belived us that we had seen my
grandpas ghost. About 2 weeks later Mandy was staying the night at my house
again. I belived we had a ghost that opened our cabinets, he opened and shut
windows, pushed buttons on the micorwave and things like that. Me, her and my
brother were in the kitchen getting ready to pop some popcorn when i shut the
door on the microwave, it started before I pushed any buttons. Mandy flipped
out but I told her that was just another ghost. She asked his name. I told her
I hadnt named him yet. She told me too. All of a sudden the name Jonathan came
to me. So thats what I named him. That night her and my family (mom,
dad,brother,me) were sitting in the living room when our front door opened.
Mandy asked what happened and I was like "oh that was just Jonathan
again" My mother looked at me and said "what did u just call
him??!!" I was like "Jonathan" She said "why did you name
him that?" I was like "I dont know. Jonathan just popped into my
mind." Dad asked my mom wha the big deal was about the name Jonathan. She
looked at me and asked if i knew who Jonathan was. I was dumbfounded and said
No. She told me that Jonathan was my great grandpa! I thought it was neat. So
now we belive that not only is my grandpa ghost here but my great grandpa!
Thanks for your time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My cousin and I were
out in Glenpool, towards the boondocks where my grandparents used to live,
watching t.v. late at night. We weren't really tired, hyped up on caffien from
pepsi and sprite, just hanging out and trying to see how long we could go
without passing out to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">At first, I thought
I was just hearing things, or my cousin was being a jerk and screwing around. But
the louder the sound got, and closer, that's when we both turned the volume
down to turn to each other and ask the same question, "was that you? Did
you hear that?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Of course, it was
like a scratching, shuffling sound outside, and we both dismissed it thinking
that perhaps it was the family pets or wild animal, since the house was out in
the middle of nowhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Instead, curiousity
got the better of us. I suggested that maybe it was bigfoot or a ghost, and she
promptly crawled towards the window for a peek.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">She didn't say
anything, standing still like if she moved something would see her. I started
to talk, but she silenced me with the wave of her hand. When I got over to the
glass, i stared off into the black yard expecting to see a deer or something.
Instead, what i saw was a... thing.(best word used to discribe it)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">It was all black,
nearly invisible in the shadows it clung too. The only way we were able to see
it at all was due to a distant light pole. It was skittering around, it's back
turned to use... for the moment. I guess the dogs must have felt the tension in
the air, because at that moment they all went into wild barks at the intruder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">It swung it's
head(or what seemed like a head) towards the sound, then up to the window we
both watched it from. There was nothing there, no face, nothing at all.
Needless to say, both of us were terrorfied to see a hooded, faceless figure
staring back at us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">It disappeared,
melting into the shadows. The dogs yipped, dashing for cover. Both me and my
cousin were cold, shocked, afraid, and speechless.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">We don't know what
it was looking for in our yard, or what it was at all. I used to believe it was
a person thinking on robbing our house, or at least i tell myself that so i
don't get so freaked. Though the truth seems a lot creepier, it is still the
truth, and neither i nor my cousin can deny that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The year was 1991. I
was a newlywed and living with my husband's cousin saving for a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">place of our own.
Since I was the new kid in the house I pretty much didn't have a say<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">who could visit our
home. One such visitor was a girl who had wanted to date my husband<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">and had been turned
down by him. After her visit I started having strange things happened to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">me. At the time I
didn't associated one thing with the other and never did. After he left every
morning about four each morning I would wake to find someone next to me I could
never see its face or body. It started pulling my sheets off me, pushing the
bed, or trying to slap me. I was terrified, but I wouldn't mention it to
anybody in fear of not being believed or viewed as crazy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I started saying the rosary each time my
husband left and mostly tried to stay awake (hey if I didn't sleep it couldn't
bother me). Nothing worked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We finally
moved out to our own apartment. Nothing would bother me at all even when I was
alone at the apartment. I was happy once again and didn't give it a second
thought. Fate would play a cruel joke on me. Within a couple of months we ended
moving into a duplex next to the same girl. Things started happening again only
more violent. The thing would lay next to me I could always see the sheets move
up and down like someone was breathing. I could never see an actual face or
body, but felt the presence. I started throwing up often, having constant
headaches was just plain sick. I finally spoke to my husband and he just said
it was all in my head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started praying
and crying every morning after he left. Once again I prayed the rosary I even
tried wearing the rosary on my wrist. It would fall off and once again nothing
worked. We had constant fights and I kept getting sick (my husband thought I
was pregnant, not so). On one of our fights I decided to walk across the street
to another of his cousin's house to cool down. She told me I looked sick and
just plain bad. I started crying and told her everything that was happening and
she believed me. She called her mother to come and go thru some ritual at my
home. She lighted a white candle and started praying the Lord's Creed three
times. Next, she place a blessed palm from Palm Sunday mass she made a cross
with it and placed it above my bed. I don't know whether it was coincidence or
what, but every thing stop. I'm happy to say that dreadful girl left shortly.
The subject was never spoken about much less remembered that was until we took
a trip to Mexico years after. My husband and I had come to know and love a
curandero. I had never spoken to him about my experience, I just didn't
believed in witchcraft, these things just didn't happen or exist. I finally
told him and asked his opinion in the presence of my husband. He looked at me
straight in the eye and told me voodoo had been performed on me. My husband
asked why hadn't she gone after him and he said they always go for the weaker
of mind. He took me into his area of work where statues of saints, candles and
a pentagram was drawn he only showed me the area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I can honestly say I
was frighten at this, but sat down nevertheless. He told that my problem was
that husband was not convince or believe in any of this. I still get chills
remembering the room and this conversation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My husband and I still debate to this day that this really happened. I
on the other hand know it really happened and truly believed that anything and
everything is possible involving the supernatural.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">When I was eleven
years old, at about three o clock in the morning I woke up to hear the sound of
my dad plowing our driveway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He soon
left for work, and I couldn't fall back asleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After all was quiet I got out of my bunk bed and climbed down my stairs
and walked<span style="">&nbsp; </span>into the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to the bathroom and then back to my
room. I climbed into bed and crawled over toward my pillow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then that I turned around and was
about to pull my blankets over me when I noticed two bright green lights in the
corner of my room directly in front of me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were glowing and hovering in the same spot I just walked through.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was confused and tried to think of all the
possible things they could be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Smoke
alarm light?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Glow in the dark plastic
stars?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anything!? I started to get more
scared as the time passed because i tried to eliminate the fact that it could
be a spirit. I tried to figure out if it was my eyes playing tricks on me...perhaps
i saw the lights from a clock and my eyes just needed to adjust to the
darkness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I d n't turn any lights on
while I got up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I blinked my eyes in a
different spot on my wall and tried to see if the lights would follow my
eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They didn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this point I looked back to the spot and
there they were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was so scared. They
were eyes, and they were staring at me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I was so
scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't move at all I was
laying down resting on my elbows just staring at them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They moved foward a foot or so, very
slowly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then they moved back and just as
slowly vanished to the left through my wall.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was so scared they would come back.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">riverdale road has a
lot more than just that certain place by 132nd. riverdale road is spooky
throughout the entire road. it's weird, sometimes the road stretches and
shrinks. (the bad side of the road actually starts on 104th (</span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="">northglenn</span></st1:City></st1:place><span style="">) and goes all the way to end at highway 7
(boulder) ) but anyway....from 104th to highway 7 is approximately 13-15 miles.
I was paying attention to the mileage and I was going about 35-40 the entire
time. I started at 104th and by the time I got to highway 7 I had only gone 9
miles, when I turned around to go back the other way towards 104th again, when
I got there I went 16 miles. Now tell me that isn't creepy, if you pay REAL
close attention to the road you can almost see it stretching.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">There's also this
turn called dead mans Curve, it's a real sharp turn the recommended speed is 25
but easily done at 40...there's a cement block wall bordering one side of the
turn. If you turn that corner around 2:30 a.m. you will see a woman in the
middle of the road holding her hands up, waving for you to stop. But when I went
around that corner I didn't have time to stop because she's like right there
after you do a half 90 degree turn. I ended up hitting her, I got out of my car
and looked all around, absolutely no one was around but there were hand prints
on the hood of the car.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Also, heh, if you
turn onto riverdale from 112th, and turn left there will be a huge line of
trees on either side and it just looks like a dark cave of trees, and there is
a very mean jogger spirit that 'hitch hikes' and joggs around there. my sister
and I were driving around on that road and went through that little cave of
trees, and she said she first got a glimpse of the light on his shoes (on the
left side going away from 104th) and as you get closer you can see that it's a
person and he was holding out his hand for hitch hiking, then all of a sudden
knelt down in the running position, and as soon as we got close enough he
jetted out in front of us. my sister said there guts and blood and body parts
all over on the windsheild, and she blinked and it was all gone. she said as
soon as he knelt down getting ready to run, she saw that his face was just a
skull and his hand was bones.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So yeah
heh it's not just that spot right by 132nd, there are millions of ghost/spirit
stories for that road believe me!! I've gone up and down that road billions of
times. I used to do it about 5-7 times a day for about a year so I know that
road pretty well<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mandypandy7384@hotmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I moved to </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="">Overland Park</span></st1:City><span style="">, </span><st1:State><span style="">Kansas</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style=""> during my sixth grade year along with my mother, step-father, and
brother. The five story house we lived in was in a new neighborhood, and I
never took the time to research the land on which our neighborhood was built.
Of course, I didn't know what experiences I would find myself in throughout the
next few years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My night routines
consisted mostly of sitting in the "sunroom" on the fourth floor that
looked towards the hallway leading to the two bedrooms, a bathroom, linen
closet, and the staircase which led to the master bedroom while reading
whatever book I had at hand. I can't recall how long it had been since my
family and I moved into the house; however, I remember this night clearly. My
parents went out to eat, and I stayed behind at home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was curled into the corner of a sofa that
sat in front of a set of windows reading Guardian by </span><st1:PersonName><span style="">John</span></st1:PersonName><span style=""> Saul. The first incident happened well after
the night sky had darkened. I was concentrating heavily on my book when I began
to hear a knocking coming from outside. It sounded almost exactly like someone
hammering on the side of the house. Looking up from my book, I turned and
looked outside to see who could be outside at such a time; however, I couldn't
see anyone. So I turned around and made myself comfortable to engross myself in
my book. Again, the banging continued and the most effort I put into looking
out the window again was angling my head and looking out of the corner of my
eye. After a few minutes the sound outside stopped...only to begin inside. This
time it sounded as if someone was banging a hammer on a pipe in the basement
three floors below. The banging was four or five short clangs, and then
silence. I'd raise my book again until I was interrupted by another round of
clangs. The only thing I could do was try my best to ignore it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">As I continued to
read, I experienced this unnerving feeling of being watched. I tried to
reposition myself on the couch, shifting my legs from underneath me and
stretching out, but nothing would unshake the presence. I finally settled on
propping my feet on the table in front of me and resting the book on my knees.
It was then where I could see in my peripheral vision a man standing on the top
step of the staircase leading to my parent's bedroom. He stood in complete
black, perfectly still, and watched. When I looked directly at him he
disappeared. I figured all the noises and the man I saw were a result of
reading the book, and because of this conclusion I refused to look up at the
staircase again regardless of the fact that the man was still there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I never spoke of the
clanging or the man once my parents came home because I figured it was my
imagination. My parents were arguing when they came home anyway, so I tried my
best not to get in their way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Most of my time was
spent in my room when there were others in the house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">You could blame it
on adolescence and wanting to be by myself. It was there in my room where
another strange incident occurred. I had my radio cranked to the highest
decibel and was "rocking out" when I heard a knock on my door.
Turning down the radio, I rushed to the door and opened it to find no one
standing outside. I shrugged, thinking I was hearing noises due to the loud
radio, closed the door, and cranked the radio back up again. A few minutes
later I heard the knocking again, but this time instead of turning down the
radio I opened the door while the radio blared. Again, no one stood at my door.
I walked into the bathroom which was immediately to my right and checked behind
the drawn shower curtain because my mother would love to hide and jump out
behind me as I walked down the hallway. Well...she wasn't going to get me this
time...only she wasn't behind the curtain. I walked down the entire hallway,
checking the kitchen and bedrooms before going to my parents bedroom. It, too,
was empty. So I high-tailed it to my bedroom, shut the door, and sat on my bed.
I figured whoever wanted to come in would so I no longer answered the knocks.
Whoever it was knocked twice more, and then stopped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Months passed and
the knockings continued and the man stood on the top step of the stair case.
After awhile I became used to it, but I never mentioned it to anyone in my
house. I always figured it was my mind playing tricks on me. Eventually the
sounds and the man disappeared, and I never experienced them again. Until years
laters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My mother and I were
standing on the back porch one night while she smoked a cigarette. No one was
allowed to smoke inside because my younger brother was an asthmatic. While she
smoked she mentioned, "I see people in this house." <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I casually looked at
her and replied, "You too?" I can't quite remember the look on her
face, but the sound of her voice distinguished her fear. She told me that she
continuously saw three people standing on the stair case leading to her bedroom,
only the people she saw were dressed in white. She said that the people she saw
stood on the stairs day and night, whereas the person I saw was dressed in
black and only stood at the top of the stairs at night. She told me of a night
when she was smoking in the garage and she heard a knocking on the door.
Figuring it was her husband, she knocked back in return. Moments later another
knock, and she returned it. And again. And again. Until the door opened, and
her husband asked why she was knocking on the door. Her answer was,
"Because you were knocking." He informed her that he had been
downstairs watching television.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">A year or so after
she and I shared our experiences, my mother, brother, and I moved out of the
house and into an apartment across the street from the neighborhood. My mother
and her husband were seperated, but he continuously stayed at our apartment
anyway. One night my mother decided to drive back to the house to feed our dog
that we left behind at the house, while my step-father was inside our apartment
sleeping. I remained behind as well, sitting outside on the back patio. My
mother was gone for ten or fifteen minutes before rushing back through the
front door. The hairs on her arm were standing on edge and she couldn't seem to
collect her thoughts. She finally asked, "Do you think I'm crazy?" I
laughed and asked why. She<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">explained: While the
dog was eating out in the garage, she had gone inside to close the blinds in
the formal living room. While her back was the rest of the room, she heard a
distant voice saying "Get out of the house". She said she shook it
off and walked up to the "sunroom" to close more blinds, where she
again heard "Get out of the house". Finally, while closing the blinds
in the kitchen, she said that the voice was so close that she ran out of the
house without closing the remaining blinds, jerked the dog into the garage, and
sped back to the apartment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">A year later we
moved to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Georgia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> where there have been no experiences in any of the houses we've resided
in. I've been debating with myself as to why she and I would see people
standing on the same stair case and if their different clothing represented
anything, maybe because that's where most of my parents fights would take
place, or what was trying to get our attention by knocking on the walls. What I
do know is that now that my mother is no longer married to the same man, we
haven't experienced anything of the like since.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My Son has a Knack<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">By:
magzland@tampabay.rr.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I&#8217;ve always felt
that my son (my firstborn) has had a particular awareness about him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know we all cherish our children, and know
that they are special and gifted in some way&#8230;but something about his presence
and how others react to him has always been quite remarkable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The awareness I mentioned, is not only in regards
to how he interprets living beings, but I&#8217;m pretty convinced that it&#8217;s more
than that &#8211; that he can connect with more than just the visceral world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is currently 4 years old.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The first set of
significant experiences that made me raise an eyebrow or two was when he was
about 15 months old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were living on
the west coast, but then were called back east because of a death in our
extended family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband couldn&#8217;t get
off of work, so we traveled without him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I wasn&#8217;t quite sure how I would handle my baby at a large, conservative,
Catholic funeral (the faith and culture of the deceased, but not of our own),
but what was important was that we were there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the funeral home, the tone, was, as expected, somber and silent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But my son seemed to understand that this was
not a place for frolicking, and was surprisingly respectful of the
situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, there were a few
moments of giggles and laughter &#8211; when prompted by others who joined us, but
for the most part his behaviour was appropriate for the time. At one point, he
approached the casket, stood up on the small kneeling step, and stretched up
high on his toes trying to see the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It brought a smile to some faces there and he came back over to me where
I sat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked at me and said &#8220;Okay,
Mommy, Okay&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I assumed at the time, it
was his method of comfort of some type &#8211; he was only 15 months old and perhaps
he heard it from around the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
mourners approached the casket he watched them, yet seemed to be watching
someone else, just behind them all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
my stepmother and the husband of the deceased kneeled at the casket, my son
joined them, put his hands on their backs and said, &#8220;okay&#8230;okay&#8221;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">He made it through
the funeral at the church with a demeanor impressive of any adult &#8211; which took
me by surprise and much to my relief.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was a simple church, and the power of the moment, I suppose made an
impression on him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He fell asleep on the
way to the cemetery, and slept through the internment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rest of the day went on as usual.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The next day I
returned to the cemetery to visit some graves of some other relatives that I
had not been to in a very, very long time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The cemetery is absolutely beautiful &#8211; so diligently cared for, and a
lovely place for repose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s quite vast
and isolated, so I gave my son the run of the place as I searched for the
markers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he skipped through the grass
he would stop sometimes and say &#8220;Hi!&#8221; and then move on, rolling down a hill,
thumping himself down and giggling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
stopped a few times before he finally came upon the marker of my
great-grandmother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grave that I had
yet to find.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He put his hand on the
stone and just smiled at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
speechless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Through the months
(as he&#8217;s not really old enough yet to refer to time in years), he&#8217;s demonstrated
some behavior akin to felines&#8230;when people joke that they are speaking with
fairies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just little moments few and far
between where it seems as though he&#8217;s connecting to something &#8211; sometimes with
words, sometimes not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then you tap him
on the shoulder and he comes back and moves on with life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I spoke with his pediatrician about it, and
there seems to be no cause for concern &#8211; not that I really was, but it made my
mother feel better.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">But tonight really
made me catch my breath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went out to
dinner at a new restaurant down the road a bit from our home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(We&#8217;re in a new development in what was rural
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="">Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="">, so everything is a &#8220;bit down the road&#8221;, but
development is encroaching bit by bit every day).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband had come in a separate car and he left
as such and took our daughter with him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We needed to pick up some milk so we stopped at the 7-11 which is
adjacent, got out, got back in the car and went on our merry way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But before I pulled out of the driveway and
into the street he said, &#8220;Over there, Mama, over there &#8211; look at the ghosts!&#8221;, <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">and I replied,
&#8220;Where, honey?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&#8220;Over THERE&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">As I was driving and
he was behind me I couldn&#8217;t see to where he was pointing, so I asked, &#8220;Outside
the car?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&#8220;No, inside the
car,&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&#8220;In the car?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&#8220;Yes, Mommy, next to
you.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&#8220;Is it one ghost or
more?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&#8220;Two&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&#8220;Can you tell me
what they look like?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Man?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Woman?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&#8220;Both.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But they&#8217;re little ghosts &#8211; a boy and a
girl&#8230;&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&#8220;Are they sad?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are they happy?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&#8220;They&#8217;re sad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both of them are very sad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And they&#8217;re right there, Mommy, and sad.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I continued on down
the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I turned into the
entrance of the development he said, &#8220;they&#8217;re gone now Mommy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ghosts are gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They&#8217;re aren&#8217;t any ghosts in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="">Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style=""> (he thinks our development is </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="">Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style=""> &#8211; and hasn&#8217;t quite yet grasped the concept
that </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="">Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style=""> is a state and how big it is).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">What made the
experience so remarkable was that just last week, our community experienced the
loss of a middle-school age boy who shot himself, and a kindergarten age girl
who died suddenly of, as yet, unexplained causes&#8230;in the parking lot of the 7-11
in her mother&#8217;s arms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far as I am
aware, he does not know about these events &#8211; he was not with me when I found
out about them, nor have I discussed it around him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I suppose it is possible that he may have
heard something at pre-school&#8230;but the events are so recent&#8230;I don&#8217;t know, it
seems like a stretch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four-year olds are
not that prone to gossip as of yet &#8211; though I suppose the teachers may have
discussed it just as news among themselves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">So that&#8217;s it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There&#8217;s my experience as of late, or rather,
my son&#8217;s.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Splendor of Light&#8230;his name
means, as it turns out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t even
realize it at the time &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t part of the process of putting his name
together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But coincidentally, my
daughter&#8217;s name means the same thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
suppose that&#8217; neither here nor there, but it was a realization I made just a
few months ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the name of the town
we now live in seems derived from Litha, - which I just found out about last
week &#8211; the whole light and life abundant, the Sun God reaching the peak of his
strength.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A town that we decided to move
to, on a complete lark, in the middle of nowhere (at the time), 3,000 miles
away from a place we adored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again,
maybe all of that means nothing&#8230;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">But there it all is
for what it&#8217;s worth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just wanted to
put it all out there &#8211; to perhaps someone of an open mind who might at least
respect the story&#8230;thanks for your time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

one night after we heard some stories about it. We got to </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="">Crawford Road</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style=""> and as soon as we entered the area were all
of the activity happens we started hearing noises. The first one I noticed
sounded like someone whistling. It started off in the distance and as we got
closer to the bridge the whistling got closer. Another experiance I have had,
we stopped undr the bridge and stood there for a few minutes. One of my friends
was standing in the side of the road and something walked up behind him and I
took a picture after he ran behind me and I got a picture of a Face. It was
like it was standing right in front of me. Another time we took a video camera
out there and we filmed all the way down the road. We got some pretty
interesting stuff on the video camera. The first thing we noticed was a tree
that had a branch sticking out a little bit, there looked like there was
someone hanging on the branch from a rope around their neck. As we got closer
to that tree it dissappeared. We drove on a litte way and then we noticed
someone standing on the side of the road, as we got closer to them they started
running towards the woods and before they got into the woods they dissappeared.
We drove on a little ways and we noticed someone standing against a tree, this
person was wearing a full KKK outfit, as we got closer it dissappeared. As we
got towards the end we noticed a house back in the woods that was on fire, as
we got closer to the house we noticed a face that was bigger than the house and
it looked like an evil face, As we right up on the house we noticed that there
were people in the house and the face was there laughing, It dissapeared as
soon as we passed the house it dissappeared. Me and another friend went down
there one night and we parked under the bridge and stayed there for about 10
minutes, My frie cut his car off and put it in Neutral. As we sat there the car
started rolling up a hill that was there, We drove off and went to a 7-11 that
was right by </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="">Crawford Road</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="">. When we got to the store we got out and looked at the car and we
noticed hands prints on the back of the car like someone had pushed the car. We
decided to go back to see if it would happen again. We were there for 10
minutes again and the car stared rolling up the hill again. We drove off again
and went back to the store. As we got out of the car we noticed more hand
prints all over the car. There were little foot prints on the sun roof, there
we finger prints on the passanger side window, there were scratch marks by the
door handle on the passanger as if something was trying to get into the car.
Another time me and a few friends decide to walk down Crawford Road, As we were
walking there were sounds off in the woods as if someone was following us, we
heard sticks breaking and then there a sound as if they were carrying a chain,
it sounded as if they were dragging this chain behind them, As we got closer to
the bridge, at the top of the bridge there looked as if there were people on
the bridge standing there watching us. Me and my friend walked on top of the
bridge to see if anyone was there and there was no one, there was no footprints
except for the ones we made walking around up there, (It was raining when we
went that night, so if someone would have been up on the bridge they would have
left footprints). We stood under tis bridge for a few minutes and we heard a
sound like someone was crying, we looked around to see if it was anyone that
was with us and it wasn't, we walked around to see if someone had been hurt and
we found nothing. As we followed the cries we were taken further into the
woods, We all started getting a very bad feeling so we turned back and went
home. These all of the things that I have experienced on </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="">Crawford Road</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="">. Please write me back if you think any of
tis stuff is good enought to put on your website or any other website you might
suggest to post this on. Thank you<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I love reading the
stories that are told on here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have
had several years of experiencing things myself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">When i was about 13
i moved into a house in eastern MO north of st.louis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was built on an old settlement
called Clark Springs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the first
actual settlement in that area and the particular spot my house was built on
was "base camp". This is just some basic information about the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was built in the 1960s
brand new. I knew the first occupants personally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I attribute the occurances to the land, not
the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Several common
things happened through out the years. Whoever or whatever it was it loved to
mess with the air conditioning system.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the summer the heat would get turned on up to 90 degrees, or in the
winter the a.c would get turned on below 60.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No one in their right mind would do this and this happened often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would just fix it and go on our way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">For about a year, i
would see a fog floating in the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was hazy and you could see it day or night, never really knew when
you would see it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I also saw
people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would walk up behind me and
stand there and i would turn to speak to them and theyd disappear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a usual occurance. Sometimes this
bothered me a lot, sometimes it didnt. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Ive had more than
this but i just thought id send the basics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I've read many of
the stories here. They have made me think about my own experiences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I've had what we
call paranormal experiences my whole life that I can remember. I never thought
of these things as unusual. I thought that everyone saw or experienced things
like this. Many members of my family have experienced the paranormal, ghost
sightings, things moving apparently at their own will, creepy feelings about
our Grandfather's stairs in his house. Hands grabbing at them as they descend
the stairs..etc. I get dizzy and feel lost in certain places or around old
antique items... sometimes they make me sick to my stomach because the feeling
is so unusual..kind of wobbly. Can't describe it. It's like being dropped or
falling. It tickles, but not in a fun way. I visited </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="">Gettysburg</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style=""> when I was a small child and I became ill
and so did my mother. I did'nt think much of it until we went to a certain
place. It was the devils rock or some name close..I don't remember the name. I
just remember the man in a grey uniform who told me to get away from there
because it wasn't safe. He told me to get away soon, Or I would be dead. I
rember his face so clearly. He was dark blonde on his head but had a slight red
beard. I dont know if what I experience was a true ghost phenomenon or just
pure imagination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Hello. The following
story is what happened to me as the second time at the </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="">Gudgeonville</span></st1:PlaceName><span style=""> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="">Bridge</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="">. I went with a group- My sister, Christa,
her boyfriend, Scott, his friend, Terry, and his girlfriend, Sam. It was about </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="12"><span style="">12:30-1:00</span></st1:time><span style=""> at night on </span><st1:date year="2005" day="23" month="9"><span style="">September 23rd, 2005</span></st1:date><span style="">. It was a half-moon on that night as well. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">We first were all
psyched that we were all going to experience the Gudgeonville bridge at nightime,
a first for all of us. The entire party of us all had the uneasy feeling of it.
Arriving at the bridge, we all get out, and get used to the entrance. We take a
couple pictures and such. Then, a car strolled past us. The car was going
rather fast but it slowed down when it saw us. There was then a strange yell
from the car at us, kinda like a couple of college guys just screwing around.
None of us saw the driver's faces or outlines of the body. All I captured was
the headlights and the backlights. Meanwhile, once the car has past us, we
resume taking pictures and walking across the bridge. The entire bridge is now
covered in graphiti. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">All of us then past
the bridge, but Christa started going back-I joined her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">We get to the end of
the bridge, and a car comes driving once again. I then noticed it was the same
type of headlights and backlights as the car when we just gotten to the bridge
past us. After that, we all then jump back into the car, I take the last
pictures of the entrance and the cliff in the back. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">None of us reported
any signs of ghosts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">After we left the
bridge, we see a pleasant, fully grown deer on the street. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Everyone looked, and
the street was close to the I-90 highway. Just then, we see a speeding car
come, swirve, then hits the deer head on, and the deer basically
"flew" across the street onto the side. There was a great splatter of
blood. Unfortunatley, the deer wasn't dead, it was suffering. The car that hit
the deer stopped, and then reversed back. I then take notice that it was the
exact same type of headlights and backlights as the two other cars when we were
at the Bridge. The driver of the car was an older man, with white hair and a
white beard and mustache. Christa got out of the car an approched him, but he
never acknowledged that we were there. He never looked at us, he never glanced
at us, he never talked to us. We decided just to leave as the girls started
getting (more) scared.As I look back at that car, I notice that there was a
bright, white light in the backseat of the car that hit the deer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Could possibly are
the deer and all the car incidents intertwined? Many of us leave it as that
question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Also, Christa had
told me about a premonition she had before we went on the trip. She told me
that she saw a splatter of blood, and that she would also drop the car keys.
After the incident, we saw a splatter of blood from the deer, and when she got
into the car, she dropped her keys. Could this possibly have anything to do
with the hauntings of the Gudgeonville bridge?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I like your site
very much AND, if I may, I would like to tell you of a first-hand experience of
mine that took place approximately 40 years ago. One night, when I was about 10
years old, I was sitting in my living room late one night watching TV when a
movement behind me (This would have been in my kitchen area) was caught out of
the corner of my eye. When I turned to see what had caught my attention I was
immediately transfixed by the image of a person walking through my kitchen
area. I continued to watch as he walked the length of the room and then just
kind of vanished once he reached the other end of my kitchen. I had the great
fortune to witness what all ghost enthusiasts refer to as the "HOLY
GRAIL" of hauntings, ie, a full body image of a ghost. What i saw was what
I would describe as a male figure, height of approx. 5' 9" to 6 feet and
of medium build. And what I found very interesting was that he walked as if he
were "Marching" millitary style and his eyes were always transfixed
directly to the front of him. And if I might add an interesting footnote; years
later after we had moved out of that house I was talking to my mother and
mentioned my ghostly encounter and to my amazement my mother told me of several
personal encounters she had with what I believe to be the same ghost. My mother
liked to sleep with the door to her room opened and she told me that on more
then one occasion she woke to see a figure standing in the doorway of her room.
And what really blew me away was when she described her visitor she gave the
same description, almost word for word, as the person I witnessed in my kitchen
late one night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I hope you enjoyed
my story AND please believe me when I say that it is one hundred percent TRUE.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>i have sent these stories into your haunted
places section but here is a little more detailed description and acouple of my
experiences. Well my school has many stories of how it is haunted. The most
known ones in the school are the haunted gyms and underground pool. There are
two gyms, the A and C building gyms. In A building Gym you can supposedly hear
basket balls dribbeling when the lights are out. Though i havent experienced
anything from my school the head Janitor has told me and my friends a story.
Well i was in orchestra and we were having competitions between the other
schools with their orchestras. well you had to get a job to help out and keep
everything in order. since it was later in the day the head janitor was on the
job and one of my orchestra friends came up to us with the head janitor and
asked if we wanted to go to the underground school tunnels (yes our school has
underground tunnels for those of you who dont believe it). Well anyway we went
to the tunnels and since they were kinda spooky we were asking him if he had
experienced anything. he told us of a story with the C building gym. he was
working there at night and when done cleaning the gym and turned the lights
out. but he came back and the lights were back on. so he turned them out again.
but again he came back and they were back on. by now he was getting frustrated
b/c he wanted to leave and before he left the school he yelled into the gym
"OK enough joking around turn these lights out and keep them out" and
left the lights on. He then told us that as he was leaving the lights were
tunred off. There are also stories of a dog that was let into the halls as a
senior prank and was kil d. so it now haunts the halls. there is also the story
of the schools underground pool being haunted by a student that died in the
pool. i have never seen the pools and ive been told they dont exist so im not
sure if its true. but now i have my own eperiences. when i was young me and my
mother lived in an apartment complex. i used to be going to sleep and i would
look and see a figure of a man walking into the room and just stand there. i
dont know if it was my imagenation or not but i have never ever experienced
this since then. but oddly enough my best friend knew the people that lived
there when me and my mother moved out. they would tell me how the girl that
moved into my apartment with her parents would have things moved around and
things would float. i thought this was weird seeing as i never told ANYONE
about my experiences so they couldnt be making it up just to make me scared.
but now that i am older and still live in the same area i have noticed that the
apartment i lived in has now been quarentined. no one is living there even
though the apartments are still up. coincidence? i dont know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I'm kind of a off
and on sleeper at night. Some times i'm out like a light, others i wake up to
fall back to sleep. It's weird, but that's just how it is. One night, when i
was visiting from college, i new it was late... or early, depending on how you
want to see it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I know i wasn't
dreaming, and i'll even swear on a bible too. I was snuggling back into my
blankets, trying to tell my brain that it's not time to get up so be quiet and
go to sleep, when something touched me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">In the begining, i
thought that maybe it was just the covers, or my grandma checking in on me
since she's a night owl and stays up to watch the news. But no one was hovering
over my shoulder. Not a soul. So obviusly, i brushed the notion aside and shut
my eyes. That's when i couldn't deny what ever it was up against me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I had been moved
from the edge of the bed to the middle, feeling something pressed against my
back. It had one arm thrown around my waist, hugging me close. It was definatly
a guy. At first, i held myself perfectly still, trying to sort this out
logically. But the longer i stayed in that stiff position, knowing i was awake
and NOT dreaming, the scarier it became.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The person breathed
onto my neck, then, when i was about to kick and scream, they kissed me on the
nape. I bolted up, scanning my room for any sign of an intruder. I found no
one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">When i told my mom,
she just tries to tell me i was dreaming. What ever it was, it didn't appear to
be threatening. I stayed one more night at my grandparents, but it didn't
happen again. I like to think that maybe it was a ghost welcoming me home. Why
do strange things always seem to happen to me? I'm starting to think that maybe
I'M haunted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">My husband and I
went there to help his daughter and son-in-law move out after they had
experienced many odd things there. Water turning on by itself in the bathrooms,
footsteps when nobody was there and numerous times when they felt they were not
alone or heard sounds when they were alone. They were so scared they asked for
help in moving. My husband went in with our son-in-law and when he came out he
had a story to tell of his own. On the first floor he looked down a long
hallway and it was completely pitch dark, suddenly it was like the darkness
itself moved and he felt some kind of presence rush up to him and weight on his
chest as if something was pressed hard against him, he could feel a presence
and it was not a good one. He looked past his chest and the hallway was lit at
the other end as if something had been blocking the light and wasnt there
anymore. He said the presence was there for a minute or two and he felt it
leave. They quickly gathered all the belongings and left. My husband is not a
big tale kinda guy and after he came out of there he told me what had happened
and every hair on his arms stood on end while he told me ,he then burnt every
piece of clothing he had on while he was in the academy. He said he didnt want
anything to do with anything that had ever touched or been there it scared him
so badly.While he was inside my daughter-in-law and I saw several movements on
the grounds outside we would see movement and yet nothing was there.Many people
I know have talked about t footsteps and doors shutting, lights on and off when
nobody was there. One couple had<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>visitors, two priests that proceeded to sit on the edge of their bed and
curse them for being there. Too many stories to tell about this place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">my son has worked
for several security firms here in town and he has stories that would curl your
hair - for example - the Fire and Casuality building at the corner of 2nd str
and 2 ave has<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a bad feeling to it at
night -my son refused to work patrol in that building after one night - he said
lots of ghosts- he and I both get these feelings - I later heard rumors that
there had been shootings in that building and several people had died - in the
Armstrongs Center- in the basement - you may be followed by the "ghost
security"--you ll never see his face - just tell him that it s ok and you
can handle it and thank him and he will disappear- if you curse at him or get
angry he will strike you and has struck a woman -going down the stairs to the
basement you will here tapping ( there was a fellow trapped and killed under
the big freezers that used to be there for the resturant that no longer is
there- if you tell Frank that help is on the way the tapping stops - if you
tell him to go to the light the tapping gets frantic and louder - also once in
the basement you may feel a little tug on your sleeve and as you look down you
find a little boy who asks if you have seen his ball-you look at your watch -
it s2:30-AM and when you look back - he s gone --also there is an older part of
the basement that my son would not enter at all -- he said he felt nearly
paralized with fear going anywhere near the door<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and only even tried to get the door opened
once and had to leave - there is also a huanted office building out near
Hiawatha - will have to ask him which on it is - I think it is the old Parson s
building- some one tries to force open the door- and you can see their face
thru the window -but a security guard standing outside could see no one - just
the door moving- and my son was talking to him on a cell phone and watching the
security camera and watching the face inside -- later my son- when he asked
about that tape was told that in their line of business stuff like this was
just erased and they don t talk about it - also when in that building late at
night you can hear papers rustling in empty offices and there is a woman who
walks up and down halls and she was also on the camera as my son would see her
on the camera and go to see who had gotten in to the building and no one was
there- I worked at the MCI building for many years and there are cold spots
there -and sometimes -- well - just weird feelings - I know it usesd to be a bank
-below the old roosevelt hotel there is an old pool and health club - long
abandoned and vandalized - I know I don t like to be alone in what is referred
to as "the dungeon"- it was something in it s day -- mexican tile and
a beautiful pool with separate weight rooms and dressing rooms- but it is now a
dark and eerie place- have been in the basement of what used to be the Killians
building - don t think it s haunted - but the echos and the feeling is

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I had the chance to
go and visit Witches Pond in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="">Stafford</span></st1:City><span style="">, </span><st1:State><span style="">Virginia</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The place is definetly
creepy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was night time, and I was
with a friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was very dark, and
amung entering I had a weird sensation that I didnt want to be there, and I
dont scare easily.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Anyways, we passed
by the pond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We kept hearing noises, but
didnt let it get to us much.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just after
the pond, there is a small trail that leads to the old graveyard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As you look at the trail, the trees right
around all lean over top the trail, making it look as if there is a cathedral
like look to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was creepy.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">As you walk along
that trail, there is water to each side.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>About an inch of water flows over the trail, so while you walk down to
the graveyard, it seems as if you are walking on water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we got down to the graveyard, we looked
around and tryed to figure a way in.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">We heard a loud
shreik off in the far distance, and we kept hearing it, each time closer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We decided we overstayed our visit, and we
headed out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On our way out we took
pics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stood next to the pond snapping
pics and we heard the screams again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
thought it was an animal and decided to stay clsoe to the entrance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something came changing in through the
woods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We could hear the leaves and
sticks russling, but no footsteps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
hauled ass out of the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once we
were a ways back on the road, we looked back up at the place and saw something
dart across the street into the woods.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It really had no figure to it, it was just a dark shade.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">It is the coolest
looking place I have ever been, it was like something straight from a Nightmare
on </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="">Elm
  Street</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style=""> movie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its unbelieveable, but I
will never return to that place again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
feel as if I brought something out with me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">When i was about 16,
i went to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">france</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> with my class. It was fun, and the history lesson was great. But the
best part wasn't at the tower or arc de triumph, it was when my tour bus
stopped at this hotel. I can't really remember what it was called, since it was
in French, but I do rememeber it was dripping with ghost stories.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">It had once been a
lord's castle, and during a war the young lord enevitably betrayed his friend
to the king.(since the friend was apart of a rebel group)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The young lord felt
so guitly and grief stricken he had sent his best friend to the guillaten, he
pretty much grieved himself to death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I thought that was
interesting, but on with what happened when i checked in. I was staying in a
room, on the third floor with about three other girls. When we first arrived, i
explored a little of the rooms open to tourists. I'm an artist so naturaly i
wiped out a sketch book and began to draw a detailed statue placed in one of
the sitting area's.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I sat down on a
sette near the window, working like i was possessed, when a presence soon fell
over my shoulder. I looked up to see a very... *clears throat* handsome man. He
had dark hair, ice blue eyes, and was just genuinly good looking.(yes, even
four years later i still remember)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">He smiled at me,
then studied the picture. He must have liked it, sitting next to me and going
on and on in French. Needless to say i don't speak it, so i had no idea what he
was saying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">When he stopped,
expecting me to respond, i was very blunt, "I didn't understand a word you
just said. But keep talking, the words sound pretty."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">He only gave a
chesire smirk, switching to English(thank God) and asked how my stay was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">"I just got
here, but it's very nice so far."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The guy commented on
how he liked my drawing, so i decided to give it to him.(since i can always
make another.) Before i could rip it out, one of my roommates came in. When i
looked up, the guy had vanished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Okay, i was a little
freaked, but didn't tell anyone that day. Later that night, i heard the door to
our room squeak open. Since i was closest to the door, i just turned over and
squinted out to see who was coming in. My roommates were all in bed, and i
didn't know anyone else, besides the manager and maids, to have a key to our
room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">It was that guy
again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">He smiled brightly
at me, then blew a good night kiss and vanished. The door locked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The next morning,
when i was getting my things together to leave, i noticed that the statue
sketch was missing. When i asked the desk about it, they just kind of looked at
me like i was crazy, then asked ME if the man who checked in on me last night
blew me a kiss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">At first, i was
furious to think the staff was playing pranks on it's customers. But the guy
assured me that the man was none other than the lord himself bidding me a good
night. (He apparently had a thing for flirting with the women that came to stay
in his castle. And he never missed an oppertunity to make sure all his guest's
were comfortable and a safe)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Then the guy shook
his head, laughing at me. "Well, he's most likely taken your picture to
where ever it is ghost's go. We can always check his old room if you
like."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Just to sate my
curiousity, i followed the manager to the lord's room. It was closed off to the
public, and the manager(plus one old janitor) were the only one's allowed into
the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I was informed not
to touch anything, so instead i just looked around. The place was a little
clean, but i soon turned my attention to the potrait on the wall. Yep, that was
the guy i had been seeing. Just my luck. Another supernatural inconter. I'm
starting to think i'm haunted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I turned to the desk
near the potrait and noticed the statue picture laying on top. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I only smiled,
calling the manager over. "He's known to take things he deems his."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I only smiled,
signing my name to the back of the paper. I did say he could have it after all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I was sad to leave a
few hours later, but God knows i'll never forget my stay at that castle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">During the
mid-seventies when I was 15 years old, I lived in a house in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="">Champaign</span></st1:City><span style="">, </span><st1:State><span style="">Illinois</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was a window in the small
dining room that faced the front street.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The house had a sidewalk along the front and a row of 4 ft. high shrubs
was on the street side of the sidewalk.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The point being, you could not see the street very well from the window
and the shrubs provided a dark back-drop for the window.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Every now and again
we would see a small 7-9 year old boy with light blond hair run past the
window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe he may have wore a
horizontal striped t-shirt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several
family members noticed the boy at different times but no one mentioned it until
one day someone spoke up about the little boy and how they go to the front door
and he's not there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">There was nothing
scary about it and we all took the situation very nonchalant.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Why would we not be amazed?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
can't tell you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After we all realized
that this was an apparition we would all call out, "There goes the little
blond haired boy!" every time we saw him.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He didn't follow us when we moved so he must be attached to that house
somehow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">This site has
prompted me to write the owners of the house we lived in nearly 30 years ago,
I'm interested if they too have seen the little boy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I was 12 I lived in a big white house in <st1:place><st1:City>Suffolk</st1:City>
 <st1:State>VA</st1:State></st1:place> on <st1:Street><st1:address>Holland Road</st1:address></st1:Street>.
The house is no longer there, instead there is now a parking lot with some car
place there. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">But anyway, moving on. When I first moved into this house
with my mom I didn't really belive in ghosts...I mean, I had had my experinces
with them and stuff in the past but they never really seemed to REALLY scare me
because I had never acually LIVED with them befor.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;When I moved into this house with my mom it was me,
her, my little brother <st1:PersonName>Bill</st1:PersonName>y, his dad, his
step-mom and step-sister and brother.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;I remember the night I was becoming aware that
something strange was definetly in our house. That day it was just me, my mom
and the three kids because the other two adults had gone off to pick up my
step-sister Seira.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Well my mom was down stairs and she yells for me to
come down staires because she said she could smell something burning. After we
had established that it was just the stove leaking or something we we're in the
dinning room talking. Suddenlly I told her, "Hey, did you light a
candle?" She told me no and asked why.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I asked her if she could smell the vanilla. She said she
could but no one had litten anything. This would be the first of many more
events to come.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The next night everyone, but my mom, deicded to sleap
downstaires. I remember waking up in the middle of the night and just kinda
looked at the ceilling trying to fall back asleep.&nbsp; I remember hearing the
sounds of little kids footsteps running up and down the wooden staires and
running around upstaires. I looked around to see the three kids sleeping and
their three dogs to. At the time, how ever, I didn't think much of it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next night <st1:PersonName>Bill</st1:PersonName>y,
Samantha, and seirra all returned home. We we're all hanging out down the the
living and me and my mom we're telling <st1:PersonName>Bill</st1:PersonName>y
and Samantha about the strange happenings</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;So Samantha and them finnially start to share the
"stories of the house." I'm a little off on the stories because it
happend like five years ago so bear with me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The first thing, the're were children haunting our house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There was a women who died in our house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There was a women who haunted where the garage once stood.
(I never saw her.)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There was a ghost who would turn the lights on and off and
would mess around with the TV.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:PersonName>Bill</st1:PersonName>y once saw eyes
starring at him in the boy's room.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There was one night when he came running into the house
scared out of his mind because he saw two heads float through the fence.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes you could hear in-audible/incoherent voices of two
men talking.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;As they we're telling these stories suddenlly we heard
a loud CRASH upstaires. We looked around. Everyone was down the
stairs...including the dogs. The're was NO one up there to make that noise.
When we went up to investigate something had fallen over that shouldn't have
been ever to fall down on it's own. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;There we're many other stories but I can't remember
them...I was told that the house stood on an old Indian burial ground and one
was used as the site of a battle...</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have read several of the
stories on your site, and have become compelled to share some of my own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am currently 20 years old, and all of my
experiences took place in a house that i lived in from birth to 8 years of
age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was not the only one to
experience things in that house, but my experiences were defintely more intense
then the rest of my familie's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some of
the most common ghostly occurences would occur almost everyday. Doors would
open and close by themselves, footsteps would be heard, and often times in my
case i would hear a few different voices calling out my name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first it freaked me out, but it would
happen so often that i got used to it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would happen very regulary right before i went to bed at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It happened once to my brother and it scared
him really bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most intense
experiences came when i was roughly 6 or so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I began seeing actually entites.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three
distinct different ones, and i only saw them once or twice each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first being a man who was dressed in
black and red flannel with long hair and a beard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He appeared to me in what we called the
"middle room" it was decent size room that seperated my<span style="">&nbsp; </span>room and my brothers room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a very brief encounter, and in no way
did i feel threatened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another occurence
happened not to long after that when i droped something down the stairs into
our basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When i went down to
retreive it i saw a woman with long brown hair and a white dress. She was there
one second and gone the next. This one actually scared me a bit, and i did not
want to go down into the basement alone anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The finally entity i saw was that of a small
child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The child actual woke me up in
the middle of the night and asked if i would play with him. At the time i
thought i was dreaming so i simply rolled over and went to back to sleep. I saw
the same entity again while playing football in my front yard with my friends.
One of my friends asked me who the kid was in the window, and when i looked it
was the same entity that i saw that other night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I immediately ran into the house but didn't
see anyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then ran upstairs and
asked my brother if he had seen a kid in the house, and he just looked at me
puzzled and said "What are you talking about?" I have since been
living in another place in the same town, and have not experienced any other
paranormal activity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I married my second husband
just before moving into this house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
oldest son was 18 and out on his own.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The children who were still living at home with me were my 15 year old
son, my 10 year old daughter and my 5 year old daughter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We had a hard time keeping
the back door closed, even if it was locked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I woke up one night to my husband trying to coerce the cat out from
under the deck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She got out during the
night when the door came open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had a
puppy who would cower when we took her into the back yard to go to the
bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She always stared at the far
corner of the yard like there was something over there she was afraid of. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My daughters and I came home
from shopping one day to find our puppy, who was locked in the hosue when we
left,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>just sitting in the driveway
staring at the wide open back door. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Around Christmas we had
battery operated candles in the windows and let them burn until the batteries
died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About a week after the last light
went out we were sitting at the diningroom table talking about how it had been
a while since the door came open when one of the candles lit up again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stayed on for a couple of hours and didnt
come on again after that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was home by myself
one day I heard someone talking in the livingroom and what sounded like the
front door slam.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went and looked to
see what could have caused the noise.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The front door was closed and locked and the TV wasnt on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We bought my father in laws
house and made some renovations to it before moving in 2002.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I never had an experience
with the unexplainable until we moved into an older home in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lexington</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, MI. in 1994<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was 29 and pregnant with
my 4th child at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My other
children were a 12 year old boy, a 9 year old boy and a 4 year old girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the time we moved into the house our
animals all acted very different.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Something that happened
frequently was a voice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only thing
the voice would say was our names but using the voice of a family member.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When it would call my children it would use
my voice and when it would call me it would use the voice of one of my
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would tell my husband of
these experiences and he thought I was putting bad ideas into my childrens
minds until he experienced it while he was home alone one night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thought he heard me call his name at
around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="13"><span style="font-family: Arial;">1:00</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;"> one morning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The voice would call me
while the children were at school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was easy to ignore then because I knew I was the only one home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would also smell perfume and cigarette
smoke often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody in our house smoked
and I would smell it whether the children were at school or at home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I would sit and crochet on
the couch at the bottom of the stairs everynight after my children had gone to
bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My dog would lay by my feet and
stare up the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would feel like I
was being watched and I would feel a cold breeze coming down the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would hear thumping around upstairs, like
the boys were messing around when they were supposed to be in bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would yell upstairs at them to go back to
bed only to be met with silence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I
went upstairs to investigate, the boys would both be sound asleep in their own
beds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One night, after everyone
was in bed, I heard the cat making a very strange noise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got up without turning on any lights to see
what he had gotten himself into.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
just laying on the floor in front of the closed bathroom door like he was
getting ready to pounce on something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
opened the bathroom door and turned on the light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody in the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned the light off and walked through the
dark headed toward my room when I noticed through my daughters bedroom door, a
dark shadow slide off of her bed and look like it laid on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought it was my dog until I turned on my
bedroom light and saw my dog laying on the foot of my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went into my daughters room to check for
what may have caused what I saw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I found
nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughters bedroom shared an
interior wall with the bathroom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After I had my baby I
switched rooms with my<span style="">&nbsp; </span>daughter because
I couldnt fit the crib in the room I was in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One night all of my children and I were laying on my bed talking and
giggling when my daughter started screaming and crying hysterically.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She swore she saw a shadow in the form of a
man walk through the livingroom from the front door to the stairway and go
upstairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We lived in that house for
another 18 months but only experienced the voice and the smells for the rest of
the time we were there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We had some renovating to do
to this old house before we moved in also.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We had to put in a whole new heating system, new plumming, new carpet,
paint, some wiring, some drywall...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was here by myself one
night painting my daughters room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had
the radio on and kept hearing noises downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Doors slamming, footsteps...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned the radio off because I thought that
was adding to the things I was hearing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That was even worse because then I could hear the noises more
clearly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This house had been vacant for
over a year before we bought it and I didnt know if animals had a way to get in
or even people who may have used this house to party or sleep in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My imagination ran away with me and I ended
up calling my husband to come all the way back here to get me out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the time he got here I was hiding in the
closet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Big Baby, I know, but I was
really scared!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still havent heard the
end of that one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We came out here after dark
one night to get more things taken care of.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We were about 1/4 mile away when I noticed there was a porch light on at
our new house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Good, someone was
thinking!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we pulled in the driveway
the porch light wasnt on and it looked like the livingroom light went off as we
pulled in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband and I walked
though the house with a hammer and crowbar before we let the girls come
in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody was here and the cellar light
was on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wouldnt have been able to see
that light coming down the road.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After we moved in we were
expecting the water softener guy so I slept in my daughters room that day. The
same room whos closet I hid in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was
just starting to fall asleep I heard two kids giggling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The TV wasnt on and my children were at
school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was too tired to worry about
it and fell asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One Saturday morning after
work, I went to my room and sat on the edge of the bed talking to my
husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While we were talking I heard
someone come down the stairs and close the bathroom door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat and talked to my husband for another
15-20 minutes waiting for the person in the bathroom to get out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was going to hurry them along and poked my
head around the corner to say something.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The bathroom door was open.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nobody was in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned and
looked at my husband and asked him if he didnt just hear someone come down the
stairs and close the bathroom door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
said he had heard it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would have
heard the toilet flush and the door open up again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our bedroom is right there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have "felt"
someone in the room with me on several occaisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have even talked to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I turn to look at the person Im speaking
to there is nobody there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happens
in the kitchen frequently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There have
been knocks on the bathroom door when I'm home alone and in the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hear footsteps upstairs all the time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My son came home from work
one night to find my oldest daughter sitting downstairs in the livingroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was home alone and told him that she
heard things upstairs and didnt want to go up there alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He made a comment to her that it was pretty
sad little sister can play up there by herself and older sister was afraid to
go there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter told him little
sister was at her girlfriends house spending the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told her to stop trying to mess with him
because he just heard little sister upstairs singing in her room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he went up to his room he looked for his
little sister and found that she wasnt there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We still "feel"
and hear things often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long as I dont
see anything this will be my last house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
