</H3><P>
<P><B>By:   N. Zimmer</B>
<P>
<P><B>One time when I was about 14 years old I was babysitting for a police
officer and his wife. The </B>
<P><B>police officer was on duty that night and I can't really remember where
the wife was going, but </B>
<P><B>nonetheless, they hired me to babysit. I had never been to their house
before and I remember when</B>
<P><B> I got there how creepy this house seemed. It was an old house down
in Walled Lake Michigan and </B>
<P><B>I can remember that the house did not have modern heat ducts, instead
there were registers in the</B>
<P><B> floor in the upstairs that you could peer through clear to the downstairs
living area. I don't </B>
<P><B>remember too much about the incident other than hearing some footsteps
upstairs and other noises</B>
<P><B> after I had put the couple's children to bed. I could hear the noises
very well through the heat</B>
<P><B> registers and I remember it looked as though somebody had walked right
over one of them above me.</B>
<P><B>I remember going upstairs to check to see what they were up to, only
to find them sound asleep. </B>
<P><B>I also remember trying to wake them and it was obvious that they were
fast asleep, and besides, </B>
<P><B>they were very small children, like 3 and 4 years old, certainly not
old enough to pull off any </B>
<P><B>kind of prank very well. And so I went back downstairs, alittle concerned
since the house was </B>
<P><B>dark and creepy to begin with and I had heard these strange un-explained
noises, but after going</B>
<P><B> back downstairs and the noises started again, I immediately called
dispatch, got the police </B>
<P><B>officer on the phone and demanded that he come home and take me home
immediately as I would not</B>
<P><B> stay any longer. I never babysitted for them again....and I do remember
the police officer </B>
<P><B>trying to convince me all the way home that it was just my imagination
because the house was </B>
<P><B>old, etc...in either case, I never went back and told the police officer
nicely to find another</B>
<P><B> babysitter.</B>
<P><B>Another incident happened when I was in high school, shortly before
graduation. I use to babysit </B>
<P><B>my little sister after school for a couple hours before my stepmother
got home. One afternoon I </B>
<P><B>was babysitting her and watching tv, she was very young at the time,
about 4 years old. This was</B>
<P><B> the time of day that she usually took a nap and she fell asleep on
the couch next to me like </B>
<P><B>usual. While watching television that afternoon (and I wasn't watching
anything scarey, I think</B>
<P><B> I may have been watching either Oprah or a soap opera) I destinctly
heard the sliding glass door</B>
<P><B> in the finished basement open and close. You know the sound of sliding
glass doors, the sound is</B>
<P><B>very distinct. I didn't think anything of it, my father and stepmother
usually came and went </B>
<P><B>through that door since the finished basement is actually on the ground
level and the living </B>
<P><B>quarters of this beautiful log home is actually on the second floor...this
was a common and most</B>
<P><B> used entrance into the house. My father worked out of town during
the week and was only home on</B>
<P><B> the weekends. Anyway, like I said, I didn't think anything of it,
I thought my step mother was </B>
<P><B>home and expected her to come walking up the stairs at any moment like
she usually did when she</B>
<P><B> came home. I also remember thinking, "boy she's home early today...."
I just kept watching</B>
<P><B> television....after about 10 minutes I noticed that she had not come
up the stairs so I went</B>
<P><B> to the stairs and called down to her but got no response...I thought
to myself, "that's weird,</B>
<P><B> I know I heard the door..." then I heard what sounded like somebody
downstairs so I called again....and again, nothing. So I peered out the kitchen
window and looked down into the driveway and her car was not there.....I
got scared at that point. I thought to myself, "Oh no, not again!" (remembering
other incidents while babysitting) and I ran to the telephone to try to call
her at work....the phone was dead! I absolutely freaked out at this point,
I grabbed my little sister, who was still fast asleep, threw her litle winter
coat on her (it was the middle of winter time), grabbed the biggest butcher
knife I could find and ran out the front door, down the deck steps and into
my Dad's old pickup truck in the driveway. I locked the doors and just sat
there in total terror...I didn't know what to do...there was no doubt in
my mind that somebody was in the house and I stared at that house for what
seemed like forever until my step mother got home. Ofcorse she couldn't
understand why I was so hysterical...and what on earth I was doing outside
in the pickup truck in the middle of dead winter with a butcher </B>
<P><B>knife of all things.....anyway, she checked the sliding glass door
to the basement, it was </B>
<P><B>locked, there seemed to be nobody in the house and if it were a real
person in the house, there </B>
<P><B>is no way they could have escaped un-seen by me as I sat in the old
pickup truck.....i remember </B>
<P><B>how scared I was...the house is in the woods and back then there wasn't
another house closer </B>
<P><B>than about 80 acres away..... By the way, the first thing my step mother
did when she got home </B>
<P><B>and investigated my claim was to check the telephone, which was working
fine.... Oh well, I know</B>
<P><B> she thought I had absolutely lost my rocker that afternoon but I know
better. She still laughs </B>
<P><B>and teases me about it whenever it is brought up now. My little sister,
who is now 20 years old, </B>
<P><B>doesn't remember a thing...</B>
<P><B>At this same home during the same time in my life, shortly before high
school graduation, I </B>
<P><B>experienced the strangest things each night in my bedroom after everybody
went to sleep... these</B>
<P><B> strange things occurred for at least several weeks. I would fall asleep
but awaken around 1 -2</B>
<P><B> am in the morning because my bed would be shaking..... now I just
want to clarify that this log </B>
<P><B>home is not old or anything...it was only about 10 years old at the
time and very very beautiful.</B>
<P><B> I had a beautiful bedroom with pretty pink carpeting..there was nothing
creepy or scarey about </B>
<P><B>this house, nor the woods that it was situated in..HOWEVER, every night
like clockwork for </B>
<P><B>several weeks I would awaken to feel my bed shaking uncontrollably
and I would throw the covers</B>
<P><B> over my head and just shake in total fear, then it would stop, I would
fall back asleep and by </B>
<P><B>morning I would think it was just a dream.....except after awhile I
started realizing that it was</B>
<P><B> no dream, it was really happening and I can remember one night yelling,
"stop it! go away!" and</B>
<P><B> that was the end of it, it never happened again... and after what
happened in the earlier story </B>
<P><B>I just told, I never spoke to my parents about it, the only person
in the world that I told was </B>
<P><B>my boyfriend, who also happens to be my husband of 14 years.......he
is convinced that I am </B>
<P><B>sensitive to spiritual things.</B>
<P><B>As I said in my last letter, because of the experiences I have had
in my life, like those told</B>
<P><B> about above and the actual ghost I saw that I spoke about in an earlier
email, I am so very </B>
<P><B>much interested in ghost hunting...my husband would have no part of
it so when it comes to this</B>
<P><B> stuff, I'm on my own...but I just don't know where to start.....I
guess there is a part of me </B>
<P><B>that wants to do this so that I don't feel like I'm crazy and also
because of so many un-answered</B>
<P><B> bibical questions that I have that somehow I feel like if I do this
I might feel more resolved </B>
<P><B>in my beliefs... on the other hand it could prove to be even more
confusing,, who knows. If you </B>
<P><B>have any suggestions about how to go about doing this secretly (I can't
let anyone in the </B>
<P><B>community I live in know what I am up to...I am a business owner and
local policitian and I </B>
<P><B>don't need people thinking I'm nuts) i would appreciate any advice
you could give me... Thanks so</B>
<P><B> much. </B>

<P><B>A Haunted Life</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  shaan@telstra.easymail.com.au</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi, I just got on to your web sight and am fascinated at its content.
I </B>
<P><B>am also happy to hear that I am not the only one who has lived their
</B>
<P><B>lives amongst spirits. My mother used to be heavily into clairvoyancy
</B>
<P><B>and such things so there were always 'visitors' in the house, which
</B>
<P><B>usually attatched themselves to me. I would love to compare stories
with </B>
<P><B>you and see whether we have shared experiences. One of the first </B>
<P><B>episodes with me included a poltergeist that I picked up from a stay
at </B>
<P><B>my fathers house ( he has a history with communicating the dead, and
bad </B>
<P><B>things are always at his house). I was only young so I can't remember
</B>
<P><B>much and my mother is reluctant to bring these things up, but I remember
</B>
<P><B>one incident that occured. One night she woke to weird noises coming
</B>
<P><B>from my room, and walked in to find an invisible force sucking me </B>
<P><B>through my flyscreen window. She grabbed me and there was a tug of
war </B>
<P><B>for some time, but eventually she managed to set me free and drag me
</B>
<P><B>into her room. All I remember is waking up to her dragging me through
</B>
<P><B>the hall, then passing out. This is just minor compared to other things
</B>
<P><B>which I have experienced, even now, despite the fact that I am 18.
So </B>
<P><B>please write back to me if you wish to compare notes. </B>

<P><B>AN EARTH SPIRIT?</B>
<P><B>By:    &lt;goodnomore@yahoo.com&gt;</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>   While this doesn't pertain to an actual ghost, it</B>
<P><B> is</B>
<P><B> something that we thought you might find</B>
<P><B> interesting,</B>
<P><B>at the very least.  In 1995, we lived in a rural</B>
<P><B> area</B>
<P><B> outside Gaston, Indiana.  The home we lived in was</B>
<P><B> over 200 years old, and while there were events that</B>
<P><B> took place inside that home, this concerns something</B>
<P><B> we saw outside.  It was witnessed by myself, my</B>
<P><B> husband, and our 3 children. </B>
<P><B>   The home we lived in was at the front of an almost</B>
<P><B> 200-acre plot of land.  This land was heavily wooded</B>
<P><B> in parts, with fields on each side and back of the</B>
<P><B> home.  The land itself was sold to a man that owned</B>
<P><B> and operated his own earth-construction business. </B>
<P><B> To</B>
<P><B> put it simply, this man was not a nice person.  He</B>
<P><B> was</B>
<P><B> well known for destroying wooded areas, just to make</B>
<P><B> room for more fields.  No thought for trying to</B>
<P><B> salvage anything in nature... he just ripped and</B>
<P><B> destroyed. </B>
<P><B>   One mid-afternoon, the new owner of the property</B>
<P><B> showed up with a bulldozer, and just began shoving</B>
<P><B> down trees that separated our property from the</B>
<P><B> outlying fields... huge trees, hundreds of years</B>
<P><B> old,</B>
<P><B> and he toppled them with no thought or conscience. </B>
<P><B> My</B>
<P><B> children were devastated... they have been taught to</B>
<P><B> respect nature, and that you use only what is</B>
<P><B> necessary for survival.  I tried very hard to keep</B>
<P><B>hem indoors, but they were compelled to witness</B>
<P><B> first-hand what they considered to be murder...</B>
<P><B> murder</B>
<P><B> of trees, and destruction of hundreds of animals</B>
<P><B> that</B>
<P><B> used the groundcover for their burrows and nests.   </B>
<P><B> This destruction had been in process approximately 3</B>
<P><B> hours when my husband came running into our home -</B>
<P><B> ashen-faced, and obviously scared out of his wits. </B>
<P><B> He</B>
<P><B> insisted that he could see 'something' outside in</B>
<P><B> the</B>
<P><B> sky, and that I had to come look.  (Without going</B>
<P><B> into</B>
<P><B> details, I would like to tell you that my now</B>
<P><B> ex-husband had a very strong sense for the dramatic,</B>
<P><B> so I took his 'sighting' with a somewhat skeptical</B>
<P><B> view.)  He took me by the hand, and literally</B>
<P><B> dragged</B>
<P><B> me out the back door of our home - where I saw our 3</B>
<P><B> children, standing frozen in their tracks, staring</B>
<P><B> at</B>
<P><B> this 'thing' that was in the sky. </B>
<P><B>   It was a typical June afternoon in Indiana - clear</B>
<P><B> blue sky, with a few wispy clouds to the north.  In</B>
<P><B> the middle of these clouds was a face.  The face had</B>
<P><B> very feline features... ears, eyes, nose, and mouth.</B>
<P><B> But the actual outline of the face looked human. </B>
<P><B> And</B>
<P><B> its mouth was downturned into a very sad mournful</B>
<P><B>rown.  It appeared to hover over the area where the</B>
<P><B> bulldozer was still being used. </B>
<P><B>   At first, I tried to downplay it as a mass of</B>
<P><B> clouds</B>
<P><B> that somehow just appeared to be making a face...</B>
<P><B> but</B>
<P><B> as we stood and looked, the features became clearer.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B> So clear that you could see the pupils of its eyes,</B>
<P><B> and the hair sticking out of its feline ears.  And</B>
<P><B> within minutes, it became evident it wasn't just a</B>
<P><B> mass of clouds, because the clouds around it were</B>
<P><B> moving, just as they should... but it held its</B>
<P><B> position. </B>
<P><B>   We stood for over two hours, just watching this</B>
<P><B> face</B>
<P><B> in the sky. And the longer we watched, and the</B>
<P><B> longer</B>
<P><B> the destruction of the bulldozer went on, the sadder</B>
<P><B> the face grew.  My oldest daughter still swears to</B>
<P><B> this day she saw tears forming in its eyes as the</B>
<P><B> trees were being toppled.  We watched the face until</B>
<P><B> it grew dusky outside... it was still there.  As</B>
<P><B> darkness came, we could no longer see it, but we</B>
<P><B> were</B>
<P><B> all filled with a great sense of sadness at what we</B>
<P><B> had seen that afternoon and evening.  We went</B>
<P><B> inside,</B>
<P><B> and heard that bulldozer continue to run, very late</B>
<P><B> into the night.  As soon as we woke up the next</B>
<P><B> morning, we went outside, but the face was gone. </B>
<P><B>   You may also find it interesting to know that</B>
<P><B> within</B>
<P><B> a month after this happened, the man who</B>
<P><B> deliberately</B>
<P><B> destroyed this living land lost his life... he was</B>
<P><B> taken by a massive heart attack while on that very</B>
<P><B> same bulldozer.</B>

<P><B> Ghetto in the Meadow</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:   MongoSmo@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>   Eleven years ago, I moved into an old little walkout rambler that</B>
<P><B>sits on my father-in-laws business property in the country. We call
it</B>
<P><B>Ghetto in the Meadow. Don't get me wrong, its OK, but tiny and at
that</B>
<P><B>time needed some repairs that have sinse been done. It had at one
time</B>
<P><B>been moved to the country by the man that had lived for many years
in</B>
<P><B>the house until he died in the hospital. His name was Myron. I had
to</B>
<P><B>move my king sized waterbed in the unfinished basement because thats
the</B>
<P><B>only place that was big enough for the bed. My boyfriend, refused to</B>
<P><B>sleep downstairs because when we were downstairs we could hear
footsteps</B>
<P><B>above us going back and forth. One night, we fell asleep on the floor</B>
<P><B>watching TV on the main floor. Sometime in the night, my boyfriend
moved</B>
<P><B>to the couch and left me on the floor. It was about 5am that I woke
up</B>
<P><B>stiff. We were talking and heard a noise like someone walking
upstairs.</B>
<P><B>Then we heard a blurp, blurp noise in the bathroom. I jokingly told
my</B>
<P><B>boyfriend that it was Myron and he had to go to the bathroom. Just
after</B>
<P><B>I said it, the water in the bathroom sink came on!! He wanted me to
stay</B>
<P><B>in the living room and he would check it out. No Way! I was right
behind</B>
<P><B>him and watched as he had to turn the handle to shut the water off.</B>
<P><B>After that, we had many things happen- lights and the TV would turn
on</B>
<P><B>and off, a broom in the basement would get knocked over,and I smelled</B>
<P><B>pipe smoke in the livingroom once and perfume in the kitchen several</B>
<P><B>times. Our beagle would stare up at the ceiling as if watching
something</B>
<P><B>by where you get up to the attic.  Many times, my boyfriend would get</B>
<P><B>his gun out and go looking around the house because we would hear</B>
<P><B>strange things. We got a double waterbed that would fit in one of the</B>
<P><B>two small bedrooms. After that, we would hear a lot of noise in the</B>
<P><B>basement by a workbench. We lived in the house for 5 years. My Mom</B>
<P><B>couldn't believe that we would stay there, but it was pretty much</B>
<P><B>harmless stuff and it wasn't like it was happening every night. Just</B>
<P><B>when we'd start feeling like maybe we imagined what had happened,</B>
<P><B>something else would go on. Before we moved, I had tried to get my</B>
<P><B>husband to come to bed instead of sleeping on the couch. I got his
usual</B>
<P><B>reply of "in a minute", which meant he wouldn't be moving. I went
into</B>
<P><B>the bedroom and it felt really cold. So much so that I went and
checked</B>
<P><B>the thermostat in case it got turned down. I had just gotten
comfortable</B>
<P><B>and heard my husband yell out my name. He said he heard little feet</B>
<P><B>scurrying from the kitchen to the livingroom really fast and go
behind</B>
<P><B>the couch (the couch was only inches away from the wall) and
something</B>
<P><B>slapped him on the back of the head! He didn't go back to sleep that</B>
<P><B>whole night. Maybe something was telling him that he should be in bed</B>
<P><B>with me. I found it funny, but he didn't find the humor in it. We had
a</B>
<P><B>baby and moved into our new house. I heard balls inside one of her
blow</B>
<P><B>up toys `move and went to check on it so it wouldn't wake her up. I</B>
<P><B>thought the toy was by the register and the air conditioning was on,
but</B>
<P><B>it wasn't even close by. Twice it happened. One afternoon, I laid
down</B>
<P><B>for a nap and remember seeing a very good looking man come to my
bedroom</B>
<P><B>door and talk to me. At first, I was afraid, but when I saw his face
I</B>
<P><B>wasn't. I couldn't remember what he talked to me about, but asked if
he</B>
<P><B>could see our baby before he left. He turned around and looked in the</B>
<P><B>other bedroom for a minute and turned back around and said my name
and</B>
<P><B>told me how beautiful she was and that she'd be waking up. In that</B>
<P><B>instant, she was crying, he was gone and I was awake. Do you think
it</B>
<P><B>was a dream? Or who was it? Myron, from Ghetto in the Meadow or my</B>
<P><B>husband's brother that died? After that, nothing usual has happened
at</B>
<P><B>our house. My brother-in-law moved to Ghetto in the Meadow and said
that</B>
<P><B>at first the lights would go on and heard noises, but nothing has</B>
<P><B>happened there in years.</B>

<P><B>Indian Ghost</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:dawnwest1@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My husband and I had built a new home on ancient indian grounds.  We</B>
<P><B>know this because of all the shards from arrowheads that were found
on</B>
<P><B>the property.  I was home one day and watching TV when I saw an
Indian</B>
<P><B>brave with full head regalia walk into the den and stand in front of
the</B>
<P><B>television.  I was rather amazed but did not feel this entity was</B>
<P><B>malevolent.  He stood there for about 3 minutes looking at me then</B>
<P><B>turned and walked away, fading in the process.  We lived there for
a few</B>
<P><B>more years but he never reappeared.  I guess that's when I truly
started</B>
<P><B>believing in ghosts.</B>

<P><B>My Hauntings</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>By:  CaFossey@aol.com </B>
<P>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>This is my exsperience with a haunted house. Me and my family moved
into this</B>
<P><B>big house about 15 years ago, I had two small daughters, and my husband
at </B>
<P><B>the time, The first night there, I was alone and had just put my kids
to </B>
<P><B>sleep upstairs,and was just laying down myself, when i heard someone
in the kitchen, it </B>
<P><B>sounded like they wrer going through the drawers frantically looking
for something! </B>
<P><B>Well i was terrified, as i knew that my husband wasnt there. I went
down stairs to see </B>
<P><B>what or who was there and nothing was out of place. Thats when other
things</B>
<P><B>started to occur.  My youngest daughter woulnt go upstairs by herself,
she always</B>
<P><B>told me that there was a man up there. I didnt understand until later,
as we settled </B>
<P><B>in things got worse for me.</B>
<P><B>    I would be watching tv the volume would go up and down, ashtrays
on the </B>
<P><B>table would move, the drapes would sway, when the windows werent
open.</B>
<P><B>I was bathing one time in the downstairs bathroom, and felt something</B>
<P><B>touch my shoulder! It felt very cold. I had things of mine taken, and
have never </B>
<P><B>gotten back.     One night i was just dozing off, and i felt the covers
being pulled off </B>
<P><B>of me, this really scared me, but i tryed not to think about it the
next day. I was </B>
<P><B>cleaning the stairs, and a very deep voice said hey you, right beside
me.</B>
<P><B>The hair stood up on my neck, that night at 2am someone came running
up the stairs, stopping at the </B>
<P><B>top, ofcourse i saw nothing there.</B>
<P><B>    My husband told me that he awoke one night and there was a very
tall man </B>
<P><B>standing in a corner of our room, dressed in black just watching us.</B>
<P><B>The next day my oldest daughter told me that a woman who was dressed
like a </B>
<P><B>nurse carrying a tray, came out of her closet walking towards her,
she had a </B>
<P><B>nametag, but it wasnt readable, it scared her pretty bad.</B>
<P><B>     One morning i was down in the basement doing laundry, and i hated
to go </B>
<P><B>down there!! when i got this terrible feeling, i tryed to ignore it,
but it </B>
<P><B>got worse the hairs on my neck where tingling. I knew that something
was </B>
<P><B>coming up behind me, but i couldnt move, then it was like someone stomped
on </B>
<P><B>the cement floor, it was so wierd because the floor vibrated!! I was
so </B>
<P><B>scared that i threw my laundry and ran up the stairs! </B>
<P><B>I would also go to bed with jewery on and wake up and it would be off
and i </B>
<P><B>would find it somewhere in the house. One morning i woke up to find
a </B>
<P><B>straight razor in my bed down by my feet!!! I think that did it for
me i wanted to move out.</B>
<P><B>  And the kids bedroom window would never stay shut, we tryed everything
to </B>
<P><B>keep it shut but i would go upstairs and it would be opened.</B>
<P><B>My mother babysat for me one evening, and when i got home, she was
white</B>
<P><B>as a ghost! and told me that she would never watch my kids here
again!</B>
<P><B>    We also had a dog that we kept tied in a corner of the yard , right
by </B>
<P><B>the area of the basement that scared me the most, and i saw him digging
and </B>
<P><B>didnt think anything of it until i returned and saw that he had dug
a hole </B>
<P><B>waist deep!, and was still trying to dig. his paws where bleeding and
he was </B>
<P><B>foaming at the mouth, i had to pull him out of there, it was
horrible.</B>
<P><B>he finally moved out, and for a long time my daughter was afraid that
the</B>
<P><B>man was going to follow us.</B>
<P><B>I looked up the history of the house and found out that it was built
in the </B>
<P><B>18 hundreds that was all that i could find out.</B>
<P><B>The house is still there, i drive by it sometimes and wonder if the
people </B>
<P><B>who live there now have any problems.</B>

<P><B>Family Ghost History</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: MEL897@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>There's a lot of ghost stories in my family, so I'll just tell you
a</B>
<P><B>few. My grandfather passed away before I was born. He used to wait
for</B>
<P><B>my aunt, sitting in his rocking chair, every day to get out of
school.</B>
<P><B>Well, one day after he died my aunt said that she came home from
school</B>
<P><B>to find her babysitter with her jaw hanging open &amp; wide eyed staring
at</B>
<P><B>the rocker. It was rocking by itself and their dog was sittig in
front</B>
<P><B>of it, begging. Suddenly, the rocker stopped moving and the dog
started</B>
<P><B>walking slowly to the back door.(Which was deadbolted locked) The
door</B>
<P><B>unlocked in front of everyone and swung open. So did the screen door.</B>
<P><B>Normally if the back door was open the dog would run out. He didn't.</B>
<P><B>Then both doors shut again but they didn't lock.        Another story
is</B>
<P><B>told by my mother &amp; my aunts on my father's side. They were all
playing</B>
<P><B>Trivial Pursuit when a question came up about one of the wars that
my</B>
<P><B>grandfather fought in. Meanwhile, there was a pot of spaghetti
sitting</B>
<P><B>on the stove. My aunt Patti said a smart comment about my grandfather
&amp;</B>
<P><B>the war, just joking around. Well, the pot of spaghetti flew across
the</B>
<P><B>room and landed right next to my aunt Patti's feet! It dumped
everywhere</B>
<P><B>&amp; just missed her!!! I think he was just telling her that her
joke</B>
<P><B>wasn't funny.     My personal experiances are different. One for</B>
<P><B>instance was when my grandmother died in 1990. Two weeks later me and
my</B>
<P><B>cousin slept at my grandmothers house(my aunts &amp; father lived
there.</B>
<P><B>Well, about 8:00pm we both went into the living room to watch TV and
my</B>
<P><B>grandma's rocker was rocking by itself!!! That I saw withmy own 2
eyes!</B>
<P><B>Another incident was at my cousin Sandy's house. My cousin Brandy &amp;
I</B>
<P><B>were babysitting. She was on the phone with her boyfriend when the</B>
<P><B>kitchen lightswitch started turning on and off by itself! It was
going</B>
<P><B>up and down like someone was turning it on and off.  OK, last</B>
<P><B>story...the story to my cousin Sandy's house is even weirder! A man
had</B>
<P><B>hung himself in attic a couple of years before she moved in. My
cousin</B>
<P><B>was a dancer so she used to exercise a lot to stay in shape. Anyways,</B>
<P><B>she told me a few stories about when she was exercising and she would</B>
<P><B>get tapped on the shoulder. Or once she heard someone calling out her</B>
<P><B>newborn sons name &amp; no one was in the house. She heard knocks on
the</B>
<P><B>front door, the attic door would open and shut continuesly. Her</B>
<P><B>brother-in-law was there on a few incidences. Who ever he was, he
wasn't</B>
<P><B>good. He was definantly there to scare, so she moved out within 6</B>
<P><B>months. I have a few more that I can think of, but I think that this
is</B>
<P><B>already too long!!! I don't know if there's a reason for so many</B>
<P><B>"hauntings" in my family or not, but I wish that it would stop! You</B>
<P><B>never know what would happen if someone ever really got one these</B>
<P><B>spirits angry! Thanks for reading my "family history" I hope you
enjoyed</B>
<P><B>it, I don't!   </B>

<P><B>The Black Figure</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  smatthew@telusplanet.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had my first "real" ghost experience twenty years ago and have not</B>
<P><B>forgotten it to this day.  I had only just moved out on my own and
was</B>
<P><B>in the habit of stopping by my parents home to visit.  It was early</B>
<P><B>December and a cold, bright day.  I sat with my mother in the kitchen</B>
<P><B>and while she was making a pot of tea a got up and went into the
bedroom</B>
<P><B>to brush my hair.  A large mirror hung on the door and a staircase
was</B>
<P><B>directly to my right.  If you looked up the stairs you could see the</B>
<P><B>hall above and there are windows at both ends of the hall.  The sun
was</B>
<P><B>shining brightly down the hall.   As I brushed my hair I felt quite
a</B>
<P><B>cold chill up my spine and had the distinct impression that I was
being</B>
<P><B>watched although only my mother and I were in the house.  The hairs
on</B>
<P><B>the back of my neck actually stood on end and I involuntarily turned
to</B>
<P><B>look up the staircase.  In the split second it took to turn my head
I</B>
<P><B>saw what appeared to be a large figure of a man dressed in a black
suit</B>
<P><B>moving away from the hall and out of my line of vision. I was
virtually</B>
<P><B>rooted to the spot, could not speak or move for several seconds even</B>
<P><B>though every instinct told me to run.  It did finally register on me</B>
<P><B>that I had actually been able to see through the figure and that the</B>
<P><B>figure had no feet, hands or head.  I certainly wasn't expecting an</B>
<P><B>experience like that on a normal, bright, sunny winter afternoon. 
I did</B>
<P><B>not know whether to say anything to my mother or not as I assumed she</B>
<P><B>would think I was just overtired or totally nuts.  When I went back
into</B>
<P><B>the kitchen I sat down and we were having tea and I finally blurted
out</B>
<P><B>"Do you believe in ghosts, mom?"  Her response was most unexpected.
 She</B>
<P><B>said "You've seen it too!"  We got to talking and she told me that
for</B>
<P><B>several months she had seen the same figure passing doorways and
never</B>
<P><B>said a word to anyone, especially my father who is a most practical
man.</B>
<P><B>Her relief was so apparent when she realized she had not just been</B>
<P><B>imaging things.  For several weeks after my initial encounter you
could</B>
<P><B>actually sense something amiss in the house and then just as suddenly
it</B>
<P><B>was gone.  We never did find out what had brought this on as my
Father</B>
<P><B>had built the house shortly after the war and we were the only people</B>
<P><B>ever to live there. No one had ever died there.  When I look back on</B>
<P><B>life there as a child some incidents do stand out in my mind that
were</B>
<P><B>not exactly normal although at that time people did not really
discuss</B>
<P><B>the paranormal as freely as they do today.  I recall an evening when
my</B>
<P><B>parents and I had gone out for the evening and my older sister had</B>
<P><B>stayed home alone.  When we arrived home at approximately 9:00 p.m.
we</B>
<P><B>found my sister standing by the kitchen sink with tears streaming
down</B>
<P><B>her face.  She was about 15 years old at the time.  She was almost</B>
<P><B>hysterical when we arrived.  Apparently she was doing the dishes and
got</B>
<P><B>the most intense feeling that someone was standing behind her and was</B>
<P><B>incredibly afraid to turn around.  She had stood literally paralyzed</B>
<P><B>with fear for over an hour.  I recall as a child having horrible</B>
<P><B>nightmares always about the staircase and thinking some awful
creature</B>
<P><B>would come down the stair to get me.  I have no idea why.  Years have</B>
<P><B>since gone by since that frightening winter afternoon.  My parents</B>
<P><B>divorced and my father stayed on in the house. My mother and I  had</B>
<P><B>never mentioned the original incident to dad but on a visit to see
him</B>
<P><B>one day I noticed he had actually boarded up the staircase leading
to</B>
<P><B>the upstairs.  When I asked him why he said it was to conserve energy
as</B>
<P><B>he was alone in the house and never had the need to go upstairs.  I</B>
<P><B>wonder.....</B>
<P><B>Up in the Loft...</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  coz316@ev1.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>  I am so glad that I found this site.  I moved to my current
apartment</B>
<P><B>in late January of this year.  In the beginning of March I began
hearing</B>
<P><B>strange things, but had always dismissed them as something logical.
 A</B>
<P><B>few days ago a friend had, also heard what I had.  For a brief moment
I</B>
<P><B>was thinking that I should seek mental help.  I could feel something
at</B>
<P><B>certains spots.  I knew it was looking at me.  I know that it is</B>
<P><B>masculine.  He stays in my loft most of the time, but I have been</B>
<P><B>awakened by shaking.  I thought it was my sister coming in late one</B>
<P><B>night.  I saw four linked circles in my bathroom doorway.  They were</B>
<P><B>rainbow colors, primary.  They stayed there for about two to three</B>
<P><B>minutes.  I had also felt as if I were being spat upon, when I was
on my</B>
<P><B>computer.  A couple of weeks ago I had heard a woman screaming.  I</B>
<P><B>thought it was coming from my neighbor's apartment, until my friend</B>
<P><B>heard the same just a few nights ago.  Also, it seems a fly or
mosquito</B>
<P><B>is buzzing in my ear.  My sister's friend had heard the same.  It is</B>
<P><B>rather active when a particuliar male friend comes by.  We have seen</B>
<P><B>shadows across the walls, too.  When I prompt it to make a sound, it</B>
<P><B>doesn't.  Almost as if it's insulted.  I went to an intuitive reader</B>
<P><B>that I know and she suggested having my apartment 'smudged'.  I am</B>
<P><B>frightened of it from dark to dusk, but if it means no harm and is
just</B>
<P><B>having a little fun, I don't mind.  It is especially active in the
early</B>
<P><B>morning hours.  I want to know why it is here.  No one has dies here.
 I</B>
<P><B>talk to it aloud, so that it feels comfortable with me.  I have had
more</B>
<P><B>nightmares since moving here than I have had all my life.  I would
like</B>
<P><B>to know of someone who has experience in this situation that may lend</B>
<P><B>help.  I want to know if I can help him in anyway.  He seems annoyed</B>
<P><B>when I I use the 'psychic circle' board.  He answers yes or no
questions</B>
<P><B>and has spelled out scary things, but gets annoyed and makes the
oracle</B>
<P><B>go in circles, fast.  Please, give me names of persons that can help
me</B>
<P><B>figure out who and why he is here.  I do not feel he was here when
I</B>
<P><B>first moved in.  I would also like to know what the rings represent.</B>
<P><B>Thank you so much.</B>
