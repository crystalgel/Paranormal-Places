<p class="MsoNormal">Marine in Vietnam<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I`ve been wanting to tell this story for a while
now. I was
a Marine in Vietnam. And this was hill 689 overlooking the Khesan
combat base.
We had deep bunkers dug and trenches connecting each bunker because of
artillery attacks<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and took turns
standing watch. I was on watch that night must have been around 1 in
the
morning. One side of the trench was kind of going uphill and that part
of the
trench is when I saw a figure walking towards me. Immediately I brought
my
rifle up to challenge the figure walking towards me. The only problem I
didn`t
hear any footsteps. It was very dark out as clouds were rolling in. The
figure
stopped and just stood there. I`m thinking it must be a North
Vietnames. It was
more of a shadowy outline. Seem like I blinked a few times and the
figure
seemed to just disappear. My hair stood on end and I was at the ready
the rest
of the night. Next day I asked around who was walking the trenches
which no one
did.I know sometimes tired eyes see things, but believe me I was wide
awake
when being approached by someone or something without hearing
footsteps,
crunching sounds on dirt. I believe in war strange things happen
especially
around the Khesan area where tens of thousands of North Vietnamese were
killed.

<p class="MsoNormal">Ball of Light<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By:pnags05@hotmail.com<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I was never much of a ghost believer or paid much
interest
in that sort of thing. Until I had my experience with "something". My
wife and I were fast asleep with our son who was 3 at the time fast
asleep
between us. I was suddenly awoken by the inability to move or speak. I
closed
my eyes thinking i was in a lucid dream but when I reopened I knew sure
as the
sky is blue that I AM awake and something was wrong! I felt my hairs on
my neck
stand up and could sense that something was above my head. Like on the
pillow
or something. Suddenly a bright ball of light began to dance around the
room.
The ball of light was maybe no bigger than a soccer ball but could
shrink and
expand its size at will. I tried to track its movement around the room
but was
still completely paralyzed. Even my eyes wouldnt move. I began to fight
the
paralysis by giving my muscles everything I had. Commanding them to
move!
Nothing. My fear grew as the helpless feeling began to overcome me. Im
a hefty
guy at 6'1" and over 250lbs and Im a construction worker so you can
understand why Im not used to feeling helpless or weak. Anyway I
continued to
fight determined to wiggle a toe or twitch a muscle. Still nothing. The
ball of
light then shrunk to the size of a grapefruit and stayed in the top
corner of
the room hovering for a bit. It then made its way around behind my head
and on
my pillow. This time I knew 150% i was awake. I could FEEL it. Its
energy
tickled the top of my head and made my hair stand up. Just like you can
feel
the static on your hair when it stands up from rubbing a balloon on
your head.
It then came around again and began darting around the room. This time
my fear
overcame me as I knew not what its intentions were. Is it a ghost?
Alien?
Strange atmospheric event? I didnt know. All I knew was that I needed
to find a
way to wake my wife and fast. I began to fight the paralysis even
harder. I was
sweating from tensing my muscles so bad but it felt as if i had a lead
weight
on my chest. I relized I had my arm under my sons head and my finger
tips were
touching my wifes hair. I tried calling her name but couldnt speak. If
only I
could move my finger tips enough to poke her. The ball of light seemed
to sense
the fight in me as it paused above my knees and expanded to the size of
a small
beach ball. I could feel the pressure on my chest and vocal chords
increase. It
was fighting back!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It began to slowly
move towards my face. I was desperately trying to call out to my wife
but all
that was comming out were muffled groans. It began coming towards me at
an
increased rate. The fear gripped me. I began to feel something strange
in my
left arm. My finger was halfway responding to my commands! It was
wiggling the
back of my wifes head! I knew my opportunity had come. I was almost
there. The
wiggling finger and muffled groans caught my wifes attention. As she
lifted her
head not even an inch off her pillow i was able to suck in a large
breath of
air and let out a loud scream while at the same time grabbing a fist
full of my
wifes hair. Whatever was holding me released me and the ball of light
vanished
as my poor wife bolted up with my hand still holding her hair. I told
her what
had just happened and in a calm voice she said its ok it was a spirit.
My wife
has always been sensitive to spirits and I have never paid much
attention to
her stories about them until now. That was my first and last (to date)
experience
with anything alien or paranormal. After it left I felt calm and after
talking
with my wife about it was able to fall right back asleep with no worry
or
anxiety. I do not know what this was or what it wanted. I do not know
if it was
harmless or evil. I like to think harmless but gee it plays ruff by
paralyzing
me doesnt it? Lol. Just thought I would share. I hope this is the first
and
last experience i ever have. Sometimes people are better off not
knowing about
things until they are ready. And we wont be ready in this world. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 2004, I was stationed at Camp Foster, Okinawa,
Japan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lived in barraks 473<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At the time i never really believed or had
any kind of experience with ghosts or paranormal activity, nor did I
have any
interest in that kind of stuff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day
I had building duty, where i had to stay up for 24 hours and get maybe
2 hours
of sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had gone to my room at 0100
to get some sleep and i had set an alarm to wake me up at 0300.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember the air being very clear that
night, which A: is odd for Okinawa, Japan and B: is even more unsual
for a
rainy day in Okinawa, Japan. I remember in my "dream" I was watching
myself sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did nothing more then
watch myself what seemed like hours (which is strange for a dream).<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>On occasion I looked around and even opened a
drawer where i had wires and rope stored. Then i continued to watch
myself
sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know it was me, but i know it
wasnt my body i was in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually i
moved closer to my body and these dark evil-looking hands came up and
reached
towards my sleeping body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>at the moment
they had touched me i woke up immediatly, looked at the clock and right
then
the alarm went off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then grabbed my
stuff and left that room as fast as i could.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I dont know if that would be paranormal or if it would be an
outter body
experince, but it happened every night for almost a week.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was so traumatized by it that I talked to a
Japanese (english speaking) religious figure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He told me many things, and i was still unsure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I experienced many other events that i can
not explain, including my bathtub plugged and overflowing, (i had no
head mate
or room mate), and also my sink often turning on and off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>lights flickering almost every night around
2000 hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I eventually left the island
and have recently returned for my 3rd duty station.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sure enough i was outside a building with a
few others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not know any of them
but i tried to make small talk with them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One of them lives in my old room, which I found very eery.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>He explained to me some unusual things in
that room, none of which he can give reason to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also said there is still no one living in the neightboring
room due
to the rotten smell, and unsafe conditions.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal">By:blbowles2000@hotmail.com<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">we moved into our dream farm home around beginning
of
october of last year. its big and plenty a rooom inside and outside for
our
growing family. the first night was uneventful. me, my husband and our
daughter
who was about four months old at the time went straight to bed. the
next day my
husband woke early for work and classes. later on that day i lefy my
daughter
downstairs since i left the diapers upstairs. as i was in the hallway
about to
come downstairs. i heard my daughter laughing and what sounded like a
male
voice talking to her. i came down asking my husband how was class and
if he was
going to heading to work. when i rounded the corner and just say my
daughter on
the living room floor where i left her alone. she was giggling as if
someone
was ticking her.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a
week after i was
walking around outside looking at the buildings and figuring out what
needed to
be done around here when out of the corner of my eye i saw someone
standing in
the doorway of the barn. i told my husband about it later and he
shrugged it
off. that same night as i was washing dishes i glanced up out of the
corner of
my eye and saw someone walk by the window. i dropped the pan and yelled
for my
husband, told him what i saw and he handed me the baby as he went out
to look
for whoever. when he came back in i told him that when he walked by the
window
wasnt the same as what i saw. he asked what did it look like then and i
told
him more of a reflection like someone walked behind me in th room. he
went on a
hunt checking the rest of the house ( which there has been incidents
over a
dozen times) that this is needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">we heard a little kid call out mommy. he has been
hit from
behind when coming down the stairs. and recently we have an electric
heater
upstairs, one day my husband had went and unplugged it since our
daughter was
near it crawling on the floor, later on during naptime, i had plugged
it back
in and turn it on so me and her could take a nap. i woke up about 20
minutes or
so and found the heater unplugged and the cord actually wrapped around
it. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunted By Shadow Dogs !!!<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By:lashgirl66@hotmail.com <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I would like to share this true story with you
guys, its
something that still bothers me until today !!! This happened many
years ago,
but I believe this was so bad, that it still has a profound affect on
my life
even today, forty one years later !!! When I was a little girl, I was
no older
then four or five years old when this horrible haunting began. I was an
only
child, and I was the daughter of older parents, and to my knowledge,
they were
not religious at all! My father was an atheist, and he was teaching me
from an
early age, that there was no such thing as ghosts or angels or even god
himself. My mom was right behind my father in his beliefs, but I think
she at
least believed in God, but never talked about it, but she definitely
was not a
religious woman by all means! I was a very well cared for child, and my
parents
were good people, who treated me well, so I was not an emotionally
abused child
or neglected in anyway. I remember having these horrible nightmares
every
single night, and I call them nightmares because, this is what my
parents
believed they were, but to me, they were real, because they would take
place
right before I would doze off to sleep. I remember these grayish, black
looking
hounds, they were always in a pack, and they had reddish amber eyes
that
glowed. These shadow dogs would always be growling at me with foam
around their
mouths. I remember their bodies were transparent like in form, and you
could
see through them as if they were ghosts. I remember most of their
features were
dulled, but some of their features were solid, but they were always
baring
their teeth and snarling at me. There was at least always five or six
of them
in my room at once! when they appeared, I always had this absolutely
horrible
sense of fear, beyond description ! I would be absolutely paralyzed
with this
horrible fear of impending death ! I remember being so frightened that
I would
hardly breathe because I did not want them to hear me. I also
distinctly
remember the scent of wet stone, like the scent of an old damp grave
yard when
they were around me in my room. I remember seeing them at the foot of
my bed, pacing
menacingly, back and forth, back and forth, from one side of the room
to the
next, growling at a low and slow guttural deep unearthly growl. I would
try and
scream for my mom, but they were some how able to keep me from
screaming, and
sometimes I would just lay there paralyzed, as they were snapping at my
ankles
and trying to bite me. I could hear them under my bed. They would try
and
communicate with me, not by speaking but in a telepathic type of way.
They
would show me different ways that I could die. I remember they would
try to
pull me toward a black mass in the corner of my room. This mass was
like a dark
tunnel. I would be in a semi unconscious state when they would try and
pull me
in. I remember trying to kick my legs, and move my arms to try and
fight them
off, but I was completely paralyzed. It would seem like time stood
still as
they threatened me non stop, until finally some how I was able to
scream out
loud and my mom would come running into my room, and turn the light on,
and I
would be crying frantically and drenched in sweat ! I remember finally,
my mom
began sleeping in my room with me on a regular basis, because these so
called
nightmares became worse to the point I would cry hysterically and beg
my mom
not to leave because the shadow dogs were trying to kill me. I remember
feeling
tremendous guilt for needing my mom to sleep with me in my bed. This
had became
the norm, where my mom would have to sleep with me, and when I would
finally
fall asleep she would sneak back to bed with my father. I remember
feeling as
though I was a terrible child, because I was causing my parents so much
grief,
because of my fear of the shadow dogs was frightening the life out of
me! This
awful haunting went on for about three years, and then became less and
less as
I kept telling myself this isn&#8217;t real, and I would tell them to go
away, to the
point it finally stopped. The fear never went away completely, but some
how I
figured out a way to dismiss it, as though it doesn&#8217;t exist. I will
never be
sure why they were after me, but I can tell you that what I experienced
was
real. I can say that it would happen when I was in and out of
consciousness,
but Its like they would attack me when I was close to going to sleep,
maybe
because my defenses were down, I don&#8217;t know, and I may never know, but
I pray
that I never see them again ! If there is anyone else out there that
has had
similar experiences with shadow dogs or shadow hounds, or whatever you
want to
call them, I would like to know. If anyone knows what these entities
are, I
would love to know ! <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Ghostly Experience<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>d.xavier14@btinternet.com <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This a true account of something I experienced a
few years
ago in this<span style="">&nbsp; </span>bungalow. I think I could
say I have an open mind about ghosts and<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>hauntings, but until this happened I was sceptical about such
things.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, this really made me
think.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What happened made me
appreciate
the paranormal incidents that<span style="">&nbsp; </span>happened
to my grandmother, my Uncle Maelg, and Auntie Gwen, all very<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>sensible, well educated and grounded people,
and all under different<span style="">&nbsp; </span>circumstances in
different places.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Around eleven
o'clock
one night, I heard a strong rat-tat-tat on wood,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>somewhere
close to me in the bungalow. It was
latew and I was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>convinced they were
being made by someone larking about outside, since<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>there is a pub fairly nearby. I forgot about
it until about a month<span style="">&nbsp; </span>later when it
happened again in exactly the same way. It seemed to me<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>there was someone banging on the wood of the
front door; maybe someone<span style="">&nbsp; </span>urgently
needing to draw my attention. But this time the taps were<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>louder and even more urgent than the first
time. I cautiously opened<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the door and
peeped outside, but there was no one to be seen. The<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>following time it happened, I peeped out
through the side of the bay<span style="">&nbsp; </span>window from
inside a darkened room. I saw no one there, I saw no one leave.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My husband is totally deaf in one ear,
and
sleeps on his 'good ear'.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He is
usually
asleep by 9.30 p.m. so he wouldn&#8217;t have heard it,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>especially
since the knocking didn't begin
until about 11 o'clock. On<span style="">&nbsp; </span>occasions it
occurred later as well, and one time it was in the early<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>hours of the morning about 5 a.m. When I told
him about it, he said he<span style="">&nbsp; </span>didn't think it
was anything for me to worry about!!! I must say that<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>after several times, I began to question my
own hearing, and my<span style="">&nbsp; </span>sanity, because by
now I was kind of expecting it. By several weeks<span style="">&nbsp; </span>later,
it really had begun to bother me. Then
I became jumpy and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>startled at every
little noise at any time of day.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our
front security light flashes on when even a cat crosses the<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>garden, but no light ever accompanied those
knocks, so there was no<span style="">&nbsp; </span>physical body
outside causing it. I queried whether the wind was<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>affecting the light sensor, because that
happens when the wind is<span style="">&nbsp; </span>high, but I
checked that, and there was no wind. Louder knocking<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>started to happen at intervals of a few days,
and then it began to<span style="">&nbsp; </span>occur more often.
By this time I was waiting nervously for it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, it happened for two consecutive days, and this was
always about
the time I was going to bed.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
first I
had tried to dismiss the knocking, thinking it could be the<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>water pipes. I checked them out; it wasn&#8217;t
the pipes. I checked to see<span style="">&nbsp; </span>if the cats
were playing around in the kitchen, but they both always<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>were asleep and quiet each time I looked in
on them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>couldn&#8217;t
find a reason for had now become
annoying as well as<span style="">&nbsp; </span>frightening. I had
become nervous because I had failed to find a<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>cause. I was brought up to look for a reason for anything I
couldn&#8217;t<span style="">&nbsp; </span>understand. My father promised
there would
always be a reason if I searched for it. Well, I did search, and there
was no
reason!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I mentioned this casually to
someone who passed the story on to his<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&#8216;psychic&#8217; partner (not a medium). At my request she went into
some<span style="">&nbsp; </span>kind of trance to see what she could
discover
for me. She told me that<span style="">&nbsp; </span>this was
definitely the paranormal activity of a little boy from<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>around 1900, who had died at around this
particular time of year, in<span style="">&nbsp; </span>this area.
She said he didn&#8217;t know he was dead, and that I was to help<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>him, rescue him, and tell him, very gently,
that he had died.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She said there was
nothing to fear from the child. He had chosen to<span style="">&nbsp; </span>come
here looking for help, and had been
drawn by the light that is<span style="">&nbsp; </span>always left
on at night in the bathroom in the middle of the bungalow.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She said he needed to be &#8216;rescued&#8217;. He was,
she said, about 10 years<span style="">&nbsp; </span>old,
fair-haired, dressed in breeches and a white shirt &#8211; and totally<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>lost and frightened.. She said he was
knocking on our door with a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>wooden toy
in order to get attention for help, which is why the noise<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>was always so loud and urgent. Although
apparently from a well-off<span style="">&nbsp; </span>home, he had
been ill-used in his lifetime, and appeared here because<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>he needed help. She said he had probably
lived on this spot, either in<span style="">&nbsp; </span>this house
or in the wooden structure that was here previously, and this was the
only
familiar place he knew.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This psychic
person advised me on how to do a &#8216;rescue&#8217;. I didn&#8217;t like<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the idea of doing this. I felt self-conscious
about it, but by now I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was desperate for
the noises to stop, and I was ready to try anything.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>So that he didn't become frightened, I was
to tell him gently that he<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was dead,
assure him that there was a lot of love waiting for him over<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>the &#8216;other side&#8217;, and that he would not have
to meet any of those<span style="">&nbsp; </span>people who had
ill-used him when he lived here. I was to impress upon<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>him not to be upset that I was telling him he
had died.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When I told the psychic
that
the bathroom light was always left on at<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>night, she said the lost soul was probably trying to get to the<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8216;light&#8217;. I was to tell him to think of the
person he loved the most,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and this very
thought would bring the person he loved to come to fetch<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>him and take him by the hand into the &#8216;light&#8217;.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To be honest, the thought of talking to 'a
ghost' scared me, so one<span style="">&nbsp; </span>night I thought
I&#8217;d practise it first to make sure that I would do it<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>properly on 'the night'. I felt silly talking
to thin air on my own in<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the middle of
the hall, but by now, I was willing to do anything to<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>get rid of the noise, as I had begun to
question the reality of it<span style="">&nbsp; </span>all. So, I
said my piece, and went to bed.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Anyway,
the loud banging stopped that night, on December 17th, 2001,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>straight after I &#8216;spoke&#8217; to the little
&#8216;visitor&#8217;.
(I have since named him George.) It had occurred about 12 &#8211;14 times
over a
period of 3 months.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was more than
delighted that my rescue effort had obviously worked,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and pleasantly surprised that it worked so
quickly. I hoped for<span style="">&nbsp; </span>continued peace here,
and thus it has proved to be.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
sort
of thing happens in fiction or films, or to other people &#8211;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>but not to me! I&#8217;ve never before had such an
experience. I've<span style="">&nbsp; </span>experienced other odd
happenings, like lights going on and off,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>kettles switching on by themselves, clocks jumping off a wall
hook,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>changing television channels with a
battery-less remote control, but I<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>always offered myself an explanation for those.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This had been no figment of my imagination.
I am not that sort of person. It all seemed incredible, and I still
can&#8217;t
believe it happened.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It took me a
while
to forget it, but it no longer happens. It&#8217;s quiet<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>now, but I still don&#8217;t know what to make of
it!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Knowing this truly happened,
suggests that there really IS something<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>after life on earth!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some weeks
later, I was aware of something prodding me in the shoulder<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>while in bed. I contacted the psychic, who
kindly investigated for me<span style="">&nbsp; </span>again. She
said it was another spirit who was looking for the little<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>boy. This second entity was called 'the old
woman of the woods' who<span style="">&nbsp; </span>healed sick
animals, and she had been caring for this little lost boy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was upset she could no longer find him
and came looking for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The old lady
was known as the local animal healer. This bungalow is<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>actually built on a field named Gallows
Meadow, where many prisoners<span style="">&nbsp; </span>from the
gaol that was once across the road were hanged years ago. I<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>was advised to tell her what had happened to
the
little boy and ask<span style="">&nbsp; </span>her not to prod me
any more because it was upsetting me. I did this, and in several years
since, I
have never felt another prod.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This a
true account of something I experienced a while ago in this bungalow. I
think I
could say I have an open mind about ghosts and hauntings,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and until this happened I was inclined to be
a little sceptical about<span style="">&nbsp; </span>such things.
However, this made me think.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
happened has made me able to appreciate the paranormal incidents<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>that happened to my grandmother, and Uncle
Maelg, under different<span style="">&nbsp; </span>circumstances and
in different places.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By:spirit33399@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">hello, my name is Robert Hollis and i would like
to to share
a paranormal experience with you if i may, so here it is and well, i
guess if
you should have any questions please feel free to contact me here
Today, being
Halloween and all, I decided to share my paranormal experience that
happened to
me aobut almost 12 years ago now as I thought it might Be a little more
entertaining considering the time of year and all. Well at the time
period, I
was still traveling around the country as a surveyor doing this that or
another
here and there and it was impractical for me to keep a place here in
Texas as I
was home maybe like a few weeks at a time then, well when I did come
home it
was usally in December and I would stay at my half sister&#8217;s home, you
know lay
some bucks on them for letting me stay and then be back on the road<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>around January.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
any way, I of course had met various
people in my travels and kept in touch via the<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>by internet chatting on a chat client that I use bullshitting
and such
on there well, it was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>man, I really do
not recall the time but I do know it was very late at night after 12
for sure,
and here the computer was sitting in the front corner of the living
room, a
very large one by the way, and I felt like something ws staring at me,
now the
hall way that entered the living room, was at the opposite end of where
iw s
sitting, it led from the back of the hosue where the bedrooms nd
bathrooms are
set, well, I ws thinking , as I felt someone was looking at me , tat it
ws my
little nephew thinking &#8220;hey, uncle Robert is home its party time!&#8221; lol
well, I
turned and this is what I saw, this all happened in like id say 3
seconds at
most and was very stunning and a bit scary to boot, I turned and I
looked and
where the hall way meets the living room, I seen this, swirling mass of
smoke?
About a foot above the floor swirling, with a diameter of at lest 3
feet and I
knew<span style="">&nbsp; </span>do not ask me how I knew but I
knew, it was very angry and pissed off!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well, it kept swirling then all of the sudden rushed right at
me, making
me jump, tho I do not recall feeling anything, but it damn sure scared
me if
you follow me on thisNow at this moment I did realize<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that something had happened , and no I was
not drunk or under the influence of any drugs or drink at all,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>now of course if I had been I would have
attributed it to that but since it was not I do believe that it was of
a
spiritual nature!Now the next day I did of course ask questions about
the
history of the house as I do feel that there is more to this life then
what we
know or see now in front of us and I did find out that when they,
brother-in-law and sister bought the house that they got it real cheap
, a old
man<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and a woman had sold it so that they
could go off and live in Florida for the rest of their lives but, the
thing was
this, the woman that was with the old man, was the sister of the woman
who had
died there at that home like 6 weeks beforehand! Yeah no shit! So my
theory? It
is this, that obviously the old man and sister was carrying on sometime
before
the older sister died form whatever disease she had, and might have
helped her
right on out if you know what I mean there, and know or possibly knew,
that
there was something going o between the two<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>so when she passed away she was pissed off then as she was in
life and
quiet possibly trapped there in that house by her hurt, anger whatever
was
causing her to be trapped there for god only knows how long, I am by
any means
a authority on such things, and later on after I had left,I did wonder
till
this day,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>sister and bro in law have
divorced<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and no one lives there to my
knowledge ,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>if that woman&#8217;s spirit is
still trapped there to this day? <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Ghost Experience<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By:ups1de_d0wn733@hotmail.com<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hey, I had this experience this Wednesday (January
25th)
that you might be interested in listing on your site. I don't actually
believe
ghosts exist, but I have frequented Shadowlands in the past and I
thought this
might be a nice addition. You can reword it however you like as I'm
just going
to try to tell it in the plainest fashion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I go to school at Holyoke Community College in Holyoke,
Massachusetts.
As a music and theater student, all my classes this semester are in the
Fine
and Performing Arts building (formerly known as the "C" building) on
the first floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Last Wednesday, I had
my first Ensemble Jazz Guitar class in Room 137, directly across from
the only
elevator in the building. The room is set up like a forum with a space
near the
entrance for the teacher and the seats set up on risers. My class
consists of
about eight or nine guitarists and we were all lined up in front of the
teacher. Our teacher was seated at his desk in front of us (a simple
desk, just
four legs and a table so nothing could be hidden under). We'd finished
the
first measure and we'd paused before playing the second for the teacher
to talk
a bit. As he was talking, all the lights in the room shut off. The six
light
switches are in clear view by the door. The class is held fairly late
in the
day and the building is basically deserted. Our teacher then told us
that when
the building was being built, a construction worker named Charlie was
accidentally killed in the elevator shaft. The previous music
department heads,
a married couple, used to swear up and down that a ghost haunted the
music
department. My teacher reported that the elevator doors sometimes open
and
close by themselves and lights go on and off. He then explained that
for the
lights in the room to be on, all the light switches must be up. There
aren't
any other switches in the room, so the lights can only be on if the
switches
are up. He asked all of us in his class if anyone had seen or heard
anyone
enter the room, since we're all seated next to the door. No one had
seen
anyone. My teacher, who sits facing the door, also said he hadn't seen
anyone.
He then got up and flipped all the switches back up and they each came
back on
with no flickering or any sign that the lights were damaged. My teacher
asked
out loud if Charlie would allow us to continue and our class ended with
no
further incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello, I seen this grave site listed on your
haunted places
page in Heard County Georgia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to
high school in Franklin which is the county seat of Heard County.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I just wanted to update you some on this
grave site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This site is truly haunted
by Mayhayley herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a teen we use
to go out to her grave to see if what we heard was true and this is
what would
happen to us.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
night we drove out
there and after getting just so close to her grave site our car stalled
and
would not start back up until it was pulled back away from the grave,
this has
happened to several people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My handicapped
friend graduated from high school and later got married, her husband
was not
from there and did not believe her about the stories so she took him to
her
grave site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What happened to them has
happened to me and many many others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
they drove past the site my friend was talking about Mayhayley and the
things
known of her, he doubted what she said and announced his doubt, he
looked in
the rearview mirror and seen a woman hanging onto the back of the car
flying in
the wind, he asked who it was and my friend turned around and seen her
too, it
was the ghost of Mayhayley.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to
Mayhayley's death it is known that she would sit in her front yard in a
chair
with a galvanized bucket (large) at her side and people would line up
for miles
to get a reading from her, they would drop money into the bucket and
she would
give you a reading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though she did not
give readings of your death as to the exact time and date she would
give
causes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One man did not believe the
reading she gave him and told her she was a fake, she then told him
that he
would die of a heart attack, told him the time and date and just that
happened
to that poor man who was in his 30's when he died of a heart attack.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was said that she would bury the
money in
quart canning jars all around her yard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After her death, there were several people that would try to dig
up her
money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two men went there and while
digging they were talking about Mayhayley, one of them knew her and the
other
knew of her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man that only knew of
her told the other that he was not a believer and that he thought she
was a
fake, at that point he plunged his shovel into the ground again to get
a big
piece of ground and upon doing it he cut off the tip of his foot with
the
shovel and proceeded to bleed to death.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Anyone that proclaims dibelief about her while around her grave
or her
home site ends up either dieing or having a terrible accident.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Mayhayley was truly a mysterious lady and
also at the same time was a remarkable woman in her time. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunted Farmhouse<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>mixmasterm2005@yahoo.com<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Alright its been a while since I posted one of my
experiences with the supernatural. Last year my mom and I moved to
Augusta,
Maine to live with my step0father and his daughter. I was told we were
gonna be
living in an old farmhouse that is dated back to mid 1800s and has had
a lot of
residents. I was thinking it was gonna be a big place but I found out
it
wasn't. I told my stepfather I could see spirits which he thought was
interesting. I was just glad he didn't think I was some mental case. He
gave me
a heads up.that there was a ghost of a farmer that once lived there and
his son
once saw him walking up the stairs. Already I was excited to see what
else I
could find in that house. After settling in and getting used to the
place I
figured i'd go spirit hunting. I had heard another story from my
stepfather
that when my mom's ex was visiting(he and my stepfather are cousins) he
went
into the cellar and had the light mysteriously turned off on him.
Nobody was
near the light switch at the time and him being afraid of the dark he
ran up
the stairs. He told my stepfather about it and he told him it might
have been
his deceased wife who died that year on Valentines Day. She didn't like
him
when she was alive and was most likely playing a prank on him. When I
was down
there I really didn't see anything and went back upstairs and looked
around the
place with no luck. One night when everyone was sleeping I was in my
room on
the computer. I looked out into the living room to see a small shadow
figure of
a woman looking into my room and walking around the living room. I knew
it was
my stepfathers deceased wife from seeing pictures of her. Her ashes are
in the
living room since her dying wish was to be home. She was most likely
just
looking over the place and going from room to room checking on
everything. One
day I was able to catch a lone white orb floating around followed by a
white
figure which looked like an old woman with scraggly hair. I always
updated my
stepfather with anything I found and he told me one day when he was
going
through the kitchen one of the cupboard doors opened by itself and he
wanted me
to find more. So I called my best friend up since we've always been
able to see
more stuff when we're together not to mention call out a lot of spirits
when we
wanted them to appear. He was excited to jump on it and came over the
next day.
We used our energy to search all the rooms downstairs. Sadly we had
nothing
since there was too many people around. We both were sensing some stuff
down in
the cellar and went down there to investigate. We kept the light off
and walked
down the stairs as my stepfather closed the door and locked it so no
animals
would get down there. We started pusing our energy out into different
parts of
the cellar trying to get the attention of any spirits plus try talking
with
them. Already we had brought out the old lady I saw before who was
walking
around. We tried communicating wiuth her with no luck. My best friend
turned
around to look at me and told me not to move because behind me was a 7
foot
figure behind me with brood shoulders and seemed to be wearing an old
fasioned
suit. I told him it was either the farmer or a priest that once lived
in the
house according to neighbors. We took a break and went upstairs to tell
of our
findings then went back down. We pushed our energy into a small area in
the
cellar and to our surprise a pink figure came out stoppping in front of
us then
came a little closer before running around the corner and disappearing.
Obviously the spirits knew they were noticed and disappeared. I told
them
though that I would be here to stay and have no problem with them being
there.
I also brought up I wasn't here to harm them and that if they needed to
communicate with me they could. I told my stepfather about the pink
figure and
he told me the priest that lived there kept small animals down there
and we
most likely saw one of his pigs. My best friend left really impressed
what we
saw and wanted to come back again. During my stay there we never heard
the last
of my stepfathers ex wife who was seen by mom. She saw a figure walking
towards
the front door outside which was where she liked to be when she was
alive. My
stepfather also saw her as he woke up one morning near the window
looking after
him. She did communicate with us once by moving a wind chime we kept in
the
living room. It had an angel on it and whenever my stepfather mentioned
doing
any changes to the farmhouse tha this ex wife wanted him to do when she
was
alive she would make the wind chime move in approval. One night when I
was
brushing my teeth I felt something poke the back of my neck to the
point where
it hurt a little. I was thinking something was gonna appear in the
mirror with
no luck and the pain disappeared when I turned around. No clue on what
it was.
Not to mention when I was down cleaning the cellar out with my
stepfather
something kept tugging the back of my shirt. Either a spirit was trying
to get
my attention or play a prank. After that I really didn't experience too
much. I
ended up getting married and moving back right next to my hometown to
an
apartment complex where i've experienced stuff along with my life.
That's a
story for another time. For now thank you for letting me share this and
i'm
sorry for the length of it.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunted Doll<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>toddb29@hotmail.com<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When I was about 5 years old I was at my cousins
house with
my brother and sister. The three of us were playing in my cousins room
along
with my cousin. I really don't remember what we were doing at the time
(coloring I think) but we were called to come for dinner. Everyone
jumped up
and went out of the room except for me. I wanted to finish up what ever
it was
I was doing. In my cousins room she had a good sized plastic doll that
sat at a
desk similar to a school desk but on a smaller scale. For some reason I
had
this strong urge to look at the doll. When I did I got the scare of my
life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the dolls arms was pointing
up in the air. I saw the arm move down, the head turned to look at me
and the
plastic eyelids started opening and closing so fast I could hear them
clicking!
The doll was next to the doorway to get out of the room so I had to run
past it
to get out of there. I got up and ran out of the room as fast as I
could and
was scared out of my wits! I told everyone what I had seen but no one
believed
me. I didn't go back in the room for the rest of the time we were there
that
day. This really did happen. I have no reason to make it up. I am 51
years old
now and remember it like it was yesterday.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only other spooky thing that has happened to me is having
the
feeling of an evil presence in the room with me. I was reading the
bible at the
time while I was in bed. I started getting<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the feeling I was not alone and it was evil. I started praying
for it to
leave me alone and the feeling faded away. All of this is the truth so
you may
as well believe it. There are things going on around us that sometimes
we just
don't understand. I am still afraid of dolls! <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In Addition to New Hartford High School in NYS <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By: smk429@gmail.com<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hello. I wanted to add to the info about New
Hartford High
School in NYS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am a former student and
also participated in sports. One summer(I believe it was 2004), my
cheerleading
team had practice outside. At the time they had been doing some
construction so
the normally open outdoor facilities had been closed. I really had to
go ad the
only bathroom open was the girls room in the 11th grade hallway.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I had gone in and sat down. Suddenly I felt
an eerie feeling and it got very cold, mind you it was summer and very
hot. I
had all of the sudden felt the urge to run like hell and get out. I
don't think
I even flushed, yanked my pants up and ran down the stairs that come
out by the
office as fast as I could. As I ran I could hear footsteps following me
and
felt like I was wing chased out. I was so shaken up I ended up calling
my m to
take me home. I was terrified to go in to school alone.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A year or so later I found out it was an old
Indian burial ground. I can to this day vividly remember the incident.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If only your company was around when I was 9 years
old.. I
am now 46 years old and my memories of this home are still fresh in my
mind..
This home is in Keaukaha hilo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
remember my mother looking through the Hilo News Paper trying to find
us a big
place to live when she had gotten so excited about this 4 bedroom home
that was
renting for just $200, which was unheard of! Thinking it would have
been
already rented, a lady answered and said come and see it, its yours.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>What! Happily we rushed down to see it and it
was more than perfect, it was across the beach and the house was big
and I got
the biggest room. Now, it was only day&#8217;s; maybe a week that I started
hearing
noises, but at 9 years old, ghost was far from my mind and I went about
my days
(2-3 months of it).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This house was being
haunted by a little girl who only seemed to haunt girls and not boys;
she was a
jealous ghost and didn&#8217;t like people in her room (my room). She would
pull my
hair and MANY times give me a shove.. she would purposely get me in
trouble
with my mother about a messy room.. I would clean it and come back to
stuff
flown all over the place???<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I caught a
glimpse of this trouble maker on my way home from school on the school
bus as
it past by my house. She would be standing in the window as if to be
waiting
for us to come home.. That day when I saw her the bus driver said
&#8220;someone is
home?&#8221; with a smile on his face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
that day I wouldn&#8217;t go into the home until my mother got home from work.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember when my dog ran away from home..
He would come inside at night, but after a week he would claw at the
door to be
let out and run far from the house.. I remember tying him to his chain
near our
tree and he would literally hide behind it as if to be hiding from
someone???<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After awhile when our god
would run away from us, he wouldn&#8217;t come to us when we would call to
him&#8230; as if
he knew we were taking back home&#8230; I never saw him again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Over time the haunting would get worse. The
Day We Left!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were in the living room
watching TV (evening) when the window in the dinning room started
shaking; my
mother told me to go up there (second floor) and fix it.. Reluctantly I
went up
there and it suddenly stopped on its own, as I turned to walk away it
shook
with a vengeance and then ALL the windows including the one I saw the
little
girl in shook so hard it was very loud!!! There was no wind and very
still
outside and the neighbors dogs could not stop barking&#8230; we ran from the
house
leaving our things behind..We tried many times to get movers to pack
our things
but no one would go into the home; we eventually had to pack stuff up
ourselves
making sure to leave the home before dark.<o:p></o:p></p>
