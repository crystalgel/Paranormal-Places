<p><b><font size=+1>My Story My parent's house</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Sonya532@myTalk.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I wanted to tell you stories from when I was younger.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Now I know my parent's house is haunted, we just don't know
by whom or</b>
<br><b>what!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; When I was smaller I remember hearing chairs being moved
around while</b>
<br><b>everybody was in bed. I was never scared, but I would go look to
see if</b>
<br><b>anyone was there, but there never was.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; We were all use to it by then and it never bothered anyone.
Later my</b>
<br><b>Aunt's told me when they were younger they had stayed the night
with my</b>
<br><b>parent's, and were woken up by someone in the middle of the night.
They</b>
<br><b>said it was a man in white, who had come out of my parent's room
and</b>
<br><b>went into the backroom. They were so scared that they ran to my
parent's</b>
<br><b>to tell them. My Dad got up to check and noone was there. The weird</b>
<br><b>thing is, in the backroom there is the attic.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Well as we got older the more we heard.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I had a baby when I was 14. My older brother by then had
made his room</b>
<br><b>in that backroom.&nbsp; One night while he was out I heard a baby
crying.</b>
<br><b>Assuming it was my little boy I went into my room and he was asleep.
So</b>
<br><b>I went back in and continued to watch T.V. Again I heard a baby
crying,</b>
<br><b>but this time it was coming from that backroom. I was so scared
I went</b>
<br><b>to bed and left the T.V. on.&nbsp;&nbsp; My parent's never believed
me and neither</b>
<br><b>did my brother's or my sister.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Now we are all grown up and to this day when I visit I can
feel</b>
<br><b>something there but it don't scare me, I think I am more comfortable</b>
<br><b>with it knowing it is there!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; It is real protective and we can tell.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; My little brother just got involved with a girl he really
likes, but</b>
<br><b>whatever is in that house don't like her. She says one night when
she</b>
<br><b>was doing dishes she felt someone walk up behind her and look over
her</b>
<br><b>shoulder. Assuming it was my brother she turned around and found
noone</b>
<br><b>there so she screamed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; A couple of weeks later they were walking by the refrigerator.
(Well</b>
<br><b>my parent's keep games and stuff up there and they're pretty steady)&nbsp;
As</b>
<br><b>she walked past it all the games jumped off of there and almost
hit her.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; And to this day all of my cousin's and Aunt's won't stay in
that</b>
<br><b>house. Even when they visit they will not go into the house alone.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The reason my cousin's won't is because they saw him. They
said he was</b>
<br><b>a young kid that dressed all scraggly.&nbsp; He had long blonde
hair.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>believe them because they never knew anything about the house til
then.</b>
<br><b>My Aunt's never told them because they thought it would scare them.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; My parent's live by a canal, and that's where my cousins
were when</b>
<br><b>they saw him walk into the house.&nbsp; They said the kid just walked
right</b>
<br><b>in like he had a key. But after he went in he never came out!&nbsp;&nbsp;
They</b>
<br><b>went to the house to check, but found noone. The back door is close
to</b>
<br><b>the front door so they would have spotted him coming out. And back
then</b>
<br><b>our windows didn't even open in the bedrooms.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I just wonder who he is and what he wants. We have tried</b>
<br><b>to get the history on the house, but all we know is that an older
couple</b>
<br><b>use to live there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for listening to my
story</b><b></b>

<br><b><font size=+1>&nbsp;Haunted Trailer</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Mike88811@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>This happened when I was about 6.&nbsp; We lived in New Jersey.&nbsp;
My father had</b>
<br><b>gotten a job in Deleware working for a Power-inlight Co.&nbsp; He
had bought a</b>
<br><b>small trailer in a trailer park.&nbsp; An elderly woman had died
in the house of</b>
<br><b>old age, sitting in a rocking chair stroking her cat.&nbsp; She
died on July 27,</b>
<br><b>1985.&nbsp; That was two years before my father moved in.&nbsp;
Of course, my mother</b>
<br><b>and me would visit him whenever we had the chance.&nbsp; One night,
my mother had</b>
<br><b>to go take care of her grandmother, who had suffered of a stroke
the week</b>
<br><b>before.&nbsp; She got my godfather Steve to bring me to my father.&nbsp;
We arrived on</b>
<br><b>June 12.&nbsp; My goddfather talked to my father explaining the
situation and left</b>
<br><b>soon after.&nbsp; He put the T.V. in the master bedroom for me to
watch (which was</b>
<br><b>the only bedroom.)&nbsp; I accepted the offer and lay on the bed,
watching</b>
<br><b>Nickelodeon.&nbsp; Soon at around 5:00 Are you Afraid of The Dark
came on.</b>
<br><b>Natrually, me being 6, I felt scared and went under the covers.&nbsp;
I discovered</b>
<br><b>a children's book and looked through it using the little sunlight
that went</b>
<br><b>through a hole in the blanket.&nbsp; When I neared the end, I began
smelling</b>
<br><b>something foul.&nbsp; It smelled like a mix of rotten eggs and little
puppies.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>covered my mouth and coughed.&nbsp; Then I noticed I heard a scratching
sound on</b>
<br><b>the blankets.&nbsp; I called out "Daddy?".&nbsp; When he didn't
answer I became scared.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;After several minutes I found the courage to peep through
the hole.&nbsp; What I</b>
<br><b>saw gives me nightmares to this day.&nbsp; It was an elderly woman
with stringy</b>
<br><b>white hair, with bits of dirt in her hair.&nbsp; She was transparent.&nbsp;
Without</b>
<br><b>thinking I emerged from my hiding place.&nbsp; She seemed to see
me.&nbsp; She looked</b>
<br><b>like she was trying to speak, but only hissing sounds came.&nbsp;
I, being a good</b>
<br><b>lip-reader, knew what she has saying.&nbsp; It looked like "Here,
Margeret!"&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>wasn't sure who "Margeret" was.&nbsp; Then she took her hand and
pointed a finger</b>
<br><b>at me.&nbsp; Her nail was logn and twisted.&nbsp; She seemed to
be angry, and vanished</b>
<br><b>from sight after.&nbsp; She didn't fade away, just one second she
was there, and</b>
<br><b>the enxt, gone.&nbsp; I ran from my room to my father.&nbsp; He
told me it was my</b>
<br><b>imagination but when I asked who "Margeret" was and that the woman
was</b>
<br><b>calling that name, he looked terrified.&nbsp; He told me Margeret
was the name of</b>
<br><b>the cat!&nbsp; He said a young man found the cat and took her to
keep.&nbsp; That</b>
<br><b>night, when I was just about to sleep, I smelled the foul smell
again.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>quickly turned.&nbsp; I couldn't speak for a while, but she was
mouthing the same</b>
<br><b>thing.&nbsp; After a while, I said something.&nbsp; "A guy took
your cat!" I yelled.</b>
<br><b>She looked at me.&nbsp; Then she slowly glided towards me, angry.&nbsp;
"He lives in</b>
<br><b>the old trailer over there!" I pointed out the window.&nbsp; She
stopped and</b>
<br><b>disappeared.&nbsp; I ran to my father and we slept in the car the
rest of the</b>
<br><b>night.&nbsp; The next day we noticed police officials by the old
trailer where the</b>
<br><b>young man lived.&nbsp; We asked what happened and a police officer
said, "A man</b>
<br><b>who lived here disappeared last night.&nbsp; All we found were some
cat's old</b>
<br><b>bones."&nbsp; I knew what truly happened, but didn't say anything.&nbsp;
After a while</b>
<br><b>my dad quit his job and sold the trailer to people from Pennslyvania.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>moved with us and now works with DuPont.&nbsp; I will never forget
what happened</b>
<br><b>in the Haunted Trailer.&nbsp; I am 19 now, and I still have nightmares
about it.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for your time.</b><b></b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Strange Happenings</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ColorMeBlue228@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Well, I don't know if you would really call it haunting or imagination,
or is</b>
<br><b>it just my mind playing tricks on me.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I want to start with one sunny afternoon, I decided that I should
go down</b>
<br><b>into the basement or den, which ever you like to call it, to water
my plants.</b>
<br><b>(Now you must know that the house that I live in was once my grandparents</b>
<br><b>house.) Anyway, as I walked downstairs to the windowsill, I smelled
something</b>
<br><b>that I only remember my grandmother always having on. Vicks!! Yes,
Vicks. I'm</b>
<br><b>sure you that you all heard of that medication. I know, I know,
it sounds</b>
<br><b>funny to smell Vicks, I have heard people say that they smell roses
or</b>
<br><b>grandpa's old pipe, but yes it was most fimiliar smell that I can
remember</b>
<br><b>her having on. If I would of smelled anything else, I wouldn't of
thought</b>
<br><b>that it would be her. When she was alive, everyday I can remember
her using</b>
<br><b>that cream a lot. Back to the story: It was a very strong smell,
I mean, it</b>
<br><b>was as if she was right in front of me. I yelled out to my mother
in</b>
<br><b>excitement "Grandma's here!" As I walked again to the same area
where I had</b>
<br><b>smelled it before, it was gone. Now of course I must tell you, we
don't have</b>
<br><b>any Vicks in the house.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Now you tell me, I think that it might have been her. Maybe she was
visiting,</b>
<br><b>or checking up on he house, seeing what was doing, who knows.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Uncle in Chicago</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gingericekreme@davyjones.zzn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hi! i have been reading your page of true stories
and i think i have</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a story that may interest you. last year in november
my family went</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to chicago to hang out and visit my uncle who
was dying from</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leukemia. it was the first time i had met him
since he saw me when i</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was a baby. he was very warm and his grandson-(
my cousin) was the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sweetest little boy i had ever met. he obviously
loved his 'opa'</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; immensly and my heart went out to him knowing
he would loose my</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uncle. we left and flew back home...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a few mos. later i was asleep and suddenly jolted
awake- i opened my</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eyes to a full moon right outside my window and
was startled for a</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moment. i did not know why i woke up- however
i did a very strange</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thing. i sat up in bed and stared out the window
and smiled. i was</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elated and not the slightest bit tired. i didn't
know WHY i was so</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happy- i just smiled and said thank you. then
fell asleep. i couldn't</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; explain why i spoke or why i was awakened, the
next morning, and i</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; went to school as usual. that afternoon i came
home and my mother</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; informed me that her father had called and told
her that my uncle had</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; died in his sleep. i asked when and she said
that it had been that</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; night/ into early morning. i think that when
he died was when i woke</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up- and maybe that is why i said 'thank you'.
i still don't know.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Poppy</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Eri2309@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi! My story is about my grandfather, who died in 1996, and my husband,
who</b>
<br><b>Poppy didn't get the chance to get to know while he was alive.&nbsp;
My husband,</b>
<br><b>who was my boyfriend at the time, was working as a driver in 1998,
driving a</b>
<br><b>truck a little bigger than the kind UPS uses. He and his partner
were driving</b>
<br><b>down the highway, admittedly faster than they should've been, going
about 85</b>
<br><b>mph. Suddenly, a car cut them off short, and he braked and swerved
to avoid</b>
<br><b>hitting this car. He lost control of the truck and careened off
the road,</b>
<br><b>hitting a railing. the cop who came to the scene told them they
should have</b>
<br><b>been dead in an accident like that. Both my husband and his friend
came out</b>
<br><b>of it without so much as a scratch! I always believed Poppy was
watching over</b>
<br><b>the family, so one day as I was sitting in the living room with
my mother (</b>
<br><b>his daughter), just in case he was there with them that day, I said
a silent</b>
<br><b>thank you to him for protecting my husband. As soon as the thought
was</b>
<br><b>finished, my mom looked up from what she was reading and said "You're</b>
<br><b>welcome. Anyone you love, I love." Poppy spoke through my mom to
let us know</b>
<br><b>that he's still watching &amp; protecting us.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>San Diego Haunts...</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; grammaval@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Visiting San Diego during a time of personal distress in my life
may have made me a perfect target for ghosts, and there are a couple of
places not mentioned above where I had strange experiences.</b>
<br><b>In Oceanside is a restaurant called Hunter's Steak House which is
built over a cemetery but bodies weren't disinterred and reburied (no respect
for the dead buried there).&nbsp; Apparently some of them are a little
angry and haunt the restaurant and environs either in search of peace or
retribution.&nbsp; The only experience I had was a feeling of being watched
by invisible eyes, and a hand brushing across my shoulders as if someone
were passing behind my chair.&nbsp; No one was there, at least no one visible.&nbsp;
Not a threatenting feeling at all.&nbsp; (Side note, great food, great
service, and great ghost stories when explaining experience to server.&nbsp;
Seems many employees have had lots of different experiences and are very
willing to share them.</b>
<br><b>Another place is in San Diego's Old Town State Historical Park,
a beautiful and peaceful place.&nbsp; Several of these buildings are a
bit odd (and a stone's throw from El Fandango Restaurant - never saw "her",
and about 2 blocks from the Thomas Whaley House).&nbsp; Let's start with
Whaley House - the Dept of Commerce named it America's Most Haunted Site
with good reason.&nbsp; Fascinated with the story of Mr. Whaley and Yankee
Jim Robinson, I visited this house quite a few times.&nbsp; The only scary
feeling was on the 9th through 11 stairs with a feeling of</b>
<br><b>overpowering nausea but I couldn't swallow to force the feeling
down.&nbsp; Not knowing of Mrs. Whaley's incident on the stairs, I thought
nothing of it until later when the docent filled me in.&nbsp; Also, the
garden is really "spooked" too, and while I've seen a small dog just vanish
into thin air it's not a threatening feeling, and the garden is (to me
at least) a place that feels safe, secure, protected and peaceful.&nbsp;
I didn't know about the dog g!!</b>
<br><b>host either until I'd seen it and went back in and asked more questions.&nbsp;
Took lots of photos there and some have very out of place looking light.&nbsp;
Don't know if it's caused by the plexiglass barriers at the entrance to
each room or by something much more interesting.&nbsp; Please adivse if
you'd like photos, I'd be interested in your opinion.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Also not mentioned is the Robinson Rose House, also in Old Town.&nbsp;
May have been a docent, maybe not.&nbsp; Just saw a man in "period" dress
in an upstairs window who disappeared.</b>
<br><b>We're still in Old Town, Casa de Estudillo is very spritually charged.&nbsp;
Well documented by many others, my only experience was a cold spot outside
of one of the rooms.&nbsp; Maybe I was coming down with the crud (or not)
but no illness materialized, but neither did a ghost.&nbsp; Just a freezing
cold spot that put goose flesh all over me - definitely a strange sensation
on an 80 degree day standing in full sunlight.&nbsp; Note of useless trivia
about this place: it was used for filming the outdoor portions of the Disney
series Zorro in the 1950's.So while you're probably well aware of these
hauntings, I was pretty much ignorant of them until after having the experiences
and digging</b>
<br><b>into the "less publicized" history of these places.&nbsp; Again,
probably because I was in a state of personal turmoil.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Sightings of Ghost</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By:soozy57@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, I stumbled upon your web page about apparitions.</b>
<br><b>I myself do not spend that much time thinking about</b>
<br><b>ghosts, but I do remember as a child seeing what I</b>
<br><b>still, to this day, consider a ghost.&nbsp; He reminded me</b>
<br><b>at the time of a soldier, maybe a confederate, I'm not</b>
<br><b>sure (keep in mind, I was probably about 8 years old</b>
<br><b>or so) by his white horse and uniform. His hair was</b>
<br><b>white and tied back like pictures we've seen of George</b>
<br><b>Washington.&nbsp; It was in Waco, Texas, in my back yard.</b>
<br><b>Do you have any history which might explain it?&nbsp; This</b>
<br><b>was just one incident; I really believe that house was</b>
<br><b>haunted.&nbsp; I was constantly seeing things at night;</b>
<br><b>people walking around the halls.&nbsp; I used to crawl in</b>
<br><b>bed with my big sister because I was always so</b>
<br><b>frightened at that house.&nbsp; After we moved I never had</b>
<br><b>another incident like that.&nbsp; I am now 42 years old and</b>
<br><b>just find it very curious; I haven't really thought</b>
<br><b>much about it until now.&nbsp; Email me if&nbsp; you want:</b>

<p><b>this is a story that happened a couple of years ago, we had just
moved into a</b>
<br><b>house that we were renting from some of my parents friends. This
house was</b>
<br><b>really weird , we would here people talking , and here things be
moved and</b>
<br><b>stuff.</b>
<br><b>One night i was pretty sick, my mom was at the store, and my two
sisters were</b>
<br><b>at the store. I decided to lay down and my room was at the end of
the hall</b>
<br><b>way. When i layed down i heard the front door open, and then it
slammed it</b>
<br><b>shut. I thought it was my mom or dad so i layed back down.</b>
<br><b>Then i heard someone walking down the hall way, so i started calling
"mom is</b>
<br><b>that you" noone said anything. Then i saw a man walking down the
hall way,</b>
<br><b>i thought someone had walked in and</b>
<br><b>they heard me yelling so i just sat there</b>
<br><b>because i was sick and scared out of my mind so i couldnt scream.
Then he</b>
<br><b>turned to face the back through the back door. That was the first
time i saw</b>
<br><b>or heard anything.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of weeks later
we were watching my cousin</b>
<br><b>and he fell asleep so we layed him down in his play pin</b>
<br><b>in my moms room. A couple of hours later we heard someone in the
room saying</b>
<br><b>how cute my cousin was and how sweet he looked. It wasnt any of
my family</b>
<br><b>because my two sisters were asleep and we would have saw them if</b>

<br><b><font size=+1>The Ghost that haunts my friend's townhouse</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: abrahaml@mtc1.mid.tec.sc.us</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I'd like to share a ghostly experience I had. About 9 years ago,
I moved</b>
<br><b>into the townhouse of my friend, Elaine. She lives in Tucker, Georgia,
a</b>
<br><b>suburb of Atlanta. On the second night I was there, I awoke suddenly</b>
<br><b>from a sound sleep about 3:00 in the morning, aware that someone
had</b>
<br><b>laid down on the bed beside me. I laid there for several moments
before</b>
<br><b>I opened my eyes, fearing to look. I felt no malice, in fact the
overall</b>
<br><b>sensation was quite pleasureable and sensual. I could feel this
presence</b>
<br><b>leaning toward me, feeling the center of the bed move down a bit
as the</b>
<br><b>entity moved closer to me. Then, I felt a hand gently caress my</b>
<br><b>collarbone and then move down my chest towards my breast. I opened
my</b>
<br><b>eyes in surprise at this, and suddenly the sensation was completely</b>
<br><b>gone. The next morning, I was sitting downstairs with Elaine, drinking</b>
<br><b>coffee, when I said, "I had the strangest dream last night." Elaine</b>
<br><b>began to laugh and she said, "Let me guess...you felt someone lie
down</b>
<br><b>beside you on the bed and start caressing you."&nbsp; I gasped,
"Yes! How did</b>
<br><b>you know?" Elaine replied, "It's a ghost. He shows up every couple
of</b>
<br><b>weeks, he's been doing it since I moved in here." She said the ghost</b>
<br><b>never appeared to her former roommate, but often woke Elaine up
at night</b>
<br><b>with gentle caresses.&nbsp; I felt him on a couple other occasions
during the</b>
<br><b>2 years I roomed with Elaine, and she mentioned his presence at
least 2</b>
<br><b>or 3 times herself during that time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that
Elaine bought</b>
<br><b>her townhouse new in the late 80's. I have no idea what was there
prior</b>
<br><b>to its construction.</b><b></b>

<p><b><font size=+1>The smell of a cigar</font></b>

<p><b>By: khinkle@impop.bellatlantic.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Katie and I have had a recurring "visit".&nbsp;
Visit is the</b>
<br><b>best way I can describe it.&nbsp; When I was born, I only had one</b>

as I can remember at</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Vacation In Kentucky</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: anonymous</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>My husband, and I, and our three, children, were coming back home,
from</b>
<br><b>vacation, in Kentucky, and was on the winding, narrow, roads, of
Ky.,</b>
<br><b>and it was late, night, and it was black, dark, no moon, shining
at all,</b>
<br><b>and we had not seen a house for miles, and All at once, there was
this</b>
<br><b>grown, woman, in a long, pastel, colored, dress, running toward
our car,</b>
<br><b>that our head lights, shined on, she was bloodey, and was holding
her</b>
<br><b>stump of right arm, at elbow, her arm, was gone, and her black,
long</b>
<br><b>hair, was tangled, and blowing back, from her face, as she ran,
she</b>
<br><b>disappeared , down over a mountain side, we searched, and called,
never</b>
<br><b>found, or seen, or heard, a thing, and finally gave up, and traveled,
a</b>
<br><b>little ways, on down, the road, and seen an arm, from elbow, down,</b>
<br><b>laying in the road, we never stopped, till next town, and reported
it to</b>
<br><b>police, they said, they could show us in their books, where this
had</b>
<br><b>been reported before, over a 100 year, span, of time, exactly as
we had</b>
<br><b>seen it, but they would check on it, they called it the ghost, of
this</b>
<br><b>stretch of highway.On many other trips, back there, and coming back,</b>
<br><b>from Ky., we have never been able, to really say, where we were
,on</b>
<br><b>that night, nor have we been able to find, the town, we reported
this to</b>
<br><b>the police at. We began to think, the lady, and this town, on this</b>
<br><b>stretch of road, was all supernatural, and don't exsist, all ghostly.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Grandmothers House</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: mpap@kuntrynet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I thank you for the opportunity to relay my experiences growing up,
and even daily at times.</b>
<br><b>I think I have always been aware of presences.&nbsp; At the age
of two I was pushed down the back servants stairs in my grandmother's home.</b>
<br><b>NOTHING WAS THERE.</b>
<br><b>My grandmother's home has always been a very uncomfortable place
for me to be.&nbsp; I have decided that there are only two "safe" rooms
in her very large six-bedroom home.&nbsp; The house is over 100 years old,
and there have always been awful attempts on the family there.&nbsp; Why
my grandmother continues to live there alone I will never know.&nbsp; It
seems....unclean.&nbsp; Always something watching, things sneakily moving
about at night, lights turning themselves on and off, and always an undertone
of violence and hatred.&nbsp; As well as this presence(s) trying to off</b>
<br><b>me as a child, it has tried to choke my mother as a girl in her
bed one night.&nbsp; She refuses to talk about it.&nbsp; When I had no
alternative I lived with her for a couple of months.&nbsp; It was horrible.&nbsp;
I slept with the light on every night and listened to and felt the house.I
always remember if one of my cousins was put upstairs to take a nap as
an infant, he would always cry and cry, with hardly a breath between wails.For
me, I seem to be very sensitive to presences.&nbsp; My father would always
take me on "house inspection".&nbsp; If I felt uncomfortable, even a bit
in a certain room, we would not rent, or buy the home.&nbsp; One home we
looked at was very beautiful, until I hit the basement.&nbsp; I reeled</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;backward, and I got cold, and there was a flash of manacles
and blood on the wall- I NEVER want to experience something like that again-
someone passed there horribly.I have been in quite a few homes and buildings
that make me want to backpedal off to the nearest church; or is that the
liquor store?The home I reside in now is over 100 years old as well.&nbsp;
When we first moved in, I felt the house trying to decide whether I was
acceptable.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; As I sung to my baby I felt the house sigh around me, as
if in relief.&nbsp; Strange, no?There is something here though.&nbsp; Somthing
that makes you want to goosestep right on out of one of the upstairs bedrooms.&nbsp;
I call it a</b>
<br><b>"watcher".&nbsp; An observer, if you will.&nbsp; The type that makes
your knees go weak, your back gets cold, and you feel like you ought to
get the hell out-fast.&nbsp; But it does not seem evil, just very interested,
and very opinionated.</b>
<br><b>Well, I know I'm not mentally "off", just that I've had some odd
occurences in my life, and I'm sure there will be plenty more.&nbsp; Thank
you for your time.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>My Friends Attic</font></b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>As some of you may know, i have already posted here but this experience&nbsp;
i</b>
<br><b>had just the other day is very strange, in my opinion.&nbsp; On
the night of April</b>
<br><b>21 I slept over at a friends house, who we shall call mike.&nbsp;
He had told me</b>
<br><b>about some weird experiences and the cold spots he felt in his</b>
<br><b>upstairs/attic.&nbsp; I knew he was right when got in that house.....I
could just</b>
<br><b>feel it like it was a sixth sense.&nbsp; Since we were sleeping
in the attic and</b>
<br><b>we both felt as if something big was going to happen, we had our
concerns.</b>
<br><b>Nothing weird happened until around 10:00 when I felt a large cold
spot drift</b>
<br><b>in front of me, this cold spot seemed to have mosing air within
it.&nbsp; I know</b>
<br><b>it wasn't a draft because i felt all around it without any other
cold areas.</b>
<br><b>With this we became a bit scared.&nbsp; The cold spot moved around
our general</b>
<br><b>area for about an hour when the room temperature dropped about 15-20
degrees</b>
<br><b>in roughly 30 seconds.&nbsp; The temperature had been that way for
about 20</b>
<br><b>minutes when suddenly the air became thinner and harder to breathe.&nbsp;
5</b>
<br><b>minutes later the room bgan to get warmer and the air was easier
to breathe</b>
<br><b>until it seemed to be back to normal.&nbsp; But about 10 minutes
later the</b>
<br><b>temperature rose about 15-20 degrees in 30 seconds.&nbsp; It stayed
so for 2</b>
<br><b>minutes when the temperature began go up and down at an alarming
rate.&nbsp; By</b>
<br><b>now we just left and went to his living room to sleep.&nbsp; It
seemed well until</b>
<br><b>2:30 when I saw several orbs drifting through the room.&nbsp; As
soon as they left</b>
<br><b>i woke Mike to tell him what I saw, but he seemed to be useless.&nbsp;
Just then</b>
<br><b>the temperature dropped the same as before.&nbsp; Then I just layed
in bed with my</b>
<br><b>eyes closed and didn't sleep a single wink.&nbsp; I anyone has any
ideas or advice</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Ambulance Crew</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: StateCom@idhw.state.id.us</b><b></b>
<p><b>During the late 1980s I worked for a hospital-based paramedic ambulance
in</b>
<br><b>Grants Pass, OR.&nbsp; Our crew quarters was a small house across
the street from</b>
<br><b>the hospital.&nbsp; As we worked 24 hour shifts, each crew had a
bed room</b>
<br><b>assigned to them.&nbsp; We had two crews on duty at a time.&nbsp;
On a few occasions,</b>
<br><b>the other crew got a call during the night.&nbsp; My partner and
I were in our</b>
<br><b>room, and no one else was in the house.&nbsp; We would hear footsteps
walking</b>
<br><b>down the hall, and water running in the bathroom.&nbsp; I would
get up to look,</b>
<br><b>but never saw anything.&nbsp; I always felt a strange, cold presence
in the house</b>
<br><b>during the night.&nbsp; Trying to find an explanation, I contacted
the people who</b>
<br><b>rented the house before the ambulance crews moved in.&nbsp; The
lady, without</b>
<br><b>hesitation, told me that she had similar experiences and was sure
the house</b>
<br><b>was haunted.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Ghostly Happenings?</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rkirby@midwest.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>First of all ,let me start by telling you, I've had a lot of experiences
and so has my father. Something about "The Other Side" has always grabbed
my attention. Maybe because of this my father and I are easy targets for
this sort of stuff. Since I was little I've always had either people I've
known show themselves to me or even had some visions. No I'm far from being
a nut, just getting brave enough to share a few of my tales with someone.
Any questions or comments please send them to QTizKim@aol.com .</b><b></b>
<p><b>OK, I was in Junior High and my parents were getting ready to go
on vacation. My sister and I had decided we were old enough to stay home.
So my parents agreed to let us stay with friends my sister went to one
place and I went to another place. My friends dad , as soon as I got there,
started telling me about the strange things that happen around their house.
I'm thinking Oh great, I should have went with mom and dad. He said he
knew that I had visitors and seen things and just wanted to let me know
about this stuff before I became frightened. I didn't</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;except this too easily.&nbsp; I'll tell you I was never so
glad in all my life to go back home. one experience in that house has frightened
me and I remember and as I tell you about I'm getting chills. One night,
my friend and I were sitting on here double sized bed and being teen girls
we had a lot to catch up on. Boys and things... It was very hot out that
night, they didn't have A.C. so we had the windows open. In her room she
had her double sized bed, that she used, and a twin size she used for clothes
or just junk. Well there was a huge pile of junk on the twin , so we decided
to share the double size bed. Shut the lights off, ( pitch black), she
got into bed and I was already snuggled</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;in. We laid there chit chatting and slowly fell asleep. I
was woke up by "someone" rubbing my leg, I thought ok I'm still sleeping.
I kicked and moved around and realized I was awake then, and it stopped.
A few minutes later this happened again. I then said "Becky, please stop
messing around, I'm tired", she said nothing in return. After this happening
several times, she got upset with me because I was accusing her of doing
this. She got out of bed and turned on the light, then we talked and she
said she was going to sleep on the "Junk Twin" bed. So</b>
<br><b>she cleared off all the junk onto the floor, turned the light off,
got into the bed , I knew this because the twin made an awful spring noise
as she moved on it. I laid there awake waiting for her to try this again.
But no nothing, no sound , no movement. So I laid there thinking and then
the bed , right in front of me at the edge, started being pressed down
, someone bouncing it , as if trying to wake me up. Well I thought ok ,
I've had enough. So I started yelling and hitting. Hitting nothing but
air. Then I hear the srings on the other bed and the</b>
<br><b>light went on. I was still swinging, the bed was still being bounced
and there at the light switch was my friend, staring at me like I was nuts.
Her parents came running into the room and calmed me down and her father
looked at me and said ..."Kim, I wanred you." and smiled. They all started
laughing, saying&nbsp; " The Old Man" paid you a visit... they then explained
to me , he was a frisky old man and like playing jokes like that. Well
I didn't find it funny and Thank God, that a few days later my parents
came home, I was very exhausted from NO SLEEP.</b>
<br><b>This is just one thing that happened to me there. It stays in my
mind all the time, especially with me now having kids. When they say to
me " Mom, I'm scared I hear noises or something under my bed" I check everywhere
and believe in them. I also think they might have the same vulneribility
as I do with this stuff. Especially my 9 yr old son. Thats all for now.</b>
