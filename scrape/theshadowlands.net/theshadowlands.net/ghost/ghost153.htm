<b>A Recent Haunting</b>
<p><b>By: simpspa@reynellaehs.sa.edu.au</b>
<p><b>Ever had that feeling that your being watched and you turn to find
no one there?&nbsp; Ever felt someone next to you and yet found out that
you're alone?&nbsp; Well i have and it was starting to get very annoying!&nbsp;
You see i have a ghost that follows me around, she moves things, manifests
in the hallway of my house, hovers aroundthe bathroom looking in the mirror,
scares the cat and makes life miserable for the neighbours dog.&nbsp; Her
name is Rose, well thats what i call her becasue she's a victorian era
woman in a grey dress, black, broad brimmed hat, black stockings and gloves.&nbsp;
She carries a single red rose.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; When i ask her what she wants she just fades away.&nbsp;
The other day I was watching T'V' in the living room when she decided to
manifest right in front of me, potatoe chips every where!&nbsp; She had
surrounded herself with a brilliant pink, red and blue aura, just for a
moment she smiled, it made for a disconcerting few minutes.&nbsp; It will
be interesting to see if she follows me as i move house tomorrow, not because
of her, the lease ran out.&nbsp; She's been around for a few months now
but is becoming more active.&nbsp; Recently she appeared in a photo hagning
on the wall, a friend commented on iy and the next day she was gone.&nbsp;
If something goes bump in the night I know its just her, rattling around
the kitchen, literally.&nbsp; She's not scarey, just inconvenient, and
a little over protective, it feels like I've been adopted.&nbsp; My last
girlfriend, refused to come into the house when rose started locking her
in the toilet.&nbsp; The adventure continues.&nbsp; Not all ghost are evil
or scarey, some are just bored.</b>

<br><b>Abilities</b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b>My story isn't so much about ghosts as it is about what i believe
to be god</b>
<br><b>given gifts.&nbsp; I have noticed it in myself, my husband, and
my grandfather.</b>
<br><b>Grandpa also said that his grandfather had it as well.&nbsp; I believe
it skips</b>
<br><b>a generation because none of my aunts or uncles have the abilites.</b>
<br><b>The ability that has taken the most learning-to-deal-with is my
ability to</b>
<br><b>see "scenes" as they happen.&nbsp; This ability seems to be mine
alone.&nbsp; I don't</b>
<br><b>know of another family member who can do the same thing.&nbsp; For
one instance</b>
<br><b>out of many.&nbsp; I "watched" my father drive off of the side of
a very steap</b>
<br><b>cliff.&nbsp; It was only because I recognized the location that
we were able to</b>
<br><b>find him before he died.&nbsp; My father was in Kentucky and I was
in Texas.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>spent almost 6 months in ICU.&nbsp; The doctors told me that had
i not called</b>
<br><b>and reported the location as it was happing, he would have died.&nbsp;
Many</b>
<br><b>times i have done what my husband calls "zoned" and started screaming
or</b>
<br><b>picking up the phone and dialing, or crying&nbsp; before I even
know what I am</b>
<br><b>doing. It only happens when it is someone that I love.</b>
<br><b>The other ability is the one with animals.&nbsp; My grandfather
and myself can</b>
<br><b>walk into the woods at any point in time, and the animals come to
us.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>is as if they see us as one of them.&nbsp; I have alway walked up
to things that</b>
<br><b>would kill other people such as wolfs and mountain lions and never
thought</b>
<br><b>anything of doing so.&nbsp; Even in a zoo I was able to help with
a very</b>
<br><b>dangerous situation.&nbsp; A child had fallen into a cougar's cage,
They we just</b>
<br><b>going to shoot the poor animal because he was considered extremely</b>
<br><b>dangerous.&nbsp; I managed to break into the cage while everyone
was huddled</b>
<br><b>trying to figure out what to do.&nbsp; I just walked up the the
cat told him</b>
<br><b>what was going on and carried the girl out.</b>

<br><b>Advance Notice</b>
<p><b>By: jnorman@kscable.com</b>
<p><b>This is a short story. My mother-in-law was in the hospital in the
last</b>
<br><b>stages of terminal cancer. My wife and I were holding vigil, caring
for her</b>
<br><b>as best we could. She entered a coma early in the evening and we
were told</b>
<br><b>by the doctors and nurses that she would not regain consciousness.
I told my</b>
<br><b>wife to stretch out on the foldout chair and try to nap. Exhausted
as she</b>
<br><b>was, she quickly fell asleep. I stayed awake as best I could but
around 2AM</b>
<br><b>it was evident I needed to get some sleep myself. I had to go home
to nap</b>
<br><b>and then get ready for work. I stood looking down at my mother-in-law
and</b>
<br><b>quietly said outloud " I wonder when IT will happen?". A calm masculine</b>
<br><b>voice behind me said "Six". My sleeping wife, my comatose mother-in-law
and</b>
<br><b>I were the only ones there. I quietly woke my wife and told her
that I was</b>
<br><b>sorry to have to leave but I had to go home. She asked if anything
happened</b>
<br><b>she should know about. I hesitated and then told her about the voice
and the</b>
<br><b>word six. I told her I didn't know if it meant 6 seconds, 6 minutes,
6AM, 6</b>
<br><b>days or what. She just sort of smiled and said "That stuff again"
then gave</b>
<br><b>me a quick kiss. I said "See you later" and before I left gave my</b>
<br><b>mother-in-law a quick peck on the forehead and said "See you later".
Later</b>
<br><b>that morning, I received a call from the hospital. My wife said
"Mom just</b>
<br><b>passed away about 5 minutes ago and could you come right away".
I got out of</b>
<br><b>the bed and glanced at the clock while I got dressed, it read 6:05AM.</b>

<br><b>Haunting in Vermont</b>
<p><b>By: bratkid@sover.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My name is Katy. I live in Bennington Vermont. My mother used
to work at</b>
<br><b>SVC not long ago. I would go there ALL the time, even if she wasn't
there.</b>
<br><b>Here's some things about that place.&nbsp; The newest sighting was
a few months</b>
<br><b>ago. A man my mom worked with was in the basement getting a coke
for his</b>
<br><b>lunch. He got it and then when he turned around he saw a ghost.
It was a</b>
<br><b>lady and she was wearing a long victorian gown. She watched him
for a</b>
<br><b>minute or two and then vanished. We think she was the ghost of MRS.</b>
<br><b>Everette. Often times the security gaurds would go up to the third
floor,</b>
<br><b>which is the most haunted, and see ghosts particularly in the abbey.
The</b>
<br><b>legend to that is that a maid of the everette family hung herself,
and she</b>
<br><b>also still haunts the place.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I heard a story of a security gaurd who saw one. He was locking
the</b>
<br><b>windows and heard a sound like marbles falling, he turned and he
said he</b>
<br><b>saw a ghost. I think he said it was a monk. You see, after the everettes</b>
<br><b>died, the mansion became like a church or something. The ghost that
the</b>
<br><b>security gaurd saw was a monk. The place is not only haunted by</b>
<br><b>Mr.everette. and Once a securoty gaurd was sure he checked the basement</b>
<br><b>thoroughly, but when he got back upstairs, he heard footsteps. Weird
huh?</b>
<br><b>Being the ghost fanatic I am, I know a lot more about Bennington
hauntings,</b>
<br><b>and vermont stuff.</b>

<p><b>Twin Visiting</b>
<p><b>By: Zaclover49@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I had a twin sister who died when I was 5 of some sort of disease.
When I was</b>
<br><b>8 years old, I came home from school to find that all of my good
barbie dolls</b>
<br><b>were played with on the floor. Since I am now only 14, it wasn't
that long</b>
<br><b>ago. I went to ask my mother is anyone had come over and had played
with my</b>
<br><b>barbies; she said that no one had came over. So, I didn't think
anything of</b>
<br><b>it until it happened again the next day, and again the day after
that. By</b>
<br><b>then, I was terrified. I didn't know who was playing with my barbie's.....or</b>
<br><b>what. That night I had a dream. I dreamt that I was playing barbies
with my</b>
<br><b>sister before she died. She loved those barbies.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I woke up, I had a crazy idea that my sister
didn't have any barbies</b>
<br><b>in heaven so she played with mine. So I bought 3 cheap barbies,
before</b>
<br><b>school, at the store, came home, went up into my room and yelled,
"I don't</b>
<br><b>want you playing with my good barbies any more! Play with these!"
Then I</b>
<br><b>placed the newly bought barbies on my desk.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I went to school, I was excited to come
home and see if anything</b>
<br><b>had happened to the cheap barbies. Sure enough, when I came home
from school,</b>
<br><b>the cheap barbies had been played with on the floor and my good
ones had been</b>
<br><b>untouched.</b>

<br><b>Miller School Ghosts</b>
<p><b>By- Julie</b>
<p><b>I am only 18 but I have seen or felt Ghosts for as long as I can</b>
<br><b>remember. My mom sed to think that I juat had an over-active imagination</b>
<br><b>untill this year. I will be posting more of my encounters soon but
so</b>
<br><b>far this encounter has been the one that stands out over all of
them. I</b>
<br><b>live in Santa Maria, California , and for those who live here now
of</b>
<br><b>Miller School, but not the ghosts who haunt it. I my self have heard</b>
<br><b>many rumors of the school being haunted but I hadnt the courage
to check</b>
<br><b>it out by my self. I got 3 of my closest friends (Cheryl Diana and</b>
<br><b>Carrie) and 2 of there boyfriends (Troy Diana's boyfriend, and Jeff</b>
<br><b>Cheryl's boyfriend) to come with me and check it out. We got there
aroud</b>
<br><b>8:00pm and sat on the playground equipment till around 8:30 when
we all</b>
<br><b>started to get rest-less and thought about going back to Troy's
house,</b>
<br><b>thats when we noticed that a white sweater that a kid left behind
from</b>
<br><b>earlyer that day was gone. It was at the edge of the sand and the</b>
<br><b>begining of the grass just a couple of minutes earlyer and no one
could</b>
<br><b>have came in because the gates we locked and we had to climb over
them</b>
<br><b>just to get in. Troy and Jeff started loking around for it and started</b>
<br><b>walking out into the school field, Cheryl and Diana&nbsp; folloed
them,</b>
<br><b>Carrie and&nbsp; I didnt feel like it was neccesary for all of us
to go so we</b>
<br><b>sat on the swings. We started talking at the same time we were watching</b>
<br><b>them look for the sweater when I heard a faint cry I stopped talking
and</b>
<br><b>looked around. I saw nothing and heard nothing. So i continued talking</b>
<br><b>to Carrie when she asked me "Did you hear that?"</b>
<br><b>I looked at her and said</b>
<br><b>" You heard it too? "</b>
<br><b>"Yea, Wanna go with Diana and them, im gettin' kinda freaked out"</b>
<br><b>I replied</b>
<br><b>"Okay let's go"</b>
<br><b>Right as we were getting up from the swings the crying sounds got</b>
<br><b>louder.Carrie tuned around and grabed my arm, I turned around. Comming</b>
<br><b>down the hallway twords us was a little boy he looked like he was
5 or</b>
<br><b>6,&nbsp; he was looked blue from head to toe, he had a stripped
shirt on and</b>
<br><b>a bowl kinda hair cut (when it looks like they put a bowl on there
head</b>
<br><b>and cut there hair) his right hand was over his right eye and he
was</b>
<br><b>crying, very loud. He came all the way to the end of the hall where
you</b>
<br><b>would turn and get a drink or use the bathroom, he turned around
and</b>
<br><b>started walking from where he had come from. Carrie started freaking
out</b>
<br><b>and I managed to calm her down. Troy, Jeff, Cheryl and Diana came</b>
<br><b>running back twords us. They were practically screaming at what
happened</b>
<br><b>to them. They said that when they were looking for the sweater they
saw</b>
<br><b>a woman who was carrying the white sweater, as she came closer they
said</b>
<br><b>they saw that she was kinda like gliding twords them, Troy said
when she</b>
<br><b>was comming closer twords them he looked down and she had no feet!</b>
<br><b>Carrie and I told them what had happened to us. Troy wanted to see
where</b>
<br><b>the boy was and where he had went to. No one else wanted to go so
I</b>
<br><b>showed Troy and Jeff, as soon as Diana Cheryl and Carrie saw us
waking</b>
<br><b>towards the place I saw the boy they came running behind us. I showed</b>
<br><b>the the place where the little boy went, there was nothing there.
By</b>
<br><b>this time it was 9:00pm. We all decided that we had enough of Miller</b>
<br><b>school and we started walking towards Troy's house. So we had to
walk</b>
<br><b>through the kindergarten rooms as soon as we turned the corner and</b>
<br><b>started walking to the gate we had to jump a white dog that looked
like</b>
<br><b>a poodle came out from the place we had to go to get out. I grabbed</b>
<br><b>Cheryl's arm and she grabbed mine. We looked at this dog who was
just</b>
<br><b>staring at us, he turn around and started running away from us as
he</b>
<br><b>neared the end of the hall way, to all of our suprise he stoped
turned</b>
<br><b>around looking at us again and just dissapeard. We were all in amazment</b>
<br><b>we all asked each other if we saw the same thing. Jeff and Troy
started</b>
<br><b>to think that it had to be a prank and they ran to where the dog
had</b>
<br><b>dissapeard, we were all screaming for them to come back, they just
kept</b>
<br><b>on running, nither of us want to walk with out the guys to his house
so</b>
<br><b>we ran after them. We rounded the corner where the guys had gone
and no</b>
<br><b>one was there! We all started crying, the hall way was long and
there</b>
<br><b>was no way the guys could have ran that fast down the hall and none
of</b>
<br><b>us see them, besides that hall way goes straight out to the field,
we</b>
<br><b>started calling them while we were all hugging each other, we started</b>
<br><b>walking down the hall still crying our eyes out calling out for
the</b>
<br><b>guy's when we reached a trailor right befor you go onto the field.
We</b>
<br><b>all stoped there, I told them that we should wait here for them
since we</b>
<br><b>could see most of the school from that place, they agreed so we
all</b>
<br><b>stayed there, 10 minutes passed and no sign of the guys, we all
started</b>
<br><b>getting worried. it must have been around 9:15 or so. we got tired
of</b>
<br><b>standing and decided to go sit on the swings so we walked over to
the</b>
<br><b>swings and sat down, except for Cheryl, she had this vacant look&nbsp;
and</b>
<br><b>her face became pale white, we stood up and started yelling whats
the</b>
<br><b>matter she just started screaming, we all looked the way she was
and saw</b>
<br><b>a man with no eye's in his socket looking at us from the trailor
we were</b>
<br><b>just standing by! We all started screaming and began to run, we
ran all</b>
<br><b>the way to Troy's house and never looked back! When we got there
Troy</b>
<br><b>and Jeff were waiting in the front of the house! They calmed us
down and</b>
<br><b>we told them what happened. They told us that when they went to
look for</b>
<br><b>the dog they couldnt find it and when they went looking for us they</b>
<br><b>couldnt find us so they thought that we came to his house. He said
they</b>
<br><b>had just got there and were getting ready to go back and look for
us. We</b>
<br><b>all didnt sleep that nite and not for a couple of day's after that</b>
<br><b>happened. Im sorry that this is so long.</b>
<br><b>It is 100% true and in NO way is it false or copied from another
web</b>
<br><b>site. This happened to me and Cheryl, Carrie, Diana, Troy, and Jeff.</b>
<br><b>Since this has happend we have not or ever plan on going back.I
wasnt</b>
<br><b>going to send this in but I feel a sence of release now that I have.
I</b>
<br><b>will be writing in my other experiances very soon. Thank you for

<br><b>My Daughter</b>
<p><b>By: anonymous</b>
<p><b>When my daughter was approx 18 months old she would wake up in the
middle of</b>
<br><b>the night giggling. I would go to check on her (did not happen often)
and</b>
<br><b>ask her why she was awake (rhetorically speaking) and she would
point to the</b>
<br><b>end of her crib saying "Papa, Papa". Well I just thought she was
having</b>
<br><b>vivid dreams and the only person she called "Papa" is a family friend.
Well,</b>
<br><b>when she was about three I decided to share the family album with
her. Her</b>
<br><b>grandfathers both died before she was born and only one of their
pictures</b>
<br><b>was up in the house we were living in (my mom-in law was ill and
we lived</b>
<br><b>with her). When she saw her Grandpa Corda's picture in the album
she said,</b>
<br><b>"That's MY Papa." And I just figured she had seen the picture of
him up on</b>
<br><b>the wall. Then, to my shock, when my dad's picture came up in the
album she</b>
<br><b>said, "That's my other Papa." THERE WERE NO PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE HOUSE
THAT SHE COULD HAVE SEEN. I asked her how she knew these were her "Papa's"
and her reply gave me chills. She said, "They come sometimes at night when
I</b>
<br><b>can't sleep and tickle me." Well, I have to tell you she just turned
twelve</b>
<br><b>and several other family members and close friends have "crossed-over"
and</b>
<br><b>she says they come to visit. I have no reason to disbelieve her.
(end of</b>
<br><b>story and please do not publish my email address - Thx)</b>
<br><b>Dave - We have visited several local cemetaries with a camera and
almost</b>
<br><b>everytime she points and tells me to take a picture we get SOMETHING
on it</b>
<br><b>from an orb to ectoplasm to, in one case a fantastic light show.</b>

<br><b>Young and Haunted</b>
<p><b>By: md.hammer@home.com</b>
<p><b>i remember my experience with ghosts.when i was quite young, 6 or
7, i</b>
<br><b>too saw things every night. i would be lying in bed and i would
get the</b>
<br><b>feeling as if something was watching me.So, i would roll over,and
there</b>
<br><b>right at the side of my bed,was this creature i called coo coo's.
i dont</b>
<br><b>know why i called them that,its just what came to my mind when i
saw</b>
<br><b>them.i would say it over and over and hide my head under my blankets.i</b>
<br><b>would then peak out to see if they were still there (there was always</b>
<br><b>three of them) and they always were still&nbsp; hovering there.so
i would try</b>
<br><b>to tell them in the name of jesus leave me alone! but i was so scared</b>
<br><b>that my tongue would stick to the top of my mouth and i couldnt
get any</b>
<br><b>words out.so i would just hide my head till i eventually fell asleep.</b>
<br><b>they would come every night.i hated going to bed.even though my
2</b>
<br><b>sisters slept in the same room as me they never saw them. when they</b>
<br><b>should up i would call to my sisters to wake them up but they seemed
to</b>
<br><b>be in a really deep sleep.i would also see these small creatures
that</b>
<br><b>would walk around my room i dont know what they were doing they
just</b>
<br><b>wandered around my room.they seemed to come from under my bed.they</b>
<br><b>looked to me like tiny people or something.with heads larger than</b>
<br><b>normal.a couple of times i would wake up and feel something tugging
at</b>
<br><b>my feet if i let my feet out from under my covers.sometimes it even
felt</b>
<br><b>like something was tickling my feet.and&nbsp; a couple of times
when i had</b>
<br><b>gotten out of my bed to go to the bathroom something tackled me
and</b>
<br><b>threw me to the floor. it was black with not really any shape.my
younger</b>
<br><b>brother said he had seen a tall black creature standing beside his</b>
<br><b>bedroom door once when he woke up in the middle of the night. i
dont</b>
<br><b>remember seeing that. after we moved out of that house i didnt see</b>
<br><b>anything like that anymore but i am still very scarred by the</b>
<br><b>experience.i still need a night light sometimes at night and i am
19</b>
<br><b>now.and i never let my feet slip out from under the covers.when
i saw</b>
<br><b>that show the six sense i cried because it reminded me about the

<br><b>The Haunted House</b>
<p><b>By:bmardock@houston.rr.com</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years back, My family and I were staying
in my grandparents house in Ouray Colorado, Ouray is a very small tourist
town nestled between the mountains. Ouray was filled with old buildings
and houses, nothing modren in anyway.</b>
<br><b>Old shops lined the streets which consisted of rock shops, dinners,
and tourist gallore, very old creepy hotels and attractions. In the past
it had been a mining town, there must be many ghosts around that area because
of mining accidents.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That house was a very old house,
I think 101 years now, and lots of horrible</b>
<br><b>things have happened in it or on the property.&nbsp; At first there
was some other house or something there, it burned down, and it is said
a little kid was in the house at the time. Also many people have lived
and died in the old house itself&nbsp; and it</b>
<br><b>has a very interesting history, much of which I don't know.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have had many experiences in that house(and
in the cabin beside,which I don't remember.) One experience,which may or
may not have anything to do with ghosts, happend when I was very little.
I don't remember much exept that my sister and I</b>
<br><b>were in an upstairs room at night, and we saw what my sister says
was a bigfoot out the window (which may or may not be true). I just remember
seeing a lot of brown fur go past the window, so much that it covered the
entire window. We went running</b>
<br><b>down the stairs to tell someone, now everyone says it was probably
a bear, but how could a bear get up there? We were on the 2nd flour, there
is no place for one to climb,and no reason.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, back to the current story, from the moment
my brothers and sisters and I, arrived there we had an errie feeling (everything
about that town makes you feel that way), but no one else then or now seemed
to feel it. My family always</b>
<br><b>arrived late, so they left the back door unlocked for us. When we
got out of our van, someone found a pet dish which was&nbsp; owned by my
sister for her pet duck, which died there 3 years back for no reason at
all. Every animal we every took in</b>
<br><b>that house died or pretty much went crazy. In the living room there
was this dog statue which really freaked us out, strangely it doesn't anymore,
so we didn't sleep there. We didn't sleep in the rooms because other company
was staying in</b>
<br><b>all but one,which our parents took, so we were going to sleep in
the basement. While we were down there, we began to notice&nbsp; many things
which in some way represented the number three. My sister said that according
to which craft,and all that three</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;was a bad number. She said she had a bad feeling about it
so we went upstairs and into the kitchen.&nbsp; We all had a midnight snack,and
watched some TV.&nbsp; We all tried not to think about ghosts or anything
like that so we wouldn't get really freaked out even more,</b>
<br><b>than we already were.All of the sudden a LOUD noise came from the
back room.</b>
<br><b>Without anyone saying anything we all just got up and started running
up stairs.</b>
<br><b>Why we picked this destionation, no one knows, but we did.The noise
seemed to follow us along with a cold gush of wind.Everyone rushed out
of their rooms to see what the matter was.But when we told them, no one
would belive us and just said it</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;was a bear. But a bear that loud? And what about the gush
of wind? Later my grandma came down stars and said she knew what we were
talking about.</b>
<br><b>We asked if she would move the dog statue into the game room, so
she did.</b>
<br><b>Oh ya, the dog ststue was given to my grandparents by my uncle who
died a while before.No one could ever explain this. But we all think it
just might have been our uncle, just giving us a scare.Though strangly&nbsp;
after that night, everything seemed fine.</b>

<br><b>True Experience..</b>
<p><b>By: a.mckean@cvr-uk.com</b>
<p><b>Weird stuff has happened to me for years now, but have never been
quite comfortable with it no matter how used to it I get. The strangest
thing is happening at the moment. I live in a fairly new house in a small
village in the north west of England.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;A few weeks ago, my boyfriend came round to my house and as
he was leaving up the path I heard footsteps on the wooden kitchen floor
going across the room to the back door. Thinking it was one of my parents,
I turned &amp; saw no - one at all in the room with me. In fact, on checking
I discovered that everyone else was in bed. Neither of my cats would go
into the kitchen, and both followed me to my bedroom &amp; jumped onto
my bed. A little spooked by this, I got into bed, turned off the light
(I should add that my bedroom is downstairs) and heard the footsteps going
back through the kitchen, through the living room and up the stairs. Have
done a little research into the history of the house and the land it's
built on and can't see anything out of the ordinary at all, I still hear
it sometimes, and when my boyfriend has stayed the night, he's heard someone
wandering around as well.... If anyone has any ideas on how to go about
finding out what's going on, I'd be pleased to know. Thanks</b>

<br><b>Three Knocks</b>
<p><b>By: akasha41@netzero.net</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My house was built in 1889 and was owned through
the years by members of the same family except for the owner before me
who only owned it a couple of years.&nbsp; Old man Westergard lived in
it from the time he was born until he was a very old man.&nbsp; I've always
believed the happenings in this house are attributable to him.&nbsp; He
seems to be a friendly ghost but he likes to play pranks once in a while
especially around Halloween.&nbsp; It was in 1989 on Halloween that a memorable
thing happened.&nbsp; I was sitting at the dining room table talking with
my tenant, Peter, when we heard three distinct knocks at the back door.
The back door is only about 4 feet from the dining room table so Peter
got up quickly and opened the door.&nbsp; No one was there.&nbsp; This
house is set back of the lot so the alley is only a few feet front he back
door.&nbsp; We ran outside to see if any kids had done it but the alley
was deserted.&nbsp; Again we sat down to talk and in a few seconds there
came another 3 loud knocks at the back door.&nbsp; This time I jumped up
quickly and opened the door within seconds to try and catch whoever was
knocking and again, no one was there. I also learned from the old timers
in the neighborhood that Mr. Westergard liked to wear jewelry.&nbsp; Many
times my jewelry has vanished off the dressing table within seconds after
I put it there or appeared in places where I did not put it.&nbsp; Also
the front&nbsp; porch light has been on several mornings when I know I
turned it off the night before.&nbsp; In many ways I believe this is still
Mr. Westergard's house although I think he approves of me living here.&nbsp;
Here is another strange coincidence.&nbsp; My name is Judy and a few years
back I learned from the long-time residents of the neighborhood that his
grand daughter who lived across the alley from him and he visited quite
a bit was named Judy.</b>

<p><b>The Whaley House in San Diego</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: JediMistressDrgn@aol.com</b>
<p><b>This happened to me long ago, when I was in 9th Grade at El Cajon
Valley High</b>
<br><b>School-1968, in fact. Our Geography class went on a field trip to
Old Town,</b>
<br><b>San Diego and a friend, Debbie Neunann and I couldn't afford to
go inside the</b>
<br><b>Whaley House but instead tried to peak through the windows to see
the place.</b>
<br><b>As I looked through the window that looked upon what had been the
courtroom</b>
<br><b>of the town back in the old West days I saw a small woman in an
old-fashioned</b>
<br><b>dress and her dark hair in a tight bun walking across the room to
leave</b>
<br><b>through the doorway that went into the hallway. I thought it was
strangw at</b>
<br><b>the time that she seem to "float" as she walked but dismissed that
thought. I</b>
<br><b>quickly went over to the window that you could look through and
see into the</b>
<br><b>hallway but she never came out. It freaked me out and I told my
friend what</b>
<br><b>had happened. We went inside the place and we found two of the ladies
who</b>
<br><b>worked there. I had asked what had happened to the volunteer in
the costume.</b>
<br><b>The ladies looked at us and said that the volunteers didn't wear
costumes.</b>
<br><b>They asked me what the lady looked like. I described her and one
of the</b>
<br><b>ladies said then, " There's no doubt, you saw Mrs. Whaley!" After
that we</b>
<br><b>found out that many had seen her and that the place was haunted.
This was not</b>
<br><b>the only time I've seen a spirit or had an experience but it was

<br><b>The sensitive sides of spirits</b>
<p><b>By: simpspa@reynellaehs.sa.edu.au</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>For as long as i can remeber i have been surrounded by spririts of
one sort or another.&nbsp; They've always been a part of my up bringing.&nbsp;
I just never knew that this was unusual until i was older.&nbsp; I've always
been the person who could finish what the&nbsp; teacher was going to say
before they did, tell you what the next ad' on tv would be before it appeared.
I can tell people about themselves having only just met them.&nbsp; I can
see peoples energy levels as a faint grey/white halo around them.&nbsp;
Occasionally see colour. Out the corner of my eye, if i completely relaxe
and let myself open up I can generally tell if something is in a room,
like looking at faint stars at night, you know its there but you cannot
see it by looking directly at it. Often I can describe the physical features
of a place where someone has lost someone od something, but what i find
isthat if i try and concetrate on it then it doesent work.&nbsp; So when
I speak of living with ghosts the ability to shut them out is a positive
one.&nbsp; I guess that makes me sensitive!!! There is one place i am constantly
drawn to.&nbsp; It is an old Josephite Reformetory.&nbsp; It is set about
60 miles north of Adelaide, on a quiet country road just outside of the
old copper mining town of Tanunda, set high on a hill, it overlooks a well
used but rather old catholic cemetery. The place itself has a sad history.&nbsp;
It was set up in the 1860's to deal with deliquent and homeless girls.&nbsp;
Discipline was harsh, and more than one inmate took her own life, or died
a premature death.</b>
<br><b>The main building is a fallen ruin, an imposing affair, made of
local sand stone a typical, edwardian era, 160 ft long, large entrance,
two huge chimneys, no floors or ceilings, the wind fairly whistles through
the large, vacant windows.&nbsp; There are many neglected, or unmarked
graves about the place, and on a clear day you can see for miles.&nbsp;
I have not yet</b>
<br><b>discovered why i keep being drawn to this place.&nbsp; It dwells
from time to time in my thoughts, I feel as if i have to do something for
someone.!</b>
<br><b>There are ghosts there and lots of them but I can find no connection
to the place in my own background, or that of my families.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</b>

<br><b>The Rental House</b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; duart@mindspring.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Most people seem partial to repeating scary ghost stories.&nbsp;
My story is not scary; it's odd.</b>
<br><b>Several years ago two of my friends were moving from an apartment
into a three bedroom house and needed another roommate to split the rent.&nbsp;
Neither the house nor the neighborhood was old, and we heard no stories
about the area.&nbsp; Most of the things I experienced could potentially
be chalked up to my imagination:&nbsp; the feeling of being watched when
no one else was home; the cat staring at a space behind me when there was
nothing there but a wall.&nbsp; When I first walked in to my new bedroom,
I looked at one of the corners and knew that my friend's rocking chair
belonged there (At the time, it was</b>
<br><b>in the living room).&nbsp; The cat (same cat) would curl up under
the rocking chair, never in the chair.&nbsp; Like I said, all of this could
be chalked up to any number of things.&nbsp; Then there was the bathtub.The
drain in the bathtub was frequently clogged, due to long hair.&nbsp; Two
of us went out and bought industrial strength drain opener (you know, the
kind they tell you tell wear gloves with and not to spill on your clothes
because of the acid content)</b>
<br><b>.&nbsp; The label said to put a pot over the drain to keep the liquid
from spewing out.&nbsp; One time we forgot the pot and went out to lunch.&nbsp;
When we came back, the liquid had obviously sprayed.&nbsp; The tub was
stained an orange color.&nbsp; We tried to scrub the stains out.&nbsp;
No luck.&nbsp; Even worse, the enamel was chipped in several places!&nbsp;
We ran our hands over the surface and felt the chips in tub.&nbsp; How
were we going to explain this to the landlord?&nbsp; How expensive was
a new tub?&nbsp; The two of us didn't talk about it, and we didn't tell
our other roomie about it that evening.&nbsp; I don't remember the exact
time frame anymore, but it wasn't more than a couple of days later when
I pulled the curtain back on the tub and looked in.&nbsp; The stains were
gone, which I thought was great.&nbsp; I assumed the stains had worn off.&nbsp;
Then I ran my hand over the tub... and couldn't feel any chips.&nbsp; I
assumed my cohrt in crime had found a way to repair the chips (I knew it
wasn't the other roomie), so I asked my friend.&nbsp; He was confused,
so I showed him the tub.&nbsp; He hadn't done anything</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;either.&nbsp; Neither of us had told the landlord, and the
landlord never came over unannounced.I wouldn't believe the story myself
if my friend, who is a very skeptical and level-headed person, hadn't been
there with me and seen the before and after evidence.</b>

<p><b>it all started one night&nbsp; mommy was taking a walk. when she

who looked like me, (I was only five then) so mom went in grandpa's house
when she got in she said has sara been upstairs lately???</b>
<br><b>no she sure has not. grandpa replied.well I saw a little girl upstairs,
she said. no one new who the little girl was, I had no sisters or cousins
there.</b>
<br><b>THE NEXT DAY...</b>
<br><b>I was playing on the second floor and I went into the room where
mom had thought she had saw a little girl in the window. I was trying to
find my barbie dolls, while I was in there I looked out the same window
and mommy was coming up the stairs I</b>
<br><b>leaned against the window and then the window poped open and I was
half way in and half way out. I finally managed to climbback in. then I
ran into the hallway and told mommy she thought I was kidding.</b>
<br><b>A WEEK LATER.....</b>
<br><b>I asked grandpa a question grandpa, who used to live here before
you?</b>
<br><b>well he began, there was a lady who died of cancer and a man and

<br><b>well only the man and one of girls got to move the other little
girl died from chicken pox .he said.that was real weird, what I think is
the little girl who was in the window was the one who died from chicken
pox, and the screws coming undone when I leaned toward that window and
fell out. had to all do with that little girl who was in the window. if
you thought that was weird&nbsp; then you should hear the story of EYE

<br><b>St Augustine Experience</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: pythia@aye.net</b>
<p><b>St Augustine, Florida is the US' oldest city, and has a presence
all</b>
<br><b>it's own; a peculiar aura of timelessness surrounds the place, no
matter</b>
<br><b>what the time of day. I love the town, consider it my second home,
and</b>
<br><b>know it at least as well as I know my own hometown. It has it's
stories,</b>
<br><b>and it's famous hauntings; and now I have a story of my own.</b>
<br><b>Back in the spring my husband and I spent a week in one of the city's</b>
<br><b>many bed-and-breakfast inns. I'd heard stories about that particular</b>
<br><b>place and some insanity inspired me to rent for us the allegedly
haunted</b>
<br><b>guestroom. Now, I'm kind of a wuss; I don't mind spirits being around,</b>
<br><b>but I so don't want to see them! Upon settling in to our room, we</b>
<br><b>conducted a brief rite to alert the resident spirit of our arrival,
to</b>
<br><b>assure it that we meant it no harm and had only respect for it,
and to</b>
<br><b>request that it please be nice while we were there.</b>
<br><b>Just after this rite, I went into the bathroom and settled in for
a soak</b>
<br><b>in the big clawfoot bathtub. I thought I heard my husband say something</b>
<br><b>to me, so I got up and opened the door and asked him; he was watching
TV</b>
<br><b>and hadn't said a word.</b>
<br><b>I didn't sleep well any of the nights we were there--I kept waking
up,</b>
<br><b>though I heard/saw/felt nothing at all. I never felt uncomfortable
or</b>
<br><b>frightened in our room; indeed, it was a very cozy and charming
little</b>
<br><b>room, tucked up in a top corner of the old building with little
dormer</b>
<br><b>windows giving lovely views of the courtyard and street. My husband</b>
<br><b>claimed he didn't sleep well either; on one night he claims to have</b>
<br><b>awakened to the feel of a kiss on his cheek, only to find me dead</b>
<br><b>(pardon the pun) asleep next to him.</b>
<br><b>The only time anything really noticeable happened was on our final
night</b>
<br><b>there, and it happened not in our room but in the main dining room.
We</b>
<br><b>were settled at one of the big tables for the evening social hour,</b>
<br><b>sitting directly beneath one of several large electrified chandeliers.</b>
<br><b>At one point one of the bulbs in the chandelier flickered and went
out,</b>
<br><b>and--I don't know why I did this--I said, "Hey, turn that back on!"</b>
<br><b>The light bulb flicked back on.</b>
<br><b>When it went off again a moment later, I again said, "Turn that
back</b>
<br><b>on," and the bulb came back. This happened two or three more times,</b>
<br><b>during which I gained quite an audience! It was rather fun, really;
I</b>
<br><b>got the sense that whatever was there was very playful, and liked
to be</b>
<br><b>acknowledged. There were no further incidents, and we left the next</b>
<br><b>morning planning to stay there again someday.</b>
<br><b>Ghost hunters and afficionados can do no better than St Augustine.
There</b>
<br><b>are even after dark ghost tours through the city that are wonderfully</b>
<br><b>entertaining and educational.</b>

<br><b>Spending the Night at My Friends House</b>
<p><b>By: LMF050870@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Well, I would like to share the only experience that I had that has
made me</b>
<br><b>become a firm believer in spirits and ghosts.&nbsp; This is the
1st time I had</b>
<br><b>ever put this down to share with others and I am delighted to do
so.&nbsp; About</b>
<br><b>15 years ago, I spent the night at my friends house which was in
the same</b>
<br><b>neighborhood as mine.&nbsp; I was 15 years old at the time.&nbsp;
My friend had&nbsp; a 3</b>
<br><b>bedroom house.&nbsp; Once you entered the hallway that lead to the
rooms, there</b>
<br><b>was her room which was the 1st on the right, then there was her
little</b>
<br><b>sister's room at the end of the hallway to the right, then her dad's
room at</b>
<br><b>the end to the left.&nbsp; I was to sleep in her room while she
slept in her</b>
<br><b>little sister's room.&nbsp; I remember her Dad stayed in his room
the whole time I</b>
<br><b>was there.&nbsp; I don't recall where her sister was.&nbsp; Anyhow,
as I was going to</b>
<br><b>sleep, I laid on her bed with my back towards the open bedroom door.&nbsp;
All the</b>
<br><b>lights were out and the house was very quite.&nbsp; Then I remember
having this</b>
<br><b>feeling that there was someone in the room but I didn't think nothing
of it.</b>
<br><b>But then, I heard footsteps going across the carpet and towards
my bed.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>felt the chill you feel when you get scared.&nbsp; Then I heard
the steps stopping</b>
<br><b>right next to the bed.&nbsp; I didn't want to turn around and look
but I did real</b>
<br><b>fast to get it over with.&nbsp; I saw nothing.&nbsp; I got scared.&nbsp;
I turned over again</b>
<br><b>and when I did I heard the footsteps again leaving the room.&nbsp;
I remember</b>
<br><b>hearing the steps so clearly.&nbsp; I turned around and sat up and
listened as</b>
<br><b>they went down the hallway towards the bedroom where my friend was
sleeping</b>
<br><b>(I will just name my friend Julie).&nbsp; I was terrified!!&nbsp;
I listened harder and</b>
<br><b>heard the footsteps stop and then all of a sudden I heard my friend
talking.</b>
<br><b>I couldn't make out what she was saying at 1st so I got up to check
on her.</b>
<br><b>Julie was sitting up on her bed looking toward her door.&nbsp; I
stood at her door</b>
<br><b>while she was talking toward me.&nbsp; "What do you want?" she said.
"I not doing</b>
<br><b>anything to you", she said. "What are you doing here?", she went
on.&nbsp; Julie</b>
<br><b>looked like she was talking in her sleep and was looking right through
me.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>got spooked and I finally asked her who she was talking to.&nbsp;
After a few</b>
<br><b>moments, she snapped out of whatever trance she was in and she said,
"What?</b>
<br><b>I'm not talking to anybody."&nbsp; I was like, "Yes you were!"&nbsp;
She just told me</b>
<br><b>to go to bed and then she turned around and went back to sleep.&nbsp;
I was so</b>
<br><b>scared I went back to her bedroom, closed the door this time, and
put all the</b>
<br><b>stuffed animals I could find and placed them against the door.&nbsp;
I forced</b>
<br><b>myself to go to sleep.&nbsp; The next day I told her I will never
spend the night</b>
<br><b>at her house again and I never did.&nbsp; Ever since then, I always
wondered who</b>
<br><b>that could have been that was there that night.</b>
<br><b>Just recently (15 years later) I retold this story to a friend of
mine who is</b>
<br><b>a fan of this website.&nbsp; I never thought about this&nbsp; and
now it makes sense to</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; He told me that Julie was probably not talking to the
spirit but that</b>
<br><b>the spirit was talking to me,,, through her!!!&nbsp; Maybe the spirit
knew that I</b>
<br><b>felt it&nbsp; there and was a little upset that I heard it.&nbsp;
Maybe the spirit was</b>
<br><b>wondering why I was in Julie's bed.&nbsp; I can only think of one
person that</b>
<br><b>could have been the spirit.&nbsp; I will get some advice from someone
on this but</b>
<br><b>I now believe that the spirit was Julie's mother.&nbsp; Her mother
died of cancer</b>
<br><b>years before.&nbsp; I believe that she came to check on Julie.&nbsp;
When she found me</b>
<br><b>there in Julie's bed, she went to go look for her in her sister's
room.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>probably didn't like how I was following her footsteps and so she
had to</b>
<br><b>speak, but through my friend.</b>

<br><b>Sights and Sounds</b>
<p><b>By: Sidnee24@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I have been coming to your web site for quite sometime out of curiousity
of</b>
<br><b>the unknown. I have had many small but obvious experiences throughout
my</b>
<br><b>life. I will make it as shortly compiled as possible.</b>
<br><b>The first most obvious occurence happened the day before my mother's
funeral.</b>
<br><b>She died when I was sixteen years old. I was going to sleep in the
mobile</b>
<br><b>home of family.</b>
<br><b>The back end of the mobile was propped up a good nine feet or more
off the</b>
<br><b>ground which is where I was and also it is set up some what in the
woods. I</b>
<br><b>had turned off all the lights and some sheer curtains were over
the window</b>
<br><b>right by my head. I turned casually to look out the window just
before I laid</b>
<br><b>down and saw a figure of a person...waist up walk very clearly in
front of</b>
<br><b>the window to the back. The person would have had to be floating
to do</b>
<br><b>this...therefore I am sure it was mom. Also I must add that I had
a daughter</b>
<br><b>around this time and after this I flew back to California to live
with my</b>
<br><b>husband on a military base. (we are still together nine years later)
One</b>
<br><b>night my husband was woken during the night and was scratching himself..I</b>
<br><b>know funny...and a voice out of no where..said itch itch. He was
rather</b>
<br><b>scared and woke me. We moved back to Washington...our home state...in
93. But</b>
<br><b>oddly nothing really occured till we moved here...Henderson,Nevada...just</b>
<br><b>outside Vegas. Our first residence brought some odd things only
I</b>
<br><b>experienced. One night I was laying in bed next to my hubby. He
had already</b>
<br><b>fallen asleep...I had not. Suddenly I heard a voice..female and
high-pitched</b>
<br><b>in nature..say hi! I laid there in awe. It came from right beside
me. I was</b>
<br><b>not scared..just a bit shocked. On another nite..same bedroom...I
woke up in</b>
<br><b>the middle of the nite...with the instant urge to sit up and look
towards the</b>
<br><b>hallway. Just as I was doing just that I watched the door go from
fully open</b>
<br><b>to shutting quickly right before my eyes. The hall light was on
but I saw no</b>
<br><b>one there. I checked and the kids were asleep and no open windows..I
left the</b>
<br><b>door shut that nite...LOL.&nbsp; Then we moved to a different apartment
about five</b>
<br><b>miles away. Here it started with my daughter playing hide and seek
with her</b>
<br><b>brother. Our dining room table was "base". They were hooting it
up as I was</b>
<br><b>cooking dinner and their father was watching tv. Then all went quiet
and my</b>
<br><b>daughter came in and said she just saw a little girl with brown
hair and old</b>
<br><b>style clothing...like from little house on the prairie hop up from
behind the</b>
<br><b>table ...and disappear..she said she was smiling. I figured she
was playing</b>
<br><b>with them...I guess. She was rather spooked as you can imagine.</b>
<br><b>Also in that apartment...I woke up in the middle of the nite with
what I</b>
<br><b>thought was one of my children standing by my bed. This is not too
uncommon</b>
<br><b>of course..so I simply scooted over...still half asleep and said
come on in</b>
<br><b>by me. I was so tired that I don't remember feeling anyone coming
into the</b>
<br><b>bed or not. Well...in the morning&nbsp; niether one of my kids were
there so I</b>
<br><b>asked them which one came into my room last nite. Niether one of
them</b>
<br><b>had...that was rather wierd. Other than these happenings..which
are really</b>
<br><b>small..I realise..my husband has seen a white/gray dog in our current</b>
<br><b>apartment bathroom. We have owned no such dog and it shocked the
heck out of</b>
<br><b>him..he blinked and it was there still and then was gone. Our dog
which we</b>
<br><b>got a home for just a bit ago..use to start growling and barking
at corners</b>
<br><b>and our closet in our room. I don't know why we have these small
silly</b>
<br><b>occurences but none are scary when they happen...only when I am
fearing when</b>
<br><b>something will happen. Anyways..thanks for listening...got any ideas...let

<p><b>Most people have by now heard of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.&nbsp; On
April 19th</b>
<br><b>1995 the worst case scenario of a terrorist attack occurred here.&nbsp;
One</b>
<br><b>hundred sixty-eight innocent men, women and children died in a split
second</b>
<br><b>at 9:02am inside the Murrah Federal Building.&nbsp; The citizens
of the United</b>
<br><b>States and from other countries pulled together to assist those
of us who</b>
<br><b>live in Oklahoma and went away amazed at the strong bodies and hearts
of</b>
<br><b>Oklahomans as a whole.&nbsp; We proved ourselves to be survivors
in every sense</b>
<br><b>of the word.</b>
<br><b>What has not been noted are the many occurrences of Paranormal activity
that</b>
<br><b>occurred immediately after the bombing and continue today.&nbsp;
On the&nbsp; day of</b>
<br><b>the bombing and for several days afterward, Oklahoma City was pounded
with</b>
<br><b>numerous spring thunderstorms, normal for an Oklahoma spring time.&nbsp;
Three</b>
<br><b>days after the incident drivers heading South along the Broadway

<br><b>were witness to a lightning strike that occurred directly over the
Murrah</b>
<br><b>Building site.&nbsp; What was not normal was the fact that the strike
formed a</b>

<br><b>Most of the building rubble was carted away and has been used as
fill for</b>
<br><b>other building sites or as part of erosion control along Oklahoma's
numerous</b>

<br><b>few cases the sounds of voices can be heard.&nbsp; To date none
of these cases</b>
<br><b>has been substantiated, however in the case of the slab from the
Social</b>
<br><b>Security Office the last moments of the dying are strongly felt.</b>
<br><b>This last April I had to go to the new SS office to replace my Social</b>
<br><b>Security card.&nbsp; With me were two of my daughters Judy and Ruth,
ages 29 and</b>
<br><b>26.&nbsp; Judy, or J.R., as family members call her is our eldest
and extremely</b>
<br><b>sensitive to all things Paranormal.&nbsp; On this day as soon as
Judy entered the</b>
<br><b>building, she became agitated, and frightened.&nbsp; The SS office
is now in&nbsp; an</b>
<br><b>old mall which has converted the former shops into professional
offices.</b>
<br><b>The SS office is in the extreme&nbsp; back part of the mall about
100 yards from</b>
<br><b>the entrance.&nbsp; Throughout our stay in the building Judy refused
to enter the</b>
<br><b>SS office and paced continuously while I finished my business, a
period of</b>
<br><b>about 45 minutes.</b>
<br><b>As soon as I was done, Judy made a frightened dash to the entrance,
causing</b>
<br><b>Ruth and me to run to try and catch up with her.&nbsp; Once outside
I immediately</b>
<br><b>noted that Judy was ashen white in the face, sweating, and totally
out of</b>
<br><b>breath.&nbsp; Ruth then told us that there was a piece of the Murrah
Building</b>
<br><b>outside the new SS office, something we did not know at the time.&nbsp;
Once back</b>
<br><b>in our car Judy told us that as soon as she had entered the mall
she felt as</b>
<br><b>if she had been placed in a vacuum, she felt a sudden hot rush of
air then</b>
<br><b>felt as though someone had thrown a rock against her body immediately</b>
<br><b>followed by the sensation of all the air being sucked out of her
body,</b>
<br><b>suffocated she said.</b>
<br><b>I have no doubt that she felt all of this, as I myself had the feeling
or</b>
<br><b>rather sensation of the walls coming in towards me&nbsp; while in
the office,</b>
<br><b>this along with the fact that although the office was packed to
standing</b>
<br><b>room only that morning, I never heard any sound come from others
as they</b>
<br><b>spoke in the waiting room, it was as though all sound ceased once
in the</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; Indeed as one might expect inside a vacuum.</b>
<br><b>The memory is still alive, and unfortunately so is the last seconds
of the</b>
<br><b>dying.</b>

<p><b>By: TENNESSEETROUT@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>when i was about 6 years old we lived in the mountains of tennessee
on my</b>
<br><b>grandpa's farm.&nbsp; Weird things happened everyother night, a
car would pull up</b>
<br><b>to the door and you could see the headlights but when you opened
the door</b>
<br><b>their was no car or headlights and the door knob would start moving.&nbsp;
After i</b>
<br><b>grew up we went back to the old farm house and you could hear screaming
in</b>
<br><b>broad daylight and a blond hair lady looking out the window but
their was</b>
<br><b>padlocks&nbsp; on both doors . But the scariest thing that happened
was when my</b>
<br><b>sister and i was looking through the window remembering where our
grandmother</b>
<br><b>spent her last days their was a knock under the porch we looked
at each other</b>
<br><b>then ran like the dickens.&nbsp; We figured it was our imangination
so we went</b>
<br><b>back bad idea this time the knocking kept going then something said
get away.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;We did but the caretaker who lives up the holler hears a lady
screaming</b>
<br><b>about midnight every other night.&nbsp; We found out it's true i
got brave and</b>
<br><b>went their with a friend about five years ago at midnight and she's
screaming</b>
<br><b>her head off.&nbsp; I left and have never returned.</b>

<br><b>Telegraph Sending Key</b>
<p><b>By: Hossssg0000@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>My Uncle Roy Harold passed away this year in Jan. When his second
daughter</b>
<br><b>Carolyn came over to her father house to clean up and pack up the
family</b>
<br><b>belonging. She heard the clicking of the telegraph key sending out
the dot and</b>
<br><b>dashes. There was no battery hook up to the Key. My uncle was a
telegraph</b>
<br><b>operator working for the Gulf Oil Company back in his younger days.
It happened</b>
<br><b>again another time, I guess it was his signal to let her know everything
was</b>
<br><b>all right.</b>

<br><b>Grandparents Story</b>
<p><b>By: sjmeyens@home.com</b>
<p><b>I'm not sure if this is good enough, but it's the truth, and you
want real stories, right? Well if so, I have got a good one. This story
has been told to all 11 grandkids in my family. My mom and her two sisters
tell it to all the kids, my grandparents tell it too.&nbsp; Here it goes.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;A long time ago my grandpa's mom and dad, my great grandparents
went on a vacation.&nbsp; On there way home the were in a tragic car crash.
My great grandpa died instantly and my great grandma died wating for the
emergancy workers to get her out. They</b>
<br><b>always said they would die together.&nbsp; But that night, at my
grandparents home, where my grandparents and my uncle and my mom and two
aunts were living, there dog howled all night and there grandfather clock
stopped on the time of the accident. They had no idea of the accident yet.
Late into the night my great uncle woke up and saw my great grandma standing
at the bottem of his bed, touching his foot, and he knew she was saying
goodbye.&nbsp; The next day, my mom and two aunts were playing in there
front yard when they saw a car go by that was the same kind of car that
my great grandparents drove and two people in it that looked exactly like
my great grandparents.. they had to say goodbye to them too.</b>

<br><b>Standing By Me</b>
<p><b>By:Remolin Rodriguez [Remolin-X@webtv.net]</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Not until recently did my mom tell me about a friend of</b>
<br><b>hers who told her about how someone, a relative, who had passed
on; who</b>
<br><b>was by my side(I was 9). My parents didn't know actually who she
could</b>
<br><b>possibly be talking about. But, a few days later, my dad found out
his</b>
<br><b>mother had died.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My mother's friend also told her that she only came to</b>
<br><b>give me protection. BUT from WHAT to this day there is no answer
to this</b>
<br><b>question, (and I'm now 23), and my mother still has no idea why.
Back to</b>
<br><b>the story about me being 9 and my parents never told me anything
about</b>
<br><b>it and yes strange things did happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once When I</b>
<br><b>was a bit older, while me and my brother was watching tv, totally</b>
<br><b>forgetting that our mom and dad left to do grocery shopping, ( we
where</b>
<br><b>the only ones in the apartment mind you) someone or something called
my</b>
<br><b>brother's name out IN MY MOTHER'S VOICE!!&nbsp; We where into the
television</b>
<br><b>show, so we both got up a ran to the kitchen, ( when we were little
when</b>
<br><b>ever my mom or dad called one of us usually we both came), soon
to find</b>
<br><b>out nobody was there. We Freaked! That would not be the last of
this</b>
<br><b>either.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While living in the same apt one night, my brother got</b>
<br><b>waken up by our parakeets, who were flapping there wings as if they
was</b>
<br><b>trying desperately to get out of their cage.&nbsp; My brother (
who was</b>
<br><b>sleeping by my mother at the time) got up and went to check on the</b>
<br><b>birds. He saw a shadow of what he thought was ME! or what looked
like me</b>
<br><b>anyway he ran and wakeup my mother she got up and saw the same thing
he</b>
<br><b>saw.the shadow ran into MY room and disappeared! During that whole
time</b>
<br><b>I was asleep.In the morning my brother in told all about it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Around the time i first got to high school every once</b>
<br><b>in a while I would hear my mom or my dad's voice clearly calling
out my</b>
<br><b>name across a very busy and very nosily hallway all thou out the
four</b>
<br><b>years there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A certain thing would happen in the apartment we</b>
<br><b>moved in to, by this time it's been five years since we got there</b>
<br><b>several additions three dogs,fish etc..The most scariest of my events</b>
<br><b>was the time( me being 19 or so)watching television late at night
a</b>
<br><b>fight was brewing next door so i went to check it out thou the peep
hole</b>
<br><b>mind you all doors in the apt were closed my mom's room,my room,the</b>
<br><b>bathroom which my brother was taking a shower,and he usually slept
in</b>
<br><b>the living room</b>
<br><b>i heard my door open i looked slowly around the dogs all looked
in the</b>
<br><b>direction of the hall,i came slowly looking towards the hall and
saw my</b>
<br><b>door open like&nbsp; 4 to 5 inches my dog was in front of me AND
he knew and</b>
<br><b>came on his hunches and went in the room and he looked back at me
like</b>
<br><b>nothings here...(my door didn't have a lock or anything but it made
a</b>
<br><b>very loud rubbing noise and Hard to Open)turned on the light then
saw a</b>
<br><b>half circle made of liquid of some sort on the edge of MY bed i
looked</b>
<br><b>at it carefully to see what it could be.....(It was a perfect circle
it</b>
<br><b>was wet and i was truly Freaking at this point)</b>
<br><b>Running to my mom waking her up</b>
<br><b>and telling what i see.She just told me that probably the dog urinated</b>
<br><b>on my bed being that the bed was on the floor.....I eventually got
her</b>
<br><b>up when SHE saw it she just looked at me in amazement.I didnt sleep
that</b>
<br><b>night in my room.</b>
