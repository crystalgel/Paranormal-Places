<P><B>What Do You Think?</B><B></B>

<P><B>On 1119-01 me and my cousin and two other freinds we had not seen
in years</B>
<BR><B>stopped by to visit and we got on the subject of people we grew
up with and</B>
<BR><B>how they either started smoking drugs or just throwing their life
away well</B>
<BR><B>anyway we started talking about a freind of ours that had committed
suicided</B>
<BR><B>maybe a month ago the house he killed himself in was only about
4 houses</B>
<BR><B>away from us but we were all saying how we miss him and how he all
use to</B>
<BR><B>just hang out and talk like we were all doing when i swear on my
life the</B>
<BR><B>screen door opened up not wide but just enought for someone to squeeze
in</B>
<BR><B>and then the door slammed... we all looked like what the hell first
of all</B>
<BR><B>we live in houston texas and it does not get very cold down here
and no</B>
<BR><B>breeze was blowing at all the sun was shining very bright outside
that is</B>
<BR><B>why we were all sitting there with the door open talking but we
all said it</B>
<BR><B>was Daryl coming back to be a part of the gang......................</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Well, this has been my life!!!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: snicks1110@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Vicki and we will leave it at that because that is all
that is important in this life long experience. When I was 18 months old
my mother, father, and two older sisters moved into a 2 story home in Laingsburg
Michigan. The home I believe was built in the very early 1900s. Many a
family lived in that home but you will soon find that one particular family
besides mine plays a large roll in what I am about to tell you. Around
the time that I turned 2, the experiences started happening. My parents
and a few of there friends were playing cards, and my mother looked to
my father and thanked him for folding the laundry. My father, shyly, laughed
and said "Yeah Right." She was like "No really" and he told her that he
had not done it. My sisters being just 8 and 4 were called into the room,
for my parents to hear that they had not done so either. (I don't remember
this) but it is said that I looked up and calmly said, "Jesse did it."
My parents wanting to know who Jesse was questioned this, because our sitter,
whom baby sat us in her home, her name was Paula. I just said "The nice
lady that comes in my room." My parents passed it off as an imaginary friend,
but could never explain the laundry. These things kept happening inside
the home, and became more frequent. My parents would hear me talking at
night and would come to my room and I would be setting Indian style at
the end of my bed with my gaze fixed up into the air. They said they would
listen and it would be like I would carry on a conversation. Waiting for
whom ever I was speaking to, to reply. If they made any quick movement,
or made noise, the gaze would stop and all would be normal again. So now
they truly believed that there 2 year old daughter had an imaginary friend.
Things went on like this for a while. Things coming up missing, being moved,
doors shutting, water turning on, toilets flushing etc. When one fine day
my mother got to experience this for herself. She was in front of her vanity
doing the morning ritual of getting ready for work. She would sit at the
vanity (I would be curled at her feet, I had taken to sleeping in my parents
bed at this time) well this particular morning as she was finishing up,
the bathroom became very cold, "Deathly cold" as my mother still puts it
and as she turned to the mirror a faint, mist like image came between her
view and the mirror. She said it then moved down her legs and over me,
I stirred a little, not awaking. She said she grabbed me quickly and walked
from the room, and to my father to relay what had just happened. Being
the skeptical that he is he just kind of laughed and shrugged it off...
Until Thanksgiving the year I was 4. We had packed up and went to Indiana
to a family members for the Holiday. Upon returning dad was walking to
the house and got very cold. For some reason it had snowed early this year
and our house was on a hill, where all the neighborhood kids would go sledding.
Dad said he remembers it being odd that no kids were there, until he came
upon the walk passing by the front porch. (You see we entered through the
rear of the home, due to a large refrigerator being in front of the front
door. Just not enough room for appliances in country kitchens with too
much counter space, as he always said) He stopped and glanced onto the
porch to see a large red spot. He said he remembers walking up to it thinking
one of the kids sledding must have got a bloody nose... But he thought
that is an awful lot of blood and the re was a trail leading towards the
door, not towards the hill. He was worried but just walked to the rear
of the home to let the rest of the family in. Walking into the kitchen
from the rear entry way he walked to the fridge and again the trail of
red picked up in front of the refrigerator. He followed the trail through
the dinning room and living room and then down the hall leading to the
Den and then into the closet, there he found a handkerchief with someone
else's initials, JCW, inside the closet but no more red stuff. The cops
were phoned due to my parents believing someone had broke in. No locks
were broken, the handkerchief was taken by the police and the red stuff
was presumed to be paint. (Dad was not believing it) They cleaned it up
and it came up rather quickly. Dad added a couple more locks and went on
with life. Things continued to happen and my parents eventually split and
the home was sold, but not before Mom did some final research...</B>
<BR><B>In 1930s a young woman named Jessica Whiltmur lived in the home
with her husband. She provided sitting services for one of the widowed
gentlemen of the town. His wife died in child birth and at the age of 2
the little girls aunt could no longer bare the responsibility. So Jessica
took over the job of the little girls over seer. Jessica Whiltmur's husband
was somewhat of a crazy, (They believe he was what is called now Schizophrenic)
one day in a fit of rage went after Jessica while the little girl was still
within the home. He found them in the den closet and stabbed Jessica in
the chest then just turned and left. Jessica then carried the little girl
through the den, down the hall, through the livingroom, then dinning room
and out the kitchens front door.&nbsp; Well, as history shows the little
girl and father moved away, and Mr. Whiltmur was taken into custody. What
happened to Jessica Christine l? The papers and archives said that she
lay there on the front porch holding the little Victoria, in her arms and
bleed to death.</B>
<BR><B>I truly feel she found her chance to settle things with that poor
little Victoria, when this poor little Vicki and her family moved in. She
never harmed or tried to frighten us. But now as I am older and have my
2 children and am married, I feel her presence has gone. I believe she
has found her peace.....</B>
<BR><B>These are all pieces of information talked about around town, found
in archives, and old newspapers. But even after moving I still repeatedly
would feel her presence, always feel calm, and always feel watched over.
I try not to tell this story often due to not wanting to sound crazy...
But now I have found you and others like me who have been there.. And so
I ask..Are these all coincidence? Can the artifacts from all those years
really be what was found with in the home? And will a person not ready
to go, and feeling that there is unfinished business really stay around
until they are at peace? Please if you could take the time, e-mail me and
try to answer these questions for me... I am 23 and truly feel like I was
blessed by an unknown woman who loved me.</B>

<BR><B>We Got Her Attention...</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:quagameefi@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Chris and I live in Norfolk,
Virginia.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;This is an account of my third ghostly experience</B>
<BR><B>during my 24 years of life.&nbsp; I only include this</B>
<BR><B>account because of its undeniability.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been trusted by family friends to
take care</B>
<BR><B>of their home and pets while they were away on</B>
<BR><B>business ventures and other things which required</B>
<BR><B>their absence from home here in Norfolk.&nbsp; They had</B>
<BR><B>always been honest with me regarding the fact that the</B>
<BR><B>ghost of a girl has been present in the house for as</B>
<BR><B>long as they had lived there.&nbsp; While I do believe in</B>
<BR><B>ghosts and the supernatural because of previous</B>
<BR><B>experiences of my own, I was not alarmed by their</B>
<BR><B>accounts, nor was I scared to assume the</B>
<BR><B>responsibilities requested of me in their home.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For years I would show up to take care
of home</B>
<BR><B>maintenance while they went out of town.&nbsp; This</B>
<BR><B>included lawn care, but more importantly the care of</B>
<BR><B>their dog... a very large black lab, named Ned.&nbsp; For</B>
<BR><B>the sake of security, I had been left instructions to</B>
<BR><B>leave lights on at night and to also leave the</B>
<BR><B>television or radio on at all times.&nbsp; On several</B>
<BR><B>occasions I would come into the house to find that the</B>
<BR><B>radio or television station had been changed or that</B>
<BR><B>lights not touched by me would be turned on or off.</B>
<BR><B>Occasionally, I would come into the house in the</B>
<BR><B>winter time and the ceiling fan would be on.&nbsp; I would</B>
<BR><B>turn it off and take care of business, then leave.&nbsp; It</B>
<BR><B>would be on again when I returned so I'd just turn it</B>
<BR><B>off again and handle my responsibilities.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would always make mention of these occurences</B>
<BR><B>to the people who lived here and they would</B>
<BR><B>acknowledge my claims as normal events.&nbsp; For my own</B>
<BR><B>comfort, they allowed me to bring my friend, Tyrone</B>
<BR><B>whenever I came because they trusted him as I did and</B>
<BR><B>knew him to be as credible as myself.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tyrone, loved Ned, the dog, and would always
play</B>
<BR><B>with him while I handled my duties in the home.&nbsp; One</B>
<BR><B>time, however, we were both wrestling with the dog so</B>
<BR><B>intensely that the house was shaking as we bounced and</B>
<BR><B>ran around the living room.&nbsp; Soon the dog was panting</B>
<BR><B>and we were worn out so we let the dog out into the</B>
<BR><B>backyard to do his business so we could leave.&nbsp; We</B>
<BR><B>hung out by the door in the kitchen waiting for the</B>
<BR><B>dog to finish.&nbsp; Soon enough, we let the dog in and</B>
<BR><B>proceeded across the kitchen into the living room.</B>
<BR><B>Tyrone was ahead of me by acouple of inches and we</B>
<BR><B>both reached the doorway at about the same instant.</B>
<BR><B>As we entered into the living room, I noticed in my</B>
<BR><B>periferal vision that a shadow had passed the bedroom</B>
<BR><B>doorway upstairs.&nbsp; Instantly, Tyrone turned to me with</B>
<BR><B>huge eyes and we asked each other simultaneously, "Did</B>
<BR><B>you see that!!?"&nbsp; We dashed out the front door and</B>
<BR><B>quickly locked it.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the car, we recounted the incident.&nbsp;
I saw</B>
<BR><B>only a shadow passing the door.&nbsp; Tyrone swears to this</B>
<BR><B>day that the thing he saw was blue.&nbsp; When we again saw</B>
<BR><B>the people living in the house, we explained what had</B>
<BR><B>happened.&nbsp; They then told us the complete story of the</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; Apperently it is the second house to have</B>
<BR><B>occupied that site.&nbsp; The first house had burned down</B>
<BR><B>and a young girl died in the blaze.&nbsp; She was unaware</B>
<BR><B>of the fire and was consumed by it while she slept...</B>
<BR><B>wearing a blue nightgown.&nbsp; Freaky.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This event is one hundred percent true
and</B>
<BR><B>accurate as I experienced it, and has been recounted</B>
<BR><B>to everyone I know that has been on the subject of</B>
<BR><B>suprenatural events with me at one time or another.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>am only completely happy to share it with anyone who</B>
<BR><B>is interested, so naturally I submit it to your site.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Wandering Crucifix</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Kgeorges71@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My story may be of some minor interest.&nbsp; I grew up in the early
80's in a very small, rural village in French-speaking Quebec.&nbsp; As
with most children at that time, I attended a small parochial Catholic
school (total population 50 students).&nbsp; The school, like many in Quebec,
used to be run by nuns. In fact the whole third floor of the school used
to be a private chapel and dormitory for the nuns. By the time I was attending
school there, the third floor had been abandoned for about 20 years.</B>
<BR><B>Most of the time we were forbidden to go up to the third floor.&nbsp;
However, when we did go (usually to retrieve Christmas decorations, or
school prop usually stored there), it always left us a bit stunned and
uncomfortable.&nbsp; The dusty yellow light streaming through the abandoned
chapel and empty bedrooms was a gloomy picture.&nbsp; We never relished
going up there unless we absolutely had to.</B>
<BR><B>Not surprisingly the school was thought to be haunted. I do not
know of any specific legend but I do have a shared personal experience
that could lend credence to this idea.&nbsp; When I was in sixth grade,
my eight fellow students and me were reciting our French grammar lessons
when the heavy wood and pewter crucifix nailed above the blackboard, suddenly
detached itself and literally flew about 10 feet before landing in front
of one of the student's desk.&nbsp; All of us, including the teacher were
absolutely stunned, since both the windows and the door of the classroom
were closed.&nbsp; After the stunned silence, our teacher bade us to go
back to the lesson but even we could tell that she was as uneasy as we
were.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although this event did not take place in the abandoned
chapel and had no repercussion (no, the kid in front of whose desk to crucifix
landed did not have anything unusual happen to him), this left us, even
less likely to go venture to the nun's dormitory.</B>
<BR><B>Even two decade afterwards, when I see some of my childhood friends,
we still mentioned the occurrence. It is not everyday that this type of
event has ten witnesses!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Voice on the Answering Machine</B><B></B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>This is not my experience, it is my brother's experience.&nbsp; First
I want to</B>
<BR><B>mention that My Mom Passed Away on August 11th of this past year.&nbsp;
She did</B>
<BR><B>suffer many complications of Diabetes with going to dialysis.&nbsp;
My dad always</B>
<BR><B>took very good care of her but had suffered a very deep caregivers
depression</B>
<BR><B>the early part of this year and needed to be hospitalized for 5
weeks.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>Quit my Job and took care of her on a 24/7 basis. Not an easy task
taking</B>
<BR><B>care of a loved one.&nbsp; I found myself also getting depressed.
My Brother in</B>
<BR><B>the beginning was at the house with his wife and his wife really
helped out</B>
<BR><B>with the Therapy and hospital equipment that we needed for my Mom.&nbsp;
She works</B>
<BR><B>in a Medical Facility so has access to all of this.&nbsp; What I
am trying to get</B>
<BR><B>at is they think they have done so much.&nbsp; But I am the one
who did the bull</B>
<BR><B>work. My brother would come to the house and spend&nbsp; just maybe
a half an hour</B>
<BR><B>and leave and not too often.&nbsp; He didn't share in the responsibility
of my</B>
<BR><B>mom's personal care except for when I just refused to go over and
he was</B>
<BR><B>forced to. I had to after all take care of my personal emotions
also and he</B>
<BR><B>always told me to get over it.&nbsp; Anyway I grieved badly after
she passed and</B>
<BR><B>he would tell me to get over it because he doesn't feel bad because
he</B>
<BR><B>doesn't miss her the way she was.&nbsp; I tell him I am not looking
at that I am</B>
<BR><B>looking at the whole picture and the memories I have of her and
things we</B>
<BR><B>shared throughout our whole life.&nbsp; Before my Mom was very sick,
She would beg</B>
<BR><B>him to come over and visit and he just lived down the street.&nbsp;
I would call</B>
<BR><B>him to tell him.&nbsp; But he never did. Always had an excuse. I
think those times</B>
<BR><B>he thinks about and feels guilty.&nbsp; And he has not gone to the
cemetery to</B>
<BR><B>visit her grave site, which is in a beautiful mausoleum.&nbsp; No
reason not to</B>
<BR><B>go.&nbsp; I feel good that she is in there and it was her wishes.&nbsp;
Now to the</B>
<BR><B>point.&nbsp; MY brother received two phone messages on his answering
machine last</B>
<BR><B>week.&nbsp; The first message the person just said JON.&nbsp; Which
is his name.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>second Message said "HEY JON" .&nbsp; He called me and made me listen
to them</B>
<BR><B>because it is my mothers voice on both messages.&nbsp; I couldn't
believe it.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>know he is scared somewhat..he saved the messages and played it
for my dad on</B>
<BR><B>Thanksgiving and My dad couldn't believe it.&nbsp; He said that
is your mother.</B>
<BR><B>Me and my dad think that she is contacting him that way just to
let him know</B>
<BR><B>"why haven't you come to see me" and probably because of the things
he says.</B>
<BR><B>But me and my dad snicker because we could tell my brother is a
little</B>
<BR><B>afraid.&nbsp; But it is unbelievable how that is her voice and exactly
how she use</B>
<BR><B>to call my brother on the phone when she left a message.&nbsp; I
am sorry the</B>
<BR><B>story was so long.&nbsp; But I felt I need to explain first so you
can have an</B>
<BR><B>idea what is happening.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Chocojo24@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My friend, Sophie, lives in a mansion and she is sure its haunted.
Because when everyone is asleep she can hear footsteps and creaking of
the floorboards, and once she heard a noise and it sounded like wailing,
she has also heard people calling her name in the night. She gets scared
and sleeps at her dads nearly every night. Sometimes she can feel cold
things touching her feet and when she goes into her mums bed she cant feel
anything. Its as if thres a curse on her room or it is haunted and doesn't
want to leave her alone or leave the room.</B>

<P><B>The Room Under the Stairs</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Hephaistion01@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was a child, I lived in a home on Chicago's northwest side,
which was once a one-family Victorian home, but at some time during the
50s or 60s, converted into a duplex. My grandparents lived upstairs, and
my family (parents &amp; two sisters &amp; me) lived downstairs. There
was also a large basement, the front part was finished, but the back area,
the larger part, was not, where the washer &amp; dryer were. My folks had
cleaned up the front area in the late 70s, and made it into something of
a playroom for my two younger sisters and I, and it was generally cheerful.
The staircase leading upstairs to a main hall way (and either to our house,
or up another flight of stairs to my grandparent's place) was very old,
and creaked when you walked on it, despite it having been carpeted when
my parents fixed the room up. in the corner of the room nearest the staircase
was a bar, but my folks didn't use it anymore, and had piled up our games
and toys on top of it and on the shelves under it. Behind that was a doorway
shape</B>
<BR><B>d row of bookshelves, most of which were empty. The bottom two were
filled with old knick-knacks. I remember my dad telling me once that there
used to be a door there when they first moved in, and a little space under
the stairs, but when they fixed up the room, they took the door off and
walled the doorway up and turned it into bookshelves.When I was in the
room alone as a kid, I didn't feel comfortable, no matter how brightly
lit or what time of the day it was. It always felt like you were being
watched no matter where you went, but as soon as you walked into the back
part of the basement, the unfinished, grungy area, it stopped (which is
weird, you'd think it'd be the other way around usually!). The feeling
seemed to be the strongest near the corner behind the bar, by the doorway-bookshelves.
One time, maybe a year or so before we moved out, when I was about 12 or
so, I had a buddy over, and we had sleeping bags on the floor of what we
called the playroom. We were freaking each other out by telling scary stories,
and by the time we decided to go to sleep, it was difficult to, because
we were so creeped out, but we eventually did. I remember being shaken
awake, in the pitch dark, by my buddy, who was crying and pointing towards
the corner frantically. I looked and saw nothing, but felt something ominous
eminating from that area, so much so th</B>
<BR><B>at we raced upstairs, and ran into my bedroom, and fell asleep there.
It wasn't until the next morning, my friend told me what had happened.
He said that something caused him to suddenly wake up, and he looked in
the corner and saw a large black shadowy form hovering in the corner, in
the doorframe. He tried to yell for me to wake up, but no sound came out
of his throat. He looked away for a second and it was gone, and that's
when he went over to me and started to wake me up.</B>
<BR><B>I'd never actually seen anything, but after that, was wary about
going down in that room alone. My sisters had the same feeling, and both
told me that they hated to go down there for very long.When we were moving
a couple years later, I asked my dad if I could see what the room under
the stairs looked like, since he had taken the shelving down and it was
just pieces of plywood that had closed up the doorway. He agreed and removed
the sheets of plywood with a hammer and I was able to peek through the
doorframe into the tiny space with a flashlight and was underwhelmed. It
was simply the underside of the stairs, and a small empty area you couldn't
even stand up in or walk more than a couple feet in either direction. There
was nothing in it, except for one item we found nailed to the wall, which
was a small, yellowed and curled up sepia-toned photograph of a young man,
his head and shoulders only, with dark eyes and hair looking expressionlessly
into the camera. From his clothing and hairstyle my dad guessed it must've
been taken around the turn of the century. We never knew why the photo
of the man was on a wall no one would ever see, or who put it there or
when, or who he was, and left it where it</B>
<BR><B>where we found it. If the man in the picture had anything to do
with the unnerving feeling in that room, or the thing that my friend saw
that night, I still don't know.</B>
<BR><B>The house is still there, though I don't get to the area very often,
I often wonder if whoever lives there now has felt what I felt in the basement
room.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Puzzle</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pearso_c@bellsouth.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>this is short but not so sweet, a jigsaw puzzle was taken apart in
my bedroom while I was sleeping on the couch, there is no rational explanation
for it, there is not any person who could have done it because I live alone,
I have no pets, no rodent problems, it was'nt just taken apart it looks

<P><B>1ST STORY: One of my closets friends house is haunted. Every time
friends</B>
<BR><B>come over the house it starts acting weird, does weird things. I
went over</B>
<BR><B>one time and, the phone rang and we answered it and it continued
to ring up</B>
<BR><B>stairs so we hung up and ran up stairs and it did the exact opposite.
And it</B>
<BR><B>did this about 5 times then finally we answered it one last time
we heard</B>
<BR><B>breathing then a click.</B>
<BR><B>2ND STORY: I went back to my friends house the next weekend, and
we were on</B>
<BR><B>the phone, all the sudden we heard the door open (she has an alarm)
and we</B>
<BR><B>thought it was her grandma who lives down stairs, but grandma screamed
stay</B>
<BR><B>inside OK, and we said wasn't that you she said no, we didn't say
nothing but</B>
<BR><B>like 30 min later her grandma was a sleep and it happened again
but it was</B>
<BR><B>only the downstairs alarm going off not the upstairs, and then we
went</B>
<BR><B>downstairs and it happened up stairs and it did that 6 or 7 times.
And it</B>
<BR><B>stops. And night though when I spend the night, we hear footsteps

<BR><B>This House is Haunted</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Purplestar1079@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>The house (which my half brother lives in) that i grew up in is haunted</B>
<BR><B>I grew up in S.Attleboro Mass in the house where my half brother
now lives.&nbsp; I am told by my mother that my great grandmother and grandfather
passed away in the house, and recall so many strange incidents.&nbsp; Along
with such things as lights, t.v, toys going on and off by themselves, and
my older sister always complaining because she would plug in her curling
iron to heat up only to come back and find it unplugged, there are several
stories which to this day make the hair on my arm stand up.</B>
<BR><B>One night (I must have been about 9) I was washing dishes at the
sink.&nbsp; To the left of me were the stairs to the basement where my
grandfather once had a dark room.&nbsp; I looked over for some reason to
see a blue colored figure of a man walking up the steps towards me.&nbsp;
I could not make out any facial features, not that I stayed long enough
to catch a better look before running to my mother.</B>
<BR><B>Another time my mother younger sister and I were watching t.v in
my mom's room.&nbsp; My mother was extremely mad because my older sister
was not home from her date yet.&nbsp; My older sister's bedroom was upstairs
in the attic, and her door only locked from the outside.&nbsp; We heard
the door to her room open and close and someone walking up the stairs.&nbsp;
My mother go up to go and yell at her for being home so late and the door
was locked.&nbsp; Needless to say my sister was not home and there is no
way someone could have gone upstairs because the door was still locked.</B>
<BR><B>One time my older sister and I decided to use the Ouija board.&nbsp;
My sister lit two candles and put one on each side of the board.&nbsp;
She began by asking if there were any spirits in the house to give us a
sign.&nbsp; At that time both candles went out at the same time and there
were no windows in the room.&nbsp; There is no way she could have blown
them out and I know I did not do it.</B>
<BR><B>My grandmother used to baby-sit us while my mother worked, and all
of a sudden she would just say "Take your hand off my shoulder."&nbsp;
I would be watching t.v and I would feel fingers drumming on my shoulder.</B>
<BR><B>My half brother now lives in the house with my nephew who is a year
younger than I am (I am 22 now).&nbsp; A few months ago I ran into my nephew
who asked me if he could ask me a question without me thinking he was nuts.&nbsp;
He asked me if the house is haunted.&nbsp; Obviously you know what my answer
was.&nbsp; They never did me any harm but I still get chills when I think
of all the weird stuff that happened and to the best of my knowledge still
does.</B>

<P><B>The Ghost WHo Liked Music</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;My name is Ryan and I am 14 years old. My experience with
ghosts started happening last year. One ordinary day, I was at my friends
house. He was saying all this stuff about having a ghost in his room. At
first I didn't believe him. Not until he turned out the lights and then
some white figure came out. This was no trick of his because we were the
only ones in the house. The ghost never talked or moved at all. He just
stood there...STARING RIGHT AT US!!! My friend and I tried to get his mom
and dad believe us, but they think we are just seeing things. Thats when
weird stuff started to happen. The temperature started to go down, windows
were opening on their own. but they still never believed us. Soon after
that we tried to communicate with the spirit, but he just never awnsered
us. So we just gave up on that and started to call him Marvin. He must
have HATED that. Because he never showed himself after that. Weeks passed
by, so sign of old Marvin... up until I brought a CD o!</B>
<BR><B>ver to my friends house. We played it loud. Then old Marvin shows
up and walked up toward the bed, where I was sitting. And just kept staring.
We then switched CDs. Marvin vanished, then we put the first CD back on.
He came back. We are wondering why he only shows up when that one CD is
on.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>THe Blackout</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: wengles@iprimus.com.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi.My name is&nbsp; Fiona and I'm 11yrs. now.I've had 2 experiences
including 2 ghosts,1 in each story,a few years ago.</B>
<BR><B>I think it was the end of last year,the whole family went 2 my cousins
house for a special occation.When I got to my cousins house we played for
a while.a few hours before dark.than when the whole family arrived,almost
all my cousins that were there went into my cousins room.Ann(i won't use
her real name)took her ouiji board out and set it up.i don't remember much
but i think we were talking 2 an evil spirit and a good spirit.After playing
you're supposed 2 say "Amen,Amen,Amen",most of my cousins did that,but
a few just left the rom without saying it.</B>
<BR><B>The family was still there and nearly allmy cousins were asleep.I
was falling asleep,when suddenly the lights went out.It was a blackout!When
the lights turned on again,my uncles fixed that power box outside,there
was nothing wrong with it though,Ann asked all my cousins if we said Amen
3 times.We all said yes except 4 about 5 of them.this was their first time
using a ouiji board and they didn't know we had 2 say Amen 3 times.So any
way they said Amen 3 times.Then everything was back to normal.</B>
<BR><B>The next story is a short story.</B>
<BR><B>My cousin,Soncey,and his wife just moved into a new house.They hadn't
had a house blessing yet.I slept there with Ann(we slept over there)and
my little brother.The next afternoon,Ann was going to have a shower.She
told me to answere the phone if it rang.She went upstairs 2 have her shower
and I was left downstairs,by myself.</B>
<BR><B>Igot bored and started looking around from where I was sittng.Suddenly,something
just jumped out from behind a wall.It was a figure of a man witha suit
on and a perfect tie.And a&nbsp; hat.</B>
<BR><B>I ran upstairs 2 my little brother and told him about the ghost.Then
I told Ann and she told Soncey.</B>
<BR><B>From then on it never showed again.</B><B></B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Its not much of a huge story just pretty cool and involves ghosts.</B><B></B>

<P><B>A long time ago maybe 6 months a girl came to a friend of mines dream.
He</B>
<BR><B>told me the next day how scary it was and I was just begining to
realize my</B>
<BR><B>many powers one being is that I can communicate with spirits. Anyways
he had</B>
<BR><B>told me his whole dream and he said I don't know what to do so I
told him</B>
<BR><B>tell her to come to me and I will help her. So when he told her
too I felt a</B>
<BR><B>weird presence and when I closed my eyes to talk to her I saw a
beautiful</B>
<BR><B>young girl maybe 18 19 years old and she was giving off a blue light
so I</B>
<BR><B>asked what is wrong and she responded I died without getting to
say good-bye</B>
<BR><B>to my boyfrined so I said I would help however possible so I used
telepathy</B>
<BR><B>to tell her boyfriend she says bye. Anyways just recently maybe
1 month ago</B>
<BR><B>she returned this time to my cousin leaving footprints in his room
once he</B>
<BR><B>vaccumed so I said send the ghost to me so when the ghost arrived
it was her</B>
<BR><B>again in search of her mother. So after leading her to Michigan
I didnt hear</B>
<BR><B>from her again. But who knows when she may return.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Strange Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: andreaw@ameritech.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, first of all I just want to tell you how great your website</B>
<BR><B>is!!!&nbsp; I feel very compelled to get this off my chest so here</B>
<BR><B>is my story:</B>
<BR><B>I have had several "strange" experiences throughout my life.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Most notably dead people coming to me in dreams with warnings</B>
<BR><B>and a very strange encounter on two separate occasions with the</B>
<BR><B>same woman at the Harold Washington Chicago Public Library who</B>
<BR><B>then vanished.&nbsp; However, something that happened to me last
year</B>
<BR><B>that was extremely frightening.</B>
<BR><B>Since I was a very small child I can remember feelings of my</B>
<BR><B>bed shaking from time to time in one particular house we lived</B>
<BR><B>in.&nbsp; However, I got so used to it I just accepted it as part</B>
<BR><B>of my normal life and never said anything to anyone or gave it</B>
<BR><B>a lot of thought.&nbsp; I never really thought it was normal, but</B>
<BR><B>accepted it as part of my room's charm from time to time.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>am now an adult and had not had a bed shaking experience since</B>
<BR><B>then...until last year.</B>
<BR><B>I was on tour with a theatre production in Montana and we were</B>
<BR><B>staying one night in a very small town called Noxon.&nbsp; It is
a</B>
<BR><B>beautiful area way up in the mountains and the motel we stayed</B>
<BR><B>at was really small.&nbsp; There were no phones in the room, the
payphone</B>
<BR><B>outside didn't even really work well, cell phones didn't work,</B>
<BR><B>very remote.&nbsp; I live in the city and was completely in awe
of</B>
<BR><B>the area.&nbsp; It was amazing.&nbsp; We spent the day walking around
the</B>
<BR><B>beautiful area and then had dinner and drinks at the one bar</B>
<BR><B>on the gravel road that was the town.&nbsp; We drank quite a bit
of</B>
<BR><B>alcohol that night and I drank a lot more than I usually do,</B>
<BR><B>but absolutely do not attribute the night's events to the alcohol.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I wanted to!</B>
<BR><B>I went to bed around 1 AM in room #2 at that motel. I woke up,</B>
<BR><B>definitely feeling drunk, to the feeling of my body being shaken.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;There was no clock in the room and I had put my pager by my</B>
<BR><B>bed. It was around 2 AM.&nbsp; I assumed I was just drunk and went</B>
<BR><B>back to sleep quite easily, still feeling quite out of it from</B>
<BR><B>the alcohol.&nbsp; Shortly after that I was again awoke, this time</B>
<BR><B>violently shaking and feeling my bed violently shaking as well.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I looked at my pager, about 2:45 AM.&nbsp; I again just fought
it</B>
<BR><B>and told myself it was the alcohol and passed out.&nbsp; Awhile
later</B>
<BR><B>I woke up being shaken so violently I was absolutely terrified.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I felt my body and the bed shaking so powerfully I wanted
to</B>
<BR><B>scream so bad but I was frozen in fear.&nbsp; I realized I had to</B>
<BR><B>deal with this situation.&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew it was not just the
alochol</B>
<BR><B>and I no longer even felt tipsy.&nbsp; I somehow got my body still</B>
<BR><B>and I could actually see the bed still shaking violently and</B>
<BR><B>was so scared.&nbsp; My pager said 4something AM.&nbsp; I couldn't
call</B>
<BR><B>anyone else from the tour, there were no phones, there was no</B>
<BR><B>cell usuage in the area, and there was no way I was moving from</B>
<BR><B>right where I was.&nbsp; I have never felt so frozen in fear in
my</B>
<BR><B>life.&nbsp; When I was fully awake the bed then seemed to stop slowly,</B>
<BR><B>as if it faded out almost, and I heard creaking as if someone</B>
<BR><B>was walking on the other side of the wall where the sink/bathroom</B>
<BR><B>area was.&nbsp; I could honestly feel a presence in that room.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>listened so carefully to see if it was just an animal outside</B>
<BR><B>or my imagination but it was inside the room and there was no</B>
<BR><B>doubt in my mind, I could feel it.&nbsp; I layed in bed terrifed
for</B>
<BR><B>what seemed like forever until the walking/creaking/WHATEVER</B>
<BR><B>stopped.&nbsp; I then felt a sense of peace in the room, as if something</B>
<BR><B>was still there but content that I was awake with it. I went</B>
<BR><B>into frozen "half-sleep" until 6 AM when my friend knocked on</B>
<BR><B>the door to "wake me", ha!.</B>
<BR><B>I have never booked out of somewhere so fast in my life.&nbsp; I
turned</B>
<BR><B>every light on, showered so fast with the shower curtain wide</B>
<BR><B>open, packed up, and headed out by myself to go walking to the</B>
<BR><B>gravel road in search of coffee and sanity and try and make sense</B>
<BR><B>in my head of what had happened.&nbsp; I was more afraid of staying</B>
<BR><B>in that room than walking in the near wilderness in the early</B>
<BR><B>morning dark fog by myself. When I got back the rest of the group</B>
<BR><B>was out and ready to go and when we pulled out away from that</B>
<BR><B>motel I will never forget looking at that door to my room #2.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;It's indescrible the feeling I had, not only being shaken
but</B>
<BR><B>of knowing someone or thing was in there with me.&nbsp;&nbsp; There
was</B>
<BR><B>no staff there that morning for me to ask but someday I'll get</B>
<BR><B>the courage to write them and ask if they know what the deal</B>
<BR><B>is with that room.&nbsp; Something REALLY wanted me awake and it
succeeded.</B>
<BR><B>When I got my pictures back from that tour a picture I had taken</B>
<BR><B>in that town during the day of some friends in front of the bar</B>
<BR><B>we went to, had a very strange, ghostly like figure almost posing</B>
<BR><B>with them.&nbsp; It truly looks like this.&nbsp; It could be the
sunlight,</B>
<BR><B>I have no idea, but it's a very strange picture.&nbsp; It is the
only</B>
<BR><B>picture on the roll with anything like that in it, and people</B>
<BR><B>who didn't know my shaking bed story would look at it and be</B>
<BR><B>creeped out, immediately asking me what in the world that is.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I wish I knew!!!!&nbsp; The most calming theory someone has
given</B>
<BR><B>me is that some lovely, non-evil, lonely mountain spirt decided</B>
<BR><B>it liked me and decided to hang with me all day, posed for the</B>
<BR><B>picture, went out with me that night for dinner and drinks, and</B>
<BR><B>just didn't want to the fun to end so it decided me up all night.</B>

<P><B>Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SISCheshireFrog@cs.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>In May, I was staying at my step family's house for a week. I was
staying in the guest room in the back and though we never put the air conditioning
on, I was nearly freezing at night and requested 4 or 5 blankets, sometimes
awakening to a strange shadow by the closet, though I never regarded it
to much of an extent. I had brought my radio, and the second day into the
week, as I played it while doing my homework for math, it suddenly started
becoming staticky, changing to a salsa-type station, though it was all
the way on the other side of the scale thingy, it being at 98.1, and my
station set on 106.7. I wouldn't think much about it until later that year
on Halloween....</B>
<BR><B>Also, on Halloween this year (2001, the Full Moon Halloween), I
was visiting my step family. They are of a Latin heritage, so of course
they would have a lot of salsa music; also, in this family's case, beer
and chips (I perfer the chips ^__^). Anyway, we were getting ready to take
the younger kids out trick-or-treating when I heard a light banging on
a wall in the hallway or in a room nearby. I, being the only curious one
(I suppose), walked down to the hallway, while the banging continued. Once
I reached the end of the hallway, it stopped, stopping me as well.</B>
<BR><B>After a few seconds of hesitation, I began to walk further back,
calling out to see if perhaps a family member had snuck back there when
I hadn't been paying attention. As I walked into the guest room, I found
that it was nearly completely dark except for the light from the setting
sun shining through; still, it was pretty dark. I was about to turn back
and go back to my mom, but then the blinds began to move, though the fan
was not on and the window was shut, the air not being on either. It was
rather stuffy. I walked over to see if maybe a lizard had gotten into the
blinds. Nope; nothing, but a rather disturbing cold. I actually began to
shiver until I stepped away and walked back to the doorway. As I was walking
back down the hall, the banging picked back up, though I ignored it this
time.</B>
<BR><B>After we got back from our neighborhood rounds, everyone made their
way out to the terrace, leaving me alone in the house. I was washing a
dish when I heard the banging again, and I walked into the guest room in
the back again. It stopped later; when I reached the doorway. It stopped
so abruptly that it alarmed me. I glanced around once more and noticed
the window now being open. I was about to go shut it, then decided against
it. I stood staring at the window, and suddenly I heard a phrase spoken
in Spanish, basically inaudibly; something like, "Lucy? Quiero comida;
fruta, por favor," though I'm not sure if that was it; it was pretty much
hard to recognize. I'm guessing on what I heard.</B>
<BR><B>I said out loud, "What? I can't understand you," and I heard almost
an irritated hiss and it quickly became cold. I quickly made my way out
and as I reached the end of the hall, the door slammed. By this time, I
was pretty flustered and creeped out and all that lovely stuff.</B>
<BR><B>I asked my step dad if anyone had died in this house. He told me
about his grandfather who died in the back room, which is now the guest
room. He used to sleep there. I asked him about banging. He replied, saying
that he used to bang the walls to get the attention of the other people
living in the house (my step family). He also told me his brother refuses
to go in there anymore, and that his mother went in once, hearing a banging,
and tries hard not to go in there too often.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Something to Share</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: liljamur67@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello there, i love reading all the stories that people talk about
and I just wanted to share an experience I have had. I am seventeen years
old and my experience happened when I was 15 so it wasn't too long ago.
My family and I used to live in Japan, where my father was stationed because
his ship was station at the naval base of Yokosuka Japan. We didn't exactly
live on the base, but we lived on another one at least twenty minutes away
called Ikego. Everyone has told me that Ikego used to be a war ground but
i never thought that much of it. Well anyway, we lived in a townhouse which
was quite comfortable eventhough it was a little small. My room window
faced the woods because I used to like to look out that them during the
day while doing my homework. Well I usually keep the window open to let
in a nice breeze in at night. So it was a late, summer night and I usually
stay up so I can watch the sunrise but to pass the time I started reading
books while lying in bed. I must have drifted off or something but my dream
was nothing different from reality. Because I was in the same position,
and all the lights were on in my room and the book I was reading was still
propped on my stomache. Things seemed a little brighter though and there
was a sudden feeling that caused me to look over on my left side. My eyes
widened with horror with what I saw. Suprisingly I didn't scream or anything,
but just watched it a little. I couldn't see what it was because of course
it was under my covers SCURRYING towards my body like some kinda of animal.
I felt cold all over and I didn't want to wait to see what it looked like
once its head popped out of the covers right next to mine. So I stood up
and ran for my door. But everytime I tried to open it, it would get slammed
shut but the thing, I couldn't see the arm but I could see the claw or
handprint of some sort it left behind on my door. Everytime I tried to
open the door, the thing would slam it shut, as if it didn't want me to
go. Finally after many attempts, I got the door open and ran out to my
dads room. My dad was still sleeping and so I sat down on teh ground, not
wanting to wake him up. I sat there in the dark waiting for the thing to
come for me but it didn't. So i closed my eyes and rested my head on my
knees. When I opened them again, I was back in my bed, the lights were
fully on, and daylight was streaming through my window.</B><B></B>

a</B>

because</B>
<BR><B>i looked in all the places someone could hide, or something(so i</B>

so i</B>
<BR><B>pushed it back. I told my father and he chuckled and said i was
thinking</B>

<P><B>hey, mi name is Olivia, and I think I've had several encounters if
that is</B>
<BR><B>what you call them.</B>
<BR><B>It all started when I was 11, it was round 7pm, and it was time
to turn on</B>
<BR><B>the lights of the house, I went downstairs to turn on the diningroom
lights,</B>
<BR><B>and as I reached the entrance I got an awfull chill, and saw a white
shadow</B>
<BR><B>rush towards me, I quickly reached for the lightswitch, and bang,
it was</B>
<BR><B>gone. Another time I heard someone opening and then closing the
door to the</B>
<BR><B>segment of the house were I used to live in ( my dad remodeled the
house</B>
<BR><B>recently), I tought it was lady that helps us round the house, but
when i</B>
<BR><B>went to check the hall there was no one there, my parents and sister,
at</B>
<BR><B>time were sound asleep. I do believe that the thing that opened
the door,</B>
<BR><B>stayed there for a while, at night I would hear strange things,
footsteps,</B>
<BR><B>and odd enough, I even heard little paws sounds, since that day,
I slept</B>
<BR><B>with my light on, though, one night I woke up, and the light was
off, I</B>
<BR><B>tought it might have turned it off accidently, so I turned it on
and dozed</B>
<BR><B>off, round 4 am, I woke up to find the light off and next to me
a sort of</B>
<BR><B>black mass floating, I turned on the light, grabbed my pillow and
ran to my</B>
<BR><B>parents room.</B>
<BR><B>That was my last encounter, now, my room is on the other side of
where it</B>
<BR><B>just to be, and I tought it was gone, but one night, as i went upstairs(
the</B>
<BR><B>house is now in an l shape, and there's a huge window, and you can
see to</B>
<BR><B>were my old room was), I clearly felt as if someone was watching
me from the</B>
<BR><B>window, I got all scared and ran to my room. Next morning I had
this dream</B>
<BR><B>of me going into a friends house( to which I've never been, and
when I</B>
<BR><B>described it to her, she got shocked, her house was as I said),
and feeling</B>
<BR><B>as if someone was posseing me, falling into a deep sleep, and I
recalled</B>
<BR><B>screaming over, and over for help, but no one heard me, when I dreamt
this I</B>
<BR><B>was sleeping at anothers friend house, and she had to shake me,
or so she</B>
<BR><B>said to wake me up. When I got home I was all shaken up and cold,
I asked my</B>
<BR><B>sister if the room felt cold, she laughed and said I was crazy,
all I could</B>
<BR><B>think of, was asking my grandma to come back and take away whatever
was</B>
<BR><B>doing that to me. I must have felt asleep right away, and I remember
I was</B>
<BR><B>talking to a friend, I saw my grandma, and all of the sudden the
chair I was</B>
<BR><B>sitting in broke, and I fell, before I reached the ground, I woke
up, and I</B>
<BR><B>felt calm.</B>
<BR><B>Fortunatly my father had the house blessed, and it seems to be gone,
or it</B>
<BR><B>seems.. :)</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi again!!! This time a have short (very short) story, it's about
my cousin and hia friends. Well they were in Margarita Island(Venezuela)
on a highway. So like two miles (remember that the highway is almost never
has curves) ahead there was a crash of 7 cars and since my cousin and his
friends were going on the fast line they could of crashed, IF&nbsp; my
cousin had not seen a shadow of a person passing on the street(oh another
detail it was a foggy night) and he was the only one who saw it. he told
his friends what he saw and told the conductor to "put on the brakes" the
conductor obyed and...if he didnt stop they would have been part of the
crash!!! Everything went fine they think (with all reason) the this was
a protective spirit or a ghost who died there and didnt want anyone to
die the same way...so young nobody is ment to die ate that age...unless
it's your time Bye...</B>

<P><B>Reliance Tipple - Reliance, Wyoming</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Midgetfudpucker@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>The Reliance Tipple is an old mine in Wyoming. My fiance &amp; his
mom had told</B>
<BR><B>me stories about it - well a year later we ended up moving to Wyoming.
My</B>
<BR><B>fiance took me out to see it with no incedent the 1st time - we
didn't see</B>
<BR><B>anything I should say because we never left our vehicle as we had
a newborn</B>
<BR><B>baby and it was to cold.</B>
<BR><B>A couple months later we went back when it was warmer. The baby
was asleep so</B>
<BR><B>my 8 year old son got out to check it out because he hadn't seen
it yet &amp; I</B>
<BR><B>hadn't got to get up close to it - my fiance stayed in the car with
baby.</B>
<BR><B>I was reading the history of it out loud to my son &amp; I heard
a mans cry "Help</B>
<BR><B>Me", I didn't want my son to get scared so I read a little louder,
plus the</B>
<BR><B>wind was blowing real hard &amp; thought maybe it was just my imagination
getting</B>
<BR><B>the best of me. All of a sudden it cried louder "Help Me". My son
daid "Mama,</B>
<BR><B>what was that?" - I said "nothing" - then like the person was right
there -</B>
<BR><B>"Oh God, please help me". We took off running for the car as fast
as we could</B>
<BR><B>go. My fiance seen the fear on our faces and opened the car door
to see what</B>
<BR><B>was the matter. Before he was even out of the car asking us his
question we</B>
<BR><B>dove in the front seat of the car on top of him.</B>
<BR><B>Once he got us calmed down, he told me that there was two little
boys on the</B>
<BR><B>other side of the tipple. I was mad as hell &amp; got out of the
car to confront</B>
<BR><B>them but when we got there they were both crying &amp; crouched
down behind the</B>
<BR><B>pillars. They were only 5 &amp; 6 years old. When we asked them
if they were</B>
<BR><B>alright, they replied by telling us that a loud voice screaming
for help</B>
<BR><B>scared them &amp; they wanted to go home. I was still a little convinced
that it</B>
<BR><B>was them. Anyhow we walked with them to our car where they felt
safe to get</B>
<BR><B>home on their own. I then started thinking about how their little
voices</B>
<BR><B>could not have screamed that loud &amp; deep, exspecially with how
hard the wind</B>
<BR><B>was blowing. If you've ever watched the movie Blair Witch &amp;
at the end when</B>
<BR><B>The guy was screaming for help - that is exzactly what it sounded
like but</B>
<BR><B>louder.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Mobile Home Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: JstAddPSP@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>Im in Bakersfield, Calif. we bought this mobile home 4 yrs ago through
HUD,</B>
<BR><B>it was abandoned over 1 year and we are the 3rd owners. Things were
quiet for</B>
<BR><B>awhile, till my stepson and his friend started having weird things
happen to</B>
<BR><B>their rooms, clothes would be on the floor that were hanging on
a hook in</B>
<BR><B>closet, dresser drawers would be opened, misc stuff.&nbsp; The friend
moved out</B>
<BR><B>and there are only 4 of us here, my daughter 17&nbsp; and stepson
18,&nbsp; husband &amp; I.</B>
<BR><B>One night last year my stepson Jay came running into our room screaming
at</B>
<BR><B>the top of his lungs DAD DAD the ghost, we went in to find nothing
in his</B>
<BR><B>room, he said after calming down , He was laying in bed trying to
sleep and</B>
<BR><B>he felt like someone was watching him, so he opened his eyes and
a man was</B>
<BR><B>standing in front of his face looking at him up close, it pulled
his blankets</B>
<BR><B>off him and threw them across the room, Jay said he jumped up on
the bed and</B>
<BR><B>screamed and jumped down and ran.&nbsp; When we came in there, I
did notice his</B>
<BR><B>blankets were off the bed and over by his closet before i knew what
had</B>
<BR><B>happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jay is at fear of falling asleep because the
ghost keeps messing</B>
<BR><B>with him , it turns his radio on and off, plays the cd player,&nbsp;
flips the</B>
<BR><B>light switch off anf on, so Jay is petrified to sleep in there unless
he is</B>
<BR><B>soo tired he just passes out.</B>
<BR><B>We told the ghost not to its face but in a talking in general ,
to leave Jay</B>
<BR><B>alone and quit bothering him, if he is gonne be here then he has
to be nice.</B>
<BR><B>Jay still see;s signs of him but not in a bother some way. just
making his</B>
<BR><B>presence known.</B>
<BR><B>My husband has now started to see the ghost while inour bathroom,
it usually</B>
<BR><B>comes from the linnen closet and passes through the mirror,&nbsp;
my husband</B>
<BR><B>leaves the bathroom real fast. a few weeks ago,&nbsp; My husband
went in our room</B>
<BR><B>to take a shower, he closed the door. My daughter was doing dishes
and I was</B>
<BR><B>on the computer in the dinning room, Bri asked me if Hubby had just
caome out</B>
<BR><B>here , I said no, he was in the shower, she said Well someone just
walked</B>
<BR><B>past here . I went in to see and he was just getting out of the
shower and</B>
<BR><B>drying off, i asked him had he come out here , he said No, I said
well the</B>
<BR><B>carpet has wet footprints by the door and Bri saw someone walk by
out here,</B>
<BR><B>So I guess the ghost came through the shower while he was on there.</B>
<BR><B>A few days ago, I was on my computer in the dinnng area, and my
husband was</B>
<BR><B>on his computer in our bedroom, my daughter was in her bathroom,
when my</B>
<BR><B>husband came out to me and asked had I just came in the room, I
said No, and</B>
<BR><B>Bri was in the bathroom, he said Well, someone just put their hand
on my</B>
<BR><B>shoulder and squeezed it a few times. He looked around and no one
was there.</B>
<BR><B>So I guess everyone but me has seen or experienced this ghost but
me. They</B>
<BR><B>say certain people are more susceptible to ghosts&nbsp; than others.&nbsp;
I sure would</B>
<BR><B>like to know who this ghost is, neighbors all say no one has died
here, and</B>
<BR><B>it used t be farm land fruit tress etc..</B><B></B>

<P><B>In Indiana ( I moved from KY ) I moved to a old Mansion about 520
years old. I was 7 at the time. My whole family experenced something.&nbsp;
I have learned that ghosts are real.&nbsp; One of 5 haunted me.&nbsp; It
had red eyes and carried a knife.&nbsp; At night he would turn my nightlight
off.&nbsp; One time I was laying in bed and saw a headlight come across
my walls.&nbsp; The mirror was directly in front of my bed.&nbsp; As the
headlight slowly crept across my walls it stopped in front of my neck.&nbsp;
Through the mirror I saw a reflection of blood on my neck.&nbsp; Then as
quickly as it had come it vanished.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I looked into my baby brothers room I saw
a ghost taking him into the attic.&nbsp; I screamed and the ghost vanished
and floated in midair.&nbsp; My brother was layed back into his crib by
floating almost carried.&nbsp; I ran downstairs to see my mom petrified
by a ghost about 3 ft tall on her bed.&nbsp; My mom was ready to run out
the door, then she saw me crying in the doorway.&nbsp; I said "Where's
Daddy?"he was at a friends house when we paged him.</B>
<BR><B>The next day my dad saw a ghost.&nbsp; The shadow of a ghost, that

in the moving van and from the windshield I saw and heard " I'll get you

<BR><B>Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: JstAddPSP@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, I love to read the stories about ghostly happenings because
I have</B>
<BR><B>never seen one or been a party to one that I am aware of. But people
around</B>
<BR><B>me have. My husband was working in a house my parents owned and
used as a</B>
<BR><B>rental. in Huntington Beach,Ca. This house is a 6 bedroom 2 bath
and shaped</B>
<BR><B>in a backwards 7 shape, the back 3 rooms were added on before we
bought it.</B>
<BR><B>While there alone, he was painting in a back room when a shadow
passed in</B>
<BR><B>front of him, he looked up and around and saw nothing, as he went
back to</B>
<BR><B>work, something lifted his hair up like a hard flip and he turned
around to</B>
<BR><B>see nothing there.&nbsp; He finshed up the painting and went into
the room at the</B>
<BR><B>end of the hallway before the hallway starts to the right. In that
room is a</B>
<BR><B>bathroom, he went to take a shower and heard loud banging on the
wall in</B>
<BR><B>hallway. He thought maybe someone had come to check on him and was
playing</B>
<BR><B>around. so he got out wrapped a towel around him and stuck his head
out in</B>
<BR><B>the hallway ,noone was there, he got back in the shower and it banged
again</B>
<BR><B>on the inside wall of the room at the hallway curve.(this room is
always cold</B>
<BR><B>and weird stuff happens in that room. (another story) anyway, my
husband got</B>
<BR><B>out of the shower and went out in the garage to get dressed and
left. He came</B>
<BR><B>back later to finish painting in another room, an finished about
12:00</B>
<BR><B>midnight, he made a bed down in the living room (the house is empty
mind you)</B>
<BR><B>and looked up to see a smoky figure floating down the hallway coming
his way,</B>
<BR><B>it stopped at the juncyion of the pantry&nbsp; and looked around,
it then floated</B>
<BR><B>into the kitchen looked around in there and went back to the pantry
area and</B>
<BR><B>back down the hallway towards the bedrooms and disappeared. My husband
got up</B>
<BR><B>took his things out to his truck and slept there all night.</B>
<BR><B>As we were growing up in this house in the 70's as the 2nd owners
of the</B>
<BR><B>house, we always heard weird noises that were wrote off to house
creeking?,</B>
<BR><B>mice?, and joked that we had a ghost. My mom and dad had a steel
case desk in</B>
<BR><B>the front bedroom they used as a office area, they kept it locked
so we</B>
<BR><B>couldnt get into things they had in there. one night mom heard the
desk</B>
<BR><B>unlock,(it makes a clunk sound) when unlocking, also the stapler
stapling,</B>
<BR><B>she sat up in bed&nbsp; listening thinking on of us kids found the
key , dad got</B>
<BR><B>up and came in to see who was getting into the desk to find no one
there and</B>
<BR><B>no stapler out and the desk was locked.&nbsp; Dad also had a routine
of locking</B>
<BR><B>the doors as he made his way around the house at night before going
to bed,</B>
<BR><B>Sometimes he would hear the front door unlocking and opening and
closing</B>
<BR><B>again, he'd go check thinking we were trying to sneak out at night,
to find</B>
<BR><B>us all in bed asleep and the door locked. My sister and her husband&nbsp;
rented</B>
<BR><B>the house at 1 time with her boy 1 yr old who slept in a crib in
the room</B>
<BR><B>that is by the hallway that is always cold.&nbsp; She collected
stuffed care bears</B>
<BR><B>for her son and had a shelf&nbsp; on the far wall away from his
crib. She would</B>
<BR><B>hear him in the morning jabbering away like he was talking up a
storm to</B>
<BR><B>someone, when shed go in and look, his care bears were all on the
floor off</B>
<BR><B>the shelf and he was having a ball still in the crib. When I lived
there for</B>
<BR><B>a short time later , my daughter then also about 2 yrs old, slept
in there in</B>
<BR><B>a bed, she would wake up in the middle of the night screaming and
terrified,</B>
<BR><B>when we came in she would latch on to us cry. We asked her what
was wrong and</B>
<BR><B>she would just point in the room and turn her head away. we moved
her out of</B>
<BR><B>that room and her terror nights stopped.&nbsp; One night my son&nbsp;
was about 11, he</B>
<BR><B>was watching tv in the office room that was converted to a guest
room when my</B>
<BR><B>parents came down to visit, and my dad had a small tv and alarm
clock that</B>
<BR><B>flipped the digits when time changed, well he called&nbsp; MOM ,
i came to see</B>
<BR><B>what and the clock numbers were flipping uncontrolably, and the
cable box was</B>
<BR><B>changing channels on its own real fast. I turned everything off
and unplugged</B>
<BR><B>the clock and got him outa there and closed the door.</B>
<BR><B>After we all quit living there and my husband was done working on
the place,</B>
<BR><B>ny sister said she knew 2 guys that wanted to stay at the house
and see what</B>
<BR><B>they could come up with, 1 was a ghost hunter ,1 was a sceptic who
didnt</B>
<BR><B>believe. they brought cameras, video, 35mm, set them up in the kitchen
area</B>
<BR><B>and turned them on, and went into the cold room and started acting
like they</B>
<BR><B>were working in there, they said they felt the coldness and felt
like someone</B>
<BR><B>was watching them as they walked down the long hallway. They heard
a rukus in</B>
<BR><B>the kitchen,When they went to the kitchen where the cameras were,
the 35mm</B>
<BR><B>camera was opened film exposed, the video tape was later viewed
and was like</B>
<BR><B>a snow storm.&nbsp; Well they both felt something was there that
night.</B>
<BR><B>We tried to get the show SIGHTINGS to come out but they couldnt
schedule</B>
<BR><B>before we rented the house back out and have since sold it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<BR><B>Placerville, Calif. (old Hangtown)</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gramaw@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My experience was in 1968 in Placerville, CA. I was renting an old&nbsp;
house on a hill and my son, Jeff was 5, my daughter Ashley was 3. There
were some steep stairs that led to a large open room on the left that held
a pool table that the children loved to play with. At the top of the stairs
to the right was a door that I kept closed and padlocked as the only thing
in there was a old and very rusted metal half bed. After living there for
about 4 months, one night after dinner, I was sweeping the floor at the
bottom of the stairs and called out to the children to come down and get
ready for bed. There was silence for a moment and then they started screaming
shrilly and running to the stairs and down. Jeff was behind Angie and her
little legs just could not move fast enough and Jeff literaly ran over
the top of her. They were both screaming and crying uncontrollably. I was
really angry at Jeff for knocking Angie down and was trying to be heard
over their screams. They kept saying "monster man, monster man" while pointing
up the stairs. I said nonsense. (There was no posible way anyone could
of gotten upstairs due to the way the house was built.) Jeff had a plastic
rifle which stood in the corner so I grabbed it and pointed it up the stairs
and yelled, "O.K. monster man, you'd better come down cause I have a gun
and I am going to shoot you dead!" Obviously I was playing with the children,
but my playing became fear when I suddenly heard the sound of running boots
that were worn by a man large enough that the floor vibrated. I HEARD but
DID NOT SEE the man run in front of me at the top of the stairs and into
the other room. BUT THE DOOR DID NOT OPEN TO LET HIM THROUGH. It scared
the dickens oout of me and I slammed the door to the stairs and pulled
the dining room table in front of the door and even piled the chairs oon
top of the table. I then called the police. He drew his gun and slowly
crept up the stairs and when he reached the closed door, the policeman
looked down at me and wispered, "did you lock the door after he ran in?"
"No, I said, he ran THROUGH the door. He, the policeman, became very angry
with me and gave me a lecture on making a false report.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning after Jeff had left for school, Angie and I sat
up in my bed which was directly below the empty bedroom with the rusted
bed. I read her one of her favorite stories and all was quiet and peaceful
when suddenly the sound of the bed above could be heard being slowly pulled
away from the wall. Angie and I sat quietly and stared at the ceiling.
I remember I was not afraid but felt a deep sadness when the sound of the
bed being thrown forcefully into the wall was heard. Then silence. Still
I felt no fear. For some reason, I wanted to apologize. Crazy, huh. Later
that day I went upstairs and unlocked the door and opened it slowly. there
was an inch of dust on the floor and cobwebs going from the bed to the
wall. The room was completly untouched by anything human.</B>
<BR><B>We moved about 6 months later but I never heard from the spirit
again. I would talk to him all the time though as if he was there. If he
heard or not, I never knew.</B>
<BR><B>My kids described him as being a very tall man with a big beard
and lots of hair. They said he was wearing a old red shirt with suspenders
and that he had them so tight that it pulled up his pants so that half
his big boots showed.</B>
<BR><B>I have always wondered if anyone else ever lived in that old house
and if he made an attempt to contact the tenants.</B><B></B>

<P><B>i was 19 and my girlfriend was 17 and her parents wasn't big on the

<BR><B>thing.&nbsp; so like any normal kids, we would go found places to
park.&nbsp; we were</B>
<BR><B>at this one place, that we been there a couple times before.&nbsp;
it's called fox</B>
<BR><B>lake dame, in southeastern Ohio.&nbsp; there is a park lot with
trees all around,</B>
<BR><B>it's back in the middle of the heck's anyway.&nbsp; no cars was
there or people</B>
<BR><B>were around, it was middle winter and pretty freaking cold.&nbsp;&nbsp;
we sitting</B>
<BR><B>there talking or whatever and then my car started moving to left,
like</B>
<BR><B>something run into it.&nbsp; i look at my g/f and i was like what
the hell was</B>
<BR><B>that and then it felt like something hit my car on the right side.&nbsp;
i was</B>
<BR><B>like shit, let's roll,&nbsp; about the time i said that, my back
end started to</B>
<BR><B>come off the ground.&nbsp; i started my car and done 360 with my
lights on and the</B>
<BR><B>wood line was about 300 feet away.&nbsp; it took me about 5 seconds
if not less to</B>
<BR><B>do a whole 360 to see anything. her and me didn't see anything.
i took her</B>
<BR><B>home and we didn't even knew what to say to each other.&nbsp; i
was just as scare</B>
<BR><B>as her, I think.&nbsp; The next morning, I got to my car and look
it all over and</B>
<BR><B>did found anything.&nbsp; So that's my story, probably not the scariest,

<P><B>i know what you mean about providing the energy. i hate to think
about it, because even that may be a source of energy. i have had strange
experiences as a child, i did not stop being afraid of the dark until i
was 21 years of age. i have also had a possitive energy experience, during
the baptism of my God daughter. it was near the end of the baptism, when
we all held onto the candle, while the roman catholic priest was finishing
the last passage. i felt&nbsp; a warmth trickle up my arm as we all stood

<BR><B>our screams,they did not sound human either!) so we used my watch
light to</B>
<BR><B>run as fast as we could ou of the house.I never did go back into
the house</B>
<BR><B>until daylight.Then we found my cats huddled in my room full of
fright. My</B>
<BR><B>computer had a strange e-mail saying "get out of the house while
you can! u</B>
<BR><B>have 13 days before somethig BAD happens!!" We moved to a new house
and have</B>
<BR><B>had no trouble since.</B>

<P><B>It was around 10 pm, Nov 25 2001. Me and my</B>
<BR><B>friend,Travis went for a car ride to Dalton, Nh. He</B>
<BR><B>wanted to show me a house that one of his relatives</B>
<BR><B>used to live in. We went on a long dark road and then</B>
<BR><B>found the place, it was huge. we pulled into the</B>
<BR><B>driveway and stared at it. I was attracted to the</B>
<BR><B>upstairs windows, i stared at them for a while and</B>
<BR><B>then got chilly. i told him it was a cool house but</B>
<BR><B>creepy. he told me he liked it and wished he could buy</B>
<BR><B>it. we sat a while longer then i said "can we go" and</B>
<BR><B>we left, turned around and looked at it from a</B>
<BR><B>different angle. while staring, i saw a small ball of</B>
<BR><B>light appear in the window and dissapear, i looked</B>
<BR><B>behind us thinking it was a head light but it was dark</B>
<BR><B>back there. travis drove back to the house to turn</B>
<BR><B>around and i got really scared and hunked down in the</B>
<BR><B>seat til we were back on the road. we got to the end</B>
<BR><B>of the road and stopped at the stop sign and i saw a</B>
<BR><B>ball of light about the size of an orange swoop out of</B>
<BR><B>the sky and then swoop back up at the trees. I asked</B>
<BR><B>Travis if he saw it and he said yeah, i jokingly said,</B>
<BR><B>"it looked like an orb" Travis was like , "just a</B>
<BR><B>falling star." i leaned forward and looked up but i</B>
<BR><B>didnt see any stars, seeing as the sky was pitch black</B>
<BR><B>and it was raining hard. I shrugged it off and we</B>
<BR><B>drove onto a new road, Travis turned onto a different</B>
<BR><B>road and we were driving and I kept feeling like</B>
<BR><B>someone was breathing cold air down my neck and my</B>
<BR><B>chest and arms tightened and I felt like I had a ball</B>
<BR><B>in my throat. I didnt say anything to Travis because I</B>
<BR><B>didnt want to look like a freak so I just handled it</B>
<BR><B>alone, then Travis said "Oh my God, i feel funny." I</B>
<BR><B>was like "oh yeah?" and he told me he had a tight</B>
<BR><B>throat and chest and his arms felt funny and he was</B>
<BR><B>cold on his neck, I was like "you're kidding." he</B>
<BR><B>asked why and I told him I felt the same way, that</B>
<BR><B>freaked us out a bit and we were driving and the</B>
<BR><B>pressure went away, I was like "it's gone" and he was</B>
<BR><B>like "yeah it is, back there it left me on that hill."</B>
<BR><B>and that was exactly to a T where it had left me. I</B>
<BR><B>got really scared and asked him if he thought it was</B>
<BR><B>weird and he said yeah, it happened to us all through</B>
<BR><B>that road, we would both feel it and then it would go</B>
<BR><B>away at the same time, he also felt like he was being</B>
<BR><B>watched and we both kept staring back at the back</B>
<BR><B>seat.We turned the radio on really loud but the</B>
<BR><B>feeling was stronger like it WANTED to be heard and</B>
<BR><B>felt and we couldnt make it go away by sound. It felt</B>
<BR><B>like we could not escape, like it was with us and we</B>
<BR><B>were not going to get away. I commented that it felt</B>
<BR><B>like there was deep water nearby and it scared me, and</B>
<BR><B>he was like "yeah, like standing by a pond and looking</B>
<BR><B>down and it is really deep." so we were both getting</B>
<BR><B>shown the same images and messages in our minds,</B>
<BR><B>whatever was communicating with us was just so</B>
<BR><B>negative. I kept feeling like I needed to pray or</B>
<BR><B>somthing but i couldnt think of anything to pray, all</B>
<BR><B>i could think was 'Jesus'. The feeling was so harmful</B>
<BR><B>and negative it felt like it wanted to hurt us.Travis</B>
<BR><B>said it made him feel like there was going to be</B>
<BR><B>somthing bad around every corner to make us crash and</B>
<BR><B>I was feeling the same, only I kept feeling like we</B>
<BR><B>were gonna turn a corner and hit a moose or some big</B>
<BR><B>animal. I told him to get the hell off that road so he</B>
<BR><B>sped up. He said he has been on that road almost every</B>
<BR><B>day and never felt that way, so we tried to figure out</B>
<BR><B>where it all started and I was like "well i didnt want</B>
<BR><B>to say anything to you because you liked the house,</B>
<BR><B>but I felt funny after we saw that house and stared at</B>
<BR><B>it." and travis nodded and said thats where he felt it</B>
<BR><B>too. We finally got off that road and as soon as we</B>
<BR><B>hit the road towards our homes a bright orange light</B>
<BR><B>lit up behind us, I was like "oh my god what was</B>
<BR><B>that?!" and he was like "i dont know!" i felt like it</B>
<BR><B>was a warning or somthing like, "if you come back you</B>
<BR><B>will&nbsp; be sorry, goodbye." Thats just how i felt.</B>
<BR><B>We were fine all the way to town then we started</B>
<BR><B>talking about it and the feeling came back. I told</B>
<BR><B>travis I wanted to go home, so he took me back to my</B>
<BR><B>house and came inside, he was shaking he was so</B>
<BR><B>scared. It was so freaky cuz we didnt like go ghost</B>
<BR><B>hunting or anything we werent even discussing ghosts,</B>
<BR><B>we just mentioned the house looked creepy and looked</B>
<BR><B>haunted. Once I got home I felt fine and the feeling</B>
<BR><B>went away, Travis said he was gonna go home, i told</B>
<BR><B>him to be careful and everything and he left, I layed</B>
<BR><B>on the couch and then started feeling scared, The</B>
<BR><B>phone rang and it was Travis and he screeched, "Sarah?</B>
<BR><B>You arent gonna believe what I just saw." I was like</B>
<BR><B>"What?" and he told me he saw like a orange bird thing</B>
<BR><B>that floated past the hood of his car and by his door</B>
<BR><B>and then dissapeared when he turned to look, I told</B>
<BR><B>him it was in the back seat with him as a joke and he</B>
<BR><B>got really scared. He said it was so strong and he</B>
<BR><B>couldnt escape the thing. I told him to not go home</B>
<BR><B>and just drive to town and find lights and people and</B>
<BR><B>sleep in his car where he feels safe. Its like it</B>
<BR><B>followed Travis cuz he said he wanted the house or</B>
<BR><B>somthing, It was freaky, after he hung up i laid on</B>
<BR><B>the couch and stared out the living room window and</B>
<BR><B>watched the sky, it had cleared up and one single star</B>
<BR><B>was shining so i was staring at it and just thinking</B>
<BR><B>and then i couldnt see the star anymore, the window</B>
<BR><B>was pitch black, i was looking for the star and</B>
<BR><B>couldnt see it at all and i got a creepy feeling. i</B>
<BR><B>blinked my eyes and then still didnt see the star so i</B>
<BR><B>shut my eyes tight and when i opened them the star was</B>
<BR><B>there twinkling away. I didnt like feeling so</B>
<BR><B>vulnerable so I crawled to my mom's room and laid on</B>
<BR><B>the floor next to her bed and just stared at the room</B>
<BR><B>waiting for morning to come.</B>
<BR><B>I never want to go back to that road again, it was</B>
<BR><B>such a strong, harmful, negative presence and it did</B>
<BR><B>NOT want us near that house. I am 20 years old and</B>
<BR><B>have a few other run ins with energys and spirits but</B>
<BR><B>nothing as bad as that. I felt like it meant harm to</B>
<BR><B>us.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Mysterious Voices</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: killer_kava@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I was 3 years old, living in a house in NZ. The house had 5 people
die in it in the past including my big brother who was 3 when he died and
all in the same room which was at that time my bedroom. For many nights
during that year I would hear a menacing voicewhich would scream out to
me to "Get Out Of My Room!!" which was odd because there would be no one
there. After this being only three years old I would run into my mums room
crying.When I turned 4 they seem to stop and I have never heard from the
ghost. I dont think it was my Big Bro because he was not that kinda person
and I never met him and there were more children who died in the room.</B>
<BR><B>The Old Man</B>
<BR><B>My sisters were in the same room of the previous story when they
suddenly saw a tall, thin man who was pure black apart from his eyes which
were pure white in the window. There was an old man who died of a heart
attack in that room. He was a mushroom farmer. My sisters all frightend
ran into the kitchen but the apparition was there in the kitchen window.
They ran back to the room but the apparition was there not puffing frim
the run because he diddint run and no one could make that didtance in the
time my sisters did from out outside. My sisters called my mum at work
and then called the police. the police sent dogs to try and sniff out the
intruder but the couldint pick up a sent of anything being there.</B>
<BR><B>many years later he made another apperance. My big sister and the
youngest of the three from the previous story was living with her boyfriend
at out house. after her boyfriend was totaly wasted on whatever thy had
been smokin/snortin/injecting etc, he saw the old man with another like
him only short and stocky but the same pure blackness and pure white eyes.he
totaly freaked. People say it was the druge but i dont think so because
of the closeness of the apparitions from the two apperences.</B>
<BR><B>...Well I hope you like thes storys. Since theses things happend
there has been a death surrounding the house. A man who owned the house
after us died of a heart attack in Christchurch, NZ. Now the owner of the
house is the mother of my big sisters (the one from the story of the old
man) sons half sister (man what a mouthfull). i just wish for another audience
from the ghost (call me an idiot) that haunted me as a 3 year old just
so i could tell it where to do but i guess i will never have the chance.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;At my house I believe that there are three ghosts among us.
First there is</B>
<BR><B>Jonny, He is a little 5 year old boy. I used to come home and hear
a voice I</B>
<BR><B>knew no one was home so I ignored it. It said it again " Want to
play??",</B>
<BR><B>again I ignored it, the last time I was on the phone and I saw a
little boy</B>
<BR><B>holding a ball. I called my mom and she came to get me. Once I was
home alone</B>
<BR><B>and the door bell rang and I answered it ,no one was there a couple
minutes</B>
<BR><B>later the dorr bell rang again this time when I answered it there
was a boy</B>
<BR><B>about 13 that I could see through standing there laughing. Lastly
there is</B>
<BR><B>Kelly, when ever we are all sitting aat the table at dinner and
being quite</B>
<BR><B>she slams down the tolet seat. thoses are three ghosts.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Problems</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: stompthedevil24_7@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>At the time being I am 17 years old and have lived in the same house
my</B>
<BR><B>whole life.&nbsp; It has just been in the last 4 years or so that
I have been</B>
<BR><B>having some...problems so to speak.</B>
<BR><B>Before I go any farther into my story I want to say this: I am a
very strong</B>
<BR><B>Christian and in my faith there are no ghosts, only demons, which
makes this</B>
<BR><B>all the more terrifying to me.&nbsp; I don't believe in 'good' ghosts
because in</B>
<BR><B>my opinion, anything that talks to you from 'the other side' is
not 'good'.</B>
<BR><B>But I digress...</B>
<BR><B>Well, at the beginning the 'problems' started out as just feeling
uneasy in</B>
<BR><B>certain rooms of my house.&nbsp; The office is one of those rooms.&nbsp;
I hate to be</B>
<BR><B>in the office by myself (which is where I am at right now, but my
boyfriend</B>
<BR><B>is on the other computer), especially at night.&nbsp; As soon as
I step foot into</B>
<BR><B>it, I feel like I'm being watched.&nbsp; Most of the time when I
get whatever I</B>
<BR><B>am coming for in this room, I run out, which may give you some sense
of how</B>
<BR><B>uneasy I feel in the room.&nbsp; I was able to handle that, but
it started to get</B>
<BR><B>worse.&nbsp; One night I was on the internet chatting with some
of my online</B>
<BR><B>friends.&nbsp; It was late, and I was in the office by myself.&nbsp;
I was so into my</B>
<BR><B>conversation that I had forgotten the unease that I had felt earlier.</B>
<BR><B>Unfortunately it didn't last long (to help understand this part
I must</B>
<BR><B>explain the layout of the floor in the office.&nbsp; It's a wooden
floor with</B>
<BR><B>about 1 1/2 feet of empty space underneath it, followed by the concrete</B>
<BR><B>foundation.&nbsp; This room was originally a garage but was re-modeled
before my</B>
<BR><B>family moved in).&nbsp; I had my back facing the rest of the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;
From behind</B>
<BR><B>me came the sound of a frantic scratching against wood.&nbsp; I
spun around and</B>
<BR><B>no one was behind me.&nbsp; Seconds later the sound came again,
only louder and</B>
<BR><B>more frantic.&nbsp; I left the office without shutting off the computer
or the</B>
<BR><B>light and ran to my room.&nbsp; I later decided that there was no
way it could</B>
<BR><B>have been a rat or anything like that, as it was too loud to have
come from</B>
<BR><B>any kind of rodent.</B>
<BR><B>About a year passed without any more major occurances.</B>
<BR><B>I 'adopted' 2 kittens that were born in our backyard.&nbsp; They
are both black</B>
<BR><B>with bright yellow eyes and my parents joke that they have posessed
the</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; I think they have helped us more than hurt us.</B>
<BR><B>Just recently my boyfriend moved in with us, and we are both very
close to</B>
<BR><B>the kittens.&nbsp; The female, named Bonnie, always sits next to
us.&nbsp; One night</B>
<BR><B>we were on the couch talking, with Bonnie sitting between us.&nbsp;
During a</B>
<BR><B>quiet moment I looked down and noticed that Bonnie was staring into
the</B>
<BR><B>dining room.&nbsp; I assumed she was looking at our older cat, Katie
(who she</B>
<BR><B>didn't get along with very well), but when I followed her gaze,
I could see</B>
<BR><B>nothing out of the ordinary.&nbsp; A few seconds later she hissed,
followed</B>
<BR><B>immediately by a deep throated growl.&nbsp; I had never heard her
do either of</B>
<BR><B>these things before, so of course it scared me.&nbsp; I picked her
up but she</B>
<BR><B>kept her eyes on the dining room.&nbsp; After a few minutes she
turned to me and</B>
<BR><B>started purring.</B>
<BR><B>About a week after that Bonnie's brother, Clyde (haha) was sitting
with me</B>
<BR><B>in the family room.&nbsp; I was playing with him with his favorite
toy, a feather</B>
<BR><B>sparkly thing attached to a stick.&nbsp; Usually, when playing with
it, nothing</B>
<BR><B>can distract him.&nbsp; This night, however, he stopped what he
was doing with</B>
<BR><B>the toy and looked towards the dining room.&nbsp; I called his name
and snapped a</B>
<BR><B>few times, which perked his ears up, but he kept his eyes focused
on the</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; I figured that his toy would bring him back around,
so I waved it in</B>
<BR><B>front of his face.&nbsp; Usually, doing this would cause him to
go into a frenzy</B>
<BR><B>of backflips in an attempt to catch it, but not this time.&nbsp;
This time he</B>
<BR><B>ducked his head around it to keep watch on the dining room.&nbsp;
A few minutes</B>
<BR><B>later he growled deeply, which was very unusual for him to do at
the time.</B>
<BR><B>I sat and watched with him for a few more seconds.&nbsp; He then
turned back</B>
<BR><B>towards his toy and began to play with it again.&nbsp; I'd like
to think that</B>
<BR><B>Bonnie and Clyde are helping to keep the demons, or ghosts if you
will, at</B>
<BR><B>bay in our house.</B>
<BR><B>Aside from that, my boyfriend and I have also heard noises in all
of the</B>
<BR><B>rooms of the house.&nbsp; When my parents aren't home we hear things
like papers</B>
<BR><B>falling or drawers being closed in their room, and in the office
we always</B>
<BR><B>hear what sounds like kittens rummaging around, but when we look
up, all 3</B>
<BR><B>of the cats are always sleeping when it happens.&nbsp; I also have
had some</B>
<BR><B>nightmares that I attribute to whatever lurks in our house.&nbsp;
one night I</B>
<BR><B>awoke to the feeling that someone was leaning against the foot of
my bed.</B>
<BR><B>When I looked towards it I saw a man, with a strange smile on his
face,</B>
<BR><B>leaning with one hand on my bed, and coming towards me.&nbsp; When
I sat straight</B>
<BR><B>up, he disappeared.&nbsp; Another one I had was equally disturbing,
but twice as</B>
<BR><B>strange.&nbsp; In it I could see myself sleeping, as well as three
women, one old</B>
<BR><B>and two younger, standing near my door.&nbsp; The older woman said
"what are we</B>
<BR><B>going to do about her?" to which one of the younger women replied
"take care</B>
<BR><B>of it".&nbsp; It was then that I (in the dream) began to toss and
turn.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>older woman picked up on the movement and turned to the other younger
woman</B>
<BR><B>and said "She's about to wake up.&nbsp; We'll leave and you stay
here and get rid</B>
<BR><B>of her."&nbsp; The woman she was talking to ducked behind my TV
and the other two</B>
<BR><B>left just as I woke up.&nbsp; I was too scared to move but eventually,
armed with</B>
<BR><B>a switch blade, rushed to turn the light on.&nbsp; Of course, no
one was there.</B>
<BR><B>Other than that I have also woken up to the feeling of what can
be described</B>
<BR><B>as a cat jumping up on the bed next to me.&nbsp; But when I reach
out to pet it</B>
<BR><B>(assuming it is one of my cats) there is nothing there, and yet
the weight</B>
<BR><B>remains.</B>
<BR><B>I find all of this incredibly disturbing, especially since it has
started</B>
<BR><B>happening in my room, which used to be the only place I felt safe
in this</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; Luckily I am 17, and in less than 6 months I will be
18 and already</B>
<BR><B>have the money and an apartment set up to move into.&nbsp; If I
had to live here</B>
<BR><B>any longer than that I think I would go insane.</B>
