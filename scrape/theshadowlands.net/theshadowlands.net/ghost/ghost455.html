<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Parent's House</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I&#8217;m a big fan of you&#8217;re website, I love ghost stories
although I&#8217;m not really sure I believe in ghosts. I do however believe things
happen that we can not explain. As such in my parent&#8217;s house. It is a old house
but cute 3 bedroom 1 bath I know right one bathroom.. any way, we moved into it
when I was in the fifth grade and sometimes I would get goose bumps, the hairs
on the back of my neck would stand up and I would look around as if I were
being watched never did see any one but this happened about twice a week. I
would tell my parents and they&#8217;d be like you watch to much TV or it&#8217;s just you&#8217;re
imagination playing tricks on you. Mine and my sister&#8217;s chore was the dinner
dishes clean up after supper every night, sometimes we would have to do them
alone on one such occasion while doing the dishes the above happened but nobody
would be there just the feeling of being looked at would come right out of the
blue. Sometimes I would feel the air like someone had walked behind me my gown
tail would sway as if to be in some wind but there would be no wind and it
would stop right after it started this has went on for years but we never saw
any one it was only a feeling. Then one night I woke up out of a deep sleep
just sat right up in bed and in the darkness barley lit by the bathroom light
on I could see the silhouette of a man in the kitchen right out side my bedroom
door I was so scared I could not move I couldn&#8217;t even breathe I was so scared I
guess you could call it sheer fright. After I focused on him and realized what
it was he was gone and never saw him again. My parents still live there and
still not believeing this happened. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>After getting married and moving out, I have a brother 31
and a sister 33 who still live there with our parents, my brother had a job
with a company who makes power tools where he drove the delivery truck and
every day he would come home for lunch. On this particular day our dad was in
the shower with the bathroom door open and the doors to the house locked (he
was home alone) our dad is a disable veteran and in 1982 the rolls swapped mom
went to work and dad became Mr. MOM and he&#8217;s the best.. any way back to the
story, he heard my brother unlock the front door, the storm door slam shut and
walk through the living room thru the dinning room and into the kitchen so
daddy hollered from the bathroom &#8220;I&#8217;ll be out in a minute son&#8221;. Well when daddy
got out of the shower to no avail our brother was no where to be seen. The
house was just like daddy left it before he got into the shower.. he called my
brother on his cell phone and asked him why he left, my brother informed him he
had never been home that morning he was no where near the house at that time he
was delivering parts in another city 2 hours away. Now this is my dad who does
not for one minute believe in ghosts but he will not discuss what happened on
this day any more. He never talks about it when it&#8217;s brought up he either
leaves the room or changes the subject. To this very day things come up
missing, move by themselves, TV&#8217;s go off an on, lights flicker on and off, but
daddy says this is due to old electrical wiring of the house and old houses
make sounds. Even our cats and dogs used to do weird things like they were
looking at something that wasn&#8217;t there, my chow would always growl and show her
teeth when she would come inside. Mom&#8217;s cat would hiss and screech and then run
outside but our daddy was like aahhh it&#8217;s crazy and say you know how cat&#8217;s
are.. whatever they don&#8217;t act like that unless they have a reason or being
scared of something.. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>We never could see any thing though only the one time I saw
the outline of a man in the kitchen that was it. People say cat&#8217;s and dog&#8217;s can
see things us human&#8217;s can&#8217;t so maybe there is something there they know it. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>That&#8217;s my ghost story thanks for letting me share it with
you, I hope I&#8217;m not crazy.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I think your web site is totally amazing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was recently looking at your Michigan
hauntings page and came across my old school, Michigan Career and technical
Institute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I attended the school from
Jan 1995 to March, 1996.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have
experienced what you described as shadow figures and, actual physical contact
with one of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t remember the
actual room I stayed in but it was my dorm room the entire time except for the
last 6 weeks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How it happened was myself
and my roommate were lying in bed and just starting to get that in and out of
sleep feeling when out of the blue I felt something grab a hold of my hand and
at first I really didn&#8217;t know what was going on my eyes were closed and as I opened
them I saw a shadow like hand holding mine I jumped up and as I did my roommate
told me he opened his eyes and saw a full human shaped shadow figure in our
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It all happened so quick I flew
out of bed and hit the light to see my roommate hiding under his covers and we
both at the same time said what the hell was that. And the next morning at
breakfast the people below our room were really pissed because they said that
somebody was bouncing a golf ball in our room all night long and yes I had my clubs
with me but after the shadow figure we both went to sleep and woke up in the
morning with the sense that something was watching us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dam it was weird.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this day I have always wondered about he
Dormitory at the school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I always
wondered if somebody had been killed there or something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any way great site and if you ever go there
to investigate I would love to tag along.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Hi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I travel a
parkway back and forth to work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
stretch between my town and the next town is very peculiar to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes I believe the stretch is
haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You see, one morning , I was
getting readty to leave for work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I
got in my car, I had a very uneasy feeling.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was to the point as to where I tried to call my husband to tell him I
thought something was in the car with me, but I could not get ahold of
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried to shake the feeling off
and went on to work anyways, hesitating to even look in the rearview mirror.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 10 miles from my town I was behind a
truck in which a box fell off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to
get over in the other lane to dodge it, and must have hit a slick spot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wrecked my car, thank goodness I wasn't
hurt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cop at the scene said I was
lucky I didn't flip it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also said
that if I had slid another 4 inches, i would have went into the other lane and
possibly been hit by an oncoming vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After I wrecked, the uneasy feeling I had left.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>A couple months later in the same place I had a
blowout.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Don't know for sure why, but it
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If that didn't beat all, I had
another blowout a week later on the same side of the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same place, but on the opposite side
of the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now I get an uneasy feeling
when I go thru there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coincidence&gt;?
Or perhaps the road is haunted.....</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>About a year ago, my girlfriend and I were shopping in this
store in an old house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden,
there was a loud crash in a locked wood and glass curio cabinet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sounded like lots of glass objects
shattering.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Neither of us was within an arms length of the cabinet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My girlfriend said that she saw something
from the corner of her eye move to the edge of the middle shelf and fall to the
bottom of the cabinet.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>When the owner came and unlocked the cabinet, we couldn't
find anything that was broken or that had fallen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We asked if the store was haunted; she said
that she didn't know, but she had some issues with the front door opening and
closing seemingly by itself.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The House Behind Lum's Restaurant</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>A woman I work with told me a ghost story months ago that I
just can't stop thinking about. If it's true, and I'm convinced that it is,
then she was a participant in one of the most fascinating paranormal stories of
all time. By my friend's estimate, the year was 1972 or 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was in her twenties and unmarried at the
time. She had started hanging out with these four guys who shared a rented
house that stood at the corner of Wilson and Sulphur (I think) near Highway 44
here in St. Louis. Now at this point I have to issue a disclaimer of sorts-
that my friend (whom I'll call "Joan") has ever told a lie. She seems
very straight forward and honest and simply not prone to exagerration of any
sort. Anyway...she remembers her first time at the house and how something went
whizzing by her. When she mentioned it to her host he told that she hasn't seen
anything yet! Some time later, she was at a table in the house (in the kitchen
or living room I think) and an ashtray lifted off the table as if moved by some
unseen hand, and started circling her. For a second she could not believe her
eyes. Before long, she was seeing something levitate every time she went to the
house! EVERY TIME! Once it was a lit cigarette that was lifted which put
everyone in a panic because they were afraid that when it landed a fire could
start. The consciencious ghost thoughtfully put the cig in the glass of the man
who had been smoking, which prompted the smoker to ask aloud if
"they" didn't like him smoking! In fact, Joan and a friend spent the
night there once and claimed to have gotten no sleep whatever- there was so
much to watch in the house; things moving,things levitating, or both- that
there was just too much to watch! Once she was talking to one of the guys who
lived there about the haunting and he told her that's nothing; that she she
come by late one night close to midnight. Well, it came to pass that they were
playing cards one night when Joan heard<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>something that sounded like crying. She got up and walked around to
where the stairs to the second floor were, looked up, and saw a little girl!
She was in pajamas and pig-tails and holding a doll or teddy bear. And she was
crying. Joan said that when she focused her eyes she could tell that the girl
was slightly transluscent. The girl then opened her mouth in what appeared to
be a scream and silently and gradually (yet quickly) dissappeared.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Eventually Joan asked the guys what they knew about the house's history
and it turns out that they were renting the house from an older man (say in his
50's) that was the nephew (?) ofa couple who had been murdered in the house
roughly twenty years </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>earlier. It seems that one of the couple were woken up in
the night and went downstairs. It was there that they were confronted by an
intruder. A struggle ensued. The other spouse came to their aid but both wound
up being killed. It was immediately after the killings </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>that the intruder saw the little girl at the top of the
stairs. She was, no doubt, sobbing and hysterical and he killed her too. Since
Joan has told me this story (last September I think) </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I've been trying to reasearch it a little and have had no
luck. I have tried to recreate the story in the same order it was told me,
detail for detail. There are few details I can add. Joan said that there was
faculty from St. Louis University studying the house for </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>some time back in the 70's. The investigation did tape
record the reaction of people who had never been in the house before (these
people did see these amazing feats). Unfortunately she does not know if any
video footage exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also said
these four guys seemed to enjoy bringing girls to the house for the sole
purpose of exposing them to these scary happenings! Whenever these girls would
cry and claim to have seen something these guys would sometimes say that they
had seen nothing! The thing that gets me about this story is how nonchalant
everyone involved seems to have been during these occurances. I can't believe
anyone would take such a spectacular haunting for granted. And it makes me
wonder just how many other stories are out there, just as spectacular maybe,
and just as unknown because the people involved are just taking it for granted.
Another detail I must add is this; this house, sadly no longer stands. I'm not
sure when it was raized, but it could have been standing as recently as 2005.
Back in the 70's it stood in the back of Lum's Restaurant. Today, the house and
restaurant are both gone, and a new hotel (A Drury Inn) has been built there
which I believe is now open. She has long since lost contact with the four guys
(which she met while working at a bar called Sub-Station 8). Hopefully posting
this story will help preserve it and bring more details to light.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The story I'm going to share with you happened in the year
of 1996, my then husband and I with our daughters were renting a house in the
south valley, upon going into the house I got a feeling we were not alone. It
wasn&#8217;t a scary feeling, but I just knew something/someone else was there&#8230;I
especially felt this feeling in the back bedroom across from the master
bedroom, and no matter what, that room was ALWAYS cold. We ending up turning
this room into my daughters play room, which mind you they hardly ever played
in since it was so cold. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I had just had my second daughter she was only 3-4 months
old and this is what happened&#8230; </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I had went to sleep that night and I was feeling exhausted
so I put her in her bassinet next to the bed, she was still hungry so I propped
her bottle (yeah I know, your not supposed to do that, but I made sure there
was a blanket under her face so milk didn&#8217;t drip into her ear). And then I feel
asleep, upon waking up in and out of sleep, that we mothers do, I seen her
bassinet swaying back and forth as if someone was rocking it, not forcefully,
but as if someone was just gently rocking her. So I literally sat up to see if
I was seeing things and it stopped. I then got out of my bed and went into the
bathroom which was right next to bed to see if maybe my oldest daughter was
there but nothing&#8230;.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Time had passed and my youngest daughter was about 5-6
months and I had laid her in her crib in my oldest daughters room to sleep,
they shared the room since the 3rd bedroom was too cold to put anyone in there.
And I had fallen asleep, and around 3 in the morning, it felt like some one
shook me and whispered in my ear get up! go check! Even saying this, I get the
chills, because it scared me half to death, I was even so scared I couldn&#8217;t
move, you know when you want to scream, move, but you are so scared you cant do
either. So I was laying there, than I heard loud "get up now"!! So I
jumped out of bed and instinctively ran to my daughters room to check on them
and there was my little one laying in her crib, she had spit up and it was
blocking her air way, so I immediately picked her up and cleared it all and she
began crying&#8230;All I can say is thank God someone was there with me to wake me up
and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to tell me... move it lady!
Otherwise I don&#8217;t know what would have happened?....</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>All I know is there is someone watching over all of us! And
I thank my lucky stars he/she was there that day to wake me up and tell me to
check on my babies!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: sabinemacdonald@shaw.ca </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Well, my story happened in 1985 when I was 15 years old.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I lived with my parents and sisters in a small town in
Germany. We had<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a large house and a
workshop with living space on the second floor. My bedroom, my parents bedroom,
a bathroom and a large storage area where part of the living quarters above the
workshop.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My bedroom was right next to the unfinished attic room. We
kept old furniture, toys and all kinds of junk in that room. As kids we used to
play there during the day but at night the attic room became spooky and I
always kept the door to my bedroom locked.</big></big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>It happened one Sunday morning in November. My usual
Monday-Friday routine was getting up around 6am, feeding my horse and cleaning
his stall, getting breakfast and catching the school bus. On Sundays I could
sleep in but was often awake around 6am because it was my usual time.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>This particular Sunday I also awoke around 6am. I squinted
at my alarm clock and heard the church bell ring in the Sunday morning. I
thought I had been awakened by a noise and I stiffened when I heard a loud and
clear knock-knock on my bedroom door. This was the door that led to the attic
room. I was immediately terrified because there simply could not be ANYONE in
that storage room. You could only get into the room by walking through my
bedroom and I sure as heck hoped nobody had entered my bedroom at night. My
parents bedroom was beside my room on the other side. There were no other doors
leading to this attic room.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I listened - terrified- to more knocking. It sounded exactly
like a person knocking to be let into a room. It was loud and clear, fast and
impatient knocks. My mind raced with possibilities: burglars, someone who had a
very long ladder and climbed into a window, murderes, ghosts???</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I pulled the duvet over my head and lay in bed trembling.
This could not be happening.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>After a couple of minutes the knocking kind of faded. It had
been loud and clear but now it was quieter and seemed further away. I decided
to make run for it. I leaped out of bed and ran into my parents bedroom. They
had been sound asleep and listened to my tale of "someone knocking in the
storage room".</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My Dad grabbed a flashlight and followed me. We stood in my
bedroom listening. Both my parents and I heard the knocking but it was now
fading fast. My Dad unlocked the door and turned the light on in the storage
room. There was nothing but our old furniture and stuff. We heard the knocking
one more time - then nothing.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My parents confessed that they did not know what it was.
They went back to bed. I decided to get dressed and feed my horse. On my way
back into the house, the phone rang. It was my cousin telling my that my Uncle
had passed away at 6am this morning. He had been suffering from cancer for a
long time.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>So, it seems like Uncle Fred paid one last visit to us. He
was very close with my parents but I was the one who heard him knock. To this
day I wonder what would have happening if I had said "Come In".</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Waking or Sleeping</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: sabinemacdonald@shaw.ca </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>This story happened to me about two years ago. I live with
my husband and a couple of cats in Alberta, Canada. My husband was working out
of town a lot - for months at a time he was only home on weekends.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I awoke one Saturday morning to a strange noise. Actually it
wasn't so strange - it was the beep-beep of our alarm sounding at the front
door. We had had an alarm system installed some time ago and someone entering
the front door would set off a little beep-beep even if the alarm was not
turned on. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The strange thing was that I woke up but my body seemed to
be still asleep. I could not open my eyes or move. My mind was perfectly awake
though and I thought how odd it was that someone would open our front door this
early in the morning. We always came into the house through the basement after
parking our cars in the attached garage. I knew it was sometime after 5 am even
though my eyes would not open and I couldn't check my bedside clock. I was home
alone and my husband was due back this evening. I was thinking while laying on
my back and willing my sleeping body to come back to reality that my husband
must have come home early as a surprise.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>But I really wanted to get up and check.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I have heard of a phenomenon called sleep paralysis and I am
pretty sure that's what I experienced.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Next thing I hear water running in the master bathroom next
door. Now, I really want to open my eyes and find out who is in my house. At
this point I am 90% sure it's my husband but this state of not being able to
move while my mind is fully awake - is very disconcerting.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Then I feel someone gently touching my hair. I have a bad
habit of hogging the bed when my husband is out of town and I had rolled onto
his side of the bed and was laying on his pillow. I am sure that the hand
touching me is my hubby's hand. He is trying to get me to move over and make
room for him in bed.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>With the touch, the spell of sleep paralysis seems to be
broken. I open my eyes. It's just after 5 am on a sunny summer morning. I am
completely alone in the house.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>4 Sale by Owner</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: kntmckinney@hotmail.com</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I call my story 4 sale by owner,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we were driving into the country going to a
friends house, it was a gorgous spring day and the sun was warm our friends
lived out in the country it was a inside family joke that I was such a city
girl that I felt like I was deep in the country when we went for a visit</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>because of the fact we were surrounded in trees.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>But as we were coming around the corner we noticed a sign
For Sale By Owner,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we called the number
on the sign when we got to our friends house and they said come right over.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>We drove down the widing driveway to a line of trees that
camoflaged a wet water creek that surrounded the whole property around the
house.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>We pulled up to the garage and I felt consumed with the fact
that I wanted the house, we had not even been talking about moving let alone
"to the country".</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The walkway was cobblestone and there was a bridge over a
koi pond to get to the front door </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>the closer that I got to the door the more I felt the funny
sensation of being pulled.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>We met the owners of the house and the funny part was that
the owner tried to talk us out of wanting the house at all.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>THe next week the sign was down and they said they had changed
there mind and that they were</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>not going to sell the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>6 month went by and our friends talked to us about the fact that the
house was up for sale again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time
we went through a realestate person and so they did not know it was us until we
closed.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The seemed a little shocked but it went through with in<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a week of the close we were moving in our new
house.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The first month went by with little going Then I noticed the
small stuff like we had a large amount of </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>silver ware after just a little over a month we noticed that
we only had 5 forks we replaced them and</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>then again with in weeks we were down to 5 forks again.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My husband commented that it was funny that it gave us
enough to eat with for our family but not to have any guests,</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>This went on the whole time we lived there we got to the
point that we would by forks at the </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Sams Wholesale Club in bulk.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Then the other stuff started to happen ,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>noises, doors slamming at all hours of the
night the small children were afraid to sleep in their room so we got a air
mattress<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and put in our room.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Fire alarms would go off at 3:00 am Door bells would ring
and no one would be there the radio would go on full blast,. Tv would go
on<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The temperture would either be
freezing or the weird appliances would be left on " like the oven on 500
degrees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My children were ages 2 a set of twins and 10 was my oldest
daughter,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my children started hearing
voices and seeing things walk past them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My son came running down to me one morning and said</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>and old lady was in his room and that she had told him if he
did not shut his eyes and go to sleep</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>that she was going to pour sand in his eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You would go to the bathroom and the water
would come on full blast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our dog would
growl at the wall, or be in a terror to get out of the house when most dogs
want to come in.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>One of our worst nights of being kept up with all the noise
in the house the banging and shaking of our bedroom door was like something was
on the otherside ready to tear it off. but when my husband would go to open it
it would stop and there would be nothing.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The next morning we were looking at the door and talking
about what had happened the night before when re realized that there were
scratch marks all over the molding ABOVE the door.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>This was a little unsettleing. Shortly after that we had
another bad night and through the banging and door slamming we could hear our
Rotweiller that had a kennel under the stairs that she slept in every night
barking like she would like to attack something.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>THe next morning we found her dead in her kennel we took her
to the vet to find out what had happened he said he would have to autospy the
dog .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He called a couple of days later
and</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>wanted to hear again how we found her .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>HE said that it was like she had been hit by
a car or beaten to death. We were sure that what was living with us had done
the damage to our dog.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>At this point we decided to turn to the church,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I called my dad and he brought with him a
group of ministers from the church to pray and read from the bible unwaviered
at what we had told then we</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>were experieceing He was there for about 30 minutes when
doors starting slamming and the front doore slammed open. That they took the
bible and with reassurance told me that they would continue praying for us. But
they felt like they were in danger. So they left me and my 3 children alone </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>to be stalked and fear struck until my husband returned from
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was like it was mad and letting
me know that that was not acceptible.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Things continued to get worse or at least no better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>One night I was woken up by fear I felt like I was being
hovered over in the room like it was right on top of me. I stood up and started
to go to the bathroom and threw up where I stood.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>THe next morning I started to get up and I was body sore
like everything hurt, I stood up and was just stretching when my husband looked
at me and said what the hell happened to your legs</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My legs were a black an purple color from the knees up to
the groin on the inside of both legs</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I never figured out what happened to me but my guess was
that it was him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if he could hurt me
and hurt my dog he could hurt one of my kids.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I got online in desperation and started to search.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasnt easy most of the sights were kind of
scary looking and I was afraid of what kind of people I might be calling I did
not want to be on tv or to have the press here. I felt like an ashamed victim
of abuse keeping our secret and covering the bruises and acting normal in
public even though We go to the point that we would go to the park to take naps
with the kids just to have some peace/ Its like they steal all your energy and
make you not think clearly so that you do not fix things or finish things that
you started.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I found a group and counseled with them he gave some advice
and told me to start a journal </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>of events he also told me to take pictures if I thought I
was having a problem to see if I would catch anything on film</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>On one ofternoon We were having a particularly noisy
afternoon and I wore the camera around my neck for easy access.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>One of my friends had come over and we were talking about
the fact that I was tired of living this way that I wanted my life back and
that I wanted this over .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We heard aloud
crash and I turned and took three pictures in the liiving room one right after
the other.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I looked at my digital cameral when I had finished and what
I found was one of the pictures had a dark red ball on it I definatlly thought
I had found something so I went straight to my computer and I emailed the
pictures to the investigator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He called
me back that night and said who is that in the picture and I was dumbfounded I
did not know what he was talking about</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>He said pull up you picture and enlarge it I did and what I
saw still sends shivers down my spine</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>because now what had been scareing me had a face You could
make up his whole upper body</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>and the red ball that was in the middle of the picture was
his fist that he was swinging at me</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>while I was trying to take the picture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The crew came up shortly after that they had to fly in and
they stayed over night </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>They took several pictures and evps and recordings took temp
readings and alot of data</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>and interviews with all in the family including one of my
friends who had witness a lot of the problems in the house</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The crew went out for a break and to discuss the house in
our garage my friend went out to get a soda out of the fridge and approached
them with questions on what they thought </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>THey had brought a medium along he looked at my friend and
said there is not only one spirit here but many he told my friend that he
stopped counting at 200.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
extremly overwhelming to me </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>And I figured that was it there going<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to come in here and tell me they will pray
for me and they are going to leave and all hell is going to break out</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>They did the job and said that they thought they had cleared
the house</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>and they went back home.. Everything seemed better for a
while.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>THe report came to us from them and some pictures they
caught a red and yellow like blob over my</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>daughters bed and several pictures with white misty areas
The picture of the outside looked like a strange fog with dark white lines all
through it </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>They said that they would rather not send the EVPs because
they felt they were too disturbing and that<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>it would scare me to badly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
voice and what it had to say was vile and violent and that</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>hearing would only make things worse still coaching me that
showing any fear is what they feed off of</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Soon after it all started again as though he had gone away
and came back when the coast was clear</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My husband and I were stressed to the max he felt like he
could not protect us and that he had failed us all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could not cope with that, and working his
work schedule SO a 14 year marriage was down the tubes,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>LEaving me alone with the kids in that house
was almost to much to bear so I decided I would sell it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THe realestate agent said he thought it would
sell quicker if it were empty</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>So we moved out and rented. The expenses of both houses was
a great stress and the realestate people would call and complain that there was
something wrong with that house the same things were still going on they were
just scaring off anyone who would enter Doors slamming we had a fixed radio in
the kitchen it would wait until someone was in there and go off full blast
light flickering</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>water turning on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
garage door actually slammed down and hit one realestate guy and then </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>several would complain that the phone and the car battery
would die after being there</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>It go to where no one would even show it.. whatever was
there was so mad that I left it took it out on anyone who entered,</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The house soon went into foreclosure, and ended up being
sold on line to a family from out of town</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The guilt of knowing another family was now bein g tortured
was awful</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>THease things are real and for some that have an entity that
is or was not pleasant in life remainded</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>that way in death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have since moved on but not at the expense financially , emotionally .</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My youngest daughter at the time has Emotional blindness
that they feel she saw something that has made her choose near blindness than
to see.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thease marks stay and we are
still dealing with the scars of living in that house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have had some experiences since but not to
that degree.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>We are trying to learn as a family how to deal with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its hard to go on its like you were kept
captive</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>by the most evil thing you can imagine and that you got away
but you are constantly looking over your shoulder for his return..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am remarried now and have 2 more children
one who has already experinced sighting. I worry that she will be effected
.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My twins are 11 now and still hesitate
to go the bathroom with out the other one.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They still sleep together out of fear. We would like to put this all
behind us but some of the peoples advice to us is that this is our calling and
that we are supposed to help the dead move on and help the living through our
experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that If I would do that
they "the dead " would not be so frustrated and act out.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I feel like I am still healing from the other house The
group that had come to help listed in there report as a multiple spirit
haunting with one malevent entity.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>If anyone has had this happen it does not just go away its
stuck in you soul.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I often wonder how
different we would all be had we never been touched with this I m sure it is a
part of my journey</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I m just not settled
on what I am supposed to do with it and how to move on with out fear</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>once it has touched you and left marks and killed your
protection the fear is there and for them there does not seem to be any
accountablility.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>A Ghost Named Emma</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: Mariah.Shaw@dm.af.mil</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri;">My family
and I moved around a lot in my younger years, mostly because my mom couldn&#8217;t
stand to stay in one place very long. The last house I lived in before I
shipped out to the military was an older house, and my room, as well as my
grandmothers room was actually part of a wing added on a few years after the
house itself was built. It wasn&#8217;t very long until I realized that something
wasn&#8217;t right with that wing of the house. It was in Florida, in the middle of
the summer, and yet my room, and my grandmothers room was always chilly. We
never ran the air when we weren&#8217;t in the house, yet it never got any warmer.
Yet the empty room next to mine would always boil. Eventually one day my door,
which was opened a few inches, slammed closed, and my dog came running up and
barked over and over again at my room. I knew something was in my room,
something not very nice. At night my bed would shake, and I kept telling myself
it was my imagination. But one time it seemed that the legs of my bed were
actually lifting off the ground, and so I ran to my grandmothers room and slept
with her that night. <o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri;">The
moment I knew that at least that wing of the house was haunted was when I was
walking home from school with a friend. He said that he had never been to my
house, but when I went to walk through the open garage door, he was still on
the side walk. I asked him what was wrong, and he simply said he couldn&#8217;t go in
there. I asked him why, and he said, no one has been in that house for years,
and that someone died there. He didn&#8217;t know who or how, but his family always
told him to never go near that house. <o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri;">That
night I decided to get to the bottom of it. I heard of spirit writing, and
decided to give it a try. I pulled out my sketch pad and let my pencil move
without thinking of what it was doing, and I started to ask questions. I asked
&#8220;Is there someone here?&#8221; &#8220;What is your name?&#8221; &#8220;Are you friendly?&#8221; and the like.
The three things that I saw on the paper was a &#8220;Y&#8221;, the word &#8220;Emma&#8221; and what
seemed to be a scribble of a person lying down pointing at a cloaked figure.
Whatever I had sensed before seemed less frightening then. As if I wasn&#8217;t
dealing with some pissed off poltergeist, but more of a Casper the friendly
Ghost. But as I went to bed later I fell asleep quickly, but was woken up by
something banging on my wall. There was a dark figure in the corner where the
noise was coming from, and as I realized that I wasn&#8217;t dreaming it stopped. But
the figure was still there. It was almost like it was staring me down. I was
terrified, but I tried not to show it. Finally the figure screamed &#8220;GET
OUT!!!!&#8221; and flew towards me, but vanished before it got to me. I ran out of my
room and slept with my grandmother. But after that night I slept in the living
room, in the other wing of the house that I had never felt anything out of the
ordinary. I only entered my room during the day, and only to get my clothes, or
a CD, and it was always cold. I never even used the bathroom on that side of the
house, because the last time I tried to shower there, it kept stopping, and
this dark slug dripped out of it. I know that was probably just something wrong
with the pluming, but it was still creepy. I shipped out the next summer and
have never been back (my family moved to a small apartment after I left).
&nbsp;I know that someone named Emma died there, but I&#8217;m sure she wasn&#8217;t the
one tormenting me, but instead the black figure she had tried to warn me of
that night I made contact with her.<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

Haunting in Basic Training<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri;">Hi, I
told one story already, but I have another perhaps more creepy than before. <o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri;">As I said
in my last story I shipped out for the military the summer after my first story
occurred. Well half way through training I developed a fever of about 104 and
was sent to another squadron, the 319th. It housed the &#8220;Quitter&#8217;s, Crazies, and
Crippled.&#8221; I guess I would be considered a cripple. I was sent to the dorm for
those who were sick, sense most were contagious. It really was a blessing to be
there after all the hell I was put through in the first half of training. I
could finally sleep in, watch TV, even talk to boys (We weren&#8217;t supposed to,
but no one would stop us for fear of whatever we had). Well one thing I first
noticed was that all of us were in one bay, and no one ever even went into the
other bay. I asked why, but most of the girls didn&#8217;t know. The self proclaimed
&#8220;dorm chief&#8221; who had been there the longest, said &#8220;Some girl had a seizure over
there. Before she always said there was a ghost, and that we should stay away.
But one of the other girls here at the time locked her in one of the lockers
and wouldn&#8217;t let her out. We were all in the day room and didn&#8217;t notice. But
soon her screaming and banging got so loud we could hear it over the TV. We
finally got her out, but she was passed out. So we called for a TI and they got
her to the hospital.&#8221; I was very freaked out at that story, and I guess dorm
chief could tell. So she quickly said &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it, she was more of a
crazy than a cripple any way, always has been. And I think she suffered from
seizures long before she even joined. There&#8217;s nothing over there.&#8221; <o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri;">Well I
couldn&#8217;t get the story out of my mind. One night, I my bed springs kept poking
me. I really just wasn&#8217;t comfortable, so I went to change beds. I didn&#8217;t want
to take all of my bedding off and remake another bed, but I remembered that a
bed in the other bay already had bedding on it. I wasn&#8217;t thinking that some
other sick person had slept there, my mind was still sort of feverish. So I
just walked over there a fell asleep. I remember that it got really cold, and
when I woke up I felt the same feeling I used to feel in my old bed room, that
something was there. Now not to sound melodramatic, but a lot of people do die
in basic training, mostly suicides. It&#8217;s not like half of a flight will off
themselves by the end, at least a few people a month try, and usually one will
succeed. So I knew probably a few people had died in that dorm, and I knew at
least one of them was there. Whoever it was pushed me off the bed. I felt this
cold hand go around my neck, and I could feel the breath of something screaming
at me, but I heard nothing, and I saw nothing. I passed out eventually. In the
morning I woke up and was still on the floor by the bed. Went to the latrine,
and then went to the sinks to wash my face. Looking in the mirror I saw bruises
on either side of my neck, and my wrists had small cuts on them. I didn&#8217;t tell
anyone, just pulled down my sweatshirt sleeves, and told everyone that I fell
down when they asked about my bruises. On my last night in the 319 I went back
to the other bad and slept in that bed again, mostly because I wanted to know
if what I felt was real, or just some feverish dream. I felt something there
looking at me, eventually I saw it too. It was a grey figure, sort of like
smoke. I had no fever, so I knew I wasn&#8217;t imagining it. But soon I sense that
it wasn&#8217;t looking at me anymore, but through me. And then I had a vision,
almost like a dream, of a girl sitting on the floor where I first saw the
smoke. She took the razor out of her shaver, and was crying, she dragged the
razor down her arm multiple times, each time more violently. She seemed to die,
but then walked up to me after and showed me how deep she dug into the arm. I
then woke up, went back to my old bed, and tried to tell myself that I wasn&#8217;t
crazy<o:p></o:p></span></big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>For most of my life I lived in Sherrill, NY (Home of the
Mansion House and the infamous Oneida Community).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house I lived in with my family is about
a quarter mile from the Mansion House but it was built after the Oneida
Community had dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The thing with
most of the houses in my neighborhood is that they were built mostly for the
workers of the Oneida Factory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most of
the houses look very similar, in that they have 2 large windows in the front on
the second story and a large front porch that spans the width of the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It kind of gives the houses the
appearance of having a face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My house
was one of the only ones in my neighborhood that had a different
appearance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not sure that really has
anything to do with the occurances or not, but I thought it was worth noting.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My family moved into the house when I was 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing happened for the first year or 2 that
I was there, but one night something did happen and that was just the
beginning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before getting into this,
allow me to first give a little bit of a layout on the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The front door has an entry way that opens on
one side to the living room, and on the other to the dining room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dining room, in turn, leads into the
kitchen which has a side door and a small porch, the kitchen also has a door
that leads to the basement, it also has a door that leads to the den, then den
in turn has another door that leads back out into the otherside of the living
room, so the house is one big circle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upstairs there are 3 bedrooms and a bathroom.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Back to the story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
first experience with the presence was about a year and a half to 2 years after
we had moved in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sitting in a
chair in the corner of the living room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From this corner I could see the entry way to the front door and beyond
into the dining room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was watching a
movie, my little brother was sleeping on the floor and my parents were on the
couch in the middle of the living room (no line of site to the dining
room).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the lights in the house were
off, and the only light was from the TV.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Out of the corner of my eye I saw a pale figure come from the direction
of the kitchen into the dining room and lean against the wall of the entry way
looking into the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
actually seemed like he was looking at me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This night my dad was wearing light grey sweat pants and a white
sweatshirt, so I looked at the figure dead on and said "Dad?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My dad said "What?", and I turned
and looked and he was sitting on the couch still.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned to look back a t<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the figure and it turned around and walked
back out to the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told my dad
that I thought someone was there, and we got up and turned the lights on in the
kitchen, and looked around the rest of the house, but found nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Strangely, I wasn't really scared about it,
and didn't dwell too much on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing
else happened (at least that I can remember) for several years.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>When I became a teenager things started picking up
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think it may have been because
at this point I began relating my original experience with friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Odd things would start happening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first thing that I remember was that it
appeared to my friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were coming
into the house from outside, and we were walking through the den into the
living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was in front of my and
as he opened the door to enter the living room he stopped dead in his tracks
and then started walking back into the den.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He turned around with wide eyes and said that there was an old man
sitting in a chair in my living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
went in there, but there was nothing there.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I would always hear strange noises in the house, mostly in
the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would sound like there
was someone in there walking around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
time I was in the kitchen with a different friend and we literally heard
someone walk around the parimeter of the kitchen, while we were in it!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We just looked at each other, as if to
confirm we both heard it, and then left the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Many times I'd come home at night and everyone would be in
bed, but it would sound like the tv was on in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd go in only to find that the TV wasn't on,
and no one was even awake.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Usually I wasn't afraid of these things, but there were 2
occassions that did scare me a great deal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The first was when I was 16 or 17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was home alone, it was the middle of
winter, maybe 7 or 8 at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
just sitting in the living room listening to music (in the same spot I was in
when the original encounter occurred) and I suddenly became very afraid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No reason for it at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was totally fine one moment, and the next,
I was terrified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked down the
length of the living room at the wall in front of the door to den and (bear
with me, this is going to be almost impossible to describe in text) I saw
movement in or along the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't
see an actual shape, but I was looking directly at the wall, and I saw movement
right where I was looking, it was almost a shadow, but not quite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Very strange, but it scared me severely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran out the front door of my house (which
was seldom used) because I was too scared to go out the side door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like I said, it was the middle of winter, and
I didn't bother to get a coat and I was wearing only a T-shirt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had no plans on where I was going to go,
but as I walked out the front door, I saw a friend of mine that by chance was
walking across the street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The only other time I got freaked out was when I heard a
voice whisper my name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was downstairs
getting ready to go to bed, and I was walking up the stairs I heard a very
faint voice whisper my name, I then felt a presence like something was
following my upstairs, but it stopped once I got in my room and closed the
door.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Other than that it was mostly just sounds, and on one
occasion, I was outside by my pool at night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From the pool I could see one of the windows in my room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out of the corner of my eye I saw the light
in my room go on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked up and it
stayed on for a few seconds and then went off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The next day I asked everyone in the house if they had gone in my room
and turned on the light, no one admitted that they had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The weird thing is, that that was the only
time anything anomalous had ever happened upstairs in that house.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>In later years things kind of began to wind down, and for
the last few years I lived there, there was nothing happening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My family still lives in the house, and I've
asked my brothers if anything weird ever happens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple of them said they've heard
sounds<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that would suggest someone was in
the kitchen or the living room, but upon inspection no one is there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I miss living in that house, and I always
liked the idea of sharing it with a ghost...Except for the one time when it
scared me to the point of leaving.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: Kthlnhastings@aol.com</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My Family rented a old house on Arch St. in Seaford. We
lived there from 2001 to 2007. I finally decided that we needed to get out of
the the house one reason was it being haunted. I have felt and heard some things
so did my daughter. She also seen a black apparition in my sons room upstairs
once. But, most of the activity seemed to center around<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my son who was 2 yrs old at the time we moved
in. Not too long after we moved in I was putting my son to bed one night as we
got to the top of the stairs he stopped me he was looking into my bedroom ( he
was only 2 at the time) he said "mommy there is a man in your bed" I
said what do you mean daddy? ( even though daddy was working) he said "No
mommy there is a man in your bed and he's stealing your covers cause he's
cold". I did not see anything and not from lack of trying. So I put him to
bed and went back down stairs. I had also heard noises comming from his room at
night thinking he was up playing around and when I would go upstairs to check
he would be in his bed asleep.I also had relatives who had spent the night
downstairs in the living room and could hear what sounded like a child playing.
My Mother had heard this one night and went to check on my son and he was asleep.
I had someone shake the bottom of my bed at night when I was asleep. I was also
laying in bed one night I couldn't sleep I heard a small child run into my
bedroom and run back out so I got up and checked thinking again it could be my
son and as usual he was asleep. Then, as my son got older it got worse. The
bathroom was downstairs and he was so scared he wouldn't even come across the
hall into my room and get me to take him to the bathroom he would urinate on
his bedroom floor at night. He woke me up one time shaking me and screaming
that there was a man in the house. I told him and his half sister to stay
upstairs. I grabbed a knife off the shelf in my room (my husband collects
knives) and went downstairs there was no one there. I checked the doors and
windows no one had come in. Then he really started opening up to me and telling
me what he could see. He said that there was a man a women and two kids a boy
and a girl there. They all had holes in there heads. And he was very scared. I
tried to comfort him the best I could and made sure I made the house as
comfortable as I could for him to live in until we could find something else.
Then someone I work with took me home one night. not knowing exactly where I
lived she followed my directions. When we pulled up infront of the house she
said " This is the house that man killed his whole family and his self in
about 15 years ago." I said What? she said yea shot them in the head. She
did not know anything about what was going on in the house or what my son had
told me. At this point I was so afraid I didn't even want to get out of the car
and go inside. I had goose bumps everywhere. What really motivated me to get my
family out of there was the night that my son was thrown against the wall by
something. I was upstairs cleaning when I came downstairs my son was sitting in
the corner of the dinning room with a terrified look on his face and his
shoulder was red. I said what happened? My son said that some man had thrown
him against the wall. At about this time my stepdaugter came out of the
bathroom trying to tell me what she heard. She was taking a bath at the time
and the bathroom door was right where my son was standing when it all happened.
She said that she was getting ready to come out of the bathroom and she heard
my son say "whats your name?" and then she heard a growling sound
then a loud boom. My son could not explain to the cops what the man looked like
other then he was all dark. At the same time when I found all this out I
checked on the dog who was underneath the kitchen table shivering. This is a
dog who usually lets you know when someone is in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not too long after we moved out . I also have
pictures the first one taken by my mother and the last thing we had on ours
minds at the time was to try to find a ghost. I could not beleive what was in
the pic. It was a face of a man. I also took other pics of my kids and they
have orbs in them.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Hi I find your website incredibly eerie and addicting!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a little eerie tale myself. Ive always
been open to "other" worlds, etc.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Okay, so like 5 or 6 years ago my friend and I were bored late one night
in Madera California, looking for trouble to get into lol. We remembered this
old cemetary out on Ave 11 and decided to go out there and investigate. We were
so serious we went to the grocery store and bought flashlights and batteries,
the while bit. It was past 12 when we made it out there. The place is PITCH
BLACK! Gates and fence twisted...etc needless to say our courage drained
immedialty and we didnt even get out. As we were leaving I saw a bright light
coming ahead on the opposite side of the street, at first it didnt seem to move
but as we came closer it started moving towards us. We realized it was two headlights
and as soon as our car reached the other car, someone (or something) threw
something at her windshield. We were screaming and she braked her car...we got
out of the car to inspect any damage (there was none.) I looked up to see where
the other car went, it had stopped not to far behind us and FLIPPED A BITCH!
Seriously, the car started comin back our way. We got in her car and were
flying! We didnt even stop at stop sings until we got back into town and I was
too scared to look behind to see if it was still chasing us. My heart dropped
to my feet, I felt so sick and scared I have never been so f'n scared in my
life. I was screaming at her not to stop until we got into town. Like I said I
dont know if it was our overactive imaginations or some kids playing tricks on
us but I have never been back there or experienced anything like that again. (
so far...) Id like some feed back. Also I was born and raised in San Jose ca
and some freaky stuff happened to my family when I was a baby and we lived in
this old house. Weird. Im getting chills thinking about it again!</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Hey everybody....My name is Aaron...I live in Moberly,Mo...I
am a paranormal investagator.I've been doing this for about two years now.I
believe that if you die a horribble death,or if you commit suicide and maybe
you regreted it,and nobody found the true story,then I think your soul stays
around to tell the real story of what really happened. ...I go to homes and
cemeteries that are claimed to be haunted by eye witnesses who have heard or
seen something they can't explain</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I've been doing paranormal research ever since my father's
strange death in Marine,IL in 2001...Newspapers say my father committed Suicide
in our home,But I know thats not the real story.I know my dad didn't kill
himself..He wasn't that kind of person.He loved life and he enjoyed making
people's day...I think somebody who knew him came after him..</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I came home one night from work to find my dad on his
bedroom floor and his pants were pulled down and he was moaning as if his was
in pain.I asked him. What happened and if he was alright? I'm thinking he might
of fallen or had a stroke while getting dressed. He was alomost 50 years
old.All he could do was moan and yell,but seem to have trouble talking.I called
911 and the EMT showed up and rushed him to the hospital.The doctor said that
my dad was coughing up some kind of slim.They did some tests and it showed that
the slim was antifreeze( what you would put in a car)The doctor asked me was my
dad suicidal? I told him no..I think if my dad wanted to kill himself he would
choose a better and faster way to go.Especially since I had a lot of guns in my
room that wern't locked up and ammunion was laying all over the place.It would
of been real quick,but instead this doctor is trying to get me to get me to
believe that my dad chose to lay on the floor for 4-6 hours and wait for a slow
death in God awful pain.The doctor said that my dad's insides were all ate
apart from the antifreeze and there was no way of saving him and he had less
than a day to live....Everyday I look back on that night trying to peice
together what little bit I still remember.Trying to think who might of done it
and why,but most of all....How? You don't just walk up to someone and give them
a cup of antifreeze and say "drink this"....I think it had to be
planted in something that my dad either ate or drank</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Years before this terrible night my dad and me were talking
one day about someone well known in our town who pasted away and how this
person got a fancy and exspensive funeral.We both thought it was silly to spend
so much on a funeral,but as we both laughed my dad told me told that his last
wish was that if anything ever happened to him he didn't want an exspensive
funeral and all he wanted was to be cremated and have his ashes sprinkled all
over the property of our home because his garden was his pride and joy,so we
did.Now eight years later I have been told by people who know the new
owners,and they have said that strange things have been known to happen in the
house</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I've see several cases of people who bought a old house and
lived in it for years and nothing ever happened,but then they get the idea to
remodel the house,and as soon as everything is done strange things started happening,and
then they think their house is haunted and can't figure out why because it
didn't start until after they remodeled the house...Thats because if it's an
old house it has a lot of history to it and there's probably some stories of
things that have happened in the house that you wern't told about,and whatever
happened in the house was so long ago that everything was quiet,but when you
start knocking out walls and changing the house your also changing the history
of the house,and whatever happened in the house during it's history...If you
know that one or more have died in the house years before you bought it, then
that means a peice of that person/persons is in the house because that was were
they entered rest,and a memory of the house is in that person,and if you change
the house then your changing the memory of the house that someone once knew</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I am so suprised how many people tell me that they think
their house is haunted just because they hear the floor creek with sounds of
foot steps in the middle of the night...I tell people this doesn't mean your
house is haunted...It could be the walls and floors swelling and shifting do to
temperture changes or the house could be still settling like most homes do,and
if the foundation is very good you'll know because you'll start to see cracks
in the walls and the basement will start to leak.Then I tell them thats what
all the creeking sounds were,but if someone ever comes to me and says they know
for sure that their house is haunted then I suggest that they go to the local
library and look at the old archives or newspaper clippings and do some
research on the house to know for sure,but if they find nothing it will give
them some peice of mind</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: silver_speak_7@hotmail.com </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I've been able to sense spirits for a long time, and believe
that the ability to do so was handed down to me from my grandmother. The
strange thing with me, though, is that the sightings and experiences come in
sudden rashes that last anywhere from a few days to a few months, and then stop
as suddenly as they came.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The most recent rash started about two months ago. I had
started staying with my boyfriend at his apartment in a Creek Indian community.
Early one morning, at about one or two o'clock, I got up out of bed to use the
bathroom. While I was in the bathroom washing my hands, I got the distinct
feeling that a woman a little shorter than myself was standing behind me, and
she did not want me there. When I turned around, I felt it run past me into the
kitchen. I went back into my room where my boyfriend was laying down, and told
him what had happened. I was so upset by it, he called into work for the next
day so that he could have his grandfather come out to smoke the apartment to
get rid of any spirits that might be in there.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Things quieted down for a while, but not for long. We had
been visiting with one of my boyfriend's friends, who lives in the same
community, and were walking to his grandfather's house (same community, again).
We were walking past one cluster of apartments, and both of us happened to look
in the same direction, behind the building that lies in front of the building
his grandpa lives in. There are clotheslines behind many of the buildings, and
this one was no different. The only thing strange was that there were clothes
on the line -- at around 1 in the morning -- and a woman with short curly hair
was pulling them down. We didn't think anything of it, but then just seconds
later I turned to see if she was still watching us, and didn't see her anymore.
I took a couple of steps back, to see if maybe it was just the way I was
looking, but she was gone, no lights were on in any of the surrounding
apartments, and the clothes were still on the line. I looked to my boyfriend,
and he said something to me like, "Did you see that?" We both took
off running to his grandparents' house and found his grandma still awake. We
told her what we had seen, and she told us that the woman who used to live
there had three kids, and would accuse them of pulling on the clothesline when
all three were in their rooms playing.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The third thing that happened out in this community recently
occurred while I was house-sitting for my boyfriends' grandparents while they
went out to a powwow. I was there alone (my boyfriend had to work the late
shift that night) with the dog from about 4:00 until around 1:00 in the
morning. The first thing that night happened while I was in the back bedroom on
the computer listening to music. I heard a girl's voice behind me, trying to
sing along with the music. It sounded the same as someone trying to sing along
to a song that they don't know the words to, just kind of loudly humming along
with the words. I turned around, and of course, no one was there. Later on, I
was in the kitchen looking for something to drink, and heard something bump
into a sack of tin cans that was hanging off the back of one of the chairs in
the kitchen. Once again, no one was there, but the bag was swinging slightly.
While I was still in the kitchen, I heard someone walking around in the living
room, or maybe looking for something, but you can see into the living room from
the kitchen, and no one was there; even the dog was in one of the back rooms.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The dog was what really freaked me out, though. He's usually
a very calm, mellow animal, but that night, he kept running up to me whining,
and tried to get out of the house on several occasions, even though I'd let him
out numerous times already. He also wouldn't let me leave him in a room alone
later on in the night, like he was scared to be in there alone.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I've heard many people out here talk about spirits
"passing through" places like it's a normal occurance. Maybe it is
normal for those who have lived out here all of their lives, but it's going to
take me a little getting used to.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Plato-Glencoe-Ferguson&#8217;s Cemetery</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I grew up in this area and have visited the cemetery once
with friend&#8217;s when I was in high school the fall of 2002.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We heard the rumors and what not about the
place and decided to give it a try, basically the only thing that happened was
my car dying at the end of the drive out, pretty scary for some thrill seeking
kids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More recently however a college
friend and I were scrolling through this page and it surprised me to see it
posted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This prompted us to do a little
investigating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first time we
investigated the cemetery (early summer 2008) we only had a camera and an old
tape recorder that caught mostly static.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We basically got disappointed not catching anything but a few orbs but
as soon as we got within ten feet of our vehicle we heard dogs howling, and
they sounded extremely close, which made us get out of there quickly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Basically we were terrified to go back until
one day we decided to do it again(late summer 2008), this time with a video
camera and a regular camera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We walked
through and hung around for nearly an hour, we tried counting the trees but we
weren&#8217;t sure which group they were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
both had feelings of being watched and this weird feeling of not being wanted
there.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After it was over and we
returned to our home we looked through our films and pictures looking for
anything, orbs, evp&#8217;s ect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What we
captured pretty much made us wet ourselves, as we looked onto a strange ball of
light fly across the camera weaving in a boomerang shaped form, 15-20 seconds
after that a flash and the light flew by again, faster than the last time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn&#8217;t until we got it onto a computer,
slowed it down frame by frame and noticed a little fingers in the shot just
before the light came by the second time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These fingers flashed in a millisecond, and we tested the camera we used
in every possible way to duplicate it, couldn&#8217;t even get close.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Basically, we believe we have evidence but
are not sure what to do with it.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>McCall Hall</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>It&#8217;s weird but myself and the same buddy who was with me in
the cemetery both lived in this building our freshman year at UMC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had stereo&#8217;s turn on to static channels,
tv&#8217;s shut off, and we always heard strange noises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A guy who lived on the second floor told me
he woke up to a girl standing in his room by the door, thinking it was his
roommates new girlfriend he brushed it off and went back to sleep, until a half
hour later when his roommate came in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
asked his roommate about the girl and the roommate said he was out of town and
just got back, so no it wasn&#8217;t his girlfriend or anyone he knew for that
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After it clicked in his head
that his door was still locked and his roommate used his key to get in, he ran
down and told everyone about it, shaking and scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have had my own experience with the spirit
as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night in my room, the same
room where the stereo and tv would switch off and on, I was typing a paper for
a class and something moved across the mirror behind me, when I looked up to
the movement in my mirror I saw what was a hazy grayish/white outline of a
young girl, after that my window slammed shut and my blinds started
rattling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We tried to catch her on film
in the following weeks but never had success finding her in the building when
we wanted to. </big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Sorry about the length of this email but I figured you guys
might want an update on the stuff we&#8217;ve experienced at these places.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Love your webpage, hopefully I can discover
some areas that are haunted and add to the list.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I am Lindsey Ware, a resident of Lauderdale county in
Mississippi. I live within 30 to 20 minutes of Stucky's Bridge and I have
visted your site Shadow Lands a few times this year. I have a story about the
Road in which the bridge lays on. Back in the summer of 2006 my brother James
Ware was on his way home from a girlfriend's house and had to use the now
closed road leading from Meehan Savoy to Point Wantia road as a way to get
home. There is a church on the end of that road coming out on to Point Wantia
Road and my brother told us the story of what he saw. As he came to the stop
sign he looked out into the graveyard and saw a light ,or orb if you want to
call it that, over a grave and it was not moving. James turned his truck off
and looked over at the orb as he was becoming aware it was not a glare from one
of his headlights. The orb, as he reports, started to move slowly towards the
fence by the road, which was just a few feet from the driver's side of the
truck. He started his truck back up and sped off because it scared him very
badly. I had a feeling he was not making this up because he was shaking and
fearful telling my mother, father, and I the story. To this day myself nor my
brother have been to the bridge or that road since. I've heard stories about
the bridge, but this was the first story I have heard of being near the bridge,
not on the bridge itself. I thought I should share the story that my family
encountered with you. Thank you for reading this.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The Photo that made Me a Believer</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I am an Army Veteran with eight years service under my belt.
In December of 2002 I received orders to be reassigned to Fort Rucker, Alabama
from California. My best Friend, Scott, and I decided to road trip out. Our big
stop was New Orleans for a three day visit. The second night in town we went on
one of the walking ghost tours of the french quarter. The third stop on the
tour was a house that sat kiddy-corner to a convent/nunnery. I beleive this may
be the LaLaurie House you have listed, but the story I was told goes slightly
differently than what you have posted.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The story goes that shortly after the Louisiana Purchase a
married couple moved into the house from France. The Gentleman of the House was
a doctor who quickly became popular for his skills. The Lady of the House was
an Artist and always enjoyed throwing parties. People would gossip about how
she would change three or four times in an evening, apparently just to show
off. The couple seemed quite normal and lived in the house for over a year,
they blended into the community nicely.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>One evening, during one such party, smoke started bleeding
into the house from the kitchen. The local authorities responded (this was
before there were any fire brigades) and found a slave chained to the stove.
The slave admitted to having set the fire hoping it would allow her to be
found, or else burn the house down. When questioned further about her motives,
the slave explained to her interrogators that earlier that afternoon she had
been in the garden picking vegetables for the evening's meal. The Mistress of
the House was on her balcony with a young slave girl of about 6-8 years combing
her hair. The girl accidentally tugged the Mistress's hair with the comb and
the Mistress screamed at the girl, threatening to kill her if she did it again.
Crying, the girl continued to brush her Lady's hair. Again the comb snagged,
but this time, in a fit of rage, the Lady of the House sent the young slave
girl over the third floor railing. The girl hit the garden bed in front of the
slave woman from the kitchen and died on impact. She was ordered to bury the
body where it lay.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>After the Mistress of the House was ready for her party she
confronted the kitchen slave over keeping silent about the little girl. The
slave refused, threatening to tell the party guests, and so her master chained
her to the stove.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>When the kitchen slave finished her tail a couple of men
went into the yard and quickly found the girl's body. The married couple were
placed in the sitting room on the ground floor and told to remain there while
the rest of the house was to be searched. Top to bottom, the authorities
scoured the entire home for any other signs of abuse to slaves but there was
none. Just as they were about to return to the ground floor someone heard a
sound from the roof. Going out on the roof they found a small 10x10 shed,
locked. Word spread quickly about the scandal while they were trying to get the
lock open. Finally, around sunrise they got the lock of the door. Cracking open
the shed everyone there was assaulted by the heavy smell of death and decay.
Hardly a sound came from inside. When the smell cleared enough the men entered
to find the place strewn with the Mistress's "artwork." Slaves were
strewn all about the room, mutilated. Some had their skin peeled off in areas,
others had body parts amputated. It was a gruesome scene. When they cleared out
the room one slave, who's arms, legs and tongue had been removed, wiggled his
way off a shelf (they assume) for fear he'd be missed.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>When they finished the task of clearing the roof, everyone
returned to the ground floor only to find the couple gone. No one had seen them
leave, and no one would ever see them in New Orleans again.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>This story was told to us by the tour guide as we stood mere
feet from the house's front door steps. The small garden the slave girl had
been buried in could be seen through the fence on the side of the house, along
with the balcony she'd been thrown from. When the story was finished, the tour
guide walked us across the street to the convent and began telling us the story
of the next site. On a whim I turned away from the convent and snapped a
picture of the house from across the street. It was a beautiful shot of all
four stories, and even the roof of that small shed could be seen cresting the
fourth floor awning. As I took the picture a chill ran down my spine and I got
that hair-raising feeling of being watched. I quickly turned back to the tour.
The tour ended an hour and a half later on the 6th and a half floor of the
Bourbon-Orleans Hotel (another creepy story).</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>About two months later I was going thru my digital copies of
the pictures from that night and I found something that both scared and
intrigued me. The shot of the house from across the street was not empty.
Standing on the third floor veranda was the clearly defined image of a woman in
a ball gown glaring straight at the camera. You could see the house through her,
but you could also see every detail of her; the ruffles that lined her dress's
red bodice, the fancy gold stitching of her skirt and even a comb in her hand.
It chilled me to the core. There had been nothing there when I snapped the
picture. I closed the file immediately and didn't open it again untill four and
a half months later when I saw Scott. This time the woman in the picture was
wearing a green dress and she was on the other side of the veranda, but she was
still glaring directly at the camera. Scott tried to tell me that I just didn't
remember where she'd been because it had been so long, but that wasn't it. The
next day I showed my little sister and the woman wasn't there at all. Then, a
week later I showed my cousin (who, like me has an interest in the paranormal)
and the woman was back on the veranda in a blue and green dress and slightly
off center. It was different this time, though. The picture seemed to have
faded a bit, as if submerged in shallow water or hidden behind a thin fog. The
only thing that was truely definable was the woman's face, again, glaring
directly at the camera.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I tried submitting the image for study by a couple of
paranormal investigative groups, including TAPS of the TV show "Ghost
Hunters". The image wither would not open for anyone else, or would simply
not attach to an email. The last time I saw the picture it seemed to be taken
through a thick fog. Not even the woman in the photo could be defined clearly,
though I knew she was still there because of the color standing out where the
veranda should have been. After that last viewing I could never get the image
to open again. Two months went by and the image file has completely disappeared
off of my computer. The rest of the pictures from that trip are still on the
computer, it's just that one file gone.</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Everyone is always quick to beleive when I tell them about
the picture, but they are also quick to mock me for not being able to produce
it. It's hard to find anyone outside Scott or my cousin to beleive me, but I
will continue to tell my story. It's burned into my mind, as is the image when
I'd first looked at it. To this day i feel ice down my spine when I even think
it.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Muenster, Texas</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Elm Creek manor Bed &amp; Breakfast</big></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>There have been many odd incidences at this Bed and
breakfast. About 10 years ago it was just a house built on<span style="">&nbsp; </span>vacant farm land about 5 miles in the country
by the Red River. It was built at the top of a hill next to a tree that is not
native to the area. and there are signs of previous buildings there such as
very old building foundations. It is also about 1/2 a mile from a very old
cemetery where there are mostly infants and children buried from an old no
longer existing town that used to be out by the cemetery. There was also a body
of a woman found shot to death about 100 feet from the front gate of the
property shortly after the house was built. There was a lot of centuries old
furniture brought to the house as well. Shortly after the house was built common
hauntings happened constantly at the manor. Foot steps from upstairs when no
one was home, all the alarm clocks setting themselves in locked bedrooms at 6am
when no one was home for days, sound of an infant crying upstairs, doors
opening and closing by themselves as you grab for the handles, and a teenage
girl in a white dress and boots would be seen rarely. then one night candle
sticks were being thrown around from the candle holders. almost the instant you
put it back it would be thrown back on the ground. all night long. The next
morning the house caught fire and burned down. It was rebuilt from the inside
out and reopened as a bed and breakfast. Only one haunting has happened since
the fire. a couple staying at the manor were swimming looking at the house and
a girl was banging on the window at them trying to get them to come to the
house. They got out of the pool and went into the kitchen to ask what was
needed. No one knew who the girl was, as no one else was home other than the
innkeepers. the girl was wearing a white dress and had black boots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>other than that one haunting all paranormal
activity has stopped since the fire.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My family has had personal ghost experiences in the Whatley
house. Back in the early 70's my dads uncle and aunt rented and lived in the
house. My mother has told me stories of several differen trips they took there
and stayed over night that foot steps would be heard and doors would closed on
thier own also she has heard a game of pool being played in the middle of the
night when all was in bed. Oh yea and just incase you think I'm making this up
go back and check your records of different markings in the house she says that
there is stains on the front staircase in the house and when it rains it
appears to be fresh wet blood.If you would like to check for reference the
people that rented the house at that time was George and Vera Walters.</big></big></p>
