<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Sometime ago......i was
working for a Security Agency. And i was working the 4-midnite&amp; sometimes
12-7? On many of my security walks every hour ,thru out the building. Their
really wasnt nothing different than the usual checking door , boiler rooms etc
etc. But one night , which happened few times on my watch. I heard foot steps
in back of me . Turning around..there was no one there. Thinking that i was
tired and imagined this, i let it go. ? Another night past and as usually it
was quite. Then it happened again, only to say there was no one there. I let it
pass for a couple of nights . The none friday night...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the same thing happened near
abt. midnight? This time i heard voices and some people walking just around the
corner of my security location.Upon investigating it, and the building, i found
......".their wasnt any one there"! This was written in truth as i
remembered it. I only workied there for under a year. But i remember this just
like it happen yesterday. I mention it to may agency that i worked for ..and
they laughed and said hi hhi , i was losing my mind. O well.The question ?Do i
believe in Ghosts? You bet. I am originallly from the east coast. Where i come
from ...Dates back to the Revolution<span style="">&nbsp; </span>etc
etc etc. Thanks again for letting me add to experiences of what i heard .<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I just came across your
website from a random search for something else, and began reading all the
wonderful stories your readers have shared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It inspired me to send in my own story that happened just last week
(June 2008).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I should start by giving a
little background.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I live in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">North Carolina</st1:place></st1:State> and my
fiancee and I have been renting the mobile home we live in since September
2007.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I found out in March that I am
pregnant with my first child and my fiancee's third.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In May I found out it is going to be a girl
(my fiancee's third), so we both decided we should name her after his late
mother Mary Helen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She passed away 4
years ago and she is very, very missed by the whole family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We decided to name our baby Mary Helena in
honor of her and call her <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Helena</st1:place></st1:City>
just as his mom went by her middle name, too.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now, ever since I met my fiancee and heard stories of his mother from
other family members, I have wished very hard that I had been able to know her
before she passed away because I am sure I would have fallen in love with her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Well, one day last week in
the early afternoon, I was sitting on our bed and was online using my
laptop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our black lab Brodie was laying
on the foot of the bed in front of me and our cat Mocha was perched on the back
of my computer desk's chair which sits across from the foot of the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being that it is a single wide mobile home,
our master bathroom's doorway, which has double doors that swing out into the
bedroom, is RIGHT THERE next to the bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And on the opposite wall from the bathroom doors hangs two large mirrors
over the sink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had been lost in
thought over the website I was on and so was startled when Brodie began barking
and growling and staring into the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I looked up at him and saw what he was doing, so I leaned forward and
looked into the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only thing
I could see was Mocha on top of the chair's back through the mirror.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the only thing I could think of at
that moment that he would react to, maybe thinking it was another cat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But then Mocha jumped over onto the bed and
sat there staring into the bathroom as well.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She is a very vocal cat, and meows quite often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She meowed a couple times as if someone was
standing there like she does to me all the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Brodie just wouldn't stop staring, growling
or barking though, and it began to creep me out a bit since I saw nothing in
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I even got up and looked around
the corner into the shower, but still there was nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told him there was nothing there and to
stop growling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat back down and
continued my online perusing and just as quickly as Brodie and Mocha had
started reacting, they stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It made
me wonder if Helen hadn't come to check up on her grandbaby and make sure I was
doing okay with her (I am almost 5 months pregnant now).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I know the deceased come back
to visit and make sure all is well with family because it happened to both my
mother when her mother passed away (I was 6.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was December 1982 I believe and after returning from Tennessee after
attending her funeral, my mother said she was overwhelmed by the scent of
flowers, but she was in my brother's room which was as far away from smelling
like flowers as a football player's socks) and my grandmother when her husband
passed away (she is my dad's mom and when his dad died, she told me she was
lying in bed one night and she looked up at the foot of the bed and he was
standing there looking down at her and then he vanished).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I have seen too many proof
positive incidences that the spirit world is fully active and interacting with
the world of the living.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ghosts caught
on tape, things moving when no one is around, voices caught on tape in an
otherwise empty room, eerie feelings and sensations, seeing things out of the
corner of my eye, feeling cold spots in an otherwise warm room, feeling things
touching me when no one is around...too many things to confirm my already
strong beliefs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have never seen a
ghost with my own two eyes that looked like anything other than a mist, but I
am a firm believer that some sort of life does exist after death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thank you for reading and
keep believing!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. I restored the home over a
five year period and finally sold it in 1999. Over that time multiple
occurrences happened in the home. From having a women's voice waking me up in
the middle of the night telling me that," It's in the fireplace" to
finally one morning while still dark seeing her standing next to a wall with
light coming from it. Upon demolition of the wall I found a closed up fireplace
that contained an old cigar box full of photos. Upon closer inspection I
realized that the some of the photos were of her. I found out later that her
name was Katharine Dodge and while she never died in the house chose to remain
there after her passing. After many attempts of trying to sell the house and
having her interfere I finally burned white sage to smudge the space. This
stopped a lot of the activity and the home finally sold. I had over 100
episodes with Katharine, many that my nonbeliever friends were forced to admit
too after witnessing her activities. I received a call from my real-estate
agent who informed me that the Korean people who bought the home from me called
his office at 2:35 in the morning telling him to sell the house that they were
getting out. The people left their things behind and once sold a dumpster was
filled with their belongings. They wanted nothing back that was in the house.
The house still stands there but is in great disrepair. I see cars around it
once in a while but don't know of it's residents. Nor do I know if Katharine is
still there. For her sake I hope she has passed on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1997 I bought a house in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Franklinville</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">NY</st1:State></st1:place>,
it had been vacant for 3 years prior. The people who orginally built the house
back in 1907, use to have a green house in the back yard, the foundation of the
green house was all that was left when I purchased the house and property. In
the 1940's through the 1980's if you needed flowers this was the place to buy
them there was a store built on the garage and extra buildings used at the
nursery.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>At night one could hear, someone nailing the
planting flats together and dropping the nails in a tin can. When they finished
their task they can be heard walking up the basement stairs, when I opened the
door to the basement, their was no one there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On occasion in the morning one could smell
the sent of lilac, or a older's person type perfume. Once in a while you would
see a headless dog with a curled tail, lite brown in color walking down the
stair case in the house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the spring I replanted the flower
gardens, and I would be visited from time to time by a black and white cat,
when I was watering the gardens at dusk. I would turn the hose on the cat, and
it would disappear. After that summer the cat never reappeared. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>My new girlfriend soon to be my wife moved
in, November 2004 she recalls it to be a chilling experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She experienced being touched by something,
and when she turned to see what touched her on the back deck, nothing was
there. In 2006 we had new wallboard put up on the ceilings and walls and
repainted the entire house outside and inside. We changed all the colors. Since
that time we have not been bothered or visited.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It seems that my house has alot of
paranormal activity. It intersts me and I continue to figure out why things
happen to me and not anyone else in my house. My house is in the middle of a
forest and it used to be Native American Territory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Indian Man:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I was typing on the computer
and chatting with my sister while this happened. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I looked out the window and I
saw a translucent, bald indian man running right to left across my backyard. I
was stunned and asked my sister if she had seen it but she hadn't. I was afraid
that she thought I was making it up. Soon after my friend saw the same thing
while she was visiting; this verified my account. The odd thing is that where I
live, Native Americans used to live, so it's very possible that something
happened where my house now stands. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Voice:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I was wandering around my
house at about 2:00 in the morning last summer. I decided to do something productive
so I got online and started to google information I needed for a report. An odd
feeling washed over me and I decided to google "Murder on [my road]"
and before the results turned up I heard a voice about three feet behind me say
"That is me". <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Naturally I was scared out of my wits and
I got off the computer. This seems so coincidental that it must be fake; but it
is 100% real. Let's just say I never searched that subject again! <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Demonic Chanting: <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I was sleeping one night. I
had a really big headache. I drifted into an uneasy sleep, but I wasn't
actually asleep; it was like I was in both realms. I heard a chanting in my
head and all around me. It grew louder and it was a deep voice chanting
unintelligible unknown words. It was almost screaming in my head. I don't
remember feeling anything but fright. I was able to make out some of it but I'm
too afraid to say. I think it was demonic chanting. When I awoke I was cold,
very very cold.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In 1975 I spent the night in
my future husband&#8217;s house on 41st in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Ft.
  Smith</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">AR.</st1:State></st1:place><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He hadn&#8217;t told me about the house before that
night. It was a cold December night, had sleeted and snowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We enter his house and turned up the furnace
to an already warm house, I almost froze to death that night, I had blankets
and decided to sleep near the vent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
never did get warm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning all
the cabinet doors were open, needless to say I&#8217;ve never had anything happen
like that before. I was not welcome in the house; I didn&#8217;t have to be told, I
felt it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>He told me later that, he had excavated the
basement when he remodeled the house and found human bones; the house had once
been occupied by a doctor and his wife during the Civil War.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I suppose many people had died in the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said he&#8217;d always ask the
sprits before he remodeled any of the rooms, if he didn&#8217;t doors slammed and the
cabinet&#8217;s doors would be open.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>He said you could hear footsteps down the
stairs to the den, cabinet doors and drawers would be left open in the morning;
he found an old (tin) metal picture behind the fireplace of two women and he
call one of the Mrs. Brown, he thinks it was her still in the house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Needless to say I would NOT
live in the house, when we married, he moved in with me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The following did'nt happen
to me but to a friend of my wife, it happened a few days ago<span style="">&nbsp; </span>late May 2008.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">June was taking her dog for
an early walk around 7-30am along our local beach Seaton Carew Nr Hartlepool <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The
beach was very quiet she was throwing a ball for her dog to chase when she
heard a noise behind her she turned to see a Golden Labrador bounding up to her
carry a stick in its mouth the dog greeted June's dog then came up to June
wagging its tail and very friendly, she patted it and made a fuss of it, it was
a beautiful animal with a shiny coat and obviously well cared for. The Labrador
dropped the stick wanting June to throw it, so she obliged and threw the stick
about 30ft away it bounded after it but as it got near the stick the Labrador
vanished into thin air gone completely absolutely no sign of it. June was
baffled and could'nt believe that something could disappear on a flat beach
before her eyes.At this point the hairs on June's neck began to bristle as she
realised she may have had a supernatural experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I've experience quite a bit
throughout my life when it comes to the paranormal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It all started at my old
childhood house:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It was a three bedroom, one
bathroom home in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Garden Grove</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">California</st1:State></st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If you were to drive by and
look at this house, it's a cute, little home in a good<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">environment.However; the
things I've experienced sparked my interest and curiosity about the afterlife. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Everything and every room in
the house felt awkard whenever I walked into it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I shared the middle bedroom
with my younger brother who was only 4 at the time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Once a month, I would have a
nightmare of a girl sitting on our pickett fence, with<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">red eyes aglow, staring at me
with such a baleful expression. She didn't seem happy<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">that our family was there,
nontheless, us kids. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The strange part about that
was, whenever I would have these awful dreams, I would<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">wake up to find my little
brother crying as if someone had really hurt him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I never really took the
nightmares seriously, though.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We had an old, rusty swing
set that we loved so much. I was only 10 at the time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">During the daytime,
everything would be fine and no strange feelings would occur.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">However; once nighttime
falls, our backyard would be off limits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My mom wouldn't let us go to
the back and play on summer nights and she...well,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">never told us why.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">One night, my mom forgot to
turn off the water hose so she kindly asked me if<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I would do it for her. The
idea of it was already bothering me, but I didn't take anything<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">paranormal into
consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So, I went down, straight to
the back of the house..and the walk there felt like eternity itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I had a strong, eerie feeling
that I was being watched and followed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I bent down to turn off the
hose and had a fear so strong that it made me tear up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I ran into the house and
swore never to do the favor for my mother again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Another awkard time was one
night, my mom was taking a shower and I was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">in my room watching t.v with
my little brother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I heard her call my name so I
came to see what she wanted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">She asked if I could go to
the towel cabinet and grab her one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When I did...I walked up to
the door in pure darkness...and I saw a hand, a woman's hand<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">with pretty red fingernails.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I immediately thought it was
my mom's hand, but the strange thing was..<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">it was translucent. I mean,
you could see right through this..person's hand!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So, naive as I was, I thought
I said..."Mom?" and instinctly handed her the towel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A split second later, the
towel dropped to the ground and the hand was gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My mom then opened the door
and looked at me, saying.."Barbara, what are you doing<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">honey?" And I simply
picked up and towel, gave it to her and said..."Nothing, Mommy.
Nothing."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">That experience never did
scare me, but instead it sparked my interest as to why<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I was seeing and feeling
things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">There were much more when it
came to that house such as, if you are sitting in the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">living room watching t.v., at
the corner of your eye, you will see a dark figure walking up <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">to the front door.
Immediately, you would assume someone was here. So, you<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">troddle over to the door to
find that no one there. It happens almost every week...to <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">everyone in my family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I loved that house, but I
didn't love being followed or the feeling of being watched<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">while taking a bath.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">After spending most of my
childhood in that house, we moved to another city nearby.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Now THIS house is quite
dramatic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I am 19 years old now..and I
lived in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Georgia</st1:country-region></st1:place>
for three years to finish up school.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Coming back, strange
activities started happening, especially in my new room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My grandfather passed away
three years ago and my room used to be his room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">At night, getting home from
my boyfriend's house, I would hear the floor creeking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I just assumed it was someone
walking around, but to find that no one was out there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I remember one night, laying
on my bed with the lights out and just the t.v glaring,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I fell asleep and woke up to
see a pair of transparent, vieny legs pointing my direction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I knew IMMEDIATELY who they
belonged to. Grandpa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Grandpa was watching over me
and that didn't and still doesn't scare me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">But...there's another
presence in the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A girl, I assume. I came one
one night from staying at my boyfriend's the previous night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I left the door opened
because I was planning on changing and going to say hi to my parents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">While changing, I have a
habit of looking at the door to see if anyone would walk by and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">see me change.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So, I looked a few times, and
when I looked the last time...at the right side of my door,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I would see this little hand
waving frantically at me as if saying hi to me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So thinking, I thought it was
my teenaged cousin, Diane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I peered out the door and to
my surprise, I saw Diane coming from the LEFT side of the hallway, and not the
right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Now, THAT freaked me out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">There's been alot more since
I've been here, but my stories are getting too long<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">and I do not want to keep you
for any longer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I do have one more story
though. I was playing chase with my cousin inside the house around 10pm one
night and I hid in my room. After two minutes, I grew impatient and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">ran out to the family
room<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and at the corner of my eye, I saw
a girl figure run away from me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So, I ran after it, thinking
it was my cousin..to find that of course, she came out of her <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">room a minute later and gave
me a look as if I was crazy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Now, I have done tons of
research on the supernatural and paranormal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I'm not more a skeptic. I
discovered that people who were born in the month of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">October, are extremely
sensitive to these things. I'm actually glad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Now, I am traveling all over
the country in hopes to find more answers!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thank you for reading my
stories and I appreciate your time!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We bought the house from the
niece of Leo Morse in the Fall of 1999. Leo lived here his entire life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly after we moved in we heard strange
footsteps on the second floor when we knew no one was up there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During one such incident, my husband, myself,
my two children and a couple friends heard someone walking across the floor in
the upstairs bedroom as we all stood in the living room below. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">One night, when I was taking
a bath, and was lying back in the tub with my eyes closed, I suddenly felt very
uneasy, like someone was staring at me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was no one in the bathroom with me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My son, while still in high
school, had similiar experiences of being watched by someone who couldn't<span style="">&nbsp; </span>be seen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our television has also turned on by itself on more then one occasion,
or channels have changed with the remote sitting out of everyone's reach.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In the Fall of 2007, my
husband had just walked upstairs to go to our bedroom when I heard him
hollering at someone and asking what he wanted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We all ran upstairs to where my husband stood in the door way to our bedroom.
He was staring at the back wall of the other bedroom, pointing to no one and
yelling, tears in his eyes, for someone, who no one else could see, to get
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This lasted for several minutes
until the man ( who my husband said was in his early 30's, brown hair, clean
shaven with round, wire framed glasses, dressed in a flannel shirt and blue
jeans with the bottoms of the legs rolled into cuffs) disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a very restless night that night and
my husband, who was not drunk or on drugs and isn't prone to hallucinations,
doesn't like to talk about it much but is very adamant that it truly happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We haven't had any more
"sightings" since then but I still hear footsteps and unexplained
bangs and thumps<span style="">&nbsp; </span>coming from upstairs
every morning after I get up and I know my husband is still sound asleep in our
room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">my name is Andrea im
from<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NM and im 17. ive had numerous
experiences throughout my life wit the paranormal. ill start from the beginning
i suppose. before moving to Deming back in 2000 i lived in Hatch which is about
an hour away. We used to live in<span style="">&nbsp; </span>what we
called the white brick house near the park and not even half a mile from the
schools (hatch is very small). anyway...living in the house was my mom my very
abusive dad who i call Alex i dont even call him dad my 2 older sisters and my
older brother and me the youngest. i dont remember the experinces in any
specific order but i remember them as if they happened yesterday they are all
VERY true believe if u want. we had a certain room called the back bedroom that
no one really liked to go in at least not alone. this room had a extremely
strong presence in and it was only when u entered you could stand in the
doorway and look in the bedroom and feel nothing but as soon as u stepped in
that all changed. you feel<span style="">&nbsp; </span>like your
being watched by one great evil spirit or a great number of evil spirits. u
would have to leave it was so uncomfortable. we couldnt even get any of the
dogs that we had throughout the time we lived there to enter that room. While
there was that room there was also other things that happened in the rest of
the house. One night my mom swears up and down this happened and so does Alex.
One night they were getting along(rare occasion i loved these nights) my mom
had put all four of us to bed so her and Alex had some alone time and were
relaxing together in the spa talking one night. in the middle of their
conversation both my mom and Alex saw the shadow of someone walk past the doorway
of the spa room. my mom thought it was one of us that had gotten up in the
night and went to check in on us only to find us all snoring in bed. Her and
Alex then asked us the next morning if we had gotten up and none of us had.
Another time me and my oldest sister were playing in what we called the second
kitchen that had a room off called the craft room. my mom paints ornaments in
there. we suddenly smelled a strong perfume that didnt smell like any perfume
made today. then we heard a conversation between maybe 4 or 5 people. we looked
in and saw 5 older upper class people in clothes from the early 1900's time. i
remember one man specifically he was bald with a brown beard and a looking
glass eye piece like the rich people would wear back in the day. he was wearing
a black penguin tailed suit<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>with a white button up underneath. he looked
somewhat pale but not very transparent. he turned his head slowly and looked
straight at me not my sister and nodded his head and continued to speak with
his company. i ran to my room and stayed there the rest of the day. We had a
organ in the living room along with a drumset and Alexs guitars(were all
musicians). Amps would turn even when they were unplugged the organ played as
though a very experienced pianist were playing it piano was one thing none of
us really learned how to play so it obviously was none of us playing it. there
wear times when the dogs would follow something we couldnt see down the hallway
to my mom and alexs room. My older brother one night got up to get a drink of
water in the second kitchen and thats where the laundry room also was. Hes 22
years old now and still swears this is true. he saw a tall figure standing by
the washer and dryer (near the back bedroom) and he felt it as a evil being. it
just stood there glaring at him but never moved as if it was frozen but with
the evil expression looking at him wherever he moved. he figured it was Alex
and said Please dont hit me Alex im just thirsty and getting water. the figure
never responded and he went back to bed. the next morning he asked Alex why
were you so mad at me last night? Alex just looked at him and said i was at the
bar last night <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">ur</st1:City></st1:place>
f**king stupid. My other sister said she was walking by the back bedroom one
night and swears she saw a black figure out of the corner of her eye standing
straight up against the wall and it tried to grab her with its arms but couldnt
reach as if it was restrained.After Alex left we moved out of that house into a
little apartment. theres only been one thing happen to me there. i got up in
the middle of the night to get something to drink and as i was going back to my
room i saw what looked like a blue broomstick shaped object lying on the floor
glowing an intense blue. i booked it back to my room and went to sleep. i dunno
if this is paranormal or us just being weird but my mom says that when were
were all asleep (me and my older sister shared the room across form my other
sister and my brother) she says we would all have a conversation in our sleep
even across rooms! i would talk to my brother in my sleep who was in the other
room and he would respond back and we all shared the same conversations. after
the apartments we moved into a trailer not too far from the white brick house.
this house was always said to be haunted cuz the man who used to live there
died of a heart attack in either the yard or the bathtub and he had two dogs
that died of mysterious causes after he did. it was almost as if they died of a
broken heart. there would be nights when we could here the clicking sounds of a
dogs nail on the lynolium tiles by the front door. i was in my room reading one
night when my whole dresser just fell over. no reason for it just fell over. me
and my friend rosario and my sister were all in the living room one night when
were heard a window shatter come from my room. we never found a single shard of
broken glass in the house or outside (even though the sound came from inside.)
i would always see the shadow of some walk into the laundry room and no one
would be there when i looked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the night
my great grandmother<span style="">&nbsp; </span>passed away was the
last experince i had in that house. i was very very close to my great
grandmother and i was a mess when she passed on(i was nine years old) that
night i slept on the couch which was right next to my mom rooms and she left
her door open. on the wall above me was the light switch. i was still somewhat
crying and half way asleep when something made me sit straight up. i could see
in the kitchen a faint white figure with no features circling around the island
counter, then i looked at the couch and saw my great great grandma sabre and
grandpa albert (they were my great grandma who passed that nights parents).
They passed away in the late seventies. i was born in 1991. i only knew what
they looked like from pictures, yet i knew it was them without a doubt. i
turned on the light and they were gone as was the figure in the kitchen. my mom
called me from her room and said whats wrong and i didnt respond for some
reason but i heard her. i left the light on and fell asleep. i woke up again
and my mom had turned off the living room light when i fell asleep..there on
the couch was my grandparents again so i turned on the light and they were
gone. i felt scared yet comforted when i saw them. the next morning my mom
asked why i kept turning on the light last night and i told her grandma sabre
and grandpa albert were on the couch and my mom believed me 100% and i told her
i was scared yet comforted. she said they were here to tell me<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mimi (my great grandmother) was in a better
place and its ok to let go now. they were comforting me with the death of my
grandmother. My mom also has had some experiences of her own. She used to work
at the bar as an extra income to help support 4 kids on her own and still go to
college. one night she was serving a couple when all of a sudden her hair
lifted as if some one was running ther fingers through it and lifted it lightly
by the ends. my mom was the only one behind the bar. the couple she was serving
saw it too. my mom told her boss and he said that one night he was closing and
had already locked all the doors when he was about to leave he walked into the
bar area and saw a couple at the bar having drinks. they simply faded away and
he left. thats it so far theres probably more to come that i will share later
on.. Thank you hope u find it interesting!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">By: kodochafan88@gmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was doing a rehearsal for a dance routine
(even though I'm not much of a dancer) and the director told me to move down a
bit on the stage. I moved down toward the end of the stage and felt tears come
into my eyes. I didn't know why, and continued with the rehearsal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Before the end of the
rehearsal, I was told to sit down along with the rest of the group onstage. I
felt like sobbing and brushed the tears in my eyes away. Out of nowhere I got a
sudden chill in my back, and the first thing that I thought of was a man with
broad shoulders, long black hair that reached up to the back of his neck, and
dull brown eyes. I felt like someone was behind me, watching me. I whipped
around, and there was the man I'd seen in my head. I didn't know what to do,
and I tried to tell my friend next to me what I had seen. He wouldn't listen
and after much pleading turned around with hesitation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">His hair on the back of his
neck stood up and I saw him shiver. He turned to me and frowned, saying that
the man was looking at him. I turned and saw the man was looking at my friend
and I, and tried to ask him why he was there. He smiled weakly and walked offstage,
down the stairs. I told my friend what had happened and he guessed it was
someone's parent. I agreed and, when we were released, went to the bathroom.
Everyone else had left, and the "director" was in the room that I had
rehearsed in, talking on the phone. When I approached the hall that led to the
bathroom, the lights started to flicker. I felt a cold shiver crawl down my
back, but wasn't frightened. I was crying for some reason. Then the man
appeared in front of me and said, "Good job." He turned around and a
staircase of light appeared in front of me. He walked up it slowly, smiling
broadly now, and I tried to follow him. The man reached the top, and I put my
foot on the staircase. As soon as I did, it vanished, and the man and staircase
were gone. I believe that that man was my father, whom I have never met. My
mother thinks I was hallucinating and has taken me to see several pastors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">They don't know about what I
have seen. I don't like to think about my dad dying without me knowing him, but
when I think about that afternoon, I feel better about it. I still think that
he was going up a stairway to heaven, and that now he watches me and loves me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My Story<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">By: demel@kcnet.org<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Just wanted to pass along
something that happened to me as a teen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our home never seemed to scary.. but a few things would happen on
occasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The one that sticks in my mind
most happend like this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its very brief. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I was about 15 or so,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and was in the family bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a small bathroom.. the bathtub was
behind the door, and the sink was opposite from it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I was bent over the sink..
washing my hands.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I felt something grab
the back belt loops of my jeans, and yank them up. (as anyone would do when
their pants ride down a bit)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The thing
is.. I was in there alone.. and I was shocked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I even checked behind the shower curtain, knowing there wouldnt be
anyone in there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Another time, when I was in
bed there was a pounding, as if someone were putting down shingles on our
roof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister and I had the only 2
bedrooms upstairs, so I knew there wasnt anyone upstairs besides me and
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was so loud, that my mother came
to the foot of the stairs and yelled for us to get back in bed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">These are just 2 of the
stories I remember.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">And on a side note,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I visited the "girls
dormitory"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in Academia, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">Pa.</st1:State></st1:place><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is mentioned in your Haunted places in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took a picture threw a basement window..
(the floors by that time had fallen into the basement of the building,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and has since been torn down)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the photos came back, I found orbs in
the photo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No sunshine was able to get
into the window I took the photo threw. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I am from Lock Haven Pa,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and my Daughters attended <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">McGhee</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Elementary school</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.
THe older one was in 2nd grade in 1996-97 school year.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I never heard of the haunting there, until I
read it in your section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also
confirmed it today that it is true, via a teacher that taught there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has now been sold to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Lock</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Haven</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, but is being rented to the

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">By: lindaparq@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hope all is well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started writing this last week or two but
it just disappeared so here I am doing it again. I enjoy reading experiences on
the Shadowland because it gives me some comfort that I am not alone in this.
Though I have had many experiences I would like to share these two:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">1. This was in August or so
of 2006. My nephew, then 12, myself and my boyfriend were on the town pier in
my town catching sea crabs. (called rati locally) They were at the entrance of
the pier and I was at the head looking out into the ocean. After a while they
both came to join me and we just stood there looking out into the sea. Oh! I
need to mention this was around 8 at night, it was already dark but the moon
was out. Anyway we didnt say anything to each other just stood there, a little
while after they got to where I was I saw a shape on the water so I started
looking more intently. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It was about 15 feet out and
it got closer and closer and i could CLEARLY make out the shape of a ship. It
looked old, like nothing we have today. It wasn't too big and it had 3
sails.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't transparent, it just
seemed like a grayish, dark shape. I looked over at my boyfriend and my nephew
and saw them looking in the same direction. They both looked shocked and I
could see that they saw something but none of us spoke. The ship was now
getting closer and closer when it got a little closer my boyfriend said do u
see that and I said yes can u see it too? My nephew said yes it's a ship, before
my boyfriend could answer. I got scared because it just seem to be getting
closer and closer and not sailing but just appearing closer and closer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Just then a car light shone
where we were as someone drove up to the pier and the image disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were all shaken. We drew up our nets and
headed home immediately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">2. This second incident
concerns my deceased mother. We were all used to my mom seeing and feeling
things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also had the gift of knowing
more or less what<span style="">&nbsp; </span>would<span style="">&nbsp; </span>happen before it did because of her dreams.
Not in all things but some. Well from the time we were kids we knew there was a
"companion" with my mother. She always knew when someone would die in
the family, or when an outsider would die a violent deat because the little boy
would touch her soulder or appear at her window. She said he never spoke just
stared. He appeared to her as a little white boy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Well this went on for years
but it wasn't until a little over 2 years ago that i saw "him". This
was after over 30 years of hearing about him from my mom and knowing he was
with her. It was a few months before her death and I think that's why he was
appearing more frequently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Our family home was like 3
minutes walk from my from my work. At lunchtime instead of going to my home i
would go to my mom's and be there<span style="">&nbsp; </span>while
the kids would be there for lunch before going back to school. This day
however, i was a little late so when i got there it was after 1 in the
afternoon so she was there alone. The kids had gone back to school. I sat in
the living room watching tv and she was in the kitchen. She the left and went
to the bathroom, a few seconds later i plainly saw out of the side of my eye a
little boy walking out of the kitchen into the direction of the bathroom. I was
shocked. I screamed for her. I was more surprised than afraid I think. She came
running out saying "what is it, what<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>happen?!" She thought something was wrong with me. I said "Mom
I just saw a little boy follow u out of the kitchen into the bathroom!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My mother nonchalantly said,
"oh him. He is always here, sometimes he goes in the room, sometimes other
places. I thought something was wrong with you." She then turned on her
heel and went into the bathroom as if it was the most normal thing in the
world. I always believed her but I think this was when it really became real
for me. She died a few months after that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Several Haunted Houses<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">By: hankypanky@lightbound.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I once ( around 1976....over
30 years ago) lived near <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Indianapolis</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">IN.</st1:State></st1:place><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I believe that all of the
houses on that corner are haunted. They are all doubles, so three structures
equal 6 residences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The things I witnessed are too numerous to
mention, but included electric wires in the basement hanging and sparking one
instant, and intact the next, lights going off and on for no reason, stains on
the walls that no paint could cover, strange noises, cold drafts...even in warm
weather. One item attached to the wall (a gold colored letter "C" ),
could be removed, carried out to the trash, I even watched the trash truck collect
, but it would re-appear the next day attached to the wall. (this occurred on
several occasions!!! We finally left it alone !!!) Once, I saw the kitchen
being flooded as water was gushing out from under the sink...when I screamed
for help, my step dad came to find the area was dry and intact !!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>One night as my parents were entertaining and
playing cards, It was brought to my mothers attention that she had been dealt
the Ace of Spades every single hand that evening. She hadn't noticed, but as
the evening went on....scores of hands later, Mom became afraid to even look at
her cards, knowing that she would again have the Ace of Spades!!!! It was very
spooky indeed !!! Shortly after that night, my mother contracted pneumonia...
several times, miscarried, and nearly died. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I almost failed the 6th grade (grades 1
through 5 and grades 7 through 12,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
an honor student)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>At first, I suspected that the house was
haunted by one of my great aunts who had lived there until her death, but after
talking to several neighbors, I learned that all of those doubles were haunted.
Then, I learned of a story about a little crippled girl named Sylvia<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that had been beaten, tortured, raped, and
murdered in the basement of one of those houses. Her attackers were all neighbors
from those houses. (this is a true story....you could do some research into
this tragedy. At one time I had several newspaper clippings that told of this
horrible tragedy, but I've lost them over the years.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I was so glad when we moved from there. Our
lives returned to normal, and my Mom gave birth to my baby sister about a year
later. I don't know if any of those structures are still standing, and I have
no desire to go near to find out !!! I know that no tenants (except the
roaches) would stay for long !!!! (note: at the time, all the properties were
owned by a pest control business, yet they were infested no matter how often
they were treated for bugs !!!)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Eyes of the Gypsy<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">By:
remember-the-js@hotmail.com <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When I was younger my mother
and I lived in an old house that just recently celebrated its 104th birthday.
The house has no interesting paranormal or otherwise entertaining history,
though the resident before us, who is the uncle of a friend of mine, enjoyed
drinknig himself stupid and then getting locked in the basement which is a
relatively creepy place, but not paranormal, just spider infested and gritty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My family has always had a
knack for seeing "ghosts" or "spirits" if one prefers. My
father claimed to see, as a child, a projection like image of people lined up
like a church choir against his bedroom wall, and my mother and grandmother
often see ghosts such as the soul of my grandfather's old friend Albert who
stands in the back corner behind my grandfather's leather chair or walks up and
down the "stairs" that are no longer placed where he remembers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In all of our houses there
have been ghosts. On <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Vine Street</st1:address></st1:Street>
lost truckers walked through the hallways and tipped their hats, I saw naught.
(This house is scheduled to be demolished.) The house behind it there was an
old man, the old town mayor who used to live there, that tormented my mother's
old cat by grabbing it by it's head and pushing it onto it's back. The house on
church street had a man that would say my name when I was alone, and a women
who looked just like my mother who would stand by the cat food dish directly
behind the mirrior in the downstairs bathroom. (I used to only see ghosts in
mirrors.) This ghost also told me to turn down my music when my mother was not
home to hear it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">But at this house, I have
really seen nothing more than the figure(s) and the eyes. It started as a cat.
Everyhosue we'd ever been in there has been a cat, rumoredly my mother's old
cat Gypsy who was put to sleep after 16 years to end her diabetic suffering. (I
was young and believed this, but I believe now that it was something more. A
demon actually.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>We havea grey cat that loves to get underfoot
so when one evening I was going to my room (without turning the hall light on
because mother was in bed and I feared the light would alert her of my late
conciousness and I would be in trouble), I was not suprised to see out of the
bottom corner of my eye, River, the cat, getting ready to walk in the crack
where I began opening the door. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I cursed at him and attempted
to step over him but lost my balance, the way cats always manage to make you
do, and my foot went straight through him and he vanished. I realized then that
it was just the ghost of Gypsy and went into my room and went to bed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">As the months went by I began
seeing the cat more and more as a wave of depression and solitude and rage
formed in me. As these negative feelings built up the blob of a cat seemed to
morph into a blobby worm, or larva. My mother saw it in this form, not I. Soon
it seemed to be more like a big dog that one could only see out of the corner
of one's eye, still grey and blobby but definately canine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Soon my sadness was replaced
by nothing but anger which I believe led to another upgrade in the demon that
started as a cat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">One night I chose to sleep
without a nightlight, I guess in a way to gain some bravery and a feeling of
self confidence that I was lacking for a reason that I've long since forgotten,
and I awoke in the middle of the night to see one light, sort of like the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>beam that reflects off of CD cases and glass
watch faces only without the numerous rings around it, flat against my wall
above my book dresser. Due to this being one of the first times that I'd ever
slept without a nightlight or the television on I assumed that it was just a
reflection of the street light outside the window, dismissed it, and went back
to sleep. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I awoke not soon after to see
two lights now above my dresser. At first, although terribly shaken, I tried
hard to tell myself that I had not seen the other one before, but it had been
there. My theory almost worked until I began to notice that the two lights
began spreading out a great distance across my wall to maybe three or four feet
apart and continued spreading. (Whether or not I actually saw an orange line of
a mouth begin to appear or if it is just something I feared could've happened
and commited to memory is unclear.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I don't remember if I turned
on my night light in an attempt to dispell the giant demon or if I just trew of
my blanket and ran to the light switch by the door is uncertain. All I know is
I ran like crazy to the light switch. The eyes either vanished or were
overpowered by the over head lights, but I was just pleased that they were no
longer there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The next morning my mother
asked me if I wanted River, the cat, to destroy my room (he's a terrorist)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>because I left my door open. She'd gotten up
to go to the bathroom and said that she saw two glowing eyes overtop of my
dresser and thought they were River but realized that they were up too hight to
be him. She never said anything about the eyes looking at her or growing or
pulsing or any of the other ignorant things that hollywood shoves into movies,
but she said she closed the door so that it would stop looking at her, if it
was, and then reopened it later thinking that I may have had a reason for
having it open. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I never have my door open. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>p.s. After this incident I have shut off my
ability to see things in hope of never seeing the demon again, though I am
beginning to see the Gypsy cat once more. It worries me. And also, in my house
my mother sees a girl who sits on the stairs and there is always something at
the corner of my eye in the washroom where the cat stares and where the dog
barks. Animals see what we cannot you know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">By: countdoku1@yahoo.com <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked on the shadow lands site recently
and I was quite frightened by a story I found. its a story on the first page
called "The Hat Man" and the thing that frigtened me is that I have
seen the same exact thing! But of course in different places. It happened in <st1:State w:st="on">nebraska</st1:State> <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Omaha</st1:City></st1:place>,
my home city and state. the last time I saw the thing is when I was about 13 or
so, I am 17 now but I haven't seen the thing since. It happened when I was
waiting in the car at the oakview mall at sunset and I was alone. But strangely
there were still cars sight moving, but across the street was a shadowy figure
in a 1930's-1950's hat that kept getting closer and closer to the car. i got so
scared I just started crying. my brother has seen this thing as well in our
neighborhood walking down the street by our house, it happened when we first
moved in. Anyhow just like in the other story the figure disappeared after a
few minutes. There was also another time I saw it when I was about 11 or 12. I
was trick or treating with my best friend and we walking along when I saw
something move. When I told my friend about it he said he didn't see anything
but right after that it quickly ducked behind a car. I told some of my other
friends about this thing and one of them said that they knew some girl that saw
one of them. It kept following her around, she only saw it when she was
completey alone. There also something else that was very creepy, I was watching
a supernatural documentry and I saw the shadow stalker making a stabbing motion
with a knife. I saw this documentry after both me and my brother had already
seen the thing. My friend told me that this particular spirit was not a
friendly one at all, she nicknamed these "shadow stalkers" the
"henchmen of hell". I cannot tell if these things are in fact
hostile. Also recently I had a dream with one of those things in it. I was
looking for someone and it came out of nowwhere and started just chasing me. I
woke up all sweaty and started to fell a chill all around my body, then it
stopped. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I am glad that i have not seen that thing
since and I hope I never do again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hello My name is Randy. I was
reading your website and thought about telling my story to you. Where I live in
<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Port Arthur</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Texas</st1:State></st1:place> our home was built back in the 1930s.
I dont know much on history of the house othe than that my Grandfathers late
wife lived in it with her first husband before he died. The reason I know it
was built around the 30s is cause after I received the house as a inheritence,
me and my wife was cleaning out the closet in back bedroom. We heard a thump
sound on the shelf by the outer wall. When we looked there was a rolled up wad
of papers. When we opened them smallers papers came out of it, which ended up
being receipts for lumber among other things for the house. The large rolled up
portion was the original deed to the land when they were making the city in the
late 1890s. It names off the lot number and the old road name before it was
changed long ago. It even has the signatures of the original owners and
developers of this city. But to go on with my story Me and my wife have seen
things in home not realizing what we seen until to late, like figures and shadows.
We heard noises around house and cannot explain where it woulda came from. We
had touch lamps in our bedroom which was the room off the livingroom, some days
the light would just start lighting up in steps like someone was touching them
til they would go back off and then continue till the brightest stage and stop.
One Day we was in living room watching tv and All of a sudden all at once the
TVs picture got distorted and we heard a deep voice, which we couldnt tell
where it was coming from, and the lights on both sides off our bed came on at
the same time to their brightest stage and stayed on. It all happened really
quick and me and my wife both just looked at each other and we both asked at
same time if each other heard that. Also we cannot explain dishes going missing
from our kitchen. We had a set of Glass bowls with lids for each ranging from
different sizes. Slowly through out a year one bowl including lid could not be
found. My<span style="">&nbsp; </span>wife at time accused me of taking
them to work and leaving them which I did not do. Now to this day We have one
medium bowl with lid and I think a small one left also. We went to the point of
putting crosses above all the doorways to all rooms and has seemed to slow and
even stop stuff from happeneing. A few months ago my wife removed some of the
crosses thinking we didnt need them any more and now my little girl sometimes
would be sitting there talking to someone that we could not see. She is only
three but my wife didnt know if she was just playing or what. It has been hard
lately to get her <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">togo</st1:country-region></st1:place>
to her own bed at night, she would say things like monsters and such. The thing
is she has never seen a scary movie or any such movie that I know of. Plus in
the Past year and a half We been going to a Apostalic church (Pentecostal)
where we removed all but one Tv in home except the one in living room just for
playing games on. So she hasn't been wathcing any tv since she was 2. I dunno
what to think but I do beleive In spirits good and bad. This is what led me to
your site when I googled Children and spirits. Sorry for rambling on but I
thought you might like our story and find it interesting. Thanks for your time
and I have enjoyed your site, which is an interest to me since I was
young.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
