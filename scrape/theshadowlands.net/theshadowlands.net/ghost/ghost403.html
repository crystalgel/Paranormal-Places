Cap<br>
<br>
By: JanelJon5@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
At the end of May this year I saw one of my best friends at a Doctors
.appointment I was taking my son to She was there to have a cat scan
done .She was diagnosed with cancer last year and we hadn't seen much
of each other. I almost didn't recognize her .She had hurt herself last
year&nbsp; breaking her pelvic bone&nbsp; and something else I think .
That was where the cancer had began. A month later she was bed ridden I
stopped by or&nbsp; called&nbsp; almost every day or every other day to
make sure her and her sister had all that they needed . I got a call
one morning from Caps sister telling me they were at the emergency room
.Cap had gotten sick and at that time they were running more test .The
results came back she had cancer through her entire torso.The hospital
sent her home to die. A nurse came in and administered nerve blockers
and pain killers to take her out of the pain. the last two weeks of her
life she was incoherent . Her sister and I had many discussions about
where Cap was at in her head during those last days .One night I was
laying on my living room floor and had fallen asleep. I&nbsp; was&nbsp;
on my stomach when&nbsp; I had nodded out. I was awakened by three
pushes on my back just above my butt . I flipped around to look behind
me thinking my husband had maybe come home&nbsp; . There was no one
there .I went into my sons room just to make sure , even though there
was not enough time for him to run back into his room and get back into
bed, he was sound asleep. I immediately new it was Cap and laughed out
loud.you see earlier that same day I had stopped by to check on her .I
had helped her sister and nurse change the sheets or something like
that and was helping move&nbsp;&nbsp; Cap around on the bed. I had put
my hand just above her butt and made the comment out loud that I was
touching her butt .&nbsp; A few days later my friend lost her battle to
cancer .We had a potluck in her memory at the park .a few weeks later
It was on a Saturday .The next day Caps sister and Caps boyfriend
called and wanted to come out and play&nbsp; Fuse ball {table soccer]
which we were all avid players of .Spending many an hour playing,
laughing , and having fun. Cap and I used to team up and heckle who
ever was on the other team.When they got here they rang the doorbell
and I answered it As soon as they came in and closed the
door&nbsp;&nbsp; the doorbell rang again I asked them who else they had
brought and they replied&nbsp; know one I opened the door and know one
was there I walked directly out&nbsp; the door and walked around every
vehicle&nbsp; and everything knowing there was not enough time for
someone to ring it and take off without being seen. We all knew at
that&nbsp; time it was Cap&nbsp; Even my husband who is convinced that
there is no such thing as ghosts said and I quote[I would have never
believed it had I not&nbsp; been standing here]<br>

Jerry Garcia<br>

<br>
This site is the best!&nbsp; As I was going over Illinois again, I
noticed the two cemeteries near my home in Evergreen Park, St. Mary's
and Evergreen Cemetery.&nbsp; We live 5 houses down (south) from St.
Mary's on Trumbull Ave.&nbsp; <br>
When my son came home from Iraq, we had a party in the garage, and when
the pictures were developed, there is a very clear image that looks
identical to Jerry Garcia.&nbsp; Many people have commented it looks
like Jesus.&nbsp; There are also two lights that come on when there is
a cool presence. Then the dart board likes to turn itself on at the
same time and score.&nbsp; Our friends always get the willies. <br>
Personally, I am not afraid of ghosts, I think they are just trapped
here, just lost souls.&nbsp; One patted my shoulder in the house a few
years ago.&nbsp; Pictues always falling and phone ringing with static.<br>
Thanks for listening, and I really enjoy this site!<br>

Legacy<br>
<br>
By: jmanderson@iowatelecom.net<br>
<br>
This is my stories of just some of my hauntings and experiences.&nbsp;
I have never had a dull moment where I don&#8217;t have contact with the
ethereal plain.&nbsp; <br>
My dad&#8217;s side of the family has always been &#8220;sensitive&#8221;.&nbsp; I can
feel things and I can hear voices at times at other I can see people
&#8220;in my minds eye&#8221;.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure how else to describe what I see
when I see things other than in my minds eye.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
In 1991 my family had moved from Portsmouth, Virginia to the family
home in Greene, Iowa.&nbsp; This house is a century home and built in
the style of English Queen Anne style.&nbsp; My great great grandfather
bought it off a banker back when and we have all the documentation to
go with it.&nbsp; We have pictures of the family standing in front of
the house.&nbsp; My sister and I were the first ones back since we had
to start school with everyone else.&nbsp; As a surprise for my parents
my paternal grandmother came and got us and took us for a camp out and
a cleaning party at the new house.&nbsp; During the night I kept
hearing knocking and what sounded like foot steps.&nbsp; I just brushed
it off as the house settling.&nbsp; After we settled in us girls
decided mid-night snack runs.&nbsp; So for about 3 weeks we did this
and it tapered off.&nbsp; One night after the runs quit I woke up from
a dead sleep to the sound of foot steps running down the steps and
chairs moving in the kitchen.&nbsp; Thinking that I was being left out
I went down stairs to join in the run and I was down stairs by
myself.&nbsp; Later in my senior year when we had taken the front porch
off to repair it since the original was still on from when the house
was built.&nbsp; While it was down I could hear rocking on the front
porch.&nbsp; I told my mom I could hear rocking and I showed her
were.&nbsp; Where I was hearing the rocking was where my great grandpa
used to sit in his rocker smoking his pipe and crack black walnuts
open.&nbsp; That is also where he sat down to rest and &#8220;went to sleep&#8221;
in his favorite rocking chair.&nbsp; My freshman year of college I was
getting up and ready to leave for classes.&nbsp; I opened my bedroom
door and walked into a cloud of pipe smoke.&nbsp; No one smoked pipe in
the house except my Great grandpa.&nbsp; I woke up that summer to an
old lady standing at the foot of my bed looking very stern at me.&nbsp;
Later at the family reunion there were copies of the great great greats
and there was the old lady was in the one picture.&nbsp;&nbsp; Last
year my father passed away from complications of leukemia.&nbsp; About
30 minuets after I got the call I had to call the funeral home. After
hanging up I promptly broke down and cried.&nbsp; My son who was 4
&frac12; at the time asked what was wrong when I told him he looked a
little confused.&nbsp; He said that he just talked to my dad
outside.&nbsp; He said &#8220;Grandpa said he was going on a trip and he
wasn&#8217;t hurting anymore and couldn&#8217;t wait to go fishing.&#8221;&nbsp; He told
my dad good bye and tried to give him a hug.&nbsp; He said &#8220;mommy my
arms went right through him.&#8221;&nbsp; My youngest niece also got to see
him again right after he passed.&nbsp; You see my son and youngest
niece had (have) a special connection with my dad that no one can
understand.&nbsp; That Saturday after he passed we were at the family
farm for a bon fire.&nbsp; I looked up from the fire and there stood my
dad in his Blue fire rescue t shirt new blue jeans and white
shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
I have one more story that I experience away from my parents home.&nbsp; <br>
Every year my mom and I go and decorate the family graves at the local
cemeteries.&nbsp; Out at the old Catholic Cemetery there is an old tree
with one limb that sticks out at a 90 degree angle.&nbsp; Every year
since we came back to Iowa, when we go out there I get the feeling that
there is a young man sitting on that limb watching us and laughing like
he is finding something entertaining.&nbsp; In my minds eye I can even
tell you what he looks like.&nbsp; <br>
I love the legacy my father taught me and left me and what I can teach my son and hand down.&nbsp; <br>

A Trip<br>
<br>
By: racingchic2004@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
A friend of mine and myself have gotten into going out to haunted
places to see if we are able to find anything.&nbsp; Recently We went
to a few places in one night hoping to catch something.&nbsp; The first
place that we went to is called Collville Bridge right outside of
Cynthianna, Ky,&nbsp; This night we took two guys with us that aren't
really into this but that will change later.&nbsp; When we got out
there we didn't give them any background on the place. But I done some
research and found out that back years ago there was a guy and a girl
that were going to prom&nbsp; he lost control of the car and landed in
the creek below.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the locals there have been
several rapes and murders out there.&nbsp; Well when we got out there
my friend and I got out of the car and started to talk to whom or
whatever was out there.&nbsp; One of the guys we will call him
"Johnson" got out of the car and stood there and the other guy we will
call him "Andrew" sat in the car and never got out.&nbsp; My friend and
I took some pictures and got some EVPs when we got back in the car to
get ready to leave "Andrew"&nbsp; said that he seen a guy about 6'7 at
the end of the bridge just standing there.&nbsp; And "Johnson"&nbsp;
said that he seen a girl in a dress pacing at the end of the bridge
like she was waiting for somebody.&nbsp; Well after I told the guys
some of the stories that some of the locals had told me they kinda
freaked out and wanted to go home.&nbsp; I talked them into
staying.&nbsp; After we left there we went to an old cemetery that I
had never been to before.&nbsp; When we got there I started to look
around and taking pictures.&nbsp; I wanted to drive further back and
look around some more.&nbsp; When we got to the back I started to get
heavy chested and sick.&nbsp; I didn't like that feeling so we
left.&nbsp; The pictures that we got from that night showed shadows,
orbs and we even got a few faces in the flash of the camera.&nbsp; Even
though I am just a beginner I am hooked and I cant
stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

It Started with the Dolls<br>
<br>
<br>
By: squrriel_of_america@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
This story actually happend to my sister, but oh well.<br>
And it happened when I was like 4 or 5 years old.<br>
So my sister and her friend were playing with dolls and a doll house. The dolls<br>
had hinged knees so the couldn't stand up on their own. So they were
playing when they decided to have a snack. So they left the dolls and
doll house scattered on the floor. And came and had a snack with me.
After the had finished their snack they wentr back upstairs. When they
got there the doll house was on the bed and the dolls were standing up
on their own ( remember they have hinged knees). No one had been up
stairs to put them on the bed. My sister and her friend got so scared
and they pushed the doll house of the bed and ran down stairs.<br>
The next day after that happened me and my sister wanted to see if it
would happen again. So we put a stuffed animal from my bed and put it
in the center of the room. And we made sure that if someone went
upstairs they didn't go into our room.No one did. So alittle later we
went upstairs to see if it had moved. Sure enough instead of being on
the floor it was on the bureau. Every day we woud try that and the
object we would set down would move. After a couple of weeks it
stopped. I haven't tried it again since then.<br>

Kingdom Arizona<br>
<br>
By: smplatt@earthlink.net Kingman Arizona<br>
<br>
Here's something we experienced on Route 66 in Kingman, AZ. <br>
The Hilltop Motel, in Kingman Arizona, overlooking the eastern part of
Kingman on Route 66, claims to have the "Best View in
Kingman."&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a fine example of an well maintained motor
court, with lots of neon, an atomic age style marque, cypress trees and
vintage motor court furniture.&nbsp; Apparantly, Timothy McVeigh, who
carried out the 1995 terrorist bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building, was a regular at this motel as well the Imperial Motel across
the street, during the planning stages of his deadly plot which claimed
the lives of 168 people. <br>
While we were yet unaware of this detail, my wife and I stayed at the
Hilltop Motel in the summer of 2004 -- in room 119.&nbsp;&nbsp; Facing
the swimming pool, room 119 does indeed offer a great view of the
mother road (renamed Andy Devine Avenue) , as it heads west into
downtown Kingman, and east towards the Interstate 40
juction.&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as we checked in, my wife felt
uncomfortable in the room, like something, or someone was watching
her.&nbsp; She made me cover the mirror in the room with a towel just
to be safe.&nbsp; <br>
I experienced a nightmare in the middle of the night -- I dreampt I was
reading a magazine in bed, and an angry presence knocked the magazine
that I was reading out of my hands.&nbsp; I shouted "Hey, I was reading
that!"&nbsp;&nbsp; My wife heard me shout in the middle of my sleep,
and tried to wake me, but I had sunk into a deeper sleep and couldn't
be wakened. It was shortly after this, that my wife was riveted to her
side of the bed by something that she describes as a black shadow that
surrounded her.&nbsp; She claims that it sent electric shock waves
pulsating through her body, and she could not breath, speak, or
move.&nbsp; This seizure like experience lasted for what seemed to her
to be several minutes.&nbsp; My wife has no other description or
explanation of what occured, but insists that whatever it was, it was
intent on hurting her.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day, we poked around and
discovered mysterious brown stains embedded in the linoleum of the
bathroom floor.&nbsp; The room was clean enough, but behind the bureau
were more stains in a splatter pattern.&nbsp; Small holes, like bullet
holes, were missing from parts of the concrete block wall at random
intervals.&nbsp; Perhaps there are logical explanations, but we didn't
mention anything about it to the proprieter who asked us as we were
leaving, "if everything was alright during our stay."&nbsp; After
breakfast, we headed up to Las Vegas.&nbsp; Throughout the day, my wife
complained of soreness in her joints, and diminished symptoms of what
she had felt so strongly the night before.&nbsp; We are both young, in
good health, and travel often.&nbsp; We have yet to experience anything
like this again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

Bama Theatre Ghost<br>
<br>
By: filmnoirgirl16@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
There is an old theatre in my hometown of Tuscaloosa, AL. It is called
the Bama Theatre. It was built in 1938, and was part movie house, part
City Hall. Then it was converted into primarily a performing arts
theatre, and the City Hall building bacame the headquarters for the
Arts Council. For years I have heard stories of ghosts in the Bama, but
the only one I heard more than once was the story of the bullet holes
in the wall of an upstairs dressing room. I don't know if they really
are there, the dressing room in question had been completely renovated
by the time I went up there for the first time. I had been dancing in
recitals at the Bama ever since I was four, but I had never been in the
left wings until I was 12, and I was in a show there. <br>
My first experience with the ghost came 2 years later, when I was in
another show there. It was our school show, and the director had
promised to tell some of the younger girls the ghost story of the Bama
Theatre, but he forgot about it. So in rehearsal one day, there were
about six of us waiting in the left wing a few characters were
reworking a dance. It was going to take a whilr so the younger girls
asked me to tell them the story of the ghost. My story was the basic
one that I had heard all of my life with a little bit of it made up by
yours truly. Seeing that they were scared, I finished with a, "I don't
believe in ghosts though, it's probably not even true." They scampered
off giggling at the story and I was left standing there. There were
seven other people on that side of the stage and I could see all of
them from where I was standing. I was further back than anyone else,
and my back was to an old spiral staircase, if you go up it, that's
where the bulletholes are supposedly, but no one could go up there
because they were being renovated. All of a sudden, I felt hands on my
waist like someone was trying to scare me, I tried to brush the hands
away, but there were no real hands there. I turned around, still
feeling hands on my waist, but there was no one behind me. My friends
all believed me, because they said I looked like I was about to faint,
I turned so pale. I still don't go anywhere in the theatre alone. <br>
Now, this year, we had our school musical at the Bama again and the
ghost made itself known to more people than me. This year there were
three incidents. The first one, there were a lot of us crowding around
about to go on stage. I was in the back, with two other girls, when
Charlie turned around and said "Who tapped me?" Now I know for a fact
that no one tapped him. I didn't, and Ashley and Renita were playing a
clapping game, no one else could have either. Then, about an hour
before the first show started, the director found me and Will, to show
us how we needed to get to the back of the house. It was raining, so we
couldn't go outside like we had been, so he wanted us to go through the
Arts Council building. I knew how to get there, but Will didn't so I
showed him. No one could find the light switch so we had to find our
way in the dark. Needless to say I wasn't too thrilled about that. We
ran up a flight of stairs and when we turned to go down the hall, we
saw the hazy outline of a person, it looked like a woman in a black
dress. She was about twenty feet ahead of us and she turned the corner
before we did. By the time we got to the corner, she was gone. We were
so scared we ran back down the flight of stairs so fast that we fell
down and tumbled down the last flight. The next night we, meaning
Ashley, Renita, Houston and I, were waiting in the gallery, at about
the same spot where Will and I had seen the lady in the black dress the
nght before. We couldn't go down to our places, because there were
still people in lobby. Houston, who was playing Sarah Brown, (we were
doing Guys and Dolls), was very nervous. She started singing, "I'll
Know when my Love Comes Along". When she finished, we heard a voice
from the balcony sing the exact same thing, except she sang it a little
bit higher than Houston did. We all ran into the balcony, only to find
that the only person in the balcony was Mr. von Redlich, the director,
and he hadn't heard anything. <br>
As to the identity of the ghost, I don't know. My father wrote a story
on the theatre for the magazine he publishes. I told him my story, and
he called to ask the theatre manager about it. The manager says that
there is no ghost, but I know what happened to me, and I hope you
believe me.<br>

King's Tavern <br>
<br>
By: denley6@bellsouth.net <br>
<br>
My family and I ate dinner at the King's Tavern resturant last night and <br>
something strange happened to my daughter Brandi who is 8. We had to pick my <br>
husband up at the airport in Shrevepor LA the night before this and stayed the <br>
night in Monroe LA. On the way home to Eupora MS we decided to spend the day <br>
in Natchez sightseeing. My husband mentioned he had never been to Natchez and <br>
always wanted to see it, so began the day of sightseeing in Natchez. We passed <br>
the King's Tavern and I told my husband I had seen it on television as being <br>
haunted. He asked if we wanted to eat there for dinner later when we were done <br>
sightseeing and we all said yes except for Brandi. She was not thrilled about <br>
it at all. In our family majority rules so we went to dinner later that night <br>
about six o'clock. We assured Brandi that it was not a place where people <br>
would be jumping out to scare her. She said she would go, but if someone <br>
jumped out she was going to sit in the car. When we got there the lady greeted <br>
us by saying that this was an authentic haunted resturant and I looked at <br>
Brandi just waiting for her to run back out the door! She didn't. The lady <br>
then told us that a lady named Madiline was killed there and haunted the place <br>
along with a few other ghost. On the wall in the front as you walk in is a <br>
picture of Madiline. She is a pretty young girl, but in the picture her eyes <br>
are very strange to look at. We sat down and we were given some things to read <br>
about the place. It is a very nice place inside and Brandi said she liked the <br>
way it looked inside. We we sitting at a table that is in the middle of the <br>
resturant and was positioned up against a wide thick brick pillar. The back of <br>
Brandi's chair was up against the pillar kind of at an angle so that her back <br>
was almost up against it. We were told that we could at anytime go upstairs <br>
and check out the second and third floor. Sightings of different things have <br>
been seen upstairs as well as by the fireplace where we were eating. King's <br>
Tavern was dated back before 1789. Madiline was the mistress of the owner and <br>
his wife found out and had her killed and stuck her body in the fireplace and <br>
burned it. When they renovated the place in 1930 3 sets of skeletal remains <br>
were found. One of them a young female and two males. So anyway we're eating <br>
and of course Dustin my 10 year old wanted to go up asap. We told him after <br>
dinner we would. Well dinner was great even the kids enjoyed thiers which was <br>
shocking because unless it's fast food they don't really like to eat out. My <br>
husband, Dustin and Brandi went upstairs and I waited until they came back to <br>
go up. Brandi didn't want to go back up with me, but Dustin did. I got as far <br>
as the second floor and told Dustin go get your dad to go up with me, he <br>
laughed at me and went to get my husband. Well he never came up. I waited and <br>
finally another person came up and I went upstairs. WOW! I stayed a minute and <br>
went back down. I asked my husband why he didn't come up and he said Brandi <br>
wouldn't let him. I asked Brandi why and she said she didn't want to sit <br>
downstairs by herself because someone kept knocking on her chair. I looked at <br>
my husband and told him he needed to quit trying to scare her. He said he <br>
didn't. I asked Brandi where they were knocking on the chair and she said the <br>
back of it. She asked me if I could hear it and I looked and my husband and he <br>
said I swear I did not touch here chair. We were waiting for our check and <br>
Brandi said mama did you hear that and I said no what? She said someone <br>
knocked on my chair again. There was no way my husband could have done it <br>
without me seeing him do it. We were seated in the middle of the place with an <br>
isle to the left and right of us with Brandi's chair backed up almost to the <br>
brick pillar. Oh yeah they had lit the fireplace and right after that is when <br>
Brandi heard someone knocking on her chair. Now, I know we were all excited <br>
about going here to eat, but Brandi was not. She is after all only 8. She <br>
didn't think anything of the knocking other than wondering why we couldn't hear <br>
it. It didn't occur to her it could be something else, so we kind of just said <br>
maybe the waitress did it. Unless that waitress was 2 inches wide and walked <br>
in between me and Brandi there was no way a waitress did it, of course Brandi <br>
accepted this excuse and we left. I am not sure what was knocking on the back <br>
on Brandi's chair, but my skeptical husband is not so much a skeptic anymore!<br>

History Of Ghostly Encounters<br>
<br>
By: Jeremy.B.Lentz@uscg.mil<br>
<br>
For some reason, my family has had a history of ghostly
encounters.&nbsp; Here is one told to me by my mother. The second is my
own account.<br>
When my mother was a child, she often stayed at her grandparents house
along with her sister and two brothers.&nbsp; Now, the house my
great-grandmother lived in was alongside the Mississippi River and had
been standing there for almost 250 years.&nbsp; My mother and my aunts
and uncles swear to their being a ghost of a dead pirate there.&nbsp;
Even my stoic great-grandmother admitted a cold chill whenever she went
to the basement.&nbsp; But according to my mother, the ghost used to
deliver letters from one room to another.&nbsp; The children would
write a letter and slip under their closed door, only to have it
mysteriously appear in a separate room where someone else waited for
it.&nbsp; And they never thought anything of it!&nbsp; The story is
rather fragmented, but that was over 40 years ago when it occurred, and
I wasn&#8217;t personally there myself.<br>
My second story is my own account.&nbsp; A week before I joined the
Coast Guard, my beloved grandmother passed away.&nbsp; It hit the
family pretty hard, because she was such an animated woman and her
death was rather sudden.&nbsp; A year after this happened, I was
stationed in Seattle when I noticed some odd things happening.&nbsp; My
mother had given my wife boxes of items that once belonged to my
grandmother.&nbsp; Mostly they were ceramic knick-knacks, books and
pictures.&nbsp; But for some reason, they never wanted to stay
put.&nbsp; We would have a vase moved across the room when we were out
of the house.&nbsp; Or the books on our bookshelf would be rearranged,
which was off because my wife had a compulsiveness to put them in a
specific order.&nbsp; But none of this ever really surprised me or
scared me in the slightest.&nbsp; I knew who was doing it.&nbsp; I told
my mother about this, and she laughed and said that it sounded exactly
like my grandmother.&nbsp; And ever since I told her, the strange
things have stopped.&nbsp; I think my grandmother knew I got the joke <br>
This may not be as scary as some of the other stories, but its all completely true.&nbsp; <br>

Haunted Home in Mpls., MN.<br>
<br>
By: richardmalahn@MSN.com <br>
<br>
<br>
I grew up in Northeast Minneapolis, Minnesota, in a predominantly
Polish neighborhood-My mother, older sister, and I lived in an old
house converted to a duplex.&nbsp; This house was built in 1887 or
1892-I cannot remember which- and we had moved in back in 1981-82, when
I was 5 years old.&nbsp; The house had a full basement with unusual
foundations, built very thick-about 2 1/2 times thicker than usual-and
towards the front of the building, back of the basement, were two coal
rooms, one with the required coal shute, bricked up in the '70's.&nbsp;
The first floor was our living space, and wasn't unusual in any real
way(due to my mother, I'm sure).&nbsp; The second floor was similar to
the first architectually, but had it's own non-paying residents(we
rented it out often)hanging about.&nbsp; Then there was the Attic, my
favorite hiding place growing up....<br>
As a little girl, I had often had reasons to hide in the attic, even in
the winter, when the heat didn't reach so high.&nbsp; One reason was my
mother, the other reason was that my friend Emily lived there.&nbsp;
There was also the kindly Old Man With a Cane and another girl
too.&nbsp; It wasn't until I was maybe 10 years old that I realized
that those three people in the Attic were....unusual-meaning I had
thought that it was normal to be....well, normal with ghosts.&nbsp; The
second floor apartment had two brothers as permanent, heard, yet
unseen, residents.&nbsp; These two were the ghostly version of The Odd
Couple, and we assumed, after some history checking with the older
neighbors, the former owners of the house.&nbsp; Nearly every night for
about 21 years, at about 1:30 am(after bar close), my mother would hear
stumbling footsteps going up the front stairs to the 2nd floor.&nbsp;
Whenever I slept upstairs(when we didn't have any renters or when my
sister resided there), I would awaken at 2 am to the smells of cooking
food and the clashing and clanging of pots and pans and dishes.&nbsp;
After that, the night would be silent again.<br>
Overall, most of the unseen residents were harmless and went their way,
as we went ours.&nbsp; Except for the basement.&nbsp; My mother has
told my sister and I that she's never felt any disturbances down there,
but my sister(older than I by six years)and I were terrified to go down
to do laundry or for Tornado warnings....and so were our dogs.&nbsp;
None of our various cats over the years had any issues, however.&nbsp;
If you watched the cats, though, especially in the basement, you could
see that they were aware of a presence we humans couldn't see.&nbsp;
The first presence, and I know how clich&eacute; this is, was
underneath the stairs leading up to the rest of the house....&nbsp; All
I can tell you is what my sister and I (along with a few others who
were unaware of any history) experienced over the years of venturing
into the basement alone to do laundry....the steps were wooden and
open-backed, so that when going up, you could see the dark area beneath
the stairs.&nbsp; Sometimes I heard....panting.&nbsp; A large animal
panting.&nbsp; We never saw anything, but that....feeling.&nbsp; It was
acutely physical, starting from the high back of the neck and spreading
down the spine, the feeling that something big was behind us,
staring....then, no matter what tricks we tried to stop ourselves, we
would panic and start running up the stairs as fast as we could.&nbsp;
I know my sister and I agreed that there was the sensation of being
chased, of malice, an animal hostility, yet I don't know if she ever
heard the scrabbling of claws on the stairs behind her as she ran....I
know I did.<br>
The other 'thing' in the basement was the one the cats could see, back
towards the coal rooms, in the back of the basement, front of the
house.&nbsp; I was the only one dumb enough to go back there, but we
had a 'sensitive' go back there once.&nbsp; She said it was definitely
an animal, a very territorial one.&nbsp; I'd have to agree.&nbsp;
Nothing would happen unless I got too close to the coal cribs, and then
I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck rising and if I went
closer, I would hear a deep rumbling growl, so deep, I could feel it in
my chest.&nbsp; I always hated the basement.<br>
My mother sold the house and moved out of the cities a few years
ago.&nbsp; When she was fixing up the house to sell it, the 'permanent
residents' went slightly..wild.&nbsp; They weren't happy, for
sure.&nbsp; I guess they weren't happy the house was moving into
strange hands.&nbsp; It wasn't too bad, but still a bit
destructive.&nbsp; Apparently my childhood escapades weren't as secret
as I'd once thought, for both my sister and my mother pulled me aside,
without the other's knowledge, and asked me to speak to the Spirits and
ask them to either move on or to stay, but to 'Please leave us
be!'&nbsp; <br>
I still miss 'Emily'.&nbsp; She used to hang about in the form of a
cat.&nbsp; Non-believers have even seen her and felt her.&nbsp; But I
know she's gone to where she belongs.&nbsp; The others?&nbsp; I don't
know.&nbsp; Maybe they're still there, in the house on Adams Street.<br>

Strange Things Have Made Me a Believer<br>
<br>
By: frankm@stx.rr.com<br>
<br>
Hi and thanks for your website...all stories should be heard as
everyone's experience is unique and unbelievable at one time or
another.&nbsp; I had never experienced anything weird until the Fall of
2003.&nbsp; But I am a believer.&nbsp; Just as God and goodness is
present; so is the Devil and evil.&nbsp; A few years ago I would have
laughed at anyone who believed they'd experienced anything supernatural
and I would have also laughed at someone "holy."&nbsp; Here's how my
story goes:&nbsp; I worked in a building that used to house the
original police station in our small city.&nbsp; My employer had leased
the building after the police department had their new facility
built.&nbsp; The building I was in still had two jail cells intact on
the uppermost floor and&nbsp; as is the case with old buildings, it
also had a lot of rubbage and dirt, etc.&nbsp; We were only allowed on
the bottom floors anyway so this floor was seldom entered or
disturbed.&nbsp; Many, many nights I worked past my 5:30 p.m.
schedule.&nbsp; I often stayed until 7 pm or so.&nbsp; During that
time, the cleaning people would come in (a young married couple and the
father-n-law).&nbsp; I always heard the cleaning, the doors opening and
closing, chairs moving, etc. during that time of the evening.&nbsp; It
wasn't until one evening that I happened to look out my office door to
ask if anyone wanted a soda as I was going to the soda machine, when I
looked out my door, I noticed there was no one in the hallway.&nbsp; I
walked down the aisle around behind my office and it was dark...it
turns out that the cleaning people worked on the top floor offices and
made their way down.&nbsp; The noises I heard, they said, were not made
by them.&nbsp; Needless to say, I ignored the noises from that moment
on but I did make sure not to stay late any longer unless it was
necessary.&nbsp; Later that Fall I found out that on the basement
floor, there was a co-worker who had indeed seen the apparition of a
drunken man jailed many years earlier who had apparently died in the
jail cell.&nbsp; She was quoted as having seen the apparition on more
than one occasion and that he seemed scary but playful.&nbsp; Well the
first and last time I worked on a Saturday in the building I heard a
co-worker in the office behind mine...she was turning on and off her
radio, opening her desk drawer looking for something she couldn't find
and was constanting moving her chair.&nbsp; I got up to let her know I
was present in the building as I had been told there would only be five
of us that day.&nbsp; I turned the corner down the hallway and found it
to be dark; no office lights, no sounds; no co-worker.&nbsp; I went
back to my office wondering "what the heck?"&nbsp; I phoned the
supervisor who had also come in that day to tell her the co-worker had
apparently left.&nbsp; She then proceeded to tell me that there werre
only three people in the building at that moment including the two of
us and another co-worker working in the office across hers.&nbsp; She
told me that it was impossible that anyone else could have come in
without her knowing as the alarm had been set after we entered
that&nbsp; morning.&nbsp; I could not believe my ears.&nbsp; I&nbsp;
immediately became frightened and realized that my office was directly
below the jail cell where it had also been rumored that a jailed man
had hung himself decades earlier.&nbsp; I never stayed late again nor
did I ever work on weekend again.&nbsp; Soon afterwards I changed
positions so I left that building and I haven't been back since.&nbsp;
Do I believe what I heard was supernatural?&nbsp; yes.&nbsp; I happen
to be a Catholic with a very strong faith and try to live my life as
such every day.&nbsp; One early morning in the Fall of 2005, I was
praying with great intensity the rosary...it must have been about 5:30
a.m. or so.&nbsp; Behind where I was sitting, there is a bedroom with a
heavy drape in place of a door.&nbsp; My oldest daughter was asleep in
there and the light was off.&nbsp; suddenly, the drape was whipped in
such a way that it made a loud noise and right over my head, in the
crawl space in our ceiling I heard loud noises like someone was rolling
across it.&nbsp; I turned in time to see the drape stop moving...I
checked on my daughter and she was sound asleep; undisturbed.&nbsp; I
checked the other bedrooms; all was fine.&nbsp; I did not allow myself
to get scared and proceeded to recite my rosary.&nbsp; I don't know
what all this means but I do know that since my faith in God has
increased, so has the unusual experiences in this home of ours.&nbsp;
My husband has had his crucifix hanging on a double knotted leather
rope untied from his neck at least once this year.&nbsp; I have had to
wake him from nightmares in which I have heard him mumbling the Hail
Mary...he tells me those are dreams with demons in them.&nbsp; My
mother has felt someone nudging her in her sleep and something placing
a strong grip on her ankles on more than one occasion.&nbsp; This past
Friday evening, I was falling asleep on the couch while praying the
rosary when I distinctly heard the almost inaudible laughing of
something or someone evil?&nbsp; I got up and decided to ignore and
continued praying...what I didn't know was that my daughter was
experiencing frightening noises in the hotel room in Laredo, Texas that
same night.&nbsp; She was performing with an orchestra group the next
evening and had been unable to sleep that entire night.&nbsp; She told
me that she heard feet dragging on the carpet in her hotel room and
right next to her bed.&nbsp; She also heard knocking on her headboard
and glanced repeatedly at her roommates to make sure they weren't
fooling with her.&nbsp; They were sound asleep.&nbsp; She told me
started hearing the noises after she began reciting the rosary.&nbsp;
Your website allows me to overcome my fears by realizing that there is
evil out there and we all have&nbsp; find ways to protect
ourselves.&nbsp; Acknowledge the evil but don't allow it to overcome
your faith.&nbsp; thanks.<br>

White Wisp and Dark Shadow People<br>
<br>
By: minz50@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I live in an old house in Omaha , NE. The previous owner was named
Alice,She lived there after her husband died, of a fall down some very
steep stairs that go to the basement. Alice was a house keeper of one
of the local&nbsp; catholic priest, After the priest retired, he moved
in with Alice ,where she continued to be his house keeper. After a few
years Alice died in her sleep in the small bedroom right off the
kitchen, the priest had the larger one next to the living room.Alice
willed the house to the priest.<br>
The priest also all most died of a fall down these steps. He later died
of old age 1 month after I bought it. After I moved in ,I noticed
things would be moved around, there would be unexplained noises coming
from the kitchen sometimes, some times you could hear a knocking&nbsp;
sound, Sitting in the living room you can see down the hall to the
kitchen, Every once in awhile you would catch a glimpse of a white wisp
moving from the small bedroom off the kitchen into the kitchen. then on
other occasions, you could catch a glimpse of a dark shadow moving
around a corner, I have even seen both the white wisp and the dark
shadow out side near the house while I was sitting oin a covered area
next to the house. I have never been able to take a picture in this
house with out having an orb in one of the photo's, in one photo of my
girl friend on the stair to the basement, we counted over 20 orbs and
some light beans. the activity is not to regular but often enough you
notice it.<br>

Regarding Sleep Paralysis<br>
<br>
By: 'whitedaisy180@hotmail.com'<br>
<br>
I just wanted to comment and say that I have had this experience. I was <br>
laying on my back the 5 times it has happened to me. It seemed so real like <br>
I was awake. I woke up to some sort of presence around me and when I opened <br>
my eyes, I felt paralyzed. I could only breathe and move my eyes.&nbsp; I looked <br>
up towards the ceiling and saw demons flying in a circle and a couple giving <br>
me eye contact. When I attempted to scream or move, some force was holding <br>
me from doing so. As I became more afraid, I tried closing my eyes and <br>
praying to God. After repeating prayers and trying to scream and closing my <br>
eyes...some seconds after, the feeling went away. Maybe it is all <br>
psychological based on my strong faith in God that made the feeling and <br>
images disappear. I do believe it is a mystery and it was interesting to <br>
have someone relate to it.<br>

Strange Tale<br>
<br>
By: musicgrrl13@hotmail.com]<br>
<br>
<br>
When I was about five years old, my parents and I went to a
bed-and-breakfast in Sturbridge, Massachusetts. We stayed there for one
night and that night, I had a dream that a little boy had died in a
fire in that inn and he had a sister who had been badly injured.<br>
The next day, the inkeeper asked my parents how we had slept, and then
informed us that the room we were in had been reported as being haunted!<br>
My parents took a picture of me sitting on the bed in our room. Behind
me, there were two faces of a man and a boy looking into the window. We
were on the second floor, and no ladders were against the building at
all. That picture has since disappeared.<br>
That day, my mother went to a cemetery to take some pictures for a
college class. On the way out of the cemetery, she said "God bless
everyone" twice, and then she felt as though she had been pushed! She
landed on her rear, but on her foot there was a very deep cut. It
nearly turned gangrene and took several months to heal. The report that
she wrote for her class vanished, along with the pictures. To this day,
we do not know what happened to it.<br>
Eleven years after this experience, I related the dream to my mother.
She told me, "Someone wanted to see the pictures of our stay in
Sturbridge Village. His son died in a fire in the inn we stayed at."<br>
This was only my first paranormal experience.<br>

Maumee - Miami Childrens Home<br>
<br>
By: winston51862@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
I can verify the happenings form the Miami Childrens Center, due to the
fact I lived there for approximately 4 years.&nbsp; The main entrance
attic area was a favorite place to hide and there were things moved on
a daily basis.&nbsp; These were carefully placed and hidden things that
I didn't tell or show anyone.&nbsp; I have heard childrens laughter and
figured it was a child that had died there and still wanted someone to
play with.&nbsp; Not many of the kids went up there and were scared to
venture to far into basement.&nbsp; The farthest building all the way
back to the right on the river side was the "Receiving Room".&nbsp;
This was for the kids that newly arrived and not placed yet.&nbsp; We
were kept in there sometimes for over a year if there wasn't any
openings in the girls or boys halls.&nbsp; The basement was where the
washer and dryer were kept and it was a punishment to be given that
chore.&nbsp; I kind of liked the solitude and the "events" that I saw
weren't too scary.&nbsp; The only bad part ws the tunnels that led from
all the buildings under ground.&nbsp; They were attached from all the
buildings for easy transfers that didn't want to be detected or
publicly seen.&nbsp; The barred doors were kept locked on most of them
when I was there, but many times I could hear screaming down the long
dark tunnels and cries for help.&nbsp; I was kept in the teen girls
hall for over 2 years due to my situation, and saw quite a bit and
heard even more.&nbsp; Nothing bad ever happened to me from a haunting,
just in real life.&nbsp; The sensing of someone else in the room was
often, and I would just talk to them as if there was another person in
the room. (Kind of made me look crazy), but I found it comforting and
it was almost like a friend.&nbsp; There was also a barbers chair in
the basement where I would cut the pre-teen boys hair.&nbsp; There were
a few times that I went down there and heard music and the chair was
twirling around when there was nobody there.&nbsp; In another room was
something like a dentist chair.&nbsp; That room I didn't like and heard
screams every now and then when I knew that nobody was in there.
Everyone was afraid of being in that room.&nbsp; <br>
If you want more experiences,- I'd be glad to share them.<br>

My Little Ghostly Experience<br>
<br>
By: grassedecember@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
first of all, i'd like to thank those people who shared their stories
on this website. after reading some of the stories posted here by other
people, i'm much less afraid of the dark and supernatural things as i
used to be. i've always believed that there's another world beside our
own, but before, i was always quite afraid of the dark, of being alone
in any room/house - any area at all where i was by myself, so fearful
that something ghostly would appear.<br>
anyway, i'd like to share my own experience which didn't cause a lot of
fear but definitely unnatural. about 10 years ago, while i was
attending a very large, well-known public university in southern
california, i shared an apartment very close to school with 2 other
female students. this apartment was located inside a large apartment
complex at least 50 years old. one late afternoon, i was waking up from
a nap in my bedroom when i heard a couple of knocks on the door.
thinking it was one of my roomates, i just kind of waited for them to
come in, but after a while, no one came in. normally you could hear the
floor creaking if someone was walking around but i didn't remember
hearing the floor creaking at all that time. later on that evening, i
asked if any of my roommates came home around that time, and none did.
so i dismissed the incident thinking perhaps i had heard wrong.<br>
a few months later, i had a different experience in this same
apartment. one morning i was waking up from my sleep and felt i
couldn't move any part of my body. i thought i was dreaming, so i
looked around the room to validate myself. i also briefly felt afraid
as if i wasn't alone in that room. anyway, i became more scared when i
realized that both of my roommates had earlier classes and i was home
alone at that time. this lasted for what must have been a couple of
minutes. so i said a prayer in my head and was able to get up out of
bed. <br>
a few months later, i was lying on the couch in the living room in the
evening reading my book (my roommates were home this time). well, i
must have drifted off to sleep somehow because i woke up (i was laying
on my back) and saw a person on my right side with her body bent over
my abdomen but her face was turned toward my feet. i wasn't able to see
the face but she had long dark brown or reddish hair. for some reason i
was able to see only the top half of this person's body. i first
thought it was my roommate but i realized i couldn't move again. then i
somehow drifted back to sleep and woke up normally again. <br>
one of my roommates also told me that she woke up one morning and saw
the back side of a female figure take her alarm clock and walked/moved
away from her toward the door. none of us ever did anything like that
on that morning.<br>
during the time i was renting this apartment, i would occasionally go
home on the weekend to visit my parents who lived an hour away from
campus. one morning when i was home, my sister who had her own room
told me that during the previous night, she was waken by the sensation
that one end of her bed was raised. she got scared and ran toward the
door to turn on the light switch, but as hard as she tried, she
couldn't find the light switch at all. so maybe whatever it was
followed me home. but ever since i moved out of that apartment, i
stopped having those weird experiences.<br>

Victorian House<br>
<br>
By: disturbed_beth@hotmail.co.uk<br>
<br>
When I was a young child (I am now 14 years of age), I used to live in
a victorian house which housed a large bedroom upstairs whish used to
feel very cold and I never felt safe in it by myself. Lo and behold,
that was my bedroom. Lucky me.<br>
Anyone who entered by bedroom would always comment on how creepy it
was. The aura of the room was very depressing and I never liked that
house because of it. I used to be very scared of the dark and always
had to have a teddy watch the room for me, because I was scared that
''it'' was going to get me. <br>
I dont know what the ''it'' was.. but there always seemed to be a presence in the room with me.<br>
I had never heard or had a sightings/sounds of a ghost of any sort, up
untill I was about 11 years old. I was asleep one night, and did the
usual ritual of putting my teddy next to my bed to watch over for me. I
fell asleep as normal, and I awoke in the middle of the night to get a
drink, and when I looked up from my glass, I was astounded see a large
black figure (It wasnt translucent, it was solid black with no
features) stood in the corner of my room. It wasnt moving, it was just
stood there, staring. I let out a large scream and rubbed my eyes to
see if I was dreaming. But it was still there. My mum ran in, and at
that exact moment it dissapeared, it was a case of blink and you'll
miss it. The whole thing lasted about 10 seconds, but it has been
cemented in my mind since.<br>
Also, I used to hear footsteps across the hallway. The floor didnt
usually creak, but when I heard these footsteps it creaked really loud.
It was really scary, because they seemed to come towards my room and
get louder and louder.. then stop.<br>
About 6 months after the sighting of the black figure, I moved out of
that house into a more modern house and my whole mood changed. I was no
longer afraid of the dark and I didnt need a teddy to watch over me. I
didnt feel threatened anymore.<br>
A few years later (A few months ago to be exact) I told my mum about
the way I felt about my old room and the noises I used to hear. I was
shocked to hear that the previous owner of our old house had died in
the house. She didnt know which room it had happened, but I was sure it
was mine. It scared me a little, as I had always thought that it had
been my imagination.<br>
I know its not the caliber of a lot of the stories on this website
(Which, by the way, I think is amazing) but I thought id share my
''experiences''.<br>

VISIT FROM A STRANGER<br>
<br>
By: Shylock1041@cs.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
THIS EVENT HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER WHEN OUR MOTHER PASSED AWAY THIRTEEN
YEARS AGO AND IT WAS QUITE A WHILE BEFORE HE COULD FORCE HIMSELF TO
TELL ME ABOUT IT AS HE HAD TROUBLE BELIEVING IT HIMSELF.<br>
SHE PASSED AWAY JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS IN 1993 AND, IN HER WILL, SHE HAD
MADE ME EXECUTOR OF HER ESTATE. THIS WAS KNOWN BY MY BROTHER WELL
BEFORE SHE EVER GOT SICK AND MY BROTHER AGREED COMPLETELY WITH THIS
ARRANGEMENT AS WE GOT ALONG EXTREMELY WELL AND STILL DO.<br>
THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS DECIDED ON BECAUSE MY BROTHER IS A LOT MORE
SENSITIVE THAN I AM AND SHE FIGURED THAT I WOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO
HANDLE THE SITUATION. WHEN SHE PASSED, I HAD TO TEMPER MY MOURNING WITH
TENDING TO BUSINESS AND I THINK THAT THINGS WENT PRETTY WELL. THIS
BACKGROUND HAD TO BE PRINTED SO THE EVENT THAT HAPPENED MIGHT BE
EXPLAINED SOMEWHAT.<br>
MOM'S PASSING DID HIT MY BROTHER A LOT HARDER THAN IT DID ME EVEN
THOUGH IT HIT ME PLENTY HARD ALSO AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WHAT
HAPPENED HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THIS FACT.<br>
MY BROTHER DOES NOT LIVE IN THE SAME TOWN AS MOM AND I DID AND HE HAS
LIVED OVER ON THE COAST ABOUT A HUNDRED MILES FROM US FOR YEARS
(ANOTHER REASON FOR THIS BEING SO UNUSUAL). WE HAD FINISHED WITH THE
FUNERAL AND HE WENT BACK HOME WHILE I STAYED IN TOWN AND FINISHED UP
ESTATE WORK.<br>
NOW, THIS DID NOT APPEAR IN HIS HOMETOWN PAPER AND HE IS BY PERSONALITY
A BIT OF A LONER LIKE I AM SO NO ONE IN HIS AREA HAD ANY REASON TO KNOW
THAT ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAD HAPPENED.<br>
SHORTLY AFTER HE HAD GONE HOME, HE TOLD ME LATER THAT HE WAS SITTING ON
HIS FRONT PORCH DEALING WITH THE SITUATION WHEN THIS STRANGE THING
HAPPENED THAT I CANNOT EXPLAIN AWAY. <br>
HE TOLD ME YEARS LATER THAT HE WAS JUST SITTING ON HIS PORCH DEALING
WITH THE LOSS WHEN A PERFECT STRANGER THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
WALKED UP TO HIM (DIDN'T EVEN INTRODUCE HIMSELF) AND TOLD MY BROTHER
NOT TO GRIEVE TO MUCH THAT HIS MOTHER WAS WITH HIS DAD AGAIN AND WAS
EXTREMELY HAPPY AND SHE DIDN'T WANT HIM TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME GRIEVING
ABOUT HER.<br>
AFTER TELLING HIM THIS, HE JUST TURNED AROUND AND WALKED AWAY AND MY
BROTHER TOLD ME THAT HE HAS NEVER SEEN HIM AGAIN. WHEN YOU STOP TO
THINK ABOUT THIS, IT BOGGLES THE MIND TO THINK THAT ANYONE IN HIS TOWN
WOULD EVEN KNOW THIS BECAUSE HE HADN'T EVEN TOLD HIS CLOSEST FRIENDS
WHAT HAD HAPPENED YET.<br>
WE HAVE DISCUSSED THIS AT LENGTH AND HE SWEARS THAT THERE WAS NO WAY
THAT THIS STRANGER COULD HAVE POSSIBLY KNOWN OF MOM'S DEMISE MUCH LESS
WALKING UP AND TELLING HIM WHAT HE DID.<br>
HE FINALLY TOLD ME THAT HE FEELS THAT MOM KNEW THAT HE WAS MUCH MORE
SENSITIVE THAN I WAS AND SHE FOUND A WAY TO KEEP HIM FROM SINKING TOO
FAR INTO GRIEF AND DOING SOMETHING DRASTIC.<br>
I WILL ACCEPT THIS UNTIL SOMEONE CAN GIVE ME A BETTER EXPLANATION, NO MATTER HOW UNUSUAL IT IS.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Ghosts<br>
<br>
By: CSch210529@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Chico California, we lived in a rental.&nbsp; After we went to bed
maybe 5mins the T.V turned on full blast and then it turned down to
low.&nbsp; We heard heavy foot steps going through the house.&nbsp; My
husband jumped up at that time and checked the doors, they were locked,
the windows were locked and the kids were in bed.&nbsp; At that time
the ash tray was knocked over on the floor.&nbsp; No one in the house.<br>
Two nights later the shower turned on, NO ONE in the bathroom. <br>
We have always had ghosts in our home, this was normal and we learn to live with them. I have all kinds of stories of ghosts. <br>

My Ghostly Experience<br>
<br>
<br>
By: PATGANDA@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
It was back in the Philippines.&nbsp; I was in my early teens.&nbsp; I
now reside in West Palm Beach, Florida and I am now in my early
thirties.&nbsp; Anyway, I shared a room and a bed with my older
brother.&nbsp; Our bed was positioned that one side was against the
wall.&nbsp; Of course, my brother who was also a scaredy cat used to
tell me that ghosts would come out of the wall to get me.&nbsp; My
siblings and I love to scare each other lol!&nbsp; I believed him so I
slept on the outer side of the bed.&nbsp; As scared as I was I sure
didn't want some ghost grabbing me through the wall!!&nbsp; It was late
night and we were all in bed.&nbsp; My house had three bedrooms.&nbsp;
The middle room was my parent's.&nbsp; I had to put this in so you
would know why this is sorta important to the story.&nbsp; My room and
my brother is the only room with a bathroom so the other two rooms had
to go out to the second bathroom.&nbsp; To go back to my story, I woke
up and saw this huge man staring at me.&nbsp; He was so big that he
pretty much covered the whole door.&nbsp; We always had the door
open.&nbsp; I tried to scream but not even a whisper came out of my
mouth.&nbsp; I tried to move but my whole body seemed to be paralyzed
(with fear???)&nbsp; I was struggling to do whatever to wake up my
brother.&nbsp; That huge thing standing by the door just kept staring
at me.&nbsp; I couldn't see any eyes just a black shadow or maybe
because he was standing in the dark and he had no features.&nbsp; All
the sudden, I heard my&nbsp; parents' door open.&nbsp; My dad had to
use to bathroom.&nbsp; As soon as I heard my dad, the thing just
disappeared.&nbsp; I was so scared that I grabbed my blanket and just
slept through the night.&nbsp; The next morning I told my siblings
about it and they all just laughed.&nbsp; I swear that it was real but
I could be wrong.&nbsp; I did hear my dad.&nbsp; The second experience
was with my older sister.&nbsp; This happened in their room.&nbsp; At
this time, I already left for the States.&nbsp; She woke up and had
this transparent lady crying to her.&nbsp; The lady kept telling her
that my sister was her daughter.&nbsp; My sister kept telling her no
you are not.&nbsp; I didn't really get the whole story from my sister
but she did say after her experience that they had a priest come by and
bless the house.&nbsp; We had a neighbor who lived in the area before
they developed it.&nbsp; They said that the area had always been a very
scary place until houses were built on it.<br>

My House was Haunted<br>
<br>

<br>
I grew up in Valley Forge Subdivision from 1978 to 1996.&nbsp; It was
not until later in the my residency that my mother welcomed a spirit
into the house.&nbsp; One morning she heard a knock at the door so she
went to see who it was, naturally.&nbsp; Upon her surprise there was no
one there.&nbsp; She thought it was her imagination so she went on with
her morning routine.&nbsp; Very shortly after this she heard the knock
again and again she checked the front door only to find no one
again.&nbsp; She proceeded to check the other entrances thinking they
were at another door and still found nothing.&nbsp; Since she believes
in life after death she said the spirit could come in, but it was not
to hurt any one.&nbsp; She then sat down to drink her morning coffee
and the basement door opened.&nbsp; Now the door closes when the heat
comes on, but it never opens by itself.<br>
After this event I would always see things out of the corner of my
eye.&nbsp; It was if someone walked by a doorway or opening and you
only saw it with your peripheral vision.&nbsp; I always thought I was
seeing things, but several of my friends, who knew nothing of the
incident with my mother, saw the same thing I did.&nbsp; I never felt
fearful of the presence, because we felt it was the spirit of my
grandfather watching over us.<br>

A Haunted House in Garden Grove California and one in Hawaii<br>
<br>

I was a child (4-5 years old) when these events occurred. <br>
1.. Every night, we would hear running up and down the halls <br>
2.. My sister (6 years old) used to sleep walk. She would get up and my
mom and dad would pick her up and put her back in bed. One night, my
parents heard noises in the living room. They get up and see my sister
walking toward the refrigerator. They walk over to pick her up and she
vanishes. They were all freaked out. They ran to my sisters&#8217; room, and
she was sound asleep. <br>
3.. One Sunday afternoon my mom and grandma were resting in the
bedroom. They hear the voice of a man in the living room and a child
crying. My mother, startled, ran out to the living room and said &#8220;who
are you and what the hell are you doing in my house???&#8221; The man turned
to her and asked, &#8220;Have you seen Martha?&#8221; My mom said &#8220;NO! What are you
doing in here??&#8221; He and the boy walked into the wall and vanished. <br>
4.. One another night, my parents were woken up by a sound In the
bathroom. During the 70&#8217;s, (no laughing!) we had decorative beads on
the outside of the shower curtain. On this night the beads were
swooshing violently back and forth. Half-asleep, my parents stood there
and stared at it. My mom then pushed past it to close the window which,
of course, was already closed. My parents decided it was time to move.
Me moved to Hawaii to&#8230;. You guessed it, another haunted house!!! <br>
I was 10-12 when these events occurred: <br>
1.. Every night, I would hear knocking on the walls. No joke. Three
knocks in perfect succession. No believed me at first because no on
else heard it. I heard it for two years!! I had a friend sleep over who
finally heard it. We had the house blessed three times after that.
Still had the knocks though. <br>
2.. I get home from fishing on day to see my mom sitting at the table.
She said that she wanted to talk to me. She told me that she met a
&#8220;woman&#8221; who was living in our house. She say it was a Hawaiian woman
who long ago owned the land we live on. She said that she is happy that
we are living there, taking care of the property and land (I had helped
plant every fruit tree imaginable). She also apologized for the
knocking. She said that she was asking permission to &#8220;enter&#8221;. The
knocks stop. To this day I sleep with the TV on&#8230;.. <br>
Side note, since your side has no stories about the Hawaiian Island of Kauai: <br>
3.. In Hawaii, (Kauai High School to be exact) Our high school gym was
completely haunted. We would leave the school from practice and hear
basketballs bouncing, lights flickering on and off, screams of fans,
etc&#8230; One time we saw a car drive by with all of the doors opening and
closing and no one in it. Seriously. <br>
4.. The Tree Tunnel: Located on the way to Koloa, a tunnel lined with
trees, about two miles long. The trees meet at the top to form a
tunnel. My best friends mother was driving through it late and night
when her van konks out. She had meat in the van (steaks and whatnot).
The legend has it that an offering must be made. She took a piece of
steak, through it out there, van started and she was on her way. <br>
5.. Woman in the white dress: hitchhiker killed in the same tree
tunnel. She is seen hitchhiking and about &frac12; mile away she is
seen again. <br>
I hope this is published for all to enjoy.<br>

Bloody Knuckles<br>
<br>
By: midwestmusic@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
When my daughter was about 14 she slept in the room adjacent to mine,
head boards would be against each other separated by a wall. If there
were any screaming or pounding I would have heard it, so I thought. She
woke in the morning with bloody knuckles and a sore throat from as she
says screaming all night and pounding and clawing at the spirits that
were holding her down in her bed while a small figure perched at the
foot of the bed. She is or never was one for exaggeration and is a
straight forward thinking logical person. Very intelligent, I mean
every award including state awards for the highest grade point average
and the academic achievement award as well, so you see not one that
would dream this and not even admit to it.&nbsp; I believe because I
saw her hands and heard her voice. She was terrorized all night by
several spirits while one rather small and mangled creature watched in
a guard like stance. We changed rooms with her that day. Later in life
she dated a man who she would call husband now. He drew all kinds of
things, one in which he showed her in a book of his work, he said he
saw this creature when he was younger on his bed and he was frightened
of it so badly he felt compelled to draw it. It was a demon he said.
This was the same in every way that she had described to me what was
perched on the foot of her bed. Happenstance?&nbsp; My husband
experienced a rise off the bed and a hard drop, the orb shooting
through his body and the sonic boom he heard was enough to move into
another bedroom and close the room off permanently! But that's another
story, isn't it.&nbsp; <br>

Boyne City, MI<br>

At the end of Leroy street is formally beautiful home not falling into
disrepair. When I first&nbsp; first moved here I used to take my dog
for a daily walk. The house fascinated me and since it appeared to be
deserted I began to snoop. I was soon surprised by a young girl in a
yellow dress looking out of the upstairs window at me. I quickly left.
I later found out that indeed it is deserted but that a young girl had
died there years earlier. I have heard other stories about strange
noises and relatives that would not spend the night when the house was
still occupied. A ladder still sits against the roof where someone
started to re shingle the place and was frightened away. I still drive
by and am saddened as it falls further into disrepair but I no longer
trespass.<br>

Ghost Experiences<br>
<br>
By: maryherbst@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Here are some ghostly events my family had experienced in Sweden. Excuse me for my defective English; it&#8217;s not my native langue!<br>
One night about ten years ago we were on our way home from our grandparents.<br>
My father drove the car. We were just little children at the time. Both
we and our mother slept. My father was the only awake. He drove on the
way past a Manor house. It is really creepy there after the twilight.<br>
Suddenly he saw something over the edge of a ditch. It was dark at that
time, but he had the car lights on. He saw a strange figure with a
monk&#8217;s cowl, dancing around about twenty centimetres over the ditch. My
father got frightened, the figure just looked strange and unnatural,
and it floated over the ground. It just went on spinning while he was
driving.<br>
A couple of year&#8217;s lather we found out that there had been a monk &#8211;
monastery at that place. Evidently the place is haunted by much
different kind of ghosts, like children, monks and even animals.<br>
Both me and my mother works at an old people's home. Many people have
been experience strange things here. For example, one of our work &#8211;
mate have seen the shadow of a man with his arms raised to the roof.
The emergency alarm has started in an empty, looked room.<br>
I have seen something flickering, like transparent see-through fabric,
float in a corridor. My mother has seen a shadow running in the
corridor, and her hair raised (?) in the back of her neck. It&#8217;s
happening especially in the nights.<br>
This is some of the real things that we had experience. Thank u for an interesting page!<br>

House in Nottinghamshore England<br>
<br>
<br>

hi, i've been reading the stories on your website for a while now, and
i thought i'd share my own story about the house i'm shortly moving out
of.<br>
i moved into my friend's house at the start of the summer, when she
left to work in spain for a while.&nbsp; the house is a typical english
terrace, nothing to make it any different from the others on the
street.&nbsp; i've known my friend for 6 years and know the about the
spirit, and have house sat for her before, but nothing like as long as
this time.<br>
two nights after i moved in (my friend had left for spain on the
sunday), i was sat watching tv.&nbsp; it was just starting to get dark,
and i had thoughts of putting the light on, when a picture of chief
sitting bull (my friend is mad on american indians) slid down the wall,
which made me jump. i got up to hang the picture back up, but i got a
shock, as the nail was still in the wall.&nbsp; i've heard the sound of
footsteps upstairs, when i'm the only person in the house.&nbsp; one
time a friend came to visit, and i don't think the spirit liked her, as
there were lots of bangs and crashes, the sound of someone stomping
heavily on the stairs, and the handle on the stairs door was jumping up
and down like mad.&nbsp; that's a regular occurance but not as violent
as that! needless to say, my friend declined to stay the night.&nbsp; a
couple of weekends ago a friend i haven't seen for a while came to
stay... i told her about the disturbances and offered my bed up but she
said she was fine on the sofa.<br>
i came downstairs the next morning, and asked how she'd slept.&nbsp;
she sat up and said 'i know you said there was a little girl here but
you didn't say her family was, too!' my friend heard lots of movement
in the night, people walking up and down stairs, and through the living
room.<br>
my friend, whose house it is, told me that there is the spirit of a
little girl there.&nbsp; she obviously doesn't mind me, as the only
disturbances i've experienced are the door handle and steps on the
stairs, but i won't miss the attic bedroom; it petrifies me when i have
to walk up there in the middle of the night!<br>

The Black and White Cat<br>
<br>
By: tarrios@gmail.com<br>
<br>
<br>
The whole family was playing around in bed telling silly stories before
bed time one night. My five year old daughter started to tell us a
story. She said "the kids at school all saw a cat get hit by a bus". I
gasped and said "did you see it" she said <br>
"no!" then started to laugh. I got quite mad that her teacher did not
write a note saying the cat had been hit and the kids saw it in our
parent teacher notebook. I still was curious why my daughter had said
this so as we lay in bed. I ask "what did the kitty look like? what
color was it?" She laughed and said "black and white". Then giggles
"Just kidding!". I ask again "did you see the cat at the school" and
she said "no". I drifted off to sleep quite disturbed about the image
of kids seeing a cat get hit by a school bus. <br>
Then two or so months went by uneventful. No talks of cats being hit by
buses just of new friends at school. I wake up to get our daughter
ready for school for my husband to drive her the short distance to the
school before work. I give her kisses and say goodbye. I honestly
usually crawl back in bed for a couple more hours after she heads out
to school. But, today I saw that it was trash day and I had some to put
out before they came. I was going to leave it for my husband to bring
out when he returned from the school to take his work van. <br>
I said "oh I will just do it". I walked outside and bring the trash
out. I picked up a bottle that someone had thrown on the curb of our
very busy street. Then on walking up my driveway I see a black and
white cat. He is a good looking healthy cat with big eyes. He is just
staring at me and not moving sitting up looking at me. I walk closer
and say "hello", and closer "I hope they did not leave you behind. The
family next door moved the weekend before. I had never seen this cat
however in the months they lived there. I say "I hope they did not
leave you behind". The cat is still just staring at me not moving an
inch. I say to myself "oh, well" and walk inside my house. <br>
I shut the door and think. "well, I better call animal control because
he is just going to get hit with that street outside". My husband pulls
into the driveway a few minutes later. I say "I think the people who
moved left a cat". My husband and I walk outside so I can show him
this&nbsp; cat. <br>
We look all over and can not find him. He honestly had no place to go
in that short time except my yard. The street too busy with morning
commuters for the animal to try to cross. Then a fence he would have to
climb. <br>
Then my husband said "well, I saw a cat dead in the road on 10th
street." I think how horrible and ask "what color?" He said "it was
black and white". I ask "more black or more white?" he said "more
white". I think "oh, this one was more black". He said "Well, I was
driving the car and it was in the road!". <br>
We head inside after looking for a couple minutes. I then say to my
husband about our daughter talking about a black and white cat getting
hit by a bus and how it was weird she joked of such a thing. <br>
I talk about how my Grandmother saw auras and was quite odd and maybe
our daughter had a vision. I suggest the idea it was a ghost cat! He
said "maybe". Then I went on to say how it did not move or even blink
and had a strange look to its eyes like it was staring at me. Maybe
perhaps from another world the animal was looking at me from. <br>
The as I kiss my husband goodbye for the day. I say "hey if you see
that cat there just tell me" as he walks to the van. He then did
something odd. He walked around the side of the house and got in his
van. I think he too thought it strange and just wanted to be sure. <br>
The things small children say are innocent and have meaning. My
daughter never talked of morbid things and made jokes of it. She did
tell of a black and white cat getting hit by a bus. Then months later a
black and white cat visits me then disappears in just minutes later
with no trace in almost impossible time. The same day my husband sees a
black and white dead cat in the road just up the street. I will never
know if today I was visited by a ghost cat that my daughter talked
about. <br>
