<b><font size=+1>Investigations Do Help!</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: angelsoft_2@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have recently been in contact with the Utah Ghost</b>
<br><b>Hunters who did an investigation in my home in January</b>
<br><b>and February '00(this year). The results were quite</b>
<br><b>alarming(to myself only!) which is one reason why it</b>
<br><b>took me so long to get help. 1. The actual reality</b>
<br><b>that i wasnt losing my mind. 2. actually having proof</b>
<br><b>of their existence.(which i have 1 evp sample of a</b>
<br><b>little boy i will attach to this..the rest can now be</b>
<br><b>seen under the Ughs home page under EVP's and then</b>
<br><b>*what do you hear?*</b>
<br><b>anyhow let me tell you the story which brought me to</b>
<br><b>seek help.</b><b></b>
<p><b>In December of '97 i purchased a brand new mobile</b>
<br><b>home, picked out everything down to the colors. It was</b>
<br><b>then moved onto a mobile home lot in Sandy, Utah. At</b>
<br><b>the time it was my son Austin, my boyfriend</b>
<br><b>Brandon(also my sons father), and myself. I never</b>
<br><b>thought anything of the occurances. Just bypassed them</b>
<br><b>as stupidity on my part or what have you. My son until</b>
<br><b>we moved in..used to sleep through the night...now</b>
<br><b>even today..2 years later..he still wakes up at least</b>
<br><b>once a night. About two months after moving in...my</b>
<br><b>son let out a blood hurdling scream, not uncommon at</b>
<br><b>this point since moving into this home..but i of</b>
<br><b>course got up and went down to his room(which is on</b>
<br><b>the opposite end of the home from my own bedroom)to</b>
<br><b>see what i could do to calm him down. When i walked in</b>
<br><b>Austin(who was still in his crib at 20 months old) was</b>
<br><b>upside down like somebody was holding him by the</b>
<br><b>feet..and when i came in..he like dropped down to the</b>
<br><b>mattress making a banging sound with his feet on the</b>
<br><b>side rail..I took it as sleeplessness on my part and</b>
<br><b>asked him what was wrong....he stood up and pointed to</b>
<br><b>the corner of the room..and said..*that man scared me</b>
<br><b>mom*..i said..*you see a man austin*..and he shook his</b>
<br><b>head yes..i said..*what man austin?*..he pointed a</b>
<br><b>little sterner to the corner..and said..*there momma*.</b>
<br><b>I looked around for anything such as a shadow from the</b>
<br><b>nighty light or anything of that which would portray a</b>
<br><b>man to an almost 2 year old..but couldnt see</b>
<br><b>anything...and so i said..*is it a nice man?* and he</b>
<br><b>said.*yes*..and so i jokingly said...(not convinced he</b>
<br><b>might actually be seeing something..but maybe had woke</b>
<br><b>from a strange dream)but i said..*well tell the nice</b>
<br><b>man to leave you alone so you can go back to</b>
<br><b>sleep*..and all was well...any events up to this next</b>
<br><b>one..i must have just bypassed and cant remember...but</b>
<br><b>the next one is what got me to thinking i may need</b>
<br><b>help!..it was about a year later...Brandon and i had</b>
<br><b>seperated..i stayed in the home that was in my name</b>
<br><b>with our son in my custody..who was going on 3 at this</b>
<br><b>time. One night i had the tv on, but was sitting with</b>
<br><b>austin reading him a book when out of the blue he</b>
<br><b>points to the other couch and says..*mom..whats that</b>
<br><b>man doing?*..and i said..*what man austin?*..he</b>
<br><b>said..*that man on the couch mom*..i said..*i dont</b>
<br><b>know austin..what does it look like he's doing?*</b>
<br><b>austin got a big smile on his face(possibly because he</b>
<br><b>saw the terrified look on mine!!) and said..*its okay</b>
<br><b>mom, he's a nice man...he's just watching tv with</b>
<br><b>us!*...at this..i rose from the couch and ran into my</b>
<br><b>bedroom to use the only other phone besides the one</b>
<br><b>next to the man on the couch...and called Brandon..and</b>
<br><b>told him the story of the man on the couch..and just</b>
<br><b>then i smelled a burning smell of that like a pan on</b>
<br><b>the stove without anything in it..a metallic smell of</b>
<br><b>some sort...i yelled into the phone..*oh</b>
<br><b>god..somethings on fire..i gotta let you go*..and hung</b>
<br><b>up. With this..Austin started bauling thinking there</b>
<br><b>was a fire..i was frantically searching the home for a</b>
<br><b>vacinity of the fire..but couldnt smell anything until</b>
<br><b>i went back into my bedroom next to the phone where</b>
<br><b>infact the smell was as strong there as if i myself</b>
<br><b>had burnt something right in my room. At that point</b>
<br><b>Brandon was knocking at the door, scared something was</b>
<br><b>wrong cause i had just hung up on him!..and nothing</b>
<br><b>else occured that night. I had forgotten this episode</b>
<br><b>as well...(most likely the skeptic in me not wanting</b>
<br><b>to believe)until last september..when one day i was at</b>
<br><b>home..austin was outside playing when i smelled a gas</b>
<br><b>smell. This not unusual in my gas appliance furnished</b>
<br><b>home..but in checking everything..all pilots were lit.</b>
<br><b>i even went as far as calling my father to be sure i</b>
<br><b>hadnt missed anything..he couldnt think of anything</b>
<br><b>but told me to go out and get some fresh air. so i</b>
<br><b>did..and sure enough when i came back in..it was gone.</b>
<br><b>i started noticing things after this. Austins vcr</b>
<br><b>playing a tape when i know i had shut it off that</b>
<br><b>night when i checked on him. someone walking up the</b>
<br><b>steps of my front porch..but after a moment no one</b>
<br><b>knocks..ill go look..and there is no one there. My</b>
<br><b>curling iron plugged in when i hadnt even used it that</b>
<br><b>day. lights on when i get home..knowing when i left i</b>
<br><b>was in fear of burglars because i hadnt left a light</b>
<br><b>on to show someone might be home. Cupboard banging in</b>
<br><b>the night..which i had blamed my cats up until the</b>
<br><b>night i went to kick some kitty butt, climbed out of</b>
<br><b>bed and noticed both cats sleeping at my feet, (i of</b>
<br><b>course being the coward crawled right back into bed</b>
<br><b>and held my eyes shut!)My cats watch something all the</b>
<br><b>time now that we cant see..and in fact climbing at the</b>
<br><b>top of places to chase something. My son came running</b>
<br><b>out of his room just a couple weeks ago stating a</b>
<br><b>monster had knocked his puzzle off his dresser and</b>
<br><b>noting at the end of his frantic statement..*that it</b>
<br><b>wasnt the cats*.&nbsp; Just after the first investigation</b>
<br><b>with UGH...i had not yet heard from them of the</b>
<br><b>results. And one night i awoke to austin in my</b>
<br><b>bed(which at this point is not uncommon!)..but when i</b>
<br><b>looked past my bedroom door i saw the silhouette of</b>
<br><b>young boy...i would guess around the age of 9 or 10.</b>
<br><b>just standing by my washer and dryer. i looked closer</b>
<br><b>and he was gone. i emailed the UGH at this</b>
<br><b>sighting..and they responded with something</b>
<br><b>like...*this makes perfect sense to us now.. seeing as</b>
<br><b>we caught the voice of a little boy on evp the night</b>
<br><b>of the investigation asking about his daddy*..(mind</b>
<br><b>you...after this email..it took alot for me to even</b>
<br><b>step foot in my home...but it finally was adding up to</b>
<br><b>why my son thought this spirit was a monster... maybe</b>
<br><b>because all i saw was a black figure the size of a</b>
<br><b>small boy..this could be all Austin is seeing too and</b>
<br><b>can only recognize him as a monster!) anyhow..not long</b>
<br><b>after this..austin was tucked nicely in bed and came</b>
<br><b>walking calmly to my side of the bed and said..*mom</b>
<br><b>can i sleep with you* i said *sure, why?*..he said..*i</b>
<br><b>just saw that monster that knocked my puzzle off</b>
<br><b>walking in the living room*. i have since tried to</b>
<br><b>place rules in my house..one in which i am happy</b>
<br><b>they(i can say they since the investigation has</b>
<br><b>brought up at least 2..that of a man, and a boy)are</b>
<br><b>responding to which is having the tv off when i return</b>
<br><b>home. I got sooo sick of coming home and finding my</b>
<br><b>sons tv on knowing i had turned it off..that one day</b>
<br><b>while i was turning it off..(yes..this has gotten to</b>
<br><b>be strange even for me to be speaking to empty air in</b>
<br><b>my home!)i firmly said...*If your going to watch tv</b>
<br><b>while im away i would appreciate it if it was off by</b>
<br><b>the time i got home* It hasn't been on a single time</b>
<br><b>since then! Other than that there are small occurance</b>
<br><b>that i just bypass now. My only complaint is they will</b>
<br><b>not let my son sleep through the night and i am at a</b>
<br><b>loss as to how to get this one accomplished. Anyhow,</b>
<br><b>thanks for listening to my *life* as i know it today.</b>
<br><b>if you have any suggestions that might allow my</b>
<br><b>son..(who might i add has not heard me talk of any of</b>
<br><b>this..so i know he isnt making anything he sees</b>
<br><b>up..*he knows not to lie to mom!*..and he is also an</b>
<br><b>avid disney channel watcher..so as i know for a fact</b>
<br><b>his screams in the night are not of nightmares from</b>
<br><b>some horror flick!)some relief during the night..i</b>
<br><b>would really appreciate it! again..thanks for</b>
<br><b>listening.</b><b></b>

<br><b><font size=+1>Incident</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: snip_4@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; My name is Brianna Boord.&nbsp; I live in a small town in
southwestern PA,</b>
<br><b>right along the Monongahela River.&nbsp; The town is called Greensboro.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>experience with the paranormal occurred last fall.&nbsp; Actually,
it occurred</b>
<br><b>over the past year or two but my real proof came in the fall.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; My grandparents own a grocery store here in town.&nbsp;
The building is a</b>
<br><b>piece of history in itself, an old movie theater built the early
1900s.</b>
<br><b>There is an inscription in front of the building that reads "Davis
Theater</b>
<br><b>1924". IT is so fascinating inside! The ceilings are tin, and there
are</b>
<br><b>moldings along every crease.&nbsp; My grandfather, quite tight in
the purse</b>
<br><b>strings, never renovated the building and was never one for repairs
or</b>
<br><b>upkeep.&nbsp; Everything in the building is pretty much original.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the late eighties, a fire occurred in one of the
two apartments above</b>
<br><b>the store.&nbsp; It had to be remodeled, and it was the only part
of the building</b>
<br><b>ever to be so.&nbsp; No one died or was harmed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The first incident occurred in the summer of 1997.&nbsp;
It was around 11:30</b>
<br><b>at night, and my friend came to my house saying that all the lights
were on</b>
<br><b>in the store.&nbsp; Sure enough, when I walked up with her to look
around, every</b>
<br><b>light in the bottom&nbsp; of the building had been switched on.&nbsp;
Now, the lights</b>
<br><b>aren't turned on by a switch; they are turned on and off right from
a</b>
<br><b>breaker box behind the store's counter.&nbsp; Not only were the
ceiling lights</b>
<br><b>on, all the porch lights and lights in the back part of the building
that</b>
<br><b>aren't normally used were on.&nbsp; It was almost as if someone
had gone and</b>
<br><b>switched every breaker in the box on. As you probably know, it lakes
a light</b>
<br><b>force of the finger to flip one of those switches!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; About a year later, my friends and I began to work
in the store for my</b>
<br><b>grandparents while my pap was ill.&nbsp; On several occasions, with
several</b>
<br><b>different people, things randomly fell off of shelves before the
people</b>
<br><b>would walk past.&nbsp; One time a fan turned on by itself.&nbsp;
Bread would slide off</b>
<br><b>of perfectly level shelves when no one was even beside it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The most recent incident occurred in the fall.&nbsp;
Some not-so-clean people</b>
<br><b>were living in the renovated apartment upstairs and had just moved
out.</b>
<br><b>They had totally destroyed the place, leaving behind a filthy mess.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>boyfriend and I decided to go up and photograph the damage and mess,
taking</b>
<br><b>pictures of every room.&nbsp; Now, the apartment's windows are in
the front of</b>
<br><b>the building which faces the east.&nbsp; The pictures were taken
at around seven</b>
<br><b>at night, so there was no sunlight coming in.&nbsp; The apartment
has no</b>
<br><b>electricity, hence no lights.&nbsp; My boyfriend and I were not
smoking.&nbsp; When</b>
<br><b>the pictures developed, we noticed white swirls in the pictures
taken in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen.&nbsp; I have the pictures and would very much like to mail
them to you</b>
<br><b>but am having trouble doing so.&nbsp; I have four pictures with
the white mist in</b>
<br><b>them.&nbsp; Actually, it was around Halloween that they were taken.&nbsp;
My mother</b>
<br><b>was browsing ghost stories on the internet and came onto your website.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>looked at the pictures you have posted, and later that week I got
my</b>
<br><b>pictures of the store back.&nbsp; I nearly fainted when I recognized
the white</b>
<br><b>shadows&nbsp; in the pictures!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The old building is quite eerie.&nbsp; It is old and full
of history.&nbsp; This</b>
<br><b>whole town is actually.&nbsp; A small historic location, there arent
more than</b>
<br><b>200 people living here.&nbsp; I think my pictures are worth looking
at.&nbsp; I have</b>
<br><b>scanned the photos into the computer and are in my PaperPort program
now.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>don't know how to attach them to an email.&nbsp; If you would like,
email me back</b>
<br><b>with info on how to send them to you, and ask anything you would
like to</b>
<br><b>know.</b><b></b>

<br><b><font size=+1>Mother-in-law</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: HIAWATHA38@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My aunt Maudeen was a second mother to me. I was with her when she
met her</b>
<br><b>future daughter-inlaw for the first time. She extended her hand
and said</b>
<br><b>"pleased to meet you Brenda". Brenda was my cousins ex-girlfriend.
That was</b>
<br><b>in 1971.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Aunt Maudeen did not recieve women marrying into the family with
open arms</b>
<br><b>including my mother and my wife but she was consumed with hatred
for her</b>
<br><b>daughter -inlaw. I don't believe that anyone knew the magnitude
of this</b>
<br><b>hatred better than I.</b><b></b>
<p><b>She was found dead in her home in Jan. of "87". Several of us family
members</b>
<br><b>were gathered in the living room of her home prior to the funeral
when my</b>
<br><b>cousin's wife pointed to a large and expensive painting above the
sofa. She</b>
<br><b>said "I've always liked that painting. I think I'll take it home."
At that</b>
<br><b>precise moment, a hook supporting the painting popped out causing
the</b>
<br><b>painting to hang to one side. She promptly changed her mind.</b><b></b>

<p><b>I was 15 at the time i lived in a shed by myself my mother was building
a</b>
<br><b>house and she lived in a caravan with my younger brother.</b>

<br><b>I just jumped into bed i layed there having my last smoke for the
night i</b>
<br><b>put it out in the ashtray that was next tp my bed(i had a chair
with</b>
<br><b>crystals my stereo etc....). I laid there for about five minutes
when some</b>
<br><b>thing lifted me up with unseen hands about three foot in the air
and dropped</b>
<br><b>me&nbsp; on to the chair next to my bed i was scared at first because
i had never</b>
<br><b>experienced any thing like this before i felt the pain i seen then
blood and</b>
<br><b>seenj the bruises i wasen't bleeding bad they were mainly scratches
and</b>
<br><b>bruises my boyfriend seen it my freinds seen it.</b>
<br><b>my mother didn't believe me ,my dad asked me what i was smoking
i "said</b>
<br><b>nothing"then he believed me.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My other experience was when i went to my nans( she only live 2 horse</b>
<br><b>paddocks away) so we used the bush track to walk to her house and
back the</b>
<br><b>same way.</b>
<br><b>i was walking home i got to the fence post that devided her property
from</b>
<br><b>ours i felt that eerie feeling you get when some ones watching that
you cant</b>
<br><b>see then i seen it it was a white misty figure that looked like
the grim</b>
<br><b>reaper( except without that sort of hookie thing it holds )it was
beautiful</b>
<br><b>but i thought it was my mum trying to scare me so i called out mum
ya dont</b>
<br><b>scare me after getting sick of saying this i thought maybe if i
swear she</b>
<br><b>will give herself away but after cursing to my hearts to content

feet i</b>
<br><b>watched leave it crossed my path it walked through a fence and disapearred</b>

<br><b><font size=+1>Ghost experence in garage</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: captnmac@impop.bellatlantic.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I searched on the interent and found your site and I</b>
<br><b>have to tell you about what happened to my friends and I this pase</b>
<br><b>weekend. On Friday, myself, my friend Dave (15yrs), my rother Kyle</b>
<br><b>(12yrs), his friend Joe (10yrs), and my friend Andy(15yrs) went
into the</b>
<br><b>garage attic to tell ghosts stories like we did all summer. Everything</b>
<br><b>started out fine and my friend Dave started to tell the story. Rate</b>
<br><b>after his opening of the story, the thing we used to stick in the
window</b>
<br><b>to block the light to make it pitch black inside fell. The thing
we used</b>
<br><b>is named drop ceilng panels and it feel really weird out of the
window.</b>
<br><b>It came out of the window, fell straight down and then feel to it's</b>
<br><b>side. Now this may seem to be nothing but there is much more to
tell. We</b>
<br><b>fixed the window and Dave continued with the story. Dave was rate
in the</b>
<br><b>middle of the story when I interrupted him and said "What is that?",
so</b>
<br><b>we turned on one of the flashlights and Andy goes, "What the red</b>
<br><b>light."and I go "No the Blue One." than everyone started talking
and</b>
<br><b>Andy and Dave said the both saw a little red dot suspened in the
air and</b>
<br><b>on me. My brother, Joe and I saw the blue light, which looked to
hard to</b>
<br><b>explaine but it was long and slender and it had a white and green
tint</b>
<br><b>to. We were all scared so we decided to leave and Dave went first.
He</b>
<br><b>yells up and asked if we were knocking on the floor and we said
No.</b>
<br><b>After what Dave said we ran out of there even quicker than before.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next night, everyone wanted to go back
inside the garage attic</b>
<br><b>to see what was going on. This time Andy wasn't there but this time
my</b>
<br><b>brothers friend Bill(12yrs) came with us. We were all looking around</b>
<br><b>with our flashlights than we took our seats to do tests to see if
we</b>
<br><b>heared any noises or saw thing like the night before. At first nothing</b>
<br><b>happen but one time when we turned all the lights out we could hear</b>
<br><b>knocking rate under our feet. Everytime we turned the lights ON
the</b>
<br><b>knocking would stop but when the lights went back off again the
knocking</b>
<br><b>continued. We were all really scared so we ran back out of the garage.</b>
<br><b>My friend Dave was mad about what was happened so he called the
ghosts</b>
<br><b>or thing alot of "names". Me, Dave, and Joe decided to go into the</b>
<br><b>bottom of the garage inwhich the knocking came from. It was pitch
black</b>
<br><b>in the just like the attic and we were looking for anything, all
we say</b>
<br><b>was light coming through a door that was part of the otherside of
the</b>
<br><b>garage. Athough the light seemed to get brigher as we stood there</b>
<br><b>longer. All of a sudden Joe says" What was that?". We turned on
the</b>
<br><b>flashlight to see what is was. Joe said that something pulled on
his leg</b>
<br><b>so we decided to run out of the garage. Then Dave deciced he was
going</b>
<br><b>back in to see what it was so Kyle and Bill followed him inside.
While</b>
<br><b>inside it was also pitch black as before but this time Dave was
saying</b>
<br><b>things to the ghosts again. All of a sudden a cold breze came aloung
out</b>
<br><b>of now where. Than it sounded like footsteps on a rocky ground.
That's</b>
<br><b>when my friend Dave got slammed into the garage door to where he
almost</b>
<br><b>went through. They ran out of the garage and Dave fell to the ground
and</b>
<br><b>past out for a minute. The rest of the night he felt sick to his
stomach</b>
<br><b>and felt like throwing up all night.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day which was Sunday, we decided
to go up in the daytime</b>
<br><b>to see if anything would happen then. We went up to see if anything</b>
<br><b>happened to be moved and Dave's cookies which was left up there
the</b>
<br><b>night before. At first we couldn't fine then and was about to leave
and</b>
<br><b>than Bill spots them. He went to eat one of the cookies and found
that</b>
<br><b>they we soggy, crumpled, and moved half way across the room on top

<p><b><font size=+1>My Accounts in the supernatural</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jessicarixey@juno.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi Dave,</b>
<br><b>I am very glad to find a site such as yours. I am very interested
in</b>
<br><b>spirits and I would like to share my account of hauntings in New
Jersey</b>
<br><b>and two in Florida where I now reside.</b>
<br><b>First of all the house I lived in for 16 years in Howell, New Jersey
was</b>
<br><b>built from scratch by my father.</b>
<br><b>There was a fountain in the front yard where a former resident,
a 12</b>
<br><b>year-old boy, fell head first an drowned.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I did not learn this until this year!</b>
<br><b>Well, I have had experiences in my bedroom such as my mascara</b>
<br><b>rolling back and forth all night.&nbsp; When I would turn the light
off to go</b>
<br><b>to sleep it would begin as I hopped into bed. I would get up, turn
on the</b>
<br><b>lights and it would roll to a stop.</b>
<br><b>I was, strangely, not frightened at this, but annoyed, because it
was not</b>
<br><b>letting me sleep.</b>
<br><b>It was vmischievous it was. This happened for about 3 months.</b>
<br><b>Nothing else ever bothered me in that home.</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was 16, I lived in a house built across from a slave cemetery
in</b>
<br><b>Crisfield, Maryland in the summers of&nbsp; 1984 through 1989.</b>
<br><b>This home was built in the late 1800's and had an upstairs and a</b>
<br><b>downstairs, There were steps&nbsp; directly outside of my bedroom
door leading</b>
<br><b>to the living room.</b>
<br><b>I was sleeping late one Saturday&nbsp; when my parents yelled to
me that they</b>
<br><b>were going "Yard Saling".</b>
<br><b>About 15 minutes after they drove off I heard a loud stomping up
and down</b>
<br><b>the stairs in front of my door. It was about 10 times of the same,
loud</b>
<br><b>running and stomping. I was needless to say terrified that someone
had</b>
<br><b>broken in. As I got my courage up, I quickly opened the door to
find no</b>
<br><b>one there and the running stopped.</b>
<br><b>I spent the rest of this day sitting outside, waiting for my parents.</b>
<br><b>My father, Les, had an experience in this Maryland home, while my
mom and</b>
<br><b>I were in New Jersey&nbsp; and he was alone.</b>
<br><b>He is a firm nonbeliever and would often make fun of my fears.</b>
<br><b>As he slept, he dreamed that his sister Maxine had come back to
see him.</b>
<br><b>She had just passed away from Lung cancer. When Maxine knocked at
the</b>
<br><b>back door, he answered it. He attempted to touch her, but she pulled
away</b>
<br><b>and smiled. When he awoke he told said he was so cold and cold not
warm</b>
<br><b>himself up to stop the shivering.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The final experience was when I was 24 years -old and living with
my</b>
<br><b>husband in a gorgeous old home named Windsong.</b>
<br><b>Windsong was built in the late 1800's&nbsp; on 18 acres. It looked
just like</b>
<br><b>Tara from Gone With the Wind.</b>
<br><b>It had a "slave house", a "hot house" where the cooks used to live.
These</b>
<br><b>were both on the same property as Windsong. Long story short we
"babysat"</b>
<br><b>this home for a doctor who was trying to sell it. His wife would
no</b>
<br><b>longer live in it because she was frightened.</b>
<br><b>Well, the first night I&nbsp; was there with my husband&nbsp; I
was scared to even</b>
<br><b>move.</b>
<br><b>As I layed in bed looking around in the dark bedroom I experienced</b>
<br><b>several experiences at once.</b>
<br><b>I heard the sound of high heels walking on the linoleum downstairs.
Then</b>
<br><b>as I looked around I saw a black and white face (just a face) speaking
as</b>
<br><b>if to someone, but there was no voice eminating from it. The face
was</b>
<br><b>that of an old man.</b>
<br><b>I could not budge I was so terrified.</b>
<br><b>Small things happened in the months to come. Example, perfume bottles</b>
<br><b>moving across the sink and falling in the sink, as I just sat and</b>
<br><b>watched.</b>
<br><b>I got very used to this stuff happening.</b>
<br><b>The last experience I had was the most "hands on" I have exer had.</b>
<br><b>I was lying in bed, ready to join my husband for the night. As I
lay</b>
<br><b>down, the bed started moving violently up and down as if someone
was</b>
<br><b>moving it with a a hand or behind (sitting and jumping). This happened</b>
<br><b>right by my left hip, on the left edge of the bed.</b>
<br><b>I woke my husband and we just observed this happening until it stopped.</b>
<br><b>It ended only after about 2 minutes.</b>
<br><b>I was spooked, but I was so used to the weirdness.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I thank you for the chance to air my stories that I have been harboring</b>
<br><b>for so long.</b><b></b>

<br><b><font size=+1>England Experiences</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp;&nbsp; photo@mitec.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was in England I had numerous incidents of paranormal activities.
The first was at the Tower of London.&nbsp; I did not know I was entering
the "Bloody Tower" until it was too late&nbsp;&nbsp; --I like a little
notice or I become very nauseous (don't ask me why)--there were many bad
feelings there...from crying women to screaming children. My husband, and
no one else, seemed phased at all.&nbsp; My husband quickly moved me out
of there because I started to weep.&nbsp; When we went into another part
of Castle I noticed a room that had a throne.&nbsp; Standing behind it
was a man who was extremely unhappy.&nbsp; He had on a fur cape and crown.&nbsp;
He vanished within seconds.&nbsp; I have no clue ifit was a ghost or perhaps
an energy impression. The second time we went back absolutely nothing happened.When
my husband and I made it to York, England--well, that's another story.
What activity that goes on there.&nbsp; I felt extremely uncomfortable
in the cathedral.&nbsp; In fact we left quite quickly.&nbsp; Behind the
cathedral is the Minister House.This is where video is forever set up in
the cellar to catch a glimpse of Centurion Soldiers seen walking at their
knee level.&nbsp; When they excavated the area a path was found where the
Romans had marched.&nbsp; Well, we saw nothing there.&nbsp; But as we were
going onto the first level I felt drawn up the stairs.&nbsp; I did not
follow the</b>
<br><b>tour that was in progress but abruptly went into a different room.&nbsp;
From what I found out later,it's called the Tapestry room.&nbsp; I looked
at a woman who was in the room then immediately looked over to a window
seat.&nbsp; There was a tall, slight built, black form sitting there.&nbsp;
I couldn't move. The woman immediately came over to me.&nbsp; It then disappeared.&nbsp;
The woman turned out to be a parapsychologist. She took me back down to
the first level where another parapsychologist interviewed me.&nbsp; My
husband was extremely annoyed (Big time non-believer). She then chastised
my husband and told him that she believed me and that from time to time
a phantom appeared in the room whenever there was a lot of energy. It felt
great finally meeting someone who didn't treat me like a freak. She lectured
my husband about how Americans are such a young nation and that if they
stayed in England for even a month their opinions would change. She was
extremely intelligent and delightful.&nbsp; In fact, she asked my opinion
about my experience.&nbsp; She stated that they didn't know if it was a
man or woman but that a murder had taken place there due to a lover triangle.
I told her I thought it was a man who was extremely feminine in nature.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>took down my name and where I was from.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I then
asked her about a house that was across the street at&nbsp; the corner.&nbsp;
I told her that it was very disturbing.&nbsp; I couldn't even look at the
windows.&nbsp; She&nbsp; told me that during the plague a small girl was
boarded up in the place and no one opened it up to get her out.&nbsp;&nbsp;
She starved to death there and ever now and again a child's wailing is
heard.&nbsp; Needless to say that was enough excitement for the day.&nbsp;
We headed off to a Greek restaurant where I packed down a few shots of
Ouzo!</b>
<br><b>Thank you</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>My Twin</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lkeffer1@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had many experiences over the years with the supernatural,
but</b>
<br><b>the one that still baffles me is the experience with my twin.&nbsp;
I grew up</b>
<br><b>believing in angels and ghosts.&nbsp; All my life I was told about
the boys</b>
<br><b>that my mother had lost during pregnancy, but it was only when I
asked</b>
<br><b>her about a strange experience that she told me I was a twin.&nbsp;
A close</b>
<br><b>friend of mine had died from leukemia.&nbsp; I was hurting, in pain,
and not</b>
<br><b>thinking straight.&nbsp; I was contemplating suicide, but as I cried,
I felt</b>
<br><b>someone beside me.&nbsp; A boy that looked very similar to my younger
brother</b>
<br><b>told me to sit up.&nbsp; He held me and stroked my hair as I cried.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>sister Lisa was in the room at the time and she remembers hearing
voices</b>
<br><b>and seeing me at an odd slant.&nbsp; My twin was holding me up.&nbsp;
He told me</b>
<br><b>that he loved me.&nbsp; We would always be a part of each other
and that I</b>
<br><b>should tell mom that everything would be okay.&nbsp; At the time,
my parents</b>
<br><b>thought that they were going to lose the house but an unexpected
check</b>
<br><b>arrived. I have never felt the kind of connection that I felt with
him.</b>
<br><b>I told mom what he said and asked her if I was a twin.&nbsp; That
was the</b>
<br><b>only expanation for the closeness I felt to him.&nbsp; She cried
and told me</b>
<br><b>that the first boy she lost was five months into her pregnancy.
When</b>
<br><b>tests were done after a D&amp;C, they revealed that she was still
pregnant.</b>
<br><b>Four months later, I was born.&nbsp; The story of my twin is ongoing.&nbsp;
I have</b>
<br><b>fallen to the ground and rolled between the wheels of a semi with
his</b>
<br><b>help.&nbsp; I have been pushed out of the way of a moving car.&nbsp;
I have safely</b>
<br><b>taken a plane both ways that a week later had engine trouble and</b>
<br><b>crashed.&nbsp; My legs froze into place to keep me from getting
in a car that</b>
<br><b>was broadsided.&nbsp; My twin looks out for me.&nbsp; I am not sure
if you would</b>
<br><b>call him a ghost or an angel, but I am glad that he is in my life.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Choosing our Parents</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cloud_ka@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Okay, hi, this may sound weird, but it freaked me out when I read
your page</b>
<br><b>on "Chosing our parents", it made remember what I almost forgot</b>
<br><b>One year befor my younger sister was born, my mom has a miss carage.
I</b>
<br><b>beeing 5 at the time was devistated.</b>
<br><b>a few of years later (about 4) my sister had to go to the hospital
'cause</b>
<br><b>she broke her arm. I had to go to my mom's friend's house. I was
really</b>
<br><b>worried about her, and then I saw what I thought was my sister's
ghost it</b>
<br><b>was standing by the piano, just looking at me, so I was really really</b>
<br><b>worried about her. She was fine after all.</b>
<br><b>Now I am 12, my sister is 6, I had a dream, that the same ghost
thing came</b>
<br><b>to me and told me that she was my sister but died befor she was
born, and</b>
<br><b>that she would be my first daughter when I grow up.</b>
<br><b>You probably get tons like this, but I just wanted to share it with
some one</b>
<br><b>'cause my friend would get mad.</b>
<br><b>Think about it,</b>
