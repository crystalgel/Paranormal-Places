<P><B>Blood's Point</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ussmcfaul@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>This story is kind of long but I hope you bear with me. It gives
credence to one of the stories listed on this web site under Haunted Places.
(Blood’s Point) Fourth of July week, 2001, my family and I were camping
as we do every year at Rock Cut State park, Illinois. One night, my cousin
and her boyfriend were telling another friend and me about this road called
Blood’s Point. There are stories of a cemetery, a barn and an abandoned
church on this road where strange things have been said to occur. Well
that night we decided to go to Bloods Point to walk around in the cemetery.
We didn’t know exactly where Blood’s Point was but we knew the general
area. We stopped at a gas station and got directions and we were on our
way. The roads in the area are long, narrow two way streets surrounded
by cornfields. We were searching for the road when we came upon a cemetery.
We were not yet on Blood’s Point but we decided to walk in that cemetery
anyway. It was around midnight when we pulled up and noticed another car
already parked next to the gate. We figured someone was already in there
so we decided to just turn around and continue looking for Blood’s Point
cemetery. We turned around right next to the other car as it was right
next to an intersection and right after we did so the car began to follow
us. The roads were deserted. It was just us and this other car. We drove
faster, it drove faster. It became obvious this car was chasing us. We
would turn, it would turn. Finally we made a turn and could no longer see
the other car. It seemed to have just disappeared. The roads were long
with no buildings around. We should have been able to see where the car
went. Well we figured it was just some people messing with us and continued
our search for Blood’s Point. A few minutes later we found it. We came
upon an old church next to a farm with the cemetery across the street.
On the left side of the church was a bunch if trees and my cousin’s boyfriend,
Paul, backed the car up slowly into them. I turned around and it looked
like there was a drop just beyond the trees into what looked to be stream.
I yelled at Paul to stop because I was afraid we would go over the edge.
I knew he was just trying to scare us but I didn’t know if he could see
the drop. He stopped and turned off the car. It was pretty creepy being
in the dark trees so I told him to stop messing around and start the car.
Laughing, he turned the key, but the car wouldn’t start. I told him to
quit messing around and I reached to turn the key myself, but it would
not start. He was not joking. We waited a few minutes and eventually the
car started. We pulled in front of the church and parked. Leaving the car
running this time, we got out of the car and walked up next to the church.
The windows were missing and the curtains were blowing in the wind. Through
the window, we could see a single red light bulb glowing in the middle
of the church. There were stairs leading to a door downstairs with a yellow
light on inside. We decided to stay away from the church. We didn’t know
if anybody was in the building although the church had been abandoned years
ago. Then we walked across the street to the cemetery, looking at the graves.
We were there for only a few minutes when my cousin and our friend screamed
at the same time. They said they saw something, although I never found
out what. All four of us ran back to the car, hopped in and drove off.
A few months later, I was reading on shadowlands Haunted Places when I
saw Blood’s Point mentioned. It has the story about the bus full of children
being killed and putting your car in neutral on the train tracks. Now you
hear this story in any state you’re in so I don’t particularly believe
this happened on Blood’s Point, but I thought it was kind of neat that
Blood’s Point was mentioned. So a couple months ago, I was telling my boyfriend
about how we had gone to Blood’s Point and how a car had chased us. I told
him there was story on the internet about Blood’s Point and I looked it
up to show him, but there had been an update since I had read it last.
The update was of a phantom car that chases you near Blood’s Point. Up
until then, I always passed it off as some kids messing around, but now
I have to wonder. The stories are listed under Cherry Valley, and Rockford,
Cherry Valley being a suburb of Rockford.</B><B></B>

<P><B>A Strange Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pennywise_danger@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>It all started about half a year ago, just a couple of months after
we had moved into this house. The first time I entered the house, I had
a strange feeling and I felt slightly uneasy, I had warned my parents how
I didnt like the feel of the house before we moved in but they thought
nothing of it. The first month or so went well, nothing happened that alarmed
me much. One day, though, I was sitting nearby the hallway door and noticed
it swinging back and forth. It didn't freak me out that much, I told my
step mom about it, she said another door was probably open and it was the
wind. Later weeks, thats when things had gotten really strange. I was laying
awake at night as I couldn't fall asleep, I heard my door violently shake
and the knob was trying to turn open. I also heard heavy breathing and
maybe the sound of footsteps. Even at one time, screaming came from all
directions of my room. I told my parents, but once again called it off
as nothing and just my crazy imagination. Night after night, things would
reoccur such as I could feel its presence, and could hear footsteps, and
it would call out my name and whisper in my ear. Now, I had a "psychic
board", that was supposed to attract higher spirits and good spirits. Me
and my best friend used this ALL the time, and it would always be a positive
experience. One night we had invited our friend to try it with us. We had
never related what was going on in my house as a possibility being connected
to the board. (I had bought the board at the same time things began happening).
Anyway, that night our friend was VERY jumpy and she was on her gaurds.
She insisted she leave the room when we first started, she was that scared.
She felt something not of good in the room, or the house. Awhile into using
it, we noticed whatever was talking to us didnt have good intentions. It
had begun to grab at our arms, it was as if it was a magnetic feild. And
then it asked for my life. This is when I worried. Only moments after,
we were called downstairs. About an hour later, we told our friend what
happened and she told us she didnt feel right, something bad was going
to happen, and she demanded out of the house. The rest of that night was
history, but I began suspecting that this could be what is bothering me
in my own home. Every night I crept in bed, I was scared of this thing
and what it might do to me. I heard different voices asking me to help
it, possibly a childs voice. Not too long after, I realized things had
only happened at sometime in the hour of 5am. Of course, my family thought
I went insane. Not many believed my stories I told of what would happen.
Until the night my brother had decided to stay up late playing video games
on his computer. At sometime about 5:40am, I started hearing groans, like
zombie noises behind me and I asked my brother if he heard the noises,
and yes he did. I finally decided it was time for it to know whats on my
mind. I yelled that I wasnt scared, and that it should just leave me alone.
And it started laughing at me. My brother was there to witness it all.
The last time I was aware of its presence was about 5:20am when I was up
watching cartoons due to the fact that my sleeping schedule was already
extremely off balance. My door swung open as if it had just barged in.
I stormed out of the room, upset of the thought that it wouldnt leave me
be no matter what I had told it. Several days passed, and that is when
I had the dream that reassured me it was gone for good. Somebody had led
me to my patio, where it showed me the ghost walking by, maybe leaving
the house as it implied. It told me that it was the ghosts last stay here,
and after tonight it would leave. Needless to say, nothing has happened
since then. Maybe it was my gaurdian angel that helped me?</B><B></B>

<P><B>i know that i have already sent you a story regarding my granny but
i thought that i would tell you about a haunting that is still going on
at my other gran's house( this is my father's mum i am talking about, it's
my mum's mother who died ok?).I first heard about this story when i was
12 years old (i am now coming up for 22 years in september 23rd 2003).I
was just starting to get into the paranormal and i asked my parents if
they had any ghost stories that they could tell me. My mother said that
she had loads of stories to tell from her side of the family and my father
said that he had only one story to tell and he said that the haunting was
still ongoing. so here is my father's true ghost story.</B>
<BR><B>It starts off in the groovy 70's when flares where all the rage
and disco was the hip happening thing. My father was just your average
18 year old, smoking and going up to the dancing when he met my mother
who was only 17. My father then invited my mother back to meet his parents
the next day. My mother said that when she went up to meet my dad's parents
she felt as though somebody was watching her as she went up the stairs
that lead from the front door to the rest of the house. My dad asked my
mum if she fancied spending the night at the house as he was too scared
to spend the night there himself (my granny and grandad where away to visit
my great grandparents at the time) so my mum said yes and she phoned her
mum to tell her that she was spending the night with my dad and that she
would be home the following night.So my mum then went to bed.She says that
it was so cold that she could see her breath even though it was the middle
of june and it had been really scorchingly hot that day.My mum then said
that she had locked the door and went to bed with her clothes on.My mum
said that she woke up through the night to the feeling that somebody was
fixing the covers around her.She thought that it might have been my granny
martha who might have come back earlier that night and who might have been
tucking the covers around her to keep her warm in the icy cold room.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning when my mum got up she asked my dad where his parents
where and he said that they where still at my great grandparents house
and that they would'nt be back til that afternoon. So my mum asked my dad
if he had come into her room through the night and my dad said that no
he did'nt but that he was up through the night himself because he had heard
somebody walking about and he had got up to see who it was.Thinking that
it might have been my mum,my dad went to my mum's room and tried to open
the door but he could'nt because it was locked from the inside.Then it
dawned on my mum that when she had got up that morning the door was still
locked and a cold shiver ran down her spine as she realised that something
supernatural had taken place.</B>
<BR><B>So, what do you think? could it have been a ghost in my dad's old
bedroom? i will leave that up to you to decide.But there is a couple of
other things that i want to add.Firstly this,when my grandparents first
moved into their house,they heard that a man had hung himself in the room
which was to become my father's bedroom.Secondly is this, the ghost is
still there to this very day and my grandad says that it polishes all his
trophies for him and, i must add that whenever i go up to my gran's house
i always take a peek into that room to see if i can catch the ghost polishing
my grandad's trophies,but,so far, no luck. the room itself is really dusty
except for those trophies i mentioned.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Yemaya</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bandreu0@lycos.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>A little bit of background first: I was 22 years old and living in
Gainesville, in the north of Florida, at the time. I worked as a prison
guard at a small correctional institution just outside town. As such, I
worked a somewhat odd shift, from 4PM to midnight, including weekends.
So, even though Gainesville is a college "party" town, I didn't have time
for the "fast" life as it were. I mention this because I want to make clear
that at the time of my encounter I was not intoxicated or under any other
kind of influence.</B>
<BR><B>I came home from the prison one Friday night in October around 12:15
AM (actually late Friday night/very early Saturday morning). Tired from
dealing with murderers, drug dealers, and other convicted felons all evening,
I promptly went to sleep around 1AM. Around 3:30AM (I know because I saw
the time clearly on my clock) I was awakened by the sound of people yelling
in my small apartment.</B>
<BR><B>The loud talking seemed to be coming from my own living room! People
have broken into my home! I thought as I tumbled out of bed. That was my
first reaction, as at the time I lived in a somewhat crime-prone section
of Gainesville.</B>
<BR><B>Now completely awake, not to mention very angry and somewhat frightened
(I admit) at this apparent home invasion, I crouched down on my bedroom
floor and crawled out to my living room. As I said before, my apartment
was tiny, an efficiency basically, so the trip to the living room took
all of ten seconds.</B>
<BR><B>I reached the living room still on all fours and found three complete
strangers there, standing between my favorite chair and the entertainment
system. They were two men and one woman. The woman was white, with long,
flowing blond hair, wearing what looked like a robe that seemed to glow
light blue. She was also VERY beautiful, strikingly so. One of the men
was what people of my ethnic background call a "mulato" (of mixed black/white
descent) wearing a guayabera (a traditional kind of shirt worn in Latin
America). The other man was Caucasian, with short black hair, also in a
guayabera. He appeared to be of Spanish or Mediterranean ancestry. I saw
them clearly because I had turned on a lamp where the short hallway and
living room intersected.</B>
<BR><B>Keep in mind that all of this occurred in mere seconds.</B>
<BR><B>As soon as I saw them I jumped up from the floor and began yelling
at them. "Get the hell out of my house right now!" "I don't know who the
hell you people are, but get out of my house before I call the cops!" My
adrenaline was working over time, and I was literally shaking with rage
and fright!</B>
<BR><B>The more I looked the trio of strangers, it dawned on me that they
were not typical criminals. They were extremely strange, to say the least.
I thought for a second that perhaps they were college kids who were drunk
or stoned and had broken into my apartment on a dare or something.</B>
<BR><B>As I yelled, they just ignored me. I knew I was yelling, but I swear
I could not actually hear my words as they left my mouth! Finally the blond
turned, put a finger over her lips and went "Shhhhhhh!" I was dumbfounded!
Then she said, in Spanish no less, "Be quiet, boy. Go back to bed, everything
is all right." Then she turned to her companions and began speaking to
them in Spanish.</B>
<BR><B>The trio kept talking among themselves loudly. The woman and the
Spaniard seemed to be yelling at the dark skinned man. I screamed again,
"Who the hell are you people?" Aain the beautiful ghostly woman turned
to me and said repeatedly, "Benjamin, you know who we are. We have always
been here with you, and we always will. Now go back to bed, my son." She
spoke kindly and gently, like a mother to her child. The mulato laughed
and started towards me. He looked hazy now, almost transparent. The blond
yelled at him and he stopped. I crawled back to bed and slept soundly the
rest of the night.</B>
<BR><B>Around 9AM Saturday morning, the phone rang and woke me up. It was
my brother who was living on the other side of the state at the time. Before
I could say anything more than 'Hello', he asked, "How did you sleep last
night? Anything strange happen?" Before I could answer, my brother recounted
ALL of the strange events of the past night, in EXACT detail. He told me
exactly what happened to me, described all three of the visitors in perfect
detail, including what the beautiful blond apparition told me, WORD FOR
WORD! You could have heard my jaw hit the floor. I dropped the phone receiver
on the kitchen floor.</B>
<BR><B>How did my brother know? He was friends at the time with a Puerto
Rican gentleman who practiced Palo, a kind of Afro-Cuban witchcraft. The
friend had performed a ceremony Friday night to invoke the goddess Yemaya
(the gorgeous blond, a deity from West African religion) and two other
muertos (dead spirits, "ghosts"). The mulato apparently was an evil spirit
that attached itself to me from the time I was born. Yemaya and the other
male spirit were there to protect me that night, as the evil spirit was
going to cause some unexpected tragedy to befall me. (I was told it would
be a very serious car crash on my way home from work that night, but who
knows for sure). I also apologized to my next door neighbors for all the
yelling and thanked them for not calling the police on me. The apartment
building had extremely thin walls, and noise was usually a problem. But
they looked truly puzzled and swore they didn't hear a peep out of my apartment
all night ...</B>
<BR><B>I saw "Yemaya" again for a couple of years after that, and occasionally
the good male spirit, whose name I have never been told. She would appear
at night, wake me from my sleep, sit on my bed and stroke my hair when
I was depressed and going through a lot of difficult times in my life.
She would tell me messages from my father, who passed away some 20 years
ago. I have not been visited by her in about 4 years as of this writing.
I later learned that my father, who was from Cuba, was a worshipper of
Yemaya in Havana, and had always petitioned her to look in on his youngest
child when the child was born.</B>

<P><B>Hi, here's my story - it's not as terrifying as some of the ones
I've read on this site, but it spooked me out for a few days! It was in
1994 or 1995, I was at Nottingham Trent University, England. I was staying
in halls of residence on the Clifton Campus - the "old" halls.</B>
<BR><B>I had just woken up (about 7.30) and checked my clock to see that
I had a few more minutes in bed before I had to get up for lectures. I
was just lying in bed thinking about the day ahead, when I felt the bottom
of the mattress depress, like someone had come in and sat on the end of
my bed. Without looking up, I thought - "That's odd, maybe it's Kat" (the
girl in the room next door) Suddenly I realised I had locked my door -
as I always did - so I started to get scared. I daren't open my eyes. My
bed was positioned up against the wall and the way I was sleeping was with
my back against the wall. Suddenly this thing on my bed - whatever it was
- started crawling up the bed, in between the wall and m y back. I froze.
I couldn't open my eyes or make a sound, I was terrified, all the time
my mind was racing and trying to figure out what the heck was in my bed!
Just as the "thing" reached my shoulder I could hear it breathing! The
way it sounded made me think it was a dog - you know, like panting? I felt
paralyzed, and this must have only lasted a few seconds but it felt like
hours! As soon as I could, I leapt out of bed and into the corridor, yelling
"There's a dog in my bed!!" Of course, everyone came and checked my room
and there was nothing in it. For a few nights after that I dragged my mattress
into my friends room. The weird thing is, when I told Mum about it that
night, she said a really similar thing happened to her when she was a girl,
maybe 15 or 16. She woke early, felt something in her bed and was convinced
it was a dog, but there was nothing there. Odd!</B>
<BR><B>One last thing - I LOVE your site! It's the best resource for paranormal
information. Keep up the good wo rk, you bring a lot of pleasure to a lot
of people!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Man in My Dreams</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kdawg_83@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>The house that I used to live in was built in the late 1800’s, it
was originally a log cabin but was added on in the mid 1900’s. I was very
young when this all happened so I don’t know if it was my imagination or
if it was real! My parent’s moved into the house in 1979 right after my
older sister was born. They had done some major repairs to the house before
moving in and my Grandfather helped out a lot, he was a painter and he
was I guess you would say a carpenter too. I never met my grandfather,
he died on July 12, 1981 almost 2 years before I was born! I was about
5 years old and I stayed in a room with my older sister at the time. I
would wake up in the middle of the night talking in my sleep, my sister
said that she heard me talking but couldn’t understand what I was saying.
I remember having dreams about an old gray haired man with a big belly
and cheerful expression on his face. But the whole thing was, I had never
seen this man before, not even in pictures. I later, about 3 years later,
was looking through one of my father’s picture albums and saw a picture
of the man that was in my dreams, so I asked my father who it was. He told
me it was my grandfather, but I had never seen any pictures of him and
I saw him in my dreams. Around that time the dreams stopped for a while.
On my 11th birthday I finally got my own room, which was the one that my
grandfather was standing in when the picture that I saw was taken. This
room was on the second floor and was at the end of a hallway with two other
rooms off of it. My bed was right in front of the door so that I could
see directly to the top of the stairs at the other end. I would be sound
asleep and be woken by a light in the middle of the night, I would open
my eyes and there would be nothing, so I just ignored it and went back
to sleep. This happened many nights for about 4 months. Then about 2 weeks
after the light in the night stopped I started just to wake up for no particular
reason in the middle of the night, I would have to say it was about 1ish,
but there were no clocks in my room so I’m not for sure. Well anyways I
would sleep facing the hallway. I would wake up in the middle of the night
and try to go back to sleep but couldn’t because I felt like someone was
standing over me watching me. I would finally go back to sleep only for
the same thing to happen night after night. One night around the beginning
of summer, I was awoken by the feeling of someone or something gently touching
my face. I opened my eyes and there was nothing there. This continued for
about a week until one night I was woken by the same thing only this time
I opened my eyes and looked down the hall. What I saw that night I will
never forget. There was an old gray haired man standing at the top of the
stairs with a bright light surrounding him. It was the man from the pictures,
my grandfather standing there smiling, and with a blink of the eye he disappeared.
I woke every night around the same time for the next few months but didn’t
see or feel anything. When I was about 13 my parents were having some problems
and were talking about separating, well this really disturbed me as it
would anyone else and I fell into a deep depression. Then it all started
again, waking up in the middle of the night and the dreams, like the ones
I had when I was little. Then the same thing happened again that happened
when I was 11, the same feeling of someone touching my face and then after
a few nights I began to wake up for no reason, until one night I woke up
and saw my grandfather again, only this time he was right by the entrance
of my room, he still had that same look on his face, the same smile the
same cheerful eyes. He just kept on smiling but this time he didn’t disappear
right away he just stood there not saying anything just smiling as if to
tell me that everything was going to be fine. Well needless to say my parents
did split up and I moved out about 3 months later to live with my father.
I never saw my grandfather again after that night. I didn’t tell anyone
about this because people would think I was crazy and they would think
it was my imagination, since I was so “young“, but to this day I can still
remember the expression on his face and the look in his eyes telling me
everything would be okay, and I know right now he's watching over me making
sure everything is alright.</B>

<BR><B>Red Lion Pub-Chicago</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: mrshaitana@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>First let me say that I enjoy your site and especially</B>
<BR><B>enjoy the true stories archives.&nbsp; Although I have</B>
<BR><B>never experienced anything "paranormal" I am</B>
<BR><B>fascinated by such things.</B>
<BR><B>After exploring your haunted site index I found that</B>
<BR><B>the "red lion pub" was among the haunted sites in my</B>
<BR><B>city and since I sometimes pass by that pub I decided</B>
<BR><B>to see it for myself.</B>
<BR><B>It was a Tuesday at around 7:30pm when I paid a visit</B>
<BR><B>to the pub with a friend of mine. As soon as I walked</B>
<BR><B>in I was assaulted by an odor. This odor had a</B>
<BR><B>mildew/damp feel to it.&nbsp; We sat down near the bar on</B>
<BR><B>the first floor and had a drink.&nbsp; After a while we</B>
<BR><B>switched over to some seats near the stairwell that</B>
<BR><B>leads to the first floor.&nbsp; My back was to the</B>
<BR><B>stairwell and at times I could feel the hairs on the</B>
<BR><B>back of my neck go up and I could feel someone</B>
<BR><B>touching the top of my head very lightly. I told my</B>
<BR><B>friend about it and he decided to ask the waiter about</B>
<BR><B>the "haunting". The waiter knew all about it and</B>
<BR><B>confessed that when he comes in to open in the morning</B>
<BR><B>he sometimes hears footsteps on the second floor when</B>
<BR><B>there is no one up there.&nbsp; The waiter also indicated</B>
<BR><B>that the second floor was the center of most of the</B>
<BR><B>ghost activity since a woman had died up there when</B>
<BR><B>the building used to be a private residence.&nbsp; Before</B>
<BR><B>going upstairs I asked the waiter about the mildew</B>
<BR><B>odor and he stated that he also has detected the odor</B>
<BR><B>but that the pub does not ordinarily smell that way.</B>
<BR><B>That being said my friend and I decided to go upstairs</B>
<BR><B>to have a look for ourselves. We climbed the stairs</B>
<BR><B>and the hairs on my neck stood up again. The air was</B>
<BR><B>charged and I could feel it.&nbsp; At the top of the stairs</B>
<BR><B>there is a room with tables/chairs, a second bar, and</B>
<BR><B>a lounge.&nbsp; The lounge was occupied by students having</B>
<BR><B>a poetry reading, so my friend and I sat in two large</B>
<BR><B>smoking chairs directly in front of the second bar.</B>
<BR><B>While sitting there I felt watched. I asked my friend</B>
<BR><B>if he was feeling the same and he indicated he was</B>
<BR><B>not.&nbsp; We sat and talked for about 20 minutes then</B>
<BR><B>decided to leave.&nbsp; I was somewhat disappointed that</B>
<BR><B>the ghost did not manifest itself in a more visual or</B>
<BR><B>audio way but it's probably better that it didn't.</B>
<BR><B>However I have to say that based on the "feelings" I</B>
<BR><B>got at the place I think I can safely say that there</B>
<BR><B>is something paranormal about the pub, especially the</B>
<BR><B>second floor.</B>
<BR><B>Well that s my story. If you're ever in Chicago you</B>
<BR><B>need to stop by the Red Lion Pub on Lincoln Ave and</B>
<BR><B>check it out.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My mothers house is very haunted. It is located in Pasadena, Texas.
Three ghosts have been seen, a blond girl in her twenties,..perhaps from
the early 1900 era, and a confederate soldier holding a rifle, and a young
boy approximately from the 1940' s era judging by the clothes. Many things
have happened in this house. Also, the house next door is haunted by a
teen boy that was shot in the head over drugs in the 1970's. Please note,
the house next door, noone stays in that house very long. The house my
mother lives in...we tolerate the ghosts, and the whispering and the doors
slamming, and the apparitions..they dont bother us, and sometimes they
have helped us.</B><B></B>

<P><B>MY BIRTHDAY GIFT</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Piksi212@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I guess I'm what you can call "gifted" in the paranormal sense.&nbsp;
Even when I was a kid, I would feel someone was watching me or something
was beside me.&nbsp; I have a third-eye.&nbsp; The hairs on my back would
stand up when i get that "feeling" of having something near me or having
someone watching me.&nbsp; I would also often see a blurry white image
wherever i go, or if i'm in someplace that is haunted or scary.&nbsp; I
would think this is one way for them to communicate with me.</B>
<BR><B>Well, anyways, this story that i am about to tell you happened in
February of 1998 back in my hometown in the Philippines.&nbsp; It was on
the morn of my birthday, February 12.&nbsp; I remember waking up at 3:00
in the morning (since i have an alarm clock beside my bed) because i suddenly
could not breathe.&nbsp; It felt as if someone or something was hugging
me tight.&nbsp; Very, very tight.&nbsp; I couldn't move at all.&nbsp; My
head was turned to the left side as if that "something" was hugging me,
and its head was on my right shoulder.&nbsp; I couldn't turn or move my
head or lift my hands or legs.&nbsp; Everything was kept tight to the sides,
as if I was binded.&nbsp; I couldn't open my eyes, either.&nbsp; I wanted
to wake up and scream but i can't.&nbsp; All this time, I knew I was conscious,
and not dreaming.&nbsp; I wanted to push "it" away but i just couln't move
at all.&nbsp; I prayed so hard for it to stop.&nbsp; I prayed the Apostle's
Creed since I was told that this is the most powerful of all.&nbsp; So
i did pray in my mind.&nbsp; As soon as i was in the middle of my prayer,
it stopped.&nbsp; In total, it lasted for 8-10 minutes.&nbsp; After that,
I felt weak as if i went through an ordeal of some sort.&nbsp; I was perspiring
and breathing heavily.&nbsp; All sorts of imagination and ideas came to
my mind, on what was that or who was it.&nbsp; I suddenly thought of my
Grandma who passed away a year ago.&nbsp; I thought to myself, she probably
visited me on my birthday.&nbsp; But why then i wasn't able to breathe,
move or talk.&nbsp; Couldn't be. My grandma wouldn't do such a thing.&nbsp;
So i was left with that incident to worry over.&nbsp; It never happened
again, thank God.&nbsp; Then, in September of the same year, my friends
and I visited a "manghuhula" in a nearby province.&nbsp; His name was "Mang
Danny".&nbsp; He is some sort of a seer/clairvoyant/ medium.&nbsp; He also
has the ability to talk with saints.&nbsp; I had a lot of things to ask
him but i just kept my mouth shut since all of of my friends were raring
to go first.&nbsp; When my turn came, he looked at me and said, "I have
been waiting for you for so long.&nbsp; And I know you have a lot of things
to ask me."&nbsp; Now, that gave me the chills.&nbsp; So naturally i asked
him about that incident on my birthday.&nbsp; I asked who it was.&nbsp;
He then closed his eyes for several seconds and when he opened them again,
he looked at me straight in the eyes and said, "It was the devil.&nbsp;
It was Satan".&nbsp; Mang Danny said the devil wanted to take my soul,
and he usually does that on a person's birthday since a person's soul is
opening to a new year and a new beginning.&nbsp; And that makes it easier
for him to take a person's soul when the person is about to enter into
a new dimension of his life.&nbsp; Mang Danny said i was lucky enough to
drive him away.&nbsp; I told him i prayed hard the Apostle's creed.&nbsp;
He said, "No, i think it was your ability.&nbsp; You see, when i look at
you, i see a a silver tree.&nbsp; You are very gifted.&nbsp; You don't
have to go and see a medium again since your life is very solid.&nbsp;
You don't have to know what will happen in 30 or 50 years since you are
in control".&nbsp; He also told me lots of things, like how i'm very sensitive
with the "the other side".&nbsp; He told me that he can see the person's
aura or ability by looking at the forehead.&nbsp; If he sees a stone, the
person is normal meaning not sensitive enough.&nbsp; If he sees a silver
light or beam, the person is sensitive and has the ability of seeing.&nbsp;
If he sees a diamond, then the person is very very sensitive and has the
great ability to even drive off evil.&nbsp; Now, guess what he saw in me...&nbsp;
He also told me that God has a "gift" for me.&nbsp; He had been wanting
to give it to me for a long time but was waiting for the right moment.&nbsp;
He told me I will receive that "gift" soon.&nbsp; Well, at that time, i
was not so sure if i believed him or not.&nbsp; Everything that he told
me was just straight out weird.&nbsp; I've heard of such things but i just
can't fathom it happening to me.&nbsp; But then, after a month, in October,
i received that long-time "gift".&nbsp; I got to meet my soulmate, my first
boyfriend, who's now my fiancee.&nbsp; So i guess i kind of believed in
him.&nbsp; I'm thankful that at least I got to experience that and it made
me even stronger.&nbsp; Nowadays, i still see and experience those "weird
things" but i guess it's just a part of me after all.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I Went to Jerome</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: KtownChick84@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is really really weird. I heard about Jerome so I was doing
an internet search about the place and couldn't find anything. Then me
and some friends went out there. It was during the summer and was so humid
out and we only had one really dim flashlight with us.</B>
<BR><B>So we drive around the cemetary 3 times because it's in the shape
of a 6 and on the third time around we saw a man in a dark cape with two
dogs standing on either side of him right in the middle of the cemetary.
So we stop and then he just disappeared and we decide to get out and investigate
the grounds.</B>
<BR><B>Well we head east towards the woods and the ground is so soggy that
our feet get soaked. And in the middle of walking towards the woods we
hear people in the woods talking and dogs barking. So we get spooked and
drive out of the cemetary.</B>
<BR><B>Well on the way back through jerome we go down this pretty deserted
road and all of a sudden we hear this dog barking and it sounded like it
was right in the car with us. So we stop and drive backwards to where we
heard it and couldn't see anything. It's like the dog wasn't even there.</B>
<BR><B>Then a few days later I look on the internet again and find this
site and read about the man and the dogs.</B>
<BR><B>I haven't been back there since!</B>

<P><B>I have had dealings with the supernateral for as far</B>
<BR><B>back as I can remember. I was raised in a very</B>
<BR><B>Christan home so let me make that clear. my brother,</B>
<BR><B>sister and myself were walking up the gravel drive</B>
<BR><B>that cold December morning in 1990 . when as luck</B>
<BR><B>would have it all 3 of us spied a little black puppy</B>
<BR><B>that looked as if she were a mix of a lab, irishsetter</B>
<BR><B>and a cockerspainal. which we later discoverd she was</B>
<BR><B>a&nbsp; Black springer spanial we assume was dropped off by</B>
<BR><B>one of the local collage students who couldnt take her</B>
<BR><B>home for christmas. my dad decided we could keep her.</B>
<BR><B>while spending spring break with my grand mother and</B>
<BR><B>visiting her mother in law,I met an interesting nurse</B>
<BR><B>who told me amoung other things that God sends Angels</B>
<BR><B>in the form of animals to protect us. Memorial day</B>
<BR><B>1991 my dad sufferd a heart attack and that was when</B>
<BR><B>the spirits really started acting up around the house.</B>
<BR><B>there had allready been some activity but it soon</B>
<BR><B>became worse.smells, things moving by themselves,</B>
<BR><B>doors that were'nt locked not wanting to open. an</B>
<BR><B>obvious feeling as though you were being watched and</B>
<BR><B>not wanted there. odd sounds. voices . pretty much you</B>
<BR><B>name it.</B>
<BR><B>While my 12 year old little brother and I were home</B>
<BR><B>waiting for our grandmother to take us to little rock</B>
<BR><B>were our dad was hospitalized we heared Ellie outside</B>
<BR><B>growling and snarling&nbsp; and raiseng all matter of hell</B>
<BR><B>at something that sounded sort of like a pig but a bit</B>
<BR><B>different.&nbsp; I feel jittery just remembering it. he</B>
<BR><B>denise it happened to this day but that is his way of</B>
<BR><B>dealing with it any way . we looked out the large bay</B>
<BR><B>window of the liveing room instantly we were frozen as</B>
<BR><B>we gazed at the scene below. Ellie&nbsp; was trying to kill</B>
<BR><B>this thing . IT was a fuzz ball of light orange with</B>
<BR><B>darker orange splotches it had the feet of a dog the</B>
<BR><B>snout of a pig and small tusks but even in braud day</B>
<BR><B>light its eyes glowed red. it had a putrid smell that</B>
<BR><B>we could even smell in the house and was by many</B>
<BR><B>usless attemts&nbsp; thanks to Ellie was trying to get to</B>
<BR><B>the house where we were. Ellie fought this thing</B>
<BR><B>tooth and nail in the circle of trees in our front</B>
<BR><B>yard. It soon became a bloody ball of fight and ran</B>
<BR><B>back into the woods where she persued it my brother</B>
<BR><B>and I prayed. we looked in the direction they went and</B>
<BR><B>the trees actualy were swaying where they fought. that</B>
<BR><B>was no wind nor was that thing a wild boar. we sat in</B>
<BR><B>tears afraid for Ellie and to scared to go out to call</B>
<BR><B>her back . we felt helpless so I begain to pray.&nbsp; As</B>
<BR><B>we were praying aloud we heard Ellie bark. and&nbsp; then</B>
<BR><B>we saw her trotting back to us across the yard happy</B>
<BR><B>as she could be. we cautiously let her in .</B>
<BR><B>upon examination she had no cut gauges no blood not</B>
<BR><B>even a bruise NOTHING that&nbsp; would indicate what we had</B>
<BR><B>just wittnesed. so we decided to keep this to our</B>
<BR><B>selves. Then a year later IT returned and this time my</B>
<BR><B>mother saw it and the scean&nbsp; played out much like the</B>
<BR><B>one we had witnessed. ELLIE batteled many THINGS on</B>
<BR><B>that property Things that hissed and only she could</B>
<BR><B>see them you could only hear and smell there foul odor</B>
<BR><B>. She was a loyal companion and would attack any thing</B>
<BR><B>or anyone that posed a threat to us weather we knew if</B>
<BR><B>they did or not at the time. She&nbsp; let us know. Ellie</B>
<BR><B>is a gental loveing dog and I am proud to have had the</B>
<BR><B>privalage of her spiritual protection through the many</B>
<BR><B>troubled years of our lives. I am bareived to say that</B>
<BR><B>on march 28 th 2003 Ellie passed away in comfort whilw</B>
<BR><B>sleeping&nbsp; in her own bed at my sisters home. It was 11</B>
<BR><B>months after my dad passed away. Looking back I belive</B>
<BR><B>there was a reason she was sent to us at that time . I</B>
<BR><B>didnt put it all together&nbsp; until&nbsp; april. That nurse I</B>
<BR><B>spoke breifly of told me something else. she noted my</B>
<BR><B>last name was Irish .She informed me that the irish</B>
<BR><B>people had a close relationship with God and that the</B>
<BR><B>devil would fight&nbsp; desperately for their souls. so</B>
<BR><B>keep God in your heart She said. Ellie was there</B>
<BR><B>standing guard over my dad and we three children. I</B>
<BR><B>have no doubt that she was an angel sent from above to</B>
<BR><B>guard and protect us from the evil that had haunted</B>
<BR><B>that property. we had many wonderful times together</B>
<BR><B>and I will miss her.</B>

<BR><B>Durango Colorado</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: deenerann@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I lived in a haunted house in Durango, Colorado for about a year.</B>
<BR><B>The house has a brick shed/barn, with a loft, that faces the parking
lot of the grocery store.</B>
<BR><B>The store had purchased the house, after it had been empty for a
year or so, and I worked at the store.&nbsp; My manager knew I was looking
for a place to rent, so he offered me the house.&nbsp; I gladly accepted.</B>
<BR><B>The house had a weird vibe, but I like ghosts, and don't scare very
easily, so I wasn't too worried about it.</B>
<BR><B>From the very beginning of moving in, my roommate and I would wake
up every morning, and one or the other of us would find ALL of the cupboards
and all of the drawers in the kitchen open. (and this was a big kitchen).&nbsp;
We laughed it off, and closed them, EVERY morning.&nbsp; This continued
for a few months.</B>
<BR><B>Also, I would see shadows run by out of the corner of my eye, my
cats would FREAK out, and stare at one spot by my roommates door for hours...would
not venture into the living room, where the door was located.</B>
<BR><B>I constantly felt the prescense of something sitting in the corner
of my bedroom, and my roommates window would never stay shut.&nbsp; He'd
shut it, leave the room, come back, and it would be open again.</B>
<BR><B>The Shed in the back had a horrible vibe, so much so that i wouldn't
walk past it at night.</B>
<BR><B>My boyfriend at the time's cousin could actually see ghosts, and
I took her up the loft, where I had set up an art studio.&nbsp; (for day
use, only).&nbsp; She made all the appropriate comments, but I could tell
she was a little wary.&nbsp; When we left the shed, she told me she saw
three people hanging from the rafters.</B>
<BR><B>The store had plans of tearing down the house (but they never did),
and I was pregnant, and didn't want my daughter in the house.&nbsp; The
ghosts were harmless, but I didn't want to raise her there...just the "what
if?" factor.</B>
<BR><B>We had openly discussed the possible demolishing while In the house,
which now I realize probably wasn't so smart, but didn't really think of
it at the time.&nbsp; I was there alone one night, and heard something
hit the back door, hard.&nbsp; I was a little scared, because i wasn't
sure if it was an intruder, or a bear (this was colorado), or something
else, so I didn't open the door.</B>
<BR><B>My boyfriend returned home about 30 minutes later, and asked what
i did to the back door.&nbsp; Apparently SOMETHING had taken a 2x6 board
that was by the shed, and THROWN it into the back door, with enough force
to cause a hole in a solid wood door.</B>
<BR><B>I'm convinced this was one of the not so nice entities from the
shed.</B>
<BR><B>I moved out, and a friend of mine moved in.&nbsp; I didn't tell
him about the ghosts, because he's terrified of them.</B>
<BR><B>He never walked to the store through the back yard, so i asked him
why.&nbsp; He said he hated the shed.&nbsp; Which brought up a ghost discussion.&nbsp;
His DEAF dalmation would wake up from a deep sleep, with no provocation,
and just start barking at one spot.&nbsp; They thought he was going crazy.&nbsp;
My friend was in my old bedroom, starting to go to sleep, and glanced out
in to the living room, and saw someone (a full sized human figure) crawling
on the ceiling.&nbsp; Just stuff like this.</B>
<BR><B>The house is still standing, and I'm not sure what else may have
gone on there, since I moved out of state.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: t.gould@shaw.ca</B><B></B>

sure because the last time i saw the girl she was bleeding everywhere.
the figure walked closer to me and as it approached my face i saw the bluest
eyes i have ever seen and the rest of her body was covered in-blood. i
started to scream and then the girl who we later found out that her name
was Laura, put her fingers up to her lips as if to be quiet.Then she walked
back to the closet and disappered into it.I had to go to many councilling
appointments to get over this, and still i am not.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Baby on the Bed</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Rusty1218@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello there once more. We had this morning&nbsp; a incident that
happened to my older Daughter. At about 6 am, my daughter awoke because
something tickled her ear. When she opened her eyes she saw this Baby sitting
on the end of her bed looking at her . It was the same Baby I wrote about
earlier in one of the other stories. Because when I ask her after she told
me what happened she described it exactly the way it looked in the photo.it
had on a white night gown and no hair, my daughter just looked at it and
then a tall shadow came out of no where and it the shadow was standing
in the middle of my daughters room (she said she could make out that it
was a women and she wore a blue and white top , like the old fashion blouses)
suddenly the shadowy women had the baby at her Hand and they both disappeared.My
Daughter was so afraid that she was crying the whole time as she was telling
me what happened . When something new comes up I let you know. By for now.</B><B></B>

<P><B>A Ghost Dog</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sernst@woh.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; It all started when i was 5 years old.&nbsp; My siebrien husky
dog name nemo (which i called him memo) was very sick and was put to sleep.&nbsp;
In the past he never felled to protect me.&nbsp; About a year late my brother
and I kept hearing footsteps going up to are room.&nbsp; When my older
brother made me go check it out nothing was there.&nbsp; Later we would
start to hear voices, three of them talking to each other.&nbsp; This went
on for 3 years.&nbsp; One night when my brother was spending the night
at a friends i got fed up and said whoever you are leave me alone.&nbsp;
Every thing was fine until the next weakend when my brother left again
to spend the night at a friends.&nbsp; It was about somewhere around 12-1a.m.
when the footsteps kept me up then one of the voices said he's alone lets
get him.&nbsp; All of a sudden the footsteps were running up the stairs
then I heard a faint sound of a dog barking and running. At this time I
was hidding my head under my covers when i felt my water bed shake. Next
the strangest feeling came over me, it was cold yet warm and i felt at
ease until now.&nbsp; I am 15 and now live in a different section of the
room near the stairs.&nbsp; Eversince we got a new dog the ghost dog which
I believed to be my dog nemo hasn't been interacting with me as much.&nbsp;
Now I've been feeling a scary preasance where I used to stay and have been
hearing sounds that been becoming more preasant.&nbsp; We just returned
from vacation and I found dog crap in my room which rusty(my new dog) almost
will never go in my room alone and if he did you could hear him tear out
of there a few minutes later.&nbsp; I haven't seel or felt anything that
threatened me yet but if my dog who is well house trained could be scared
shitless (literly) there has to be something wrong.&nbsp; I just hope if
the presence turns threatening that my dog comes back.</B><B></B>

<P><B>What Was It?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: junbug20@earthlink.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, Your site sure is one of a
kind, thank you, and here's my experience, My father came to live with
me in California and loved to sit out side, well he came in our front door
and walking to the hall way when the fire alarm went off by itself with
no cooking smoke or anything for about 10 seconds or so, both he and my
daughter looked at me as if I knew why it did that, a few minuets later
I went into our bathroom which is right off the hallway, and I heard this
hateful growling at me coming from above me by the ceiling I ignored at
first, when it did it again! this time there was no mistake about it, I
was angry because that thing didn't belong in my house, let alone growling,
I looked up and said; this house belongs to Jesus! and never had that experience
again. thank God.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; The Trunk Stop</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Warrior109@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well this story has been past down to me by one of my close friends
about his house. When he and his family first moved there he and his brother
both slept in the same room at the end of the hall, one night they awoke
to see a figure in front of their bed. I believe this is a "Grey Lady"
apparition but it seemed to cause them no harm or malice. Well when they
awoke from their slumber they where astonished by this being and screamed.
After their long fearful yell the apparition looked at them and busted
like a comet out of the window. They soon inspected outside their window
and deemed it impossible for a single person to fall out of the second
story window and be able to run away from sight in time. After this the
generic running into the parent's room was inevitable. A few years down
the line the normal households activities were interrupted time to time
by the knocking over of items in a specific room now called the "Forbidden
Room" because of all the paranormal activity in that specific area of the
house. Soon a friend of the family with rumored powers to contact the supernatural
was called in to finally put an end to the spirit mischief. The friend
of the family told them that this was the ghost of a woman who used to
live in the house and aid trunk drivers with a place to eat and stay on
long deliveries. The reason for her death is unknown but soon after the
visitation with the paranormal psychic the activity stopped all together
inside the house. For credibility I will tell you all that I have know
this person for over a decade and known the cause of his superstitious
beliefs</B><B></B>

<P><B>Proving it to Mom</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Jpdragontears@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I've had my share of incidents over the years. I was seven when my family
and I moved into an old farmhouse out in the country. The very first night
that we had all of our stuff in the house was when things started to happen.
my brothers and I didn't have our beds set up yet, so we had to sleep downstairs
for a couple of nights. The very first night my brothers and I heard walking
around upstairs. We got our dad up . My dad went upstairs with a loaded
shotgun and looked around. He came back downstairs and said that there
was nothing there and even the windows were locked. From there on the walking
noise would start at the bottom of the steps and come up through my bedroom,
into my brothers bedroom. It would start all over throughout the night.
As time went by, this spirit made itself known to us kids. it would take
the knob on our radio and spin through the stations and we'd be awake when
it would happen. I remember one night in particular. It was a hot summer's
night when I leaned over to turn my boxfan on. Before I reached the knob,
it flipped itself on high. The only way to turn the fan on was by hand.
I freaked out and flew downstairs. I ran to my mom. She didn't believe
me, but my brothers knew. My brothers and I decided that we had to prove
to her what was going on. We took her one night upstairs and set her on
one of my brother's bed (which we knew where the walking would stop). We
told her to be quiet and to set still. After a few minutes right on que
the spirit made his walk up the stairs and came through my room and walked
up her and stopped. My mom was pale and her jaw about dropped. This spirit
began to make itself known to my mom now. The doors would bang, the chain
lock would go up and down. My mom would get so scared that she would ask
me if I wanted to sleep with her at night. My dad was a long haul truckdriver,
so he'd be gone for a couple of weeks at a time.&nbsp; There's more that
happened over the years, but I'll save that for another time.</B>

<P><B>Our Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: flanagan@mebtel.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was&nbsp; twelve&nbsp; my family moved&nbsp; to another house
and on more than one occasion members of my family have had experiences
with a ghost&nbsp; it all started one night&nbsp; shortly after we moved

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>For as long as i can remember i have had weird things happen to me,
but the</B>
<BR><B>first real encounter was when i was twelve.&nbsp; I remember i was
living at my</B>
<BR><B>grandma in florida and was babysitting my sister at the time.&nbsp;
We where watching</B>
<BR><B>Tv (I can even remember what we were watching.)&nbsp; when i heard
the refridgerator</B>
<BR><B>door open, no one else was home so I leaned back the recliner to
see what was</B>
<BR><B>going on when i saw a knee high white object shoot down the hallway.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>funny thing was that it did not scare me for some reason I knew
it was my</B>
<BR><B>grandfather that past away in the kitchen of a heart attack.&nbsp;
I got up to go to the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen and open the fridge, thats when i saw his insulin right
in the front of</B>
<BR><B>the fridge.</B>
<BR><B>My next experiance was when i was 20&nbsp; we lived in a old house
and weird</B>
<BR><B>things happend, like the tv being on when it was not befor and when
you would go</B>
<BR><B>turn it off you could'nt because it was never on.&nbsp; A few times
my son (then 1</B>
<BR><B>1/2) would look up to the ceiling and talk and laugh at things i
could not see.</B>
<BR><B>Now I am almost twenty-nine and things still happen to me, like
i sometimes</B>
<BR><B>hear the phone ring before it does, and i also see these electric
like little</B>
<BR><B>balls on the walls and ceiling, but when i go to focus on them they
are gone.</B>
<BR><B>I am still trying to find a way to see theses spirits as i have
learned what</B>
<BR><B>they are but still not luck someday I hope to figure all of this

<P><B>My Haunted House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Fireflynl2003@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>When I was about 16 years old, my younger brother and I were up late
watching a movie in the living room of the house I still live in, which
was built in 1880. We heard strange noises coming from the kitchen.&nbsp;
This was really not very out of the ordinary because not only do old houses
make strange noises, but we were use to unexplained noises as well.&nbsp;
Mine is a family of believers.&nbsp; Well, we heard these noises and my
brother says, "oh it's just the ghost.&nbsp; I can communicate with it
if I want. I do it all the time."&nbsp; well, I was kind of freaked out
and told him not to do anything stupid.&nbsp; So he yells out "if you're
there let us know" and at that precise second a huge crashing resounded
in the kitchen.&nbsp; It sounded like the clean dishes in the drain board
had all crashed and fallen.&nbsp; My brother jumped up to go check it out
and although I was hesitant, to say the least, I followed.&nbsp; Well when
we got to the kitchen we realized that there was nothing disturbed at all.&nbsp;
In fact, there were no dishes in the drain board.&nbsp; So we checked around
and there was nothing that could have made that noise.&nbsp; Our dog was
asleep upstairs as well as our parents.&nbsp; What was really strange was
that my mother did not come running, nor did my dog.&nbsp; Everyone slept
right through it and it was an extremely loud noise.&nbsp; As I looked
at my little brother in total shock he simply said, "see, I told you so."&nbsp;&nbsp;
There have been many unexplained events in this home which my family has
occupied for about 10 years now.&nbsp; This was the one that convinced
me that I could no longer accept the explanations that I sometimes tried
to make myself believe for all of the strange noises and goings-on in this
home.&nbsp; Although I am sometimes scared when the hair raises at the
back of my neck, I believe that this ghost is not bad in any way, however
sometimes mischievious.&nbsp; Thank you for listening to my story.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Grandmas Things and the Champagne Flute</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: Poisondartfrog25@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have several ghost stories to tell.....I was at my apartment cleaning
out a closet and had found some things of my Grandma's that I was given
after she passed away about 2 or 3 years ago. I'm still upset over my Grandmother's
death so I started crying and brought some of the things into the kitchen
to put up on my kitchen wall and when I set them down near the toast the
coils on the inside of the toaster turned bright red like the toaster was
on but I hadn't used it in days!! It was also an old toaster my Grandma
had owned and it only worked if you put the bread in the certain slot and
then it would lower the bread in the toaster and then it would work. The
toaster couldn't have possible turned on by itself like that. After a minute
or 2 the coils in the toaster were no longer red and were back to normal
and the toaster was still cold. I did pick up the toaster and tried to
shake it to make sure it wasn't a fluke but no matter what I did the toaster
wouldn't turn on. That was about 6 months ago and since then the toaster
has never turned on by itself since. I feel that on that day when I was
missing my Grandma so much I could hardly breathe that she was trying to
let me know that she was with me and that I shouldn't be so sad.</B>
<BR><B>Another time in my apartment my partner was walking into the kitchen
to get some ice cream cake out of the freezer. She was almost to the freezer
when a champagne flute that was on top of the fridge but was behind two
rows of glasses flew off the fridge and over all the glasses without knocking
any of them down and flew diagonally at her almost hitting her in the head.
Then the champagne flute fell to the floor but did not break. At the same
time this was going on a glass bowl of fruit we had sitting on the counter
next to the fridge blew out at her too. I don't know why this happened
but I do know that the glass couldn't have come flying off the fridge like
that...miss knocking down or breaking everything that was standing in front
of it and then land on the linoleum floor without breaking. Also glass
bowls like that just don't shatter at the same time like that for no reason.</B>

<BR><B>Ghosts Onboard My Ship</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sgarci@lincoln.navy.mil</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;i am an engineer in the navy and i work in many engineering
spaces where</B>
<BR><B>things are loud and many times hot. anyways while on watch and touring
some</B>
<BR><B>spaces i would get a strong feeling that i am being stared at. one
night i</B>
<BR><B>was in one of our spaces while on watch and had got mad because
one of my</B>
<BR><B>equipment wouldn't get back into specs and wouldn't function right,
but it</B>
<BR><B>always did that. so i got mad and just started cursing, soon after
i went to</B>
<BR><B>the lower level of the machinery space and as i was going down the
ladder i</B>
<BR><B>felt as if i was pushed down the stairs. i cought myself and slid
all the</B>
<BR><B>way to the deck. i looked back and i was the only one there, no
one could of</B>
<BR><B>came in without me knowing. i just blew it off and as i was taking
readings</B>
<BR><B>on one of our a/c plants i felt as if someone was just staring hard.
i raced</B>
<BR><B>out, and many times after when i would go there i get that strong
feeling</B>
<BR><B>and once i have seen a bright flash right behiond me, but it couldn't
be a</B>
<BR><B>light because none of them were flickering. in another space i would
hear</B>
<BR><B>things many times while in watch. sometimes when i would begin to
dose off</B>
<BR><B>all of a sudden i would hear a loud noise in the back of the space,
and no</B>
<BR><B>one would be there. sometimes i would see shadows or bright little
lights</B>
<BR><B>move around and vanish. one night i shut the lights off in the space
with a</B>
<BR><B>friend of mine in the back and he said he saw a person in coveralls
just</B>
<BR><B>staring at him. he said it was a guy who had died years before and
he used</B>
<BR><B>to stand watch in there many times. many other of my friends who
stood watch</B>
<BR><B>in there said they would see and hear things too. some say that
when they</B>
<BR><B>would lay down in there while not busy that they would all of a
sudden feel</B>
<BR><B>a hard push on their chest and no one was there.</B>

<P><B>Ghosts don't Hunt Modern Houses</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sborovna2stupen@zssnp.cz</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well, they do!</B>
<BR><B>It is rather annoying to be told to your face that your encounter
with a ghost was not real because it happened in a modern house. I accept
that most people, when they think of haunted houses, imagine 16th/17th
century mansions not a 1980s terrrace on a housing estate.</B>
<BR><B>So the story begins. I had just bought my first house, a small,
two bedroomed modern terrace. It was all I could afford but nevertheless
was what I wanted. So. as the lease on my rented property overlapped the
move in date for my house, I saw this as an ideal opportunity to paint
the living room and do other DIY before I moved myself in. After a few
weeks I decided that I needed to get used to sleeping there, so I retired
to my bedroom, where I slept on a bed that the previous owner was only
to happy to leave, and as I didnt have any furniture, I was happy to accept.</B>
<BR><B>In the early hours of the morning, I dont know exactly when, I woke
up. I was not sure why I had woken up, but the one thing I did know for
certain was that I was not alone in the room. It is such a difficult sensation
to describe to someone who has not felt it, but I discovered a sense that
I had not used before, my 6th one. A few seconds later I felt the sensation
of my duvet being pulled down, together with the cold air on my skin. The
duvet didnt of course move, but every sensation in my body said that it
did. Then a few seconds later I knew that whatever had happened had finished.</B>
<BR><B>I was not at first sure of what I had experienced. The second night,
I was a bit more certain. The same thing happened, I woke up in the early
hours. This time I was more tense and as the duvet sensation-thing happened
I moved and then I felt a punch as if someone had punched me in the stomach.
Again it didnt last long. This time I was certain of what I had experienced.</B>
<BR><B>I slept in my rented accommodation for a few days and tried to rationalise
things to myself. However, determined to conquer this whatever-it-was I
slept over on a weekday, partly because I had a meeting the next day in
that town. So, when I woke up the third time I was lying on my front with
the corners of the duvet in my hands. I was sweating profusely and as "it"&nbsp;
came over to me, the same sensation of cold air on my back occurred, but
this time there was a whooshing noise as well. And then it was gone.</B>
<BR><B>I couldnt sleep for weeks, and hated going to bed, I used to keep
the light on and the BBC world service on all night. I was given advice
by lots of people who had encountered ghosts, (Britain seems to be full
of ghosts, so there is no shortage of people with stories to tell) and
the advice I was given, was to tell whatever it was firmly but politely
to leave. I wrote out a speech, and rehearsed it, but I really didnt want
to talk to it. Luckily for me the third encounter was also the last encounter.
I think whatever-it-was must have satisfied its curiosity about me.</B>
<BR><B>I did later take the bed down to the tip, just in case it was connected
to the haunting, but it was very uncomfortable anyway.</B>
<BR><B>I have been fascinated by ghost stories from a young age, and having
worked in historical buildings known to have had ghosts I thought I was
insensitive to such things. I always wanted to have a ghostly experience,
but other than being able to tell other people about it, I would rather
not have had it at all.</B>

<BR><B>Demon Guest at My Friend's House</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: wolvellen@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This happened a bit over one and a half years ago at my friend's
house in</B>
<BR><B>Orange County, CA.&nbsp; Her and her family are very worldly people
and don't</B>
<BR><B>really seem to care much for their religion or what protection it
could give</B>
<BR><B>them.&nbsp; This could explain why things of the such that I'm about
tell of</B>
<BR><B>happen at her house.&nbsp; I believe their worldliness opens them
to these</B>
<BR><B>things.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going to spend the night at my friend's
house, and we were going</B>
<BR><B>to sleep in her room.&nbsp; Her room always had an eerie essence
and feeling to</B>
<BR><B>it, so I decided it was best not to sleep on the floor.&nbsp; Her
whole house</B>
<BR><B>seemed emptier than usual that day.&nbsp; Later on, me, my friend,
and her little</B>
<BR><B>brother all slept in her large bed.&nbsp; I tried not to toss and
turn</B>
<BR><B>uncontrollably like I usually did as not to wake the two up.&nbsp;
I looked out</B>
<BR><B>the window and saw the orange street lights shining on the pavement
of the</B>
<BR><B>street.&nbsp; I didn't like looking into great abyss, for it gave
me a frightened</B>
<BR><B>feeling.&nbsp; It was dead silent the whole time, so I turned back
toward the</B>
<BR><B>wall.&nbsp; I couldn't feel my heart in my chest, and I couldn't
hear a thought</B>
<BR><B>in my head.&nbsp; I should have been baking hot, because I was lying
under a</B>
<BR><B>thick comforter with two other people, but my whole body felt rather
cold.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was then that I heard what sounded like a
deep, hollow growl and a</B>
<BR><B>partial moaning sound intertwined.&nbsp; I turned around.&nbsp;
A large silhouette of</B>
<BR><B>the deepest black began moving across the window.&nbsp; It had long,
shaggy,</B>
<BR><B>draping hair all over it's "body" and appeared to have a pair of
ram horns.</B>
<BR><B>It was still dead silent, and it seemed to walk and float across
the window</B>
<BR><B>at the same time.&nbsp; The whole thing appeared to be atleast nine
feet tall.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My house was about twenty minutes away from my
friend's, but it was</B>
<BR><B>around 10:30 at night.&nbsp; I decided to pack my things and head
for home.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>put on my sweatshirt, pants, and boots, put all of my things in
my backpack,</B>
<BR><B>and wrote a note for my friend that I had left.&nbsp; I headed for
the front</B>
<BR><B>door, which was very thick with a rubber seal on it.&nbsp; Of course
it creaked</B>
<BR><B>and my friend's mom woke up.&nbsp; She began telling everyone in
the house</B>
<BR><B>outloud that it was just me making the noises.&nbsp; She asked me
in an ignorant</B>
<BR><B>manner why I had gotten up.&nbsp; I paused and said, "...I want
to go home."&nbsp; So</B>
<BR><B>she let me call my mom, and I asked her to come pick me up.&nbsp;
While I was</B>
<BR><B>waiting, my friend asked me why I wanted to go home.&nbsp; I told
her that I saw</B>
<BR><B>something, and, wouldn't ya know it, she didn't believe me.&nbsp;
Honestly, I</B>
<BR><B>didn't care.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon enough, I heard a honk outside the house.&nbsp;
My friend's mom opened</B>
<BR><B>the door, and I saw my mom's white van in the street.&nbsp; She
smiled and waved.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I bid good-bye to my friend and her mom, and a great wave
of reassurance</B>
<BR><B>came over me as I ran to my mother's car.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as I got in the front seat, I felt warmth
for the first time in</B>
<BR><B>a while.&nbsp; As we pulled out of the street and headed towards
home, my mom</B>
<BR><B>said, "You know what?"&nbsp; I sat back, "What?"&nbsp; She looked
foward, "I had a</B>
<BR><B>feeling that you were gonna call."</B>
<BR><B>I now live in Corona and never plan on going back to her house.&nbsp;
She didn't</B>
<BR><B>treat me that well anyway.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Christmas Angel</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Mlthmp81@wmconnect.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Michael, and im 21 years old. Throughout my childhood
I loved Christmas, i enjoyed getting gifts as a very young child fom "Santa"
My Family also loved the holiday, and took many pictures of me on christmas
morning..Nothing strange about that I know, but what were in these pictures
were, and sometime scared me when i saw them at such a young age. In ALMOST
every picture of me they took on Christmas morning there was something
in the pictures with me. SOme pictures it was orbs, some pictures had things
"flowing" through them.. All these pictures were taken in the same room
of our house (we ALWAYS used the same room for our trees, etc) and except
for one that also had my oldest brother in them, I was the only person
in the room at the time the pictures were taken (or atleast the only one
I remember) My brother kept these pictures aside for me, largly due to
the fact i asked him not to throw them away (as my parents wanted to do)He
still 5 or 6 of these pictures (there were ALOT more) but through the years
most of them were lost or miss-placed..&nbsp; Most of these pictures had
things flowing through them, one (one he still has i believe) has something
going aroudn my head in a circle.. Like i said this use to scare me, now
when I see the pictures I sort of like to think of the thing in them as
my "Christmas Angel". I dont know what was in the pictures with me, but
it never hurt me, or cause me any harm. Just scared me when i saw the pictures..
currently my brother has these pictures back at home.. I moved away about
a year ago so i dont have them right now.. but I going to get him to send
them to me (or drive back home to get them) I dont have them to send you
right now, but I do plan on doing just that as soon as i can get my hands
on them again..</B>
<BR><B>There were a few "things" that happened in the house at other times,
but there wernt many. Doors would slam themselves and from time to time..my
brother (the same one that has the pictures) swears up-and-down his bedroom
floor began "pulsing" one night, and he also says one time he saw our dead
grandmother in our basement... what he says I can not vouch for.. but I
swear by the pictures taken on Christmas mornings, and the fact i never
really "felt alone" when i was there by myself</B>
<BR><B>I realize your site probably gets alot of letters like this, I would
love for this to be posted somewhere on your site (yours is my fav. site
on the entire internet) but I totally understand if my story isnt what
you need posted.. I still plan, however to email you scans of my pictures
as soon as i get them to scan.. I will resend the entire email and attach
them to it then..</B>
<BR><B>If you do post my story however, I ask that you do post my name
along with it.. Because im NOT ashamed to tell this story.. It IS very
special to me, and I for one do believe in ghosts, angels and demons as
well.. but whatever it was with me in that room all those mornings never
harmed me in anyway.</B>
<BR><B>My name is Michael and the house where this happened is right outside
a little town called Montevallo, in Alabama.. and my email address is mlthmp81@wmconnect.com,
and I welcome any questions or comments about my story..</B>
<BR><B>As I said im not ashamed of my Christmas Angel</B><B></B>

<P><B>Attic Bedroom</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: PyroMaster666@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have since moved out of my last house, which was haunted, and very
glad because of it. I've heard ghost stories before, but none so horrible
as my own. I don't know how the ghost got there or why he was there, but
he was there all right and very angry. I lived in that house for a year
before I moved out, the haunting seemed to be just in the attic, where
I had to sleep. The basic stuff started to happen, things disappearing,
my stairway door opening and closing. I had a big curtain separating the
outer part of my attic (with closets all along the wall) and the inner
part (my bedroom). I would lay there at night and watch the curtain move
like someone had the hand on it and was trailing across width of it, nothing
to bad but creepy nonetheless. Strange thing about my ghost is that it
couldn't go done stairs and into the second floor hall, every time it's
shadow, or whatever it decided to be at the time wanted to go down it would
get to the threshold and kinda disintegrate and just float away, weird.
This basic stuff went on for the majority of the time before I moved my
room downstairs. But before that happened it got really, really bad. I
remember one time I had woken up in the middle of the night (I do this
quite often anyway), the ghost was just standing there above me, It lightly
whispered "I will get you" and walked away towards the opposite corner
of the room. That's pretty damn scary, he's gonna get me, I don't think
(luckily he didn't). Another time I had fallen asleep early, when I woke
up it was about 11:00pm, but there was a teenage girl on the bottom corner
of my bed. I sat there completely paralyzed, couldn't move or speak at
all, she slowly turned around and started crawling towards me, I thought
it was just my ghost, but when her hands touched my neck and slowly started
to squeeze I realized this ghost is going to kill me. I snapped out of
it and ran before she could get a good grasp, but before I could get out
of reach she twirled around and lashed out at my right leg, she left three
huge gashes, I still have scars there. The following day I moved out of
that room. A week later my cousin had come over, I told him about my ghost
and he immediately went to the attic, at that time I had noticed a door
that leads into the crawl space above my outer room at the top of the stairs.
Me and my cousin went to opening it, it was painted shut. After we scraped
it all away we realized it had been nailed shut from the inside and there
was no way to get in.</B>

<P><B>Hi,</B>
<BR><B>I have had several true experiences of this nature, and am posting
another small one that happened fairly recently. This took place at the
apartment of my friend in Santa Monica in August of 2002. She has lived
there for 12 years now and the building was built some time in the late
1940s. Most of the tenants stay about 15 years or so, because they were
previously under rent control, and once they move they cannot get rent
control anymore as the city has gotten rid of the program altogether. None
of the current tenants have any idea who this ghost was in life or the
nature surrounding it, so it must predate everyone there. My friend Sarah,
is to be honest somewhat of an airhead, and so she had never in all the
years she has lived there told me of any strange goings on in the apartment.
I found it surprising though even so, as she has known for so long that
I am interested in ghosts and things related. When she first moved there
she wanted me to room with her at the time. We were both young and single
and went out a lot, and it was a great area to live in for that. Her apartment
even though rather old and not very well kept up, is very well set up for
roommates. Each bedroom is at a separate end of the unit, and the unit
is very large, about 1800 square feet. I liked the area and the privacy,
but each time I thought about the&nbsp; vacant room, it just turned me
off. It was very unappealing, but I was never sure why. Her room felt fine
and even happy, but this other room was almost a little dark and negative.
She had many roommates over the years that came and went and she asked
me several times to move there, but I had made up my mind that it had a
negative vibe, although I never told her that. In 1995 she was married
and her husband moved in with his 7 year old son. She has had marital problems
for a long time now, and recently her husband is always out of town. Last
August she asked me to come over and spend the night. It was the first
time I had in about ten years. Her stepson used to have the room, but he
now lives with his mother, so it's basically an office bedroom etc. She
told me that I would be sleeping in there and I was not thrilled, but it
was pretty much my only option. She has a baby now and so she goes to bed
fairly early, even though I usually stay up late. I was bored around midnight,
so I decided to retire to the room. Before I did, she mentioned that the
computer in there was completely shut down and so she hoped that I did
not want to use it. No power saver, but completely shut off. I looked as
I went to bed and sure enough all was powered off. The computer is about
21/2 feet from the side of the bed. A little cramped. I am not the type
to fall asleep easily ever, and so I always lay there for sometime beforehand.
During this time, I heard the computer start up and what sounded like switches
being turned on and also the sounds of someone messing with the keyboard.
I was not at all alarmed for some odd reason and I looked but saw nothing.
I thought, oh well another ghost, even though she has never told me anything
to think this. I felt that it was male also. What was odd was the next
morning. She came into the hallway right at my door and was talking about
various things, and she blurted out that she knew she had a ghost in the
apartment because for years strange things would happen to the TV, and
the CD player and stereo were always operating when not touched. That morning
her DVD player was opening as she walked past it, she said. Then she told
me that her stepson used to say all the time that he saw a man watching
him many times when he was in the shower, through the glass door. This
began I guess not to long after he moved in with his dad, and went on continually.
The bathroom he used was attached to the room I was staying in. I proceeded
to tell her after all of that, about the computer the night before and
how it had turned itself on. The very same morning we were talking about
this, another friend of hers called and mentioned that she had just seen
her resident ghost that morning, that lives in her condo. She recently
bought this condo in Newport Beach. She had seen it before, but not as
clearly. I thought it was very odd that she called at the same time we
were talking about this topic. It all happened in 3's it seemed. Very weird,
but the usual nature of the paranormal.</B>

<BR><B>2 Story Farmhouse</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anutfarm@wmconnect.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My husband John and i used to own a 2 story farm house in the middle
of a small community in Ohio. We bought it from my husbands family&nbsp;
after his dad died. Before we moved in, his bother and sisters kept telling
me about this ghost that supposedly lived in the house. I have always thought
that there is a possibilty of ghosts but i wasn't a true believer until
after we moved into this house.</B>
<BR><B>The family story is that there was supposed to be a man that hung
himself in the house but none of the family knew his name or why. Also
my mother-in-law died from a massive stroke there and my father -in-law
killed himself on the property.</B>
<BR><B>Strange things started happening right after we moved into the house.
One night i couldn't sleep and was in the living room looking out a window
when i felt a presence behind me in the doorway between the living room
and the kitchen. I turned around and there was nothing there but i could
still feel it staring at me. We would have appliances and lights turn themselves
on. On certain nights we could hear footsteps walk through the upstairs
bedrooms and then down the steps to the kitchen. I had a dog in the house
that would never go upstairs even if i went up. The cats in the house wouldn't
go upstairs unless i was with them and they came back down as soon as i
did. Some evenings my dog would stand and bark toward the kitchen and when
i would check it out nothing would be there. My husband would come home
and i had all the lights on in the house because i would get really scared.
It got to the point where i wouldn't get ready for bed when my husband
was on evening shift because of the spirit. it was really creepy.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Metal Box</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: starsoldier40@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>We've both seen this creature. Ree lives in an old house, that, for
some</B>
<BR><B>reason, unknown to us, was painted black. A year ago, we were both
fifteen</B>
<BR><B>and definately into the supernatural. During October, when the ground</B>
<BR><B>freezes up here, we were helping her step-dad dig up the sewage
pipes,</B>
<BR><B>because it had been frozen. It was Halloween.</B>
<BR><B>Well, we were digging after school, before her step-dad got home,
and we dug</B>
<BR><B>up a metal box. It was secured with an old padlock, and painted
on the top,</B>
<BR><B>with the initials K.L.C. Ree got a mallet, and we broke the padlock.
Inside</B>
<BR><B>was a single sheet of paper, reading Speak To Them. It sounded phony
to us,</B>
<BR><B>and we burnt it in the kitchen sink.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; The next day, I crashed on the floor of her room, and we
stayed up</B>
<BR><B>watching a bunch of crappy eighties movies. It was raining heavily
outside,</B>
<BR><B>and the power went out. We were sitting on Ree's bed, and the light
next to</B>
<BR><B>the stairs came on. This surprised us, because, if the power was
on, the TV</B>
<BR><B>and stereo system would be back on, then she said that we hadn't
left the</B>
<BR><B>light on, there. She was right.</B>
<BR><B>We were watching the stairs going upstairs, she lives in the basement,
and</B>
<BR><B>we saw a flash of black. Then something appeared. It scared the
shit out of</B>
<BR><B>us. It was tall, and had raggy, furled wings. It's eyes were red.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone said, after we told
them about it, that it sounded like the</B>
<BR><B>devil himself. Ree, who hasn't been the same since, agreed. So did
I. If I</B>
<BR><B>hadn't seen it for myself, I wouldn't have believed her. But I did
see it,</B>
<BR><B>and we're both still scared to go into the basement. We believe
that the</B>
<BR><B>note, and the demon were associated with each other. We can only
pray we</B>
<BR><B>don't see it again.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Blue Lady</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lilvintagegirl@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This hapened to me when i was at the age of ten.</B>
<BR><B>My cousin, uncle,sister,and step aunt went to Half Moon Bay.</B>
<BR><B>We were driving up devils slide and we were looking for a beach
to go to, to explore.(it was about 4 pm)</B>
<BR><B>Finally we found a little cove right below the Castillery.</B>
<BR><B>We thought nothing of it and we went down to the beach anyways.(supposively
the same beach were the blue lady was killed)</B>
<BR><B>My cousin and I started walking around the beach and started talking
about the lovely sunset taking place...</B>
<BR><B>then out of the corner of my eye i saw beautiful transparent lady
all in blue sitting on the rocks letting the waves hit her. I thought this
was kind of weird because it was really cold.</B>
<BR><B>I asked my cousin if he saw her to, he did.</B>
<BR><B>but my uncle,sister, and step aunt did not see her at all.</B>
<BR><B>My cousin and i got really freaked out and we just ran away to the
other side of the beach. when we got over there</B>
<BR><B>she was standing right in front of us, smiling.</B>
<BR><B>now this got&nbsp; us really freaked and we wanted to go home.</B>
<BR><B>so we did.</B>
<BR><B>when we were walking to the our car i looked back and her face was
right behind me</B>
<BR><B>smiling in a scary way.</B>
<BR><B>I turned around , and told my cousin not to look back.</B>
<BR><B>but he did anyways and said there was no one there.</B>
<BR><B>One the way back home we talked about it but no one believed us.</B>
<BR><B>I know what i saw and it scared me a half to death...</B><B></B>

<P><B>Reality Sets In</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Glen.Stone@toro.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Thanks for your excellent web site. I've enjoyed reading the</B>
<BR><B>stories for a few years now, and never really thought to share</B>
<BR><B>my own experience. But it is what made me a believer, so</B>
<BR><B>I do consider it worth telling.</B>
<BR><B>I had a girlfriend after high school who really had some serious</B>
<BR><B>problems that came to light as our relationship</B>
<BR><B>developed. Besides anorexia, she was a closet alcoholic, and</B>
<BR><B>I finally had to finish off our relationship when I realized</B>
<BR><B>that I wasn't able to help her out of the hole she had buried</B>
<BR><B>herself in.</B>
<BR><B>A few years passed, and I had only seen her once at the</B>
<BR><B>laundromat and she did not look good.</B>
<BR><B>Well, word came to me through a mutual friend that she had</B>
<BR><B>died. I insisted on not knowing any details. It was just too</B>
<BR><B>horrible to imagine how bad it had gotten for her.</B>
<BR><B>But eventually, I had to know if it was true. So I called the</B>
<BR><B>church she had attended and yes, they said that she was</B>
<BR><B>indeed buried in a cemetery a few miles from there.</B>
<BR><B>So I went to see. I had no idea where she was, so I entered</B>
<BR><B>the grounds driving slowly and stopping occasionally to check</B>
<BR><B>the markers. At one of these times, I was standing to the side</B>
<BR><B>of my car. It was late afternoon, so the light was good. And</B>
<BR><B>I vaguely remember asking her, "Where are you?"</B>
<BR><B>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a figure of a young woman</B>
<BR><B>standing in a yellow/white robe looking down. Her hair was</B>
<BR><B>fallen over her face so I couldn't see it. But I knew it was her.</B>
<BR><B>And it was no surprise when I actually turned to look, she was gone.</B>
<BR><B>But I walked the 20 feet or so to find that she had indeed been
looking down upon her grave.</B>
<BR><B>Poor soul. I've been back once since to give her an update of</B>
<BR><B>my life, but I have a fear of keeping her from resting in peace,</B>
<BR><B>so I am reluctant to return. I hope she has found peace.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Lucid Dream or Reality</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jessica_smee@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know whether this qualifies as a ghost
story as such but i will tell it anyway, after first telling you a little
about my family. my parents are pagans and practice witchcraft by choice
and have never hidden this from us. When i was little i would always see
strange things or sense things, but because my parents never made a fuss
when i told them about them, i never thought i was weird. I have seen on
many occasions my dead pets, namely, my favourite and dearest old cat named
tiddles who is the colour of ginger biscuits and is absolutely adorable.
Many times i have seen him sitting watching me, usually just out of curiousity
i guess, and then also wheni have been in bed at night, have felt a cat
jump up on to my lap, but when i have reached down to stroke it, there
has been nothing there. this unnerved me at first but now i am used to
it. the point i am trying to make with this is that all my previous 'paranormal'
experiences have been - if not pleasurable - bearable, which is why the
story i am about to tell now is such a contrast to this, because it was
truley terrifying. here goes.</B>
<BR><B>I was lying in my bed one night, and i honestly cannot recall whether
i was asleep or awake. i believe now that i was somewhere in between, because
that is the only place i could have been vulnerable considering the protection
spells that shroud my home, as courtesy of my parents. Anyway, as i said
i was lying there, and i noticed all of a sudden that the room becacame
very cold, i i started to shiver. I raised my eyes to the ceiling and hovering
above my bed was some kind of manifestation - kind of pearly white. it
did not have human form, but just looked more like a cloud. it was only
when i looked closer did i see the hideous face that seemed to be leering
at me. all of a sudden i couldn't move and the thing - whatever it was,
whooshed down and plunged into my body, and i could feel it surging through
every fibre of my being. the tips of my fingers to the soles of my feel
almost felt alive with some kind of electricity, but not in a good way.
my body was still freezing and i think i began to cry. The next thing i
recall is starting as if waking up and being warm again, but being drenched
in cold sweat with tears sliding down my face. To this day i have never
experienced anything like it, a fact for which i am profoundly grateful.
I have no idea what it was or why it came to me, for to my knowledge i
have never done anything to upset the spirit world. All i know is that
i will remember it until the day i die, because it was one of the most
frightening things that has ever happened to me.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hanby Jr. High School, Gold Hill, Oregon</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jball@pcatv.org</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello all,</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for such an interesting site.&nbsp; I have
seen a few strange things</B>
<BR><B>in my lifetime, some of which defy explanation.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some are easily explained, and that can be the scary
part.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I worked at Hanby Jr. High School in 1990-1991.&nbsp;
The place was built in</B>
<BR><B>1910 and is now on the National Historic register.&nbsp; I loved
that old school.</B>
<BR><B>The building has three stories above ground and a sub-terranian
level that</B>
<BR><B>housed the boiler room, Home Ec. and cafeteria.&nbsp; The teacher's
lunge was</B>
<BR><B>moved down there as well while I worked at Hanby.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been told of happenings there before I ever subbed
at the place as</B>
<BR><B>a janitor and was told that there were a couple of janitors that
locked up</B>
<BR><B>and left well before the end of shift at 9 PM (the night Custodian
works</B>
<BR><B>alone) and never went back.&nbsp; I fell in love with the old building
the first</B>
<BR><B>time I ever set foot in the place.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time I ever noticed anything odd was in the
library, and I</B>
<BR><B>never liked to be in that room after dark.&nbsp; I could never put
my finger on</B>
<BR><B>it but there was something ungood in that room.&nbsp; I would watch
M.A.S.H. on</B>
<BR><B>the TV in the library during my lunch and never felt alone in there,
and the</B>
<BR><B>closer it came to dark the more ominous the feelings became.&nbsp;
Good thing</B>
<BR><B>M.A.S.H. was over by 5 PM each night!&nbsp; This room was always
the first one</B>
<BR><B>that I cleaned as soon as the kids were gone, no way would I be
in there</B>
<BR><B>after the sun went down.&nbsp; One time I did try to talk to whatever
lives in</B>
<BR><B>the Library and tell the spirit that I meant no harm, but as I did
so the</B>
<BR><B>room became close and stuffy, an indication that I took as the spirit</B>
<BR><B>telling me it did not care who I was or what I did, as long as I
left</B>
<BR><B>him/her alone.&nbsp; Fine by me...</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The funniest things always happened on the top floors
of the building.</B>
<BR><B>Whoever's spirit lived on the top floor had a cute sense of humor.&nbsp;
I would</B>
<BR><B>clean from the top down, lugging the vacuum and all with me to the
top and</B>
<BR><B>bouncing down the stairs as I went.&nbsp; I always closed the fire
doors for each</B>
<BR><B>landing as the building had no fire system and the thought of losing
such a</B>
<BR><B>treasure to fire frightened me.&nbsp; My spirit liked to re open
these doors for</B>
<BR><B>me as I did a final walk-around of the building before I went home.&nbsp;
At</B>
<BR><B>least once a week my spirit would have the door open for me as I
walked</B>
<BR><B>through the building.&nbsp; I always thanked the spirit for opening
the doors but</B>
<BR><B>cautioned him/her that they needed to stay closed overnight in case</B>
<BR><B>something happened.&nbsp; Several times I saw movement in rooms
as I finished up</B>
<BR><B>and closed the door to what ever room I was in, never clearly but
always a</B>
<BR><B>definite shape would move near a corner or in the center of the
room.&nbsp; As I</B>
<BR><B>worked alone at night, I enjoyed having the company as I worked
and I</B>
<BR><B>believe that the spirit did as well.&nbsp; Never did I feel threatened
in any</B>
<BR><B>room of the school other than the Library.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The best thing I remember from working there, although
it caused me to</B>
<BR><B>walk up about a hundred stairs a few times, was the evenings that
my spirit</B>
<BR><B>discovered the light switches.&nbsp; Oh joy, now I found myself
with a fun-loving</B>
<BR><B>ghost that knows how to turn lights on!&nbsp; One evening I had
finished with the</B>
<BR><B>outbuildings (Gym, Mobile classrooms, etc) and did my walk around
the campus</B>
<BR><B>in preparation to go home.&nbsp; The building was dark, the quiet
town of Gold</B>
<BR><B>Hill bedding down for the night.&nbsp; I glanced at the building
from the ground</B>
<BR><B>level and all was dark.&nbsp; I finished my walk-around and got
in my pickup to</B>
<BR><B>go home.&nbsp; I always finished the night out by driving around
the block that</B>
<BR><B>the school was no, just to eyeball the place and make sure all was
well.</B>
<BR><B>remember, I loved this school.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me re-affirm that the building was dark as I walked
the grounds.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; As I drove around the corner of the property, I noticed
that the top</B>
<BR><B>floor was lit up, every light turned on.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I stopped my truck and walked up the concrete steps
to the front of the</B>
<BR><B>building, unlocked the doors and went inside.&nbsp; I trudged up
the six flights</B>
<BR><B>of stairs muttering unkind things about my spirit, as I just wanted
to go</B>
<BR><B>home.&nbsp; As usual, the fire doors were open at each landing,
at least making</B>
<BR><B>my trip easier.&nbsp; I thanked my spirit for at least doing that
small favor for</B>
<BR><B>me.&nbsp; I got to the top floor and walked each and every room,
turning lights</B>
<BR><B>off as I went.&nbsp; To say that I felt accompanied would be an
understatement.</B>
<BR><B>As I snapped the light off on the top floor landing I told the spirit
to let</B>
<BR><B>me go home.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked back down all the stairs, closing fire doors
behind me, and down</B>
<BR><B>the steps to the curb where my truck was parked.&nbsp; The building
stood dark.</B>
<BR><B>As I closed the door to my pickup I looked up at my building to
see the</B>
<BR><B>lights to the top floor all come on in unison.&nbsp; I just shook
my head in</B>
<BR><B>laughter and went home.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I called the dayshift custodian the next morning to
ask about the lights</B>
<BR><B>and he told me that the lights were not on when he came in at 5:30
AM,</B>
<BR><B>everything was fine.&nbsp; I guess my spirit figured out that I
was serious about</B>
<BR><B>going home and turned everything off after I left.&nbsp; I now live
in Sandy,</B>
<BR><B>Oregon and work in television in Portland.&nbsp; I am grateful that
I have moved</B>
<BR><B>up the ladder but have to admit that I miss my school, my kids and
my</B>
<BR><B>friendly ghost.</B>

<P><B>I just got an e-mail from my best-friend in D.C..Her husband works
in the Pentagon at night.She said the other night he was on the upper floor,inner
ring of the Pentagon doing his nightly walk.The corridors are very narrow
and poorly lit.He noticed a bathroom door standing open and the lights
were flickering on and off rapidly.He went inside to see what the problem
was and as soon as he entered the bathroom he felt something brushing up
against the back of his neck.He then turned around to see what was behind
him and nothing was there.Then when he turned back around he felt it again.He
describes it as someone rubbing there face on the back of your neck.Then
the poor guy who is usually not easily scared btw ran like hell until he
came upon 2 guys standing at the end of a hall talking about something
brushing them on the neck earlier.He was right next to the crash site of
American Airlines flight 77.</B>

<P><B>My Great Grandma Ginny died when I was four.&nbsp; I don't remember
her very much but my mom says I was close to her.&nbsp; The worst part
about Grandma's death was it happened on my birthday.&nbsp; A few days
ago my mom and my grandparents and I went out for dinner and we started
talking about ghosts, and somehow Ginny got brought into it.&nbsp; My&nbsp;
mom told me that at home after she died i had told her that&nbsp; I had
seen grandma Ginny and she told me good bye.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;My friend Joe's mom told me about her boyfriend Gary.&nbsp;
He had been protective over Joe and like to take joe and show he neat stuff.&nbsp;
When Joe was 5 Gary died. They had been looking for an apartment to move
into so they moved into gary's after he died. Joe's mom didn't tell him
because she didn't think he was ready to deal with death.&nbsp; So Joe
kept asking why Gary hadn't come over and she just said he was on vacation.&nbsp;
Then one day about 8 months later when Joe's mom came home from work Joe
told her Gary had stopped by and said hello.&nbsp; She was freaked out.&nbsp;
They didn't see Gary again for awhile but they always felt like someone
was there looking over them.&nbsp; Then when Joe turned 8 he was sitting
in the living room ( he had already found out Gary was dead) watching tv
a big fuzzy looking shadow of a man show up on the wall and Joe new it
had to be Gary.&nbsp; Then about a month later, Joe woke up in the middle
of the night and saw Gary standing at the foot of his bed.&nbsp; Gary told
him goodbye and he hasn't seen him since</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;My mom and I have always been afraid to go upstairs in my
Auntie Mingo's house.&nbsp; She lives in a very old house out in a small
town called Chesterfield.&nbsp; When you go up the stairs the are plain
and dark and creepy.&nbsp; The stairs always make me get the chills and
i feel like someone is looking at me.&nbsp; I have never actually gotten
past the first three steps because I feel like I'm not wanted up there.&nbsp;
My mom told me that when she was about 14 she was going up the stairs and
as she got to the top something pushed her up against the banister she
decided to go back down pretty quick after that.&nbsp; She said the same
thing to me that she felt like she wasn't wanted in there.&nbsp; The weird
thing is Jim earl lives up there but nothing bothers him.&nbsp; We figure
that whoever or whatever it is that is up there it doesn't want us up there
because we don't live there.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Old White House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Gr8gurluwant19@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I lived in this old white house for almost two years, witnessing
many things.&nbsp; The first time anything happened, me, my best friend
and her younger brother were sitting up playing cards and hanging out because
they live in Lubbock and were going home soon.&nbsp; So we're sitting there
playing cards and we decide to go to bed.&nbsp; I turn off the lights and
turn the radio on.&nbsp; Leslie and Steven get in the full sized bed and
I climb in the twin bed.&nbsp; A few minutes later, the radio turns all
the way down.&nbsp; I ask them if they did it and they swear they didn't
move and I knew that I hadn't done it.&nbsp; I blew it off and went and
turned it back up.&nbsp; A few minutes after I lay back down, it turns
all the way up.&nbsp; After that we decide to all sleep next to each other
with the lights on.&nbsp; Another experiance I had, I was by myself in
my room with my cat.&nbsp; I had just turned the tv off and was laying
down getting ready for bed, when the tv begins to turn on and off repeatedly
by itself.&nbsp; Naturally I freaked out and ran to my mommie.&nbsp; She
went back in with me and it started to go on and off again.&nbsp; We noticed
the cat was behind us flipping out.&nbsp; Basically the only other things
that happened there before we moved out was tvs would turn on when no one
was downstairs, stuff would disappear, and doors would shut.&nbsp; The
other experiance I had was about 2 weeks ago when I was out at a friend's
house.&nbsp; We were doing tarot readings because that is something my
friends are interested in and my best friend who went with me and the guy
that owned the&nbsp; house saw ghosts or spirits in the reflection on the
window.&nbsp; The only reason I know they weren't kidding around was because
the friend that came with me described exactly what the owner saw, and
my friend was extremely freaked out, which doesn't happen often.&nbsp;
Then I felt something tickle my nose.&nbsp; At first, I thought it was
a hair in front of my face but my hair was up in a ponytail and nothing
was hanging out.&nbsp; Well thats all I have for now but I'll send more
if it happens.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Spirits that dwell in our house</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: pinhead@voyager.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>We first noticed unusual sounds and had our lights to go on and off
by themselves right after we moved into this house where my wife's grandparents
use to live. When our children were born things began to heat up around
here with more noises and voices that we couldn't figure out where they
were coming from. My wife and I had a feeling that it was her grandmother
that would turn the lights on in our children's room, because my wife was
upset that her grandmother died and didn't get to see our twin daughters.
We think that it was her way of letting us know that she knew. The basement
has been one of the noisiest places in our house. I use to run outside
of our house when we heard something like a large cardboard box being dragged
across the concrete floor and would try to see if it was someone who was
joking around with us. But when I had my wife watch our door to the basement
and I checked the outside door it would be locked tight and no one had
gotten out upstairs. I would search the whole basement to find nothing.</B>
<BR><B>We often heard footsteps coming up to the basement steps to our
kitchen door. They would just stop there as if the spirit couldn't go any
further or it was just daring you to open it to give you a nice surprise.
One dark stormy night my dog and I had a pretty hair raising moment. My
dog which was a terrier didn't just bark at anything like most dogs do.
He would only bark when something was really there. Well anyway, he began
to growl at the bare wall with his hair raising up, right in the same spot
where my wife's grandmother use to have her rocking chair next to a TV.
He became even more vicious at the bare wall, he was showing his teeth
barking and growling and he had me paying attention like I never had before.
I got a sense that there was something there that I couldn't see but he
definitely could.</B>
<BR><B>He then took off running to our kitchen as if he was chasing whatever
it was right up to the basement door in our kitchen. I knew that I had
to open the door, but I really didn't like the idea. I got a really strange
feeling that I never had before. I opened the door and my dog went absolutely
wild. It was as if he was trying to bite and snap at something that I could
now seem to feel but not yet see. My hair began to stand up on my body.
It felt as if I felt some kind of electrical shock. I hate to admit this,
but I was scared a bit at this point. After about thirty seconds my dog
suddenly stopped barking and acted as if nothing ever happened. But as
for me, I was on guard the rest of that stormy and creepy night.&nbsp;
It wasn't very long after my scare had taken place that I felt as if someone
was urging&nbsp; me to use my tape recorder at night. Just to leave it
running and go to bed. So that is what I did. I got some really cool voices
on it. Before I recorded I asked the spirits in the house if they would
like to leave me a message of some kind. Each time I recorded I got someone
talking into the recorder. I could even tell when a voice was about to
be heard because the recorder would slow down just a bit before the voice
was heard. It happened every time I would record them.</B>
<BR><B>Well then I thought about taking pictures of them. I have some really
cool ones that are very hard to explain, even for the skeptical people
I showed them to they were impressed. One particular photo that I like
the best is the one where I asked for any of the ghosts in our house if
they wanted their picture taken with my son to get next to him and smile.
I didn't get a figure of a person next to my son. It was a yellow looking
square thing with an orb that was in motion, it looks as if it was flying
from the side of the yellow square right over the top of it. I have human
figures on our television set that overlaps the show that was on. I have
another one that looks like a small ball of electricity with little lightning
bolts coming from it. The best one of all is the one where my granddaughter
was showing her Christmas gifts and also in the photo is a human shaped
mist that we all believe is our departed grandson who passed away at five
months old.</B>
<BR><B>If you are interested in these photos I would be glad to send them
in. I have so much more to tell about the strange things that have seen
and have pictures of. Even at the hospital where my other grandchildren
were all born. A really cool yellow and black orb was all around the room.
It wasn't all from the same pack of film either so I really doubt that
it was bad film. Well thanks for letting me post this long winded story.
And everything that I have said is the truth and I have the photos and
other eye witnesses to back me up. Have a great day!</B>

<P><B>I work at Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire, the ancestral home of
the poet Byron.&nbsp; I have worked there for 10 years and many strange
things have happened.&nbsp; But one thing stays in my mind more than any
other.&nbsp; One evening we were actually staging a ghost night with about
40 members of the public.&nbsp; When the group had left the library I had
to change from a dress into a maids outfit that had been hidden for me
behind the curtains.&nbsp; As I got changed I suddenly smelt what seemed
like a match that had been struck.&nbsp; the smell of sulphur was overpowering.
Something was pressing itself into my back and I tried to turn around to
see what was behind me, every hair on my body stood on end and the room
was icy cold, I felt instinct telling me to get out of the room quickly,
which I did.&nbsp; I have had many experiences in this beautiful house
but that scared me and I have never forgotton it.</B>

<BR><B>A WIERD HOUSE IN SUMMER 1969</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MR_LOXLEY@BTINTERNET.COM</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is a true story..</B>
<BR><B>Many years ago in 1969 , my family wanted to move house to a place
called Thorpe Bay , Essex in UK England.</B>
<BR><B>It was a gorgeous summers August day, very sunny and hot - and as
a family we were all feeling quite happy and excited at the prospect of
seeing this one particular house.</B>
<BR><B>It was located by a golf course, and of mock Tudor style building.
Although it was definitely more of the 19th C&nbsp; period. But it had
a fabulous staircase of oak and 4/5 bedrooms.Very big and beautifully presented.</B>
<BR><B>I was about 11 nearing 12 yrs old.</B>
<BR><B>We entered the house, and it was very nice, Sun streaming in through
the large windows...we inspected each room downstairs, each of the six
members of the family following 'mother' through like ducks waddling along
in a secure group.</B>
<BR><B>All was quite fine, until we gotten to the principal bedroom. It
faced North - east and the views were un interrupted - except for a couple
of tree branches. In other words, the windows were not blocked to make
the room feel cool or anything.When I entered this room, it was absolutely
freezing. As we spoke, our breath was clearly visible as if we were outside
in a mid winter day. Yet it was the middle of summer- August and baking
hot outside.</B>
<BR><B>I played merry hell about this room and told my Mom&nbsp; and Pop
that it felt horrible. She looked at the windows which had by now gathered
ice on the window frames.</B>
<BR><B>What on earth do you think caused this, it is something I will never
forget?</B>
<BR><B>I am relieved to tell you, my parents also agreed that the room
felt odd, therefore we did not buy it.</B>
<BR><B>I did hear at my school, many months later that the house was used
for black magic practices...could this be the reason I wonder.?</B>

<BR><B>Crickets</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sue-allyson-doggies@msn.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;I am 12 years old, and here is my story (yes, I have about
a billion more) about my spirit:</B>
<BR><B>While I was in France with my dad, and we were shopping for gifts
for other family. I found something I liked, and told him what it was:
It was a little box with plastic crickets inside, and when you opened the
box, they would make noise. When you closed it the noise would stop. He
bought it for me, which now I think of as an annoying mistake. When I brought
it to my house in the USA, I had put it on my stereo speaker. (no, the
wire hadn't been already cut.) The next two mornings, I heard the noise
of the little crickets inside the box,&nbsp; but, the box wasn't open.
It had went on for a while, and then, I got sick of it. It stopped for
about 3 months, then started going off and on again. It still does this,
and every once in a while, I let it go on and on, knowing someone likes
to play with it...</B>
