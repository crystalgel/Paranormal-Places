<b>Wauwatosa, Wisconsin</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: KrKingston@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>The house I grew up in was next door to an old farmhouse.&nbsp; (The
original farmhouse that belonged to the tract of land that our neighborhood
was built on)&nbsp; A nice old man with the last name of Henri lived there.&nbsp;
We kids called him Papa Henri.&nbsp; Papa Henri loved his garden which
took up every square inch of his yard, front and back.</b>
<br><b>My bedroom overlooked his yard and I often watched him from my window.&nbsp;
The back door on the old house would squeek when it opened and slam loudly
when it shut.&nbsp; (Very distinctive sounds!)&nbsp; Papa Henri eventually
took ill and died in a nursing home.&nbsp; His house was vacant for maybe
4 or 5 months.&nbsp; After he died, occassionally I would hear the door
of his house squeek open and slam shut.&nbsp; Sometimes I was by the window
when I heard it and when I looked nothing was there.&nbsp; I secretly wondered
if it might be him but I figured it was the wind or something.&nbsp; When
he was alive he would whistle while he worked in the garden.&nbsp; On a
few occassion after his death I thought I heard him whisetling in the garden
which was now overgrown.&nbsp; I wrote that off as my imagination.</b>
<br><b>A family with two girls bought Papa Henri's old house.&nbsp; Both
parents worked so the girls were alone at the house until 6pm or so each
night.&nbsp; One summer afternoon some of the neighborhood boys were playing
in their yard (which was now all grass and no garden) and they all started
screaming and yelling.&nbsp; They said they saw a round thing float past
one of the upstairs windows and then they heard what was described as "a
ball bouncing down the stairs".&nbsp; Both of the girls (and thier dog)
who lived there were outside with the boys and thier parents were not home
yet.&nbsp; The house was definatly supposed to be empty.&nbsp; I did not
belive them nor did I belive one of the girls when she came running over
to our house one afternoon insisting that she heard someone moving around
in the house.&nbsp; My dad went to check it out and found nothing.</b>
<br><b>Eventually I became good friends with one of the girls (Heather)
and spent much time at thier house.&nbsp; We were in fifth of sixth grade.&nbsp;
The winter olympics were on tv and we were watching the figure skating
competition.&nbsp; The announcers were annoying so we were watching with
the sound completely off.&nbsp; Me, her, and her dog were the only ones
in the house and we were all in the same room.&nbsp; While watching tv
in silence I heard distinct footsteps coming down the stairs.&nbsp; They
were real!&nbsp; I counted each step as I heard it!&nbsp; I was not scared
because I thought it was her Dad.&nbsp; I looked at Heather and she</b>
<br><b>just sat there like she didn't hear it.&nbsp; I said to her "I just
heard your Dad come downstairs".&nbsp; She looked confused and I insisted
"I just heard someone come down the stairs!"&nbsp; She got scared and said
"We are alone in the house!!"&nbsp; We fled in terror and again my Father
checked the house and found nothing.</b>
<br><b>Heather did not hear the heavy footsteps that I heard but she believed
me because she had heard them on other occassions when no-one else did.&nbsp;
She also went on to tell me that many nights she would see a black dog
come into her bedroom, walk around the room, approach her, lay down etc
etc.&nbsp; The family pet was a big black dog named Babe so she assumed
it was Babe and was not scared by it.&nbsp; One night the black dog approached
her in bed and she called her dogs name (Babe) and she heard Babe stir
in his sleep from across the room.&nbsp; She got very scared because if
Babe was accross the room then what was this black thing in the shadows
moving around right next to her??&nbsp; She said she saw alot of black
shadows moving around her room and she would just try to ignore them.</b>
<br><b>After they moved out of that house a new family moved in with a
little girl that I would babysit for.&nbsp; Their TV room was right at
the bottom of the stairs (where all the ghostly footsteps were heard) and
sometimes at night I could feel something standing in the dark at the top
of the stairs.&nbsp; I prayed to God and begged the spirit not to terrorize
me.&nbsp; If I had heard those footsteps while I was alone in that house
I think I would have lost my mind!</b>

<p><b>Tommy</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: littlewillow73@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was 4 years old, we (mother, father, and myself) moved to
a small</b>
<br><b>house in what I considered "the country".&nbsp; Moving from the
city to the</b>
<br><b>country at such a young age (and being an only child to boot), I
became a</b>
<br><b>little lonely.&nbsp; With no other children my age around to play
with, I spent a</b>
<br><b>lot of time playing outside.&nbsp; That's when I met Tommy.&nbsp;
He was a year older</b>
<br><b>than me, but he was lonely too, so we quickly became the best of
friends.</b>
<br><b>Our house was located in a hollow about 1/4 mile off of the main
road...the</b>
<br><b>only other people living in the same hollow was our landlord, his
wife, and</b>
<br><b>their 13 year old daughter.&nbsp; Because there was no fear of me
running out and</b>
<br><b>playing in the road, my father pretty much let me play for as long
as I</b>
<br><b>wanted outside by myself while my mother was at work (my father
worked 3rd</b>
<br><b>shift at the time).&nbsp; Tommy and I became inseparable.&nbsp;
He normally went home</b>
<br><b>around 5...the time my mother got off of work.&nbsp; One night,
after about a</b>
<br><b>month of playing with Tommy every day, I convinced him to stay for
dinner.</b>
<br><b>When Mom came home, I took him inside and asked if he could stay
for a while</b>
<br><b>longer.&nbsp; I'll never forget the look on her face.&nbsp; It was
a look of complete</b>
<br><b>surprise, but being Mom, she never missed a beat and said sure.&nbsp;
That night</b>
<br><b>after Tommy went home, I overheard my father ask Mom why she encouraged
me</b>
<br><b>with my "imaginary friend".&nbsp; Mom calmly told him that she didn't
believe</b>
<br><b>that it would scar me for life to have an imaginary friend for a
while until</b>
<br><b>I went to school and made new friends to play with.&nbsp; I waited
until the next</b>
<br><b>morning to talk to Mom about it.&nbsp; I emphatically told her that
Tommy was not</b>
<br><b>imaginary, he was real.&nbsp; Tommy continued to come inside the
house...but only</b>
<br><b>when Mom was there.&nbsp; He told me that he didn't care too much
for my father,</b>
<br><b>because he felt that he didn't like Tommy.&nbsp; We would go into
my playroom and</b>
<br><b>play for hours and hours.&nbsp; When Mom would bring me a snack,
she would always</b>
<br><b>bring one for Tommy too.&nbsp; Then (and I didn't know this until
years later,</b>
<br><b>when I mentioned Tommy to Mom...I guess I was about 14) one day
Mom was</b>
<br><b>outside working in the garden while Tommy and I were playing together
at the</b>
<br><b>edge of the woods.&nbsp; Our landlord came over and started up a
conversation</b>
<br><b>with Mom.&nbsp; While they were talking, Tommy and I started up
a game of tag.</b>
<br><b>There was a creek that ran behind our house and I got a little too
close to</b>
<br><b>the edge of the bank where there was about a 6-foot drop to the
creek.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>didn't know how, but Tommy was able to reach me in time and keep
me from</b>
<br><b>falling into the creek.&nbsp; Mom and Rusty (the landlord) saw how
close I had</b>
<br><b>come to falling into the creek and they ran over.&nbsp; After making
sure I was</b>
<br><b>okay, Mom sent me inside to get something to drink...Tommy went
with me.</b>
<br><b>After I was inside, Rusty told her to make sure she kept an eye
on me when I</b>
<br><b>was around the creek.&nbsp; The family who lived in our house before
us had a 5</b>
<br><b>year old boy who fell off the bank and into the creek.&nbsp; When
he had fallen,</b>
<br><b>he had hit his head on a rock and drowned.&nbsp; Rusty's final words
on the</b>
<br><b>conversation with my mother??&nbsp; Tommy was such a good little
boy, it</b>
<br><b>devastated all of us when he died 4 years ago...I just don't want
anything</b>
<br><b>to happen to Meghan, so make sure you keep an eye on her.&nbsp;
Even though that</b>
<br><b>was 22 years ago, I still remember Tommy.&nbsp; There are times
when I even go to</b>
<br><b>the same house (still owned by Rusty), sit on the creek bank behind
the</b>
<br><b>house, and talk to Tommy.&nbsp; I don't see him that often anymore...in
fact, I</b>
<br><b>haven't actually seen him in about 5 or 6 years...but I always feel
him</b>
<br><b>sitting beside of me while I'm there and I feel him follow me to
my car when</b>
<br><b>I get ready to leave.&nbsp; I always feel a sense of sadness as
I get into the</b>
<br><b>car to leave.&nbsp; It feels as though he's sorry that I'm leaving
so soon.</b>
<br><b>Everytime before I leave, I pull the car over beside of the oak
tree that</b>
<br><b>stands beside the driveway, roll the window down, and softly say...don't</b>
<br><b>worry Tommy, I'll be back soon, I promise.&nbsp; Sometimes it takes
a few seconds</b>
<br><b>(and once or twice even minutes), but I never leave until I feel
him smile</b>
<br><b>and smell the scent of mulberries (we used to climb the mulberry
tree</b>
<br><b>together in the back yard).&nbsp; In fact, it's getting time that
I go back to</b>
<br><b>see him again.&nbsp; I just wanted to share this ongoing experience
with you.</b>

<p><b>Old Purdy Cemetery</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; atlantis584@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Purdy, TN. Old Purdy Cemetery</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purdy is a small community
in McNairy County, in the southern part of</b>
<br><b>West Tn. It's is located between Selmer and Adamsville. I have been
to, and</b>
<br><b>taken pictures of the cemetery. The oldest grave there is around
the 1840s.</b>
<br><b>I have also been there at night, several nights, with my grandmother.
Once</b>
<br><b>we talked to one of her good friends that grew up in Purdy. People
say you</b>
<br><b>can go there at night and hear sounds of old Confederate soliders.
Also,</b>
<br><b>many people have witnessed the ghosts of slaves that were forced
to bury the</b>
<br><b>dead. Many locals don't go there, because they are affraid of the
cemetery.</b>
<br><b>However, everytime I go back to visit, I make sure I go to the cemetery.
The</b>
<br><b>original iron fences are still there, and the grave markers are
still</b>
<br><b>standing. Most of them anyway. To get to the cemetery you have to
go down an</b>
<br><b>old dirt road, which is about a mile long. I have heard things there.
Sounds</b>
<br><b>like little children playing. Once my grandfather's friend saw a
man, woman,</b>
<br><b>and child riding in a horse pulled wagon. They had on old cloths
that looked to be</b>
<br><b>from the 1800s. He was clearing some trees from the road when he
saw them.</b>
<br><b>All of his machines went dead, and they didn't start working again
till the</b>
<br><b>wagon was out of sight. There is also a house across from the cemetery
that</b>
<br><b>is believed to be haunted. It's said that a Union general living
there when</b>
<br><b>the Union army came into Tn. He was also said to be a evil man.
One night</b>
<br><b>after the battle of Shiolh, he was shot by Confederate supporter
at the top</b>
<br><b>of the stairs on the second floor. People say that his blood has
stained the</b>
<br><b>floor in the spot he died in, and everytime someone cleans it up,
it comes</b>
<br><b>back a few days later. If your every in McNairy County, ask someone
where</b>
<br><b>Purdy is. I don't know what the name of all the roads to get there
is, but</b>
<br><b>it's not that hard of a place to find.</b>

<p><b>The Colony Addition, in Cherokee,Iowa</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mtallman@ncn.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>A house that was formerly located in the flood plain in Cherokee,
Ia., originally was located on East Maple St. In that location the owners
reported strange things happening. The mother reported that her pieces
of her jewelry would come up missing. She said she always kept these pieces
in her jewelry box. She would ask her family if they knew where the individual
piece was that was missing. But none of them would know. Days, weeks, and
sometimes months would pass, and despite looking all over the house they
could never find the jewelry. Then out of the blue the jewelry would be
found back in the jewelry box, and know one knew how it got there.&nbsp;
At other times their back light would turn on all by itself, and once the
VCR turned off and ejected the video they were watching even though the
movie wasn't done playing and no one had ahold of the remote control.After
the flood of 1993, they decided to move the house to higher ground. When
they tore out some stud walls in the basement to prepare to move the house;
they found a pair of children's glasses and the eye glass case inside the
covered up stud wall.&nbsp; They also found numerous old razor blades,
as well as some small children's toy cars. Do you think the ghost haunting
that house had been hiding belongings and forgot to give these back to
some of the previous home owners?</b>
<br><b>When the house was finnally moved to it's present location in The
New Colony Addition it was built on part of, or very near the site of the
Old Pioneer Settlement and it's Fort The owners report hearing footsteps
down stairs when they know the house is all locked up and they know no
one is down their. The question is, did the same ghost move with their
house when it was moved from the flood plain, or have they got a new set
of ghosts that are from Fort?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They
said they noticed an elderly neighbor lady outside her house one day locking
her door, and then trying to open it. And&nbsp; then repeating this behavior,
it was felt that she too must be hearing intruders in her house when she
knows it is locked and secure. Previous residents to that area of town
have reported seeing ghost Indians on horse back riding around their house
and banging on there windows.Cherokee has a long history of ghostly activity,
but getting people to admit to it is another story!</b>

<p><b>Spirits Watching</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: durla1@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was 10 my parents bought their first home. I think the thing
was haunted, and I think it was one of those non-human spirits mentioned
in this website. The house had a general cold feel about it, not the temperature,
just a cold feeling about the house. What ever lived there, resided on
the second floor. It consisted of three bedrooms, a bath, a hall, and the
attic. Anyone who went upstairs alone will tell you the same thing. You
could feel someone just behind you, stairing a hole through your body.
The only thing I ever remember happening, where the thing kinda showed
itself, was late at night. We were all sleeping and were awoke to a repeated
loud noise from upstairs.(slam, slam,slam). It was the window at the top
of the steps, opening and slamming, over and over. My dad told me it was
the wind, but his face said different. I have never since seen the wind
open and close a double hung window. That window over looked the driveway.
Years later my mom told me when we moved out, she went back to get her
plants, alone. She gathered her things in the house, got into the car,
and could feel someone watching her from that window. I have not had any
experiences since. I came across this site and thought the story might
interest someone.</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;Spirits Guides and a Gift</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Plunky@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi my name is Angy and hopefully you will read this beforehand because
i had almost finished telling you my story when i accidently hit some button
and everything either got erased or got sent to you before i could finish.
so if you get this one this should be the complete story. Sorry!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My visit w/ a "ghost" happened 11 years ago when i was 15. I had moved
in w/ a foster family and after i had got settled in, she decided to visit
me. One night while i was sleeping i heard someone call my name. I woke
up and looked towards the bottom of my bed and there she was. She stood
about 3 feet above the ground and was transparent. While i freaked and
covered my head.(the i can't see you so you can't see me logic!)&nbsp;
Well over the next 6 months she continued to visit me.</b>
<br><b>I never told anybody because i didn't want anyone thinking that
i was off my rocker! Well one night I had to go the bathroom. I didn't
like using the bathroom closest to my room for some unknown reason. So
i headed to the other bathroom on the other side of the house. I didn't
bother to turn on any lights because there was a nite lite in there.&nbsp;
As i was heading back to my room i saw her! She was coming towards me!
I kept&nbsp; walking towards her. next thing i knew she passed through
me. I lost my breath for a second because of how cold she was. I wasn't
really frightend or uncomfortable in any way. I headed straight for my
room though! The next day i finally decided to tell someone about my visits.
I decided on telling my foster-mom. And instead of geting "oh my god you
are nuts!" i got a "oh so you've met her too?" HUH? Apparently she like
to visit only the women of the house. So for the next year i learned to
just live w/her. I know longer live there but i'm sure she still does.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have another story that happened recently.
i wouldn't call it a ghost story, just a loved one on the other side&nbsp;
trying to comfort a loved one on this side.&nbsp; I guess you can say that
it all began when i was 9 or 10. Some lady came up to me.( I have no clue
who she was.) she told me that i had a great gift and that if i don't practice
i will lose it. I thought she was nuts and dismissed it. But throughout
the years it stayed in my mind. Well over the past couple of years i have
had a more open mind about "unexplained" things and i have been at more
peace w/ my life ever since. Well i decided to share these thoughts w/
my husband's cousin. He thought i was a wee bit nuttty. Well in Nov.of
99 he passed away quite suddenly. He was only 31 and one minute he was
standing in his kitchen and the next he was dead on the floor. Well he
left behind his mother and his 12 year old son for her to raise. His mother
had been unconsolable and just plain devasted (he was her only child).
Well one night in Jan. of this year my spirit guide ,Scott, kept yapping
something about opening up my eyes. ( i know this probably sounds crazy)&nbsp;
I didn't quite understand. Well i went out into the garage out back when
i was coming back in i saw him , my husband's&nbsp; cousin, Mike. He told
me I knew you'd finally see me you little s---! I had</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;to blink my eyes a couple of times. I thought i was out of
my mind!!!&nbsp; He goes "tell my mom 'hi'". I walked into the laundry
room w/out saying a word. I&nbsp; heard Scott tell me to please listen
to him. So i walked back out and stared at the place where mike was sitting.
He just smiled at me and i went back into the house. Well a couple of hours
had passed and i was washing dishes when he started begging me to please
say hi for him. My spirit guide scott said that it was very important for
her , Mike's mother, to hear it. See Scott talks to me in my right ear
and mike's voice was coming from my left. I was starting to panic because
i have never had anything like this happen&nbsp; to me before.&nbsp; See
i was worried that if i said anything to his mom everyone including my
husband would insist on having my head examined! Well after a few minutes
of this comotion going on i felt a peace come over me. Mike asked me to
ask his mom if he liked to sit outside in the chair</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;and listen to what was going on inside the house. So, i asked.
She ,mike's mom, goes "yea, why?" so i told her that he want's to say hi.
She was so excited!! She told me that she wasn't surprised that he came
to me and not her. Well by now Mike had more to say then hi. I could hear
him just rammbling on about how happy he was but she neads to think more
about herself and his son. See i had no idea that she was thinking of taking
her life and that at times she would go to his grave and come home feeling
more lonely then before. He had one final message for me to give to her.
So i go " if you want to</b>
<br><b>feel closer to him don't go to his grave he's not there. just go
and get a brown blanket and wrap up in and go sit out back on the patio"
All of a sudden a HUGE smile came across her face. She goes" why did you
just say that?" i told her because Mike told me to. Why i asked her . She
goes "well Mike loved to wrap up in that blanket and sit outside." And
from then on she sits outside w/him and she is finally at peace.</b>

<p><b>Satan Caves</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DGall79@webtv.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>New York-Brewster-Satan Caves</b>
<br><b>The satan caves are old mines on the land of an old abandoned summer
camp.&nbsp; To get there you need to walk through the woods, preferably
in early spring when the grass hasn't begun to grow much, for about two
miles.&nbsp; Hopping over fallen trees and stopping every few feet to pick
ticks off yourself.&nbsp; The ground is littered with empty beer cans and
cigarette packs from partying teenagers who think its a cool place to get
together.&nbsp; Once you arrive at the caves, it is hard to get near them
because of the muddy ground that will swallow you whole, not literally
but you will sink pretty deep.&nbsp; The caves are on the backside of a
mountain and the openings to them are about four and a half feet high.&nbsp;
You can't see a thing inside, even with a flashlight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One time during my high school days, two friends of mine decided that they
wanted to see the place for themselves and they invited me along for the
trip.&nbsp; After school we packed our back packs full of snacks and gatorade
and rode our bikes five miles to see the infamous place.&nbsp; It was also
rumored, this comes from the mouths of my parents, that a kid they went
to school with was beaten buy a couple of jocks and left to die in one
of the caves during the 1970's.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my friends and I got there, we didn't know
what to do.&nbsp; We just stood there looking at the caves from a distance
of about fifty feet.&nbsp; That was when I heard a girls voice say the
words "help me".&nbsp; I passed it off the first time I heard it because
the two guys didn't seem to notice it, but when I heard it again, the young
girls voice saying"help me" this time a little louder than the previous
time, my two friends did here it and they immediately looked at me.&nbsp;
I knew it was real once they heard it too, and we bolted out of there as
fast as we could without looking back. On our way home a series of strange
occurences happened that spooked us even more.&nbsp; When we made it to
the main road, one of my friends was covered from head to toe with ticks,
but neither I nor the other kid had even one tick on us.&nbsp; Then we
began to ride our bikes again and the same kid who was covered with the
ticks fell for no apparent reason and cut the palms of his hands, very
close to the wrists.&nbsp; I fell off my bike almost immediately after
him and scraped my bare knees.&nbsp; When I looked up at the other kid
who had not fallen, I immediately noticed the crucifix dangling around
his neck.&nbsp; He was the one who made it home without a scratch or even
a single tick stuck to himself.</b>

<p><b>Psychic Help</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MelsieP@Yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Melissa, and my husband and I have recently purchased
our first new home.&nbsp; First of all, let me say that neither of us have
ever given much thought to the paranormal or spirits, etc, and before our
experience, we're both pretty doubtful.&nbsp; Shortly after moving into
our new home, still in the unpacking stage, I was putting up some antique
china into our china cabinet.&nbsp; Shortly after beginning unwrapping
the dishes, I felt a cold chill around me and the hair on my arms and neck
stood up and I had chill bumps all over.&nbsp; Thinking that it was just
me, I kept on.&nbsp; The feeling of someone being right beside of me was
overwhelming, and I was uncomfortable to the point that I had to stop and
move away from the cabinet.&nbsp; Going back later to finish unpacking
the dishes, it happened again, only stronger.&nbsp; For the next few days,
I felt the same coldness and chills at different parts of our home.&nbsp;
Finally being so uncomfortable with it, I told my skeptical husband; who
didn't criticize but hadn't experience anything like that himself.Within
a couple of weeks after this started happening, I began to feel the feeling
of something walking on our bed at night.&nbsp; Thinking that maybe our
cat was on our bed, I would move my feet or swat at the covers where I
felt the weight on the bed to make her get off the bed, only to find that
nothing was there.&nbsp; Time and again, several times per week this would
happen.&nbsp; Many times, I would get out of bed, turn on the light and
search the room for the cat, only to find nothing was there.&nbsp; About
a month after this feeling of weight walking on our bed, my mother in law
was visiting at our home. My husband was talking to her and said, "Mom,
I swear that there is something walking around on our bed."&nbsp; Hearing
this for the first time from him caused me to shutter, realizing that what
he was describing was the same thing.&nbsp; I then told him that I had
been experiencing the very same thing, and we shared our experiences with
one another.&nbsp; We had a meeting together and left our home closed and
locked, but came home to find the ash window on the fireplace open with
sunlight pouring in.&nbsp; No one had been there in the house except the
two of us earlier that morning.&nbsp; Two nights after this conversation,
my husband was</b>
<br><b>awakened out of sleep by the feeling of someone having sat down
on my bed beside of him.&nbsp; Thinking that it was me, he reached for
me and nothing was there.&nbsp; Two more days after this, I was awakened
at 12:36am by the mattress at the foot of the bed poking my feet.&nbsp;
When I realized that I was awake and not dreaming, I sat bolt upright in
bed, pulling my feet toward me, and I could still feel the end of the bed
moving.&nbsp; Afraid to get out of bed to turn on a light, I finally fell
back to sleep.&nbsp; (My husband and I work different hours with him often
leaving for work around 2am, so I was reluctant to awaken him) At 4:15am,
the same thing happened again.&nbsp; I moved to the other side of the bed,
and eventually fell back to sleep.&nbsp; The next day, I told&nbsp; my
husband what had happened.&nbsp; I called his mother and told her about
it, and she told me that she had a friend that was a psychic and she was
going to talk to her about what was happening.&nbsp; The psychic came and
'excorcised' (not sure of the right word) our home.&nbsp; She said that
there was a woman named Yvonne and that she was grieving&nbsp; and afraid,
and that her fear had kept her from passing through this world to another.&nbsp;
She said that she was very small (which explained the light weight of that
of a person, but heavier than a cat or animal).&nbsp; She also told us
that Yvonne was&nbsp; trying to communicate with us that she was there
and was ready to leave, that she had opened the ash window on the fireplace.&nbsp;
After the psychic left, I could no longer feel the presence or cold spots
in the places that I had before. That evening, because of my husband's
work schedule, he went to bed fairly early, I went to bed hours later.&nbsp;
After going to bed, I began to hear clicking sounds and snapping sounds.&nbsp;
I heard something that sounded like a screen door slam, then could hear
what sounded like the movement of people walking, and I had the feeling
of being stared at.&nbsp; I finally retreated</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;to the living room.&nbsp; The next day at work, I called my
mother in law to have her call this psychic back.&nbsp; After talking to
her, she called me back and said that she psychic believes that there is
a portal or opening in our house.&nbsp; This is where we stand now.&nbsp;
We are going to arrange for her to come back and attempt to close it. All
of this has really been exhausting, I'm petrified to sleep and very uncomfortable
going into our bedroom, where most of&nbsp; the things have happened.&nbsp;
Hopefully, all of this will be ended soon.&nbsp; I find that it is interesting,
and that I have questions that I wish I could ask the or 'these' entities;
I'm having a hard time understanding why this has happened to us,&nbsp;
and if life will go back to normal.If you have any questions, please feel
free to email me at MelsieP@Yahoo.com.&nbsp; I've enjoyed the website and
have gathered some interesting reading information from here.</b>

<p><b>Ohio Haunts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: barnacleboy@mindspring.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Paul Kepp, and the summer when I was
13, my mother and I bought a</b>
<br><b>house in North Lima, Ohio and I was more than excited to see it.&nbsp;
When we pulled</b>
<br><b>up I ran inside the house to find a deserted house with no furniter;
no nothing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Naturally I wanted to get a feeling for the house and I began
exploring the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; The layout was like this, you had a screen door that
was in the back of</b>
<br><b>the house (the main entrance we used) and led into the kitchen,
to your right</b>
<br><b>and in front of you was a door that led to the basement (a place
I never</b>
<br><b>ventured in my entire time (three months) in the house.) and to
the far right</b>
<br><b>was a door that led to my room and to the right of that was the
bathroom.&nbsp; Going</b>
<br><b>the other way through the kitchen takes you to the dining room and
the living</b>
<br><b>room was next to that in an open area and then that led back to
my room on the</b>
<br><b>other side. (a complete circle)&nbsp; Between the living and dining
room was the main</b>
<br><b>door (That ended up being blocked by furniture, go figure) and opposite
of that</b>
<br><b>were the steps that led upstairs.&nbsp; a good amount of steps would
come to a small</b>
<br><b>square that would turn 180 and the stops would go up the other way.&nbsp;
At the top</b>
<br><b>there was a room that was on the left (my moms), a room to my right
(my Aunt's),</b>
<br><b>and a center room (storage).&nbsp; I first went inside the middle
room and I looked</b>
<br><b>out the window and I immediately got hte feeling like somoene was
behind me and</b>
<br><b>it gave me a very threatening feeling, the hair on the back of my
neck stood up</b>
<br><b>and I bolted outside.&nbsp; This experience was 5 years ago and
I can't tell what</b>
<br><b>happened first, last, et cetera, but among the things I encountered
were</b>
<br><b>footsteps at night that would last for quite awhile almost everynight.&nbsp;
I once</b>
<br><b>found a coke can crushed and sitting at the first step leading upstairs,
I had</b>
<br><b>one of those push-button TV's that went haywire (the button's pushed
themselves)</b>
<br><b>while playing Nintendo. I had a cat that would sit at the base of
the steps and</b>
<br><b>peer upstairs for the longest time.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure it was
almost every night I</b>
<br><b>spent in my mom's room and one night I seen a spectre of a farmer
mumbling (I</b>
<br><b>was surprised that no photo's on your site showed a complete person
but this is</b>
<br><b>what I saw and it scared me shitless.) I may be forgetting an experience
or two</b>
<br><b>but those were the big ones; my aunt experienced her bed moving
and layed down</b>
<br><b>her keys and turned around to grab them and they were gone.&nbsp;
My mother seen</b>
<br><b>everything in the storage room in disarray with paper everywhere,
she also had a</b>
<br><b>skeleton key pushed into her hand while sleeping. This was my only
experience</b>
<br><b>with a haunting but it made a believer out of me.</b>

<p><b>While visiting a friend that had recently inherited an old house
near Fort</b>

I noticed a</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;When I inquired as to whether or not anyone else was in the
house, my host</b>
<br><b>said that we where all on the porch. Just as he finished his statement,
a rather large mirror fell from the wall and crashed to the floor in the
hallway between the porch and the kitchen. My host said that it must be
old uncle harold, and laughed it off as a joke.</b>
<br><b>the next day, while looking through some old photos of the house,
I</b>

he had died a</b>

<p><b>My Story of my Apartment</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tea_rose_@go.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have always been able to "feel" spirits. I can go into a house
or even pass one and know that it is being occupied by those other than
the living. I have lived in a few places that have been haunted. One of
them was when I was 14 years old.</b>
<br><b>The house was converted into apartments, but in the 1800's it was
a whole house and the people who lived there were killed execution style.
Bound and blind-folded and shot in the back of the head.</b>
<br><b>We lived in the upstairs apartment and one day I was lying on the
couch reading the paper and all of a sudden I got this intense pain in
the back of my head, like I was shot. I started screaming and&nbsp; nobody
could figure out what was wrong, and I couldnt tell them. I "saw" my cousin,with
whom I am very close, running down the road and it was only then that I
stopped screaming and the pain started to go and I could tell someone what
had happened.</b>
<br><b>There were two men and one woman that occupied the house. The men
I only had seen once but the woman I had many contacts with. I had seen
her many times around my cousins daughter's crib, watching the baby, touching
her. The woman wanted to take the baby with her, she had fell in love with
her and we had to watch the baby closely, not knowing what the woman might
do.</b>
<br><b>One night, my cousin, her fiance, a friend of ours and myself went
upstairs to the bedroom, which was probably their attic in their time and
sat in the dark until the woman came. I felt her skirt brush my leg. I
asked her to please leave the baby alone and to leave us alone and to go
back where she had came from and find peace. She didnt leave for about
15 mins, we could feel her walking around, like pacing the floor, trying
to make a decision. After she left and&nbsp; we had turned on the lights,
we saw that things had been disturbed. My handlotion had been opened and
spilt onto the dresser, my undergarments and clothes had been pulled out
of the drawers and dropped on the floor. Obviously she was upset, but she
wasnt violent.</b>
<br><b>The men or at least one of them wasnt so nice. My cousins fiance
was possessed by one of them and I watched a mild mannered man turn into
a nasty, vulgar, angry person, who truly scared everyone, myself included.
He did however seem to listen to me more than anyone else so I tried to
get him to go out of my friends body and leave us alone. He said he was
going to kill everyone and that he would never leave. He hated everyone
and the anger was intense. I kept telling him that I loved him and that
he needed to go and find the peace he was searching for and that I understood
his anger and his pain but what he was doing was not going to do him any
good.</b>
<br><b>He did eventually leave, but the possession changed my friend. He
became someone who did not shower,though before he was meticulous. He didnt
care about the things he had previously and it ended the relationship with
my cousin.</b>
<br><b>They never did leave while I was living there, though they didnt
cause anymore problems. I left there and have not been back.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for letting me share this with you, I will be back often
and if you allow I will tell you another event.</b>

<p><b>Night Nurse</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sabrams7@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This was the fall of 1983 and it was hotter than hades in Washington,
D.C. My best friend at the time decided to get out of the city and invited
me to join him at his fathers house in Valley Forge, PA. We drove up in
the afternoon and got there</b>
<br><b>around 5. His father lived in a house that was built in the early
1700's. He added a new addition for the family in the 70's so it was half
old, half new. When my friends parents got divorced his father rented out
the new part to a couple that worked in Philadelphia and he lived in the
old part.</b>
<br><b>As we were pulling our things out of the car I looked up and saw
a woman in the upstairs window of the old part. She was light skinned with
light brown hair pulled up in a bun and a blue high necked top. We made
eye contact and she smiled sweetly. I turned and asked my friend who the
woman was and he said it was probably the woman to whom his father rented
the new part of the house. When we looked back she was gone.</b>
<br><b>That night we spent the evening with his father. We had dinner and
a few beers and talked. His father said that the house had a great history,
that it had been used as a hospital during the winter that Washington wintered
in Valley Forge during</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;the Revolutionary War. About 11 the front door opened and
the coupel who rented the other side came in. The woman was tanned with
blonde bobbed hair and a not very sweet smile. My friend and I got pretty
freaked out. I told his Dad what had happened and he laughed pretty hard.
He said that he had been told that the house was haunted by the ghost of
a nurse who was killed by an errant bullet when the British came</b>
<br><b>through chasing after the Colonial Army. He said that he had heard
creaking floors and doors and that knick-knacks and furniture had moved
from time-to-time but that he didn't think much of it. I went to bed that
night around 1. Now remember it was Indian Summer so when I went to bed
it was probably 75 degrees or more. I woke up with a start around 4. Outside
my open window I could hear the crickets chirping. It was still hot, but
my</b>
<br><b>room was now so cold I could see my breath. I had the overwhelming
feeling that someone was watching me. Through chattering teeth I began
to call out "Show yourself, please." I was scared out of my mind but I
was determined to see this spirit or</b>
<br><b>something. Looking back I don't know where I got the bravery because
it was scary!</b>
<br><b>After about five minutes (it felt like and hour!) I felt something
move through me. I got this chill down to my bones and then it was over.
The room warmed up immediately and I was left wondering what had just happened.
I knew if I went back to</b>
<br><b>sleep I would never believe what had happened so I stayed awake.
When my friends Dad got up at 7 needless to say I was on a huge adrenaline
rush. Staying awake is the only reason I believe that this really happened
and wasn't a dream.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Thank you, for this wonderful sight,&nbsp; until now I thought I

distance.</b>
<br><b>First of all, my mother is no longer alive she died of cancer on

before we even knew that she had cancer......my step-father and I were
coming home from a tent revival meeting one night in his truck, I was startled
by my mother's voice speaking out very loudly.&nbsp; And right then I said
"what?" outloud,&nbsp; I didn't understand why I heard her she was at home
in the next county.&nbsp; How could I have heard her.&nbsp; I don't remember
now what the single word was that she spoke out or maybe I never did know
what it was, but I do know that it was her voice.</b>
<br><b>And she had been complaining of pain for a few months before, but
we only found out she had cancer one short month before she died.</b>
<br><b>After being in this sight I think now that maybe I heard her because

<p><b>My Many Ghost Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: njeffrey@carmike.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was a child many things happen or occured around me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well first off starts at my mothers best friends house
when I was around</b>
<br><b>five years old. A couple of weeks earlier, prior to this event,
my mothers</b>
<br><b>friends sister-in-law had passed away of cancer in which she lost
her hair</b>
<br><b>due to treatment. Joan, the sister-in-law, lived in the house with
her</b>
<br><b>brother and his wife and child. One day while we were visiting my
mother's</b>
<br><b>friend we were outside swimming and ,for a reason I do not remember,
I had</b>
<br><b>went inside the house. I came into the livung room and looked down
the hall</b>
<br><b>and there was Joan holding her hand bag and wearing her wig walking
as if</b>
<br><b>it were nothing not even acknowledging that I was there. Well she
had</b>
<br><b>walked into the bath room that was in the hall and never came out.
I never</b>
<br><b>said anything to my mother about this until years later because
at the time</b>
<br><b>it really didn't phase me. I mean I knew she was dead but it didn't
bother</b>
<br><b>me, and come to find out the niece of my mother's friend saw Joan
also</b>
<br><b>walking down the hall carrying her hand bag walking into the bath
room</b>
<br><b>never to return.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next story is about the house that we lived
in at this time. I was</b>
<br><b>around five or six years old when this happed and still to this
day I am</b>
<br><b>still not afraid of what happened.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night around Christmas time I had woken up
in the middle of the</b>
<br><b>night for no reason. At the time my bed was right in front of my
bedrrom</b>
<br><b>door and if you looked out of my door you could see the kitchen.
Well I sat</b>
<br><b>up and looked into the kitchen and saw a young boy ride up in front
of my</b>
<br><b>door on a green and white scooter. He did not say nothing, he just
looked</b>
<br><b>at me for a couple of seconds and drove off into the living room.
Well as</b>
<br><b>he started to&nbsp; ride away I said to him "Wait, that's mine",
hoping he would</b>
<br><b>stop but he did not. I got out of bed a nd went into the living
room only</b>
<br><b>to see the Christmas tree shining and noone there. I never saw him
again,</b>
<br><b>but small things happened in the house before and after I saw him.
Small</b>
<br><b>things like small noises, things being moved into diffrent places,
my</b>
<br><b>battery opperated keyboard would play music while it was turned
off, and my</b>
<br><b>mother said that she always felt like someone was hovering over
her while</b>
<br><b>she was in the bed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my final story. I just think that it
is so great to share this</b>
<br><b>stuff with people who would really believe and know about this stuff.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For reasons I will not discuss, we moved out
of the house ( nothing to</b>
<br><b>do with those events in the house.) We moved into this nice home
in the</b>
<br><b>city. My room was always very cold and my closet was even colder.
I'm not</b>
<br><b>sure if things were moved around in my room because it always stayed
so</b>
<br><b>messy but I know that things from the kitchen would end up in the
bathroom</b>
<br><b>and vise versa. Nothing really ever happened to me after I saaw
the little</b>
<br><b>boy, but things were happening to my mother. One day me and my friends
came</b>
<br><b>to my house after school and saw a yellow Voltzwagon Beetle parked
right in</b>
<br><b>front of my house. A Fat man in a cowboy hat and cowboy boots stepped
out</b>
<br><b>of the car and asked if one of us lived ther and I asked him who
he was and</b>
<br><b>he said that my mother had called him to come over because of weird
things</b>
<br><b>happenung in the house, and he said this right in front of all of
my</b>
<br><b>friends which their mothers would hardly let them come over because
my moms</b>
<br><b>boyfriend listened to heavy metal music and they thought he worshipped
the</b>
<br><b>devil, which he doesn't, but it embarrassed me very much because
I really</b>
<br><b>had no idea that anything was going on. Of course when my mother
got home</b>
<br><b>she was very mad at that man for telling all of us her buisness
that she</b>
<br><b>sent him away. She told me about weird things going on in the house.
Not</b>
<br><b>only things being put in diffrent places but like things being thrown</b>
<br><b>around and things falling off the walls, furniture being flipped
over for</b>
<br><b>no reason just waking up in the middle of the night and the chair
would be</b>
<br><b>turned over into the kitchen. My mother said that she still felt
as if</b>
<br><b>someone was hovering over her in bed and she said that one night
she felt</b>
<br><b>as if she just rose up off of the bed. Many things had happened
in this</b>
<br><b>house that I was not aware of until later on but my mother said
that she</b>
<br><b>had just taken so much of this that one day after an occurence that
she</b>
<br><b>stared crying a said to this thing, "In God's Name what do you want?",
and</b>
<br><b>nothing ever happened again. I have not had any more experiences
like these</b>
<br><b>anymore but for some reason&nbsp; can tell if there is a ghost around
I don't</b>
<br><b>know what it is .</b>

<br><b>My Haunted Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Tinkleweed2@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have luckily never had an unpleasant experience
with a spirit, though I</b>
<br><b>have met a few.&nbsp; Here's my story about my first one.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in '74 and '75, my parents owned a house
in Little Falls, NJ (I was</b>
<br><b>born in '73).&nbsp; It's a one-and-a-half story building, so the
upstairs was just</b>
<br><b>one big room; my playroom, to be exact.&nbsp; I don't remember this,
but there was</b>
<br><b>the ghost of a little blond boy, approximately 4 years old, that
lived there</b>
<br><b>with us.&nbsp; Mom would go upstairs to check on me, and would find
us playing</b>
<br><b>together time and time again.&nbsp; She said that Dad couldn't see
him (he would</b>
<br><b>also dissipate if Dad came into sight), but if she was quiet, he
would stay</b>
<br><b>and continue our game.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only memory involving him that I have
is one night just before my</b>
<br><b>sister was born in '76.&nbsp; I was in my "grown-up" bed, which
had a headboard</b>
<br><b>and a footboard.&nbsp; As I was dozing off, I looked up and saw
him standing at</b>
<br><b>the foot of my bed.&nbsp; I sat up, and it looked to me like he
ducked down to the</b>
<br><b>floor.&nbsp; I crawled to the end and looked over, but there was
nothing there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my sister was born, we moved into
a bigger house in a different</b>
<br><b>town.&nbsp; Mom said that she researched the house's history, but
it was</b>
<br><b>relatively new (we were the 2nd or 3rd owners), and before that
it was</b>
<br><b>farmland, so we never learned anything about him.&nbsp; I truly
hope that by now</b>
<br><b>he's found his way home.</b>

<br><b>My ghost stories...</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SilvryWolf@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know if some of these have other explanations
or reasons for</b>
<br><b>occuring, but I've had innumerable encounters with things that I
believe to</b>
<br><b>be ghosts, spirits, guardians, etc. and after reading the stories
others</b>
<br><b>have contributed I felt that I should follow their example.&nbsp;
I've got several</b>
<br><b>major stories to relate, but this is one that touched me the most
deeply,</b>
<br><b>and also the first in my recollection.&nbsp; If you like this one,
please let me</b>
<br><b>know, and I'll send some more along.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first (possibly) paranormal experience that
I can remember happened</b>
<br><b>when I was around 7 or 8 years old.&nbsp; My family and I went to
see Cherie</b>
<br><b>Lewis in a big, open-air auditorium in Milwaukee.&nbsp; At that
time I absolutely loved</b>
<br><b>cotton candy, and after seeing a vendor selling it near the entrance
to the</b>
<br><b>park, I asked my parents to please let me go get some.&nbsp; They
agreed, gave me</b>
<br><b>money, and made sure I knew exactly where they were sitting so I
could get</b>
<br><b>back to them.&nbsp; I happily ran off, got my candy, and walked
back to where I</b>
<br><b>thought they'd been sitting, but couldn't find them anywhere.&nbsp;
The show was</b>
<br><b>still going on at this time, so I didn't want to shout for them
and disturb</b>
<br><b>other people, so after looking around for a while I went back to
the</b>
<br><b>entrance and told a few of the employees what had happened.&nbsp;
They told me to sit down</b>
<br><b>in an empty seat they pointed out to me and watch the show, and
they'd make</b>
<br><b>an announcement during the intermission.&nbsp; I did what I was
told and tried to</b>
<br><b>watch, but knew that my parents would be getting very worried by
this time</b>
<br><b>and wished there was something I could do.&nbsp; The next thing
I knew, a woman</b>
<br><b>was next to me and said "Come with me.&nbsp; I know where your family
is."&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>wish I could remember more of how she looked, but all that stuck
with me is that</b>
<br><b>she was probably in her early 30's, about 5'6" or 7", had fair skin,
and</b>
<br><b>medium brown hair that was loosely curled and hung a little past
her</b>
<br><b>shoulders.&nbsp; Now I was pretty cautious for that age and paid
attention to all</b>
<br><b>those "don't go ANYWHERE with a stranger" warnings they gave us.&nbsp;
However, I</b>
<br><b>remember her looking and feeling so pretty, nice, and trustworthy
that I</b>
<br><b>barely gave it a second thought when she took my hand and started
leading me</b>
<br><b>through the rows of seats.&nbsp; I think I just assumed she was
a member of the</b>
<br><b>community choir my mom belonged to, since most of those people seemed
to</b>
<br><b>know me when I had no idea who they were.&nbsp; She led me straight
to my family, who</b>
<br><b>were so worried by that time that they had called park security
and were</b>
<br><b>waiting to hear back from them.&nbsp; My parents saw me when I got
pretty close</b>
<br><b>to them, my mom started crying, and they both gave me a big hug,
which blocked</b>
<br><b>my vision for a while.&nbsp; After everyone had calmed down a bit,
I turned to</b>
<br><b>thank the nice lady for bringing me back to my family, to find that
she had</b>
<br><b>dissapeared.&nbsp; I asked my mom and dad about her, but all they
remembered</b>
<br><b>seeing was me coming up the aisle towards them, and strangely, neither
had</b>
<br><b>any idea who she could have been when I gave them a description.&nbsp;
I even</b>
<br><b>looked out for her during the next few choir concerts and business
parties</b>
<br><b>my parents took me too, but never saw anyone who looked remotely
like her.</b>
<br><b>It's a mystery to this day who this lady could have been, and how
she knew</b>
<br><b>Exactly where both my family and I were when no announcement had
been made yet, and my family and I had no idea where each other were.&nbsp;
I've heard it said that</b>
<br><b>guardian spirits often assume very normal-looking forms to help
us - I</b>
<br><b>believe now that explains who, and what, my friendly lady was.</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Unnatural Death</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MALIBU8989@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Three weeks ago my young step-son-in-law met an untimely death, leaving</b>
<br><b>several young children fatherless. His death has brought back memories
of 27</b>
<br><b>years ago when a close friend's common-in-law husband took his own
life after</b>
<br><b>several hours of a stand-off with a friend and cop pleading for
him not to</b>
<br><b>take his own life or that of my friend's and their new baby, just
4 months</b>
<br><b>old.</b>
<br><b>I will never forget the experience I had in my friend's apartment,
after his</b>
<br><b>violent death. We lived in a small town in New Jersey where all
this ocurred.</b>
<br><b>My daughter was just 2 months old when "F." died.</b>
<br><b>Several months after "F". killed himself, me and several other friends</b>
<br><b>finally convinced my friend, who I'll refer to as "K.", to go out
on the</b>
<br><b>town. After all, she was young and still grieving hard for her lover
and</b>
<br><b>father of her child.</b>
<br><b>"K." found a babysitter for our babies and we advised her that we
would be</b>
<br><b>home from the club at around 12:30 AM.&nbsp; We were about 20 minutes
late in</b>
<br><b>arriving home and the babsitter was very agitated. Not so much that
we were</b>
<br><b>late, but from the experience she'd had in the apartment. She'd
gone to the</b>
<br><b>kitchen to check the wall clock and noticed it was 12:30 AM....and
she was</b>
<br><b>not alone with the babies! A man's ethereal figure was sitting at
the kitchen</b>
<br><b>table staring at the clock. Though I was a bit nervous and unnerved
by her</b>
<br><b>story, "K". took it calmly. It was proof-positive that "F." hadn't
really</b>
<br><b>abandoned her and their baby. "F." was awaiting our arrival at the
time we</b>
<br><b>said we'd be back.</b>
<br><b>Several months went by and she arranged for me and some other mutual
friends</b>
<br><b>to come over for a get-together. I got a ride there and was assured
getting a</b>
<br><b>ride home would not be a problem. Well, sort of.......</b>
<br><b>The night wore on and slowly, everyone started falling asleep from
exhaustion</b>
<br><b>(and beer).....except me. I was stone-cold sober!&nbsp; I finally
gave up on</b>
<br><b>trying to get anyone to take me and my daughter home. No one wanted
to brave</b>
<br><b>the cold, blustery winter weather. It seemed fruitless to keep trying,
so I</b>
<br><b>headed for the master bedroom, where the babies were sound asleep.
My</b>
<br><b>friend's son lay sound asleep in his crib and my child, on the large
master</b>
<br><b>bed. Just moments after lying down next to my sleeping baby the
room got</b>
<br><b>severely cold....as if the window had been opened wide (it was January
or</b>
<br><b>February). I thought, this can't be. No one is in this room to open
a window,</b>
<br><b>except me and the babies. I snuggled further under the covers and
tried to</b>
<br><b>get warm. Moments later, as I lay there pondering how this could
be</b>
<br><b>happening, the end of the bed sank down, as if someone sat on it.
NO ONE had</b>
<br><b>entered that room in the normal physical sense! Somehow, despite
being</b>
<br><b>"frozen" with unnatural cold air and fear, I managed at some point,
to fall</b>
<br><b>asleep.</b>
<br><b>Daybreak came and I didn't have any trouble convincing the others
who'd been</b>
<br><b>there the previous night, that what I'd experienced was for real.
I never did</b>
<br><b>spend another night there, or experience anymore "supernatural"
occurences in</b>
<br><b>that apartment house.</b>
<br><b>There have been several other very spooky occurences at other residences
over</b>
<br><b>the years ( like a poltergeist that would not leave me alone for
2 weeks),</b>
<br><b>but none that had the impact that this experience did. I found it
rather</b>
<br><b>peculiar that just a few years ago I was relating my poltergeist
experiences</b>
<br><b>to my brother and he started laughing. His explanation was that
he'd been</b>
<br><b>having "out of body" experiences and was visiting me during that
time period.</b>
<br><b>But he could not explain the distinct presence of a large dog walking
from</b>
<br><b>room-to-room. To this day that experience leaves me with my hair</b>
<br><b>standing-on-end whenever I think about it. It certainly wasn't my</b>
<br><b>imagination.......my husband would blare the radio in the bedroom
and yell,</b>
<br><b>"Ghost, c'mon! You need a wood shampoo"! He kept a 2'x4' plank alongside
the</b>
<br><b>bed in case the visitor ventured into our bedroom (it didn't), and
its</b>
<br><b>presence and very audible walking/closing doors never seemed to
disturb my</b>
<br><b>toddler's sleep.</b>

<br><b>Mark's Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: icp_jumpsteady@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am a teenager living in Connecticut where ghosts are not that usual.
This</b>
<br><b>story I have I am not aware ever happened, since I was such a small
baby</b>
<br><b>when it did. My parents and other relatives told me the events at
seperate</b>
<br><b>times, and all the stories matched up.</b>
<br><b>When I was a little baby in my crib, my parents went to the grocery
store.</b>
<br><b>They had my aunt come and watch me while they were gone. My crib
was located</b>
<br><b>in the far room on the second floor right below the attic. As a
matter of</b>
<br><b>fact, the attic door was in my room. My aunt was in the kitchen
cooking. She</b>
<br><b>had a baby monitor so she could hear my every noise. All of a sudden
she</b>
<br><b>heard me laughing like crazy. She ran upstairs to see what was going
on.</b>
<br><b>When she got there, I was lying down and alseep. She went back downstairs</b>
<br><b>confused. A little while later she heard me laughing again. Once
again she</b>
<br><b>came upstairs wondering what was going on. When she got there, I
was</b>
<br><b>standing up in my crib pointing towards the attic door. When she
looked over</b>
<br><b>towards it, it slammed shut with a bright white glow.</b>
<br><b>A few days later, my mother was in my room picking up my toys. I
owned a</b>
<br><b>very large mickey mouse doll. So large, you could not hold it in
front of</b>
<br><b>you without having to look down to see where you are going. My mother
had to</b>
<br><b>take it into the attic. She picked it up and started her way up
the steps.</b>
<br><b>The attic steps were very thin and the stairs were steep, so she
had to look</b>
<br><b>down to make sure she wasnt going to fall. When she got about halfway
up the</b>
<br><b>stairs, she saw a pair of feet rather than her own. All of a sudden
she was</b>
<br><b>pushed down the stairs and broke both her wrists as a result.</b>
<br><b>Another time my brother who was about 4 at the time, was in the
bathroom</b>
<br><b>doing his business. He left the door open since most kids his age
didnt</b>
<br><b>worry about people looking in and seeing anything. All of a sudden
a old</b>
<br><b>woman - not a figure or mist - walked out of the closet door and
down the</b>
<br><b>hallway towards my brother. When she saw him begin to run she pointed
at him</b>
<br><b>and yelled, "get out of my house!" loud enough for the whole family
to hear</b>
<br><b>it. She then disappeared.</b>
<br><b>I looked back into the history of my house and found out the tale.
As it</b>
<br><b>turns out, a very old woman used to live in this house with her
two grown up</b>
<br><b>sons. As she was dying, she told her sons never to sell the house.
Not long</b>
<br><b>after she died, the boys sold the house to another family. From
that family</b>
<br><b>on, she wandered the house making her appearance known. We have
since moved</b>
<br><b>out of that house, and have experienced no more problems with the
particular</b>
<br><b>ghost.</b>

<p><b>Mad House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: keff@videotron.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi! My name is Karine, I'm 23 years old. I've read a lot of ghost
stories of this web site and many of them start by " I've always been interest
by ghost stuff". You see, I dont! I cannot remember when it started for
me I was too young. Young enough to think that it was my imagination because
I've never heard story that would sounds like mine. When I was just a little
girl my parents have said to me that teachers and some peoples near the
familly were asking if I was autistic. I think I'm just a receptive person,
I can feel it when I enter a house or a room or even when I meet people
in the street. I can feel the pain and sometimes it's hard to deal with
it. I dont remember a lot from my chilhood but I guess my brain don't want
to remember. Anyway... Half of my life I've lived in a house that was looking
at me. Even when I was outside in the middle of the day, sunny day,</b>
<br><b>I was affraid of this house by looking at its window. It was nothing
very old, my grand father built it, died in it and than give it to my parents
before they got me and my 2 little brothers. We stayed there until I turned
15. Its in a little town called Victoriaville in Quebec, Canada. There's
too much things to tell but here's those that were the worst to me.One
of these story was in summer of my 13 years old. A friend of mine was visiting
me, I haven't seen her since a long time so we had a lot to tell each other.</b>
<br><b>We had a very cool day, talking, laughing! We went to sleep but
we couldn't stop talking and discussing about everything. Then, as she
was telling me funny stories, I heard a sound downstairs. My bedroom and
the bedroom of my brothers were upstairs but not my parent's. My mother
use to get up often at night for some reason so I didn't really take care
of it, plus I was listening to my friend. but suddenly I felt it bad. I've
never told her what use to happen to me in this house because I was affraid
that people would laugh at me and I was a bit affraid that if I had mention
this, the ghost or whatever it was, would hear me and comes the night after.
So, I didn't say anything and continued listening to her without showing
my fear. But suddenly we felt something cold at our feet, a wind, coming
very slowly to us, than she stoped talking and looked at me with a pale
face and she said "what is this?" She came close to me shivering and crying
in silence. It</b>
<br><b>came all over the bed and then it disapeard in one second. It was
the first time it happened when I was not alone to feel it. So since that
day I've never thought again that I was crazy. If you want to understand
what it was, just imagine that you are in your bed and someone very big
is flotting over you, yelling at you full of hatred but you cannot see
or hear it. You just feel it by a cold air! Even when I'm telling this
I'm still scared because I will never forget the feeling, my friend either.</b><b></b>
<p><b>But stories cannot explain you all the small, but scary things that
I used to live with. Like sounds... someone calling my name near my ear,
someone following me in the stairs or big sound coming at my bedroom door
like if someone had thrown something very hard on it. Or visions... nights
over nights of women in a white dress passing through my brothers bedroom
doors, looking at me and fading when I tried to look directly at it. I've
seen a women but the voice I heard was usually one of a male. But it's
been a long time since I've quit trying to find out what it was. At this
time I was so constantly on the look out that I just had to say "shushh!"
and my brothers stoped any noise until I'd</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;say "ok". My brothers were the only two people who knew what
happened in the house. I've never talk my parents about this, even today.One
of theses story involve the oldest one of my two brothers. I was home alone
watching t.v. It was winter, near 10:00pm.</b>
<br><b>And my brother was still gone to the skating ring in a park in the
neighborhood playing hockey. But he add already passed his curfew and I
was waiting for him as the big sister that I am. Then I heard the outside
door upstair so I thought "that's him" and I yelled his name "Danny?" many
times but he didn't answer. So I went upstair ,a little bit mad at him.
But when I finally got to him, he was staring at me with a baseball bat
in his hand, trembeling and his eyes filled with tears. Then I asked "what
are you doing?" and he said "I saw..." and he stopped, his face changed
completely like if he had pull off a</b>
<br><b>mask and fell on the floor, crying. He was 10 years old at the time.
Now he is 20 and since that day I've tried to know what it was but he keep
saying that something had stolen his memory the minute he saw me that night.
We are very close and I</b>
<br><b>believe that he trully dont remember because of this change in his
face when I asked him what he had seen that night. I was really frustrated
at that moment because I felt like the ghost was laughing at me.That's
it! I think you've got enough. Just mention that in this period of my life,
it could take me 2 hours before I could finally fall asleep, sweating and
earing every little noise. But the day we moved to a new house, it took
me 10 minutes! I</b>
<br><b>never went back into that house even if it's not so far but the
people who lives there are friends of my parents and they told them strange
things happened but I don't know the details. And I'm not sure I want to
know either!</b>

<br><b>including&amp;excluding immediate family and friends have heard
footsteps that</b>
<br><b>would come up the third floor stairs and stop at the top by a bedroom</b>
<br><b>door.when opened no one would be there,sometimes to could hear the
"ghost"</b>
<br><b>shift its weight from one foot to the other outside the door.also
it would</b>
<br><b>sometimes continue down the hall to the other bedroom making a rack
of coat</b>
<br><b>hangers go back and forth.Cat&amp;dogs were also spooked about the
second&amp;third</b>
<br><b>floor and would not want to go up.one sighting of an old man walking
up the</b>
<br><b>stairs from the 1st floor to the 2nd.jars broke in the basement
and when</b>
<br><b>investigated they only found the trail marks in the dust of the
moved jar</b>
<br><b>and no other disterbances in the dust around it.voices of a man
and woman</b>
<br><b>could be heard at night from the 3rd floor but couldn't make out
what was</b>
<br><b>said(at the time no one was sleeping on the 3rd floor)also voices
of a man</b>

would</b>
<br><b>stop when my brother reached the top of the stair,one time he was
half way</b>

to</b>
<br><b>children beacuse as we grew up and started to leave to the haunting
slowed</b>

<br><b>never would stay latched and footsteps walking around the attic(sounded

<br><b>couldn't walk around because of all the boxes.since we've moved

to the</b>

strange</b>

<br><b>also had their share of being spooked by numerous things that happened
to</b>
<br><b>them including christmas lights being turned on.their young daughters
saying</b>
<br><b>there was an old woman on the 3rd floor and cats that would get

on</b>

<br><b>Supernatural</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ZzJLBasszZ@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi...I dont know where
to start but here it goes....ever since I was</b>
<br><b>a little child,my cousin (veronica) and i've been visited numerous
of times.</b>
<br><b>I'm not sure why but I have a feeling that it has something to do
with the</b>
<br><b>death of my other cousin and great grandma. Like for instance,a
few days</b>
<br><b>before cousin Terry died 2 weeks after her Birthday...my family
took some</b>
<br><b>pictures of her. But the unusual thing is one of them has an angel
huvering</b>
<br><b>above her . They had the picture developed more then once to c if
it&nbsp; was</b>
<br><b>over exposed, But it wasnt.. Ill get it scanned so I can show it
to you...I</b>
<br><b>guess as a sign of her safety. And thats not all...... the night
after she</b>
<br><b>died,something happened. Even though we were very young.. what happened
is</b>
<br><b>unexplainable.&nbsp; Ok...it happened in the room she died in..we
were visited by</b>
<br><b>an angel that night.It entered the room through the window from
the</b>
<br><b>window....it looked like a lightning bug or as a fairy. Only flowing
in the</b>
<br><b>moon light..My cousin was crying the whole night mourning her sis's
death,</b>
<br><b>and for some reason..when it entered ...and once she layed her eyes
on the</b>
<br><b>thing....she stopped crying. The "angel" told us to not worry about
her and</b>
<br><b>that shes safe in heaven.That shes having fun with the angels and
etc.. And</b>
<br><b>as it was talking ....the ball of light was growing brighter and
bigger. For</b>
<br><b>some reason..we werent scared,more like assured and loved. Then
all of a</b>
<br><b>sudden..it left towards the light.But thats not all..the next night,we
were</b>
<br><b>visited by some thing way more different. I think that they were
demons...My</b>
<br><b>cousins used to collect trolls. All kinds of trolls ..like the kinds
that</b>
<br><b>eyes glowed when you rubb the tummy and a priest troll.Also the
huge kinds</b>
<br><b>that you can get carnivals,a widow troll,all kind of every troll
that there</b>
<br><b>could be.Any wayz,it started as a cold feeling ,a scared feeling
,a smell ,</b>
<br><b>then fire appeared in every corner of the room.It spreaded to every
troll's</b>
<br><b>hair. and every second that passed,the glowing trolls came closer
and closer</b>
<br><b>to the bed that we were lying on.On the night stand by my cousin
..the was</b>
<br><b>the smallest troll.It was MOVING! We screamed as loud as we can
....Her</b>
<br><b>mother opened the door and everything stopped in a split second.We
asked her</b>
<br><b>to get rid of them.. My cousin Joe Burned them Instead cuz he said
that it</b>
<br><b>must have been a sign from the Devil or something..I know it seems
unreal</b>
<br><b>this ACTUALY happened. And how can we immagined it if we both saw
the same</b>
<br><b>thing and sill remember it so vividly. I guess thats one of the
reasons why</b>
<br><b>we've never got over her death.And we show our friends the angel</b>
<br><b>picture...then they believe us. And every time I see the picture
the events</b>
<br><b>haunt my memories...And anther thing,that same room is still haunted.You
know</b>
<br><b>how I know?Cuz right after she moved ..a teenager was shot in that
same</b>
<br><b>room.and an old man died after from a heart attack.But back to my
great</b>
<br><b>grandma, sometimes I feel her spirit in my house.The signs that
i feel this</b>
<br><b>way is that every memorie I have of her,happens in the hall way
and</b>
<br><b>kitchen..late at night.Like the smell of&nbsp; massa she 'd make
every night.And</b>
<br><b>the smell of her cookie batch,the sounds of her tortilla roller
hitting</b>
<br><b>against the wooden carver,and every night,,,the kitchen sink is
always on</b>
<br><b>when no ones in there.One time my sister said that she saw the sink
nob</b>
<br><b>lifted on it's own and the sink was on...My sister is the innocent
type that</b>
<br><b>never lies and she still dosent fully believe in ghosts.But...she
still runs</b>
<br><b>to me when shes scared of something.I guess you can say that I have
that 6th</b>
<br><b>sense(like the movie).Cuz ever since the insadent with the angel...i've
seen</b>
<br><b>things that others dont.My mom tells me that its a gift from god
and I should</b>
<br><b>use it.And I've notticed that as I get older....what I see seems
to fade more</b>
<br><b>and more.I dont want to lose it but I know that when I'm an adult
it will</b>
<br><b>leave me.so now I go by the signs.Finally,all I have to say is that
IM NOt</b>

<p><b>Granny Watches Me</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ponigirl@carolina.rr.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm going to take this opportunity to relate some personal experiences
that are not necessarily all that frightening, but are interesting nonetheless.
Most people really don't beleive me when I tell them about these things,
but I know they're true. That's all that matters, right? :)Anyway, I am
currently 17 years of age. I've never seen a ghost persay, but I feel that
I have had some experiences that are out of the ordinary. I feel I must
relate a bit of family history for these stories to make sense. All the
female people on my mother's side of the family are very, very close. We
are not only good friends, we are very sensitive to others. All of us have
the uncanny knack for knowing when someone is feeling bad or especially
upset.&nbsp; When I was very young, I spend hours and hours with my Grandmother,
affectionately known as Granny.&nbsp; I spent countless hours eating marshmallows
and watching Nickelodeon at her house during the summer or on weekends.
They were wonderful times in my life. Unfortunately, my dear Granny was
a lifelong smoker, not to mention worker in South Carolina's asbestos mills.
When I was about 11, she began a long and painful battle with Emphysema.</b>
<br><b>One evening, I went to bed around 9:00 as was customary for me at
that age. However, I couldn't sleep. It was as if someone was squeezing
my rib cage, preventing me from breathing. I began to cry and toss and
turn in my bed. Finally, the discomfort became too great and I ran into
the hall crying for my mother. As suddenly as it had all begun, it ended,
leaving me feeling winded and foolish. My mother was irritated with my
interruption on her favorite TV show, and sent me back to bed. However,
the second I re-entered my bedroom, the tight feelings in my chest resumed.
I cried and fought for all I was worth. The moment that I walked out the
door, the feelings would all vanish as quickly as they began. I refused
to sleep in my room that night and my mother finally relented and moved
me to a spare bedroom. About 7am the next morning, the hospital</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;called to say that 911 had been called to transport my grandmother
to the hospital at approximately 11 pm the night before. Just about the
same time I had become upset.</b>
<br><b>I beleive I was nearing the age of 13 when my Granny lost contact
with the outside world and we knew it was only a matter of time until she
left us. I was prepared, but I still dreaded the event, as I loved her
very much. I was her only grandchild and she had showered me with love
for much of my young life. Now, my Granny was a no-nonsense southern mother
with more than her share of eccentricities. One of these was the fact that
I never ever saw her without shoes. When she was not laced into a pair
of walking shoes, she was wearing bedroom scuffs. Well, my grandmother
died on January 9th, which was the day after my mother's birthday, precisely
between two of the worst snow storms my southern state has ever seen. We
swear she waited so she could hang around for mom's birthday :) But anyway,
the night before she died, I was sleeping well and I had a dream.</b>
<br><b>I was sitting in the room which she occupied at the nursing home.
However, the bed was made and my Granny was standing beside it, wearing
a beautiful gold angel costume. Her hair was meticulously curled as always
and she was smiling at me. She spoke to me, telling me that she was alright
and that she didn't hurt anymore. Then she began to float upward toward
the ceiling in a glowing light. The ironic thing was the sturdy walking
shoes poking out from the hem of her angel robes :) I woke hours later
feeling very peaceful, rested and resigned. Both my parents left early
that morning to visit the Nursing home, as they had been told it was a
matter of days. It was around 10 am and I stood there curling my hair in
the bathroom when I just took a deep breath and sighed. I felt a great
release and I knew what it was. Granny was finally gone. She was&nbsp;
finally away from her pain. My parents returned home a few hours later
and advised me to sit down because they had something to tell me. I looked
my mother in the eye and said "I know, she died." It was just as simple
as that. Mom was dumbfounded as there was no way I could have known. But
I knew before she had the chance to get the words out. All through the
funeral, I was the one who never cried. I never felt the need to. I knew
all was peaceful and all was good. Granny still comes to me. When I lie
awake and cry, I feel her hand in my hair and my fear and pain goes away.
Thank you Granny, for</b>
<br><b>taking care of me all these years. I hope you never leave me :)</b>

<br><b>Strange Occurrence</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Snoopy@iopener.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This one is short and sweet...and true. Years ago,while we were in
the seventh grade, my best friend invited me over to spend the night. Plenty
time was spent beforehand, scheming plans to sneak out, roam the streets,
and wreak havoc on the neighborhood. Our tools: toilet paper, white shoe
polish, and pure mean-spirited zeal. We half-heartedly papered a few trees
here and there as we made our way to our real target: a small shopping
center owned by the family of a girl we didn't particularly like. Once
there, we were meticulous in our effort; our shoe-polish graffiti spoiled
every storefront there. Proudly we admired our handiwork until a car's
bright headlights sent us scampering. We took a "short cut" through an
outdoor breezeway of a nearby church, laughing wildly as we ran. Then...BAM!...just
like that ...we simultaneously hit the pavement, skidding to a stop on
our hands and knees. There, on all fours, we immediately looked at each
other, then behind&nbsp; us, then quickly back to each other. I know we
both had the same distinct conclusion-we didn't trip on anything, 'cuz
the pavement was smooth and</b>
<br><b>level-and we HADN'T tripped each other, either! I felt the hair
on the back of my neck stand up, and Lori did too. We scrambled to our
feet and ran FAST, 'cuz we were FREAKIN! When we made it home, and could
finally spare the air to speak,&nbsp; we both had the same eerie feeling
that SOMETHING or SOMEONE&nbsp; in that church breezeway THREW US to the
ground, to teach us&nbsp; a lesson!</b>

<p><b>Phantom Sweater</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>{There is no real proof that this incident i am about to describe
is a</b>
<br><b>ghostly one, but my aunt and i believe that it is.}</b><b></b>
<p><b>i moved in with my aunt in january of this year.&nbsp; i am renting
the basement,</b>
<br><b>where it is generally very cold, as basements can be.&nbsp; one
week in february,</b>
<br><b>when it was particularly cold downstairs i wished aloud that i had
something</b>
<br><b>really warm to put on, just talking to myself.&nbsp; the next morning
i woke up</b>
<br><b>and happened to notice a grey sweater hanging on my coatrack that
had not</b>
<br><b>been there the night before.&nbsp; my aunt had come home and needed
my boyfriend</b>
<br><b>to help her push her car up the driveway late the night before so
i thought</b>
<br><b>maybe she absentmindedly hung it there, and thought nothing more
of it.&nbsp; when</b>
<br><b>i got home from school that afternoon it was still there.&nbsp;
i noticed that</b>
<br><b>inside it had a pink floral pattern and that it was made out of
sweatshirt</b>
<br><b>material but was a cardigan style.&nbsp; i also noticed that it
could not possibly</b>
<br><b>be my aunt's, because it was way too small, like my size.&nbsp;
i contemplated</b>
<br><b>putting it on, but then i decided not to.&nbsp; i sat down on the
couch to watch</b>
<br><b>tv.&nbsp; a few hours later my boyfriend arrived, hung his coat
up and came to</b>
<br><b>join me on the couch.&nbsp; after about a half hour we got up to
go somewhere and</b>
<br><b>i noticed when i went to get my coat that the sweater was not there
anymore!</b>
<br><b>i asked him if he'd seen it and he said no!&nbsp; in fact, his coat
was hanging on</b>
<br><b>the hook that the sweater had been on!&nbsp; i checked all around
underneath the</b>
<br><b>rack, behind chairs, even in my bedroom and the kitchen, and there
was no</b>
<br><b>sign of the sweater.&nbsp; later that night i asked my aunt if she
owned a sweater</b>
<br><b>like that and she said no.&nbsp; she also told me that she had noticed
it too, and</b>
<br><b>wondered where i got it because it was pretty.&nbsp; she said she
didn't know what</b>
<br><b>made her notice it, either, she had just come downstairs to do laundry!&nbsp;
i</b>
<br><b>looked all around upstairs to make sure that she wasn't playing
a trick on</b>
<br><b>me, and i found nothing.&nbsp; besides, she was not home when the
sweater</b>
<br><b>disappeared, and there is no way that anyone could have gotten into
the house</b>
<br><b>to take it off the coat rack while i was sitting on the couch not
10 feet</b>
<br><b>away from it!&nbsp; i think it might have been the spirit of my
grandmother, as my</b>
<br><b>aunt has seen her and dreamt of her (as i have) several times.&nbsp;

<p><b>A Medium Trance?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bdclark@cswnet.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My name is Jennifer, and some things happened to me as a young girl,
and I was wondering if I might be a medium? Here it goes! I don't tell
anyone this because it scares me too.&nbsp; When I was little I was told
that When I was taken outside to play there was a particular place that
I was taken It was a yard swing hung between two trees. I would swing on
that swing and after a while I was told it was as if I would just drop</b>
<br><b>into a sleep of sorts and sit up and be able to talk as plainly
as an adult I was all of two or three. I told these family members my name
was Elizabeth Bell ( possibly Belle) and it was 1818 or 1819 my sister
couldn't remember when asked but she knew for sure it was one of the two
and that I lived in a large white house with large pillars on the</b>
<br><b>front.&nbsp; I also went on to explain the interior of the home.&nbsp;
The first floor then the second.&nbsp; Especially a small table in the
foirer.&nbsp; I think that is how you spell it.&nbsp; The entrance of the
home.&nbsp; It would seem that there was a small body of water near by
like a river or something.&nbsp; Anyway my sister would tell me NO my name
was Jennifer and it was such and such date and I would get very mad and
the swing would start rocking all by itself and my mother come out and
told her to quit because she didn't know what she was messing with.&nbsp;
Apparently I did this until I was four years old.&nbsp; Please Help me
If I</b>
<br><b>am a type of medium than maybe I can help people and ghost alike
in thier endeavor to go to a higher plane and people to live a normal life.&nbsp;
I seem to have blocked out that particular ability but I tell you I can
sense when a spirit is close by.&nbsp; I can also tell you a mile down
the road before you ever get to one that there is a cemetary and sometimes
people burried where there is no grave.&nbsp; Please tell me I am not a
Fruit cake as I am so commonly referred as.&nbsp; Alot of Paranormal stuff
has happened to both me and my husband, Now I think my son can see and
comunicate to these ghosts.&nbsp; He is seven</b>
<br><b>months old and will walk into a room throw up his hand, wave and
say hi.&nbsp; He smiles at then air.&nbsp; I can hear things on his Baby
monitor at night.&nbsp; Please tell me I am not crazy.</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;Girl Lost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: exactchange@hotmail.comt</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a true account of something that happened to me and I would
like to</b>
<br><b>share it with someone who has an open mind.</b>
<br><b>The house diagonally behind ours had police tape on the upstairs</b>
<br><b>bedroom window. The next day an article in the paper said a teenage
girl was</b>
<br><b>murdered there by another family member but no charges were being
pressed.</b>
<br><b>About a week later I was laying on the couch watching tv. It was
in the</b>
<br><b>afternoon and it was a beautiful day. I felt the cushion of the
couch under</b>
<br><b>my feet being pushed down. I looked and at the end of the couch
there was</b>
<br><b>this girl standing there looking at me with a very disturbed stare.
I felt</b>
<br><b>for my life. I looked away in disbelief and as I looked again, she
was gone.</b>
<br><b>I jumped up and checked all the doors but they were all shut and
locked. She</b>
<br><b>looked just like a real person. I could see the white of her eye
and the</b>
<br><b>courseness of her brown hair. Other incidents have happened in our
home. I</b>
<br><b>believe she has something to do with it. There wasn't a picture
in the paper</b>
<br><b>at that time and I always wonder still if that was the girl that

<br><b>My Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; Christina</b><b></b>
<p><b>My Ghost Story as it happened. 26.06.00</b>
<br><b>In 1976 i married, and we moved into an old married quarters in
norfolk which was dated around about 2nd world war. I felt as soon as i
walked into the house i was being watched, i could never look up to the
landing, because of the fear there would be someone standing there, the
door bell would ring, and i would</b>
<br><b>go to the door. But there was never anybody there, it would always
happen when my husband was on guard duity, and i was left alone in the
house.One beautiful hot summer's day, the butcher knocked on the back door,
i answered as always payed him for</b>
<br><b>my meat. As he left the shed at the end of the garden, started to
shake the glass blew out across the path of the butcher there was not a
breath of wind that day, and the glass blew from within out. It frightn'd
us both the house was always cold, until this day i believe it was haunted!!.
A year after i moved i phoned a neighbour who told me, the new neighbours
had moved out after only a couple of months because of noises and bumps
in the night.So i decided to find out, about the history of the house,
and i found out before i moved in, the lady before me had lost a child
in a trumatic circumstances the</b>
<br><b>house has been boarded up, and hasnt been lived in for the last
20years+. Also while i lived there i never told anybody, what was happening
because i felt they would think me crazy to this day, im still haunted
by the memories of 76.</b>

<p><b>My Son's Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When my son was born in 1984 we were renting a house while we saved
money</b>
<br><b>to purchase a home of our own.&nbsp; We lived there until 1987.&nbsp;
Our landlady</b>
<br><b>was older and quite nice.&nbsp; When our son was born, she brought
us a baby</b>
<br><b>gift.We lived happily in the home, until one day, my toddler son
was out in the</b>
<br><b>yard playing on his swings.&nbsp; He came to the kitchen door and
said, "Mrs.</b>
<br><b>McDermott is in the yard."&nbsp; Mrs. McDermott was out landlady.&nbsp;
I figured she</b>
<br><b>might be over looking at the fence (which needed some repairs).&nbsp;
I went</b>
<br><b>outside to look for her, but couldn't find her.&nbsp; I thought
maybe she and I</b>
<br><b>just missed each other and that she had left.&nbsp; I stayed outside
with Mac,</b>
<br><b>pushing him on his swing.&nbsp; Suddenly, Mac exclaimed, "There
she is, Mommy,</b>
<br><b>Mrs. McDermott!"&nbsp; He was pointing to the corner of the yard
where the fence</b>
<br><b>met the house.&nbsp; No one was there.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; I was shocked.&nbsp;
Acting as</b>
<br><b>naturally as I could, I brought Mac into the house and proceeded
normally</b>
<br><b>through the rest of the morning, although I kept thinking of him
seeing</b>
<br><b>something I could not.Later, I put him down for a nap and went to
the living room to read.&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>sitting on the sofa when I caught something out of the corner of
my eye.</b>
<br><b>A balloon which had floated, unmoving, in the corner of my son's
room (one</b>
<br><b>of those mylar ones that stay inflated forever) - had floated out
of his</b>
<br><b>room, down the hallway, turned a corner, and was floating now in
front of</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; My mouth dropped open.&nbsp; That balloon had been in
my son's room for</b>
<br><b>probably 2 weeks without moving a centimeter and here it was, in
front of</b>
<br><b>me, eye level.</b>
<br><b>The phone rang and I almost had heart failure.&nbsp; I ran to the
kitchen to</b>
<br><b>answer the phone, thinking it was my husband and boy did I have
a weird</b>
<br><b>morning to relate to him.&nbsp; It wasn't my husband, it was Mrs.
McDermott's</b>
<br><b>daughter.&nbsp; She called to tell me that her mother had died earlier
in the</b>
<br><b>week and that they would be taking over as our landlords.</b>
<br><b>I guess you know the hair stood up on the back of my neck and I
spent the</b>
<br><b>rest of the day looking over my shoulder.&nbsp; Living in L.A.,
I actually knew</b>
<br><b>a woman who had brought "ghostbusters" into her home because her
daughter</b>
<br><b>was being bothered by something unseen.&nbsp; She checked with these
folks, and</b>
<br><b>they related what I already thought.&nbsp; Mrs. McDermott came to
see her house</b>
<br><b>for a last time; and maybe wanted to say "bye" to Mac - I don't
recall her</b>
<br><b>having any grandchildren of her own.</b>
<br><b>My son's almost 16 now, and intrigued by all the paranormal stories</b>
<br><b>surrounding our family.&nbsp; Although many people are skeptical
(I am about</b>
<br><b>many things) - I've learned to never, ever, say something's impossible</b>
<br><b>(except for maybe honesty in a politician).</b>

<p><b>My Neck Itched</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Daddyostevens@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two months ago I resided in an old Pennsylvania
farmhouse . It was very</b>
<br><b>old but the previous owner fixed it up . She had a crew of home
repairmen</b>
<br><b>brighten it up and give it a new shine . Three weeks afterward she
sold the</b>
<br><b>house to me . I soon found out why .</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing happened the first two days I was there
except for the coldness .</b>
<br><b>The third night I awoke to the eerie sound of something rolling
around</b>
<br><b>downstairs . I got up to investigate but saw nothing . The next
day I</b>
<br><b>searched the house for a reasonfor the noise but still found nothing
. I tried to ignore it the next two nights but found myself awake waiting
for morning to come and for the rolling to stop . The sixth night I managed
to fall asleep until my neck started to</b>
<br><b>itch . I felt my neck to see what was on it . All I found was a
powdery</b>
<br><b>sensation on my neck , like someone put Goldbond on me there .</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night in the second week I was reading a
book when in the corner of</b>
<br><b>my eye&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I saw a severed head roll
down the hall . I dismissed it as being</b>
<br><b>my imagination , but when it repeated I started getting scared .
I didn't</b>
<br><b>know what was going on . I felt like I didn't belong in that house
.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Saturday afternoon left me cleaning my house
. Occurences were rare</b>
<br><b>during the day so I wasn't afraid of going down the basement . Cleaning
up in</b>
<br><b>the basement I stumbled upon something old . In the corner of the
cellar a</b>
<br><b>wall had a hole in it . Curious I bent down and examined it . I
put my hand</b>
<br><b>on a patch of weak wall next to it , but put a little too much pressure
on it</b>
<br><b>and it collapsed . When the dust settled I looked down to find a
family of</b>
<br><b>skulls . Two adults , one child and an infant . I popped up scared
out of my</b>
<br><b>wits when suddenly I felt the powdery sensation on my neck again
. As fast as</b>
<br><b>I could I ran out of the corner and up the steps , locking the door
behind me</b>
<br><b>. Two days later I was packed and ready to go , except for the things
in the</b>
<br><b>basement .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave the previous owner a visit and
talked to her about the house . She</b>
<br><b>said she had similiar experiences and she returned me my money which
seemed odd as</b>

<br><b>My Many Ghost Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: anitaj@iopener.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello Dave....and thank you for a very informative site on the paranormal!
It's the best I've seen! *S*I'd like to share with you and your readers
about the experiences I've had with Ghosts.I will soon be 38 years old,
here in Jacksonville,Florida where most of my encounters have occurred.
I have always been ableto sense if a place had ghost activity...I'm not
a psychic in any way..but I get feeling or vibrations if you will if a
place doesnt seem right. I hope that makes sense! I can tell the good from
the bad in most cases...I guess growing up in a haunted house for 17 years
helped! *L*I grew up on the south side of Jaxville...in a nice area called
Glynlea...quiet for the most part in the 60's and 70's...except the house
we lived in...which my father always called it " 454 The freaky House"..I
won't give the street name as my father sold the house 21 years ago. I
guess I can say its not far from Holiday Hill Elementary School.I can remember
as far back as two years old, but the ghosts I encountered I'd say I was
about 4 or 5 yrs old. I should first explain that though, myself, my Mother
and Father and two older sisters all heard the ghost voices from the Florida
room..in all the years there.. none of us told the other what we had heard
and I never told my family til later in life about the three ghosts I had
seen!!&nbsp; We don't know WHY we never did, but we all say we were NEVER
scared in any way other than being spooked by hearing three distinct voices
in the night! AND it was only at night!!</b>
<br><b>I recall one night waking up and from my bedroom I walked to the
Florida room to my left down the hall to my left and seeing my Mother by
the space heater in the corner, and two men standing by the wall in front
of the TV. Though they seemed to be a bit transparent, I wondered by she
never acted like they were there as she didnt acknowledge them, but i figured
she knew they were there... One man was dressed in Spanish dress...:one
was an indian&nbsp; with dark hair past his shoulders and the other was
another small spanish man..with a white ruffled shirt, whereas the first
one had on a red shirt..black pantaloon type pants.NOTE:...as you may or
may not know, Jacksonville,FL has Ft.Caroline Fort, built by the french,
and St.Augustine,FL is 30 minutes south of Jacksonville and has quite a
long history with Castillo De SanMarcos and the area of St.Augustine itsself
has ghost stories galore! Along with confirmed&nbsp; haunted places to
visit!! A great city.. I think if you live close you should visit the city
and go on the Ghosts Tour thru the visitor bureau!Well, WHY I was the only
family member to SEE the three ghosts I'll never know, nor will I know
WHO they were. The really weird thing is that...late at night, if no one
was in the family room, and say if we were in the kitchen, you'd hear men
talking..like they were carrying on a conversation and you could never
make out just what they were saying..I now know WHY, as they HAD to be
speaking Spanish...none of us knew how to speak spanish and if we did...
we couldnt understand them as their words sounded muffled. Very strange!What's
really weird, is that if I was the only one home ( my parents divorced
and Dad raised me and my one older sister being the eldest moved out being
married and in New Jersey with hubby, daughter and one son...my Mother
had moved to Ohio)...I would be in bed for school the next day, and around
10:30pm..I was usually awakend and I thought maybe my father was home from
his girlfriends or my sister Jeanne was back from seeing her boyfriend
and they had turned on the TV as I heard what sounded like a newcasts.I
got up many a nights to investigate...I'd get to the Florida room door..
no one was there!! AND..the voices had stopped !!&nbsp; We ALWAYS left
a light on all night in that room on a table by the couch being there was
no light switch inside the door then you step down to the room. At night,
as an adult I'd run to turn the light on if it was off.. and if the light
was burned out in the table lamp.. I wouldnt change it til morning.. I
was afraid to see the ghosts as I did before.. And, I used to&nbsp; "talk"
to the ghosts, getting mad at having to walk to the other end of the house
to see.. and got so fed up.. I got out of bed 3 times and I walked to the
Florida rom door and yet again...voices stopped... I looked into the room,
I never saw my three ghostly friends...but I said..cursing the room.."
Listen guys..I have to get up and go to school in the&nbsp; morning...
I can't sleep.. your talking is keeping me awake... I dont want to see
you guys...I dont mind your talking..but&nbsp; please be a little more
quiet so I can SLEEP..Please..thank you..good night"..And I stormed off
back to my room. Here I was a 16 year old in high school... talking to
Ghosts in the night! *L*It worked for a while.. a few days later..they
started again..talking at night..soon.. all it took for me was to stand
in the hall outside my door..look south towards the Florida room and they
would stop from there.Here is what's funny I think... my Dad sells the
house to my older sister and her hubby who move back from New Jersey..
I had moved to Cincinnati,Ohio to be with my Mother and my sister got my
best friend LeeAnne to baby sit at times for them. I came down for a visit
and out of the blue..I asked LeeAnne if she ever heard any voices in the
Florida room when Diane and Keith were away... she said...What do you mean,
Nita? I said....well.. do you ever hear voices..like the Tv is on when
you are back in the other part of the house with the kids?...She said..
Funny you should say that...I have.... I was putting the kids to bed and
know I turned the tv down to mute..it was on the screen as muted, I thought
your brother in law got home cuz I heard a mans voice.. I walked to the
front and no one was there and the tv was still muted. ANd I've turned
the TV OFF and heard voices!It was then I told my friend at the time..of
knowing her then 19 years, that the house was haunted..but only the family
room. She knew some thing was weird and the BEST thing of all is they ..THE
3 GHOSTS were NEVER mean Nor did we ever feel threatend.They never moved
things around or anything.. always stayed in that part of the house!&nbsp;
I just wished I could find out who they were and what year was it for them.</b>
<br><b>I have many more experiences I will share from other placed I've
lived since.... and I DO have photos from a recent apartment I lived in
from St.Louis, Missouri that has a few orbs in a few pics., I left them
with a neighbour and will get copies to you as soon as I can to share..
as I had seen photos on your site with orbs, I never thought I'd ever get
any but I did!</b><b></b>
<p><b>Thank you for letting me share my stories...and again.. thanks for

<p><b>Seeing and Feeling Disturbing Things</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: XTHEXBROODX@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, i have a few odd experiences to share with you</b>
<br><b>one of them was when i was small,maybe 7 or 8, and at that time
i lived in an</b>
<br><b>apartment in culver city. Once at night when i was sick, i had a
dream that</b>
<br><b>some scary looking guy was chasing me. he chased me until i reached
a door</b>
<br><b>and i opened it. suddenly everything turned white and i woke up.
i thought</b>
<br><b>everything was just a dream and it was over.I noticed that everything
became</b>
<br><b>very still and there was no sound but a started hearing music and
when i</b>
<br><b>looked around i still saw the person chasing me in the dream. he
was really</b>
<br><b>small and did not look real because where ever he appeared,it looked
like he</b>
<br><b>was printed on it. i told my mom but she didnt see anything and
she told me</b>
<br><b>to close my eyes and i did but i could still see him. it was really</b>
<br><b>disturbing and after a long time it ended somehow.</b>
<br><b>Another strange thing happened to me about 5 years ago. One afternoon
was</b>
<br><b>lying down on my bed reading a book and my sister was on the computer.
For</b>
<br><b>some reason i looked back and nothing was there,just a pillow and
the wall.</b>
<br><b>after a while i felt a hand or claw grab my foot. it hurt a little
and i</b>
<br><b>screamed and my sister thought i was crazy. Also sometimes i see
something</b>
<br><b>move from the corner of my eye but when i turn around, ofcourse,nothing
was</b>
<br><b>there. My neighbor came to my house once and she said she saw something
like</b>
<br><b>a white hand under a table. i looked under and nothing was there.</b>
<br><b>these are a few experiences i've had and some might not be that
big but i</b>
<br><b>decided to share them. right now, my room is the room where i felt
something</b>
<br><b>grab my foot. i hope nothing like that happens to me again because
it is</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;My true Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Nathan Paquin</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have never written about this experience or told many people about
it, but it did scare me so bad that I did have it blocked out of my mind
until recently.&nbsp; This incident occurred when I was about 6 yrs old.
I was living with my Mother at the time, she was divorced, and in the Air
Force at the time.&nbsp; She had met this guy named Michael who I was never
fond of, he seemed very creepy to me.&nbsp; Well anyhow, somehow we both
wound up in Michigan with this man.&nbsp; We went to go meet his parents
and such, when you walked into the house you always had this strange feeling
that you were not alone, and that something was watching you.&nbsp; I got
this uneasy feeling and I hated this guys parents there was something
wrong about the mother anyhow, he could just sense it.&nbsp; Well a week
after that met her, and her husband they killed themselves in that very
house, they were both cops, so they both had weapon.&nbsp; My mother believes
that the women shot them both.&nbsp; Afterwards we were&nbsp; forced to
live in the house for about a month, it was the month from hell.&nbsp;
My mother was scared to death of being alone that house and she was scared
to leave me alone in that house.&nbsp; I heard many things and seen many
things in the house.&nbsp; There was one incident that scared the crap
out of me, and to this day I get chills thinking about. Well there was
this one&nbsp; night where I could have sworn I heard my mother and her
boyfriend come out of their bedroom.&nbsp; My door was always closed at
night so was my mothers door; her door was across from mine.&nbsp; Well
when I looked at the clock it read 4:00am, I was</b>
<br><b>wondering what they were doing up so early, so I slowly crept toward
the door and opened it, I did hear noises coming from the kitchen, so I
thought they were in the kitchen talking. That is what it sounded like
to me, so I slowly walked down the&nbsp; hall, and the light in the kitchen
was flickering on and off.&nbsp; As I grew nearer the kitchen the voices
sounded like they were lowering because they heard me, I got to the kitchen
door when the voices sopped and started walking towards the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Like that I ran down the hall, and went into the bedroom, and peered down
the hall from my door.&nbsp;&nbsp; What I saw shocked the hades out of
me, I saw a lady in white, hovering so many feet above the ground, slowly
moving toward he living room.&nbsp; I didnt call out or anything, I was
frozen with fear.&nbsp; The lady was pure white, and had long hair, and
a gown on, and she was floating above the ground.&nbsp; To this day it
upsets me to think about it, and sometimes I get upset and cry, it was
the most horrible experience of my life and I thank god I have never seen
a ghost like that again!&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother has also told me that during
those times I had talked with Michaels dead mother, but thank god I dont
even remember talking to her, I think&nbsp; it scared me so bad that I
had blocked that incident in my head, and cant remember it.&nbsp; Yes
this is a true story, mother has also seen this lady, but we never talked
to it. Thank you for your time!</b>

<p><b>The Witch and My Grandfather</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: GeminiJs16@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>well i never really belived in ghosts until i was 5 or 6 years old.
our</b>
<br><b>house wasnt very big and my little brother just came home from the
hospital so</b>
<br><b>me and my little sister had to share a room. she is only 2 years
younger then</b>
<br><b>i am. well we each had our own bed side by side but with a night-stand
in</b>
<br><b>the middle. one night at like 2 in the morning i woke up for some
strange</b>
<br><b>reason and i couldnt fall back asleep so i just layed there with
my eyes closed</b>
<br><b>thinking that sooner or later i would fall asleep. well just has
i was</b>
<br><b>driffting off i heard this witch's voice(like in all the scary movies)</b>
<br><b>yell my name into my ear. my eyes were wide open now but i was too
scared to</b>
<br><b>turn around and look. being that i was very little. after laying
there for</b>
<br><b>about 15 minutes i jumped out of my bed and turned around. nothing
was</b>
<br><b>there....in fact everything was like it was before. because the
voice was so loud i</b>
<br><b>thought that my sister would have woken up(she is a very litel sleeper)</b>
<br><b>but she was sound asleep. then there was another time when my mom
was drying</b>
<br><b>my hair and i saw my grandfathers face in the corner( he had died
a few weeks</b>
<br><b>before) and i asked my mom what my grandfather was doing in the
corner. my</b>
<br><b>mom turned around and there was no one there. then there was one
more time</b>
<br><b>with my grandfather a few days after he died i woke up and i went
into the</b>
<br><b>kitchen to get a drink. to get to the kitchen you have to pass the
front</b>
<br><b>windows where you can see the deck. well i heard footprints like
someone</b>
<br><b>was walking up the deck. i went out there and the boards were moving
like</b>
<br><b>somone was walking on them! (they were very old boards) well whoever
it was</b>
<br><b>walked up to the front door and then walked back off the deck...i
told my mom and</b>
<br><b>she says it was my grandfather saying goodbye.</b>

<p><b>The Indian</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: TWeingartn@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In October of 1970, my family moved from Queens to Long Island in
a house</b>
<br><b>that was built brand new for us.&nbsp; When I was about 7 years
old my parents</b>
<br><b>went out for the evening and my older brother was left baby-sitting
myself</b>
<br><b>and my younger sister.&nbsp; At around 10:00 PM I woke up because
my pillow had</b>
<br><b>fallen behind the bed.&nbsp; When I turned around I saw a figure
standing there</b>
<br><b>beside the bed.&nbsp; The only way I can describe him was that he
looked like a</b>
<br><b>shadow only not distorted and he looked as if he were wearing a
headdress.</b>
<br><b>At first I thought it was my brother trying to scare me, so I started</b>
<br><b>asking it questions.&nbsp; There was no reply.&nbsp; I started screaming
for my parents</b>
<br><b>when my brother called up from downstairs that they hadn't returned
home yet.</b>
<br><b>I told him to come up, there was someone in my room.&nbsp; When
he got to my room</b>
<br><b>he turned the hall light on and the figure just disappeared.&nbsp;
I guess I just</b>
<br><b>fell back to sleep.&nbsp; The next morning I began to tell my mother
the story</b>
<br><b>about the Indian in my room.&nbsp; As any parent would think, my
mother said I</b>
<br><b>was dreaming and told me to go out and play.&nbsp; An hour or so
later my sister</b>
<br><b>woke up and began to tell my mother the same story.&nbsp; I guess
you can say she</b>
<br><b>was a little shocked.&nbsp; My sister and I never saw that Indian
again.&nbsp; I am now 32</b>
<br><b>years old and my brother has two small children that spend a lot
of time</b>
<br><b>at my parents house.&nbsp; My niece who is only 5 spent the night
there a few</b>
<br><b>months ago.&nbsp; When she woke up the next morning she told my
mother that there was</b>
<br><b>a man in my room that looked like an Indian.&nbsp; A few weeks later
my 2 year</b>
<br><b>old nephew asked my mother who the man is with the funny hat.&nbsp;
My mother asked</b>
<br><b>him if the hat had feathers on it and he said yes.&nbsp; Through
the years</b>
<br><b>growing up, when strange things would happen we would always joke
and say the</b>
<br><b>"Indian did it."&nbsp; It took us all by surprise many years later
that my niece and</b>
<br><b>nephew would experience the same thing.&nbsp; Being that we live
in an area</b>
<br><b>known for Indians and only children have seen it, my theory is that
this is an</b>
<br><b>Indian ghost that protects or watches over children.&nbsp; I have
tried several</b>
<br><b>times to research this, but to date have not come up with anything.&nbsp;
If</b>
<br><b>anyone has any ideas please email me at TWeingartn@aol.com.</b>

outside i happen to be looking up at the night sky and the stars when i
heaed the sound of someone whos walking with out picking up their feet,when
i turned around i saw a soild figure of a man who stood about 6 feet tall
wearing a hat simullar to the kind worn by president Lincon.As i turned
back around to go back inside i glanced back to where the figure was standing
and there it was no move or sound. When i came back inside i told my father
what i had seen and he simply replied "see what happends when you dont

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; My History With Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ImATripp2U@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Until 1979, I lived in a home that dated back to at least the 1820's,
and</b>
<br><b>perhaps even earlier.&nbsp; The home had a full basement, first
floor, second floor, and an</b>
<br><b>attic that was divided into rooms with 8-10' ceilings. To get into
the attic</b>
<br><b>you had to lower a door (which was located in my room) by pulling
two levers. The</b>
<br><b>door would lower at one end to the floor, and there were steps built
in to</b>
<br><b>the back side of the door. The home was used as a duplex, one "apartment"
upstairs</b>
<br><b>on the second floor, where we lived, and the one on first floor
where an</b>
<br><b>elderly landlady lived.&nbsp; My brother, who is 13 months younger
than I am, and I had a number of weird experiences in that house. We used
to jokingly refer to the ghost as "Harry." Items used to disappear, only
to reappear in an obvious place at a later time.</b>
<br><b>Once, a friend who lived behind us refused to come to our house
for nearly a</b>
<br><b>year after swearing that someone "grabbed" her shoulder, but when
she</b>
<br><b>looked, no one was there. I remember often feeling "watched," and
having the feeling that someone was in the room with me. Although I realize
this sounds like "kid stuff," I</b>
<br><b>remember having an irrational fear of my closet. The only incident
I ever remember happening when my parents were around was one Sunday morning.&nbsp;
You entered the apartment in the kitchen, which was&nbsp; the center of
the apartment, and the other rooms opened up off of it. My bedroom was
to the left, then my parents' room, bathroom, living room, and my brother's
room. My father was sitting at the kitchen table, and I was laying</b>
<br><b>on the living room floor coloring. We had an old console stereo,
and suddenly</b>
<br><b>the stations started to "flip," like someone was turning the dial.
My father</b>
<br><b>started to yell, "Leave the doggone radio alooo...." and as he looked
up, saw</b>
<br><b>that I hadn't moved from the floor. He looked perplexed for a moment,
then</b>
<br><b>got up and went over to the stereo, where he looked at the dial.
It looked</b>
<br><b>like someone was spinning the dial back and forth. He put his hand
on the</b>
<br><b>dial to stop it, then turned it back to the station he had it on.
He stood</b>
<br><b>there for a moment, then went back to his newspaper in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen. He never said anything about it. The scariest thing by
far that happened though was in July 1979. My brother and I were 12 and
13 at the time, old enough to be by ourselves  especially with the landlady
right downstairs. My mom had gone to California with her mother and 2 other
relatives, and my dad was at work (second shift). My brother and I spent
all day cleaning out the attic, packing up stuff we were taking,</b>
<br><b>getting rid of, etc. We had boxes taped up and clearly marked of
things we</b>
<br><b>were taking with us, and garbage bags full of stuff to throw away.</b>
<br><b>About 10 p.m. that night, my brother and I were both in bed when
all sorts of</b>
<br><b>noises started coming from the attic. It sounded like someone was
up there</b>
<br><b>"stomping around", throwing things, and basically just throwing
a fit.&nbsp; After</b>
<br><b>a few minutes my brother came into my room and asked, "Were you
just upstairs?"</b>
<br><b>I told him "no," and asked if he had heard the noises as well. At
that point,</b>
<br><b>the noise escalated to the point I chased my brother back to his
room and</b>
<br><b>slept on the floor in his room. When my dad got home we told him
what had happened,</b>
<br><b>and he told us it was just our imaginations because we were home
alone.</b>
<br><b>My mother returned from California the next day, and we told her
what</b>
<br><b>happened.She just laughed and told us we were telling stories. When
we got home from</b>
<br><b>the airport, we went up in the attic, and it looked just like it
had sounded the</b>
<br><b>night before: like someone had pulled everything out of bags and
boxes and</b>
<br><b>thrown it everywhere tantrum! My mom got mad at us, and told us
she expected us to have attic finished and ready to move when she returned
from California. We tried to tell her that we had cleaned the attic, but
she didn't believe us. I remember my brother and I</b>
<br><b>saying goodbye to "Harry" when we left about 2 weeks later. It was
really scary, but</b>
<br><b>it was almost like he was upset we were leaving.The "new" house
we moved to was actually the house my mother grew up in.My great-grandfather
had built the house for he and my great-grandmother,and had died not too
long afterwards. My maternal grandmother and my grand-father lived in the
house with my great-grandmother until her death, around1950. My mother
has told me stories about she and her brothers and sisters</b>
<br><b>peeking down the stairs as they carried her body out of the house.
Finally, in</b>
<br><b>1979, my maternal grandparents decided to move to Florida, and offered
to</b>
<br><b>sell the house to my parents.Shortly after the move, my mother and
I had gotten into a major fight one day, and I was upstairs in my bedroom.
My desk was located between two windows, and when I sat at it my back was
to the door. I was sitting at my desk with</b>
<br><b>my head on folded arms crying when I felt someone patting and rubbing
my</b>
<br><b>back. It was comforting, but after a moment I realized that I'd
never heard</b>
<br><b>anyone come upstairs -- which were very noisy! I stiffened and began
to turn,</b>
<br><b>and the touch stopped.&nbsp; It was kind of creepy, but like I said,
comforting,</b>
<br><b>so I wasn't afraid. The second incident happened in November of
1979. I awoke at 4:05 in the morning. You know how you're suddenly wide
awake, and you lay there for a</b>
<br><b>minute trying to figure out what woke you up? I became aware of
someone</b>
<br><b>"sitting" on the edge of my bed near my knees, and when I looked,
there was</b>
<br><b>a depression as if someone were sitting there. I rubbed my eyes
and looked</b>
<br><b>again, and after a moment the sensation went away. I looked at the
clock and</b>
<br><b>made note of the time, and went back to sleep.</b>
<br><b>I proceeded to dream about my Uncle Joe. He had advanced cancer,
and had</b>
<br><b>lost a leg years earlier in a vehicle accident. I'd never seen him
with two</b>
<br><b>legs. In the dream, he had both legs, and was walking away from
me across a very</b>
<br><b>green field. He approached and climbed a hill, and as he reached
the top, he</b>
<br><b>turned around and waved at me, smiled, and went over the top.</b>
<br><b>When I got up for school that morning I told my mom what had happened,
and</b>
<br><b>she kind of laughed and thought it was funny. About 7 a.m. my aunt
called, and</b>
<br><b>told my mother that my uncle had died at 4 a.m. that morning! My
mother just</b>
<br><b>kind of looked at me and said, "Well, I guess your uncle came to
tell you</b>
<br><b>goodbye." I've asked my parents (who still live in the house) if
they've had any</b>
<br><b>experiences, but neither claim to have. I've stayed at the house
a number of times since</b>
<br><b>moving out, but nother further has happened.</b><b></b>
