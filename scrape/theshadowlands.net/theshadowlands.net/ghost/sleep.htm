<p><b><font size=+1>Sleep paralysis, also known as Old Hag, is a phenomenon
that is known, to some extent, by all cultures throughout the world. Some
people say attacking aliens are the cause of sleep paralysis,</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>

<b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>&nbsp;while others credit the "Devil" himself and/or
his minions, and if not that, then the classic "old hag" who sits on an
unsuspecting sleeping person's chest, and upon their waking realize they
are powerless to move. For what ends a hag would do this are as varied
as the cultures on the planet. Only the old hag does not always appear
as a grotesque elderly matron. For more on the legends and lore of similar
'old hag' experiences, see the bottom part of this page.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>&nbsp;</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Only in the last couple decades, and especially the
last 10 or so years, have researchers begun to seriously study this bizarre
happening. Nothing is as of yet in concrete, but we at least now have a
solid place to begin. And I would like to further add, that although we
may now have an explanation of the mechanics involved, it does not mean
we know WHY or WHAT causes this strange phenomenon to occur, but only explains
what is going on physically during an episode of sleep paralysis, or SP.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Sleep paralysis is a condition in which someone about
to fall asleep, or just upon waking from sleep, realizes that they are
unable to move or speak, but can still breathe and move their eyes. I like
to call this "half-asleep/half-awake" stage the "twilight" stage. Your
conscious mind has begun to drift into sleep but is not yet there, therefore
you still retain a small amount of your waking conscious. It is a very
transitory stage indeed, and one that seems to leave you "open" to certain
experiences you would not otherwise be receptive to when fully conscious
or fully asleep. It is also accepted by most researchers that although
this can happen in any sleeping position, it most commonly occurs in the
supine position (laying on your back).</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Once the person realizes they are unable to move, they
usually, but not always, leave this "twilight" stage and become fully awake,
but still paralyzed. At this point the experience can go either way. The
person may only experience a temporary paralysis, and after several seconds
or up to a minute or so would then regain their movement and the event
would be over. Researchers believe many people experience this at one point
in their lives.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>But the other scenario is much more frightening. Upon
realizing one is paralyzed, a whole gamut of hallucinations may occur.
Many people report hearing, seeing, and/or sensing a person or people in
the room with them while they are paralyzed. There is also the common experience
of a usually sensed, malevolent presence (or SMP). Note that not all sensed
presences are felt as being malevolent, but very frequently they are. These
SMP's usually seem to be just out of view of the person experiencing the
SP, who from here on in I will refer to as the 'subject', for the sole
purpose of easily identifying the one experiencing the SP. As a frequent
sufferer of sleep paralysis, I know that for me its relatively rare to
have an episode complete with the SMP, but it does happen, and when it
does, it is terrifying. The SMP is so incredibly intimidating and I feel
that this very evil, terrible "thing" is just right outside my field of
vision, and if I weren't paralyzed and was able to turn my ahead just an
inch or so, I would be able to see this horrid thing. At least, that's
the feeling I get, and other sufferer's of SP have reported the same.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Sometimes it is reported that the subject feels crushed,
smothered, or pushed into the bed. There are auditory hallucinations as
well. A voice or voices may be heard, as well as footsteps. A loud buzzing
noise is sometimes reported.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<center>
<p><img SRC="sp2.gif" height=96 width=108></center>
<b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Out-of-Body experiences are also frequently reported
with SP, along with the sensation of floating and sometimes of "falling"
through the bed.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<center>
<p><img SRC="sp3.jpg" height=152 width=206></center>
<b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>During SP a person may try to cry out or "fight" the
presence they believe is responsible for causing them to be paralyzed.
This has never helped me nor anyone else I've ever heard of, but somehow
we have the innate feeling that we must "fight" this feeling. Usually movement
returns slowly, usually within a minute or so.</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>These hallucinations are called hypnagogic and hypnopompic
hallucinations. These hallucinations are given these names because they
occur at the onset of sleep, and the period just before waking, the period
I call the 'twilight' stages of sleep. They can be auditory, visual, tactile
and proprioceptive. A&nbsp; proprioceptor is a sensory receptor found mainly
in the joints, muscles, tendons and inner ear that detects motion and can
also can detect the position of a limb by responding to internal stimuli.
This means when a person feels smashed into the bed or a creature is sitting
on their chest that it really can be a VERY convincing hallucination. So
I'd say that is possibly one of the single greatest arguments for a pro-"it's
all in your mind" stance on SP. Because of proprioceptors we can feel as
though we're&nbsp; falling through the bed,&nbsp; even though we actually
are lying quite stationary, it can be among the most convincing of all
hallucinations. I have never heard anyone mention gustatory hallucinations
(relating to the nerve in the tip of our tongue responsible for the sense
of taste), and have never hallucinated like that in any of my 'bouts' of
SP.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>From my "research into other peoples' research"&nbsp;
I have found a few people ('people' meaning&nbsp; doctor's studying sleep
research and/or their students contributing to the research) that agree
there can be several outside contributing factors to SP. Stress, emotional
or physical, and one you have no power over, adolescence. The first time
I heard this I automatically thought about the correlation between poltergeists
and adolescent children, pre-pubescent or pubescent. Of course my train
of thought ended there because I have no specialized skills in psychology,
parapsychology or kids.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>It is very hard to believe it is a hallucination, but,
after all, that's what a hallucination proper is. This, however, does not
make the experience any less terrifying. While it is happening it feels
pretty damn real! And remember, this is not written in stone. This is scientific
theory, not scientific fact. Who's to say these experiences aren't real?
Or for that matter, more real than anything we've ever experienced? Maybe
they can be so terrifying because it's a reality experienced on a totally
different level.&nbsp; So who's to say these aren't angels here to show
us another place? Maybe our fear is the totally normal and understandable
fear of not wanting to leave our physical bodies. Maybe it's NO ONE showing
us anything, maybe we are doing the looking and the searching all on our
own. And then again, maybe it's just all in our heads.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<center>
<p><img SRC="sp4.jpg" height=235 width=146></center>
<b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Or conversely, something altogether more sinister.
Maybe it is something so innately evil, even if we want to 'go with the
flow' and see where the experience takes us, the deepest part of our minds
will not let us, perhaps because we somehow already know of this nemesis.
Who knows, maybe it's just gas. And maybe it's not, hmmm.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>

<b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Some researchers at Waterloo University have done some
of the most intense research on SP. They have studied the REM dream states
and compared them to SP with hypnogogic and hypnopompic hallucinations,
(or HHE's) and have found some interesting results. While we are dreaming
in a normal REM state, our minds send out a message to our body's to cease
our normal motor functions, our muscles "turn off" in a sense, so that
we do not act out our dreams. This keeps us from possibly doing damage
to ourselves or those around us. While in an REM state, we are experiencing
stimuli manufactured from within our own minds, effectively "tuning out"
the world around us.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>REM SP with HHE's differ from a normal period of REM
in two significant ways. 1.) There is little or no blocking of external
stimulation, and 2.) the sufferer of SP regains full consciousness,&nbsp;
they were in the "twilight" stage of sleep, e.g. sleep onset or sleep offset,
and instead of falling into a deeper sleep state,&nbsp;&nbsp; the person
regains consciousness but continues to 'dream', almost always believing
at the time that it is really happening and not being manufactured by their
own mind.&nbsp; Researchers believe the paralysis is due to the failure
of the brains neurons to "remind" the body it is now awake so it is unable
to move (called muscle atonia). And remember, not only is the person unable
to move, but they are also "dreaming while awake", a condition that is
very confusing and frightening. The hallucinations they encounter seem
every bit as real as you sitting in front of the computer right now. This
theory seems wrong to me, or at least it doesn't seem to apply to my SP.
Dreams are very distinct, they have an obvious 'surrealness' about them,
whereas my SP is a totally different thing. It's hard to explain, but if
you've experienced SP, I KNOW you know what I mean. (right?!) Since I believe
my SP is something more, is it solely because I want to think I'm 'special'
in some weird twisted way or is it because I am being genuinely fooled
by these hallucinations which I can almost swear to are not a dream of
any kind, sleeping or awake? It is so VERY HARD to be objective when you're
nothing BUT subjective when it comes to your own self. I try to step out
of my 'self' and see my SP as a total stranger would, and I must say when
I do that, the logic part of mind says there's a perfectly plausible explanation
for SP, that there is no such thing as monsters, etc. However, I can't
retain that opinion for long, because I DO believe in monsters! I use that
term loosely, mind you! But I do happen to believe in ghosts, God, and
a whole 'nother world that lives alongside ours that we do not have the
tools to identify or quantify. But I also do whole-heartedly believe that
Logic exists, also. You can see I am torn.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Anyway, during&nbsp; episodes of hallucinogenic SP,
the mind is not only accepting outside stimulation, but is also 'warping'
it in much the same way as our dream states warp information. Its a melding
of the two worlds, only the subject is not asleep.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>It is not hard to see why demons, devils, and other
beasties of the night have been blamed for these nocturnal 'attacks'. Virtually
all cultures with a written or oral history has some kind of form of SP
they have reported, and with that a usually very colorful explanation as
to why these things happen. But if you're of an occult mind, or just an
open one, it's also not hard to see why scary folk of the night would take
advantage of us while in such a vulnerable position. Either way, legend
and lore abounds. SP is more commonly known as Old Hag, and the origin
for this title may have roots as far back as the Sumerians. Ardat lili
or Lilitu, an evil hag-demon, was said to have the power of flight, which
she preferred to do at night when she would attack men in their sleep.
This seems a very obvious reference to the original Lilith, who refused
to lay on her back when laying with Adam, and was therefore thrown out
of Eden for a more suitable (docile) mate for Adam. After she was thrown
out of Eden a myriad of things happened, depending on who you hear tell
it, but a few things remain constant, Lilith flew away and is now the eater
of children, hers and others alike. (If they be her children, we at least
know which position they were not bore. Ha.) She is a disgusting old hag,
(aren't all women who do not marry and obey they're men?!!) who now flies
over the land at night seeking revenge for being thrown out of Eden.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>But this myth is hardly unique, as many she-devils
and hag-demons have, over time, made their presence known in mythology.
They take credit for the nocturnal assaults for one reason or another.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Surprisingly, though, is the consistency of such reports
made by societies and cultures with no previous knowledge of each other
or their lore. The main details remain constant. A man or woman is attacked
during the night, usually lying on their back, when an evil entity sits
upon their body, causes paralysis, and even sometimes chokes or smothers
it's victim. Though their motivation may differ, (possession, revenge,
or just wanting to upset the living) the attack remains strikingly similar.
And these stories are not limited to Western cultures, in fact, quite the
contrary. In Thailand people refer to being Phi um (ghost covered) and
phi kau (ghost possessed), and these experiences include a feeling of pressure,
paralysis, and something black covering the body. In Japan, kanashibara
("to tie with an iron rope") is a common known and accepted experience.
In the Far North one speaks of agumangia (Inupik) or ukomiarik (Yupik)
in which "a soul" tries to take possession of the paralyzed victim. In
Laos, da chor is described as follows: "You want to listen, you can't hear;
you want to speak, you are dumb; you want to call out, you cannot; you
feel you are dying, dying; you want to run away. You piss with fear in
your sleep"</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Truly, the area of research dealing with SP is in it's
infancy. Researchers are always on the lookout for sufferers of this bizarre
yet not too uncommon condition. If you feel you suffer from SP, there are
a number of websites on the internet that have surveys you can take. By
just answering a few questions you could possibly help researchers attain
a deeper understanding of this bizarre phenomena. And you never know, maybe
there IS some truth in the old legends!</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>&nbsp;</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Finally, one last question that needs to be looked
at here, how does one avoid a episode of SP? The most advice anyone who
works closely with people who have ongoing SP can come up with is this:
Don't sleep in the supine position. (Don't sleep on your back.) The reason
for this is that most people are in the supine position when they have
an episode of SP, so researchers believe that is the key to understanding
what is going on when SP grips an innocent sleeper. What is so different
when one lies on their back? Well, I can tell you from personal experience
that that is not the case, at least not for me. Although I have noticed
I'll be lying on my back frequently when SP strikes, it still doesn't matter
if I move to another position because&nbsp; no matter how I sleep, SP can
strike at any time. With me, I tend to have it more when I lie on my side
anyway, but I have had SP in almost any and every sleeping position you
could imagine.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
