<b>Spirits in my life</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: b.august@iopener.net</b>
<p><b>Being a single mother of two, I had a lot to do at home, the house
was a two bedroom frame painted white with green trim, neatly kept yard
and large basement. My two year old son and fourteen year old daughter
played through the summer months, outside in the yard in nice weather,
inside in the den and their bedrooms in rain or fog, we had lots of fog
living near the sea. The house had been refurbished by a couple married
late in life, the wife a short cute woman in her forties, the husband thirty-seven
loved her to distraction, he built sidewalks and cut designs in to the
concrete and painted lovely colors over the sections creating a picture
of love from his heart, she had been married to a beast of a man, beatings
were a daily thing, she ran away many times but he found her and almost
killed her twice, while in the hospital recovering from near death after
another beating. An attorney was brought to her room,&nbsp; a sheriff brought
him and stood by and witnessed while she was legaly divorced and all her
money and property returned to her, she couldn't understand how this could
happen, bandages covered most</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;of her face, a skull fracture left her dazed, a judge entered
and signed the divorce decree, in a small town where her family had been
respected since the town was formed, they gave her husband a choice, sign
these papers or go to prison for attempted murder. He signed and was driven
to the edge of town and put on a bus headed to Mississippi with the driver
a deputy sheriff, there to escort him all the way.Her second marriage was
six years later, she had worked to get her life together, scars were on
her face and arms left to remind her love does not last, she met a handsome
carpenter, he began coming to her church, he began courting her, she was
cold to him, after all her friends and loved ones told her he was deeply
in love with her, she finally agreed to marry him, but he got none of her
money ever. He agreed to that, he had a good business, he worked building
homes and reconstruction of antique houses that needed the love his hands
created . Two years passed they lived quietly, he had many friends and
so did she, the cottage she owned needed attention, he began to do many
lovely things to keep it nice for her, the yards glowed with colors, different
flowers for all seasons, they lived there content, but she never trusted
him fully and told him so many times. The phone rang several times, she
was sleeping in, he and two workers had left in the big flat bed truck
to go to the city , one more day would finish a job there and the money
was good, he had an investment in mind, life was good. Two busses&nbsp;
traveling down highway 101, passed one another twice, one falling in behind
the other then pulling out again, they did this until the passengers began
to get nervous, the truck was there, nobody saw it come around the bend
in the highway, the bus had pulled out again, right into the path of the
on coming truck, with the happy manand his workers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
headed for the final day on a big job, with the good payday. She buried
him in the nicest gravesite she could find, she walked in a daze, she didn't
cry, she was all business, every body thought she didn't really love him,
she loved him. She lasted three months, she stopped eating, no water touched
her lips, she was already dead inside, she stood looking at the lovely
yard all blossoms of every color filled the whole area,the air filled with
fragrance, as she stood looking at a fountain he had placed gold fish and
turned on the lights built into the edge of the ledge he had put there
for her to sit and watch the fish as they flashed gold against the dancing
light as it touched the ripples of the water, she had loved it but never
told him . She died, her friends found her body in their bed, covered with
the silk bedspread they bought in San Francisco just last month. It was
easy to get into the cottage, she kept the doors and windows open so he
could get in when he came home. I was told this story by many people once
they knew I had moved my family into the cottage, I never thought</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;anything about it being anything more than romantic. Until
one night I saw a dark shadow standing in the bathroom, I rushed toward
the open bathroom door and pushed in, no body was there, I had seen a tall
heavy set form standing inside the bathroom, but no body was any place
in the house except my two children and me. That night some loud knocking
woke my daughter, it was coming from her closet, thinking it was her little
brother playing a game, she got up and tho sleepy and ticked off at his
silly two a m games, she opened the closet door, the kitchen light was
on, and light shined into her room, she could see clearly, nobody was there
but something brushed past her. She looked all over the house and got me
and her sleeping brother up to search, no door or window lock was open.Two
weeks passed, my daughter was in the kitchen, a pink mist passed thru the
room in front of her, that was the last we saw of any thing different or
unusual, it all stopped and we lived there two more good and happy years,
not a day passed that I didn't think of the lovers who never really exchanged
feelings of love for one another, but all anyone had to do to be sure ,
look out at the yard and the gold fish flitting about in the fountain while
the lights are shining against the rippling water.</b>

<br><b>Grandma &amp; Grandpa's House</b>
<p><b>By: 1cartoon@home.com</b>
<p><b>When I live in my Grandparents house, after they passed away, I was
totally excited!&nbsp; I was on my own and living in a house on the river
that was so fun to live in.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I experienced some phanomanons
that really freeked me out!&nbsp;&nbsp; One day I was just sitting in the
livingroom, by myself, and I felt some kind of presents in the upper corner
of the room.&nbsp; I don't know why but I found myself talking to it saying
"I know you are there, what do you want?!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nothing ever came of it except for my knowing I was talking to my grandmother
somehow.&nbsp; Days and Nights went by and I still occationally felt a
presents (it is hard to explain).&nbsp;&nbsp; One night my boyfriend was
staying the night with me, and we were sleeping in what used to be my mothers
room (I would never go into my granparents room which was just in the next
room).&nbsp; After we were asleep I heard the sound of someone cutting
the window in my grandparents room.&nbsp; It sounded like someone was breaking
into the house!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few minutes later, a shadow
of a man was peeking into the doorway of the room I was in.&nbsp; I was
so scared that I couldn't breathe.&nbsp; I really thought I was going to
die because there was an intruder standing right in the doorway of the
bedroom.&nbsp; The shadow was scarry because it was so tall, and stood
there</b>
<br><b>for such a long time. I WAS SCARED BEYOND BELIEFE.&nbsp; (my boyfriend
never woke up to confirm the situation, and I really tried to wake him,
quietly).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was just like a scarry movie
where you try to wake the other person and they just lay there totally
asleep.&nbsp; The dark figure in the doorway was staring into the room
for such a long time, and then it just went away.&nbsp; It was days later
that I reolized that a burgler couldn't have entered the house and it must
have been an apperation because the window in the other room was undisturbed.
Then another day the sterio in the livingroom started changing channels
by itself!&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran to another room and called my sister because
I was so freeked out.&nbsp; She tried to tell me there was probably some
cause for it, and not to worry about it.&nbsp; I could hear the radio change
from one station to another, with the static in between, and I was not
doing it!!!!!!!!... No one could convince me that there was a logical reason
for the interference, or the way it was happening.Another time,&nbsp; my
sister spent the night with me.&nbsp; We had been so afraid in the middle
of the night because we , both of us,heard foot steps go from my grandparents
room, to the kitchen.&nbsp; Then the water from the faucet turned on, and
foot steps went back to their bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After
reolizing that there is no possible way wood could creek in such a uniform
manor,&nbsp; we remembered how my grandmother used to get up in the middle
of the night to get my grandfathers medicine and brint it to him. Now,
it was not just me hearing these things, but some one else.&nbsp; I was
told that it is just the wood settled, but since I had someone else there,
and they were able to hear what I was talking about, I knew It was not
just my imagination. This house was still harboring my grandparents daily
routines!!!!&nbsp; People have moved into this place, and they have remodled,
but we have never asked them if they have heard anything out of</b>
<br><b>the ordinary.I wonder if they are still there??!!</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;Granpa's Ghostly Eferdent Tablet</b>
<p><b>By: zumbars@fidalgo.net</b>
<p><b>This story happen to me in 1988. My grandfather had died, and his
second wife had moved out of his home. My parents,Aunt, Uncle and my two
year old Son went to his home for a final inspection before turning it
over to the Realtor to sell. The house was completely empty, and spotless.
I was walking around, remembering all the summers I had spent there, and
suddenly I just felt like my Grandparents were there, and were trying to
let me know they were. It was really earie. I said in my head, Grandma,
Grampa, if you are here, and you can hear me, give me a sign. Well I walked
into a bathroom I had just been in, and there on the floor, perfectly positioned
in the middle of the floor, was a denture tablet that had not been there
a minute before. I knew this was them, because we had always teased them
about how they looked when they took out their teeth, and they knew this
sign would make me laugh. I ran out to get the rest of the family to come
and see, and when we got back&nbsp; to the bathroom, the tablet was nowhere
to be found.</b>

<br><b>Ghostly Experiences?</b>
<p><b>By: gsuszkowski@dc.com</b>
<p><b>I have been reading all of these stories and would like to share
the experiences that I have encountered over the last few years.</b>
<br><b>My name is Greg and my wife and I bought a house in the boro of
Forest Hills, a small town just east of Pittsburgh. We have been in the
house since the spring of 1998. The house is approximately 80 years old,
as are the rest of the houses in the neighborhood. They were built by the
Westinghouse Corp. for their employees between 1919 and 1923. As one would
expect, the house needed some cosmetic work done before we could fully
move in. My wife Carla and I spent most of the month of June '98 refinishing
hardwood floors, tearing done old paneling, painting, putting in bathroom
fixtures and all that goes into refurbishing older homes. I know very little
of the history of the former occupants, but I do know that previous owners
did not have the best taste in decorating :) (Lime green and yellow trim?)</b>
<br><b>Anyway, shortly after we finished and moved in odd things began
to happen. The house has ceiling fans in just about every room. During
that summer we would go to work, knowing we turned all the fans off, and
come home to find one or more of the</b>
<br><b>fans on! This happened on several different occasions. My wife is
a stickler for turning them off because of the fear of fire and the electric
bill. That kind of freaked us out at first.Passing this off as our forgetfulness,
we didn't think much of it. Then, I guess the next incident happened in
the Fall of '99. My wife was already in bed asleep. I usually go to bed
later than she and she has the habit of falling asleep with the TV on.
As I was getting into bed, I hit the remote turning off Jay Leno, when
all of a sudden on or in the wall behind the bed came 3 loud and deliberate
bangs on the wall. They were very LOUD! BANG-BANG-BANG just as the TV went
off. It rattled&nbsp; the picture hanging on that very wall, I remember
this distinctly. I got up and searched the entire house, basement and even
outside. Nothing. My wife slept through the entire thing. I told her the
story and I think she believes it. I couldn't believe she slept through
it!</b>
<br><b>The floors downstairs are very creaky as you would expect in old
homes. There are particularly loud when going into the living room from
the dining room. Loud enough that you can hear them throughout the house.
Since the banging incident we have both heard, independently and together,
what seems to sound like a person walking between the rooms. This always
happens at between 3:30 and 4:00AM and just at this time. My wife woke
me the first time she heard this thinking someone had gotten in, but upon
investigation there wasn't anyone there. As a matter of fact I woke up
to the noise 2 nights ago, at 3:30AM!</b>
<br><b>Well, I'll try to wrap this up. I know I heard my name called when
I was showering one day, I answered thinking it my wife, but she said she
never said anything and was downstairs in the kitchen. I have also thought
that late at night while on the computer I have seen the typical shadows
darting just out of the corner of my eye and the feeling that something
or somebody else is in the room. I have also heard what I keep thinking
is footfalls on the upstairs hallway carpeting. The sound of shoes scuffing
the carpet. Maybe it's me or the old house settling or both. I just don't
know.</b>

<p><b>Grandpa</b>
<p><b>By: corbymead@yahoo.com</b>
<p><b>Ever since I can remember I have been sensitive to paranormal activity,
which is something my grandmother says runs on our side of the family.&nbsp;
Anyway, in the summer of 1998 my wife was pregnant with our first child
and my grandpa was dying of cancer.&nbsp; It was a very stressful time
for me.&nbsp; I was always real close to my Grandpa, mostly because he
gave me my first guitar and taught me how to play it.&nbsp; This meant
allot to me because I now play lead guitar for a local band and have had
the time of my life because of it.&nbsp; My grandpa had got cancer when
my wife was about 5 months pregnant and not long after that his cancer
got worse.&nbsp; He was put in the VA Hospital about a week before my wife
gave birth and the only thing I wanted (after finding out the baby was
alright) was for my grandpa to get to see her.&nbsp; Out of nowhere my
Grandfather recovered enough that he could go home.&nbsp; He got to hold
her one time before the cancer took a strong hold on him for the last time.&nbsp;
The next Two months of his life were spent in agony and mostly without
any mental capacity.&nbsp; My Daughter was just about to turn Two years
old the next time I would visit him (his grave).&nbsp; My wife, daughter
and I went to the grave yard and I "talked" to papaw for about 15 minutes
before we decided to go.&nbsp; we turned to leave and there was a big dog
standing just inside the entrance to the cemetery.&nbsp; We stopped and
the dog just stood there, tilted it's head slightly and bolted the</b>
<br><b>other direction with it's tail between it's legs.&nbsp; We started
towards the car and my daughter turned around, started waving and saying
goodbye.&nbsp; I didn't think much of it till we got home and my daughter
(who can talk pretty good for a 2 year old) was telling my best friend
that there was a doggie and papaw made it go away.&nbsp; Hearing that made
me start crying right then and there, I'm a little misty eyed now thinking
about it.&nbsp; I loved my papaw very much and I'm glad that he got to
see his great grand daughter again.Sorry the story was so long, I hope
you enjoyed it.</b>
<br><b>P.S.&nbsp; I have allot more experiences to share, this one just
meant the most to me.</b>

<br><b>Haunted House...TX style</b>
<p><b>By: cherie@ctesc.net</b>
<p><b>In 1977 or thereabouts, I moved to Kerrville, TX to be near my eldest</b>
<br><b>daughter.&nbsp; I worked as a map draftsman for a now defunct&nbsp;
map company</b>
<br><b>about 15 miles from there. Kerrville began as a small TX town founded
by</b>
<br><b>an ex-Ranger..was a&nbsp; rather cliqueish town, one department
store,city</b>
<br><b>hall, a couple of churches. In the 50's it became the home of a</b>
<br><b>silversmith who capitalized on the "hippie" movement's wearing of
silver</b>
<br><b>crosses.&nbsp; His business is now national and well-known. Kerrville
is now</b>
<br><b>much larger, in the Hill Country and a mecca for the retired Military.</b>
<br><b>I rented a small Victorian home, suddenly vacated by&nbsp; two couples
who</b>
<br><b>shared it.&nbsp; My job required me to be at work at 7 a.m., so
sleep was</b>
<br><b>vital.&nbsp; I was raised in a family accepting ghosts as a natural</b>
<br><b>phenomena, but they still frightened me.&nbsp; I am an artist and
was a</b>
<br><b>musician which probably heightens my sensitivity. If there is a</b>
<br><b>spirit..my initial impression is of a "shadowy" area. There was
such an</b>
<br><b>area in the kitchen in front of the sink, although there was a window</b>
<br><b>above the sink so it was well lighted. On the first night, my little
dog</b>
<br><b>and I retired...I have a habit of shutting my bedroom door.&nbsp;
Soon there</b>
<br><b>was activity outside my door,(the LR).&nbsp; Definite movement,
throwing of</b>
<br><b>things around.&nbsp; This continued each night until I began to
sleep on my</b>
<br><b>daughter's couch for a few nights.&nbsp; Her husband objected.&nbsp;
He's a</b>
<br><b>skeptic and I knew it wouldn't help if I explained.&nbsp; Across
from my bed</b>
<br><b>was a solid wall of casement windows.&nbsp; Not able to afford curtains,
I</b>
<br><b>hung sheets over these.&nbsp; When I came home from work, they would
always</b>
<br><b>be on the floor. There was a closet door in my room that would not
stay</b>
<br><b>shut.&nbsp; The last night I spent in the house, I dragged a heavy</b>
<br><b>bonnet-type hair dryer over to hold the door shut. The door creaked
open</b>
<br><b>in front of my eyes as I sat shaking in my room...not as soon as
I</b>
<br><b>closed it....but hours later in the middle of the night.&nbsp; I
began</b>
<br><b>sleeping in the car with my dog in the driveway,and&nbsp; trying
to find</b>
<br><b>another house. An older couple who lived across the street came
to the</b>
<br><b>door one afternoon and told me they had noticed I was sleeping in
the</b>
<br><b>car and told me the story of the house.&nbsp; It was built for a
lady by her</b>
<br><b>husband, they raised two sons there.The husband died.&nbsp; Later,
the old</b>
<br><b>lady had stomach cancer and was in a nursing home.&nbsp; In the
final stages,</b>
<br><b>she begged her son to let her go to her home.&nbsp; He lived in
another city</b>
<br><b>and travelled.&nbsp; She would be in pain and go to the kitchen
and drink</b>
<br><b>milk to ease it.&nbsp; She died in the kitchen and lay there for
days until</b>
<br><b>her son came to town to check on her. They couldn't open the door</b>
<br><b>because her body was wedged against it.&nbsp; She died in the "shadowy"</b>
<br><b>area.&nbsp; I guess she didn't want others in her home and sheets
at her</b>
<br><b>bedroom windows.</b>

<br><b>Silhouetted, hoop skirted, door shadow</b>
<p><b>By: bpcoffey@gis.net</b>
<p><b>My ex-boyfriend lived in a very old part of town in a house that
was</b>
<br><b>built in the 1800's.&nbsp; At one time, the home had been a stately
and</b>
<br><b>elegant one, with a long and gracefully curving stair as the focal
point</b>
<br><b>upon entrance into the foyer.&nbsp; Through time, and with the coming
of</b>
<br><b>rough economic periods, the home grew into disrepair and was eventually</b>
<br><b>sectioned off into a two family home. One side housed a family of
bikers</b>
<br><b>whose moonshine sent many a folk into orbit (we didn't have any</b>
<br><b>moonshine the night this happened) and in the other lived my boyfriend</b>
<br><b>and his roommate.</b>
<br><b>One night myself,&nbsp; my boyfriend Nick, Nick's friend Dave, and
my friend</b>
<br><b>Stacy, who was dating Dave at the time, were at the house.&nbsp;
We were</b>
<br><b>descending the grand staircase I mentioned earlier on our way out
to</b>
<br><b>enjoy our Saturday night.&nbsp; All was dark, except for the soft
lighting</b>
<br><b>coming from the kitchen which was illuminating the front doorway.</b>
<br><b>On the front door we saw the unmistakable silhouette of a woman
in a</b>
<br><b>long old fashioned hoop skirt like women wore in the 1800's.&nbsp;
She scared</b>
<br><b>the wits out of me and Stacy and we both refused to go any further
down</b>
<br><b>the stairs until the rest of the lights were put on.&nbsp; Chickens,
aren't</b>
<br><b>we?&nbsp; Although Nick and Dave were in a position to see the woman"s

<br><b>The Black Figure at My Bedroom Door!</b>
<p><b>By: Ron78979@cs.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I've always been hesitnt to talk about this story, but what I tell
you is</b>
<br><b>true!&nbsp; In 1992 when I was seperated from my wife for the first
time I was</b>
<br><b>living at Old Farm in an apartment.&nbsp; One Saturday night when
my kids were off</b>
<br><b>to their grandmothers and my girlfriend who was a teacher had an
event to</b>
<br><b>attend, I found myself in my apartment alone.&nbsp; I rented a couple
of movies,</b>
<br><b>ordered a Pizza Hut, went over to the whirl pool for awhile, and
sat down to</b>
<br><b>enjoy a peaceful night alone at last.&nbsp; I was really looking
forward to a</b>
<br><b>night by myself!</b>
<br><b>When I was reading in bed, I noticed a black sillouetted figure
standing in</b>
<br><b>my bedroom door.&nbsp; The figure appeared to have a cloak drawn
over its head.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>could not recognize any features nor was there any attempt to verbally</b>
<br><b>communicate.&nbsp; I was wide awake and terrified.&nbsp; My heart
was racing and I kept</b>
<br><b>pulling the covers over my head.&nbsp; It seemed like every second
was one of</b>
<br><b>terror.&nbsp; The figure stood in my doorway well into the morning
hours.&nbsp; I knew</b>
<br><b>my eyes were as big as they could get.&nbsp; When the sillouette
disappeared, I</b>
<br><b>was covered with sweat.&nbsp; My hair was ringing wet.&nbsp; When
the sillouette</b>
<br><b>disappeared, I rushed out to the front room because I really couldn't
believe</b>
<br><b>it had left me.&nbsp; No, the only thing I had to drink was a Diet
Coke with</b>
<br><b>popcorn.&nbsp; I'm not a big drinker.</b>
<br><b>After the ordeal, I quickly showered, and raced off to go hiking.&nbsp;
I can</b>
<br><b>honestly tell you that no communication with the figure was made.&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>would ask who are you, there was no response.&nbsp; This went on
all night until</b>
<br><b>by the grace of God it went away.&nbsp; This event has always effected
my life.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>know of another person who had a similiar experience like mine.</b>
<br><b>Can you tell me what was standing in my door, why there was no communication,</b>
<br><b>and why me!&nbsp; Have you ever had any stories like this reported
to you!&nbsp; Until</b>
<br><b>now, the only person I ever told this story to was a good friend
who is a</b>
<br><b>Catholic priest.&nbsp; It still scares me to tell this story!&nbsp;
Why was there no</b>

<br><b>The Front Door</b>
<p><b>By: francis.grogan@fmglobal.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>My father loved the state of Maine. Not enough however to give up
his cush</b>
<br><b>job in Boston to live on the going wage of a "downeaster". So every
summer</b>
<br><b>from the mid 50's until I reached high school we would vacation
on the</b>
<br><b>scenic Maine coast. Very seldom would we stay in the same place
twice.</b>
<br><b>Usually it was some remote cottage located on the outskirts of some
tiny</b>
<br><b>coastal town.</b>
<br><b>A two week ordeal was in store for me with no TV or friends to speak
of. To</b>
<br><b>keep me sane my mother would buy me comic books and play board games
with me long into the night.</b>
<br><b>We'd been at this cottage now for about ten days and I was counting
the</b>
<br><b>hours until we would leave. It was a chilly August night and dear
old dad</b>
<br><b>had a few to many and drifted off to bed.</b>
<br><b>Our terrier "Joe" was snoozing on the carpet in front of the fireplace
and</b>
<br><b>through the big picture window the surf was like something out of
a south</b>
<br><b>pacific movie. The waves were gently breaking on the rocky shore
not twenty</b>
<br><b>yards from the cottage. The only sound was the revelry coming from
a cruise</b>
<br><b>ship that was passing off the point, in summary the night was calm.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly Joe jumped to his feet with his hackles up and growled
at the door.</b>
<br><b>I yelled at the dog to be quiet as he'd interrupted our card game.
In an</b>
<br><b>instant the front door blew open and with a bang it hit the interior
wall.</b>
<br><b>Needless to say nothing was there. Joe cowered and my mother's hair
moved</b>
<br><b>like it had been ruffled by some invisible breeze. The playing cards</b>
<br><b>scattered about and before we could take a breath the door slammed
shut and</b>
<br><b>Joe went back to his sleeping position.</b>
<br><b>We decided not to tell the old man as he wouldn't believe it anyway.
A few</b>
<br><b>days later we were filling up the old Plymouth for the return trip
to</b>
<br><b>Boston, and my father started gabbing with the local about his vacation.</b>
<br><b>With the windows of the car down we heard every word.</b>
<br><b>"So where did you stay?" The man asked with a maine dialect. "Down
on the</b>
<br><b>point at the Jensen cottage", my old man answered.</b>
<br><b>"Folks around here know that place well," the man said flatly.....they
refer</b>
<br><b>to it as the front door!"</b>

<p><b>Haunted In England</b>
<p><b>By: john.ligema@ntlworld.com</b>
<p><b>My name is John. I am 41 years of age and currently live in the city
of</b>
<br><b>Lincoln, England.</b>
<br><b>During my life to date I have seen several ghosts and whilst I still
find</b>
<br><b>them surprising and fascinating I am no longer afraid of whatever
they are,</b>
<br><b>or appear to be.</b>
<br><b>I saw my first ghost at around the age of eight whilst living in
my</b>
<br><b>childhood home - a large Victorian house on the edge of Manchester,
England.</b>
<br><b>The ghost was one of a young boy of a similar age to mine at the
time; he</b>
<br><b>was leaning over the banister rail of the stairway landing outside
my</b>
<br><b>bedroom as I was making my way up to bed. The shock and surprise
of seeing</b>
<br><b>him sent me flying downstairs into the front room of my house; needless
to</b>
<br><b>say that none of my family appeared to believe what I told them
I had seen.</b>
<br><b>Although over the years I have experienced strong sensations of
ghostly</b>
<br><b>presence's, my next positive encounter was not until I was 22 whilst
living</b>
<br><b>and working in the city of Newcastle upon Tyne in northern England.
I had</b>
<br><b>obtained the keys to a vacant industrial building which my firm
were taking</b>
<br><b>over. My job was to assess the work involved in converting the building
for</b>
<br><b>its future use. I had locked myself in the building (and was therefore
sure</b>
<br><b>that no other person was on the premises) and was proceeding up
some steep</b>
<br><b>and narrow stairs when I felt a hand touch the top of my head and
give my</b>
<br><b>hair a friendly ruffle - rather like an affectionate parent may
give their</b>
<br><b>child; I immediately turned round only to find the stairway completely</b>
<br><b>empty. Surprised, but not afraid this time, I continued my inspection
of the</b>
<br><b>building. We moved into the premises, and although I had my office
at the</b>
<br><b>top of the stairs where I had my encounter, and worked there often
late into</b>
<br><b>the night, I never saw, heard or felt anything unusual there again.</b>
<br><b>My next encounter took place right here in Lincoln, about three
years ago.</b>
<br><b>Walking our dog out late one night I noticed a cyclist approaching
me along</b>
<br><b>a side street.</b>
<br><b>I thought the cyclist appeared a little unusual in so far as he
was riding</b>
<br><b>an old style 'sit up and beg' cycle. His hairstyle looked rather
old</b>
<br><b>fashioned too, and most curiously of all he appeared to be wearing
an old</b>
<br><b>style Royal Air Force uniform. I could see the street light reflecting
off</b>
<br><b>the silver buttons on his uniform tunic and from the chrome handlebars
of</b>
<br><b>his cycle. He got to within about 30 yards of me when for some reason
I</b>
<br><b>glanced down for a second. When I looked up again he had completely</b>
<br><b>disappeared from the street, and there was no way in which he could
have</b>
<br><b>left the street in the vicinity of where I last saw him. I wonder
whether</b>
<br><b>his appearance was in some way connected to the fact that there
used to be</b>
<br><b>an open air swimming pool adjacent to where I saw him. This pool
was very</b>
<br><b>popular with aircrews during W.W.II, and I can only assume he may
have been</b>
<br><b>on his way for a midnight swim...</b>
<br><b>My most recent encounter was very brief, occurring during the first
time I</b>
<br><b>visited my mother's cottage in North Wales. Built around 200 years
ago, the</b>
<br><b>back room opens directly out into the rear garden, with the narrow
stairs</b>
<br><b>descending into the back room right beside the back door to the
building.</b>
<br><b>Whilst coming down the stairs I saw an elderly woman walk in through
the</b>
<br><b>back door and disappear. She was aged about 80, approximately 5
feet tall,</b>
<br><b>wearing a grey dress with long sleeves, a white apron and her straight
grey</b>
<br><b>hair was tied up in a sort of bun which in turn was covered by a
small</b>
<br><b>kerchief on the top of her head. She was followed immediately by
a young</b>
<br><b>girl aged about 10 or 12 dressed in a long light coloured smock.
Her hair</b>
<br><b>was long, blonde and straight, falling down her back. She also disappeared</b>
<br><b>straight away.</b>
<br><b>I have no idea what ghosts are, or why they appear. I do not see
them as</b>
<br><b>threatening, in fact on more than one occasion a curious sensation
of</b>
<br><b>contentment seems to fill the air after they have gone. I have noticed
that</b>
<br><b>my mind is often not thinking about anything in particular at the
times I</b>
<br><b>have come across them.</b>

<p><b>Haunted place?</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: WNYWitch@aol.com</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grew up in Western New York and knew the local
legends of ghosts(the</b>
<br><b>Rochester-Durand White Lady, for example); I never really put much
faith in</b>
<br><b>them.&nbsp; I never had an experience until I left new york.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In October of 99 I was transferred to Elyria,
Ohio.&nbsp; After a few weeks I</b>
<br><b>was asked to work in Sandusky.&nbsp; I accepted the promotion, but
having just</b>
<br><b>settled into a new apartment I decided to commute rather than move
again.</b>
<br><b>Halfway between Elyria and Sandusky there is a rest stop on I-90/Rt.2
just</b>
<br><b>outside Vermilion.&nbsp; I would stop sometimes on the way home
for a bathroom</b>
<br><b>break or rest a bit.&nbsp; It's a funny design, you drive around
and park in back</b>
<br><b>of the building between the building and wooded walking trails.&nbsp;
I usually</b>
<br><b>got off work after 11pm but it was usually pretty busy so I never
gave much</b>
<br><b>though to stopping there late at night.&nbsp; One night in march
of this year I</b>
<br><b>had stopped for a bathroom break.&nbsp; I noticed that there were
only a few cars</b>
<br><b>in the lot, it was a warm spring night, I wondered why more people
weren't</b>
<br><b>out.&nbsp; As I returned to my car I had this urge to walk into
the wooded area, a</b>
<br><b>stupid thing to do as it would be easy for a human assailant to
hide on the</b>
<br><b>trails.&nbsp; I walked in about ten feet and the path spilt to the
left and</b>
<br><b>straight ahead, I walked a little further straight ahead and felt
something</b>
<br><b>in there with me.&nbsp; I turned and started to walk out when I
heard a noise kind</b>
<br><b>of a lumbering sound.&nbsp; Feeling foolish and thinking there was
probably an</b>
<br><b>animal like a hedgehog or deer, walking through the woods, I looked
back and</b>
<br><b>saw a pair of yellow eyes on the path quite aways back.&nbsp; I
knew it could not</b>
<br><b>be an animal as only the parking area was lighted.&nbsp; The only
light in the</b>
<br><b>woods came from ambient light and the moon.&nbsp; I quickly closed
the distance</b>
<br><b>between myself and the parking area keys in hand.&nbsp; To my relief
nothing</b>
<br><b>pursued me and the eyes were gone or at least I couldn't see them
anymore.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>went straight home.&nbsp; The next day I felt rather silly, thinking
about the</b>
<br><b>matter during the day none of it seemed like it should have scared
me I</b>
<br><b>rationalized the whole thing.&nbsp; That night I stopped for a bathroom
break.</b>
<br><b>Feeling brave I decided once again to check out the woods and dispel
my fear</b>
<br><b>once and for all.&nbsp; This time I walked only halfway to the fork
and I felt an</b>
<br><b>overwhelming sense of dread building.&nbsp; I was not afraid in
the usual sense,</b>
<br><b>rapid heart beat, sweating, etc.&nbsp; I just had this feeling of
not being able</b>
<br><b>to walk any deeper into the woods.&nbsp; It was like the air got
heavier the</b>
<br><b>farther I walked.&nbsp; As I walked out of the woods the feeling
went away just as</b>
<br><b>it had come.&nbsp; I decided to come back on my day off and investigate,
during</b>
<br><b>the day.&nbsp; I had never been in the day and I didn't know where
the trails lead</b>
<br><b>or what was in the woods that attracted people to them.&nbsp; I
returned a few</b>
<br><b>days later with my jogging shoes, ready to explore.&nbsp; The trails
wrapped</b>
<br><b>around to each other and only totaled a 1 mile loop.&nbsp; There
was a ledge/cliff</b>
<br><b>area, but it was fenced off and there was no way to get down but
I could see</b>
<br><b>a stream in the distance.&nbsp; I didn't feel anything strange at
all.</b>
<br><b>Nonetheless I made it a point not to stop there after dark.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few months later I was transferred to New Castle,
Pa, which leads me to</b>
<br><b>my next story...but we are still looking into it and it's a.m. now
so I need</b>
<br><b>some sleep.</b>

<br><b>Haunting in Central Phoenix?</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<p><b>I don't usually share this with anyone since most people would consider
me crazy for believing in this stuff.&nbsp; My husband and father included.
When I was about 2 years old back in 1973 (I have very vivid memories about
my childhood and my mother confirms my memories) we rented an old house
about a 100 years old.&nbsp; It was there when Phoenix, AZ was not much
but a lot of farm land.&nbsp; There was&nbsp; a smaller house next to it
that used to be the old barn.&nbsp; It's still there today but surrounded
by huge mansions!&nbsp; Anyway, things were peaceful there until our next
door neighbor hung himself in the kitchen and my father found him.&nbsp;
I never knew about it.&nbsp; But about 3 months after things began to happen.&nbsp;
My mother was having an argument with my father one morning before getting
out of bed.&nbsp; She got real mad and got up and went to the kitchen.&nbsp;
She saw a man sitting at the table with his head in his hands on the table
so that she couldn't see his face.&nbsp; She turned around and went back
to bed not saying a word to my dad.&nbsp; Later I began to see a hand floating
in my room and would hear it "talk" to me.&nbsp; I called it (this is weird)
About Bugs but now I think it could have been Abbott Bugs or something
like that.&nbsp; As a child that young it was difficult to express myself
with words yet.&nbsp; I didn't have the word for ghost and would get spanked
by my father for crying at night when this thing would appear and talk
to me.&nbsp; One time I was sitting on the potty with my mom there to supervise.&nbsp;
I couldn't get off the toilet - like someone was holding me down.&nbsp;
My mother was pulling me by the arms to try to get me off but couldn't.&nbsp;
Finally it let go.&nbsp; Sometimes the door would slam shut and lock with
me on the other side and I couldn't get out - only the lock on the door
didn't work anymore.&nbsp; No matter how hard my mother would pull the
door would not open.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden it would as if nothing
had happened.&nbsp; At night you could hear scratching noises under the
wood floor in the master bedroom.&nbsp; Dad said it was just animals.&nbsp;
He crawled under the house but didn't find anything. He never believes
in this stuff. At night when I would go to bed (always fussed about not
wanting to go because I was scared) before falling asleep I felt like something
was trying to pull me through the wall!&nbsp; Sometimes I felt like I was
floating (like in another</b>
<br><b>dimension or something) and that hand ghost was there with me.&nbsp;
My mother finally had enough and made my Dad find a house to buy.&nbsp;
We moved and nothing quite as drastic as that ever happened to me again.&nbsp;
The new house had it's little incidents but</b>
<br><b>that's another story!&nbsp; My parent still live in the house they
bought 27 years ago!</b>

<br><b>He Came Back</b>
<p><b>By: melinda333@mail.icnet.net</b>
<p><b>My first husband committed suicide at the age of 29. Less than a
year</b>
<br><b>after he died, some strange things occurred over a period of a few</b>
<br><b>days.&nbsp; First, the thermostat had been turned all the way to
the right in</b>
<br><b>order to cut off the air conditioning. It was 102 degrees outside!
I did</b>
<br><b>not move the thermostat, and my daughter was too short. I asked
her</b>
<br><b>anyway, just to be sure, but she had not moved it. Later that night,
the</b>
<br><b>internal clock on my computer had been changed. The next day, upon</b>
<br><b>opening the refrigerator, I found the temperature to feel somewhat
low.</b>
<br><b>It had been turned down. It takes a screwdriver to turn the temperature</b>
<br><b>down on this unit. Sometime that afternoon, while my daughter was
alone</b>
<br><b>in her room playing, and I was hanging picture is my room, I heard
my</b>
<br><b>daughter talking in a way that sounded conversational, and not make</b>
<br><b>believe. I yelled down the hall,"Who are you talking to, honey?"&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>said that she was not talking to anyone.&nbsp; I heard her speak
again, this</b>
<br><b>time in more of a hushed tone. Concerned, I walked down the hall,
and</b>
<br><b>into her room. I asked her who she was talking to again. She said
no</b>
<br><b>one, that she had just been playing. I did not believe her, but
I could</b>
<br><b>not figure it out. The next day, when I was home for lunch, I felt
some</b>
<br><b>sort of "presence."&nbsp; I turned quickly to the right to see a
fading image</b>
<br><b>of light, almost in a static-like form. I felt like it was the spirit
of</b>
<br><b>my dead husband, and I asked him to please move on, that hanging
around</b>
<br><b>was just going to make it harder for our daughter and I to move
on</b>
<br><b>without him. I then left my house, skipped lunch, and returned to
work!</b>
<br><b>Once back at work, upon storing my purse in a closet, I turned around</b>
<br><b>and saw the same image again!&nbsp; About 20 minutes later, I was
standing</b>
<br><b>shoulder to shoulder with a co-worker, while reviewing paperwork.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly, I became very dizzy, lost my balance, and nearly fell.
I</b>
<br><b>gathered myself together quickly, embarrassed and what my co-worker
or</b>
<br><b>anyone else might say. I said nothing to anyone to explain what
had just</b>
<br><b>happened to me. However, the co-worker turned to me with her hand
on her</b>
<br><b>forehead, and said,"Oh my gosh! The weirdest thing just happened!
I</b>
<br><b>suddenly got really dizzy and nearly fell down! It's like I was
spun</b>
<br><b>around or something!!"&nbsp; I just looked at her and said,"Oh,
really?</b>
<br><b>That's strange. Are you okay?" I did not want to tell her that I
thought</b>
<br><b>my dead husband just passed between us! That night, while tucking
my</b>
<br><b>daughter in (she was 5 at the time), she asked me if I had been
watching</b>
<br><b>her sleep the night before. I told her that I had not, and she stated</b>
<br><b>that she was pretty sure that someone was watching her sleep. Concerned,</b>
<br><b>I asked her if it made her feel afraid. Her response was no, that
it was</b>
<br><b>okay, that it felt safe to her. Within the next couple of days,
my</b>
<br><b>daughter told me that the day I asked her who she had been talking
to in</b>
<br><b>her room, that it had been her Daddy, that he had come to see her.
I</b>
<br><b>asked her to tell me about it. She said that while she was playing
in</b>
<br><b>her room, a wolf came in, but that she was not afraid, because she
knew</b>
<br><b>that he was a friendly wolf. She said that the wolf then turned
into her</b>
<br><b>Daddy, and she described every article of clothing that he was wearing.</b>
<br><b>She said that he said that he came to see her because he did not
get to</b>
<br><b>tell her goodbye. She said that he knelt down, hugged her, and told
her</b>
<br><b>goodbye and she told him goodbye. All of these things told me that
my</b>
<br><b>dead husband's spirit was lingering among us living folks. What
do you</b>
<br><b>think??</b>

<br><b>Haunted Office Building</b>
<p><b>By: JayLee</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>This is not my story, but that of a friend.&nbsp; To give her a name
we shall</b>
<br><b>call her Rose.Rose works as a security guard in an office building
during the day.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>told me stories of how the building had housed labs for a nearby
University</b>
<br><b>and, even at one point, somewhere in the 30's or 40's, a morgue.&nbsp;
In the</b>
<br><b>labs they disected cadavers and performed experiments on animals
up until</b>
<br><b>the mid part of the 20th century.&nbsp; After that the building
was vacant for</b>
<br><b>several years, until it was converted into an office building about
20 years</b>
<br><b>ago.</b>
<br><b>Well on with the story...</b>
<br><b>One day when Rose was doing her routine walk of the stairwell (which
was</b>
<br><b>required of her), she got sidetracked and wondered right past the
first</b>
<br><b>floor and down into the basement.&nbsp; She opened the door expecting
to see the</b>
<br><b>first floor lobby and instead she saw black... the kind of black
that</b>
<br><b>instills terror.&nbsp; Suddenly she felt a gust of cold air rush
past her and</b>
<br><b>heard a voice say "Leave now!"&nbsp; Rose said she had never run
so quicky in her</b>
<br><b>life.&nbsp; Other people who work in the building express a fear
of the basement,</b>
<br><b>which is the boiler room and maintenance access to plumbing and
such.</b>
<br><b>Another time Rose had been standing in the hallway of the top floor
of the</b>
<br><b>office building and heard whispering coming from a closet.&nbsp;
She opened the</b>
<br><b>door to see nothing or no one.&nbsp; The closet was completely empty
except for a</b>
<br><b>broom and dustpan.She also told me of how the night shift housekeeping
personnel will not stay in the building alone.&nbsp; They said that they
would hear footsteps behind them</b>
<br><b>or see the elevators operate when no one is on them or even near
them.</b>
<br><b>Many people in the office building have heard a dark barking from
a first</b>
<br><b>floor storage room, but the only thing kept in that room is file
cabinets</b>
<br><b>and other unused furniture.&nbsp; Rose said that the room had been
one of the</b>
<br><b>labs. The most dramatic off all the stories Rose told me was about
the third floor</b>
<br><b>office.&nbsp; The third floor is mostly&nbsp; occupied by one company/department.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>largest office is at the end of the hallway to the left of the elevators.</b>
<br><b>People who work in the office have reported the weighted doors (the
kind</b>
<br><b>that have to be pushed to open and will close on their own) opening
by</b>
<br><b>themselves.&nbsp; Those doors are large and wooden with a glass
window in the</b>
<br><b>middle.&nbsp; No one is seen through the window when the doors open.&nbsp;
Also,</b>
<br><b>computers turn on and off without warning. Rose said that there
is also a</b>
<br><b>spot in the rear corner of the office that is always cold and the
feels very</b>
<br><b>damp, similar to how a cold, rainy day feels.&nbsp; But what makes
it so dramatic</b>
<br><b>is the fact that a ghost is actually seen.&nbsp; A blond haired
woman dressed in</b>
<br><b>1940's fashion walks through a wall (a walled off door), turns towards
the</b>
<br><b>front of the office, stumbles, and pitches face first through the
floor.</b>
<br><b>Rose said that there !</b>
<br><b>is a back staircase that runs from the first floor to the third
floor, but</b>
<br><b>that the staircase is walled off on the third floor in the area
where the</b>
<br><b>ghost disappears.&nbsp; Rumor has it that a woman had fallen to
her death down</b>
<br><b>the staircase and that is why it is no longer in use.</b>

<p><b>Haunting???</b>
<p><b>By: LilGreenGyco@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The summer after 4th grade, my parents and I had to move due to my
father's</b>
<br><b>business.&nbsp; We were from a rather large family, and the only
branch that moved</b>
<br><b>out of state.&nbsp; The 1st year went by without any occurrences.&nbsp;
The 2nd year we</b>
<br><b>were there, strange things started to happen.&nbsp; First of all,
if my Mom and I</b>
<br><b>were in the car together, or at home together, a strange perfume
smell</b>
<br><b>surrounded us.&nbsp; Kind of a fruity, flowery smell.&nbsp; My Mom
had told me it</b>
<br><b>smelled kinda familiar.&nbsp; It took a good 5 to 10 of these "smellings"
to</b>
<br><b>finally figure out where she knew this scent from.&nbsp; It smelled
just like the</b>
<br><b>perfume my great-grandmother wore.&nbsp; She died about a year before
I was born.</b>
<br><b>She had always told my Mom that she would look after her no matter
what.</b>
<br><b>When I was born, my Mom named me after her grandmother.&nbsp; She
was convinced</b>
<br><b>that this ghost had come to our new home to make sure we would be
all right.</b>
<br><b>Besides the perfume, we never had any "real" contact with her.&nbsp;
Doors opened</b>
<br><b>and closed on a regular basis.&nbsp; I also had an extensive stuffed
animal</b>
<br><b>collection.&nbsp; One day, before school, I had lined up the stuffed
animals</b>
<br><b>according to size.&nbsp; By the time I got home in the afternoon,
the toys were in</b>
<br><b>a disarray.&nbsp; We stayed there for 3 years, then moved back home
to our family.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Since then, we had never heard or smelled the ghost again.</b>

<br><b>When ever i would go down to my basement there, which was always</b>

seemed to</b>

down the hall</b>
<br><b>way once the second she stood under the lightbulb and stopped it
blew up.</b>
<br><b>She didn't get hurt luckily.&nbsp; That same type of thing happened

I was terrified</b>
<br><b>and didn't look.&nbsp; She must have been doing that for about 2

<br><b>Mysterious Ways-</b>
<p><b>By: Jbkioko1@cs.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; and my husband recently moved into an
apartment that I</b>
<br><b>fell very much in like with so to speak.&nbsp; French Quarter apartments
are about</b>
<br><b>36 years old.&nbsp; The apartment has a staircase and&nbsp; bedroom
is located on the</b>
<br><b>top floor. The first night that we moved in we heard the sound of
wings</b>
<br><b>flapping .&nbsp; Like a small bird within&nbsp; an inch or two of
our ears as we tried</b>
<br><b>to go to sleep. We did not see anything and it was a very short
encounter.</b>
<br><b>Then within a few days more, our stove came on by itself? there&nbsp;
are noises</b>
<br><b>around the whole apt. and so we decided to take afew pictures.&nbsp;
I am catholic</b>
<br><b>my husband buddist.&nbsp; Well our photo of Jesus had an apparition
like effect to</b>
<br><b>it, I believe that it is either an angel or Mary herself.&nbsp;
The pictures at</b>
<br><b>the courtyard at my church have images of a pope or bishop and a
man appears</b>
<br><b>in the photo who was not there. I know that God can work in mysterious

<p><b>Lady and Her Dog</b>
<p><b>By: deblou@gvtel.com</b>
<p><b>My house is haunted by the ghost of an 83 year old woman and her
dog.&nbsp; About 90 years ago there was a different house on this foundation
and it burnt down, but the old woman didn't get out.The old woman had a
terrier that she loved almost more than life.&nbsp; When the fire started
the dog got scared and hid in the basment, the old woman went down after
it because it was the only family she had.&nbsp; She hunted for it for
about five minutes</b>
<br><b>and by that time the smoke had grown so thick she couldn't find
her way out of the basment, was over taken by smoke, and a few minutes
later burnt to death.</b>
<br><b>She is still in my basment searching for her dog because I can hear
her every night around 10:30 pm, the time the fire started, clanging abound
on the pipes.&nbsp; I have even seen her on two occasions.&nbsp; The first
time was when I woke up in the middle of the night a few years ago, I heard
noises in the basment so I went to go chaeck it out, and I saw her in the
south west corner calling her dogs name then she looked at me and disappered.&nbsp;
The second time I saw her in my room because from what I have found out
my room is almost exactly where hers was.&nbsp; She came and stood by my
bed with a contented smile on her face the just disappered again.</b>
<br><b>I can still hear her sounds in the basement and often hear a dog
barking when my dog is silent right next to me.</b>

<br><b>Athens Ohio</b>
<p><b>By: Tracy_Conger@nyc.cohnwolfe.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Moonville (Athens, Ohio) -&nbsp; Moonville in located in Southeastern
Ohio, not</b>
<br><b>SW.&nbsp; It was actually a mining town, way back when.&nbsp; Though
the story you</b>
<br><b>had, may be true, I have another.&nbsp; Probably another variation.&nbsp;
I have been</b>
<br><b>there about twenty times.&nbsp; It is tough to find, as it is located
in the</b>
<br><b>Zeliski (I believe I have it spelled correctly) State Park.&nbsp;
It is a</b>
<br><b>national park ? complete forest - and not only do you have to watch
out for</b>
<br><b>the locals, but armed park rangers are also a tough deterrent.&nbsp;
The story</b>
<br><b>that I was always told was that the town of Moonville was infected
with</b>
<br><b>Cholera (I believe that was the disease).&nbsp; Most of the townspeople
were</b>
<br><b>dying, and they sent a local man to flag down a passing train, to
notify a</b>
<br><b>neighboring town, so they could get help.&nbsp; Legend has it that
he was struck</b>
<br><b>by the train and killed. His ghost still haunts the tunnel; supposedly
you</b>
<br><b>can see his ghost swinging a lantern trying to flag down the train.&nbsp;
I have</b>
<br><b>been there many times, and although I have never seen the specter,
I have</b>
<br><b>had the shit scared out of me.&nbsp; It is something right out of
the Blair</b>
<br><b>Witch Project.&nbsp; In fact, when I saw the movie, memories of
MV came rushing</b>
<br><b>back, and scared me ten times more than the film did.&nbsp; Not
to get into</b>
<br><b>great detail, but we had been sitting in the middle of the railway
tunnel,</b>
<br><b>which is about the length of a football field.&nbsp; It is huge..&nbsp;
The tracks</b>
<br><b>are gone, but the rocks and a few stakes still remain.&nbsp; We
had set up a</b>
<br><b>campfire and three of us were sitting there talking.&nbsp; It was
about 3 in the</b>
<br><b>morning, and due to being inside the tunnel, moonlight was scarce.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>only light came from the campfire.&nbsp; At one point, one of my
friends began</b>
<br><b>telling the "legend" to another.&nbsp; When he finished the tale,
he remarked</b>
<br><b>that he had been there many times, but had never seen a ghost.&nbsp;
At that</b>
<br><b>moment the wind picked up inside the tunnel, and blew the fire completely</b>
<br><b>out.&nbsp; If you have ever been camping, you may know how stubborn
some fires</b>
<br><b>are to extinguish.&nbsp; That is what I think about now when I recall
that the</b>
<br><b>entire thing went out like a match.&nbsp; We all jumped up, and
ran through the</b>
<br><b>complete darkness of the tunnel, for about two miles to where the
car was</b>
<br><b>parked.&nbsp; And were pretty much silent all the way home.&nbsp;
We returned the</b>
<br><b>next day to get our gear.&nbsp; And that was the last time that
I ever went to</b>
<br><b>Moonville at night.</b>
<br><b>Just a side note.&nbsp; There are acutally two tunnels.&nbsp; I
have a map to the</b>
<br><b>second, but have never been there myself.&nbsp; I also have pictures
of the</b>
<br><b>tunnel and surrounding area.</b>

<br><b>My Cat</b>
<p><b>By: FireRam131@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I recently came across your webpage and have read several of the
stories so fa</b>
<br><b>r. This has prompted me to submit my own. I had a cat that I loved
very much n</b>
<br><b>amed Charles. He was a black cat that was very large. People who
visited would</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;ask if he was part Maine Coon. We had had him for several
years when he becam</b>
<br><b>e seriously sick. After several hundred dollars in vet bills I finally
decided</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;the humane thing to do was to put him to sleep and let him
go with some digni</b>
<br><b>ty. Not long after that I was sitting in the kitchen after coming
home from wo</b>
<br><b>rking the nite shift I worked for the local newpaper. As I was eating
my break</b>
<br><b>fast out of the corner of my eye I clearly saw him walking past
me to the corn</b>
<br><b>er where we had put his food bowls. Of&nbsp; course when I looked
he wasnt there.</b>
<br><b>The second time I saw him I was downstairs in the tv room. For some
strange</b>
<br><b>reason I had the sudden urge to look behind me. By turning around
you can clea</b>
<br><b>rly see the hallway and the doorway to where youd enter the utility
room. Ther</b>
<br><b>es no way someone could not be seen going into that room. On the
left were the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;stairs. I clearly saw my dead cat&lt; his ghost> leap from
what would of been</b>
<br><b>the second stair from the bottom considering the angle to which
he jumped. He</b>
<br><b>then ran under my moms sewing machine just to the right but behind
the wall...</b>
<br><b>........I never took my eyes off the doorway. I never saw my cat
run from out</b>
<br><b>from under the sewing machine. If he had the only place he could
of gone was</b>
<br><b>the utility room. I even closed the door looking. IF he was in there
he</b>
<br><b>wouldndt of been able to get out. That the only two times I remember
seeing</b>
<br><b>him. I think he was just coming back to say he was ok :)</b>

<br><b>Houston Haunting</b>
<p><b>By: Unknown</b>
<p><b>The location is by Fulshear, TX. Very close to Hunt Rd (About 15-20
min. outside of houston. Here is what happened. Me and my friend were going
out to see the japanees commet around 1998 (the one that was close enough
to see with a naked eye) and</b>
<br><b>decided to get out of the city light to see the commet better. We
live on the west side of houston so decided to go to the west (tward fulshear).
We drove looking for nothing but a safe place that is sucluded from cops
harrasing us. We drove down the streets and last remember driving down
hunt rd. before we ended up at a dead end. We got out a looked at the commet.
There were fields on all sides but the ways which the road ran with cows
grazing. As we stood there, i would guess about 10 min. we heard chatering
in front of us. The noise seemed very close, probably feet, and sounded
for about 20 sec. then would</b>
<br><b>stop. After the first time we heard the sound I asked&nbsp; my friend
if it sounded like children in a play ground and he said he was not sure.
Then a min. later the sound accured again but from the rear right and was
equally close. At this point we were freaked by the sound because it did
sond like children in a play ground. If you can imagine standing in a play
ground somewhere off in the distance and listen to dozens of children play
but cannot distinguis a single conversation because they overlap and cut
in on each other, that is what it sounded like. Then after 20 or so seconds
the sound would stop then a minute later start from the left rear. This
continued for about 3 or 4 cycles then stoped for good. At this point i
was standing by the car door trying to get my friend to leave and as he
began to walk toward the car i heard someone say help three times. I turned
to look in the direction of the voice and there was a house with the lights
on. It was about 1 am and</b>
<br><b>this really scared me because I didn't know if the voice was someone,
like a convict from the prison down the way, hurting someone. We left and
sine then i have looked for this place about 30 times but have never got
to the dead end again. The roads have been changed or i am not remembering
the way we got there. However, I do know it is of 1489 and hunt rd. (south
of brookshire). I have thought about the sounds i heard and have talked
to people about it and many people say that maybe there were animals, like
coons, making noises. However, the field (by fields i mean low lying grass
due to the cows in</b>
<br><b>eating) was visable from the moonlight to a point and if there were
animals in the field it wound have had to be enough to sound like a playground
full of children. And there clearly was not. Another thing is that there
are forests beyond the fields but it was about 200-300 yards and could
not have sounded that close as it would have been an echo sound and more
faint.</b>

<br><b>India lady speaks Finnish!</b>
<p><b>By: Jesse@hotmail.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>India is a wild place with a long history of spiritualism. I have
a few experiences which stick out in my mind - all true stories. I was
taken to a remote village with a group of young people. We were all part
of a missionary team. After talking with the people through translators,
singing some song we had learn in Hindi, and telling them about Jesus,
many of the people came up to us and said they saw evil spirits and ask
if we could pray for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man brought up his
wife, he was crying and through a translator he told us that his wife was
possessed by an evil spirit and as a result she could no longer speak.
I was 18 years old at the time and was a little intimidated. I was with
a</b>
<br><b>man who was from Finland and we began to pray for the lady. After
praying for a few minutes nothing was happening, but I could feel a power
struggle. My friend spoke to this lady in his native Finnish language.
I saw her eyes change and this evil look came on her face. This primitive
lady who had never seen white people before, knew no English, began speaking
to my friend in Finnish. My friend told me that he&nbsp; commanded the
spirit in Jesus name to tell him where the gateway was. The spirit spoke
through this lady in a completely different language and harsh voice. He
said that the gateway was under a plate which the lady had put on her forehead
to honor a idol god. He could not believe that the lady spoke to him in
Finnish, (which is one of the most difficult languages to learn.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We put our hands on the lady's forehead and her whole body started shaking.
We said in Jesus name come out and go to the place prepared for you. The
lady began coughing and coughing. She then turned to her husband and began
to speak with him in her native tongue, they both were crying with joy.
It was the first time they spoken together in over two years. Two other
people that night were prayed over in the name of Jesus by our friends
and had similar results. The people thanked God that they had been delivered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another time while living in India a Chinese friend and I learned that
our neighbor and hung himself. That night we were awoken by a series of
clear screams in our room. In one instant a scream was heard in all the
corners of our room and then I felt like a person was one inch from my
face and screamed. This happened about 1 am and my friend and I both were
woken from a deep sleep, we were so shaken up that we could not even talk
to one another for several minutes. The next day some friends down the
street also reported hearing a scream which ran down their street. This
happened every night for about a week. The scream would be clear and the
most evil thing I have heard. Finally we prayed to God for protection and
told the scream in Jesus name that it could not come back into out room.
It never came back to our room, but we heard it run down the street. After
praying down the street and near bye streets it never was heard again.
All this to say that spirits are real and can be controlled by the power
of Jesus name. If you ever experience ghosts or sprits command them to
leave in Jesus name and ask God to protect you.</b>

<br><b>Lake Placid, St. Moritz Hotel, July 2000</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: trinity20011@canoemail.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>We're just back from vacation, having spent 2 days at a very old
and</b>
<br><b>wonderful hotel called the St. Moritz in Lake Placid, New York.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>stayed in a room on the third floor--a fairly pleasant room with</b>
<br><b>separate bath, but as you can well imagine, old plumbing/fixtures</b>
<br><b>throughout.&nbsp;&nbsp; A picture of the hotel in its hey day in
the late</b>
<br><b>1890's can be seen in the lobby to the hotel.</b>
<br><b>Day/night one was non-eventful.&nbsp; Our second (and last night)
there, I</b>
<br><b>arose to use the facilities about 2:00 am and entered the washroom</b>
<br><b>(with lights out).&nbsp; All was quiet until I heard what seemed
to be an</b>
<br><b>unearthly woman's moans above my head.&nbsp; It took me about 30
seconds</b>
<br><b>for me to realize these moans were not coming from the room upstairs,</b>
<br><b>nor a local radio or tv ....needless to say, I raced out of there
and</b>
<br><b>jumped in bed, my heart pounding.&nbsp; My boyfriend, still asleep,</b>
<br><b>greeted me with a grunt.&nbsp; I finally fell asleep totally curled
up</b>
<br><b>against him...until he got up about 3:30 am/4:00 am to use the</b>
<br><b>lavatory too.&nbsp; I stayed wearily awake waiting for him to return...and</b>
<br><b>saw that he looked a bit perturbed as he closed the door to the</b>
<br><b>lavatory a few moments later...(he never closes the door!).&nbsp;&nbsp;
While</b>
<br><b>he acknowledged my experience as valid when I recounted it to him</b>
<br><b>then, he said nothing more.&nbsp;&nbsp; We both went back to sleep.</b>
<br><b>Next morning, I mentioned the moans again to my boyfriend.&nbsp;
He then</b>
<br><b>said he needed to tell me something too.&nbsp; Don't ask me why
but I</b>
<br><b>stopped him midsentence and asked him to wait until we gathered
our</b>
<br><b>belongings to check out. While checking out, we asked the innkeeper</b>
<br><b>about the history of the hotel.&nbsp; She said she knew nothing
and was</b>
<br><b>always too busy to notice anything out of place. We left the</b>
<br><b>conversation at that.</b>
<br><b>In the car on the way out of town, my boyfriend recounted that while</b>
<br><b>sitting in the lavatory that night, (lights on), he noticed an</b>
<br><b>irregular (sphere-shaped but no definable edges, about 18 in</b>
<br><b>diameter) hovering, shifting mist about 18-24 inches in front of
his</b>
<br><b>face, just below eye level.&nbsp; At first he thought it was his
breathe</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;from the cold mountain air.&nbsp; Very logically, he checked
this by</b>
<br><b>exhaling numerous times away from the mist...and found he exhaled</b>
<br><b>nothing.&nbsp; He moved his hand through the mist.....it remained.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>hair on his arms started to raise, goosebumps forming.&nbsp; Feeling</b>
<br><b>somewhat wary now, Steve left the lavatory quietly.....he must walk</b>
<br><b>through the mist to exit. He quietly closed the lavatory door and</b>
<br><b>turned off the light.</b>
<br><b>While we did enjoy our stay at this hotel, the room was clean, the</b>
<br><b>innkeepers were very friendly and hospitable, etc., we are curious
if</b>
<br><b>you had any other reports about unusual activity at this hotel or
in</b>
<br><b>the vicinity thereof.&nbsp; I should mention this hotel is next
to a</b>
<br><b>funeral home.</b>

<br><b>Historical Home Ghost</b>
<p><b>By:[cgrines@carolina.rr.com</b>
<p><b>hi i am writing to tell you of my experience. this happened in early
fall of 1993 in a town in Indiana(Lebanon), I was young 13yrs old at the
time. I remember going to this historical house which had been on to the
public for an open house. This house was over 100 years old. My parents
and I went into the house and were walking around. I decided to walk in
the living room which was to the right as you walk in. their were id say
aprox. 10 people in the house. As I was in the living room I happened to
look to the right of me and saw a boy who looked about my age at the time
sitting in a chair he stuck out to me&nbsp; than the other people their
that were in the house, he was wearing blue suspenders and an oldfashioned
hat like you men wearing from the 1920's. He was sitting by himself with
no expression on his face.I didnt think much of it until I went to find
my parents they were in the room right as you walkin to the place. I then
asked them to take a look at the living room which was very nice well preserved
room. As I walked into the living room the boy was gone. I began checking
the bottom floor&nbsp;&nbsp; their was no sign of him, I made my way to
the upstairs checked around and saw no one. I was thinking to myself theres
no way that the boy could have left. the back door was shut solid the only
way out was the front door. I told my parents about</b>
<br><b>the encounter soon after. Till this day I believe I encounter a
spirit of a young boy from the early 1900's. If you have&nbsp; any questions

<br><b>My Apartment</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: DMomofryan@aol.com</b>
<p><b>I have always been fascinated by the supernatural and always believed
in ghosts.&nbsp; I've "spoken" with my dad several times since his death
4 years ago.&nbsp; About 18 months ago, my son (18 months old) and I moved
into the one bedroom apartment we still live in..&nbsp; After being there
for a month or so, I started having the same horrible dream every night.&nbsp;
I dreamed that I was holding my son and a "force" kept pulling him out
of my arms and taking him away from me screaming.&nbsp; At first, I thought
it was just the paranoid dream of a single mom, but then I started hearing
the words "CLOSE THE VORTEX" as my son was being ripped away.&nbsp; After
about 10 days, I finally got the hint and sprinkled holy water all through
my room while praying for this "vortex" to be closed.&nbsp; I have not
had that dream since.&nbsp; Then in March of this year (2000), I started
getting the feeling that we were not alone in the apartment.&nbsp; Lying
on my side in my bed, I can see to the end of the hallway, which has the
livin!</b>
<br><b>g room on one side and the dining room on the other.&nbsp; I kept
seeing a shadow walking from one room to the other.&nbsp; I woke up one
time to find a figure hanging on the ceiling fan above my bed looking down
at me.&nbsp; One night, I felt a soft touch on the side of my face and
I told it to get away from me.&nbsp; I put holy water on the four corners
of my bed, my son's bed and the door to my room.&nbsp; The longer this
went on, the more I started to feel afraid.&nbsp; Not threatened, but I
felt like whatever was in the apartment was trying to tell me something
and was getting frustrated that I was not doing anything about it. I started
leaving all the lights on when I went to bed and was getting maybe 3 hours
of sleep a night.&nbsp; Praying did not seem to be helping.&nbsp;&nbsp;
After finally telling my sister, I put holy water in every doorway and
every entrance to my apartment.&nbsp; While doing this, I asked God to
please take the soul back to heaven so I wouldn't be afraid anymore. The
very next night, I heard the words "thank you" and I have not felt that
spirit again.&nbsp; Then, about 3 weeks ago, I started feeling that spooked
feeling again.&nbsp; I went to bed one night and in that phase right before
deep sleep, I opened my eyes and saw two figures, one at the&nbsp; foot
of my son's bed&nbsp; and one beside my bed.&nbsp; I blinked and saw that
there were two Indians in my room.&nbsp; Sounds weird, I know! The one
at the foot of the bed just stood there with his arms crossed and his back
to my son.&nbsp; The other one started talking to me.&nbsp; He said that
they were there to protect me and my son and to not be afraid.&nbsp; They
would look out for both of us.&nbsp; I lay down and went to sleep.&nbsp;
I have woken up several times during the nights since then and I always
see the Indian at the foot of my son's bed, always with his back to him
and his arms crossed, like he is watching over him.&nbsp; I can only see
him from the waist up and he is not 3 dimensional, more like colored smoke.&nbsp;
I know this sounds really wild, especially since I still live in the apartment,
but I feel totally safe now and I know that my son is being protected.&nbsp;
One more interesting fact, I live in Texas and recently found out that
my apartment complex stands on land that used to be part of the Chisolm
Trail.</b>

<br><b>heading home from a late night party.&nbsp; As they were heading
home, just a few</b>
<br><b>minutes left to reach the house, his friend, Joe, had forgotten
his house</b>
<br><b>keys.&nbsp; He was scared because he had lost them.&nbsp; My brother
then told me that Joe</b>
<br><b>received the keys in his hand.&nbsp; Something or someone had handed
Joe his keys, it was</b>
<br><b>not my brother.&nbsp; The last short story is what happened to my
great grandfather.</b>
<br><b>My great grandfather was riding his horse back home from working
at his ranch.</b>
<br><b>This was in Mexico.&nbsp; He saw a small boy crying and sitting
on the ground.&nbsp; He told</b>
<br><b>the little kid what was wrong and if he needed a ride.&nbsp; The
kid just pointed to a</b>
<br><b>direction.</b>
<br><b>My great grandfather just lifted the boy like nothing, like if the
kid did</b>
<br><b>not way anything.&nbsp; He was confused.&nbsp; But he rode off and
talked to the boy, which</b>
<br><b>said nothing.&nbsp; Well, as they rode along the dirt road, my great
grandfather turned</b>
<br><b>back to ask the kid a question, the kid was not there anymore.&nbsp;
So he kept on riding</b>
<br><b>down the road.&nbsp; After a few minutes, my great grandfather felt
someone tapping him</b>
<br><b>on his shoulder.&nbsp; He turns around to notice the small kid.&nbsp;
The kid replies to him</b>
<br><b>in Spanish, "Mira mis dientitos!"&nbsp; The translation goes like
this, "Look at my baby</b>
<br><b>teeth!"&nbsp; My great grandfather told his son and he told my father
the story.&nbsp; I was told</b>
<br><b>that the little kid smelled like sulfur and his teeth were pointy
or thinly large.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>great grandfather dropped the kid and took off like a jockey on
a horse.&nbsp; I hope</b>
<br><b>that you have enjoyed these small stories.&nbsp; I have not experienced
anything like this,</b>
<br><b>but I have had sleep paralysis in where I saw my aunt from Mexico,
who is not dead,</b>
<br><b>as a transparent figure walking in my house in the states.&nbsp;
Then I had to force</b>
<br><b>myself to wake up because I felt that I was being held down or kept
from waking up.</b>

<br><b>Has Anyone Seen This?</b>
<p><b>By: rikkiweinstein@hotmail.com</b>
<p><b>This experience doesn't seem like much compared to the ones I have
read at</b>
<br><b>this site.&nbsp; That may be because I didn't experience it first
hand or maybe</b>
<br><b>because I am still a little skeptical.&nbsp; My stepdad is a real
night owl.&nbsp; One</b>
<br><b>night he was sitting up reading one of his sci-fi books when he
just</b>
<br><b>happened to look at the bedroom window.&nbsp; There he saw an old
man staring in</b>
<br><b>at him (they had a groud level floor) with curiosity, and no real
expression</b>
<br><b>on his face.&nbsp; He was powder white.&nbsp; My stepdad stared
in shock and blinked</b>
<br><b>and the man was gone.&nbsp; Exactly as he realized the man was gone,
the man was</b>
<br><b>at his bedroom door, Peering in at him. The man then turned and
walked</b>
<br><b>across the hall into my 3-year-old sister's room and my stepdad
could not</b>
<br><b>see from where he was.&nbsp; He was too petrified to move.&nbsp;
My sister then came</b>
<br><b>out of her room crying and asking if she could sleep with them because
she</b>
<br><b>was scared!&nbsp; She didn't mention a ghost though. The next morning
my sister</b>
<br><b>told me of a dream she had of an old man, glowing white with glowing
red</b>
<br><b>eyes walking throught the backyard carrying paint cans in each hand.&nbsp;
This</b>
<br><b>is an innocent 3-year-old probably not even knowing what a ghost
was telling</b>
<br><b>me of this "dream."&nbsp; Over the years I thought my stepdad was
kidding about</b>
<br><b>this occurance but he swears to it to this very day.&nbsp; My sister
doesn't</b>
<br><b>remember anything.&nbsp; It seems to make sense that it was an old
person.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>lived 2 houses down from an alzheimers nursing home!</b>
<br><b>I think it was just a ghost of someone who died at the nursing home
passing</b>
<br><b>through.&nbsp; The patients escaped all of the time to "go home"
and always</b>
<br><b>thought we were one of their past family members.&nbsp; Maybe this
'ghost' was</b>
<br><b>checking to see if he recognized us!</b>
<br><b>Will you post this on your site?&nbsp; I wanted to see if any one
has ever seem</b>
<br><b>anything like that before.&nbsp; It always seems like the ghosts
in teh stories</b>
<br><b>here are always mean and distructive.</b>

<br><b>My Ghost Story</b>
<p><b>By: SISU2005@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I was divorced and moved to this area where my parents and I grew
up. I met a</b>
<br><b>man I really began caring alot of and we grew into a more serious</b>
<br><b>relationship.</b>
<br><b>We were living together for a time and during that time, my mother
died of</b>
<br><b>natural causes but, it was still a hard time without her. We all
loved her</b>
<br><b>very much and she had very strong religious beliefs and passed them
on to us.</b>
<br><b>She didnt think I should live with this man but, I did anyway.</b>
<br><b>After she died, my father decided to sell their home and move to
his family</b>
<br><b>home a few miles away. I wanted to buy the home but, he felt I shouldnt
while</b>
<br><b>living with this man. Well, my brother and sister talked him into
it as I had</b>
<br><b>children to raise and they would have so much more room. I told
my father, we</b>
<br><b>were planning to get married.</b>
<br><b>We moved into the house and each day or night, the lights would
flicker or go</b>
<br><b>out in different rooms. It was an eerie feeling and we had them
checked out.</b>
<br><b>There was nothing wrong with the electrical parts but, it continued
to</b>
<br><b>happened. Well, I felt maybe my mother was trying to tell me something
which</b>
<br><b>I kept to myself.</b>
<br><b>We got married at my parents house which we bought, the lights have
never</b>
<br><b>flickered or gone out since. I feel my mother was here and then
she rested in</b>
<br><b>peace once we were married.</b>
<br><b>My husband now and I have talked about it since and both feel that
she was</b>
<br><b>giving us vibes to not live like we were and get married. We still
feel her</b>
<br><b>presence in this house but, she was a wonderful person and we are
never</b>
<br><b>afraid.</b>

<p><b>Lala</b>
<p><b>By: Corax31@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Hello....I was reading through your vast volume of ghostly tales
and thought</b>
<br><b>your website would be the perfect place to finally tell my own.
Btw, I don't</b>
<br><b>mind if you use my name attached to the story, but I would prefer
you not use</b>
<br><b>my email address.....nothing personal, I just have this thing about
pasting</b>
<br><b>my email addy on the web. On with the story..... :)</b>
<br><b>I don't remember the first time I noticed the ghost in my home,
but my mother</b>
<br><b>swears she came with the house (we moved in when I was 2 1/2 years
old). But</b>
<br><b>throughout my childhood I always remember her being there with me.....like
an</b>
<br><b>"imaginary friend" who wasn't part of my imagination at all. My
mother called</b>
<br><b>her Amelia, after she heard the ghost say this name and gesture
to herself.</b>
<br><b>But I called her Lala because she was (and is) always singing. She
seemed</b>
<br><b>most attached to myself and my mother, despite the fact that the
other four</b>
<br><b>people in the house had seen or heard her at one point or another.
She has</b>
<br><b>even followed me off to college, and moving across country.</b>
<br><b>One of her favourite forms of getting our attention was dancing
and singing</b>
<br><b>in my bedroom....we could audibly hear her beautiful soprano voice
(think</b>
<br><b>Mozart's Night Queen aria), her high heeled shoes clacking on the
floor, and</b>
<br><b>her beads rattling (she was always dressed as an upper-class 1920s</b>
<br><b>flapper-girl, complete with a cigarette dangling out of a silver
cig holder,</b>
<br><b>and seemed to be in her late teens). Her other favourite thing to
do was go</b>
<br><b>about the house moving chairs, turning on lights, and cranking the
volume up</b>
<br><b>on the stereo.</b>
<br><b>Lala is precocious, a bit of a wild-child, but has never meant anyone
any</b>
<br><b>harm. More often than not, she's very helpful to us. See, things
are always</b>
<br><b>going missing mysteriously in this house....I'll put my coffee mug
down on</b>
<br><b>the desk, go out of the room to do a chore, then come back and the
mug is</b>
<br><b>gone....things of that nature. Whenever this happens, we ask Lala
to help us</b>
<br><b>find the missing item, and she does. It usually has the same pattern
to it: a</b>
<br><b>few minutes later, I'll hear Lala call my name, turn to face her,
and the mug</b>
<br><b>will be resting placidly somewhere else in the room (where I know
I would not</b>
<br><b>have put it).</b>
<br><b>She also helps to take care of me when my migraine headaches become</b>
<br><b>unbearable, or when I'm sick....just as she used to do whenever
I was sick or</b>
<br><b>had a nightmare when I was a child. She's been with me for 25 years
so</b>
<br><b>far....and though I've told her that she shouldn't feel like she
has to stay</b>
<br><b>with me if she'd rather move on, she continues to remain. I don't
know who</b>
<br><b>she was, since the house was built long after the 1920s (though
we do have a</b>
<br><b>lot of antique furniture and jewelry with which she might have come
into the</b>
<br><b>house, and then decided she liked the inhabitants better ??) and
she doesn't</b>
<br><b>fit the description of any of my ancestors. I only know that it's
a true</b>
<br><b>comfort having my own personal "guardian angel" with me...</b>

<br><b>My First Haunting</b>
<p><b>By: Buddywell@aol.com</b>
<p><b>I WAS ONLY 5 YEARS OLD WHEN I EXPERIENCED MY FIRST HAUNTING. IT WAS
IN MY GRANDPARENTS HOME WHERE I SPENT MANY WEEKENDS ENTERTAINING. I WENT
TO THE UPSTAIRS PORTION OF THE HOME,WHICH WAS THEN ONLY CONSIDERED AN ATTIC
FOR STORAGE. MY OLDER SISTER AND COUSIN WERE CLEANING SO THAT IT COULD
BE REMODELED TO A SEWING ROOM. THIS AREA IS VERY SMALL. ONLY ONE LAMP WAS

MOMENTS WHEN SOMEONE OR SOMETHING SLAPPED MY LEFT CHEEK VERY HARD. I WENT
CRYING DOWNSTAIRS TO MY GRANDMOTHER. I EXPLAINED TO HER WHAT HAPPENED.
SHE SAW THE HANDPRINT ON MY FACE. SHE WENT UPSTAIRS ANGRY AT MY SISTER
AND COUSIN. SHE THOUGHT THEY HAD DONE THIS TO ME. I TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO
HER AGAIN WHAT HAPPENED. SHE DID NOT BELIEVE ME. I STILL TO THIS DAY DO
NOT KNOW WHAT OR WHO WAS THERE THAT NIGHT.</b>
<br><b>LATER IN MY LIFE, I ASKED MY GRANDPARENTS ABOUT THE HOME AND WHO
HAD BEEN THERE PREVIOUSLY. THEY WERE NOT SURE HOW OLD THE HOME WAS EXACTLY,
BUT ESTIMATED ABOUT 160 YEARS OLD. MY GRANDPARENTS NAMED MANY PEOPLE WHO
HAD LIVED THERE. WHO KNOWS WHAT UNFINISHED BUSINESS THEY MAY STILL HAVE.

<br><b>My Story of Aunty Susie</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: LiLiG99@hotmail.com.</b>
<p><b>Hello.. I am 22 years old and have had a profound experience. Say
its a</b>
<br><b>preminiton or just having that "sense" I would like to share this
story with</b>
<br><b>others so maybe someone could relate to me and give me some feedback.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I was about 14 years old.&nbsp; My mothers Aunt Susie raised
her from when she</b>
<br><b>was an infant along with my grandfather.&nbsp; My Aunt never got
married and took</b>
<br><b>on the responsiblity of having my mother.&nbsp; She was truly a
mother compared to</b>
<br><b>my mothers real mother.&nbsp; Anyways, Throughout maybe 4 or 5 years
my</b>
<br><b>grandparents started passing away starting in 1986 with my nana.
The next</b>
<br><b>death was 1988 who was my grandfather (moms dad), and the next to
be&nbsp; was my</b>
<br><b>Aunt Susie.&nbsp; My fathers father would survive six months after
her death.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Since I was a child I always had strong preminitions and
had even been seen</b>
<br><b>in my sleep talking to something outside my window on a hot summers
night</b>
<br><b>which i remember vividly until this day.&nbsp; My first grandmother
died in 1986 i</b>
<br><b>believe i was 8 or 9 at the time.&nbsp; My parents felt that I was
too young to</b>
<br><b>attend her funeral so I remained at home.&nbsp; A few years later
I had a dream</b>
<br><b>about my nana, coming to me and looking so beautiful wearing a green
dress</b>
<br><b>that I had no knowledge of what so ever.&nbsp; She didnt tell me
but I knew this</b>
<br><b>was the dress she had been buried in.&nbsp; I told my mother what
I had dreamnt of</b>
<br><b>an proceeded to tell her what my grandmother had on when she was
buried.</b>
<br><b>Needless to say my mother almost dropped cause she knew I was so
young I</b>
<br><b>hadnt a clue what went on at the funeral. I was right.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; When i was about 14 years old, My Aunt Susie was still alive
and living in</b>
<br><b>an elderly home in Providence, Rhode Island.&nbsp; She moved out
of the family</b>
<br><b>house shortly after my grandfather passed away in 1988 cause she
was so</b>
<br><b>extremly stricken with grief.&nbsp; My mom and aunt would talk everyday
and I</b>
<br><b>rember this so clearly.&nbsp; It was a friday night and my mom was
trying to call</b>
<br><b>my aunt.&nbsp; Often she would take her hearing aid out and go to
bed.&nbsp; My mom was</b>
<br><b>going to New York the next day with my father and she told me to
get in touch</b>
<br><b>with my aunt the next day and let her know she would be back late
Saturday</b>
<br><b>night and she would call her on Sunday morning.&nbsp; My parents
left at 4 am and</b>
<br><b>I was still sleeping. At around 4:45 am I woke up out of a dead
sleep and</b>
<br><b>shot straight up like as if someone had pinched me. The room was
dark but i</b>
<br><b>felt a very strange uneasy feeling that I was scared.&nbsp; My brother
was</b>
<br><b>sleeping in the other room and I proceeded to get up out of bed
and go</b>
<br><b>downstairs.&nbsp; I for some reason immediatly went to the kitchen
sink, opened</b>
<br><b>the cupboard underneath and grabbed cleaning products out and started
to</b>
<br><b>clean.&nbsp; I have no idea why i did this but I cleaned for a good
two hours.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was up all day long, my brother went out and i was home alone.&nbsp;
I tried to</b>
<br><b>call my aunt numerous times but no answer.&nbsp; I passed it off
as she may have</b>
<br><b>went out shopping on the bus that day. I still however felt very
uneasy all</b>
<br><b>day long.&nbsp; That night my mother came home and asked me if i
spoke to my aunt.</b>
<br><b>I told her i couldnt get in touch with her. She said alright and
said she</b>
<br><b>would call her in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; I awoke around 9 am on
Sunday morning.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>mom was in the other room and i overheard her saying I am going
up to my</b>
<br><b>aunts cause she is still not answering the phone. I ran out of bed
and up to</b>
<br><b>my mother and insisted that i go with her. She kind of got mad at
me and</b>
<br><b>wanted me to stay behind but i insisted that I go with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The ride up to</b>
<br><b>her house i was getting such strange vibes that when we got there
something</b>
<br><b>wasnt going to be right.&nbsp; WE went into her building and went
to the fifth</b>
<br><b>floor and stepped out. Her apartment was at the end of the hallway.
When we</b>
<br><b>reached the end we saw there were two newspapers lying in front
of her door.</b>
<br><b>One being that of Saturday night and the next being of Sunday morning.
My</b>
<br><b>mother turned to me with such a cold feeling of sadness.&nbsp; She
turned the key</b>
<br><b>into the door and looked to the right. My aunt was lying dead on
the kitchen</b>
<br><b>floor.&nbsp; My mom paniked and i froze. My mother rushed and called
911 and I</b>
<br><b>stared at my aunt. She looked like she had bent over in the sink
to get stuff</b>
<br><b>to clean and she had a heart attack and died. ( As i mentioned earlier
this</b>
<br><b>is what i started to do.) My aunt was facing the cross on the wall
which made</b>
<br><b>it even sadder.&nbsp; I ran out of the apartment and I didnt know
what to do. I</b>
<br><b>was very saddened and very frantic just seeing that.&nbsp; The funeral
came and I</b>
<br><b>wouldnt go near her. I could still smell the stench that prevailed
in her</b>
<br><b>apartment. It was horrible.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I started not being able to sleep at night thinking my aunts
ghost was in</b>
<br><b>the house and she was going to hurt me. My aunt would never do such
a thing</b>
<br><b>but my mind was so incredibly distraught i didnt know what to do.
I was taken</b>
<br><b>to doctors which couldnt do anything about my sleeping habits for
me. I was</b>
<br><b>driving my poor mother crazy screaming outloud in the middle of
the night for</b>
<br><b>her.&nbsp; Finally i had the dream.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in a half
of a church if u can imagine</b>
<br><b>that in the middle of a desert. Very windy and dusty.&nbsp; I walked
in and</b>
<br><b>kneeled down at the altar and said a hail mary and our father and
then</b>
<br><b>proceeded to turn around. When i did my aunt was standing right
behind me.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>ran to her quickly and hugged her and she looked the same but a
lil muffled</b>
<br><b>looking in a way. Her skin was a kind of orange color but it was
her.&nbsp;&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>explained to me that she was very sorry for having me to go through
what i</b>
<br><b>did. She never meant for it to happen and she loved us all. I was
crying in</b>
<br><b>my dream. She said it will all end now and you wont have to suffer
anymore.</b>
<br><b>The way the dream ended was kind of a future preminition... I was
in my papas</b>
<br><b>house who hadnt yet died and i was sitting in his chair. I looked
to the left</b>
<br><b>and down the hallway and saw an extremly bright light illumintating.&nbsp;
I knew</b>
<br><b>he was the next to go after her.&nbsp; I was in fact extremly close
with him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Six months later in May 1991, after battling cancer my papa
passed away. I</b>
<br><b>was devistated but at ease in a way. Before they were going to shut
the</b>
<br><b>coffin I ran to it without anyone around. My family was already
outside in</b>
<br><b>the limo.&nbsp; I sat up on the bench and stared down at him and
touched his</b>
<br><b>forehead.. It was warm.. like it had never lost life and the glimpse
on his</b>
<br><b>face was that of a smile.&nbsp; I felt at ease. He was the last
to go.&nbsp; I have my</b>
<br><b>parents who i cherish with my life and I also have my angels that
watch over</b>
<br><b>me. I know they are there and I get warned in my own ways if danger
arises.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I must say when i awoke from the dream that night, I was
crying and before</b>
<br><b>i could yell out from my mother i saw a black shadow pass outside
my door as</b>
<br><b>if my aunt was there sitting next to me. I screamed for my mother
and told</b>
<br><b>her what happen. I slept every night soundly after that.</b>

<br><b>My Strange Experiences Up To Now</b>

<p><b>By: chrell@earthlink.net</b>
<p><b>I grew up in a...shall I say particular(?) household.&nbsp; Its a
very old house and I have no knowledge of its history.&nbsp; but all my
life I always felt as if I was being watched, but I grew used to it.&nbsp;
well, 3 years ago, my grandma-great passed away.&nbsp; I felt retched,
I hadn't visited her while she was in the hospital.&nbsp; I cried and thought
"oh grandma, if only I could say good bye."&nbsp; later that day I was
down in the basement w/ my dog and my mom.&nbsp; my dog started barking
and growling w/his tail between his legs.&nbsp; I silently thought "good-bye
grandma.&nbsp; I'll always remember you."&nbsp; shortly after, we moved
to Lebanon, OH.&nbsp; unfortunately, I did not escape what had followed
me my entire life.&nbsp; I was over at my friends and we were joking around
and said "oooh...I feel a ghostly presence."&nbsp; suddenly, it got cold
and the candles went out.&nbsp; there was no draft, the vents were closed
and the door was too.&nbsp; it was winter so the windows were sealed and
locked.&nbsp; we were shaken, but we regained bravery.&nbsp; my friend,
she has a oiuja board and we asked if we could talk to the devil.&nbsp;
well my fiend got a strangled sensation and couldn't breathe.&nbsp; I got
on my knees and prayed/begged to god to let her live.&nbsp; I was sobbing
and she had turned a very pale blue/mauve shade. it stopped.&nbsp; after
that we prayed and went to bed.no other experiences I have experienced
since... and I am so very thankful.&nbsp; well, that is all up to now;

<br><b>My weird story...</b>
<p><b>By: Peluches69@aol.com</b>
<p><b>My name is Jorge.I am 18 and I've had some weird things happened
to me in</b>
<br><b>short years.My father died about 4 or 5 years ago.I moved with my
sister a</b>
<br><b>while after he died so I could go to school there.When I moved strange
things</b>
<br><b>started happening.I mostly ignored the little things (bed shaking
every</b>
<br><b>night,shadows in the dark,etc).The reason I ignored it was because
my sister</b>
<br><b>and her husband didn't belive me and because after a while I got
used to it</b>
<br><b>and wasn't scared of it.One night I was asleep and woke up because
of a noise</b>
<br><b>I guess,when I opened my eyes there was a woman I could tell was
old.I was</b>
<br><b>scared and paralysed for a split second.She started to say "stay
with her"</b>
<br><b>and thats when I jumped and turned on the light and she was gone.I
told my</b>
<br><b>sister like always and she said she didn't belive me but she had
felt weird</b>
<br><b>things too in the house before (people getting on the bed she was
in,a man</b>
<br><b>asking her where her son was,etc.)I guess she was just scared of
beliving it</b>
<br><b>was true.I tried to get info on the apartment but everyone told
me it was</b>
<br><b>brand new and nothing could have happened there before.I didn't
see anything</b>
<br><b>for awhile but the bed and chairs where I was at night usually still
shaked</b>
<br><b>from time to time.On another occassion I awoke (in the same room
as the last</b>
<br><b>apparition) to find an old man who seemed to be kneeled down next
to me as if</b>
<br><b>to wissper something,he dissapeared before I could hear what he
was trying to</b>
<br><b>say.The next day I tell my sister and husband as always,my sister's
husband</b>
<br><b>proceded to ask me "was it my grandfather?" I found that weird but
it happens</b>
<br><b>that his grandfather died that morning from a heart attack.I would
say it</b>
<br><b>wasn't because I saw the old man before his grand father died in
the</b>
<br><b>morning.I have moved now and the last thing that has happened to
me was not</b>
<br><b>more than a month ago.I awoke in the middle of the night to find
out I could</b>
<br><b>not move and I felt a pressence of evil beside me on the bed and
I could feel</b>
<br><b>he was smiling or grinning and yet I cannot explain exactly how
I knew this</b>
<br><b>since I was facing the other way,I could just feel it,he was jumping
up and</b>
<br><b>down on the bed and there was a light on the closet which the door
is just a</b>
<br><b>few feet off my feet.My sister has told me that I apparently attract
ghost or</b>
<br><b>there is one after me.Since I don't live with her anymore,she says
that the</b>
<br><b>only times she sees weird stuff and feels it is when I'm there,she
also says</b>
<br><b>that it could me my dad because before she died she rubbed his feet
because</b>
<br><b>it was cold in the hospital he was in,she said that one time I was
there she</b>
<br><b>felt someone rubbing her feet and thought it was him.I have also
felt a</b>
<br><b>pressence standing behind me at the end of the best that give out
a feeling</b>
<br><b>of saveness and comfort.Weird things have happened to me alot&nbsp;
but I cannot</b>
<br><b>write about them all because it would take to long.I also suffer
alot of</b>
<br><b>sleep paralysis on which I see apparitions and they are always evil
and scare</b>
<br><b>me even though I am used to seeing things.I would appreciate any
comments or</b>
<br><b>explanations to this happening to me.E-mail will be more than welcomed</b>
