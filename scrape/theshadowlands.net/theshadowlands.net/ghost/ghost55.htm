<H3><A NAME=coastie>Ghost Of a"Coastie" (Coast Guardsman)</A>
</H3><P><B>by sthompson@coslink.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>In the spring of 1973 I was a sixteen year-old girl living at home
with my parents.  As the youngest of six children, I was the only one still
at home and would sometimes spend the night alone in the house.  This was
not a case of negligence, but rather,  my parents were in their late 50's
and were suppose to be enjoying retirement.  Occasionally, they would take
"mini-trips" to any one of the many grat sites in Michigan.  On this particular
day they had journied to the American "SOO" (Sault Ste Marie) and would not
be home until the next day.  I had told my mom &amp; dad that I was inviting
my three best friends over for the night</B>
<P><B> but in fact, I secretly planned  to stay home alone as I  wanted a
little time away from my lively friends.  After making myself a home-cooked
meal (Mom's 'killer' leftover pot-roast!), doing homework and watching a
little TV, I retired for the night.  It should be noted here that the house
we lived in had been the living quarters of various former Coast Guard commanding
officers.  The area had been  a lifesaving</B>
<P><B>station (Pte Aux Barques) at one time and the lighthouse with keepers
cottage was located less than two hundred feet from our house - quite an
historical and picturesque location.  The surrounding 80-pus acres had been
sold to Huron County and was used as a seasonal campground catering to campers
&amp; fishermen (GREAT PERCH FISHING IN TOSE DAYS!!).  At that time of year
the park was still closed and our closest neighbors were some 2 miles away,
up the road on a farm.  At some point in the wee hours of the morning, I
awoke from a sound sleep in a state of complete immobility.  My entire body
felt as if tiny pins were poking it.  Hard as I tried, I was unable to move.
 I attempted to call out (though nobody would have heard me) but could not
get the sound to come out of my throat.  At the foot of my bed was the image
of a man with translucent, milky-white skin, a handlebar-like mustache and
VERY piercing eyes.  His clothing was dark, but very squared away - almost
military like.  I was scared out of my mind and it's a good thing my body
was numb as I might have wet my panties!  The tought of impending trouble
kept going through my brain and I distinctly heard a man's voice inside my
head instructing me to go downstairs and lock the door!  I could picture
myself getting up and going downstairs to lock the door and it was then that
the strange lock on my body was released and the man vanished.  Needless
to say,  I  evacuated that room immediately and headed downstairs to the
backdoor located in the kitchen.  It was indeed unlocked, so I locked it
and laid down on the couch in the living room (no way was I going back
upstairs!).  A short time later I was again awakened from a deep sleep by
the sound of the back door rattling.  As I</B>
<P><B>jumped (LITERALLY!) off the couch I noticed a car parked in the driveway
that circled in front of the house.  I went in to the kitchen and stared
through the large window in the now-locked door.  Standing on the enclosed
porch beyond the door was the seediest looking man I ever saw in my life!
 He was jiggling the door knob   and attempting to push open the solid oak
&amp; glass door with his shoulders.  To this 16 year old, he looked like
a very tall Charles Manson and I was terrified!!  I shouted at him "Get out
of here!"  and he looked straight at me.  For a few moments we made direct
eye contact and then he turned and walked out the door.</B>
<P><B>I never saw him - or the ghost - again.  However,  I was recently reading
a book about shipwrecks and came across a story regarding Denis Hale (lone
survivor of the foundered D&gt;J&gt; MORRELL 11/1966 not far from my lighthouse).
 Hale commented that an apparition had warned him not to eat the ice off
his beard ,  he would get pneumonia.  The man appeared twice as Hale drifted
towards shore in a raft, and Hale heeded the advice of his ghostly visitor.
 Hales description is slightly </B>
<P><B>different from my visitor as the 'raftghost' had long hair - my apparition
was rather clean-cut and dapper looking.  About a year ago, I was able to
put a face to my lifesaver when I was browsing through a wonderful book entitled
"WRECK ASHORE:  The United States Lifesaving Service on the Great Lakes"
 (Stonehouse).  On page 138 is the man I believed paid a visit to me on that
long ago  night of my girlhood - the man who may very well have prevented
a tragedy from befalling me:  Captain Henry Cleary, one time crew member
of the old Pte Aux Barques lifesaving station.  As I discovered, the captain
had been a hero in many rescues of shipwreck victims and was known for his
expertise in training techniques for rescuers.  He was actually born in Port
Hope (the nearby town) and  if he is the same apparition seen by Mr. Hale,
it would make sense:  Henry Cleary died of pneumonia on April 10, 1916 while
still in service to the coast guard;  he was fifty four years old. </B>

<H3><A NAME=girl>The Little Blond Girl</A>
</H3><P>by MzRob@worldnet.att.net
<P>
<P><B>I want to share a very strange yet wonderful experience I had in a
house I once lived in.</B>
<P><B> It all started when my brother, sister and her 2 yr old little girl
came to live with me in California. I believe now that the presence of a
child in a house that was previously childless brought out the entity. Shortly
after they all moved in, I was babysitting my niece while my sister worked.
It was close to 2am when I suddenly woke up to find a little blonde girl
about 2 years old standing in the doorway of my open bedroom door. She was
crying softly. I raised up and thinking it was my sister's daughter, I told
her to go back to bed. I laid back down, but decided to check on her to make
sure she was okay. I went where she was sleeping and that's exactly how I
found her, sleeping soundly. I was puzzled but thought that she might have
been sleepwalking. </B>
<P><B> The next day, I was brushing my hair. I put the brush in the bathroom
sink and turned around to get something. When I turned back around, the brush
was gone. I bent to look on the floor. Not finding it, I stood up and there
was the brush in the sink! I got a little scared. After that, my things always
came up missing. Everyday, I would "misplace" something only to find it right
back in front of me. It happened whether I was in the house alone or with
everyone at home. I saw the little girl several times always at night always
in my doorway. Even after my sister and her daughter had moved out. It got
to the point when I was so used to having my things taken and then given
back that I would just say, "okay, honey, give me back my bracelet" or whatever
was missing. Three times I heard a childlike giggle just before the item
was returned. I grew fond of the games she played and was never afraid of
her.</B>
<P><B> When we moved from the house, I drove back to put the key in the mailbox
for the next tenant. As I stepped onto the porch, I heard a child crying.
I peeked in the front window and there she sat in the middle of the empty
living room. Her hands were covering her eyes and she was sobbing. I knock
on the window and she looked up at me. I told her, "I'm so very sorry, honey,
but I cannot play with you anymore. I have to leave. I'm sorry." She smiled
at me that sweetest smile and I swear to God, she just vanished. I was sad
knowing I wouldn't see her or play our take and give back game again. But
deep down I knew she somehow understood how much I cared for her. </B>
<P><B> I think about her sometimes and wonder if she ever shared herself
with anyone else. I hope they enjoyed being with her as much as I did. She
shall always have a special place in my heart.</B>

<P>
<P><B>I'v emailed you b4 about the ghosts in my house, but my father told
me another story form his past that I thought you might find interesting.
 This was about 25 or 30 years ago when my father was in the Air Force. 
He and one of his buddys were out on a "date" with a couple of local girls
(this was in Alabama I think...around Craig Air Force Base...I think)  Dad
and his friend took the girls to an old cemetary to creep them out.  The
cemetary had a bunch of old graves that were kinda shallow and a few were
actuilly open.  My dad's friend reached into a hole in the ground and pulled
out a round object and shouted "Skull" and one of the girls fainted (a fine
southern belle, I'm sure)  The "skull" was actuially an old basket ball,
but the whole scene had disturbed somthing.  My dad said this loud growling
sound started.  They couldn't figure out where it was comeing from because
it seemed to come from everywhere.  Dad and his buddy grabbed the passed
out girl and they all ran out of the cemetary.  Funny thing is, the growling
stopped the second they passed out of the cemetary.</B>

<H3><A NAME=mother>My Mother</A>
</H3><P><B>by oneal4@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am a  woman in my forties and I live in a small town, about 2 hours</B>
<P><B>from Chicago.  Ihave two sisters.  My mother passed away suddenly on</B>
<P><B>November 18, 1993.  My parents were</B>
<P><B>snowbirds and lived in Arizona from October to April every year.  The</B>
<P><B>fall prior to my mother's death, my sister and her husband were
building</B>
<P><B>a new house.  They had sold their home and had to move before their</B>
<P><B>house was completed.  When my parents went to Arizona, they moved
into</B>
<P><B>their house until they could move to their new home.  When my parents</B>
<P><B>returned in April, and after my sister had already moved into her new</B>
<P><B>home, my sister could not find a photo album of her little girl.  It</B>
<P><B>contained all of her baby pictures.  It really bothered my sister and</B>
<P><B>she called my mom many times asking her to look around the house and
see</B>
<P><B>if she could find where she might have stored it.  She never did. 
</B>
<P>
<P><B>That fall my parents left for Arizona in November.  My mother died
10</B>
<P><B>days after they got there.   About a week after her death, my sister</B>
<P><B>went to the basement for something.  They still had not completly</B>
<P><B>unpacked and boxes were everywhere.  To my sister's astonishment,
there</B>
<P><B>layed the photo album on top of all of the other unopened boxes with
the</B>
<P><B>album opened, revealing my niece's baby pictures!  She asked her
husband</B>
<P><B>and her five year old daughter if they had been in the basement. 
Both</B>
<P><B>had said no.  I know my niece would be too afraid to go to the
basement</B>
<P><B>by herself.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Another strange occurance with my mother's death at my sister's 
house</B>
<P><B>was when her front door would always open by itself.  My mother had</B>
<P><B>fallen walking out of the front door the spring before that and had</B>
<P><B>broken her wrist.  After her death, the door would seem to open by</B>
<P><B>itself.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My mother was very close to her sister-in-law that lived next door
to</B>
<P><B>her.  The summer before my mother died, she gave her a music box that</B>
<P><B>would only play by winding the knob on the bottom.  The day my mother</B>
<P><B>died, my aunt was home alone.  All of the sudden, the music box
started</B>
<P><B>playing.  She thought that was odd.  She then received a  phone call
a</B>
<P><B>few minutes later  from my dad telling her that my mother had passed</B>
<P><B>away at 8:30 a.m. that morning, the same time the music box played.
 She</B>
<P><B>thinks this was my mother telling her goodbye.</B>

</H3><P><B>by booberdee@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've written to other sites before, but this is my first time here...</B>
<P><B>I hope you enjoy these few of my experiences.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, when my parents moved to the apartment my mother still lives
in</B>
<P><B>today, I noticed that it has some quirks...  You see, the apartment</B>
<P><B>has a few mischievous occupants I call gremlins...  They tend to take</B>
<P><B>items for sometime and then relocate them.  I will explain...</B>
<P>
<P><B>One day, my Mom left  $20 in the front pocket of her jeans.  She</B>
<P><B>realized sometime later that she needed to run to the store, so she</B>
<P><B>went back to her room to get the money.  After a few minutes, she</B>
<P><B>called out to me, saying that she needed help. She couldn't find the</B>
<P><B>money, so she asked me to look in the pocket.  I didn't find it</B>
<P><B>either. I searched quite a few times before I turned to her and asked</B>
<P><B>if she was mistaken. Had she taken the money out before? Was she</B>
<P><B>wearing a different pair of jeans? Was she sure she placed the money</B>
<P><B>in her jeans and not in a jacket?  "No" to each question...</B>
<P><B>"Alright, Mom... You know how this house is... Wait for about 20</B>
<P><B>minutes and look again."  Mom did as I suggested, opting to read a</B>
<P><B>book in the kitchen for a while.  After about half an hour, she went</B>
<P><B>back to check. Where was the money?  In the same pocket I had checked</B>
<P><B>at least 6 times thirty minutes before...</B>
<P>
<P><B>She is not the only "victim" to these little practical jokers...  One</B>
<P><B>night, my best friends, Coraly, Mia, and Ralph came over to chitchat.
</B>
<P><B>Sometime later, I felt the need to smoke a cigarette (Newports at the</B>
<P><B>time).  Unfortunately, being a college student, neatness was not my</B>
<P><B>forte. My coffee table was cluttered with everything from magazines
to</B>
<P><B>jewelry. So, knowing I put my pack on this mountain of stuff, I</B>
<P><B>continued to talk while I searched.  Frustrated after a few moments,
I</B>
<P><B>pleaded with my friends to help me take EVERYTHING off of the table
so</B>
<P><B>I could find the Newports.  We shook out magazines, cleared off the</B>
<P><B>table, even threw out some stuff, but the pack just simply was not</B>
<P><B>there. The closest thing that matched the coloring of the pack was
an</B>
<P><B>empty Noxema carton.  Oh well, I figured I'd just grab a cigarette</B>
<P><B>from my Mom.  So, we straightened up the table and continued to talk.
</B>
<P><B>After some time, while puffing and chitchatting away, I managed to</B>
<P><B>look at the table (which, of course, was right in front of me) and
saw</B>
<P><B>my pack of cigarettes, nestled between the pages of a magazine.  I</B>
<P><B>said "Oh, guys.... You are never going to believe this...", and picked
up</B>
<P><B>the pack.  The look of shock on each of their faces was undeniable.
</B>
<P><B>Now before this episode, I had spoken to them about the goings on in</B>
<P><B>my house, but each time I received a polite "sure, whatever you
say"</B>
<P><B>coupled with an "I don't believe you" eye-roll. To this day, my</B>
<P><B>friends are believers.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm positive that these little guys are not the only ones sharing</B>
<P><B>living space with my Mom... One night, Coraly was over for dinner.
Doing</B>
<P><B>our usual thing, we sat in my living room talking of nothing and</B>
<P><B>everything.  Suddenly, it hit me... I smelled fried fish!
 "Don't you</B>
<P><B>smell it?", I asked.  Of course she didn't, until a few minutes
later,</B>
<P><B>when the smell left me.  Back and forth, for over an hour, the smell</B>
<P><B>drifted between us, changing once in a while to the scent of fresh</B>
<P><B>flowers.  After a while, it faded until we could no longer smell it.
</B>
<P><B>I don't know who it was or what it was trying to say, but it
certainly</B>
<P><B>was an interesting experience. </B>

</H3><P><B>by CATnM0USE2@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> My story happened about 20 years ago, it was a series of three
happenings.</B>
<P><B>The most vivid is this one,</B>
<P><B> One night my husband and I had gone to bed.  He feel asleep right
away but I</B>
<P><B>wasn't really sleepy and was just laying there looking out thru the
bedroom</B>
<P><B>door and from there I could see into the living room and a picture
window that</B>
<P><B>is there.  Its about 60inches by 48 inches.  </B>
<P><B>After looking for a few minutes I noticed there seemed to be a man
standing</B>
<P><B>there.  He was dressed in a coat that over lapped in the front with
gold 3</B>
<P><B>gold buttons.  At first he didn't have a hat on and then he did, it
was a high</B>
<P><B>hat but not what I have heard called a stove pipe hat, it was smaller
then</B>
<P><B>that.  Anyway I thought he was an intruder so I woke my husband up
and I was</B>
<P><B>watching the man the whole time and he moved or a better word is wavered.
 I</B>
<P><B>with great effort got my husband up and told him there was someone
in the</B>
<P><B>house, and I could see the man in the livingroom as my husband got
up to look.</B>
<P><B>When my husband blocked my view thru the door and whentinto the living
room I</B>
<P><B>didn't see the man anymore and I thought who ever had went into the</B>
<P><B>kitchen......expecting to hear the sound of a fight any second and
I was</B>
<P><B>surprised when my husband came back in the bedroom and said nobody
was there.</B>
<P><B>He said I was imaging things and has always scoffed at the idea I had
seen a</B>
<P><B>ghost.  But Iam a rather practical person and I dont think it was my</B>
<P><B>imagination..... thanks </B>

<H3><B><A NAME=lady>The Lady on the Bridge</A></B>
</H3><P><B>by tarianna@theshadowlands.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is alittle off my chronological order of my experiences, but I
saw a car</B>
<P><B>accident recently that reminded me of this.</B>
<P><B>   The Lady On The Bridge</B>
<P>
<P><B>     About 2 weeks before I was to married I was driving my car down
a back</B>
<P><B>road in my home town to go to the store. We used to have railroad tracks
run</B>
<P><B>through the town from East to West and I was going North to South.
 The</B>
<P><B>railroad tracks had been torn out and now the old track was a driveway
for</B>
<P><B>some houses set back from the town.  The driveway was flanked by a
modular</B>
<P><B>home built in the 70's on the south side and a creek on the North.
 A sidewalk</B>
<P><B>bridge crossed the creek for about 1/2 a city block with a dropoff
on either</B>
<P><B>side of about 4 feet. On the North side of the creek was an older house
that</B>
<P><B>had been built when the town was founded.  It had been used as a hospital
and</B>
<P><B>a funeral home to name a few.  At the time of this incident in 1982,
it was</B>
<P><B>and had been used as a private home for many years. As I was saying
I was</B>
<P><B>coming down the hill toward the bridge when I noticed a Lady just starting
to</B>
<P><B>cross the bridge.  She was dressed all in black with a black lace veil
across</B>
<P><B>her face.  Her clothes were turn of the century mostly lace and silk
or satin.</B>
<P><B>She was wearing no coat and this being December in the Midwest it was
very</B>
<P><B>cold out. Everyone in this town knew everyone else(very small town)
and I</B>
<P><B>didn't recognize this woman.</B>
<P><B>Anyway I was so intent on watching this lady that I didn't see the
car leaving</B>
<P><B>the driveway(old railroad tracks) and he didn't see me.  He plowed
into me and</B>
<P><B>it took a minute to get out and we both looked at each other (he was
a</B>
<P><B>neighbor that used to live across the street from me and I had played
with his</B>
<P><B>son when we were little).</B>
<P><B>We said both at the same time "I was watching the Lady on the bridge
and</B>
<P><B>didn't see you"  This all took about a minute and then we both looked
at the</B>
<P><B>bridge and the lady was gone!  There is no way she could have crossed
the</B>
<P><B>bridge in that short amount of time and upon further inspection there
were no</B>
<P><B>tracks in the inch of snow that had fallen the night before.  </B>
<P><B>One of the first but not last ghostly experiences I've had in broad
daylight.</B>
<P><B>I welcome questions and comments and any theories you may have to what
I saw.</B>
<P><B>Thank you for your time.</B>

<P>
<P><B>My house is haunted by many different ghost. One is my grandmother
which </B>
<P><B>died in one of the rooms, one is my brother which died in a car </B>
<P><B>accident this year and the other I don't know where they came from.
The</B>
<P><B>reason I know it's my grandmother because we can smell her perfume.
My </B>
<P><B>brother used to go from his bedroom to the bathroom shutting the doors
</B>
<P><B>behind him that just started to happen. We don't know who the others
are but </B>
<P><B>we know they are there, one will call to you tell you to come here,</B>
<P><B>another one turns the t.v. off or on. Doors will open by themselfs
. </B>
<P><B>Sometimes we hear another voice but can't make it out. At times you
feel like </B>
<P><B>you are been watched. Our dogs will look in to the kitchen or the hallway
</B>
<P><B>and bark. There are even shadows that you see out of the corner of
your </B>

<H3><A NAME=little>My Two Little Spirits</A>
</H3><P><B>by olveda@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've live in my house since 1975. Lots of things have happened, not
bad </B>
<P><B>things, but unexplainable things...here are some examples:</B>
<P>
<P><B>1) One night, when my daughter was about 4, my husband and I were </B>
<P><B>sitting in the TV room watching Johnny Carson.  We closed the door
to </B>
<P><B>the TV room so that we would not wake my daughter.  We suddenly heard
a </B>
<P><B>loud BANG on the closed door.  We both jumped up to open the door </B>
<P><B>thinking that my daughter had awaken and ran into the door.  When we
</B>
<P><B>opened the door, there was no one there and my daughter was sound asleep
</B>
<P><B>in her bed.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>2) My husband used to keep aluminum chairs hung on big nails on the
wall </B>
<P><B>in the garage.  We would hear them fall on the concrete floor during
the </B>
<P><B>night.  In the morning, we'd go into the garage to pick them up and
they </B>
<P><B>were all still hanging on the nails on the wall.  None of them had
</B>
<P><B>fallen!!</B>
<P>
<P><B>3) Sometimes when I'm cooking, I feel a hand on my shoulder or on my
</B>
<P><B>hip, or a tug on my blouse.  I turn to look thinking its my husband
or </B>
<P><B>one of my daughters, but no one is there.  This has happens often...say
</B>
<P><B>about 4 times a year.</B>
<P>
<P><B>4) My husband tells me that he feels and hears somebody sneaking up
on </B>
<P><B>him.  He turns quickly thinking that I'm trying to scare him, but there
</B>
<P><B>is no one there. </B>
<P>
<P><B>5) We had a piano about 10 years ago. I would sometimes hear the sound
</B>
<P><B>of the deepest note on the piano early in the morning.  When I wake
up </B>
<P><B>and I can still hear the ringing of the note.  My daughter told me
just </B>
<P><B>recently, that when she would have slumber parties, her friends used
to </B>
<P><B>hear the piano playing.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>6) I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night.  I open my eyes
to </B>
<P><B>glance at the clock, and the room is red....it suddenly turns dark.
 My </B>
<P><B>husband says he has also seen that but he never told me until he </B>
<P><B>overheard me telling my sister.</B>
<P>
<P><B>7) I have a heavy candle holder that holds 4 candles.  A friend came
to </B>
<P><B>visit me one evening so I lit the candles.  When I went into the room
</B>
<P><B>where the candles were, the candle holder was on the floor and there
was </B>
<P><B>no candle wax on the floor.  It's impossible that the candle holder
fell </B>
<P><B>over because it was in the middle of the table.  My daughters were
</B>
<P><B>visiting their father (we were divorced by that time) and it was just
my </B>
<P><B>friend and I in the house, so no one could have put it on the floor.</B>
<P>
<P><B>8) Another time, another friend and her son visited.  It was late one
</B>
<P><B>Saturday night and her son had fallen asleep on the small sofa in the
</B>
<P><B>living room.  I asked my friend to stay the night so she wouldn't have
</B>
<P><B>to wake him up.  She agreed and sleep on the other sofa in the living
</B>
<P><B>room.  I went to bed.  In the morning, she asked me why I was making
so </B>
<P><B>much noise in the kitchen during the night.  She asked me if I was
</B>
<P><B>making tortillas, or sandwiches.  I told her that I never got up during
</B>
<P><B>the night....that's when her son said....yes, stella, I saw you standing
</B>
<P><B>on the doorway looking at us!....my friend said she saw me, or saw
a </B>
<P><B>shadow of someone standing at the doorway looking at them. It was not
me </B>
<P><B>because I never got up and we were the only 3 people in the house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>9) This past September, my cousin was visiting from California. We
had </B>
<P><B>planned get up early and go visit some relatives on Sunday morning.
 We </B>
<P><B>had stayed up very late on Saturday night, so when Sunday came around,
</B>
<P><B>we wound up sleeping late and not getting up.  When we got up, my cousin
</B>
<P><B>said I kept him up all night with all the noise I was making in the
</B>
<P><B>kitchen during the night.  He said he woke up several times to the
sound </B>
<P><B>of pots and pans, the sound of beating eggs in a bowl....he actually
</B>
<P><B>thought I was making breakfast so that we could get an early start.
 He </B>
<P><B>got up, went to the bathroom, and when he came out of the bathroom,
he </B>
<P><B>saw the kitchen light turn off and the pots and pans silence.  He went
</B>
<P><B>into the TV room where my husband and I were sleeping thinking we were
</B>
<P><B>trying to play a trick on him.  He said "Hey, are we leaving </B>
<P><B>now??"....but both my husband and I were sound asleep.  The only other
</B>
<P><B>person in the house was my daughter, and she was asleep in her room
with </B>
<P><B>the door closed.</B>
<P>
<P><B>10) Most recently (father's day weekend), we went out of town.  We
asked </B>
<P><B>a friend if he would come over to feed our pets, get our mail, pick
up </B>
<P><B>our newspaper, etc.  He said on Friday night, he came over to feed
our </B>
<P><B>pets.  He went out the back door to feed the dog, and when he tried
to </B>
<P><B>re-enter the house, the door was locked.  Luckily he had the key to
the </B>
<P><B>front door in his pocket, so he went around to the front of the house,
</B>
<P><B>unlocked the door and went straight to the back door.  The latch was
</B>
<P><B>latched!!! He yelled out "Is anybody here? Its me Roland?"  He thought
</B>
<P><B>somebody was in the house and locked him out because it seemed </B>
<P><B>impossible that the latch would latch by itself!! That same night,
he </B>
<P><B>left 2 lights on per my instruction.  Saturday morning when he came
to </B>
<P><B>turn them off, the lights were already off.  He said he thought that
we </B>
<P><B>had given our housekeys to somebody else and that that  person had
beat </B>
<P><B>him to it and turned off the lights.  No one else had the keys to our
</B>
<P><B>house and he knew nothing of the stories I've told you.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I told a friend about our house experiences.  She gave me the address
of </B>
<P><B>a friend who is a psychic.  I e-mailed the psychic with my stories.
 She </B>
<P><B>asked me to send her 2 items....one belonging to me and one 'house'
</B>
<P><B>item.  I sent her an old brooch and a tile from our kitchen.  She said
</B>
<P><B>that I have 2 spirits in the house....a 5 year old and a 12 year old.
 </B>
<P><B>She said the 5 year old (Jane) is 'lost' and cries a lot for her parents
</B>
<P><B>who left her.  She was not sure if they died and the little girl moved
</B>
<P><B>away or if the little girl died and the parents moved away.  She also
</B>
<P><B>told me that the little girl's parents were laborers who worked in
the </B>
<P><B>fields.  The 12 year old spirit (Lisa) was sent to take care of the
5 </B>
<P><B>year old so that she would not be afraid.  They told the psychic that
</B>
<P><B>our cat can see them and that they laugh at me because I get mad at
the </B>
<P><B>cat when I get home from work, thinking that the cat messed up the
bed, </B>
<P><B>when it was the spirits...they like to play on my bed when I'm away.
 </B>
<P>
<P><B>To this day, we continue to sense their presence, either by a tap on
our </B>
<P><B>shoulder, tug of my skirt, or quick flash of 'something'...</B>
<P>
<P><B>These are the stories that come to mind, there are others.  What ever
</B>
<P><B>spirits are in our home, they have never tried to hurt us and we are
not </B>
<P><B>afraid.  We've become so accustomed to the noises and strange </B>
<P><B>happenings, that we don't mind having them in our home.  My daughters
</B>
<P><B>have never been afraid, not even when they were little.</B>

<H3> <A NAME=love>A Mothers Love</A>
</H3><P><B>by SheerMyst@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was a Registered Nurse employed by a large Jail in a very large
Southern</B>
<P><B>City.  I had a normal life, three children a Police Officer Husband
and a nice</B>
<P><B>home in the suburbs.  The only thing really different about me was
that my own</B>
<P><B>Mother died when I was less than a year old.  This used to bother me
when I</B>
<P><B>was little.  I would wake up in tears for no reason and cry "why did
you leave</B>
<P><B>me?"</B>
<P><B>        I had worked the night shift at the jail so by the time I got
home and</B>
<P><B>got the kids off to school it was at least 9 am before I could go to
bed.  I</B>
<P><B>was really tired this one day and was really sleeping hard when my
husband</B>
<P><B>said he and my middle son Scott were going to the store.  I think I
mumbled</B>
<P><B>and turned over and went right back to sleep.  All of a sudden I heard
a</B>
<P><B>lawnmower cutting grass and I could smell the fresh fragrance.  It
was strange</B>
<P><B>though, I thought I've overslept because it was dark.  I looked around
and saw</B>
<P><B>I was in a cemetery and it was night.  Still the lawnmower and the
smell.  All</B>
<P><B>of a sudden I walked up on the strangest site.  It was stuck in the
ground by</B>
<P><B>a headstone, like you put flowers and things by a grave.  This looks
like a</B>
<P><B>brightly lit sign that said Edie.  It was right next to a headstone
that had</B>
<P><B>my Mothers name on it.  Then I heard a voice calling my name.  It said
Sharon</B>
<P><B>I've come to be with you awhile because I am needed.  This was my Mother
I</B>
<P><B>thought but that's impossible.  The voice spoke and said no, I am your
mother.</B>
<P><B>I asked her to come where I could see her.  Her reply was that she
had been</B>
<P><B>gone from this earth too long and there was nothing for me to see.
 She</B>
<P><B>continued to tell me that she would put out her hand when it was needed.
 I</B>
<P><B>begged her to come see my children and my husband.  She Said "Sharon
I have</B>
<P><B>seen them all and it wont happen to you not like me, I won't let it"
I started</B>
<P><B>to ask a hundred questions but she would only say that she would be
where she</B>
<P><B>was needed.  Then she was gone.  I woke up in a bright bedroom with
tears</B>
<P><B>running down my face and I thought I had a dream, but why did I still
smell</B>
<P><B>fresh cut grass.  I rested across my bed thinking of what had happened.
</B>
<P><B>      Suddenly my 12 year old son came tearing in and threw his arms
around me</B>
<P><B>and just sobbed.  He told me" Mommy we almost died, a big car hit us"
I jumped</B>
<P><B>up and ran out to the garage to see about my husband.  He put his arms
around</B>
<P><B>me and assured me they were both OK but the car was totaled.  Then
he told the</B>
<P><B>strangest thing.  He said a big Oldsmobile hit them broadside going
over 50</B>
<P><B>and our car just crumpled and folded up on impact except the are of
the front</B>
<P><B>seat.  Other Officers said it looked like a giant hand reached out
and held</B>
<P><B>that part of the car and kept it from collapsing because the rest of
the car</B>
<P><B>was gone.  They all said that they should have died in that accident.</B>
<P><B>All of a sudden I remembered my Mothers promise "I will put out my
hand when</B>
<P><B>it is needed."  You see, my Mother was expecting me when my Dad went
off to</B>
<P><B>sea duty in the USNavy at the beginning of World War ll.  He never
saw my</B>
<P><B>Mother again and I was a year old before he was introduced to me. </B>
<P><B>       My Mother loved my Dad with an almost superhuman love and she
had gone</B>
<P><B>through such loneliness while he was gone.  I believe that she decided
that</B>
<P><B>she would prevent my husband being taken from me.  She wanted to prevent
me</B>
<P><B>from having that kind of heartache and grief.  So she came to me and
put out</B>
<P><B>her hand when it was needed.  Thank you Mother.</B>

<H3><A NAME=warning>The Captains Warning </A>
</H3><P><B>by sthompson@coslink.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>In the spring of 1973 I was a sixteen year-old girl living at home
with my parents.  As the only child left living at home, I would sometimes
spend the night alone in </B>
<P><B>the house.  This was not a case of negligence, but rather, my parents
were in</B>
<P><B>their late 50's a were suppose to be in retirement.  Occasionally,
they would take </B>
<P><B>"mini-trips" to any of the many great spots in Michigan.  On this
particular day, they had journeyed to the "SOO" and would not be home until
the next day.  I lied to them and had said I was planning to invite three
girlfriends to spend the night - but I really liked solitude and wanted the
opportunity to be on my own!  After making a "home-cooked" meal for myself
(actually, mom's leftover pot roast!), doing homework and watching a little
TV, I retired for the night.   It should be noted here that the house we
lived in had been the former quarters for various Coast Guard commanding
officers.  The area had been a life saving station (Pte Aux Barques) at one
time and the lighthouse and keepers quarters were located in close proximity
to our house.  Though the lighthouse still belonged to the Coast Guard, the
surrounding 80 plus acres had been transformed into a county park, catering
 to campers and fishermen.  At this time of year, the park was still closed</B>
<P><B>and our closest neighbors were farmers some two miles up the road.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>     At some point in the middle of the night, I awoke from a sound
sleep and was</B>
<P><B>in a state of complete immobility.  My entire body felt as if tiny
pins were poking</B>
<P><B>it, and hard as I tried, I was unable to move.  I attempted to call
out (though nobody would have heard me) but could not get sound to come out
of my throat.</B>
<P><B>At the foot of my bed was the image of a man with milky white skin,
a handlebar-like mustache and VERY piercing eyes.  His clothing was dark,
but appeared almost military-like.  I was scared out of my mind!  The thought
of impending trouble kept going through my brain, and I distinctly heard
a man's voice inside my</B>
<P><B>head telling me to go downstairs and lock the door!  When I mentally
saw myself getting up &amp; going downstairs, the strange lock on my body
was released and the </B>
<P><B>man vanished.  When I got downstairs, the door was indeed unlocked,
so I locked</B>
<P><B>it and laid down on the couch in the living room.  There was no way
I was going back upstairs!  A few hours later, I was again awakened by the
sound of the now-</B>
<P><B>locked door  being rattled.  I jumped up, and as I did, noticed a car
in our driveway.  I went into the kitchen where the entry door was located
and there stood the seediest looking man I ever saw in my life.  I must have
startled him, because he turned and ran when I shouted "get out of here!".
  I never saw the ghost in person again, but I read an article several years
later in which Denis Hale, lone survivor of the steamer DANIEL J. MORRELL
(sunk in Nov. 1966 just a few miles from the lighthouse) commented that while
 coming ashore in a liferaft, he began to eat the ice from his beard and
an apparition of a man fitting the description of my</B>
<P><B>"lifesaver" appeared on the raft &amp; told him not to eat the ice.
 The man appeared twice more with the same warning until Hale stopped eating
the ice.  His visitor </B>
<P><B>spoke directly to him and even advised him that eating the ice would
cause pneumonia!   </B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>    Recently, I purchased a copy of a wonderful book entitled "WRECK
ASHORE: The United States Lifesaving Service on the Great Lakes".  On page
138 is a picture of the man I saw in my room that night - the man who may
have prevented</B>
<P><B>something terrible happening to me:  Captain Henry Cleary,  one-time
crew member of the old Pte. Aux Barques Lifesaving Station (still in existance,
but moved to a museum-town up the road a few  miles).  As I discovered, Captain
Cleary was quite a heroic officer and  the  "savior" of many shipwreck victims.
 He</B>
<P><B>was actually born in the vicinity of where my family was now living,
and is buried in</B>
<P><B>a local cemetery nearby.  Another interesting fact:  if  Cleary is
the same man Denis Hale saw, it would make sense:  Captain Henry Cleary died
of pneumonia on April 10, 1916 while still in the service of lifesaving.
 He was 54 years old.  </B>

<H3><A NAME=riverview>The House In Riverview</A>
</H3><P><B>by  &nbsp;powerskris@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well! I have been reading the stories posted here and I was reminded</B>
<P><B>so much of my own experiences that I decided to share them!</B>
<P><B>    I have had more than one experience but the one that concerned
me</B>
<P><B>the most involved my house (my parents still live there but I moved
out</B>
<P><B>about eight months ago.)</B>
<P><B>    We moved into this house in Riverview, NB almost eight years ago.</B>
<P><B>Things began happening infrequently shortly after we moved in. At the</B>
<P><B>time I was indifferent to the idea of ghosts, I had few to no</B>
<P><B>encounters. Three weeks after moving in, my mother told me that she
had</B>
<P><B>woken up in the middle of the night to the sound of a baby crying.
I am</B>
<P><B>the youngest in the family and at the time was thirteen, incidentally
I</B>
<P><B>am not prone to wailing in my sleep. ;)</B>
<P><B>    For two years nothing happened, then at the same time of year
that</B>
<P><B>my mother had complained of the crying, I was in my bed waiting for
my</B>
<P><B>dog to come back upstairs ( I had to take him outside personally
because</B>
<P><B>he was to old to get off the bed by then, he ALWAYS came back
upstairs</B>
<P><B>after eating.) As I was listening for the sound of my dog coming back</B>
<P><B>into the room,something happened. My eyes were closed but I noticed
the</B>
<P><B>room become incredibly bright. I heard someone scream into my right
ear,</B>
<P><B>it wasn't loud but it was the tone and the complete malevolence in
the</B>
<P><B>person's voice that scared the hell of me, needless to say I was
fully</B>
<P><B>awake in less than a second. AS I opened my eyes I was blinded by
this</B>
<P><B>white light, when my eyes were fully open the voice stopped and</B>
<P><B>everything was normal.</B>
<P><B>    Then nothing for two more years, again at the same time of year,
I</B>
<P><B>was sleeping in my bed, and I was shaken awake. At the time I weighed
a</B>
<P><B>considerable amount, but I was still shaken like a rag doll.  My
entire</B>
<P><B>upper body was coming off the bed. I could feel a hand on my shoulder</B>
<P><B>with an iron grip. I sat up in bed and looked to my right because I</B>
<P><B>noticed something standing there. For a moment I saw a dim yellow
figure</B>
<P><B>that quickly disappeared. I knew it wasn't a dream because I looked
at</B>
<P><B>my alarm clock and noticed the time was exactly 2:12 am.</B>
<P><B>    Again nothing happened for two years, than the sh_t hit the fan,
so</B>
<P><B>to say! My sister and I both heard voices, but only in my room, our
cat</B>
<P><B>would follow the movement of things that were not there. An old,
broken,</B>
<P><B>and unplugged tv would glow as if was on and did this quite
frequently.</B>
<P><B>I could hear breathing in my room when I was the only one in there
and</B>
<P><B>the door was closed.</B>
<P><B>    One of my brother's friends walked into the house knowing nothing
of</B>
<P><B>it and immediately asked if there was anything strange happening in
the</B>
<P><B>house.</B>
<P><B>    People felt distinctly uncomfortable in the room as did I. None
of</B>
<P><B>my family went into the room besides me. I had nightmares, but only
in</B>
<P><B>that room! </B>
<P><B>    Here is the biggest part of the physical proof, the room was
always</B>
<P><B>freezing! I don't mean chilly, I MEAN freezing! I kept my door closed</B>
<P><B>over night, when people would enter in the morning and wake me up,
both</B>
<P><B>they and I would notice the temperature was no more than 5 degrees</B>
<P><B>Celsius ( I have no idea what that is in Farenheit) but that is just</B>
<P><B>above freezing.</B>
<P><B>    Then, after about eighteen months of these frequent happenings,
it</B>
<P><B>all stopped, the room is always warm and has a very friendly feeling.
I</B>
<P><B>guess whatever was there decided to move on. I can't say I miss it!</B>
<P><B>    Thanx for you time.</B>

</H3><P><B>by skane@fv.stlcc.cc.mo.us    </B>
<P>
<P><B>I'll start my story when I was a baby. My mother had mental problems
and</B>
<P><B>I spent much of my first 4 years in the home of my great
grandparents.</B>
<P><B>When my mother wasn't in the hospital, they would frequently stay at
our</B>
<P><B>house. I found out later that it was to protect me from her violent</B>
<P><B>erratic behavior when she would have a spell.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Jump a head to Spring 1982 When I was 12 years old, </B>
<P>
<P><B>I spent the night at a friends home. It was a dark, stormy night (I</B>
<P><B>know, nights are supposed to be dark, but it's true!) the three of
us</B>
<P><B>were laying in our speeping bags in Pam's living room at the back
corner</B>
<P><B>of her home. We'd turned everything off, not that it mattered, the
power</B>
<P><B>went off around 10:45. We'd been laying there maybe half an hour when
I</B>
<P><B>noticed hazy images of my great grandparents (They'd been dead for
about</B>
<P><B>8 years) </B>
<P>
<P><B>Dawn covered her head (She' was sucha baby even then!) Pam and I just</B>
<P><B>stared. The images grew brighter, and it seemed like we were inside
a</B>
<P><B>glowing ball. We could hear some of the storm from outside, but it
was</B>
<P><B>like we had cotton in our ears. It seemed like my great grandmother
was</B>
<P><B>trying to say something, but there was no sound from them. The
glowing</B>
<P><B>sphere around us seemed to mesh with the walls gradually, so that now</B>
<P><B>the wall seemed to be glowing. Then the walls seemed to tremble. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Pam's dad was wakened by the storm and yelled for us to go to the</B>
<P><B>basement as he ran down the steps. The moment we left the room, the
glow</B>
<P><B>disappeared, the sounds of the storm returned, and the walls
collapsed.</B>
<P><B>A tree had fallen on the house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next day, when we had calmed down, Pam and I talked about what
we</B>
<P><B>had seen. I wrote a discription of my great grandparents as I had
last</B>
<P><B>seen them. She had long BLACK hair (very vain about her hair, still
dyed</B>
<P><B>it at the age of 83) that she kept in braids wrapped around her head</B>
<P><B>like a crown. One of her eyes was very clouded by cateracts, the other
a</B>
<P><B>very dark green. Her skin was very white, and deeply lined. My great</B>
<P><B>grand dad looked like a skinny Santa, fluffy white beard, slightly
bald</B>
<P><B>on top, but with plenty of white hair on the sides.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Then I asked Pam to describe what she had seen. when she finished,
I</B>
<P><B>handed her my descriptions, and she was amazed that the descritions
were</B>
<P><B>so similar.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I got back home, I found a picture of them tucked into my
mirror.</B>
<P><B>That might not be significant if it was a picture of their wedding
day</B>
<P><B>that was supposed to be destroyed in a house fire nearly 75 years</B>
<P><B>before.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am convinced that what we saw was the sprits of my
greatgrandparents</B>
<P><B>protecting me in death as they used to in life.</B>

<P><B>**********************************************</B>
<P><B>(1)  Around 1984/1985 (It's been so long ago)</B>
<P>
<P><B>	I remember one evening my cousins (3 of them) and I were in a room</B>
<P><B>watching "Yentl", with Barbara streisand, I remember how disappointed
we</B>
<P><B>all were about the movie being sooooo boring.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>	Anyway, in the middle of the movie, a beautiful white figure, </B>
<P><B>came out the from the bathroom - and went down the stairs. (that's
from</B>
<P><B>the righ side- outside of the door - going left and downstairs.) I</B>
<P><B>specifically remember the way the white gown dragged slowly on the</B>
<P><B>stairs outlining the stairs. It was a person, but no visible feet.
 My</B>
<P><B>cousins and I stared at each other, and wondered if we all saw the
same</B>
<P><B>thing.   My oldest cousin, the owner of the house, said "oh, that's
just</B>
<P><B>my Mom, she's always here."</B>
<P><B> 	My youngest cousin cried with fear, I was scared but because it was
a</B>
<P><B>very white light figure, I wasn't scared - had it been any other
color,</B>
<P><B>I'd probably cry with fear too.  None of us ever spoke about it again.
</B>
<P><B>I did face the fact, and asked my cousin if he remember that ghost
we</B>
<P><B>saw,  he was amazed I still remembered, but he confirmed my memory
was</B>
<P><B>intact.</B>

<P><B>(2)  1988-89 - My Ex-husband's Mom Visted us? She died 8/12/88</B>
<P><B>	</B>
<P><B>	My daughter, born 8/17/88, fell asleep on our sofabed, my husband
had</B>
<P><B>arrived home tired.   He ate dinner, took his bath and hit the bed.
 I</B>
<P><B>remember he fell asleep quick.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	I was lying down next to my daughter, and I literally felt someone
walk</B>
<P><B>by us, breeze and footsteps!  Well, I couldn't see because the room
was</B>
<P><B>so dark, I was so surprised I called out my ex's name,</B>
<P><B> "Tim?", </B>
<P>
<P><B>		and he answered me, as if he were standing in front of the bathroom
-</B>
<P><B>located between the living room (where my daughter was asleep) and
my</B>
<P><B>bedroom (where I thought Tim was sleeping)</B>
<P>
<P><B> "what?",</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I said, "nothing you scared me, I thought you fell asleep.", then I
felt</B>
<P><B>real cold, I covered my daughter and ran into my bedroom to get
another</B>
<P><B>blanket - I thought it was safe to jump on the bed because Tim was
in</B>
<P><B>the bathroom, and to my surprise I jumped on Tim - who was sleeping
in</B>
<P><B>the bed afterall.  To my surprise, he asked me to hold him, he was</B>
<P><B>scared, he was dreaming with his Mom.  I told him he wasn't dreaming
she</B>
<P><B>must be here, someone walked be me, and answered me in  your voice
from</B>
<P><B>the bathroom - we better pray for her.  I went to the sofabed, picked
my</B>
<P><B>daughter up - and she slept with us that night.  But I'll never
forget</B>
<P><B>how scared Tim was - and he wanted me to protect him??  I told him,
she</B>
<P><B>his Mother, not to be afraid.  He was - he held to me, like a child.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	I moved out of that apartment when I separated with Tim, and I left
the</B>
<P><B>place to my Uncle.  At a family gathering, my Uncle told everyone my</B>
<P><B>apartment was spooked.  He felt someone get out of the bed - and use
the</B>
<P><B>bathroom.  He said he remembered hearing someone urinating too - He</B>
<P><B>continued saying "If that Mother F***** comes back to this bed, I'm</B>
<P><B>outta here!!"  I laughed, and assured him, it must his Dad checking
up</B>
<P><B>on him.  He wasn't tolerating it.  I saw it in his face, it scared
him. </B>
<P><B>But because no one came back to the bed, he fell asleep.</B>

<H3><A NAME=sale>House For Sale</A>
</H3><P><B>by lumbee13@worldnet.att.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>My family and I moved to a small town and purchased a home that was
way below market value. I remember when my father and I first met with the
realtor to view the house, as I walked through the it I had this strange
feeling. I was fourteen at the time (now 22) and I still can't explain the
feeling. I wasn't uncomfortable or anything; it was just this feeling. My
father purchased the house and we called it home for the longest 4 years
of my life.</B>
<P><B>The first thing we noticed was the strange reaction from the people
in town towards us. We  received alot of stares, and  questions about the
house. We just shrugged if off, and decided it was a small town (very small),
and that people were interested in the new folks from the big city. As we
soon learned, it was much more than typical curiosity.</B>
<P><B>The first experience was coming home to the front door standing wide
open. We never left without locking the doors, and this doors were solid
heavy wood. My mother and assumed that someone had tried to break into the
house, which was not the case. The open front door began to happen more
frequently; it occurred about once a month. After a while the typical excuses
just wouldn't suffice.</B>
<P><B>My father always laughed at us, he didn't believe us when we told him
about the door standing wide open. I think I ghost wanted  very much to prove
its existence to my father. The person who lived there prior to us had made
a wind thingy ( whenever it turned you new that there was a going to be a
serious storm) it was made out of a heavy type metal and circular. My father
told us about it ; he had discovered accidentally. He said that if that thing
ever turned, we needed to get in the basement quick.</B>
<P><B>My father was planting a small garden in the back yard when he heard
a whistling sound. The wind thingy was spinning at top speed. The only problem
was that there was no wind that day. My father never laughed at us again.</B>
<P><B>It seemed that the incidences occurred more often during the summer
time. I remember one night I awoke and heard my grandmother and mother talking
on the front porch. The strange thing about was that my grandmother wasn't
there when I went to sleep and it was now about 3 in the morning. I assumed
something must be wrong (death, illness in the family). I laid there for
a few moments, I listened as the talked. I heard the chairs moving across
the porch (like they were moving them) I also heard them giggling. I got
up and decided to join them. When I went out there was no one there and my
mother was sound asleep. I was unable to finish my sleep.</B>
<P><B>There were a ton of different things that occurred in this house but
I want to concentrate on the big things. </B>
<P><B>We had a rottweiler who would sit , stare, bark, and growl at the corner
near the front door. This section of the house disturbed him greatly. Because
of all the other incidences that had occurred, we began to investigate the
history of the house. We went to the local newspaper and found out that 8
years prior to our arrival, a man had been brutally murdered in the house.
From there we went to the police department and looked through the police
report. We were extremely disturbed to find out that his body was placed
in a rocking chair near the front door. It seemed to us that after we discovered
the information and discussed it in the house, the incidences became more
frequent and more disturbing. The last major event that occurred happened
to my father. </B>
<P><B>He was home alone as my mother and I had spent the weekend with
relatives.</B>
<P><B>He said it was approximately 4 in the morning, and he awoke to sound
of the back door being opened; it sweaked loudly. He assumed that it was
my mother and I , and called to us. He didn't receive a reply so he became
concerned. He said that heard footsteps walking through kitchen and coming
down the hallway. Dad reached for the 22. in the bedstand, and stood armed
at his bedroom door. The footsteps stopped at his door. Dad said the hardest
part was opening the door to confront the "intruder".</B>
<P><B>When my father finally did get the nerve to open the door, there was
no one there. He said he searched the entire, and the only oddity was that
the back door was  standing wide open. Approximately 2 days later my father
put the house up for sale. My experience with this was not  house enjoyable,
but I now have a respect for the supernatural and unseen.</B>

<H3><A NAME=air>The Sighting By The Air Conditioner</A>
</H3><P><B>by hutto@meta3.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>This really happened to us:(About 20 odd years ago)</B>
<P><B>We received a phone call from my wife's mother from her home about
200 miles north of us, that my wife's father was not expected to live.  I
owned and operated a drugstore and was not able to leave just then, so my
mother took my wife up to see him. They returned late that night, as he had
not died yet, but 30 minutes after they got back , we received a phone call
saying he had passed away. Being real late at night, we were preparing to
go the next morning. I was out front packing baggage in the Auto and all
of my children were out on the front stoop talking. Naturally, everyone was
shocked and upset.I looked up and saw a person under the airconditioner down
the hill towards the back of the house.Being in a daze because of the death,
I saw the person, but it did not register with me. The person had light blond
hair similar to my wife and hypnotically, I supposed it was her. I continued
to pack the car, and asked my daughter and the other children if they had
seen anything. She said she had. I came to my senses and realized that the
figure was a giant child with bangs  the color of my wife's hair. I called
my daughter to come and tell me what she had seen. What she saw was the same
thing I had seen, only she was closer. She said she could see through the
person. The figure was gone, but indelibly impressed on my mind. When I saw
it, it was looking down at something in it's hands. I went down the steps
to the air conditioner and realized that the person was eight feet tall or
more , with soft skin like a baby.To this day, I cannot tell you what it
was .  In the beginning, I thought it was my wife further out in the yard,
but when I thought, I realized it was not.</B>

<P>
<P><B>hi. i'm a 16 yr old girl from columbus ga and i have a few stories.
my folks</B>
<P><B>and i have lived in my house for 12 years and we've had some pretty
weird</B>
<P><B>happenings. i mean, it's not like anybody has ever died here or anything
like</B>
<P><B>that, but this neighborhood was a dumpyard before houses were built
here. the</B>
<P><B>only thing we can figure is that maybe a body was dumped here. anyways,
ever</B>
<P><B>since we moved in weird things have happened. they happened to my mom
first. i</B>
<P><B>thought she was krazy when she told me she saw somebody walking up
and down</B>
<P><B>our hall way and disregarded it to start with. it happened to her alot
and</B>
<P><B>nobody believed her. then i started hearing footsteps. then suddenly
the</B>
<P><B>activity stopped and we heard nothing more for a few years. when i
was about</B>
<P><B>12 i started staying home alone after school. one day i decided i'd
clean the</B>
<P><B>house for mom. i finished up and made sure our cabinet door was closed.
(it</B>
<P><B>has a "click lock so it can't possibly open itself). then i left and
went to</B>
<P><B>my friends house. when i came back the cabinet door was opened. so
i closed it</B>
<P><B>and fogot about it. then i came up front later in the afternoon and
it was</B>
<P><B>opened again. it really freaked me out. this went on for random
occasions</B>
<P><B>throughout the next year or so. then it stopped. that's when stuff
started</B>
<P><B>moving. things that were securily placed would continuously fall off
dressers</B>
<P><B>and when they were put back, they fell off again. things would be put
down in</B>
<P><B>a specific place and end up in a room that no one had been in all day.
this</B>
<P><B>year we've started actually feeling and hearing the ghost. when i'm
here alone</B>
<P><B>with my grandma and she''s asleep, it whispers my name and says hello.
my</B>
<P><B>grandma swears up and down she hears someone singing and playing
music</B>
<P><B>(possibly our piano) when she's here alone. we can feel the ghost with
us when</B>
<P><B>we're in a dark room alone or when we're frightened or upset. and it
oten</B>
<P><B>makes the lights flicker and rooms get chilly. this may all be paranoia,
but</B>
<P><B>my whole family is freaked out by the incident and i thought it might
be of</B>
<P><B>interest to you. the ghost has never actually harmed us. it's more
like a</B>
<P><B>friendly polterguist or something.thanks for reading my story and i'd
really</B>
<P><B>like to hear back from you. thanks again. </B>

</H3><P><B>by ?@moravian.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>i'm 20 years old, a junior in college.  there is a north and south</B>
<P><B>campus to my college.  south campus is in a historic section of a
town.</B>
<P><B>the girls' dorm dates to around the 1850's, and is supposed to be</B>
<P><B>haunted.  right next door is the music center.  the music center was</B>
<P><B>originally the "single brethren's house," housing bachelors of the</B>
<P><B>moravian order.  (the moravian order is a religious order from
germany</B>
<P><B>and czechoslovokia)  during the civil war, the single brethren's
house</B>
<P><B>was used as a hospital for the soldiers, and so is supposed to be</B>
<P><B>haunted.  last year i was in a practice room on the second floor of
the</B>
<P><B>building.  i had stopped for a minute, and was looking at the music,</B>
<P><B>when i heard someone in the room clear their throat, but i was the
only</B>
<P><B>one in the room.  needless to say, that was the end of practicing for
me</B>
<P><B>that night.  </B>
<P><B>        i lived in the dorm next door for the first two years of
school</B>
<P><B>here.  there are a ton of stories.  at one point, and i don't even
know</B>
<P><B>how long ago, there was a walk way connecting that dorm---main</B>
<P><B>hall---and the music center.  supposedly, a little girl fell out of
a</B>
<P><B>window in the walkway and was killed.  some people have seen her
ghost</B>
<P><B>in the back stairwell of main hall.  there is a mirror hanging in one
of</B>
<P><B>the lounges on the first floor, that is very old.  the story goes
that</B>
<P><B>if you and your sweetheart look into the mirror together and see</B>
<P><B>yourselves as an old couple, or see an old couple behind you, that
means</B>
<P><B>you are going to get married.  there  is also an old room, that is</B>
<P><B>always locked, called the zoo room.  it's called that because there
is a</B>
<P><B>forest scene painted on all of the walls, that is the oldest mural
in</B>
<P><B>the state.  lights go on and off by themselves in the room. a few
years</B>
<P><B>ago, around halloween, a light went on in the room, but the door was</B>
<P><B>locked.  one of the cleaning women had a key and tried to unlock the</B>
<P><B>door to turn the light off, but the door wouldn't open.  she called</B>
<P><B>campus security, and they came and tried to unlock the door, but they</B>
<P><B>couldn't get it open, either.  a few days after halloween, the light</B>
<P><B>wwent  off, and the door unlocked.  it turns out that the dead bolt,</B>
<P><B>inside the room, dead bolted itself somehow.  during my first week
in</B>
<P><B>college, i was cold one night, trying to sleep, but was too tired to</B>
<P><B>move.  i woke up the next morning to find my other blanket on the
bed,</B>
<P><B>arranged perfectly, when i know i didn't get up.</B>

<H3><A NAME=war>War and Rememberance</A>
</H3><P><B>by jake42069@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have only experienced two, what I consider ghost encounters in my</B>
<P><B>whole life.  I have previously wrote about my first ordeal and now
I</B>
<P><B>want to tell my second.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My grandfather was a decorated soldier who fought the Germans during</B>
<P><B>World War II.  He has a number of artifacts that he brought back with</B>
<P><B>him.  One of those artifacts is an old bayonet.  He told me it was</B>
<P><B>taken from a battlefield.  I am a military enthusiest and I couldn't</B>
<P><B>help taking a sneak peak at the bayonet when nobody was looking as
it</B>
<P><B>was off limits.  I took the bayonet out of it's holster and noticed
a</B>
<P><B>dark stain on it.  I wondered if it could be blood.  Then as I</B>
<P><B>pondered this I had a feeling.  It's that feeling that we all have</B>
<P><B>experienced at one time or another.  It's the feeling of somebody</B>
<P><B>watching you.  I looked back through a window in the room I saw a</B>
<P><B>figure standing outside.  It was a boy in uniform.  He looked so</B>
<P><B>young.  He had blond hair and a blank stare.  I was scared.  I
thought</B>
<P><B>a stranger was outside staring at me.  I looked away for a second and</B>
<P><B>when I looked back he was gone.  Only then did I notice the uniform.
</B>
<P><B>It looked like the ones the Nazis had.  I wonder if my experience had</B>
<P><B>anything to do with the bayonet with the stain.  I probably will
never</B>
<P><B>know.  I have since looked at the bayonet many times and have not</B>
<P><B>experienced anything like I did before.</B>

</H3><P><B>by jnielsen@inreach.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have always been interested in the unexplained since I was 19 years
old. It all happened after my grandfather's death in Mossman, Far North
Queensland. &nbsp;Australia. &nbsp;I remember sitting on his bed one day
when I was 11 years old. It was a hot, humid afternoon and he began to tell
me about his youth and he told me he &nbsp;was bitten by a brown snake and
that his soul left his body and below him, he could see everyone kneeling
beside his body crying and then suddenly he saw a bright light and suddenly
he found himself outside a gate but he could not enter as it was not his
time...so he went back to his body and I kind of looked at him as if to say:
"Yeah, sure!!!", because I just found it hard to swallow somehow. &nbsp;I
think that he realised that I did not believe him and he said to me that
when his time is up on this earth, he will come and say "goodbye" to me the
next time. &nbsp;Several years passed and I grew up and I moved to Cairns
which was about 59 kms from Mossman where my grandfather lived..I had no
telephone at my flat. &nbsp;Anyhow, I was sitting on my bed in my flat
(apartment) and the strangest thing happened..I was reading a book at the
time and when I lifted my head and I saw my grandfather sitting on the bed
beside me. &nbsp; He had a calm, peaceful expression on his face  and he
told me that he had come to say;"goodbye" to me and then he told me to take
care of myself. &nbsp;He sat with me for a period of what seemed like 5 minutes
then he was gone. &nbsp;Five days later I went to Mossman and I saw my
grandmother and she was crying..she told me that my grandfather had died
and that they had buried him a week ago..but I was'nt shocked as he had already
said "goodbye" to me. &nbsp;I told her what had happened and she said; "Yes,
you have always his favorite grand-daughter.</B><HR>

<P>
<P><B>First you need to know that I'm writing you from Germany.  It's up
to you to</B>
<P><B>believe these stories.  All I can say is that I have witnesses that
can</B>
<P><B>vouch this stories to be true.  This is going to be long so please
bare with</B>
<P><B>me.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was in High School, I was really interested in the paranormal.
 I</B>
<P><B>read everything about reincarnation, ghosts, etc.  A friend of mine
told me</B>
<P><B>one time that she does seances by herself.  All she uses was a plain
big</B>
<P><B>white sheet of paper with the alphabet, numbers 0-9, "yes" and "no"
written</B>
<P><B>on it as a Ouija board.  And of course a small glass turned upside
down.  I</B>
<P><B>asked her if she would let me in on one of her seances, out of
curiosity.</B>
<P><B>No problem.  A couple of friends and I visited her then and started.
 One</B>
<P><B>thing I had to mention was, one of my classmates is a Persian from
Iran and</B>
<P><B>his name is Alexander.  My friend told me that she always talked to
the same</B>
<P><B>spirit.  His name was "Y" (pronounced epsilon, the German version of
the</B>
<P><B>letter y).  She said he's a flirt and would write something like
"you're</B>
<P><B>cute" or something like that.  Sounded like a lot of fun to me.  When
we</B>
<P><B>were having our s&eacute;ance, we had a spirit that was so much different
from my</B>
<P><B>friends spirit.  So she said.  She was asking if there is anybody in
the</B>
<P><B>room besides her that is a medium.  And the spirit wrote my name. 
The glass</B>
<P><B>was moving slow.  My friend assumed that this spirit doesn't really
want to</B>
<P><B>communicate due to some reasons.  She asked if there is anybody in
the room</B>
<P><B>that he doesn't like.  He replied "yes".  We asked for the name and
he wrote</B>
<P><B>"ALEX".  We asked why and he responded "he is Persian".  Back then
I should</B>
<P><B>have left it alone.  I knew this spirit was a racist and there is always
a</B>
<P><B>possibility that you will get the same ghost again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, I got caught up on it.  I would have seances at home as well.
 Once I</B>
<P><B>knew I was a medium nothing was able to stop me.  The funny thing though
is,</B>
<P><B>I was weak.  I was just half.  I needed another half to get a spirit
to</B>
<P><B>communicate with us.  And I was never able to do it by myself, not
like my</B>
<P><B>friend.  Most of the time I would ask my Mom to sit in until I get
a spirit</B>
<P><B>and then she would leave the room.  Back then my brother was dating
a girl</B>
<P><B>who was half a medium like I was.  I was tired that one evening she
wanted</B>
<P><B>to have a s&eacute;ance.  She insisted.  So I sat down with her and
tried to get a</B>
<P><B>spirit and sure got someone.  It turned out to be the racist though.
 He was</B>
<P><B>weak and the glass was barely moving.  He was barely answering our</B>
<P><B>questions.  I asked if everything is all right and he answered NO.
 I asked</B>
<P><B>if there is somebody holding him back and he said YES.  I asked who.
 He</B>
<P><B>wrote "DEMON".  I got scared and told him that I'd rather not bother
him no</B>
<P><B>more and that I would like to say goodbye.  He wrote "CHICKEN" and
left.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That's when I gained respect for it.  I realized that one should not
be</B>
<P><B>playing around with something unexplainable and without certain
respect....</B>
<P><B>Better to leave it alone.  They use to say that you have to say goodbye
to</B>
<P><B>the spirit and the spirit has to say goodbye to you as well.  Otherwise,
bad</B>
<P><B>things can happen since the spirit never leaves the house.  I stopped
doing</B>
<P><B>it for years until summer of 1992.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A friend, my brother and I went to south France to visit some friends.
 One</B>
<P><B>evening during one of our gatherings people grew bored and came to
the idea</B>
<P><B>to have a s&eacute;ance just out of fun.  I was against it and I didn't
want any</B>
<P><B>part of it.  So they were sitting there trying to get a ghost (in
French</B>
<P><B>mind you).  When they finally had somebody they were told the
constellation</B>
<P><B>was bad.  They didn't listen.  They asked me if I could try to get
"Y" for</B>
<P><B>them, I did.  I was not sure though if it really was him so I bid my</B>
<P><B>good-byes and took my finger off the glass.  I just let them do and
just</B>
<P><B>watched them.  They got a spirit later on at about 21:00.  They were</B>
<P><B>communicating all right in the beginning.  Suddenly the spirit started
to</B>
<P><B>use abusive language towards one of the girls that was participating.
 We</B>
<P><B>didn't quite understand what was happening and he was really insulting.
 The</B>
<P><B>ghost was saying something to the fact that the girl was bad towards
her</B>
<P><B>mother.  They tried to say goodbye to the spirit and the spirit won't
leave.</B>
<P><B>It kept saying "NO".  One after the other he aloud them to take their
finger</B>
<P><B>off the glass.  At the end there were only 2 people left and the spirit
will</B>
<P><B>not leave.  I was sitting in the corner trembling like an aspen leaf,
scared</B>
<P><B>to death.  In the meantime it's 05:00 in the morning and the spirit
has not</B>
<P><B>left.  </B>
<P><B>At the end one of the guys took a piece of paper, shoved it under the
glass,</B>
<P><B>shook the glass and threw it out of the window.  All of us in that
room</B>
<P><B>heard it land on the street with a clashing sound.  We all separated
and ran</B>
<P><B>home.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next morning during the day, we went back to that house.  We were
told</B>
<P><B>the following:  That night the dog slept on the bed where the girl
was</B>
<P><B>sleeping (the one the spirit was mad about), directly on her legs,
seemed</B>
<P><B>like for protection, and the dog has never done this before.</B>
<P><B>There was a cow bell outside sitting directly in the middle of the
window</B>
<P><B>sill of the kitchen window that rolled down by itself with a loud bang.
 It</B>
<P><B>was sitting there for years.</B>
<P><B>When we looked at the rose bushes, there was the glass hanging upside
down</B>
<P><B>in the bushes and the roses around it were dead.</B>
<P>
<P><B>So, whoever read this, if you are just planning to play with an Ouija
board</B>
<P><B>and you have no respect towards the unknown, then better keep your
fingers</B>
<P><B>off of it.</B>

<H3><A NAME=apartments>My Families Apartments</A>
</H3><P><B>by jarrick@bmd.clis.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This didn't happen to me, but to one of my Aunts and her husband. 
This happened approximately over 40 years ago in Salem, Mass.  My Aunt and
Uncle moved with their infant daughter into a house in Salem that had been
divided into 2 apartments.  When you entered the front door there was a door
to the basement directly in front of you (this door was padlocked shut),
their apartment door to the left and their neighbors to the right.  Everything
began with a knocking sound coming from under the floor in their bedroom.
 This continued until my Uncle became so annoyed that he broke the lock on
the basement door determined to find out what was causing the noise.  When
he opened the door, the stairway leading down to the basement was full of
cobwebs....all undisturbed.  No one could have been down there without leaving
a trace.  Next the gas knobs on the stove would turn on by themselves.  My
Aunt would smell gas, find the knobs turned on, turn them off and then a
while later find them all on again.  Another time my Uncle was lying in bed
and he felt someone lie down on the bed next to him.  He thought it was my
Aunt, but when he opened his eyes, there was no one there.  There was, however,
an indentation on the bed as if a body was lying next to him.  He then felt
whatever it was, get up and he watched as the indentations disappeared on
the bed.  I personally would have been out of there long before this, but
what happened next was the final blow for them.  My Uncle was at work and
my Aunt was doing laundry.  My cousin was an infant at the time and in a
bassinet.  My Aunt locked the front door, moved the baby's bassinet close
to an open window so she would hear the baby while outside hanging the laundry
out to dry in the back yard.  She left the back door unlocked.  While hanging
clothes, she heard the baby cry and went to go inside to check on her.  The
back door was now locked.  She looked thru the window and saw that the baby
was no longer next to the window, but the bassinet had been moved.  It was
now in the entrance way to the building, next to the basement door which
was now open.  She ran to the front door and tried to get in and couldn't.
 She went to a neighbors house and received help at the same time that my
Uncle was coming home for lunch.  The baby was fine, but they were not staying
in the house for another minute.  They moved out that night and came back
the next day for their belongings.  When they moved into a new apartment,
my Aunt was talking with one of her new neighbors one day and they were
discussing places they'd lived.  My Aunt mentioned to the new neighbor that
she wouldn't believe what they had just gone thru in their previous apartment
and proceeded to tell her about their experiences.  The neighbor listened
to her story and then looked straight at her and said, "Of course I believe
you.  We moved out of the same apartment months ago."  </B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>Another Aunt and Uncle, also in Salem, Mass; lived in a building that
had several small apartments in it.  Strange things happened to them from
the moment they moved in, but nothing that really bothered them much.  A
calendar and pictures would be turned around facing the wall when they would
return home.  Then one evening my Uncle awoke to see a man sitting in the
chair next to his side of the bed.  He was about to yell at the intruder,
when he noticed that he could see the street light from outside shining thru
the man.  He said that the man was dressed in old clothing and wore a stovepipe
hat.  He could see every feature of the man's face.  He closed his eyes and
when he looked again the man was gone.  The next morning he asked my Aunt
if she had seen anything and she hadn't.  She asked what he had seen and
he told her about the man.  She wrote it off as a dream.  My Uncle saw the
man a few more times and then one day while talking to their landlord he
found out that the place had once been a pencil factory and had belonged
to the landlords family.  He showed my Uncle a picture of the factory with
it's employees all standing outside and there in the picture was the man
that my Uncle had seen sitting in the chair next to him.  He asked his landlord
if he knew who the man in the stovepipe hat in the picture was and the landlord
told him that that was his ancestor who had owned the factory.</B>

<H3><A NAME=forget>Experiences I'll Never Forget    </A>
</H3><P><B>by Playdohmom@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was about seven years of age, my parents were at the height
of</B>
<P><B>separating themselves from each other, not a separation where one lived
away</B>
<P><B>from the other, but to the point that my mother was sleeping in my
younger</B>
<P><B>brother's room, which used to be my father's office until he came along,
which</B>
<P><B>was located right off the front doors of the house we had in Los
Altos,</B>
<P><B>California.  I got up in the middle of the night and went to look for
my</B>
<P><B>mother.  I left my room and entered the first hallway as I came to
the next</B>
<P><B>hallway to turn left down to reach my brother's room I stopped as I
saw my</B>
<P><B>mother turn into the hall from the main entry of the house.  I noticed
that</B>
<P><B>she seemed to be blowing her nose and it appeared to be that she had
been</B>
<P><B>crying.  I called out to her and she just kept coming at me without</B>
<P><B>acknowledging my presence.  I called out to her a second and third
time and</B>
<P><B>she just kept coming toward me, wiping her nose with a tissue.  I
then</B>
<P><B>realized that I could see right through her to the farthest end of
the hall</B>
<P><B>where the 1/2 bathroom was located.  I realized that I could see a
light</B>
<P><B>coming in through that window from the moon, or something that was
very weak</B>
<P><B>but apparent.  I then felt that this apparition was threatening and
was coming</B>
<P><B>at me in the guise of my mother's form so I ran to my room and closed
the</B>
<P><B>door.  I then jumped into bed and pulled all the blankets well over
me and my</B>
<P><B>head so that I could not see it if it entered my room.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In this same house, we had a family room that had a pocket door separating
it</B>
<P><B>from the long main hall of the house.  At night, something would cause
the</B>
<P><B>metal "tongue" that you use to pull the pocket door closed when it
was opened</B>
<P><B>all the way into the wall to flick up and down.  It would make all
of us kids'</B>
<P><B>hair stand on end, there was five of us.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Every night, while we lived at this house, I would have bad dreams.
 I would</B>
<P><B>dream vivid horrible nightmares that would cause me to run to my parents
room</B>
<P><B>and insist that my parents let me sleep in their bed.  I dreampt of
knifes and</B>
<P><B>daggers shooting out of the T.V. set in the family room, hands (just
hands)</B>
<P><B>coming out from under my bed, and dreadful things of this nature. 
The only</B>
<P><B>rooms in the house that seemed to have no activity within them were
the living</B>
<P><B>room and formal dining room.  Everything seemed to happen in the main
hall,</B>
<P><B>the hall to the laundry room, the family room and the children's
bathroom.</B>
<P><B>One day, while I was in the living room, at the age of 5, I said to
my mother</B>
<P><B>that I needed a friend while my best friend, Carol, was at kindergarten
class.</B>
<P><B>I had the morning class and she had the afternoon class.  The next
day, I had</B>
<P><B>kittens surrounding me when I woke up in the morning.  They were all
playing</B>
<P><B>at the side of my bed, seemingly waiting for me to wake up.  I brought
them</B>
<P><B>down the hall, turning every step of the way, clapping my hands while
bent</B>
<P><B>over calling "here kitties, let's go see my mommy".  They were with
me for</B>
<P><B>weeks until summer came, I could see them and hear them, but no one
else</B>
<P><B>seemed to.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night, in this same house, my older brother woke up, feeling very
sick to</B>
<P><B>his stomach.  For some strange reason, he felt that if he went to take
a bath</B>
<P><B>that he would feel better.  When he went into the bathroom, he noticed
that</B>
<P><B>several light bulbs in the fixture across the top of the mirror were
burned</B>
<P><B>out.  He went down the bedroom hall, entered the main hall and felt,
at this</B>
<P><B>point, as if someone were following him.  He then turned down the hall
to the</B>
<P><B>laundry room and got some light bulbs out of the long closet across
from the</B>
<P><B>laundry room door.  He then felt something touch his back as he was
bent over</B>
<P><B>which made him jump up.  When he turned around, there was nothing there.
 He</B>
<P><B>then proceeded back to the bathroom and, while he was on the sink counter,
he</B>
<P><B>heard a woman laughing.  He suddenly became real spooked and went back
to bed.</B>
<P><B>That same night, my mother awoke sick and got up to open her bedroom
sliding</B>
<P><B>glass door to let some air in.  After opening the door, she suddenly
felt</B>
<P><B>better and went back to bed.  My Grandmother, my mother's mother, had
passed</B>
<P><B>away that night at approximately the same time that my brother and
mother</B>
<P><B>awoke feeling sick.</B>
<P>
<P><B>All types of strange things happened at this house, we all just knew
it was</B>
<P><B>haunted but we did not know what it could be since my father built
the house</B>
<P><B>when I was two years old on a large parcel of what used to be an
apricot</B>
<P><B>orchard.  At that time, we were all too young to search the county
records to</B>
<P><B>determine if anyone or building had any type of historical record with
this</B>
<P><B>particular property.  I now live so far away, we moved when I was 12,
that it</B>
<P><B>is not possible to look this information up to find out just why we
had those</B>
<P><B>strange experiences.</B>
