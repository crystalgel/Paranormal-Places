<big>The Little Girl in My Bedroom.<br>
<br>
By: lilizzy27@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
I remember when I was younger, I met a young female ghost in my room. I
was ten years old, and in a foster home at the time. I remember I had
come home from school, and heard a heavy breathing coming from the
corner of the room, I was laying down on my stomach coloring when the
breathing started. I looked around and saw nothing, I even held my own
breath to see if I was the one that was breathing so hard, but of
course it wasn't me. I got up to see if it was my younger sister trying
to scare me, and I found no one. I started to worry, and I didnt know
what was going on, I thought I was going crazy. I closed my closet
door, which happened to be a mirror, and I clapped my hand over my
mouth to stop myself from screaming my head off. there in the
reflection of the mirror, was a little girl in a white church dress, I
could tell she had been crying because her face was awash with tears,
and her eyes were blood shot. she had her hands behind her back, but
then she pointed at me. I wanted to scream at that moment, but instead
I fainted. when I woke up, I had a blanket over me, and it was dark. my
foster mom came in with a platter of the dinner she had made. "come on
honey, you have to eat before you go back to bed." she told me, I was
wild eyed, I knew I was because she was staring at me funny, she told
me that I looked scared, and in fact I was. I asked her if she had gone
to church with her little girls, and if they were crying for some
reason. she replied no, saying that they hadnt gone to church that day,
which scared me even more. now I knew that it wasnt my little foster
sisters in my room, but a ghost. I never told my foster mom or anyone
else about what happened in the room, I thought they would shun me, and
send me to an insane asylum, I hardly knew them but I still had
thoughts like that. the only person that I confided in was my Grandma,
who I called Nana, for as long as I can remember. she died on July 16,
this year. I miss her so much. I remember that she told me, that the
ghosts wouldnt hurt me, especially a little girl. she told me she
probably didnt want to die, and needed help to rest in peace. that
eased my fear of seeing another ghost, only a little. when she died, I
thought I might see her one more time, but she hasnt appeared before me
yet. I dream about her alot, and miss her with all my heart. I never
saw that little girl again, but I hope she can rest in peace, along
with my nana.<br>

The Old Biker Man <br>
<br>
By: blackflame3883@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
In my old home, we had several ghosts. One was a young boy (blond hair,
about 14 years old) who loved to pull the shower curtain back and watch
you take your shower. Another was my favorite. He was an old biker who
stood 6'2" and had multiple gun-shot wounds to his chest and abdomen.
He seemed pretty harmless, but loved to joke with people. <br>
One night (September 2007) he decided to make a believer out of my
brother. He had told me his story the night after it had happened, and
I just smiled and laughed. <br>
He said that he was just lying in bed and had just put out a cigarette.
He started hearing tapping on the window and his closet door, so he
tried to ignore it. Then, he had heard rustling of papers or something
to his right. He started to get freaked out and flipped the light
switch on. (I do believe at this point that he turned whiter than the
biker man himself) To his suprise, there was a piece of tin foil, once
crumpled into a ball, now floating in mid air unfolded completely. He
then turned off the light and everything stopped for a few minutes. All
of a sudden, there was noises coming from the living room that sounded
like someone was running into stuff in the dark. He went, looked, and
nothing was there. He checked on everyone in the house and all was dead
asleep.<br>
Needless to say, he slept in my mom's room!<br>

Calculating Ghost<br>
<br>
By: LAXDispatch@amadotrucking.com<br>
<br>
This happened about a year ago.&nbsp; I've lived in the same house for
13 years and my son and I knew there was a presence there because we
could feel it.&nbsp; We called it Pierpont.&nbsp; Well anyway a year
ago I was ordering food from a company that supplies&nbsp; food for 6
months at a time.&nbsp; The represntative came in and we were figuring
the order when suddenly his calculator begain to add on it's own.&nbsp;
The man said what is going on and I said oh it's the house.&nbsp; Once
I said that it stopped.&nbsp; Then about 20 minutes later when we were
finishing up it begain to do it again and he looked at me and I told
him to tell Pierpont to stop it.&nbsp; He did and it stopped.&nbsp;
Well it turns out that in 1965 there was a German lady who lived in the
house and she killed herself. We were told from 1965 to 1967 they had
11 different families live in the house and all moved out rather
suddenly.&nbsp; I would here whispers late at night, you couldn't
understand what they were saying but one was female and one was
male.&nbsp; If you walked into the living room it would stop.&nbsp; I
told my boyfriend about the voices and he said well the lady is Mable
and we're guessing the male is Pierpont.&nbsp; Things will still
disappear and show up some where else but&nbsp; the whispering stopped
right after we got our little puppy.&nbsp; The animals will sit up or
stair at place that as far as we can see no one is there.&nbsp; They
don't seem to bother us and I feel very safe.<br>

Ghost Cat<br>
<br>
By: eileen@aplusgroup.net<br>
<br>
For some of my family we have the ability to see and hear ghosts, I&#8217;m
part of this group.&nbsp; While I was growing up I would remember my
grandmother having conversations with relatives that were not
there.&nbsp; She would tell me that her sister, brother, or other
relative had just passed on and that they came by to tell her (most all
of my relatives live in Germany) and sure enough the next day she would
receive a phone call from someone telling her and so and so had passed
away.&nbsp; During my time growing up my grandmother and great uncle
would watch me after school and I had a close attachment to both of
them.&nbsp; My grandmother would always take all of the stray animals
in, especially cats.&nbsp; She had a special way with them and would
sit and have conversations with them.&nbsp; Many people do not
understand that some people can hear what an animal is saying; my
grandmother was one of those people with that special gift.&nbsp; I am
no different, not only do I sense and talk to spirits but I have a
special connection to animals, especially cats.&nbsp; My husband and I
often find ourselves with a stray or hurt animal at our door
step.&nbsp; We have always taken them in and either found home for them
or have made their last memories one of love and comfort.&nbsp; For
some time we have noticed what I call shadow cats around our
house.&nbsp; These cats often will have a smoke like appearance and
will often just disappear in front of us.&nbsp; We have two cats of our
own which are both black and they do not disappear.&nbsp; One night as
I was sitting on our back porch I looked down to find a rather large
black cat looking at me.&nbsp; I would have noticed this cat if it had
walked up my driveway.&nbsp; The face of this cat is like no other cat
I have seen and the eyes were a solid black color.&nbsp; To say this
cat was black is like saying your tires are black.&nbsp; It was if you
could put your had through the cat and actually feel it, like running
your hands through some sort of rich liquid.&nbsp; It looked at me
meowed once, turned and walked down the driveway.&nbsp; I immediately
followed the cat when I reached the edge of the driveway this cat was
nowhere to be seen.&nbsp; I believe just as we look after the living
strays that come to us it seems we also have cat spirits that seem to
be drawn to us also.&nbsp; Once again we had a stray that wanted to be
reassured and noticed.<br>

Ghost of the Living Story<br>
<br>
By: SweetInsanity824@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I was reading the section "Ghosts of the living" and I wanted to share a story with you. <br>
My mother, some 7 years ago, had fallen asleep on the couch of our one
bedroom apartment. She woke up to see my grandfather, who was alive and
well some 1800 miles away, standing about 8 feet away. He smiled at her
and said, "Don't worry, everything is going to be okay." When she
blinked, he was gone.<br>
Naturally, my mother was a bit worried as to why she had just seen him,
but since it was well passed midnight decided not to call and wake my
grandparents up. When she finally called the next morning, my
grandfather told her that he had been thinking about her. <br>
I thought that was a wonderful story. And I'm happy to say that my grandfather and my mother are still alive and well.<br>

My Dream<br>
<br>
By: maroonmdness@yahoo.com]<br>
&nbsp;<br>
My husband and I bought a house and all seemed well. One night, maybe a
week after we moved in, I had this intense dream. In the dream I was in
an incompleted house and some man was yelling at me. I turned and saw
the man. He was tall, maybe 6 foot with a buzz cut, grey hair and
striking blue eyes. He was yelling at me saying he wanted his wife and
kids back. Then he screamed at me saying "GET OUT OF MY HOUSE". It was
so loud I literately woke up and jumped out of bed. I told our
neighbors about my dream and they said the man that lived there before
us fit that description. I shrugged it off as a coincidence. A week
after the dream I received his death certificate in the mail. He died
in our living room. My grandma advised me to go around the house and
thank the man for helping me to provide a home for my family. That was
the closest I've ever been, so far, to a supernatural experience. I
still think it could be coincidence.<br>

Paranormal Experience<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Ray.Morgan@aa.com <br>
<br>
I had an experience this summer that I wanted to share. My friend of 21
years committed suicide in July of 1990. I&#8217;ve always felt a resentment
that he called other of our friends before he took his life to say
goodbye, but he never called me. I would like to believe that it was
because he knew I would have talked him out of it. I only visited his
grave once shortly after he died. But this was someone that I grew up
with, was a neighbor to, and basically knew from birth. We were that
close.<br>
In July of this year, 17 years later, I was out on my motorcycle for a
drive and decided to drive up to the area he was buried. It was a
beautiful day. Temps were upper 80&#8217;s. Winds were dead calm. Because I
was coming from a different direction than I had been before, I kinda
got lost. After being on the road over an hour, I pulled over on the
side of the road and decided to have a cigarette. My zippo lighter
wouldn&#8217;t work. So I rode on. When I came to another town, I decided
again to try to have a cigarette. Same thing happened. My lighter
wouldn&#8217;t work. I was getting ticked that I left the house and never
realized to fill my lighter.<br>
I finally rode into the town my friend was buried and decided to go to
the cemetery. I knew exactly where he was buried after 17 years like I
had just been there the day before. I stopped my bike. Again, tried my
lighter and nothing. I tried to light my cigarette off my exhaust
headers hoping that it might work. I saw a guy on a bicycle ride into
the cemetery. Feeling stupid, I stood up and walked over to my friend&#8217;s
gravestone. I stayed there paying my respects. After I saw the guy on
the bike ride off, I again decided to have a smoke and wanted to see if
I could get my lighter to work. My lighter worked like I had just
filled it. I knew right away that there was something else involved.
After I finished the first smoke, I decided to have another one just in
case I had lighter problems again. Again, my lighter worked perfectly.
I thanked my friend for the smoke when I left and promised I would come
and see him more often.<br>
I tried my lighter 3 more times on the way home. Pulling over in
parking lots at restaurants or stores. My lighter wouldn&#8217;t work. I got
home and made sure I filled my lighter. The foam inside was dry. I
could tell it was out of fluid. <br>
I&#8217;ve had dreams of my friend and other experiences similar to that. I
once saw an apparition floating over my bed. It scared the bejesus out
of me. When I woke my wife up, it was gone. I brushed it off as coming
out of a sleep. But I&#8217;ve never had an experience like this in broad
daylight in the middle of the afternoon. I&#8217;ve always known my friend
was there looking out for me.<br>

Sharing a Ghost Cat Story<br>
<br>
By: srogers@bipinc.com <br>
<br>
I lived in Arlington VA in 1982-1984 in an old apartment building that
was built in the 1930&#8217;s.&nbsp; It was a warm friendly place large
rooms, hard wood floors and big sunny windows.&nbsp; I felt at home and
safe.&nbsp;&nbsp; One night I was in bed in that almost asleep mode and
I felt a cat jump up on the bed and walk up my legs to my hip then to
my shoulder.&nbsp; I was half asleep but I opened my eyes and looked
over my shoulder to see who&#8217;s cat got in to my apartment. My next door
neighbor had a cat&nbsp; and there were a few in the area.&nbsp; I
thought one slipped in when I came in and had been hiding till all was
quiet.&nbsp; WELL THERE WAS NOTHING THERE!&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t feel afraid
so I just rolled over and didn&#8217;t think much about it, but after that
every so often I would feel ghost kitty hop in to bed with me.&nbsp; I
did let it bother me.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t long after that I got my own cat,
Murphy.&nbsp;&nbsp; He slept with &#8220;US&#8221; and I think he didn&#8217;t mind his
other room mate.&nbsp; After getting to know another girl I worked with
we decided to get a larger apartment together so she moved in until a 2
bed room became available, like I said these apartments were very large
we had room for 2 full size beds, a dresser an night stands in the bed
room.&nbsp; After we moved in to the new apartment I said one night I
missed the old apartment and our ghost kitty.&nbsp; Her face got pail
and she asked &#8220;what do you mean, ghost kitty!&#8221;&nbsp; I told her about
&#8220;it&#8221; jumping in to bed with me.&nbsp; She started laughing them and
said &#8220;it jumped in to bed with her and she thought it was Murphy and
would reach down to pet him and he wouldn&#8217;t be there he would be in my
bed with me and she would think how did he get over there so
fast!&#8221;&nbsp; Well that&#8217;s my ghost kitty story!<br>

A Happy Experience<br>
<br>
By: Zay47@msn.com<br>
<br>
I just wanted to share an incident with you to see what your
perspective would be. I had an experience with a ghost that lives in
our camp area in Colorado.&nbsp; His name is Charlie, as they say. He
is a former resident of the area so I am told. We live in Tucson, AZ
and go there for the summers.<br>
We have a fifth wheel that we use when we go to Colorado.&nbsp; Our son
bought it for us at Blue Mesa Lake.&nbsp; We just love it there.&nbsp;
Well to make my story short. I was in the camper one morning and I had
hung a curtain with a hook rod over one of the windows.&nbsp; This
fastens at the top and the bottom of the window.&nbsp; A few minutes
later I heard a noise and went to check and the curtain rod fell off
the window from the top of the window.&nbsp; Thinking nothing about it
I hung the rod with the curtain back up.&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn't 5
minutes later the curtain noise happened again.&nbsp; I was working in
the kitchen at the time and went to check the noise.&nbsp; <br>
The curtain rod was off the window and on the floor but the curtain was
turned around.&nbsp; It was fed onto the rod backwards.&nbsp; I knew
that Charlie was supposed to be a friendly sort so I just talked to him
and said we just love it up here and want to enjoy our vacation if it
OK with you, Charlie.&nbsp; I re-hung the curtain and never had a
problem since. That was my encounter and a happy one.<br>

Ghost Stories<br>
<br>
By: ladyghost_21@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
My family has lived in a 100 year old house in Atkinson NE for close to
15 years and we've had several experiences.&nbsp; It's mostly smelling
cigarette smoke every once in awhile but none of us smoke and once my
mom and I were downstairs watching TV and we heard what we thought was
my sister call something down the stairs.&nbsp; We hadn't heard her
clearly so we called up and asked her to repeat herself.&nbsp; When she
didn't answer I went up to check and no one was up there and no radios
were on.&nbsp; A few minutes after I came back down she walked in the
front door, having just got back from the grocery store.&nbsp; <br>
Several years later when I was visiting from college I was sleeping in
my sister's old room because she had claimed mine, and I had the head
of my bed by the doorway (which my sister had never done).&nbsp; I woke
up around 2 a.m. and saw what I now think was a shadow person leaning
over me, just watching me.&nbsp; I was mostly asleep and just figured
that it was my brother, who sometimes sleepwalks, or another member of
my family coming to check on me and went back to sleep.&nbsp; The next
day I asked everybody about it and they said that they had all slept
through the night.&nbsp; I rearranged my room that day after my sister
told me about when she had had that room.&nbsp; She would hear
footsteps at night and breathing or coughing from by her desk which was
where my bed had been the previous night.<br>
She worked at the nursing home for several years and would bring home
stories of residents who called the nurses station complaining of a
person walking around the halls when everyone was in bed.&nbsp; Lights
will go on and off by themselves and faucets will come on.&nbsp; <br>
Later, when I moved into a trailer with a friend of mine we would hear
our names whispered or spoken but when we went to answer each other we
would discover that no one had called us.<br>
I work at the local Alco store in O'Neill Nebraska and we (the workers)
have always joked that it's haunted.&nbsp; There are a bunch of fake
trees on an overhead by the fabric that is nowhere near a vent but the
leaves will rustle and sway by themselves.&nbsp; At closing we have to
walk around to make sure everyone is out of the store and I know I
turned the bathroom lights off but the next time someone goes by they
will be on but no one had used the rooms.&nbsp; And last month I was
walking from the front desk to the clothing department to put returned
merchandise away when I saw what looked like an old man with either
white hair or a white hat come walking toward the service desk on the
other side of the check-out counters.&nbsp; I lost sight of him as I
past a magazine rack and something told me to look for him.&nbsp; When
I past the rack and looked back he was gone.&nbsp; I asked the girl at
the desk if she had seen anyone and she said that I was the only other
one up front at that time.&nbsp; Also, when I worked at the McDonald's
in O'Neill I would knock on the men's room door to see if it was empty
so I could clean it and every once in a while I would hear a man's
voice say "Just a minute."&nbsp; I would wait and wait and no one would
come out.&nbsp; I'd knock again or have one of the male workers check
it out and every time it would be empty.&nbsp; <br>
That's the extent of my personal experiences so far, hope you enjoyed, <br>

<br>
Im katelynn and I just moved to New Mexico from Maine. Well my friend
tiina asked me if I wanted to scare myself. I said yes. Well she took
me to the hanging tree in La Luz, It wasnt that scary although there
was rope still hanging from the branches. and all the cows were
gathered under it adn wouldnt leave. Which was creepy, anyways I was
bored with that and she told me about the brige where your site says a
mother and her kids haunt. But The story I herd was a school bus of
kids were washed away in a flash flood, well no shitting you it worked.
We sat in the car she turned off her lights and put it in nutral. And
no joke the fucking car was pushed up hill. I made her do it three
times because I didnt believe it, and on the third time the kids
slammed on the trunk of my car and we sped off. We went back later that
night and put flour on the tailgate, and there were TONS of tiny
handprints. I have pictures, and we are going again on halloween.<br>

Kellars Chapel - Jonesboro Arkansas<br>
<br>
By: Carrie.Adams@anheuser-busch.com<br>
<br>
Was just looking over your site, and wanted to comment on an experience
at Kellars Chapel as young adult.&nbsp; One night about 20 years ago,
but my husband (then boyfriend) and a couple of his cousins, visiting
from out of state, were driving through the cemetery (we were bored, it
was close to Halloween&#8230;).&nbsp; We noticed something reflecting on the
ground, even though our headlights were not pointing in that
direction.&nbsp; My husband rolled his window down to get a better
look, this was a manual window, by the time he got the window down,
whatever we had seen was gone.&nbsp; He went to roll the window back
up, and it would not work.&nbsp; He tried for a while to get it up but
couldn't.&nbsp; About this time, we were all getting pretty spooked and
decided to head home.&nbsp; On the way home, at a stop light,&nbsp; we
were all talking and not thinking about it, my husband, reached over to
roll the window up, and it rolled up just fine.&nbsp; We are now 37
years old, and neither of us have ever went back to Kellars Chapel.<br>

Spirit Visits - Had a Few<br>
<br>
<br>
By: theresakortas@sbcglobal.net<br>
<br>
Very interesting web site, 1st time viewing it and I can't wait to familiarize myself with it.<br>
I have had visists from the spirits in Detroit, Sterling Heights, Warren ,Washington,DC and in my dreams.<br>
My mother would always tell us about spirits that she encountered when
whe was a little girl growing up in Detroit.&nbsp; I wasn't much of a
believer back then but found her stories entertaining.<br>
My first spirit visit happened back in the 70s. I didn't do drugs back
then and still don't.&nbsp; I just moved into a little bungalow on
Teppert street in Detroit, right off 7 mile and Hoover.&nbsp; I got off
work around 10:00 p.m. that night and was ready to go to bed as soon as
I got home.&nbsp; I remember it so clearly,&nbsp; it was fall and the
night was chilly, I was all bundled up with my head under the
covers.&nbsp; Then I got this wierd sensation, like someone was
watching me.&nbsp; I laid very still and slowly peeked from under the
blanket, and there in my bedroom doorway stood a man.&nbsp; I was
petrified, my first thought was someone broke in to rob me, I thought
if I just lie still he'll grab my purse that was on the chair by the
door and leave.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the man didn't move and then I realized
I could see the hallway thru him.&nbsp; My mom always said to say a
prayer for the spirit, she said most are just lost souls, so being
raised Catholic I was well equipped. My fear was replaced by amazement,
I remember telling the spirit that I don't know who you who are or what
you want but may you rest in peace and perpertual light shine upon
you.&nbsp; By now I was sitting up in bed facing him.&nbsp; He was an
elderly tall slender man, grayish black thick hair, pin stripe suit and
wingtip shoes. And then he disappreared.&nbsp; I jumped out of bed,
checked the front door and the side door.&nbsp; Checked the
windows.&nbsp; I even sat down on bed trying to see if the lights from
the outside would cast that shawdow again.&nbsp; The next day, I was
working in the yard and saw my next door neighbor.&nbsp; I asked my
neighbor who lived here before me.&nbsp; He told me the owner and his
father.&nbsp;&nbsp; I described the spirit to him not telling him what
I saw the previous night.&nbsp; He replied, oh you found pictures of
his father.&nbsp; I told him no, then I asked what happened to
him.&nbsp; My neighbor explained that it was a very sad day, his son
came home and found his father dead in the back bedroom, he had a heart
attack.<br>
I stayed in the home, lite candles and sprinkled holy water while
praying for him.&nbsp; Never saw him again.&nbsp; My mom wanted me to
move out of the house, but I reminded her that she taught us not to
fear, to pray for the spirits and let them be.&nbsp; If they need
something more from us or they need to tell us something they will find
a way.<br>
And that was the begining of my many spirit visits.&nbsp; <br>

The Musical Ghost<br>
<br>
By: ohmycow@cafes.net<br>
<br>
At one time my husband, children and I lived outside a small town in
Eastern Oregon.&nbsp; We lived in a house that had been built around
1915.&nbsp; <br>
The house had a daylight basement that I think had been the servants'
quarters.&nbsp; It had the kitchen, a bathroom and laundry, pantry and
two bedrooms. Upstairs was a living room, enclosed porch, bathroom,
sitting room and two bedrooms.&nbsp; <br>
We lived in the basement area because the upstairs bedrooms weren't big
enough for our bed and we didn't want the children separated from
us.&nbsp; They liked one bedroom upstairs, but were afraid of the other.<br>
One day while I was home alone in the basement area and on the phone, I
heard the piano playing in the upstairs living room.&nbsp; We rented
this house and the landlord was bad to just come over and walk in the
house.&nbsp; I thought maybe he had come in through the screened
porch.&nbsp; I couldn't imagine him playing the piano, but somebody was
making music.&nbsp; <br>
So I told my mother in law to wait (on the phone) while I
investigated.&nbsp; This was before we had a cordless phone, so I had
to set the phone down.&nbsp; I went slowly up the stairs, hearing faint
music the whole time.&nbsp; At the top of the stairs was a door, which
I had closed because it was winter.&nbsp; I opened that and the music
was fainter.&nbsp; I went down the hallway to the living room door and
when I opened that door the music stopped.&nbsp; I wouldn't step into
the room.&nbsp; I was creeped out.&nbsp; But I looked in and didn't see
anyone.<br>
After that day, I heard the music over and over again.&nbsp; I almost
never heard it in the morning.&nbsp; Sometimes I would hear it while
cooking dinner and thought my daughter was playing the piano until I
saw her in the next room.&nbsp; <br>
If I heard the music, I usually went to investigate and over time it
didn't scare me so much.&nbsp; But the music stopped when I got to the
living room doorway, even if the door was open.&nbsp; I could never
make out the song, just that it sounded pretty and like something
formal, possibly classical.&nbsp; <br>
One day when the landlord was working on something in the attic, I came
up to talk to him. He had his back to me and I mentioned that I
sometimes thought I heard music.&nbsp; He was on a ladder and turned so
quickly he almost fell off.&nbsp; He looked so surprised and his eyes
were wide open.&nbsp; He said, "You too?"&nbsp; He then told me that
when his mother lived in the house she had a caregiver who wouldn't
stay because of the woman she saw playing the piano.&nbsp; <br>
I never saw the woman, but I did hear her.&nbsp; I was later told a
story that the house was originally built by a rich couple and the lady
was a pianist.<br>

Personal Experiences with the Unknown<br>
<br>
By: debredz2r@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I saw a story in the Detroit News on local tales of hauntings that
notes your website.&nbsp; I thought I would submit my own personal
experience in a house we were renting in Eastpointe, Michigan. We are
just outside of Detroit, Michigan.&nbsp; This involves myself, my
husband and my two children. We were renting a 3 bedroom house that was
built in the 50s. The history of the land prior to the house being
built is unknown to me. I asked a lifelong resident across the street
if anything unusual happened in the house, he had no recollection to
anyone dying, etc. in the house. Other neighbors said the previous
owners of the house kept to themselves, and basically made the garage
into a living room with couches, satellite tv, etc....so maybe they
were having problems too prior to moving out.&nbsp; The house was
sitting empty for at least 2 years before we moved in. <br>
I copied my my online blog diary so I didn't forget anything as it happened.&nbsp; <br>
From my blog:<br>
This may sound crazy and unbelievable to some, but this is not fiction,
this is something that is truly and honestly going on in our
house.&nbsp; I am keeping this as a record everytime something happens
that we cannot explain.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am seriously thinking of having a
conference with our pastor to come over and bless this house, hoping it
will go away.&nbsp; I only hope if we do, it doesn't somehow come back
worse with vengeance.&nbsp; I just saw that on cable the other night
where this family had their possessed house blessed, and it came back
after a month, worse than before!<br>
&nbsp; I firmly believe we have SOMETHING in our house.&nbsp; I can't
explain it, I never truly believed in ghosts and such, but after living
in this house, I think there is SOMETHING out there!&nbsp; We have been
living here since May, 2005, and didn't notice anything too obvious at
first.&nbsp; We would hear knocking at the door, only to find nobody
there.&nbsp; My daughter would hear the door actually open and close,
and it would be locked.&nbsp; We have a Fisher Price play phone, it is
in it's original box put away in the baby's closet, that rang by itself
one morning.&nbsp; Our internet was out Christmas Eve, which meant our
house phone didn't work because we have Vonage, the house phone rang
once also, we thought that the internet came back on, so we answered
the phone, it was blank, again, because the internet was out.&nbsp; On
top of all that, we hear a voice every once in a while.&nbsp; My
husband was walking down the hallway, nobody was home except for him
and the baby, I happened to be calling home, he heard a voice, couldn't
tell what it was saying though.&nbsp; On Jan 28, I heard that
voice...My husband and I were in the bathroom, he was in the shower, I
was doing my hair.&nbsp; When he was done, I could have swore he said,
"Who's there?"&nbsp; So I said, "What?"&nbsp; My husband never said a
word, he looked at me funny and said he didn't say anything.&nbsp; I
told him, "yea, you said who's there?"&nbsp; He insisted he didn't say
a word!&nbsp; Now, just yesterday, early in the morning(2/3/06), we
heard a crash in the bathroom.&nbsp; My husband went to check, assuming
it was one of the cats in the bathroom messing around because it was my
mirror and hair brushes that were knocked down off the shelf.&nbsp;
Nope, Angel was laying down with me, and Sylvester was laying down with
my daughter, so whatever it was, it knocked my stuff off the shelf!<br>
Today (2/6/06) the kitchen door rattled by itself. Baby and I were in
the living room, cats were in the living room with us. Angel got up to
inspect the door, and came back into the living room. Sylvester was on
the couch.<br>
2/10/06...this morning, we were in the kitchen eating breakfast...the
baby's battery operated doggy doll started operating by itself.&nbsp;
To get it playing, you have to press any number of parts on it. The
cats were in the basement at the time this happened. <br>
After a little over a month since the last incident, the ghost has made its presence known again.<br>
3/13/06. At 9:00 a.m., the baby and I were in the living room, I heard
banging and a bedroom door slam shut. When I got up to look, all the
doors were open.<br>
On 3/14/06, at 3 p.m., my husband and I were sitting in the living room
talking, when the side door latched shut. This is the aluminum heavy
door, not the screen door.&nbsp; I said to to him, someone is here, the
door just closed, so he got up and looked, noone was here.&nbsp; I
said, didn't you close the door all the way when you got home then? He
said he shut the door tight when he got home.<br>
3/15/06.&nbsp; Last night, at 3 a.m. my husband, me and the kids were
all sound asleep when there was this huge crashing bang in our BEDROOM!
my husband and I both woke up, thinking what is going on!&nbsp; I
thought it was Angel, knocking something over. After turning on the
light, and making an inspection of our room and the rest of the house,
there was nothing out of place. The cats can't make a bang that sounded
like someones fist and a big, strong fist at that, going through the
wall, so I guess it was our annoying ghost wanting to wake us up.&nbsp;
My husband told me this evening, he is curious to see and know who/what
it is, and wishes it will show itself...I said he was out of his tree,
and no way do I want to see much less know what/who it is!&nbsp; It can
keep itself to itself, and get the heck out of here!<br>
3/23/06&nbsp; The Pastor came by tonight, he did a blessing in every
room of the house, I asked him to do one in the bathroom too, since a
lot of stuff based out of there.&nbsp; You know, I hope the blessings
in all the rooms extended to the basement...he never went down there!
Well, if we have anymore incidents...I will be paying the Pastor
another call!&nbsp; <br>
4/17/06&nbsp; So far, so good! No more incidents.&nbsp; It has been a
much more relaxed, pleasant atmosphere.&nbsp; Those spirit(s) had some
real negative energy, I can feel they are gone,&nbsp; the whole house
feels different.<br>
4/23/06&nbsp; Rob was in the garage this night working on the dune
buggy, he kept hearing different noises and kept seeing shadows, so I
think our little ghost or ghosts has exiled to the garage after the
house blessing!! <br>
3/12/07 We are moving out of this house, hopefully whatever it was won't follow us to the new house!<br>

Unusual Stories<br>
<br>

<br>
The house where I grew up in Tennessee originally belonged to my
mother's great- grandparents.&nbsp; As a very young child I would see a
man standing at my bedroom door.&nbsp; He was there almost every night
and stood with his arms folded across his chest.&nbsp; We had four
bedrooms for a family of 9 so we shared bedrooms and sometimes switched
sleeping arrangements.&nbsp; I saw him no matter which bedroom I slept
in.&nbsp; He was tall with dark hair and dark-looking eyes, but it may
just have been the shadows. I was very frightened of him, but didn't
tell anyone in the family because no one else mentioned it, so I
figured they didn't see him.&nbsp; <br>
One night my two younger sisters and I were sleeping in the room with
our eldest sister.&nbsp; None of us had been asleep yet and one little
sister needed a drink.&nbsp; My oldest sister was taking her to the
kitchen, but I didn't want to go because the man was standing
there.&nbsp; My baby sister decided not to go to the kitchen and I was
relieved because I wouldn't have to pass the man at the doorway.&nbsp;
After the first two left, my youngest sister decided to go after all
and ran out of the room.&nbsp; I stood there staring at the man trying
to decide what to do.&nbsp; If I just stood there he could come in and
get me, but if I ran I would run right into him.<br>
I decided to run and as I ran past him, he smiled at me.&nbsp; Not a
smile with teeth, but an amused smile.&nbsp; I felt a rush of relief
and went to the kitchen to join the other three.&nbsp; When we went
back to bed, the man was not there.&nbsp; I do not recall ever seeing
him again.<br>
The house was renovated with two bedrooms added in the 70's.&nbsp; The
two additional rooms are set up like almost like a condo.&nbsp; One is
sunken and the other is above it with a small staircase going up to
that room.&nbsp; In late high school and college, the upstairs room was
mine.&nbsp; At times I would be lying in bed reading when my lamp would
go out.&nbsp; I would have to turn the switch on as if someone else had
switched it off.&nbsp; One night this happened three times before I
decided to give it up and go to sleep.&nbsp; <br>
People in the downstairs bedroom would hear someone walking around
upstairs when no one was there.&nbsp; My boyfriend (now my husband)
would come home with me from college and stay in my room.&nbsp; I
stayed in the room downstairs with my sister.&nbsp; We would sit up
talking and hear my boyfriend walking around in his boots in the
night.&nbsp; We could hear the difference in his footsteps from walking
on the carpet to the linoleum in the bathroom.&nbsp; He would say he
didn't get up.&nbsp; We thought he didn't remember, but thought it was
unusual for him to put on his boots just to go to the bathroom.&nbsp;
Then one night we heard it when he didn't come home with me.&nbsp; <br>
Unmistakable footsteps.&nbsp; Because of such a large family, we
thought maybe someone was up or one of the married sisters had come
over and was upstairs at 2:00 in the morning.&nbsp; We investigated,
but found no one.&nbsp; <br>
This happened again and again.&nbsp; Footsteps, investigation,
nothing.&nbsp; My husband swears that the toilet would flush in the
night, the radio would not only turn on, but change stations and the
light would turn on and off.&nbsp; <br>
My father never believed it until one night when he was home alone and
heard noises upstairs.&nbsp; This was after I had married and it was
now my brother's room.&nbsp; Thinking some of my brother's friends had
come over, my dad went upstairs to see who was making all the
noise.&nbsp; He said it sounded like someone was moving furniture
around.&nbsp; No one was there and my dad was white as a sheet when my
mom got home that night.&nbsp; He said, "Something's in this house."<br>
Several of us frequently heard voices outside as if a small group of
people was in the front yard talking.&nbsp; It was a low murmer.&nbsp;
One sister and I went so far as to sneak out the back door and around
to the front of the house to see if someone was there.&nbsp; (Just like
in the horror movies.&nbsp; It was really stupid.)&nbsp; We would hear
the murmer until we got to the front corner of the house.&nbsp; Then it
would stop.&nbsp; As soon as we backed up we could hear it again.&nbsp;
It was no louder than inside the house.&nbsp; <br>
There was a large tree in that part of the front yard and I remember
seeing pictures of people sitting under that tree.&nbsp; Maybe they
were having a famiy reunion at night.<br>
We nicknamed any strange occurance as "Grandpa" and just laugh about it
now.&nbsp; We still hear things when it is really quiet. <br>
My father has passed away now and my mother still lives in the
house.&nbsp; My brother and his son spent the night with my mom and the
next morning my nephew got up before my brother.&nbsp; He came running
back in the bedroom and told his dad to come on and hurry.&nbsp; He
said my brother would be so happy.&nbsp; So my brother got up and went
in the den with my nephew.&nbsp; My nephew looked confused and said,
"But he was just here.&nbsp; Papa was sitting right here in his
chair."&nbsp; At the time my nephew was 3 or 4, but my father passed
away when my nephew was almost 2.&nbsp; He kept telling my brother that
Papa had been sitting in his chair.<br>
That's all I can think of with this house.&nbsp; <br>

2 True Ghost Stories<br>
<br>
By: winddancer8@msn.com <br>
<br>
<br>
Since I was a young child I have always believed in ghost. I have first hand experience with them, let me tell you my stories. <br>
My family is originally from Burley , Idaho. My parents and my older
brothers were all born with in Idaho. It wasn&#8217;t until 1966 that they
decided to move to Las Vegas, Nevada. In June 1967 I joined the family
and became the only one born in Las Vegas. The year I was born my
brothers started what would become our migration to Idaho every summer.
I was able to join my brothers when I was 6 years old and that&#8217;s when I
had my first experience with the ghost of my Grandfather who died in
1957 from a farming accident. <br>
Every summer as my brother became older and bigger they would take on
some of the responsibility of helping our uncle change the water on the
crops.&nbsp; Some of the water changes always lead late into the night
. <br>
Now to understand the layout of the house the attic was turned into a
two bedrooms. The master bedroom where my Grandparents would sleep then
outside their door was the bed my father would sleep in, needing to be
close by suffering through two episodes of rheumatic fever.&nbsp;
Across the room by the window is the other twin bed where my aunt would
sleep between them was the stairs leading down to the main floor of the
house. <br>
After my Grandfather passed away my Grandmother moved downstairs to the
room off of the kitchen letting my father have one room and my aunt the
other. Years later my older brother would get the master bedroom and I
would sleep in the bed my father used my other brother would sleep in
the bed by the window. <br>
In the evenings after dinner was finished and the kitchen cleaned&nbsp;
we would sit around the kitchen table and play 500 rummy, word search,
read books, listen to mystery theater on the radio, until it was time
for me to turn in. I would go up stairs and lay down on my bed while my
brothers would wait for our uncle to pick them up to change water. <br>
While up stairs I would hear the bed springs on the old bed in the
master bedroom squeak as if someone who had been laying down sat up
then the creak of them standing the foot steps would come out of the
bedroom&nbsp; across the floor and down the stairs hitting the bottom
step as my brothers would head out the door. Then the process would
repeat in reverse when the came back. <br>
I would go downstairs and tell my Grandmother that Grandpa had gone out
to change the water with the boys. For years my brothers and cousins
would tease me because I could hear my Grandfather going out to change
the water on the crops every night. My Grandmother, Aunt and Uncle
would tell me that it was my active imagination. <br>
I had always believed without a shadow of doubt that what I heard was
my grandfather going out to change the water. When they would tease me
I would start crying for my Grandfather knowing that he wouldn&#8217;t let
them tease me like they did. I would cry because I missed him and yet I
never meet him in this life at least. He had died 10 years before I was
born. <br>
I didn&#8217;t get vindicated until my Grandmother finally sold the farm and
moved into town 22 years later. The house she moved into was two to
three houses down the street from the hospital that he had passed away
in. from her front door step you can see the window of his hospital
room.&nbsp; She also moved down the street from the cemetery that he is
buried in.&nbsp; <br>
Mean while out on the farm the new owners had their children sleeping
in the bedrooms upstairs a month after moving in the children refused
to sleep upstairs saying that the old man sleeping in the master
bedroom&nbsp; scared them every night as he leaves to change water and
then come back. It was then that my cousin would call me apologizing
for ever doubting me. <br>
When the new owners stopped by for a visit and proceeded to tell them
what has been going on in the house. They explained that I had grown up
listening to his coming and goings every night and at the time they
thought it was my imagination. They then asked the bishop of the local
church to come and bless the house and explain that his family no
longer lived there. They haven&#8217;t had a problem with grandpa going out
to change water since. <br>
But that isn&#8217;t the only experience my family has had with the
paranormal. In October 15th 1981 just after midnight my older brother
who on the 2nd had just turned 21 and was now living in Idaho working
the farm with our Aunt&#8217;s family had been killed minutes before midnight
by a drunk driver.&nbsp; Before our Aunt and Uncle could make it to the
house to break the news that he was gone. Grandma laying in bed
listening for him to come home from her room off of the kitchen heard
my brother come in and go up stairs to bed. <br>
When the she insisted that he came home they helped her upstairs to
prove that he wasn&#8217;t there.&nbsp; But what was there was a half empty
can of coke that still had a chill to it. Earlier that day my aunt had
been upstairs to get the sheets from the bed to wash and had thrown all
of the cans into the garbage and remade the bed. <br>
In June of 1984 my brother would be seen once again. Our cousin who
idolized him (we all did he was a people magnet. You were always drawn
to him, you could tell him your troubles always feeling better when you
did.) Our cousin always believed that whatever my brother could do he
could do it too. <br>
For example the family had rented a pontoon boat at Davis Damn in
Arizona ,&nbsp; It was my Uncle (another one) and his family and our
family with my oldest brother bringing a friend. While out on the lake
we&#8217;re in the process of trying to find a cove to dock in my brother and
his friend (both 17) decided to jump into the lake while the pontoon
was still going. <br>
They yelled that they were jumping in and jumped and as everyone turned
we see my younger cousin about 7 or 8 years old jumping in after them
(thank GOD for his life vest) everyone rushed to the bow of the pontoon
which&nbsp; forced it to start going under with everyone&#8217;s weight on
one in. In the meantime my brother is holding our cousin up by his life
vest and our cousin is just grinning that he did what my brother did. <br>
So in 1984 our cousin has just turned 16 and my brother has been gone
for three years at this point. One evening while up the street at his
friends house the family decided to go have pizza and invited him
along. When they went to get into the four door car my cousin came
around the driver side passenger door and came to a halt. <br>
The friends father and mother said he had gone white as a sheet, when
they asked him what was wrong instead of answering them he turned and
ran home as if the devil was after him. When he finally told them what
was wrong he said &#8220;I walked around the end of the door to get into the
back seat except that there was someone already there. It was Rickie
and he was holding his arms out to me as if he was going to hug me. His
face held a sadness to it but you could see that he was happy to see me
again.&#8221;&nbsp; <br>
A week later after one of our famous floods the night before our cousin
was riding in that car sitting in that same seat that he saw my
brother. The boy driving had hit a mound of dirt and rocks that
normally wouldn&#8217;t have been if it wasn&#8217;t for the flood the night
before.&nbsp; The car rolled and our cousin was thrown from the car. <br>
They airlifted him to the hospital and after three or four days (sorry
they all seemed to run together then) The doctors declared him brain
dead and my Uncle and Aunt took him off life support. The only comfort
for them is believing that my brother was there beside him. <br>
I have many, many more but those are the ones that stand out to me.<br>

Haunted Hotel in Las Vegas, New Mexico<br>
<br>
By: barbbond5@msn.com <br>
<br>
<br>
The Plaza Hotel in Las Vegas, New Mexico is haunted by a ghost named
Mr. Mills.&nbsp; When I stayed there when I was in the room at night I
smelled cigar smoke on and off.&nbsp; I felt someone in the dressing
room with me and smelled a strong smell of cigar smoke in that room at
the same time.&nbsp; The room got cold.&nbsp; I heard footsteps like
heavy boots as though someone was walking back and forth.&nbsp; I did
not feel threatened by the presence.&nbsp; I felt as though the
presence was watching over me somehow.&nbsp; I smelled the cigar smoke
on and off at different times in the hotel and often heard the
footsteps behind me the whole time we stayed there.&nbsp; I asked my
family if they smelled anything or heard anything and none of them did
or ever said they smelled the cigar smoke or heard anything.&nbsp; <br>
I am not afraid of ghosts and have actually felt my Father, who is
deceased, holding my hand at night and smelled his cologne, seen my
Mother in my bedroom sitting at the foot of my bed and calling my name,
seen my Father's parents, whom I have never met as they died a tragic
death before I was born, standing over my bed.&nbsp; <br>

Hauntings, Columbia, SC, Olympia Mills<br>
<br>
By: Johnnyreb6@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope that this email finds you doing well. I came across your all's
website and saw a story of a haunting that I have only recently heard
of and checked with my grandfather. The following is the posting that
you have.<br>
Columbia - Olympia Road - the abandoned mill - near the fairgrounds -
Several years ago when children were forced to work, there was a mill
that a deranged man owned. Many children died of exhaustion, and the
owner put their bodies in the furnace. It is a high spiritual place,
and there have been many odd happenings here, including the furnace
mysteriously turning on and the sound of children crying. There is a
story on this website in the hauntings section.&nbsp; - November 2003
correction/update: The only abandoned mill near the fairgrounds is the
old Olympia Mill, Which they are trying to get turned into an apartment
complex. It would not be surprising if this was haunted.<br>
- May 2005 update: It has mostly bee converted into apartments and the firdt model apartment was just unveiled. <br>
My grandfather (Harold Jones Robison) was born in the 1920's in
Columbia, South Carolina, and raised in the Olympia Mills area, his
father, my great-great Grandfather (John Jones Robison), worked at the
Mill from it's establishment to it's closing, as I am told by the
family. After first hearing this story I immediately contacted my
grandfather in reference to it as if anyone would know it would
certainly be him. He told me that he has heard this before and that it
did not happen, considering that they claim it was small children from
when he was little he says he would certainly have remembered his
friends being thrown into the furnace. He also told me that the Owner
of the Mill was a very nice fellow who people only complained about if
they were lazy. Being the researcher that I am I have also checked some
of the local newspapers from the timeperiod, if children had been
thrown in the furnace and it was well known the story would have
appeared somewhere, however there is no mention of it in the State
Newspaper that I could find.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do believe the Mill may be haunted but if so it is
certainly not the Ghost of Children thrown in the furnace. I do know
that several homeless folks have died there in the past few years, but
that was after the Mill had been abandoned.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways, hope you don't mind the information, I've
had a few experiences myself in the city of Columbia, S.C., at the
Hampton-Preston Mansion, Robert Mills House, and Trinity Episcopal
Cathedral to name a few places. But have never had any experiences at
the Mill, maybe with the new apartment tenants moving in we will hear
some more stories.<br>

Hettie and Freida<br>
<br>
By: simonbrowne@bigpond.com<br>
<br>
Around 10 years ago I was living in a small cottage, on a property that included 2 other houses.<br>
I work on an orchard just across the road, and the property I live on
was originally owned by the Sister and Brother In Law of My Boss.<br>
The Sister Freida had passed away some years ago, and Her Husband
Victor had moved closer to His Sons around 12 months before I moved in.<br>
One day while riding a quad bike home for lunch, I saw a Woman standing
near an old disused water tank that was between My cottage and the main
house.<br>
Knowing the people renting the main house quite well, I assumed She was a friend, so I waved and thought nothing of it.<br>
Later that night I asked My neighbours who it was ?<br>
They had not had visitors that day and had no idea.<br>
Some days later I was speaking to My Boss about it, and he asked Me to describe the Lady.<br>
After telling Him all about Her, (I can still picture her exactly to
this day), I was told that I had perfectly described "Hettie".<br>
Hettie was a gardener employed by Victor and Freida some 30 years
previous, and the place I saw her standing in was where the vegetable
garden had been.<br>
During part of Her time there She lived in the cottage that I was renting.<br>
I only ever saw Her the one time, but She was also seen by a Lady I know that used to visit Me.<br>
Once in the same place, and once in my kitchen window.<br>
She was never threatening and seemed to be perfectly real, not an apparition but a real person.<br>
I have since moved into the main house, and have had several experiences here as well, but these I believe to be Freida.<br>
The Master Bedroom has a bathroom directly opposite and on 3 ocassions
I have been looking in the mirror and glimpsed someone walking into the
bedroom.<br>
My Girlfriend has also had the same thing happen.<br>
I actually feel quite secure having them around, as the feeling given is that they are only looking after the place they loved.<br>
Not very exciting I know, but these sightings are as real as anything that's happened in My day to day life.<br>
No Ghostly mists or see through figures, I would swear these people were actually there.<br>
In just the last 2 weeks some other strange things have happened.<br>
I was woken around 3am one morning by a loud noise in the second bathroom.<br>
I looked in, and a broom that has always been kept outside the back door was in the shower.<br>
I heard the exact same noise again a few days later during the day time, but nothing was there.<br>
I'm not sure what these latest developments mean, but I still feel very safe and wanted to share My experiences.<br>

Strange Happening<br>
<br>
By: joeandlynnette@msn.com<br>
<br>
<br>
First off I have seen people after they have died. One of&nbsp; them I
didn&#8217;t really&nbsp; know but&nbsp; he was a friend of&nbsp; my fathers
.I was in bed along side my twin sister at the age of 10.My fathers
friend owned the house we lived in at the time and loved he&nbsp; the
house. the night her and I seen him we were sleeping on the pull out
sofa ,for what ever reason I had awaken and seen this guy standing in
the living room just watching us. I woke my sister up and she thought
it was our older brother and started talking to him, but he just stood
there kind of&nbsp; moving back and forth. Well that freaked us out and
we just laid&nbsp; there still not moving from being so scared. The
next thing is what really freaked us out! About 20 minutes later the
phone rang and my parents came out of there room very up set and my dad
had to go identify his friends body from a motorcycle accident. we told
our parents the next morning about what we had seen and we told them
what he was wearing, my dad looked at our mother in shock&nbsp; and
said that&#8217;s what he was wearing .&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t sleep for weeks
after that..never seen him again and I have never for got that either.
I have always seen black shadows that look like people also, the
size&nbsp; range from about the size of a 3 year old to a full size
man. No one ever believed me until my sister came to visit me one
Christmas and she thought I was standing behind her real close and she
turned to tell me to back up and it was a black shadow about 6 foot
tall..she don&#8217;t&nbsp; called me a story teller any more. another time,
I was standing in the shower washing my hair and I felt the sides of my
thighs burning and I looked down and seen two bloody marks on each side
like someone ran there finger nails down my legs and scratched me . my
husband didn&#8217;t believe me either until he him self was taking a&nbsp;
shower with the door looked and the radio unplugged its self&#8230;<br>
