<p><b>Black Thing</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: stodd@lions.k12.ar.us</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>i have had so many experiences, i will tell a couple. a couple yrs.
ago i</b>
<br><b>was woke up by this thing on my back, i was sleeping on my stomach
and my</b>
<br><b>pillow was over my head and arms. i could not breath, i could not
move, i</b>
<br><b>could not get awake. or at least my body couldn't get awake.&nbsp;
i finally got</b>
<br><b>awake enough to get the pillow off my head and was so out of breath
that i</b>
<br><b>could not hardly move. so, i went back to sleep and before long
it happened</b>
<br><b>again, this time when i woke up i was sort of looking down at my
self from</b>
<br><b>my ceiling, this thing on my back was very black. it was of average
height</b>
<br><b>but much wider than an ordinary person. it was just so black and
heavy, it</b>
<br><b>just really scared my at the time.</b>
<br><b>anyway that is when we noticed that there was something in the house.
it</b>
<br><b>would walk the floors at night, and you could smell an odor that
was like</b>
<br><b>hot or burnt wires, and sometimes with a bit of sulphur to it.&nbsp;
But it was</b>
<br><b>different than that night, this was more of a peacefull feel. i
have seen a</b>
<br><b>man in my house and outside of my house several times and one night
my 5 yr</b>
<br><b>old daughter fell out of bed, mysteriously, and when i was helping
her get</b>
<br><b>in to my bed we both just went right through him. he was leaning
over her as</b>
<br><b>she was getting into bed and i could see him, even his clothes,
right in</b>
<br><b>front of me. then not too long ago my 12 yr son was sick and was
laying in</b>
<br><b>my bed and come in to tell me he could see our ghost in the computer
screen,</b>
<br><b>the computer was unplugged because of storms a few days before.
i have a</b>
<br><b>hundred stories with this ghost, but i have had something bizzare
happen to</b>
<br><b>me lately. This summer i spent a lot of time at the baseball fields,
like</b>
<br><b>every summer, and on the way home one night i could smell this strong</b>
<br><b>flowery perfume in my car. i was alone, i was helping out in the
concession</b>
<br><b>stand, and it was in my car the rest of the way to my house.&nbsp;
i told my mom</b>
<br><b>about it one night and as she and dad were leaving we all smell
"her" on the</b>
<br><b>front porch. "she" really likes my husband most, she will let him
know she</b>
<br><b>is there at least once to twice a week, i have only noticed her
about 4 or 5</b>
<br><b>times since she came home with me in july, it is now the end of
october.</b>
<br><b>i think the weirdest thing to happen to us was when we lived on
top of this</b>
<br><b>hill, the house was definetly haunted! it was spooky even if it
was day time</b>
<br><b>sometimes. one night we came home from a weeks vacation and every
time we</b>
<br><b>would almost go to sleep, we would be woken up by things flying
around in</b>
<br><b>the bedroom opposite us, we would get up and open the door and things
would</b>
<br><b>be one way and the next time they would be different. after a little
while</b>
<br><b>we would see little lights on our wall and then the burnt out night
light</b>
<br><b>came&nbsp; on VERY bright, then this square on the hall bathroom
door, it was</b>
<br><b>soooo weird, it was a perfect square only the corners were up and
down and</b>
<br><b>side to side. i ran my hand a few inches from it and there was no
shadow and</b>
<br><b>the light was very warm.&nbsp; it lasted about 5 to 6 minutes and
was gone. well</b>
<br><b>we could not sleep after that and went to the living room to talk
and get</b>
<br><b>some tea and the lights in the living room went out, even the tv
went off</b>
<br><b>and when it did there was a womans face in it that just kind of
glared at</b>
<br><b>us.&nbsp; a few weeks later i was folding clothes in my bedroom
and looked up</b>
<br><b>(had this overwhelming feeling of being watched) and there was a
black man</b>
<br><b>standing outside my kitchen window watching me. He had early century
clothes</b>
<br><b>on ( overalls, hankerchief, red flannels) i could see his eyeballs
even, it</b>
<br><b>really spooked me. but then i realised i could see the tree, right
through</b>
<br><b>him. Keep in mind there are no blacks in this little town or even
close to</b>
<br><b>it at the time. and to top it off, about 7 yrs later this woman
tells me a</b>
<br><b>little history about the hill we lived on and it used to be a KKK
hanging</b>
<br><b>hill. this info really creeped me.&nbsp; well that is a little of
what has</b>
<br><b>happened to me. later</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghost Stories</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: FUNKEYMONKEY1990@hotmail.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>One day when I was little, I lived in an apartment. I was about 1
years old. I had this really tall dresser and on top of it was my favorite
glass doll. I was too short to reach it, and I didn't know how to climb
yet. I came out of the room with it and my mom asked me where I got that
from. I told her the tall man in my room gave it to me. My dad wasn't home
and it was only my mom and me home. Then she went and looked and it was
really cold in the room. She got scared and then we went to my Grandpas
house.</b>
<br><b>We moved from there into a different house. When we first got there,
there was an old oven in the basement. It would always turn on and it smelled
like bread baking. We then found out that there are many ghosts in my house
right now. The old lady died in the house and she liked to make bread.</b>
<br><b>When my mom had a little boy, (my brother) the ghosts would always
rock him when he cried. I know this because one day my Grandpa came over
while my dad was at work. My mom was reading a book in her room. My Grandpa
walked in and saw someone rocking my brother. He thought it was my dad.
My mom asked him if he checked up on my brother. He said that her husband
was rocking him. The my mom said that he was at work. They went back to
look on them and my brother was sleeping.</b>
<br><b>I have many other stories. If you would like to hear them email

<br><b>A Favorite Celebrity</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: dbzgal04@yahoo.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>Here's another experience from yours truly (I've</b>
<br><b>communicated with several spirits).</b>
<br><b>This is about the spirit of a singer who died an</b>
<br><b>untimely death.&nbsp; I'm not going to give her name, in</b>
<br><b>case some of her other fans happen to read this, they</b>
<br><b>might get kinda upset.</b>
<br><b>There was a movie made about her.&nbsp; The last couple</b>
<br><b>times I saw it I cried at the end.&nbsp; Well, she came and</b>
<br><b>comforted me!&nbsp; She told me to not be so depressed over</b>
<br><b>what happened to her, and that she's better off where</b>
<br><b>she is now (as well as my 2nd cousin, whom I still</b>
<br><b>love</b>
<br><b>very much).&nbsp; Like my 2nd cousin, she also visits me</b>
<br><b>from time to time.&nbsp; This singer continues to be sweet</b>
<br><b>and beautiful, even as a ghost.</b>
<br><b>As for the visiting part, what can I say, I must be</b>

<br><b>A Caring Spirit</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: address withheld by request</b>

</p><p><b>I live in Sydney Australia and was in Hornsby Hospital after having
my second child.&nbsp;&nbsp; I always felt there was a spirit or something
that walked the halls,&nbsp; It wasn't until I experienced it first hand
that I realised my suspicions were confirmed.</b>
<br><b>It was approx 2am,&nbsp; my newborn son was in the natal care unit
so I was always being called to feed him.&nbsp; I slept with one light
on so it would be easier for me to get up when the nurses called me.&nbsp;
Anyway I was facing the window opposite the door,&nbsp; I heard someone
enter and thought it was a nurse to call me for my baby.&nbsp; Sure enough
she had on a long green skirt and shirt and she seemed to wisp in and out
she had a very soft voice and called yoo hoo Jayne bubs awake.&nbsp; I
rolled over and laid there looking at the curtain summoning the energy,
(anyone who has had a c-section baby will know the strength of that statement)
I was fully awake, about 5 mins passed and I was just about sitting up
when another nurse came in and said Jayne baby's awake.&nbsp; I apologised
and said I was coming.</b>
<br><b>I shuffled down to the nursery and sat down with all the other nurses
and had a chat whilst I fed the baby.&nbsp; I apologised for not coming
when first called,&nbsp; they looked at me puzzled and said there was only
one nurse come down to call me that night ??????????? we began talking
about ghosts etc and I said I sensed an older woman who was a nurse there
once and she was very strict on the ward I described what I sensed and
the nurses said I had described one of the old sisters that had lived at
the hospital and died there.&nbsp; I didn't feel threatened but rather
looked after so to speak.&nbsp; After that night a couple of things happened
that freaked the nurses out whilst on their shifts.&nbsp; I think they
were glad when I left.&nbsp; Anyway that is my story and not all spirits
are out to GET YOU !!!!!!!!</b>

<p><b>1864 Robinson</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: hbobb@hotmail.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>Being a kid from a large single parent family, we moved around alot,
one of</b>
<br><b>these homes was on 1864 Robinson. We were poor, my mom tried hard
to give us</b>
<br><b>the things we needed but she had no help, my two younger brothers
and I used</b>
<br><b>to share a room and a bed together. We used to sleep upstairs in
large room</b>
<br><b>just opposite the bathroom on the south side of the house, it had
a large</b>
<br><b>window with no curtains or coverings so the streetlights used to
shine thru</b>
<br><b>at night. At the end of the room was a closet that had no door,
we rarely</b>
<br><b>used it. One night I was awakened by a large blue light coming from
outside</b>
<br><b>the room, I thought it was from the bathroom but it was an intense
blue and</b>
<br><b>seemed to grow brighter and brighter. The door to our room was partly
open</b>
<br><b>and all of a sudden a young boy was standing in the doorway, he
stood there</b>
<br><b>looking at me, I was frozen with fear, I tried to yell but nothing
came out.</b>
<br><b>He was bathed in a blue light that to this day I have yet to experience</b>
<br><b>again, he floated above the floor. He moved slowly towards me, gliding
on</b>
<br><b>air, he then floated along the wall away from us to the closet,
he stopped</b>
<br><b>turned and floated in, the light disappearing. I couldn't move,
I tried and</b>
<br><b>tried finally I slid off the bed and crawled to the stairs, I tried
to walk</b>
<br><b>down but my legs gave way and I fell. My mom awoke and rushed to
see what</b>
<br><b>happened, she held me as I told her, she put me in her room and
went and got</b>
<br><b>my brothers, no one ever went it that room again. I used to go by
there from</b>
<br><b>time to time until one day I went and there now was a new home built
there,</b>
<br><b>makes me wonder if</b>
<br><b>anything strange ever happens to them.</b><b></b>

<p><b>3 Ghost Stories</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: balandsal@hotmail.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>I have 3 stories to share. The first is an experience I had 20 years
ago. My</b>
<br><b>aunt who lived with us passed away. When she was alive, she would
go out and</b>
<br><b>get a snack at around the same time every night. After her funeral,
every</b>
<br><b>night at about the same time, the refridgerator door would open
and close.</b>
<br><b>This went on for a couple of weeks, then stopped. Every so often,
I still</b>
<br><b>get a wiff of her perfume as if she just walked past me.</b>
<br><b>The second was experienced by both me and my daughter. She was very
close to</b>
<br><b>her grandfather her entire life. He passed away in 2000 shortly
before the</b>
<br><b>birth of her first child. Shortly after his passing, my daughter
said in the</b>
<br><b>middle of the night, she would feel someone sit on the corner of
her bed.</b>
<br><b>When she would turn to look, no one was there. This was something
her</b>
<br><b>grandfather had done when she was little. After the baby was born,
my</b>
<br><b>daughter started noticing other strange things. The baby would turn
her head</b>
<br><b>as if watching someone walking across the room, but no one was there.
One</b>
<br><b>night, she was holding the baby and the baby was staring at what,
to my</b>
<br><b>daughter, was a blank wall and laughing. My daughter looked at the
baby and</b>
<br><b>there was a reflection of the figure of a man as if he were standing
exactly</b>
<br><b>where the baby was looking. Several times when I was babysitting
at my</b>
<br><b>daughter's house, the baby's musical toys would turn on by themselves
with</b>
<br><b>no one close to them. And the baby would stare at that wall and
laugh, as if</b>
<br><b>someone were standing there. My daughter doesn't live in the house
any</b>
<br><b>longer and the strange things seem to have stopped</b>
<br><b>The third is the strangest of all. My son and some of his friends
went to an</b>
<br><b>abandoned house that is supposedly haunted. The story is that a
man killed</b>
<br><b>his&nbsp; entire family in the house and then himself. There are
bullet holes in</b>
<br><b>the walls in the upstairs to support the story. Finding nothing
of interest</b>
<br><b>upstairs or on the main floor, they decided to investigate the basement.</b>
<br><b>They found a partial wall at the end of the basement. They noticed
a</b>
<br><b>terrible odor coming from that area of the room. They looked over
the top of</b>
<br><b>the wall and found nothing but some old boots and a shovel. When
they went</b>
<br><b>to go back upstairs to the main floor, there was wet blood on the
stairs. It</b>
<br><b>had not been there on the way down. They nosed around on the main
floor</b>
<br><b>again and found some money tucked in a broken TV set. There was
blood on the</b>
<br><b>money too, but it was dried. Each person took a bill home with them.
They</b>
<br><b>all started to have extremely bad luck - car accidents and such.
They</b>
<br><b>thought it might be connected to the money so they took it back
and placed</b>
<br><b>it where they found it. The bad luck went away. They checked the
basement</b>
<br><b>again, but nothing was there.&nbsp; Others say you can drive past
the house and</b>
<br><b>see lights on in windows even though there are no working lights
and there</b>
<br><b>is no power to the house. Some say they've seen the figure of a
child or</b>
<br><b>lady in one of the bedroom windows. My son and his friends have
not been</b>
<br><b>back since, and my son refuses to even drive past the house any
more.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Dorm Room Ghost</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: MVanamberg@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Growing up as a ministers daughter, I was very skeptical about ghost
all my life. Then I went to a small private college in Tennessee.&nbsp;
My first year was pretty uneventful, but the second year I moved into a
new dorm room.&nbsp; My room was a suite of two rooms with a bathroom in
between and my former roommate lived in the other room.&nbsp; The first
year in the suite there was only one occurrence of what I now think was
a supernatural event.&nbsp; Normally, the doors between the two suites
were kept shut, but one weekend the girls on the other side of the suite
asked my roommate and I to feed their hermit crabs while they went home.&nbsp;
They had been gone for a day when my roommate and I came by to our dorm
from lunch to find every single electrical appliance running, including
the microwave, radio, and hair dryers.&nbsp; We had left the door to the
adjoining suite open but as we assumed it was just some silly collto prove
it was there.&nbsp; It did! We had all been in the bedroom and after our
conference, we all went into the living area together.&nbsp; A huge stuffed
bear that had been on its usual place on the floor when I had left the
room earlier, was now sprawled across the couch.&nbsp; Of course, we were
pretty scared then.&nbsp; The pranks became worse.&nbsp; Wet towels no
one had used would be on the bathroom floor, breezes coming from nowhere
would move the dust ruffles on the bed, things would be taken out of drawers
and left on the floor.&nbsp; On homecoming weekend, I was the only one
who had stayed in town.&nbsp; I was in the suite alone, taking a shower,
when I heard someone unlock and open the door to the living area and walk
in.&nbsp; I heard high heel shoes walk across the floor, through the bathroom,
and through the other room and walk out the bedroom door.&nbsp; I thought
at first that it was one of my roommates who decided to come to homecoming
after all and I called out hello, but no one answered.The only other experience
I have had is at the house in Vermont where Joe Walsh used to live.&nbsp;
My husbands uncle is the caretaker there and shortly after I met my husband,
he took me up there to look at the house.&nbsp; I had not been told of
any ghost stories connected to the house at this point.&nbsp; As we walked
around the house, I became increasingly agitated.&nbsp; By the time we
were upstairs, I was having trouble breathing, and as we started toward
the ballroom, I knew I had to get out fast.&nbsp; I was terrified and sensed
just an overpowering feeling of evil there.&nbsp; I raced out and I refuse
to even look at the house anymore.&nbsp; Later that day, my husbands uncle
told me about all the different stories and encounters people have reported
about the house.&nbsp; A man had hung himself in the very room that I had
trouble breathing in and at night, the uncle had heard sound of people
and objects moving frequently.</b>
<br><b>I am now a true believer in ghost, but I am also terrified of them
and I hope these are all the experiences I will ever have!</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp; Phantom</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>

</p><p><b>By: gl01endo@hotmail.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>this happened on my highschool grad year of 2001</b>
<br><b>it's a bit of a long story and has some cussing, so please excuse
my</b>
<br><b>language</b>
<br><b>my name is jonathan endo and i live in Vancouver B.C. Canada</b>
<br><b>at my school, Gladstone Secondary, there was a tale where in the
auditorium,</b>
<br><b>there was a "phantom" or ghost that</b>
<br><b>lurked around during late nights.</b>
<br><b>well, i can say it actually started during grade 11 (year 2000)</b>
<br><b>what happened was when i heard of the story of the phantom, there
was one</b>
<br><b>night i was having a late rehersal with</b>
<br><b>my theatre company.&nbsp; i think it was around 11pm when we finished,
and my</b>
<br><b>friend just told me the tale.</b>
<br><b>right after that my arm started to itch, i was wearing a sweater,
so i</b>
<br><b>pulled up my sleave to stratch my arm and i found</b>
<br><b>a fairly large scratch that was about 3-4 inches going up my arm.&nbsp;
as if a</b>
<br><b>cat had scratch me</b>
<br><b>i started thinking a little bit about if the ghost in the school
was true,</b>
<br><b>but then i just thought, "not in this location, after all, students
like to</b>
<br><b>tell school tales."</b>
<br><b>i've always believed in ghosts, but i didn't believe there was one
in the</b>
<br><b>auditorium until my grad year</b>
<br><b>this year, i joined the school choir.&nbsp; there were two choirs
i was in:</b>
<br><b>concert choir = CC(students grs 8-12 taken at 7:30am-8am)</b>
<br><b>and senior chamber choir SCC(gr. 11-12, one gr. 10 student taken
at</b>
<br><b>6:30pm-8pm)</b>
<br><b>there were two girls who have seen ghosts before, but no one really
believed</b>
<br><b>any of their stories</b>
<br><b>one girl is japanese (grade 12 same age as me), the other fillipino
(grade</b>
<br><b>10 about 2 years younger than me)</b>
<br><b>the japanese girl told me what she saw in the auditorium during
a</b>
<br><b>performance in the begining of the year in abbodsford (think that's
how you</b>
<br><b>spell it)</b>
<br><b>since she was in my grade and this was well in the begining of the
year, i</b>
<br><b>did not talk to the fillipino girl</b>
<br><b>about 5 mins after she told me what she saw, i drifted over to another
group</b>
<br><b>of girls, the fillipino girl described the exact</b>
<br><b>description, a white brunette girl, that wore a white gown.</b>
<br><b>i was shocked, so i kept in mind to pay my respects whenever i go
in the</b>
<br><b>auditorium</b>
<br><b>the same month, i was half asleep in my SCC rehersal one night,
when</b>
<br><b>suddenly i noticed something at the back of the auditorium.</b>
<br><b>It was a left arm (looking at it, to my right) of someone and as
you looked</b>
<br><b>up the arm, it got transparent to complete nothingness. it walked
down the</b>
<br><b>stairs and turned left toward the foyer doors.</b>
<br><b>i got shocked and suddenly snapped out of being sleepy, blinked
heavily, and</b>
<br><b>it was gone</b>
<br><b>i thought nothing of it, because i have seen things people never
seen</b>
<br><b>before, but this night, after reheresal, my friend came up to me
and he</b>
<br><b>asked, "did you see a white arm?"&nbsp; i was so scared i ran out
of the</b>
<br><b>auditorium as fast as i could and just waited outside for my friends..</b>
<br><b>during this time, i had 2 play rehersals that i attended, after
telling this</b>
<br><b>story to my director, she told me that her friend experienced the
same</b>
<br><b>thing, i really didn't know if that was true, but all of a sudden,
the spot</b>
<br><b>light that was shinning on us turned off.</b>
<br><b>we all got scared, but the i told them, "it's probably the circuit
breaker."</b>
<br><b>my cast member flicked on the circuit switch and we began talking
about it</b>
<br><b>again, about 5 mins later, it just turned off</b>
<br><b>it turning off, and that was really weird, because after all, stage
lights</b>
<br><b>are made to handle heat and being turned on all day</b>
<br><b>so we just left calmly hoping nothing will harm us</b>
<br><b>about roughly 1 month later, there were mornings where i would scare
my</b>
<br><b>friend on the way to school.</b>
<br><b>his house was inbetween mine and the school, the half way point
you can say.</b>
<br><b>i successfully scared him once, but the second time was not so good.</b>
<br><b>he caught me (he was walking about half a block ahead) and started
to run</b>
<br><b>towards the school</b>
<br><b>by the time i got there, he asked me, "hey, where's your sister"</b>
<br><b>since my sister had a habbit of sleeping in, i told him, "she's
not going to</b>
<br><b>CC today"</b>
<br><b>he replied, "don't lie to me man."</b>
<br><b>i said, "i'm not lying, she's not coming, she's sleeping in today,she's</b>
<br><b>probably gonna skip school again."</b>
<br><b>he replied, "look, you can't fool me, i'll kick your ass when i
find out</b>
<br><b>she's here."</b>
<br><b>so we got into an arguement for half and hour until CC started.</b>
<br><b>when the teacher took our attendance, she called out my sister's
name, and</b>
<br><b>of course, she did not reply</b>
<br><b>"ah, skipping again is she?" said my teacher</b>
<br><b>at that point, my friend looked at me, took a few steps away, and
said,</b>
<br><b>"hey, are you serious you didn't even walk with anyone today?"</b>
<br><b>i replied, "the hell do you think?&nbsp; damnit, i walk alone, even
when my</b>
<br><b>sister comes to school."</b>
<br><b>he said, "look, i saw someone walk with you today, but the girl
was taller</b>
<br><b>than you sister, i thought she maybe was wearing heals, but she
was just</b>
<br><b>about your height."</b>
<br><b>"the heck did you smoke today ?" was what i replied</b>
<br><b>"look, i saw a girl, for real, just, just don't talk to me today.."
was what</b>
<br><b>he said as if he was freaked out big time</b>
<br><b>i thought nothing of it yet again and just minded my own business</b>
<br><b>that day, during lunch, i was in improv (theatre sports) rehersal,
sleepy as</b>
<br><b>usual, i took a sip out of my barq's rootbeer, closed my eyes and
thought</b>
<br><b>about what my friend said to me earlier.</b>
<br><b>suddenly, i felt as if i spilled rootbeer on the side of my cheek,
and it</b>
<br><b>dripped on my right thigh</b>
<br><b>i was thinking to myself, "for god sakes, i don't want to go home
and</b>
<br><b>change.."</b>
<br><b>i opened my eyes, wiped my face, and to shock, nothing was there,
no liquid</b>
<br><b>what so ever</b>
<br><b>i touched my pants, they were not wet.&nbsp; i got freaked out,
and kept thinking</b>
<br><b>about it for the remainder of lunch.</b>
<br><b>after lunch was my literature class.&nbsp; i almost fell asleep
when someone just</b>
<br><b>grabbed my right thigh.&nbsp; it felt as though they put a lot of
pressure on</b>
<br><b>where i felt the rootbeer drop.&nbsp; i opened my eyes and was about
to throw a</b>
<br><b>punch at the guy that usually sits beside me...</b>
<br><b>only to find out no one was there..</b>
<br><b>most of the students that day had a field trip and didn't show up
to class,</b>
<br><b>so all most all the people that usually sat near me were gone</b>
<br><b>i was totally freaked out by then cause the thought kicked in that
all of</b>
<br><b>them told me the day before that they weren't going to be there.&nbsp;
plus one</b>
<br><b>of my other friends was skipping class that day as well</b>
<br><b>i asked the teacher if i could go to the washroom to wash my face,
and he</b>
<br><b>allowed me to</b>
<br><b>i thought to myself in the washroom, "what the heck is going on?
am i going</b>
<br><b>crazy? maybe i just need more sleep..."</b>
<br><b>the next few months was the worst exp. of my life.&nbsp; since i
knew the ghost</b>
<br><b>was female, at the time, i did not have a girlfriend.</b>
<br><b>so i kept on thinking about the ghost, whether she had a boyfriend,
whether</b>
<br><b>she was pretty, whether i would be the boyfriend of this girl, etc
etc.&nbsp; and</b>
<br><b>about 5 mins into thinking all these thoughts, i'd started to cry
for about</b>
<br><b>3 hours.</b>
<br><b>just locked myself in my room, and refuse to go out unless my friends
called</b>
<br><b>me out.</b>
<br><b>at that time, i was really pale, and everyone didn't know what to
say.&nbsp; they</b>
<br><b>all asked me if i was alright, i just said, yes.</b>
<br><b>one night, i looked in the mirror after washing my face, the image
i saw was</b>
<br><b>burned into my eyes for the rest of my life.</b>
<br><b>it looked as if i was dead, black sags under my eyes, blue lips,
pale skin,</b>
<br><b>i got so scared i almost punched the mirror, but instead, i ran
out of the</b>
<br><b>washroom as fast as i could, my mom asked what happened, i said,
nothing.</b>
<br><b>during this time, when i finished crying, i'd go to bed, and when
thinking</b>
<br><b>about if i'll be alone for the rest of my life, i'd always feel
someone</b>
<br><b>hugging me from behind, and then the thought came into my head,
"don't</b>
<br><b>worry, i'm here"</b>
<br><b>i never heard it, but it was as though, i felt something was trying
to tell</b>
<br><b>me that</b>
<br><b>all of a sudden, from being sad, i'd just feel so neutral and go
to sleep.</b>
<br><b>the thought of suicide came in a lot too, for some strange reason,
i don't</b>
<br><b>know why.</b>
<br><b>one day, my chinese friend told me, "you think about the ghost a
lot don't</b>
<br><b>you?"</b>
<br><b>i asked, "what makes you think that?</b>
<br><b>he told me, "you look like you're going to die, besides, all you
talk about</b>
<br><b>now is that ghost you saw."</b>
<br><b>i all of a sudden started to cry</b>
<br><b>he said to me, "look, you know what they believe in chinese?"</b>
<br><b>i said no</b>
<br><b>he continued, "think about the ghost, it'll follow, i suggest you
stop</b>
<br><b>thinking about it before something bad happens."</b>
<br><b>after he told me this, i tried, but my will power was so weak at
the time, i</b>
<br><b>just thought about it even more</b>
<br><b>what i saw at the school, what my friend told me he saw, and a big
question</b>
<br><b>that poped in my head, "does she love me?"</b>
<br><b>i got scared, sad, angry, everything poured in</b>
<br><b>and that night, i could not sleep</b>
<br><b>the next day, i met up with him again, he then said again, "i know
you're</b>
<br><b>still thinking of the ghost, forget about it, i'm serious, if you
don't,</b>
<br><b>i'll kill you before it gets you."</b>
<br><b>thinking about that, he was a strong guy, and i know he'd beat the
crap out</b>
<br><b>of me, the next two weeks, i did not talk, think, or even dare ask
anything</b>
<br><b>to the ghost.</b>
<br><b>all i said every night before i went to bed was, "I know you have
something</b>
<br><b>for me, but face it, i'm not dead, you're not alive, just leave
me alone,</b>
<br><b>find someone the same as you.&nbsp; besides, you're ruining my chances
with</b>
<br><b>girls, it hurts to let you go, but it also hurts to think about
you, just</b>
<br><b>leave me alone, that i beg of you, so please, just leave me be."</b>
<br><b>those two weeks were the most saddest times of my life</b>
<br><b>until one day, i was truly happy again.</b>
<br><b>at that time, even now, a few people believe my story.&nbsp; some
just think it</b>
<br><b>was created in my mind out of being despreate of wanting a girlfriend.
but i</b>
<br><b>know what happened.&nbsp; i know what i saw, experienced, and felt.&nbsp;
it was not</b>
<br><b>fake, but real.</b>
<br><b>like i've said before, i've seen things before when i'm half asleep.&nbsp;
things</b>
<br><b>that just plain scared the shit out of me.</b>
<br><b>but now, since i've exp. it, i do not hesitate to stop thinking
about</b>
<br><b>ghosts, for i do not want them to follow me.</b>
<br><b>after stoping my thoughts toward this ghost, i have been left alone,
no more</b>
<br><b>uneasy nights, no more crying, no more sadness</b>
<br><b>but one night, after hearing bad news, i started thinking about
it again, i</b>
<br><b>found myself driving toward the school near the entrance where it
leads to</b>
<br><b>the auditorium.&nbsp; then i snapped out of it and just drove back
home.</b>
<br><b>that's my story</b>
<br><b>i'm not a good story teller but that's how i can put this in my
own words.</b>
<br><b>the history about my school was that it was made in the 1950s&nbsp;
the</b>
<br><b>auditorium and "e wing" of the school was made after the original
school was</b>
<br><b>built.</b>
<br><b>the school was built on previous farm land</b>
<br><b>that's all i know about it, but when i have time, i'm most likey
going to do</b>

<p><b>Evil in Cabana Colony</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: bronze14@earthlink.net</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>This happened to a few friends of mine about a year ago.&nbsp; Apparently
many people "know" that an area of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, called
Cabana Colony, is haunted.&nbsp; Of course, lots of people live there -
couples, families, renters - and some have never even heard the rumors,
so much for having a problem there.&nbsp; The homes were built starting
about in the 1950's, which is a fairly old neighborhood for South Florida.&nbsp;
I've known several people over the years who lived in the Cabana Colony
subdivision, but I've only visited them once or twice.&nbsp; I never liked
going in there, but I never really thought about why.&nbsp; After hearing
what my friend Mary (not her real name) went through, now I know why I
didn't like it there.&nbsp; I have steadfastly refused to ever go back
no matter who lives there and wants me to visit, I've just never explained
to them why.</b>
<br><b>Mary had been dating John (fake name, too) for a while when he moved
into a house with Bill (again - fake name).&nbsp; Bill's parents owned
the house but didn't live there.&nbsp; Bill and John then rented the house
since Bill's parents offered to rent it to them relatively cheaply since
Bill is their son.&nbsp; Bill still needed a roommate to be able to cover
the entire rent, but it was a nice place for two guys in their 20's and
they really liked it.&nbsp; However, as soon as John moved into the house,
he and Mary started to argue whenever he was in the house and on the phone
with Mary or whenever Mary came over there to visit.&nbsp; Mary constantly
felt "wrong" whenever she was there:&nbsp; either aggitated or annoyed
or depressed or just generally uncomfortable.&nbsp; Whenever they were
together away from the house, everything was fine between them.</b>
<br><b>John started to tell Mary that there was something weird going on
in the house.&nbsp; Keys and personal items would disappear from one spot
and show up in another.&nbsp; He and Bill would hear weird animal noises
outside, but wouldn't see a cat or dog that would account for the howling
and snarling.&nbsp; One night while Bill was lying in bed watching tv,
he looked up to see a waft of smoke on the wall.&nbsp; He wasn't smoking,
and John wasn't home.&nbsp; The smoke actually started weaving in and out
of the little pin-pricks on the wall where Bill had had posters tacked
up and subsequently moved to a different part of the room.&nbsp; The holes
weren't deep enough that they punctured the drywall, so the smoke wasn't
being sucked in and out of the walls by a draft.&nbsp; The motion of the
smoke looked almost as if it were being directed by a conscious force.&nbsp;
It eventually moved down the wall beneath the window, and then up and over
the windowsill and out through the screen.&nbsp; It was then that Bill
heard snarling and grunting under his window, but it didn't sound completely
like an animal.&nbsp; It was almost an evil chuckling sound.&nbsp; He was
too terrified to even get out of bed and run for it, so much for actually
getting up and slamming the window shut.&nbsp; Eventually it stopped and
he let himself convince his brain that it never happened and he went to
sleep.</b>
<br><b>The worst happened one night when Mary was visiting John.&nbsp;
They were sitting on the sofa, turned towards one another, just having
a nice conversation.&nbsp; Suddenly, John just stopped talking.&nbsp; His
face went sheet white, his eyes wide, his mouth slightly open as if he
was about to say something and just froze.&nbsp; He was just staring out
the window that was behind Mary.&nbsp; Tears just started streaming out
of his eyes, his face never changing expression.&nbsp; Mary slowly asked,
"John...what's wrong?"&nbsp; No answer.&nbsp; "John, please tell me what's
wrong."&nbsp; He just kept staring.&nbsp; Mary was so terrified by the
look on John's face that she couldn't bring herself to turn around and
look out the window.&nbsp; "John, tell me what you see RIGHT NOW."&nbsp;
This went on for at least a minute or two - him staring, her begging for
a response - and then he finally looked at Mary.&nbsp; Once more she asked,
"What did you see?"&nbsp; She knew whatever he saw wasn't there anymore
just by the look on his face and felt it was safe to turn around and look.&nbsp;
There was nothing.&nbsp; John took a few deep breaths and then told her:&nbsp;
It was a face of some sort of beast.&nbsp; Not human, but not animal.&nbsp;
Somewhere in between.&nbsp; It had red eyes and a wicked, malevolent grin,
as if it knew that just by being seen it was terrifying John.&nbsp; Mary
reluctantly stayed the night at the house with John.&nbsp; For whatever
reason he wouldn't leave the house, Bill was out of town for the weekend,
and she was not about to leave John there alone.&nbsp; Nothing more unusual
happened that night, other than the constant feeling she always had in
the house of something being off-kilter, a very surreal feeling of not
being able to get comfortable.</b>
<br><b>The next day she had to go to work.&nbsp; Mary was waiting tables
at that time, and since it was Saturday, she picked up a double shift thinking
the busy weeekend day would net her some extra cash.&nbsp; She felt bad
because she know John would be stuck home all day since his car was in
the shop and wouldn't be ready until at least Monday, but she called him
a few times from the restaurant during the day and he seemed fine.&nbsp;
That night, at the end of the second half of her double shift, she called
him again.&nbsp; This time, all was not okay.&nbsp; He was outside, having
a cigarette.&nbsp; This was strange in and of itself because he rarely
smoked.&nbsp; He told her he was watching the "thing" roaming around the
street.&nbsp; He said it was calling to him, in his head.&nbsp; It was
all Mary could do to keep from running to her car and racing over to the
house.&nbsp; She kept talking to him, telling him to go inside, ignore
the "thing", and that she was coming to get him, all the while dialing
his number from her cell phone so that she could continue talking to him
as she drove over there.&nbsp; He wouldn't pick up the call waiting.&nbsp;
Now he was saying that he had to kill it, it had to be killed.&nbsp; Mary
was now terrified.&nbsp; She finally got him to go back in the house, but
he still wouldn't pick up the call waiting.&nbsp; She hung up and raced
over to the house, picked him up and sped away.</b>
<br><b>John and Mary told me the whole story at my house a few days later.&nbsp;
John, not one to like to show "weakness", actually cried as he told me
the stories of the house.&nbsp; When they asked me what I thought, I just
looked at them dumbfoundedly and said, "You and Bill should get the hell
out - now."&nbsp; He had other places he could live, so why would he stay
there?&nbsp; I don't know if it's a male trait or what, but he decided
to stay there, at least a while longer, maybe he could figure out what
was going on, maybe even stop it.&nbsp; Mary agreed with me that at least
she should never go back there.&nbsp; John seemed disappointed by that,
but understood.&nbsp; She only went over a few more times, but only in
the daytime and only for very short periods.&nbsp; She asked me to go a
few times, but I completely refused.&nbsp; There was no way.</b>
<br><b>Finally, maybe a few weeks or a month later, John and Bill did both
move out.&nbsp; The house had stayed creepy and they never stopped hearing
noises.&nbsp; They'd see something outside at night once in a while, but
nothing distinct.&nbsp; They had begun to hear stories from other people
who had lived in Cabana Colony who had similar stories - noises, weird
things moving about the neighborhood.&nbsp; One girl even said that while
she was a teenager living there, she'd been attacked by something while
she was in her bed.&nbsp; She woke up to a pain in her leg and looked down
to see huge scratches going down her thigh.&nbsp; She couldn't find anything
in her bed that she could have scraped against to do that and she was under
the covers when it happened.</b>
<br><b>I have no idea if this creepiness is still happening in Cabana Colony,
and I have no desire to find out personally.</b>

<br><b>proper permits... One night when Calvin decided to go to bed he</b>
<br><b>needed to go to the bathroom. He decided to get outta bed and leave</b>
<br><b>the room. He started to hear whispers and moans. He freaked out
and</b>
<br><b>ran full speed to the door. It was locked. But oddly there was no</b>
<br><b>lock to his door. He cried for help but none came. The lights</b>
<br><b>flickered and he ran back to his bed and hid under the covers. The</b>
<br><b>lights totally went dark and his bed began to shake. Calvin was</b>
<br><b>paralyzed. A red mist started to grow above him. Calvin began to
try</b>
<br><b>and "fight it" but it was no use. He began to hear vicous</b>

<br><b>Family Ghost</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: slee@dallastelco.org</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>My story isn't unusual.&nbsp; At least in my family it isn't.&nbsp;
My father died in</b>
<br><b>1997 from cancer.&nbsp; He tried to get my brother and myself ready
for his</b>
<br><b>death.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, I was definitely not ready.&nbsp;
My dad died in June.</b>
<br><b>Everything was going along quietly for several months then in October
of the</b>
<br><b>same year I was sitting outside of my job waiting for a ride home.&nbsp;
It was</b>
<br><b>after midnight.&nbsp; I was completely relaxed not thinking of a
thing and I feel</b>
<br><b>a hand on my shoulder.&nbsp; I turned around and there was my dad,
standing there</b>
<br><b>plain as day.&nbsp; He told me that I was going to be fine and that
he loved me.</b>
<br><b>I have seen him several times since then.&nbsp; He always comes
to visit me on</b>
<br><b>Halloween, sometimes he comes in physical form (so I can see him
like the</b>
<br><b>first time) and sometimes, and it is just his voice.</b>
<br><b>This isn't the only ghost around me.&nbsp; I have a spirit that
has followed me</b>
<br><b>around for years.&nbsp; I do not think she is any relation to me.&nbsp;
The only thing</b>
<br><b>she has ever done is open doors.&nbsp; I first started noticing
her as a child.</b>
<br><b>I was around 8 years old.&nbsp; I would start seeing doors open
that I know I</b>
<br><b>closed.&nbsp; I would close and lock a door and not a minute later
it would be</b>
<br><b>wide open.&nbsp; I didn't really know what to think about this.&nbsp;
A few years</b>
<br><b>later I started getting curious and asked what I could call it,(I
didn't</b>
<br><b>even know if it was a female or male).&nbsp; The next morning I
wake up with a</b>
<br><b>name on my lips, George.&nbsp; Of course I think that this means
it is male, not</b>
<br><b>so.&nbsp; When I learned later of how some people contact the sprits
I went into</b>
<br><b>a trance and found out that this was actually a female spirit.&nbsp;
She is still</b>
<br><b>with me today.&nbsp; She doesn't come around with any regularity
but every once</b>
<br><b>in a while a door will pop open, even with the deadbolt locked.</b>

<p><b>Florian</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: tiffanyscott00@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>

</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever I go to
my Aunt Cathy's house, I get sort of a strange feeling.&nbsp; It's there
where I started to believe in paranormal activity. It all started one average
summer trip out to Wisconsin. At first I didn't believe it when my cousin
Jess tried to tell me about the ghost in his house.&nbsp; He told me about
a man named Florien and how he had died of a heart attack in a rocking
chair in the living room some years ago.&nbsp; The first thing I saw that
made me start believing was his cat.&nbsp; Jess and I were sitting in the
room together when the cat started looking around at something that was
on the ceiling.&nbsp; We looked to see what it was, but we saw nothing.&nbsp;
We watched the cat for several minutes, he just sat there staring at something
above him, his head moving every couple of seconds to a different spot
on the ceiling.&nbsp; It was then when I really started to wonder.&nbsp;
Now, the cat was one thing, but what really scared me was later on that
night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Since I was the guest I had to sleep in the living room.......only
feet away from where Florien had died years ago.&nbsp; Jess was sitting
on a chair watching T.V. When I fell asleep on the couch.&nbsp; I found
myself being awaked by Jess, he was terrified.&nbsp; He told me that Florien
had just played a rotten little joke on him.&nbsp; To know that it wasn't
just another person, you have to visualize the setup of my aunt&#8217;s house.
From where ever you sat in the living room, where we were, you could see
the rest of the house.&nbsp; There is a cut out in the wall, sort of like
that of a concession stand, only this one allows you to see into the kitchen,
down the hall, and into the rest of the house, so there is nowhere for
a person to run and hide.&nbsp; Anyway, Jess told me he was just about
asleep when he heard a very loud BANG! He jumped up and looked down the
hall, he saw no one.&nbsp; He could recognize the sounds of the stove and
the fridge as two of the doors that were slammed in the kitchen.&nbsp;
He then walked into the kitchen and saw that all of the cub bard doors,
along with the stove and fridge were all halfway open.&nbsp; The loud BANG
was the sound of all of the doors in the kitchen being slammed shut at
the exact same time. It was after he had finished shutting all of the doors
in the kitchen when he came and woke me up to tell me what he saw. Now
after I had really started to believe in ghosts I really wanted to see
one. It mad me upset that everyone else was seeing him and not me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A few nights later I was about to fall asleep in a
bedroom at the end of the hallway, when I saw something come into my room.&nbsp;
It looked like the shadowy, transparent figure of a man.&nbsp; But, at
that time I was so tiered and scared that I shut my eyes and fell to sleep.&nbsp;
It wasn't until the next morning that I realized I had just seen Florien.&nbsp;
I thought to myself, well I wanted to see him, and I did.&nbsp; Those are
only a couple of many stories about Florien at that house.&nbsp; All I
can say is I can't wait to go back there again!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Family Happenings</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: tinker46@adelphia.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>

</p><p><b>The first odd thing that happened to me was in 1960 or thereabouts
when I was a child.&nbsp; I was in bed in the top bunk and my parents were
down the hall in their bedroom with one reading light on.&nbsp; I wasn't
particularly sleepy so I was just lying there thinking about the day and
planning the next day when I noticed some odd shadows on the ceiling.&nbsp;
The only light source was around two corners from my room, yet the shadows
came into the room and around the corner and danced wildly around the ceiling
for about five or six minutes.&nbsp; Perhaps it is better to say light
was dancing around the ceiling rather than shadows since the room would
normally have been dark.&nbsp; I wasn't afraid at all, just awed.&nbsp;
There were no mirrors or shiny objects in the hall that could have reflected
light, even if there had been some moving light in their room.&nbsp; Does
anyone have any idea what it could have been?</b>
<br><b>Some years later my parents divorced and I only saw my dad two or
three times in the next fifteen years.&nbsp; One night my mom dreamed that
my dad was in a body of water and reached up and held onto her ankle and
called her name, then let go and went under.&nbsp; We later learned that
he died that night.&nbsp; He drowned.</b>
<br><b>My son was very close to his paternal grandmother and she seemed
to think the sun rose and set with him.&nbsp; One night my son dreamed
so vividly that he thought he was awake, that his dad had come to tell
him that his Grandma had died.&nbsp; He remembers getting up to answer
the door and talking with his dad and going back to sleep in great sadness.&nbsp;
That day he told all of his friends that his Grandma had died and later
that evening his dad knocked on the door and came in to tell him the news.&nbsp;
My son said, "You told me already."&nbsp; His dad had not told him.&nbsp;
It had just happened a few hours before.</b>
<br><b>I have also had some odd experiences with palm reading and things
like that.&nbsp; I used to love to dress as a witch on Halloween (because
Halloween is my birthday) and after a few drinks I would start telling
fortunes.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could only do it after drinking -- probably because
I was more receptive to the intuitive and less analytical.&nbsp; One of
the most astonishing was when I read the palms of a young couple and told
the woman that she would have two children.&nbsp; I then looked at her
husband's palm and said, "You're going to have three children.&nbsp; Do
you have one somewhere we don't know about?"&nbsp; He chuckled a little
nervously and said, "Not that I know of."&nbsp; I didn't give it another
thought until a year or so later when the woman called to tell me that
her husband was being sued for paternity and the child was nearly the same
age as their son.&nbsp; They later had one more child and I'm willing to
bet it is their last.</b>
<br><b>Another time was sad for me.&nbsp; I had been seeing a wonderful
man for about eight years and although I valued him very much, I was not
"in love" with him.&nbsp; On a whim (it wasn't even Halloween :-)&nbsp;
) I decided to read his palm.&nbsp; I said a few things then said. "Oh
no!&nbsp; You're going to get married next year.&nbsp; I'm going to miss
you."&nbsp; He said, "How do you know I'm not going to marry you?"&nbsp;
I didn't answer.&nbsp; I didn't want to be married, but I miss him very
much to this day.&nbsp; He did marry within a year.</b>
<br><b>I've lived in my current house for about fifteen years and the first
few weeks I lived here were sometimes very uncomfortable.&nbsp; I would
hear footsteps going up the stairs, footsteps in the hall outside my bedroom
and odd noises that I couldn't attribute to settling.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had
a pretty little bedroom that was by far the most attractive but one in
which I wouldn't sleep and didn't like being in at all.&nbsp; In it was
a "touch" lamp -- the kind that you merely touch on any metal part to turn
it on or off.&nbsp; I began to notice it being on when I was sure I hadn't
turned it on so I assumed that one of my cats had done it.&nbsp; I started
closing the door to keep the cats out but the light kept coming on.&nbsp;
Finally, one evening there was such a racket of stomping and banging in
the hall outside my bedroom that I curled up on my bed in terror and prayed
and told the entity to go to the light.&nbsp; It took several minutes during
which I nearly resolved to sell the house and get out but slowly I became
calm and peaceful and there haven't been any more instances since then.</b>
<br><b>Maybe someday I will write a few more but that is enough for now.&nbsp;
Thanks for reading.</b>

<br><b>Footsteps on the Stairs</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: gmpjmp@hotmail.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>This first happened to me one bright sunny morning while visiting
my mother in a home she purchased, the house was built in the early 1800's
and had several wings with the guest bedrooms located upstairs.</b>
<br><b>I had spent the night in one of the wings that had only two bedrooms
on it. There were two flights of stairs comming up to the bedrooms. The
stairs were not carpeted and made with oak flooring.</b>
<br><b>As I made the bed I had slept in the night before, I heard footsteps
comming up the stairs, and proceed down the hallway to the room I was in.
I had my back turned toward the door and could not see who it was, but
knowing that only my mother and I were alone in the house I assumed mom
had come upstairs, without turning around I told "mom" that I would be
finished in just a moment, I then heard the footsteps resume and walk across
the hall to the other bedroom. I heard the other door open and close. Thinking
it odd that mom had not spoken to me, I finished tucking in the sheet,
and followed her across to the other room. It was empty.</b>
<br><b>Now I was really puzzled. There was no way my mother could have
gotten past me and down two flights of stairs in less than two minutes.
So I leaned over the railing and called out to her. No answer. I found
her at the far end of the house in the kitchen reading the paper and drinking
a cup of coffee. When I questioned her about comming upstairs, she said
she had been downstairs all morning and really didn't know what I was talking
about.</b>
<br><b>I know I heard hardsoled shoes comming up those stairs and down
that hallway. I know I heard the other bedroom door open and shut. I know
we were the only two people in the house.</b>
<br><b>We never spoke of this to my children, but they refuse to play in
their playroom in the other upstairs wing, because they say they hear footsteps
and things.</b>
<br><b>Nothing other than footsteps. But&nbsp; whose footsteps?</b><b></b>

<br><b>Get Out</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: adoringpath2@msn.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>This isn't much but when I was 12 yrs. old I was in my sisters room
at night. The fan was on and I went beside it and was cleaning. When I
heard a voice say " get out ". But I didn't and I was so scared I couldn't
move for like a minute. And couldn't have been any of my sisters because
they were in the living room. It was a man's voice and I have no brothers.
Now I'm 13 and I really believe in ghosts after that. It didn't happen
any more, which was weird.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Gettysburg Energy Spot</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: Greytraveller@aol.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the summer of 1982
I was travelling north through Tennessee. It was July and I had just been
discharged from the army (Ft.. Benning, GA.) I had visited many Civil War
battlefields but had never been to Stones River. So as I was in that area
I decided to spend part of a day there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stones River / Murfreesboro
was a major battle fought over 2 days at the end of 1862. Yet I knew little
about the battle or the battlefield. I got there about midmorning - maybe
10:00 AM. It was either Tuesday or Wednesday (midweek). I drove into the
main parking lot near the visitors center. My car faced the visitor center.
Before going into the visitor center I stopped to take a quick look around.
There were only 6 to 8 vehicles to be seen.</b>
<br><b>Turning around facing away from the visitor center I could see a
woods about 75 yards away. To the right of this woods was an open field
which was part of the national battlefield.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I was just about to turn
back around and head in toward the visitor center I saw three men walking
near the woods. That area was heavily shaded so I could not see them all
that clearly. What was immediately noticeable about them was that at least
two men were carrying rifles. One had his rifle slung over one shoulder.
A second figure was holding his rifle with one hand down at his side. I
could not be sure if a third figure was carrying a</b>
<br><b>weapon. It appeared that at least one man had on a wide brimmed
hat though the other two were probably bareheaded.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw them for only few seconds
then they seemingly walked back into the woods and disappeared. Though
I was momentarily taken off-guard I soon decided that there must be some
type of reenactment going on that day. Or maybe it was park rangers dressed
up to give a firearms demonstration. I made a mental note to ask someone
in the visitor center about this.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 30 to 40 minutes later
I had gone through the vistor center and was about ready to leave to take
a driving tour of the battlefield. Before going out I asked the receptionist
/ hostess at the information booth if there was a reenactment schedualed
that day. She said no there was not. I asked if there was some type of
demonstration with park rangers dressed up in Civil War uniforms. She again
said no. Finally I asked if there might be</b>
<br><b>anyone on or near the battlefield that would be dressed in Civil
War uniforms or carrying Civil War rifles. She said there were no reenactments
schedualed that week nor were there any park rangers giving demostrations.
Not wanting to make a big deal out of this I let it go at that. To this
day there seems to be no reasonable explanation for what I saw other than
to admit the probability that those were Civil War phantoms - three ghosts
haunting the Murfreesboro battlefield.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghost Appears</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>

<p><b>By: Theresa.Craig@uboc.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>Hello!</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>My husband, son and I currently rent a house owned by friends of
ours, in</b>
<br><b>South Pasadena, California.&nbsp; This house was built in 1865 (
to put it in</b>
<br><b>perspective - the same year Abraham Lincoln was assassinated).&nbsp;
The house</b>
<br><b>pre-dates the city of South Pasadena, and from what we know has
a rich</b>
<br><b>history which includes several owners.&nbsp; Our friends have owned
it now for</b>
<br><b>over 30 years, 25 of those years were rented to a gentleman name
Herbert</b>
<br><b>Molino.&nbsp; The gentleman lived very happily in that house, until
about 7</b>
<br><b>years ago when after an illness, he was taken to the hospital where
he</b>
<br><b>died.&nbsp; His son, a struggling artist, lived in the house for
the next 6</b>
<br><b>years, until after defaulting on the rent many many times, our friends
had</b>
<br><b>to ask him to leave.&nbsp; My husband, who was doing contracting
and electrical</b>
<br><b>repairs on the house at the time, said that the son expressed to
him how</b>
<br><b>sad he was to have to leave.&nbsp; Perhaps I know why.</b>
<br><b>My husband and I moved in, and soon I became pregnant.&nbsp; While
my husband</b>
<br><b>was making repairs in our bedroom, we had to sleep in my stepchildren's</b>
<br><b>room (since they live with their mother, they visit us every other</b>
<br><b>weekend).&nbsp; The bedroom is next to the front door of the house.&nbsp;
I slept in</b>
<br><b>my Stepson's bed which was against one wall in the room closest
to the</b>
<br><b>front door, while my husband slept in the bottom of the girl's bunkbed,</b>
<br><b>along the opposite wall of the room.&nbsp; One night, awoke in the
middle of the</b>
<br><b>night, and as my eyes opened I could see there was a tall gentleman
walking</b>
<br><b>towards me, through the dining room, through the living room - up
to the</b>
<br><b>front door which was essentially where the foot of my bed was.&nbsp;
At first, I</b>
<br><b>called out my husband's name, because in my sleep I thought it was
him.</b>
<br><b>When he responded from the opposite end of the room, across from
where I</b>
<br><b>saw the figure, I realized that it was not my husband.&nbsp; As
I recalled the</b>
<br><b>detail of what I saw, I realize that I don't know why I even thought
it</b>
<br><b>could be him.&nbsp; The person I saw was taller than my husband,
slimmer, and</b>
<br><b>had short black hair.&nbsp; My husband's hair is down to his waist.&nbsp;
The person</b>
<br><b>I saw was walking looking downward, towards the front door, where
he</b>
<br><b>disappeared.&nbsp; I was not frightened by the apparition, because
the person</b>
<br><b>didn't look threatening or menacing at all.&nbsp; Sort of like someone
walking</b>
<br><b>around the&nbsp; house while the family sleeps, to check on things,
or as if he</b>
<br><b>was simply leaving the house.&nbsp; Some time later, my husband
found a photo</b>
<br><b>album and a military medal.&nbsp; A picture of the gentleman smiling
was in it.</b>
<br><b>It matched the person I saw that night.</b><b></b>

<p><b>School Spirit</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: tearstaindwings [aquariusyay@netscape.net]</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've had a great deal of experiences but this
one is the funnest one to talk about because there were a couple of witnesses.&nbsp;
This happened my senior year of high school in Texas.&nbsp; The first experience
was when a friend of mine and i were staying late one night to work on
a wall decoration for homecoming (i wouldn't have done it but she begged
me).&nbsp; Anyway, she got her video camera and we turned off all of the
hall lights just to play around because her camera was one of those kind
that you can see stuff in the dark, we were walking down to the commons
and we thought we saw something move in the spanish hall so we turned around
and started walking towards there and we didn't see anything but we filmed
it anyway, then when we played the tape we saw a really skinny guy walk
past the back windows to the exit.&nbsp; We knew there was nothing there
because it was just us and ricky (the janitor, he was so cool).&nbsp; It
so freaked out that she refused to go back into the school after hours
to finish the wall decoration.&nbsp; I didn't think anymore about it until
one night at around 9pm at the school, we stayed alittle after choir practice
to help the choir director with some files and computer problems, we were
leaving when we heard someone whisper loudly "HEY!!!" we thought it was
our director calling us but we turned around and no one was there, we went
back to the choir room and asked if she had called us and she said no she
had been recording tapes for the sopranos so we started to leave and i
heard someone whisper my name loudly, i turned around quickly and no one
was there.&nbsp; My friend asked me what was wrong with me and i said,
"someone just called my name." she said. "oh really? i didn't hear anything."&nbsp;
We just shrugged it off and left (we were BOTH used to weird things happening
to us).&nbsp; The next week in chemistry our teacher was lecturing and
i all of a sudden heard this squeaking noise behind me i looked back and
i didn't see anything then i heard it again and my lab partner turned around
so i thought "wow he heard it too" i turned around right after he did and
we saw one of the stools on the table move about 5 inches.&nbsp; We turned
back around to listen to the teacher and when class was over i asked "did
that stool move?" he calmly said "yeah" and i said "wow that was crazy"
and he said "yeah i know" and we walked to our theatre class.&nbsp; A lot
of other things happened but im not going to get into them. After the stool
moving i was decided to see if anything had ever happened in the school
that might leave a little dweller.&nbsp; Every teacher i asked said nothing
has ever happened in the school and then i asked my english teacher and
she told me about the boy that died in auto mechanics.&nbsp; I don't remember
the year but she said that the auto mechanics class used to have water
gun fights in class after their work was done, the instructor told them
to watch out for the power boxes and to not get near them.&nbsp; Well blah
blah blah they accidentally hit one of them and the guy nearest to them
was electrocuted.&nbsp; I thought "what a horrible way to die!!!"&nbsp;
So i decided to take my friend with me one night after choir practice and
we went to the auto mechanics room and immediately we started hearing sounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then i got this feeling that we weren't alone and that whoever was there
was really scared. The boy that died was named Jonathan so we called out
to him and said "Jonathan are you here?" and we heard some more sounds
so we took that as a yes.&nbsp; We sat down and calmly said "Jonathan we're
not here to hurt you we are just here to tell you that we know you're still
here and that we are glad you are watching over us and protecting us."&nbsp;
A feeling of calmness came over us and i asked if he was ok and i heard
a whisper say "yes".&nbsp; I've always read stories about a spirit whispering
to someone and i just thought it was a misty- in the background whisper
but when you actually hear it, it sounds like just a normal person whispering,
its freaky.&nbsp; Anyway, we told him that it was ok to pass on and that
we will hold him in our hearts forever.&nbsp; Since then we haven't heard
about a single sighting from anyone so i guess he's gone but i could be
wrong.&nbsp; Remember, this isn't my only experience so ill probably write
again soon :)</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghost of Murdered Girl?</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: stephanieturnermadison@yahoo.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>When I was in senior in college in 1995, I lived in a apartment that
I believe was&nbsp; haunted. Strangely, though, the phenomena only lasted
about a week, and didn't occur until after I had been living there over
a year.</b>
<br><b>One night I took a cab home from the computer lab, where I had been
writing a paper. The cab driver recognized the address I had given him
as the address of a particularly gory rape/murder of a young college student
back in the early '80s, and&nbsp; told me some details about the murder.
(the murder was solved and the murderer put in jail.)&nbsp; Not wanting
to believe that it was my apartment building, I decided that either he
was trying to scare me, or he had the wrong address. I had been living
in the apartment about a half-year and had experienced nothing, so I tried
to put the story out of my mind. When it was time to renew my lease, I
did.</b>
<br><b>During the following year, I fell into a deep depression. It was
the darkest time in my life. But by spring, I was beginning to feel better.
One afternoon, I was lying on my bed writing in my day planner when I felt
a slap on the arm. Startled, I thought I had had some sort of bizarre muscle
spasm. I ignored it. The next afternoon, also while lying on bed doing
homework, I felt two hands touch my waist (I could feel the fingers) and
then physically roll me over. The following night, after studying late,
I climbed in bed and heard this strange groaning noise.</b>
<br><b>The apartment was set up like a co-op. I rented the bedroom, but
shared a kitchen and bath with two other people. There was no living room
or den where I could go! All I had was the room! But for the next several
days I slept on the floor in the bedroom of one of my housemates.</b>
<br><b>I confronted my landlord, and he confirmed that a woman had been
killed in the room, but said no one else had ever complained. He also said
that the rental company could sue me if I told anyone about what happened.
Because I had signed the lease the second time, after already hearing about
a possible murder, he made it sound like it would be hard for me to break
the lease (which is crazy, since things were fine at the time I signed
it!) Anyway, the company could always say I imagined it after being spooked
by the story.</b>
<br><b>So I stayed in the room for the rest of the lease, but slept with
the lights on. I also wrote a "Dear Ghost, you are scaring me" letter and
tacked it to the wall. Nothing happened again.</b>
<br><b>To this day, I wonder if the depression was related to living in
a room where so much sadness and violence had occurred.&nbsp; Incidentally,
the woman was found in a pool of blood on her bed. I believe her bed was
in the same place as mine, as the odd shape of the room, the location of
its two doors, big closet and two sets of windows, didn't allow for much
choice in layout.</b>
<br><b>The truth is, when I first heard about the murder, it did scare
me, but quite a few months had passed, and I kind of forgot about it. By
the time the "weird stuff" started to happen, I had put the story out of
my mind. And as I said, most of the events happened in the middle of the
afternoon! Who gets spooked in a sunlit room while doing homework?!</b>
<br><b>Since then, I have read all of the newspaper clippings about her
murder at the newspaper's library. The woman was killed by her friend's
boyfriend after using drugs with him. (He had a previous rape conviction
that noone knew about at the time). I don't want to mention the victim's
name, because her parents are still living and in the area.</b>

<br><b>Ghost or Guardian Angel</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: Rds0197@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>

</p><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was 15 yrs old my best friend died.&nbsp; She
had a cancer tumor in her</b>
<br><b>spinal cord and lived for apporoximately 1yr w/ it (paralized from
the neck</b>
<br><b>down).&nbsp; Finally, she went into a coma for about a week then
died.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Not too long after she had died (a few months?) my
mom was going to drive</b>
<br><b>me to school because it was foggy and cold.&nbsp; My mom sometimes
had a hard time</b>
<br><b>w/ getting her car into reverse.&nbsp; This particular morning was
one of those</b>
<br><b>times.&nbsp; I was in the passenger seat and she was struggling
to get the car in</b>
<br><b>reverse to get out of the driveway.&nbsp; I felt like time had sort
of stood still</b>
<br><b>for a few moments.&nbsp; At first it felt like deja vu - kind of
- I just felt</b>
<br><b>like I knew something wierd was going to happen any second and I
felt like I</b>
<br><b>just KNEW it was Michelle (my friend that died) so I didn't feel
"panicked"</b>
<br><b>or anything.&nbsp; Then I felt 2 cold fingers (middle &amp; index
fingers from a left</b>
<br><b>hand) from the back seat reach up to my neck and press on the left
side of my</b>
<br><b>neck.&nbsp; For some reason I knew that this person just wanted
to check for my</b>
<br><b>pulse to make sure I was OK.&nbsp; I know you don't normally check
for a pulse on</b>
<br><b>the neck - usually you check on the wrist.&nbsp; But I felt totally
OK w/ it and</b>
<br><b>just let it happen.&nbsp; Then I sarted to feel like I was coming
back to reality</b>
<br><b>and seemed to sort of "wake up" to realize that my mom was still
struggling</b>
<br><b>w/ getting the car in reverse.&nbsp; I sat there and just thought
about what had</b>
<br><b>just happened and felt like I had just waken up from a dream and
when I</b>
<br><b>realized that I wasn't asleep I asked my mom why she just did that
to me</b>
<br><b>(press my neck) and she said "What are you talking about? I've been
trying to</b>
<br><b>get this car in reverse!"&nbsp; I knew she didn't do it and I don't
know why I</b>
<br><b>asked her if she did.&nbsp; I told her what happened and I don't
even remember</b>
<br><b>what she said in response to it.&nbsp; She must have finally gotten
the car into</b>
<br><b>reverse or something but just that whole sense of time was really

<p><b>Ghost or Mirage</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>

</p><p><b>This past summer sometime during the evening I was riding my bike
and saw what looked like a girl wearing a yellow dress with orange flowers
on it running toward me along the sidewalk. I had only ridden a few feet
when she just disappeared. The next day I told my best friend what happened.
That night she slept over my house. We decided to go outside for a while.
She was on one side while I was on the other. I had my back turned to her
and I was helping my little sister with her cheers and I had my back turned
to my friend. All of a sudden I heard my friend scream. When I asked her
what was wrong she said that she had seen a little girl beside the gate
that she could almost see through and when she tried to get closer the
girl disappeared. My friend has been known to stretch the truth so I don't
really know if she's telling the truth. My sister also said that she saw
the same little girl in a dream that she had. Please print this story.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghost Stories</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: commandokrig@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>

</p><p><b>Hiyas, I've got a few interesting stories, non of them where directly</b>
<br><b>related to me, but I did see the results of them.</b>
<br><b>The first story comes from a camp I work at in the summer, it's
a Boy Scout</b>
<br><b>Ranch near Colorado Springs.&nbsp; The camp was built upon Indian
holy grounds,</b>
<br><b>very holy grounds.&nbsp; There are four things here, a formation
of trees known</b>
<br><b>as the Circle of Trees that have one tree in each direction (N,
S, E, W)</b>
<br><b>that circle a small stump.&nbsp; The northern tree is infamous as
it is known as</b>
<br><b>the Death Tree, as a general rule non of the staff EVER approaches
the</b>
<br><b>Circle of Trees from the north direction, we always enter from the
south.</b>
<br><b>The story goes that if you approach the Death Tree from the north
you or</b>
<br><b>someone close to you will have a horrible event that may lead to
a death.</b>
<br><b>When you look at the Death Tree you can see why it has its name,
the tree is</b>
<br><b>covered in Dwarf Miseltoe(?) and has been struck by lightning atleast
three</b>
<br><b>times.&nbsp; The other trees are wonderful pine trees, just standing
in the</b>
<br><b>center you feel overcome with a peaceful feeling, its like all your
troubles</b>
<br><b>vanish and it is perfectly silent.</b>
<br><b>The next sotry is about objects that are named for what they look
like,</b>
<br><b>Coyote Stump, Deer Tree, Bear Rock, and Wolf Stump.&nbsp; Each one
of those looks</b>
<br><b>EXACTLY like the animal they are named for, most of the staff knows
by heart</b>
<br><b>the location of Wolf Stump and Coyote Stump, but only two people
(who no</b>
<br><b>longer work there) know where Deer Tree and Bear Rock are.&nbsp;
Now its written</b>
<br><b>in stone never to touch Coyote Stump, if you do so something bad
always</b>
<br><b>happens and Coyotes always appear near the stump that night.&nbsp;
The stump</b>
<br><b>looks exactly like a Coyote and even its shadow looks like a Coyote,
from</b>
<br><b>any direction.&nbsp; One staff member who didnt believe in the tale
kicked the</b>
<br><b>stump one night, his mother died shortly after.&nbsp; He never went
near the</b>
<br><b>stump ever again.&nbsp; Another time as another staff member and
I where walking</b>
<br><b>down the trail where the stump is found, we saw it laying at a very</b>
<br><b>different way then it normally sits, we decided to right it to where
it was,</b>
<br><b>we did so and went to bed.&nbsp; That night we hear Coyotes avidly
everywhere, it</b>
<br><b>was like they surrounded the camp.&nbsp; Nothing bad happened to
either of us,</b>
<br><b>something good happened instead I recieved wonderful gift from my
parents, I</b>
<br><b>dont know what happened to the other guy.</b>
<br><b>We know nothing exactly about Wolf Stump, but we do know that messing
with</b>
<br><b>it results in wolves appearing, wolves never appear anywhere within
100</b>
<br><b>miles of the camp either.</b>
<br><b>Another thing is Cowboy's Cave.&nbsp; The story about the cave is
that when we</b>
<br><b>had a big game of CTF going a couple staff came upon the cave, inside
they</b>
<br><b>saw what looked like an old man in a cowboy outfit, but he was hazy,
they</b>
<br><b>bolted from there like rabbits.</b>
<br><b>Not scary stories, but they are interesting to some people I know,
one of</b>
<br><b>these days I'm going to try and find out more about the land.</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>Oh, along the enterance road to the camp are the 12 points of the
scout law</b>
<br><b>signs, the last point entering the camp is "Reverant", it's been
struck by</b>
<br><b>lighting at least 7 times.&nbsp; Heh.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted Apartment</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: free998us2@netscape.net</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>Hello, my name is Stacey and I would like to tell you a couple of
stories about an Appartment that My husaband and (at the time 2 years old)
Daughter Tailor now she is four.</b>
<br><b>1 1/2 year before I met my husband Todd.&nbsp; He moved in the same
appartment building accrossed from where we all had the exsperince of the
unexplaned.&nbsp; But Just to let you know he didn't tell me the sightings
that he had until after I started to see and feel and heard/Seen what happened
to my daughter Tailor.</b>
<br><b>Philadephia PA. Silverwood street,&nbsp; Was known to be on of the
many places that George Washington had stayed at. As we know of it now
it is an Appartment Building.&nbsp; As you walk up the 5 steps to the porch
you can see it was a very old house and the structer if it.&nbsp; You would
walk in and it has a very large stair case.&nbsp; you would find on the
lower level 2 apartments and you would then walk up the stairs to the second
floor.&nbsp; The door at the top would be our apartment.&nbsp; but I will
get to that.</b>
<br><b>I will start with Todd's first.&nbsp; He was at the second floor
apartment down the hall.&nbsp; Very small more like an effencey.&nbsp;
The first night he moved in.&nbsp; He was all finished moving things in
and now he was tired.&nbsp; He went in the room and laid down.&nbsp; He
then just fell espleep when he felt something right in front of his face,
he then open his eyes and what he said that he saw was a little boy no
older the 10.&nbsp; he saw an outline of a 10 year old boy that was knealing
down with hands on knees like he was looking for something.&nbsp; Todd
then let out a gasp of air not realising that he was holding his breath
the boy look up at him and the ran out of the room passing the light switch
and TURNED IT ON!!!!!!.</b>
<br><b>Todd then said that all he was able to do was pull the covers over
his head.&nbsp; The next insident was when he was at some friends house
two doors down he told them it was getting late and he was going home to
bed,&nbsp; That was like 130 am.&nbsp; He told his friend that was staying
with him to come when ever and threw him the key.</b>
<br><b>At 5:30am Todd was sleeping and he was tossing and turning and tried
to pull up the covers over his one shoulder.&nbsp; He couldn't the was
something at the foot of the bed that was stopping him from doing so..&nbsp;
So he thought it was is friend that was staying at his house and so he
used his foot to kick him off.&nbsp; Then looked up to ask his friend why
was he on the foot of his bed.....&nbsp; NOTHING WAS THERE&gt;&nbsp; LIGHT
WENT ON AGAIN.&nbsp; Todd Left and went to the house two doors down.</b>
<br><b>Now thats where I came in.&nbsp; Todd has been in this apartment
more then a year and nothing has happend till I came.&nbsp; As you entered
the apartment you would come in the door on a angle.&nbsp; the couch in
front of you the a hall way left of the couch which led to the kitchen
on the right and the bathroom in front of you.&nbsp; the bedroom was threw
the living room....</b>
<br><b>When I first started to feel things I didn't want to say anything
I didn't want any one think I was crazy.&nbsp; I didn't know how Todd felt
about these things so I kept my mouth shut.&nbsp; But I would be sitting
on the couch and on the door of the apartment to come in we had a mirror
which you could see down the hall way to the bath room and kitchen.</b>
<br><b>as I would be sitting there watching TV, I would see a shadow of
someone or something out the corner of my eye.&nbsp; at first I thought
ok whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well I still didn't have the nerve to tell Todd.&nbsp;
I would see it all the time now&nbsp; I was getting concerned, scared.&nbsp;
One night we had friends over.&nbsp; In our living room we had baseball
caps hung up on the wall with Hook nails. Then we were all sitting there.&nbsp;
Then all the hats started to pop off the wall.&nbsp; Now at first when
the first one came of we that the nail came out but it didn't so I picked
it back up and then sat back down again,&nbsp; the another then another.&nbsp;
we all ran out to the back porch.&nbsp; Stayed there for an hour our friends
went home.&nbsp;&nbsp; That night Tailor fell esleep on the couch.&nbsp;
We thought that she would be ok.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well we were wrong...</b>
<br><b>At 3:00am&nbsp; she woke us up by pounding on the door crying hysticaly.&nbsp;
I couldn't believe it.&nbsp; Then no sooner that she came into our room
she went right to sleep.&nbsp; For about a week at the same time she would
wake us up like that.&nbsp; I didn't think anything about it.&nbsp; I thought
that maybe that she was dreaming but everyday for a week?</b>
<br><b>I was taking Tailor to school in the morning on the following Monday
she then came out and said to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now mind you this is a 2
year old tell me this.&nbsp; She said to me&nbsp;&nbsp; " Mommy, I don't
like the big man."&nbsp; I then said to her, What big man?&nbsp; Daddy?&nbsp;
She said, "No"&nbsp; The black man".&nbsp; I couldn't believe I was hearing
this.&nbsp; I then got to her school and she then started to climb up on
a chair and stood on it.&nbsp; She then reached with one hand stratched
above her head and said.&nbsp; The this big.</b>
<br><b>I could feel my heart in my chest and my neck.&nbsp; I called todd
told him every thing.&nbsp; That night we had her on the couch again.&nbsp;
We also had a video camara hooked up leading to our VCR so we could record
on tape if there is anything.</b>
<br><b>that night Tailor didn't come to our room at 3:00 am she didn't
come at all.&nbsp; We thought ok whatever it was we scared it away.&nbsp;&nbsp;
WRONG!!!!&nbsp; We watched the movie that night.&nbsp; and it hard to explan
the tape with out watching it.&nbsp; But I would say you see everything
that she told us that happens to her every night.&nbsp; You also see that
video recorder goes out of focus and its trying to focus but can't.&nbsp;
There is a shadowy thing at the end of the couch by Tailors feet.&nbsp;
You see that the covers are moving by them selves.&nbsp; Then she is sitting
up asleep with nothing around her she throws her arms up at once and doesn't
fall.&nbsp; she then tries to bat something away from her.&nbsp; She then
gets thrown to the floor and then you see her head pass through a shadow
and then the shadow moves at her head then its gone.</b>
<br><b>Today tailor is 4 and she doesn't talk about it much but We did
move out of the apartment building with in a week.&nbsp; Tailor was never
the same after that.&nbsp; We believe that she has the gift to talk to
the "not living"&nbsp; She had never seen my mother nor knows her name.&nbsp;
Since my mother passed when I was at a very young age.&nbsp; she will go
and talk and have conversations with her self like she we would be talking
to some one.&nbsp; I would ask who she was talking to she will say my old
mother.&nbsp; I said oh ok then I heard her again at the dinner Table and
she was saying no I don't want too.&nbsp; No you do it.....&nbsp; I then
said what?&nbsp; Oh nothing mommy she would say talking to LINDA.&nbsp;
YES THATS MY MOTHERS NAME!!!!</b>
<br><b>Now only a little like the supper market she would be talking to
a little girl "KellY"&nbsp; And the name never changes when we go so I
have to believe in that. It doesn't bother me that if she can talk to spirts.&nbsp;
But I don't push her to do so.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghost or 4 People's Overactive Imagination?</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By; BrooklynCowgrrl@aol.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>Hello. I want to share some stories with you, because I believe that
my house is haunted. I'll share 3 accounts with you.</b>
<br><b>1.) This usually happens when only a friend or 2 friends and I are
alone in my house. My friend Kelly and I were at a blockparty with my parents
and younger brother. We got bored, so my dad drove us back to my house.
We were sitting on the computer when we heard the front door open and slam
shut. Kelly and I both looked at each other and asked if we heard the door
- we both did. I told her to wait in my room and I went out into the living
room to see (there are stairs leading up to the living room from the landing
where the front door is). No sign of anyone. This scared us pretty bad,
and we called my dad and he took us back to the block party. -- The front
door is a weather door, and sort of locks when the door is shut, so we
ruled out the possibility of wind. This happened to Kelly and I twice,
Kelly and my friend Jenn and I, and once tonight (12/15/02). My brother
and I are home alone. He's sitting in the living room watching a movie,
I i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.) My mom came home one night around 10:00. She got out of her car and
shut the door. She came into the house panic-stricken. "Did you call me?"
she asked. "No...." I gave her a skeptical look, and she said: "The weirdest
thing just happened... I heard someone call me, like 'Ma! Ma!' Like they
were hurt, you know?" This spooked me, but I wasn't sure at first what
to make of it. She stood there thinking for a while, then said: "Are you
sure you didn't call me?"</b>
<br><b>3.) I was lying in bed one night, and I'm a very light sleeper.
So, I was looking around my room, when I heard little scraping noises in
the attic. Sort of like an animal walking around with sharp little claws.
I sat up straight in bed and hardly slept that night. I told my dad about
it the next day, and he said it was raccoons. When I told my mom about
it some time after it happened, she said there were no raccoons, because
I always used that excuse (the raccoons). So, if it wasn't a raccoon......What
was it?</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghost Cat</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: Bdgray56@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>

</p><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greetings&nbsp; to Dave and Tina.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am ghostdreamer from Dallas, Texas.</b>
<br><b>The event I want to relate to you happened in 1997 in a house&nbsp;
I inherited</b>
<br><b>from my dad, who had died Jan. 27, 1997.&nbsp; I cannot remember
the monthbut,</b>
<br><b>this event was after his death..&nbsp;&nbsp; Me and my daughter
were living in the</b>
<br><b>house at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been living there since my
step-mom had died in</b>
<br><b>1987.&nbsp; My dad re-married in 1988 and moved out while I continued
to stay in</b>
<br><b>the house.&nbsp; I started dating a woman in '97 who eventually
(even through</b>
<br><b>these events) became my wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many supernatural
events happened during</b>
<br><b>the months following my dads' death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The appearance
of the ghostcat was</b>
<br><b>very significant and amazing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I&nbsp; got home from work one night and my daughter proceded
to tell me the</b>
<br><b>story of how she saw this ghostcat appear and walk around the floor,</b>
<br><b>seemingly out of thin air.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had psychic or paranormal
experiences</b>
<br><b>during my life, but I was skeptical about this event.&nbsp; I told
her that I</b>
<br><b>believed her but, in my mind, I was very skeptical.&nbsp;&nbsp;
That is until it</b>
<br><b>happened to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, I just got home from
work, sat down on the couch,</b>
<br><b>was alone in&nbsp; the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was watching the tv&nbsp;
when suddenly&nbsp; out of</b>
<br><b>nowhere, about two feet above the dining room table the apparition
or</b>
<br><b>whatever of a cat appeared.&nbsp; It was a grayish-colored translucent
full</b>
<br><b>-bodied cat.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was liesurely walking, as though climbing
steps.&nbsp; It was</b>
<br><b>floating (for lack of a better word)&nbsp; for no more than four
seconds, when it</b>
<br><b>just as suddenly disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp; My daughter had a pet
cat in the house but</b>
<br><b>she was under the coffee table at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat there
in awe and</b>
<br><b>dis-belief as my brain tried to discern what had just taken place.&nbsp;
I told my</b>
<br><b>future wife of the event.&nbsp;&nbsp; She then told me she had seen
the same type of</b>
<br><b>event happen a week earlier and had been afraid to tell me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I call the</b>
<br><b>apparition "ghostcat", but could it have been something else?&nbsp;
What we saw</b>
<br><b>exceeds the realm of physical possibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other events
happened in that</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; The ghostcat was the most phenomenal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My experience is peanuts</b>
<br><b>compared to some other people's, but ,nevertheless, extrordinary
in itself.</b>
<br><b>Thank you for providing me this venue for relating this event.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Happy</b>
<br><b>ghosting !</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghostly Experiences</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: carriew@ticon.net</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>I'm 14 years old and for as long as I can remember I have never been
able to sleep alone in the dark,It's because&nbsp; Of things I've seen
or heard that are unexplainable, the only logical explanation is their
ghosts. The oldest I can remember was when I was 8.My old House used to
be 120 years old , and&nbsp; in a tiny town with a sad history. In the
1800's a tornado went through it and destroyed it. It was a big train town.
Well anyway my room was always cold and at night it was so dark you couldn't
see anything.It made you so afraid to even take a breath.I always felt
watched. One night at midnight I awoke to see this Little boy about my
younger brothers age,Who was 4 and my other bothetr was 7.he looked to
be 4 and his face was blurry and legs to,He was dressed in old fashioned
clouths.I was so scared I was frozen and could'nt scream.Finally i was
Brave enough to get up andrun out of there.After that I couldn't sleep
for weeks and not alone either.I slept In school hours when the talked.I
was Sent to the school shrink they told me I dreamt it.My parents don't
believe in Ghosts niether do any of my family.So I've been the only one
to see.After that I never slept in that room again I slept on the couch.My
stuff would end ou missing to.Well then 5 years ago my father bought part
of his familys farm,which belonged to the family 3 generations.itr was
owned by other familys before thatand there old cellars found,ruins where
cabins weresince Wisconsin beacme astate.Before that the BlackHawk tribe
hunted and camped on our farmland.Well anyway there was purcahseed by my
great-great grandfather,they say he bought it when he was going crazy,he
was very old then though.There was no house here so my grandfather built
us a brand new house.I've experienced the unexplainable here.Since I was
8 I was interested in ghosts.There also more history to say before I tell
my other experiences ,there a grave here of a a baby boy in1901 ,Adam .My
mom said that was going to be my name if I was a boy,I also Almost died
when I was 1like Adam.Well anyway I have friend whos mother is a physic
she says I just attract ghosts.She says there evil that rooms in our woods.One
experince I had was with my friend by the ruins of a cabin in the woods.My
friend says you can record the voices of the dead on a taperecorder,so
we brought it to the cabin sight.We turned it on and we heard footsteps
and a heartbeat on it,it was louder in one spot.We asked it questions.It
whispered my name.my friend&nbsp; claims a week after the incident she
was possed by the spirit of the little girl we talked to.Her name was Abigail
Fremont and she was murdered.That was the same I kept hearing in my dreams.One
night I was in the woods.The woods is across the roads from my house .It
was night and there was a campfire and I heard voices and laughter therebut
I couldn't make out what they said.So I went over there where the campfire
was and there was nobody there and something pushed me.I ran out of there
as quik as I could.My freind says there spirit everwhere at m y home because
under my house is a portal,its where the sprits come from one world to
the next.One time I saw a chair move by itself. I heard singing ingerman
in the basement when no one was there and nobody in our household is fluent
in german.I saw theghost of a dog.Iheard noises in the kithcen.One day
in pure daylight I was sitting in my chair and talking 0n the phone.Above
my bed hovered a teenage girlin a dark blue dress with dark brown curls.I
felt this calming peace wash over me when I saw her.She disapeared in thin
air.My friend says her name was Marissa and her sweetheart fought in the
civil war&nbsp; and never came home.I have so many stories some of my own
and my friends.we've seen things that are strange.Things that are scary.</b>

<p><b>violin music warning</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: fssgcp@attglobal.net</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>In mid-September I was in Geneva Switzerland on a business trip,
and I was due to return home the day of my girl friends birthday.&nbsp;
For her birthday, I had purchased a violin, and I planned on giving it
to her after she picked me up from the airport (the violin was at my house).&nbsp;
The night before I was scheduled to return home, I called my girlfriend
but she was not home, so I left a message.&nbsp; After I hung up the phone,
the phone rang back in my room in Switzerland.&nbsp; I picked up the phone
but I did not here anything. After saying hello a couple times, I hung
the phone up.&nbsp; Later that night I again tried to call my girlfriend
and this time she was home.&nbsp; As we spoke, she told me that she had
received both my messages.&nbsp; Having only called once before, I was
very perplexed.&nbsp; I asked her what I said on the messages and she described
the first message that left to a tee, but she thought that I was teasing
her with the second message since she thought that I might be giving her
a violin for her birthday.&nbsp;&nbsp; After some prompting, she told me
that she heard scratchy violin music, like a beginner tuning their instrument,
followed by me saying &#8220;hello, hello&#8221;.&nbsp; I thought she was joking, but
when I could tell that she was serious, I asked her if it sounded like
&#8220;musac&#8221;, static or some other background noise.&nbsp; She had the voice
messages still on her answering machine, and she played both messages back
to me.&nbsp; On the first message, I could clearly hear my voice saying
that &#8220;I just called to say hi and that I would see her tomorrow&#8221;.&nbsp;
The second message starts with about 4 seconds of clear but scratchy violin
music, and then I could very clearly hear my voice saying &#8220;hello, hello&#8221;.&nbsp;
My girlfriend said that both the messages had my phone number on the caller
ID.&nbsp; By this time I had convinced her that I did not leave the violin
music on her machine (nor were there any TV&#8217;s or radio&#8217;s turned on in my
room during the call).&nbsp; All I could think of was that I may have been
hearing some future event when my girlfriend would be tuning her violin
and that I would not be around to hear it!&nbsp; So I changed my plane
reservations to take a different flight home.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing happened
to the plane that I would have been on, but I can not help but think that
the violin music was meant to be some type of warning.&nbsp; Maybe I would
have had car accident if I took the other flight, or I would have been
hit crossing the road.&nbsp; Regardless, an omen like that is hard to ignore.&nbsp;
I have kept the &#8220;message &#8220;&nbsp; recording as a reminder of this very strange
experience.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghostly Voice</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: susan_fenstemaker@yahoo.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>I don't know where to start so I guess the begining.</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>March 22, of 01, My parents came to visit us and they never got out
of the car. My dad was very sick and it was hard for him to move around.
But we still had a good visit and my son gave his grandfather his last
kiss bye. ( Not know ).&nbsp; My husband was talking to them and he didn't
know. I had touched his arm and I stared into his eyes. I known then but
we stayed like that for a second or two, as soon as I let go the feeling
I had disappeared.&nbsp; On saturday night he to his wife to call 911 he
was dying. As it goes they revived him 8 times in one night. The next morning
he passed away. We has gotten his things ready for the funeral on Thursday.
She had picked us up to stay at her home the night before the funeral.
Everyone was so tired that we didn't go to bed until late.&nbsp; My son
and I slept my dad's room and everyone was asleep now except for me.&nbsp;
I was on the edge of sleep when I heard&nbsp; a gagging noice in the living
room and I figured the others could hear it. I was wrong, the next d they
never ring at all.&nbsp; In April of 2001 we went to visit my grandma(
my dad's mother ) we had a good visit and I hugged her husband John and
then I hugged her. I walked to her door and I turned towards her and I
saw her getting pushed farther away from me and it really scared me and
I wanted out fast.&nbsp; I didn't know what that meant until Sept. of this
year!&nbsp; Her husband John passed from her life. It was telling me something
is leaving her life again.&nbsp; I feel things I don't understand and there
are other time too.&nbsp; But for now this is it.</b>

<br><b>Ghosts - my story</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: Helwig@DIALCORP.com</b>
<br><b>We moved to a house in farm country in 1994.&nbsp; About two years
later things started happening.&nbsp; It started when my oldest son saw
a "man" standing out in the yard by the propane tank at dawn - staring
at his window.&nbsp; Shortly after that another son saw what he terms "the
horsey statue" in the downstairs playroom (which we later determined to
be the central location of weird stuff).&nbsp; It was as tall as a man,
had a horses face and pointed things coming off it's shoulders.&nbsp; It
stared at him and he stared at it, until he ran up the stairs crying.&nbsp;
My daughter has seen a doppleganger of her brother while playing with him.&nbsp;
An identical copy of her brother was across the room; her real brother
and herself ran out of the playroom, leaving the copy behind.&nbsp; We
have seen shadows on the wall of a head and torso, sometimes with what
looks like a viking hat on it.&nbsp; Objects move across the floor when
you're by yourself.&nbsp; Footsteps, oven alarms going off at 5 am, sounds
of breaking glass, you name it.&nbsp; One morning on boy woke to find large
staples arranged on his carpet, all facing inward in a large triangle.&nbsp;
The other boy next room over found blood drops running down his bedroom
wall.&nbsp; TV has come on at full volume, to turn itself off moments later.&nbsp;
Smoke alarms on two floors all go off together without any smoke at 5 am.&nbsp;
My camcorder turned on and started recording as I sat next to it in a dark
room.&nbsp; Music boxes start playing, objects disappear and are found
buried under other objects, and my dog has growled at something above and
behind me on two occasions.&nbsp; In early November, I was on the computer
when I heard whispering behind me.&nbsp; It was loud enough to clearly
hear it, but not make sense of it.&nbsp; It sounded Indian to me.&nbsp;
Every time I turned around it stopped, to start again moments later.&nbsp;
This activity goes in cycles.&nbsp; It will build for weeks and weeks and
then stop suddenly for maybe a year, only to start again.&nbsp; We are
not scared to live here, but have accepted our live in guest.&nbsp; Only
on two occasions have we felt evil in the house, and I ran it off with
a Bible each time.&nbsp; Many of the things are centered in the playroom
area and happen often in the early morning, right before sunrise.</b><b></b>

<p><b>GHOSTS OF DEAD SOLDIERS, ETC.</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: dargo_77@hotmail.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>Although I had always believed in ghosts, I have never had any real
experience until the time when I worked in an American call center in Subic,
a Freeport zone in Olongapo City which is 2 hours away from Manila. On
my first night there in November 2001 at around 10 pm, I went out the hallway
to load water in my jug. (We could request water delivered to our rooms
but I was too thirsty.) Subic is a really hot place being situated close
to the sea but on that warm night, after filling up three fourths of my
jug, I suddenly felt scared. The feeling suddenly crept up my spine, I
felt a cold sensation. The hairs on my body stood up. I had the feeling
that someone was watching me. I didn&#8217;t bother filling up my jug anymore
and briskly walked to my room. I never talked about that incident to my
roommate or anybody else. It didn&#8217;t bother me anyway.</b>
<br><b>After some days, we found out from an old timer who drivers a cab
exclusively for the Freeport, that the hotel building where we lived in
used to be the headquarters of American soldiers during the WW II. He said
wounded American soldiers died there. He even told us about shuttle bus
drivers who picked up a lady in a white dress near the chapel late at night.
When the drivers would glance at their rear view mirror, nobody would be
there in the bus. We didn&#8217;t think much about it until the time when we
were all given a four-day holiday. By the way, we were all from another
city so we hired a van to take us back to our city, which was 7 hours away
by land. On the way home, the driver who came from Olongapo City started
telling us ghost experiences he knew about in the hotel area where we were
staying. We all got really scared and suddenly everyone started sharing
their little scary experiences at the Freeport. I was shocked to discover
that it was all true after all. It was only then that we found out that
we were all being haunted without giving much thought about it.</b>
<br><b>In one of the rooms where the other girls stay, a man&#8217;s voice (rough)
would wake them up in the wee hours of the morning. The voice would shout
at their ears just like when a soldier was being woken up by his officer.
One of the girls in that room would turn her TV volume up so loud every
dawn.&nbsp; They said they would hear someone walking on the carpet in
their room. In another room, they would hear knocking at their door at
night. No one would be at their door when they would open it. They regarded
it as a prank and didn&#8217;t mind it. Once, during a pool party, one of the
girls retired early. She was alone in their room taking a bath when she
thought her roommate called her 3 times. When she came out, nobody was
there in the room with her. Her roommate was still at the pool. At another
time, when one of the girls was taking a bath, she suddenly came running
out of her room, screaming, with only a towel around her body. She said
that the toilet flushed by itself. That would mean that the ghost was in
the toilet-and-bathroom with her! In the hallway where I first had my experience,
one of the girls felt a cold breeze when she walked in front of an empty
small stock room. She wondered where the breeze came from. There is no
window or an open door in the hallway just a huge glass wall overlooking
the garden. The hair on her spine stood up. Once, when I came out of our
building to go to another at night, I suddenly felt the urge to run. My
hair stood up! I just walked a little faster because I did not want to
acknowledge the feeling that someone was following me although I was alone.</b>
<br><b>One of my co-employees, a woman of age had a third eye. She was
a psychic of some sort. She&#8217;s half Filipino and African-American, a heavy
set woman in her fifties. When everyone was going back to their rooms during
lunch break, she announced that a black figure was standing at some corner
of the hotel. Everyone started screaming and running downstairs. While
at another time, when some of the girls were practicing some songs for
the gathering, everyone ran out the room after they all heard an echo supposedly
of the song leader&#8217;s voice when her microphone was actually turned off.
She was holding it in front of her mouth.</b>
<br><b>There were other experiences but the last one I had was during my
last moments there, after I resigned. Holding my luggage, I opened the
door but decided to go back into the room to check if I haven&#8217;t left anything.
I put my bag on the bed and headed for the drawers. Immediately, the door
slammed shut! It did not just close, it locked itself! Suddenly I got scared.
I knew that something just locked me inside my room. It was outside. There
was no wind to close my door since all my windows were closed and the hallway
just had a series of doors leading to the rooms on both sides. I did not
make it obvious that I was aware. I picked up my bag, opened the door and
closed it. I felt a cold breeze outside my door and through the entire
hallway.&nbsp; I felt relief after I came out of the building. I was the
only one in the building that time. Everyone was at the office building.
I guess, it knew that I was leaving and never coming back. I think it didn&#8217;t
want me to go. Whatever!</b>
<br><b>Another not-so-close encounter happened exactly during the time
when my paternal grandfather died. My grandfather was 96 when he died.
It was the year 1996. He was bed-ridden and did not want to eat for 10
days prior to his death. It seemed that his spirit wanted to rest but his
body didn&#8217;t. Anyway, my father assumed that he died in his sleep because
in the morning he discovered that my grandfather&#8217;s body was cold, stiff
and purple already.&nbsp; My sister who was vacationing at a beach resort
was disturbed by persistent knocking at their beach cottage at 4 am that
day (dawn) he died. The knocking didn&#8217;t stop until they opened the door
only to find nothing. Also at dawn, my eldest sister woke up thinking she
heard someone outside knocking but nobody was there. It seems that my grandfather
was saying goodbye to them. As for me, although I live with my hubby, I
was always at our father&#8217;s house. My grandfather saw me everyday so he
didn&#8217;t have to say goodbye to me. I have noticed in most of the stories
sent it that people who die give out a sign of some sort before they die.
Don&#8217;t you think so?</b>

<p><b>Ghosts</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: superherione@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>

</p><p><b>Your site is great! Fascinating. All my life I have been pretty receptive
to</b>
<br><b>unusual occurrences, and I found several stories on your site to
be similar</b>
<br><b>to my own. There is a matrilineal history of this type of thing
in my</b>
<br><b>family. My mom calls it being 'witchy.' As a baby, the woman who
my middle</b>
<br><b>name is after passed away. At the funeral, I played with something
unseen in</b>
<br><b>front of me happily for the whole service. My mom and my grandmother
claim</b>
<br><b>they felt the presence of the woman and that I was clearly able
to see and</b>
<br><b>touch her. There are lots of stories of strange occurrences, esp.
with</b>
<br><b>animals when I was an infant and toddler.</b>
<br><b>Growing up I saw lots of spectral type things. Most notably, was
the ghost</b>
<br><b>in my closet. This was the only time I ever saw something that someone
else</b>
<br><b>saw too. I was about 5 maybe and my friends, two boys of about 6
and 10 were</b>
<br><b>with me in my room. Suddenly we all looked to my closet, which had
slats you</b>
<br><b>could see through, esp from sitting on the floor as we were. There
was a</b>
<br><b>white, small man. He was ..almost cartoonish, and for some reason
I thought</b>
<br><b>of him as a pirate. He was angry. I was not afraid and felt glad
they</b>
<br><b>obviously saw it too. The older boy ran to get our moms, and I opened
the</b>
<br><b>closet door. Upon opening it nothing was there but a white dust
all over the</b>
<br><b>clothing and the floor. Shortly after, that was gone too.</b>
<br><b>In one of your stories, a man mentions the time 11:11 pm. The whole
time I</b>
<br><b>lived in that house, until I was 10 years old, I waited for 11:11.
I don't</b>
<br><b>know why, but each night I lay awake in a sort of dread apprehension
for</b>
<br><b>that time. At 11:10 I began to stare at the clock and did not look
away, or</b>
<br><b>breathe it seemed like, till 11:12.&nbsp; Then I felt a sense of
relief, but</b>
<br><b>still sleep often eluded me for hours more. I'm a life long insomniac.</b>
<br><b>In the same house, I saw what I believe now to be the astral projection
of</b>
<br><b>my still living grandmother. It was night and I saw her in a transparent</b>
<br><b>form in the living room. I don't know if she was dreaming or having
an out</b>
<br><b>of body experience or what. On the way back to my room, I saw several
flying</b>
<br><b>'demon' like things, also transparent, flying just below the cathedral</b>
<br><b>ceilings.&nbsp; In that same house, my mom says a 'devil' visited
her one night.</b>
<br><b>He had hooves, and she says she grabbed her bible and after a bit
he</b>
<br><b>disappeared.</b>
<br><b>Several years went by without any major events, unless you count
dreams,</b>
<br><b>premonitions, weird feelings, etc. I have never been short on those.
Then</b>
<br><b>when I was 16, I saw something else. I don''t know if I should call
it a</b>
<br><b>ghost or not...I was in the living room of my then house (different
from the</b>
<br><b>house above mentioned) and I was watching TV, home alone. I saw
a reflection</b>
<br><b>of something in the television screen...it was, well it's hard to
describe.</b>
<br><b>It was human-ish, but almost zombie looking, with grey green skin.
But</b>
<br><b>piercing, very aware eyes. I turned from the tv and looked behind
me, where</b>
<br><b>it was still standing. I just stared and in a moment or two, it
disappeared</b>
<br><b>before my eyes. I felt a need to get away and went outside and sat
on the</b>
<br><b>porch for the rest of the afternoon, talking on the cordless to
my best</b>
<br><b>friend.</b>
<br><b>There have been several other events, sometimes I hear my name or
hear</b>
<br><b>someone say 'hello', etc. I have been to two of the places on your
list of</b>
<br><b>haunted sites. The Onion House in San Antonio, TX for one. All my
life I</b>
<br><b>heard about it being haunted and at 16 or so, my future husband
and I went</b>
<br><b>on a ghost hunting trip to check it out. It sure feels haunted,
the presence</b>
<br><b>there is weird. You also have Northstar Mall on list, and I used
to work</b>
<br><b>there. The Parking garage is a very malevolent place. For one thing,
it's</b>
<br><b>infested with bats. There is certainly an ominous feeling there,
and I've</b>
<br><b>heard many stories. I also worked at another haunted place once.
It was a</b>
<br><b>historical site and the basement esp. was haunted. Things would
move on</b>
<br><b>their own, cold drafts, you'd get chills for no reason, etc.</b>
<br><b>My husband and I are still quite interested in paranormal goings
on, and</b>
<br><b>when we can, we still go to haunted sites, but so many are on private</b>
<br><b>property or difficult to access at night. Still, we both believe
there is</b>
<br><b>often more present than you know and your site is a great resource.
Keep up</b>
<br><b>the good work.</b>

<p><b>Grandfather</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: mmmm_tasty_yum@yahoo.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>I myself have had many strange happenings beginnning early in my
childhood. When i was just past 1 year old my grandfather passed away,
i was very attached to my grandfather as a baby and would spend hours stealing
his glasses etc. One early morning my mum got up to get herself a coffee
and she took me out of my cot and placed me on the rug in the living room.
I&nbsp; was upset of being woken and lay there crying perfusely. My mother
quickly went downstaris to give my dad his coffeeand rushed back to tend
to me. When she returned i was laughing and giggling and having a happy
old time. My mum believe that it was my granddad playing with me. Lately
though i have many sightings being that our whole family is what u would
call "modern day witches" we are prone to them. We don not run round with
snakes and ravens but from very early we are taught about ghosts, spirits
etcs. In the past few years i have numerous sightings, i have 3 dogs who
have passed and 2 were poisened. i constantly see one of my dogs a Malt</b>
<br><b>I also have a young boyz spirit that is constantly peeking around
corners at me. When my mum was 5 her young cousin was killed when hit by
a car. The young girl is always around sitting on stairs, bed ends,couches
and she is always wearing the same thing. These are only a sample few of
the many sightings we have seen. All i must say though is we have been
been afraid of ghosts and enjoy there company they always seem to be there
when your feeling down or depressed</b><b></b>

<p><b>Grandma Sees Ghosts</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: mmgogel@psci.net</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>My grandmother is either very lucky or very unlucky. Her first experience
was not long after she married my papa. Papa's mother lived with them until
she died. One night Nan was awakened in the middle of the night to find
her mother-in-law standing by her bed holding an oil lamp. That would'nt
be so strange if not for the fact that she had passed away months earlier!
Her second experience involved not only her but my papa and a neighbor.
It seems that there was an old man that lived in the neighborhood and his
daily routine was to walk the block to get exercise and local gossip. He
was a very friendly man and everyone liked him. When someone in a small
town passed away in those days, the whole town tended to go to the showing.
My uncle, who was a baby at the time, was sick so Nan and Papa didn't go.
A few days later Nan and Papa were at the neighbor's house when the man
of the house comes flying into the driveway. Papa asked him what the problem
was. He looked like he just saw a ghost. The neighbor said that he had.
He had seen Mr. Hawkins, the neighbor that just died! Papa did not believe
in ghosts so they all hopped in the car and the neighbor drove them to
where he had seen Mr. Hawkins. Sure enough there he was walking down the
sidewalk! Nan said he looked at them, smiled and continued walking down
the sidewalk. He walked around the corner and dissappeared. That was the
last they saw of Mr. Hawkins. One more! Nan and her sister-in-law were
driving into the town of Troy, Indiana where there is a set of railroad
tracks right before you get into town. It was nightime and Nan said she
saw someone walking along the side of the road in their direction. When
they got closer they noticed the person had no HEAD! She said that this
ghost used to be seen quite often. Nan is a very religious person and she
SWEARS that these stories are real. She also told me that her great-grandmother
saw ghosts, her grandmother also did and she has seen three of them herself.
I LOVE this kind of stuff, but I hope that seeing ghosts does not run in
the family!!!</b>

<p><b>Grandmas Ghost Friend</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: okie6@chestertel.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>Hello.&nbsp; My name is Traci, I'm 16 years old and I live in South
Carolina.&nbsp; I have a very close family, but we're spread out all over
the United States, but we do like to keep in touch, for instance we call
my grandmother from my dad's side at least once a week.&nbsp; That grandmother's
name is Marie.&nbsp; She is getting very old now and in fact has just recently
celebrated her 79th or 80th birthday, I can never remember her age, but
I know that it's around there.&nbsp; Marie lives in Oklahoma where my father
and two sisters, as well as myself are from, and to my knowlege has only
come out to South Carolina once, and since then swears never to come back.</b>
<br><b>On this visit my Aunt Pat owned an old plantation named Dixie Hall
Plantation.&nbsp;&nbsp; My grandmother had traveled to South Carolina along
with her son, my uncle Darrel.&nbsp; I don't remember this visit because
at the time I was young.&nbsp; But I do remember that my cousin's room
had two beds in it, a fact that had stumped me at the time, but I never
asked about it because her room was so big that I figured that it was in
there because there was extra room for one for emergencies.&nbsp; When
my grandma and uncle finnaly arrived it was well past bedtime and so we
all quickly agreed to let my grandma and mama have my cousin's room for
the night and my sisters and cousin were to sleep in the very large den,
while my father and uncle slept in what was my mother's and his room.&nbsp;
It was winter time and us as children didn't like to sleep upstairs because
it was so cold, my mother told me.&nbsp; I don't remember ever complaining
about the cold but then again I was young.</b>
<br><b>The next morning everyone was downstairs in the dining room eating
breakfast when my grandma suddenly said, "Pat, why did you come in at pat
my head last night?".&nbsp; My aunt assured her that she did no such thing
and they came to the conculsion that my grandma was just very tired and
though that she felt something.&nbsp; That night we all slept in the same
rooms as we had the night before and the next morning my grandma came down
to breakfast and assured us that she did feel someone patting her forehead
during the night and she did not imagin it.&nbsp; At this point my aunt
didn't say anything, but just looked down at her plate and continued eating.&nbsp;
That night we went to bed same as the two nights before.&nbsp; Really early
in the morning my mother and grandma came down stairs waking us up as they
did.&nbsp; My aunt came out of her bedroom, which was on the first floor,
asking what was wrong and my grandma as well as my mother assured Pat that
there was somthing weird going on with that room.&nbsp; They said that
they woke up, finding some woman sitting in a chair that was supposed to
be across the room, leaning over my grandmother patting her head and singing
quietly, as if trying to get my grandma to go to sleep.&nbsp; They said
that she was dress in some kind of dress that sort of looked like a nurse's
uniform, except that it had an apron tied over the skirt, and was longer.</b>
<br><b>At this point my grandma was ready to leave and decided the next
day she would leave rather than spend another night in that house.&nbsp;
The next day she repacked all her cloths and left assuring us she would
never come back.&nbsp; My Aunt having never encountered such a lady assured
us and asked us to continue staying with her because she was all alone
besides her daughter and son.&nbsp; So we stayed.</b>
<br><b>A few years later I was about 9.&nbsp; This I can sort of remember
without anyone telling me what they remember.&nbsp; My aunt was out with
my father doing something, I don't remember what, but my mother, sisters
and I were alone in the house.&nbsp; We had just gotten finished cleaning
the dinner dishes and had gone into the den to watch t.v. before bedtime.&nbsp;
When my mother call us and told us to go to bed, (we all shared the same
room with my cousin, though not because there wern't enough rooms in the
old house, just because we didn't like to be alone for some reason none
of us can remember) we turned off the tv and went to brush our teeth.&nbsp;
A few minutes later my mother came up stairs and asked us why we didn't
turn off the tv, we told her we did and went to bed.&nbsp; A few minutes
later we her her call us downstairs, so we got up and went down.&nbsp;
She asked us which one of us were coming down and turning the tv on and
we told her none of us were, she started to get upset, the way parents
do whenever they feel they are being lied to by their children, when the
tv turned on, she looked scared for a minute and then laughed and asked
us who had the remote.&nbsp; My little sister and I didn't say anything,
but my older sister just pointed to the table where the remote was sitting.&nbsp;
My mother turned around to see the remote and then she told us to go get
in the car.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; We left after that and I can't remember ever going back to
that house. But since then I got curious and got my aunt to do some research
and find out how old the house was and who used to own it.&nbsp; It turns
out that it was used as a cival war hospital.&nbsp; And it also turns out
that that room where my grandmother and mom stayed in that night was a
room where a little boy died of pnemona during that time period.&nbsp;
I was just wondering, why would the woman in the dress pat my grandmother's
head that night and never bother us kids that used to sleep in that room
every night?</b><b></b>

<p><b>GRANDMA'S LITTLE SISTER</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: andrea.peacock@am.joneslanglasalle.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>First off, I am a skeptic but what happened to me about 15 years
ago changed</b>
<br><b>me forever.</b>
<br><b>I was living with my Grandparents, taking care of them and going
to school.</b>
<br><b>It was late August and it was a particularly warm summer night for
San</b>
<br><b>Francisco. I had a hard time getting to sleep because it was so
warm. I woke</b>
<br><b>up around 3:00 a.m. all of a sudden. I am a very deep sleeper. I
have slept</b>
<br><b>through earthquake's, construction noise, etc. My window was open
and there</b>
<br><b>was always some type of night noises (insects, traffic, etc.). I
realized</b>
<br><b>when I woke up that everything was very still and quiet. I thought
to myself</b>
<br><b>that is probably why I woke up....it was too quiet. I could not
get back to</b>
<br><b>sleep. I realized I had to go to the bathroom which annoyed me because
the</b>
<br><b>restroom was at the end of a very long dark hall. I opened the bedroom
door</b>
<br><b>to start my trek to the bathroom and I froze. I noticed the hall
was much</b>
<br><b>darker than normal. It was pitch black. I did not remember ever
seeing the</b>
<br><b>hall that black before. I struggled to focus but could not. I also
froze for</b>
<br><b>another reason. It was cold, really cold. The hall was icy. The
hairs on the</b>
<br><b>back of my neck stood straight up putting me on alert. Then I heard
the</b>
<br><b>voice. A child's voice. Ginny......Ginny. It was clear as a bell
coming from</b>
<br><b>the end of the hall. I searched for some rational explanation in
my head.</b>
<br><b>The first rational explanation I could think of was that my Grandmother
was</b>
<br><b>talking in her sleep. Her bedroom was immediately left of my bedroom
door. I</b>
<br><b>poked my head into her room and rater loudly and inquired "Grandma,
Grandma,</b>
<br><b>did you hear something?" To my utter disbelief she replied back,
"Yes,</b>
<br><b>Andrea, did you hear that too?" I quickly turned on the bedroom
lights and</b>
<br><b>went to sit on the bed with her. She thought I was talking in my
sleep. She</b>
<br><b>had been awake for hours and could not sleep either because it was
too</b>
<br><b>quiet.</b>
<br><b>She said no one ever called her Ginny except for her little sister.
We both</b>
<br><b>would never forget that night.</b>
<br><b>Her little sister had been playing outside one late August morning
in the</b>
<br><b>front yard of her friends house. She was 4 years old. My grandmother
was</b>
<br><b>inside the house visiting her friends mother. A drunk driver came
barreling</b>
<br><b>down the street and broke through the front yard fence hitting her
little</b>
<br><b>sister and dragging her down the street for 5 more blocks. She was
killed</b>
<br><b>instantly.</b>

<br><b>Grandmothers Old House</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: jill.thompson@abbott.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>

</p><p><b>I do have a story to tell but it is not scary.&nbsp; It is something
that I would like to share.</b>
<br><b>My Grandmother lived in a very old house.&nbsp; It contained 3 apartments.&nbsp;
Two apartments upstairs and one downstairs.&nbsp; There was also an attic.&nbsp;
The house was really cool.&nbsp; It had vines growing all over it so it
did look creepy in the fall.&nbsp; Anyways, my Grandmother had this canister
that would hold 5 rolls of toilet paper.&nbsp; She would always wait until
I would come over because she new that I loved to put the toilet paper
in this canister. I was in grade school and spent the weekends at my Grandmothers.&nbsp;
I knew that I filled the canister with toilet paper and so did my Grandmother
and the next time she went to retrieve a roll, it would be empty.&nbsp;
She would call and ask if I knew where all of the toilet paper was.&nbsp;
I told her I put it in the canister as I always do.&nbsp; She would go
to the store and buy more toilet paper.&nbsp; When she returned with more
toilet paper and go to fill the canister, al! l of the toilet paper returned
and the canister was full.&nbsp; Being the jokester that I was she thought
that I was playing a practical joke on her.&nbsp; I swore up and down that
I did not take the toilet paper.&nbsp; It happened time and time again.&nbsp;
Then one day, I happened to see like a cloud floating down the hallway.&nbsp;
That is the only way I know how to describe what I saw.&nbsp; I figured
that it was dust particles that you see when the sun shines through a window.&nbsp;
I asked my Grandmother if she was cleaning in the other apartment or cooking.&nbsp;
She had two stoves.&nbsp; The one in her apartment the oven did not work
but the other one in the other apartment upstairs the oven worked and she
would sometimes use that stove.&nbsp; She told me no.&nbsp; I thought nothing
about it.&nbsp; A couple of weeks later I saw this cloud like thing again.
I asked if she was cleaning or cooking.&nbsp; She looked at me puzzled
and asked me why I wanted to know.&nbsp; ! I told her that I saw this cloud
like thing in the hallway.&nbsp; She told me that she had noticed this
a couple of times before too.&nbsp; We both looked in the toilet paper
container and it was empty once again.&nbsp; We came to the conclusion
that there was some type of ghost that lived in this house and liked to
take toilet paper.&nbsp; I would never leave her apartment at night time
to go use the oven in the other apartment.&nbsp; The ghost never bothered
us.&nbsp; It scared me but I just never moved from my room at night time
at her house.</b>
<br><b>We did find out that the house that she lived in was part of the
underground railroad for slaves.&nbsp; You could see windows at basement
level from the outside of the house but when you went in the basement,
there were no windows.&nbsp; This was to fool people to thinking that is
was an ordinary house with windows when in actuality it was a passage way.</b>
<br><b>Like I said it is not a scary story but I thought it would be nice
to share.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Grandpa's Hands</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>

</p><p><b>By: EBiel@mhhp.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>My story is a little different than others listed on this site but
it's still spooky and the affects are still present today.&nbsp; In order
to fully explain my story I need to give a little background about my grandfather.&nbsp;
My grandpa had an ailment on his hands and feet that made them appear as
if they were covered with warts - I don't know if he ever had them checked
out by a MD, one time when I was little I asked my grandma about them and
she said something about a virus but I don't think she was sure either.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Grandpa was an old fashioned German farmer - he was tall, stocky, stubborn,
very hard working and had a bad temper whenever things didn't go his way.&nbsp;
As his grandchildren (my brother and I), not only would he become extremely
angry with us when we disobeyed him but he would also hit the roof if we
did something stupid and dangerous that could have potentially hurt/killed
us.&nbsp; I remember one time when we were little my grandpa saw my brother
and I playing on the roof of our milking barn - he turned bright red and
screamed at us to get down then proceeded to totally ream out my parents
for not watching us properly.&nbsp; The worst was the way he screamed,
he had a way with it that would make a person jump and cower - I don't
think my poor mother ever got used to it.&nbsp; At the same time however
he did love his family very much, now I realize that the reason he used
to go to such yelling extremes is because it was his way to deal with the
fear that my brother and I would inadvertently get ourselves killed.&nbsp;
Later, when we reached driving age he was very concerned that we would
cause an accident - I remember&nbsp; being preached to about how driving
was a privilege, not a right, and that messing around and not being responsible
were one of the best ways to loosing a license.&nbsp; My grandfather, may
he rest in peace, died when I was in 10th grade.</b>
<br><b>Years later I graduated from high school and went to the University
of Wisconsin Stout.&nbsp; During my junior year I was in a wedding back
home and I met another guy in the wedding party from Mason City, Iowa (about
4 hours away) that I started dating.&nbsp; Because this man was older I
knew my parents would absolutely hate him so I decided to keep the relationship
a secret from them.&nbsp; This went on without a hitch for about six months,
then one summer Sunday afternoon when I was driving back to school from
Mason City I somehow went through a stop sign and had a brand new extended
cab Chevy pick up hit me head on, literally ripping the car in half between
the front seats and the back.&nbsp; Luckily I survived the accident with
only a few scrapes and a&nbsp; concussion.&nbsp; When I was out I don't
know if I had a dream or if this really happened but my grandpa came to
me and royally reamed me out for not driving carefully and almost getting
myself killed (I don't know if he commented on my boyfriend, I don't remember
all of the conversation).&nbsp; When I awoke I told my mother and grandmother
about the "visit" afterwards I went to sleep in the hospital and since
then it has gotten a little fuzzy.&nbsp; However, according to them I had
thought it was a pretty intense experience and was fairly shaken up - not
only from the accident but more so from my visit.&nbsp; The next week I
thought that I must have dreamed of the entire experience and that I was
simply suffering from an over active imagination.&nbsp; This calmed me
for about a day but then I noticed a growth on my hand very similar to
the growths my grandfather had!&nbsp; To this day I still have it - it's
about half the size of a pencil eraser on the inside of my middle finger
- it hasn't spread so I haven't looked into getting it removed.&nbsp; To
me I guess it's a little sign that my grandpa is still with us trying to
make sure we're safe.</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>

</p><p><b>a few months ago i split up with a long term boyfriend. I was quite
upset</b>
<br><b>and had a pretty rough time over it. One night i got to sleep late
as i was</b>
<br><b>upset. I had a strange dream. I dreamed of my granny who had died
a few</b>
<br><b>years earlier. She was very clear in the dream and was all shiny.
She said</b>
<br><b>to me something about the vicar and he needed to cut his headge
down. When</b>
<br><b>she was alive she always used to moan about the vicar who lived
opposite</b>
<br><b>because his hedge in his garden was too high and she couldnt see
the view of</b>
<br><b>the beach over the top (she lived in Weymouth, England) Then she
said that</b>
<br><b>Grandpa (her husband) needs to tidy up the house and put his old
stuff in</b>
<br><b>boxes and that i should tell him this. When i woke i thought about
this and</b>
<br><b>thought i was pretty strange so i spoke to my mum about it. She
was quite</b>
<br><b>alarmed by what i told her and called my dad and told him what i
said. It</b>
<br><b>turned out that my grandpa was moving house and only my parents
knew about</b>
<br><b>it. I believe that she knew i was upset and came to me in the dream
to</b>
<br><b>reassure me about things that had happened and i was very pleased
that she</b>
<br><b>came to see me.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Grant Corner Inn</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: C1059@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>I have lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico all my life. Recently I have
been fascinated with the history of downtown Santa Fe, and even more so
the ghosts that may or may not exist in most of the old historic buildings.
One location imparticular has kept my interest, the Grant Corner Inn on
the corner of Grant St. and Johnson.</b>
<br><b>Before I was employeed by the Grant Corner Inn, I was fully aware
of it's history with the paranormal. the house was built for a ranching
family new to the area, The "Windsor" or "Winsor" family. Then sold to
another family shortly there after, The Robinson family. It has been hard
to get any other information than that. I am aware of a spiritual presence
constantly-I get the feeling it may be a woman and a man. I can feel them,
cold air, certain odors, and quick glimpses of someone. Although I have
tried to persue who they could be I have been afraid and unsure to persue
the presence of these ghosts. I know they are there.</b>
<br><b>The people some of the people I work with are scared to even talk
about what might be there. They tell me to leave them alone. Is it wrong
to persue a ghost? I don't feel like they are harmful or angry, I get the
feeling they maybe lost and I think they feel a little imposed on by all
of the people in and out of this house.</b>
<br><b>For Christmas our employer has made special arrangments for all
her staff to stay at the Bed and Breakfast for a night. Should I be worried?
I am not to sure how I feel about acctually staying knowing what I know
has gone on in the house. Previous renters had really negative, traumatic,
ghostly experiences within this house.</b>
<br><b>You can read more about it in "Adobe Angels" a great book which
has taken me and my curiouosity to the limit. Thank you!</b><b></b>
