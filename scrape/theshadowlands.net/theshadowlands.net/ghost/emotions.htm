      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">From ancient times we have found many relics buried deep in the earth's soil, mountains, lakes, and caves.&nbsp; However,</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">there are relics that are once again being discovered that lie on top of the earth's soil across the mountains,</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">ravines, and through caves and other empty cavities.&nbsp; These relics are called Ley Lines and are found all over the</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">world.</font></b><br>

      <br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thousands of years ago our prehistoric ancestors left for us this system of networks that define paths of energies and</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">forces that can not always easily be seen.&nbsp; These systems are energies from the earth and are identified by landmarks</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and patterns.&nbsp; Some ley lines are straight paths and others form circular patterns that grow larger as it moves</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">outward.&nbsp; Some believe that these patterns can be mapped through the use of a dowsing or divining rod. Infrared can</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">also be used to detect and determine the extent of this phenomenon.</font></b><br>

      <br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are two types of ley systems: Straight leys in which the energy flows straight and cup marked leys in which the</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">energy flows in a circular pattern with the energy close to the center being strongest and radiating outward growing</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">less strong.</font></b><br>

      <br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In France, cathedrals and other places of interests have been placed in a straight ley line system.&nbsp; The ancient</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Greek alignments were found to be very complex.&nbsp; Not only through straight line alignment but also in equal</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">distances!&nbsp; The distance between Delphi and Thebes, Delphi and Athens, Sparta and Olympia, Sparta and Athens, Epidaurus</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to Sparta, and Epidaurus to Olympia are equal.</font></b><br>

      <br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The tiny village of Alaise located in the foothills of the Jura Mountains of eastern France is a highly complex</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">system.&nbsp; Think of a pie cut into 48 pieces ? this is what the ley line network looks like with Alaise in the center.</font></b><br>

      <br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The forces that use the ley lines are natural and supernatural.&nbsp; Some of the strange and supernatural events</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and forces associated with ley lines are The Wild Hunt, phantom animals (Black Dog), moving lights, ghosts, fairy</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">processions, and as a flight path for witches.&nbsp; It is thought that the creators of the ley lines in each area may</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">have used the ley lines in connection with astronomy, rituals, or calendars.</font></b><br>

      <br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In some cultures the ley lines were to be used specifically for the dead to help them make their journey into the next</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">life.&nbsp; In ancient times, people believed in the survival of the human spirit and it is believed that the ley system</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">proves it.&nbsp; In Honaluba a
small girl found herself alone on a known spirit path.&nbsp; She heard
marching footsteps but when</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">she turned, no one was there!&nbsp; Suddenly, she felt a hand push her from the path.&nbsp; Her parents explained to her that</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the path was for wondering souls and if she had remained in the path she would have died.</font></b><br>

      <br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Ancient burial grounds were placed on ley lines.&nbsp; In Germany these are called Geisterwege (spirit ways); in Holland they</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">are called Doodwegen (roads of the dead); and in England they are Dod or Dodman (dead man).&nbsp;&nbsp; One ley network</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">involves the Foulford Inn Stone which is encircled by burial grounds connecting two cup-marked leys with a straight line</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">through a man made cave and over a body of water.&nbsp; The Stone was placed above a major fault on the highland fault, north</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">of Scotland.&nbsp; This is where
Scotland pushes against the rest of the United Kingdom.&nbsp; This
fault supplies the cup marked</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">stone with its energies.</font></b><br>

      <br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another system involves a standing stone called the Phadruig (Patrick) near Balquhidder Church and is known as a very</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">powerful cup marked ley.&nbsp; Tradition dictates that whenever someone dies, the mourners would have to carry the dead</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">across the land to the stone where the coffin would be laid upon it so everyone could rest.&nbsp; In addition to this</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">tradition, coffins were frequently carried along ley lines with hopes that the dead would find their way down the path.</font></b><br>

      <br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For years, many have tried to solve the ley system to discover its purpose, why it exists, and who created it.</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is difficult to discern as there is very little recorded about the ley system and few people seem interested</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">in researching it scientifically.&nbsp; In the 1960's for example, the ley system became associated with UFO's.&nbsp; Even</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">with the amazing discovery of the Nazca leys, very little has been done.</font></b><br>

      <br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is believed that the Nazca Indians of Peru created the intricate and unique ley system on the desert surface.&nbsp; The</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">lay of the land did not affect the leys that were created there.&nbsp; Barely discernable on the ground, but shockingly</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">visible from an aerial view!&nbsp; One will see markings upon the desert floor that resemble various geometric shapes, a</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">humming bird, a whale, a monkey complete with fingers, and a spider that was unknown to that area thousands of years ago!</font></b><br>

      <br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Why the intricate designs that one can not see on the ground?&nbsp; Flight thousands of years ago was unheard of so why</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">would anyone design such an artful breathtaking design that no one would see?&nbsp; Were the Indians hoping to please God?</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Spirit markers for the astral body?&nbsp; Or was it for a communication to or directions for alien visitors?&nbsp; We might</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">never know since the Nazca Indians disappeared and very few people today are working to unmask the mystery.</font></b><br>

      <br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What is the real purpose of the ley lines?&nbsp; Who created them?&nbsp; Are these ley systems boundaries of other dimensions</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">that co-exist within our world?&nbsp; Are they fairy paths?&nbsp; Do they help our dearly departed dead continue their journey?</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Are they communications to possible aliens or are they the communications FROM aliens?</font></b><br>

      <br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I don't know the answers.&nbsp; However, I can safely say, these ley systems were not an accident and someone very</font></b><br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">intelligent created them.</font></b><br>
