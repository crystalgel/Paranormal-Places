<BR><B>My Grandmother</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Dawn.Ryan@relianceinsurance.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I wouldn't say that my story is a haunting, just a presence that
I</B>
<BR><B>feel.....&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyday.</B>
<BR><B>My grandmother died in Jan. 2003. At that time, my daughter was
only 14</B>
<BR><B>mos. old.&nbsp; My grandmom just lived and breathed her grandchildren.&nbsp;
We</B>
<BR><B>always use to say that the love was so strong that she will probably
come</B>
<BR><B>back and see them.&nbsp; Well, I think that is exactly what is happening
in my</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; I have never seen her, but I feel her presence.&nbsp;
My daughter, I</B>
<BR><B>would think, would not remember my grandmom because she was so young
when</B>
<BR><B>grandmom died.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been over a year now since
her death, and my</B>
<BR><B>daughter is now 2 1/2 yrs. old.&nbsp; She constantly talks about
GG visiting her</B>
<BR><B>in her room.&nbsp; (GG meant great grandmom, and that's what all
the kids called</B>
<BR><B>her).&nbsp; She tells me things that she wouldn't know.&nbsp; She
sees pictures and</B>
<BR><B>knows exactly who she is.&nbsp; She tells us that GG visits her
in her room at</B>
<BR><B>night with a flashlight, or she will say:&nbsp; tell GG to stop
waving at me.</B>
<BR><B>Last night, as I was tucking her in bed, she looked at me and</B>
<BR><B>said....Shhhhhhhh.&nbsp; I said why?&nbsp; She responded that GG
was standing right</B>
<BR><B>there.&nbsp; I casually just said... oh yea?&nbsp; and she again
responded.... yes,</B>
<BR><B>she is right there and she is waving at me with a ladybug in her
hand.</B>
<BR><B>Then she proceeds to tell me that GG plays with her (and her toys)&nbsp;
all the</B>
<BR><B>time.&nbsp; After she said that... she looked over to the area where
she said GG</B>
<BR><B>was... and smiled and laughed.&nbsp; I said to her... what are you
laughing at?</B>
<BR><B>Her response was:&nbsp; GG, she told me that I have to start using
that Potty.</B>
<BR><B>(Jamie is still potty training).&nbsp; Another time, we were driving
in our car</B>
<BR><B>on our way home from shopping.&nbsp; It just so happened to be my
grandmother's</B>
<BR><B>birthday that day, but it was not mentioned at all.&nbsp; It was
just in our</B>
<BR><B>minds that today was her birthday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My daughter
said to me:&nbsp; Ya know what</B>
<BR><B>today is mommy.&nbsp; I said, No what?&nbsp; She said... today is
GG's birthday.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>was shocked.&nbsp; I asked her how she knew that, and her response
was.....&nbsp; GG</B>
<BR><B>told me herself.. she is sitting right next to me (almost as a matter
of</B>
<BR><B>fact sort of way).&nbsp; Different things like this happen since
she died.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>don't feel that she is haunting us, I just feel that she loved my
daughter</B>
<BR><B>so much that she likes to see her.&nbsp; Do you think that is the
case? or am I</B>
<BR><B>going crazy</B><B></B>

<P><B>Living with Spirits</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SisterBug87@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I've resided in two separate homes that were housing
spirits, none of them malevolent.&nbsp; One just made noises and one would
occasionally thump the floor, turn ashtrays over when no one was around,
or announce it's presence with the smell of automobile exhaust.&nbsp; I
currently live with a thin dark shadow that roams my front rooms.&nbsp;
I feel no fear or anxiety; go figure!&nbsp; Just thought I'd let you guys
hear from another believer.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghosts In this House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Dreamer7392@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was ten, both my grandparents died. Before them, my aunt and
uncle died also. They lived with us.&nbsp; both nights after we found out,
my sister and I both woke up in the middle of the night to feel our beds
shaking violently while every thing else in the house was still. Then,
after coming home from the each funeral, The door to their bedroom was
seen opening and shutting. About 7 weeks after the door, lights went on
and off in our basement when noone had been down there. When walking into
our rooms, one of my sister, brother, or my belongings would fall off a
shelf. My cat was seen chasing a string hanging in mid-air, as if my aunt
was playing with her. Creepy feelings of being watched while watching TV
in my living room were also felt. When outside, You can hear your name
being called softly in a little girls vioce, then childish laughing. Random
cold spots can be felt around my house, even near heating vents while the
heat is on. Computers randomly turn on and so do faucets, lights, TVs,
and radios. Sometimes footsteps can be heard in my house, hurring up and
down the halls. Once I even heard childish crying, like the little girl
ghost who calls your name and laughs.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Terrorized</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pisces1871@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi,here is a story I swear has haunted me for years and still does;I`ve</B>
<BR><B>always been sensative to "ghosts"my whole life and have seen several.when
I</B>
<BR><B>was nine we moved into a house my mom,little sister&amp;step dad.I
was excited</B>
<BR><B>at first about the new house.from the first second I walked thru
the front</B>
<BR><B>door my hair stood up and chills ran all thru me.I felt we were
on</B>
<BR><B>display.when you walk in you in the living room.connected to a small
dining</B>
<BR><B>room.to the right was the kitchen,then a family room.in the family
room</B>
<BR><B>there was 2 doors opposite from each other one to the garage the
other a</B>
<BR><B>back door.from the living room to the left was a halway.shaped like
an</B>
<BR><B>L.bathroom on the right 3ft into hallway.at the corner of the hall
on the</B>
<BR><B>right was my moms room.at the end of the hall my sistsers room to
the right</B>
<BR><B>mine to the left.also a den between moms &amp;sisters rooms.</B>
<BR><B>you`ll see why I`m explaining the house.my mom rented the house
because it</B>
<BR><B>was cheap for a 4bdrm house.I hated that house and always complained.nobody</B>
<BR><B>believed me,that there was something evil there.there was a spirit
that</B>
<BR><B>either knew what I felt or chose to pick on me I`m not sure witch.usually
I</B>
<BR><B>didn`t see it with my eyes but got pictures in my head at first.</B>
<BR><B>I saw it usually only about 2ft tall a black silouette with all
its bones</B>
<BR><B>visible it`s face moved like someone with skin but had none.</B>
<BR><B>it never came past the hall.accept for outside the windows,or above
the</B>
<BR><B>ceiling.it used to follow me one of those 2 ways all over the house.all
the</B>
<BR><B>time(continuously)I was always aware of where it was.it kept a continuous</B>
<BR><B>eye on me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
after a couple weeks it got worse in the hall it had</B>
<BR><B>free rain.used to run down the hall &amp;jump into bed pull my covers
over my</B>
<BR><B>head &amp;never looked out til morning.I could feel it waiting for
me to look.I</B>
<BR><B>had nightmares everynight .used to wake screaming.it never bothered
anyone</B>
<BR><B>else at all.it liked the ceiling &amp;stayed up there most of the
time.one time</B>
<BR><B>when I was in the bathroom it locked me in there and I started screaming</B>
<BR><B>until my mom came and couldn`t open the door it jumped down onto
the counter</B>
<BR><B>next to the door between my mother and myself,it scowled at me for
a minute</B>
<BR><B>then jumped back up and hid from my mother who was pounding on the
door.the</B>
<BR><B>lock came undone &amp; I ran to my mom pulling her out of the hallway.I
told her</B>
<BR><B>what happened but she dismised the idea and told me to quit playing</B>
<BR><B>around.after that it got worse.one other time my sister&amp; I were
in the</B>
<BR><B>bathroom I started screaming to sister "can you&nbsp; see it " it
was in the</B>
<BR><B>corner again crouched on all fours.smiling evily at me.but she never
saw</B>
<BR><B>it.I used to pull the droor out by the sink so it couldn`t shut
&amp;lock me in</B>
<BR><B>anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everyday it waited
above the hall for me to enter down the</B>
<BR><B>hall.I remember it was excited with wiggles of delight for me to
aproach the</B>
<BR><B>hall like a puppy that`s excited only there`s nothing cute about
this</B>
<BR><B>thing.we had a contest of sorts because I would get ready (one for
the</B>
<BR><B>money,two for the show,three to get ready,four to go!)and run fast
I could</B>
<BR><B>down the hall trying to be faster than it was.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
upon</B>
<BR><B>my entrance of the hall,(sorry I`m shaking telling this story.)it
would jump</B>
<BR><B>down on my back holding on to my shoulders screaming and generally
have a</B>
<BR><B>blast terrifing me.by the time I reached my bed under the covers
I dove I</B>
<BR><B>seemed to be alone but I knew it was in my room,laughing vishiously
at</B>
<BR><B>me.then one night I woke up from being to hot under the covers(I
slept under</B>
<BR><B>the covers all night,everynight.)I wanted to pull my covers down
but was</B>
<BR><B>unusually afraid to.I was sweating so bad I couldn`t take it anymore
so I</B>
<BR><B>slowly pulled the covers down.my closet was opposite my window and
the</B>
<BR><B>closet doors were mirrored.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I saw two red lights a few feet</B>
<BR><B>away and said to myself those have to be parking lights from a car
across</B>
<BR><B>the road.so I got up to see if my blinds were open when I was out
of bed</B>
<BR><B>unprotected and realised the blinds were closed I froze afraid to
turn</B>
<BR><B>around.slowly I turned and about one foot from my face were two
red eyes at</B>
<BR><B>the top of an oval shape about the size of a bowling ball.it`s bulk
was</B>
<BR><B>transparent like a ballon filled with smoke.the smoke was moving
in a</B>
<BR><B>circular motion but eyes became intense and sharp.I jumped into
bed and</B>
<BR><B>prayed all night under my covers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
that's the last thing I remember at</B>
<BR><B>that house, I don`t recall very much from living there really only
what I`ve</B>
<BR><B>shared with you.I can`t recall moving out,school,friends or even
family time</B>
<BR><B>at all.we lived there only four months.I recall my mom saying rent
was cheap</B>
<BR><B>cause no one ever stayed more than three months.I do recall that
what</B>
<BR><B>usually harassed me was one of three that reside there the other
two stayed</B>
<BR><B>in my mom`s room mostly.and to this day I can`t remember ever going
in her</B>
<BR><B>room.I don`t even know what it looked like.other than that I remember
little</B>
<BR><B>stuff like knocking on the outside door when our sitter was over
weird</B>
<BR><B>banging all around us.my sister who was only five thought I was
crazy cause</B>
<BR><B>she remembers me screaming stuff like,leave me alone!it`s trying
to get</B>
<BR><B>me!it`s going to hurt me again!and it`s driving me crazy!but she
never saw</B>
<BR><B>what I was yelling at.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the house is

<BR><B>Recent Incident</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sunnybeach99@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was a young boy, I have seen ghosts at many occasions. It
had all started around when I was 5, when we moved into this very large
western style mansion back in Japan. My very first encounter was during
one of our family supper. It was very strange. I could see the presence
approaching our dining room and then looking at us through the window (no
glass) of the dining room door. What so strange about this is, I did not
actually see any physical form approaching the dining room door, yet I
could see the presence without any form approaching towards the door. This
was happenning almost every evening.</B>
<BR><B>A year later, when I was 6, around late evening while passing by
my oldest brother room,&nbsp; in order to go down the stairs. Then all
of a sudden, some of his clothing that was lying on top of his bed came
flying towards me. Of course, I panicked and I falll down the stairs.</B>
<BR><B>Like the family before us, my father also passed away in that same
house,&nbsp; when I was 7.&nbsp; Shortly after his passing, I saw my father
in white silouette form (only his profile) walking away from my line of
sight. That was the last time I have seen any ghost in that house. Maybe
my father had chased them away.</B>
<BR><B>Few years later, we moved to Canada. It has been 42 years since
my first encounter until last night.</B>
<BR><B>Something strange had happened. About 1 hour into my sleep, I was
awaken from a strange feeling. The room was dark but had enough street
light penetrating through my curtain. Just as I gave a fast glance around
the room, before closing my eyes to go back to sleep, I have noticed something
was different. Something had obstructed my view from above me. There was
cylindrical shape object looked like gaseous vapor, about 6 feet above
me near the ceiling and was just floating there.. It had this greenish
color. Of course by that point, the panic feeling from my past&nbsp; which
I had completely forgotten came rushing back. By now, I became wide awake
and I looked straight into this levitating object with both of my eyes
wide openned.</B>
<BR><B>It was actually strange and beautiful at the same time. It had this
sparkling membrane, which looked like scales from a snake.&nbsp; As I became
wide awake, it was literally vaporizing in from my eyes and lasted for
about 5 secs. Behind this object, I could see my ceiling piercing through
as it vaporizes.</B>
<BR><B>I would like to convince myself that I was dreaming and possibly
been awake at the same time, but it was so real and I was wide awake when
I was staring at this object.&nbsp; Maybe it was my "3rd eye" that was
looking at this object without being aware.</B>

<BR><B>Hot Lake Hotel</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: iluvthesmelloflizardsinthemorning@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is matt wilson i used to live in eastern oregon, Me and a
friend went to hotlake hotel because we heard it was haunted. Well i have
to admit i was kind of scarred but still sceptical. When we got there we
were amazed at this place, it was huge and creepy. The whole time i walked
around i felt some kind of presence i knew there was restlass spirits there
and i pretty much was a believer that this place was haunted. When me and
my friend stopped to see if we could hear anything, we were completly quite
for about two minutes before we started to hear what sounded like very
faint talking as we listened longer, i was so fucking scared i almost pissed
my pants. The talking we were hearing was starting to sound like two people
arguing yes that sounds fake but this place was abanded and empty and were
the arguing was coming from was where we were just at and there was nobody
up there. And we were miles from anywhere. After we were done in the hotel
we went outside to take some more pictures. So we did and left. Well when
we got those pictues back there was orbs all over them! And that is not
even the crazy part, out of all the pictues we took the only ones with
orbs in them were the pictures with my friend lydia, the orbs were all
around her face and behind her head. it is freakincreepy and im not sure
if i would ever go back there again!!!!!!!!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Wasn't of this World</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: crshin2me94@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>One night in the early 90's my two sisters and I took a walk not
far from our house in Bucks County Pa. We were walking down the road and
saw a brite lite up in the trees at first we thought it might have been
headlights from an on coming car, but there was no car. I thought maybe
one of our neighbors was fooling around with a flashlight, but the light
didn't seem to be coming from any where. It was just there. When we got
closer we saw a face of an older woman in the light. It was the scariestface
I have ever seen. We all screamed and ran like we were running for our
lives. We were brought up very religiosly and taught that there are no
such thing as ghosts, that was over ten years ago I saw what ever it was
and I still don't know what to make of it. But I think that it has changed
my beliefs alittle bit, because after seeing that womans face, I know whatever
it was, it wasn't of this world.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Playing with the Radio</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:sue-allyson-doggies@msn.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; it was about nine thirty p.m. and i was in bed, watching
TV. Well the radio was on very low and I didn't hear it, and when there
is a commercial i hear a noise from my AIM (you kno wut that is rite?).
Well i look over to the computer (there is my bed against the wall and
then the radio and then the computer by the door), and I realize I have
the radio on. "Oh i left the radio on" i say out loud.&nbsp; So i lean
over to turn it off, (and Im wide awake.) and rite b4 i hit the power button,
the radio goes off by itself. The power didn't turn off because the TV
was still on&nbsp; and all. There is NO WAY anything explainable could
hav turned it off. I hit the power button, which normally would hav turned
it on again, but it didn't. The radio cable was out because the radio wouldnt
turn on or off. So, not being scared, and used to it, I say out loud, "Thanks
Gabby." and i finish watching my show and go to bed. Well now im typing
this and I turn on the radio. Working again. And when the radio is shut
down, and when you turn it on again the volume goes all the way back up
to 12 wich is loud, and it did. I think when i was either sleeping or at
school she must have plugged it in again! When I said "oh i left the radio
on" i think Gabby was probably saving me thr little trouble of turning
it off and did it for me. Thanx Gabby! And I think it was her because I
had actually been complaining (lol) about nothing ood happening. (not in
front of anyone so they would get ideas.) So i think she wanted to make
me happy and stop complaining. Which she did! ;)</B><B></B>

<P><B>Things that Happened to Me</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: BNS82@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>After studing Tarot Cards, (and everything that goes with it) for
many long years ,I, as the rest of the readers, had some weird happenings
to myself.&nbsp; It started about twenty-five years ago and lasted for
about two years straight.&nbsp; My four daughters, Mother and myself, rented
a house in Bensenville, Il., it was on five acres of land, and a cute three
bedroom home.&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost immeaditly strange things started inside
and outside the house.&nbsp; The water would turn on outside, after we
all were in bed.&nbsp; No matter how many times we would change the outside
light by the back door, it would be shattered within a few days.&nbsp;
Our lights inside would click on by themselves even our mixmaster turned
on by itself spewing whipped all over the kitchen.&nbsp; My sister stayed
over night and had to leave for home before anyone else had to get up and
our Ghost scared the heck out of her, it clicked on th back porch light,
she even checked to see if any of the girls were playing a prank on her,
they were all sound asleep and snoring.</B>
<BR><B>I used to meditate every night before I went to sleep, sometimes
I fell asleep with the candle still burning. (Keep that in mind as I finish
my story of what happened before the candle incident.)&nbsp; The first
dream I had was like instructions, I was riding a small bike with an ex-boyfriend,
we made a turn into the most beautiful area I have ever seen.&nbsp; We
had to cross a old fashioned cobbllestone bridge onto a path in a forest,
the forest animals were&nbsp; the cutiest and smallest animals, almost
like babies.&nbsp; We got to the end of the path and there was a cobblestone
house with a pourch on three sides. Alone, I walked to the side door&nbsp;
and went itto the kitchen&nbsp; which was a dirty yellow room.&nbsp; I
walked into the next room and it looked like a scrungy librury it had shelf
atter shelf of old books and in the middle of this room a tiny, tiny shriveled
man was laying on a couch.&nbsp; He jumped up and said,"&nbsp; It's about
time you got here, I've have been waiting for you".&nbsp; He led me to
a desk with a bright desk lamp, then pointed to a book that lay opened
on this desk.&nbsp; It was a picture of a ship sailing on the calmest of
seas, then he tald me to look deep into the picture and I was suddenly
on the ship.&nbsp; He than told me to look out into the horison and asked
me what I saw, when I told him I saw nothing except the sea and the sky
meeting on the horison, he then said," You see nothing and yet, you know
that there are people, airplanes and cities beyond the sea then, Why can,t
you believe in the EGO, the Id and the self?"</B>
<BR><B>I had many more dreams during the two years time but that last of
the pranks and instrucional dreams, came when I questioned my teacher.&nbsp;
I fell asleep with my medition candle burning, and again I was being taught
something, but this time I was told to stop going out with men, I just
asked why, and my answer was ," YOU DARE TO QUESTION ME?"; and my candle
smashed to smitherens as he was demanding not to question him.</B>
<BR><B>Now, I can't read cards,there is no more hauntings and no more dreams.&nbsp;
I'm sending this to find any other readers that had the same experiences
I have had</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Paranormal Experiences-Trenton</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: osterbc@muohio.edu</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is something that happened in an old farmhouse my mother lived
in quite a few years ago in a little farmtown in Ohio.&nbsp; When she and
my younger siblings moved in, they would call and tell us things that were
happening around the house.&nbsp; The first thing was the lights either
coming on or going off.&nbsp; I told her to tell her landlord because it
was faulty wiring.&nbsp; However, when my daughter went to spend a week
with them, they were sitting watching TV and the light was turned off.&nbsp;
My sister had to actually get up and turn it back on.&nbsp; So, we knew
things were really going on.&nbsp; Then my mother told me about hearing
cars pull up the lane but when she would get up to go look, nothing would
be there.&nbsp; This went on for a while and then she called and told me
that one night when she heard the car, she thought it was my brother coming
home and she just rolled over and went back to sleep.&nbsp; Later she heard
water running in the tub but it didn't go off.&nbsp; She got up and went
to check thinking my brother turned it on and went to sleep.&nbsp; When
she went in, the tub was almost running over and my brother had not yet
come home.&nbsp; This happened quite often after the first time so they
made sure to check the tub whenever they heard water running.</B>
<BR><B>So, we went to pick our daughter up one summer and I was laying
in bed by the window and everyone else was asleep.&nbsp; I heard a car
pull into the driveway and saw the lights flicker on the window and go
off.&nbsp; I raised up to look but nothing was there so I had proof of
that part of their story.&nbsp; However, after laying back down and trying
to go to sleep, all of a&nbsp; sudden I felt someone or something, lay
their arm across my waist just like laying with spouse spoon fashion.&nbsp;
I screamed so loud I woke the whole house.&nbsp; We figured whoever this
was, my husband and I were in their bedroom.&nbsp; It scared me really
bad at first knowing no one else was in there, but after the initial shock,
I was not afraid because I did not feel threatened by their presence.</B>
<BR><B>These things went on until my family moved out.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Young Boy's Voice</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Shellie538@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>As a teenager I lived in Emory, Texas in Rains County and had a very
strange experience when we first moved there.&nbsp; Our first residence
was in an apartment building that had at one time been the old Rains Co.
School, when the new school was built the old one was abandoned until someone
bought it and decided to turn it into apartment's.&nbsp; During the renovations
a group of local children were in the old school gymnasium playing in what
was being used as a storage building to hold the chemicals and supplies
being used in the work and repairs.&nbsp; Aparrently there was a large
drum of flammable liquid in storage there, reportedly paint thinner, that
was ignited by the children playing with a lighter or matches.&nbsp; In
the ensuing explosion and fire one of the boys was killed and the others
injured to varying degrees, the gymnasium was destroyed but this building
was connected to the part of the school that was being turned to apartments.&nbsp;
The renovations were completed and the apartments were ready to be occupied
hence my family enters the picture, we were the first occupants of apartment
# 12.&nbsp; The first night we were in the apartment we heard a lot of
movement in the attic area which my mother put off as some type of animal
being up there even though it sounded awfully loud to be a small animal
to me.&nbsp; The next day I was talking to my next door neighbors son and
asked him if they had heard anything in the attic the night before, he
said he had heard something every night since they had moved in and said
his parents too had tried to explain it away and something simple.&nbsp;
We talked to some of the other people in the building and found out that
a lot of them had heard the same thing, we also found out&nbsp; that the
ceiling directly over the apartment's were a drop ceiling so that it would
be easier to keep the apartment's cooler in summer and warmer in the winter.&nbsp;
This was very distressing to me because that would make it impossible for
someone to be walking on this but to us it sounded like heavy footprint's
directly overhead, but that&nbsp; isn't the end.&nbsp; After about a week
we kept noticing little things like objects aparrently being moved around
from the places they were being left, the strangest occurance to me was
a music box belonging to my mother that had a baseball on it and played
"Take Me Out To The Ball Game" somehow kept moving off the shelf it sat
on and on to the living room table.&nbsp; Besides being moved around we
would wake up in the middle of the night to the sound of it playing in
the living room, my mother kept blaming my little brother and me for this
until she was home one night alone and woke up to the sound of the music
box playing by itself and sitting on the coffee table even though she knew
that it was on it's shelf when she went to bed that night.</B>
<BR><B>We finally got used to this happening on a regular basis and even
started joking around with each other when we couldn't find something by
saying the ghost must have moved it, even though to my brother and me it
was still a little creepy.&nbsp; Finally Christmas time rolled around and
the fun really began, we put up our Christmas Tree on Thanksgiving Day
right after dinner as is our family custom and took great care in placing
the ornaments as many of them were hand made ornaments from our mother
dating back to the time we were born.&nbsp; The next day we were up bright
and early to head out for our other family tradition, the day after Thanksgiving
shopping spree which was always an all day affair for us.&nbsp; When we
returned that evening we unloaded the car and were dividing up tape, wrapping
paper and bows to go into our rooms and start wrapping gifts when we noticed
that all of the ornaments on the tree were completely rearranged for how
they had been when we left that morning.&nbsp; We then moved them back
to where we wanted them and went on our way wrapping presents and didn't
give it a lot of thought, after we finished this we placed our gifts under
the tree, made hot chocolate and listened to Christmas Music and sang our
personal favorites and went off to bed.&nbsp; The next morning we woke
up only to discover that the ornaments had once again been rearranged and
not only that but the gifts under the tree had also been moved around by
someone during the night and the music box was once again sitting on the
table in front of the couch.&nbsp; By this time we were all pretty well
freaked out but resigned to the fact that no matter what, our guest had
a definate opinion on how things should be and we were fighting a losing
battle.&nbsp; During this time I somehow began to develop an attachment
to our guest and started thinking of them as a member of the family, in
my mind this was the young boy who had been killed during the fire when
the renovations were being done and he was lonely and looking for a friend.&nbsp;
I even started asking our friend where things were when I couldn't find
them and it was almost like something would tell me where to find them,
I even began telling our guest goodnight when I would get ready for bed
at night.&nbsp; This continued throughout the Christmas Season and even
though I had learned to accept things my brother and mother couldn't and
she decided it was time to look for some place else to live, shortly before
the end of January my mother announced she had found a house for us and
we would be moving the first of Feburary.&nbsp; While we were packing for
the move we kept noticing that the things we were boxing up kept appearing
back where they had been like someone didn't want us to leave, which was
very disturbing to me because by now I&nbsp; felt a real attachment to
our guest.&nbsp; One of the saddest moments of my life was when I closed
that apartment door for the last time because I felt like I was leaving
something or someone very important behind, the strangest part was I could
have sworn that I heard a young boy's voice telling me goodbye.</B>

<BR><B>Haunted Life</B><B></B>

<P><B>From:unkorruptable@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I’ve been a fan of your website for a couple of months, and I connected
with</B>
<BR><B>some of the stories that have been listed, although I felt some
of them were</B>
<BR><B>far-fetched.&nbsp; I’ve always been drawn to ghost stories and understanding
the</B>
<BR><B>paranormal, even considering taking college courses in paranormal
studies.</B>
<BR><B>I never really thought about why I was drawn to it till my older
brother and</B>
<BR><B>I were talking about all the different houses we’ve lived in.&nbsp;
Throughout my</B>
<BR><B>life, half of the houses (maybe more) that I’ve lived in have been
haunted.</B>
<BR><B>Ever since I can remember, there was always “something” going on
in my</B>
<BR><B>house, whatever house we were in at the time.</B>
<BR><B>One of the first houses I lived in, the first I can remember, the
previous</B>
<BR><B>owner’s grandmother passed away in the house and decided to stay.&nbsp;
Most of</B>
<BR><B>the haunting, from what I remember (I was 3 – 4 years old at the
time) was</B>
<BR><B>centered in my older sister’s bedroom, but the grandmotherly ghost
liked my</B>
<BR><B>closet too.&nbsp; I figured she liked it because my sister’s closet
and mine</B>
<BR><B>shared the same wall.&nbsp; I was often tucked in by her too.&nbsp;
My memories are</B>
<BR><B>hazy, but I don’t ever remember any harm or maliciousness coming
from her.</B>
<BR><B>Nine years later, the worst haunted house we lived in, well that
one had a</B>
<BR><B>reputation of being spooky.&nbsp; It sat on a double lot, the plants
and grass</B>
<BR><B>overgrown and neglected.&nbsp; Many of the neighbor’s reactions
to us moving in</B>
<BR><B>were… “Oh my God, you’re moving in THERE?!?” No one ever wanted
to tell us</B>
<BR><B>WHY they reacted that way, or they would come up with some lame
excuse for</B>
<BR><B>their reaction such as… “We were just surprised…it’s been empty
for a</B>
<BR><B>while.”&nbsp; We soon found out why, with good cause.&nbsp; It wasn’t
a gradual</B>
<BR><B>haunting, starting off small, it was as if we disrupted someone’s
routine,</B>
<BR><B>and were unwelcome.&nbsp; I still get shivers when I think of that
house, and</B>
<BR><B>living there.&nbsp; The atmosphere was stifling and oppressive.
I was so</B>
<BR><B>frightened I couldn’t get a handle if the spirit was male or female,
but</B>
<BR><B>looking back, I think it was male.&nbsp; He liked playing with electricity,</B>
<BR><B>flickering the lights, and sometimes turning them off completely,
leaving us</B>
<BR><B>in the dark until he found it to his benefit to turn them back on.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>brother and I usually were the only ones to experience these things,
while</B>
<BR><B>our parents continued to be skeptical.&nbsp; They preferred to ignore
the</B>
<BR><B>unexplainable, and hired an electrician to check the breaker panel.&nbsp;
Nothing</B>
<BR><B>was found, no surprise to my brother and me.&nbsp; I was stressed,
trying to stay</B>
<BR><B>out of the house as much as possible, getting by however I could.&nbsp;
Then I</B>
<BR><B>had THE nightmare. To give you a little background on this, at that
time I</B>
<BR><B>had a Winnie the Pooh giant stuffed bear that I had since I was
3.&nbsp; In my</B>
<BR><B>dream, he grew claws and teeth and flew through the air, chasing
us from the</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; We needed to get away from that place, that was the
message in the</B>
<BR><B>dream, loud and clear.&nbsp; Waking up from the dream, I looked
across my bedroom</B>
<BR><B>to see my Pooh bear looking at me.&nbsp; I could have sworn I had
put him in the</B>
<BR><B>back of my closet!&nbsp; That was enough for me!&nbsp; I ran to
my brother’s room and</B>
<BR><B>dived in his bed.&nbsp; I sobbed and begged him to let me sleep
with him, and he</B>
<BR><B>held me and calmed me down.&nbsp; Soon after that, my father lost
his job and we</B>
<BR><B>lost the house.&nbsp; Thank God for miracles in disguise.</B>
<BR><B>A few years after that, we lived in a house where the owner died
in MY</B>
<BR><B>bedroom.&nbsp; The haunting was slow and gradual, and it was my
first experience</B>
<BR><B>with night terrors.&nbsp; I wrote it off as being stressed, and
at this time I</B>
<BR><B>was a little more well-read on the subject.&nbsp; I knew that being
a teenager, I</B>
<BR><B>was more susceptible to poltergeists and high anxiety paranormal
activity.</B>
<BR><B>But then, my brother experienced the presence too.&nbsp; We were
laying on my</B>
<BR><B>bed, talking, and this… “thing” came in through my window, traveled
between</B>
<BR><B>us, and circled the room, exiting from where it came.&nbsp; I say
“thing” because</B>
<BR><B>it was invisible, but we felt it, heard the energy in the form of
a high</B>
<BR><B>pitched ringing.&nbsp; I felt more relieved I wasn’t alone, or crazy.</B>
<BR><B>Since then, I’ve experienced many more spirits, night terrors and
d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</B>
<BR><B>experiences…I seem to be sensitive to these things.&nbsp; I would
appreciate any</B>
<BR><B>and all feedback.</B>

<BR><B>He's Still Here</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: robi5304@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My friend and I moved into this older house that has been made into
apartments, When we first moved in there we felt something in the house,
but never really gave it much thought until one night we started hearing
things move up and down the hallway and go into the living room. One night
me and some friends went into the storage room, (which has no electricity)
lit some candles and just sat there. We heard something walking down the
hallway, then something was breathing really heavy through the crack of
the door, then the door opened, nobody ways sitting by the door. that’s
when we all jumped up and ran into the kitchen to find out all the doors
were slammed shut, we didn’t shut any doors. then we seen the front room
door slowly opening and the mirror fell of the wall.</B>
<BR><B>Well the next day we asked our landlord about the house and he didn’t
have any history on the house. Then we went to the city office and found
out a little there like the house was built in 1865, and we also found
out some of the old owners, from there we went on to talk to the older
people that has lived around the house, and found out that some guy died
in the middle part of the apartment and it all used to be one house, and
we live in his attic.</B>
<BR><B>Its really creepy, and we have talked to a lot of people about it,
but he is still there, which I have never seen him, but I can sense him
and hear him. We have gotton a lot of advice but nothing seems to work!!</B>

<BR><B>Crying Girl in the Laundry Room</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cadys_angel@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hey, i was browsing your site, and decided to send my experiance.</B>
<BR><B>This happened in about September 2003. I was spending the night
at my best friend Leanda's house, and she was upsairs getting another movie
(her house is 3 stories) and i was in the family room, rewinding the movie
wee just watched, and i heard something in her laundry room (we where the
only ones there) nd also her dog was barking at something in there. I peeked
in there to see what the noise was, and i saw a little girl sitting there
with long brown hair, wearing a white dress with little flowers on it (like
a flower girls dress), and she had her head in her hands sobing. I was
a little spooked, but i'm used to seeing ghost (i have a sixth sense).
So i just ignored it, but went upstairs to get leanda.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;when we came back down as i passed the laundry room, i glanced
in there and the girl was gone. we turned out the lights to watch our horror
movie, and about, 15-20 min. later i saw someone walk by the stairs and
then down the stairs. i noticed it was the girl. she started to walk towards
us, and i put my feet up and under my blanket, cuase, well, i was scared...
and she sat down on the rocking chair right next to me. i wispered to leanda
if she see's the little girl in the rock g chair, she looked at me like
i was crazy and went back to the movie. when we went to bed, (we slept
in the family room) it was about 2-3 in the morning, and i was kinda sleepy.
i looked around the room just because, and i dosed off. i woke up cuase
i had to go to the bathroom, so i went upstairs and i saw the girl go into
leanda's room, and as she turned i saw blood all over her back, like she
was stabbed. so i went to the bath room real fast and ran downstairs and
went to bed.</B>

<P><B>Shoe Factory</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Hotbarbq22@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>hello i wrote here earlier about my experiences at my house, but
when i looked at the postuing for haunted places in illinois about shoe
factory road i was a little creeped.&nbsp; a buddy and me went in evey
house and bard that was abbandoned and alot of weirdthings happened that
we couldnt explain. from the sound of a faling ball in the upstairs. The
slamming door which i got on camera. but when we were in the basement we
expeirneced the weirdest of all. There was a pile of ashes on the concrete
floor and there was one window that was broken adn the light was seeping
through.When we saw it on camera it lookedl iek a face in the ashes.&nbsp;
But when we were snooping around hte basement there was an old dart board
wit had a green and a blue dart in it. We picked it up and we searched
for cool things to take home, we decided to drop the darts and when we
were walkign out those darts were stuck in the back of the door that we
came in. Which were not there before. And the last experine on show factory
road was the old silo that was mentioned in the listings. we were messing
around in the silo and we loked up and a huge rock fell from the top, and
almost killed my brother by barley missing his head.&nbsp; I didnt realize
this untill rite now when i read all the lsitings on the Shoe. Factory
Road.&nbsp; But all those houses are really weird and unexplanalble and
should be investigated bc these things are really freaky and everyone should
expeience it.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Odd Death</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>It was July 19th 1993. We were sitting in our Honalulu home just
south of Cancun.I was giving a customer a job interview when suddenly the
customers eyes turned a grousom black colour.I raised my eyebrows, staired
at the customer confused and the customer rouse from his seat, held up
his hands, screamed and fled from the scene. I looked around the room and
for some reason the room was giving off a deadly scent, this scent was
so horrible that i had to leave the room. i slept in a motel for the night
and in the morning i went back to my home and found that same person who
i was giving the interview to on the floor i turned him over and his face
was a gastly blue colour , his eyes were white , pure white, immediatly
i called the police, they came over and put the body on the stretcher.</B>
<BR><B>A few weeks past and i hadn't left the house. Friends and family
were beginning to worry. They came over to my house one night and questioned
me. Since that night Ive been hearing creepy noises coming from that room
that the customer died in"HELP,HELP" screams was what i heard. I would
hate to think that because i stayed in a motel that night i had something
to do with that death.</B>
<BR><B>My family and I moved out the summer of 96. Since then the house
was knocked down and is now believe it or not a cemetary.</B>
<BR><B>Thank you for listening to my story. I want you to remember my story
was not exadurated in anyway this really happened to me.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The USS Frederick Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>by Dragon</B><B></B>

<P><B>You know, every ship in the Navy has a ghost, or at least that's
what they</B>
<BR><B>say. I've been in the Navy for 11 years now and I'm on my 4th ship.
I</B>
<BR><B>haven't noticed a ghost on all of them, but that doesn't mean they
weren't</B>
<BR><B>there.</B>
<BR><B>I did notice one though, a few times. The ship was USS Frederick
(LST 1184)</B>
<BR><B>it's decommissioned now, but when I was there, I met the ship's
ghost before</B>
<BR><B>anyone even told me there was one.</B>
<BR><B>But for the sake of the reader, I'm going to tell the story about
how the</B>
<BR><B>ghost came to be first, and then I'll tell you how I met him.</B>
<BR><B>All Navy ships have a compartment called a Sea Chest. This is a
void on the</B>
<BR><B>bottom deck of the ship that is used for quick ballast. It can suck
in</B>
<BR><B>water, or force water out by creating either a positive or a negative
vacuum</B>
<BR><B>in the space. Needless to say, you don't want to be in one when
it's</B>
<BR><B>operating.</B>
<BR><B>Well, this poor soul on the ship went down into one of the sea chests
one</B>
<BR><B>day during his watch. He didn't have to be in there, but he wanted
to take a</B>
<BR><B>nap and not get caught. Well, nobody knew he was in there, and nobody</B>
<BR><B>bothered to check, and they engineer lit off the sea chest pumps
creating</B>
<BR><B>the vacuum in the space. Within seconds, the poor kids head imploded
as the</B>
<BR><B>air got sucked out of his body.</B>
<BR><B>Now his ghost haunts the ship. It travels from space to space (mainly
in</B>
<BR><B>engineering) looking for people that are sleeping on watch. If he
finds you</B>
<BR><B>sleeping, and you're on watch, he will violently wake you up. This
could be</B>
<BR><B>anything from making a loud noise to what he did to me.</B>
<BR><B>I was sitting in my shop; it was around 2300 (that's 1100pm for
those that</B>
<BR><B>don't know 24 hour time). I was technically on watch, but my watch
was an</B>
<BR><B>"on call" watch where they just needed to know where I was in case
I was</B>
<BR><B>needed. I didn't have to stay up, or even stay in my shop, but I
was up and</B>
<BR><B>in my shop and I got tired, so I leaned back in my chair facing
the door and</B>
<BR><B>closed my eyes for a quick power nap.</B>
<BR><B>Now, my desk was against the bulkhead (wall) to the left, and was
facing the</B>
<BR><B>door. The only way into and out of my shop was through a large metal-gated</B>
<BR><B>door that squeaked and rattled when it moved. Along with that, the
only way</B>
<BR><B>to get to me was to walk around the right hand side of the desk,
which was</B>
<BR><B>at that time a maze of broken equipment that I was working on.</B>
<BR><B>I was sleeping for maybe five minutes, and I was by no means, sound
asleep.</B>
<BR><B>But out of nowhere I felt someone punch me on the left hand side
of my</B>
<BR><B>chest, really hard. I had a bruise there the next day. No, I didn't
see him,</B>
<BR><B>but I know it was the ghost for a few reasons, 1. There was no way
for</B>
<BR><B>anyone to get in my shop without me knowing it. 2. No one could
have hit me</B>
<BR><B>as hard, or where I was hit without first coming around my desk,
and second</B>
<BR><B>breaking my pen which I kept in my left chest pocket. The final
reason I</B>
<BR><B>know it was the ghost was because I immediately opened my eyes and
saw no</B>
<BR><B>one there.</B>
<BR><B>The next night was the kicker about that ghost. He never went into
the</B>
<BR><B>berthings (that's where everyone sleeps). Some say it was because
not enough</B>
<BR><B>people on the ship believed in him, but I think it was simply because
people</B>
<BR><B>are allowed to sleep in there. But that night, he went into my berthing.
I</B>
<BR><B>was in my rack (bed) and I had that feeling that I was being watched.
So I</B>
<BR><B>woke up, opened the curtain on my rack and looked out to see who
was there</B>
<BR><B>and what they wanted. There stood the ghost, I knew it was the ghost
because</B>
<BR><B>he had no head. He was standing there facing my rack, when he noticed
me</B>
<BR><B>looking at him he gave a small bow, which I took as he was sorry
about the</B>
<BR><B>night before, he hadn't known that I wasn't sleeping on watch.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Helping Hand</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Hotbarbq22@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>well it all began when i was little, i have always wanted to expirence
things of the supernatural.&nbsp; this was soon to be answered.&nbsp; It
all came in a one year period.&nbsp; i was very young and i had trouble
sleeping in the hot humid summer nights.&nbsp; And when i was just about
to doze off i would hear noises down the hallway.&nbsp; (My room at the
end of the hall) When on day i heard a loud bang and i was suddnely awake
and sweating.&nbsp; When i was about to fall back asleep i heard lound
footsteps running down my hallway and my door flew open and crashed against
the wall and there was no one on the other side.&nbsp; It broke the lock
on my door and it is still there today to remind me of my frightful experience.&nbsp;
But that was the first of the many things that happen.&nbsp; After abotu
a week after that i started to hear a sound from the bathroom around the
corner from the hall. it sounded like someone would drop a hammer in the
tub and i would be the only one to hear it,&nbsp; and when the noise started
to fade away it came back again,&nbsp; out of curiousity i said a random
number and then a few seconds later the banging did the same number and
i was amazed.&nbsp; I started to get used to it so when little things would
happen i would go along with it like it was nothing.&nbsp; But this was
the most recent one which scared the bagebbers out of me.&nbsp; It was
a late night and i jsut got off the computer and was making my lunch for
school thenext day,&nbsp; when i was done with that i made myself some
lft overs from dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp; I took out the porkchops and set them
on a plate and then took out my silver wear,&nbsp; once i was ready to
eat o grabbed a napkin and when i turned around the porkchop was cut up
into 12 peices and the silverwear was in the ceiling.&nbsp; i sat there
in awe for a few minutes and then they fell at the same time and when i
pick them up there was notihng on it and no marks in the ceiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But the porkchop was good.</B>

<P><B>Help from the Other Side</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Eroseblossom@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My mom has always told me that my dad and my uncle looked like twins.
But what was funny was that my dad is they youngest out of 4 childeren
and my uncle is the oldest. Well my uncle looked after my dad since my
dad was born. Well, after my uncle died my dad could still feel his presence
around. It is odd is that my mom was the one that could feel my uncle the
strongest. My mom told me that when my uncle was around she got this staticy
feeling, ya know, like when you touch the TV and it is all staticy? Well
one night one of my other uncles were spending the night. (This uncle likes
to cause misschief while over) And my mom woke up with the staticy feeling.
It lasted all night and she didn't get once ounce of sleep. Well the next
morining my uncle looked really tired and when he left I asked my mom what
happened. She told me what he said. My uncle woke up in the night to 'go
to the bathroom' (or so he says) and he saw someone sitting in the rocker
across from him. He thought it was my dad but the person was taller and
alot paler, he looked like a mist almost. He also noticed that it was deadly
cold in his room. As he got up to 'go to the bathroom' he got this feeling
of emense anger and hurt so immediatly he sat back down. As he lay back
down he kept staring at the figure in the chair. But the figure just gave
him a cold, evil, hungry stare. My uncle got really scared he thought that
the figure was going to get up and attack him. But the more my uncle looked
at the figure he realized that the figure looked alot like his oldest brother.
Now he got REALLY scared. Suddenly he became very cold, almost like the
figure was touching him. The figure watched him all night. The next&nbsp;
morning my uncle couldn't wait to get home. That's what I call help from
the other side.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Still on the Stairs</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: AMichelle.Ardire@mortgagefamily.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I wanted to share my story with you.&nbsp; My family has been followed
by the</B>
<BR><B>same 2 or 3 poltergeists since I was born.&nbsp; They moved with
us when my</B>
<BR><B>parents moved from their apartment where I was born, to our old
house, then</B>
<BR><B>our current home.&nbsp; For the most part they are benign, and like
to play</B>
<BR><B>harmless pranks, such as hiding keys, toys, moving chairs, etc.
But they can</B>
<BR><B>turn mean if you reprimand them.&nbsp; I remember one time I was
upset and had</B>
<BR><B>yelled at them for taking my purse; I wasn't upset with the prank.&nbsp;
All of a</B>
<BR><B>sudden it got really cold in the room and I felt this sharp pain
on my arm.</B>
<BR><B>I rolled up my sleeve and saw scratch marks that fit the form of
finger</B>
<BR><B>nails.&nbsp; That was the only time in my entire life that I ever
recall them</B>
<BR><B>reacting violently against me.&nbsp; For the most part we don't
mind having them</B>
<BR><B>around, but we don't know who they are or why they've stayed with
us all</B>
<BR><B>these years (almost 30).&nbsp; Until recently, we've never really
physically seen</B>
<BR><B>their presence. However, I've started seeing shadows cast on&nbsp;
the walls of</B>
<BR><B>the house, when I'm the only one in the room, and they are distinctly
male.</B>
<BR><B>When I look back, the shadows are in a different location.&nbsp;
However my</B>
<BR><B>daughter sees them on a regular basis. She's even described one
as being</B>
<BR><B>very tall with red eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the poltergeists,
we have reason</B>
<BR><B>to believe my grandfather still walks around the house. He died
in the house</B>
<BR><B>when my mom was 3.&nbsp; He's the only one who does not try to communicate
with</B>
<BR><B>us, and we've stopped trying to speak with him. He doesn't really
do</B>
<BR><B>anything to let us know he's there, but my sister sees him every
once in a</B>
<BR><B>while near the bathroom or the stairs.</B>

<P><B>Many Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:stzmoravec@shaw.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>I first wanted to thank you for having such a great site. I really
enjoy the stories and the advice.</B>
<BR><B>I am 28 years old, married and have two children. My husband is
and always will be a skeptic, know better. I have been able to feel see
and hear things that I can't explain for many years. As a child I heard
voices that nobody else did. Our school had more than one spirit but no
one believed me. I was a poor kid and nobody took me seriously. My mother
and I lived in a very old 4 unit apartment building in the suburb of Ville
Lasalle in Montreal Quebec. There we're many instances in that apartment
but one stands out more than the others. My mom and I we're sitting at
the kitchen table and she had just finished putting the plates and knives
and forks on the table with a small glass for each of us. Suddenly, the
lights flickered and the plates started spinning on the table. They didn't
go anywhere, they just spun around on their bases in front of us. The lights
flickered again and then they stopped. We had both seen dark shadows and
had some pretty weird dreams. I never liked that place.</B>
<BR><B>While I was in high school my best friend lived in Richmond British
Columbia in a house that had frequent phenomena. My best friend's brother
was dying of aids and the family often needed a sitter for his little sister
so that they could visit him without traumatizing her. I was alone in the
house with the little girl and the family dog. I was sitting on the couch
when I heard a loud creak behind me. I turned around to see a large shape
directly behind me. It was dark yet see through. It was tall and bore the
silhouette of a man. The door to the fridge was also opening of it's own
accord. There was no tilt to the floor and there was no way the door could
open without force as it was an old fridge and had a tight seal around
it. I was also in the bathroom the same night and the&nbsp; lights kept
going on and off. I left as soon as my friend got home. I ran home.&nbsp;
I told him the next day about what happened and he wasn't surprised. Apparently
he and his mother we're sitting in the living room and they heard what
sounded like cans and metal being thrown around in the pantry. It was really
loud and couldn't be ignored. When they went downstairs and checked the
pantry everything was in place. When they got to the&nbsp; top of the stairs
it started again. They didn't check it out a second time. His mother had
also seen a man in a grey housecoat standing in her bedroom doorway on
numerous occasions.&nbsp; A few weeks later I was attending his little
sisters birthday at their house and for once, I actually didn't feel see
or here anything unusual. We all took pictures and some people brought
video cameras.&nbsp; A few days later my buddy called me up and said I
had to come over right away. He had something to show me. When I got there
he showed me a picture from the roll he had just developed from his sisters
birthday. It was black except for two very large, very red eyes in the
middle of the picture. When he took the picture originally it was of his
sister with all of us around the kitchen table and all the lights in the
kitchen we're on. There was a cake on the table and presents around the
cake. I didn't believe him at first. I thought he was messing with me.
I could tell though that he was genuinely scared and I have to admit, I
was really creeped out myself. I wouldn't visit him after that.&nbsp; Seeing
dark shadows is one thing but that's a bit too much for me. His brother
died shortly thereafter and they moved away.</B>
<BR><B>While I was pregnant with my daughter, I lived in a house next door
to a Jehovah's Witness Hall with 3 roommates. They lived in the upstairs
and my boyfriend and I lived downstairs. There we're two rooms downstairs
and one creepy little closet. My boyfriend and I we're asleep in our room
one night and I woke up rather suddenly because I felt that someone was
watching me. I had my 3 year old son in the next room and I thought that
maybe he had gotten up and was standing near the bed. I sat up and there
was a little girl, maybe 9 or 10 at the foot of my bed . She had long blond
curly hair and deep blue eyes. She had dark circles under her eyes and
was very pale. She looked so sad. I was petrified so I poked my boyfriend
in the ribs but he wouldn't wake up. I closed my eyes and opened them again
and she was gone.&nbsp; I told my roommates the next day and they didn't
believe me. They all believed in ghosts but didn't think there was one
in this house.&nbsp; They changed their minds a few days later though.
There we're 5 of us in the basement&nbsp; and we we're talking about ghosts.&nbsp;
A friend of ours said that we we're nuts and that we needed to get a grip.
There are no such things as ghosts. At the time I had a large collection
of small porcelain masks that I kept on the wall. Slowly, they started
to fly off the wall. They slowly crept off the nail as if someone was deliberately
making a point and then we're flung to the floor next to my feet The guy
who said that ghost don't exist thought it was funny and started laughing.
The door that led up to the upstairs part of the house slammed shut with
such force that is almost ripped off the hinges. There was no breeze, no
wind, no open doors that could have caused a draft like that. I guess Our
ghost was not impressed. I left the house and stayed elsewhere for a few
days.&nbsp; My female roommate was also pregnant at the time and eventually
had her baby. The baby died about a month after it was born. Apparently
it had a seizure. I don't know if it had something to do with that little
girl ghost but sometimes I wonder.</B>
<BR><B>It doesn't seem to matter whose place&nbsp; I am at, sometimes I
wake up with a figure of a man standing over me. It leans in very close
and I feel like it's looking at me, Some times I reach out, to touch it
and see is It's actually there.My husband thinks I'm dreaming and shakes
my shoulder but I know I am awake and I know it's there. It's in my dreams
too. It doesn't scare me in my dreams It warns me about things that are
going to happen. And they usually do.</B>
<BR><B>I was sitting in a hot bath about two weeks ago and I was alone
in the house. I was hunched over trying to remove the plug when I felt
something sitting behind me. Like a man who has his arms around you. I
was alone in the house and knew that there was no physical thing there.
I asked it to go away and slowly it did.&nbsp; I didn't have the gumption
to turn around and look at it either. I have only been living in this place
for 6 months after moving to Edmonton From British Columbia. I didn't like
the vibe of this place but we didn't have a choice in locations for housing.</B>
<BR><B>I have spent allot of time in Hospitals over the years a and have
come close to death on a couple of occasions. There was one hospital room
that&nbsp; stands out. I was in St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver BC after
having numerous seizures while I was pregnant. The room was ice cold, you
could almost see your breath. I always felt like there was someone else
in the room with me. Especially at night. Everyone that visited me commented
on it. The nurses wouldn't even come and look in on me at night. I think
it was the ghost of a nun(s). The hospital used to be a nunnery many many
years ago. The presence was very strong.There was a whole wing that was
boarded up and my room was very near it's old entrance at the farthest
corner of the building. I kept seeing shadows out of the corner of my eye.
I was very happy to be transferred to a different hospital. It was just
too creepy.</B>
<BR><B>I was in BC Children's Hospital for 3 months prior to having my
daughter. I was in a section reserved for mothers who are ill but not terminally.
I often took walks along the halls and visited the palliative care unit.
There we're many children there with cancer or leukemia, some had aids
some needed transplants and others we're ill with various terminal diseases.
I noticed that there was a kid there that never seemed to talk or say anything.
He didn't interact with the other children. They never noticed him. He
looked very sick and tired. He just looked around him and seemed to soak
up the scene. His eyes we're alive, but his body looked so pale and weak.
One day I started to feel curious about him (More than normal)&nbsp; and
decided to talk to him and find out more about him .He wasn't there so
I went up to the nurses counter and described the little boy I had been
seeing. I wanted to know what room he was in and if I could visit him.
She went a little pale and told me that they had a patient that matched
that description but that he had died weeks earlier.&nbsp; There are many&nbsp;
children there that are not necessarily human. I guess I'm privileged enough
to have seen one.</B>
<BR><B>When I was younger (I don't remember how old) My mom and I we're
staying at a friend of hers. I was dead asleep in the bedroom when I woke
up, screamed and ran to the back door. My mom couldn't figure out what
the problem was and she put me back to bed. She figured that it was just
because I was in a strange place and It was probably just a nightmare.
We went home a few days later and my mom thought nothing of it. We received
a letter shortly thereafter notifying us of the death of my aunt. It occurred
on the same night at the same time as I had my screaming fit.We didn't
have a phone and the only way to contact us was to write. She had cancer
and died a painful agonizing death.</B>
<BR><B>I have had so may different experiences that it would take me hours
to type so I'll leave you with this for the moment. I am grateful for people
like you and for your website.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: miffy456uk@yahoo.co.uk</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>even though my story is not as amazing as the others on this site
i thought i would share it anyway. i have always believed in ghosts and
spirits and this experience confirmed my belief. althouhg i cannot remember
this it was related to me by my mum and dad (my dad is the biggest sceptic
in the world!) and even he believes it. when i was about 3/4 mum and dad
took me for a day trip to Chislehurst Caves in Kent, England built by romans
in BC. i was in a push chair and we were given a guided tour round the
caves which are very cold and spooky. we had just about entered the caves
when i shouted out "Hello Elizabeth!" quite loudly. Mum and dad thought
nothing of it until the guide took us to a pool named the "haunted pool".
here the guide told the group that a lady had been murdered by the pool
and her name was Elizabeth. mum and dad were shocked and there was no way
i knew anything about the ghost beforehand - i was only 3/4! The caves
used to hold a competition every Hallowe'en where a person had to stay
the night by the haunted pool on their own. one man became seriously ill
and another saw a mist rise out of the floor which looked like a lady.
one man was lying in his sleeping bag and he was found with his arm twisted
up his back and out of it's socket and he was still in his sleeping bag!
not suprisingly they decided to stop the competion!</B>

<BR><B>Dead &amp; alive..... at the same time?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: blackvgcoupe@eftel.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>It was 8:30pm on a weeknight me and my girlfriend J were in our bedroom
watching a bit of tv, halfway through watching a movie i seen her leave
to go to the kitchen to do something, so i waited for 5-10 minutes for
her to return back to the room, after waiting i decided to go down there
myself to see what she was doing, i walked down the hallway and i looked
in the kitchen and she was not there, so i go through the dinning room
and then through the lounge room and into the kitchen from there, and there
she was, getting some wheetbix;</B>
<BR><B>so i walked over to her and said you gonna have something to eat,
and she turned and nodded, so i turned around and back again to see her
making her way back to the bedroom, she just got the start of the hallway
door when i ran up to ask her something, but by the time i got to where
she started to walk, she had just vanished into thin air.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;So i walked back to the room and there she was watching the
tv again; so i asked her if she'd finished eating her wheetbix she had
made herself,</B>
<BR><B>and she said what wheetbix, and i said back the ones you just had,
and she kept trying to tell me she did not have any, so i told her i had
seen her waiting for the kettle to finish boiling , and she told me she
did not so i walked back down to the kitchen and sure enough the kettel
was stone cold,</B>
<BR><B>after i stood there for 2 minutes wathcing it boil away, seeing
the steam hearing it bubble, that's when i knew i had a very close encounter
with a GHOST.</B>
<BR><B>So there is me thinking it was J when it was not.</B>

<P><B>Sandy, Utah</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Ruspeedracer9713@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I moved to Sandy about four years ago strange things started
happening to me, mentally and visually. It seems like the whole neighborhood
is haunted. My first experiances started while attending school at Alta
View Elementary. Toilets would flush, papers would fly into the air, chairs
would move, and sometimes you can hear a terrible crying in the bathroom
along with running footsteps. All of my friends and aquaintences that live
in "white city" tell stories of their haunted houses. Rumors have been
spread about the neighborhood being built on some kind of satanic ground.
At first I was skeptic, but that was until things started happening to
me first hand. I started hearing noises coming from my attic: singing,
crying, and screams. The attic door is in my closet to make things worse.
After a couple months of living in my house the closet would start to shake
and things would fall mysteriously like clothes flying around and stuff
like that. That lasted a while but then suddenly stopped and transfered
to the basement. Things would fall, break, move mysteriously and as soon
as you step down to the basement floor a rush of cold air would come over
you. I tried not to pay any attention until I saw a large male figure standing
before me one night. This happened many times, along with strange dreams
and visions. Well to make a long story short Sandy Utah should be added
to the haunted places of Utah, ask anyone...</B>

<P><B>Here is My Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: carlaweber@myway.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I found your site and was browsing through all your pictures and
was surprised to read so many stories and see pictures that are similar
to mine.&nbsp; I am inclosing some pictures that I took at my house recently
while some friends were over.</B>
<BR><B>Since my husband and I have moved into our home 5 years ago, I have
always felt as if there was someone else always there with us.&nbsp; One
night I woke up at one in the morning for no reason.&nbsp; I was trying
to go back to sleep when I heard many voices talking downstairs as if there
was a party happening.&nbsp; I saw my husband next to me asleep and so
I&nbsp; knew there was no one downstairs.&nbsp; I began to really become
alert and wide awake and the voices continued so I decided to go down stairs
and see if the T.V. was left on or something.&nbsp; When I opened my bedroom
door, the noises stopped and I could see that all the lights were off.&nbsp;
I walked down the stairs about half way to look out at my living room to
find nothing.&nbsp; Everything was in order.&nbsp; I went back to bed and
went to sleep.&nbsp; This has happened several times to me.&nbsp; I can
even hear people walking around, laughing, music playing.&nbsp; My husband
does not believe me of course.</B>
<BR><B>My mother was staying at our house for a night along with my little
brother.&nbsp; I have a guest room so my mom slept in it while my brother
slept on the couch.&nbsp; The next morning I asked my mom how she slept
and she told me that she woke up in the middle of the night to someone
walking into the bedroom and standing at the foot of the bed.&nbsp; She
thought it was my brother and asked him if he wanted to share the bed with
her.&nbsp; The figure did not say anything, but walked up next to her.&nbsp;
She said that she got scared because she realized that it was not my brother.
She said that she became paralyzed and could feel the figure touching her
chest and stomach area.&nbsp; She said that as quickly as it came it was
gone and she slept the rest of the night.&nbsp; My mom is a pastors wife
and has never said that she believed in ghosts, until she stayed in my
house.</B>
<BR><B>A few months past and I never shared the story with anyone because
no one believed me.&nbsp; My friends came over on a weekend and we took
some pictures up in the guest room, just being silly.&nbsp; My girlfriend
and her boyfriend spent the night as they have several times.&nbsp; Well
I went to bed first along with my girlfriend who slept in the guest room.&nbsp;
The guys stayed up late that night.&nbsp; The next day, my girlfriend told
me the exact same story that my mother had.&nbsp; She woke up to find someone
coming into the room and thought that it was her boyfriend and told him
to go to bed.&nbsp; The same incident happened.&nbsp; Now because I had
not told anyone about my moms story, I knew that it was no coincidence.&nbsp;
I have many more things that have happened since then. I don't know if
there is more than one spirit in my house or not.&nbsp; Sometimes I get
a real negative feeling and other times its not so bad.&nbsp; We are going
to by a digital camera soon and it will be interesting to see what shows
up in the pictures. I know that this house was built in the 80's and there
has been about 3 or 4 owners before us.&nbsp; No one has died here to my
knowledge.&nbsp; I have always been sensitive to the super natural and
have always had a fascination for the subject since I was very little.&nbsp;
Thank you for all of your research that you have shared and all the stories
that you put on your site.&nbsp; It comforts me to know that not everyone
thinks I'm crazy.&nbsp; If you would like to talk to me about anything
you can e&nbsp; mail me at carlaweber@myway.com . Thanks again and maybe
I will have some more to share with you soon.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; Toys-R-Us- Sunnyvale, Ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gross363@bellsouth.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was reading on your famous hauntings part about Toys R Us. ANd
it had mentioned stories submitted by other people. Well, I went to the
one on page four and read it. And it remind me of something a friend of
mine told me back in 1994.</B>
<BR><B>Now, first off, let me say my friend never lied to me. He was a
honest person to a fault. Just a wonderful caring person. Well, one day
a couple of us are walking along at school and my friend, Art, started
to tell me about what happened to him the night before. What stands out
the most about him telling me this is that he was totally perplexed.</B>
<BR><B>He went to the Toys R Us the night before. Nothing happened for
a while, but he started hitting cold spots. Then he was on the aisle with
the toy guns. He was well past the toy guns, with his mom and brother farther
down the aisle, when they started coming off the shelf. He told me that
him and his family were the only ones on that aisle, as it was late at
night. Well, he went and picked them up (that's the kind of guy he is)
and started to leave. When he got under the sign saying the aisle number
and stuff he hit a cold spot. His mother and brother had stopped to watch
him pick up the guns, and they saw the sign start swinging when he got
under it. They pointed it out to him. So, he just casually walks away,
it stops swinging. But when he was about to exit the aisle, all the guns
he picked up fell off the shelves again. This time he just left them there
and the store.</B>
<BR><B>Well, as I said, we were walking with other friends. One of them,
Josh, gives us this look, and asks if he's talking about the store on El
Camino. Yeah, it was. Josh asks if we didn't know that that was the haunted
store. I had no clue about it being haunted. I had been there many times
before and after that day and nothing has ever happened to me. Which sucks!</B>
<BR><B>Well, seeing as we were in high school and loved to talk, Josh starts
telling us about what happened to a friend of ours who worked there. Now,
I know he was telling the truth, cause one, this story was too simple,
and two, Josh never lies about certin stuff- supernatural being one.</B>
<BR><B>So, he is telling us how Shane worked as a stockman there. He would
have to go up to the stock room and send down boxes and such. This was
sent down a chute/slide thing. Well, Shane wore big ol combat boots that
clomped. So everyone working there would know when it was him up there.</B>
<BR><B>Ok, so Shane would be up there, waiting for orders on what to send
down. And he would be the only one up there. Yet he would here footsteps
and voices. And the workers below would here it too. And they all knew
it wasn't Shane, cause of the boots. It got to the point he was always
up there doing this job, and everytime he would hear stuff. He always joked
about it.</B>
<BR><B>Well, that's about it for that store, that I know of. As I said,
I've been there alot, and nothing ever happened to me. So sad</B><B></B>

<P><B>They come back....My haunted house</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: AngeINTn83@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have lived in my current home for 6 years now. It has always been
haunted. All of my family has heard and seen things. The ghosts at my home
are always messing with anything that is electronic. We have 3 radios in
my home, but they only mess with 1 of the radios and only in certain rooms.
In 3 of the rooms in my house, the ghosts turn this radio on atleast once
a week. Right now the radio is in the living room where it turns it on.
In my little brother's room, they turn his television volume up. One night
I woke up to the T.V. blairing, so I got the remote and turned it down.
Just a few minutes later I heard it getting louder, and I looked up to
see the volume bars on the tv turning up. We have had 2 different T.V's
in that room and it has done it to both of them, but only in this room.
We have a computer in the kitchen. We were all eating Thanksgiving dinner
when the computer by itself sighned on to AOL. To sign on to AOL, one must
put in a pass word, well the computer did it on its own. My whole family
saw that. I have been on the computer when a loud voice told me to "get
off". Ofcourse I signed off and immediatley left that room. They have turned
on our fan light when my parents were watching television. I have seen
a woman with dark hair wearing a white dress, I have seen a little boy
with overalls on, I have also seen a black dog. My mother has seen all
of these ghosts. My little brother has seen the most, though. He has seen
all of the ones i've seen, plus he has seen a bawled man wearing a dress,
a burned man, and a headless man wearing a tuxedo. A psychic came to our
house and without us telling him anything, he named what we are seeing
and where we see them at. He even saw the balwed man in the dress. He said
that man is crazy and was really mean when he was alive. We hear footsteps
all the time. Our two dogs bark and look around when there is nothing there.
We came home after X-mas shopping and one of the dogs was shaking hysterically
and would not leave my side. My grandmother has ran into one of the ghosts
thinking it was me because she had blonde hair like mine. It was not me,
however. I was asleep.&nbsp; My grandmother woke up one night and a man
was in bed with her.She said it looked like his skin was sinking into his
skull. She does not live in my house anymore. She rarely stays the night.
My mother and I have both been laying on the couch a different times and
the couch has started shaking. We have had guests that have been staying
the night who have left because of seeing ghosts and hearing things. The
toaster in the kitchen was slammed up and down on the kitchen counter.
Recently, my mother, brother and I have all felt blowing in our ears. My
mom felt someone breathe cold air on her leg. I was laying in my bed and
someone slapped me on the head. Our neighbors have also experienced things.
One night my parents were home alone and heard someone going through the
silverwear drawer. My father checked the house and no one was there. The
next morning my mother asked our neighbor how she was and she replied "I
would've been a lot better if I hadn't been kept up all night to someone
going through my silverwear" . One day a cable man came to hook up the
cable when pictures started flying off of the wall and bedroom doors started
to slam. My father yelled for the ghosts to get out and the cable man got
up and left without charging us for his work. My best friend was changing
in my bedroom and heard laughing, but she and I were the only people in
the house. I was not the person laughing. I have a box full of hair stuff,
I left the room and the next thing I knew I heard the box go flying into
the floor. I did not leave it on the edge of the dresser, but someone pushed
it off of my dresser. I have a friend who everytime he came over his truck
would break down or not start. One time he came over and his truck rolled
out of park and ran into our neighbors house. We couldn't figure out why
it did that, he even had the emergency break on. When the police arrived
my grandmother said "maybe it was the ghosts" and the officer said "I am
so sick of hearing about ghosts on this road, don't even mention them!"
That right there tells me that there have been other reportings of ghosts
on my road. My house has been&nbsp; haunted since we moved in, and it probably
will always be this way. Sometimes we do not hear anything for weeks, but
just when we think that they are gone. They come back........</B><B></B>

<P><B>Strange Things</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: detroitbabe77@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>One night my roomate was sleeping in the room across from ours and
he woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. He started screaming.
We ran to his room and he was terrified. He said that a man with a derby
hat was standing next to his bed. When we entered the room the man disappeared.
(We refers to my husband and myself)</B>
<BR><B>For 4 years we had strange encounters!</B>
<BR><B>Something would always open a cubby hole at the top of the 2nd floor
stairs where my sons room was. Everyone who came over was so creaped out
by this so one day a friend of ours nailed it shut. When we woke up the
next morning the cubby door was wide open and the nails were on the floor
as if they never were nailed into anything at all.</B>
<BR><B>That was probably the strangest thing!!</B>
<BR><B>One morning i woke up to use the bathroom. i just glanced up the
stairs and noticed that the cubby door was closed. When i was done in the
bathroom i went and checked on our new daughter. I left my room to wake
my son up for school (he fell asleep on the couch because he was afraid
to sleep in his room because of that cubby) When i walked past the steps
to get to the living room i looked up the steps again and the cubby door
was wide open again.</B>
<BR><B>Another time i went to bed and im the type of person who makes sure
the house is cleaned up and in order before i go to bed. Everything was
nice and neat when i went to bed and the coffee pot was ready to go for
the morning. I woke up the next morning and every cubbard door in my kitchen
was open and the coffee pot was already started like it had just been turned
on. Now im always the first one up in my house so i checked to see if anyone
was up. Just as i figured everyone was sleeping soundly. I woke my husband
up to go to work and asked him about it. He said had no clue!</B>
<BR><B>Weve moved from that house and almost been in our new house for
a year. We hear strange thing at night like someone stomping around through
the first floor of the house. Then one night i was up late and the timer
on my bedroom television had turned it off so i was trying to fall asleep
when i heard some whispering from under my bed. so i woke my husband up
and made him look but nothing was there. I made him listen and we both
heard it like 20 minutes later. Nothing else has happened since but im
sure it will!</B>

<P><B>By: tpalavra@sbcglobal.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; My name tommy and on 2/29/04 ( my birthday) i saw a whole
bunch of supernatural beings.&nbsp; it started when i was with my cousins
in the kitchen and something e=was caught in the corner of my eye. it saw
me and iguess didn't wan't to be seen so it literally fled down the stairs.&nbsp;
i said "hey did u guys hear and see that ghost by the stairs". they replied
"no". i said that it must be the ghost that always pops up and so i paid
not a big deal about it.&nbsp; then another time&nbsp; i was filming my
room with the vidio cam. And then i saw a white figure just looking at
me.&nbsp; The wierd thing about it was that it dissapeared into my dresser.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
those are only some of my many, many , many encounters with ghosts in my
house, but i will tell you people some more stories and some about my house.&nbsp;
i hope that you will read this message and post them on your web page.</B>

<P><B>Red</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: miss_pimp737@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>we used to live in a house a couple blocks down from the hutchinsom
public library.&nbsp; One time when i walked up into my brother and I's
room he was talking to some one and he had my barbies and his GI Joes out
playing I thought that I saw one oof my barbies moving (standing up and
walking like little kids make them)&nbsp; but when i said "Bubba who are
you talking to?" he said the little girl, and pointed to where the movement
was, but the movement had stopped.&nbsp; He also told me later on that
there was a man named Red in another house that we had lived in a couple
years later. One morning i woke up and he was eating oatmeal and i asked
him "Is mom up?" "no "he said&nbsp; " Then where did you get the oatmeal"I
replied. "Red" he said like i already knew who red was Who's Red i asked&nbsp;&nbsp;
"He's the man who lived here before he died"&nbsp; he said "Well where
is he" i asked</B>
<BR><B>"He went to visit hiswife he'll be back later"he replied "How do
you know that?" i said&nbsp; then my brother said "Red told me "&nbsp;
So there is no doubt that I belive in ghosts.</B>

<P><B>Poltergeist</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:Michelle.Ardire@mortgagefamily.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This story is tied to the one I already sent in regarding the poltergeists.</B>
<BR><B>I was about 5 or 6 years old and we were living in our old house.
I loved</B>
<BR><B>the movie Superman, and always thought it would be cool to actually
fly.</B>
<BR><B>Well, my sister and I always used to jump from the top of the stairs
and</B>
<BR><B>slide down on a mattress.&nbsp; Well one night I had to get up to
use the</B>
<BR><B>bathroom, and I figured I pretend to fly. So I jumped. The weird
thing is,</B>
<BR><B>instead of falling down the stairs I actually floated down.&nbsp;
I thought I was</B>
<BR><B>dreaming until about 2 nights ago when I finally had the feeling
that I was</B>
<BR><B>carried down the stairs that night. Every night for the past few
weeks I've</B>
<BR><B>been asking the ghosts or poltergeists who they were and why they
are</B>
<BR><B>following my family and I. I've never gotten a response. I asked
why I felt</B>
<BR><B>like I knew them, then this memory popped into my head. Now I know
that I</B>
<BR><B>was carried down the stairs Superman style by one of the poltergeists.
Now</B>
<BR><B>my 4 year old daughter is seeing the very same poltergeists in the
house.</B>
<BR><B>She describes one as being very tall with red eyes and being funny.&nbsp;
I have</B>
<BR><B>reason to believe that this is the same spirit from when I was little.
Why</B>
<BR><B>they are here I'm not sure if I'll ever find out. I'm a practicing
witch, so</B>
<BR><B>I'm extremely sensitive to the spirit realm, mainly empathetically.&nbsp;
I can</B>
<BR><B>sense emotions. This weekend I've been getting the feeling of severe</B>
<BR><B>nervousness, but not in the extreme I feel for myself. I'm mostly
nervous</B>
<BR><B>because of the increase in spirit activity in the house.&nbsp; But
it's as if I'm</B>
<BR><B>feeling someone else's emotions on top of my own.&nbsp; I don't
sense anything</B>
<BR><B>malignant, how ever I get the feeling that the poltergeists will
attack if</B>
<BR><B>they perceive to be threatened.</B>

<BR><B>Little Boy and Others</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: twharris@adelaide.on.net</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Well I have a few, But I think I will tell you this one. we no longer
live there.. About 13 years ago when our Son was four, my Hubby and I had
an argument, late one night, so I slept in the spare room, I left the side
lamp on as I didn't like this room.. I was facing the wall and was just
about a sleep when I felt the Quilt Ruffle, so I opened up my eye's expecting
my hubby to be lying next to me, but when I opened my eyes it was a young
boy with blonde hair, at first I thought it was our Son, I realized it
wasn't and I sat up and screamed, this scaring the young boy, he jumped
up and run across the bed and at the same time the wall opened up and it
was like a grey stone wall and when he ran through, it became our wall..
The little boy would visit me quite a lot after this when ever I was sad
or up set, one time I just got out of the shower I was in my room and was
looking for some clothes to put on, and I said yes Luke, then I looked
and it was the little boy... He looked up at me and smiled and faded away,
he use to play with my son's toys at night, but he never was nasty, one
day I looked at this child and I thanked him for being there for comforting
me, and then asked him kindly to leave explaining to him that Luke can
comfort me, and I never saw him again..</B>
<BR><B>One More...LOL ok about 8 years ago, I lived in this housing trust
house near the Para Para Mansion which is Haunted I would hear horrible
noises all the time Girls giggling men yelling, lady's screaming..this
one time I was lying on my back in bed and I heard a Pig squealing, I sat
up and thought what the!!!!!and then this Bore came running in my room,
jumped on me, pinning me down, it was squealing in my face, my heart was
in my throat, and I was frozen in fear, but I looked at it and said you
don't scare me go away...and then it was gone..</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Haunted Home</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: TamiBoer1508@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was about 5 years old, we were building a new house, and we
rented a house in Comstock, MI.&nbsp; We rented it for a cheap price.&nbsp;
Little did we know the house was haunted.&nbsp; My mom was home with my
2 year old brother alone all of the time.&nbsp; My dad wasn't there alot,
during the day he was at the site of our new house.&nbsp; When we moved
out, our landlord told us that the rented house is haunted.&nbsp; They
told us that one time Mrs. Smith* went down to do laundry and found a horrifying
site:&nbsp; her deceaced grandmother was folding laundry and then disapeared
leaving Mrs. Smith horrified.&nbsp; The clothes had just came out of the
dryer and was supposed to be warm, but this load was freezing cold!</B>
<BR><B>Another incodent was: The TVS, radios, alarm clocks, phones, ect...,
would be activated at various times, and when ever they came home, the
dryer would be runnung.&nbsp; They had 2 dogs that barked all of the time,
and I think I know why..., they senced the grandmothers presence.</B>
<BR><B>The wierd thing is..., when we lived there, nothing to out of the
ordinary ever happened in the 4 months we lived there.&nbsp; We think it
is because we are such strong Christians and we would pray out loud, and
we think that is why they left us alone.</B>
<BR><B>hat is my story.</B>

<P><B>Haunted Cabin</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: DoubleTroubleee@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I had the pleasure of living for a few months in the cabin&nbsp;&nbsp;
with my sister.&nbsp; My understanding is that it was used during the Civil
War in the underground railroad.&nbsp; Part of the attic has been left
in orginal form where the former slaves stayed.&nbsp; While staying there
many unexplained noises were heard.&nbsp; One night I heard what sounded
like stomping and moving furniture upstairs.&nbsp; I was in the downstairs
bedroom, my sister was upstairs.&nbsp; I thought she was having a fit of
some sort but I remained in bed.&nbsp; The noises continued and I heard
her running across the floor and sliding down the stairs and she threw
my door open...she told me "he was stomping on the floor above her bed".&nbsp;
The noises continued and I got up and met her in the hall when we heard
something hit the tin roof of the porch ...I told her to get me a flashlight
and she opted to stay in.&nbsp; I went out and looked.&nbsp; Nothing was
out of place.&nbsp; She slept on the couch the rest of the night.</B>
<BR><B>One day when I was alone in the upstairs bedroom&nbsp; I was bent
over reaching into the bottom drawer of the dresser when a cool breeze
went across my ear and I heard a moan from a male presence.&nbsp; I stood
up and told him we had to share the house so he would have to be good.&nbsp;
He didn't bother me further that day.</B>
<BR><B>I was in Charleston working and called my sister at home to see
if I needed to get anything before coming home.&nbsp; I could hear pots
and pans banging in the kitchen.&nbsp; The phone was two rroms from the
kitchen.&nbsp; My sister laughed and said&nbsp; "we must have woman now
or someone is hungry".&nbsp; She was home alone at the time.</B>
<BR><B>It seemed he acted up more after we had had any male visitors in
the house.&nbsp; We figured he thought he was protecting us.</B>
<BR><B>Men who have worked on the house have told tales of tools shaking,
a blood stain on the steps that has to be painted dark brown.</B>
<BR><B>I enjoyed my time there and would live there again if possible.&nbsp;
People would stop on the one lane road in front of the house and just look
at it.&nbsp; We never had any trick or treators.</B>
<BR><B>Once I had to have my car towed and when trying to give directions
to the house to the tow driver, I had to finally ask him if he knew the
haunted cabin on poole road.&nbsp; He did.&nbsp; He drove right to the
house.</B>
<BR><B>There are other experiences we had there and I am sure there are
others who can tell you about it.&nbsp; Its a great place to live.</B>

<P><B>Angel or Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:sharpeirin01@yahoo.com.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello my name is Sam and I'm a daily visitor to your site. Anyways
I have read so many experiences of so many people that I think it's time
for me to share my personal experience.</B>
<BR><B>I was sitting down at the salon to get my hair done. My hairstylist
(Shelly) had already shampoo my hair and we were talking about what has
been going on in our personal lives. When the bells rang, another customer
was walking in. Shelly and I turned around to see who was coming in and
we (Shelly and I) saw a lady with two children. She was about in her early
30's, a boy at the age of 9 or 10, and a little girl at the age of 7. So
Shelly told her she would be right with then when she was done applying
the color on my hair. It took her about 5 minutes to finish me up and then
she asked the lady who was going to be first. The lady said just her son
because she wasn't going to get anything done. After Shelly asked her that
she also asked about the little girl we both had seen. The lady said that
no one walked in with her but just her son.</B>
<BR><B>We described the little girl to her and her eyes just got very watery.
We told her she was wearing a white dress, white hat and shoes, and looked
like at the age of 7. She told us that we were not the only that see this
little girl with her that her sister also see her. She told us that about
five years ago she had a daughter that was 2. Her little girl needed a
heart transplant and never got one and past away. They buried her in a
white dress, white hat and with white shoes. Just the way Shelly and I
had describe her. At first when she said that I could feel my hairs from
my back just standing up (like when a person gets cold and gets goose bumps)
I felt that. Why because I saw the girl and felt her presence in the salon.
I was scared but then I think the little one is looking after her mother.
The only think that got me scared was why did she look like if she was
7 when she past away when she was only 2. Do people that past away also
continue to grow in the after life?</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Doll</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>When I was little I held a doll, like most little girls, and this
doll meant a lot to me.&nbsp; When I</B>
<BR><B>got older I abbandoned the doll.&nbsp; I moved out of the "Old House"
that I had lived in for years.&nbsp; In my new house things became strange.&nbsp;
I saw "shadows" everywhere.&nbsp; One day I was with my friend and it was
her last day in Iowa (she was moving to hawaii the next day) and she slept
over cause she was like my sister.&nbsp; We had fun and did girl things.&nbsp;
We stayed up well past 5:00 am and my parents usually got up to go to work.&nbsp;
(unfortunately for me i can't remember the days of the week because i have
a short term memory thing)&nbsp; I heard footstep runnin garound upstairs
and I pretended to be asleep cauz my parents would have killed me if they
found me awake.&nbsp; So me and my friend closed our eyes, but the footsteps
proceeded downstairs and I heard me name.&nbsp; I opened my eyesw and I
saw the doll that I had abandoned in my old house i sat up.&nbsp; I reached
for the lights and turned them on where the ghost disapeared.&nbsp; I turned
to my friend and she stared at me with the widest eyes ever and then she
began to cry because she had been so frightened.&nbsp; Later that morning
my friend left and we gave a hug and had an emotional moment, but when
we hugged my friend whispered in my ear, "I don't cry becauseI will miss
you.&nbsp; I cry because I remember that doll of yours and I never liked
it.&nbsp; You did right to leave it there."</B>

<BR><B>That '70s Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dezcrawford@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>There is a nightclub at 2183 Highland Road in Baton Rouge, LA.&nbsp;
It is</B>
<BR><B>currently a "techno" dance club called "Icon," but over the years
it has</B>
<BR><B>been known by many names, under different owners, and has hosted
many</B>
<BR><B>different styles of music.</B>
<BR><B>Back in the 1970s it was called "The Common Ground," where it hosted
live</B>
<BR><B>music and the popular dance tunes of the times.&nbsp; I'm in my
40s, so I</B>
<BR><B>remember the club from those days.</B>
<BR><B>It is a two-story club, with an upper balcony and upstairs bar,
looking down</B>
<BR><B>upon the dance floor.</B>
<BR><B>In the 1970s, it was the scene of a tragedy in which more than 20
people</B>
<BR><B>were killed when the upstairs balcony collapsed due to being overloaded
for</B>
<BR><B>the number of people it was designed to accommodate.&nbsp; The fallen
balcony</B>
<BR><B>crushed many patrons on the first floor.</B>
<BR><B>In addition, a subsequent owner or manager committed suicide in
the bar</B>
<BR><B>office.</B>
<BR><B>A friend of mine bartended there in recent years.&nbsp; The building
is haunted</B>
<BR><B>by strange noises, and occasional apparitions of people in 1970s
attire.</B>
<BR><B>The bar office is often intolerably cold, and people alone in the
office</B>
<BR><B>report a feeling of being watched by someone unseen.</B>
<BR><B>My friend witnessed a young blond man in bellbottom jeans walk across
the</B>
<BR><B>dance floor after closing time, only to disappear as he approached
the wall.</B>
<BR><B>Another tme, he saw a young woman in a red dress behind him in the
mirror in</B>
<BR><B>the men's room.&nbsp; She disappeared when he turned around.&nbsp;
Back in the '70s,</B>
<BR><B>the current men's room was the women's bathroom.&nbsp; Ladies' feet
are often</B>
<BR><B>seen in the men's room toilet stall, but no one is in the stall
when an</B>
<BR><B>impatient person taps on the stall door and says, "How long are
you going to</B>
<BR><B>be in there?"</B>
<BR><B>Other people have heard ghostly voices in the bathrooms, and in
a certain</B>
<BR><B>spot on the dance floor where several people were killed in one
area</B>
<BR><B>(crushed by the falllen balcony), patrons often report being touched
or</B>
<BR><B>brushed against by invisible persons.</B>
<BR><B>There is also a frequent report of a female voice asking, "Where's
Steve?</B>
<BR><B>Where's Steve?"</B>
<BR><B>Glassware is reported to go flying around the bar, and patrons sitting
alone</B>
<BR><B>sometimes report their glass being empty when they have only had
a few sips</B>
<BR><B>of their drink.</B>
<BR><B>Most interestingly, my friend relayed a story from a young bartender,
who</B>
<BR><B>was stocking the beer coolers behind the bar before the club was
open for</B>
<BR><B>business one day.&nbsp; He watched a young man in bell-bottom pants
and a blue</B>
<BR><B>velour shirt silently approach the bar.&nbsp; As the young man,
who looked real,</B>
<BR><B>walked toward the bar, this bartender said, "Hey dude, great '70s
outfit!</B>
<BR><B>Sorry, we're not open yet, and besides, '70s dance night isn't till</B>
<BR><B>Thursday."</B>
<BR><B>The young man silently turned, walked away, and began walking up
an</B>
<BR><B>invisible stairway near the bar.&nbsp; He disappeared into the ceiling.</B>
<BR><B>The young bartender quit on the spot.</B>
<BR><B>I had the opportunity to interview the young bartender.&nbsp; He
was only 23, had</B>
<BR><B>only been working at the bar for a few weeks, and had moved to this
city</B>
<BR><B>when he was 20.&nbsp; I asked him some detailed questions.&nbsp;
Due to his youth and</B>
<BR><B>the fact that he is not from here, he had never heard of the tragic
incident</B>
<BR><B>at the Common Grounds, nor did he know that the bar had been redesigned
in</B>
<BR><B>the '80s, and the spot where the ghost walked up the "invisible
stairs" was</B>
<BR><B>the exact spot where the staircase was located back in the '70s.&nbsp;
Back then,</B>
<BR><B>the staircase was near the bar -- now it is at the far end of the
building.</B>
<BR><B>There are many other hauntings along Highland Road, including another
bar,</B>
<BR><B>Spanish Moon, 1109 Highland Road, which harbors the ghost of a young
man in</B>
<BR><B>1950s attire.&nbsp; He likes to turn on the beer taps, make noise,
and throw</B>
<BR><B>small objects such as ashtrays around.&nbsp; People who have seen
him report a</B>
<BR><B>young, dark-haired man with a duck-tail haircut, in khaki pants
and a white,</B>
<BR><B>sleeveless undershirt.</B>

<BR><B>Experiences I have had...</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: photolady75@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ok, well, where do I begin?&nbsp; I have been psychically sensitive
my entire</B>
<BR><B>life, from being able to predict things that will happen, to being
able to</B>
<BR><B>communicate with "the other side".&nbsp; I am certainly no Sylvia
Browne or John</B>
<BR><B>Edward, but I do have my own abilities, however trivial they may
seem in</B>
<BR><B>comparison to either of the forementioned.&nbsp; I have had my own
experiences</B>
<BR><B>with both ghosts and spirits, which, by the way, are two TOTALLY
different</B>
<BR><B>things, and I have also had experiences with something that I am
not sure is</B>
<BR><B>either a spirit or a ghost.&nbsp; I have been seeing them for the
past thirteen</B>
<BR><B>years.&nbsp; I do not know what to call them, and I have been searching
in vain</B>
<BR><B>for people that may have seen what I have.&nbsp; I call them shadow
creatures, I</B>
<BR><B>have nothing better to call them.&nbsp; They appear to be shadows.&nbsp;
They come to</B>
<BR><B>me at night, when it is dark.&nbsp; I can sense them long before
I even see that</B>
<BR><B>they are in the room with me.&nbsp; The first time I saw them was
terrible.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>was laying in my bed one night, unable to sleep when i suddenly
got the</B>
<BR><B>feeling that I wasn't alone.&nbsp; I looked around my room and I
noticed a shadow</B>
<BR><B>in the far corner.&nbsp; I watched it for a moment, trying to figure
out what was</B>
<BR><B>throwing the shadow when it suddenly moved.&nbsp; I froze in terror.&nbsp;
The thing</B>
<BR><B>moved across the floor and came to sit at the foot of my bed.&nbsp;
In my terror,</B>
<BR><B>I lost my voice and was unable to scream.&nbsp; The thing sat at
the foot of my</B>
<BR><B>bed staring at me.&nbsp; Where there should have been eyes, there
was nothing at</B>
<BR><B>all.&nbsp; I could not see through the creature itself, but I could
see the back</B>
<BR><B>wall through where it's eyes should have been.&nbsp; It had either
very pointy</B>
<BR><B>ears, or horns, and there was no discernable shape to the thing.&nbsp;
I felt</B>
<BR><B>more in the room and as I looked around, I saw three or four more
kind of</B>
<BR><B>melt through the wall and appear inside my room. In my terror, I
passed out.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I awoke the next morning to an empty room, just me, all by
myself.&nbsp; That</B>
<BR><B>was not the last visit from these things.&nbsp; Over the years they
have visited</B>
<BR><B>many times.&nbsp; Sometimes briefly, sometimes for extended periods
of time.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>told a family member who is highly psychic about them and he told
me they</B>
<BR><B>are good spirits and that they come from the Earth.&nbsp; He told
me about his</B>
<BR><B>own experience with them and how one lifted his grandson right from
his bed</B>
<BR><B>while the child slept.&nbsp; He told me to talk to them and ask
them what it was</B>
<BR><B>they wanted from me.&nbsp; He told me not to fear them.&nbsp; I
tried his method, but</B>
<BR><B>I doubted what he told me.&nbsp; I tend to go with my gut feeling
on things of</B>
<BR><B>this nature and my gut told me these things were absolutely NOT
good</B>
<BR><B>spirits.&nbsp; The only time I was able to overcome my fear was
in early 2000.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>woke in the middle of the night to use the bathroom.&nbsp; I left
my sleeping</B>
<BR><B>infant daughter in my bed.&nbsp; When I returned to my room, I instantly
knew I</B>
<BR><B>was not alone.&nbsp; I felt them everywhere.&nbsp; Terror took over
and I froze.&nbsp; Then</B>
<BR><B>I saw one next to my bed.&nbsp; It was leaning over my baby and
appeared to be</B>
<BR><B>reaching out to touch her.&nbsp; I felt a surge of anger and I flung
myself onto</B>
<BR><B>the bed and laid over my daughter.&nbsp; I hissed at the creature
to get away</B>
<BR><B>from my baby.&nbsp; It kind of cocked it's head and looked at me
before it</B>
<BR><B>finally withdrew it's hand/claw and eventually faded from the room</B>
<BR><B>altogether.&nbsp; About a year after that my older daughter awoke
one night</B>
<BR><B>screaming in terror.&nbsp; When I went to see what was wrong she
said there was a</B>
<BR><B>shadow watching her and it was on the wall next to her bed.&nbsp;
Instinct told</B>
<BR><B>me it was one of "them".&nbsp; Over the years I have learned that
they do not</B>
<BR><B>like light.&nbsp; They seem to run from it, but that does not mean
they go away</B>
<BR><B>entirely.&nbsp; Sometimes they linger, like in a theatre, they wait
off stage for</B>
<BR><B>their cue, and their cue is for the room to go dark again.&nbsp;
I have no idea</B>
<BR><B>what these things are or why they come to me, or what they want
from me.&nbsp; It</B>
<BR><B>worries me since my younger daughter is psychically sensitive as
well.&nbsp; She</B>
<BR><B>clearly sees and talks to the dead.&nbsp; Recently we went to Bachelor's
Grove</B>
<BR><B>cemetery and after visiting there she told me about a couple she
had seen</B>
<BR><B>there.&nbsp; They had told her how they died, when they had died,
and that they</B>
<BR><B>had been brother and sister.&nbsp; She claimed they died in the
'20's.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>daughter is only 4 years old.&nbsp; She does not even know there
was a 1920's.</B>
<BR><B>She has spoken to other ghosts and spirits as well.&nbsp; She even
had her spirit</B>
<BR><B>guide appearing in pictures with her for awhile, until I kindly
asked him to</B>
<BR><B>stop.&nbsp; He did.&nbsp; I could send some of these picture to
you, but I don't have</B>
<BR><B>a scanner here at my house.&nbsp; I would have to go use a relatives.&nbsp;
But if you</B>
<BR><B>are interested, I can scan a few and send them. You want to know
about</B>
<BR><B>ghosts and spirits?&nbsp; I can tell you tons.&nbsp; I hope you

<BR><B>I used to live in Millbrook and have been exploring there. In the
auditorium, there is a short rope hanging from a rafter. Someone told me
that a girl who attended there had a boyfriend who was killed in a ski
accident, and she was so upset that she hung herself there. Also while
in one of the dorm rooms I heard the footsteps of someone wearing high
heels (that distinct clip clop sound) walking towards the room. Since it's
illegal to be in there, we ran out of the room and out of the building.
The whole time we heard the high heels behind us, which sounded like they
were running after us when we started running.</B>

<P><B>Here's one in Rhinebeck</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Shannon12801@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My boyfriend's parents' house in Rhinebeck used to be a schoolhouse
in the 16 0r 1700's-- I'm not sure which. Thomas Wolfe went there when
he was a child. It's on East Market Street. We often see a little boy looking
out of a second floor window at us or hear footsteps.</B>
<BR><B>Also, at my house in Hyde Park, which was built in 1769, I have
seen a man dressed in 1700's clothing (a brown burlap-looking shirt, boots
with brass buckles, and dark green knickers with dirt on them) coming down
the stairs. He walks bowlegged, like a person who rides horses alot. Also,
I've seen the face of a person with ice blue eyes in my hallway, and have
heard several strange voices. We also have a problem with the electricity
in my house--it flickers a LOT, and our house is a dead zone for cell phones,
which is strange, because as soon as you set foot off my property, it works
at full power again.</B>
<BR><B>Also on my property, there used to be a Dominican Boys Camp in the
70's, which for some reason was abruptly deserted. There are still clothes
and other personal effects in many of the cabins, and what looks like blood
ALL OVER one of the bathrooms. Our landlord says he doesn't know what happened,
and I haven't been to the historian yet, but I thought you might find it
interesting. We have seen&nbsp; and heard many strange things in the buildings
back there.</B>

<P><B>By: Wantednall50@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>As my friend and I were walking, we saw a young girl in the middle
of the road. She walked into a building that has been recently torn down.
She walked into what seemed to be a door, and then she walked up an invisible
flight of stairs. When she got to the top of the "stairs", she rolled back
down and all that I can remember is her screams. I walked to that spot
and suddenly got very cold as there was a message that said HELP ME written
in the dirt. I was so scared. I never go to that place again. I won't ever
forget that time.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pse@teipat.gr</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, I'm from Greece and sorry for my bad English..:)</B>
<BR><B>When I was younger, about 16 years old I had a strange experience.....We
lived with my family in our sommer house and from my bed I could look out
my door to the livingroom. One night, while I was sleeping, I feld&nbsp;
like I had to wake up....so I opened my eyes and as it was dark, I saw
in the livingroom a little boy dressed in white clothes just standing there
looking at me .....I thought it was my imagination and I turned on the
light. Of course it vanished......I waited for 5 minutes thinking that
all this was my imagination,&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned off the light....and
then....the little boy was standing at my bedroom door. I screamed, turned
on the light and ran to my brothers bedroom asking him if I could sleep
with him.&nbsp; I heard his footsteps for a while in the livingroom and
then it was quiet.</B>
<BR><B>I can't explain this....I didn't regognized the little boy and the
house was built new.</B>
<BR><B>I had and other experiences but with diseased family members and
friends.&nbsp; But maybe it was only my imagination....</B>

<P><B>Charlie was my ghost!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: charlene@sourcee.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My house was haunted by a old man whose name was Charlie. We found
this</B>
<BR><B>out because one day when my parents were building our fireplace
and my uncle went in to</B>
<BR><B>get something to drink and he seen an old man in farmer jeans just
standing there in front of</B>
<BR><B>the fire place with his arms crossed over his chest just shaking
his head no... My uncle told us</B>
<BR><B>exactly what he looked like and the people next door from us had
a picture of him. They told us that</B>
<BR><B>he had died in a fire.</B>
<BR><B>We had the noise at night, tv and radio turning off and on even
one day</B>
<BR><B>the saw down in the cellar turned on by itself when we were sitting
have</B>
<BR><B>supper together. My sister said she heard something in the cellar
and my</B>
<BR><B>dad didn't believer her at first then he want down there and it
was on.</B>
<BR><B>The saw you have to pull the lever up to turn it on so it was really
weird.</B>
<BR><B>Charlie didn't like my dad who's name is also Charlie. I think it
was because my dad was mentally abusive</B>
<BR><B>to my mother and sometimes to us. He would hide his tools on him
all the time and he</B>
<BR><B>would go out and buy more tools just to have the old ones show again.
One time my sister and</B>
<BR><B>I heard the dogs barking so we looked outside and we seen the latch
go up the gate open</B>
<BR><B>and then close and the latch went back down with no one there! Another
time I was going</B>
<BR><B>down the hallway to go to the bathroom and our dog wanted to get
out of my sisters room</B>
<BR><B>because it was scratching at the door. I asked my sister if she
wanted me to let her</B>
<BR><B>out and she said no because she was scared and wanted her in there.
Well she had a sliding</B>
<BR><B>door and right before my eyes the door slid open and the dog walked
right on out! She yelled</B>
<BR><B>at me until I told her I didn't do it! Then she made me stay with
her</B>
<BR><B>because she was even more scared. Another time she came running
into my</B>
<BR><B>room because you know the charms if you light the candles under
them&nbsp; it</B>
<BR><B>makes them turn, well she was in the living room and it started
turning</B>
<BR><B>on it's own and it went faster and faster and faster she said it
was</B>
<BR><B>turning so fast that she thought they would just fly off! Another
time</B>
<BR><B>the dogs were barking and this was in the winter with new snow that
had</B>
<BR><B>fallen. My dad went out to see if there were any foot prints in
the snow</B>
<BR><B>because the dogs were just going crazy and all</B>
<BR><B>he found was one set of prints facing looking into our window! My
dad</B>
<BR><B>when he was in Germany he was talking to this lady and he said he
was</B>
<BR><B>from Pepperell and</B>
<BR><B>she said she knows Pepperell really good and he told her our address
and</B>
<BR><B>she said you bought</B>
<BR><B>that place? That place is haunted!!! My dad was like you don't have
to</B>
<BR><B>tell me that! She said</B>
<BR><B>when it was a junk car lot that the cars would be moved around and
they</B>
<BR><B>would be in different places in the yard and no one had moved them
(that</B>
<BR><B>was alive anyway)! The people next door had asked my mother what
my</B>
<BR><B>father was doing up in the barn at night and she's like nothing
why and</B>
<BR><B>they said they seen lights on and someone up there walking around!!!
I</B>
<BR><B>wasn't afraid of him because when I was little and having nightmares
so</B>
<BR><B>I went in my mom and dads bedroom with my pillow and blanket and
laid on</B>
<BR><B>the floor because I didn't want to wake them up. I was still scared</B>
<BR><B>because of the nightmares that I had and then I feel a hand on my
back</B>
<BR><B>at first I was afraid because there was no one there but then I
feel</B>
<BR><B>safe as if I knew he was trying to make me feel better and then
I feel</B>
<BR><B>asleep. Our ghost Charlie liked to scare my sister though for some</B>
<BR><B>reason and really didn't like my dad! One time he was sleeping and
he</B>
<BR><B>said he felt something on top on him and then it started to strangle</B>
<BR><B>him! My dad couldn't get up and he started to cry because he was
so</B>
<BR><B>scared. He held onto his cross that he was wearing and started praying</B>
<BR><B>and then it went away. My mother and father got divorced and he
came</B>
<BR><B>down to visit us and was going sleep on the couch but didn't want
to</B>
<BR><B>stay out there alone. He said the ghost doesn't like me can one
of you</B>
<BR><B>sleep out here on the other couch with me? I said you big baby I'll
sleep out there</B>
<BR><B>with you. Well sometime late in the night or early morning (not
sure) we woke up to something</B>
<BR><B>banging on our door. It was so loud that I thought our door would
be broken down! I said you</B>
<BR><B>going get that dad, he said hell no, you get it. Of course we both
didn't go to the door.</B>
<BR><B>When it finally stopped we both looked out and didn't see anyone
leave! One time I was home by</B>
<BR><B>myself and had the radio blasting and he shut if off on me so I
told him, you don't</B>
<BR><B>live here anymore this is my house please don't turn the radio off!
He</B>
<BR><B>would leave it alone then. My mother had someone pray over our house
so Charlie finally has gone into the light and our >ouse has no more haunting.
I almost kind of miss him. We still have Charlies picture in his farmer
jeans!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My New Found Friend</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>A couple of days ago, I stumbled on this wonderful website while
sitting on hold at work...&nbsp; I was really bored.&nbsp; Anyways, after
reading so many fabulous encouters(I spend a lot of time on hold at work),
as well as the nasty ones, I feel as though I have something to contribute.&nbsp;
Despite numerous situations that I have undergone through out my life,
this is my favorite.</B>
<BR><B>About 2 years ago, I moved into a small duplex apartment that was
conveniently located about 20 feet from the back fence of a huge, and very
old, cemetery.&nbsp; The girl I was to be roomates with had lived there
for&nbsp; quite a bit as well as the neighbor downstairs.&nbsp; Never did
I hear them speak of anything out of the ordinary but I am inclined to
think they just kept any strange occurrences to themselves.&nbsp; The room
that I had had a window that faced the cemetery.&nbsp; I could barely see
it due to a large number of trees as well as the steep hill that led up
to its back fence.&nbsp; My then boyfriend stayed with me for the first
3 nights I moved in since I didn't feel comfortable staying by myself (the
roomate was out of town).&nbsp; At first I blamed my discomfort and lack
of good sleep on being in a new environment.&nbsp; The first night my boy
wasn't there, I didn't sleep at all.&nbsp; I sat up all night staring out
the window watching shadows by the back fence.&nbsp; The shadows moved
as though they were a beautifully composed melody - soft, graceful and
yet at some points with defiant maneuvers that I had never seen before.&nbsp;
I think it was the first night I saw them that this place began to have
a special meaning for me.</B>
<BR><B>I am convinced that one of those "shadows" came down to the apartment
to play sometimes.&nbsp; Things would go missing, then reappear on the
coffee table in plain site (this was not a big apartment).&nbsp; The instance
that seems most bold to me was my license.&nbsp; I misplaced it the 3rd
week after I had moved in.&nbsp; It was nowhere to be found despite the
fact that I had placed it on my bureau when I got home the night before.&nbsp;
I know I put it there because my money, my ATM card, as well as the receipt
from the grocery store were all still there.&nbsp; I searched that apartment
for 2 months.&nbsp; We tore everything apart... including my car, the roommates
car, the garage, the laundry.... everything.&nbsp; The one night I was
on the phone with my mom who was furious at me for losing it and didn't
like the fact that i was using my passport as my photo ID.&nbsp; When i
got off the phone with her, I lay on my bed staring up at the moon wishing
that my mom and i could get along better and making a promise to myself
to be more careful with my things (stop misplacing them)</B>
<BR><B>The next day, frustrated and tired, I opened the door to my car
and stopped....&nbsp; there, on the drivers seat, was my license and a
gorgeous orange leaf (i like pretty leaves almost more than i like flowers).&nbsp;
My car had been locked, in the garage (locked), no windows open, and I
had the only set of keys.&nbsp; I went upstairs to ask my roommate if she
had found my license and somehow gotten it into my car when I realized
that yet again, she was out of town.&nbsp; I sat on the couch for a few
moments staring into space trying to rationalize, then headed into my room
to grab my sunglasses.&nbsp; This is a room I had left no more than 20
minutes earlier, only to find a picture, 2 rings, and another orange leaf
sitting on my bureau.&nbsp; I had not been able to find this picture or
the rings while unpacking and believed I had left them at my parents house....
I smiled, looked out of my w dow to a beautiful fall day, and said thank
you to whomever had made my day.</B>

<BR><B>Evil Ex</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:krisnieb@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I'm not the best story teller, but I have quite a few ghostly experiences.
I've been sensitive to spirits since a young age (probably 10 or so). The
experience that I want to tell you about today is the scariest I've had
so far in my life. It is always un-nerving to sense a spirit around, but
this scared me. At the age of 24 I married and evil evil person. He had
evil lurking from every corner and it followed him around. The spirits
especially loved when we would get into a fight. When we would fight the
room temperature would drop to freezing cold and the heater would be on.
I could also see dark shadows all around the room. They really liked to
stay in the closet and watch us. The closet door was always open, and it
was a direct shot onto the bed. One evening as we were sleeping my ex-husband
woke up to the sheet all around his body, and I was still fully covered
by the sheets. We were in a new apartment and you could hear the noise
of the people above and below us. We could always hear the sound of cupboards
opening and closing. Sometimes it would be soft and sometimes it would
be loud. I just chalked it up to being other apartment noise until one
night my ex yelled out "knock it off". The noise stopped and it didn't
happen the rest of the night. I'm going to go off on a tangent so I can
go on with my story.... When I was between the ages of 16-21 I played on
owjia boards and I happened to pick up a female spirit that I call 18.
She is a good spirit and protects me. She is my guarding angel. So back
to me and my ex. He told me one night that he was going to work on his
car. I started to do chores around the apartment. I was cleaning the bathrooms
and all of a sudden the whole apartment went ice cold. I started to see
two spirits out of the corner of my eye. One was male and he was laughing
at me and mocking me. The other was a girl, once I got a better glimpse
of her I realized it was 18. She was there protecting me from the male
spirit. I found out later that my ex cheated on me that night.</B>

<P><B>East Dundee</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mulville@sbcglobal.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I lived in this home for 2 &frac12; years.&nbsp; In East Dundee,
on Edwards Avenue stands the original Lakewood Estate hunting lodge built
by the architect McIntosh.&nbsp; Originally Lakewood Estates was going
to be an area for recreational hunting, but these ideas never came to fruition,
as the depression came and people had less money to spend on frivolities.&nbsp;
Later the lodge was renovated into a home.&nbsp; From the year 1919 when
it was built, until 2004 it has had a total of 20 different owners live
in it.&nbsp; That’s a lot of owners, considering that back years ago people
did not get transferred around like they do today. We have seen or experienced
the things mentioned.&nbsp; We’ve seen shadows move about; lights turn
on by themselves, heard knocking on windows in the early morning hours,
footsteps in the attic above the master bedroom, heard loud clanking noises
in the great room, like fireplaces utensils being knocked over and clanging
on the stone floor (only to run into the room and find nothing amiss).&nbsp;
Small items are sometimes moved around, such as watches on night stands
or bathroom toiletries are changed from one side of the room to the other
in the morning when one wakes up. Footsteps are heard coming down the stairs
into the great room around 11pm in the evening.&nbsp; After only living
in the home a few nights, I dreamt about a young girl, dressed in a white
billowy night dress, who falls over a balcony to her death.&nbsp; It is
rumored that the house is haunted by a young child.&nbsp; The sound of
a child crying has been heard coming from the bedroom at the top of the
landing on the second floor.&nbsp; Another owner heard the piano playing
a familiar tune that her daughter was trying to master for a recital, but
her daughter was not home at the time, she was at school.&nbsp; The home’s
property is also said to be located on an old stage coach stop.&nbsp; If
you wander into the woods behind the home you can still make out the ruts
in the ground from the stage coach line.&nbsp; The home is very unique
with 5 fireplaces and has had many additions added to the original structure.&nbsp;
It’s a very unique home, yet a bit creepy too.&nbsp; In the main large
fireplace there is a small brass figure of a devil hanging on the chain
that is connected to the damper.&nbsp; It’s called a “devil damper”, yet
when I moved from that home, I chose to NOT take that item with me, I think
there is something either very sad or evil in that home.</B>
<BR><B>The best story was when my husband came home from work one day and
pulled into the garage with his car, he came into the home and heard crying
coming from upstairs.&nbsp; He said he immediately became furious at me
because he had noticed that my car was not in the garage and he assumed
I had left our daughter up in her bedroom napping while I left the house
to run errands&nbsp; (which I would NEVER do), but when you hear what sounds
exactly like your child crying and you don’t see your wife at home, what
else is there to think.&nbsp; He walked through the house and up the stairs
to her room (hearing the crying all the way) and as he opened the door
to her room and looked toward her crib the room went silent.&nbsp; He said
the hairs on the back of his neck just stood up and he went out of the
room shouting in the to home, “Leave, get out!”&nbsp; “You’re dead!”&nbsp;
Later when I got home he never mentioned it to me, in fact he didn’t tell
me about that incident until two days after we sold the home (a year later).&nbsp;
He said that he was afraid that if he told me, I would have taken the baby
and left to go live at my mothers.&nbsp; And he’s right, but I was relieved
to hear him validate my questions,&nbsp; his experience meant that all
the odd things that I was experiencing and relaying to him were not so
nuts after all.&nbsp; While we were living there he kept making up excuses
for these things I would tell him about and I was beginning to feel like
I was going crazy.</B>
<BR><B>I tried to do some history on the house and its past occupants.&nbsp;
You can get a list of the owners from the Kane county assessors office,
but the historical society said that there was a fire around the 1930’s
and all the newspapers etc. from before that are gone.&nbsp; I’d love to
know more, it was cool living there even though it was strange at the same
time.</B>

<BR><B>This House is Haunted</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: munkeeluver2000@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have a story or two to tell.Well the first one was something that
happened to my mother when she was around 14-15 yrs. old when she lived
in Ohio. It too has something to do with a rocking chair like one of the
other stories.Well here it is as she told me.</B>
<BR><B>When my mother was younger(14-15 yrs old) her Aunt(my Grandmothers
oldest sister..my Grandma is the youngest and her sister was the oldest
of 7 children)..would come over on the weekends and would always sit in
this rocking chair in the family room and just sit there and talk and rock
in the chair.My mother and my aunt(her younger sister) would clean the
house on the weekends and when she go to sweep and mop the floor in the
family room she would tell her aunt to lift her feet so she can sweep and
mop underneath.</B>
<BR><B>Well this is where the experience happens.My mothers aunt died and
my grandparents went to the funeral and my mother and aunt stayed at home
to clean it because the family and friends were going to go there after.
Well when my mother was sweeping and mopping the the family room she was
working her way over to the rocking chair..which was rocking..she thought
nothing of it because her aunt was always in it when she was cleaning and
was used to it.well when she got to the point where she told her aunt to
lift her feet..she asked her to lift her feet and the chair went back like
someone was sitting in it and lifted there feet..well this is when she
relized there was no one in the chair and ran to her sister and was freaked
out..they both ended up sitting outside until my grandparents got home..I
guess my great aunt was still there rocking away..</B>
<BR><B>This next story happened to me..one of my best friends named Dean
moved down to Florida when we were in 4th grade.(I am now 24 yrs. old.)And
all through growing up he would say he would here strange noises in his
house and his stereo would go on in the middle of the night and also the
TV.He also said one time he woke up and a glowing ball of light was hovering
above his head and he just layed there frozen then after a couple of seconds
it darted off towards the window and dissapeared..he always thought it
was aliens or something..but me and are other friends would always laugh
at him and tell him yeah right.</B>
<BR><B>Now here's my story in all that..it's not that scary like the other
stories on here but it freaked us out.About a year ago before he moved
back to Cleveland his father, mother and sister were in Cleveland looking
for houses and he was home alone for about a week or two.Dean,another friend
named George and myself were sitting in his living room watching TV..the
only light was from the TV as it was nighttime..so he starts on one of
his stories again about how the radio in his mothers room went on in the
middle of the night and he went in there to shut it off and checked the
alarm on it and it was not on nor was it set for the time it went on.Then
he said when he went back into his room his computer was on..and it wasn't
berfore.So he told us this and me and George are like wow that's weird..in
my head I'm like here we go again..well anyway after about 5 seconds of

<P><B>St. Margarets</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, I graduated from St. Margarets School, in Lowell, in 2001. And
I have my own little haunting story.</B>
<BR><B>I had stayed after school after one of the events, , my mother is
a helper at the school, (it was about 9:00 )and I had been recruited to
go to the top floor and make sure all the lights were turned off. So, I
went upstairs from the side where the boys bathroom is and went into each
of the classrooms in turn and shut off all the lights. So, I made it to
the other side where the girls bathroom is and began walking down the stairs.
I got to the landing in between the top floor and the 1st floor and looked
up towards the hallway I had just came from, because I thought I heard
a noise. So, I yelled 'Hello', thinking it was someone looking for me and
when I looked up I saw a girl I had never seen before leaning far over
the balcony type thing. I ran all the way to where everyone else was, terrified
and I have never seen her since. That happened in about 8th grade, so 2000-2001.</B>

<BR><B>Renovations</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: heycart@1earth.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>When we were renovating our house I walked out to our new kitchen.
I looked in the door and saw (what I thought was a builder). I walked in
to make a sandwhich and started talking to him but he just stared at me
and walked out of the room. I walked out the door and looked round the
corner but he wasen't there. The next day I told the old woman next door
and discribed him she said "Thats my uncle Phillip he died there 30 years
ago."</B>
<BR><B>I think he must just be coming to see how the house was going.</B>

<P><B>Indian Friend</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: aakatrick@comcast.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I have been reading this site for quite some time now. I like reading
all of the different stories that everyone puts in, they are all great.&nbsp;
Well I finally got up enough courage to tell my story.</B>
<BR><B>I lived in a house in Central Jersey for about 10 years. I loved
that house, you would walk in and just feel so comfortable like ya didn't
want to leave.&nbsp; When we first moved in people from the neighborhood
would walk by our house and tell us that a spirit was there but not to
worry because he was very friendly. We thaught it was a bunch of bull.</B>
<BR><B>The night I first had solid proof that the house was in fact haunted,
I was watching T.V. late at night, I always would watch TV real late.&nbsp;
I heard someone come down the staires, walk around the kitchen table twice
into the kitchen and back through the living room and stand at the stairs
that lead into the living room (there were two steps into the living room).&nbsp;
I thaught it was my brother sleepwalking, he did that from time to time,
so I yelled at him to go back to bed (didn't turn around to yell, just
yelled :) ) He didn't move just stood there swaying back and forth staring
at me. ( the entrance way to the living room was behind me I just heard
all of this.) I finally turned around to really yell at my brother but
when I did no one was there, but the foot steps continued down the staires
right in front of me and through the front door. I was alittle freaked
but not scared, I took it as my sign to go to bed.&nbsp; So I did. Th</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;became a ritutal, when "he" thaught it was time for me to
go to bed he would always let me know.</B>
<BR><B>We call him our "Indian Friend" thats because we had a friend come
over, she is clairvoient (sp) she saw him and said that he was an Indian
who was murdered for the land the house now sits on. ( house built in 1840)
He liked it so much he decided to stay.&nbsp; She also said that he like
us being there. it showed.</B>
<BR><B>I was not the only one who new he was around my mom and brother
both have their own stories to tell.&nbsp; He was always full of pranks
and jokes, he would do the usual hide things, move things, disturb you
when you are watching TV. I think he found it funny. But we would just
ask for our things back and he would give them back to us. We would feel
him sit on the couch or at the foot of the bed, sometimes see the indent,
We would say good night or good morning and he would get up.&nbsp; But
he would watch tv for awhile with us.</B>
<BR><B>One story real quick, we had a fire place room in the house, we
never used it execpt to put our christmas tree in,&nbsp; well... every
year we were finished putting the tree up, we would sit down... and down
came the tree, every year.&nbsp; One year we even tied it the wall and
it still fell! we finally started putting the tree in the living room,
it never fell. I think that was his room and he didn't want it in there.
:)</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;He had two rules from me, I didn't want to see him and I didn't
want to hear him (talk) because I told him I didn't want to ever be afraid
of him.&nbsp; And he listened. Now I kinda regret not seeing him. I have
in my dreams though. He was and is truly part of our family, he stayed
behind to pick on the other people who moved in but he still comes and
pays us a vist now and then.&nbsp; I always look foward to his visits.&nbsp;
People who move in there never stay to long, the guy who lives there now
has those guargoils all over the place, I think they are to ward off evil
spirts but it won't work because my Indian Friend is far from evil. I have
alot more to tell but it would take up to much of</B>
<BR><B>our time.&nbsp; I have a few questions to ask, just things that
I can't figure out, yet, if you guys ( David and Tina) wanna e-mail me
back feel free! I'd love to hear from ya.</B>
<BR><B>thanks.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Haunted House on Eside of Des Moines</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: norma_bla@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I lived in a small house on the east side for a few years. It was
about 4 blocks north of the fairgrounds. I was told the owners before me
lost a baby and got divorced therefore selling the house.&nbsp; At night
things would get noisy sometimes.&nbsp; It always sounded like a distant
radio or tv announcer was talking in the furnace area in a running monologue
you could never quite hear. Pizza pans would roll off a counter top for
no apparent reason, a bag of junk in the basement owned by former owners
containing photographs and odds and ends toppled over in a big crash.&nbsp;
The most unnerving incident was when I filled a prescription and had the
pills on my bathroom sink.&nbsp; For some reason I was looking for something
in my desk drawer in the extra bedroom and found one of these pills in
that drawer.&nbsp; The hair on the back of my arms stood up as I realized
no one else had been in the house since I had bought this prescription
and I had no reason to "hide" the pill in there.&nbsp; My first thought
was that a child had done that.&nbsp; The room I was in was probably where
the toddler died and he was sick, I learned for quite a while, so probably
had to take lots of pills.</B>
<BR><B>I had another night in the house when I woke up scared sensing something
in the room with me.&nbsp; I was so scared I was afraid to move.&nbsp;
The room seemed bathed in a blue light and something round and fuzzy flew
up under the covers next to me and gone quickly.&nbsp; It took a long time
before I could move and return to normal.&nbsp; I finally realized whatever
was in the house wanted me to know it was there and meant no harm.</B>
<BR><B>When I moved out the house it seemed to go haywire for the new alcoholic
owners.&nbsp; Apparently the ghost child liked me better since I had made
many improvements to the home. I noticed I had blond hair like the former
mom in pictures I found. In the first few weeks the Realator called me
and said they thought I sold them a lemon.&nbsp; It sounded like the Amnity
Ville Horror.&nbsp; They had water in the basement, the central air broke
and lights quit working.&nbsp; I guess water even poured down the inside
wall of the livingroom.&nbsp; I had never had any of these problems.</B>
