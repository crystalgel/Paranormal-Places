Joplin Spook Light<br>
<br>
By: starsign2m@hotmail.com <br>
<br>
I remember that in 1964, shortly after our baby, Laurie, was born, my
husband took me to see the "Spook Light".&nbsp; It's outside Joplin,
over the state line.&nbsp; We parked on a gravel road and waited about
half an hour......suddenly, floating out of the woods, came the Spook
Light!&nbsp; It floated out , and down the road toward us,&nbsp; like a
ball of lightning, only on a much more erratic course.&nbsp; It got
within a hundred feet of our car, in <br>
the middle of the road, when it suddenly disappeared!&nbsp; Thank Heavens!&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd <br>
heard from my husband's best friend, that if it touched your car, the
paint would blister and peel, just like it did on his car when the
light landed on his hood!&nbsp; My husband had been watching the "Spook
Light" since he was a little boy, and said this was the closest he'd
ever been to it.&nbsp; I've seen ball lightning before, and swamp gas -
this was NOTHING like it.&nbsp; We returned every few weeks, and the
performance was repeated, but it never got any closer before it just
vanished.&nbsp; I can't tell you how long I've waited for someone to
talk about this phenomenon!!<br>

My Old House<br>
<br>
By: sdiehl@aztecasupply.com<br>
<br>
I grew up in an old ranch house that used to be surrounded by farm
land. I can never remember anything strange happening in that house
until I was about 9 years old. One evening I was going down in our
basement to get something (our basement was old and unfinished, cement
floors and walls) when I saw someone at the other side of the room. I
screamed and ran back upstairs and got my mom. She came right away,
thinking there was someone in our house, and when she looked downstairs
there was no one there. She looked everywhere, but no one. She passed
it off as my wild imagination, although I swore to her that I saw
someone.&nbsp; Several years later, more strange things began to
happen. I came home from school one day (I was the only one there), and
I began to hear footsteps in our attic. It was as though they paced the
length of our hallway. It scared me so badly that I had to leave the
house. Again, my mother passed this off as a figment of my imagination.
As the years passed, I would see things out of the corner of my eye.
The shades in my bedroom went up by themselves, and there was one time
where I thought I saw the reflection of a face in my window. My brother
and I eventually switched rooms, and the fan in my new room would turn
itself on (It was not a ceiling fan). When I was home alone often times
the television would just turn itself off. My dog sneakers would sit
and her eyes would just follow something about the room, although I
could never see anything. She often barked at nothing.&nbsp; One night
when I was 18 years old, I was laying in my bed, and there was
scratching on my pillow by my head. I turned to see what it was but
there was nothing. No windows were open, and nothing was hitting the
pillow. A minute later there was the scratching again, sounding closer
to my head. Again I looked, but saw nothing. The third time this
happened I was so frightened I ran into the livingroom at 2 am where my
sister and her boyfriend were watching tv. They thought I was nuts.
Strange things had been happening to me for years, but this was the
worst. A few months later, I was trying to fall asleep, and I felt
something sit down on my bed next to me. I was the only one in the
room, and I was too afraid to open my eyes. Out loud I said, &#8220; You are
scaring me, please leave me alone.&#8221; That was the last strange thing
that happened to me in that house. I later learned that the first
family to live in that house, the woman had brain cancer and died. That
explained everything to me. I thought the ordeal was over. About 1 year
before we moved out of that house after living there for almost 20
years of my life, my mother experienced the scratching on her pillow,
the same as I had. Everytime she would look, there was nothing there.
But for her, it was worse. She didn&#8217;t get up and run, she stayed in
bed. And she said that after the last time she heard the scratching,
she felt a presence. She could not move, nor scream. It lasted a mere
moment, but very much so frightened her. She had not been asleep before
this happened. She was awake when it happened. That was the last thing
that happened in our house. I think that she began to try to
communicate with my mother because I had turned her away. We&#8217;ll never
know for sure.<br>

Fairburn, GA Entry<br>
<br>
<br>
By: stitchedintopieces@yahoo.co.uk<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
My name's Carol and I've been reading through the haunted places
section of the site. I wanted to give you some additional info on
Peter's Woods (Fairburn, Georgia).&nbsp; I grew up around that area
(Newnan, GA, to be exact), and I have some stories to give you about my
experiences with Peter's Woods. You have my permission to post them on
the site if you choose to do so...let me know if you do, please.<br>
I've heard stories of a Satanic cult practicing out in the woods, in an
old shack where meat was stored (the name for it escapes me).&nbsp; My
parents have confirmed this, and my mom says those stories have been
circulating since the 80's, before I was even born.&nbsp; A guy my
friends knew was in one of the practicing cults, so the rumors are true.<br>
I've had some strange experiences on that road, too.&nbsp; A group of
friends and I went to Peter's Woods for some thrills about 5 or so
years ago.&nbsp; We got out of the car (it was still running) and were
standing around waiting for something interesting to happen when we
heard something move in the woods.&nbsp; We all turned toward the noise
and I saw a creature wrap its hands around a tree trunk and lean around
the tree to look at us.&nbsp; It had bright green eyes and its fingers
were long.&nbsp; We all freaked out and jumped in the car.&nbsp; After
we calmed down we compared stories and found that we had seen the same
thing.<br>
We're not the only people to have seen that creature.&nbsp; One person
with us had seen it before, and had drawn it.&nbsp; One of my old
coworkers lived near Peter's Woods and she described it to me one night
while we were sharing spooky stories at work.&nbsp; The creature is
usually 6 1/2 - 7 feet tall, with a lanky frame, and long arms.&nbsp;
It has green eyes, and I found recently from a friend that it's a
demon.&nbsp; From what I remember there's lots of them ambling around
Peter's Woods.&nbsp; This friend had experienced them as well, but her
incidents are totally unrelated.<br>
The person who had drawn this creature also told us of an extremly
haunted two-story house he and his friends used to frequent.&nbsp; He
said you could stand on the porch and hear things moving on the upper
floor, the lower floor, and in the back yard.&nbsp; Most of it he
described as scuttling, or many things moving rapidly over the
floor.&nbsp; He said he looked through the window of the front door
(which apparently looked through to the backdoor) on more than one
occasion and he saw a black shape with bright eyes looking at him
through the back door.<br>
When we found this particular house, there was nothing but the
foundation and the chimney left.&nbsp; It had burned down, but there
wasn't any sort of evidence on the surrounding grounds/trees to show
it.&nbsp; Nothing close to the foundation was scorched or marred in any
way.&nbsp; My friend and I have psychic abilities, and I got the
feeling that the place was so haunted by so many things (bad things)
that it burned down to hide its secrets.&nbsp; I mentioned this to my
friends and my psychic friend felt the same thing.<br>
Many more things have been going on in those woods than a simple Amish
girl and a hidden cemetary.&nbsp; The place is teeming with paranoral
activity, most of it opened up by the Satanic cults.<br>

Everyday Life With A Ghost.<br>
<br>
By: mspatter@comcast.net <br>
<br>
A haunted trailor? <br>
Sounds ridiculous, huh?<br>
Here is my very true story.<br>
I married Reid Carter in 1982.&nbsp; He was a Vietnam veteran, a
marine, and during the time of war he survived many, life threatening
situations.&nbsp; <br>
His job was a machine gunnist.&nbsp; In battle, their life expectancy is under one minute. He lived to come home.<br>
After returning to the U.S. when his term was up he dealt with another life crisis, a motorcycle wreck that almost killed him.<br>
He developed an attitude that 'when his time came, he wasn't going to go'. <br>
He was a welder by trade and he was proud of his aluminum handling
abilities.&nbsp; Apparently, aluminum is a difficult metal to work with
and when being tested for your certifications in it, you must be able
to 'do a row of dimes' where you leave spots of dime shaped aluminum
circles in a neat row.<br>
We bought an old trailor in 1987.&nbsp; It was built in 1968.&nbsp;
Like I said, it was old, but we could afford it and it was ours.&nbsp;
No more horrible landlords.<br>
Moving ahead, we had a daughter in 1989.&nbsp; In November of 1991 he
had a fatal heart attack at home.&nbsp; It was in our old trailor.<br>
Two minutes till midnight on Nov. 18 he rolled out of bed and onto the
floor.&nbsp; I heard the thump and called his name.&nbsp; No response
except for a sharp gasp.&nbsp; I turned on the light and found him
laying there.<br>
I called for paramedics and they got there fast, but they couldn't save him.<br>
By the way, I did try CPR.&nbsp; His eyes were open but unseeing.&nbsp;
He kept gasping for breath on a regular cycle but the air that I gave
him didn't seem to help any and his mouth felt cold and
artificial.&nbsp; Horrifying.&nbsp; <br>
It is an experience that never leaves you.&nbsp; Anyway, as I said, he did die.<br>
Well, if you've ever had paramedics at your home, you know that they
leave a terrible mess.&nbsp; No matter how horrible the circumstance
may be, it is still left up to you to clean up the aftermath of a
death. <br>
After my day of dealing with funeral arrangements and all the terrible
issues that you must contend with when one dies, I could not handle
cleaning up my bedroom that evening. I was fatigued beyond reckoning.<br>
I decided to spend the night with my almost 2 year old (Reid died 2
weeks before her second birthday) on my roll out couch in the living
room.<br>
I wasn't resting well and was mostly awake when two minutes before
midnight my radio alarm clock went off in my bedroom, LOUDLY.&nbsp;
Funny thing is, not only was it on /my/ side of the bedroom and out of
the way of EMS workers but it had never, ever used it in the capacity
of an alarm clock.&nbsp; I did not even know /how/ to set the alarm,
let alone have a /reason/ to set it for that particular time. To me, it
was just a clock.<br>
Had it gone off at exactly 12 o' clock, I'd have thought it was a
strange coincidence, but it went off/ 11:58/ The exact time Reid fell
to the floor.<br>
I was terrified and wanted to ignore it, but it was too loud, even with
closed doors andeventually, I&nbsp; had to go into the room.&nbsp; I
/had/ to shut it off!&nbsp; I was scared that the door might somehow
slam shut behind me and I'd be trapped, me on one side and the baby on
the other. I put a shoe in the opening 'just in case'.<br>
None of the buttons worked, believe me, I tried them all!&nbsp; I had to rip the plug out of the wall to get it to quit!<br>
The door did not try to shut.&nbsp; Although if it had, I doubt it
would have been a real obstacle for me, I would have torn through it
like tissue paper to escape!<br>
Our daughter was still sound asleep, never knowing of my terror.&nbsp; It was many weeks before I slept the night through.<br>
A week after the funeral, my stove, which had an aluminum front made
two holes the exact size and shape of two dimes in the front of
it.&nbsp; I got rid of it.<br>
Then my t.v. started turning itself on to a static channel at odd
times.&nbsp; A ceiling fan suddenly shot sparks out all over the
room.&nbsp; Smoke alarms went off for no reason.&nbsp; Doors that were
closed were found opened.<br>
When my daughter came into my room one night about a year later and
asked me, "Momma, who's the man laying in the hallway?"&nbsp; I asked
her, "Is he still there?"&nbsp; She said, "no he's gone now."&nbsp; I
asked how he left and she said, "He disappeared."&nbsp; I&nbsp;
asked&nbsp; "What did he look like?"&nbsp; She described Reid exactly. <br>
I asked her, "What did he do?"&nbsp; She said, "he just looked at me and was sad, but he smiled.and then he was gone."<br>
Ok, enough. . . . . . . .&nbsp; I had our old trailor moved. <br>
A pretty place in the country.&nbsp; Our private driveway is a tenth of a mile long from the street.<br>
This did not stop things from happening like I'd hoped.&nbsp; In fact they escalated.<br>
I&nbsp; remarried.<br>
I am grateful that by this point in time his tricks were no longer dangerous, no more fire threatening scares.<br>
Now his pranks were more playful than life threatening.&nbsp; Perhaps he'd become accustomed to his 'state of being?'<br>
However, he would not let us forget him.. . . as if I ever
could..&nbsp; We find that his presence is usually at its highest in
the fall, but on some other occasions he puts out the extra effort like
one year on about St. Patricks Day, when he scared the crud out of our
daughter who was at that time about 14 years old.<br>
She came bursting into my bedroom, eyes wild and hair almost on end telling me to "come to her bedroom at once!"<br>
She had a strobe light and it was going at a fast speed.&nbsp; Funny
thing was, . . . it wasn't plugged in and it didn't use batteries.<br>
I took it out of her room.<br>
On occasions, I would see a ball of light tracing along the insides of
my bedroom walls, slowly making its way across one wall and then
wandering down the next.<br>
Before you suggest that it may be caused by passing traffic, I remind
you that my home is in the country and my driveway is a tenth of a mile
long.&nbsp; We don't get street lights.&nbsp; Not during the day or
night.<br>
One of his favorite tricks is to swat my foot or ruff my hair if I try
to take a nap.&nbsp; The swat on the foot feels like someone gently
swiping a bug off&nbsp; and the hair swipe is a tickle of about a hand
size section of hair gently swept by a hand.&nbsp; And NO until this
spring, I did not have indoor pets that could have caused this. <br>
At first these things caused me panic, but eventually I grew accustomed
to them and considered them to be attempts for attention.<br>
I did remarry, but still staying at the same home.<br>
One night a little before midnight, I was in bed, drowsy, but awake,
and I heard knocks.&nbsp; Five slow and evenly space knocks.<br>
It sounded like it came from my closet, which was on the side of the bedroom that Reid had died on.<br>
By the second knock I said, "Come in" and it woke up my husband
Tom.&nbsp; He sat up also.&nbsp; We heard three more slow measured
knocks in our dark room but no one entered and no one answered.<br>
There was a pause in the sound and we looked at each other in the dark.&nbsp; <br>
I was just about to get up and open the door when the knocks happened again.&nbsp; Five slow measured knocks.<br>
This time he said, "Who's there?"&nbsp; We got no answer.<br>
I turned on the lights and looked in the closet.&nbsp; Nothing
there.&nbsp; Tom got a flashlight and went outside and checked
everywhere.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Of course I checked on the
girls.&nbsp; (Did I mention, we now had a baby?)<br>
We had this episode on three different occasions.&nbsp; Once in broad daylight when only Tom was at home.<br>
Tom is not easily spooked but he has had his own reasons to be a
believer even prior to meeting us.&nbsp; His story is probably more
engrossing than mine because his comes from personal experience while
spending a night as a boy in Gelena Illinois at a friends home which
was a farm built on the grounds on an insane assylumn&nbsp; His friends
bedroom was in a separate building made in the mid 1800's. was to hold
the mentally dangerous patients.&nbsp; When Tom saw it as a teenager it
still had fastenings where manacles held 'patients' and claw marks on
the walls.<br>
By the way the name Galena means lead.&nbsp; It is a town that mined
lead and as everyone knows, lead poisoning can and does often have
mental affects on people.&nbsp; Hence the extreme needs of this insane
asylumn.<br>
Anyway, that is a separate story and if you wish, I'll see if he will share his experiences from that hair raising night.<br>
More than thrity five years later he still gets goose bumps relating his evening there.<br>
We now have a new home and are currently tearing down our old
unit.&nbsp; I did invite Reid to reside in our new place but as of yet
he has not made his presence known.<br>
Maybe he's moved on, if so, I wish him the best, even though he tried
to burn me down a time or two and also destroyed two of my cars when I
went to the graveyard to see his grave. <br>
Yeah, twice.&nbsp; Last time it was the cars brain.&nbsp; That was also the last time that I went to his grave. <br>
There's nothing quite as ironic as calling for a tow truck to come and pull you out of a grave yard, especially the second time.<br>
I haven't been to his graveside in over 6 years.&nbsp; Loved him, but I can't keep replacing cars just to see him.<br>
This is a true story and a shortened one at that.&nbsp; Over the years
I've had numerous encounters with Reid and no longer feel frightened
when it happens.&nbsp; Although, like I did say, he has not chosen to
come over to our new unit and I haven't had my foot swiped or my hair
ruffled in almost a year. <br>
I kinda miss it.&nbsp; I hope he moved on and is at peace.<br>
Oh, by way of a P.S., my youngest daughter who is now eight years old
came to me a few months ago in tears.&nbsp; She said, "Reid doesn't
come to see her anymore.&nbsp; What happened?"&nbsp; She misses him.<br>

Haunted House in Baker City, Oregon<br>
<br>
By: shortm@mchsi.com <br>
<br>
<br>
In the late 60s my family wanted to buy a beautiful Victorian house in
Baker City.&nbsp; We had four kids and it was perfect for us.&nbsp; We
did not live in it for very long when we discovered it was
haunted.&nbsp; The first ghosts I heard was when I was alone one
morning after my husband had gone to work and the kids were all in
school.&nbsp; It sounded like someone had thrown all of the furniture
down the stairs.&nbsp; My little dog ran to the door of the entrance
room and the hair on her back was standing straight up and she was
growling.&nbsp; When I opened the door, she put her paws on the bottom
step and snarled as she looked up to the 2nd floor.&nbsp; We
experienced many noises in the night ... Something like parties going
on in the main part of the house or like a ceiling falling... <br>
We moved and found out much later that the neighbors were taking bets
on how long we'd stay.&nbsp; We loved the house, but were very glad to
move.&nbsp; We found that many people had lived there before we did and
many afterwards.&nbsp; <br>

Information on the Hanging Tree in Liverpool, PA<br>
<br>
By: scollins@pa.net <br>
<br>
I visited the Hanging tree several times when I was in my teen
years.&nbsp; Any time that I have every been out there it has been very
dreary.&nbsp; Even on the brightest of days it is very gloomy. <br>
One Halloween night about 15 of us went out in 3 seperate
vehicles.&nbsp; There were 5 of us in the truck that I was in.&nbsp;
All of us were beside the driverside door.&nbsp; At midnight there was
the most GOD AWEFULL noise that came out of the woods.&nbsp; It sounded
like a man that was screeming while he was getting his throat
sliced.&nbsp; I can still to this day hear the noise in my head.&nbsp;
I can not make the noise and the description that I gave is the best
explination that I can give.&nbsp; Needless to say that in 3 seconds
flat we were all in the truck and at the end of the road before we
stopped to take a breath.&nbsp; I still have the scaar on my leg from
diving into the bed of the truck as the driver was pulling away.&nbsp;
I have not been back there since!!&nbsp; I did not hear screams or
laughter.&nbsp; Never heard someones feet dragging on the top of the
vehicle, or a jumping on the vehicle.&nbsp; Just the GOD AWEFULL noise.<br>
Also I would like to inform you that the Newport Hotel is
haunted.&nbsp; I never had a personal experience with these
ghosts.&nbsp; The former owner Jack, ( don't remember his last name)
has had experiences with them along with some past employees.<br>
Please know that the above information is true and accurate to every letter of the word!!!<br>

My Ghost Story<br>
<br>
By: moviegal68@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Ever since I was a young girl, me and my family have dealt with ghosts.
One incident in particular tho comes to mind. Me and my husband were in
bed one night. We lived in a rural area of Troy, Mo so there were
hardly any neighbors. My husband was sleeping and I heard someone say
"Shhhh". I immediately thought someone was trying to break into the
house. I kept listening and after a few minutes of hearing someone
talking, or rather whispering, outside, i woke up my husband. He went
to check the house and found nobody there. Later, after me and my
husband split up, I would hear people talking, shadows on the wall and
the weirdest feeling come over me when i would go to bed. As soon as I
would lay down, a wave would come over me. It went from my toes to my
head. The hair would stand up on end, my eyes would shut and I couldn't
yell or move. After a few minutes, the feeling would ease up and I
could get up and I would go into the living room. I always slept with
the lights on until I finally went to a psychic and she told me how to
get rid of them. I did a "salt ritual" and I never heard from them
again... altho I still see and hear ghosts where ever i go.<br>

feet it chased me halfway down a path of houses then towards the way by
the nearby school and still it followed me I ran home to my

told my grandparents the story they thought it might have been a
murderer and insisted that they take me home and I said ''no''.Then I
began to walk home with my book bag on my back and yet again saw the
figure it spoke to me&nbsp; it said ''Are you who I&nbsp; think you
are"? Then I said I dunno do you.Then he began to tell me how he lost

The Mountain House<br>
<br>
By: Dolphin9whale@aol.com<br>
<br>
My name is Samantha, 1 year I went up to my stepbrothers mountain
house,it was my first time up there and it was beautiful! We went dirt
biking up the mountain and went swimming in the pool.That Saturday was
the best!<br>
But the guy who owns the house and practically lives there warned us
about how the house is haunted. I started to freak but I sort of
already new that because when we where swimming the lights in the
pool(it was night time) kept on turning on and off and everybody,I mean
everybody was outside.The owner Ale was telling us that every Sunday
morning at 7:00 exactly the radio downstairs goes on and plays music,
and I know your probably saying someone playing a prank on us but
no,the radio is locked in a closet not near a plug and its broken.<br>
All that night that story was running through my mind.When I went to
bed I kept on saying to myself "It's not true, there's no such thing!"
but boy, was I wrong!&nbsp; <br>
For some reason I woke up at 7, maybe because I heard the opera&nbsp;
music playing up stairs!I was like"O my god it is true!" I just sat
there and listened for a while&nbsp; I heard the music change to rock
then to opera than to jazz and all kind of music. Then I heard foot
steps from upstairs,like tons of foot steps it sounded like a party was
happening up there! I was going to go up their and see what was going
on until the basement door flew open and&nbsp; made a big BANG!!! I was
about to pee my pants because I heard footsteps coming down the stairs!
(I was surprised that my step brother and my his cousins didn't wake
up! )I put my head under the covers and peeked out, I didn't see
anything but it got really cold&nbsp; in the room.<br>
The next morning I had to leave but I new something was in that house, and next time we go there I'm going to find out.<br>

House on Green Street.&nbsp; In the 1970's there were several college
students living there.&nbsp; At a party several blocks away, a girl
told of the house, so I said " let's go".&nbsp; We went by that night
and knocked on the door.&nbsp; We spoke to the people residing there at
the time and they confirmed the stories or lights turning on as well as
water turning on without anyone nearby.&nbsp; They also took us down
stairs where there was a table made from a baby grand piano.&nbsp;
There was no way a table of that size could have been brought into that
room.&nbsp; Under the steps, they had dug and found pieces of pottery
and such.&nbsp; They believed it was a hiding place for slaves and used
to hide them there as part of the underground railroad.&nbsp; There was
a picture in one of the rooms that caught my eye.&nbsp; The next day on
my way to Ocean City, I stopped at the house and offered to buy the
picture.&nbsp; They said just take it because we hate it.&nbsp; They
also said that after we left the night before,&nbsp; the water upstairs
turned on unexpectedly as did the lights in the dining room down stairs.<br>

My Grandmother's Spirit<br>
<br>
<br>
By: charlotte.arthur@sympatico.ca<br>
<br>
My grandmother who we all called nanny is living with my parents, it
goes like this my family and I have lived in our house since 1982 and
my grandparents came to visit once in a while, my nanny was awesome she
was always there for us and with my mom especially, she had a really
tough life, anyways, she always had said to my dad that before she died
she would come and visit one last time, this was in 1986 anyways she
got really sick and died that year.&nbsp; One night my sister had her
friend over and they were sleeping, the french doors were all locked,
at 3 a.m the doors flung wide open scared both my sister and her
friend, my mom came rushing down and closed the doors, that same night
my nanny died, and I think it was her travelling all the way from
england to visit, for she said she would. I have felther presence a few
times and my sisters as well, one night I was in the kitchen and heard
a bang, I ran up to see what it was and there was nothing there, I felt
her presence and knew it was her telling me she was there, another time
my sister and her boyfriend were talking in the tv room and the fire
had died down all of a sudden there was a huge fire starting in the
fire place and then it died , we all believe it was our nanny, I do not
know she is still with my parents since that time I have moved out and
my sisters as well, but I do believe that she is with all of us
watching out over us.<br>

When I was a cashier 2004-2006 many time I would be the closing cashier
and opening cashier the next morning. We do the normal routines of
cleaning the counter, straightening candy, fixture displays and to come
in the next morning trash all over the floor, registers that had full
rolls of receipt paper, find them pulled out to the floor. Displays
have an item from a different department placed on a peg. Something you
would have caught the night before. Or and entire sock rack cleared to
the floor. Phone ringing and have no number from which the call is
coming from.&nbsp; And opening crew would just look and say &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t
like that when we closed last night.&#8221; I have witnessed many occasions
that I have walked thru a door way and have many doors slams shut
behind me, that were normally doors jammed open that could not be shut
all the way!? A manager had to pull an overnighter during remodeling
and from boredom thru basketballs in a 5 ft x 4 ft box on the top shelf
of the warehouse to leave and comeback to find the entire box had fell
to the floor from 20+ feet high. Expensive treadmills stored on the
same level shelf have been destroyed by tumbling to the floor. All
these items have been secured down; the weights evenly distributed and
have been there for sometimes months. May I disclose these are metal
frames and shelves that are bolted to the concrete floor and the walls,
shelves 5-6 feet deep and 5 feet between each shelf.&nbsp; During our
remodeling in March 2004 many of the workers said the lights went off
frequently or the PA system that plays our music went from a reasonable
volume to screaming loud. For those who don&#8217;t know the west wall (look
at the front of the building) when being built collapsed on a man and
was killed instantaneously. Many say his spirit still lurks around or
is stuck inside the building. If passing thru&nbsp; stop in and ask to
speak to a manager and they will tell you, no lie what really goes on
the in four walls of the Orange park Sports Authority. ~Cashier Pretty<br>

Haunted Places<br>

Just thought I would send you a little note of a haunting I experienced
years ago in St. Paul, Minnesota. I don't tell many people about this
but after reading your haunted places in Minnesota list, I thought I
would share my experience.<br>
I worked at the High Bridge Power Plant in St.Paul in the early 1980's.
I was an operator and had to do my equipment checks every shift. When
working the midnight shift, the was an area in the plant called the
electric side. Within this area was a cardox room and an auxillary
transformer room. It was always dark and damp and gave me a really
uneasy feeling when walking through there. I actually would run
sometimes because of my uneasyness.<br>
On two different occurrences, I had a haunting image of an Indian
chief. The first occurrence happened when I entered the aux transformer
room and saw a shadow of an Indian chief's side profile against a wall
walking along about the same speed as myself in the same direction. The
second time I entered the same room and at the other end of the
room&nbsp; there is a door with a window in it. I saw the face of a
Indian chief staring back at me for a few seconds. I call him an Indian
chief because of a large headdress of feathers.<br>
After this happened, I kept it to myself and avoided this area. I was
talking to one of the older operators one day and I told him how I
hated to go in these rooms, and without telling him why he responded "
Why? Did you see the chief?" I was floored. After that comment, I told
him about my experience and he said he had similar experiences. We ask
some of our other co workers about any others seeing this and no one
stepped forward to admit anything. I know some people see things that
others cannot, so that didn't bother us too much.<br>
After doing some research, the power plant was built on the flats of
the Mississippi River where an Ojibwe Indian village sat years ago. <br>

Haunted School<br>
<br>
By: brown506@bellsouth.net<br>
<br>
Years ago when I was in elementary school, I went to a PTA meeting with
my Mom one night.&nbsp; Me and a couple of other kids were playing in
the darkened hallways.&nbsp; They were making plans for a fall carnival
and were supposed to show 3 Stoogies movies.&nbsp; At the very end of
one of the hallways,it was very dark.&nbsp; There seemed to be an open
room at the end that was pitch black.&nbsp; We stuck our hands inside,
but did not go in because we were afraid.&nbsp; We said that was
probably the room they would use for the movies because it was so dark.<br>
Later at the carnival, we found out that there wasn't a room there at
all.&nbsp; There were double doors leading outside to a covered
walkway.&nbsp; We told my friend's Grandpa about seeing a room there
that night instead of doors.&nbsp; He told us that many years before,
there had been a fire and that part of the school had burnt down, and
was not rebuilt.<br>
Could that have actually been a ghost hallway or something?&nbsp; I've
always wondered what would have happened to us if we had stepped into
the darkness that night.&nbsp; Would we have entered another time
dimension of just disappeared or something?<br>
I've never forgotten this, even though it was many years ago......probably more that 30.<br>

My Mum's House<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Carol1982davis@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Hi,<br>
<br>
I wanted to tell you about mum's house which I've never felt scared in.
I'm sure you'll agree there is definitely a haunting, although I'm sure
it's friendly and mischevious but my eldest brother has been given a
hard time by it!! (He refuses to tell me a lot of what he has
experienced as it scared him so much)<br>
- When my eldest brother was very young, he reports loud slow footsteps
coming up the stairs whilst he was in bed. It sounded like (as he says)
someone dropping a brick purposely on each step. This continued all the
way up the stairs and came to a stop right outside the door at which
point he started screaming and shouting until mum came up. <br>
- When he was in his late teens, staying at the house alone, he had to
flee in the middle of the night after a massive crash from directly
above (my room). (He was sleeping on the sofa) He said it sounded like
the big oak wardrobe I had in my room had come crashing down. When he
returned the next morning, nothing was out of place apart from the
cellar door being pushed open right to the wall as though it had been
blasted open (which it had never before or since done - the hinges seem
to prevent this and also it was always locked)<br>
- About 8 years ago, everyone was awoken in the night by what sounded like (I think) a TV being thrown down the stairs.<br>
- When I was 16, there was a number of incidents in the bathroom (which
my cousin and brother reported there was someone moving about inside
when they were playing in the hall when they were youngsters even
though they knew nobody was in there!). <br>
My dad came in to tell me my bath had been run - I went in to see the bath was half full of water yet no-one had run this!<br>
- The taps were always being turned on, once, both so much that water
was gushing all over the floor and I had to struggle to turn them off.<br>
- Once, my dad had come in to find his clothes so neatly folded they
looked like they had been 'ironed to a compact perfect square sitting
on the floor.' He said they were folded in a bizarre way.<br>
-There is always a strong smell of cooking in the bathroom, although I
can't describe what it might be as I can't recognise it. This was
always there when I was 16 and then went but I smelt it again the other
day for the first time in years.<br>
Recently:<br>
I started playing tricks on my mum by hiding her glasses. Shortly after
I started this, the 'ghost' seemed to follow suit, hiding them in an
unused draw and under the chair. <br>
Me and mum were playing cards quite regularly. First, four cards from
the pack turned up in a tin kept on the table. When I challenged the
ghost (saying there was no pattern), all the 3's went missing and
turned up in the same place when my little cousin found them by
accident. Then I said out loud the whole pack would go missing which,
inevitably, it did!!<br>
Maybe the most bizarre incident - mum took some matches out of a box to
put on the fireplace in the living room. A few hours later when she
went to use some, she realised the sulphur had gone so she was left
with useless sticks!! There was still a shadow of pink on them and
after checking the rest of the pack, they were all normal. <br>
I've also seen a black shadow twice - once I felt this right next to me
and the cat seemed to see it too as she stared where I had felt it
close to me. (The cat is always acting very strangely!) <br>
I thought you might like to use some of these stories as I'm very proud
of 'our ghost' and it keeps me guessing as to what it's going to do
next!!<br>
<br>

Safe Trip Home<br>
<br>
By: speedy9747@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Shannon* and I had been life-long friends and had just completed our
first year of college apart.&nbsp; We were looking forward to reuniting
over the summer and taking a week-long forget-the-stress-of college
trip.&nbsp; After spending the first week of summer break at our homes
with our families, we set out to take a trip to the gulf coast of
Mississippi.&nbsp; It was to be our first trip together since Spring
Break our high school Senior year.&nbsp; <br>
Once we arrived in Gulfport, we spent most of our time either in the
hotel pool or the casinos.&nbsp; Neither of us were (or are) gamblers,
but we had the best time watching people (and believe me, you see all
kinds at a casino) and meeting people.&nbsp; After our week of freedom,
we had decided to leave later in the evening on Sunday in an effort to
avoid some of the traffic from the vacationers who were coming to and
leaving from the area.&nbsp; Shannon* wasn't feeling well so I opted
for the first few hours of drive time.&nbsp; Beyond that, I would much
rather drive in the daylight.&nbsp; <br>
The first leg of our trip home was rather mundane.&nbsp; Shannon* slept
much of the way while I occupied my time scanning through the radio
stations.&nbsp; After about 4 hours on the road, I pulled in to a gas
station to fill up, stretch my legs and take a much needed restroom
break.&nbsp; Shannon* assured me that she knew the way and was okay to
drive, as dusk was creeping up on us.&nbsp; Within the first 30
minutes, I too, fell asleep.<br>
The next thing I remember, I am jumping out of the seat, wide awake,
screaming until it actually hurt my throat "Watch out for the
owl!"&nbsp; This scared Shannon* half to death, understandably.&nbsp;
She jerked and fought with the steering wheel before finally getting
the car back under control.&nbsp; Once the excitement ended, she asked
me what the commotion was about and for the life of me, I couldn't
remember.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Afraid to fall asleep again and unnerved by a dream that I couldn't
remember nor forget, we made idle chit-chat for the next few
miles.&nbsp; I was looking out the front window when I got this "off"
feeling in my stomach.&nbsp; Before I could figure it out, I was
screaming "Watch out for the owl!"&nbsp; <br>
The next thing I know, feathers are flying, the car is spinning and I
don't know who's screaming higher or louder, Shannon* and I or this
massive screech owl that has somehow landed in the back seat through
the opened T-tops.&nbsp; I don't remember the actual accident, but
Shannon* and I are walking around the car, checking for damage and
arguing about which of us is going to reach in the back seat to get the
dead owl out.&nbsp; Finally, a good samaritan pulls over to give us
assistance and we get back on our way. <br>
We pull off the interstate and find a well-lit bustling gas station
where we will be "safe".&nbsp; As we are walking through the door,
Shannon* remarks, "I've been here before."&nbsp; We are discussing our
strange Deja-vu events in the not-so-solitude of a public restroom when
a woman walks up to us, touches both of us on our foreheads and starts
speaking to us. <br>
Since this incident, Shannon* and I have argued at length about what
the woman said.&nbsp; All we can figure is that she spoke to both of us
at the same time but we heard the conversation as if it were spoken to
us independently and with specifics for each of us.&nbsp; Anyway, the
after minute or more conversation, she walked out of the
bathroom.&nbsp; Shannon and I both just looked at each other for a few
seconds trying to comprehend everything.&nbsp; When we walked out of
the bathroom, the attendant was getting ready to lock the doors of the
station as it was closing for the night.&nbsp; The station closed at 1
am meaning that we had been in that bathroom for over 3 hours yet it
only seemed like 10 minutes.&nbsp; <br>
That was more than 13 years ago and we still can't account for that
missing time.&nbsp; Since then, we've taken the same trip a few more
times, each without incident.<br>

My husband alone lived in this house before we were married. His mother
owned it.&nbsp; One night he woke up because he heard a noise, he
listened and it was footsteps coming up the basement stairs.&nbsp;
Heavy ones like a man would make.&nbsp; He laid there and waited.&nbsp;
Then he heard footsteps in the kitchen, the footsteps stopped just at
the front room doorway, (my husband slep in the front room).&nbsp; He
felt like it was an evil presence.&nbsp; Nothing happened and he didn`t
hear anything else so he got up and turned on lights and notheing was
there.&nbsp; His brother had stayed at the house before my husband
moved in and told my husband that one night he was walking toward the
bathroom and an arm came out and stared jabbing the air with a knife in
it`s hand.&nbsp; Then a few days later his brother was on upstairs
phone and "someone" <br>
got on basement phone and made a screaming noise in it.&nbsp; His
brother ran out of the house.&nbsp; He moved out a short time later.<br>
&nbsp; My husband then moved in the house.&nbsp; I moved into it and
stayed while we were looking for a house to buy.&nbsp; I was in kitchen
getting a drink of water,<br>
&nbsp; I heard the kitchen doorhandle turn,I looked and it was
moving,&nbsp; it was 3:00AM.&nbsp; The kitchen door opened to top of
basement steps and a door to the attached garage. I thought someone had
broke in.&nbsp; I ran to frontroom and told my husband and he ran into
kitchen and opened the door and searched. He found nothing,&nbsp; and
all the outside doors were locked.&nbsp; We found a house to buy and
moved out. His mother asked us to help paint the inside of the house
cause she was going to put it up for sale.&nbsp; While my husband was
there late one night, alone in the basement, he felt something and
looked behind him and saw a mist hanging in the air. He felt it was
friendly, so he said to it, "are you curious at what I am doing?" The
mist disappeared.&nbsp; Later his oldest brother who is a lawyer was
there finishing up a few things and something put a heavy hand on his
shoulder and shoved him.&nbsp; His wife was there and she told the"
presence" to leave her husband alone. She said she would never go in
the house again.&nbsp; The house was sold,&nbsp; but we noticed a "for
sale" sign on house 6 months later. Wonder if they encountered our
ghosts? There was two ghosts one was evil one was nice. This is the
truth. <br>
Six people encountered these ghosts.&nbsp; The eldest brother is a
powerful lawyer fron Texas and not the kind to believe these things
till he felt the hand and got shoved real hard and nothing was there.<br>

Haunted Museum in Geneseo, Illinois<br>
<br>
By: blukat@qconline.com <br>
<br>
I was directed to your site by a friend who noticed there had been no
"Ghostly" sightings from Geneseo, Illinois where we grew up. I
volunteer at the Geneseo Historical Museum and would like to report our
Spirit.<br>
Our museum is located in two homes joined by a wall, but built at
different times by brothers whose wives were very different. The
original home built in 1854 is a beautiful Italianate home with a
cantilevered open oak stairway complete with a coffin niche. Later when
the Wilson brothers bought this home for their families, the second
Mrs. Wilson wanted a more upscale home as she loved to entertain. The
first Mrs. Wilson was more of a homebody and enjoyed her family. They
built another 'side' to the original home in the 1860's. They had
identical entrances but were joined by a common wall. The older side is
the home of our spirit. She seems to be most comfortable in the
upstairs rear, near the children's room and servant's quarters. We
think she may have been a caretaker or nursemaid for the Wilson
children. She is usually felt when the museum is quite empty. We have a
Victorian Walk each December, no light downtown or car traffic. It's
lovely to sit upstairs and view the town as it may have been in the
1850's. Angie Snook, the curator, was sitting up in the bedrooms on the
second floor just after everyone else had gone home one evening and
felt a hand on her shoulder. She wasn't concerned as she thought it was
her husband who had been there earlier. When she turned about, no one
was there. She didn't feel afraid, just aware of another being in the
room. She's felt her presence there many times, seen lights go on and
off, and had doors locked in front of her. The basement on the 'newer'
side was a stop on the Underground Railroad. We wonder if there isn't a
spirit or two there also. You can see the places where the children
were put to hide up above the regular space.<br>

My Own Ghost<br>
<br>
By: blukat@qconline.com<br>
<br>
When sitting in the living room of our Victorian home, we've seen a
woman descending from the open stairway. She never speaks or
acknowledges our presence. Doors have been heard slamming; things have
been missing, then found; and the former residences had even more
pranks pulled on them. I think she likes us better as she's been quiet
for a while. She's dressed in blue Victorian dress, no hat. I assume
that means she's staying a while! :)<br>

Personal Hauntings<br>
<br>
By: mcknibble3@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; <br>
I was checking out your web site and came to the bottom and found this
address for personal experience hauntings. So let me tell you:<br>
This house is in Ellisville, Missouri (I will not say which exact
location because the house is is occupied by a family). Actually, this
house has had several different owners since we moved. I lived in this
house and the haunting happened when I lived there. The haunting is
directly related to me.<br>
My husband (at the time) and I had gone out to dinner and a movie not
long after the birth of my son and a relative was baby sitting my son
and 1 yr old daughter and I thought all had gone well until 2 days
later when I was asked if this relative had said anything to me by her
husband. I was not told anything by the babysitting relative herself (
at that time) but I had noticed the female relative had been acting
somewhat quiet and secluded to her room.&nbsp; The following day which
was a Friday, I was asked and told (all in one) that I should go
somewhere and get out to relax cause new mothers should get out to
relieve stress and not be stuck caring for the children 24 x 7 and etc.
On my way out the door, a family friend who was a Priest was coming in
and I thought nothing of it since he always came to visit at least once
a week. I went and did whatever and returned later. That
afternoon/evening the female relative came to me acting very - very
pensive and seemed almost frightened to speak to me. She stumbled over
her words and stuttered and such. Finally, I told her if there was
something wrong or some question to just spit it out. This was a woman
who was not afraid of much and had seen it all in life - she was a
school teacher and devotely religious but not crazy religious. She
started by asking me if I knew of a woman of a certain description she
gave and I said yes I do. She pleaded with me to not think she was
crazy to which I told her -there was no way I would consider her crazy,
being that she was the most amazing and intelligent woman I had ever
known. She said she had figured I would know who this person decribed
was because this person looked very similar to me. After her
description, I excused myself and went upstairs dumbfounded to my
storage closet and got out a box that had pictures in it and brought
down one particular photo. When I showed it to her she began to cry.
She exclaimed that was her, and I said, her-what? I asked what was
going on.<br>
The night she was baby sitting, she was downstairs watching TV, when
she heard my wee daughter just breaking into a very hard cry which
immediately turned into a very hard laughter for a 1 yr old. My
daughter continued laughing for a couple minutes so hard that the baby
sitter thought something may be wrong. She quietly crept up the stairs
as not to disturb what might be making the child laugh so hard
(thinking there might be a bird perched on the window sill or something
that might amuse her). She got 3/4's up the steps and heard a voice
talking to my daughter. The voice sounded she said, as if it were a
million miles away, but very loving and gentle. She stated the voice
said, "It's ok (child's name) don't cry, I'm your Gramma." She (the
baby sitter) said the apparition was sitting in the rocking chair next
to the baby bed and turned and looked straight at the babysitter as she
topped the stairs, and then before her eyes disappeared. My daughter
was doing the bouncy stand holding onto the top of her crib right in
that corner towards where the rocking chair was and suddenly stopped
laughing when the figure disappeared and the babysitter was standing
there in the doorway. The rocking chair was still faintly rocking.<br>
I didn't know what to think when I was told this and looked at the
babysitter and when I came out of my chilled fog, I said It is
impossible-my mother died in 1967. She swore it the truth to me and
cried and raised her hands in the air to the heavens and said she knew
she was not crazy. I believed her without a doubt because she would
NEVER have made a story up like this. This sort of thing would not even
be in her realm of reality on any given day. She was terrified by the
time she was done telling me about it and I hugged her and reassured
her, telling her she wasn't crazy and this was a possibilty of a visit
from another realm. She also explained to me that even though Father P.
had visited weekly that he had&nbsp; cleansed the house in a sort of
spiritual exorsicm on the Friday that I saw and greeted him. She showed
me a specific cross that was designed to slid open and inside it was a
bottle of holy water and it was to stay hung on the wall in the
livingroom. The Priest never came to the house after that day when I
was there, they would meet him at a coffee shop. <br>
The cross hung in its place until a house fire about 5 yrs later and
either someone (relative) took it or it disappeared because I never saw
the cross after that day. We rebuilt the house but sold it &amp; moved
shortly there after. <br>
Since this happened, I have seen appartitions appear 1 time-my mom -
grandmother and a gentleman I do not know, I totally believe she did
have this experience whole heartedly now. At the time, I thought it
real but it just didn't get the actual feel of the situation, which
until you are faced with the actual happening, you can only wish for it
&amp; imagine how it will affect your total being. There is always that
instant that you feel as if your brain has shut down on you and the
slow process of realization as you fight with yourself about&nbsp; - Am
I crazy?<br>
I swear this is a true happening-<br>

Respect your Mother<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; lucy_strother2001@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
When I was a child of about eight or nine, I went with my cousin to his
house. He was an only child and very spoiled. He was very ugly to his
mother. If he didn't get his way he would start cussing her. On this
day he was really being mean and cussing her. It made me so mad but I
couldn't do anything because he was a lots bigger and older then me. As
I stood there helpless watching the scene take place. All of a sudden I
heard a very loud slap. My cousin grabbed the side of his face and fell
back. My aunt grabbed him and asked him what was the matter and he told
her someone had slapped him. She shook her finger at him and said that
was you dead daddy. His daddy had died before he was born. To this day
I wonder who really slapped him. He is seventy now and I asked him if
he remembered the incident and he said sure, how can I forget. I guess
this is one of the unexplainable things. <br>

I moved to the airline road area back in 1999 with my parents before
going off to college.&nbsp; One day I was wading along the little
cotton Indian river with my fishing pole and came up to the airline
bridge road.&nbsp; A very bad odor like something was dead was filling
my nose.&nbsp; Just under the side of the bridge lying on the rocks
below was a dead dog which must have been hit on the road and thrown
over the bridge.&nbsp; The body had been decomposing and was a real
mess.&nbsp; The hair of the dog was off and in piles lying around the
body.&nbsp; I quickly left and headed home.&nbsp; That evening I was
talking to a friend of mine which has lived in the area her whole life
and had told me stories of this airline road bridge.&nbsp; While on the
phone and outside in front of our house I could hear a large dog
barking back down through the woods towards the bridge.&nbsp; I told my
friend on the phone about the dead dog I had seen earlier that day and
it must be another dog feeding on the carcass.&nbsp; She laughed at me
and told me again that the bridge was haunted and that I should go down
there and check on the dead dog again.&nbsp; I built up the nerve and
headed down towards the bridge.&nbsp; Using a spot light I looked over
the bridge at the rocks where the dead dog had been earlier only now I
didn&#8217;t see anything down there.&nbsp; I walked down the side of the
bridge to get a closer look.&nbsp; There was no body or bones
left.&nbsp; I thought that another dog had just dragged off the carcass
and that was it.&nbsp; Then I remembered the piles of the dogs hair
that had been just laying around.&nbsp; To my surprise, there was no
hair anymore either.&nbsp; Just the clean rock surface.&nbsp; So at
that point I ran as fast as I could back to the house and I cant help
but that to this day that for some reason that dead dog had come back
to life for the night.&nbsp; I took a buddy of mine back down to the
bridge the following morning and the dogs body, the bones, and the hair
were back on the rocks as if they had been there all along.&nbsp; <br>
Also one night around midnight I was driving my car across the bridge
and just after I came onto it, my headlights, interior lights, and my
radio all shut off at once.&nbsp; The engine kept running but all of my
electronics had shut off.&nbsp; I floored the gas as hard as I could
because I had heard about the car stories of the bridge.&nbsp; Once
again just after getting to the other side of the bridge all of my
electronics came back on.&nbsp; I had the car for another four years
and it never had another problem with any of its electronics.<br>
I have heard a story about the bridge and why it is haunted if you
would ever like to hear it.&nbsp; Something about an old lady crossing
it in a horse and buggy way back when it was a wooden bridge and the
carriage fell off the bridge killing the old lady on the rocks
below.&nbsp; There is also a very old concrete building hidden in the
trees right beside the bridge.&nbsp; Rumor has it that kellytown was
the first place around to have power and this old building must have
been part of that operation.&nbsp; The weird part is that there are no
doors into this concrete building.&nbsp; It stands maybe 25 feet tall
on one side and the other side runs into the side of the hill.&nbsp;
The old roof is full of holes now and I pity and kids who try to walk
onto it.&nbsp; It looks like a good place for someone to fall into and
break a leg.&nbsp; The only way into the concrete building would be a
long ladder.&nbsp; The inside looks as though it is full of leaves and
other debris.&nbsp; Id love to find out whats really inside the
building&#8230;. Or who<br>

Toledo's Collingwood Arts Center<br>
<br>
By: bhuffma2@UTNet.UToledo.Edu <br>
<br>
Hi, in order to make a correction to your ghost reporting on the
Collingwood Arts Center in Toledo, OH, it was not a bride who killed
herself that is haunting the building.&nbsp; It was a nun who became
pregnant.&nbsp; They found out and were going to kick her out, so she
hung herself in the basement near the stairs beneath the Gerber House
portion (the oldest part of the building built in 1875).&nbsp; She is
friendly, but sad and usually roams the first floor and second floor
C-wing hallways.&nbsp; Then there is the gremlin thing, for lack of
better definition.&nbsp; It kinda looks like a gremlin or monkey type
thing.&nbsp; Everyone there has seen it at least once.&nbsp; Once, a
former resident and three of his band mates were in one end of the
C-wing hallway and looked down towards the other end where there was a
table.&nbsp; They had placed their extension cord in the middle of the
table and this monkey/gremlin thing appeared completely opaque and real
and pulled it clear off the table onto the floor, started laughing, and
then ran away.&nbsp; Then there is the spirit in the basement.&nbsp; It
is pure evil.&nbsp; It&#8217;s like this dark spirit with no shape that is
usually in the Grotto area.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t get within 20 feet of the
grotto without feeling like a steel vice is squeezing my chest and I
can&#8217;t breath (I am a resident there, so that is how I know all these
stories).&nbsp; One night, I was down there painting clear on the
opposite end of the big room where the grotto is, and I felt this dark
energy rushing out of the grotto at me out of no where.&nbsp; I totally
felt like my life was actually in danger and could not breath, so I
took off running for the elevator.&nbsp; As I was standing there
beating the hell out of the button, I felt this strong force shove me
into the doors of the elevator.&nbsp; Once the elevator was up on the
first floor with me safely in it, the grip on my chest seemed to go
away.&nbsp; Then there are the two ghosts that protect the nun statue
at the far end of the C-wing in the stair well between the first and
second floors.&nbsp; Apparently, the residents used to throw huge
parties there all the time and set a keg at the foot of the
statue.&nbsp; I believe (I am kinda psychic, as in I have been able to
communicate with spirits for the most part and see them easily ever
since I was 4, or at least that was my earliest sighting that I can
recall and was able to prove) that the two ghosts are protecting the
sanctity of the statue.&nbsp; The one on the right side of the statue
is very mellow and loving and soothing so long as you don&#8217;t disrespect
the statue.&nbsp; The one on the left side though is the one to be
feared unless you just completely avoid eye contact with the statue and
keep walking, or unless you make it known that you are not there to
disrespect the statue.&nbsp; The statue is of St. Angela who is the
founder of the Ursuline nuns, which is the order that built the
convent.&nbsp; The Gerber house in the front was built in 1875, the
rest of the building was built in 1905.&nbsp; It in the past has been a
convent, a college (Mary Mansey, which the main building to that is
still erect and on the premises, but is boarded up and intensely
haunted as well), a school for children, an orphanage, and is now an
artists&#8217; commune.<br>

Haunting Experience.<br>
<br>
By: kellyloughney@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
I was in the military from 1999 to 2005.&nbsp; I was married from 2003 to 2005.&nbsp; <br>
The marriage was violent and abusive and unhealthy and I was in a
prolonged deep depression.&nbsp; We lived in two government housing
units in New Jersey, the first of which was torn down to make room for
newer buildings.&nbsp; When we moved to the first house, I could
immediately feel something negative, especially downstairs in front of
the guest bathroom and in the upstairs guest bedroom.&nbsp; Whatever
was there, I sensed it was a female entity, liked my husband but seemed
jealous of me.&nbsp; She would push me up and down the stairs, tripping
me and causing me to hurt my knees and back.&nbsp; She would cause my
dogs to deficate in the form of a cross on my floor downstairs in front
of the guest bathroom.&nbsp; She would materialize as a dark, suspended
shadow in the same place.&nbsp; She would take on the form of my
husband and walk into our bedroom (my dog could see this) while my
husband was downstairs.&nbsp; <br>
She was flick the lights on and off when my husband left a room I was in.&nbsp; <br>
She would plug and unplugg things.&nbsp; The second house had something
different that would walk up and down the stairs all night, throw open
doors, rotate knives to face me, move my military cap, and leave
ectoplasm on the inside of the guest bedroom.&nbsp; My dogs used to
chase it around the house.<br>

Australian Stories<br>
<br>
By: shellybellylondon@yahoo.co.uk<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope you find these interesting.<br>
A work colleague of mine mentioned that she had heard strange
breathing/wheezing noises whilst in bed late at night and&nbsp; thought
that one of her children had come into her bedroom, but when she turned
on the light she was alone.&nbsp; She thought it might be a nocturnal
animal in the roof or outside and asked me if I knew of anything that
made this noise.&nbsp; She had checked that there was no one outside
her window and had security lights outside her property that would
alert her to any movement outside.<br>
Being from Australia, we sometimes get possums (little tree dwelling furry<br>
animals) in our roof at night that scratch about and make quite a lot
of noise and I suggested that this was what was disturbing her at
night.&nbsp; She said she didn't hear anything except this funny
breathing sound and I<br>
jokingly suggested that her house was haunted.&nbsp;&nbsp; To this she replied that<br>
she knew no one had died in the house.&nbsp; I replied that I didn't
think a person had to have died in a particular place in order to haunt
it.&nbsp; She then remembered that the gentleman who lived in the house
before her had sadly died after a long battle with emphysema.&nbsp; Her
bedroom was the same room that had been his bedroom.<br>
Also, my sister lived in a brand new house in South Western Australia
where she encountered what I believe was aboriginal spirits.&nbsp; The
area where the house was cleared bushland and both her and her
neighbors experienced funny phenomenon. She would see movement out of
the corner of her eye and would turn to look but find nothing.&nbsp;
She often heard what sounded like little pebbles being thrown and
bounce off the tiled floor but never find any pebbles.&nbsp; The
kitchen/living area was open plan and while watching t.v. you would
hear scratching and rustling in the bin in the kitchen.&nbsp; I thought
this would be a mouse or a cockroach or something (gross)but there was
absolutely nothing in/around the bin to make this noise.&nbsp; One
night she had a large party of friends over and the front double doors
of the house that were locked and bolted opened on its own.&nbsp; A
visiting friend woke up one night in the guest room after hearing a
knock on her bedroom door. She said "come in" but no one was there.
They were renting the property and as such were particularly careful
not to damage the interior paint work on the house. In the hallway of
this house they found a very deep scratch in the plaster of the wall
that looked like it had been made with a very sharp implement.&nbsp; It
was quite high up on the wall and a couple of inches long as well as
quite deep, it would have taken some force to make this scratch.<br>
The washing machine hose burst (or was unplugged?) at the house as well.<br>
This caused the whole house to be completely flooded and she had to
hire industrial dryers to dry the carpet. They've since moved house but
never felt threatened or unhappy while living there.<br>

Hauntings/Stories at the Carolina Theater<br>
<br>
By: NealBrwr@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Hello. I am fairly new to your site. I found it by Obiwan's Ghost
Website and I must say both sites are nearly inarguably the best ghost
sites on the Net. <br>
As for my ghost reports, I have stories. I also have an account from a friend.<br>
I'll tell you the account from my friend.<br>
My friend and myself are active in our local community theater, and
frequently perform in plays or productions put on by the organization.
Well, my friend was doing a play I was not in, and strike (the
returning of the props, set pieces, and etcetera to their owners) was
in full swing. Him and his brother were cleaning up the men's dressing
room when their story begun.<br>
They had just climbed the stairs to the DR and they decided the start
cleaning the windows. The two brothers turned to one of the windows
when there was something written on it. It read "I love Jason". The
boys were so frightened that they ran down the their father. He told
them to go back up and they did so. When back up in the DR the same
mirror read,"I hate Jason". The boys again went to their parent. He
decided to go up with them. The three went to the mirror and it
read,"Get out".<br>
My friend says it was written in half-blood, half lipstick.<br>
I speculate that maybe this is chronicling a past love affair.<br>
I have been in that DR many times before, a few times alone. You get a cold feeling and one of being watched.<br>
The theater has a few other ghost stories, but I'll save that for later.<br>

My Birthday Experience<br>
<br>
<br>
By: mbennett@theedgepc.net<br>
<br>
ive been reading this site for many years but never sent any thing in till just a few days ago....about the house in kentucky..<br>
.with the&nbsp; dissapearing card game and other scary stuff going
on...well after i had sent it in i had remembered something from when i
was around<br>
13 or so...this story is unfortunitly true..<br>
it was my 13th birthday..it was a good day minus the fact my little brother had dumped my cake upside down on the<br>
&nbsp;kitchen floor....(my mother is a neat freak)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i was very upset <br>
and cried ( as girls do) my mom, to cheer me up, made it funny and
started eating it off the floor, so we all huddled together in the
floor laughing&nbsp; with are forks and ate it right off the floor...(i
know you think thats sick it was just mopped)..i opened my presents and
played with my balloons....well anyway that nite i went to my room and
closed my bedroom&nbsp; door and turned my fan ( for the noise) on,
turned off the light and crawled in bed...i was the last one to turn in
for the nite my parents and sisters and brother was already
asleep...ive never been one to just fall asleep...so i tossed and
turned as i always did and while flipping on my back yet again i
noticed something ...it scared the crap out of me...it was a shiny
round mass that kinda glowed but not really and it&nbsp; floated back
and forth kind of in a bobbing motion...i quickly jerk my covers over
my entire body&nbsp; and didnt budge...for a moment i thought
maybe&nbsp; its gone....i slowly dropped the the covers off my face to
see&nbsp; and its still there...im terrified....i flip the covers back
over my face and i hope that it dosent get me...for almost four hours
it was there, just hovering by my dresser...i tried to get the courage
up to call for my mom, but i never could...i thought if i yelled it
might just come across there and get me....i was sweating my guts out,
it was so hot under my covers....and over that four hour period, in the
middle of the nite it just stayed there un moving or not
dissapering&nbsp; or what ever those things do..around 5 in the
morning&nbsp; i finally got the courage to yell like hell for my
mom...i belted out one loud MMMOOOOMMMMM!!!!!&nbsp; <br>
i waited a few minutes not peeking out from under my covers,&nbsp; then
i hear my mom open my door and quietly say my name...then she started
to close the door back...i yelled ,(real loud) "open the door and turn
on the light"!!!when the light flooded the room i threw the covers back
and ran to my mom...i was positively soaked from sweat, my mom was
looking at me trying to figure out what was wrong and i looked were the
silvery, circular, slightly ,and i&nbsp; mean slightly glowing mass was
and i just slapped my hand on my head...i just said..."oh my god"..my
mom looked at me and looked at my dresser and she asked what was going
on...well due to my birthday..more in general&nbsp; my birthday
balloons..the string on my silver aluminum looking balloon had caught
in my fan on my dresser, it was rotating right to left ,thus the moving
of&nbsp; the balloon..it was pitch black in my room, nothing but moon
light flooding in,which reflected off the balloon...i was so imbarest,
my mom laughed at me so hard she could not go to sleep the rest of the
nite...she promised not to tell eney one...(ya right) i have been made
fun of over that one nite&nbsp; since then...<br>
.i know its not a real ghost story but it was totally scary and&nbsp; true...<br>
i know i am not the only one to have a stupid moment hahaha i hope<br>

My Past Experiences<br>
<br>
By: imrd@fairpoint.net<br>
<br>
i used to live in a house on the bangor rd. in houlton.i know i counted
at least 10 spirits in the house plus a "cold spot "in the center of my
living room.alot of people that would come to the house would be afraid
to go to my bathroom because they said they felt this eerie,creepy
spirit boring holes into them,as though he was eyeing them
intently,well,i'll tell you,i never liked that bathroom myself.i never
liked to even shower!i had other spirits all through the house and even
in the basement and attic.i would talk to them and tell them if they
did not mess with me,i would not mess with them and we could all share
the house.there was one particular spirit that lurked outside that was
scarey.all i ever saw was a black silloutte of this man pacing back and
forth by my kitchen door.people told me that was an evil spirit but all
the good ones inside would not allow him to enter within--that always
gave me the chills to hear,but i started to believe it to be true.i can
go on with more tales from that house but will stop here......<br>

The Jinxed House<br>
<br>
By: spazzy27-is-so-cool@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
This was from about 2002-2006 and I was there from about age 8-11 <br>
This is the Story of my old home, a haunted or jinxed home you may call
it very misfortunate things happened there first of all my Great aunt
was the landlord and lived upstairs and we lived downstairs. Everyday
she was screaming about something, and my mom and dad were all stressed
all the time. It started to get bad after my Great Uncle, Pete, died.
everything went down from there we payed the bills cause she didnt have
the money, but every other day we "broke" something, it was always our
fault. I could swear that something was watching us. things would
dissapear and then turn up a month or two later and we would turn the
house upside down looking for it. At night when i was sleeping I could
feel a pressence just right next to me with hot breath. and then when i
looked all i saw was DEEP dark patches in the halls. There was a wall
that was made out of rock and there were faces in them, not man made
but scary skeletal horrifying faces. that part was probably my
immagination. and then, the summer of 2006 was the end; It happened on
3 thursdays IN A ROW and it just got worse. Thurs. #1: My mom and land
lord got in huge fight and we were all were scared that we would get
kicked out. Thurs. #2: We got kicked out, but we had some time about a
month before she would get an eviction. and Thurs.#3 at about
12Midnight the fire trucks came screaming down the street and
everything went to hell. But nobody got hurt.<br>
We dont talk to the landlord anymore nor ever will. that part of out
lives is over and in the shadows. WE hated that place. And i Know just
KNow it was haunted something, somebody, was watching us not over us
like an angel but stalk like and it wasnt nice, i know this 100%
positive that it was haunted or there was a puljurgiest. I am sure of
it...<br>

My Cat Scooter<br>
<br>
<br>
By: thetraveller13@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
I got Scooter in December of 1993.&nbsp; He was a grey striped tabby
with the sweetest personality. Strange when I got him he was a wild
kitten on a farm. <br>
He would usually sleep at the foot of my bed either on or by my feet
where I could feel him.&nbsp; I left him at home with my parents when I
went to college in south Alabama.&nbsp; When i got married April of 95
my husband and I collected Scooter and moved to Key West as he was in
the Navy.&nbsp; November we drove up to Orlando for a Thanksgiving
family get to gether and had my neighbor watch Scooter.&nbsp; We lived
on base so I didn't worry when I left the sliding glass door cracked
open for him to go in and out as he pleased.&nbsp; We got home late
Saturday night and Scooter came when I called him.&nbsp; I decided to
leave the sliding glass door open so he could go back out.&nbsp; I woke
up around 4 am to hearing dogs barking and a cat screaming and I ran
around the house and didn't see him.&nbsp; We lived on the 2nd floor so
i ran out to the balcony and yelled for Scooter and scaring the dogs
off.&nbsp; I couldn't see him, so I called his name again.&nbsp; I was
almost 7 months pregnant with my son so I went down the stairs as fast
as I could and called his name again, heard his faint meow and went
over too him.&nbsp; He was a loving cat and I never had any reason to
fear him. But I couldnt bring myself to get close to him afraid he
would strike out at me. He was laying on the ground and I knew he was
hurt bad.&nbsp; I laid down on the ground and talked to him until my
husband came out when he realized I wasnt in bed.&nbsp; He told me to
go upstairs and get a towel ready he would bring him up and I called
the vet.&nbsp; The vet met us at the clinic and started checking him
over and decided it would be best if we put him to sleep.&nbsp; He left
the room so we could say our last goodbyes&nbsp; and came back in with
the stuff to put him to sleep.&nbsp; I was standing behind Scooter and
as the vet put the needle in his paw he turned his head and looked back
at me and meowed one last time.<br>
Now for the ghostly encounters with Scooter.<br>
My husband saw how depressed I was after losing Scooter so he got me
another cat named Squodunk.&nbsp; Squodunk was full white with 2 black
splotches on his forhead.&nbsp; I had my son in Feb of 96 and Squodunk
would sit by my sons crib or bassinete and hiss and growl and then jump
in with him.&nbsp; He never hurt him but it would scare me.&nbsp; We
eventually gave squodunk away.&nbsp; After Squodunk was gone I would
wake up in the middle of the night and feel a weight by or on my feet
and i would move my feet a little bit and it would leave.&nbsp; The
first time it happened I didnt put it together until it got to be a
nightly ritual.&nbsp; I told my husband that Scooters spirit was
sleeping on or by my feet.&nbsp; He didn't believe me until one night I
told scooter to go bug daddy and he jumped on his chest.&nbsp; We
couldn't see him but felt his presence.&nbsp; We moved from Key West to
Pensacola, FL and within a few weeks Scooter found his way back to
us.&nbsp; 6 weeks later we moved to Texas.&nbsp; Shortly after we moved
to Texas, our first night in our new home he was right there with
me.&nbsp; We got 2 dogs and the dogs would go nuts at night until
scooter stopped coming.&nbsp; We moved again almost a year later to
north alabama and got another cat when i realized scooter wasnt coming
after a few months.&nbsp; I had our daughter shortly after moving to
Alabama.&nbsp; We always had some animal around the house at that
point, but over the 4&nbsp; years of living there we lost our
animals.&nbsp; Shortly after we had lost our last pet my daughter was
almost 3 and woke up in the middle of the night screaming about a cat
jumping up on her in bed.&nbsp; She climbed up in the bed with me and a
few minutes later i felt Scooters weight by my feet for the first time
in years. <br>
I told my daughter about Scooter and that he wouldnt hurt her.&nbsp;
she was scared because she couldnt see him.&nbsp; So I told him to go
away and not scare her.&nbsp; She is 7 now and still talks about the
ghost cat.&nbsp; Occasionally I think i can still feel him laying
against my feet.&nbsp; And if I talk to him he will jump up on my chest
and go to sleep and his pressure will slowly fade away.<br>

"The Sixth Sense?"<br>
<br>
<br>
By: danesdoitbetter@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My mother told me that a few times when I was little, I was probably 4
or something, I use to see my grandfather. I never in my life ever met
any of my grandfathers because they died before I was born. My mom told
me that I woke her up and told her that my grandpa said hi, which was
her dad. She asked me that it was just a dream and I told her my story
and in great detail. I woke up and walked down the hall into the
kitchen. I saw my grandpa sitting at the table reading the newspaper
and smoking his pipe. I said hi and he said "Hey there Pumpkin," in
reply. My grandfather died from lung cancer from smoking too much. And
what I told my mom was that he was coughing really bad. Then woke her
up and told her and she believed me because thats what he use to do
every morning and he use to call her Pumpkin also. I dont even remember
that night but my mom remembered everything!<br>
Then when I was 13 I remember I kept waking up for a whole week at the
same time 2:15 am. For a whole week I kept waking up at that same time!
It started from a Sunday then on that Friday I remember waking up on my
back. And for some reason I felt like I wasnt alone. I had a water bed
and something at the feet of my bed kept creating waves. I looked
around for my cat because I thought that maybe from her jumping off it
created those waves. I looked down from over my bed and I saw her
pacing around my room. I called her name and she didnt even look at me.
Then out of no where she hissed and ran out my bedroom, by this time
the waves had stopped. Then a couple minutes later on I was laying on
my back again and I felt a weird tention in the room. The air felt
stiff. It felt like someone was smothering around me and I had a hard
time of breathing. Then I looked to the right of me and I saw I shadow
of someone standing the doorway. It was of a tall man. It was nothing
but a shadow...no face...just the outline of his body. He seemed to
wear a top hat and a tux of some sort. For some reason I felt
threatened by this image. I had a feeling like this wasnt a friendly
person to be in counters with. It felt like he wanted to harm me. I
looked away and closed my eyes hoping that he was just disappear. When
I looked back he was gone but I still felt the stiffness. I started to
look around the room for the shadow man again. But I couldnt find him.
Then it happened. I felt something touch my stomach and I looked down
and the indent of a hand print was on the blanket on my stomach. I
screamed and I felt it relised from my stomach. I was calling out for
my mom and dad..and it took a while for them to come in. After they
came and told me that everything was going to be fine, all the same
soothing words your parents say then left. I continued to lay on my
back and then I looked again over to the door way but this time I saw a
shadow of a elderly woman with curly hair sitting in wheel chair. At
this image I felt relaxed and safe and I went to sleep right after
that. In the morning my mom got a call that my great grandma died at
2:00 am. I think she came to say hello and goodbye because I never
really met her.<br>

My Grandfather's House<br>
<br>
By: Lilsis412005@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
My grandfathers father and mother went built a house for their wedding
in 1920, and it was given to my grandfather and then to my Aunt. I
stayed there for a week in the summer of 1998, when i was 9. I was
sleeping in my Grandfathers old room, which was turned into a spare
room for guests after my aunt moved in. one night i went up to bed, and
i was almost asleep when i seen something out of the corner of my eye.
I looked up to see what it was and i seen the figure of a man standing
in the closet doorway. He was wearing a plaid sweater and tan dress
pants and a hate that looked like a golfers hat. he was also smoking a
pipe. I was sure that it was just my imagination so i rubbed my eyes
and looked again. He was still there. So i shut my eyes for almost 10
minutes before i looked again, and he was still there. I was really
scared and i couldnt move. I wanted to go downstairs with my aunt but i
couldnt. so i just layed there and stared at the figure. It felt like
forever before i finally just shut my eyes and went to sleep. The next
morning the figure was gone,and i told my aunt and my mom about it.
They didnt know who it would be because nobody ever died in that house,
and it was built for my Great Grandfather. They said i described the
figure to clearly for it to have been fake, and that i was to young to
make up a story like that. I never did see this figure again. Late at
night if you are sitting down stairs, and its quiet, u can hear things
upstairs. things Moving around, smashing off of walls, things dropping
and breaking, even people talking. Its the same if you are upstairs and
its quiet. You can hear the same exact stuff downstairs, but nobody
knows who it is or why. There is no explaination. In 2004, my aunt sold
the house to another family, and she told them of the things that
happen. but they still wanted it. To this day i have no idea if they
have had any experiences like my family did.<br>

The Haunting from the Attic<br>
<br>
<br>

When we moved into my house, we werent sure exactly how old it was, but
from the design of the doors, bathroom, and basement, we knew it was
pretty old. Our attic was huge, but there were no actual walls, and the
floor was rotting and getting torn up. My dad made arrangements to rip
everything up and start again, since what we needed was much more than
a simple repair. When they were ripping the wood off the walls, they
found a very old newspaper, from 1917, with a picture of my house on
the front page. (im guessing it was a local newspaper). It said that
the house was also built in 1917, meaning that today its 90 years old.
Every night,&nbsp; when i was going to sleep, (i was sure everyone else
was asleep) i would hear someone walking in the attic from one side of
the house to the other. The floors were really creaky so i was sure
there was something up there. One day i was with my friend, and i
finally got the guts to go up there. Although we didnt see anything,
there was a very eery feeling that something or someone was watching u,
so we ran out. She slept over, and took a shower in my bathroom, and
ran out in a towel yelling. She said while she was in the shower, she
heard a man cough very loudly, and when she looked out of the shower
curtain, she said she saw a shadowy figure disappear very quickly. I
was scared as hell, but i had to take a shower any way too. I had my
eyes closed washing the soap out of my hair, and i swore i heard some
little girl giggling just outside the shower tub. the curtains were see
through, so all i had to do was turn my head and look, and i thought i
saw what seemed to be a small girl with blonde hair running out of the
bathroom. U know i ran out of that bathroom fast. Another night, in my
parents room, my mom was sleeping with my dad. She had a small pottery
box on the dresser infront of the bed, and it was about 6 inches away
from the edge. She said in the middle of the night, the top to the
pottery box fell off the dresser onto the floor, but she said it
sounded like someone had grabbed it and thrown it to the floor really
hard. Her door was closed so it couldnt have been the cat, and my dad
was sleeping next to her. Then, i had a bucket of rocks on my dresser,
about 4 inches from the edge. It was a big bucket FULL of rocks, so it
wouldve taken A LOT of force just to move it, not just a litle wind or
something. So i heard it fall off the dresser, and after hearing that
big bang, i was wayyyy to scared to move. i jumped so hard i went from
my body extending all the way across the bed to a little ball in the
middle of it. My mom heard it so she came in, turned on the light, and
we sat there and wondered how the rocks couldve fallen off the dresser
like that. Everywhere in the house it felt like someone was behind you
or something. The floors would randomly creak out of no where even if
no one was walking. When my dad gets home from work, he has a routine:
open and shuts the door verryyy hard, then throws his keys on the
table, loud enough to hear it. Then hed walk around and, and u were
sure from the stomping of his feet he was home. One night, my sister,
my mom, and i, were in the same room (we were little) and we swore we
heard my dad come home, we heard the door, the keys, and everything. We
ran down the stairs to say hi, but no one was there, which made us
wonder what was the noise, and how did it happen. The basement was very
scary too. There is a small room under the stair case. with absolutely
no light it in, and 24 7, its pitch black. no one has ever gone all the
way in it, and we dont plan on it. I dont no about u, but i believe
cats can see ghosts too, and my cat would stare at walls&nbsp; and
suddenly change the area he was looking at as if something was there
and moving around. After the attic was finished, this didnt happen much
anymore, gladly, which led me to think that most of the ghosts were
coming from the attic..but once in a while there is always something
that happens that scares me out of my socks. <br>

UNEXPLAINABLE!<br>

This is a story i was told by my two aunts {whose names i will make up
for privacy reasons} {Leanne and Cheryl}&nbsp; which i found very
disturbing.<br>
When my two aunts were younger they shared a room, they were getting
ready for bed, and as a joke aunty Leanne said 'hope the devil doesn't
get you while your sleeping', aunty Karen said 'ha ha very funny', in
the early hours of the morning, aunty Leanne got up to go to the
bathroom, when she came back to the bed room she heard scratching
noises at the window, when she went to see what was making the noise
there was nothing there, thinking no more of it she went back to bed
and fell asleep, the next morning aunty Leanne told aunty Karen about
the noises she heard in the night, aunty Karen thought aunty Leanne was
just being silly, so to try and shed some light on the topic aunty
Leanne took aunty Karen outside to their bedroom window and there on
the window sill there were claw marks.<br>
6 years ago my family moved to the UK, and were living at my two aunts
house, my younger sister and i shared their room, but we never shared
the experience that my two aunts had, but my grandmother has a wood at
the back of her house, my sister and i being curious decided to go and
check it out, an hour later my grandmother came looking for us and when
she found us told us never go into the wood again, we were told later
on that a young girl went missing in the wood and was never found,
apparently its haunted by 2 men who were hanged in the early 1900's, i
think its real creepy, what do you think?<br>
