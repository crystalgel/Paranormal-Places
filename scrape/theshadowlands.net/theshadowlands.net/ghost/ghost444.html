<hr width="100%"><big>My Experiences in Michigan's Haunted Places<br>
<br>
By: skeletorsnail@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In Livonia, the little cemetery at 5 mile and Farmington.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last summer a friend of mine decided to gather a
couple of our friends together to go check out this haunt. The cemetery
is located across from Livonias city hall and police station, I live
within 2 miles from it. The cemetery itself is open to the public with
a small fence around it but open gates every hundred feet or so. Yet, I
doubt the police will be thrilled about people hanging out in the
cemetery in the middle of the night, if they take notice. So a somewhat
low profile is necessary if your checking it out. I'm sure if you have
a camera and claim your just taking some photographs of the cemetery at
night, you can easily talk yourself out of any confrontation without
any reprimand. Anyways, the road is normally busy, and depending on
what day it is may be low to medium traffic at that time of night.
Either way, my friends and I went out on a weeknight, and the roads
were all relatively empty. We parked our two cars in a parking lot
around the block and walked a short distance to the cemetery itself.
Two of my friends stepped just inside the gates and stayed relatively
in the light, the area is fairly well lit with streetlamps. A couple of
our other friends walked to a place about midway through the cemetery
and took up point there. My friend who planned the trip and I headed
all the way to the back of the cemetery and took up places near the
back fence where we could survey the whole cemetery from. The cemetery
is pretty shallow in depth and only about three times as long in length
perpendicular to the road, in all an easy space to watch the entirety
of. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we took up places by about 11:45 and the road was
completely free of traffic. Everyone waited and watched until about
12:10 and there were no signs of any ghosts. In all some people claimed
to have had creepy feelings, which is normal for being in a cemetery at
night I suppose, but no activity that night. After that we hung out in
the cemetery until about 12:30 when we decided to head out. In all, no
ghost dad and three girls (we originally heard it was two girls with
the dad,) but who knows.. The timing might not have been right, or any
other numbers of factors.<br>
On another note, <br>
In Redford, St Agatha School closed down for quite a long time, and has
recently opened as an elementary school I believe called "David Ellis
Academy West". It appears to be getting horrible reviews and may be
closing down again within the next few years. Anyways, all the kids I
knew who went there while growing up have all claimed it was haunted
and extremely creepy. Many of them say all the real activity would go
on at night though when there were no witnesses. Anyways, that's all I
know about that.<br>

Woods/Marsh- St.Augustine Florida Oldest City in the Country<br>
<br>
By: mooningmonkey@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
in the back of our neighborhood there are these woods/marsh that are
haunted,my friends and i have had many paranormal expieriences there.<br>
i saw this cat there and it was really pretty but it had a big scratch
on one of its sides so i went into the woods to get a better look at
it.I got 3 ft close to it when it suddenly ran away and actually
dissapeared into the marsh.<br>
One time&nbsp; i was in a secret hideout there when i heard a really
deep and loud bark in the main trail it was scary because it sounded
like a fierce Rotweiler or something.So I looked at were the noise came
from and there was nothing there I was still pretty scared so I started
to make my way out of the woods/marsh and I felt like some thing was
following me and I heard another bark right behind me so I started
running like heck.<br>
Once my sister was in the woods looking for me and she heard something
big like a human running towards her so she looked to see if it was me
but there was nothing there.She heard distinct foot steps behind her
yet nothing was there so she turned and ran out of the woods.<br>
these are only a couple of the many,many things that have happened there<br>

The Ghost Dog <br>
<br>
<br>
By: j_okeson@live.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This is a true story......<br>
I have a friend who lives in an apartment building in Algonquin
Illinois. My friend lives in&nbsp; a lower, one bedroom apartment, with
the landlords living upstairs. I have visited my friend on many
occasions, and nothing has ever happened. However one evening I spent
the night. When it was time for bed I laid on the couch, and had just
closed my eyes when I heard a sharp whining sound. I opened my eyes and
looked around and saw nothing. I tried to go back to sleep, when the
whining sound returned. I kept my eyes closed trying to ignore it,when
sudddenly I felt a paw scratching at my foot. I jerked open my eyes to
see nothing. I then went into my friend's room and woke him up. After I
explained what had happened, he explained. "this apartment is haunted
by the ghost of a dog, a German Shepard. I have seen him a few times.
All you have to do, when he bothers you, is tell him, good dog, it's
ok. and he will stop." Now, I am not one to be scared of every little
thing, so I went back to the couch half believing the story, but
entirely believing that my friend was having a good laugh at my
expense. After about an hour I fell into a sound sleep. I was awakened
by the same whining and pawing. I kept very still hoping it would stop.
I finally decided to open my eyes, hoping I would catch my friend, I
was wrong. What I saw, I will never, never, forget. standing at the
foot of the couch was a large German Shepard, its coat was full of mud
and leaves, its eyes were dull and lifeless, and it sat there looking
at me. I am not ashamed to admit I screamed and wet my pants. But the
dog didn't move. I finally was able to stammer out "ggood ddog, it's
ok" when I said those words the dog disapeared. I immediatly grabbed my
car keys,ran out the door, and went home. I didn't get to sleep until I
saw the reassuring first rays of the sun. My friend called me later
that afternoon wondering what had happened. When I told him he laughed
and said the ghost dog was friendly. Friendly or not I will never spend
the night in that apartment again. <br>

The House in Bingen, Washington<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Lucy.Adams@ucop.edu<br>
<br>
I posted a previous story about this house.&nbsp; I am the daughter of
migrant farm workers.&nbsp; Every summer we worked the fields up and
down California, Idaho, Washington and Oregon, picking cherries,
tomatoes, etc.&nbsp; We lived in whatever the land owners gave us to
live - one room cabins, old trailers, etc.&nbsp; One year, we were
shocked and pleased to learn we'd been loaned a lovely bright and sunny
home with a view of the Hudson River for the summer.&nbsp; We soon
found out why no one wanted to live there! <br>
We were six kids and I shared a bed with one of my sisters.&nbsp; One
night while we were whispering and giggling quietly as we always did
before we went to sleep, our cat hissed and ran out of the room.&nbsp;
At that precise moment, we both felt "something" just outside the
bedroom door.&nbsp; We pulled the blankets over our heads and lay there
frozen in fear.&nbsp; This is wierd - we could not scream or make
noise, it was like something had arrested our vocal cords (see my
previous story about my baby bro. and sis making cutting motions at
their throats - if you can find it).&nbsp; We lay there trembling as
the thing slowly walked into our room.&nbsp; It felt to me like a sad
woman.&nbsp; You could just FEEL the depression in the air.&nbsp; She
came to our bedside and then the side of the bed went down, dipped
down, and we knew someone was sitting there.&nbsp; I could feel my
sister shaking next to me as it was on her side.&nbsp; After a short
time, the woman slowly rose and walked out of the bedroom.&nbsp; Our
voices came back with a vengence and we screamed so loud my dad grabbed
his gun and my brother his baseball bat and ran into our room.&nbsp;
There were many MANY other things that happened, but to save space I'll
stop here.&nbsp; <br>
I have asked&nbsp; my parents where the house was and they don't
remember the address anymore.&nbsp; I wish I knew so that I could look
up the county records or old newspapers in the library, or something,
and try to find out what happened there.<br>

Techie<br>
<br>

<br>
i want to add another personal expirience to your web site. i went to
high school in pendleton or, and was a "techie" in the theatre dept.
one day , my&nbsp; best friend tyson, another friend ashley, and i were
relaxing after finishing the set piece we were working on. Tyson and i
were in the front row of seats and ashley was on the edge of the stage.
we were joking around and just being teens, when all three of us heard
laughing off to one side of the stage, we all thought it was our
teacher mr remington. that thought left as we then heard running across
an apperently empty stage, ashley later said that she felt something
like someone running three fingers across her back. when the footsteps
reached the other side of the stage there was a sound like someone
slapping a piece of plastic on the wall. then there was running back
across the stage. by this time ashley had jumped off the stage. none of
us had heard of "ryan" at that time. Another time prior to this
incident, i was on stage and looked up into the lighting area in the
ceiling. in one of the openings i saw a face of a young man approx. 16
yrs old. i went to the only exit of the lighting bay, because i was
supposedly the only one there at the time. i thought it was a classmate
playing a prank on me. i was going to confront him. when i got up in
the lighting area there was nobody there, nor had anybody passed me on
the way down, and there is only one way to and from the bay where i saw
the face. i went clear to the end of the walk way and saw no one
anywhere up there. this is the first time ive told anyone about this
second expirience. the rumors regarding to ryan always being in seat
j&nbsp; -26 is as far as im concerned true i have been in that seat and
felt very cold and uncomfrontable, both feeling left as soon as i left
the seat. also if u look at that seat from the stage, it is highlighted
by a brighter light then anywhere else in the auditorium. i hope other
people have the courage to come forward with their stories after
reading mine. thank you for your wonderful site. i found it very
infomitive.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

Strange Experience<br>
<br>
By: Valerie [vbellefleur@sasktel.net]<br>
<br>
<br>
I was living in the Queen Charlotte Islands in BC Canada.&nbsp; This
particular day I was babysitting a two year old and decided to take a
walk down the gravel road next to my neighbour. I had never been down
this road before.&nbsp; The road ran along the side of the neighbour's
property and ended in a clump of trees and a dead end.&nbsp; As I
approached the end of the neighbour's fenced in yard I saw a small blue
house/shed at the end of the garden behind the fence and wondered who
lived there.&nbsp; The clapboards were a shiny blue as if newly painted
and there were two small windows with flower boxes on the side.&nbsp;
Because the child was tired, I did not venture further to have a look
at the front of the house, but turned and walked home.<br>
I asked my husband who had lived there for twenty eight years, who
lived in the little blue house.&nbsp; He said there was no house and
never had been as long as he had lived there, only a clump of trees and
a dead end.&nbsp; Later that day, we walked down the road together and
sure enough, there was no house, only a clump of trees at the end of
the fence.<br>
This is the first experience I have ever had and still cannot explain
it, but I know what I saw, and was not under the influence of any
stimulant at the time, nor was I hallucinating.<br>
It remains a mystery to me to this day, even though I have moved far away.<br>

Born Again Believer<br>
<br>
<br>
By: adhill77@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
My mother had many years of being terrified by a "presence", she got
educated, and thus passed her knowledge to her children. I know there
are things you just don't poke at. Because of this, I've always
believed in a spirit world. We are well versed in demonology. I've
never had a haunting of any kind.<br>
Now, we used to live in a house in Garland, Tx. From ages 2-4 years, I
had the problem of thinking my mother was calling me. 2-3 times a week,
I'd hear her, and run to her, but she hadn't called. It never happened
after we left that house. .<br>
For many years I was scared of bedtime. I knew something was standing
by my bed. Every night was a struggle. I've been born with a brave soul
and a personality that doesn't like something imposed upon me, so of
course I'd open my eyes and no one was there, I'd check under the bed,
behind furniture, everywhere. But as soon as I'd close my eyes, I'd
have that feeling. I still think it's childhood stuff, but will add it
here because of my mother's trouble from ages 8-18. She had something
much worse intimidate her on a nightly basis. Mine was from ages 5-11
and not as bad as hers.<br>
One night I was on my way home from babysitting. I was 16 and it was
around 3 am. (trust me, I got paid well for staying up that late) I was
dying of thirst. I live out in the country. There's a whole bunch of
nothing. As I was driving by my high school, I thought I could try
getting a Coke out of the machine, from the tiny store next to the
Middle School. I'm always super careful and believe in 'better safe
than sorry' (thanks to my mother) but I talked myself into stopping. I
had a dollar bill and thought if the dollar bill doesn't go in, forget
it. So, no body's around, I get out of my car super fast, leave it
running with the driver's side door open, with all the other doors
locked and try the machine. No sooner was I trying my dollar a second
time when I hear two voices yelling "Run!!!" I froze and thought 'no
way' ,but I heard it again and was suddenly so full of fear, so
overcome with it, I dove into my car, slammed the door and took of down
the street. These two voices had no point of origin. They were male and
female.<br>
One night a few years later, between12am and 12:30am, I was driving
home from work. I live in Texas and we don't get fog to much, but when
we do, it's like pea soup. It was horribly foggy, I could barely see 15
feet in front of my car, I was just hoping some dumb teenager didn't
ram me from behind by accident. I was going about 35 miles an hour and
was driving along an area we call The Bottoms. It's along highway
78.&nbsp; As I'm creeping along, I pass a man. He's standing on the
shoulder, arm out, thumb up. He's about 6 feet tall with a super long
brown beard and he's wearing a trench coat and a hat. I'm trying not to
freak out. I'm eight months pregnant and there's nobody around and I'm
telling my old car "don't you dare break down". It's been 13 years
since I've seen that man, and his image is still burned into my mind.
It could of been someone pulling a prank, but there have been a lot of
people who have drowned in The Bottoms when the river floods, over the
years. A lot, two so far just this year, poor people.<br>
When I was pregnant with my third son, I had a demonic attack while I
was sleeping. It was a dream geared just for me. It was meant to
frighten me. It surely did for a minute, on every level. Every since I
was a kid, I've been able to control my dreams, and be aware of myself
while dreaming. My dream self and knowing I was dreaming. So, I new
'what' was going on, 'what' was in my dream and I was trying to say
Jesus'. I couldn't say it and this thing starts laughing at me. That
wasn't going to fly with me, and Jesus is a bit tougher than that, so I
kept trying and woke myself up saying 'Jesus'. I was flat on my back in
bed, the room was icy cold. I was scared witless, full of fear. My
covers were all on the floor at the foot of the bed. I couldn't move.
For about 3 seconds, I was nuts, then I started to evaluate everything.
I could move, the room was freezing, I couldn't feel this 'thing' in my
room and I told it to stay that way. My physical body was still going
through the motions of being scared, but that's all it was, and I told
myself that. I checked on my kids, they were fine. I called my mom and
asked if Dad could come get me. I told her what happened and that I
just didn't want to mess with it right now. I was tired. I had a car,
but I did not want to drive and have this 'thing' try again, with my
little kids in the car. I told her, "Mom, I can drive over, but I just
don't want to see anything with my physical eyes on the way." I meant
something supernatural and evil. I've never said anything like that
before or after it happened. I went to my parents house, slept like the
tired pregnant woman I was, and moved out of my house 2 weeks later.
Please note, all my life, any property and house my family has lived in
has been prayed over by us, blessed by us, and all the corners of the
property and doors and windows of the house have been anointed with
oil, by us. The house I was in at the time had not been.<br>
In the winter of 2008, on December 4th, I couldn't sleep. I'm a bit of
a night owl, but I was trying really hard to go to sleep and I had to
keep getting out of bed. Someone was in my house. By now, I've got 5
kids and I'm pretty settled. My husband is a twitchy sleepy, but this
night he didn't budge for about 3 hours. I....could.....not....sleep. I
was laying in bed, eyes wide open, feeling 'urged' to get up and check
the house. I had to get out of my bed and check my house. Someone was
in my house. I just new it. For 2 1/2 hours, I was up every 15 minutes,
walking through my house, turning on lights, checking doors, windows,
corners, everywhere. I wasn't scared in the least, but I could feel
someone in the house and I kept looking for this person. It was weird,
it felt weird. The next morning, at 6:45am, my brother calls to tell me
our father had passed away the night before. The first thing I said was
"That's why I couldn't sleep last night." <br>
My Dad was a cornerstone of my life. I loved him on another level of
emotion. It was quit the blow, and still is, to have him gone. I do not
"ask" out loud if that was him, I don't worry about it overly much.
It's been the last weird thing to happen to me. The day after he died,
I heard my brother say the coroner placed his time of death from
11pm-1:30am. I didn't say anything, but I think it was probably closer
to 1:30. <br>

Rhode Island Ghost Haunting in Mapleville<br>
<br>
By: xg_dawg_x225@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
This is a true murder story that happened around the early 1900&#8217;s in the woods of Maureen Cir, Mapleville RHODE ISLAND<br>
This story is a more true and detailed story of the one before that my great grandmother told me about.<br>
Kathryn&nbsp; was a mill owner&#8217;s daughter. She was a very pretty tall
blonde. She was engaged to a local farmer, Robert. Kathryn thought had
one problem. A man who some say had mental issues was stalking Kathryn.
His name was David. David would send Kathryn letters of how much he
loved her and how they could have babies together. These letters
disturbed Kathryn. He would watch her through her window and follow her
wherever she went. One day Kathryn confronted him and told him to never
talk to her again. David thought this was like a game, so he proceeded
to send disturbing letters and watch her at all times. As a few days
went by he gave up. With this, he had a plan. If he couldn&#8217;t love her
no one could. So one day while Kathryn was going to the woods to get
water for her family, David followed. First he stopped at Kathryn&#8217;s
fianc&eacute;e&#8217;s farm. Robert was working on the farm as usual and
David came in from behind and stabbed him in the back with a pitch
fork. Then he went off to find Kathryn. Kathryn was sitting next to a
pond under a hemlock tree. David pulled out his knife and stabbed her
through the neck. She screamed in pain as David ripped open her body.
As she died David raped her dying body. After, he took out her organs,
cut off her breasts, and nailed her heart to a tree. Covered in blood,
David went home and took a nap. He was supposedly awoken by the sound
of dripping. He looked around his room and it was covered in blood. In
the middle of the room Kathryn stood cursing at him. David had gone
insane. He wrote his last letter to the police, telling them what he
did, where her body was, and all that happened. He drowned himself the
next day in a river his body sprawled out on a rock broken. Kathryn and
Robert were buried in a now abandoned cemetery and David&#8217;s body was
thrown into a pit. During a biopsy they found a heart in David&#8217;s
stomach. Some people think he swallowed her heart, some think Kathryn
put it there.<br>

Shadow Person<br>
<br>
By: CamaroGrl3038342@aol.com<br>
<br>
I believe I have had a TRUE experience with a shadow person. This is my
story... It was maybe 11ish at night, my boyfriend and myself were
watching a movie. The lights were dim in the house(the house is more
than 100 y/o). From where I was seated I could see the dining area,
which was dark, and the kitchen doorway, which had a dimmed overhead
light on, and the light was spilling into the dining room. I noticed a
distinct shadow movement in the light from the kitchen, like
someone/thing walked past the light....I turned my head fully towards
the doorway now and saw a solid black elongated ovalish shape towards
the top of the doorway and it quickly slipped into to kitchen....my
immediate reaction was not one of fear, but sort of like...huh, ok...
WTF was that...I wasn't alarmed, I continued watching the movie
thinking of explanations for what I just saw...now let me tell you
there are 3 dogs in the home as well as the 2 of us, my boyfriends 2
dogs were asleep on the floor by our feet, and my dog was by my side on
the couch (he's small) he was acting a bit odd, nervous now, perhaps he
sensed it in me.&nbsp; 30 minutes later he got down and headed toward
the kitchen, he had just got his head in the door and promptly stopped,
I couldn't see his head and shoulders, just his back end. I saw his
neck raise like he was looking up, and then it happened...it took my
breath and gave me chills...he started wagging his tail...slow at 1st
like he was unsure..and then the momentum slowly gained...he never got
to a full on "happy to see you" wag..then he abruptly stopped and came
back to my side...he would not enter the kitchen....and in case you
think maybe he was looking out a window...no..the window is too high up
to see anything.<br>

Personal Experiences<br>
<br>
<br>
By: taiylordawn94@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
My name is Taiylor. My house in AR is believed to be haunted. My dad
told me our house was built over old war bunkers. it was brand new so
no one was killed in the house. Strange things go on. The experiences
are as followed:<br>
- My dad claims to have woken up in the middle of the night and seen a
man in a hooded robe standing beside him and the man has no face. This
has happened numerous times. <br>
- Things will move and turn over and there was no force that could have possibly done it. <br>
- My friend and I were jumping on the trampoline and she stops. She
told me she saw someone and thought it was one of my parents. They were
not up.<br>
- The television has turned on by itself on many occasions.<br>
- My grandmother claimed while spending the night at our house an
orange light flickered on and off. My mom and I came into the room and
the light was unplugged. The strange thing is, we know my grandma
wasn't making this up because she had never been told that the light
bulb was an "orange flicker bulb" and would have no reason to believe
that it would be anything other than a regular light bulb.<br>

Lambertville High School<br>
<br>
By: raspatello@rider.edu <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My name is Guy and I would like to share my experiences at Lambertville
Highschool. I have been there numerous times, I live about 25 minutes
away in PA. My friends and I are ghost hunters and Lambertville is a
favorite spot of ours. The first time I visited the school was about 2
years ago in 2005-2006, and I have been curious about it ever since
then. I have read many comments about history of this amazing site. I
have been through some of the school, not all of it though because the
building is in poor shape. The first time we went we did not encounter
anything out of the ordinary, back then we had no equipment except our
eyes and ears and flashlights. We really didn't venture inside until
the second trip, but that was during the day and also uneventful. The
third trip back to the school was a shocker that still gives me chills
to this day. We went on a summer night, around midnight or maybe a
little later than that, and (not a smart thing to do but we didnt know
any better) we parked the car out in front of the steps leading up to
the school. We were to go in shifts up and into the school, two go and
two stay in the car to watch for cops. We were there for five minutes
before two of my friends came sprinting back to the car screaming,
"DRIVE DRIVE DRIVE!" Me and my friend, who stayed in the car, were
wondering what was literally scaring them to insanity. What they told
us was pretty crazy at first. They said that while they were walking up
the steps to the school they heard the sounds of little children,
(little girls), giggling and laughing. At first I did not believe it
and wanted to go back to experience this for myself. Im the kind of
person that has to see to believe, but its the hope of that proof that
draws me back to this school. Anyway, that incident was about 2 years
ago, and between my friends it has been just a story with no proof. No
proof until now. Last week, May 2008 , me and my friends met up again
(thanks to school being finished) and decided to go back. We went that
night around 10:00 - 10:30 and stayed there for a good hour and
ventured inside. Though we heard no laughing, I am still a believer. I
believe my friends story, and everyone elses stories of little children
laughing because I caught it on tape. I recently purchased some
equipment to help capture paranormal activity and the most valuable
tool I had that night was my recorder. It is amazingly lucky that I
caught anything at all because I only recorded audio for about 7
minutes of our hour long investigation, and all but about a minute of
the audio has voices on it that were not ours. I also caught the voice
of maybe a teacher or student saying, "does he seem ok". And a 2 minute
long conversation with what I believe is a female and male that answers
a question that I ask. I have showed this tape to my family and friends
and they all hear talking as well and the laughter seems to freak
everyone out. I wanted to make sure that what I was hearing was, well,
what I was hearing. When I heard the laughing on the tape, I thought,
my god they werent joking or trying to scare us. They really did hear
something that night, something that I would like to share with your
website if that is alright with you. I just want to know that there is
something other than this life, and that is what draws me to the
paranormal. Thank you for your time, and thank you for reading this. If
you have any comments or questions, please feel free to ask. I would
love to share these clips with you guys, and your viewers.<br>

&nbsp; One night I was staying in my Boyfriends very old creepy house
while he was working a midnight shift&#8230;I worked crazy shifts also and
didn&#8217;t get to see each other very much, so I stayed overnight with just
myself and his dog so that we could spend some time together in the
morning when he came home and when I woke up.&nbsp; His shift was from
11pm to 7am, at around 3am&#8230;I was sleeping, when all of a sudden I heard
his very heavy loud back door swing open, almost as if he were coming
in with his hands full and kicked the door open.&nbsp; The dog was
beside me on the floor and he lifted up his head, crooked his head and
ears in the direction of the back door and gave a little &#8220;woof&#8221;!&nbsp;
This was weird, because he was a very vicious sounding&nbsp; type of
dog when someone was at the door, especially in the middle of the
night.&nbsp; So I sat up and was worried that maybe he had come home
early because he was sick or had hurt himself.&nbsp; So I sat and
waited for about 30 seconds, expecting to hear him taking off his boots
and jacket&#8230;but nothing&#8230;the dog was standing now in the doorway looking
into the kitchen (that&#8217;s where the back door was).&nbsp; So now I&#8217;m
thinking &#8220;what the hell is he doing?&nbsp; Maybe he forgot to plug in
the car and went back outside&#8221;.&nbsp; So I got up expecting the inside
door to wide open and see the screen door&#8230;I crept in and peeked around
the corner and the inside door was closed tight.&nbsp; I had also
forgotten that there was a huge door latch on that door that I had
locked before I went to sleep, so if he were to have come to the back
door&#8230;I would have had to open it for him from the inside.&nbsp;
Everything was locked up tight.&nbsp; I ran to the back window of the
house to see if the car or anything was there&#8230;nothing.&nbsp; So the dog
and I are left standing in the kitchen looking back and forth at each
other and the door.&nbsp; I know he heard it too and I know he was
baffled also.&nbsp; I was freaked out&#8230;needless to say I did not fall
back to sleep that night.&nbsp; So I sat up and waited for him to come
home and told him what happened, then he was freaked out because he
told me that he had heard some pretty weird stuff when he was home
alone a few times but did not tell me because he did not want me to be
scared when I stayed there alone.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; He said he had heard noises coming from the upstairs like some
one was walking and moving things around when he was alone with the dog
by his side.&nbsp; It was not a side by side or an apartment&#8230;so there
was no explanation for hearing such spooky noises on such a regular
basis.&nbsp; He moved shortly after that (not because of the
happenings) and he either picked another spooky house or he has
something following him.&nbsp; When I was there with him and when I was
alone, I always felt like something really negative was there and did
not want me to be there.&nbsp; There was one night when I was lying in
his bed falling asleep then was all of a sudden awoken by a voice that
was in my head ( I didn&#8217;t hear it with my ears) and it was saying to me
kind of matter-of-factly: &#8220;What are you doing here?&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t you
just leave?!&#8221;&nbsp; I passed it off as just dreaming. Then a few weeks
after that he left for a walk to the store with the dog and I was left
alone in the house.&nbsp; I was sitting on the couch trying to watch
TV, but it was like something was almost making it difficult to pay
attention to what was on the TV, because it was making me so
uncomfortable.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t even tell you what it felt like, but I&#8217;ll
try, It was like something was all around me, interrupting my senses
and it was totally negative and&nbsp; wanted to make me
scared.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what happened&#8230;I didn&#8217;t see anything, I
didn&#8217;t hear anything, I didn&#8217;t smell anything&#8230;it was just a really bad
feeling that made me feel bad and scared and almost sick to my stomach
and I had to go outside.&nbsp; I went out side and sat on the steps to
wait&#8230;then thought to myself&#8230;&#8221;what the hell are you doing out here you
wacko, there&#8217;s nothing in there&#8221; So I walked back in and I couldn&#8217;t
even walk through the front porch.&nbsp; So like a dork I sat out on
the front steps waiting for him to return.&nbsp; When he did, he
laughed at me and told me I was crazy and there was nothing in the
house.&nbsp; I reluctantly went back in with him, but ended up leaving
within the hour.&nbsp; I could not stand whatever was in that
house.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; So to this day I don&#8217;t know if he still has something with him,
we broke up not long after that and I have not spoken with him
since.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just glad that it didn&#8217;t come home with me!<br>

Hearthstone Inn, Colorado Springs, CO<br>
<br>
By: earthybeans@msn.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In trying to submit this info to the main site I met with difficulties, so here it is. <br>
This is in reference to your listing for the Hearthstone Inn, Colorado Springs, CO. <br>
This place has much more than a little girl. As a housekeeper there in
1999 I was able to experience almost all of the hauntings. In the South
building, third floor, the little girl would appear regularly as well
as the "Man in Brown" in the main bedroom also on the SW corner of the
floor. He was harmless and would usually disappear as soon as spotted.
On the third floor I never felt alone, would often hear the little
girl, running or laughing. Two of the four bedrooms on that floor share
a bathroom. I learned to prop the door open while cleaning or I would
be locked in. The first time I was locked in I rattled the door and was
screaming for the other housekeeper. I was nearly hysterical when she
let me out after about 5 minutes. <br>
Also in the South building, first floor, there is a bedroom at the end
of the hall that used to be under the stairway. The back stairway of
this building, when it was a hotel, lead outside. Many of our guest
reported having dreams of the woman in this room. I would feel her, but
never saw her. I would have trouble with the lights and an unwelcoming
presence. On one occasion the owner, David Oxenhandler spent the night
in the room. On having a very vivid dream of this woman and dismissing
it as a dream he was too shaken to go back to sleep. When he stepped
outside to have a cigarette he turned around feeling he was not alone,
and actually saw her, dressed just as in the dream floating where the
stairs would have been. Rumor is she was the victim of a lovers quarrel
and was shot on the back stairs. <br>
The last one I knew of was in the North building, second floor. One
room next to the stairs facing East was never pleasant to be in. The
light was very temperamental, flickering and choosing when to be on or
off. I would feel a presence on the floor but really tried to ignore it
until one day I was standing near the stairs with several heavy bundles
of laundry to take downstairs when I felt a pressure on the right side
small of my back, just a little shove and I nearly went head first down
the stairs, and not of my own volition. Last I hear the Oxenhandlers
were doing haunted history tours of their hotel, shortly after it has
been sold to another local organization. Very much worth adding some
info to your site. And thanks for the space!<br>

<br>
I was given a behind-the-scenes tour in the Huntington Gallery (also
known as Henry and Arabella Huntington&#8217;s Home before it was turned into
a museum).&nbsp; In one of the dark storage rooms, there was a strange
coldness and in one of the dark corners, I heard a woman&#8217;s voice go
&#8220;hmmm.&#8221;&nbsp; I looked over in the direction of the sound but it was
too dark to see so I was about to assume I imagined it until I saw the
look on my mom&#8217;s face standing next to me.&nbsp; She said to me:&nbsp;
&#8220;you heard it, too, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;&nbsp; Reports from security guards
stated that the ghost of Arabella can be seen at times during closing
especially in the gallery storage areas.&nbsp; In the former basement
storage area behind Door 11, I heard strange noises and an almost
certain feeling that I was not alone and being watched when I used to
retrieve books for readers.&nbsp; <br>

Cemetery at Night<br>
<br>
By: hellosnypa@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
One night my boyfriend, Jay and I decided to go on a late night bike
ride.&nbsp; We ended up at the cemetery that was near by and began to
roll through, at first it was a little bit spooky because there were no
lights and it was so dark, but at the same time I was not scared and it
was pretty peaceful.&nbsp; As we drove deeper into the middle I began
to smell something I have not smelled before or since.&nbsp; I can only
describe it as dying flowers&#8230;not dead flowers, because they still had a
flower fragrance, but also a scent of decay&#8230;but weirder&#8230;there was
something else in the air but I could not put my finger on it.&nbsp;
The same time that I began to notice the smell in the air, it also
became very dense&#8230;hard to take a breath like I was underwater.&nbsp;
Then I began to feel claustrophobic, like I was in a crowded
elevator&#8230;like there were people all around me, but I did not see
anything except Jason speeding ahead of me and leaving me behind.&nbsp;
The feeling coming from all of this was one of sadness, anger, anxiety,
and I wanted to laugh my head off&#8230;all at the same time!&nbsp; I was
slowly coasting along trying to absorb the experience and what was
happening, and then all of a sudden I hear Jay yelling:&nbsp; &#8220;I see
something!&nbsp; Do you see it, I See something, I&#8217;m serious!&#8221;<br>
Which completely broke me out of my &#8230;trance is the only word that I can
think of to properly describe what I was feeling.&nbsp; Then I became
scared and sped up to him.&nbsp; When I got to him I realized that the
smell was gone, and all of the feelings and beings that swirled around
me seconds before were gone.&nbsp; The tears that were welling up in my
eyes were gone just like that.&nbsp; He thought that he had seen a
figure in the distance&#8230;I didn&#8217;t see it, but after what had just
happened I am willing to believe him.&nbsp; I was afraid, but not as
frightened as he was he wanted to leave and I wanted to stay to see if
what had just happened to me was real and if it would happen again, he
wasn&#8217;t having it and there was no way I was staying all by myself that
late at night.&nbsp; I have been back to that cemetery many times
before that night and since that night&#8230;in the daytime, and never been
overwhelmed with that same feeling ever again.&nbsp; After that day,
it&#8217;s all I could think about for weeks, almost as if I were high from
the experience and wanted to experience it again.&nbsp; Anyways it was
weird and I will never forget it.<br>

Ballinger, Tx and Winters, Tx<br>
<br>
By: s_a_clough@yahoo.com<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi. I read on your website about a place
in Ballinger,Texas, Texas Burger House. I was in there once in 2001
with my family. I took my son, then 4 years old, to the bathroom. As I
was going through the hallway I felt a cold "breeze" or chill. As they
had plastic on the walls, I didn't think anything of it until I was
walking back through. I felt it again in the exact spot. I looked
around and there were no air conditioning vents or windows.I was told a
few months later by my brother-in-law that that restaurant had been on
some ghost-hunting show. Supposedly they filmed a lady in the hallway
where I felt it. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to that place when we were living
in Winters, Tx. At the Dollar General in Winters there is something. I
worked there for a few months, but quit soon after an incident. For a
while things were inexplicably moving from where they were put
previously. This included some big outdoor-type trash cans. When this
would happen, only myself and one other person (manager or assistant
manager) were in the store after closing. One time a shoe box that was
securely on a shelf fell off for no apparent reason. The final straw
for me was one night when my manager and myself were closing the store.
We were walking back to the front after turning off the lights and she
was in front of me. Out of nowhere, on my arm, was what felt like an
ice-cold finger. I screamed and almost ran her over trying to get out.
She still had to finish on the computer and when we tried to turn the
deadbolt, it wouldn't turn until I said, "Let us out of here!" Then the
deadbolt turned. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have told only a few people about this
experience because most people think that stuff like that doesn't
really happen. I have had a few other experiences, but I don't think
that the place itself was haunted, I think that a spirit was following
me. At least that's what someone told me that "deals"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with ghosts regularly told me. I believe
that I am sensitive to the spirit world, but I don't want anything to
do with them. I am writing you to tell you about the places above. Any
advice about dealing with these experiences would be helpful too. Thank
you for your time.<br>

A Day at the Beach<br>
<br>
By: wiccanfaes@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
First off I'd like to say I love your site, <br>
I've been reading the stories for a few years but never posted, then
this morning i remembered something odd that happend to me when I was
about 7 or 8 years old, I used to live in a small town called Ludlow
Massachusetts, and go to a little beach/lake called old orchard beach,
accros the street there is an old cemetary I always wanted to go in and
see the old gravestones, so one day I went in through the gates and
didn't get 10 feet before a swarm of deerflies chased me out, I tried a
few more times to go in but they always chased me out after about 10
feet, I told my older brother Tony about it and he thought I was joking
so he said he'd come with me, we went in through the gates and didn't
get 5 feet and were chased out again, It was just the oddest thing to
have flies chase us out, anyone ever hear of anything like this? I have
more stories but I'll save them for another time.<br>

WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL MY PICTURES?<br>
<br>
By: mizzou_sweetheart@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
In 1999 Grandma,Great Aunt,my kids(Bobby,Jamie,Nikki) and I went to
St.Augustine Flordia. While there I took lots of pictures nearly 7
rolls of film.out of 7 rolls of film, the only ones that that we had
problems with, was the one where we went to the oldest light house in
the usa (The St.Augustine Light).I took pictures before and after those
picture, and the camera worked fine. While there I took a whole roll of
film when I got home and went to develope them, most of them that came
out was pictures where you could see the tops and bottoms of the
pictures clearly but thru the middle was nothing but light. .At the
time I knew nothing about taking pictures of ghost or that you could I
sometimes often wonder . Looking at some of the ghost pics I have seen,
it looked like a smokey light ya see in some of them. Now it makes me
wish I would have kept them instead of throwing them away!&nbsp; I
someday want to go back and try again to get pictures of that light
house and see if it happens again!<br>

Weirdest Trip<br>
<br>
By: Mbkljkcjk@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Me and my family were visiting my uncle and cousin in NJ and I was
exited to see them again (we live in Florida). My first day was really
cool. But when night came, it was a whole other story. I heard weird
screeching noises and my heart was pounding. I went to turn on the
light but was stopped by what looked like a man in a shadow figure. I
could still see him even though he was pitch black and so was the room.
I turned on the light and the room had no other people in it. I turned
off the light and right after that, people filled the room. They were
all whispering about something but I couldn't hear them. I was scared
but tried to ignore them and closed my eyes in bed. But I felt someone
sit on the bed and I looked and I saw my dead grandfather, Stanley. He
has been dead for about 10 years or so. He was telling me to tell my
mum that he loves her and was sorry for an accident that happened
between them. I said "Why talk to me now when you could have done it at
home?" He said he was buried under this house. Then he said I love you
and I said I love you back and he disappeared. That morning I woke up,
I had a beautiful charm bracelet on that I never owned or had on the
night before. It was my best friend that died 4 years ago. She was
buried with it. I did a history on the house and found out that it was
built over a cemetery 8 years ago. My uncle asked me to move something
to the basement, the room of a house I am really scared of. I did it
any way and saw children playing. They apparently saw me to because
they said "Come play with us Camille!" I dropped the box and I ran out.
I talked to my mum about Stanley and the incident and it turns out that
when she was young, he was drunk and said "I will push you down these
steps!" My mum grabbed him and said "Then I'll take you with me!!" I
told her everything and she actually belived me. Not long after, my
uncle moved and I went back home. But I had all my spiritual friends
with. All of which are now my guardian angels.<br>

The Orb<br>
<br>
By: shdwdmn08@peoplepc.com<br>
<br>
It was the late 80's when one night me and some friends decided to go
into the Mesa cemetary, that place alone in the evening can be quite
frightening.&nbsp; Even during the day it is a little creepy.&nbsp; It
has rows and rows of large arbovitae trees, extremely tall.&nbsp; So we
drove there in my friends parents van.&nbsp; And after a short moment
we had received quite a fright. Even my father in his youth had some
frightening moments in that cemetary.&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp; we were
walking among the rows of trees.<br>
When three or four rows of trees to our right.(the cemetary goes from east to west and we were walking southward.)<br>
We all observed a light among that row of trees.&nbsp; So we stood
there and watched it for a little bit.&nbsp; It was about the size of a
basketball.&nbsp; One of my friends said it must be night security with
a flashlight.&nbsp; And all I could think too myself was yeah
right.&nbsp; I watched it, like I said it was about the size of a
basketball.&nbsp; It was moving north at a slow steady pace.&nbsp; Not
like someone walking with a flashlight in their hand.&nbsp; And aside
from that there was no beam coming off of it, it was just a round
light.&nbsp; <br>
But of course we panicked and ran out of there.&nbsp; With them
insisting that it was security.&nbsp; But I know it wasn't,&nbsp; It
was something.&nbsp; I don't know what, it still haunts me till this
day.<br>

Strange Experience<br>
<br>
By: skirby@cchra.com <br>
<br>
I don't know that this would interest anyone, but I have had a very strange happening to me 3 years ago.<br>
I lost my mother on May 5th 2005. I was very distrait over this for
quite a while. I was with her when she passed and it was something I
really didn't want to do. I used to and still do walk around thinking
she can still hear me and I can talk to her. I just can't believe that
when the phone rings, it isn't her calling me Sissy. I miss her so much.<br>
Well back to the incident in question. I don't think the house we were
renting and living in at the time is haunted by any means. But one
night around 9pm when I was all alone. I was sitting in my recliner
watching Biography on the television. It was on Ryan O'Neal. Well all
was fine until they were showing clips from Love Story and they were
playing the theme from Love Story. Then a commercial came on and I
continued to hear the theme song playing from somewhere in my house. It
almost scared me to death because I didn't know where it was coming
from and I was afraid to move. Well I decided to get up and try to find
where this music was coming from. I went out to the kitchen and I heard
much louder there and when I looked up on top of my hutch I saw a three
draw oriental jewelry box that my mother had givin to me years ago and
I just put it up on top of the hutch. The bottom drawer was open and I
discovered that it was a music box that when the bottom drawer was
opened it played the theme from Love Story. I just smiled and took it
down from the hutch and cried thinking it was my mother trying to tell
me she still loves me and she if okay. I just found it very suspicious
that all of a sudden that music box would start playing at that
particular time when I never touched it before and never recall of it
being a music box or playing that Love Story theme.<br>
I just wanted to pass this on to someone. Thanks for listening. I still
give me a chill when I think of it, but also a warm feeling.<br>

Rancho Cucamonga Personal Experience<br>
<br>
By: redelfvamp6@hotmail.com <br>
<br>
My wife and I have had several experiences in our apartment over the
last three years we have lived here. It began with hearing noises and
creeks in the building early on and slowly evolved to seeing shadows in
the middle of the night in our bedroom. We both have had experiences
where we've thought to have seen a little boy in blue pajamas looking
at things in our bedroom. Three major events have occured which I will
describe in detail.<br>
Event one: Summer 2006<br>
My brother was staying over because he is a minor and our mother was
going out of town. We had woken up late to eat breakfast and were
playing a game of cards. As we are brothers and there is a significant
age gap, we sometimes argue. I was being a little bit of a jerk,
picking on a card selection he had made, when our kitchen trashcan
started to rock back and forth. We were the only people present in the
apartment and were about 10 yards from the trashcan. I investigated the
trashcan further to find that it was nearly empty and there was nothing
that could have moved it. So we went to the park.<br>
Event two: Winter 2007<br>
My wife and I were growing fascinated with the television show Ghost
Hunters. We had spent an entire day watching episodes from the second
season dvd. Being cocky and joking with my wife over her growing
discomfort with the mood the show was setting, I began joking about
taking on the ghosts of the apartment. Saying things such as "If anyone
is here come and get me!" or "You can't touch me, your just a ghost! I
don't even believe in you!". Later that night at four a.m. I woke up
quite distressed and felt that the apartment was shaking from a
significant earthquake. I was sure that it was "the big one" and rushed
to jump out of bed and pull my wife to safety in a doorway. She was in
a state of shock as I lifted her out of bed and was scared of an
earthquake also. When we finally got to the doorway and calmed down I
explained to her that I thought there was a earthqauke but couldn't
feel it anymore, she couldn't either. I began to grow very nauscious
and leaned on her for support. I told her I wasn't feeling right and I
blacked out. As I was blacked out I heard sounds of people talking very
quickly. At first I thought it was my wife and I tried to tell her to
slow down. I felt the sensation of running very quickly while I was
hearing the rapid dialogue. I was growing angry when suddenly I awoke
lying on the floor with my wife over me. She told me how she thought I
was having a seizure or something because all of my mussels had
tightened and I was screaming/moaning in a sense of fear. She said that
I had also grown pale. All throughout that night I felt the bed
continued to shake.<br>
Event Three: Soon after event two<br>
I was angered by the experience I had felt earlier in event two where I
had awoken to what I thought to be an eaerthquake and experienced what
I thought to be a form of being possessed. I researched how to hold a
siance to converse with spirits present within the room and invited
friends over to help with the conversation. I did not describe the
experience I had felt earlier so that it would not affect my friends'
experiences that night. In the middle of the siance one of my friends
began to grow woozy and sway forward when he suddenly stopped it. He
said that he couldn't go on and felt like someone was talking quickly
to him and he had the sensation of running. Identitical to my
experience earlier. I shared with him my experience and we decided to
not continue. Also this night my friends car got a flat tire while
parked at my apartment, and only needed to be refilled with air as
there was no puncture to cause the flat, as if someone deflated it.
Also another friend was called by his girlfriend within minutes of us
ending the siance because she felt something had happened and was
worried, he had only told her he was going to see me and not anything
about what we were doing that night. The friend with the flat had also
recieved a phone call from his aunt abpout an hour after, whome he
speaks with rarely, because she had similar concerns as my friends
girlfriend. How's that for womens' intuition?!<br>
Ever since the last event, nothing else has occured.<br>

Pickwick apartments, Taylor MI<br>
<br>
By: shilomandgoodnight@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
I lived here for about three years during which time I seen and heard
some strange things.&nbsp; I had a white cat at the time and one night
as I was headed to bed I seen him laying in front of my son's door, his
paws swatting underneath it.&nbsp; I went to shoo him gently with my
foot, but he wasn't there at all.&nbsp; This really freaked me
out.&nbsp; Other times, late at night when everyone was in bed and all
was quiet, this same cat of mine would sometimes freak out.&nbsp; Once
I was sitting in the living room reading with him next to me and he
started going crazy, jumping up and off the wall next to me as if he
saw something.&nbsp; I didn't see anything but it was unlike him to act
this way at all and he clearly seemed distressed.&nbsp; <br>
Also the apartment next to me was stranger still.&nbsp; No one ever
seemed to live there for more than a few months, at least 5 residents
had come and gone in the 3 years I was there.&nbsp; Whoever lived there
at any time always argued, more so than most.&nbsp; Several times I sat
freaked out enough wondering whether to call the police or not, but
nothing ever seemed to violent and I minded my own business.&nbsp;
There was always a lot of fighting with whoever moved into that
apartment though and they never stayed for long.&nbsp; Also twice, for
two different residents (different people staying there and at
different times) ambulances were there taking someone out, but I'm not
sure what happened.&nbsp; There was definitly something off about that
place.<br>

Personal Experience in South Lyon<br>
<br>
By: wicket091179@gmail.com <br>
<br>
This is a personal experience that still to this day has left me
shaken. There is something wrong with this apartment complex. My
experiences centered on the apartment we were in but from other
residents I heard other tales that made me really not want to live
there and as soon as I could get out my husband and I did.<br>
&nbsp;Pontrail Apartments located in South Lyon. there is a huge tree
right directly infront of it. Aparitions have been seen in the little
hallway between bathroom and bedroom. The panel in the hallway leading
up to the crawl space has moved on its own(personal experience). Was
actually in the bathtub and the only one home when it happened. I am
all of 5 ft and that ceiling is a good 8ft there was no way for me to
get up there. We figured that the only way to move that panel was to be
up in the crawl space. Each crawl space is self contained. Evp's have
been gotten in that apartment of a young woman with an accent saying
"Can't stay to long" and "Sleep"(both still have). If you leave the
bathroom door open while taking a shower, you get this feeling that you
are being watched, then look out you see the retreating figure of what
looks to be a young woman. I had this happen and thought I had left my
apartment door open and it was a neighbhor and upon investigation found
my door deadbolt was locked. Numerous pictures of orbs and odd shadows
have been captured in this apartment(all still have). Late at night you
can also hear someone walking past the apartment and when you go to
look there is no one on the walkway. And considering where the
apartment is there is no way for someone to get down it quick enough
without hearing the sound of running feet. Have had an experience of
having the front door hit several times while eye was to peep hole and
no one was there. Stories were also told to me of the Laundry room in
same building is also a place of odd occurances. Feelings of being
watched, and hearing a young womans voice.&nbsp; Have felt the being
watched part. But considering that the old furnace system is right
there in the laundry room dismissed it. A lot of my family and husbands
family refused to spend the night there just cause the place gave them
the creeps, and this was prior to even some of these events
happening.&nbsp; I have tried to find out if there had been deaths or
murders or anything on that ground and I came up with nothing. All I
know is that that place was just...there was something wrong with it
and I wish I had never moved in it.<br>
The EVP's were caught when that building had few residents. I still
have them just to have others listen to from time to time to prove I
wasnt crazy with what I heard. The pictures are numerous and some still
make the hair on my arms stand up cause of the experiences with them.<br>

My Fathers Story<br>
<br>

My Father had told my this story, and i know it's true because that house has this weird creepy feeling to it.<br>
When he was 3 his father died and his mom had got remarried, of course
they moved to another town, to get away from old memories. One night,
his step father and mother were gone and his sisters called him into
their room. He went to see what they were doing. They told him to put
his ear to the vent, and he did, but what he heard was not normal. The
sound was of chairs moving and about 7 or 8 people talking. Of course,
them being kids they went down to see. But it was pitch black and no
one was home.<br>
