<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>this story
starts a long time ago when I was about 8 or 9. I was watching TV when I looked
up and I saw a man watching me. he had a blue coat on. he smiled at me and
faded away. I did not feel alarmed in any way. I told my parents and they
believed me completely. every time I was by myself or scared or sad he was
there and he sit by me and his presence would make me feel better. then one day
he just disappeared. when I was 12 he appeared again. I was home alone and
cleaning the kitchen. we had one of those musical globe things that played
music only if<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>u turned the key thats
under it. all of the sudden it went off and we had not messed with it in years.
I had put a bunch of napkins in the stove by the burners heard a voice in my
head say stove. I looked at the stove and it was on. I feel chills run up my
spine when I think about what could of happened. I guess the blue man was still
there all along, still watching over me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>In the winter of
2001, we had come home from partying all night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Yes, we were pretty wasted when this happened-AND that is why we just
&quot;forgot&quot; or never talked about this after that night.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I fell into bed and passed out
immediately.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My husband brushed his
teeth, turned off the dining room light and shut our door to the dining
room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He climbed into bed and drifted to
sleep for about 5 minutes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All of a
sudden, we both opened our eyes and the bedroom door was open and the dining
room light was on dim.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(It was the kind
of light that had a dimmer, you had to push it in to turn it on and off-AND it
was on high when turned off).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We looked
at each other-kind've read each other's minds and dismissed it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Had to be the partying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>About a month
later-I was sleeping on the couch with my head on my husband's lap.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All of a sudden he got up and ran for a knife
in the kitchen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He said he saw a man
walking in the back part of the kitchen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He was terrified.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(Don't ask me
why he would run towards it-I would be out the door-but that's me).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was shaken up for quite a while.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No partying this time-He SWORE he saw a man
out of the corner of his eye. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I told him
he was nuts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>About a week
after that in the middle of the afternoon February) he was home listening to
the TV. playing loud from the living room while typing a paper in the computer
room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He said that he heard a loud slam.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Walked out and our bedroom door (which is
hung up on a throw rug) was shut.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All
the windows were closed as it is cold as the North Pole in February in central
N.Y.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was at work when he called-He was
really worked up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had never heard him
like that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was when we really
became suspicious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I called our
landlord and told her not to think I was nuts, but did anyone ever die in that
house?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She told me that he husband's
grandfather did back in the early 1930's of throat cancer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She wanted to know why I was asking.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I told her what had happened.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She then said that she thought they had taken
care of &quot;that problem&quot;.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She
told us that the last tenants moved out suddenly after seeing the apparition of
a man in his 60's sitting at the kitchen table reading.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She told me that they had a Catholic Mass to
help &quot;Frank&quot; move on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>He must have
really loved his house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The downstairs
tenants-after Psycho Maria moved out also had experiences, but I promised a
short story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>We moved to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Syracuse</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'> almost 3 years ago.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn't want to live in a house where
someone died.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I actually made a point of
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My very good friend told me the
first time she walked in this house that she felt as though we weren't alone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I told her that was impossible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>A couple months
after my son, Peyton, was born, (September 2003)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was sitting downstairs typing on the
computer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had the video monitor
on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I heard this strange, muffled,
non-English, whispering.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I turned to
look at the monitor and his mobile was gently moving.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(He was too little to reach it and again no
windows open, no air on)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I ran upstairs
and his mobile was still and no noise.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>My husband was gone on business, AND no one died in this house, so I
assumed that I must have been seeing things.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Then there was
the picture of my son, Peyton-which I sent a copy.<span

2003.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My 7 year old

his room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was wearing jeans and an
orange shirt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He said that the boy
looked at him, then walked through his bedroom door.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Lastly, the top

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Hello, I am 14
years old. Even though I may be a teenager and some may not believe me please
listen to my experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>When I was young
I was not scared of ghosts nor didnt really<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>believe in their presence but slightly. One day I went to a Japanese
shrine with my parents in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Japan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>. This shrine was close to my mothers
house she grew up in. I was very attached to my mother, I was all just seven or
eight. I was a crazy little child. Soon it was time to leave, as a Japanese
tradition I threw in 10 yen my mother gave me to throw in and make a wish.
Because I was really attached to my mother I could sometimes feel the sadness
of how much she missed her parents. Since I really didnt now me real father, I
cared allot more about my mother than anyone in the world. I threw the coin in
and made a wish, I wished I could once meet my grandmother. I had heard many
stories of her from my mother so that was why I was so anxious to meet
her...but the only thing was that she had past away when my mother was around
21. After I made a wish I saw a box with a whole bunch of paper in it...I ran
over to my step dad and anxiously asked what it was. He told me it gives you
wisdom to your wish. So, as an whiny little child I begged my step father to
get me one, so gave me money and I put it in the little slot. I slowly put my
small hand in and grabbed a piece of paper...To my surprise it really did give
me wisdom to my wish. I remember exactly what it said.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>'If you wait nothing will appear..but when
you at least expect it you will see' As a small child I shrugged it off and
went on with my life. About two weeks later I returned from my 2nd country (I
am a half) I went to the washroom in the middle of the night...Normally my
wishes never come true...but I was in for a big surprise...There I saw an old
lady who looked exactly like my grandmother in the picture my mom had stood
there! She was smiling at me, she had a long white dress and she was all white.
Well obviously since I was small I ran at a speed that could make me the
fastest person alive(or at least it felt like it). I didnt have to go to the
washroom after that but thats when it all started.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>After that I
have been having strange experiences I have seen my future self twice! Once in
gr.4 and the other I forget. In grade 4 I innocently walked to the washroom I
saw about a 12 to 13 year old of myself...I told my mother but she said it was
probably my imagination. many years passed and many odd experiences had gone
by. I had moved during those years to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Japan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'> and back. This time I was in a different
building. I was in sixth grade. It was about </span><st1:time Minute="30"
Hour="23"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>11:30 pm</span></st1:time><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>, I<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>went to the bathroom and washed my hands, I had grown up a bit. I opened
the door to only see a younger me...it looked as if I was in grade four! She
was staring at me and I was so freaked out I stood there in shock unable to
move. The only thing was...I was able to stare my younger self in the eye.
Finally I had the guts to run off...but instead like always closing the door
after my self, I left the door open for the younger me. I couldnt help notice
that the younger me was wearing normal clothing...than it hit me!...When I saw
an young women, my grandmother, the VERY old version of me they were all
wearing a white dress....that must of represented that they had died. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Just last year I
saw my step dad's grandmother (who is healthy and alive) staring at my picture
of when I was young exactly like she was when she visited from </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Japan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>. Exact posture and everything...I
thought I was dreaming and pinched my self many times and tried lying back into
my regular posture and sitting back up to see if she was still there. After 5
minutes of doing this she was gone! Next morning I told my weird experience to
my mother, at the EXACT TIME she was thinking of her. My mom told me this
'Maybe you see some of my thoughts...tell me some experiences you've had from
the past'...I told her one of the experiences like how I saw a young women and
described how she looked. My mom stared at me with shock. That description fit
exactly her best friends friend who committed suicide...in fact couple months
ago I saw a faceless figure standing over my bed watching me. earlier that day
my mom was imagining that and thinking how to see that it would be unpleasantly
scary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Last but not
least at camp I had this scary feeling inside myself...I had never been so
scared for such a small thing I knew that was fake. I fell asleep that night
having a dream that was extremely mysterious. I was playing capture the flag
with everyone at camp. I wanted go to the other side but I saw a very pretty
girl my age. She had a ponytail, beautiful skin, hazel eyes, a fit body and she
was wearing red clothing. She was blocking my way so I decided I should run
past her. I tried but she was after me so I decided to run back to my side. I
ran as fast as I could and finally got to my side. She was on her side but
slowly came in to my side...all the sudden everyone was gone...It was only me
and her. She was starting to feel evil presence...I was scared she ran after me
and finally I could not run anymore. I couldnt walk I was too scared. Than
right when she got in front of me her smile was not a good smile...She gave me
an extremely evil smile...I didnt feel good...I couldnt move! Than right
before something was going to happen she started fading, than only her hazel
eyes were left except those pair of eyes was brownish white. They were staring
at me. Just staring. I woke up shock and was scared so much. Ive never
experienced such an evil dream. Than I turned to see right beside me the girl
from my dream fading...fading and just watching me...than her eyes disappeared.
I woke up and told my cabin buddy (who I was really great friends with) I told
her what happened and she happened to live in the area...she told me about a
girl who had gone missing a while ago...the description fit her....A few weeks
after camp ended my friend sent me the newspaper about her missing, I saw her
picture...It was her...was she telling me something? I dont know but do you
think she was?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>What caused me
to see all these things....I believe it was the shrine I visited in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Japan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'> and it started there. I am extremely
scared in ghosts now...I sometimes consider go g to the same shrine wishing I
wont see a ghost again!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>After I
graduated high school me my father, brother and sister move in with my aunt and
3 cousins into a big apartment in a small town in MA. Our downstairs neighbors
at the time were Hispanic. Odd things would seem to happen throughout the
apartment. You would be watching TV and all of a sudden it would switch over to
the Spanish channel by itself. Rooms would get cold all of a sudden. One day
was very windy and we were gathered around the kitchen table playing cards. We
hear someone stomping up the stairs and the door is opened ( the wind was
blowing, but the door opened against the wind). and slammed shut. The door to
the living slammed shut, the door to the hallway opened and slammed, footsteps
were heard going upstairs, a door slammed and a TV was turned on, to the
Spanish channel and turned up loud. My 2 year old niece was in the living room
and runs into the kitchen crying hysterically. Later when our neighbors get
home we tell them what just happened. It is then we find out that they used to
rent our apartment and they had a brother die. In their culture they place the
body in the room of the house they enjoyed the most and have the wake there.
His favorite room was our living room. When he got mad he would stomp up the
stairs, slamming doors and would crank up the volume in his TV. We never saw
him but knew when he was around, he became like apart of our family. When I
moved into the apartment next door he would come and change the channels on the
TV. I think it was his way of saying hi and &quot;keeping in touch&quot;. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>On a side note
my niece when she was 3 lived in the apartment below me and I was downstairs
one night. All of a sudden she lets out a scream we all run in to see what is
wrong and she says someone looked in the window and was staring at her. My
cousin and I go out to investigate but find no one, it had been raining and
there were no footprints in the mud. As her mother is carrying her to bed she
passes a photo montage of our family and points to a photo and says that is who
was at the window. She is pointing to a photo of her great-great grandmother,
who she was named after, who had been dead almost 10 years at that point.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Ok, I'm 18 now.
When I was like 12-14, I was at a funeral reception at a family friends house.
At first people were eating and talking and what not, but then they had some
prayer thing in the middle. My Grandma has Parkinsons disease, and my mom
asked me if I could just sit with her and my Grandpa in the dining room while
they had the prayer thing in the den. Well, I was kind of bored the whole time
this was going on, and I was chilling staring off into space. In the corner of
my eye, I saw movement, so I looked over at the front door. I can still see it
in my head what I saw, a mid-older aged man with gray hair wearing a blue polo
shirt. His image wasnt 100% clear because the glass on the door was French, so
it wasnt very smooth. I didn't think anything at that time because it looked
like a normal guy just about to open the door and come in. Well, the door
opened at a normal speed, and when it was fully open, they guy was totally
gone. I was totally confused, and 5-10 seconds later, my grandpa asked me to
close the door because it was cold outside. So I got up, walked a few steps
outside, looked down their way long driveway (thought I might see someone
walking or running away), no one was there so I just turned around, went back
inside and continued my evening.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was
not until the next few days that it hit me that I might have seen a ghost. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I'm still trying
to figure out what the hell this was. &quot;Even if I didn't see
something&quot; the door opened like 4 seconds after I saw the thing, so it
would have been very coincidental that the door would have randomly opened like
that. I'm 100% sure I saw something, and I'm not crazy. Every time I have been
back at that house since, I always forget what I want to do, ask the lady for a
picture of her dad. See if I recognize his face at all, see if he had gray
hair, and even see if he liked to wear polo shirts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I have been at
my current job now for about 5 months, and while I hadn't seen anything until
recently, I always felt watched...especially at night when I have to go back to
do payroll.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>It started
getting lively recently with the ghosts that are there bugging the night
auditor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She says she can feel them
watching her and that they make little whisperings to let her know that they
are there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But night time is not the
only time that they play with us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I
do mean play.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seems that they love
the CD Player at front desk and had turned it on one afternoon....and the
volume was turned way up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The two girls
who were working front desk were both spooked a little, but not too terribly.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They both thought that one of them could have
bumped it and made it come on, but even the taller of them could not reach it
with any part of her body that would have allowed this....and it did not
explain the volume at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I listen to
these stories and get a little spooked, but we all just figure that the ghost
just want to be noticed, and like CD's (played loudly).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Well, other then
the feeling of being watched at night and being completely creeped out at
night, I had not seen anything.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not
until yesterday at lunch.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was
about 20 of us in the lunchroom.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most of
us were finished eating and just waiting on others, so that we could go outside
and visit for the rest of our lunch break.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As we were sitting there talking, a large framed saying/picture about
diversity that hangs between the restroom doors just fell off the wall.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The girl to the right of me jumped up and
said &quot;It's time to go!!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am not
playing with ghosts!&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was right
behind her along with the girl who was on my left.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The girl who sat across from me went to the
&quot;picture&quot; and picked it up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There had been no reason for it to fall, no one had been anywhere near
it, but fall it did.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She picked it up
and set it on our table.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most everyone
in the lunchroom cleared out after that...Guess we had spent too much time in
there for the ghosts comfort.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'll send
more stories as they happen, but this one is a little amusing considering that
the only time any of us were seriously spooked, there was about 20 of us
present.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I have

</span>I awoke (lying on my back) and could not move. I noticed that my dog was
looking at me and shaking. He jumped up onto the bed and I could not grab him
(he was not allowed on the beds), but I could only move my eyes. He looked
horrified and ran along the side of the bed, up toward my face.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I could not speak or move when suddenly, as I
fought this, I was released and flung toward my dog. He had gone to the
bathroom on my bed and was cowering and shaking. He was terrified, and so was
I. The second incident happened at my Mother's house. I awoke and tried to ask
my husband why he was looking into my face when I realized that I could not
move. My eyes rolled from right to left and I noticed my husband sound asleep.
I tried to cry out and move but this did not happen for what seemed minutes. My
Mother said that recently, she felt uneasy in the room. I have had many, many
ghostly experiences but these were the only ones involving sleep paralysis<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>just found your

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>you. Several
years ago, I lived in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style='font-family:

style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>. a very small town (basically<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>a post office
and a crossroads) located in Mathews county at the end of SR<o:p></o:p></span></p>

years ago (his family is buried there in a small cemetery in<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the woods about
100 yards from the house). Anyway, every day while my sister<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and I were at
school, at </span><st1:time Minute="0" Hour="9"><span style='font-family:Arial;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>violently for a
minute and then stopped. The dining room was a relatively<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>recent addition
to the house connecting the main house and kitchen, which<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>was at one point
a separate building to keep fires isolated. My mother was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the witness to
the shaking and some light orb activity, and I was privy to<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>some spine
chilling experiences in the former servant's quarters above the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had made into a playroom. I literally had to sit with my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>back to the wall
to feel any kind of comfortable, otherwise you got the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>feeling of
someone standing over you the whole time. A friend of mine<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>experienced the
same thing when he was visiting once. The haunting was never<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>anything
menacing, but enough to let you know someone was there watching.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Quite
disturbing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>There were
several other locations in the nearby wharfs and beaches that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>When I was a
child, I lived in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style='font-family:Arial;
  color:white'>Covington</span></st1:City><span style='font-family:Arial;
 color:white'>, </span><st1:State><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Kentucky</span></st1:State></st1:place><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This was the home of my grandparents and our family.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My father helped renovate the house and when
I was about 4, we moved to the second floor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>At night, I would occasionally see the face of a man peering through the
second story window into the room where we slept.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was bright green and terribly disfigured
and appeared to be in pain or trying to yell to get my attention.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was no place for a person to stand to
peer through the window.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since my father
used to tease me about the boogie man, I always thought that this apparition
was just a figment of my imagination.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There was a closet attached to this room that I never entered as it
seemed spooky to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>We moved from
that house when I was about 9 years old.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I later moved into that house again as a young married woman and was
always afraid to go in that room where I had seen the face.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I just used the room as a storage space.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At that time, I did not think anything more
about my fear.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Several years after
that, my brother and his wife and children lived in the same suite on the
second floor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My oldest daughter, who
was probably 7-8 at the time, spent the night with her aunt, uncle and
cousins.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The next morning, she told me
that she had seen this frightening green face in the bedroom window.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For the first time, I connected her sighting
with what I had seen as a child.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I asked
her not to say anything to her brother and sister who were going to spend the
next night with my brothers family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Sure enough, the
next day my two other children reported seeing a green ghost.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This time, the ghost appeared full bodied in
another room of the house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He seemed to
be trying to communicate with them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
children said that he appeared to be dressed in very old clothes or perhaps had
a blanket wrapped around him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He seemed
to be very angry. I learned years later that my youngest daughter had asked my
brother about the apparition and that my brother had said oh, that is just the
ghost that lives here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Unfortunately, I
never got to ask my brother about it, as I moved to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'> and he died young at age 43.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I did not think it was an appropriate thing
to ask him on his death bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>We have one
other sister who says that she felt a presence in the house but never saw the
apparition.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She believes that the person
was not a kind or good person while alive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Our parents and grandparents who lived in the house have all passed
away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have always wondered who this
person was.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>I have tried to find
information about the location on the internet but to no avail.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our other sister was only a baby when we
moved from that house and I dont believe ever experienced anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Someday I may
ask a cousin if he ever encountered the ghost.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The house was very old and creaked at night.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One time I remember waking and that the medal
of the blessed mother that I always wore around my neck was missing  chain and
all.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I never found the medal or chain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>First of all, I
have always believed in God and the inevitability of something bigger than us
being &quot;out there&quot;. Many people are brought up in church believing in
the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, but the majority of parents teach their
children that there are no such things as ghosts. What obvious irony. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I am 28, married
and a mother of one son.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have had no
instances, even possible encounters, since I was a kid.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I grew up in </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>SW Oklahoma</span></st1:place><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'> where the land was once part of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>, and so the red dirt, plateau-spotted,
mesquite-covered land blends well into the typical </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>West Texas</span></st1:place><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'> landscape.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am of some Cherokee heritage myself and
love to hear the local Indian stories and legends, not to mention the cowboy,
horse thief, and general old mid-western legends that come with the
territory.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I love that area more than
any place. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Enough
background info.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have 3 interesting
stories. Two of which are my own and one of which is my older cousin's (he has
several), and I actually think his is the best one, but mine are altogether
unexplainable as well, and none are very long.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So, here goes... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My first story
happened to my oldest cousin and some of his friends only about 6 years ago
(1998) on our family's ranch. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The Rhythm of
the Fog<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>First of all, my
cousin will be 36, and he is a married father of two.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He and I are alike in that we appreciate the
land and those that came before us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our
mothers are sisters and they grew up along with our uncle in </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>SW Oklahoma</span></st1:place><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'> as well, just about 20 miles NE of my
hometown.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our grandparents grew up on
farms there, and so just before they married in 1949, our grandpa bought a
ranch where he raised wheat and cattle and even had horses for a while. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>This ranch is
beautiful, about 2100 acres total, but about 1000 acres of it is made up by the
mountain on it (there is actually a smaller mountain by the bull pen, but it is
fairly small although you can look out over my mother's hometown from the top
looking North) in Kiowa County.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>SW Oklahoma</span></st1:place><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>, there are mountains--the </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Wichita</span></st1:PlaceName><span
 style='font-family:Arial;color:white'> </span><st1:PlaceType><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Mt.</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'> range.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>These are supposedly one of the oldest mountain ranges in the world and
are said to have once been as high as the </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Rocky Mountains</span></st1:place><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>. Anyway, the view is breathtaking from
the top. There is so much to describe, but as far as the mountain in this
story, it is called Flat Top.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
literally is flat on the top, with natural springs on it, some mesquite trees
and lots of granite boulders, as well as Rattlesnakes (of which all my family
has had very real encounters, but those are altogether different stories).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It takes 1-2 hours to climb, but it is worth
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Facing south, you look out over
Devil's Canyon off the back of the mountain, and there is one natural spring on
the very top. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Anyway, my
cousin goes up there as much as possible. He brings friends who are willing to
camp up there. He has cooking utensils and a storage place for some things up
there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He has gone by himself before,
saying that it is very spiritual, and it is.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>According to his research, the land was sacred Indian land, apparently
Kiowa. (Mind you, he is a very faithful Christian, and he and his wife are
active in there church and teach Sunday school.)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I will have to say that he is a unique one,
though, and he was very much wild when he was younger and up until he got
married.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Importantly, my cousin has
always played the drums and plays in bands. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>On one
particular summer evening, he and a small group of friends had settled around a
campfire on Flat Top.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My cousin brought
his old bongo drums which he had since he was a kid (they are two drums connected
by wooden base) since they were easy to carry in his backpack. He said the
night was perfectly clear with the stars so close, seemingly, and yet only the
light of the campfire was glowing (I can't remember if he said the moon was out
or just partial, but it was clear).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>As
he got a rhythm on the drums, he said everyone saw this fog began to rise out
of nowhere.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He didn't think much about
it at first, but continued to play. Then, he said the fog was very thick and
suddenly began to clearly form into the shapes of Indians, as if they were
coming to life in the fog to the rhythm of the drums.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everyone was becoming shocked and my cousin
didn't think this was right, so he quit playing, and the fog slowly dissipated
into nothing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>He said no one
really talked much about it because they were already freaked out as it was, so
they accepted it and that it was gone then, and then they left in the morning. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My cousin is
very grounded in his faith and chose to stop whatever began, and who knows what
would have happened had they not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My two personal
stories happened around the same time, though, I can't remember exactly when,
just that I was about 10 or 11(1986-87), so about One is possible ghost, the
other is, if anything, UFO. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>UFO?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I was at my best
friend's home in the country (mind you, my hometown is rural and you don't have
to go very far, maybe 2 miles, to be &quot;in the country&quot;).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anyway, she lived on a Rural Route address NE
of town, and no homes were near except for the partial underground home about 1
or 2 miles further East down their dirt road.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I had been to her house &quot;millions&quot; of times by then, during
the day, staying the night, etc.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
was a sleepover and it was summer time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Her parents were in the process of closing in their back porch with brick
and windows, but hadn't yet put the glass or back door on yet.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had lawn chairs to sleep on the porch for
fun, but since it was summer and warm, we were allowed to stay up and so we
temporarily moved the lounging lawn chairs out into her back yard.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a beautiful clear night, and the stars
were very visible.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I don't remember
their being a moon out, but we could see clearly into the night and the
surroundings.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The trees in the area were
mainly from old tree lines planted years ago by farmers to prevent soil
erosion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The outline of one of these
lines were clearly visible although several miles beyond the underground home
down the road.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were both kind of
chit-chatting and all of a sudden a bright orange ball of light flew very fast
way up in the sky and stopped.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now, I
have to explain that although this and the following happened within a matter
of seconds, tons of things, naturally, are running through my head trying to
rationalize what this could be.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
light then abruptly made a 90-degree turn, speeding off to the West in
literally a split second and went down below that tree line, which was at least
several miles or more away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then, just
as soon as the light went down, it shot or flew back up to where it was, but
this time, 2 other bright orange balls of light were with it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They stopped and then made another 90-degree
turn, speeding back to the East and flew higher into the sky until they were
out of sight.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My friend and I
immediately discussed to make sure we saw the same thing as it had happened so
fast, neither of us said a thing during the sighting.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We saw the same thing and to this day call it
UFOs because these were technically Unidentified Flying Objects.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our parents, however, dismissed our story
with shrugged shoulders, but widened eyes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Ghost Orb<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My second
account involves only myself as witness. I grew up 2 miles SE in the country
down a Rural Route as well, but my road was paved, although unmarked. You
entered our 5-acres by crossing a cattle guard and following a long dirt driveway,
about 300 yards straight, that took a turn before reaching the separate garage
my father had built. To the left sat our brown mobile home. We had bought it
and moved it there in Aug. of 1981. Again, I was about 10 or 11 at the time of
this incident, and it was Winter or late Fall. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Mobile homes are
long, and this wasn't a double-wide, so it was fairly narrow.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was night, and I was in my room, at one
very end of the home, at which the opposite was my parents' bathroom, bedroom,
and down a few steps, the living room and kitchen; then the hallway to my
sister's bedroom, our bathroom, and finally, my room, which entrance faced the
length of the trailer while my sister's room and the bathroom's entrances faced
the width.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was cold and so I wanted to
get my favorite green blanket.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Right
outside my room was our Harvest Gold-colored washer and dryer, above which were
several cabinets.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At that time, I had to
climb upon the dryer to reach the cabinet to retrieve my blanket.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both my bedroom light and the hallway light
were on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As I was pulling the blanket
from the cabinet, I felt the need to turn around and look into the bathroom,
which was directly behind me, and, as I described, was right between mine and
my sister's bedrooms.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was within about
2 feet of the bathroom entrance and I could see the short distance of about 5
or 6 feet to the bathroom window, which was to the front of the home.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a rectangular window, more tall than
wide, with that rough glass so you can't see clearly through it for detail, but
you can for shape and color.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It had a
sliding curtain of the ugly early 80s brown color that happened to be pushed
open to one side from my Mom's cleaning stint earlier during the day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>What I saw
silhouetted against the dark night was a solid white circle, or partial as it
was very large and the window was too small to see it all at once. It was
floating outside this window which was, of course, 7 or 8 feet off the ground.
I was waiting for this to turn out to be a passing car, but it wasn't, and its
properties were not even close. There was no passing light, but, instead, this
&quot;orb&quot; (as I have only recently learned of this term) hovered as if
looking at me and then gently floated across to the other side of the window
until out of sight.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Before I could
gather my senses, it floated back from that side to the other side until out of
sight.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then, amazingly, it passed one
more time, but this time from that same side it just came from.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So, to sum up clearly, it crossed one way
then back the other way, but then it crossed that way again, as if it had made
a circle to start back again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I thought that
my dad had gone outside for some reason, but he, my mom, and my sister who was
about 5 then were all in the living room and looked at me funny when I opened
the front door off the living room and looked to my right toward the bathroom
window. I saw nothing, but what this reminded me of was the evil clown from
Stephen King's &quot;IT&quot; that walked around with the floating balloons. I
loved scary movies and stories, but this was actually something I witnessed,
not watched on TV.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I never found an
explanation, none logical that is, and have had nightmares about that house
since we moved to town in 1990. I really miss the 5 acres though.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I had heard the
rumors about the dorm building that my sorority uses as a House on our college
campus.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had heard that strange things
happened often, that there were ghosts in that building, built around the mid
20's (and not really much different now).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I didn't have to wait long until I had experienced things there for
myself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I hadn't even
moved in yet, and already it was clear that whatever is in our House seemed to
pay alot of attention to me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was
sitting on the floor in the middle of our formal room, a large lobby area that
measures about forty feet by sixty feet with a relatively low ceiling; I was
working on a poster for a project, when something hit the back of my head
(pretty hard too).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I turned around to
see a pencil laying on the floor behind me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It had hit the back of my head, as if someone chucked it at me from five
feet away, but no one was there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was
one of 3 people in the entire house at the time, and the other two were sitting
in the kitchen (the adjascent room) talking, and I could hear them the entire
time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Not long in the
school year after that, I was sitting on a sister's bed watching a movie with
five other people in the room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>About 3
feet above my head, there was a shelf that extended from the wall about two and
a half feet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was leaning against the
wall, so the edge of this shelf was not directly above my head (more like my
knees).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All of a sudden, something hard
hit me square in the face.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After being
stunned, I looked at what had assaulted me: it was a large wooden paddle that
had been on the shelf above me, LEANING against the wall.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There's no way it could have just fallen off
the shelf, and even if it had, it should have hit my knees, or the floor... not
my head.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My sisters commented about how
it had to be the ghost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Another time, I
was in the bathroom (community toilets) in the middle stall of three.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These bathrooms are very acoustic, and you
KNOW when someone else is in there with you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>All of a sudden, the toilet to my left flushed, then mine flushed (I
didn't touch it), then the one to my right flushed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>After I moved
into the house, things happen to me (and my other sisters) on a fairly regular
basis.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My chinese lantern (which hangs
from my ceiling) swings back and forth without any cause (all the freaking
time).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My windchimes (also hanging from
my celing) occasionally chime for no reason (no circulation in my room, and I'm
also on the top floor, so that rules out vibrations from the floor above).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hear scratchings on my door at night. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Sisters of mine have experienced things
&quot;sitting&quot; on their beds with them at night.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Blankets get pulled from beds, appliances get
mysteriously turned on and off, a female voice calls to lone girls in the
house, only to be found without an owner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The last 24 hours have been especially freakish.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One sister's hair was pulled while in the
shower, another's was pulled while in a meeting in the formal room (I happened
to witness this: there was no one near her, and she uddenly sat up with a
yelp..saying someone had yanked on her ponytail).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A few girls have seen things lately too: one
girl saw someone in the bottom floor bathroom very early in the morning (she
saw a figure enter the shower stall, but when she asked who it was, no one
answered.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She checked, and no one was
there), another girl spotted someone running up the back stairwell, she
followed close behind to find a group of sisters sitting in the hallway at the
top of the stairs, who had seen nothing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>During our
initiation of new member's ceremony, something pulled an entire wall of
curtains down, one by one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was sitting
just infront of the curtains, and no one touched them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No one human, anyway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>About a week
ago, one sister woke up to find every poster on her wall (she had at least 20)
had been ripped off the wall and piled in the center of her room, the rope
light she had strung over her vanity had been pulled away, every bit of make-up
and product on her vanity had been turned upside down, and safety pins littered
the floor (she had no idea where they came from).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She refused to sleep in her room for two
days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The legend is
that we have three particular ghosts in our House, that of a sorority girl who
had killed herself in the house back in the thirties (we believe she is
responsible for most of the activity), a fraternity boy who suposably killed
himself in our formal room (We think he had something to do with the ransacking
of that one sister's room), and a faceless old man who never ventures into the
private rooms part of the house, but loves to fool with our one and only soda
machine and switch the clothes around in our laundry facilities. I myself have
seen his reflection behind me in the basement door.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>We're actually
quite fond of our resident ghosts, so long as they don't bother us too much
during finals week.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

discovered you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finally someone who
understands.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well here is my personall
ghostly visits as I call them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I have always
seen ghosts my whole life, as a young child I use to be afraid when I was
visited.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My parents always thought I had
a overvivid imagination.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I use to get
this invisible being that would come to my room.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I could feel it as it got on top of me and I
would tell it to go away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I always knew
when it would be coming before it would arrive and try to hide from it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I never did see this ghost as I have always
called it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After my greatgrandfather
died he came to visit me,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I got really
scared when I saw him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But then I was
always afraid of him anyways.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have
seen people behind friends that they have told me that they do not see, but
when I have described what they looked like they have told me for the 4 friends
that this has happened to me in my life that it sounded like a relative.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My whole life at times I will see someone
from the corner of my eye but when I look directly at it there will be
nothing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I go some places I feel a
very cold presence and let me tell you I am one of those people that is always
hot, I don't even own a coat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I can
definitely tell you I can always tell when something bad or evil is
around.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of my moms friends when I
was about 10 told me that I shouldn't be afraid and that she believed me
because she has the same experiences as I did and told me not to be afraid but
to talk to them and tell them to go away or how can I help or whatever I
feel.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After I started doing this I have
not been afraid anymore, of course unless I feel some kind of evil.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I lived in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Hawaii</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'> some 25-29 years ago I was married to a
Hawaiin man who was murdered 4 days after we got married.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But we lived together for sometime before we
got married.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He had this uncle who was
considered a Kahuna.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He taught and
showed me a lot in the supernatural field. I saw some very interesting ghosts
over there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I come back here after
my husbands death, I use to see him occasionally and still do but much much
less than before.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I can smell the pikake
flowers around me before his presence comes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Just recently, at one of my aunts funeral I was talking with this man at
the cemetary for a while being I was the first one there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had heard some cars coming in and turned
around to look.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I went to talk back
with him he was nowhere.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have seen a
minute man up in the hills where I use to live in the valley where I live in
when I was younger.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now in the house
where I live now for the last 19 years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I have seen many ghosts there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
usually tell them to clean the house or leave.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There has been one lurking around by house for quite a while.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have smudged my house and done many things
to get rid of it. I am not sure if it is just one or many.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had bought some antique furniture and a old
painting of a woman.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My house got very
crowded with many of the deceased in a long line.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My daughter also sees and experiences these
ghosts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My youngest son is afraid of the
house from when he was young to even now as he is approaching his teen
years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have a couple of pictures I can
send to you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were taken on
Halloween on a full moon on a Saturday.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In one of the pictures is my daughter and behind her<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>is a strange looking man.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He looks like a combination of my deceased
husband and a elf tall with pointed ears.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It is very clear.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The other
picture is my son and in this picture he was standing around the fog
machine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So there is fog all around
him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is also many skeletons around
him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After I had gotten back these pictures.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I got kind of obsessed, especially of the man
around my daughter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I took these
pictures to a couple of people psychics.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I was told that this man was a Marque from thousands of years ago,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and he was passing through, very unusual he
said and asked if he could keep the picture.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The other man is a psychic healer and he told me also that this man was
a man of the past of great authority and invited me to come to a church where
they deal with ghosts in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style='font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>When i was about
8 years old my father, my mother, my brother and I moved into a house in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>. It was a hidden house and we would have
to drive our trashcans up to the street because the driveway was so long. This
house had been for sale for ages, and we were in debt for our house in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Oregon</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'> so we moved there. For some reason it
was very cheap. so we moved in and after a couple months strange things began
happening. It all happened when my brother and I ventured out into our huge,
woodland backyard. We would play explorer and hide and go seek. It was my turn
to hide and I wanted to make sure it was the best hiding place so i went way
far back into the woods. I hid behind this group of bushes. I waited ther for about
20 minutes and he still hadn't found me and it was getting dark out. I was
about to quit hiding when i spotted a figue heading towards me. I stopped and
stayed huddled in the bushes and waited for it to come closer. I thought it was
my brother and i didn't want to give away my hiding spot. So the creature came
towards me, i didnt know if it saw me through the bushes, and i saw that it
definatly was not my brother. It was taller and i couldn't see it's face. It
had a creepy, dirty, and ripped cloth it was wearing. But the creepiest thing
of all was its eerie glow. It had some (if this makes sense) dark light
projecting from it. I was terrified as it came directly to the bushes, right
where i was peering through them. i started to sneak around the bushes and i
could see it facing me. So i ran home as fast as i could. When i got home i
told my parents and they didn't believe me. Then my mom asked, &quot;where is
your brother?&quot; and i freaked out. My brother was probably still in those
woods with that horrible spirit. I told my parents that i had no clue and they
got worried. It was dark out. My dad decided to take a light and go search for
him. My dad came back 3 hours later with no brother. I was sweating with fear.
Where was my brother? We decided to turn in and look in the morning.So the next
day we went into the woods. I showed them the spot i hid in and we looked
around there. We looked like 10 yards away from where i hid and we saw a grave
stone. It looked hand made and it had RIPLY carved into it. On it's left we saw
what seemed to be a whole. it looked as if it was dug by someone and that
someone wasn't done digging it. My father said that there were probably some
people living back here in the woods because he saw log houses when he was
searching for Bill (my brother). That spooked me. So we kept looking and
looking untill we found a log house. We went up and knocked on the door. We
kept up the knocking and nobaody answered. We decided to go in and it was the
weirdest place i ever saw. It was one room with a fireplace and a chair and a
bookshelf and an oven. Thats it. So we looked around and it seemed as if this
house had been abandoned. It was past lunch time so we figured we would sit
down and eat our picnick lunch we brought. It was in November so it was cold so
we lit a fire. We shut the door and started eating. When we were done we
searched some more and found a trap door in the floor. We opened it and it had
stairs leading down into the cellar. We saw that there was an old bed and
nothing else. We went back up and were about to head out when we realized that
the house was locked! We didn't lock it. So we unlocked it and started our
search again. We oked untill it got dark. On our way back we were so worried
for Bill. We missed him and were so scared. We passed by the grave and
something was different. The whole next to the grave was covered. And it was
larger, as if someone finished digging it and then put the dirt back in. We
thought it was weird but we didn't take that much to mind about it. We went home
and slept the night, worridly. For the next year we searched in those woods,
but never a trace of Bill. Every now and then we kept searching for him, and
sometimes i went alone, when i was older, and a few times i would see that
eerie glow. Once i saw the eerie glow far to my left, and a smaller ligher glow
to my right. I have always thought that it was Bill. Well, we moved out of that
house when i was older because we were so sad that we lost Bill. I am 18 now
and when i was 17 i decided to go back into the woods to solve the mystery of
Bills disapperence. I looked around and found nothing. I want to go back and
search more but it is a waste.I still miss Bill.<span

when I was about four,and took place in a very small town in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Alabama</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was around Christmas time and my mother had taken me to a party being
held at the biggest house in town, and old three story that had held the same
family for many generations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Apparently,
the party was supposed to be an &quot;adults only&quot; party, because I was
the only child there. I'm a little hazy on the details, but I remember that I
was given some little toys called Weeble Wobbles and left out in the foyer
alone at the foot of the staircase playing with these things. There I was,
weebling my wobbles, mildly annoyed that I didn't have anyone to play with,
when I noticed a movement at the top of the staircase. I looked up and didn't
see anything, but I felt very strongely that someone had been watching me. I
scanned the hallway above, and saw a very distinct black shadow reflecting on
the wall. Being a small child, I thought it was someone playing peek a boo or
hide and seek with me, and so I moved towards the staircase to investigate.
Before I could reach the first step, a young man's voice said behind me,
&quot;You don't want to go up there;there's a ghost up there. He's been living
with us for a long time. His name's Charlie, just like me.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot; I wanna see him&quot;, I said.
&quot;No, you don't wanna see him.&quot;,he said,&quot;That Charlie is
bad.&quot; He then picked me up and took me back over to my toys.Then he just
left without a word. A little later, my mother came for me, and as we were
driving home, I began to tell her about how those people had a ghost in their
house named Charlie and that their son had the same name as the ghost. My
mother just looked at me and said, &quot;How do you know about Charles
Apparently, the family's only son, Charles had died two years earlier...
Honestly, it's been so long ago, that sometimes I'm not exactly sure what I saw
that night. Was it two ghosts, one evil one, and another trying to protect me ?
I just don't know. All I do know is that when my mother told me Charles had died,
a chill came over me, and 25 years later, I still feel that same chill whenever
I think of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I have a true
experience to relate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>In January 1992,
I was reading a book about mediums and channelers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I read that one of them called for her spirit
guide to make itself known to her and the next day, it had appeared.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wanted to have the same experience, so I
went to bed long before my husband.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
closed my eyes and surrounded myself with a white<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>protective light.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I asked that whatever guides were out there
for me make themselves known to me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Since childhood, my greatest fear was to leave my hands outside my
covers at night for fear something would touch me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Before I fell asleep, I deliberately put my
right hand over the edge of the bed to demonstrate that I trusted whatever
might come.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I turned off the light and
fell asleep.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Sometime while I
was asleep, my husband came to bed, but I was never aware that he had done so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I became aware
again sometime in the wee hours.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I won't
say I was &quot;awakened&quot; because I could not open my eyes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was lying on my right side facing a wall
and I could feel my husband's back resting against mine.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Resting on top of me, between my hip and my
ribs was what felt like a very compact but heavy presence.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It hampered my breathing and I could not
move.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My eyes were closed and I had the
&quot;knowledge&quot; in my awareness that if I opened them, I would never be
the same again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I felt that the presence
that was sitting on me was the leader, and there was another entity on the
floor beside the bed with its face very close to mine.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was frozen with terror.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I remembered my hand extended off the side of
the bed, and as soon as I thought of it, a cold, dead-feeling hand was placed
in my hand - the very thing I had always feared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>All was still in
the room as I tried to get a grip on my terror.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I thought to myself, you invited this encounter so you'd better say
something.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I said out loud, &quot;Who
are you?&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I know I said it out loud
because I distinctly remember feeling my mouth move and hearing my voice say
the words.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A thought came into my mind
that was not my own.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It said
&quot;Cheeeeetaaaahhhh&quot; in a singsong voice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As that word was &quot;spoken&quot; in my
mind, a knowledge of how these entities had come also entered my mind.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I &quot;knew&quot; that they had come
extremely fast from the East through the walls of the house and through the
bureau that rested against the east wall of my bedroom to rest upon me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have no idea where this information came
from...it seemed like it was given to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I didn't know
how to respond to this answer, so I said something that seems stupid now.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I said aloud,&quot; Do they call you that
because you travel so fast?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>In response, the
bony tip of a finger touched the left side of my forehead where it rested on
the pillow and slowly drew a line across my forehead.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Simultaneously, a voice inside my head said
my name slowly in that singsong way again...&quot;Diiiii-aaaannnnne&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>As my name was
said, my head was filled with the knowledge that whatever was toying with me
was immensely evil.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it wanted to, it
could destroy me with that very fingertip.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I also was given the knowledge that I was such a small, insignificant
speck in the universe, that it chose not to mess with me at this time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instantly after this knowledge was given to
me, the two things were gone as fast as they had come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I opened my eyes
and saw the familiar shapes in the dark of my dresser, my nightstand and lamp,
the book I had<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>been
reading.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was absolutely frozen with
terror.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I moved my left hand to touch my
husband and felt a bit better.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I took
some deep breaths, but I was shaking and tears were coming from my eyes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I never went back to sleep that night, but
lay in the dark until my husband awoke.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I asked him if he had seen or heard or felt anything in the night.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He said no.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>A few years
later, I went to see a psychic with some friends.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When it was my turn to ask a question, I said
to her,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>&quot;I had an
experience a few years ago.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What can you
say to me about that?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>She brushed her
hand across her forehead and said,&quot;Your spirit guides are saying 'Whew'
because that was a very dangerous thing that you did.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You were being tested, and you barely got out
of it with your life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>NEVER do that
again!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>A few years
after that, I was in a college class with a Native American woman.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I told her about the incident and she said
that she was not surprised it came from the East because the East is where her
tribe always sends the bad spirits to banish them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Needless to say, I have never again tried to
contact my spirit guides.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My name is
Shelbi, and I am the age of 13. I work at my dance studio, and I take classes
there 3 hours a day. The studio is located right by an old grave yard. Since it
opened, back in 1999, it has no doubt been haunted. The spirit(s) inhabiting
the building although have never been a potential threat. They are frightening,
but never violent. In fact, the spirit(s) are not even destructive. They are
definitely there though. Several occurrences have happened there, and still
scare me each time. For Example: While vacuuming one night around </span><st1:time
Minute="0" Hour="23"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>11 pm</span></st1:time><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>, I am in the hallway. The loud hum of
the vacuume is to loud for me to hear anything, but I suddenly switched it off
and turned around. Strangely, I didnt know why I was turning around and
stopping my work, and to this day I dont know what made me do it, but I did.
And what I saw behind me was someone standing in the back studio room. Just
standing there. The room was dark, and I only could see the shadow. Thinking it
must be Kellee, the owner, I ignored it and walked to the front lobby. Sitting
in her seat at her desk, was Kellee. Shocked, I walked back the the hall and
looked in the room. The person still stood there, and before my own eyes, it
dissapeared. I know for a fact Kellee and I were the only people there. Another
thing that happens, and is a regular thing occuring only this past year, is
that most nights in that back studio room, which is connected to a sound
recording room, the computers and all the equipment in the room will turn on.
When the equipment comes on, the same song always plays. It is an Al Gilbert, a
famous tapper, song. I don't know why this song comes on, and I never go back
to turn it off nor does Kellee because it soon enough goes off itself. In the
studio you can often hear footsteps on the wooden d ce floors when noone is in
the rooms. Lights flicker, and door open when children are even in the classes.
We tell the kids the unlevel flooring cause the doors to open, when actually
doorknobs turn each time it happens. After the door is opened, it opens far
enough as if someone is coming through, then it swings backwards, but doesn't
close. These occurences happen very often, and are actually considered normal
to the people who are at the studio as much as say, I am. Only once though has
anyone heard a spirit talk to them in the studio though. That was Bethany, a 20
year dance teacher at the studio. She was teaching a 4-5 year old ballet class,
when she let the kids out for a water break. They all left, and she stood in
the center of the room, alone. As she stood there, she heard someone whisper
unmistakably her name in her ear. This happened only a few months ago, and has
not happened since. Although spirits talking to us hasnt happened since, the
opening doors, mysteriously turning on music, and footsteps have not stopped.
We know the spirit/spirits have not left, for just the other day as Marianne, a
45 year old staff member cleaned, she turned her head to see a black figure
walk behind her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Only a few weeks
ago it was Halloween. I decided I'd like to thumb my way <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>through
Halloween, by painting my nose black and wearing phony antlers. And <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>ta-da! I was a
reindeer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I am 13, so I
should've been trick-or-treating, but something compelled me <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>to stay there
and hand out candy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>And being the
cheapo that I am, I decided to kill two birds with one stone <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and meditate
also.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My dad has never
believed in ghosts, aliens, or other paranormal activity, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>so when I
meditated he thought I was insane. And maybe I am.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Anyways, he was
watching me meditate, joking about 'the spirits' when he <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>decided to go
inside for a minute. With my eyes closed, I nodded and opened <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>them to see if
trick or treaters were coming, when suddenly the image of a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>transparent
black dog came into view. His left ear was bleeding <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>uncontrollably,
as if it had been mutilated and torn, and he was foaming at <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the mouth like
he had rabies, and I think he did. He wore a collar, with a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>bone-shaped tag,
but I couldn't read the text. The tag sifted through his <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>chest, waving in
the wind, but quite strangely enough it was a gentle sway, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>unlike the gusts
of winds happening that night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Anyways, my dog
Tilly sat next to me and began barking and growling a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>little, as if
she was very uneasy, and she looked at the dog.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I stood up and
paused, watching the dog curiousely as it snarled at me. It <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>looked like it
was barking, but no sound came out of it's mouth, and I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>thought I was
going crazy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I took a step
back in fright, and it leapt onto the porch, angrily howling <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and barking at
me, when my dog scratched at the door and wanted to get <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>inside. I tore
the door open and allowed her to run inside, and when I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>turned back, the
dog was gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Despite it's
absense physically, it tormented me that night with random <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>growls and barks
that only I could hear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>For example,
here's an excerpt (I jot down my paranormal encounters in a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>journal):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Me: Hey, did you
hear that?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Dad: Hear what?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Me: This really
creepy low growling coming from the pathway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Dad: No ...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Me: There it is
again! (I leapt in fright.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Dad: Come on,
you're just imagining things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Me: ...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I kept that
experience to myself for a while, since I was terrified that <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>telling anybody
would make the dog come back. I had a nightmare about it <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>that night, and
it made me break out in a cold sweat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The nightmare
was about the black dog. I was stroking my cat tenderly, and I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>smiled when he
purred as we sat in a white space of nothingness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Suddenly, the
black dog appears, growling angrily at Socks (my cat), and yet <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>my cat does
nothing. But I leap in shock and begin to run.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The dog
continues to chase me, howling and barking, foaming angrily at the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>mouth, when my
cat leaps infront of me and makes me trip. Both Socks and the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>dog close in on
me. My cat holds me down while the dog closes in on my neck, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and that's when
I woke up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I've never quite
looked at my cat the same way, as he seems to be a link <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>between my
paranormal experiences in some way, and I never forget the angry <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I have three
experiences that all seem to fall into the ghost catagory. Two are instances
where I ran up against very cold areas in old houses that during the summer
that made my hair stand on end and caused a feeling of panic making me retreat
in a hasty fashion from the area. One was in my grandfather's old house on our
farm which had been vacant since he passed away in 1964. Being an old homestead
house in the family since the 1840's several of my relatives have passed away
in this house including my grandfather. I have been in and stayed in this house
many times since I was a child and never experienced anything unusual until
this one particular instance. I was living in my father's house after he passed
away and one summer day decided to walk down to my grandfather's old house just
to look around and see what condition the place was in. There was an old
enclosed spiral staircase that lead upstairs and I had been up there many
times. As I opened the door to the stairway this time though, after about to
steps it felt as thought the temperature had dropped about 20 degrees and I found
myself with one foot in the air frozen in place. It was almost as if I had come
up a gainst an invisible cold wall and was unable to proceed up the stairway. I
had instant goose bumps and after gathering my thoughts slowly backed out of
the stairway and hall. As I walked back into the dining room I felt foolish and
turned to go back upstairs. It was the same feeling again only now I felt
something close to panic and just wanted to get out of the old house which I
did in short order. As I said the place had been empty for fifteen years and
was in bad repair with broken wondows and such, but this was in mid summer and
close to 90 degrees outside with no reason whatsoever to have a cold draft or
anything inside the house. Ghost? I've always wondered. The house was taken
down last year and my cousin has a mobile home on the site now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The other
incident of this nature occurred at a friend's place when I was 17 years old.
We had walked from his parent's house back accross a creek and pasture to his
grandfather's old place about a half mile away on their farm. The place had
been empty since his grandfather passed away years before. The house was in bad
shape with the end wall of the house collapsed so the place was open to the
weather on one side. My friend told my to keep my mouth shut about being there
because for some reason his parents had told him to stay away from the place.
Anyway to make a long story short, he had forgotten something at home that he
wanted to bring on our hike and told me to wait while he ran home. While
waiting curiosity overcame me and I went up to the old house and hopped up into
the end room on the open side. It looked like it was the main bedroom as it
still had an antique bed and dresser there. The bed still had old moldy bedding
on it and a depression in the middle like someone had been laying there. I
noticed the whole house was still furnished like no one had taken anything out
after the old man had passed away there. There were still dishes on the table
and food in the cupboards. Of course everything was wet and moldy from the
leaks in the roof and such but it looked as if nothing had been touched. I was
just curious as I looked around. This was also a nice summer day and fairly
warm outside. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary until I noticed an old civil
war type ammo case hanging on an old hall tree by the front door. I took it off
the hook and opened it to find it still full of old ammunition which had turned
green from oxidation. All at once I felt a very cold chill come over me and a
wierd feeling of panic. I hung the case back on the rack and ran all the way
through the house and jumped out and continued on to I was well clear of the
structure. Standing out it the bright warm sun I began to feel stupid about
getting jumpy like that. I went back to the house and again hopped up onto the
flooring but that time never got past the bedroom before feeling that freezing
chill and once again turning and exiting the house for good. I've always
wondered if the old man was watching over his home or was I experiencing an
over active imagination. I don't know the status of this old house as I was
only there the one time and that was thirty years ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The third
incident is the one that has really bothered me for years. In 1978 my father
was diagnosed with cancer. he was 50 years old at the time and I was 23. The
doctors there in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-family:Arial;
  color:white'>Oregon</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:white'> said it was too advanced for treatment and told him he had
only six months or so to live. He did make a trip to the Phillipines for
treatment and ended up living about another year. He had worked for the fish
and wildlife service for several years as a government trapper relocating or
destroying wild animals depending on the damage they were causing to persons or
livestock in the area. Upon his diagnosis and hospitalization the government
regional supervisor asked if I would take over his duties. I accepted the
position and started taking over the field work the involved in the job. Every
evening on the way home I would stop at the hospital and spend a couple of hours
visiting with my father and telling him about my day and what had transpired.
We both looked forward to the visits and spending time together. I never missed
a visit in all the time he was there. One day my work took me to the other end
of the county and I stopped at home before going to the hospital. Between work,
spending time at the hospital, and the stress of the whole situation I was
getting totally exhausted. Once I sat down in my chair at home I felt like
someone had pulled the plug. I was all in. I decided I would get some rest and
make the 20 mile drive to the hospital in the morning to visit. I went to bed
and slept like the dead. Early the next morning my wife had gotten up to make
coffee. I was laying in bed staring into space trying to wake up when at once I
saw my father kind of like a point of light coming from the upper corner of the
bedroom and coming toward me until he was right there with me. At first I
thought I must still be asleep and dreaming as it seemed like he was in a white
hospital gown. It didn't really seem to be a hospital gown though....more like
flowing white where his body would be, but I could see his face clearly. He
came right to me and gave me a hug and could hear him say &quot;I love you
son&quot;. I hugged back gently because I had been afraid to hug his frail body
too hard at the hospital but it seemed as if I was hugging air. I told him I
loved him and he started to receed back toward the point of light. I grasped at
him and told him &quot;don't go&quot;. He said &quot;I have to&quot; and
disappeared back into the light. I got out of bed and went to the kitchen where
my wife was having coffee. She asked me what was wrong and I started to cry and
told her I just saw dad and he was gone. A few minutes later my uncle pulled
into the driveway to tell us he had passed away but I already knew. My mother
had gotten a call to come to the hospital that night to see him one last time
and she had driven past my house deciding to let me sleep rather than wake me.
It was just past seven in the morning when I saw him and that was he same time
he was pronounced dead. I think he came to see me one last time but who knows
if it was a stress induced dream or reality. I told my family about the
experience and my mother was mad at me for some time after that. She said she
was jealous...why would he come to say goodbye to me and not her? I still don't
know....ghost or dream?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>There are a few
other odd happenings that seem minor to these but could also be included as

nobody home.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He would put them back
where he had them and the next time he went into the room they would be moved
again... This went on for several years then stopped abruptly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Also on several
occasions we would be on the sun porch reading or watching TV, and you would
see this little blond headed boy about four or five years old peek around the
door from the hall and peir at whom ever was there.<span

peekaboo.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When you would look up at him

was witnessed by several members of the family from time to time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Several other
times we would be outside the house, always at night, but not always late at
night and you would hear this very loud, shrill scream.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I am a current

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The first time I
ventured to this particular cemetary I was in awe of how beautiful and amazing
it was.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I even recall saying out loud to
the deceased/spirits, &quot;This is sure a beautiful place you have to call
'home'&quot;.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I sincerely meant that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have several pictures (with many orbs) that
day I took and no one ever said that I couldnt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This cemetary is very popular-- it has walking trails, maps of important
peoples grave markers, etc.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On many
bright, sunny days you can see avid walkers making their 'rounds'.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Sometimes on a
day when I've got acouple hours in between class I'll get in my car and drive

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>When I was four
my mom took me to learn how to ice skate in Milwakee. There where two ice
skating rinks acrross from each other and we didn't know this. Well we went
into the wrong one, we walked all the way through and found the door locked on
the other end.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>As we had gone
throught before we had gone past the ice rink, the ic was slowly melting and
the glass door was closed to the rink, and we saw a broken old radio. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>On our way back
through we could hear laughter and music. We could also hear footsteps in the
bathroom and a flush, but when we went in it was completly empty and broken
down. We headed back to towards the rink, where the music seemed to be comming
from. When we got there all the lights where on and the door open. We heard
what sounded like a person skating on the ice and others laughing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>We knew no one
had came in, because it was a straight ended building and all other doors had
been locked or broken. As we reached the door to leave it all went quite and
the laughter faded, then we left and headed home. We never went back to that
rink and my mom never took me to learn how to ice skate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>This isn't scary
but I'm sure it was a ghost ... my sister had a friend over and it was late at
night, I would say maybe around 11 or 12 at night I was in my room asleep with
the music on when my sister and her friend wake me up and tell me to turn the
music down I turned it almost all the way down and immediately dozed off to
sleep again only to have my sister and her friend in my room again, turning
down the music b/c it was all the way up, but I didn't hear anything and the
radio has always been on my night stand which is right by my ear!!! well,
needless to say they didn't believe that it wasn't me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Another story
happened not to long ago, first let me point out that we just moved here and
that in the house next door 4 people died all at the same time. Well, in the
house that we live in there's the half bathroom, near the front door, and right
by the stairs. My sister and I have always felt a weird feeling when we either
passed the bathroom or when we're in it, and at night it gives us chills and
it's a pain to go up the stairs... Anyways, I was hiding from my sister in my
brother's which is passed that bathroom, my sister was looking for me and she
thought I ws hiding in teh bathroom b/c she saw a shadow of someone with long
hair poke their head out and back in, and when she went to &quot;bust me&quot;
she turned on teh light and there was no one in there, she freaked out sooo
much she started yelling for me to stop playing and come out from where I was
at. i don't think teh ghost is a bad ghost b/c she hasn't harmed anyone, and
plus... apparently she likes playing hide and go seek!<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>is an old house,
about 80 years old at that time. What's strange is that we <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>were in the TV
room, which was an added room and was not part of the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>original house.
Anyway, I was dusting and she was vacuuming, and the TV was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>on. Suddenly the
TV began to change channels by itself and the volume turned <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>up all the way.
The remote control was just sitting on the table, untouched <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>(by us anyway).
We couldn't control the TV with the remote. Even when we <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>tried to turn it
off manually on the TV itself, the channels continued to <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>change and the
volume became so deafening that we had to just leave the room <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and let
&quot;it&quot; finish its course. We weren't scared. It was neat actually. It <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>didn't stop for
about an hour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>A couple of
years after that at the same house, my stepdad decided to dig up <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the small porch
in the back yard that had been there since before we moved <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>in. He found
several things buried in the ground. One of them was a genuine <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>pearl necklace,
which he took inside and put in a glass of water to get the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>dirt off. He let
it sit in the kitchen by the sink. I was in the kitchen a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>couple of days
later grabbing something to eat when the glass slid by <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>itself, just a
few inches, but I saw it. Who knows who it belonged to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My mom told me
this story about when she was younger- about 17. She is not a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>superstitious
person and I've never known her to exaggerate. She was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>interested in
witchcraft at the time. She had no religious views and so she <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>decided to check
some witchcraft books out from the library and take them <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>home. The same
night, she was asleep in her bed when she woke up to the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>feeling of
someone choking her, yet she saw nothing. When she tried to <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>scream, she
found that she was paralyzed- she couldn't breathe, move, or <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>blink. All she could
do was look around. Whatever it was let go after a few <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>seconds and she
decided not to tell anyone about it. Well, this kept <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>happening to her
every night, but each night, the thing would choke her for <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>longer than it
had the night before. Finally, one night she prayed inside <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>her head,
&quot;God, if you get this thing off of me, I'll follow you.&quot; And <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>immediately it
let go, and it never happened again. My mother has been a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Christian ever
since.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Now for my
grandmother (my mom's mom). Spirits tend to follow her wherever <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>she goes. Not
evil ones though. Wherever she moves, things will be <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>misplaced,
especially the little Native American figurines that she <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>collects. She
and my grandfather moved into a new house very recently. They <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>went out of town
for a few days, and my mom and I stayed over at their <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>house. My mom
slept in the main bedroom and I was supposed to sleep in the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>guest bedroom.
However, I was trying to fall asleep in that room, but I felt <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>an extremely
strong presence in the room with me. I didn't know if it was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>good or bad, but
it was so strong that it scared me out of sleeping in that <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>room. I went to
go sleep in the main bedroom where my mom was. That night I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>dreamed about a
lot of my dead relatives. None of them talked to me. Some of <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>them just looked
at me, and others didn't notice me. I told my grandparents <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>about it but no
one really took me seriously. The next time I came over to <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>their house, I
went into the guest bedroom and saw that my grandmother had <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>decorated two of
the walls with tons of pictures of our ancestors, which was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>strange. I still
wonder how I was connected to that, but I've been thinking, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and I remember
that at my great grandmother's funeral, I was visiting some <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>of our other
relatives' graves who were buried in the same lot, and I think <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I leaned on my
great great aunt May's grave, and somehow the tombstone <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>cracked. My
great great aunt May died when she was a child. Which might <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>explain the
incidents that really caught my attention. These happened at my <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>grandparents' house
also. I'll save the best one for last. The first one is <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>this: My
grandmother keeps some of the bigger toys for the grandchildren in <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the garage.
There's one that is known to go off by itself during the night. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>It's a
play-popcorn maker. In the middle of the night, it will go off, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>saying,
&quot;Let's pop some popcorn!&quot; Then it will make the popping noise that <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>it makes when
you press a different button. But here's the really cool one. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My grandfather's
daughter Leta (I'm not blood related to either of them) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>stayed over at
the house, in the same guest bedroom that scared me so much. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Leta is not a
superstitious woman. But she was almost asleep that night, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>when she heard a
repetative banging noise in the toy closet next to her. She <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>got up to open
the door and see what it was, but it stopped. When she laid <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>back down, the
noise started again. This continued for a while and finally, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Leta called my
grandparents into the room to show them what was happening, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and sure enough
when she laid down again, the banging noise proceeded. This <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>time, my
grandmother opened the door to the toy closet and they all <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>discovered a
miniature toy car, repeatedly banging into the side wall by <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>itself. It
wasn't the kind with a remote control to it, either. I think <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>there is a child
spirit that follows my grandmother around, and I believe it <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>to be my great
great aunt May. Since she died as a child, she might still <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>want to play
with toys. Maybe I let something loose when I accidentally <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>cracked her
grave stone, maybe not. I don't know. It seems to be all <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>connected
somehow.<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>
