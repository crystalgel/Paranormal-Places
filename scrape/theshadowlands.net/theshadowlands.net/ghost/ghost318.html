<p><b>Mom</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ScottDC61@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>My mom passed away of cancer late August...the morning I heard she
passed (expected) I was getting ready for a shower. My hearing aid removed,
I thought I heard someone taling, leaving a message on the answering machine.
As I stepped closer and saw no such message was being recorded I hear clearly
but softly "Hi Honey, everything is ok!" I recognized the voice as being
my moms.</b>
<br><b>My sister had heard my moms voice just a day or two before she died
(mom was in SD Sis was in Elsinore).....</b><b></b>

<p><b>Hotel Conneaut</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CarolAndJon125@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>This past summer I stayed in the Hotel Conneaut in Pennsylvania.
When I tried to take a picture of my children in from of the fireplace
where "John" resides the flash wouldn't work. I had just put new batteries
in the camera so I'm sure that the batteries were working. I tested the
camera several times by pointing the camera away from the fireplace and
the flash would work fine. But when I tried to take a picture of the fireplace
where "John" stands the flash would not work. All of the pictures in front
of the fireplace also came out blurry. Even if I take a picture without
the flash it still comes out crystal clear but darker. The Hotel was so
much fun. The staff were awesome and always glad to share their experience
with the resident spirits and ghosts. There was a stairwell that I found
particularly unnerving that is home to two ghosts. I'm pretty brave and
I took a "dare" to deliver a sheet of paper and crayons to the ghost of
a young girl that sits at the bottom of the stairs but I could not go down
this stairwell, when I got to the second landing I couldn't move, I froze.
I did get dozens of orb photographs from the Hotel taken without the flash
with my digital camera. The Hotel is awesome and has several ghosts and
spirits connected with the Hotel and the adjoining amusement park. The
amusement park also features the Blue Streak coaster which is a classic
and also supposed to be haunted.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Two Brief Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: roxierox@btinternet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, I've been looking at your site recently and I have decided
to tell you about my two breif experiences with ghosts.</b>
<br><b>The first siting was when I was 7 in July 1998. It was about 1,
2ish in the morning and for some reason I woke up. I was freezing cold,
so I went to my Mum's room where it was really hot and she was awake (because
of the heat). The next night, I went to bed early and it became cold again,
and I remember being puzzled because it was the middle of July. My door
kind of opened and shut repeatedly, but I thought it was just the wind.
So I shut my windows but the door just kept banging. I sat up and I was
wondering what the hell was going on, and all of the bedding fell off.
I ran into my Mum's room and she came back to my room with me, and there
was a foggy kind of shadow floating around above my bed. I tried to point
it out to her, but she only noticed that it was cold. We moved house, because
my Mum re-married, we also aqquired a dog.</b>
<br><b>6 years later in the new house (that we've been in for 2 years)
There wasn't anymore unnatural stuff going on until recently. It was about
6 in the evening, and I was talking to my friend on the phone in the front
room, when I was suddenly aware of the coldness. I looked around and saw
this man standing on the coffee table in the corner of the room. He was
looked quite real except for an abscence of colour (he was just grey and
white). I told my friend I had to go and called for my Mum, and the dog
followed her. He immedeatley started barking at the coffee table. My friend
andMum think I'm crazy. He keeps coming back, and all he does is stand
there with his head hanging, now with a random cat flitting around his
feet. Our house is near a crossroads so I've decided the explanation for
the man is that he was hanged here in late summer/early autumn.</b>

<p><b>40's House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bunnysunnie@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi I have so many stories of things that have happened either to
me or to my daughters and also to my nieces and now to my great niece.
I am wondering if we are all very sensitive to these things, because I
can remember things that happened to me as a child too, right up to this
day.</b>
<br><b>I guess the one I ll share is what has/is happening to my great
niece who is only just now 4. The house they live in is an older home,
but she has always seemed to see things and watch things that other people
don t see. In the last couple of years she has been saying that there is
a little boy who is in the house and he talks to her and they play together.
One night her father was tucking her into bed and they were talking and
all of a sudden she stopped talking and looked toward the door and it looked
like she was following someone walk in to the door and trough the room
and toward the window. When her father asked her what she was doing she
said to him the little boy just came in my room. Anther time she was sitting
on the floor playing with her toys, but it was like she was playing with
another child and when her father started to talk to her she ignored him
and he after a couple of attempts to talk to her touched her arm and said
what are you doing? She looked at him with this mean weird look on her
face and said the little boy doesn t want me to talk to you, go away while
we play! Another time when my daughter was sleeping over there she heard
what she thought was my great niece running up and down the hall way, she
said it was a child s foot steps, so finally she yelled up to my nieces
boyfriend to get my great niece because she was going to wake up everyone
and when he went to look at her she was sound asleep in her bed! She said
that it happened on and off all night and when she said something to my
niece she said you heard the little boy running!</b>
<br><b>She has also said at times the little boy scares her too, and there
seems to be a man in the house also. She has said stuff about a man there
too. My niece wishes she could figure out how to get some back ground on
her home, but it is a rented home and was never lived in my the owner,
he always rented it out, and she doesn't feel very comfortable to ask him
if a child had died in that house at sometime. I would estimate the house
was most likely built in the 40's or so.</b>

<p><b>Our Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rob1@tds.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have never really seen a ghost personally. I was searching online
for ghost websites and found yours. I live with my grandmother. My mother
died in 2001 of cancer. I always belived that her spirit remained in that
old house. The house seemed inhabited already when we moved in it. There
were strange noises in the night but soon disappered. One day shortly after
she died I was in the living room watching TV and I distictly heard her
voice crying. On one other occasion, my grandfather (her father) was about
to face serious surgery. He had a critical life threatening problem. One
night before the surgery my grandmother awoke to see my mother standing
by their bed looking at them. She then simply faded away. My grandfather
is a Baptist minister and simply does not believe ghosts exist. I do believe
God does allow spirits to return here for a purpose.</b>

<p><b>There have been many sighting in a lot of the old houses in downtown
guelph, ontario. many peopld have reported piano's playing, seeing things
and so on. also, there have been said to been sightings in 2 main cemetaries.
Personally, i think that my subdivision was built on land where something
must have occured, because many of our neighbours, including ourselves,
have seen and felt things. apperitions have appeared, lights flickered
with and in the worst case senario, one of our neighbours felt like someone
was pushing down on her chest but no one was there.</b>

<p><b>My Spirits</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: drksongraven@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>First let me start by saying that i have always been a sensitive
person when it comes to the supernatural.It seems to be something passed
through the women in my family.I had my first ghost experience when I was
about 4 years old though I didn't know it.I had an imaginary friend that
seemed very real to me.I used to hold long conversations with my "friend"
George and never thought it odd that he always answered back.George was
an older man going bald wearing old type overalls.While it may not seem
odd to have a male friend you have to realize I was a young girl at the
time.It wasn't until I was a teenager talking to my mother about him did
she tell me the story of a house they had lived in before I was born.This
was a farmhouse put up for rent by a brother and sister that had belonged
to their newly deceased father.My mother and father had a lot of strange
things happen while they lived there and assumed that when they eventually
moved it would end.It didn't and apparently my imaginary friend was a spirit
that had attached himself to our family.I am now 26 and still feel him
around and feel very comforted by this.The worst time I had being sensitive
was when I was 6 1/2 years old we moved to a nice place in a small country
town.Everything was fine at first but within a month i started hearing
things.It started with a baby crying.It wasn't scary since my mother had
just given birth to my youngest brother.It started getting strange&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when I realized that I only heard it late at night in
my bedroom.Then I started seeing a shape of a rocking chair in the corner.It
didn't take long for it to manifest completely into the image of a young
women rocking a crying baby with a young man standing over both of them.It
wasn't scary but instead had a strong feeling of sadness about it.It wasn't
until my older sister saw the same thing and we were talking about it to
a very elderly women who had lived next door that we found out that around
the turn of the century a young family had died in the house of influenza
all within a week of each other.I also saw the figure of an older women
in the house but she never bothered me at all.The one that scared me was
the figure of an old man that could be seen walking on the hill behind
the house.Looking through old newspapers from when the town had been prosperous
that we found out that the hill behind the house was once a coal mine that
had caved in one evening and killed an older miner.He always seemed to
be angry and scared me badly.The second thing that got me was one night
when i was about nine.I wasn't feeling well and had gone to my parents
room across the hall to try to wake my mother up.I was standing there quietly
calling for my mother trying not to wake my father up when i blinked and
saw a very clear image of a skeleton standing next to me grinning and reaching
towards me.Needless to say not waking my father seemed to be the last thing
on my mind as I screamed and dove into their bed.The weird thing is that
I am a 26 year old parent of two now and when the chance to live in this
house again with my children came into being I leapt at it since most of
my best childhood memories involve that house.I didn't feel any of the
angry and scary manifestations there and figured they had finally moved
on.The thing that was seen though was something new seen not only by me
but by my mother and my extremely skeptical boyfriend.I saw it first and
didn't think anything of I was laying on the pull out couch talking to
my mother when i saw a small figure walk from my children's bedroom to
the back of the chair my mother was sitting in.I asked my mother what did
my daughter want thinking she had woken up.My mother looked at me like
i was nuts and told me that both the kids were still asleep.I put the sight
aside thinking that maybe i was half asleep seeing things.That was until
my boyfriend woke me up late one night asking who the kid was in the hallway.He
had gotten up to get a drink&nbsp; and had just opened the door to the
hallway when a small child had run past him into the kitchen.Again he also
thought maybe one my kids had gotten up but when he went into the kitchen
and looked there wasn't anyone there.He even looked under the table and
into the pantry and bathroom but nothing. I only saw it once more.It was
late at night and I was lying on my bed with the door open.The bedroom
I was in was the one my parents had used when I was a child.The door opened
into the hallway and faced directly into the bedroom I had slept in as
a child now being used by my boyfriend's 7 year old son.I happened to glance
into the hallway in time to see what looked like his son walking by the
door towards the living room.I got up to see if he was alright but my mother
(who had been in there the whole time) said he hadn't been in there.I went
to check on him and sure enough he was sound asleep.My mother was talking
to me after we moved out and asked me if I had seen the child too.It appeared
to all of us as a small boy maybe about three years old wearing various
outfits.I had seen it twice once wearing a white night gown type thing
and once wearing a dark colored footed pajama outfit.My boyfriend had seen
it wearing a white snowsuit outfit and strangely when he saw it running
into the kitchen it seemed to be heading towards the back door.I don't
remember seeing or sensing this spirit as a child in the house so I have
no idea when it had started manifesting.Something else new i the house
from my living there as a child was that the closet door in the hallway
would pop open at certain people.It never happened to me but would open
if my boyfriend came anywhere near it and while we thought that maybe it
was something to do with his weight or his stride it also only happened
when his young son or our neighbor lady walked by it.And since they all
weigh differently and walk differently it does seem kind of odd.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Incidents</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Lucky4EvrJnJ13@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi, my name is Jessica. I found your website when browsing, and thought
I'd submit a couple of the many weird things that have happened here at
my home. I'm 19 years old, and have luved in the same house with my parents
and sister for my entire life. My sister and I have always had a fascination
with the paranormal, ghosts, poltergeists, anything dealing with haunts
and hauntings. Since I was 8, and my sister was 12, we have been almost
obsessed with the whole topic. We started hearing a woman crying in our
house late at nights. It would come from our upstairs bathroom, and she
would be sobbing almost hysterically. If we would be brave enough to go
upstairs to investigate, the crying would slow down, and sound farther
away. We have seen her standing in doorways, and she was in an old-fashioned
tattered dress. She would only appear for a mere second, and then disappear.
I awoke out of a sound sleep once, and could've sworn I saw her hovering
over me while I lay in bed. The other thing my sister, myself, and my mother
have seen is a tall figure dressed in all black, and you can only see the
eyes on its face. The eyes would be a reddish color. I saw the thing first,
standing outside of my sisters 2nd floor bedroom window. My grandmother
had even saw something that she described exactly the way we had, and it
was standing in the small graveyard she had in the very back of her farmyard
in Oakland, MD. We have had lights go on and off on their own, stereos
turn on, volume up all the way, on its own... The last thing that has happened
was a sharp knife flew off our kitchen counter, aimed right for our dogs
head. The knife missed, but our dog isn't with us anymore. She died 2 months
after the last incident... I'm not saying they aren't related, but I'm
not saying they aren't... Well, thank you VERY much for reading my email.
I'm sure more scary things have happened to others, and mine may seem boring
or such, but I appreciate you taking the time to read mine. Have a great
night, and thank you once again!&nbsp; :)</b>

<p><b>Hi.&nbsp; I'm the same person who submitted 'Few paranormal experiences'
about a</b>
<br><b>year ago.&nbsp; I had the opportunity to experience what I thought
was paranormal</b>
<br><b>activity in one of the libraries I work at.</b>
<br><b>As soon as I entered the building, I felt like there was someone
else there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The lady that I worked with says she has seen it, a black
shadow walking</b>
<br><b>in front of a window.&nbsp; The whole time I was there, I'd hear
noises all</b>
<br><b>throughout the room.&nbsp; Things that would make me look up, but
I never got</b>
<br><b>nervous.</b>
<br><b>Rumor has it that it is the old director (I think) of the library,
and when</b>
<br><b>the library was renamed he got upset and came back to haunt the
place.</b>
<br><b>Other students have heard noises and felt presences, too (the library

<br><b>My Son</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:rebacca_hill@yahoo.co.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>i will tell you about my first experience this happened not long
after my beloved dog had run off,he was a whippet who drank cups of tea
and slept under the bed covers with me and my partner.pip my dog had become
very ill and one evening while i was putting my bin bags out he decided
to run off after hours of searching i gave in and went home.a few weeks
later while alone in my house i went into my room to tidy up i had been
there about 10 minutes when this deep contented breathing sounded all round
the room i was petrified and then i saw an indentation on my bed which
i touched,as i touched the spot the breathing stopped,the area of the dent
was warm to touch and i think my dog had come home to say goodbye.</b>
<br><b>my next experience happened almost 3 years after my baby son died
and i had a year and a half year old baby girl who had just moved into
her own room.my daughter had a car for her to ride on and you could drop
balls into the front and they roll down to the bottom,i kept her baby monitor
on it so it was close to her cot.</b>
<br><b>one night i awoke to the sound of balls being put into the car this
happened seven times(i must explain that you have to take the balls out
to be dropped again)my first reaction was that my older daughter was playing
in her sisters room and was very annoyed as it was gone 2 am.i got up and
went to my oldests room to find her sound asleep i then thought perhaps
my little girl had fell out of her cot but on checking her room she was
also fast asleep.the balls had been moved and there was nothing else it
could have been(the balls have a distinct sound)i still think my son came
back that night and many more nights when my daughters toys play by themselves.</b>
<br><b>i also dreamt one night that my grandfather who had died recently
came to see me and took me to a park and showed me a blond haired little
boy who he said was my son thomas,i thought no more of it as my son was
born with very dark hair as was his sister then when my daughter turned
1 her hair changed and she is now as blonde as the little boy i saw.i am
now convinced that this boy was my son and am pleased hes so happy.</b><b></b>

<p><b>I saw Things</b><b></b>

<p><b>For very many years, strange things have been happening in my family.
I am 19 years old living in the same house, but apparently, is not the

<br><b>Many ghosts have happened this way. Apparently they are ghost of
those people who recently died and they are confused.</b>
<br><b>My son inherited the facility to see. There are several things I
can tell you, because this house seems to be a Ghost hotel, or maybe is
not the house, maybe is just that they are looking for someone who see
them.</b>
<br><b>In an occasion it was in the kitchen when I felt a strong glance,
was a boy rin the framework of the door, watching to us fixedly, like trying
to discover if we were "The others". Later it walked by all the house treating
to attract our attention, until finally it resigned and one went away.</b>
<br><b>In another occasion, I listened to a strange noise and I went to
investigate, within the car was a died man looking at me, but I did not
do anything, I closed the door and walked to my room, but before going
to my room, I passed in front the room of my passed away grandmother and
listened again the noise, like which they make the hooves of the dogs when
walking, I saw a strange creature of 50 or 60 centimeters of a pink color,
with pointed ears and hooves instead of feet. I felt a cold sweat to cross
my body, and listened a woman to say "Help me, help me", suddenly I saw
to my grandmother shouting "Leave the room, leave the room", but I could
not move, then she shouted "Soul by soul" , suddenly she left and it embraced
to me, everything disappeared, I did not know what was exactly what happened,
to the day of today I follow confused, I do not know what was that creature,
if he were a demon, elf, but I know, that although I have not returned
to see it, still walks that way because I can feel it. And several things

<p><b>Ghost in my Apartment</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: NurseNays@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Alana, I'm a 30yr old female nursing student in Charleston,
WV. I am from Nashville, TN and about 3 yrs ago I encountered a ghost in
my apartment. I lived by myself with my Chihuahua Sophie in a very small
apartment, approximately 560 square feet. I moved in Sept. 20 and in October
I had a few small pumpkins and gourds by door outside. I lived on the backside,
hardly anyone ever came back there. One Saturday afternoon I left to run
some errands and was gone approximately 2 hours. When I returned home one
of my pumpkins was turned upside down. I didn't think much of it. A few
weeks later, a girlfriend was over and brought it to my attention that
one of my stereo speakers was turned upside down. I would have totally
noticed this when putting it together. A few months later, I returned home
from being gone all day. I came through the door, got on my cordless phone
with my Mom and as we were talking we kept getting interference, like someone
was picking up and trying to dial. As I'm sure you know, cordless phones
are notorious for cutting into someone else's conversation. So, I told
her we would talk later and I hung up. I went into my bedroom and my computer
was on and was trying to sign online. I NEVER leave my computer on, and
as you know, you have to click the icon and click "sign on" to get online.
I was very scared. Since my place was so small all I had to do was check
in my shower and my closet, nobody was there. It was then that I thought
maybe I had a ghost. Well, one night later, I honestly don't know how long
it was since these occurrences that it happened, I had a very, very vivid
dream. I dream a lot, about crazy, scary, real things all the time. I believe
dreams are from our soul and mean so much more than we know. Anyway, in
this dream it was as if things were exactly as they were......I was lying
in bed (my bed sat about 3 or 4 feet off the floor) and I was asleep, beside
my bed was a ghost, I don't remember much of what he/she looked like except
the fact it was smiling very mecheviously and it was taking it's arm and
running it behind my neck. Today this day I can still feel it behind my
neck. It repeated doing this and in "real life" I sat straight up and was
screaming, it was about 3:00 A.M. I knew that wasn't just a dream, I could
feel it. Needless to say I was spooked and I'm not sure when I went back
to sleep. The next day at work I asked a coworker who I knew was a strong
Christian to come over and pray, and she told me she knew of a gentleman
who had a gift of being able to talk to the other side and could actually
see them. The following Saturday, they came over, did their thing and I
never had any more problems. Since then, I'm very interested in the "Other
side" and I hope someday I can actually see one. Sorry my story was lengthy,
just wanted to get it all in.</b>

<p><b>Black Entity</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SEvelia51@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This story was told to me by my friend Maria (not her real name)&nbsp;
She grew up</b>
<br><b>in Santo Domingo.&nbsp; Maria was 14 years old and was living with
her aunt and</b>
<br><b>younger sister.&nbsp; She and her younger sister had moved out of
her father's home</b>
<br><b>because of domestic violence.&nbsp; Her father beat his wife, and
her step mother</b>
<br><b>beat her and her sister.</b>
<br><b>Maria's aunt's house was unusual in that the back fence of the house
was the</b>
<br><b>only thing that separated it from the local cemetery.&nbsp; Maria
was happy here</b>
<br><b>because she felt that at last she had found some peace in her life.&nbsp;
However,</b>
<br><b>that was not to last long.</b>
<br><b>Several months after moving in with her aunt, Maria was home from
school, it</b>
<br><b>was around 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon.&nbsp; She was sitting in
a chair on the back</b>
<br><b>porch reading a school book.&nbsp; Her sister had not yet arrived
from school and</b>
<br><b>her aunt would not be back from work until after 5:00 P.M.&nbsp;
Maria began to</b>
<br><b>feel very uncomfortable as if something was very wrong.&nbsp; She
suddenly had an urge</b>
<br><b>to look up, and her eyes were drawn to black smoke that seemed to
be coming</b>
<br><b>up from the ground on the far side of the cemetery.&nbsp; She thought
that was</b>
<br><b>strange because she saw no fire just this smoke.&nbsp; As she watched
to her horror the</b>
<br><b>smoke began to take on the shape of a tall well built man, with
no face but</b>
<br><b>two glowing orange eyes, that seemed to be looking right through
her.&nbsp; At this</b>
<br><b>point she decided she better get up and go inside the house.&nbsp;
But she couldn't</b>
<br><b>move, in fact she couldn't even blink her eyes.&nbsp; The "smoke
man" as she called</b>
<br><b>it began to slowly walk toward her.&nbsp; She could feel waves of
evil coming</b>
<br><b>toward her from this entity.&nbsp; She wanted to scream move anything
but she couldn't.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;She began to shake, sweat began to pour down her body and
tears down her</b>
<br><b>face, but she couldn't get herself to move.&nbsp; The entity was
now right in front of</b>
<br><b>her and she heard a voice in her head say "I have come to get you,
you are</b>
<br><b>mine."&nbsp; Than the thing grabbed her neck and began to strangle
her.&nbsp; Just before</b>
<br><b>she passed out from lack of oxygen she urinated on herself.</b>
<br><b>When she woke up she was covered in black bruises, and was in her
bed with</b>
<br><b>her sister and aunt trying to wake her up.&nbsp; They wanted to
know who had done</b>
<br><b>this to her so they could call the police.&nbsp; Her throat was
so bruised she could</b>
<br><b>hardly speak.&nbsp; But when she told them what happened, they didn't
believe her.</b>
<br><b>They thought she was having some kind of traumatic shock, that was
keeping her</b>
<br><b>from remembering what really happened. The police was called but
they really</b>
<br><b>didn't have much to go on except the Maria had obviously been badly
beaten.</b>
<br><b>Maria was taken to a doctor who prescribed tranquilizers. This however,
was not</b>
<br><b>the end of her ordeal in this house.&nbsp; About every three months
or so, she</b>
<br><b>would have nightmares that the "smoke man" was back, and when she
did she would</b>
<br><b>wake up full of black bruises again.&nbsp; After about the third
time this happened,</b>
<br><b>her aunt and sister began to believe her story but nobody knew what
to do</b>
<br><b>about it. Especially since nothing like this had happened in the
house before,</b>
<br><b>and she seemed to be the focus, because the entity did not bother
with anyone</b>
<br><b>else in the house. According to Maria, after she left the house
nothing happened</b>
<br><b>to anyone else in the house so for some reason she was the target.&nbsp;
Finally</b>
<br><b>they decided to move her to New York City with her mother.&nbsp;
That did stop the</b>
<br><b>violent night visits. However, every now and then she still has
the nightmares,</b>
<br><b>but thankfully does not wake up with any bruises</b><b></b>

<p><b>Some More of My Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dolls_eyes15@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have written to you before and so I thought I would send you some
more stories that really happened to me. Here is some short stories that
I will tell this time.</b>
<br><b>Victorian Man</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I woke up during the night and I saw a man at the foot of
my bed wearing victorian clothing and I could see every detail of his clothing.
He has a peach light around him and he had a mustache and a top hat and
his vest was peach color and he had a pocket watch and his suit was black
and he had these big brown eyes but he was not looking at me he was looking
out the window. I do not think he even knew I was there.</b>
<br><b>Frizzy Haired Women</b>
<br><b>I was about to go to sleep one night and I sat up to fix my bedding
when I turned to my left and at the side of the bed was a women that had
a fluffy blouse and she had frizzy hair everywhere and I could not see
her face but there was a light behind her and so that is how I saw her
hair everywhere and the outline of her blouse. She was so close to me I
could have just reached out and touched her... but I went to turn on the
side lamp and when I turned back around she was gone.</b>
<br><b>Women sitting on my bed</b>
<br><b>Well again I was sleeping and I was sleeping on my left side and
I went to turn on my right side when I saw the back of a women stand up
(like she was sitting on my bed) and she started walking to my door and
she just vanished.. but I remember she had short brown hair pulled back
in a low pony tail and she had on a peach dress or top.</b>
<br><b>Little Girl</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I have been seeing a little girl lately. She has blonde curly
hair and she always has a bright white light around her and she is always
floating.. she has a white dress on but I can never see past her shoulders
and the rest is like very flowing and she has big ringlets all around her
face and her hair is short. I am not sure if that is the same girl that
I have been having other experiences with.. Cause before this I have heard
a little girl crying in the hallway when no one else is there and I woke
up one night out of a deep sleep cause I felt a little girl whisper in
a very "listen to me" kind of voice and she whispered my name in my ear
but I swear I could feel her breath on my ear. Then another time I was
sleeping in the family room cause I had guest in my room and I could feel
some pressure on my knee like a little hand was on it. And when I looked
up nothing there then I went to go back to sleep and I felt someone stroking
my hair.. llike a little childs hand.. very gently.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I have many more but I will write more later If you want you
can put these on your web site. I hope that they are good. Opinions are
welcomed..Thanks again. Blessings</b><b></b>

<br><b>Queen Mary</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: miyas@hotpop.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>well, i went to stay the night at the queen mary for a summer vacation.
it was a really weird trip. it was Ali (thats me!),mom,and my friend korin
on the boat. that night we stayed, we wanted to go around just for a little
thrill. we sure got one. we walked down hallways and up stairs and through
doors and etc. while we were walking up one stair case, (Korin in front
of me and no one else) just before we hit the next deck, it got cold. we
both looked at each other, and we both knew we didnt want to go any further.
just before we decided to walk away, i felt two hands press against my
back. i started to flee down the stairs and back to our room. after recooperating
from that, my mom brought out the Ouiji board. us three sat down and asked
if there was a spirit amung us. there was. the plastic device moved so
freely and strongly accross the board. we continued to ask questions and
found out it was a woman named Maxine with children. thats about all "Maxine"
would say. the next day, Korin and i worked up the courage to go back to
the area where we ran from. we walked up the stair case again and finally
got up to the deck. there were two cases there, one empty and the other
with a wedding dress in it. it said that on that deck there were reports
of a lady in white dancing around in the open area. that kind of freaked
us out. as korin went to look at the other case a couple feet away, i felt
a hand grabbing my arm! "Dude! there is something grabbing me!" i screamed
just before i once again ran away. we relaxed a bit then korin talked me
into going back but with a camera. it took alot of convincing trust me.
well we went back (hesitently) and took a few pictures. i had korin take
a picture of me standing in the area where the "lady in white" was reported
dancing. we got the pictures developed and there was an orb right next
to me. pretty cool i should say. since then ive been taking alot of pictures
around my house and neighborhood. hundreds of orbes around this house alone.
i wish i knew exactly what they were, but my theory is that they are infact
a spirit in some way and they are looking out for us...or not. they could
just be havin an orb party for all i know. thanks for hearin my story.</b><b></b>

my aunt and her two&nbsp; daugters moved into this old house right off
things started happining&nbsp;&nbsp; like in the middle of the night the
tv would turn on but they figured since this was an old tv it was just
probably broken&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so they bought a brand new tv but
the same thing happened&nbsp;&nbsp; there stereos would just start blaring
for no reason so they came to the conclusion the house was haunted&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
well soon i was born and the moved in with us&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever
it was came with them because it kept happening at my old house&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
when they moved in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well i was about five years old our
hole family was outside when the stereo started blaring so my father turned
to my aunt and said tell you F#%$*^@ friend to go home after that it things
never happened when my dad was around but things still happened in the
night&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not long after that i was in the living room when
my remote to the remote controll car lifted into the air the car then began

<br><b>My Own Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hellraisers_maiden@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well, I'm not really sure if any of these things are ghosts or not.
I only know that they were weird. Some things involved things that happened
with my daughter, some things happened when I was younger, some when I
was older. All I know is that each of them really did happen.</b>
<br><b>I will start with something that happened when I was about 15 or
so. My sister and her husband were living in the house that she and I had
lived in as young kids. She was pregnant and one night she woke to find
the figure of a man standing at the foot of her bed. She tried shutting
and reopening her eyes, the way you do at night hoping that things look
different once you open your eyes again, but it did no good. The figure
was still there. She woke her husband up, and just as he reached for the
light switch, the figured disappeared. One night, her husband was out on
the road, and I spent the night there so that she wouldn't be alone. I
was sleeping on the floor at the end of her bed as she was still frightened
from that experience. In the middle of the night, I awoke to find a figure
of a man standing directly over me. I, too, tried closing my eyes and reopening
them hoping things would look different, but he was still there. Instead,
I pulled the blankets over my head and stayed that way til morning.</b>
<br><b>The next thing I can clearly recall is when I was 19. I was married
and living in O'Karben, West Germany. My daughter was only a couple months
old. We would lay on my bed in the mornings and just spend time together.
My daughter would always stare at the same spot above the doorway and laugh,
as though there were someone or something there playing games with her.
It kind of freaked me out at times.</b>
<br><b>My husband, my daughter and I returned to Maine in 1985. During
the summer of that year, I recall one instance that truly upset me. We
were in a pickup truck heading toward home. There was a full moon, and
my daughter was staring up at it, and she was mumbling something that I
can only describe as a "chant". I have always described it this way because
that is what it sounded like. She was only about 18 months old, and for
some reason that really scared me. I started crying and begged her father
to make her stop because she was scaring me, and even though I had called
her name many times, she seemed to be almost in a trance. After that, my
daughter would get really strange during a full moon. Many times, even
as she got older, she would freak out on a full moon.</b>
<br><b>Another time with my daughter was when we were heading for my mother's
house. All of a sudden, from the back seat, she said, "Mumma, we gonna
see Nana Perkins". I said, "No, honey, we are going to see Nana Folsom."
My daughter had probably only seen my grandmother, Nana Perkins, once or
twice in her little life. The shocking thing is, that when we arrived at
my mother's house, my grandmother was there. She did the same thing one
day when my husband told me to get in the car and wouldn't tell me where
we were going. We were headed down the road when all of a sudden my daughter
said, "We goin to Aunt Rhonda's". My husband looked at me quite shocked
and said, "How could she know that, I didn't even tell YOU where we are
going." I said, "Why, IS that where we are going?" and he said "yes".</b>
<br><b>Another instance that comes to mind, was one night when my husband
and I got into an argument and I slept on a mattress in my daughters bedroom.
Mine and my husband's bedroom was right across the hall from her. In the
middle of the night, I awoke to hear my daughter's breathing in the bed
beside me. I could hear my husband snoring in the next room....but I also
could hear two men talking out in the hallway, and above my head I heard
some really strange old music. Then I got chills that started at my head
and went to my toes, and then it was all gone except for my daughter and
my husband's sleeping noises. When I told my husband about this, he told
me that his grandfather used to keep a radio in the corner where I had
heard the music. Also, I had heard stories from my best friend that neither
she nor any of her family dared to go by the old house at night because
they could see an old woman in a rocking chair. The house we lived in had
been unoccupied for many years, and had belonged to my husband's grandparents.
The woman they described sounded like my husband's great-grandmother who
had died in the house.</b>
<br><b>Another time, I was putting together a puzzle that had belonged
to my husband's grandmother. I was picking up one piece after another trying
to find the one piece that fit in a certain spot. When I had gone through
all the pieces, I started over. As I picked up a piece and turned to try
it in the spot, the piece was suddenly already there. There were times
I would feel as though I wasn't alone in the house, and my children felt
it too. But I always tried to tell them that even if there was someone
there, that it would most likely be their grandparents, and their grandparents
loved them and wouldn't want to scare them so they didn't have anything
to worry about.</b><b></b>

<p><b>I Feel Silly</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: princessc7670@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, my name is Tammy. I am 28 yrs. old and I have two small stories
I would like to share. The first happened when I was 14 yrs old. My great
aunt passed away and I went to her funeral. I adored this lady. She helped
raise me. I slept in my mom's room that night after services were over
and the family had all gone home. I dreamt of my great aunt standing at
the foot of the bed with her hands pressed together in a praying position.
The expression on her face was very peaceful. I felt as though she were
telling me goodbye. When I woke the next day, my mom told about her dream.
It was the exact same dream I had! We had decided it was because we were
grieving the loss of our relative. I'm still not sure though.</b>
<br><b>The other incident happened when I was six yrs old. I lived next
door to a house that had a well, it had been closed off for a long time
but the ground around it was weak. My mom and various neighbors told my
friends and I to stay away from it, but like most kids we didn't listen.
I started having dreams about my grandfather(who died when I was 3 months
old) being down in a well and with no sound at all telling me to stay away
from the well. I knew it was him, it was like the voice was in my head..
I know the mind of a child is very creative, but now I continue to have
dreams about people and events. I have seen things in my dreams that come
true, people I have never seen before!&nbsp; I sense a presence rather
than see it for the most part. A cold draft, tingle on the spine,etc.</b>

please feel free to email me any time</b>

<p><b>EVIL??</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: erosas351@comcast.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; My story takes place in Chicago IL. Me, my husband and my
6 month old daughter moved into my mother-in laws house, they had a 2 flat
and we lived upstairs. Ever since I met my mother-in law she would tell
me about  Mr.Cokely*, the previous owner of the house which died from
a heart attack downstairs in the basement. She would tell me that he still
lived there and once in awhile she would see him,  I thought she was crazy.
The first night we moved in I closed all the doors bathroom, backdoor,
front door etc. the next morning EVERY door in the house was open. Another
time me and my husband were sleeping, and I woke up to hear 2 men talking
in the kitchen which was located right next to my bedroom, I sat up in
bed and was going to start yelling at my husband to keep it down, I turned
around and seen my husband sleeping next to me, I threw the blanket over
my head and eventually the voices went away. The next day I told my husband
what happened and he jokelingly&nbsp; it must have been MR. Cokely. I wasnt
the only one who had seen things in the house. One night my husband woke
me up and told me he seen a tall dark figure standing over my daughters
crib, and that the figure looked evil..I asked him what he meant by evil
and he wouldnt answer me..he said just evil  My husband doesnt believe
in the paranormal I didnt know what to think of what he seen except that
something was not right in the house, and I wanted to move as soon as possible.
One of the last few night in the house me and my husband were lying awake
in bed watching t.v , there was a LOUD knocking on the wall above our heads,
I threw the blanket over my head and told my husband to go see what it
was.he wouldnt get out of bed.. I think he was more scared than I was.
I went downstairs to see if my mother-in law was messing around with me
trying to scare meand no one was home. I always felt like someone was
watching me . I would see shadows in the kitchen,and in the front room,
my husband was the only one who saw something in our bedroom. Needless
to say we moved out, I would NEVER stay there by myself. I dont know if
there was evil or not but I believe there was more than one&nbsp; person
or ghost in that house. My mother-in law still tells me she hears and feels
Mr. Cokely.</b>

<p><b>About My Grandmother</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LrPapillion@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My grandmother passed away last year from a long term illness. Every
one of her children including my mother seem to know the exact moment she
passed and each of them described waking up at 3 am and feeling restless
and after what seemed forever a feeling of peace overwhelmed them and they
we're each able to go back to bed.&nbsp; At her funeral my cousins kept
describing how they each have felt grandma's presence before going to sleep.
Now I'm not saying I was jealous..okay maybe a little. but I guess she
knew how freaked out I would be if I felt her rubbing my back, like she
did to my older cousin Wanda. But I did start dreaming of her. One dream
was quit vivid. We we're sitting on her front porch snapping green beans
into a big huge orange bowel. I couldn't stop staring at her hands. She
kept reminding me of her wedding dress that was in her closet and I should
take it soon before someone else does. In 1996 she and grandpa renewed
they're wedding vows for there 50th anniversary and she told me she wanted
me to have her wedding dress. Well, I forgot about the dress until I had
to go back home and when I went to get it the dress was missing. I later
found out another cousin took it. I truly believe my grandma watches over
us. Specially her grandchildren. Another dream I had wasn't as vivid or
specific as the wedding dress one, In this dream grandma and I were at
a party where there was music and balloons falling down from the ceiling
and she was dancing and laughing looking healthy and happy and I felt unbelievable
joy and freedom watching her. When I woke up I was crying.&nbsp; I don't
know if this qualifies for your ghost story section.</b>

<br><b>Strange Vehicles</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: amadeus69@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Back in 1997, my college-aged friends and I would occasionally hold
late-night/early morning 'scavenger hunts' in our local area during our
summer breaks. The game involved us actively driving our vehicles to locations
somewhere within a 10 square-mile area, where we would collect the item
(usually at a well-known landmark) then head off to our next destination..
A 'neutral person' set the game up during the day- usually 5 items would
be the max. Speeding was not allowed (based on the honor system) The games
would usually start around 11 PM to midnight, and could last 2 or more
hours due to the large area.</b>
<br><b>On one occasion, this game involved four teams, each with a car
and 2 players. One or two persons hung out at the local donut shop where
we often hung out, awaiting the winner. On this night, one of our last
listed objects was determined to be located behind an recognizable memorial
at the rural Mt. Olivet cemetary.&nbsp; This is where my account occurs.
After we pulled the next clue from that memorial, we got back into my car
and began to drive towards the cemetary's exit. About 100 yards ahead,
we noticed 2 vehicles pulled off to the side of the cemetary's access road
(leading to the main road). Fearing they were police waiting for us, we
slowly drove up towards the cars and were hoping they would be merciful.
But as we got closer, we noticed that they were black, shiny,Cadillac-like
cars. We slowed down and we passed them on our right. When we glanced over
to see if the cars were occupied, we noticed that each car had 4 persons
apiece inside (2 in the front and 2 in the back). The strangest thing was
that all of the persons were quite elderly, dressed in suits and/or fine
clothing and appeared very pale. They did not move nor turn to look at
us at any point- they just stared straight ahead. The time was approximately
1:30 AM. Upon driving about a half-mile from the cemetary, we decided to
turn back out of curiosity. The cars had disappeared when we returned about
3 minutes later. I cannot say for sure if this event was paranormal, but
those cars and people certainly seemed out of place.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Siamese Cat "Isis"</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sharonb.burns@verizon.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Isis was my 14 year old Siamese cat who was a very friendly cat,
rarely leaving my side.&nbsp; I had to have her euthanized after she was
diagnosed with severe kidney failure.&nbsp; It was a very traumatic experience
for me and the family.&nbsp; Not long after, I felt what I thought to be
the only other kitty in the house jumping up on the bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; But
Tigger was nowhere to be found.&nbsp; I thought maybe I was taking too
many pain meds, so I didn't think a lot more about it.&nbsp; It happened
a few more times, then it occurred to me that it must be the spirit of
Isis visiting me.&nbsp; I have a very bad back and spend the majority of
my time resting in bed and do take a lot of meds, so I didn't want my family
to think that I had finally lost my mind.&nbsp; A week or so later, my
13 year old daughter came to me and said that she was feeling something
jumping up on her bed!&nbsp; I was so relieved, as was she when I told
her I was having the same experience.&nbsp; The remaining cat Tigger would
not come into my bedroom, if I carried him into the room, the minute I
put him down, he was out of the room like a light.&nbsp; This probably
went on for 3 or so months of and on.&nbsp; During the past week, Tigger
has started coming back into the bedroom, so I am guessing that Isis has

to me, but it sure has been a very real experience.&nbsp; I guess she is
really gone now, and I really miss her-I guess now for good.</b>

<br><b>It is just There</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: pthibaudeau@meiaerospace.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I am not sure if what we have is a ghost story or not but something
is going on and I just wanted to share it.</b>
<br><b>My wife passed away 3 years ago.&nbsp; We have three children, two
still living at home.</b>
<br><b>Within about 6 months of her death I started noticing activity in
the house when I was the only person home.</b>
<br><b>I literally can hear someone come in the front door and walk across
the living room and into the kitchen.</b>
<br><b>When I go upstairs to check it out, there is nothing and no one
there.</b>
<br><b>Several times I have been in our recroom watching TV and all of
a sudden there is a very violent pounding on the floor upstairs.&nbsp;
This has happened when the children are home and upstairs and they didnt
hear it, only me.&nbsp; When they are downstairs with me, then they hear
it also.</b>
<br><b>I have had someone or something pound on the exterior of the house
right were I was sitting and upon investigating outside there was no one
there.&nbsp; The frequency of these events seems to be increasing.&nbsp;
I really think that our noticing them is just increasing.</b>
<br><b>I had just gotten out of the shower one morning getting ready for
work and heard a&nbsp; very large crash in our garage.&nbsp; I figured
it was one of my kids taking our dog out in the morning.&nbsp; When I tried
to leave the house through the inner garage door. The door struck something
when I opened it about 3 or 4 inches.&nbsp; All of my power tool cases
had been stacked against the door from the outside and I had to push the
stack out of the way to get out the door.</b>
<br><b>What ever it is, it doesnt seem to be destructive.&nbsp; Its just
there.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Many places are haunted, I work as a security guard in one.&nbsp;
The Pinnacle Place Apartments, formally called The Peppertree is where

newspaper flipping, like someone is trying to read it, on the 13th floor.&nbsp;
I have felt an ominous feeling, like not being wanted, by the roof top
door.&nbsp; Car alarms have gone off for no apparent reasons when I have
been patrolling the underground parkade.&nbsp; On the 6th floor and the
11th floor, the lighting works, however, the hallway is always dim.&nbsp;
At present, on the 8th floor, one suite is hard to have tenants stay.&nbsp;
A man was thrown off the balcony in that particular suite.&nbsp; Another
suite remains empty on the 3rd floor.&nbsp; Howling winds are heard sometimes
in that suite.&nbsp; The rooftop and ground boiler rooms have a presence

<p><b>Utah A Haunting Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LAXDispatch@amadotrucking.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When my children were young my now X-husband moved us to Utah, by
Zion's. Well anyway we found a beautiful 4 bedroom 2 story 150 year old
house.&nbsp; 3 bedrooms were upstairs and at the bottom of the stair case
there was a door so you could close it off. The house needed some work
so we made a deal with the landlord to fix it up.&nbsp; Well the upstairs
was where we started.&nbsp; My children were 7 and 5 one girl (7) one boy.&nbsp;
The children had to sleep down stairs and this one night I told my daughter
that her brother will wake her up and want a glass of water.&nbsp; No matter
how much he bugs you do not get a glass of water.&nbsp; She agreed.&nbsp;
Well about 2am her brother wakes up and tells his sister he wants water.&nbsp;
She says no but he kept this up for ever it felt like so she and he goes
into the kitchen and my daughter knew that I put the plastic glass on the
bottom cabinet so she got one out turns on the water and out of nowhere
a very deep slow speaking voice that seemed to come from everywhere says
"Remember' my daughter threw that glass down and she and her brother ran
back to bed and threw the blankets over their heads.&nbsp; Next morning
they told us about it and they were so scared I had to tell them that there
father did it.&nbsp; But then things got stranger.&nbsp; Being from the
city we had a habit of locking our doors and we come home and the doors
were wide open and the dogs would be out.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dogs would look
up the stair case and bark and there wasn't anything there.&nbsp; My daughter's
room would get so cold that you could see your breath and she had a heater
in there.&nbsp; When I would be alone I would here walking heavy walking
and I would even get out of the shower calling my husband name thinking
he came home.&nbsp; My daughter refused to go into the house alone she
was so scared of it.&nbsp; One night I was up stairs and my husband calls
up to me "hey what are you doing up there moving furniture?" No I said
I'm watching T.V.&nbsp; He came upstairs and said no someone is moving
furniture I can here the banging.&nbsp; We looked around and there was
nothing.&nbsp; My husband began to ask question and rumor had it that no
one stayed in that house very long because strange things happened in it.&nbsp;
I personally liked the house a lot I wanted to buy it the ghost really
didn't bother me until.. We decided to go back to California because of
work.&nbsp; My father drove up and picked up the children.&nbsp; My husband
and I stayed back to pack up the place.&nbsp; 2 days before we left we
finished up everything and went to bed around 10pm.&nbsp; Around 3am something
woke me up and I noticed the light was on in my daughter's room, then I
saw him.&nbsp; Terror, pure terror. I was so scared I thought that my hair
turn white but it didn't.&nbsp; I tried so hard to move yell something
anything but I couldn't.&nbsp; I watched him walk into the room that was
my daughter and the door closed and the light went off.&nbsp; I felt as
all the air was being sucked out of me all I could do is close my eyes.
I then drifted off to sleep. I woke up like 6am and woke up my husband.&nbsp;
He noticed I was really rattled.&nbsp; He asked me what was wrong I told
him what I saw and so he checked everything.&nbsp; I explain I tried to
call out his name but nothing would come out.&nbsp; However my husband
did get a laugh out of it when he asked me to describe him.&nbsp; I told
him I could not see his face because his back was to me but he had long
hair brownish blond about mid back but he was built to the hilt.&nbsp;
My husband said that you all right to can be terrified but you still will
check it out.&nbsp; See he and I have had our own separates encounters
before we were married so he believed.&nbsp; Thank you for allowing me
to share this with you</b><b></b>

<p><b>Up Close and Personal</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: renouf@friendlygroup.com.au</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have read a number of ghost stories over the years, and have always
held</b>
<br><b>a certain intrigue with the shadow lands and "other side", in particular</b>
<br><b>the Egyptian concept of life after death.&nbsp; However my personal
experience</b>
<br><b>has diminished many of the theories I have read and lead me to believe
in</b>
<br><b>something much more sinister and un-nerving.</b>
<br><b>Although as a child i would have shocking nightmares it has not
been until</b>
<br><b>a few more recent events, 25 years later, that I have remembered
the</b>
<br><b>content of my childhood fears.</b>
<br><b>It seems many ghost stories associate a ghost with a place, or particular</b>
<br><b>event, and that the living only encounter the ghosts once they come
across</b>
<br><b>a present object or the place where events took place.&nbsp; My
story would</b>
<br><b>indicate otherwise and leads me to believe some spirits have ability
to</b>
<br><b>move much more freely than many believers suggest.</b>
<br><b>In the last place I lived i experienced what i can only describe
as an</b>
<br><b>'encounter" several times.&nbsp; It occurs while I am asleep to
begin with, but</b>
<br><b>usually wakes me up.&nbsp; AS i wake i find myself pinned to the
bed and unable</b>
<br><b>to move.&nbsp; The first time it happened I presumed it was a dream,
an that I</b>
<br><b>was somewhere between awake and asleep.&nbsp; However, even from
the first time</b>
<br><b>I did have a strange feeling of a female presence in my room.&nbsp;
I was also</b>
<br><b>sweating profusely when i woke.&nbsp; The second time it occurred
I found myself</b>
<br><b>pinned again, this time i remained much calmer.&nbsp; However, it
was the</b>
<br><b>presence of mind, to realize i should not panic, which first hinted
to me i</b>
<br><b>was indeed being pinned.&nbsp; Again, as i began free i was overtly
aware of a</b>
<br><b>presence hastily leaving.</b>
<br><b>The overall feeling I had was inexplicable to me.&nbsp; I still
believed that I</b>
<br><b>must be somewhere between awake and asleep, however, my doubt were
growing</b>
<br><b>that there was not another explanation.</b>
<br><b>Twice more whilst I lived in that house it happened.&nbsp; Each
time I was able</b>
<br><b>to control my senses more acutely, and by the forth time I became
aware</b>
<br><b>that the feeling of being pinned was not a general feeling, but
that I was</b>
<br><b>distinctly being held on my neck, arms and across my back, I could
control</b>
<br><b>my legs.&nbsp; This was the scare moment so far.&nbsp; I was able
to think clearly</b>
<br><b>and control parts of my body, yet for up to a minute I could not
move the</b>
<br><b>rest of my self.&nbsp; It was also on this forth time that as i
became free</b>
<br><b>several things hanging on the walls moved as if a breeze had impacted
the</b>
<br><b>room, yet I had not moved enough to create it.</b>
<br><b>Several weeks later I moved.&nbsp; Not because of the experiences,
but none the</b>
<br><b>less i moved.&nbsp; During the period I had told my girlfriend who
did not live</b>
<br><b>with me about the experiences.&nbsp; I had also mentioned that if
i were quizzed</b>
<br><b>about it, i would most defiantly say I believed a female presence
was in</b>
<br><b>the room. For almost 12 months now I have living with my girlfriend
and</b>
<br><b>almost forgotten about the experiences, until 2 nights ago.&nbsp;
I broke up</b>
<br><b>with my girlfriend on the weekend and spent the first night in my
bed alone</b>
<br><b>since I left the last house.&nbsp; I remember distinctly feeling
a presence in</b>
<br><b>my bed and waking up.&nbsp; I found myself pinned just as i had
been in the</b>
<br><b>other encounters, however this time, i was much more aware, far
more</b>
<br><b>awake.&nbsp; My eyes where open and i was lieing on my stomach and
i instantly</b>
<br><b>knew something had me on the bed.&nbsp; I tried to move my head
around but could</b>
<br><b>not for the life of me.&nbsp; After around a minute a forced the
words "get of</b>
<br><b>me bitch" out of my mouth and was able to roll over, as I did so
i felt the</b>
<br><b>presence moving away very rapidly and noticed again the posters
and clothes</b>
<br><b>hanging from the walls move with the breeze.</b>
<br><b>After the experience I felt some what invaded.&nbsp; I still do.&nbsp;
I must tell</b>
<br><b>you it is not like me to call a female a bitch, or anyone for that
matter,</b>
<br><b>and found it quite interesting that in the state i was in, waking
at 4am</b>
<br><b>that i distinctly said bitch, as if i knew it was a female.</b>
<br><b>I am sure many will say it is just a dream, and I am not yet awake,
but I</b>
<br><b>can be sure after this latest experience that I was most defiantly
awake,</b>
<br><b>and that I am most definitely experiencing something that defies
logically</b>
<br><b>explanation.</b>
<br><b>My plan is to set up a camera to watch myself sleep.&nbsp; I will
not need to</b>
<br><b>watch every night, but only once a again have the experience. Hopefully
I</b>
<br><b>will gain an insight into the reason, or possibility of a ghost
that does</b>
<br><b>not haunt a particular place, but a particular person instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And then</b>
<br><b>discover what use I am to her.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Kids in My Room</b><b></b>

<p><b>You may not beleive,but till this day I am still freaked about it.</b>
<br><b>I was about 14yrs old and my brother was 13yrs old we lived</b>
<br><b>in a town called beeville T.X .We stay in these apartment my brother

<br><b>I did'nt pay any mind to her and out to play. One day my brother

I did any way but there was nothing there. So I turned back around facing
the wall then I heard it again. I closed my eyes tight saying please go
away go away. The noise started getting louder Istarted breatheing heavier.
I the nerve to turn around the toy box was in the middle of the room at

<p><b>The Candle and Other Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: fawnibecca@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was alone at home and very depressed. As people do when depressed,
they chain smoke and this is what I was doing. After a while I looked over
at a speaker in the living room where a lone white candle stood, and because
it was white I decided that I would light it for positive energy. Since
I'd been lighting all my cigs by pressing them against the electric stove
burners, I had no way of lighting my candle. However, I was sure that if
I rummaged through the drawers in the kitchen, I would find matches or
an old lighter so I could light the wick. I left the living room for a
moment and walked to the kitchen to begin my fire search. After less than
five minutes I walked back to the living room and the candle was blazing!&nbsp;
Like I said, I was all alone and had been all day. This was not the only
thing we'd been through in that KY haunted house. One early morning when
everyone lay in bed, friends crashed on the floors in various bedrooms
and in the living room; I awoke because of the smell of frying bacon and
eggs.&nbsp; I heard the table being set in the kitchen, and silverware
set on the table. The clanking and the smells coached me out of bed and
I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes and headed down the hallway. All of our
friends had been partying and playing band music the night before, I couldn't
imagine o the generous breakfast maker in our home would be. I was anticipating
a surprise gift from my boyfriend. I met another curious and hungry face
who came stretching and yawning down the hall from another bedroom on my
way to the kitchen. We arrived at the empty kitchen table, already four
other sleepy heads were standing around the silent and empty dim kitchen,
confused with stomachs grumbling. Not one of us had been in the kitchen,
all the dishes were still in the cupboards, food in the fridge. We all
had been drawn to the kitchen by the smells and the sounds, each of us
wondering WHO was making breakfast! In this house, my daughter heard a
man calling her from the corner of the living room and noone was there.
She never slept in her own bedroom after five years in that home; the one
time she did I ran to her side in the middle of the night to save her from
a most horrible nightmare. I myself couldn't lay in her bed more than five
minutes without feeling overwhelmed by a presense that pushed me OUT. I
was always directed to leave the living room by 2 am if I stayed up late
on the computer. It was a pressure I couldn't ignore and I even said things
like, "I'm leaving, hold on!". People who spent the night on our couch
would wake up with dreams of ghost children running through the room; and
one man told us that he awoke to a man who stood over him and looked or
stared most of the night. Once my boyfriend came home and he, being a drummer,
started rapping his hands on the table. Suddenly, the wall behind the cupboards
from my daughter's bedroom closet rapped the same beat back. He did this
again, it rapped again. He was alone in the house. He looked down the hallway
and a silouette of a man glided across the hallway from my daughter's bedroom.
I was given many&nbsp; message dreams in that home; and knocking which
caused several confused people episodes were quite common there.&nbsp;
House Keys would go missing and turn up in very obvious places a few days
later; glasses would fly across the room and br k. Phone calls from our
one number would turn up on friends phones with messages from people and
voices we never could define; and the messages were odd, like "Hello, hello!
(unknown man) She's got the baby with her!(unknown woman)" left on my girl
friend's answering machine. It came from our home during the day my candle
lit by itself, I was alone in the house. The time of day would have been
while I was sitting in the living room staring at the candle; and came
from our one and only phone which was in the living room with me. We all
listened to that message several times, and I DID have my baby with me
that day.&nbsp; Despite the disturbances, there was also a warm feeling
that permeated our home which felt cozy and nice, like a positive presense
lived also. I read a book called Don't Call Them Ghosts, The Spirit Children
of Fontaine Manse, a true story by Kathleen Mc Connel which is the BEST
ghost book I've read, ever, and I've sifted through thousands of stories.
It had me laughing and crying and understanding finally about ghosts and
the afterlife. She also describes how ghosts can radiate both cold and
warmth to communicate emotion. I now realize that I experienced some of
this in our haunted KY home. That's all for now.</b>

<p><b>My Father</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sramos@bergeledson.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My father passed away 7moths ago due to kidney failure.&nbsp; Since
then my family and I have experienced many experiences such as the doors
opening and closing by themselves, the sound of dishes being washed and
many more.&nbsp; But this experience that my sister had was freaky but
nice.</b>
<br><b>One day on a Sunday afternoon me, my mother and my baby sister left
to run some arons.&nbsp; My older sister stayed home that day with my brother-in-law.</b>
<br><b>That night that we came back home and opened the door we heard my
sister crying.&nbsp; We quickly went in the living room where she was and
asked her what happened.&nbsp; She said she was laying down on the couch
and fell asleep.&nbsp; While sleeping she said that all of a sudden my
father appeared coming towards her to hug her and thanking her for being
with him as he passed on ( my sister was the only one with him as he was
agonizing and then passed on).&nbsp; He then told her that he was happy
where he was and to tell everyone that he is fine and he loves us and that
he is looking after us.&nbsp; All my sister would tell him is that she
loved him and not to go. She then said that she felt him as he hugged her
tight and he then said to her he had to go but to tell all of us to always
look on our right side that he will always be there standing.&nbsp; He
then walked back, waved and vanished. She said that during the whole time
she was crying.</b>
<br><b>My brother-in-law was standing by the window when he looked and
saw that "while she was sleeping" tears were running down her eyes and
she was moving alot.&nbsp; He then came to wake her up as he was worried
as to what was happening to her.&nbsp; When she awoke she started screaming
and crying more, more and more.&nbsp; He then asked her what happened and
she told him of the experience she just had. She said that it felt so real
that she told all of us that he is really with us and to always look on
our right hand side and his here now eventhough we cant see him but his
smell is here.</b>
<br><b>See when my father was in the hospital he had this odour that every
time when we went to see him and hugged him we would always smell it on
him.&nbsp; That same day when my sister had that experience the house was
filled with his odour. After his passing when we all would leave and we
came back to open the door and walk in, we sometimes could smell his odour
to be very concentrated all around the house and sometimes while at work
or in the car.&nbsp; We all get goosebumps but we know who it is and feel
good to know that it is my father.</b>
<br><b>I haven't told anyone of this story because I think they would think
I'm weird but it's true and till this day when my sister remembers this
experience, tears come down her eyes.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Can't Explain It</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:mescobar@ieua.org</b><b></b>
<p><b>When this first happened to me I just took it like nothing but when
it happened again, this time clearer I thought I should contact someone
to see why this is happening.&nbsp; It all started about a month ago, my
husband and I were just sitting in our room relaxing and we were watching
tv.&nbsp; Let me explain the situation, we had just purchased a brand new
puppy (a Shih-Tzu) in March and we have been training him to go on his
puppy pad.&nbsp; Well for some crazy thing our puppy loves to go into our
bathroom and go on his puppy pad, so we decided we would start from there.&nbsp;
This evening my husband forgot to put one down and as we were watching
tv, we seen him run to the bathroom like he normally does, so we both sat
up and yelled for him so my husband would have time to run over there to
put a pad down for him, as he got up towards the bathroom with the pad,
he noticed our puppy lying on my side of the bed sleeping, he just picked
up his head and looked at us like why were we yelling at him, he hadnt
done a thing but sleep.</b>
<br><b>We looked at each other and we couldnt explain why we saw what
we saw.&nbsp; So we kind of put that aside until just a week ago.&nbsp;
It was about 5am and I was getting up to go to work, nothing out of the
ordinary.&nbsp; Our pup usually sleeps with us on the bed so I knew I didnt
have to worry about stepping on him.&nbsp; I reached toward the nightstand
to grab my hair clip and get ready for a shower.&nbsp; When I sat back
up, I saw that my pup was up and looking straight ahead, and I noticed
he was staring at something, well, I told him to lay down and he ignored
me, so I looked into the direction he was looking at and there was a figure
of a dog.&nbsp; I kept looking at it thinking my eyes just needed adjustment,
I closed and opened again and he was still there.&nbsp; As I looked closer,
it was my old dog that had to be put to sleep last year (he was 14 years
old and a Shih-Tzu as well).&nbsp; He looked like he was barking but no
sound.&nbsp; My pup just kept on staring at him moving his head as though
he could hear him.&nbsp; I felt this strange feeling coming over me and
I just started to cry.&nbsp; I didnt understand why.&nbsp; I called to
him by his name and he just kept looking at my pup, I felt he was mad at
me.&nbsp; I tried to wake my husband but he is such a sound sleeper he
didnt move.&nbsp; After a while maybe about 2 minutes or so he disappeared.&nbsp;
I hear his noise he use to have when he came into a room, his collar had
a bell on it so I knew where he was.&nbsp; A couple of times my pup would
be playing on the floor, stop and started to bark into the air.&nbsp; We
dont know what to think of it because my other dog doesnt know where
I am at, he was in a different house.&nbsp; Do you know why this is happening?&nbsp;
Your help would be appreciated.</b>
