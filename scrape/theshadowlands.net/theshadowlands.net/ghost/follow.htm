<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">Can ghosts follow you from place to place?&nbsp;
I am asked this question 4-5 times a week.&nbsp; As a general rule, human
spirits normally do not follow people from location to location.&nbsp;
Most seem to be drawn to or attached to a building or area.&nbsp; They
will remain there regardless of who is living there.&nbsp; Some of the
occupants will know there is a spirit present and others, who are less
sensitive, will not.&nbsp; The location could have been the spirits home,
a favorite place or the scene of it's death.&nbsp; There are a few exceptions
to this rules and a few of them are as follows:</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"><U>Relatives:</U> Deceased relatives may return
to visit the living and they are not bound by location.&nbsp; Even an earthbound
relative who has remained here for reasons that link it to a living relative
may follow that person.&nbsp; Spirits of close friends also fall into this
category.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"><U>Sensitives or Psychics:</U> People who are
sensitive to spirits may have encounters in different location.&nbsp; Often
these people assume that the first place they lived was haunted and the
spirits have followed them to a new home.&nbsp; What may be happening is
that the person is sensitive to spirits and they are now seeing new spirits
in this new location.&nbsp; Many people are unaware that they are sensitive
and just assume that these places are haunted.&nbsp; Spirits are everywhere,
and they are drawn to people who are sensitive to them.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"><U>Haunted Objects:</U> Spirits can also be
attached to objects.&nbsp; It could be a favorite chair, family heirloom,
anything that person valued greatly in life.&nbsp; Antique dealers often
come across items that people claim are haunted.&nbsp; If the spirit in
your home is attached to an object and you take that object with you when
you move, the spirit comes along too.</FONT></B>
