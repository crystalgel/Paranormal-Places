</H3><P><B>by kelpie@erols.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello,</B>
<P><B>You posted my story "Angela" on 8/1/97.  I have an amazing update to</B>
<P><B>that story.  Actualy, these events took place even before you posted

my</B>
<P><B>story, but anyhow... here goes.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Somewhere in the area of June... Angela appeared in my room.  Keep
in</B>
<P><B>mind that I no longer live in Richmond, where I first met her.  She</B>
<P><B>informed me that she had been "released" from the house she had

haunted,</B>
<P><B>there.  She was basically given a choice, move on to the other side,

or</B>
<P><B>stay here as a spirit guide.  When I say "spirit guide", I don't mean

a</B>
<P><B>spirit who guides people.  I mean a spirit who guides other lost

spirits</B>
<P><B>to the other side.  She chose to stay, and visits me on a regular

basis.</B>
<P><B>So... my old friend is back :)</B>
<P><B>Ocassionaly she brings other spirits with her.  Often it's ones that</B>
<P><B>feel a need to communicate with the living, one more time, before

they</B>
<P><B>go.  So far, none of them have asked me to do anything for them</B>
<P><B>(although, years before I met Angela, the ghost of guy who drowned
in a</B>
<P><B>nearby river asked me to go find his body... that was kind of

creepy).</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyhow, that's it for now... two friends reunited in a happy ending

<H3><A NAME="my house">My House is Haunted</A>
</H3><P><B>by mutthemutt@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi,my name is Christopher Bohar and Ibelive that my house is</B>
<P><B>haunted.Since I am only 12 years old nobody really wants to believe

me</B>
<P><B>but I'll tell you right now that there is ghost in my house.That

house</B>
<P><B>freaks me out sometimes.Alot of inncidents have happened in my house</B>
<P><B>ever since we moved in.My brother Eric and I are the only ones who</B>
<P><B>really believethatthehouse is haunted.A few of my friends believe me</B>
<P><B>too.I'll tell you a few inncidents that happened in my house over the</B>
<P><B>years.One night Patty who used tobe one of my neighbors was at my</B>
<P><B>house.She told me that sheand my brother were sitting on the basement</B>
<P><B>steps and were talking.Patty said that she saw a black shadow shaped</B>
<P><B>like a man walk to the side of the staircase.When it dissapeared</B>
<P><B>sheasked my brother if he saw what she saw but my brother said that

he</B>
<P><B>didn't see anything standing next to the staircase.Another time my</B>
<P><B>friend Geoffrey came over my house.We began to walk upstairs where
my</B>
<P><B>bedroom is and we saw a black blob-like figure moving down the</B>
<P><B>stairs.Well,me and Geoffrey ran straight out of the house and

half-way</B>
<P><B>up the block.We don't know what it is but it scared us.My dog Muttley</B>
<P><B>will sometimes get up and bark and growl like something is near her

but</B>
<P><B>I don't see anything near her.Sometimes lights get turned on and off</B>
<P><B>which I can't explain.Things will get lost like they were hidden and</B>
<P><B>then show up again.The ghosts only seem to be in certain parts of the</B>
<P><B>house.Sometimes I feel like somebody is watching but nobody is

there.I</B>
<P><B>also feelcold spots in the house where there are no vents or open</B>
<P><B>windows.I makesurethat my dog is with me so that I have some

company.I</B>
<P><B>also took a photo of what seems to be a ghost.That day my brother and

I</B>
<P><B>went fishing and I took one of those disposable cameras along to take</B>
<P><B>photos of the fish we catch.We were fishing down atthe canal at the

time</B>
<P><B>and my brother caught a big Trout so I took a photo of the fish as
he</B>
<P><B>held it up.We got the photos developed and the one with my brother</B>
<P><B>holding a Trout was weird.Next to my brother was a blob of glowing</B>
<P><B>light.It couldn,t have beenthe sun becauseI remember it was a hazy

day</B>
<P><B>outside.I havehadmany other encounters with whatever haunts my house

but</B>
<P><B>Ican't possibly tell them all at once.I don't know if I am seeing

things</B>
<P><B>but I know that there is something in my house.</B>

<H3><A NAME=watching>Grandma's Watching!</A>
</H3><P><B>by Jonas_Rushman@usairways.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My maternal Grandmother passed away when I was five years old. She
was the</B>
<P><B> embodiment of the stern-faced</B>
<P><B>but always cheerful German woman.  She and my Grandfather lived in

the</B>
<P><B>farmhouse across the road from our</B>
<P><B>farm.  A short jaunt along the beaten old driveway would bring me to</B>
<P><B>Grandma's house.  The half-mile trek was</B>
<P><B>worth it for the fresh-baked cookies, lemonade and all the love a

five</B>
<P><B>year-old could handle.  My Grandfather</B>
<P><B>had a penchant for the bottle, but Grandma still gave him all the love

she</B>
<P><B>gave us kids.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night, when I was about eight or nine years old, my brothers and
I were</B>
<P><B> awakened around 3AM by such</B>
<P><B>a commotion as we had never heard.  My Mother was yelling for my Father

to</B>
<P><B>wake up. The dog was yelping</B>
<P><B>and whimpering.  Then we could hear my Father yelling to my Mother

"Stay</B>
<P><B>with the boys!"  My Mother is deaf</B>
<P><B>and does not sleep with her hearing aid, so he had to yell.  But where

was</B>
<P><B>he going?</B>
<P>
<P><B>We three boys came charging out of our bedroom to see what was going

on.</B>
<P><B>My Mother was a nervous wreck</B>
<P><B>and would not or could not tell us anything. My Father had already
gone out</B>
<P><B> the door. The dog was still</B>
<P><B>whimpering and hiding behind the sofa.  She was scared to death!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Several anxious hours later my Dad came home blackened by coal soot

and</B>
<P><B>still visibly shaken.  My Mother,</B>
<P><B>nearly hysterical, smothered him in hugs and kisses. He then proceeded

to</B>
<P><B>tell us what happened. Here is</B>
<P><B>the complete story:</B>
<P>
<P><B>My Mother woke to a light in their bedroom.  Again, since she is deaf,

her</B>
<P><B>alarm clock has a flashing light to</B>
<P><B>wake her. She is regimented to awake to light. She awoke to see the

glowing</B>
<P><B> figure of my Grandmother</B>
<P><B>standing at the foot of their bed, motioning "Come with me" with her

hand.</B>
<P><B>  That is when my Mother started</B>
<P><B>yelling to wake my Father.  Once they were awake, the apparition

walked</B>
<P><B>past their bed out into the living room.</B>
<P><B>That is when the dog caught sight of it and went screeching behid the

sofa.</B>
<P><B>  It went through the living room and</B>
<P><B>dining room and through the front door, all the while motioning "Come</B>
<P><B>along!".  Yelling for my Mother to stay</B>
<P><B>with us boys, my Dad followed the spectre of his departed Mother out

into</B>
<P><B>the night.  He follwed her all the way</B>
<P><B>along the old driveway, to my Grandfather's house where she disappeared

at</B>
<P><B>the front door.  Upon entering the</B>
<P><B>house, my Dad found it filled with oily, black coal smoke.  My

Grandfather</B>
<P><B>was unconscious on the kitchen floor,</B>
<P><B>with his dog, also unconscious, beside him. My Dad managed to drag
the both</B>
<P><B> of them out into the fresh air.</B>
<P><B>It appeared that in a bout of intemperance, my Grandfather had knocked

the</B>
<P><B>flue off the old pot-bellied coal stove</B>
<P><B>in his kitchen.  The carbon monoxide would have taken him shortly had

my</B>
<P><B>father not arrived when he did.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My Mother later confessed that when my Grandmother was motioning "Come

with</B>
<P><B> me", she construed it to mean</B>
<P><B>"Come with me to the great beyond!"  All the while we were waiting
for my</B>
<P><B>Father to come back, she was thinking</B>
<P><B>she had seen the last of him!  We went back to bed in the grey light

of</B>
<P><B>dawn knowing Grandma's watching!</B>

<P><B>This story is not my story ,My friend's brother told it to us one

night</B>
<P><B>10 years ago.I didn't belive the story until recently and it goes

like</B>
<P><B>that...</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night 10 years ago ,I spent the night at my friend's house.</B>

<P>
<P><B>My friend's brother and two of his friends went to a pub in the city.</B>
<P><B>While coming back home (a bit drank...) they have spotted a naked

girl</B>
<P><B>on the road.Now you have to understand that this is a main road but
it </B>
<P><B>leads to far places and remote areas.They stopped the car because

they</B>
<P><B>wanted to help her.They thought she was raped or something.</B>
<P><B>My friend's brother gave her his coat and she asked them to drive her

to</B>
<P><B>a near by kibutz.All the way she didn't talk.When they got there she</B>
<P><B>said thank you and ran into a house.They wer about to leave ,When hr</B>
<P><B>remembered she still had his coat.</B>
<P><B>So he knocked on the house door.</B>
<P><B>An old man opened the door...</B>
<P><B>My friend's brother asked about the girl.</B>
<P><B>The old man said he doesn't know much ask him to come with him.</B>
<P><B>They went to the kibutz cemetery.</B>
<P><B>There on one of the graves lied the coat.</B>
<P><B>Of course he took the coat and ran like hell from there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I didn't belive it until recently i heard on a late night radio show

the</B>

<P><B>To the house.</B>
<P><B>To the grave...and on the grave was a coat...I don't know whose</B>

<H3><A NAME=fact>A Childs Ghost, After the Fact</A>
</H3><P><B>by RondaIee@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I know the content of the previous posting, happened years ago, but
since the day I posted  the story of"A childs Ghost", all of sudden, my daughter

feels there is "something" here. I heard a strange noise from upstairs. kind
of a  "Mmmm, mmmmm.mmmmm" sound, in repetition, picture a child rocking back
and forth and repeating this sound, thats what I heard. I checked, though
I knew I was the only one here, I peeked out doors, and asked my daughter
if anyone had made that sound&lt;though I know it came from indoors&gt; she
was playing alone.  My dog Katie &lt;who if dogs can be soulmates, shes mine,
Id swear she was a person in a past life!::grin:::&gt;, ran up the steps,
we have a loft, the only room upstairs is Jennifers &lt;my child&gt;, and
the dogs arent aloud up there, because we also have a cat, who's litter box
is up there,&lt;dogs like to get into litter boxes&gt; So when she ran up
there, and didnt even glance the litter box, I knew I had indeed heard the
sound from up there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>      2 days pass, I hear the sound again, but this time, outside,
at my backdoor, I look, but no one is there, and whether related or not,
I got a nosebleed during both times I heard the sound.</B>
<P>
<P><B>          I consulted a friend, who knows more of these things than
I, and he says this is a bad thing. He feels there is no way its Karen, and
feels strongly, that after saying goodbye, Karen went to the light. His fear
is, that somehow, in my retelling the story, dwelling on the ghosts, Ive
opened the door, and a new ghost is here, likely not a child,  but pretending
to be, in order to find my weak spot, and allow it to truly come in.</B>
<P><B>                           This all so strange, Im not sure what I

think.</B>

<H3><A NAME=indian>The Indian Summer</A>
</H3><P><B>by MakLinnen@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is my personal story about what happened in my house almost 14
years ago. For me it was the start of a life time of experiences.</B>
<P><B>It all started in the fall of 1981 I was 10 or 11 years old at the
time, it was a nice day and my father had gone out to the garden to till
for the fall and prepare for the next spring.  I remmber ( like it was yesterday)
sitting at the table looking into the back yard I saw my father stop and
lean down and retreive somthing from the dirt.  A few min later he came in
and showed us a rare find... It was a perfect and I mean PERFECT arrow head
! It had no chips and no signs of age we all thought it was real neat!</B>
<P><B>A few days later after the arrow head was forgotton I was sleepong
in my room my parrents were both on the sofa in the living room when they
 heard footsteps comming up the basement stairs.  Now, on the stairs  my
dad had a colection of License plates from around the states so when you
walked up the stairs it was noisy to say the least.</B>
<P><B>My father thinking it was me told me " Go back to bed" when the steps
did not stop he got up and opened the door to the basement... Nothing, he
than when to my room I was sound asleep.</B>
<P><B>Not long after that things got worse, Objects seem to have minds of
their own and would fly off and nearly hit people.  Strange disembodied voices
would call my mothers name and would often say "GET OUT".</B>
<P><B>The worst thing was when my mom ( who was a neat freak) would clean
the living room or other rooms ( seemed to happen in the living room the
most)  she would move stuff and be hit with the worst smell as she put it
when asked " It smelled like death or decay" ( she would know for she worked
at a med school )</B>
<P><B>She had, had enough and brought the arrow head ( now knowing that it
our haunting friend had somthing to do with it) to a psyic freind of hers
.  Nancy held it and as she did ( i know this sounds wierd) she felt a pulse
in it and right before everyones eyes it started to chip.</B>
<P><B>My mother not long after that now fearfull and just wanting things
to stop thought if she put it back it may stop ( IT being our ghostly presence).
She took it out to the spot and put it back but only after a few hours she
went back to get it for she could not stand leaveing it out there.  She said
aloud that she ment it no harm and then put it up.  After that we had no
more BAD things happen it seemed that the ghost had somhow trusted my mom.</B>
<P><B>Things though did happen after that for although i was never the "butt"
of the hauntings from that ( the arrow head) I was the "butt" of other things.
 Most good but some raised the hair on my neck.</B>
<P><B>Over the years I had married and moved around a lot as my husband was
in the service and it seemed that where ever we went I had some kind of
experience.  Agian most were good .</B>
<P><B>Now If your wondering, Yes we did TRY to find out about the arrow head
and the ghost the most we could find out is that Indians did Inhabbit the
area and about 3 miles from the location of my home over the years many skulls
and bones are recovered as well as arrow heads ect.  So who knows we may
never know but I do know that this is TRUE I would have never belived any
of it had it not happened to me.</B>
<P><B>Oh one short  side note, several of my freinds over the years have
experenced the ghost/ ghosts in the house and many wont stay inc my husband
who always felt "funny" about it.</B>
<P><B>The house is located in Michigan by Lake Erie.</B>

<H3><A NAME=mom>Mom's Stories</A>
</H3><P><B>by deborah.wasserman@Sun.COM</B>
<P>
<P><B>My mother told me these stories, she said there true.</B>
<P><B>My aunts verified that they are true, when I asked her about it.</B>
<P><B>(I was checking)</B>
<P>
<P><B>#1  (1940's)</B>
<P><B>When my mom was about 15 teen years old, her and her sisters</B>
<P><B>needed to use the bathroom, they lived on a ranch out in</B>
<P><B>Biola, California, my grandpa was a ranch hand. Anyways</B>
<P><B>my grandma used to feed just about everybody who lived</B>
<P><B>close to them, mostly the weekends she'd make big pots</B>
<P><B>of meats, tortillas etc (we're hispanic). On this one nite,</B>
<P><B>after all the neighbors left to go home,</B>
<P><B>my mom said it was about 1 in the morning, they had to </B>
<P><B>go  use the outhouse, no indoor plumming, which was alittle</B>
<P><B>ways from the main house. She said the moon was out just</B>
<P><B>enough to lite the way, It was a little windy too.</B>
<P><B>When they were half way to the outhouse they looked up </B>
<P><B>and saw some one walking towards them down the path that</B>
<P><B>lead from the road, thinking it was their neighbor, who had </B>
<P><B>left something at their house earlier that nite. My mom &amp; her
sisters</B>
<P><B>stopped to wait for him, they even waved to him. She said the</B>
<P><B>figure was wearing a long coat,with the lapels up and gloves, </B>
<P><B>also a big black hat, with a wide brim, they couldn't see his face.</B>
<P><B>they stood there chit chatting, wishing he would hurry up,</B>
<P><B>it was cold. When the man got closer they all turned to say</B>
<P><B>hi and got a good look at him.  they still could not see a</B>
<P><B>face but when they look down at his feet, there were none,</B>
<P><B>the leaves were just swirling around where his feet were</B>
<P><B>suppose to be. They screamed and ran home with the figure </B>
<P><B>following, as fast as they could. My grandpa checked and</B>
<P><B>found nothing. My grandma said the rosery that nite.</B>
<P><B>My mom said they still don't know who or what that was</B>
<P><B>and will never forget it.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>#2   Different house...(1940's)</B>
<P>
<P><B>My grandfather, who liked his beer, used to drink </B>
<P><B>from what I hear alot, my grandma used to make</B>
<P><B>homemade beer to try and keep him home. Ok, even</B>
<P><B>the cops knew him, instead of jail they used to </B>
<P><B>bring him home "Mrs Juarez, we have Ireno again".</B>
<P><B>Anyway there were also times that my grandfather</B>
<P><B>would  drive himself home. For about a year in</B>
<P><B>this one house my grandfather said he would be driving </B>
<P><B>along and about a block from his house he would see</B>
<P><B>fire engulfing the house, he would get sober real fast</B>
<P><B>and drive home faster, he said once he would get to</B>
<P><B>the house the flames would move to the backyard, when</B>
<P><B>he would walk/run to the back yard the fire would disappear</B>
<P><B>into thin air. My grandfather would come in the house</B>
<P><B>chalk white and scare. My mom said that finally my</B>
<P><B>grandfather couldn't take anymore and they moved,</B>
<P><B>he thought it was a omen of some kind,  </B>
<P><B>nobody else would see this, they thought he was just drunk,</B>
<P><B>So of course he was not believed.</B>
<P><B>A year later, after they moved, they heard that the new </B>
<P><B>owners were digging in the back yard for a well or something</B>
<P><B>and they found 2 kegs (little) full of old coins worth a </B>
<P><B>mint in those days. To this day my mom believes that </B>
<P><B>the ghost fire was trying to tell my grandfather to dig </B>
<P><B>in the back yard, instead they moved. </B>

<H3><A NAME=move>Our Move into a 1820 Circuta Home</A>
</H3><P><B>by pmoore2@plainfield.bypass.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Until our move into this lovely old house in Southern New Hampshire
we</B>
<P><B>never thought about ghosts.  But, did we have them.</B>
<P><B>   Prior to moving into this old colonial home, my mom stayed there
and was</B>
<P><B>along with an old friend, helping us get the wall paper stripped and</B>
<P><B>painting done.  Our move into the house was late May, it was warm and
no</B>
<P><B>need for heat.  However, one morning very early, which is unusual for
mom,</B>
<P><B>since she was a late sleeper, she called us at the house we were
moving</B>
<P><B>from.  To ask if we had left the forced hotwater furnace on.  No, we
didn't</B>
<P><B>mom, why?  I'll tell you when you get here.  Well, she heard the
water</B>
<P><B>going through the pipes and the pipes were hot, then she noticed a
very</B>
<P><B>tall woman standing next to the thermostat, she turned slightly and
looked</B>
<P><B>over at mom and disappeared.</B>
<P><B>  Later when we moved in, there was a lot happening, involving myself,
and</B>
<P><B>the children.</B>
<P><B>The youngest child when we moved was only 2 months old, by summer we
would</B>
<P><B>have the windows open and the cool breeze would help us sleep.  One</B>
<P><B>evening, around 7 or 7:30 I had just put the youngest to bed, and his
crib</B>
<P><B>was on the driveway side of the house, he began crying.  Mom, was
outside</B>
<P><B>and tried not to let the crying bother her but kept commenting on how
he</B>
<P><B>needed to be picked up or changed or maybe a drink of milk or water
would</B>
<P><B>help.  I told mom, just leave him alone, he has been fed, and changed
and</B>
<P><B>he would have to go to sleep.</B>
<P><B>   Mom, disappeared and I could hear,  shhhh shhhh shhhh.  Oh, boy,
mom is</B>
<P><B>in the room after expressly telling her not to bother with the baby.
 As I</B>
<P><B>approached the bedroom I could hear the mattress squeeking as it would
if</B>
<P><B>someone was gently pushing it down and releasing it, this continued
until I</B>
<P><B>rounded the doorway....mom was outside (ground level - I was on the
second</B>
<P><B>floor) talking with my husband.  She could not have gotten
downstairs,</B>
<P><B>without me seeing her.</B>
<P><B>   Another insodent, my oldest son asked his friend to stay over. 
The next</B>
<P><B>morning at 5:30 I had got up and there was my son's guest standing
outside</B>
<P><B>on the driveway.  Come on in and I'll make breakfast.  No, tell James
that</B>
<P><B>I'll call him later.</B>
<P><B>   It was years later, before I ever knew what had happened.  We had
an old</B>
<P><B>adding machine in the rear bedroom, one that you had to push the
buttons</B>
<P><B>then pull down the handle to make it work.  Well, all night long, the</B>
<P><B>adding maching was being made to work, and the guest waited until it
was</B>
<P><B>light enough outside so he could see to leave the house.</B>
<P><B>   There are more stories about this house, that I just do not have
time to</B>
<P><B>write about now.</B>

<H3><A NAME=ghost>Ghost Happenings</A>
</H3><P><B>by rkiefer@soundcom.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>First of all, the stories about my home. There were several of them.
1st:</B>
<P><B>about 4 or 5 yrs old, I had had a collie who died. Several months later,
I</B>
<P><B>was playing outside with some cars when  I heard a dog panting. My
home is</B>
<P><B>on brick pillars, about 2 ft off the ground. I looked around, but
didn't</B>
<P><B>see anything. The panting continued until it sounded like it came
from</B>
<P><B>right behind me. Needless to say, I fled in terror. 2nd: My grandfather
had</B>
<P><B>died about two weeks before this happened, and I was still in shock
and</B>
<P><B>mourning. I was up late on night, and i noticed mist coming inot the
house.</B>
<P><B>After it seemed like there was a couple of inches in, I observed a
humanoid</B>
<P><B>shape to appear rising out of the mists. This happened 2 or 3 times.</B>
<P><B>3rd: I had a cat who I loved and who died of a derivitive of feline</B>
<P><B>leukemia. He used to sleep at the foot of my bed. A couple of days
after he</B>
<P><B>died, I was in my room missing him, when I felt something about his
size</B>
<P><B>jumping up on the bed and starting to purr. When I looked down there,
there</B>
<P><B>was nothing visible. It seemed like he had returned to say goodbye
and to</B>
<P><B>ease my pain.</B>
<P><B>	For the second story, I wasn't there, but I heard about it from my
pastor</B>
<P><B>and various others at church. My church was the second one of its
name</B>
<P><B>built, and the first one had been turned into a museum. Where the
altar</B>
<P><B>once stood however, there was a plaque marking three priests burial
places.</B>
<P><B>They had not been given a proper funeral because they had died of
smallpox</B>
<P><B>and just quickly buried so the disease would not spread. My church
pastor</B>
<P><B>decided to rebury them, this time in a graveyard with a proper funeral.
At</B>
<P><B>the funeral, several people noticed them standing at the back just
watching</B>
<P><B>their funeral. It seemed like the were giving their approval. Email
me if</B>
<P><B>you have any questions, comments, etc. My address is
rkeifer@soundcom.net,</B>
<P><B>call me corsair.</B>

<H3><A NAME=sounds>Ghostly Sounds</A>
</H3><P><B>by faithful@flash.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have some very vivid memories of things that happened to me</B>
<P><B>when I was a youngster. In these occurences, there were always</B>
<P><B>witnessess.</B>
<P><B>        My dad was killed in a train/truck collision in 1968 when I
was</B>
<P><B>ten. A week after his funeral, my mom and I were staying at my
maternal</B>
<P><B>grandparents house but on this particular night, they were out runing</B>
<P><B>some errends.  I was in the living room where the TV was and my mom
was</B>
<P><B>in the kitchen writing a letter to my dad's mom when all of a sudden
I</B>
<P><B>heard this scream that was right in my ear.  It was a man's scream
that</B>
<P><B>was short but sounded as if it lasted forever.  I walked into the</B>
<P><B>kitchen where my mom was and she said I was white as a sheet. She
told</B>
<P><B>me that she had heard the scream also and that she somehow thought
it</B>
<P><B>was me because she had told me to "shut up" but I didn't hear her say</B>
<P><B>that.  We both stood in the doorway waiting, cowering, until my</B>
<P><B>grandparents arrived.</B>
<P><B>          But now the kicker.  About two years later, same house, my
mom</B>
<P><B>and I were there along with my aunt and cousin. It was nightime again</B>
<P><B>and my cousin and I were in one of the bedrooms in the back of the
house</B>
<P><B>listening to a conversation that my uncle and aunt were having over
the</B>
<P><B>phone. My mom and aunt were both in the kitchen.  Then, just like in
one</B>
<P><B>of the movies, we heard this loud ooooing.  My cousin and I looked
at</B>
<P><B>each other with eyes as big as sausers. I slammed down that phone and
we</B>
<P><B>both ran into the kitchen as fast as we could.  When we arrived, my
aunt</B>
<P><B>asked me why I had made such a noise into the phone when of course,
I</B>
<P><B>hadn't. But as soon as she asked the question, it happened again. We</B>
<P><B>were scared to death, all of us. We had a Manchester terrier in the</B>
<P><B>house at the time who was standing there it the hallway stiff as a</B>
<P><B>board, growling bigtime with the hair on his back standing straight
up</B>
<P><B>as he looked into the bedroom from which my cousin and I had ran. The</B>
<P><B>oooing was just like you would expect a ghost to sound and it sure</B>
<P><B>didn't dissapoint us.  The sound happened two more times for a total
of</B>
<P><B>four and you knew that you knew you were hearing a ghost. Needless
to</B>
<P><B>say, all four of us stood in the doorway waiting for the same</B>
<P><B>grandparents to come home. These are not the only things that
happened</B>
<P><B>to me from the paranormal but when I became a Christian, they all</B>
<P><B>stopped.  I am not going to preach to you but I am going to give you
an</B>
<P><B>option to think about.  I believe that these things people believe
to be</B>
<P><B>spirits of the dead are not that at all but are demons.  Being that
they</B>
<P><B>have been around for thousands of years and they are able to be
present</B>
<P><B>throughout your life they are more than capable to convince you that</B>
<P><B>they are some long dead relative or a civil war soldier.  They are</B>
<P><B>intelligent and they are evil.  If they can take you off course from
God</B>
<P><B>with a few parlor tricks, they will.</B>
<P><B>                                        In Christ,</B>
<P><B>                                        faithful@flash.net</B>

<H3><A NAME=knocker>Mystery Knocker</A>
</H3><P><B>by pami@frontiernet.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night last week my husband and I both are resting together on the
couch</B>
<P><B>at about 12:30am.  We had all the doors locked and almost ready to
go to</B>
<P><B>bed when I heard a faint set of knocks on the inside of the front
entrance</B>
<P><B>door.  I ignored it at first thinking I must be crazy or very over
tired. </B>
<P><B>I then noticed that my cat was asleep and woke up and studied the door
as</B>
<P><B>well.  I then looked at my husband who also heard the same knocks.
 The</B>
<P><B>outside screen/storm door never opened or closed.  We didn't open the
front</B>
<P><B>door but my husband hurried upstairs to see who was on the porch and
nobody</B>
<P><B>was there.  My husband's mother died front post surgical problems as
she</B>
<P><B>locked into a stroke in August last month and we live across the
street</B>
<P><B>from a very large beautiful cemetery which has never given us any scare
or</B>
<P><B>problems.</B>
<P><B>Tell me how one can knock on the outside of the front door without
ever</B>
<P><B>opening the screen door?  I acted as it was his mother and replied
"Hi</B>
<P><B>Anna" because I truly believe I had a ghost at that time.  I have
been</B>
<P><B>feeling very insecure since this time.  I don't sleep well and don't
like</B>
<P><B>to be alone where I've never felt like this before.  I am even afraid
to go</B>
<P><B>to the bathroom at night by myself and my husband is going through
the same</B>
<P><B>thing.</B>
<P><B>Tell me what you think?</B>

<H3><A NAME=croatia>Croatia</A>
</H3><P><B>by acarol@ican.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi everyone!  I will start first by introducing myself.  My name is</B>
<P><B>Melanie, I am 20 years old and live in Toronto,  Canada.  There are
many,</B>
<P><B>many experiences that have happened to members of my family.  Most
of the</B>
<P><B>experiences have happened to my Mother.  I guess spirits are attracted
to</B>
<P><B>her, who knows.  I have had a couple experiences myself but I only
remember</B>
<P><B>one particular incident.  Well, here goes.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	I remember this as if it happend yesterday.  I was about 4-5 years
old</B>
<P><B>visiting family in Croatia.  I was staying over at my Fathers parents</B>
<P><B>house.  This house was built by my Grandfather when my Father was
very</B>
<P><B>small.  My Grandfather passed away in that same house before I was
born,</B>
<P><B>but I do not know if this has anything to do with what I am about to
tell</B>
<P><B>you.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>	I was staying in my Grandparents room with my Grandmother.  I had
a hard</B>
<P><B>time falling asleep because my Grandma could sure snore!!!!  Anyway,
 I was</B>
<P><B>lying in bed with my eyes open when I saw this black, shadowy figure
shaped</B>
<P><B>just like a man.  I could not see his face or any other detail, it
was as</B>
<P><B>if you were looking at your own shadow.  I am just watching this
shadow</B>
<P><B>wander around the room.  It seemed as if it were looking around the
room. </B>
<P><B>This went on for awhile and I do not remember being scared.  I guess
I</B>
<P><B>eventually fell asleep and in the morning I told my parents what
happend</B>
<P><B>and of course they thought it was just my imagiation, but I SWEAR I
was</B>
<P><B>wide awake and I know what I saw.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	I used to live in Vancouver B.C. in a fairly new house.   There was
no</B>
<P><B>known history of that house, meaning no one passed away in the house
or</B>
<P><B>anything.  I even asked my mother recently if she experienced anything
when</B>
<P><B>we lived there and she said she did not.  Well, my parents had a
business</B>
<P><B>and had to work late at night and my brother and sister being quite
a few</B>
<P><B>years older than I was usually went with them, so I was home alone
a lot. </B>
<P><B>Anyway, I remember being scared of going to my room to sleep by myself
so I</B>
<P><B>usually fell asleep in front of the TV.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	The house had two floors.  The top floor was where my parents room
was and</B>
<P><B>the living room, kitchen, etc.  Downstairs was where my room was as
well as</B>
<P><B>my brother and sisters rooms.  I had everything a little girl could
ever</B>
<P><B>want in her room.  I had a million toys, a cool bed full of stuffed</B>
<P><B>animals, but for some reason I did not like going in there so I
always</B>
<P><B>slept in the extra bed in sisters room.  She was so much older but
she did</B>
<P><B>not seem to mind.  One night (everyone working) I was so tired and
decided</B>
<P><B>that I was a big girl now so I should be able to go to sleep downstairs
(in</B>
<P><B>my sisters room).  No one else was home, just me and buttons (my dog)
so, I</B>
<P><B>picked her up and took her downstairs with me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	Just as I got myself all tucked in and buttons was by my side I started
to</B>
<P><B>hear footsteps walking across the ceiling (if you know what I mean).
 I</B>
<P><B>just stayed in bed, my eyes moving in the same direction as the footsteps.
</B>
<P><B>It continued untill I decided I was too scared so I ran upstairs to
the TV</B>
<P><B>room.  For some reason I felt better when the TV was on, so I fell
asleep</B>
<P><B>there until everyone got home.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	I went for a visit to Vancouver last July and whenever I go there,
my</B>
<P><B>cousins and I get together and usually end up talking about everyones</B>
<P><B>experiences.  I have never told anyone about the footsteps incident
because</B>
<P><B>I thought it was my imagination.  This time I brought it up and since
one</B>
<P><B>of them is a couple of years older and the other is the same age as
I am</B>
<P><B>but has a better memory, I thought I could get some answers.  Maybe
they</B>
<P><B>remember me saying something or maybe hearing the same footsteps, who</B>
<P><B>knows.  I always thought it was strange that I did not like going into
my</B>
<P><B>own room.  So I asked if they remember anything at all, they both
thought</B>
<P><B>about it.  The older cousin said that she remembers never playing in
my</B>
<P><B>room when we were kids because we were too scared because I told them
that</B>
<P><B>there were people in my room.  Thats all they remember but it still
freaked</B>
<P><B>me out.</B>

<H3><A NAME=first>My First Apartment</A>
</H3><P><B>by mschmidt@wxc.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>After one year in a fraternity house and a second year in the dorms,</B>
<P><B>I'd had it and lied to my college so I could get an apartment (you
had</B>
<P><B>to have 60 credits or live with your parents in order to be excused</B>
<P><B>from dorm life). It was an old building and I just happened to work
in</B>
<P><B>the music store on the first floor. I don't remember the exact order</B>
<P><B>of the events, and they weren't frequent occurrences.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The first thing I remember was my bedroom closet light. Because my</B>
<P><B>roommate had an unending parade of people that I didn't know over at</B>
<P><B>all hours, I decided to keep my LP collection in my closet, out of</B>
<P><B>sight. On a given evening, I might have gone to that closet 3 or 4</B>
<P><B>times to replace one LP and get another. Typically, I'd turn on the</B>
<P><B>closet light, replace one album, get the other, turn off the light,</B>
<P><B>and leave the bedroom. I usually closed the bedroom door because it</B>
<P><B>was adjacent to the living room and the bedroom was usually a mess...</B>
<P><B>this is college, remember.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway, I'd go back to get another album and find the closet light
on.</B>
<P><B>I'd get friends to witness my actions. We'd leave the room, play the</B>
<P><B>record, and when we returned, the light would be on. The switch was</B>
<P><B>up, too - this wasn't just a short circuit. In addition, the light</B>
<P><B>never went on while I was in the bedroom - asleep or otherwise.</B>
<P><B>&lt;%-3&gt;This would happen one evening, then not again for weeks.
Toward</B>
<P><B>the end of my 5-year occupancy, it stopped
completely.&lt;%0&gt;</B>
<P>
<P><B>Three other occurrences happened only once each:</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was in the bathroom "reading" one evening. I kept a bottle of</B>
<P><B>shampoo and a bottle of conditioner on the towel rack in the tub
area.</B>
<P><B>The bases of the bottles rested on the square bar of the rack and the</B>
<P><B>tops of the bottles rested against the wall opposite the shower head</B>
<P><B>and faucet. For some reason, I suddenly looked up at the bottles to</B>
<P><B>see them fly off the rack, one at a time. The tops of the bottles</B>
<P><B>resting against the wall moved away from the wall and they fell into</B>
<P><B>the tub.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another event happened to my roommate. He woke me up one morning </B>
<P><B>and had me come into his room. We had very deep window sills and he
</B>
<P><B>used his as a bookshelf. He was able to store books 2-deep on the </B>
<P><B>sill. Anyway, every last book was on his bed. He'd been woken up by
</B>
<P><B>the books which had been dumped on him all at once.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This one is probably the best. I had recently received a kitten -</B>
<P><B>Dodsworth. We had a ratty old chair with  short legs, about 6 inches.</B>
<P><B>The chair was in bad shape, so we covered it with a tapestry-like</B>
<P><B>sheet. Dodsworth liked to get under the chair and I'd play with him</B>
<P><B>through the sheet (sitting in the chair with my hand between my
feet).</B>
<P><B>One day we were engaged in the usual playtime when I looked up to see</B>
<P><B>Dodsie across the room, hissing at me with his hair standing on end</B>
<P><B>and his back arched. I got severe goose bumps, put Dodsworth in my</B>
<P><B>jacket pocket (he was just a kitten) and left the apartment for</B>
<P><B>several hours. In fact, I got a good case of goose bumps just writing</B>
<P><B>this story.</B>
<P>
<P><B>There was a tavern next door and after I told the owner about these</B>
<P><B>events, he told me that an entire family had perished in a fire in</B>
<P><B>that building many years earlier. Hmmmmm.</B>

<H3><A NAME=2>My 2 Stories</A>
</H3><P><B>by kjenkins03@sprynet.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I have two stories to tell, the first happened when I was still with
my</B>
<P><B>husband living in Calif.  We had the usual experiences of things</B>
<P><B>dissappearing and reappearing months later in places there was no way
for</B>
<P><B>them to get where they were found.  Well, one day I happened to be
home</B>
<P><B>alone with the dog and cat watching tv when the dog (who never left
my</B>
<P><B>side) jumped off the couch ran into the hallway toward the kitchen
stopped</B>
<P><B>dead (pardon the pun) in his tracks at the corner of the kitchen staring
at</B>
<P><B>the shelf behind the sink , growling, barking and trying to protect
me from</B>
<P><B>this thing, (the only way I know this is he tried to scare me back
into the</B>
<P><B>living room by trying to bite me).  I looked around the corner at where
he</B>
<P><B>was focusing his attention and saw a fog sitting in the triangle
formed</B>
<P><B>behind the sink.  When I told my husband about it he informed me that
he</B>
<P><B>had an excorcism shortly after we met but the excorsist told him it
was a</B>
<P><B>very powerful demon and would follow him the rest of his life.  We
moved</B>
<P><B>shortly after that while we were moving we found a photo album that
had</B>
<P><B>been missing between the soft-sided waterbed mattress and the box
spring,</B>
<P><B>now we had been sleeping on that bed for months and it was a queen
size</B>
<P><B>there was no way for that album to get in the center of that mattress
and</B>
<P><B>us not feel it.   We had other minor occurences after that, we split
up and</B>
<P><B>I have never been bothered by that spirit again.  The second spirit
was</B>
<P><B>when my mom was in intensive care following an aneurysm i went to visit
her</B>
<P><B>(she couldn't speak very well this was only a couple of days after
her</B>
<P><B>surgery) she looked at me and asked me "where did she go?" I asked
her who,</B>
<P><B>and she replied "mom" my grandmother had been dead for about eight
years,</B>
<P><B>so I asked her if she meant grandma she said "yes she was standing
right</B>
<P><B>beside me until you came in" Needless to say I was freaked out and
tried</B>
<P><B>not to show it, thaen mom said gramma had told her that everything
was</B>
<P><B>going to be alright and to tell me not to worry if I couldn't be there
all</B>
<P><B>the time.  There are my two stories both true  </B>

<H3><A NAME=my>My Friends Haunted House</A>
</H3><P><B>by deckers@cfu-cybernet.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello My name is Scott. You asked for some real ghost stories,</B>
<P><B>Well I have a real Ghost story For you. And believe it or not it is
a</B>
<P><B>true ghost story that happened to a friend of mine. In a way it is
mine</B>
<P><B>too,sence I  experenced it with her.</B>
<P>
<P><B>		On August 7th,1997 I was awakened from my sleep by a pounding on
my</B>
<P><B>front door. I looked at my clock and it read 1:36A.M. I thought who
in</B>
<P><B>the world is punding on my door at 1:30 in the morning. I got up to</B>
<P><B>answer the door, and upon answering my door I found one of my longest</B>
<P><B>friends standing there. I could see by the frantic look on her face
that</B>
<P><B>she was very frightened.</B>
<P>
<P><B>		I quickly invited her in and sat her down on the couch to talk. As
I</B>
<P><B>asked her what was wrong she started crying. I quickly got her a
glass</B>
<P><B>of water to calm her down. She was sobing uncontrolebly as she tried
to</B>
<P><B>speak the fear in her eyes told me whatever she had to tell me was</B>
<P><B>indeed real. After she calmed down for a while I again asked her to
tell</B>
<P><B>me what had happened that had scared her so bad.</B>
<P>
<P><B>		She began by telling me that as she was going to sleep she felt a</B>
<P><B>sudden chill enter her room. She saw that she had left her window
open,</B>
<P><B>so she mistook it as a cold breeeze and went to sleep. Around 1:00
A.M.</B>
<P><B>She heard footsteps come across her floor, and sence her dog usualy</B>
<P><B>slept on her floor she didn't think anything of it. then things
started</B>
<P><B>to get worse. She felt the sheets being pulled off of her bed. She</B>
<P><B>turned over on her back to see who had pulled the sheets off of her
when</B>
<P><B>she saw no one but the sheets being suspended in mid air. </B>
<P>
<P><B>		One of her books started floating at her very slowly. she was so</B>
<P><B>terrified that she just watched the book float untill it stayed</B>
<P><B>suspended infront of her. She started screaming and ran out of her</B>
<P><B>house. sence she lived up the street from me she ran to my front
door.</B>
<P><B>As I sat there listening to her I had a lot of mixed emotions running</B>
<P><B>through my body. Part of me wanted to believe her, yet part of me</B>
<P><B>didn't. I didn't know what to say to her I wanted to ask her if she
was</B>
<P><B>kidding, But the seriouse look in her eyes answered the question
before</B>
<P><B>I could ask it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>		The next night I staye at her house up stairs from her room, yet
close</B>
<P><B>enough so that if anything happened I could rush down there to
whitness</B>
<P><B>anything thatwas happening. As I sat there In the spare room I kept</B>
<P><B>running her story over and over in my mind trying to make sence of
what</B>
<P><B>she had told me. Close to around 2:00 A.M. I could hear someone
running</B>
<P><B>up the steps so I walked to the door way the led to the hall(which
I had</B>
<P><B>left open purposefully) when the door suddenly shut with a loud bang</B>
<P><B>that startled me and scared her.</B>

<P><B>		As I was fighting to open the door My friend started screaming from</B>
<P><B>down stairs. Hearing her scream was like a bolt of energy that ran</B>
<P><B>through me. I finaly managed to pull the door open enough for me to
get</B>
<P><B>out of the room. As I was running down the hall  toward the stairs
I ran</B>
<P><B>into something that I can only describe as being as hard as a brick</B>
<P><B>wall. As I was laying on the ground totaly stunned I could hear her</B>
<P><B>screaming my name and screaming for help.</B>
<P>
<P><B>		I final got over my daze and ran down the stars. As I reached the</B>
<P><B>bottom she was standing there completle frieghtend out of her mind
and</B>
<P><B>utterly speechless looking toward the hall way to her left. As I
asked</B>
<P><B>her what happened she pointed toward the hall and to my astonishment
I</B>
<P><B>saw a golden cup floating towards us. As I stepped forward to
comfront</B>
<P><B>whatever it was that was carrying the cup it (the cup) vanished.</B>
<P>
<P><B>		We ran out of the house and ran over to my house where she stayed
on</B>
<P><B>my couch untill morning. To the day being the August 18th she hasn't</B>
<P><B>experinced another haunting. Althought we both can feel something
there</B>
<P><B>in her house. I ask her if anytrhing has happened when I see and the</B>
<P><B>answer is always no-not yet.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That is my little story I know that it seemsa litle hard to be true.</B>
<P><B>But believe me every word of the story is true. I promise you, infact
I</B>
<P><B>would even swear my life to it.</B>
