<H3><A NAME=friend>Haunted by a Friend</A>
</H3><P><B>by DOWELL 1 B@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Unlucky in love, my first love and I had too much respect for one another

to stay together as young teens, so we went our separate ways, always expecting

to reunite once we had sown our oats.</B>
<P><B>     My first marriage was a disaster, he went completely madd after
9 days of marriage to me, I know things (ESP) and don't have control over
it, so I would say things like, answer the phone before it would ring, or
fix the record, before it would stick and skip... anyway, on to #2, he was
a bit of a dope head, always trying out new chemicals, so I dropped him like
a disposeable lighter. Then #3 was a pot head, never could be straight, and
I was working 96 hrs.? HUH? forget #3... on to #4, an alcoholic and wife
beater! UGH! I went from bad to worse, so I gave it all up! I had visited
my first love in 1978, and I got pregnant. Oh boy, how do you explain that!
Well, I didn't, I didn't tell him. Six months after our son was born, I decided

to write to him. I was in Missouri(Misery), and he was in Florida. We were
both from Ohio. I finally had the perfect letter explaining how he didn't
have to be a part of our lives if he didn't want to be, that I was Okay and

capeable of handeling the situation without help, so no needs there. I was
ready to mail this huge manilla envelope to him, it was in the mail box and

11:00PM. By midnight, my phone rang. It was my sister in Texas! She said
Sit down, I have bad news. Are you sitting? I said yes even tho I wasn't.
She said My first love (and father of my son) had died in an accident. She
said he was electricuted while loading a sailboat in the Keys in a no loading

zone. I couldn't and didn't want to believe what she was saying. I said,
Okay, I've got to go now, and I hung up. I raised my son alone, and finally
my folks talked me into moving to Florida when my son was in second grade.</B>
<P><B>     I bought a mobile home, and figuring I'd be there the rest of
my life, I had a built in pool added. My aunt came down from Ohio, in need
of Heart Surgery, so she stayed with me helping with my son, and enjoying
the Florida atmosphere. She had arrangements for heart surgery planned for
later on.</B>
<P><B>     We were watching TV one afternoon, and she and I heard a man's
voice say "Where's Sam?". I looked at he and said, wow, did you hear that?
She said Yes. I looked out the window and said, I wonder where he is? He
was grounded and supposed to be in the yard. There he was, across the street!
I yelled at him and told him to get back in the yard or to come in. He did.</B>
<P><B>     About 2 days passed and my aunt kept saying, did you hear that?
Did you feel that? and so on. I noticed a chill in the air, and could hear
foot steps comming up the hallway, and just as they were next to the water

dispenser, bubbles gulped their way to the top of the 5 gallon jug! I looked
at my aunt and jokingly (since she has a bad heart, right?) said, Oh, it's
just the ghost. He must have been thirsty. She kept saying she smelled motor
oil or fuel or something. I never smelled that, but I did hear the footsteps

often!</B>
<P><B>     On the way in from the grocery store, I was holding a gallon of
milk with my keys in hand, and I noticed a man walking down the hallway.
He wasn't much bigger than me, so I turned and told my aunt and son to stay

there! I charged in, ready to put this guy on another planet, but there was
no one there. I checked every closet, every cabinet, I was furious, until
I realized, it was the ghost!</B>
<P><B>     About a week later, my aunt and I were going to go swimming. I

Jokingly said out loud, Do you think the ghost would like to go swimming?
My aunt looked at me, and I at her, and we both again heard his voice, "You

wouldn't catch me in a pair of shorts!" I laughed in histerics! We looked
all around, there were no men, there wasn't anyone! It was the ghost!</B>
<P><B>     He stayed here quite some time, moving things as if he could read
my mind, he knew what I would be looking for next. Then I went to Ohio.</B>
<P><B>     I decided to marry a guy in Ohio and we were going to move back
to Florida, into my place. While we were there, at his place, the lights
started comming on by themselves, and windows would open and close, and the
stove would come on, and go off, and the light would too, so we began saying
it was "George". My son cam up to stay for awhile, so I was able to show
him places his natural father had taken me when we dated, and he also encountered

the ghost. My son came from the stairwell and asked who that guy was. We
said "George" and laughed as my new husband cautiously checked it out. No
one was there. It was only a few times that my son saw this man in the house,
and then my son flew out to Missouri to visit his stepdad for the summer.
The ghost remained for about a week, long enough to scare the dog sitter
away! He was frightened beyond belief! I really am sorry he was so frightened,

but I didn't find these things scarry at all. I thought they were so

interresting!</B>
<P><B>     We came home to my home in Florida, and I've not noticed the ghost.

Sometimes I think he might still be here, because things happen, but if he
is, he's keeping a low profile. My son is back home now, and 19 years old.
He looks so much like his Dad, and only 5'8" too.</B>
<P><B>     Well folks, thats my ghost story, and it's everybit true, and
I'm sorry it wasn't more frightening, but hey, he's a nice ghost!</B>
<P><B>Thank You!          </B>

<H3><A NAME=hand>Hand on Shoulder</A>
</H3><P><B>by LEME0W@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I moved into my husbands grandmothers house on Greensville Ave. back
in the 70's...I was 15 years old at the time and waiting for my husband and

brother to return to the house with furniture and our belongings..I was sitting

at a table in front of a oil heater looking out the window, when I felt this

pressure on my right shoulder....it felt like someones hand. To this day

09/30/98...I belive it was my husbands Grand-Mother telling me to get out
of that house....Our marriage was a disaster, and my husband was very abusive...I

can honestly say I belive that hand on my shoulder was warning me and trying
to help me. I wish I would have payed attention to the warning. I alwaays
felt there were somekind of presence there in a back bedroom of the house.
And belive me.......I never looked at that oil heater the same way

again......Scarry but true.</B>

<H3><A NAME=old>The Old Woman</A>
</H3><P><B>by gac666@hotmail.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I have had a haunting.When i was 4 years old my brother had told me
</B>
<P><B>about how last night he had seen a ghost.He told me that he had got
up </B>
<P><B>to got to the bathroom and on his way back to his room he saw someone

</B>
<P><B>sitting in the recliner,thinking it was my dad he walked over to it
to </B>
<P><B>see if it was him as he got closer he realized that it wasn't my dad,and

</B>
<P><B>that it was an old woman.He told me that he wasnt scared at all and
just </B>
<P><B>went back to sleep,but i think that he was really scared.So of course
i </B>
<P><B>didnt believe him and just thought that he was trying to scare me.That

</B>
<P><B>night i went to bed and i woke upsometime very late into the night
when </B>
<P><B>everyone but me was asleep.My room is straight across from my parents

</B>
<P><B>room and there is a very small hall separating our rooms.In that hall
i </B>
<P><B>saw an old woman staring at me.She was wear ing  a long dress and she

</B>
<P><B>had her hair put up into a bunn. I was very frightened and just hid
</B>
<P><B>under the covers until i fell asleep.I would see her every night and
</B>
<P><B>then after a while i got up enough guts to yell for my mom.My mom would

</B>
<P><B>come to me and walk right through the woman.I soon then started school

</B>
<P><B>and i told a friend of mine that was 2 years older than me about the
</B>
<P><B>ghost i  would see every night.She told me to try and talk to it.So
then </B>
<P><B>that night,sense i was desparate to do anything that would help to
get </B>
<P><B>this ghost to stop bothering me,i asked the woman,"why are you staring

</B>
<P><B>at me,why wont you leave me alone??"The woman didnt reply or say </B>
<P><B>anything at all.The next night she was still there and i decided to
ask </B>
<P><B>her what her name was,but she still did not answer me.I began to get
</B>
<P><B>used to waking up every night and seeing her.I was 8 and still seeing

</B>
<P><B>her,but then one day a group of old women came and one of the women
said </B>
<P><B>that she used to live there with her aunt.I soon then figured that
the </B>
<P><B>woman watching me every night, was the old womans, that had come to
my </B>
<P><B>house, aunt.That night i didnt see the woman staring at me.I am 13
now </B>
<P><B>and havent seen the lady sense then,and i have also moved out of the
</B>
<P><B>room i was in, but about 3 years ago the old woman that used to live
</B>
<P><B>there came back with her daughter and some other old woman and i decided

</B>
<P><B>to tell her about the old woman that would stare at me every night.I
</B>
<P><B>described the old woman to her and she told me that her granny had
also </B>
<P><B>lived there with her and she always wore her hair up in a bunn.I think

</B>
<P><B>that the old woman was just watching over me while she waited for her

</B>
<P><B>grandaughter to return.</B>

<H3><A NAME=two>Two Haunted Houses</A>
</H3><P><B>by Pumaluma@webtv.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm a forty-four year old women and I have two younger brothers.  We</B>
<P><B>moved around a lot when I was  growing up, all over the U.S. , but
I</B>
<P><B>have lived mostly here in WV.  The first haunted house we lived in

was</B>
<P><B>when I was in the third grade, an old farmhouse.  This house had two</B>
<P><B>bedrooms upstairs and an old pump organ at the head of the stairs,
and a</B>
<P><B>trunk full of old papers dating back to the middle eighteen hundreds.</B>
<P><B>In the closet of the room  I chose there was lovely old satin gowns,</B>
<P><B>from I would guess ,the early thirties.  I found I could not sleep
in</B>
<P><B>that bedroom for some reason.   I  moved to a downstairs bedroom with

my</B>
<P><B>Grandmother who lived with us.   Well  my oldest brother starting</B>
<P><B>having disturbing dreams and he said there was an old man and woman

who</B>
<P><B>sat on the foot of his bed and when he would reach out to them they</B>
<P><B>would jump back and laugh at him.  He said this part was not a dream,</B>
<P><B>but the dreams he had were of a young boy and girl playing cowboys

and</B>
<P><B>indians in the house, but that the boy had  a real gun and shot the

girl</B>
<P><B>and she fell out the window and when she did she become hung on a

rope</B>
<P><B>she was playing with.   One night my Grandmother had walked outside

and</B>
<P><B>happened to look into the upstairs window, there she saw an old man

and</B>
<P><B>women in the window that looked like a life sized portrait. She

called</B>
<P><B>my parents to come out and see it but they would not let us kids see

it.</B>
<P><B>My mother never told me what they saw out there that night till long</B>
<P><B>after we had moved from there.  We lived in that house about seven</B>
<P><B>months.  We moved out of state after that and lived in several

different</B>
<P><B>places.    Then the summer I was starting the eight grade we moved

into</B>
<P><B>another old farmhouse about  five miles from the other one.  No five</B>
<P><B>miles doesn't seem that far a distance now, but it did back then on

the</B>
<P><B>old gravel roads and all.  Well this house also had two stories and

and</B>
<P><B>old pump organ and an old trunk, though no papers in this one.   We

had</B>
<P><B>lived so many places that we never really thought much about the

other</B>
<P><B>place, as we had lived in several different places in the same area.</B>
<P><B>The first night we spent in this place we noticed balls of light that</B>
<P><B>moved around the windows.  My boyfriend at the time, and now my

husband</B>
<P><B>of twenty-seven years, had helped us move and it was late when we</B>
<P><B>finished so he was spending the night on the couch, so when  I, young</B>
<P><B>woman of 14 became scared  and could not sleep in my room my parents</B>
<P><B>were happy to let me sleep on the foot of their bed, protect me from

the</B>
<P><B>young virile boyfriend ha ha.   Well time goes by and many strange</B>
<P><B>things happened there but here's the strangest... My brother, the one</B>
<P><B>who had the dreams and I didn't at the time pay much attention to

each</B>
<P><B>other, except when we were fighting for the phone as teenagers will

do.</B>
<P><B>One day I came home from school and my brother was sitting on the

couch</B>
<P><B>and yes I noticed him alright, he was white as a ghost and kind of

green</B>
<P><B>around the eyes.  I said, "Jim, what is wrong?"    He had been doing</B>
<P><B>some work for a nieghbor woman and her mother was there.   He had

been</B>
<P><B>talking to the older woman while there and had mentioned having lived

in</B>
<P><B>this other house.  The women told him she had known the people who

lived</B>
<P><B>there and they had also moved later on to the house we lived in there</B>
<P><B>also.   Then she told him a sad story about a tragedy that had

happened</B>
<P><B>to their little girl.  Yes exactly as he had dreamed.  And no we had</B>
<P><B>never heard the story and never heard of this thing that happened in

the</B>
<P><B>thirties or so,  why would we, this was in 1969 or so by then!   My</B>
<P><B>family lived in this house longer than any house we had lived in

before</B>
<P><B>and I got married and left there about a year and a half before they</B>
<P><B>moved and my Mom told me that before they moved the sounds there had</B>
<P><B>gotten so bad they had to move.  It sounded like chains dragging

around</B>
<P><B>the house all the time.   This is just a small part of the strange</B>
<P><B>things that happened there.   Before my husband and I bought this

house</B>
<P><B>we live in now, I came in here by myself and went to the darkest part

of</B>
<P><B>it I could find and took a nap in here by myself before I made the

final</B>
<P><B>decision to buy,  you know what I mean?   This last haunted house

I've</B>
<P><B>told you about is still standing and I would love to visit it in

hopes</B>
<P><B>of putting my memories to rest.   The other one was tore down several</B>
<P><B>years ago and when a house was rebuilt on the same site they for some</B>
<P><B>reason moved it over to another spot on the property.   Do we wonder</B>
<P><B>why?   Thank-You for your interest.</B>
<P><HR>
<H3><A NAME=creek>The Spirit of Sturgeon Creek</A>
</H3><P><B>by gueris@icdc.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Okay, my brother wrote you a long time ago telling you of a few</B>
<P><B>haunted places, so when he told me of this site I thought it was a

good</B>
<P><B>idea to write you and tell you of my Ghostly encounter. The details

may</B>
<P><B>be choppy, and the first half of the story is a bit sketchy, but here

it</B>
<P><B>goes.</B>
<P>
<P><B>    We frequently attend a campground in Spottsylvania County, VA

called</B>
<P><B>Rocky Branch Family Campground. We have been going here for about 7</B>
<P><B>years, and one thing we like to do at nights is wander around the

woods.</B>
<P><B>This was always thought to be a tad dangerous, and for those who

don't</B>
<P><B>know the trails back there it is not a good idea. One day, we walked</B>
<P><B>(during the day) farther back then ever before and found a cow farm.

We</B>
<P><B>memorized the way and decided it to be fun to head back there in the</B>
<P><B>middle of the night and tip cows (a stupid idea).</B>
<P>
<P><B>    With that we head that way in the middle of the night, not

expecting</B>
<P><B>to meet what we were about to. When we (me and a friend) headed deep</B>
<P><B>into the woods and almost near the farm we heard something treading</B>
<P><B>through the lakes below (there is a hill that leads down to the lake,

if</B>
<P><B>you are heading towards the farm it will be on your right). Up the

hill</B>
<P><B>walked the most sickly looking dog I have ever seen, with another dog</B>
<P><B>not far behind. It was black with eyes that had a slight red glow to</B>
<P><B>them, but nothing that was too ghostly. I was more worried at the

threat</B>
<P><B>of wild dog attacks, as many people have been killed by them as you

may</B>
<P><B>know. But, when it reached about three feet from us it turned around

and</B>
<P><B>head back towards the lake, making no noise and seeming to vanish as

it</B>
<P><B>neared the muddy lake below. We were scared as hell, and thought it

wise</B>
<P><B>to head back before something else spooky happened. Walking back

towards</B>
<P><B>the campground on the trail that we took in we heard a loud howling

that</B>
<P><B>seemed to be about 100 yards away. There are no wolves in this area,

at</B>
<P><B>least not that I am aware of.</B>
<P>
<P><B>    That was not the end of the fright by any means. We were a good</B>
<P><B>distance away from the sight of the first encounter and reached a

point</B>
<P><B>in which the trail widened and looked upward on a hill. My flashlight</B>
<P><B>hit a set of legs, and I saw something pretty scary (to be honest

with</B>
<P><B>you, I was more satisfied to see this then an angry hillbilly with
a</B>
<P><B>twelve gauge). It looked to be a man about 30 years old, with a saber

at</B>
<P><B>his side. He had no shoes and was wearing what looked to be a Union</B>
<P><B>uniform form the civil war. His skin was icy blue and gave off a

slight</B>
<P><B>glow, definitely a ghost. It walked into the woods without looking
at</B>
<P><B>us, bringing a chilly wind as it walked into the dense forest. Then

it</B>
<P><B>vanished. I thought it kinda sad actually, after I realized that I

was</B>
<P><B>out of danger back at my camper. They used to take the boots off dead</B>
<P><B>soldier's back during the Civil war, which would explain the

barefoot.</B>
<P><B>Since the ghost did not seem malicious at all, I felt a little bad,</B>
<P><B>coming up with a theory that it was probably a soldier killed in the

war</B>
<P><B>forced to roam the area.</B>
<P>
<P><B>    How the dogs and this fit in together I have no idea. I am not

sure</B>
<P><B>that the dogs were even ghosts, but I like to think they were. As for</B>
<P><B>the civil war like ghost I call it the Spirit of Sturgeon Creek due

to</B>
<P><B>the name of the creek it was near.  I have tried to go back and get</B>
<P><B>another look at it (with more people) but have not seen it again.</B>

<H3><A NAME=my>My Beloved Grandmother</A>
</H3><P><B>by wydupree@acninc.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>After reading some of the stories on the web page I felt compelled
to share some of my experiences.  You may believe me or not, you may understand

me or not.  Either way these events are true. I had always been close to
my grandmother for as long as I could remember.  Her birthday was October
16, 1907.  I had celebrated her 87th birthday with her my daughter and a
young cousin in 1994.  I had no idea that that would be my last time seeing
her alive.  She died November18,1994.  I was away in college and had planned
on seeing her when I returned home.  I was there just one week prior to her
death but opted to allow my aunt to spend time with her since she was visiting

from Chicago and I could see her the next weekend.  The night she died I
was out with some friends instead of driving home for Thanksgiving break.
 I was devastated at the news and it was very difficult for me to accept.
 I felt guilty for not seeing her when I had the chance.  I carried this
guilt with me for 2 months.  January of 1995  I had a "dream "  in this dream
I had been receiving prank calls from the nursing home where she resided
prior to her death.  My father went to the home to investigate the calls,
after he left, my mom came and sat beside me and told me that she knew someone

would experience some things but she didn't know who until now and it was
me.  I laughed at the thought and walked outside only to see a tall figure

walking toward my grandmother's house. I ran out to the figure to question
its reason for being on our property.  When the figure turned to face me
 I realized it was my grandmother.  It was at that time that I began to apologize

for not coming to visit her and telling her how bad I felt and she told me
that it was all right she knew that I loved her and reminded me of the time
we spent together on her birthday.  She told me that she was all right and
not to worry and that she loved me too.  Then she walked away.  My grandmother

had not walked in over 50 years she was confined to a wheelchair for all
my life.  There had been other experiences with her since then.  It seems
she comes to me whenever I am going through troubled times or have anxieties.
 One night I was awakened to an empty room by a gentle stroke on my cheek
in my new home.  Several of my friends had admitted to me later after moving
out of my home that they had seen various shadows roaming throughout the
house.  I had cleaned my kitchen late one night and gone to bed so I know
for a fact the kitchen and the counter tops were clean and clear.  Several
hours later I was awakened by a noise in the kitchen but ignored it.  A few
hour later when I got up I found my cabinets ajar with several canned items
on the counter top along with various spices.  My first reaction was to ask
my daughter if she had done this. But I knew better because she was to short
to reach these cabinets or the items that were removed.  My last encounter
with a strange occurrence was October 1997 just after I had quit a job rather

abruptly.  Realizing what I had done I needed some one to talk to, but despite

the situation, I felt rather humiliated at the fact that I was jobless. 
I then went to my grandmother's grave site and began to tell her my woes.
 I felt a strong presence around me and on a still and peaceful day a gust
of wind came up from no where and began to dry my tears and in the mist of
the wind I heard a voice say to me loud and clear " Stop crying , you know
what to do".   Advice that I had received throughout my childhood years from
my beloved grandmother!  My life has been rather uneventful since then but
I know that she is near me watching me kind of like my own guardian angel

protecting me.  So I ask you, am I crazy or are there others out there who
have experienced similar situations?   Thanks for allowing me this opportunity
to share, I guess you can imagine the looks I get when I try to tell people
of my occurrences. </B>

<P>
<P><B>well it was in 1994 when my grand mother died of a heart attack in
Bear </B>
<P><B>Lake,  min.  apparently, while eating dinner with her sister, in the
house that she </B>
<P><B>grew up in.   well to get to the good part,  it was about noon maybe
later in the house and while </B>
<P><B>my family was in the living room i decided to get a snack from the
kitchen.  this being an </B>
<P><B>old farm house, the stairway leading to the basement was just off the

kitchen.  while i was </B>
<P><B>looking for something to eat i heard sounds from the basement. it sounded

like heavy foot </B>
<P><B>steps of a man and two little girls giggling.  i was a little unnerved
so i went back to the </B>
<P><B>living room (without my food). &nbsp;later on that day at my grandmothers

burial plot i again heard two </B>
<P><B>little girls giggling so much so that i actually expected them to through

snow balls at us from behind </B>
<P><B>the family grave stone i actually walked behind it and looked but nothing

was to be </B>
<P><B>found.  after a couple months i asked my parents if they had heard
the same thing and they said </B>
<P><B>no , but to this day i would swear on my life that my grandmother was

communicating with me </B>
<P><B>from beyond the grave , telling me the same things that she always
did during life.  </B>
<P><B>"jennifer don't be sad when i die that is selfish im going to a better

<P><B>changed when we heard a noise.This noise was kinda strange. It sounds

</B>
<P><B>like something is banging on the door of the room we were in.I am sure

</B>
<P><B>it wasn't his parents or his family members because there were only
both </B>
<P><B>of us in the house.</B>
<P><B>    The noise becoming louder and louder.We were scared.But,i did brave

</B>
<P><B>myself to open the door and see what's the noise all about.Both my
</B>
<P><B>friend and I went near the door,suddenly,we heard a laughter.The </B>
<P><B>laughter sent shivers to my spine.It was the laughter of a lady,i </B>
<P><B>guess.We quickly ran straight to bed and cover ourselves with

pillows.</B>
<P><B>    We tried to sleep but it didn't work.We were really,really

scared.</B>
<P><B>The noise didn't stop untill 2 in the morning.I said some prayers.Then

</B>
<P><B>we manages to calm down and get some sleep.In the morning,my friend
told </B>
<P><B>me that the noise might be the noise of an old woman who was murdered
in </B>
<P><B>this house a few years ago.She might be the spirit who wandered around

</B>
<P><B>and looking for victims.</B>
<P><B>    This story is true.Believe me.</B>

<H3><A NAME=guyana>Stories from Guyana</A>
</H3><P><B>by guyanesekillah@hempseed.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My grandparents form my father's side in Guyana, South America, (who
are</B>
<P><B>now deceased), were newlyweds and their were living in with their
family</B>
<P><B>they soon found out that their werent getting along, so they decided
to</B>
<P><B>rent a little house in a village right next to a little cemetery,
somewhere</B>
<P><B>along the edge along the woods, while they were settling in their new
home.</B>
<P><B>My Grandmother soon found out that the place is not normal, pots started
to</B>
<P><B>bang all night by themselves, all sorts of banging noises,  when she
told</B>
<P><B>her husband he didn't believe her story because he is a good sleeper,
he</B>
<P><B>had never heard the noises in the beginning, he thought she missed
her</B>
<P><B>family's home because she just got married, he thought their were
little</B>
<P><B>excuses to go back to family's home but after a while the strange</B>
<P><B>experiences were happening more thats when he found out because he</B>
<P><B>experienced it his self, while they were in bed they had restless (due
to</B>
<P><B>the bad dreams) nights they couldn't sleep at all, daytime seems to
be</B>
<P><B>normal an after investigating and telling people about their situation
they</B>
<P><B>started to find out that who was living their previously before they
came ,</B>
<P><B>he is voodoo doctor and that presence was the reason of all these</B>
<P><B>occurrences. This other story is not really a ghost story - This story
is</B>
<P><B>from my mother's side her grandmother had a son who drowned and died
(this</B>
<P><B>story also took place in guyana) and one night she had a dream that
her son</B>
<P><B>had a jar of money saved up and he told her in the dream the
instructions</B>
<P><B>how to get it, and the next day my greatgrandmother found the money.
The</B>
<P><B>next story is one that happened to my uncle, he was sleeping in his
bed at</B>
<P><B>night and then he felt something coming up his arm he thought it was
his</B>
<P><B>little daughter and then the thing started to choke him and then after
he</B>
<P><B>struggled , there was no one there. </B>
<P>
<P><B>All of these story's took place in the country side of Guyana, South</B>
<P><B>America, and they happened before i was born (im only 17), and i was</B>
<P><B>actually born in Guyana, but i moved to queens ny in 1990, there is
one</B>
<P><B>thing im scared of so much the nightime in the Guyana countryside its
so</B>
<P><B>dark and scary, all of these stories are true i didnt make them up,
i heard</B>
<P><B>them from family members. </B>

<H3><A NAME=guide>Spirit Guide</A>
</H3><P><B>by Myrrh1969@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>my name is Jade and i have seen apparitions several times.  When I
was 9,  I saw my first spirit and it was my grandfather. I was living in
the house that he built in 1953 and subsequently died in on my first birhtday
in 1970. </B>
<P><B>My family had moved to the house in 1975 and we had added onto the
main house,  as we also lived with my grandmother.</B>
<P><B>My grandfather had put his blood into this house and before it was
done he had fallen off the roof and broken his back.  He was told that he
would never walk again but he walked with a cane.  When i saw him, he was
able bodied and walking down the hallway with me.  He stated that he was
here to watch over my mother.  I was not afraid nor was I scared.  He was
as real as I,  and I remember this feeling of calmness sweeping over me.
  I was not frightened.   I have, as i have gotten older and have been studying
wicca (celtic / druid magic) have also had other experiences in that realm.
 </B>
<P><B>One of those experiences has led me to my true soulmate, who is not
of the physical realm but of the astral. </B>
<P><B>He came to me in 1989 and told me that we could not be together on
this plane but he walks with me through all of my days.  When i meditate
and go to the astral, he is there and he helps me in my dealings with the
gods and goddesses.  He helps me see my true self, which i had lost.  That
is why he came to me.  I can feel him and sense him when I am in a "situation".
 He has protected me from harm but sometimes he has to let me feel the pain
of life in order to become a better preistess.</B>
<P><B>My grandmother died in 1989 and I have also felt her presence. </B>
<P><B>I was involved in a horrible car accident in 1994 and after the initial
hit of the other vehicle, her cologne filled the air in the car and I felt
her presence there with me. </B>
<P><B>I am not afraid of these apparitions, I invite them to teach me and
to learn from them.  I only have one experience that brought me face to face
with something that I can only call evil, that was brought about by people
that I knew only in passing.  These people lived with a friend of mine and
they were entranced by the ouija board.  This is where this spirit came from.
 I was actually physically burned when I touched the goblet with my hand
that was face down on the board. </B>
<P><B>I tell people to NEVER use the ouija as you never know what may come
to you.   I used my powers of psychic shield to protect me and keep me from
being tormented by this particular spirit .  I have never had another "bad"
experience and keep away from people and things that give me a bad "vibe".
 I am a sensate and actually can feel the chaos in people.  BUT those are
some of my stories.  I am glad that I could divulge them here, in this arena.
  The goddess walks with us all. </B>

<H3><A NAME=beaver>Beaver Creek State Park</A>
</H3><P><B>by RealUglyGr@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Reading your stories does help, me at least understand &amp; know that
there are other people out there that will believe you. Thank you.</B>
<P><B>My story statrs when I was about 14. To my knowlwdge there is no history
of paranormal or ESP or any such thing in our family. I live about 10 minutes
from Beaver Creek State Park in Ohio. I know it is listen in several places
in your haunted index. I hadnt been there in years when a group of us went
down there one night. While driving down there a friends was talking, I dont
remember about when. I remeber laughing at it &amp; I turned to look at him,
he was in the passanger seat &amp; I was in the middle of the truck bed,
I saw a face. Horrifing mans face scrunched up &amp; glareing at me. He had
long balck hair &amp; a long face &amp; his face was almost greenish I dont
know if from the window or what. The rage that was radiating off of him was
terrifing I gasped &amp; grabbed hold of my friends arm &amp; he followed
my gaze as the face dissapeared. was over 10 years ago &amp; I'll never forget
it. </B>
<P><B>Since then I see things everywhere. Once while driving with another
frind down a back road. There were no houses around. We came to a place in
the road where the sewer pipe wasnt burried deep under the road &amp; we
had to come to a complete stop before going over it. Like a huge speed bump.
I looked out the window, I was in the passenger side, to an open field. It
was sept or Nov &amp; the corn was down. I could see a treeline behind the
field. When a light appeared &amp; as it got closer I could see it was a
train. I could even see the number of the train. Strangly I didnt panic.
Reason got the best of me. I could see the treeline thru it but it was comming
right us. I could see the steam or smoke coming out the top. As it got closer
I could see the driver &amp; the first car went right thru us, as it went
thru us I turned my head forward again &amp; could see the passengers. I
couldnt hear them but they were talking, men smoking a woman in a dress,
an old dress with the net thing on the butt &amp; her hair all done up under
her hat. </B>
<P><B>Then is was gone, it happened in a matter of seconds as my friend drove
slowly over the bump. Months later I told my sister about it &amp; we went
to the library &amp; looked thru old historical newspaper they had &amp;
found a train matching that number that was on its way to New York &amp;
derailed in Michigan. Killing almost everyone on the train.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now I see people, animals &amp; shadows all the time. Driving I see
car accidents, people walking, dogs, deer, cats. Everywhere I see them, I
hear voices call my name or whispering in my ear &amp; they touch me, the
hair on my neck &amp; arms stands up &amp; I wirl around &amp; there is nothing.
We are the only ones to ever live in our house. We build it &amp; moved in
when I was 3. I see people walking around in it. I see our cat that we had
to put to sleep. I hear her run up the stairs &amp; that sound cats make
when they run up stairs, she sits in doorways &amp; meows at me but I try
to pet her &amp; she dissappears. I feel her jump on my bed &amp; lay down.
We have had other cats die but I dont see them.</B>
<P><B>It makes me crazy somtimes the constant feeling that someone is watching
me. I wish I could turn it off but sometimes I wish I could strength it &amp;
be able to do something with it.</B>

<H3><A NAME=house>Haunted House</A>
</H3><P><B>by Babyy_Girlll@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I used to live in a haunted house. I moved into this house with my</B>
<P><B>boyfriend, my best friend and her boyfriend.  As soon as we moved in,</B>
<P><B>all the people in the neighborhood started saying that it was haunted</B>
<P><B>and no one ever stayed in that house for long.   We ignored them. 
And</B>
<P><B>for about a month, there was no incidents.  Then the first thing to</B>
<P><B>manifest was a very disgusting odor in the kitchen.  It  smelled like</B>
<P><B>something had died.  We cleaned that kitchen spottless several times
and</B>
<P><B>used air freshener.  But nothing would take the scent away and it was</B>
<P><B>only in the kitchen. Next, we heard children running up and down the</B>
<P><B>stairs in the wee hours of the morning.  We could hear them laughing</B>
<P><B>and playing all night long.  My roommate had 2 cats and they would</B>
<P><B>follow nothing with there eyes all the time,and they refused to go
into</B>
<P><B>the playroom upstairs.  I had a 6 month old baby at the time and</B>
<P><B>whenever I took her into that room to play she would follow nothing
with</B>
<P><B>her eyes or cry unconsolebly until I removed her from that room. And
you</B>
<P><B>could feel cold spots in that room.  Sometimes the hair on the back
of</B>
<P><B>your neck would stand on end just by walking into that room.  We also</B>
<P><B>had two different ghost apparitions walking the house.  One was quite</B>
<P><B>mean and the other was very nice.  Once, I left my baby on my bed and</B>
<P><B>went to the bathroom.  As soon as I reached the bathroom, I heard her</B>
<P><B>crying like she was in pain.  I went back to my room and saw the</B>
<P><B>apparition of a man in dark jeans and a bluish sweatshirt with a hood</B>
<P><B>standing over my baby.  I was scared and I went over to pick up my
child</B>
<P><B>and the man disappeared.  I tried to pick her up and to my surprise,
I</B>
<P><B>couldn't.  Then I saw a hand print  on her shoulder and one on her</B>
<P><B>stomach like someone was holding her down.  I kept struggling to pick</B>
<P><B>her up and then another male apparition appeared in the doorway. He
had</B>
<P><B>on old dirty cover-all and black combat boots.  He started toward the</B>
<P><B>bed and suddenly I literally jerked my baby off the bed. then both</B>
<P><B>ghosts disappeared!  I ran out of that house and straight to my
mothers</B>
<P><B>home 2 1/2 blocks away in just my tee-shirt and underware and refused
to</B>
<P><B>go back until my boyfriend got home from work.   I told my roommate</B>
<P><B>about it and she thought I was just seeing things even though she had</B>
<P><B>heard and experienced everything that I had.  Well, one night she was</B>
<P><B>getting ready to go out to a club with her friend.  She was in
bathroom</B>
<P><B>with her friend and they saw a man in dirt cover-alls and black
combat</B>
<P><B>boots walk by the bathroom and down the stairs.  He even said hello.
 So</B>
<P><B>they naturally thought I had returned home with a friend. They didn't</B>
<P><B>hear the front door and it was very noisy. It creaked all the time.
So</B>
<P><B>there was no way anyone could open it without being heard.  So they
went</B>
<P><B>downstairs to be introduced to my friend and found no one there.  I</B>
<P><B>returned home later and heard the whole story.  The last straw was
when</B>
<P><B>my baby  fell out of the second story window.  She didn't know how
to</B>
<P><B>crawl yet and my bed was a good 2-3 feet away from the window.  Well
I</B>
<P><B>woke up to screaming and crying from my roommate.  She was frantic,
and</B>
<P><B>she kept saying the baby fell out of the window. I  immediately
jumped</B>
<P><B>up and ran downstairs and out the door to find my baby lying on the
only</B>
<P><B>patch of grass on the walkway.  It was only about 10 inches in
diameter</B>
<P><B>and the rest of it was all concrete.  I was just lucky she had to be
at</B>
<P><B>work that morning early or we never would have known until later that</B>
<P><B>morning.  I went to pick her up and looked up at the window and to
my</B>
<P><B>surprise, I saw the man in the bluish sweatshirt looking out of my</B>
<P><B>bedroom window!  We took my daughter to the hospital and they kept
her</B>
<P><B>overnight for observation and to there surprise,she had nothing wrong</B>
<P><B>with her!  Not one scratch!  Now, how could she land on the only
piece</B>
<P><B>of grass on the walk way right in the middle as if someone or
something</B>
<P><B>placed her there?  I think that the cover-all ghost caught her and
laid</B>
<P><B>her on that patch of grass because she wasn't crying or nothing!  And</B>
<P><B>when we returned home the next day I laid her on the sofa and went
into</B>
<P><B>the kitchen to get a drink of pop and when I went back into the
living</B>
<P><B>room, I saw the cover-all man stroke her head and when I went to my
baby</B>
<P><B>she was laughing and cooing!   We moved out of that house one week</B>
<P><B>later.  My roommate was curious about the history of the house and
went</B>
<P><B>to the library to research it.  She found out that about 15 year
before,</B>
<P><B>the second floor of the house had burned down and killed 5 kids and
2</B>
<P><B>women!  That would explain the laughing and running on the stairs but</B>
<P><B>not the 2 men.  We think that the nice man was killed by the mean</B>
<P><B>sweatshirt guy and maybe he was killed by the police, and that maybe
the</B>
<P><B>nice guy is buried beneath the house by the kitchen and that's why
it</B>
<P><B>smells so bad in that room.   Like I said,none of that is proven,
it's</B>
<P><B>just our guess.  Ever since we moved out, there is a new "for rent"
sign</B>
<P><B>in the window about every 4-6 months!  That's my story all of it
true.</B>
<P><B>I have my friend, ex-boyfriend, and 2 sisters as witnesses to the</B>
<P><B>phenomenons of that house.  That was not my first ghost incident, but</B>
<P><B>hopefully it was the last. I have had no further incidents with the</B>
<P><B>supernatural since, and that was 7 years ago.  Thank you for reading
my</B>
<P>story.

</B>
<P><B>walking my dog when she suddenly ran away from me the length of the
</B>
<P><B>field. She wouldn't come when I called her, but kept looking back up
the </B>
<P><B>rise at me. I started walking down the field, kind of parralel to her,
</B>
<P><B>because i wanted to head her off before she could get on the road.
Just </B>
<P><B>then, I noticed a man on horseback riding towards me. He road past
and </B>
<P><B>leaned out of the saddle as if to say something, but he didn't. His
face </B>
<P><B>was covered with a large red mark of some kind. A moment after he passed
</B>
<P><B>me, my dog came running back. After I got her on her leash, I turned
back </B>

<H3><B><A NAME=gunn>Old Gunn Church</A></B>
</H3><P><B>by &nbsp;	ladyjenn20@hotmail.com </B>
<P>
<P>The <B>"Old Gunn Church" was once known as Prince Fredrick's Episcople
Church, </B>
<P><B>which it's remains stands in Plantersville, South Carolina. I'm not
sure </B>
<P><B>of the exact years of events but Prince Frederick's, Prince George
(in </B>
<P><B>Georgetown, SC) and another Episcaple chuch in Browns Ferry, SC (I
was </B>
<P><B>never told the name) were to be a diocese, but Prince Frederick's was
</B>
<P><B>never built yet. Sometime during the Civil War, Thomas Gunn was working
</B>
<P><B>on Prince Fredrick...he was the architect of the church. When the war
</B>
<P><B>broke out in the South, they had to halt all the church building, and
</B>
<P><B>when word got to Gunn, he went to the bell tower of the church to put
</B>
<P><B>some finishing touches there before he stopped. When he went to climb
</B>
<P><B>down, he lost his footing and fell to his death. I've heard variations
</B>
<P><B>of stories of how he died, he fell from the bell tower, when he fell,
</B>
<P><B>the rope that was being used as a harness caught him around his neck,
</B>
<P><B>etc. After the Civil War, the builders continued to finish the church,
</B>
<P><B>and it was an active church for about 50 years. Well, rumor says that
</B>
<P><B>the church was damned because Gunn blasphemed when he fell, so the
</B>
<P><B>church caught on fire and was never rebuilt, that the only part standing
</B>
<P><B>of the church is the bell tower, and part of the front. Well, here
are </B>
<P><B>the legends (and BELIEVE ME...there are a lot of them!!!) First of
</B>
<P><B>all...they say that if you stand across the road from the church at
</B>
<P><B>exactly midnight with a full moon, you can see Thomas Gunn working
on </B>
<P><B>the tower and see him fall. </B>
<P><B>At one time, there was a statue of an angel sitting on the corner of
the </B>
<P><B>church (it got knocked over by Hurricane Fran), and if you would stare
</B>
<P><B>at it, it would wink at you.</B>
<P><B>Here's a good one...if you take a brick off the church grounds and
put </B>
<P><B>it in your possession, spirits will haunt you until they get it back!!!
</B>
<P><B>Here's a story I got from a friend who claims that took a brick from
the </B>
<P><B>church: </B>
<P><B>   He took a brick off the church grounds and put it in his truck and
</B>
<P><B>started down the road. He noticed this light in his rear-view, which
was </B>
<P><B>the ghost train (there was a railroad track by the church and it was
</B>
<P><B>what they call the "slave train") and it was chasing him down the road.
</B>
<P><B>He threw the brick out the window and it landed in the back of his
truck </B>
<P><B>and shattered. So he and his friends got out of his truck and swept
all </B>
<P><B>the pieces out and as soon as the last piece was off the truck...the
</B>
<P><B>train disappeared. </B>
<P><B>Another legend...if you have a pick-up truck, and you put your tail
gate </B>
<P><B>down and back up to where the back of your truck is close to the doors
</B>
<P><B>of the church, you will see little slave children sitting on the back
of </B>
<P><B>your truck. But you can't turn around to look at them...you have to
look </B>
<P><B>in your rear-view because if you turn around to look, you die.</B>
<P><B>I have heard lots of stories...like my friends have told me that they've
</B>
<P><B>heard the choir singing, that your car can stall out in front of the
</B>
<P><B>church, or if you mess around with the spirits and you get in your
car </B>
<P><B>and floor it, your car might just go 45 mph. The road that "Old Gunn"
</B>
<P><B>sits on has a lot of legends. There is a slave graveyard about 2 miles
</B>
<P><B>away from the church and they say that if you roll your windows down,
</B>
<P><B>turn your car engine off, headlights and everything, you can hear them
</B>
<P><B>chanting in the graveyard, and see lights coming out of the graves.
</B>
<P><B>There is a bridge about 1/2 mile from the church...a woman tried to
save </B>
<P><B>her little girl in that creek, and she drowned trying to save her child.
</B>
<P><B>They say if you yell for help, you will see her jump in the water (I
</B>
<P><B>tried it and didn't see anything).</B>

</H3><P><B>by please resend your address</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is the closest I have come to the "experience" of contact.  The
story begins approximatley 25 years ago.....</B>
<P><B>Airman Gray was a Security Policeman at Castle Air Force Base(now closed).
As the story goes, he left his roomate a letter giving him instructions on
what to do in case he did not come home from work.  The roomate passed his
concerns on to Grays supervisor, who in turn told his partner that night
to keep an eye on him.  The night shift passed without incident.  Around
dawn, gray told his partner to stop by the port-a-john beneath an observation
tower so he could relieve himself.  Since it had been a long night, the partner
didn't put two and two together when gray took his M-16 with him into the
port-a-john.  At least not until he heard the distinctive popping of the
weapon discharging.  The partner opened the door to find a bloody scene.
 Gray had blown his face off.</B>
<P><B>The years went by, and talk of the suicide eventually faded to a story
told to the new guys fresh from basic training.  Until that night in 1989.
 My flight was coming on shift and releiving a flight of excitedly scared
Air Force cops.  The sory went that the Alarms on the fenceline had been
constantly going off in sector 18.  The responding patrol eventually just
sat there in their truck for the next alarm.  Funny thing was that there
was no wind and the abundance of rabbits that usually set off the alarms
were nowhere to be seen.  To break up the boredom, the supervisor initiated
an exercise to test the police response to a terrorist attack.  The deployment
of cops was great until a machinegunner jumped from the back of an armored
truck and raced off to her defenseive position at the top of a storage structure.
As she reached the top of the grass covered structure, she layed down on
her belly to get behind the machine gun. she looked down the length of the
gun and found herself staring at a gray figure with no facial features. 
She let out a piercing scream and immediately abandoned her weapon, ammunition,
and position. On her way down, she passed her assistant gunner, who went
to the top to see what scared her.  he saw a figure running away from the
structure toward sector 18.  The figure went at an accelerating pace past
the patrol who was monitoring the sector, went THROUGH the chain link fence
and set off the entire series of alarms at sector 18.  The alarm momitor
looked in his surveillance cameras in time to see a grayish streak pass through
as the alarms went off.  The machinegunner was terrified and locked herself
in the armored truck and would come out for no man.  The exercise was terminated
and no further problems occured for the remainder of the shift.  My flight
came on duty and we reported no incidents, but sector 18 was left alone for
the rest of the night. </B>

<H3><A NAME=roanoke>The House in Roanoke</A>
</H3><P><B>by Marilyn </B>
<P>
<P><B>There are some things</B>
<P><B> in my life that have truly terrified me.  Things I could </B>
<P><B>never really explain.  They just happened. I guess that's </B>
<P><B>par for the course when you are dealing with the </B>
<P><B>supernatural.  I will write some of the things down now.  </B>
<P><B>I cannot offer any real explanations as to why they </B>
<P><B>happened to me and my family.  Only that they did.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When my parents rented the big two story house on Kern's </B>
<P><B>Avenue,  I was tickled to death.  The house was in the </B>
<P><B>city limits of Roanoke, Virginia.  It was a huge three </B>
<P><B>bedroom home, with a little park directly across the </B>
<P><B>street.  My two sisters and I would share a bedroom, and </B>
<P><B>my brother would have his own bedroom for the first time </B>
<P><B>in his young life.  He had always had to sleep on the </B>
<P><B>couch until now.  So he of course was plenty happy. This </B>
<P><B>soon changed once we came to realize that the house was </B>
<P><B>haunted.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was November of 1967 when we moved in.  I had just </B>
<P><B>turned twelve years old.  Since I was the oldest, I had to </B>
<P><B>help Mom with the unpacking.  I made trip after trip up </B>
<P><B>the stairs to put things in their new places.  My parents </B>
<P><B>room was directly to the right as you came to the stair </B>
<P><B>landing.  My brother Billy's room was the first bedroom as </B>
<P><B>you turned left at the stair landing.  Us girls had the </B>
<P><B>bedroom at the very end of the hall down from Billy's </B>
<P><B>room.  All  of the rooms had huge walk in closets.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We girls laughed at how much our new bedroom resembled a </B>
<P><B>hospital infirmary.  The way our three beds were lined up </B>
<P><B>made us think that way.  I took the bed nearest the walk </B>
<P><B>in closet. Big mistake!  Although I didn't know it then.</B>
<P>
<P><B>There was also a bathroom upstairs, and it too had a walk </B>
<P><B>in closet.  We all noticed a stain on the hardwood floor </B>
<P><B>the day that we moved in.  My Dad installed hardwood </B>
<P><B>floors for a living.  And sanding stains from hardwood </B>
<P><B>floors was an easy thing for him.  He sanded it out a few </B>
<P><B>days after we moved in.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The whole family was happy that day as we moved in.  This </B>
<P><B>was the nicest home we had ever lived in.  We felt </B>
<P><B>fortunate to have been able to afford it.  Houses like </B>
<P><B>this usually were out of our price range, but not this </B>
<P><B>one.  The rent was only $60.00 a month.  Far below the </B>
<P><B>going rent for a house like this one.  We even had a </B>
<P><B>basement here.  We all loved it. There was a screened in </B>
<P><B>back porch for us to enjoy once spring and summer rolled </B>
<P><B>around.  Us kids envisioned the summer nights we would </B>
<P><B>camp out there.  Little did we realize then that we would </B>
<P><B>be long gone once summer came!</B>
<P>
<P><B>We finally finished the bulk of our unpacking and it soon </B>
<P><B>came time to go to bed.  That's when the strange and eerie </B>
<P><B>events that we experienced there began.  They started </B>
<P><B>innocently enough.  My parents heard footsteps of someone </B>
<P><B>coming up the stairs.  They thought that one of us kids </B>
<P><B>had gone downstairs to the refrigerator or something.  Mom </B>
<P><B>called out to see which one of us it was.  But no one </B>
<P><B>answered.  The footsteps stopped right outside of their </B>
<P><B>bedroom at the top of the stair landing.  Mom and Dad both </B>
<P><B>sat up in their beds and looked at the doorway, but they </B>
<P><B>saw no one.  Finally, they both went to sleep.  They asked </B>
<P><B>us all the next morning if we had left our beds in the </B>
<P><B>night and gone downstairs.  None of us had.  It spooked us </B>
<P><B>though when they told us they had heard someone on the </B>
<P><B>stairs.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night in December, my parents sent us kids up to bed </B>
<P><B>early.  They stayed downstairs to watch TV for awhile.  As </B>
<P><B>I laid there in my bed next to that closet, an event </B>
<P><B>occurred which terrified me.  I was the only one awake in </B>
<P><B>the room at the time--my sisters were already asleep.  </B>
<P><B>Lucky them!  As I laid there, I began to hear a faint </B>
<P><B>sound of musical notes being played.  At first it sounded </B>
<P><B>far off in the distance.  Then it became louder.  I looked </B>
<P><B>around in the dark in puzzlement when it dawned             </B>
<P><B>on me that the sounds were coming from the closet beside </B>
<P><B>my bed.  Chills ran up my spine!  I listened as the sound </B>
<P><B>became louder by the second.  I felt as if whoever or </B>
<P><B>whatever was making the sound, knew it had my total </B>
<P><B>attention.  I was frozen in fear.  The sound coming from </B>
<P><B>the closet was tinny.  The best way I can describe it is </B>
<P><B>that it sounded like someone was plucking on nails that </B>
<P><B>stuck out of a wall.  It was being done in such a way as </B>
<P><B>to make a melody. It wasn't an unpleasant tune.  It's just </B>
<P><B>that it wasn't supposed to be happening at all!  Finally I </B>
<P><B>was able to move.  I bolted out of that bed and ran </B>
<P><B>downstairs to where my parents were.  I was crying </B>
<P><B>hysterically by this time, and it took me a few minutes to </B>
<P><B>get the problem out. Dad and Mom went up with me to check </B>
<P><B>the closet. Well, daddy did the checking.  Mom and I just </B>
<P><B>kind of held back a bit near the bedroom door.  Wouldn't </B>
<P><B>you know it though?  The room was now quiet.  No musical </B>
<P><B>notes wafting out of the closet.  Nothing out of the </B>
<P><B>ordinary was there at all.  Dad told me to come look for </B>
<P><B>myself.  Nothing.  Nobody was playing musical nails.  My </B>
<P><B>parents tried to convince me that I had been dreaming and </B>
<P><B>I just thought it was real.  I just agreed with them. I </B>
<P><B>mean, it was pointless to argue with them that a seventh </B>
<P><B>grader knew the difference between a dream and reality.  </B>
<P><B>If I was dreaming, I would hope that my subconscious mind </B>
<P><B>would be clever enough to come up with a more appropriate </B>
<P><B>musical instrument than nails. Ha!   A guitar, or a piano </B>
<P><B>maybe? Heck,why not a kazoo? My parents  went back </B>
<P><B>downstairs after tucking me in.  There I was--all alone </B>
<P><B>again in the dark.  My sisters slept through the entire </B>
<P><B>concert.  {~_~}  As soon as I was about to drift off to </B>
<P><B>sleep, the musical nail sounds began again.  This time I </B>
<P><B>screamed!!  My sisters woke up then! I made sure of that! </B>
<P><B>My parents ran back upstairs.  They were pretty mad at me </B>
<P><B>this time.  I begged them to let me sleep in their room.  </B>
<P><B>They wouldn't hear of it.  They did make one consolation </B>
<P><B>though.  They asked my sister on the far side of the room </B>
<P><B>to switch beds with me.  Mary didn't mind.  She's a sound </B>
<P><B>sleeper anyway.  Of course, no one ever heard the sounds </B>
<P><B>that night except for me.  Ghosts seem to take a special </B>
<P><B>delight in making you appear loopy to your family and </B>
<P><B>friends.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Luckily, the rest of that night passed uneventfully.  A </B>
<P><B>few nights later though, it would be my brother Billy's </B>
<P><B>turn to appear loopy.  Billy was asleep in his room when </B>
<P><B>he began to hear a soft moaning sound coming from his </B>
<P><B>closet.  As he listened he said that the moaning become </B>
<P><B>louder.  I knew what that was like!  But what caused him </B>
<P><B>to bolt from his room in terror, was the sound of his </B>
<P><B>matchbox car collection being hurled onto the closet floor </B>
<P><B>by some unseen force.  Billy loved his matchbox car </B>
<P><B>collection.  He kept them "parked" neatly on the closet </B>
<P><B>shelf.  So, you can imagine the fear he felt when he heard </B>
<P><B>them all crash onto the floor.  Especially since no one </B>
<P><B>was in the closet.  Heck, no one was in his room except </B>
<P><B>himself!  At least no one that any of us could see.</B>
<P>
<P><B>By this time all of us kids were starting to think that </B>
<P><B>there was something not quite right about our new house.  </B>
<P><B>We started asking other kids in the neighborhood if </B>
<P><B>anything strange had ever happened in that house.  We did </B>
<P><B>learn from the neighborhood children that a man had died </B>
<P><B>there many years before.  It seems he suffered from a </B>
<P><B>brain tumor and suffered much pain.  He eventually died in </B>
<P><B>what was my brother's bedroom.  Billy was ready then to </B>
<P><B>give up his bedroom and sleep on the couch once again.  My </B>
<P><B>parents wouldn't allow that.  They tried telling us that </B>
<P><B>the neighborhood kids were just" pulling our leg."  That's </B>
<P><B>southern talk for, having a joke at our expense. Us kids </B>
<P><B>knew that even if no one had really died in that house of </B>
<P><B>a brain tumor, that didn't mean that Something hadn't </B>
<P><B>happened there that caused our house to be haunted.</B>
<P>
<P><B>You would have thought that our parents would have been </B>
<P><B>the first ones to realize that the house was indeed </B>
<P><B>haunted. Both of my parents had seen ghosts quite recently </B>
<P><B>before we moved in there.  Dad had his ghostly encounter </B>
<P><B>the November before.  My Grandma died suddenly and we had </B>
<P><B>to go to Maryland for her funeral.  We stayed at my </B>
<P><B>grandparents home that night.  Daddy slept upstairs just </B>
<P><B>outside of the bedroom where us kids slept that night.  </B>
<P><B>There was a bed set up on the landing.  Daddy couldn't </B>
<P><B>sleep, so he decided to sit up and smoke a cigarette.  Now </B>
<P><B>you young and impressionable people out there--do not try </B>
<P><B>this at home.  {~_~}  Anyway, Dad said that as he sat </B>
<P><B>there smoking he heard someone coming up the stairs.  He </B>
<P><B>waited to see who it was.  He got quite a shock!  It was </B>
<P><B>Grandma!  She spoke to daddy, saying "Everyone thinks I'm </B>
<P><B>gone, but I'm still here."  She then vanished before his </B>
<P><B>eyes.  Needless to say, daddy didn't get any sleep that </B>
<P><B>night!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Mom had her ghostly encounter just the summer before we </B>
<P><B>moved to Kern's Avenue.  My parents were fighting, and my </B>
<P><B>mom went out on the porch to cool down.  It was just after </B>
<P><B>midnight.  We lived up in what they call a "holler."  </B>
<P><B>Meaning it's totally in the boonies!  There were no street </B>
<P><B>lights within a 20 mile radius of this place the locals </B>
<P><B>called "Dry Holler."  On moonless nights you could </B>
<P><B>literally not even see your hand held in front of your </B>
<P><B>face.  It was eerie!  I hated living there.  Panthers </B>
<P><B>would come down off the mountain and rummage through our </B>
<P><B>garbage at night.  Oh, sorry--back to the ghost. Mom was </B>
<P><B>sitting out on the porch when she caught movement out of </B>
<P><B>the corner of her eye.  She looked over and saw a man </B>
<P><B>walking towards her.  She thought she recognized him as a </B>
<P><B>neighbor from up the holler.  She spoke to him saying, </B>
<P><B>"Tucker, what are you doing out here so late in the </B>
<P><B>night?"  As she said this, he walked right through our car </B>
<P><B>bumper and vanished!  Mom screamed!  All of us kids woke </B>
<P><B>up terrified!  Mom told us later that he seemed to have </B>
<P><B>been dressed in an old civil war uniform.  That made sense </B>
<P><B>since this was Virginia and all.</B>
<P>
<P><B>So, you would think that my parents would have been keen </B>
<P><B>to the possibility that we had a problem haunting, right </B>
<P><B>from the get go.  Maybe they did think that.  They </B>
<P><B>probably didn't quite know how to handle this though.  I </B>
<P><B>mean, they had never had to contend with a ghost actually</B>
<P><B>IN our house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Soon thereafter, I had my own ghostly encounter.  I saw </B>
<P><B>the one and only ghost that I hope to have to see in my </B>
<P><B>lifetime. I was still the proud owner of the bed across </B>
<P><B>the room.  You know, the one that was as far as I could </B>
<P><B>get from that closet. It was the middle of the night when </B>
<P><B>this event occurred.  I was awakened by something.  I </B>
<P><B>still to this day do not know what it was that woke me.  I </B>
<P><B>wish I'd slept through it, but no such luck!  I woke up </B>
<P><B>and had the distinct feeling that I was being watched.  I </B>
<P><B>then heard something rustle in the darkness.  I looked </B>
<P><B>over at the doorway, and stared straight at terror!  There </B>
<P><B>in the doorway stood someone just looking in at us </B>
<P><B>sleeping kids.  The person was dressed in an odd flowing, </B>
<P><B>dark hooded robe.  The freakiest thing though, was the </B>
<P><B>feeling that I was looking at something that was purely </B>
<P><B>evil.  I was so scared.  I couldn't run from the room as </B>
<P><B>this thing stood right in the doorway!  I finally did the </B>
<P><B>only thing I could do.  I covered my head up.  When I </B>
<P><B>ventured a peek, much later, thankfully it was gone.  </B>
<P><B>Soon--not soon enough--it was daylight.  I asked mom if </B>
<P><B>she had come to our door during the night to check on us.  </B>
<P><B>I was hoping against hope that mom had bought a long </B>
<P><B>flowing dark hooded robe, and worn it for the first time </B>
<P><B>during that night.  Ha!  Of course, she said that she </B>
<P><B>hadn't gotten up during the night.  Neither had daddy.</B>
<P>
<P><B>About this time, things got worse.  My dad and mom were </B>
<P><B>realizing that we definitely had a problem.  They were </B>
<P><B>continuously being awakened by footsteps coming up the </B>
<P><B>stairs at night.  Daddy even waited at the top of the </B>
<P><B>stairs to see whoever it was.  He said that he felt </B>
<P><B>coldness pass over him as the footfalls made their way to </B>
<P><B>the landing where he stood watch.  The stain that daddy </B>
<P><B>had sanded off the floor of the bathroom closet returned.  </B>
<P><B>We all thought it looked like a stain made by blood.  Mom </B>
<P><B>become so afraid of being alone when dad went to work and </B>
<P><B>us kids went off to school.  She would say that she would </B>
<P><B>be upstairs making up the beds, when she would hear the </B>
<P><B>sound of a man moaning.  She said that it would follow her </B>
<P><B>into all of the bedrooms and even in the bathroom.  She </B>
<P><B>finally began to stay downstairs until we kids came home </B>
<P><B>from school.</B>
<P>
<P><B>What finally convinced my parents to move though was this:</B>
<P><B>Mom had a friend come over one morning for coffee.  Brenda </B>
<P><B>lived two doors down from us.  Mom decided to walk her to </B>
<P><B>her house when she left.  Mom didn't go in, she just </B>
<P><B>walked down the sidewalk.  So our house was always in </B>
<P><B>Mom's view.  No one had entered it--from the front anyway.  </B>
<P><B>When Mom got back to the house, she said that she could </B>
<P><B>hear music coming from it.  It sounded like someone had a </B>
<P><B>radio on inside. Mom reached for the storm glass screen </B>
<P><B>door to go inside.  The door was locked.  From the inside.  </B>
<P><B>Mom had clearly not locked it before stepping out to see </B>
<P><B>Brenda home.  Mom thought that someone had actually broken </B>
<P><B>in, and was in fact, still inside.  She ran down to </B>
<P><B>Brenda's house and they called the police.  When the </B>
<P><B>police arrived, they found a window that was unlocked that </B>
<P><B>they could go in through.  The cop opened up the front </B>
<P><B>door for Mom to come inside.  They went through the entire </B>
<P><B>house.  Nothing was missing.  No more music played.  In </B>
<P><B>fact, the only radio we owned at the time was my little </B>
<P><B>transistor.  It still sat up on the fireplace mantle.  It </B>
<P><B>couldn't have been playing though as it's battery was </B>
<P><B>dead.  It had been for quite awhile now.  No one was in </B>
<P><B>the house.  There was no explanation for any of it.  No </B>
<P><B>earthly one anyway!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Finally the day came for us to move out.  We were so happy </B>
<P><B>to be leaving this scary place.  We learned from the </B>
<P><B>neighbors that we had stayed longer than any of the other </B>
<P><B>people who had rented the house before us.  We stayed for </B>
<P><B>all of six months.  I just talked to my mom a few days </B>
<P><B>ago, and she said that the house sits empty at this very </B>
<P><B>moment.  That doesn't surprise me!  How about you?</B>

<H3><A NAME=rebel>Rebel</A>
</H3><P><B>by petersk@erols.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>    When I was little (between the ages of 2 and about 11) my dad would
leave me at his mother's house while he and my mother went out to the movies,
dinner, or went away for a weekend.  I have a younger sister who stayed with
me, but I do not remember what she was doing during this time.  I know she
must have been there, but she was not a memorable influence on this event.
 My father's sister, Beverly, kept in close contact with her mother; my
grandmother.  She was always calling and my grandmother loves to talk and
talk and talk.  Coupons, and who got into the Boumi Temple and what's going
on in the news, etc.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>    One day, while I was being baby-sat, I answered the phone at my
grandmother's house.  It was, of course, my aunt Bev.  "Is grandma there?"
she asked.  "Yup", I replied, and handed the phone to my grandmother.  As
my grandmother took the phone, I recall saying "Rebel's dead".</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>    My grandmother momentarily stopped and looked at me, and then continued
her conversation with my aunt.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>    Okay, here's the weird parts:  My aunt's dog's (a big black lab)
name is Rebel.  Also, she sounded perfectly normal over the phone.  I was
only eight or nine, but I am _sure_ of that.  As well, we hardly ever saw
my aunt, uncle, cousins, or dog except during holidays.  I had no particular
or strong connection to Rebel.  Besides, we had a cat at the time which made
me a cat person.  </B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>    So, my grandmother went in the other room (as far as the phone
cord permitted) and completed her conversation.  When she came back, she
said "What did you say earlier?"  I remember crying at this point and repeating:
"Rebel's dead".  My grandmother, after getting over her shock, told me Rebel
had been hit by a van.  My aunt and uncle have a huge yard and house on a
street that is almost totally empty.  It is a dead end road housing about
twelve neighbors.  It seemed impossible for Rebel (an outside dog anyway)

</H3><P><B>by Andrea</B>
<P>
<P><B>I thought I would share with you an experience that happened to me
(and my</B>
<P><B>sister) many years ago.  I am 35 now but when I was about 15 or 16
I used</B>
<P><B>to babysit this little girl who was around 2 years old.  Her parents
were a</B>
<P><B>bit odd to begin with, her father was a nutritionalist and her mother
was a</B>
<P><B>part time actress.  Front the get go I was a bit uncomfortable in
their</B>
<P><B>house.  I always had a very uneasy feeling about it.  They had very
strange</B>
<P><B>taste in furniture with a lot of tapestry paintings and some occcult</B>
<P><B>artifacts.  They also had many books on hauntings, the occult, etc.
</B>
<P>
<P><B>One summer they had asked my sister and I if we would stay in their
house</B>
<P><B>and babysit their daughter while they went on vacation.  I believe
they</B>
<P><B>were gone for about a week or two.  The day we moved in was the day
many</B>
<P><B>strange things started happening in their house.  The very first thing
I</B>
<P><B>remember was the baby's room was always ice cold.  It never seemed
to warm</B>
<P><B>up.  At the time we lived in the San Fernando Valley and it was in
the dead</B>
<P><B>of summer.  It gets very hot there.  Some times in the 90's or 100's.
 The</B>
<P><B>rest of the house was always comfortable or hot, except the baby's
room. </B>
<P><B>Both my sister and I would hate to go into that room.  For some reason
it</B>
<P><B>made us very uneasy.  At certain times during the day and night the
baby's</B>
<P><B>music boxes and toys would start playing.  It was Like someone had
wound</B>
<P><B>them all up at the same time.  That freaked us out so bad.  All of
the</B>
<P><B>sudden you could hear music coming from her room.  I slept in that
room</B>
<P><B>once and would never again.  Like I said, it was extremely cold and
I</B>
<P><B>always had an eery feeling in there.  The night I slept in there, if
you</B>
<P><B>could call it sleep.  I tossed and turned the whole night, too
frightened</B>
<P><B>to open my eyes.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We lasted in that house about one week.  Our last night there, we had
some</B>
<P><B>friends over and were telling them about the expierences we were having
and</B>
<P><B>how strange we felt there, one of our friends said that maybe the house
was</B>
<P><B>haunted, just when he said that, a heavy, brass lamp standing on an
end</B>
<P><B>table fell off with such force.  It looked like someone was throwing
it at</B>
<P><B>us.  All five of us just stared at the lamp on the floor. I had the
feeling</B>
<P><B>that someone or something was delibereatly trying to hit us with the
lamp. </B>
<P><B>That was the last time we stayed in the house.  We turned everything
off</B>
<P><B>and left.  We did return the next day to retrieve things for the baby.
</B>
<P><B>When we walked in the house, to our surprise, everything in the house
was</B>
<P><B>on.  The lights, the t.v., everything!  I never returned there until
the</B>
<P><B>parents came home.  We told them about our experiences, we asked if
they</B>
<P><B>had ghosts or anything unusal they would like to share.  They denied</B>
<P><B>anything strange happening to them.  That was the last time I ever
babysat</B>
<P><B>for them.  I felt too uncomforatble there.  We never saw anything.
 We only</B>
<P><B>felt it.  It didn't feel good.  They eventually moved from the house,
about</B>
<P><B>a year after our experience.  I'll never know who or what was in there,
but</B>
<P><B>I do know that it was something.  It wasn't our immagination.  Maybe
the</B>
<P><B>fact that my sister was with me, I know I'm not crazy.  She experienced
it</B>
<P><B>with me!  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Thank you for letting me share my story.  I haven't talked about that
in</B>
<P><B>such a long time!  I love your webpage.  It is very facinating.</B>

<P><B>My family and I used to live in a house we believed to be haunted.
Objects would often disappear only to reappear later affter exhautive searches.
Jewelery was the most often taken.  My mother went to sleep once with her
stud earrings in her ears and when she woke up the next morning one was missing.
My father and mother looked all around their bed for it but couldn't find
it. A week later, while shaving before going to work, my father heard something
clicking around in the bath tub. There was my mom's earing with the back
on it sliding around in the tub. He was in the bathroom alone with the door
closed and locked. Our bathroom was two rooms away from mom and dad's
bedroom.</B>
<P><B>Another time when only my sister, mother, and myself were home, I had
an experience. We were all in the kitchen talking, which was strange in it
self because my sister and I didn't get along. My mother had just started
a load of laundry and my sister wanted to add something to it. I said I would
retrieve it from her room for her after she told me where it was. Iwent to
her room and started looking for her sweater, I think, in the chair she told
me it was in. Out of the corner of my eye I saw movement by the door. I thought
that it was my sister checking up on me though I hadn't been looking very
long. </B>
<P><B>Then I saw her arm make a throwing motion, and a pain erupted on my
back. Iscooped up what she had thrown at me and ran after her yelling the
whole time. When I got to the kitchen my mother and sister were looking at
me like I'd gone completely crazy. I was still yelling at my sister for hitting
me with whatever it was, when my mother said that my sister had never moved.
"Oh yeah," I said, "then what do you call this!?" Holding out my hand to
reveal her high school class ring that had been missing for three months.</B>
<P><B>Of course we had plenty of strange noises and cold spots as well. Incidents
seemed not to happen as much when we let the house get dirty. </B>
