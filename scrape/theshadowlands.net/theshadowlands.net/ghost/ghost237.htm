<BR><B>Three Ghost Experiences</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By:Amy.Neal@connect.xerox.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello,</B>
<BR><B>I, too, am a believer in the supernatural.&nbsp; I honestly believe
that if there</B>
<BR><B>is a way for us to communicate with those who have passed on, whether
in our</B>
<BR><B>dreams, actually "seeing" an entity or possibly receiving a message
from a</B>
<BR><B>close family member.&nbsp; All three of my experiences have been
with my Mother</B>
<BR><B>and my Great Aunt Mildred These two ladies were "kindred spirits"
as my Aunt</B>
<BR><B>had put it.&nbsp; The entire family strongly believed in angels
and are a</B>
<BR><B>God-fearing family.</B>
<BR><B>#1</B>
<BR><B>The first incident occurred around November 1987, a year and 1 month
after</B>
<BR><B>my mother's death.&nbsp; She had been ill with pancreatic cancer
and it took her</B>
<BR><B>life so quickly.&nbsp; I had decided not to go back to college in
August of 1987</B>
<BR><B>and stayed home with my father and younger brother (I was 20 years
old when</B>
<BR><B>this first occurrence happened...I am the middle child between two</B>
<BR><B>brothers).&nbsp; It was mid-evening, around 7:30-8:00pm, when I
received a phone</B>
<BR><B>call from my cousin, David, who was like a 2nd older brother to
me -- my</B>
<BR><B>cousin is the eldest of 3 boys, all of who were like brothers to
me.&nbsp; When I</B>
<BR><B>picked up the receiver I was totally surprised to hear his voice.&nbsp;
He very</B>
<BR><B>seldom would call and I knew it had to be important because he almost
never</B>
<BR><B>called long distance (the last time he called was when his father,
my Great</B>
<BR><B>Uncle Jim, had died).&nbsp; I distinctly remember the voice he had
.. it was the</B>
<BR><B>same when he called regarding my Uncle dying -- I had answered the
phone</B>
<BR><B>that night as well.</B>
<BR><B>As my cousin David began to speak to me I could tell he was serious
and that</B>
<BR><B>he needed to desperately tell me something.&nbsp; As he began to
speak, I</B>
<BR><B>couldn't believe what he was telling me!&nbsp; He had had a dream
about my Mother</B>
<BR><B>and telling him to talk to me and that I needed help...to do as
my Father</B>
<BR><B>had asked me to do.&nbsp; My Father and I were at constant odds
-- you see, I was</B>
<BR><B>still at college when my mother died and never saw her before she
passed</B>
<BR><B>away.&nbsp; My cousin continued to tell me he hasn't had a dream
this strong or</B>
<BR><B>intense in years.&nbsp; He said to me "I know something is wrong
and that things</B>
<BR><B>aren't right between you and your Dad ... I know this because your
Mother</B>
<BR><B>told me .... She told me that she wants you to do what you know
that needs</B>
<BR><B>to be done .... Go and talk to someone ... She's worried about you
and she</B>
<BR><B>knows you're hurting".&nbsp; I was in tears by the middle of the
conversation.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>told my Father about the incident just recently and he was not happy
that my</B>
<BR><B>cousin would do such a thing.&nbsp; He doesn't believe in those
sorts of</B>
<BR><B>"dreams".&nbsp; I did go and speak to someone after that phone call,
but only</B>
<BR><B>because it was a condition that my Father had given to me if I wanted
to</B>
<BR><B>continue living at home.&nbsp; He was suffering just as I was but
was in such</B>
<BR><B>denial during that time in November, 1997 that it put a rift between
us for</B>
<BR><B>many years after that.&nbsp; I am happy to say that we have patched
those points</B>
<BR><B>over and have slowly gotten closer, not as much as we were before
my Mother</B>
<BR><B>died, but it's better.</B>
<BR><B>#2</B>
<BR><B>The occurrence took place almost 1 1/2 years after my mother's death.&nbsp;
It</B>
<BR><B>was during the Summer; I had moved out of my Father's house and
moved in</B>
<BR><B>with a friend of mine into a one bedroom apartment.&nbsp; She was
needing help</B>
<BR><B>with finances and I wanted to get out of the house (being 21 I was
wanting</B>
<BR><B>to be "out on my own and doing what I wanted to do").&nbsp; We moved
my stuff in</B>
<BR><B>and used the twin beds my Father had stored in his basement.&nbsp;
It was about a</B>
<BR><B>month after I had moved in when I had the strange "dream".&nbsp;
I call it a</B>
<BR><B>dream because I wasn't sure if I had dreamed it or if it actually
happened.</B>
<BR><B>It was early morning, around 2am.&nbsp; I recall that I was having
a bad dream</B>
<BR><B>and was feeling very uneasy.&nbsp; I awoke when I felt someone stroking
the right</B>
<BR><B>side of my hair ever so gently.&nbsp; I opened my eyes slightly
and saw, or</B>
<BR><B>thought I saw, my roommate sitting on the edge of my bed and stroking
my</B>
<BR><B>hair.&nbsp; She had a pleasant and comforting smile on her face.&nbsp;
I remember</B>
<BR><B>saying to her "that's what my mother used to do".&nbsp; It lasted
for only a few</B>
<BR><B>minutes.&nbsp; I then turned my head to face one of the walls in
the room (my bed</B>
<BR><B>was in a corner of the room at the time) and when I turned my head
back my</B>
<BR><B>roommate wasn't there.&nbsp; I sat up and looked over to the other
side of the</B>
<BR><B>room where her bed was at and she was fast asleep.&nbsp; When I
talked to her</B>
<BR><B>about it the following morning she said, very bluntly "you were
dreaming ...</B>
<BR><B>I didn't do that ... I came home and went straight to bed after
work" -- she</B>
<BR><B>was a waitress at a local restaurant and some times had the late
shift.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>kept insisting it was her that had done that, but when I really
thought</B>
<BR><B>about it, it couldn't have been her.&nbsp; One, I never felt her
get up from the</B>
<BR><B>edge of my bed, and I never heard her walk back over to her side
of the</B>
<BR><B>bedroom and get back into bed.&nbsp; The whole place was quiet.&nbsp;
I'm not sure why</B>
<BR><B>my Mother made this visit to me but it was nice being reminded she
was still</B>
<BR><B>my Mother and she knew how to comfort her children, even if she
wasn't able</B>
<BR><B>to be there in the physical sense.</B>
<BR><B>#3</B>
<BR><B>This was THE MOST unbelievable experience of my life!&nbsp; I can
honestly say I</B>
<BR><B>have seen apparitions and I dare anyone to argue with me that I
didn't see</B>
<BR><B>what I know I saw ... not only me but the guy I was dating at the
time saw</B>
<BR><B>it as well!</B>
<BR><B>It was in July of 1991.&nbsp; I had moved up to North Eastern Ohio
to move in</B>
<BR><B>with and help out my ailing Grandmother, my mother's Mother (the
small town</B>
<BR><B>of Ashtabula, Ohio, to be exact which is about an hour East of Cleveland,</B>
<BR><B>Ohio).&nbsp; That was and I can honestly say, one of the best summers
I had ever</B>
<BR><B>had.&nbsp; I was working part time and going to the beach practically
every other</B>
<BR><B>day.&nbsp; This is also where I met a former boyfriend, Bill.&nbsp;
He was a friend of</B>
<BR><B>my cousins.&nbsp; The occurrence took place about 2 weeks after
my Great Aunt</B>
<BR><B>Mildred (Auntie Mimi is what we called her) had died.&nbsp; One
evening, there</B>
<BR><B>was a group of us gathered in the small kitchen of the family Cape
Cod --</B>
<BR><B>the kitchen is "T" shaped; there is a side entrance to the kitchen
and the</B>
<BR><B>walkway through the kitchen intersected with an open hall that took
you</B>
<BR><B>either to their huge music room, left, or to the living and bedrooms,
right.</B>
<BR><B>Bill and I were leaning against the counter where the kitchen sink
was and</B>
<BR><B>my cousin was sitting at the kitchen table with a couple of his
friends.&nbsp; We</B>
<BR><B>had had a few beers (no, I wasn't drunk at the time) and talking
up a storm.</B>
<BR><B>As Bill and I stood there, I caught something out of the corner
of my left</B>
<BR><B>eye.&nbsp; I kept my peripheral vision on the object and turned
my head so that</B>
<BR><B>both eyes were focused on what I was seeing.&nbsp; There is a light
at the</B>
<BR><B>intersecting open hallway that met with the walkway to the kitchen
-- the</B>
<BR><B>light was on at the time and as I kept looking over in that direction,
I</B>
<BR><B>could clearly make out my Auntie Mimi walking from the light of
the room</B>
<BR><B>into the darkness of the living room.&nbsp; I could clearly make
out her height</B>
<BR><B>(she was only about 5'), blonde hair that was cut short with the
semi-tight</B>
<BR><B>curl as she always wore it, and wearing the robe I had gotten for
her:</B>
<BR><B>white heavy terry-cloth with big pink and red flowers on it.&nbsp;
My boyfriend,</B>
<BR><B>Bill was standing there and I didn't know if he had seen what I
did.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>slowly, and quietly turned my head towards him after my Aunt vanished
and</B>
<BR><B>said to him "Dddid you just see....???"&nbsp; He hushed me at that
point and</B>
<BR><B>whispered to me "yes I did .. don't say anything .. I don't want
your cousin</B>
<BR><B>to get upset".&nbsp; Just then my cousin, with his big booming voice,
asked "HEY!</B>
<BR><B>What are you two whispering over there?!?"&nbsp; His back was to
the hallway so</B>
<BR><B>he had no idea what we had just witnessed.&nbsp; I looked at Bill
and motioned</B>
<BR><B>for him to say something.&nbsp; Finally, Bill gave in and said "oh,
nothing</B>
<BR><B>really ... we just Mildred going into the living room" -- his version
of</B>
<BR><B>what she was wearing differed from mine.&nbsp; He said she was wearing
a terry</B>
<BR><B>cloth long blue robe that had belonged her late husband.&nbsp; I
disagreed with</B>
<BR><B>him in hopes that I wasn't imaging it.&nbsp; My cousin, immediately
and rather</B>
<BR><B>enthused by what just happened said "OH!&nbsp; That's just Ma going
in to</B>
<BR><B>bed...NIGHT, MA!!"&nbsp;&nbsp; His friends even chimed in "G'night,
Mrs. C!!" (she had</B>
<BR><B>started sleeping on the couch most nights since her husband had
passed away</B>
<BR><B>several years back).&nbsp; My cousin got up from the table and walked
over to me.</B>
<BR><B>He was a big man, 6'4" and 280# if not more.&nbsp; He put is hands
on my</B>
<BR><B>shoulder's and looked me square in the eyes and said "She loved
you very</B>
<BR><B>much....she was just wanting to see what everyone was doing and
checking up</B>
<BR><B>on us...that's all...it's okay?".&nbsp; My cousin told me that she
had died in</B>
<BR><B>the robe I had gotten for her.&nbsp; I looked at my cousin and told
him I was</B>
<BR><B>alright; it was just something I thought I'd never experience in
my</B>
<BR><B>lifetime.&nbsp; I was glad I did.&nbsp; It showed me that those
we love and those that</B>
<BR><B>love us are there, whether we see them or not.&nbsp; What made it
even better was</B>
<BR><B>that I wasn't the only one who saw her!!&nbsp; I'm glad I wasn't
because then I</B>
<BR><B>would have to chalk it up to being my imagination playing tricks
on me!</B>
<BR><B>Thanks, Auntie Mimi!!&nbsp; That was a night I will NEVER forget!</B>

<P><B>The Soldier</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: anaxerete@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This was a sighting that I experienced when I was approximately ten
years</B>
<BR><B>old.&nbsp; Now, it happened so long ago that some of the details
are a little</B>
<BR><B>vague, but one thing I do remember clearly is that it was in the
summer and</B>
<BR><B>my younger sister and I were outside at night, playing with our
skipping</B>
<BR><B>rope on the driveway.&nbsp; The neighbourhood we live in is pretty
quiet with</B>
<BR><B>very few pedestrians walking about, and little traffic (for example,
one car</B>
<BR><B>passes every hour).&nbsp; Although this happened at night, the streets
are</B>
<BR><B>lighted by streetlamps, and since it was a clear summer evening,
visibility</B>
<BR><B>was quite good, and the sighting happened only about 15 metres from
where we</B>
<BR><B>were, so I could see pretty well.</B>
<BR><B>So, there my sister and I are, having fun with our skipping rope,
and my</B>
<BR><B>eyes wander for a moment to across the road where I see this man
wearing a</B>
<BR><B>uniform.&nbsp; It reminds me of a uniform worn by those in the American
army,</B>
<BR><B>circa 1700 or 1800, similar to the kind I've seen George Washington
wear in</B>
<BR><B>portraits of him.&nbsp; Now, some of you may think that perhaps
this wasn't an</B>
<BR><B>apparition at all, and merely some very patriotic American playing</B>
<BR><B>dress-up....&nbsp; Well, this happened in Canada and finding someone
wandering a</B>
<BR><B>suburban street while wearing an old Amercian army outfit like that
really</B>
<BR><B>doesn't happen.&nbsp; Even so, the figure of the man, as life-like
as he</B>
<BR><B>appeared, still looked out of the ordinary, aside from the uniform.&nbsp;
Now, I</B>
<BR><B>don't know if apparitions appear in colour often, but this one did,
but they</B>
<BR><B>weren't vibrant colours, they were more washed out and barely perceptible.</B>
<BR><B>His entire body was hazy, and although he appeared in a perfectly
formed</B>
<BR><B>human shape, there was a diaphanous quality to him, as if a fine,
grayish</B>
<BR><B>mist was enveloping him.&nbsp; Even his gait was out of the ordinary.&nbsp;
He walked,</B>
<BR><B>but his movements seemed impeded and light, as if he were walking
through</B>
<BR><B>water and gravity was having no affect on him.&nbsp; All in all,
he moved in slow</B>
<BR><B>motion.&nbsp; Also, he held something in his left hand, though I
couldn't clearly</B>
<BR><B>make out what it was.&nbsp; I know it was rectangular in shape,
almost like a</B>
<BR><B>plaque, but I was too far away to see it, and he himself was slightly</B>
<BR><B>blurred so it was difficult to make out distinct, minute details.</B>
<BR><B>Now, I watched, frozen and speechless for about five seconds before
I got a</B>
<BR><B>look at his eyes, which weren't really eyes at all.&nbsp; They were
more like dim</B>
<BR><B>balls of light, which I saw only when he turned his head in my direction.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>should explain that he was in profile while he walked throughout
the entire</B>
<BR><B>sighting.&nbsp; Now, if seeing him didn't freak me out, that did.&nbsp;
I dropped my</B>
<BR><B>skipping rope, grabbed my sister's hand and dragged her into the
house,</B>
<BR><B>explaining that it was too cold outside to play.&nbsp; Although
it was still warm</B>
<BR><B>outside, I really did feel a chill run through me.</B>
<BR><B>I haven't researched my area and I'm not certain if my part of the
country</B>
<BR><B>was ever visited or used by American troops, but since I'm not a
historian</B>
<BR><B>or an expert in 18th/19th century military history or uniforms,
it could</B>
<BR><B>have been a Canadian soldier from one of those eras as well, though
it was a</B>
<BR><B>blue coat he wore, so I might be erroneously associating that with
an</B>
<BR><B>American soldier.</B>
<BR><B>Sometimes I have thought that perhaps it was just a dream from long
ago, but</B>
<BR><B>I'm not one to remember dreams, even when I first awaken, and this
memory</B>
<BR><B>has stayed with me all those years, and vividly, so I'm inclined
to believe</B>
<BR><B>it was real.&nbsp; But, since I have never seen him again after
that day, I'll</B>
<BR><B>never really be able to say for certain.&nbsp; All I know is that
I will never,</B>
<BR><B>ever forget him.</B>

<BR><B>Uncles Keys</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:chrisrindfleisch@snet.net</B>
<BR><B>This is a story my Uncle told me. One night he came home late from
work and he was exhausted. He dropped his keys on an end table in the living
room. Then he went straight to bed. He had about ten keys on his key ring
for various things. The next day when he woke up, he got ready to go to
work. When he went back to get his keys, he saw them all spread out on
the table in a circular pattern, with all of the points of the keys pointing
towards the edge of the table. All of them had been taken off of the key
ring. He says that nobody was with him in his house that night, and he
would never have had the reason, (or the patience) to take ALL of the keys
off the ring. I thought this story was rather interesting and thought that
it could be put on your site. I have always been a fan of the paranormal
and was interested in stories by people I know. If you have any questions,
you can E-mail me at chrisrindfleisch@snet.net</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Crytsal Prizm</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Erin.Elster@pinnacol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My Grandmother died back in 1988, I was 12 yrs old (now am 26).&nbsp;
She had a long and pretty painful death, pancreatic cancer.&nbsp; The whole
family went to her home&nbsp; town to basically "wait" for her demise to
occur.&nbsp; In her Hospital room, she had a crystal Priam...that was stuck
to her window. To this day, I don't&nbsp; have a clue as to who gave it
to her, or who even put it there. But it was there.&nbsp; This is was the
start of it, I believe anyway.</B>
<BR><B>About a year later, Mom ,my two brothers and I&nbsp; had moved into
a house, from an apartment.&nbsp; Nothing happened at that time, not till
my Mother went back to her hometown and retrieved some of my Grandmother's
belongings, furniture, personal items, things she had left my Mother in
her will.&nbsp; Along with the furniture, my Grandma had left me ( her
ONLY granddaughter)&nbsp; a ceramic Southern Belle Lady lamp.&nbsp; For
years, my mother had called it the "T.V. Lady", as it sat on the television
for decoration.&nbsp; Beautiful piece. I had put that in my bedroom on
a night table as my bedside lamp. I LOVED it.&nbsp; Anyway, that's when
things got weird.</B>
<BR><B>The Prism that was in my Grandmothers hospital room, had gone up
in the kitchen above the sink on the window looking out to the back yard.&nbsp;
Just a brief description of the Prism, it was a crytal,&nbsp; hanging from
a string, that was attached to one of those little sucker things you can
stick to a window, or any glass for that matter.&nbsp; Anyway, my mother
thought that would be a great place for it to go...soooo pretty and all,
YEAH, right.</B>
<BR><B>>From then on, strange things began to happen in that house.&nbsp;
Not only was it just my family that experienced it, it was friends who
came to stay in that house as well.&nbsp; These instances are not in order,
bare with me.&nbsp; We would hear footsteps,&nbsp; ALOT down in the basement,
on SEVERAL occasions, while my mother was alone, she had heard the footsteps
by herself.&nbsp; My brothers and I (being teenagers) were gone one evening.&nbsp;
My mother was in her bedroom (now consisted of the twin beds my grandfather
and grandmother shared...one of the beds my grandfather had died in when
my mother was a teen) a night table and t.v. all from my grandmother.&nbsp;
Anyways, my mother was sitting on her bed reading a book, when she heard
footsteps coming from the hallway, leading to her door.&nbsp; She said
her heart SANK, thinking someone was in the house about to turn the corner
and do the unspeakable to her.&nbsp; Nothing ever turned the corner. She
got up, reached around the wall and flipped the lights on...NOTHING.&nbsp;
She SWORE up and down she heard footsteps coming down the hall.&nbsp; One
other time with her, I remember being woken up early in the morning BEFORE
it was time to get up and get ready for school. My mother was yelling at
the top of her lungs, down the stairs that lead to the basement.."Who's
down there"&nbsp; ofcourse my brothers and I woke up asking what the heck
she was doing. She stated that she DISTINCTLY heard someone running up
and down the stairs and then run down, slam the dryer door shut, and start
playing the guitar (my brother had a guitar down there).&nbsp; She woke
up to see what my brother was doing, and he was dead asleep in his bed,
my older brother was asleep on the couch and I had been asleep in my room.&nbsp;
She was scared.&nbsp; She stated that she had heard someone run down the
stairs alot, thinking it was one of us, but only to find us gone and noone
else in the house.&nbsp; One time, my oldest brother, my mom and I were
sitting in the living room watching T.V, when all of asudden, we saw a
shadow walk across the wall, slowly.&nbsp; It didn't bother us at first
untill it kept walking across, back and forth, back and forth. Finally,
my mother and I ran out front to see if someone was walking around outside
and my brother went out back, noone.&nbsp; It happened again, we would
all run outside, still, noone.&nbsp; The shadow wasn't in a position of
where it would show on the wall from someone outside.&nbsp; Finally, when
it happened again, my mom said "Look, it looks like Grandma"...and it did.&nbsp;
As soon as she said that it stopped.</B>
<BR><B>Our dogs would always look up toward the ceiling like something
was there.&nbsp; We always heard like footstpes, like someone was wearing
high-heels, walking in the basement about to come up the stairs, and then
nothing.&nbsp; It sounded like they had changed their mind and walked away,
then would decide to come up the stairs again, then change their mind again
(the floor was concrete in the basement).&nbsp; In my room I always heard
a sighing noise in the corner, by my closet.&nbsp; At first I would look
outside my door thinking it was my dog, with his nose under the door outside
in the hall.&nbsp; But it wasn't.&nbsp; One dog ALWAYS slept with my in
my bed, so I knew it wasn't him, and the other always on the couch in the
living room.&nbsp; But always, just this sighing noise.&nbsp; A couple
of times, I would go stay the weekend at a friends house and my brother's
would have friends stay in my room and they ALWAYS heard the sighing too,
never been told of it before.&nbsp; One friend of my older brother, claimed
he had awoken with someone staring over him a couple of times, in my room
and the livingroom.&nbsp; The scariest experience, for ME anyway, was that
of when I had one of my friends stay the night, we had been in my room
and were just about to lay down for the night, when I just turned off my
T.V. lady and laid down, someone whispered "Muffy"..that is the nickname
my Gandma gave me.&nbsp; Which my friend had not known.&nbsp; Just then
I asked my friend "What"?? she asked me, "What did you say"?&nbsp; OH MAN,
we both sat up, the hair standing up all over my neck and arms. That was
the scariest thing I have ever heard, I will never forget that.</B>
<BR><B>The funny thing is, that one day,&nbsp; my ever so LIVELY brother
was washing his hands at the kitchen sink and accidently hit the prizm
knocking it into the sink, breaking it. After that there was NOTHING else
that had happened.&nbsp; We ended up moving into another house, bringing
along her other belongings (furniture, etc) and nothing again had happened.&nbsp;
STRANGE, somehow I think maybe her spirit ended up in that Prizm after
she died.&nbsp; And</B>
<BR><B>when it was broke, maybe her spirit was set free.......POSSIBLE???</B>

<BR><B>The Picture</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: LiLnick9128@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>We had a guest staying with our family for a while.&nbsp; She had
brought some</B>
<BR><B>pictures and one of the pictures was of me as a young child.&nbsp;
All of a sudden</B>
<BR><B>whenever our guest went to bed she would make sure the picture was
upright.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning the picture was face down on her desk.&nbsp; This
happened for a</B>
<BR><B>week straight and no one had been in her room between the time she
had gone</B>
<BR><B>to bed and the time she woke up the next morning.&nbsp; One day
I decided to look</B>
<BR><B>at the picture, I took out the picture from it's frame and looked
at it's</B>
<BR><B>backing. It said my name, but I recently changed my last name and
my old last</B>
<BR><B>name was still on the back, so I scratched out my old last name
and rewrote</B>
<BR><B>my new last name on the back and this occurrence never happened
again.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>weird thing is that my grandmother just died and she didn't like
my old</B>

<BR><B>***MOMMY WHERE ARE YOU*****</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Foolish428@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I was about 6 or 7 years old and living in Louisiana. I woke up one
morning</B>
<BR><B>and heard my mothers vocie yell "Nina? You Awake?". So I hopped
out of my bed</B>
<BR><B>and headed downstairs. I made my first stop to the kitchen thinking
my mom</B>
<BR><B>was cooking breakfast. But there was nothing but straight silence
throughout</B>
<BR><B>the whole house. so i yelled "Where you at mommy?" and then she
replied, "I</B>
<BR><B>am in the bathroom". So i casually walked over there and the door
was open</B>
<BR><B>and the sink was on. So I turned it off. I was starting to be annoyed
and</B>
<BR><B>yelled "Mom where are you?" and then again repiled "Im in landery
room" , So</B>
<BR><B>this time I ran to the landery room. Still no one. But the iron
was on. I</B>
<BR><B>started to cry and yelled "Mom, this aint funny!" Then 10 seconds
later, i</B>
<BR><B>heard my familys car pull up in the drive way, i ran to the window
and saw my</B>
<BR><B>Mom, dad, and sister getting out of the car with some wal-mart bags.
i told</B>
<BR><B>them what happened. . . but of course they didnt believe me.</B>
<BR><B>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</B>
<BR><B>This next incident happened recently, my friend was stayin the night
over my</B>
<BR><B>place. and dedcided to sleep in the basement (my basement aint creepy,
its a</B>
<BR><B>nice room.) We had our sleeping bags all set up and everything,
and was</B>
<BR><B>chilling and talking about school, boys and stuff of that nature.
Then I</B>
<BR><B>started to feel akward, in a huanted sort of way. As if there was
someone</B>
<BR><B>next to me. So i asked my friend for me and her to trade spaces
and she was</B>
<BR><B>like "nooo" , so i tugged on her sleeping bag then all of the sudden
a white</B>
<BR><B>light flew over our heads (I was bright, and it was low). there
was like 5</B>
<BR><B>seconds of silence, and me and my friend just looked at eachother.
then I</B>
<BR><B>said " You saw that right?", her eyes were wide and skin was pale
as she</B>
<BR><B>nodded yes and described it. Then we heard somethin stratching the
door, we</B>
<BR><B>both ran upstairs and where scared that we couldnt sleep.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Stories when I was Younger</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: susanthompson@sasktel.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Janis.&nbsp; I live in a small city in Saskatchewan, Canada,
called Saskatoon.&nbsp; My sister happened to stumble along your website
and she told me about it, so I started reading some of the stories.&nbsp;
They reminded me of a few incidents that occurred when I was probably about
9 or 10.&nbsp; My other sister at the time would have been 5 or 6 years
old.&nbsp; My grandpa was in the hospital with a brain tumor.&nbsp; The
doctors had operated and removed it via surgery, but my grandpa remained
quite sick.&nbsp; The hospital decided to send him home to die in peace.&nbsp;
The night he died, my sister was sleeping in my mom's room,( which we all
did when we were that young).&nbsp; My mom was sound asleep, when she felt
Heather (my sister) sit up in her bed and heard her talking to someone.&nbsp;
My mom said that Heather had her eyes closed, but had a slight smile on
her face and a subtle glow about her.&nbsp; My mom watched, and after a
few short minutes, Heather just lied back down and continued to sleep.&nbsp;
In the morning, Heather said grandpa had came and talked to her.&nbsp;
She said he was floating at the end of the bed and told her not to be sad:
that he was happy and free.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We still own the bed in which my grandpa died
in, but we really had no use for it since my sister and I shared bunk beds,
so we put it in the guest room.&nbsp; When my sister decided a few years
later that she wanted her own room, my parents moved her into the spare
room.&nbsp; Now me and Heather shared a room.&nbsp; Jen,( my older sister
who moved into the spare room), found it very uneasy to sleep in her new
room, but my parents dismissed it as just being not used to being by herself
at night, which would make sense.&nbsp; She would often tell me she would
always feel as though someone was watching her sleep, and when she would
wake up in the morning, the light in her closet would be on, even though
she had turned it off.&nbsp; She only slept in the spare room for a few
months until she wanted to move downstairs because she was "too grown up
to sleep upstairs".&nbsp; I moved into the spare room because I wanted
my own room.&nbsp; I too felt as though someone was watching me, but it
was oddly a very comforting feeling, so I didn't mind.&nbsp; On occasion,
my closet light would be on in the mornings, though I too didn't turn it
on the night before.&nbsp; Years passed, and Jen moved to Calgary and I
moved out with a friend.&nbsp; At this time I had a room built in the basement
of my moms house, so i moved down there and got a new, bigger bed.&nbsp;
However, when I moved out, my bed was too much hassle to move, so I took
the old single one from the spare room.&nbsp; The first night I slept in
my own house in my old bed, and I was feeling quite uneasy about being
on my own, in my own house without my family.&nbsp; When I decided to go
to sleep after our "house warming party", I laid down on my bed, and a
sense of reassurance just seemed to wash over me.&nbsp; It was kinda creepy
to have that feeling again, but it doesn't scare me because I know that
if it is anything at all, it is my grandpa watching over us and making
sure we are safe.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second incident also happened to Heather.&nbsp;
My older sister and I were home babysitting her one day.&nbsp; We were
teasing her and had locked her in her room to scare her.&nbsp; She was
screaming and screaming, but we just held the door closed on her.&nbsp;
When she stopped yelling, we let her out and she said she had seen my great
aunt Janet rise through the floor and through the ceiling of her room.&nbsp;
My aunt had also just had a painful battle with cancer, which resulted
in her death.</B>

<P><B>By: simone.hornsby@genzyme.com</B>
<BR><B>This may all sound abit vague but I live at St Georges Manor, Oxford
which</B>
<BR><B>was an Old Lunitic Asylum built in 1840 and opened on 1st August
1846 as a</B>
<BR><B>mental hospital.&nbsp; The building was changed&nbsp; into residential
facilities in</B>
<BR><B>1997.&nbsp; I have only lived there for about a year and have only
experienced 2</B>
<BR><B>episodes of abnormal happenings.</B>
<BR><B>First one was the kettle in the Kitchen turned itself on while we
were</B>
<BR><B>standing talking in the kitchen.</B>
<BR><B>Second happening was the early hours of this morning 03h00am.&nbsp;
My partner</B>
<BR><B>had woken to use the toilet.&nbsp; About 10 minutes after settling
back down</B>
<BR><B>again my little boy's bedroom door slammed shut - there were no
windows open</B>
<BR><B>in his room and the door handle needs to be used to actually close
the door.</B>
<BR><B>My little boy was fast asleep as we thought maybe he had closed
it but he is</B>
<BR><B>only 3 years old.</B>
<BR><B>You have probably heard many, many different stories but I thought

<P><B>Several Encounters</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bwilliams11@charter.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Many Strange things have happened tome.&nbsp; LOTS of horrible&nbsp;
things have happened to my dad.&nbsp; I will start with my experiences
since mine are shorter.&nbsp; 3 years ago we moved into this trailor.&nbsp;
When we moved there I began to&nbsp; have horrifying dreams.&nbsp; Most
of the time I would wake up crying!&nbsp; They were that vivid.&nbsp; I
had a pretty big room.&nbsp; I hated the room.&nbsp; I always felt someone
was watching me.&nbsp; Like something was going to get me in that room.&nbsp;
It was ALWAYS cold in that room.&nbsp; You could come from the living room
into my room and your teeth would chatter so bad you couldn't stay there
long.&nbsp; So anyways I was having terrible dreams.&nbsp; When we first
moved I had reacurring slave dreams.&nbsp; The one that I remember the
most was a woman was running through the woods very fast with her newborn.&nbsp;
she was bieng chased by white men and guard dogs.&nbsp; All of a sudden
she falls and breaks her ankle.&nbsp; She quickly gets up and hobbles the
rest of the way.&nbsp; She comes to the river and ahe still holds her baby
crying and then she puts the baby underwater.&nbsp; Then she dives in the
water and drowns herself.&nbsp; Then when she floats up It is me!&nbsp;
I was really shaken up about this dream.&nbsp; Ok on with it.&nbsp; I still
have dreams and They get so bad that I Wouldn't sleep in that trailor at
all.&nbsp; I would stay up all night and sleep all day.&nbsp; I heard footsteps,
saw shadowy figures out of the corner of my eye.&nbsp; On one occasion
my dad was home taking a bath.&nbsp; I was asleep on the couch.&nbsp; And
the way our kitchen was you have the living room and to the right there
was the counter you walk maybe 4 paces and htere was the kitchen.&nbsp;
Well my dad said while he was taking a bath he heard a very loud BANG.&nbsp;
So he got out of the tub to investigate it.&nbsp; When he went into the
kitchen he only saw a pill bottle on top of a vent.&nbsp; He said he looked
at me and I was still asleep.&nbsp; The pill bottle was on the center of
the counter.&nbsp; There was no way it dropped on its own.&nbsp; Were it
laid it had to be thrown.&nbsp; So after dad woke me up we conducted a
little expeirment and the only possible way was for it had to be thrown.&nbsp;
There was times when I laid on the couch dozing off when I was jerked awake
by the feeling of someone breathing o my cheek.&nbsp; I could even smell
what would be thier "breath" .&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally I couldn't take sleeping
in that room anymore.&nbsp; So my parents and I switched rooms.&nbsp; Before
we did I asked my dad for all the religeous stuff he could give me.&nbsp;
His mom( who is deceased) drew this really beautiful picture of Jesus Thar
hung in my room.&nbsp; His mom had given him some blessed patches there
were two of htem.&nbsp; My dad gave me one.&nbsp; I had crosses and rosery
beads my friend gave me.&nbsp; My dad always taught me to say the Lord's
Prayer if I ever felt scared.&nbsp; So When I get settled in my new room
I feel much safer.&nbsp; But my head board has two mirrors on it while
i was looking in the mirror and in the very corner I saw what would appear
to be a childs hand print but the only child we had in the house was my
niece and her hands were much bigger than the one in the mirror.&nbsp;
If that wasn't freaky in itself there was no sign of finger prints.&nbsp;
The whole time we lived in that house I sensed a child's presense.&nbsp;
Well That was about it.&nbsp; Now on to some of my dad's experiences.&nbsp;
My dad has seen&nbsp; dead bodies in the basement,&nbsp; when my grandfather
didn't.&nbsp; They (his family) used to live in a two story house my dad's
room was up in the attic.&nbsp; The family cat ended up in his window wanting
in!&nbsp; How could the cat ended up there?&nbsp; No trees nothing.&nbsp;
He has seen figures smoking.&nbsp; One particular incident he said his
cat just had kittens.&nbsp; One day him and his mom came home from somewere(can't
remember) and they went into the house and there was cats blood and pieces
of them everywhere. Even&nbsp; on the ceiling.&nbsp; The house was locked
no one couldv'e got in.&nbsp;&nbsp; his mom tried to clean but it came
back.&nbsp; I can't remember how it dissapeared but it did.&nbsp; My dad
has this gift of knowing things like physcic in a way.&nbsp; But only things
that are about people he loves.&nbsp; His mom had the same gift to.&nbsp;
She knew that president kennedy died 20 minutes before the news showed
he died.&nbsp; I have this gift too.&nbsp; The night before the WTC attacks
I had dreamed the whole thing.&nbsp; My dad saved my moms life.&nbsp; If
my dad had not told her to go to the docter she couldv'e died of cancer.&nbsp;
I think this gift that we all have is bound and from God.&nbsp; I am so
luck that the Ghosts I had encounters with did not harm me or my family.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Bizarre</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: nwplv@enter.net</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; I’ve seen a lot of unexplainable things in my lifetime but
nothing as bizarre as in the spring of 1987. My good friend Franky and
I moved into a run down farmhouse in Topton, Pennsylvania. Basically we
decided to dedicate all of our time to fixing the residence so we could
invite all of our pals up for “shin digs”. One night I was home alone.
Early in the morning while I was caulking the shower in the master bath,
I heard a grizzled voice say: “do I have to earn a spot?” I turned around
and looked down the hall and saw absolutely nothing! I was terrified. It
was dark in the house, it was dark outside…I couldn’t wait for Franky to
get home. I waited up in the living room contemplating if I should answer
the voice, and even what kind of answer I would give. I turned on the television
for a distraction (I’ll never forget that Night Rider was on) and all of
sudden I heard it again like it was sitting right next to me. The voice
said “Ya got change for a quarter?” and even before I could answer it bellowed
out “A mans gotta eat!” I couldn’t take it anymore. I yelled profanities
at it… told it to go away…and it did for quite a few years. Franky came
home that night and I told him what happened, he didn’t even come close
to believing me. I was upset about that for quite some time. Then came
the day came that he and I were working on a drywall project in the basement.
I went into the adjacent room to get my utility knife, then I heard “ I’ve
made my share of mistakes!” I came back in the room and asked Franky to
repeat what he said, he was pale white and trembling and he said: “I didn’t
say a word”. We have moved since that time. We had a few more encounters
with the spirit that we named “Luper” for some reason that I can’t recall.
We never found out who he was or what he wanted. We knew that he wasn’t
hostile even though he sounded that way…he just had a lot to say.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Past Relatives</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: scary_gurlie@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well, many people in my family have died in the last 6 years or so,
quite a few of them were close relatives.&nbsp; My mom, uncle, and aunt
all grew up in a house haunted by many many ghosts.&nbsp; There are many
stories that she tells me, and I can't write this without having at least
one light one.&nbsp; When she was very little they watched a small picture
of Jesus and a lamb float across the room, attach itself to a wall, and
float back.&nbsp; My aunt is convinced that the devil was in their home,
or at least a terrible demon.&nbsp; I'm going to have to have my mom tell
me word for word these stories to get them correctly sent to you.&nbsp;
They have given me nightmares for most of my life.&nbsp; My experiences
are quite small and insignificant compared to hers.&nbsp; When I was three
years old, my great grandfather died on Christmas Morning.&nbsp; I had
waken my mother up at about 730 by yelling for her from my crib.&nbsp;
I told her that my grandpa had been there, and she just loo is my mothers
sister, when she lived with us for a while.&nbsp; She was in the basement
unpacking when she heard her name called.&nbsp; She ran upstairs only to
find the house empty of anyone.&nbsp; Lately, I've seen my grandmother's
face from the corners of my eyes in the mirrors around the house.&nbsp;
It makes me sad to see her that way.&nbsp; The day of and before my graduation
party she appeared to my mother in the living room and on our back deck.&nbsp;
She lived with us before she died.</B>
<BR><B>There are just so many things I could tell you.&nbsp; I could type
for hours and hours and still I would leave a story unfinished or left
out.&nbsp; My uncle refuses to talk about, so I have another lifetime of
stories to hear.&nbsp; My cousins have experiences often, my aunts children.&nbsp;
My uncle's kids do not, and they are in no way emotionally close to the
rest of the family.&nbsp; They live about a mile down the street but I
see them maybe once a year.&nbsp; My aunt's children are like brother and
sister to me.</B>
<BR><B>Well, if you can tell me anything I'd greatly appreciate it.&nbsp;
I'm considering writing a book about my family one day, and I know that
any sort of analysis on the subject will be of great use</B>

<P><B>Perfume</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: eve@untool.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Last weekend I spent the night at my grandmother's house in Cape
Cod.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; This house is a historical one, listed and shown in several</B>
<BR><B>historical books about Cape Cod. It is called the Captain Freeman</B>
<BR><B>Perry house, after a sea captain who once used to live there. My</B>
<BR><B>grandparents told me the story of his daughter who supposedly drowned</B>
<BR><B>at sea when she was eight years old (from what I remember). The
story</B>
<BR><B>is that she used to haunt the house but was eventually driven away
by</B>
<BR><B>too much commotion in the house (by the living).</B>
<BR><B>Ever since I can remember, staying in that house never scared me.
I</B>
<BR><B>never felt any presence of spirit or any uncomfort in that house.
And</B>
<BR><B>this is saying a lot, considering I grew up having an unremarkable</B>
<BR><B>amount of nightmares in my own house. But in my grandmother's house
I</B>
<BR><B>always felt fine. My grandfather passed away almost three years
ago,</B>
<BR><B>now, and even then I still have not felt his presence in the house,</B>
<BR><B>although my grandmother says he visits her almost every night. I
have</B>
<BR><B>had only one dream about him that was very very real, and that was</B>
<BR><B>not in her house.</B>
<BR><B>Last weekend I had a very strange thing happen to me in that house.
I</B>
<BR><B>went to sleep early - at about 9:30 - because I hadn't had much
sleep</B>
<BR><B>the night before. In the middle of the night I was in a deep sleep,</B>
<BR><B>and I was dreaming that my mother and I were talking - it was a</B>
<BR><B>normal conversation, a normal dream, not a nightmare, I was not
at</B>
<BR><B>all frightened or even thinking about anything frightening in my</B>
<BR><B>dream. Suddenly, my mother interrupted herself in mid sentence and</B>
<BR><B>said "Do you smell perfume??" Instantly I awoke out of the dream
so</B>
<BR><B>sudenly it was as if someone burts into your room or screamed out</B>
<BR><B>your name or started shaking you violently. This was not the kind
of</B>
<BR><B>waking up you do when your alarm clock goes off, this was the kinc
of</B>
<BR><B>waking up you do when someone dumps a bucket of cold water on your</B>
<BR><B>head. But instead of it being the hot sweaty escape from a nightmare</B>
<BR><B>that I'm so used to, I awoke with three consecutive intense shakes
of</B>
<BR><B>my body, as if I had three quick body-shaking chills. I opened my</B>
<BR><B>eyes into the complete darkness of the room and took a deep breath</B>
<BR><B>because I was so shocked.</B>
<BR><B>I then smelled perfume as if someone had just sprayed it in my face.</B>
<BR><B>It was so intense it was unbelievable. I myself was not wearing</B>
<BR><B>perfume, the windows were slightly open, but had been all night,
and</B>
<BR><B>there was no wind or breeze, and it wasn't a flowery smell coming</B>
<BR><B>from outside... it was like real perfume, with that slightly</B>
<BR><B>artificial smell, not a natural oil or essence. I was so shocked
by</B>
<BR><B>it that I kept inhaling intensely to make sure I was fully awake
and</B>
<BR><B>not dreaming. (But who am I kidding - I was WIDE awake). After</B>
<BR><B>another breath the smell was gone - COMPLETELY. It didn't fade away</B>
<BR><B>as perfume would. It just disappeared all together. I was so scared</B>
<BR><B>at that point I lay there with my eyes shut tight and the covers</B>
<BR><B>around me and I didn't move. I sweat profusely until i must have</B>
<BR><B>fallen back asleep and didn't wake until the next morning.</B>
<BR><B>I do not know if it was a spirit, if it was a woman's spirit, or
if</B>
<BR><B>it was the child's spirit.. but those chills made me feel like she</B>
<BR><B>passed right through me. I have felt something similar once before</B>
<BR><B>while walking on a path through the woods in a totally separate
town,</B>
<BR><B>but that experience was actually pleasant and almost life-giving
or</B>
<BR><B>life-affirming. This experience was startling and unsettling. I
find</B>
<BR><B>it bizarre that after all these years of not feeling anything in
that</B>
<BR><B>house, I would have this experience. And out of all the experiences
I</B>
<BR><B>have had where I felt I was encountering a spirit that hadn't quite</B>
<BR><B>passed on, I have never SMELLED anything.</B>
<BR><B>If anyone has had a similar experience, please email me at eve@untool.net.</B>
<BR><B>Sweet dreams!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Paranormal Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: FIRE299 [FIRE299@msn.com]</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>In 1985 while in the third trimester of pregnancy with my daughter,
my husband and I were living in a duplex in New Port Richey Fla. My son
was one year old. We had been living there several months, when very strange
things began happening. Mild at first, then becoming worse. First I want
to say that I had absolutly no knowledge or interest in the occult. These
occurances began many months after we had lived there. I was washing dishes
and had an odor of hairspray. It smelled like an older brand of spray that
you would have smelled on your grandmother. I sensed a warm female presence
and did not feel at all threatened. Soon afterward, things became bad.
During the day I was in the living room with my infant son, when a hanging
glass light in the kitchen suddenly shattered. It was not swinging and
had no cracks in it. At night, things became very bad. My son would not
sleep, crying and pointing at things that I could not see. There was a
cold spot near the bathroom that was measurable. I want to say that the
month was aug. in Fla. and our A/C was broken at the time. The area was
approx. 12" by 12" completely square, coming from the roof at a diagonal
angle across the door of the bathroom and going into the floor. I heard
a voice during the day calling my name. That occured once. Strong sulfer
smells were present that everyone could smell. I had detailed nightmares
of demonic rituals. These were very very bad and highly upsetting. I had
a local church perform a ritual and every thing stopped. Thank God!</B>

<P><B>Orange Glow</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:carla@mcdonaldwiesegroup.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My family moved into a ranch like house when I was about 9 years
old.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>loved that house though strange things happened while we lived there.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>remember being in my room playing one night, when I had this awful
urge to</B>
<BR><B>look out the window (I have never felt this before or since).&nbsp;
I remember</B>
<BR><B>opening the blinds to see a orange ball of light right above my
window about</B>
<BR><B>50 feet or so.&nbsp; I remember trying to rationalize what it was,
even though I</B>
<BR><B>was only 10.&nbsp; The ball of light was very bright, very large
and just sat</B>
<BR><B>there.&nbsp; After what seem like a long time but must have been
only seconds, I</B>
<BR><B>ran to get my dad and brought him to the window to show him.&nbsp;
Of course it</B>
<BR><B>was gone.&nbsp; Has anyone ever seen anything like this before and
if so, what do</B>
<BR><B>you think it might have been.&nbsp; One day coming home from school,
I was about</B>
<BR><B>to go into the house when I heard our piano playing.&nbsp; There
was no one at</B>
<BR><B>home as my parents were at work.&nbsp; I was so scared I went and
got some kids</B>
<BR><B>from the neighborhood to listen and they heard the same thing.&nbsp;
My parents</B>
<BR><B>were very practical people but it wasnt too long I would hear them
tell</B>
<BR><B>friends about the ghost in our home.&nbsp; Things would disappear
and there would</B>

<BR><B>Many years later I married and my husband and I owned some rental

<BR><B>When I was at one of our rental units by myself, doing the cleaning,
the</B>

don't smoke.&nbsp; It</B>
<BR><B>would go off for a few minuites, then stop. This would happen on

<BR><B>brief periods over the years when I would clean the unit between
renters.</B>
<BR><B>It never happened if my husband was with me.</B>
<BR><B>Also, my husband's brother passed away very suddenly.&nbsp; He owned
his own</B>
<BR><B>phone company and did a lot of business with the funeral home that
he was</B>
<BR><B>sent to when he died.&nbsp; The day his body was brought to the
funeral home,</B>
<BR><B>their phones kept ringing but no one was there when they answered
the phone.</B>
<BR><B>They told us they knew this was his brother calling as he was a
great</B>

<BR><B>OLD RANCH HOUSE</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well this old house in our ranch is about fifty years old.&nbsp;
Our hired help calm they saw a woman walking in our front yard and just
disappearing.&nbsp; Then one day my music box started playing all by it's
self then quitting when I would look at it.&nbsp; Then my mom and I woke
up to a man&nbsp; whistling and then I went back to sleep then my mom was
half asleep when she woke up to a man whispering something to her.&nbsp;
Then two times I have seen a shadow of a man walking down the stairs then
vanishing.&nbsp; We seem to think the man haunting the house was the first
owner of the ranch and he was killed in a train wreck.&nbsp; For some reason
ghost are very attracted to me and I do not mind them one bit.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Ghost Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ErikaSHD@webtv.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Though I have never physically SEEN a ghost, all my
life I have</B>
<BR><B>heard them, felt them and even smelled them.&nbsp; They do not show</B>
<BR><B>themselves to me for some reason.&nbsp; Since I was young, everywhere
I have</B>
<BR><B>lived there has been a presence there that I have felt.&nbsp; They
have NEVER</B>
<BR><B>tried to hurt me, but scare the pants off me they will. My first
house</B>
<BR><B>that I lived in, everynight I heard the shuffling of feet pacing
across</B>
<BR><B>my door over and over through most of the night almost every night.&nbsp;
It</B>
<BR><B>seemed like my family did not believe me when I told them about
it.</B>
<BR><B>(They thought I was a little girl with an over reactive</B>
<BR><B>imagination...atleast thats what they told me).&nbsp; I would have
little</B>
<BR><B>sleep overs and other children would hear it too and be frightened.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>would also hear voices call my name when no one was around.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I moved away, things got a little more obvious
and a little more</B>
<BR><B>frequent.&nbsp; It happened to all my family this time, not just
me.&nbsp; I would</B>
<BR><B>have strange dreams about being sucked into my closet and finding
myself</B>
<BR><B>in a&nbsp; a torchlit corridor with a wooden door at the end of
it.&nbsp; Inside</B>
<BR><B>the room behind the door there was a woman siting there.&nbsp; She
would tell</B>
<BR><B>me to be careful of the restless spirits here, that she would try
to</B>
<BR><B>help protect me.&nbsp; This where my dream usually ends.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Me and my mother have had the&nbsp; things happen to us exactly
a week</B>
<BR><B>apart.&nbsp; I was sleeping one night and something awoke me (I
dont recall</B>
<BR><B>what).&nbsp; I do remember feeling something in my room, but I blamed
it on</B>
<BR><B>still being half asleep so I tried to go back to sleep again.&nbsp;
But all</B>
<BR><B>of the sudden I felt something grab ahold of my feet and give me
the</B>
<BR><B>slightest pull.&nbsp; I kicked my feet a little and the feeling
was gone.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>told my spirit that I had JUST about enough of that and it needed
to</B>
<BR><B>leave me alone while I was sleeping.&nbsp; I slowly got up, calmly
opened my</B>
<BR><B>door and closed it, the ran like the devil to mommy and daddy's
room and</B>
<BR><B>jumped in bed with them!&nbsp; After blubbering and whining about
not wanting</B>
<BR><B>to go back to bed, My mother told me a week ago, while she was sleeping,</B>
<BR><B>something tried to pull HER out of bed.&nbsp; I was my dad who saw
this and</B>
<BR><B>tried to wake her up.&nbsp; (He thought she was going to sleepwalk)&nbsp;
When she</B>
<BR><B>awoke and computed what was going on, she freaked out.&nbsp; She
could not</B>
<BR><B>put her arms down or get away.&nbsp; It was my dad who finally moved
them</B>
<BR><B>down.&nbsp; We still have strange happenings, but I believe you
are sick of</B>
<BR><B>reading this by now.&nbsp; Thank you for listening.</B>

<BR><B>My Cousin</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>When my cousin was 2 she had to go to the hospital to get stitches
in her</B>
<BR><B>finger, ever since then she has been scared of doctors. Well, my
aunt had to</B>
<BR><B>go on a business trip and left the kids with their father. Before
she left my</B>
<BR><B>cousin (she was 4 now) went up to her and told her she had a really
bad tummy</B>
<BR><B>ache. My aunt told her that maybe they should go to the doctor and
she threw</B>
<BR><B>a fit. So my aunt left on her business trip as planned thinking
it was just a</B>
<BR><B>tummy ache. The next day my little cousin was worse and she was
really afraid</B>
<BR><B>of having to go to the doctor so she tried her best to hide it,
but my uncle</B>
<BR><B>knew that something was wrong and asked her if she wanted to go
to the</B>
<BR><B>hospital and she threw another fit.&nbsp; That night my cousin woke
up in the</B>
<BR><B>middle of the night and felt even worse her face was as white as
a ghost, she</B>
<BR><B>crawled like a baby into my uncles room and told him that she needed
to go to</B>
<BR><B>the hospital (he then knew how serious it was because of her HUGE
fear of</B>
<BR><B>hospitals!) He rushed her to the emergency room and the doctor told
him that</B>
<BR><B>she had a ruptured appendix. They did emergency surgery and she
recovered. My</B>
<BR><B>aunt rushed back home and when she got there the doctors told them
that if my</B>
<BR><B>uncle would have waited 5 more minutes she wouldn't have survived
and it was</B>
<BR><B>a miracle. When my Aunt went to see my cousin she asked her how
she knew that</B>
<BR><B>she needed to go to the hospital and my little cousin said it was
because the</B>
<BR><B>angel told her that she needed to go to the hospital and to not
be scared</B>
<BR><B>because it would be all right. My aunt was in tears and every time
she tells</B>
<BR><B>the story we all get chills up our spine.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My 1st Ghost Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier this month my mom, brother,
and I were</B>
<BR><B>housesitting for a friend of the family. This required</B>
<BR><B>us to go early in the morning to feed their dogs and</B>
<BR><B>let them outside. We also had to come back late at</B>
<BR><B>night to let them in(they slept inside). Well this</B>
<BR><B>happened a few times... My mom would turn off all the</B>
<BR><B>lights before we left every night. In the morning when</B>
<BR><B>we would walk in the kitchen light would be on. During</B>
<BR><B>the day we would turn the AC of only to find out later</B>
<BR><B>that it was turned back on, and I swear none of us</B>
<BR><B>touched it. Something else happened when my mom was</B>
<BR><B>sitting at the kitchen table. All three dogs were</B>
<BR><B>outside and as my mom sat in the chair she could feel</B>
<BR><B>something licking her leg. The most frightening</B>
<BR><B>happened to me. I kept feeling a strange presence so</B>
<BR><B>my mother took the digital camera we had with us and</B>
<BR><B>took my picture. Next to me you could see a face. It</B>
<BR><B>wasn't a double exposure of course because it was a</B>
<BR><B>digital camera. We didn't us the flash either, so</B>
<BR><B>there was no explanation.I'll send the picture to the</B>
<BR><B>website later so you can all see.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When our friends returned we told them what had</B>
<BR><B>happened. The man said that he tried to convince his</B>

<BR><B>Larry and Daddy</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jsimmons@kettering.edu</B><B></B>

<P><B>In November of 2001, I moved from Colorado to Michigan to be closer
to</B>
<BR><B>family. I had lived in Columbus, Ohio for 15 years prior to living
in</B>
<BR><B>Colorado for a year. While living in Columbus, I dated a man by
the name</B>
<BR><B>of Larry on and off for 3 years. After moving to Colorado, Larry
was hit</B>
<BR><B>by a car and suffered severe injuries. His chances for survival
were</B>
<BR><B>very slim. He survived, but had many surgeries before he would be
able</B>
<BR><B>to function almost fully.</B>
<BR><B>I made a trip to Columbus at the end of November 2001. I went to
meet my</B>
<BR><B>friends and just so happened to run into Larry. I hadn't spoken
to Larry</B>
<BR><B>for quite some time, but we did email each other while I was living
in</B>
<BR><B>Colorado but not on a regular basis. So many feelings came rushing
back.</B>
<BR><B>I really did love this guy. We chatted for a quite a while and then</B>
<BR><B>exchanged email addresses. We wrote each other everyday and chatted
on</B>
<BR><B>the phone about once a week.</B>
<BR><B>I visited him at Christmas time. For the first time, he told me
he had</B>
<BR><B>loved me for many years. We had such a wonderful time together during
my</B>
<BR><B>visit.&nbsp; He was scheduled for his last surgery at the end of
January at a</B>
<BR><B>hospital about 4 hours from me. We had discussed me visiting him
while</B>
<BR><B>he was in the hospital. Unfortunately, a pretty severe snow storm
blew</B>
<BR><B>in the day before and more was on its way. I couldn't make the drive
to</B>
<BR><B>visit Larry, I would have only been able to stay one day and I would</B>
<BR><B>have preferred going to Columbus and staying with him for a couple
of</B>
<BR><B>days after being released from the hospital then for an hour or
two. We</B>
<BR><B>had also discussed me bringing Larry to my house for a week so he
could</B>
<BR><B>recover. His mother lived in NY and couldn't take anymore time off
of</B>
<BR><B>work because of his past surgeries and the time she had already
taken</B>
<BR><B>off. He decided to recover at his home.</B>
<BR><B>A couple of days after being released from the hospital, Larry and
I had</B>
<BR><B>a pretty heated argument about me not coming to see him. He was
really</B>
<BR><B>upset and angry with me that I didn't make the drive. I was hurt
because</B>
<BR><B>he didn't understand I couldn't make it because of the weather and
for</B>
<BR><B>the fact that I would have rather visited him at home for a couple
of</B>
<BR><B>days rather then an hour or two while in the hospital. That was
around</B>
<BR><B>February 4th. That was the last time I spoke to him.</B>
<BR><B>On February 10th, I received a phone call from one of Larry's friends</B>
<BR><B>whom I had never met before or heard of. She told me that Larry
had</B>
<BR><B>collapsed in a store and as he was being life-flighted to the hospital</B>
<BR><B>where he had what was supposed to be his last surgery, he suffered
a</B>
<BR><B>fatal heart attack enroute. His mother had told the gal that he
was with</B>
<BR><B>at the time of his collapse that she needed to contact me. Neither
one</B>
<BR><B>knew my number, I had never spoken to either one. My number was
found in</B>
<BR><B>his wallet. Larry had told me at Christmas that I reminded him a
lot of</B>
<BR><B>his mother. I met her at his funeral, she is truly one awesome lady.</B>
<BR><B>I made arrangements to attend his funeral in NY (where he was from</B>
<BR><B>originally). I hadn't grieved for him yet because I wasn't ready
to</B>
<BR><B>admit to myself how much I truly loved him. I also didn't want my</B>
<BR><B>daughter to see me in that kind of shape. I truly loved Larry. I
know we</B>
<BR><B>would have gotten through our tiff, we always had in the past.</B>
<BR><B>Unfortunately, I totally lost it at the funeral home. I grieved
for</B>
<BR><B>Larry the rest of the day and night and the next day. The day of
his</B>
<BR><B>funeral also happened to be Valentine's Day. I stopped at the drugstore</B>
<BR><B>and bought him a Valentine's Day card to put in his casket. One
night</B>
<BR><B>when Larry and I were out, we pretended to be strangers. He took
the</B>
<BR><B>name of 'Frank' (which was his middle name). I was the last person
to</B>
<BR><B>say a final goodbye to Larry before they closed the casket. I told
him I</B>
<BR><B>loved him and then said, "G'nght Frank". I felt his presence smiling.
I</B>
<BR><B>drove home the afternoon of his funeral, thinking of all the good
(and</B>
<BR><B>bad times) we had over the years. I truly believe he was with me
on that</B>
<BR><B>9 hour drive. That was a Friday.</B>
<BR><B>Larry's mother asked me to ride in the limosine with the family.
While</B>
<BR><B>on our way to the cemetary, Joni mentioned that Larry had given
a friend</B>
<BR><B>of his a book right before his surgery. I think the title was, "Talking</B>
<BR><B>to the Other Side". When she said that, we all agreed that Larry
knew he</B>
<BR><B>wasn't going to be with us much longer. Deep down he knew. I don't
know</B>
<BR><B>why we had our biggest fight ever a few days before his death, I
want to</B>
<BR><B>think he wanted me to be so mad at him that it wouldn't hurt so
much</B>
<BR><B>when he went to the other side. Maybe it was because he wanted to
see me</B>
<BR><B>one last time. I may never know.</B>
<BR><B>I continued to think of Larry all weekend and into the next week
and</B>
<BR><B>wished that we had resolved our fight. I felt a lot of guilt thinking
if</B>
<BR><B>only I had done this or that. I could only thank God that He had
given</B>
<BR><B>me his last couple of months on earth. Tuesday night, I had just
settled</B>
<BR><B>into bed. Almost immediately, I heard noises. I lied there quietly,</B>
<BR><B>listening intently. I thought ok, the cat is playing with something.
The</B>
<BR><B>more I lied there, the more I knew it wasn't the cat. I heard no
other</B>
<BR><B>noise other then a bounce, bounce, bounce. Surely if the cat was
playing</B>
<BR><B>with something, other noises would be heard. Our cat isn't one to
play</B>
<BR><B>at night, he is usually upstairs with my daughter and I. It sounded
like</B>
<BR><B>a superball. As time went on, the bouncing seemed to move to different</B>
<BR><B>areas of my townhouse including the unit next door which had been
vacant</B>
<BR><B>for several months. I live on an end unit. After 15 minutes of hearing</B>
<BR><B>this bounce, bounce, bounce, I smiled and told Larry to knock it
off.</B>
<BR><B>The bouncing continued for about another 5 minutes then stopped.
A</B>
<BR><B>wonderful sense of peace washed over me and I knew everything would
be</B>
<BR><B>okay. He was out of his pain and suffering and was ready to live
another</B>
<BR><B>life. When I got up the next morning, I went to the bathroom and
on the</B>
<BR><B>floor was a small superball.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning while getting ready for work, the cat did his normal</B>
<BR><B>routine of jumping on my bed for some good ole' belly rubbing. I
would</B>
<BR><B>always stop what I was doing and give him attention. All of a sudden,</B>
<BR><B>his head jerked up and he started staring at my bedroom door. He</B>
<BR><B>continued for about 20 seconds. I sat trying to figure out what
was</B>
<BR><B>going on. I finally said outloud, "Stop it Larry". The cat then
seemed</B>
<BR><B>to follow a movement across my bedroom. Our cat has acted weird
ever</B>
<BR><B>since that time, he would stop what he was doing and stare into
space.</B>
<BR><B>He also seems to be play with nothing but thin air, something I
had</B>
<BR><B>never noticed him doing before. My daughter would get spooked and
all I</B>
<BR><B>could tell her was someone is with us and that it is a good spirit</B>
<BR><B>watching over us.</B>
<BR><B>I have believed in ghosts since I was about 7 or 8 when I woke up
one</B>
<BR><B>night to see a figure whom I believed to be my grandmother (whom
I had</B>
<BR><B>never met) standing next to my bed. I have never (to my knowledge)
had</B>
<BR><B>another 'encounter' until Larry's passing.</B>
<BR><B>When I got home from work that night, I told my daughter (who was
10 at</B>
<BR><B>the time) that Larry had visited. She immediately told me that my
mom</B>
<BR><B>had visited her one night a few weeks prior. She was sleeping on
the</B>
<BR><B>floor with her friends and said she awoke to see "an old lady" looking</B>
<BR><B>down on her. My mother passed in 1995 and had never met my daughter.
I</B>
<BR><B>asked her how she knew it was my mom and she said, "she just knew."
My</B>
<BR><B>daughter and I had never discussed ghosts, spirits, or the afterlife.
A</B>
<BR><B>couple of weeks later, she called me at work upset because she had
woken</B>
<BR><B>up to hear a woman crying. I think my mother has been trying to
make</B>
<BR><B>contact with me but I'm not ready to visit with her.</B>
<BR><B>I think of Larry everyday and sense his presence on occasion. I
have</B>
<BR><B>very fond memories of Larry. I also feel my father's presence and
laugh</B>
<BR><B>when I think of how Larry and my father would get along so splendidly.
I</B>
<BR><B>can just imagine them standing side by side giggling at me. I love
you</B>
<BR><B>Larry and daddy.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: DUHBUBBIE@cs.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>hello my name is Deborah. and i had a spirit that was with me for
years. i</B>
<BR><B>know that it is a man. i believe it is my father or my brother.
i'm not sure</B>
<BR><B>though. one afternoon me and my son he was nine years old then.
we were</B>
<BR><B>sitting in the living room just talking to each other and i had
alot of</B>
<BR><B>plants. but i had one plant hanging from the ceiling,and this one
plant</B>
<BR><B>started swaying like slow motion. but we notice this plant moving
and there</B>
<BR><B>were no windows opened. then we just sat there not believing what
we were</B>
<BR><B>seeing, then this spirit started plucking the stems off this plant
and</B>
<BR><B>started throwing the stems at my son. i jumped up and i just started
saying</B>
<BR><B>the blood of jesus. i was so scared. my son was the bravest. so
later that</B>
<BR><B>night my neigbor's son came upstairs and said miss.Deborah there
is a man</B>
<BR><B>sitting on your toilet,i got so scared i told the little boy to
leave. so the</B>
<BR><B>little boy came back upstairs the next night and said again miss.
Deborah now</B>
<BR><B>the man is in your kitchen and he is waving at me. so i came out
my bedroom</B>
<BR><B>to see if i saw anything,but i didn't. i talk to people about tis
and they</B>
<BR><B>say i'm crazy and they laugh. but i'm not crazy and no where neat
being</B>
<BR><B>crazy. so i told my neighbor that lives down the street from me,and
she gave</B>
<BR><B>me some holy water and some blessed oil. and she told me before
i enter the</B>
<BR><B>house to put the sign of the cross on the front door,and as i go
up the</B>
<BR><B>stairs to say the blood of jesus and i did that. then she said to
take the</B>
<BR><B>oil and make the sign of the cross on my son's forehead and to do
the same</B>
<BR><B>with myself. and i did that. then she said to throw the holy water
on the</B>
<BR><B>plant. and i did that but i didn't see noting happen. so then she
called me</B>
<BR><B>and told me i had to rebuke it out. she said i had to read the bible
but i</B>
<BR><B>forgot the verse, and she said ad i read this bible to open a window
so it</B>
<BR><B>could leave.i did that. i prayed so hard that i though i was actually
a</B>
<BR><B>minister myself there for a moment ( smile) so as i kept prayinn
and opend</B>
<BR><B>the window we then saw my curtain fly back like a gus of air hit
it. so then</B>
<BR><B>me and my son was sitting on the couch againand we heard this cry
at the</B>
<BR><B>window and i lived on the second floor. i went to the window and
i was</B>
<BR><B>actually talking to this spirit. and the more i talked to it the
louder this</B>
<BR><B>spirit crieded. and i mean everywhere i go this spirit follows me.
no it</B>
<BR><B>never tried to harm me or my family. but it is scary. i do believe
it is my</B>
<BR><B>father or my brother. i'm not sure. as i speak to you i heard the
walking in</B>
<BR><B>my living room. i was sleep one night and it felt someone looking
over me so</B>
<BR><B>when i opened up my eyes there was a man standing in my room door
way leaning</B>
<BR><B>against the wall. and i just said well you finally showed yourself
to me and</B>
<BR><B>then i rolled over and went to sleep. but i feel it is my brother
or my</B>

<BR><B>Haunting in Two Hundred Year old Colonial</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: saberhaygen@comcast.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, My name is Sarah and I am 22 years old. I grew up in a gorgeous
white stone colonial&nbsp; (circa 1783)in the suburbs of Philly. There
was a secret room in the basement of the house that dated to the Civil
war era and was used to hide slaves on their way to freedom in Canada.
This room was part of the underground railroad, so the house has a lot
of history. I remember as a child laying in bed at night and hearing the
sound of a marble rolling over the hard wood floors, up and down, back
and forth, rolling all over the floor for hours on end. Someone told me
this means there was a child's ghost in the room. Also, my sister and I
both remember seeing a glowing apparition of a man appear and disappear
before us one summer night as we played out in the yard. My sister is now
married to a Baptist preacher and doesn't believe in ghosts but we both
remember this glowing man just materializing in front of our eyes. The
house definitely has some supernatural activity there, though it is not
"haunted" like you would think some old homes are. In conclusion, if anyone
reads this and can answer my question about the sound of a marble rolling
on the floor, i'd appreciate it. Thanks.</B>

<BR><B>Haunted Wheelhouse</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: PEngire@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>When I was in college in the 1970's at Buffalo State College in Buffalo,
NY,</B>
<BR><B>my friend and I would go to the Historical Museum between classes.&nbsp;
One day</B>
<BR><B>we went into the downstairs area and in a small alcove they had
recreated a</B>
<BR><B>wheelhouse of a ship from the 1800's.&nbsp; The back of the alcove
contained</B>
<BR><B>display cases of pottery and the front was the wheelhouse of the
ship and the</B>
<BR><B>panorama you saw through the window of the 'wheelhouse' was a storm
on Lake</B>
<BR><B>Erie.&nbsp; We walked into the alcove and cursorily looked at the
pottery and then</B>
<BR><B>turned to the wheelhouse in the front.&nbsp; Both of us stood there
for a few</B>
<BR><B>moments and then simultaneously said to one another, "this is creepy!".&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>hairs on both our necks and arms were standing on end and all we
could think</B>
<BR><B>was to get out of there.&nbsp; While we never saw anything, the
feeling of intense</B>
<BR><B>cold and fear was overwhelming .&nbsp; Thinking we were just crazy
we went back</B>
<BR><B>about a month later and the same overwhelming feeling was still
present and</B>
<BR><B>all we wanted to do was leave. I went back to the museum almost
20 years</B>
<BR><B>later and believe it or not the same display was still there and
I went to</B>
<BR><B>see it and had exactly the same reaction.&nbsp; I don't know what
had happened to</B>
<BR><B>the objects in that 'wheelhouse' when they were actually part of
a ral ship</B>
<BR><B>but it must have been pretty devastrating to leave such a strong
impression</B>

<P><B>Haunted House London England</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: chloe_d2@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>What I am about to write happened nearly ten years ago. I used to
live in a small flat with my family, the flat was once part of two Victorian
houses, the houses in the street were joined together and made into two
and one-bedroom flats.</B>
<BR><B>We used to live on the third floor (The top of the three-storey
building) in a two-bedroomed flat. I used to share a bedroom with my two
sisters and my parents used to share a room.</B>
<BR><B>I lived there from the moment I was born until I was ten years old.
As I was growing up, strange things used to happen, although to me they
were entirely normal. I'll start with the first thing that I remember,
I used to want to play in my bedroom with my toys alone but had a terrible
fear about being alone in a room, I didnt understand why I had this fear
but, if I sat alone for a few minutes a terrible, panicky fear would come
over me and I would just have to run out of the room.</B>
<BR><B>Sometimes when I walked down the hall I would see the back of someone
walking into a room through the corner of my eye, this was a regular occurance.
I used to think it was my mind playing tricks on me but the person was
a child. Also we would hear pots and pans crashing around in the kitchen
cupboards, footsteps up and down the hall and so on.</B>
<BR><B>When I was nine I saw a lady watching me through the corner of my
eye, I was sitting on my parents bed and looked to see who it was. As I
looked she quickly moved back from the door frame and I thought it was
my mother, I quickly walked into the hall but nobody was there and my mother
was right up the other end of the hall, talking on the phone in the livingroom
with the door closed. There is no way that she could have got there so
quickly without me seeing her and nobody else was in the house.</B>
<BR><B>After we moved to a new, bigger house I started to remember more
of the things that happened to me at the house. I remembered hearing voices
at night, my two sisters say that they heard voices too, and one also says
that she saw a black figure in the livingroom when she was about seven
years old.</B>
<BR><B>It seems strange that we remember more now than we did at the time
all these things happened. But my mother told me that my sister used to
say strange things to her when she was little, like she had spoken to or
seen someone. My mother also said that many times she came into our bedroom
at night to find my sister sleeping on the floor, wedged down beside the
wardrobe. When she asked her why she was there she used to say that our
dad picked her up out of bed and put her there. Obviously he didn't because
he would have no reason to do this.</B>
<BR><B>My mother used to live in a haunted house as a child too and many
people in her family have had experiences with ghosts. We think that some
kind of link has passed down through our family, because even now we still
see strange things just not as much as we did as children.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Haunted House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: EdnTerryZ@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>We lived in a rental home in Mt. Airy(we called it Mt. Scarey), Maryland
for one year.</B>
<BR><B>No one in our family(2 parents, 3 children) really believes in ghosts
or the supernatural and we are not easily "swayed or influenced" by ghostly
events.&nbsp; I am a true skeptic, and although have never seen a "ghost"
myself, I do believe that 2 of my children had an encounter with something
"supernatural."</B>
<BR><B>We moved into this rental home for a one-yr lease, as we ultimately
either wanted to buy or build a true home in Maryland.&nbsp; The house
was a very nice split-level, kept in immaculate condition, on a 1-acre
wooded lot.</B>
<BR><B>The first strange "event" happened immediately.&nbsp; We have a
Siamese housecat, who never goes outside(she is fixed and declawed) who
decided right away she did not want to live in that house.&nbsp; She jumped
out the window on the 2nd day there and was promptly lost for 2 weeks in
the woods.&nbsp; It was very upsetting for the children and me, and we
didn't sleep easy until we finally coaxed her out of the woods and back
into the house.&nbsp; I never slept peacefully the whole year.&nbsp; It
was always cold, and I was always awakened by strange noises in the rooms.&nbsp;
It would sound like people having a loud party and playing loud music and
the TV on full blast.&nbsp; My daughter had a friend sleepover who knew
nothing of the house and they slept downstairs in the basement and the
next morning she asked me what all the "commotion was upstairs last night."&nbsp;
I would be awoken out of a deep sleep by sounds of someone walking down
the hall, or the TV being on, or just wake up because I was freezing</B>
<BR><B>"who's there?!" and the figure slowly disappeared.&nbsp; My daughter
says she saw a "figure walk by her bedroom door" and it appeared "white
and very tall, like a ghost."</B>
<BR><B>The children are not excitable or impressionable and do not make
up stories.&nbsp; Though skeptical of their tales I had no reason NOT to
believe them.&nbsp; My son only told me of his event months after it happened,
because he knows how much I scoff at the idea of ghosts.&nbsp; My last
experience was very strange- I was downstairs in the basement on the computer
and heard my husband come home upstairs, opening the door and said a greeting,
either "hey, I'm home," or "hey".&nbsp; I acknowledged him and continued
to work on the computer for 10 mins or so, maybe less, and when I went
upstairs no one was there.&nbsp; He had never come home.&nbsp; I was surprised.</B>
<BR><B>We moved out of the house a year later, and all of us were so relieved
and glad to leave.&nbsp; It was just too "creepy."&nbsp; The owners put
the house up for sale so we never</B>
<BR><B>actually met them-- all I had heard was that it was an older couple
with no kids and</B>
<BR><B>they were no longer interested in living in that house.&nbsp; The
ironic thing was that the</B>
<BR><B>woman that owned the home was a preacher, which really doesn't mean
anything, only that the influence of religion really plays no part in hauntings,
or lack thereof.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>did sprinkle holy water throughout the whole house after my son
told me of his "Grim</B>
<BR><B>Reaper" experience.</B>
<BR><B>So who knows- it was our experience with something "supernatural"
and to this day it still provides us with some lively conversation and
amusement at the dinner table.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: twila@kymail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was always raised in church with the belief that when one passes
they go to their final resting place in Heaven or Hell. That's why I have
to tell this story.</B>
<BR><B>Last October my grandma died of cancer. She was so concerned about
her son with Downs Syndrome and his care. She seems to still be with him.
At night he goes to play his Play Station and he talks to her like she's
playing too. He asks her if he can play five more minutes and so on.</B>
<BR><B>But one day my grandpa , his dad ,was searching for the window screens
with no luck. All the while my uncle was in his room. He went to his dad
and said" mommy told me to look in the closet" sure enough they were there.
I still don't know if I believe in Ghost , but I do question.</B>

<P><B>Ghosts of Gettysburg</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Amaleen2@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I live in Iowa; however, my husband is from Pennsylvania, and we
lived there for a year, as well as visited several times.&nbsp; In early
July one year (around the 4th, and thus around the anniversary of the Battle
of Gettysburg), my mom accompanied us to the battlefield.&nbsp; We would
drive a little, stop and look at monuments and walk around, then drive
some more--it's a big place.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, we were walking back to the car from one of the monuments,
and I saw this big grove of trees.&nbsp; There was a sidewalk that went
along it, with a historical marker of some sort several yards down.&nbsp;
I'd never seen it before, despite having been to the battlefield two or
three other times, so I wanted to read it.&nbsp; Greg and Mom weren't interested,
so they waited at the beginning of the path for me while I walked down
it.&nbsp; As I walked, I felt like I was being watched by several people
from the grove of trees, and these people just emanated this horrible sense
of resignation and despair.&nbsp; The hair on the back of my neck was long
since standing up by the time I reached the marker.&nbsp; It basically
read that the grove of trees was where Pickett's men waited to do their
ill-fated charge, the one that saw 10,000 men drop from Yankee cannonfire
and bullets within fifteen minutes.</B>
<BR><B>It was a longer walk back up that sidewalk, and when I got to Mom
and Greg, they asked, "Well, what did it say?"&nbsp; I replied, "Let's
just drive."&nbsp; We got in the car and drove on, and I told them what
I'd experienced.&nbsp; They didn't really comment, but they didn't act
like I was full of crap or anything.&nbsp; Later, I bought one of the Ghosts
of Gettysburg books, and it talked about all the weird experiences people
have had with that grove of trees, known as the Point of Woods.&nbsp; I
kind of felt vindicated reading that, because I'd begun to think maybe
I imagined the whole thing, even though I'd grown up in a haunted house--which
is another story.</B>

<P><B>Something Out There</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Kat2634@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>April, 1985.&nbsp; I have alot of things that are different.&nbsp;
We are no longer renters...my mom and my stepdad (dad from here on, my
bio donor is chas) have purchased our home.&nbsp; At age 17, I am the youngest
of 4 children 23, 22, 21 and 17.&nbsp; Only C. (brother aged 21) and I
live at home.&nbsp; C. is never here--he is busy with friends and girls.&nbsp;
Lately, he has begun calling the girl he left behind in PA.&nbsp; She is
six months older and 1 year ahead of me in school.&nbsp; (Just trying to
give some background).</B>
<BR><B>The first event occurred before we moved in.&nbsp; We were only
moving one street over.&nbsp; I went over several nights to clean the house
thoroughly before moving day.&nbsp; C was supposed to there, but never
was.&nbsp; The first few nights were fine, until I began scrubbing down
the kitchen wallpaper.&nbsp; The words 'run to daddy you better run to
daddy' came to my head.&nbsp; Suddenly, I remembered the apartment and
its thuds.&nbsp; I locked up and ran home.&nbsp; When I arrived, I said
nothing.&nbsp; I babbled about a test in school the next day and went to
bed.</B>
<BR><B>I guess I spend so much time on the mundane because I am trying
to make a point....there is something out there.&nbsp; It enters our lives--sometimes
subtly, other times unanimously.</B>
<BR><B>Good night.....</B><B></B>

<P><B>Experiences With Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MsIrene0209@cs.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I have not seen many ghosts but those I have seen I saw as full
bodys, not misty things.</B>
<BR><B>I come from a psychic family and have been psychic as long as I
can remember. I am a parapsychologist and a spiritual science minister.&nbsp;
I'd just like to tell you of one of my experiences.</B>
<BR><B>A few years ago, I received a call from a friend who told me an
old friend we hadn't seen in years had passed on.&nbsp; I wished I could
have seen him before his passing and heard myself say, "I wish I could
see him."&nbsp; I had meant to say. ( but didn't correct myself ), "I wish
I could have seen him"</B>
<BR><B>Later that night, I was in bed reading and heard footsteps entering
my room.&nbsp; I looked up and saw a man who looked like my old friend,
but who was terribly thin and drawn looking, and assumed my friend, having
died of kidney failure would have been all swollen up.so this could not
have been him.&nbsp; For a moment I was afraid he was a burgler, but then
he disappeared. I wondered who that might have been.</B>
<BR><B>I learned later that our old friend had also had cancer and was
thin and drawn when he passed on.&nbsp; I believe my wish to see him had
been granted.</B>

<BR><B>Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: anonymous</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I just happened to almost automatically type in 'haunting' on my
search engine tonight.&nbsp; I don't know why; I generally don't talk about
these things to anyone except family and even with them, I hesitate to.&nbsp;
I've made so many complaints over the past twenty-one years that I am sure
my parents think me psychotic.&nbsp; I know my siblings do.</B>
<BR><B>My first brush with something 'not quite right' and inexplicable
came when I was just 6 or 7 years old.&nbsp; It was summer, getting to
be toward dark.&nbsp; I knew I had to get home, but did not want to leave
my friends and go in for the night.&nbsp; I went racing up hill behind
my friends for another round of 'King of the Mountain' when someone called
my name from far away.&nbsp; The first time, I kept running.&nbsp; The
second time, I stopped and yelled that I was coming...</B>
<BR><B>My mom commended me for having come home before dark without any
prodding or hunting.&nbsp; I asked her and my 3 siblings but NO ONE had
called me.&nbsp; All my friends were with me.&nbsp; I asked my mom several
times if she was sure that she hadn't.&nbsp; I remember being very positive
that it was the voice of a grown woman.</B>
<BR><B>At this same home, I began to have nightmares.&nbsp; The strangest
one concerned what I later called 'The Black Cat on Christmas Eve'.&nbsp;
When we had to draw a dream in art class, I received a very strange look
from the teacher.</B>
<BR><B>Life was calm until the summer I was 13.&nbsp; My parents had divorced
years before.&nbsp; One brother was on break from college, but worked 3
jobs and was only home when sleeping in the mornings or late night.&nbsp;
My other brother was spending the summer with relatives in the MidWest.&nbsp;
My sister had moved to the MidWest to start college.&nbsp; My mother had
rented an apartment.&nbsp; For the first time I was an only child and responsible
for myself while my mother worked.&nbsp; It was a new town where I did
not know people, but made friends at the summer art program near my home.</B>
<BR><B>I noticed the sounds the first week we were in the house (mid-June).&nbsp;
It sounded like two successive bangs followed a moment later by two louder
successive bangs.&nbsp; It always happened in the afternoons; around 4-5
pm.&nbsp; Just before my mom came home from work.&nbsp; She thought it
was pigeons up in the closed off attic.&nbsp; I was an imaginative child,
but not hysterical.&nbsp; At my insistence that something was up there,
she spoke to the landlords.&nbsp; She returned with their verdict:&nbsp;
pigeons and other birds.</B>
<BR><B>Shortly after July 4th, maybe a week or so later, I was up late
reading.&nbsp; It was about midnight and I heard someone walking slowing
up the steps to our apartment.&nbsp; I assumed that it was my oldest brother
returning home from work.&nbsp; There was no air conditioning in the apartment,
so the windows were open.&nbsp; However, due to my teenage modesty, I kept
the blind closed that overlooked the front stoop where the stairs were.</B>
<BR><B>After awhile, I wondered why my brother had not turned on the TV.&nbsp;
Then I realized that while I had heard someone come up the stairs, I hadn't
heard anyone unlock the front door, less than 15 feet away from me with
an open window separating us.&nbsp; Worse, I hadn't heard anyone go back
down either.&nbsp; I grabbed a baseball bat that I had set in the corner
by my room and walked to the front door.&nbsp; I looked out the peephole
and no one was there.&nbsp; The door was locked.&nbsp; My brother reported
the next morning that a step had been removed and set at the end of the
steps.</B>
<BR><B>I continued to report the 4 thuds.&nbsp; I heard them everyday.&nbsp;
Eventually my mom refused to listen.&nbsp; One day I was half asleep and
the first thuds sounded.&nbsp; My half asleep mind thought 'there go the
guns' and 'the bodies fall next'.&nbsp; The second thought jerked me awake.&nbsp;
I ran out of the apartment.</B>
<BR><B>Finally, it happened at the right time.&nbsp; My oldest brother
had an unusual happening that night--a date.&nbsp; As he got ready, the
thuds began.&nbsp; He sliced himself with the razor and came racing out
of the bathroom wanting to know what had fallen..&nbsp; I gloated as only
a little sister could 'I told you something wasn't right'.&nbsp; He stayed
home that night and quit one of his jobs shortly afterwards.</B>
<BR><B>Late summer came and my oldest brother returned to school.&nbsp;
My other brother returned to complete his senior year of high school.&nbsp;
The thuds resounded several times after he arrived, but each time sounded
frailer.&nbsp; By the time school began after Labor Day, they were gone.&nbsp;
I think my brother just filled the place with so much life, that nothing
but life could compete.</B>
<BR><B>And so life continued quietly.&nbsp; And no...I am not insane and
not much of joker.&nbsp; I am not a kid with nothing better to do.&nbsp;
I was trained as a scientist, trained to notice details, trained to seek
rational explanations.&nbsp; However, the inexplicable events of my life
continued.</B>
<BR><B>At age 17, we moved into the very house I now sit in.&nbsp; My mother
had remarried and we left the North to travel 800 miles to one of the most
enchanting cities of the South.&nbsp; Augusta GA.&nbsp; From age 15-17,
we rented a home until my parents purchased the one we are in now.&nbsp;
It was exciting.&nbsp; No more landlords with stupid rules.&nbsp; A yard
that we garden in, plant trees in, keep dogs in.&nbsp; The American Dream
come true...</B>
<BR><B>And I've just realized something.&nbsp; We've had this house for
17 years.&nbsp; We lived here for 7 years, rented it out for 5 years and
have lived back in it for another 5.&nbsp; And even though little has happened
since we moved back (mostly the dog staring at something I can't see) I
am still scared when I think about the summer of my senior of college.&nbsp;
I am still scared of the quiet of the house late in the night. And I don't
want to write it down.&nbsp; Or what happened in the apartment I lived
in before moving back.&nbsp; I don't know what made me type that word into
the search engine or why I felt compelled to start this e-mail.&nbsp; Suddenly,
in 15 or twenty minutes I have become afraid of shadows again.&nbsp; I
thought I had grown past that.&nbsp; Tonight, I will sleep with the lights
on if I sleep at all.</B>
<BR><B>For whatever Doubting Thomas reads this be assured of one thing...science
does not yet have answers for everything.&nbsp; Some things are beyond
explanation.&nbsp; I think some people are lucky...they laugh at the thought
of unseen things frightening people.&nbsp; To them it is a joke.&nbsp;
Investigating these things is hard, especially when it is in your own home
and no one believes what is happening to you; not even others that live
in the home.&nbsp; Some people just cannot accept and thier minds rationalize
what has happened away.&nbsp; The rationalities of science are seldom a
line of defense in a haunting.&nbsp; It is a spiritual attack that science
cannot explain.</B>

<P><B>Aunt and Uncles Home</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mbaker3@rochester.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These happenings have happened at my aunt and
uncles house. Their ceilings are very high and the entertainment center
that they have is pretty tall. On top of the entertainment center was a
statue of Mary. Well one day while my uncle was home alone and watching
t.v., the Mary statue was lifted up and carried over to the middle of the
room by an invisible figure. He was terrified and couldn't get his legs
or arms to move. All of a sudden the statue was released and smashed on
the living room floor. I am pretty sure that this invisible figure was
evil. Why else would this figure choose the Mary and not one of the other
statues or pictures in the room.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another time my uncle was away on a business
trip and my aunt was home with my 2 cousins. My aunt was getting pretty
tired and decided to go to sleep. she was on her side-her back torwards
the door. She heard the door open and close and foot steps lead to her
bed. It couldn't have been my 2 cousins because the footsteps were much
too heavy. Anyway she felt her side of the bed go up like beds do when
a heavier figure gets in bed with you. The figure put one arm around my
aunt. She could feel a man breathing down her neck. My aunt didn't want
to call her kids incase it was a rapist, murderer or burgler. Luckily my
aunt was wearing her cross at the time and she held the cross tightly and
prayed as hard as she ever had before. The figure all of a sudden let go
of her and disappeared. She only felt the bed go down~like some1 got off
the bed. She never heard the door open or close or any foot steps.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; She hasn't told us any later happenings but many things
have happened in that house and the one across from her was VERY VERY VERY
haunted.</B><B></B>

<P><B>A Story for You</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bulletwithbutterflywings16@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; I guess I should start out saying I've never thought of myself
being 'psychic' (as you said may be the reason for "Ghosts that Follow"),
but I've noticed some oddities in every home I've been in.&nbsp; My mother
has also said she's seen or heard some strange things, but never to any
extent that I have.&nbsp; We've both been known, though, to be seriously
sensitive to climate and pressure changes, and both know when it is likely
to rain, or snow, or be a sunny day.&nbsp; We also have both complained
about problems in the last houses we've been in.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; My father claims he used to live in a haunted house, where
he said he felt "evil" things around him, like demons.&nbsp; I've always
believed in ghosts, and the afterlife, yet I've never really believed all
the stories people have made.&nbsp; But after doing some reading online
about stories that are (supposidly) real, I've noticed some similarities
between those incidents and my own.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; When I was a baby, my parents say they used to see me lying
in my crib, laughing at a ordinary ceiling light.&nbsp; The way they say
I was laughing was peculiar, and I've always wondered why.&nbsp; As far
as I can remember I've always had some unusual feeling around me.&nbsp;
I've never had too many friends growing up...not because I was ugly, or
a loser, or a teacher's pet, but most people thought I was wierd, and looked
at the world differently.&nbsp; Instead of playing with Barbies, I used
to play by myself in&nbsp; my room, and at night I would stare outside
for hours just looking at the moon and stars.&nbsp; Most of my friends
were at home, and not at school.&nbsp; Maybe this is why I've always felt
something was "there".</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I hadn't really thought about it until I viewed you're site,
then I realized I've gone through all this before, and wondered why.&nbsp;
I loved the house I was in at age 5, and still do (it's been, so far, my
favourite place to live), but my room was something quite different.&nbsp;
I was never scared in that room, in fact I was quite comfortable, except
I remember seeing, on many different occassions, different "people".&nbsp;
I call them people because I'm not sure what or who they were.&nbsp; One
I remember vividly was, one night when I had a horrible dream, I awoke
and called my mother.&nbsp; She came in, and of course recognizing her
as my mother, I dismissed the strange feeling I had.&nbsp; I told her about
my dream, and she nodded in reasurrance after everything I had said, but
didn't say anything.&nbsp; After I had told her my dream, she simply vanished.&nbsp;
Now, I don't know how you would react to this, or if this would be scary
for you, but it terrifyed me beyond reasoning.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; And since moving a few times, (all have had small happenings)
I now live in Brooklyn, NY, in a very old apartment building.&nbsp; I've
awoken to my bedroom door shaking violently, and the sound of someone jumping
on my bed.&nbsp; It scared me half to death, although now that I think
about it, it wasn't so scary.&nbsp; The fact was, I thought I was in an
earthquake and, for that moment, seriously thought I was going to die.&nbsp;
Both my mother and sister came to the door, and although the sound could
still be heard, they could see my door moving at all.&nbsp; When she opened
the door, it all stopped...it was very strange.&nbsp; I also see dark figures
walking from room to room in one certain area in the house...but it's not
so scary, though.&nbsp; I've heard voices, but not for a while.&nbsp; My
dad has also claimed he heard a little boy called out and crying.&nbsp;
And we often feel like we have no privacy in the bathroom.</B>

<P><B>two years ago my family and i moved into an old second floor apartment.
it was a very cold april day. as soon as we moved in my brother 9 and my
sister 8 decided to make the right side of our attic out playroom, the
left side being for storage... as you can see in the picture aka. map plan.
it was a great place to play untill my mom threw a movin in party... late
in the night while the adults were in the kitchen talking my cousin shawna
an myself snuck up into the attack to play with my ouijja bored it wasnt
wood or anything but we were bored an thought it be great to have a little
harmless&nbsp; fun. at the time we both didnt believe anything would happen.
i knew a cool trick on how to make you hand appear on the bored [mine is
glow in the dark] by putting your hand on the bored while the only source
of light we had a small desk lamp shined on the&nbsp; bored i shut of the
light an the hand showed up. we were playing for a little while in the
light then we heard what was a crinkling sound like a plmy cousin said
she wanted to play monopoly but it was upstairs... she went first then
my brother then me then my sister went to the attic to go get it... we
didnt have a flashlight but my brother held a candle... the poor light
was very week... i ws about half way up an then kirstin screemed......
we all fled downstairs.... the kirstin an my brother desciribed what they
saw... a hand curling its fingers over the edge of the wall..... even tho
it was a tad bit dark they both saw it an i didnt dissagree......... my
mother said we all imagined it... but she wasnt there in the house at the
time. ive also felt ungodly eyes looking at me late at night when i was
up alone at like 12-1pm in my room an everyone was allasleep.... ive also
felt presences around various areas of the house. our apartment is so old
that old holes for stove pipes remain in the walls..... the walls of our
house is hollw... and ive been thinkin something is hidden between them
