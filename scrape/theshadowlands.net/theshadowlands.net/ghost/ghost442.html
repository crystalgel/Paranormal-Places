<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I lived in home
that to me was haunted. We know of a little boy that had burned to death
(playing with matches with other children) then he somehow made it to the
kitchen area of the house while being built and burned to death. His name was
"Toni". He liked to run up and down the stairs and hide things all
around the house and open/close the shower curtain (of course while you were in
there!). We would hear his laughter and smell smoke when he was around. He was
never mean but we always knew when he was in the room. There was also a tall
man who's presence was known too, we would hear a snickering mean laugh and
talking like angry words and the man tried to hurt a parent when he was in bed.
I remember laying in my own bed and my brother in his when we heard a yelling
and choking sounds. When we got to the doorway of the parents bedroom we heard
and saw our father gasping for air and struggling to get "something"
off of him. Then in an instant we all heard a loud bang at the base of the bed
and then a very cold breeze almost run by us then loud banging like stomping
down the stairs and a door slamming down to the basement. I remember coming
home from a camping trip one time and walking into the house where the cellar
door was blown out from the inside out and down in the gun shop there was a
little room within that room that was just an open space under the house that
was surrounded by rocks and dirt. There was a latch and very large lock on that
door and that too was blown out from the inside (but there was no way anyone
could have gotten in there<span style="">&nbsp; </span>because it
was a one way in one way out space. My parent called a priest in to bless the
house and the priest came but stopped short at the threshold and pointed into
the house on the right side and said that the gate was right there and he
WASN'T allowed in because the evil spirits would hurt him and he just simply
said<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"good day" and walked
away! I have been out of that house for 25 years now and still have dreams and
nightmares of that house. The house was sold in 1991 and any occupants that
have lived there,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as far as I have
learned, has not lived there any longer than 14 months at a time. There have
been several owners for that home and I am almost positive the house now sits
empty again. I would love to have that house checked out to find out the whole
history of all the strange things that have occurred there (as a child to
present time)</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I think that my apartment is haunted, because things
disappear mysteriously and I never see them again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its just my things that disappear not anyone
else. </font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">For instance, I was knitting and dropped a knitting
needle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I went to pick it up it was
gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have searched under the
furniture and all around and it has never turned up.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I have other miscelaneous things that go missing as
well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I live with just my husband who is
was a widower before he married me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
wife died suddenly here in the building.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I sometimes wonder if she wants me to give him up and go away.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In the late 70's my family lived in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Louisville</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Ky.</st1:State></st1:place>
My daughter was unable many nights to sleep in her room because something kept
pulling the covers off of her bed, we all witnessed several times a covering
that was in a stair well fall for no apparent reason. It would fall down a
small flight of stairs' make a turn into the kitchen area and come to a stop in
an upright position. There was also the presence of a medium size gray cat that
would travel down the stairs and just disappear.Once while we where all in Florida,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on vacation ,my neighbor comment that she
thought we were all going but saw one of the boys in the front bedroom looking
out the window. I assured her<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we had all
gone on the trip and no one else had a key. Nothing in the house was disturbed
during our absence.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">These things seem to follow me from house to house but have
not been harmful. There was one house that something was angry because we were
renovating the old house. We believe it was the original owner of the property
who had passed on but had to sell the property against his wishes. </font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I have had a difficult time writing this<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as the wrong letters kept appearing on my
computer.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I've been a member and fan of your site almost since the
beginning and, while I had one paranormal experience in 1973, have had nothing
happen to me even though several dearly loved family members and friends passed
over.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">That is until recently.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First to provide some background:</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">My 87 year old mother needed round the clock care the last
year of her life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in a position to
go to Florida and spent that year as primary caretaker of her, cooking,
cleaning, helping her get around, taking her to her dr. appointments, making
sure she took her meds, setting up her dialysis every day... even to changing
and feeding her when she became totally bedridden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My siblings decided they wanted Mama in
hospice so her care could be discontinued so she could pass so I was basically
sent home "for a vacation" so they could do that without my
interferance.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In that year I would take her to the dr, hospital, for
tests, the store... and she always sat in the back seat behind the
passenger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She liked my car and would
comment on how comfortable it was (she gave us our inheritance and one of the
things I bought was my Prius).</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Anyway, she died on Nov 3, 2007 just 9 days short of her
88th birthday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of problems with
my siblings and the fact Mama wasn't lucid at the end, I did not go back down
to see her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt the year I spent with
her taking care of her daily needs and wants was enough memories and I did want
my final memories to be of her dying without being aware of where she was or
who I was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also did not attend the
funeral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not need to go and the
unavoidable abuse from my siblings was more than enough reason to stay
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I mourned Mama in my own way
and have no regrets for those decisions.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Thanksgiving my son wanted to spend the holiday with me and
his sisters so I drove to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Columbus</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">GA</st1:State></st1:place> to get him and then took him
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On my way home after dropping him
off I was sitting in MAJOR traffic on I85.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was about 8:00 pm, dark and a bit rainy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked in the back seat and Mama was
sitting in the spot she always sat in when I took her somewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked away, then looked back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was just sitting there like she always
did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said "I'm just headed home,
Mama.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took KC back to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Columbus</st1:City></st1:place>"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I looked again she was gone.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I don't know why she visited me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can't say that I miss her nor do I have any
need to see her, we were not close althought she was my mother and I did love
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was closer to my Daddy, he was
the parent I adored and spent time with whenever I got a chance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Mama is the only one I've seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know she was terrified of dying and fought
it with every ounce of her being until she lost the battle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I often wonder just why she chose to
visit me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess I'll never know.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Anyway, I enjoy your site and the newsletter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to share my sighting with you since
the subject of loved ones coming back was this month's topic.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I relized when I was very young that I could see things no
one else could, when a freind of mine was killed during a tornado. We were
about five years old and after the storm he and his sister appeared in my
bedroom. Over the years I saw them very often and just thought that it was
because I saw the tornado carry them away. But later I discovered that was not
the case. When I was 12, my family moved into an apartment complex. We had a
two story apartment, that at first seemed normal. On night, I had a dream in
which I kept being told to look in the attic. The problem was the attics only
had openings in the even apartments, ours was an odd number. A short while
later, I started hearing footsteps, but no one was there. One night, I followed
the sound of footsteps down the stairs and in to the livingroom. There I found
a elderly lady rocking in a chair. Then she just walked away and disappeared. I
became use to her appearences and it never bothered me. A few years later, we
moved in with our grandmother and great grand mother. The was a nice srea of
woods behind their house were we liked to hike. My great grand mother use to
tell use stories of a hunter who went into those woods and never came out. As kids
we use to laugh it off as a myth. One summers day we went hiking with some of
our friends, Once we got into the woods I had this feeling like something was
following us. It was a scary feeling, not like any encounter I ever had. After
climbing a cliff, we were walking around when something rip my bracelet off my
wrist. At this point I convenced everyone it was time to go home. We got lost
one the new trail we discovered and came across a man, dressed in a white shirt
and what looked to be purple pants, who appeared to be building a fire. He
explained how to get out of the woods and walked us part of the way back to the
entrance. Then looked at me and said I have to go finish my hunting now. Upon
later dicussion, we discovered that he fit my great grand mothers discreption
of the man who never came out of the woods.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While this scaried everyone else I kind of knew he was just stranded.
For many years, I experienced many strange events, something would move items
and then put them back. Or appear before me while I was outside, I became use
to it. It had happened all my life, But in 1995, my husband and I moved in a
house, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">london</st1:City></st1:place>,
ky. This house seemed normal at first, but after a few months we began hearing
footsteps through the house. Then a shadow chased my sister up the stairs from
the basement. It seemed to just be because it was an old house, until one
morning, someone said hello to me. I was the only one awake. Every one said i
was hearing things. Until one night, we left town to visit family and left our
roommate home alone. As night fell, it began to storm, when the storm knocked
out the power, our roommate began hearing footsteps. Then she hear someone say
hello, and ask where I was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this
point she left. The next morning I called to check on her and someone<span style="">&nbsp; </span>or something picked up the phone and laid it
down. I could hear voices talking, but when we got there the house was empty.
The phone was laying in the floor off the hook, and our roommate arrived home
shortly after us. Her aunt told us she had been with her all night. A few
months later we moved out and never heard anything from the new residents about
hearing things. But the strange thing was a few years later my daughter started
talking to people who no one could see. Apparently it is a family thing.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I wanted to share my current experience. My beloved mother
passed away on Feb 1, she was 81 and had alzheimers and cancer. It was about a
week after her passing when she started to come around and visit me! I will go
to bed early to read and my boyfriend will be watching TV with the dog. One
night I heard him come into the room and plop heavily down on the bed. I looked
up and swear I saw a butt print on the bed, but nobody was there. I suspected
it was mom. She then started giggling and bouncing up and down on the bed in
affirmative. She comes by about once a week and does this. I know she is here
other times too. Recently she uncovered a crystal pendant I'd been missing for
about the past two years. I t really bothered me that I could not find it, and
one day all of a sudden I spy it lying on the carpet in plain sight, where it
had not been before. I was flabbergasted and started crying, and thanking her.
I swear the photo of her on the wall winked at me!</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I've had ghostly experiences and commune with spirits every
now and then , would love to share more sometime.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I've had many experiences with the paranormal in my
life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first time that I can recall
every having a ghostly encounter was when I was living with my Aunt and Uncle
in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Warrenton</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">NC</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was home alone and doing my homework at the kitchen table when my golden
retriever started to act a little funny.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He kept jumping in front of me and growling at the backdoor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a glass sliding door leading outside
to the deck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got up because I thought
that maybe he wanted to go outside but instead I saw the transparent head of
and Indian just moving across the deck.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We were living in a trailer about 5 feet off of the ground so I believe
it must have been walking on the ground beneath the trailer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I screamed and jumped onto one of those
free-standing freezers that we kept in the kitchen. After a second or two it dissappered.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">When my mom remarried, she moved my younger brother, my
younger sister, and I all the way to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Cape
  May</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">NJ</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's when things got wierd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were living in an apartment above a
hardware store while we waited for our stepfather to get us a bigger place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister, stepsister, and I stayed in the
same room while my brother took the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every night we could hear the sounds of a
person wearing heavy boots walking on the ceiling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What got us scared was that we were as high
as the building went and there wasn't even an attic above us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another time our parents were out and we were
all in the living room watching tv when we heard the sounds of someone running
from the front door to a computer chair in the corner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The chair spun around and it sounded like
someone jumped off of it and ran into the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The kitchen light turned off then everything
was quiet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We all kind of looked at each
other then ran into our room screaming.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We all slept on the same bed that night.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Things got worse when we moved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were in the same neighborhood, just a
bigger house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom began to experience
things in the new house as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
stepsister had a history of talking on the phone in the middle of the night and
one night my mom swore she heard the phone being dialed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She called for my stepsister to go to sleep
but she got no answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So she went to
our bedroom and saw the she was asleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When she went to find out where the dialing was coming from the phone
was thrown at her from the living room.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I would always hear my mom calling me and she'd say that she
wasn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes I'd think that I saw
my brother run into another room but he wouldn't even be there.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">When my baby brother was born it was if he could see things
that nobody else could.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes he
would follow things with his eyes and laugh until whtever it was went towards
the basement door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he'd cry as if
someone was hurting him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes we'd
see and hear people in my brother's room and then they'd look at us and
vanish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom wanted to move.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">So we moved and hour and a half away from that house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first thing that happened to me in that
house was after my baby sister was born (now there were 8 people in my
family).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was babysitting her one night
and was changing her diaper in our very cramped bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out of the corner of my eye I saw my brother
enter the bathroom and I could feel him standing behind me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I turned to tell him to get out nobody
was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought it was strange but
I didn't think too much of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
accidentally dropped the diaper onto the floor and when I bent down to pick it
up I saw my brother's feet and legs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
jumped back but nothing was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
grabbed the naked baby and ran out.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Then one day I stayed after school for a party with my
club.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was talking with my teacher then
I wandered off with my friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 5
minutes later she came to me and asked where I went.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She says that she asked me to go and get the
food from the back and that I had followed her in there but when she turned to
hand me the food I wouldn't take it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then when she turned around again I was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She didn't see me leave even though the door
out was right in front of her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought
it was probably a different girl because I had been with my friends the whole
time.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">After the party my friend had to use the bathroom so I went
with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she was done we both
stood and fixed ourselves in front of the mirrors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A girl walked in and went into the stall
behind me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were going to leave but I
had to spit my gum out to I pushed open the stall behind me and jumped back and
said sorry because the other girl was supposed to be in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She couldn't have left because she would have
had to go passed both me and my friend to leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend looked at me and I knew that I
wasn't going crazy.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I used to live in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> when I was a little
kid. I had what my mom thought was an imaginary friend, but I could see him/it
plain as day. I didn't know what to call it so I didn't ever talk to it, but we
would play in the woods and under the bridge down the road for years. I would
see it walking around the field and creek across the road and I would go join
it. As I got older I realized that he was no natural being. I can't describe
him even to my husband and family but I can never erase him from my mind. He
wasn't pleasant to look at though if you get my drift. He was a solid creature
and wore a cloak even in the hottest of weather. He was no see-thru spirit. He
was really my only friend. When I became a teenager, he became more and more
sinister and I began to be afraid him. He would lift me up out of bed and I
would be paralyzed. He never physically touched me, but somehow I would hover.
I got really scared. One night, I was in bed and I smelled him come in. (not a pleasant
smell either) He lifted me up, my bedroom window lifted up, and I began to
float past him feet first out the window. My room was on the second floor. My
mom had lined the flower bed beneath my window in rather large rocks and I just
knew he was going to drop me. He disappeared as my lower half went out and I
screamed and somehow broke free and twisted, grabbing the sill. I felt him
waiting below me so I pulled myself back in and ran into my mom's room and
slept with her up until I left for the Army at 17. She never asked me why. He
followed me to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Virginia</st1:place></st1:State>.
I would come home to my barracks room in the evening after work (no roommate)
and all the windows would be open. I got married awhile later and he followed
me there. He didn't seem as sinister anymore, just like he wanted to tell me
something. After I had my daughter, he started getting scarier. My grandmother,
Rosella, had died a couple years before I had my daughter and when he would get
too scary for me, I would smell her perfume and the smell of roses and
he/it<span style="">&nbsp; </span>would leave. My ex-husband was a
non-believer so I never told him but he did ask me if I smelled roses one time
she was there. (I am guessing it was her....who knows for sure?) I met my
current husband in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Kuwait</st1:place></st1:country-region>
when I was deployed. He/it followed me but ever since the very moment that I
laid eyes on my current husband, I haven't seen, smelled, or felt him one
single time. </font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know this sounds
crazy. I finally told my husband about it all and he was very supportive and is
just happy that he/it isn't around any more. I hope you don't think I am nuts,
but it felt good to tell someone else. What on Earth do you think was happening
to me?</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I just wanted to let you know that this one blew me away!
Last year my husband and i were driving down route 4 right in front of panther
creek. all the sudden this black animal runs across the highway. it was almost
shadow like. we both were freaking out because we knew it wasn't a deer, dog,
fox, cat, etc. this shadow/animal was the size of a leopard or panther. we just
couldn't understand what we just saw. the entire time we were trying to think
of what animal just darted across the street.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>this was in broad daylight too. but the animal just wasn't clear enough
to make any sense. and now after reading this it gives us chills just thinking
about it!! i called my husband in to tell him what i just read and he remembers
that day like it happend<span style="">&nbsp; </span>yesterday. both
him and i are believers in spirits and hauntings an things like that, and have
always interested us. :) this story has put a smile on my face. i know now that
what we both saw had to be what others have reported. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would like to
tell you some of my personal experiences with the paranomal. when I was about
ten years of age we were living in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Trinity
  Springs</st1:City>,<st1:State w:st="on">Indiana</st1:State></st1:place>. I
lived with three other sisters and our mother. Will, our mother decided to go
for a walk to a friends house that was about five miles give or take a few
miles. To kids it seemed to be a long ways from home. On the way we had to past
this cemetary. It always gave us the creeps to walk near and we would run past
it. To keep the creepy feelings down, mother would always get mad at us for
doing it. When we arrived home the door was standing wide open. Mother told us
to stay outside just in case someone was in the house. We did as we were told
and I watched from the door way in case the police needed to be called. After
about ten to fifteen minutes we all went in, ate supper and went to bed. </font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was about
midnight, when something pulled down on the edge of the bed. I thought it was
our dog wanting up under the covers with us. I stuck my foot down there to help
her up. When I did an hand grabbed my left foot. I pulled my foot back quick
before I knew it my foot began burning like it was on fire. And the hand rushed
up my sisters' leg searching for my foot.And of course I screamed . Mother came
running into the room wandering what was wrong. I told her ,all she said was:
You just had a bad dream go back to sleep. She went back to bed. I jumped from
our bed all the way into the hallway, I was not willing to put my foot on the
floor next to the bed. When I returned to the bedroom, I looked under the bed
to see what was under there and seen nothing there. Soon as mother was a sleep
we jumped up and grabbed something to try and protect ourselves some how. Soon
as we went to sleep this person would grab,hit or pinched us. When daylight
broke it quit and we got a little sleep before mother would wake us up for
breakfast. When we walked into the kitchen our mother ask us how Diana got the
bruse on her arm. We told her and she blamed us for fighting.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My sisters and I
told our neighbor about the experience. She told us about a home that stood in
the same place that had burn down with three children inside while their
perants had went to town to a bar. The eldest child tried to keep the fire
going because the house was getting cold. When she was putting wood into the
wood stove a piece of coal had fallen onto the floor. She hid under the bed.
She though that her perants would get mad at her for what she had done. All the
children had past away in the fire.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here is one more:
When my grandmother was still around she lived in a house that was haunted by
grandfather(husban). He had past away in 1959 when my mother was five years of
age.From black lung because he was a coal miner. At night you could hear him
walk down to the basement and back up the stairs. If he seen that you had no
covers on, he would cover you up to keep you warm and safe.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">My friend, his girlfriend, and myself were all sitting
around watching a scary movie one night in his apartment. After the movie, we
discussed supernatural things we had experienced before. Both my friend and his
girlfriend said that even if the ghost of a family member appeared to them and
meant no harm, they would still be horrified at the sight. I, on the other
hand, had said that I wouldn't be, seeing that I have had experiences as a
child and that I wasn't afraid of them(as to whether or not they were ghosts of
past family member is not known to me, I was too young to remember details). I
stayed the night at his apartment a few nights later. While I was laying on the
couch, my friend came out from the bathroom, walked through the hallway (which
is mostly visible from where I slept on the couch), and into his room. After he
shut his door, it was almost completely dark. As I rolled over and faced the
hallway, I saw a faint white figure of a woman from the middle of her torso on
up. Her hair was short and black and she had broad shoulders. As to whether or
not she was infact a she isn't for sure, I just got the distince feeling that
what I saw was female. It stayed floating in the hallway facing me for a few
minutes before fading. Now honestly, I was slightly freaked out, but I didn't
feel threatened. I rolled over and tried to go to sleep. A period of time that
seemed like a few hours passed and I had finally gotten into that half
conscious state of sleep. Slowly I started to develop a strange feeling on my
right shoulder and back (I was facing the back of the couch with my back to the
hallway). I heard a calm woman's voice say "How are you feeling?",
and I responded immediately, "I am very tired, please let me sleep."
The movement of my mouth jolted me from my sleep, and the feeling on my
shoulder and back had disappeared. </font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The next day I told my friend about what I experienced. He
burst into tears as I finished the story. To my surprise, that night was the
anniversary of his mother's death. After discussing it with my friends, I
wondered if it was infact his mother, why would she appear and speak to me and
not him? They suggested that the fact that I was not afraid of the paranormal
and that I had admitted it a few nights previous was why she came to me. </font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">That was about a month ago. Since then strange sounds and
odd visions are seen in his apartment occasionally. The slight sound of egg
shakers or moracas are heard moving around the living room. I've heard it pass
right over my head before and circle around in the kitchen.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">This is the site of the Old Santa Cruz Hotel. This is an old
house now converted into a restaurant/lounge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had an experience there back in August 2007.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to use the women's restroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went into the first stall and noticed that
the toilet paper cover was opened, so I went to the next stall and noticed the
same thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I went back to the first
stall, I closed the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard
footsteps as if someone had entered the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The footsteps got louder and it almost seemed
as if someone was pacing back and forth in front of my stall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked under the door and realized there
was no one else in the restroom other than myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being the logical person I am, I thought
maybe it was someone walking upstairs, not even realizing there was no
upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upstairs would be the
roof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was ready to open the door to
my stall I could almost feel a presence, as if someone was standing right in
front of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't see anyone but I
felt someone there. Very close!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I left
and went back to join my part for a dinner and never said anything about
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The waitress who was very chatty
started talking about the restaurant and the history behind it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was an old brothel house in the
1800's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then revealed that there was
a ghost there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said it was a ghost
of a young prostitute who was very unhappy and decided to hang herself in the
backroom which was now the womens restroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I almost fell out of my chair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
couldn't even believe it!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The waitress
claims that it's a friendly ghost and that she likes to mess around with
people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also claims that the ghost
constantly opens the toilet paper covers and they are always having to close
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, why the covers were open
when I went to the stalls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I quickly
told the waitress and the rest of my party what I had experienced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The waitress believed me but the rest of my
party thought I was nuts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If people want
to go there and experience it themselves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They should go in alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
won't show herself to groups.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I have always had weird experiences in my life that many
people have never had or do not believe. The scariest one occured when I was 12
years old.It was the spring of 1986. We lived in an old neighborhood in some
cottage type houses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day I was home
alone shortly after school doing my homework when suddenly I heard a man
breathing very loud and deep. It sounded like he was struggling for air. I was
in my room and the restroom was across the hallway from room and that's where
the sound was coming from. I immediately turned off the square electrical fan
that I had on thinking maybe it was malfunctioning. As soon as I turned it off,
the heavy breathing got louder. There were no open windows so it wasn't coming
from the outside. I became very scared because I knew that I was the only one
at home and there was certainly someone breathing very loud right outside my
room. I ran out of that house as fast as I could and waited outside until my
parents got home from work. My brothers and sister were due to arrive as well.
When my mom returned, I told her what I heard and she totally believed me. She
said that when we rented the house they were told that a man was stabbed to
death in that house. Could it have been his echo of his last moments ?</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Hello Me and 5 of my friends entered them caves about 2
weeks prior to the 2 deaths in 1992, I heard allot of stories about the caves
prior to going there and just had to see them for myself not knowing truly what
i was getting myself into or what i was up against! Well the cave we entered
was huge and seemed to go on forever until we came across another cave that was
about 6 foot or so off the ground to enter into it, From what my friends told
me it was rumored<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to be the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cave<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>called<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stairway to Heaven"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>well<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>none of my<span style="">&nbsp; </span>friends would enter
it, they would not enter this cave they all refused saying it was haunted and
that no one will go into it for that reason. Well I didn't care or heed their
warning about entering that cave and had 2 of my friends help me get up into
the entrance of it, It was a very weird cave it wasn't very wide maybe 6-8 foot
wide by 8-9 foot tall and the weird part is the cave looked like a stairway or
sorts but more like a human ribcage all the way up i went all the way to the
top which led to a landing at the top, When i got on to the landing there was
an altar with weird symbols carved into the walls and altar and there was also
another entrance to a smaller cave next to the altar which was only maybe 5-6
foot wide by maybe 4-5 foot high at most i had to crawl thew this one it ended
at a dead end that was basically street level which was about 1,000-1400 foot
above where we entered the caves!</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">so i u turned and went back to the landing that led back
down the spiraling snake like cave, it was very scary up there i felt like
something was watching me and as i was sitting on the edge about to jump down
to the stairway so i could get back down to my friends that were waiting on me.
Well as i sat there all of a sudden something pushed me hard from behind and it
wasn't possible for anyone to be behind me, there was no other way in or out
but the way i took and it was to small for anyone to get past me, so in short i
know i was pushed by a spirit or whatever that wanted me out of there and it
tried to basically kill me being the cave i climbed was very high up and i slid
all the way down the stairway and was pushed again out of the cave onto the
main cave floor where my friend were. So at that point i was scared and wanted
out and told my friends what happened and they didn't believe me till they
looked at my back and there was 2 perfect sandy hand prints showing something
pushed me hard. I had bruises on my back for about 2-3 weeks after that, but we
all ran out of there as fast as we could after they seen the hand prints and
then all of a sudden we started hearing talking and weird sounds that couldn't
be normal, so we left and never went back again... 2 weeks later we heard on
the news that the 2 kids died in the caves that we were in the exact same
cave!! They were found in the area were i was attacked by whatever was in
there. well thats my experience of the caves in st.paul mn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wouldn't suggest anyone ever going into
them caves ever not after what happened to me and all them poor kids that lost
there lives in them caves!! Them Caves are highly haunted by something and its
definetly not friendly!</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I have seen some unusual things in my dad's house. I have
been haunted over the past three years. </font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">It started one night while i was lying in bed, unable to
sleep. I heard footsteps in the basement. That happened for a while, but then
it got worse. The footsteps began approaching the stairs. eventually, they
reached the top of the staircase. since then, i have almost always slept with
the light on. The light didn't keep the ghost(s) away for long. One night, I
heard someone running up the stairs, and running into my room. I felt/heard a
hand hit my bed before it retreated back to the basement. </font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">That was the first year of the haunting.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I don't remember what order the following events happened
in, but I'll try.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I spent the summer at my grandma's house, away from the fear
of my dad's house.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">When the school year began, and I entered middle school, the
fear returned. I had several sightings that year. They included:</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">-the outline of a face in the mirror</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">-a frequent "visitor" in the corner</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">-a little boy crying</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">-an angry, elderly woman in the mirror. (i turned around and
so nobody, nothing to misinterpret. I looked back at the mirror and she was
still there, but transparent.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">That was the end of year 2.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Now I'm in the third year of the haunting, which hasnt had
as many events. </font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I still hear frequent footsteps, and occasionally see an
orb, but one big event has happened this year. I woke up in the middle of the
night, and looked toward the doorway. An old man (Japanese, I think) entered
the room. He had a long white beard and a trenchcoat. He was staring at me,
moving closer. He was actually floating, no leg movement, about an inch above
the floor. I just watched as he came toward me, disappearing when he was about
a foot away. I did not sleep again that night.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">That's about it; most of what's happened to me so far. These
stories are completely true, I'm not making any of this up.</font></p>

for eleven years. It is a Log home built somtime in the 1860's. We had numerous
experiences, such as a older man talking to my toddler in her bedroom. Loud
knocks on the front door in the middle of a snowy night, with no one there and
no foot prints in the snow. Heavy foot steps could be heard down stairs, when
we were laying in<span style="">&nbsp; </span>our bed on the
upstairs landing. A<span style="">&nbsp; </span>back door was
totally jammed shut, and the only thing my husband thought he could do was cut
it open. But on a windless night it just flew open, and there was a strange
odor. We had a neighbor across the street tell he heard the piano playing when
we were gone. I heard my name called often. We had people house set because we
only heated with wood, they heard noises, saw curtains move, and wouldn't stay
there again. We saw a figure in my daughter's bedroom window when we've pulled
in the driveway. I had a sunburn on my back in the shape of the barn, now there
were no trees or possible shadows, and we even showed a friend, and at the time
it didn't make any sence, but then our neighbor came and said he saw the barn
swaying in the wind, at closer inspection the main supports in the barn were
almost completely rotted away. Was this someones way of tell us something was
wrong. There are<span style="">&nbsp; </span>more stories but these
are some of the best.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">After checking out your website, I decided to email you.
First let me say I was never known as one who really believed in the unknown or
the supernatural realm. I am a true believer in Heaven and Hell. As christians
we are brought up to believe that when a person dies their soul immediately is
rushed into heaven or hell. It doesn't linger in between, but now I know that
doesnt always happen when a person passes on. </font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Around 10 pm on April 2, 2005 while housesetting for my aunt
at my grandmothers home in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Grand
  Rapids</st1:City> <st1:State w:st="on">Michigan</st1:State></st1:place>, I
went into my grandma's bedroom to get ready for bed, when I got such a rush of
anger inside of me that lasted only for a second and then he was standing there
next to the bed. I dont remember his face but I remember he wore a reddish
checker shirt with what looked like a long john shirt underneath. He stood next
to the bed, still and unmoving. I couldnt move, I just sat there starring at
him. Within minutes extreme fear welled up inside of me and I found myself on
the edge of sane and insane. I was so affarid that it took all my strenght to
get up and walk out into the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
knew I had to go back home where I was safe, but that didnt happen because when
I got home the fear was worse than ever, I couldnt even stay at home at night,
I had to stay at my son's. I though this man followed me home.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">It was almost a week later when I finally got up the nerve
to look for help . I contact so many ministers and priest and not one who help
me. I couldnt figure out how these people could stand up and preach the gospel
day in and out and then turn away from someone like me. I recieved emails
telling me to get off the drugs and that I need medical help., I still have the
emails . Then I contacted a minister in Hersey <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Michigan</st1:place></st1:State> and he believed in me enough that
he came and blessed me and my home. I felt like a big boulder was lifted off my
shoulder and I could stay at home alone at night, but even to this day
sometimes I still get scared and have to leave all the lights on.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">About a month after this happened I took a roll of film in
and when I got the pic's back, I couldnt believe my eyes. I had taken a picture
of my grandma's house and what was in the windows put that fear right back
inside of me.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Sometimes we never find an answer while on this earth, but I
do know one thing. Seeing that man demonstrates how thin the veil is that
separates our physical realm from the supernational realm.</font></p>
