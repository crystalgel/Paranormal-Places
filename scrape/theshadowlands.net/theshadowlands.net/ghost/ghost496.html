Douglas AZ Gadsden Hotel Update<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bajito64@hotmail.com<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; HELLO, I WOULD LIKE TO START OFF BY SAYING I ENJOY YOUR
WEBSITE VERY MUCH AND FIND THE PARANORMAL VERY INTERESTING. I AM FROM
DOUGLAS, ARIZONA AND HAVE EXPERIENCED COUNTLESS PARANORMAL ACTIVITIES
FOR MANY YEARS. I NOTICED ON THE HAUNTED PLACES SECTION ON DOUGLAS,
ARIZONA COVERING THE GADSDEN HOTEL HAD A LITTLE INFORMATION REGARDING
THE HAUNTINGS OVER THERE. THE ACCOUNTS MADE BY THE BARTENDER WORKING
THERE IS A BIT FALSE. I HAVE WORKED SECURITY THERE FOR ABOUT 3YRS AND I
WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT THE GADSDEN HOTEL IS INDEED HAUNTED. THE
PRANKSTER INDIAN BOY GHOST AND THE ELDERLY WOMAN (UNSURE IF THE NAME
SARA IS ACTUALLY HER NAME) ARE TRUE STORIES. THE HEADLESS PANCHO VILLA
I AM NOT TO SURE IF THAT IS A TRUE STORY OR NOT SINCE THERE HAS BEEN
ALOT OF TALK ABOUT HIM. I HAVE SEEN MANY GHOSTS AT THE HOTEL TO THE
POINT WHERE IT DOESN'T EVEN GET TO ME ANYMORE. I MYSELF HAVE NEVER SEEN
THE ELDERLY WOMAN ON THE 4TH FLOOR BUT THERE IS DEFINITELY A PRESENSE
ON THAT FLOOR, I HAVE MY SUSPICION AS TO WHO THE ELDERLY WOMAN IS BUT I
WOULD RATHER NOT MENTION HER NAME. I HAVE SEEN COUNTLESS SHADOWS AND
ORBS THROUHOUT THE ENTIRE HOTEL, MAINLY IN THE LOBBY AREA. THERE ARE
COLD SPOTS IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE HOTEL AS WELL. THERE IS A GHOST
THAT HAS BEEN NAMED JONATHAN BY OTHER EMPLOYEES OF THE HOTEL. I HAVE
SEEN HIM ONLY ONCE AND HE APPEARS TO BE A OLD WESTERN TYPE COWBOY WITH
THE LONG TRENCH COTE, HANDLE BAR MUSTACHE, AND THE TYPICAL WESTERN
ATTIRE OF THE OLD DAYS. HE DOES CLOSELY RESEMBLE DOC HALLIDAY. ONE
SECURITY OFFICER THAT WORKED THERE WAS ONLY ON HIS FIRST DAY WHEN HE
OBSERVED "JONATHAN" IN ONE OF THE EMPTY OFFICES IN THE LOBBY AREA WHEN
HE DECIDED TO RESIGN DUE TO BEING FRIGHTENED BY THE GHOST OF JONATHAN.
ANOTHER GHOST OF THE HOTEL WOULD BE A PROSTITUTE THAT APPARENTLY LIVES
INSIDE THE WALLS OF THE HOTEL THAT IS RARELY SEEN. ANOTHER GHOST THAT
IS WELL KNOWN TO EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS REGULAR CUSTOMERS OF THE HOTEL IS
THE HANGING LADY THAT IS IN THE WOMENS RESTROOM ON THE LOBBY FLOOR. THE
STORY OF THE WOMEN IS THAT BACK IN THE 30S OR 40S, (NOT REALLY SURE OF
THE EXACT TIME FRAME) IS THAT SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH A NAVY PERSON. THE
MAN IN THE NAVY APPARENTLY TOLD THE WOMAN THAT HE WAS LEAVING HER AND
THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE HER AGAIN. BEING VERY HEARTBROKEN OVER THE
BREAKUP, SHE WALKED FROM THE OLD TRAIN STATION (NOW THE DOUGLAS POLICE
DEPT.) TO THE GADSDEN HOTEL AND ASKED THE FRONT DESK CLERK WHERE THE
WOMENS BATHROOM WAS LOCATED. AS SOON AS SHE ENTERED THE RESTROOM, SHE
HUNG HERSELF WHERE THE ARCH IS LOCATED INSIDE THE RESTROOM. THERE ARE
POLICE REPORTS AND PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE SCENE IN THE FILES AT THE POLICE
DEPT. ONE SECURITY OFFICER THAT IS PRESENTLY <br>
EMPLOYEED AT THE HOTEL HAS SEEN THE PICTURES OF THE CRIME SCENE
INCLUDING THE PHOTOS OF THE WOMAN STILL HANGING FROM THE ARCH. THIS
FEMALE GHOST STILL TO THIS DAY HAS BEEN SEEN BY EMPLOYEES AND BAR
PATRONS. SHE WILL ONLY APPEAR TO INTOXICATED AND DEPRESSED WOMEN AND TO
SOME EMPLOYEES OF THE HOTEL AND THEY ALL DESCRIBE HER THE SAME EXACT
WAY. SHE HANGS THERE ON THE ARCH, STARES AT YOU, AND ASKS "ARE YOU
OKAY". SHE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS A YOUNG FEMALE, APPROXIMATELY IN HER
EARLY TO MID TWEINTIES, OLD STYLE DRESS POSSIBLY A VICTORIAN TYPE BUT
NOT SURE, VERY PALE AND ON SOME ACCOUNTS, BLOOD COMING OUT FROM HER
MOUTH AND EYES. THE HAUNTINGS OF THE HOTEL HAVE APPEARED ON T.V. SHOWS
SUCH AS SIGHTINGS AND UNSOLVED MYSTERIES AND EVEN THE NEWS. MANY GHOST
HUNTERS AND PARANORMAL INVESTIGATORS HAVE VISITED THE HOTEL AND HAVE
DOCUMENTED NUMEROUS GHOSTS SUCH AS EVPS AND PHOTOGRAPHS. ROOM 333 HAS
BEEN CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST HAUNTED ROOMS OF THE HOTEL. THERE HAVE
BEEN A COUPLE OF DEATHS IN THAT ROOM ALONE. ONE WAS OF AN ELDERLY MAN
WHO DIED OF NATURAL CAUSES AND THE SECOND WAS OF A MALE THAT DIED OF
ALCOHOL POISONING. THERE IS A POSSIBLITY THAT THOSE TWO ARE HAUNTING
THE ROOM BUT THAN AGAIN MANY GHOSTS ARE HAUNTING THAT ROOM. DOZENS OF
CUSTOMERS INCLUDING EMPLOYEES SUCH AS SECURITY AND THE FRONT DESK CLERK
WHO ALSO GIVE GHOST TOURS OF THE HOTEL HAVE WITNESSED ACTIVITY IN THAT
ROOM ALONE. I HAVE SEEN FIGURES APPEAR IN THAT ROOM SUCH AS MIST TYPE
FIGURES, ORBS, SHADOWS, AND FIGURES APPEARING IN THE MIRROR. SOMETIMES
TEMPERATURES WILL CHANGE SUDDENLY IN ROOM 333 FOR NO APPARENT REASON.
SCRATCHES ON THE DOOR OF 333 HAVE CONSTANTLY APPEARED ON THE DOOR WHEN
IT HAS BEEN PAINTED OVER. THERE IS A STUFFED MOUNTAIN LION LOCATED AT
THE TOP OF THE STAIRWELL IN THE LOBBY AREA. ONE ACCOUNT HAS BEEN GIVEN
REGARDING THE MOUNTAIN LION. APPARENTLY THE NIGHT AUDIT AND HER
GRANDSON WALKED OVER TO THE KITCHEN AREA TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT WHEN
BOTH HEARD A LOUD GROWL THAT BOTH THE NIGHT AUDIT AND GRANDSON
DESCRIBED AS A MOUNTAIN LION. THE SECURITY OFFICER, MYSELF, AND THE
MOTHER OF THE BOY WHO IS ALSO EMPLOYED AT THE HOTEL AS A FRONT DESK
CLERK WERE PRESENT AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT BUT WERE SEATED IN THE
LOBBY WHEN ALL OF US OBSERVED THE MOTHERS BOY RUNNING OUT OF THE
RESTAURANT SCREAMING AND HEADING BEHIND THE FRONT DESK. THE NIGHT AUDIT
CAME OUT AS WELL WITH HER HANDS COVERING HER MOUTH AND HER FACE
PRACTICALLY PURPLE. THEY STATED THAT THEY BOTH HEARD THE LOUD GROWL AND
THE BOY POINTED DIRECTLY AT THE MOUNTAIN LION. MYSELF, THE NIGHT AUDIT
AND THE LITTLE BOY WENT BACK TO THE KITCHEN AREA TO INVESTIGATE AND
HEARD NOTHING HOWEVER I DID TAKE PICTURES OF THE AREA THAT THEY HEARD
THE GROWL. I DID CAPTURE WHAT APPEARED TO BE A GLOWING GREEN MIST. I
CAN GO ON ABOUT ALL THE HAUNTINGS THAT GO ON THERE AT THE HOTEL BUT
THERE IS SO MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT THE HAUNTINGS THAT I ONLY FELT THAT
I SHOULD TELL YOU ABOUT THE MAIN AND MORE INTERESTING ONES. LET ME TELL
YOU, THIS HOTEL IS EXTREMELY HAUNTED AND IS WORTH CHECKING OUT. THE
NIGHT AUDIT GIVES FREE GHOST TOURS AND IT IS PROMISING THAT ANYONE WHO
GOES ON THE TOUR WILL EXPERIENCE GHOST ACTIVITY. NOT ONE TOUR CAME OUT
WITHOUT OBSERVING ACTIVITY. OTHER THAN THE GADSDEN HOTEL, THERE ARE
NUMEROUS HAUNTED PLACES IN DOUGLAS. TO NAME A FEW, THERE IS THE OLD
PHELPS DODGE BUILDING THAT IS LOCATED NEXT TO THE GADSDEN HOTEL THAT IS
HAUNTED, PLENTY OF GHOSTS HAVE BEEN WITNESSED THERE, THE AVENUE HOTEL
WHICH IS LOCATED ON G. AVE NOT TO FAR FROM THE GADSDEN IS HAUNTED AS
WELL. A LITTLE GIRL HAUNTS THE AVENUE HOTEL. QUITE A FEW RESIDENCES IN
DOUGLAS ARE ALSO HAUNTED AS WELL. "D" HILL LOCATED EAST OF DOUGLAS
APPARENTLY HAS STORIES OF A GHOST CAR THAT RUNS PEOPLE OFF THE ROAD. IF
YOU FLASH AND HONK YOUR CAR HORN 3 TIMES IT WILL APPEAR AT A HIGH RATE
OF SPEED BUT THIS POSSIBLY COULD BE AN URBAN LEGEND. IF YOU WOULD LIKE
TO ADD THIS TO YOUR SITE IT WOULD BE GREAT. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT
THE OTHER HAUNTINGS OR JUST WANT MORE INFORMATION, FEEL FREE TO E-MAIL
ME AND I WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE SOME MOREW INFORMATION WITH
YOU AND OTHERS. <br>

Holy Spirit?<br>
By:&nbsp; itcanhappentoyou@yahoo.com<br>
Back in 1987, I used to watch a religious program called "John Jacobs
&amp; the Power Team". One Saturday, the host John Jacobs, spoke about
how he was driving in his pick-up truck &amp; the holy spirit came to
him as a wind that went through his body and that he spoke in tongues.
The next morning at roughly 3am, I awoke to hear what sounded like a
tornado or hurricane in my room. I couldn't see anything because it was
really dark in my bedroom. I could however, sense this wind circled my
room twice then entered my body through my chest and stayed for a few
seconds that caused a chill throughout my body then it
left.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>
The Old Lady &amp; some others<br>
By: poppy-40@hotmail.co.uk <br>
I live in the UK, in Croydon (south of England). I'd like to share some
if the things that have happened to me over the years. I lived in a 3
bedroom semi-detached house in a fairly quiet road for about 15 years.
We moved out last year, &amp; although i had a few scary moments i
really miss the house. Anyway, it was your average size house, as you
come in the front door you have the kitchen straight ahead of you, the
front room to the right and the stairs to your left. If you go into the
kitchen or front room you could get in to the dining room, (there was a
door from each room into the other, if that makes sense). If you go up
the stairs you come to a tiny landing do a right go up another 4 steps
&amp; your in the landing where the bedrooms are, bathroom to your left
2 bedrooms pretty much straight ahead &amp; the another to your right.
We also had an attic. Anyway.....I always felt like i was being watched
in that house from the moment we moved in. I hated being home alone
because the feeling used to become more intense. We knew when we moved
in that a lady that lived there before us had died there, although my
mum didnt tell me or my little sis this until we were a bit older. I
wasnt surprised when she told me though, she just confirmed what i
already felt. Whenever you went up the stairs it would feel like
someone was right behind you chasing you. i would start walking up the
stairs but would always end up running, then as you turnt the corner it
suddenly felt like it wasnt behind you anymore &amp; that it was right
in front of you, waiting for you. i mentioned it to my mum a few times
but she would just tell me i was talking rubbish so i never said it to
her again, but my little sister agreed with me &amp; we would talk
about it quite often. nearly everyday i would be sitting in the front
room &amp; you could see into the hall &amp; up the stairs, the dog
often slept at the bottom of the stairs. Anyway both me &amp; the dog
would suddenly look up and my dog would watch something come down the
hall &amp; walk up the stairs &amp; the she would go back to what she
was doing. she often got out of the way as if she was letting someone
past if she was laying on the bottom step. Quite often you would hear
someone in the kitchen moving plates &amp; cups &amp; also upstairs in
the bathroom which had a really creaky floor. it would sound like
someone was pacing up and down. As i got older i started to see things
out of the corner of my eye and the feeling went from just a grumpy old
lady to something quite mean aswell. I started coming home finding my
sister petrified in the front room with her quilt over her &amp; the tv
really loud. When asked what was wrong she would say that something
black ran down the hall &amp; out the backdoor into the garden making a
really loud banging noise as it went. I only witnessed this once &amp;
it scared me so much i called my boyfriend round to search the back
garden but when i told him what had happened he wouldnt go &amp; look
either!!! lol A few of my friends had the same feelings of being chased
up the stairs &amp; once my friend stayed &amp; it was only me &amp;
her in the house as mum was on nights &amp; my sister was away &amp;
she went to the bathroom &amp; thought she had walked in on someone
&amp; came back in the bedroom &amp; woke asking me if my nan had come
to stay. Obviously she had not!! We shared a bed that night &amp;
neither of us got back to sleep!!&nbsp; The other thing i would like to
share is about my work. I work in a card shop in an old villagey sort
of place &amp; it has a huge basement under it that we use as the
stockroom. Iv found out that my shop the ones either side &amp; the
ones either side of them used to be a big pub dating back to the mid
1800s roughly. Anyway i always got that watched feeling (again) in the
basement. It didnt petrify me just made me feel uneasy sometimes. I was
at the desk which has no chair so your have to stand up &amp; its in
the corner so you have your back to the hole basement when i heard
shuffling feet accross concrete floor &amp; before i could look to see
what it was knowing that if someone had come downstairs i would of
heard them come through the heavy fire doors &amp; down the stairs,
something was thrown at the back of my leg. When i looked i found a
stone about the size of a 50p. When i looked at my leg there was a
bright red circle that was burning to touch where it had hit me. I just
said please dont throw things at me because that really hurt &amp;
carried on what i was doing. I never at any point felt threatened in
this basement. A few days later I was at the desk again &amp; i looked
to my left where the kitchen/staff room/ toilet is &amp; i saw a man
standing in the door way just watching me. I didnt feel scared just
curious. He was in his late 30s early 40s roughly wearing a tweed flat
cap, dirty white shirt, tweed waistcoat &amp; dirty brown trousers. He
had a sort of lost look on his face. I think he was from the times when
it was a pub. then he just turned &amp; walked into the kitchen out of
sight. I went in the kitchen to see if i could find him but obviously
no one was there!!! Im going to stop now, sorry for going on so much. I
have other things that have happened but il save them for another
time.&nbsp; Thanks for listening,<br>

My Experiences<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jhaneji22@gmail.com<br>
Well I don't know where to start I have random things happen to me in
different places.....its small things nothing like a huge story but I
guess I can post things that are happened to me this year.&nbsp; At my
boyfriend's house was I was watching constantine with my boyfriend and
his mom.&nbsp; I believe it was half way into the movie, I heard
snoring close to my left ear and my boyfriend heard heavy breathing
coming from his left side as well.&nbsp; We both looked at each other
than to the left as his mom was sitting on the chair and notorious for
snoring as well.&nbsp; Well it turns out she was awake and watching the
movie then I looked back at him and whispered "She is awake maybe its
your uncle." I turned and asked her if his uncle was on the stairs, she
replied "Oh no honey he left 30 minutes ago." when she asked why we
told her and she sat by me scared but where she sat at I had seen a
depression as if someone had sat there.&nbsp; I had more experiences at
his house too and the same breathing sound as well.&nbsp; Then just
recently last month my younger sister and I had heard a large dog growl
just outside the sewing room of the our house.&nbsp; We couldn't figure
it out as when I looked nothing was there in the yard at all but we
heard it clearly and loudly that it freaked us out.&nbsp; After that my
cat slept with me the whole week and ran to the window of my room to
look outside and was swishing her tail looking at something.&nbsp; When
I looked outside I saw nothing and went back my bed to sleep to which
she came to me again and slept close to me. Nothing has happened after
that week when she did that and I am glad for it.<br>

My Life Experiences<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arachnamist@hotmail.com<br>
Hello, this is my story of a few random things that have occurred over
the years...&nbsp; One night when I was about 9 or so my dad was away
on business...&nbsp; so, I was lying awake in my bed because there was
a thunderstorm, and it was a rather noisy one, so every time that I
began to drift off, thunder boomed and I would be jolted awake...&nbsp;
So, I was laying in my bed and was beginning to become very annoyed
because I just wanted to go to sleep, and had school the next
day.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t half asleep, or even partially for that matter, I
was fully alert when my incident occurred.&nbsp; the storm began to die
down, but to be safe I just was going to wait a few minutes to see if
it was going to be loud again.&nbsp; I began to feel a very evil
presence.&nbsp; Suddenly, I heard something moving around in the
bathroom, and then I started to hear something dragging it&#8217;s feet
across the carpet.&nbsp; I knew nothing was there because I was staring
right into the hallway, and the footfalls were happening, yet...&nbsp;
nothing was causing them.&nbsp; I was terrified and could not fall
asleep after this. until my furnace turned on, which for some odd
reason comforted me.&nbsp; To this day (I&#8217;m 17) I still feel the
effects of this horrible night, for I cannot sleep without some sort of
noise going, like my TV for example.&nbsp; This incident happened one
other time as well, I was sleeping on the couch (well beginning to fall
asleep) and I heard it, but I wasn&#8217;t as afraid...&nbsp; I was quite
tired that night, so maybe that&#8217;s why I just didn&#8217;t react very
much.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another experience I had that was really
weird happened during the day.&nbsp; I was in my parents room (who were
outside at the time) with my cousin (don&#8217;t ask why, I don&#8217;t really even
remember,) which has a window that faces a wall, and the door was
open.&nbsp; I had just looked up and saw this shadow on my wall that
looked like a human, just like walking back and forth. it was a solid
shadow, and we had a shade that was down, so if it was my parents, it
wouldn&#8217;t look solid, but just to make sure it wasn&#8217;t them, I looked out
the window, and no one was there, nobody in sight, and the shadow I saw
was big, like if it was anybody, they would have been very close to the
window.&nbsp; creepier yet, it was almost a full sized person, and my
parents window are higher than most people, I&#8217;m 6 feet tall, and every
time I see him, we try to re-create this, I&#8217;m about 6 feet tall, taller
than everyone who was at my house that day, and don&#8217;t stand that
tall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next story I&#8217;m going to try and
condense.&nbsp; I was at my grandparents house, and was with my cousin,
yet again, and the rest of the family was in the living room.&nbsp; By
this point, I was fascinated with the paranormal, and I knew quite a
bit about them from reading this site, so I decided to take pictures
with my grandfathers digital camera, and record some evp&#8217;s on my cell
phone, like they do on TV, and I&#8217;m thinking it knew, because I felt the
same presence that I did at my house, a few years ago when I heard the
footsteps, especially in the basement, which I will get to in a
second.&nbsp; My grandfather&#8217;s camera didn&#8217;t capture anything, and I
had just about given up hope, when I took a random picture near my
grandmother&#8217;s feet, kind of as a joke (my cousin and I have a weird
sense of humor,) and I couldn&#8217;t believe my eyes, there on the screen,
was a sort of ectoplasm, surrounding her feet....&nbsp; I took another
to be sure, and it was still there, one more, and it was gone.&nbsp;
The same day, I was in the back room with my cousin, the door was shut,
and I heard someone knock, opened the door, and nobody was there.&nbsp;
I asked, and nobody had left the room.&nbsp; The pictures,
unfortunately were lost a long time ago, and I regret not keeping a
better eye on that file, and putting it on a floppy disc, because my
grandfather laughed about it, even when I showed him the pictures, and
deleted it finally one day.&nbsp; About my grandparent&#8217;s
basement....&nbsp; My uncle lived down there, who I know practiced
Satanism.&nbsp; So, that could be the evil I
felt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One closing story...&nbsp; It&#8217;s
actually my dad&#8217;s, which is weird, because everyone I mentioned in this
story, were the people who I&#8217;m related to from my father&#8217;s side.&nbsp;
the night my other uncle was born (my dad&#8217;s youngest brother,) he was
looking out the window, waiting for news about what was going on, saw a
face looking in the window, and disappeared in a split second.&nbsp;
These stories are 100% true, and are told in the order in which I
experienced them.&nbsp; Thank you for taking the time for reading my
stories.<br>

My Little Encounter<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XRainbowXHolicX@hotmail.com<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;I live in Indiana (where nothing fun ever happens, it seems.) But
I am really intrigued by the whole "paranormal" subject (not only
involving ghosts or "entities, I suppose.) but I am actually scared if
the whole incident ever came around me or happened to me. It's just the
whole unknown feeling that creeps me out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But
one time when My family and I were in the middle of moving from house
to house. But this night we decided to stay one last full week in this
house. The only person that has died there was my grandpa. I had never
had any feeling or sighting of such paranormal activity. I never
thought that there was a ghost in the house. But every now and again
when I was in the house even when my grandparents were still in that
house (we inherited it when my grandmother passed away.) I would hear a
quick male chuckle, or a quick "Hey!" from a male. I was the only one
that ever heard those noises. They occurred maybe, 4 or 5 times my
whole time being there. This one hallway though always gave me the
creeps, I would have to run down it. I don't know what it was but it
felt like someone was right behind me. But, of course no one ever was.
I am always paranoid like that. Nothing happens to me yet I do feel
like there is someone constantly watching me, and I know in my head
that there isn't anyone. But during that one week, it was Sunday or
Monday I think. And my brother and step dad went to the gas station for
pop. So that left my mother and I home alone. My mom was in her room
watching Ghost Hunters (What a coincidence, right?) and I was in the
family room playing video games. Everything was fine until I heard the
TV turn off and my mom come in. She looked rather startled and had wide
eyes and said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fan just flew out of the wall."
My mom has a little portable fan (It's a thing like a night light for a
little kid, they can't sleep without it. She has to hear the sound of
the fan.) So, I went into the room and the fan looked like it had been
pulled and thrown, with enough strength to unplug it. That instantly
gave us the chills. Now later that night I had to take a shower, I was
so frightened that I had to have the shower curtain pulled back so I
could see everything that was going on in the bathroom. Now, my bedroom
at the time had no side walls, because it was the old family room, we
were going to make it into my bedroom and my little step sister took my
room. Now, my room is right on the other side of the actually family
room. My little step sister had her big toys and what-not that didn't
fit in her room in there. One of them was a Disney Princess Kitchen. It
made sounds like any other annoying child toy and it had voice sounds,
like you would hear Cinderella say something or Jasmine. So I was
heading into bed, turned on my TV, and relaxed, but I did feel a dread
feeling, like I had all day, I just felt like something was going to
happen. All of a sudden I hear this animated bubbling and water running
sound. Then I hear a girl say very very loudly over and over "Want to
have tea time with me?" It just kept playing, I stood paralyzed
(because I was so frightened) then gasped and yelled and screamed for
my mom. Both my mother and step dad came rushing in. But as soon as
their door clicked to open, it all stopped. I explained everything that
happened and my mom started laughing (she's cruel like that sometimes
when I'm scared.) I walked with them to see what was the noise, I
instantly knew it was her little kitchen toy. But the sound that I
heard, you have to turn the plastic sink handle completely around. And
the little girl asking about tea time, I thought you had to flip the
little recipe book, but it didn't do it. We never found out was that
was, it was so loud. So that night, I slept on the floor in my
brother's room. The next day in the morning I felt fine. But once I got
off the bus after school I instantly felt dread and like I was being
watched. I felt like someone was in that house guarding or protecting
it. As we headed in the house I felt like a million eyes were
constantly on me. My brother never ever had anything happen to him, he
never even felt anything. I just felt watched that whole day, but it
felt like a feminine presence. After that everything went smoothly, I
never felt like that again, well I akways feel like I'm being watched
but you know what I mean, I apologize for this being so
long.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you!<br>

My Personal Experiences<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jroberts227@hotmail.com<br>
I have recently found your site and have been enjoying it greatly. I
have some experiences to relate. I don't know if they qualify as ghost
stories, but they are paranormal. I find it strange that I forget many
details of the past, yet these experiences have remained vivid memories
to this day. When I was about 3 years old, my parents and I lived in
Pincher Creek, Alberta, Canada. My dad was a truck driver, so it was
usually just me and my mom at home. We had a finished basement in our
house where my dad kept all of his trophy hunting mounts. One day, I
was playing in the basement, alone. I had a little table that I had put
a blanket over for a "house." I decided that it should be night time,
so I switched off the light and ran to my "house," and crawled inside.
Just as I got completely inside, the table began to violently shake.
Terrified, I dove out from under and ran to the stairs and switched on
the light. No one was there. When I was about 10 years old or so, my
family lived near a small community called Valleyview, Alberta, Canada.
I wasn't feeling well that day and had a fever. My parents had
something to do, I don't remember exactly what, but I do remember that
they left me in the house alone, taking my younger brother and sister
with them. This was one of the first times I was left home alone. I was
laying on my bed in my room when I saw a face look around my door jam.
Then a figure stepped out into my door way. I remember that the figure
was shorter than I, and very slight. It's head was rather large and had
no hair on it. It's face seemed to be too small for the size of it's
head and was very fine featured. It's ears were pointed on top and
swept backwards, although they were not over large. It was all over
green. It looked at me for awhile, then would step out of site, they
step back into view and look at me some more. I became aware that there
were more of them that look similar, but smaller still. I was very
afraid. There was a .22 calibre rifle in my closet, I dashed over, got
the rifle and loaded it. Then I jumped back into my bed with the loaded
rifle and a box of ammunition. I resolved that if the figures tried to
come into my room, I would shoot them. I don't know how long this went
on for, but it stopped completely about 20 minutes before my parents
and siblings came home. When I heard them, I quickly put the rifle back
in my closet and got back into be. I never told anyone about it until
now, 27 years later. I do not know to this day what that was, if I
actually saw something or my my fever had spiked and I was seeing
things. All I know is the experience is still a vivid memory. Finally,
when I was 15 or 16 years old, my family and I lived in a place called
Errington, on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. Some
friends and I were at a church that my family attended. We were in a
small side room. Also present was the pastor and a few others, I don't
remember, and a young man that had literally walked in off the street.
The adults were talking to him, trying to convert him so he could be
"saved." At some point it became apparent to the pastor that he was
possessed by a demonic force, and they began to pray for him in an
effort to cast this demon out. As they were doing this, my friends and
I were over by the door, undecided as to whether we should stay of
leave. It was about then the a chair that sat in a corner of the room,
well away from us or the adults suddenly slid to the side about 3 or 4
feet, over carpet. That made our decision easy, we got out of there. I
still go certain places, particularly those places that have long
histories, and I get very strange feelings that are difficult to
explain. It's like a vaguely electric full body sensation. Cheers.<br>

My Son and His Ghosts<br>
By:&nbsp; elh2os74@yahoo.com<br>
&nbsp;My family used to house sit for a friend when they went to
Malaysia every year. When my son was a baby, we always set up his
playpen in one of the kids' bedrooms. Until one night. We were watching
tv in the living room, DJ was in bed. About 20 minutes after we laid
him down, I heard a bloodcurdling scream. My husband and I ran to the
room. My son was standing up, sobbing and pointing towards the air vent
high up on the wall. We took him out into the living room to calm down.
When we attempted to put him back to bed, he physically fought us and
screamed,"NO! Bad!" Eventually, he went to bed with us. The next
morning, I woke up to the sink in the attached bathroom turned on full
blast. My husband was still asleep, my son wasn't big enough to reach
it. Shrugging, I just turned it off. The rest of the day was
uneventful, until that evening. My son had been playing, running from
the living room, through the kitchen and dining room, into the family
room. This house had vaulted ceilings with cutouts high in the walls to
display vases and such. I noticed that as my son ran, he was looking up
at these "shelves". Finally, he comes into the living room, yelling, "
the liitle boy won't come down! He's gonna get hurt!" We followed him
into the dining room where he pointed up high at the shelf. I couldn't
see anything, but I knew he could, so I asked the little boy to come
down and play with DJ. My son calmed down, so I believe he listened.
That night, my friend called to check up on the house and I jokingly
said, "You have a ghost." Without breaking stride, she said, "oh, you
met our little boy!" He is known for turning on the water, messing with
the cat and dog bowls and running through the house. She had no
explanation for what had scared him in her daughter's bedroom, though.
As interesting as this was, what was more interesting was that, after
we went home, the family never heard from the little boy again.<br>

My Story<br>
By:&nbsp; bethlippitt@hotmail.com<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't told this too many people. But, here we
go... A few years ago, I lived in Portsmouth, VA. I was stationed there
with my husband and son. It was a beautiful, historic place. Our
townhome was perfect and old. We moved in and soon figured out we would
be believers in ghost.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a month
after moving in, little things started going missing. Keys, a certain
baby toy, and a boot for work. We would ask each other if we moved
things, but neither one of us said we did.&nbsp; After really looking
around, to no provail, we checked the baby's room. By the closet or in
the closet were the items missing. We thought it was strange, but went
about the day. This lasted a few months.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next came
"the funny feelings". Like the day my son, who was almost a year old,
watched something move around just in front of him.&nbsp; He would
stare at empty spaces. My husband and I would get the feeling of being
watched, followed in the rooms, or a wave of fear. We noticed that even
our son wasn't sleeping well in his room. He cried when left alone in
the crib in his room or the living room in his bouncy seat.&nbsp; We
started to worry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I even asked the
landlord if anything strange happened to previous tenents. She ignored
my questions and never called back. I asked a neighbor, he stated that
there was a story of poltergist activity a block away from here. He
said he sleeps with music playing and all lights on. He refused to come
in my home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After talking to neighbors,
things took on a whole new level of fear. My son was no longer sleeping
in his room, we rarely were on separate floors alone. The closet door
was always opening. Not just walking away and coming back to it open, I
mean it opened on it's own while I folded baby clothes. We stopped
using that room altogether.&nbsp; Our son who watched the invisible
something, stopped. He would stare at something approaching and scream
in pure fear! The spirit in the home was very bold. It would turn off
the lights when we walked upstairs, open the sliding closet door in our
room during the night then slam it shut, and purposely scare the baby,
and took our Saint Christopher necklaces. We stopped using the upstairs
all together. Our dog even started to lose hair. Little sounds during
the night, smells of dirt or flowers was overpowering at
times.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The feeling of being intimidated, threatened,
and taunted was coming to a boilingly point. I would hide on the couch
with the dog and baby or escape outside, I would avoid looking in
mirrors in case I would see something. I would stand at the bottom of
the stairs staring up, the closet door in the baby's room would open, I
would run up the stairs, hear the closet door slam shut behind me, Id
run to my room and grab clothes, the baby would scream, I'd run to the
stairs, just to hear my dog start barking and the closet door reopen.
Everyday.&nbsp; This was for 3 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We even called
a haunting society to come. The medium said to leave our home. The
closet was always opening and closing. The society members only stayed
35 minutes and grabbed their stuff and ran. The medium said it's a
women of pure anger. She means harm. We started looking for new&nbsp;
places to live.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few days later, our
neighbor asked if we had someone visiting. I said no. He said there was
a women looking out the window the day before. Later on that evening,
my husband woke me up. He said in a whisper, "listen". You could hear
our closet door open, something step out with heavy shoes, they walked
slowly to the doorway to the hallway. We both stood up and stared at
the ceiling. We followed the footsteps and reliesed something was at
the top of the stairs facing down. We were at the bottom of the stairs
around the corner. Slowly, something started down the steps. We both
froze in fear. Just when we would have been face to face, I paniced and
ran for the baby and something stormed up the stairs and slammed the
closet door shut.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the last time the baby and
I lived there. We moved to a new home. That was the longest and the
most terrifying 8 months of my life. Our landlord said no one stays
long there and she let us break our lease. I didn't believe in ghost
growing up. I WAS a "believe it when I see it" person. I believe in
them and fear them...<br>

Our Home in Noblesville IN.<br>
By:&nbsp; eight_ball77@hotmail.com<br>
The house we currently live in was built in1893 in Noblesville, IN. I
hope to soon research the history of my home when I have a little time,
perhaps maybe be able to learn the names of the ghosts in my house. We
bought our house in January of 2007. The first night and many nights
after, I wake up around 3am and feel my bed lightly shaking. To me it
feels like someone is shivering uncontrollably. I do not feel scared at
all and will fall back to sleep without a problem. We&#8217;ve heard heavy
footsteps on the stairs that are currently carpeted and do not make
loud noise when the living ascends or descends. My oldest daughter said
she has seen shapes of people on the hallway wall walking past her
bedroom door. Most recently my mother spent the night with us and chose
to sleep on the couch in the living room. When her eyes were closed but
before she fell asleep, she said she got this weird feeling that
someone was watching her. She opened her eyes and saw two ghosts, a
mother and young daughter (she just knew they were related) and they
slowly faded away before her eyes. When I asked what they were wearing,
my mother said white old fashion gowns or dresses. Soon after that I
woke up in the middle of the night in my room and could feel energy
building up all around me. I started praying until it went away. A few
weeks ago when I was dressing for bed, my closet door opened with a
force like someone inside of the closet kicked or pushed the door open.
I did get scared that time and left my room still trying to get my top
on leaving the lights on and dresser drawers open. My step-daughter
said one night she went to go get a DVD out of the living room and went
to turn off the light when she was done, but the light did not go off.
When she turned her head to try to push the switch again, she saw a
little girl sitting on the couch. She ran back upstairs to my other
daughter&#8217;s room and stayed there for the rest of the night telling no
one what happened until the next day. A few nights ago I was reading in
my bed and to my right where the closet is, I saw out of the corner of
my eye what I can only describe as being a vertical heat wave (not hot
but the air was wavy like on a hot summers day) pass my bed towards the
closet. I just thought I was tired until it went back the way it came.
I didn&#8217;t see it again after that. There was one other time where I
mopped a small section of our dining room floor, white ceramic tile, to
clean up a mess my 6 year old made. I sat at the table reading a book
order form when my step-daughter came down the stairs. I went to warn
her about the slick spot and not to walk in it when I looked down and
there were small foot prints leading from the wet spot into the living
room where my 6yr old was. I knew no one walked in the dining room, at
least not a visible person that I could see, but I compared my 6yr olds
foot with that of the foot prints on the floor anyway. The footprints
were without a doubt smaller than my daughter&#8217;s. There are of course
more experiences, not quite like the above, but I&#8217;ve said quite enough.
If anything bigger happens, like if they appear before me, I&#8217;ll let you
know!<br>

Rogers (Cross Hollows), Arkansas<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LJVP44@aol.com<br>
We lived in a house real near the Cross Hollows area, between Rogers,
Arkansas &amp; Lowell, Ar.&nbsp; One night we had family staying with
us during a holiday.&nbsp; We were all talking and all of a sudden
there was this huge noise on our wood floor, not 10 feet from where we
sat talking.&nbsp;&nbsp; It sounded exactly like a bull whip slapping
the floor. Needless to say, we all ran in the other room until we could
gather our thoughts, it scared us so badly. Since the area used to
house thousands of Civil War soldiers, we had to chalk it up to that,
as we could find no other explanation, but this was in the
1980's.&nbsp; <br>

Phantom Plane<br>
By:mlarsh@woh.rr.com<br>
It was a beautiful,early summer afternoon in western Ohio.I was driving
my car and turned onto a entrance ramp of a four-lane divided
highway.Heading south,I looked to my left and saw a large airplane
sitting still in the northbound lanes of the roadway.The plane had two
propeller engines,was entirely white in color and had an orange stripe
running the length of the aircraft.I have heard of airplanes making an
emergency landing upon roads many times before,so I thought this was
simply one of those situations.I stopped the car and watched and waited
for the local police to arrive.Several minutes passed,and still there
was no activity in or around the plane.The police did not arrive as I
had expected.It was even more odd that there was absolutely no other
vehicles driving upon a highway that is usually a very busy stretch of
road.I continued to watch and took note of the details of the
aircraft.I knew it was old,but I was not sure how old.Oh how I wish I
had a camera that day.I decided to continue on to my destination about
one mile further down the road.After I finished my business,I drove
north toward where I had seen the airplane and expected the police to
be there to direct traffic away from the blocked highway.The airplane
was not there! How could this be possible? It was there only fifteen
minutes ago.I was now freaking out wondering what the heck just
happened.The plane could not have taken off because of the overpass
bridge directly in front of it.If it had, why would the pilot have
needed to make such an emergency landing? Nothing made sense to
me.Later that day I searched the Internet to find a photo of the
plane.I found a picture of an airplane with the same paint job and
nearly fainted.It was a Douglas DC-3 built in the 1930's-40's.They were
used for passengers and cargo,and the military also used them.Thousands
of these planes were built.The wingspan is 95 feet and the length is 64
feet.These planes revolutionized air travel because of their ability to
fly coast to coast non-stop.Today I still wonder why and how this
happened and will never forget it.I have told my story to several
friends and family members over the years with just one regret.I should
have gotten out of the car and walked over to the plane and knocked on
the door.I recall at the time my gut instinct told me to move on.I
could have taken a trip to somewhere or nowhere, I will never know.<br>

Quad Ride<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ell.bell1lover@hotmail.com<br>
Last night around 8 30 my friends Emily and Kate and I were relaxing
and having fun and decided to go on a quad ride up and down our road,
Emily was in the front I was on the back and Kate was in the
middle&nbsp; after we went up and down the road about five times Emily
and I decided to switched places so I would be driving and she would be
in the back we did this in front of a big rock wall which has a
vineyard and a&nbsp; lot of trees and an empty space and more rocks.
Emily and I switched spots and I was waiting for her to get situated
and all of the sudden she screamed &#8220;GOO!!&#8221; at that moment I was
frightened and so I stepped on it after we reached her house we stopped
and she told us what happened. she said she saw a black figure and it
was saying something to her but she couldn&#8217;t recall what it was saying
we were a little creped out so we drove back a little ways and we
stopped right next to my gate and Kate said she saw a black figure so I
pulled into my yard and we put the quad away. Kate wanted to check it
out so Emily and I stood by my gate as she walked down the street she
said if you hear me scream wait for me and then run. So we waited&nbsp;
and we heard her scream so then we all started running. She said she
saw a black figure and so she took two steps towards it and she felt
something touch her that&#8217;s when she screamed. We all were really creped
out so we went back to where it 1st all started taking place. Two of
the neighbors dogs came to us and were with us and they were acting
kind of odd. We were all quiet for a minute and Kate and Emily heard
footsteps and we were getting creped out Kate shined her flash light
into all of the trees and rocks . She saw a black figure, right then ..
all&nbsp; I was thinking was this is not a dream and im not going to
die and im not going to be stupid like the people in the scary
movies.&nbsp; We ran back a little ways and waited a minute then we
walked back and looked and there was no black figure .. Kate started
towards&nbsp; where she saw the figure while Emily and I were standing
back to back shaking, I was watching Kate while Emily was behind me at
this point it has been a half an hour of us outside listening and
waiting, Kate was standing there a good 30 feet away and all of the
sudden she fell it wasn&#8217;t like a slip or a trip I saw the whole thing
her feet came out from under her and as she fell the light was moving a
and I saw all around her feet and I didn&#8217;t see any one or anything or
any feet. I was really scared Kate got up and we all ran. We really
wanted to know what was going on and who or what was doing this to us.
We walked back and we all had an adrenaline rush and we were not&nbsp;
going to leave each other again&nbsp; so we all walked behind the rock
wall and Emily and Kate heard footsteps at that time we were being very
cautious. Ten minutes when by and we were still seeing the black
figures again and again we pointed the light in one direction and we
looked past our breath and we saw more breath a good 50 feet&nbsp; away
from us. We were holding on tight at this time the dogs went away but
we could hear them barking frantically and who knows what we were
scared we were ready to go back and get some rest as we were walking
slowly as we were 5 feet away form the road I told Kate to keep
watching behind us and I was looking towards her as I said so and all
of the sudden she fell and I felt her going down and again it wasn&#8217;t a
slip or a trip it was almost as though as she was pushed but I could
see nothing. we were frantic Kate was about to cry and she was on the
ground trying to get up but she could hardly . she finally got up and
we ran .. we ran like a bat outta hell we came to a walk as we were
walking down a hill towards Emily's house we were all quiet and we
heard almost something almost sounded like a pin dropping and we
stopped and thought. I didn't kick any thing or drop anything that
could of made that sound it was almost as if it fell out of nowhere we
looked around and we couldn&#8217;t see anything .we started walking again
this morning on my walk home from her house I looked around for what
ever had made the sound and I saw something it was very weird and
didn&#8217;t quiet make sense why it would be in the middle of our road. I do
not know what happened last night but my 14 years of living on that
street nothing like that has ever happened to me or my family.<br>

&nbsp;Rusk, Texas<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jamesaxbrice@msn.com<br>
I have told at least two stories on here, but I can't remember if I
included this one.&nbsp; I should be out doing yard work, but this is
now a diversion.&nbsp; As I have before stated,&nbsp; I have three
types of supernatural stories.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those I read about from
people I don't know,&nbsp; those that have actually happened to me
personally, and those which have happened to people I know well and
trust.&nbsp;&nbsp; This story is from the last group.&nbsp; John and
Mary were very good friends of my ex-wife and me for years.&nbsp; This
story happened in a house in Rusk, Texas in which I am pretty sure was
haunted.&nbsp; This took place in the early eighties.&nbsp; They moved
into the house and John got a job while Mary stayed at home with her
young three-year-old son, Robbie.&nbsp; Robbie would be playing in his
room as Mary went about her day and she began realizing that the young
boy was actually holding conversations...at first she thought it was an
imaginary playmate, but when she would walk in and question the boy he
would look guilty and say it was nothing, as if he were trying to hide
something.&nbsp; One time, as she was walking by his room,&nbsp; she
saw Robbie talking away to his empty rocking chair.&nbsp; The
terrifying thing was that it had rocked, almost as if someone had
gotten out of it in a hurry and it was on its last rock.&nbsp; Her
blood went cold.&nbsp; She maturely and non-chalantly&nbsp; began to
question Robbie over the next couple of days,&nbsp; and he opened up to
her slowly.&nbsp; He said that he was talking with a boy a little older
than him named Goon.&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy had a sister he talked about
but that Robbie had never seen named Dixie Rose.&nbsp;&nbsp; While Mary
was working out in the yard one day her son walked up to her and
pointed to a thick hedge.&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's where Dixie Rose is
buried", he said matter-of-factly.&nbsp; This scared Mary, because she
couldn't imagine a three year old coming up with such things.&nbsp; She
called her friend and told her everything, and while she was recounting
the story a coffee cup,&nbsp; hung on a hook flew off the hook and
bounced around on the hard floor without breaking,&nbsp; rolling into
the wall.&nbsp; This terrified Mary.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her husband,&nbsp; a
nice guy, was not very convinced and definitely not a believer, so he
blew it off whenever she talked to him about it.&nbsp; He would just
switch the subject.&nbsp; In this same house another incident
happened.&nbsp; Mary had a good ex-college friend who was going to
visit them in June for a week or so,&nbsp; and they were both
thrilled.&nbsp; Unfortunately, John's troublesome,&nbsp;&nbsp;
alcoholic uncle showed up out of the blue and out of a job,&nbsp; so
John told him he could sleep in the empty bedroom until Mary's friend
came, then he could sleep on the couch.&nbsp; John said he would give
his uncle one month to "get it together and leave" as he put it.&nbsp;
Unfortunately,&nbsp; the uncle was still there when Mary's old
girlfriend showed up.&nbsp; So,&nbsp; they put the woman in the empty
bedroom and made John's uncle sleep on the couch.&nbsp; On the second
or third night,&nbsp; the visiting woman was sleeping when she realized
that another woman was sitting on her bed shaking her gently awake,
whispering, "Honey,&nbsp; you have to wake up now!...Wake up!"&nbsp; A
little factoid here.&nbsp; Mary said this&nbsp; woman was the deepest
sleeper she had ever known and had chronic problems with sleeping
through alarm clocks and such.&nbsp; At first the woman thought it was
Mary waking her up for something, so she sat up and rubbed her eyes and
when she opened them again, there was no one on her bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
BUT...her bedroom door was slowly opening,&nbsp; and she screamed
mightily.&nbsp; John and Mary ran to her door only to find the uncle
trying to sneak into her room.&nbsp; He made some excuse about wanting
to get some book which apparently wasn't there, so John kicked him
out.&nbsp; The woman stayed her full visit and didn't have another
incident happen to her.&nbsp; All of these things took place in the
same house in Rusk, Texas.<br>

THE LILAC LADY<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean.Schwind@as.willscot.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
My encounter with the other world happened one warm summer evening when
I was 16 yrs old. My friends and I had heard about this haunted house
just outside of the city. Supposedly it had been the home of a mother
and son who died in some bizarre murder suicide scenario. The son was
supposed to have gone to Vietnam as a Canadian volunteer and had come
home "crazy" from the war. He apparently had an obsession with guns and
finally snapped and killed his mother and then himself with his army
issue M-16 rifle. A friend of a friend had told us one night at a party
that he had seen some weird stuff out at this house, and being teens
newly licensed and free in our parents barrowed cars, 5 or 6&nbsp; of
us boys vowed to head out of the city on Friday night after dinner to
check it out. It was a short ride out of the city and like most teenage
boys out on a lark we were in high spirits, joking and laughing at the
thought of a good scare. This was the time of the dawn of the slasher
movies so the story attached to the house sort of felt like it was made
for Jamie Lee Curtis and her brother Michael Myers. We loved the idea
of walking around a "murder site" and were really more intent on
souvenir hunting rather than looking and actually believing that we
would see ghosts like our party buddy had told us. We arrived at the
site and parked the cars along the side of the hiway. I remember that
there was a row of old Burch trees that lined the road on either side
of the old dirt driveway, and I remember feeling this overwhelming
sense of foreboding and that all of a sudden this place&nbsp; was more
real than I had thought it would be. As we crossed the hiway and
gathered our small crew of guys together at the end of the driveway my
sense that something was actually going to happen to us increased and I
felt kind of silly and scared as hell all at the same time. The boys
stood at the end of this longish dirt driveway that ran up to the house
that we could just make out through the bushes and trees. The driveway
arched along to the right and at the apex of the arch grew these huge
lilac bushes that had gone wild and leaned out into the driveway
blocking the view of anything behind them including the house. Trying
to beat down my internal uneasiness, I called a couple of the guys
chickens and loudly proclaimed that I was going to be the first one in
the house as I took off running up the driveway with the intention of
beating everyone else to the house to prove my bravery, more to myself
than the guys. The rest of the guys hung back a bit laughing as I
started to sprint round the giant lilacs and lose sight of them. Coming
around the bushes I finally saw the house which was a smallish two
storey farm house the like of which populate the farming communities of
eastern Ontario. A little wooden porch attached to the faded brick
facade and a battered front door faced me. I remember being surprised
that the house wasn't a wreck and that the windows were not all broken
out, and when I let my gaze wander up to the second floor bedroom
windows I saw a woman looking down at me. We made eye contact and I
know she was looking at me like I was looking at her. She was a middle
age lady in a simple kind of bluish dress with an yellow apron tied
around her waist ala 1950's June Cleaver. I remember feeling
embarrassed that we were obviously trespassing on someone&#8217;s property
and just at that time the guys began to round the lilacs so I pulled my
gaze away to tell them to turn around because we had made a mistake and
when I turned back a split second later she was fading away like a mist
or something, like fading away a little at a time until she was just
gone. My buddies thought I was trying to scare them when they came up
around me and I was standing there looking up at that window with my
mouth hanging open. I felt weak and sick and scared as hell and started
backing up telling the guys that I didn't like this place and that we
should get out of there. My feelings of unease had escalated into full
on fear and I refused to go into the house with the rest to look for
blood stains or whatever. Every fiber of my being told me to stay out
of that house and I paced back and forth out front while the guys
scrounged around inside the whole house. I kept looking up at the
bedroom window to see if anyone was there and was startled at one point
when one of my buddies appeared in the window I had seen the lady in. I
kept expecting to hear her telling the guys to get out of her house but
all I could hear was the laughing and horse play going on inside.
Eventually the guys had been all over the interior and had not found
any evidence of murder or blood or anything to support the story and
drifted out to where I was one by one kind of snickering at the whole
story and our party buddy who had obviously made it all up. All I
wanted to do was bolt down the driveway but I hung on to my composure
and waited for someone else to say lets get out of here. I even managed
to stand my ground as the guys passed around me headed down the drive
to the cars and was one of the last two guys to begin the walk around
the Lilac bushes. Just before I knew the house would disappear from
view I was compelled to turn and look back even though I was so scared
that I was feeling a cold sweat on my face. Determined not to be a punk
I forced myself to look back and when I did the lady was standing on
the porch. I stopped dead in my tracks and stared at her and then she
waved her hand at me. I mean raised her hand at me and she had this sad
soft kind of smile playing at the corner of her lips. I can see her
right now as I write this so real and totally solid. The other last guy
kept walking and I think I called his name hoping that he had looked
back to see what I was seeing but he had not and was already beyond the
lilac bush and away. When I turned back from trying to spot him the
lady was gone. To this day some 30 or so years later I sometimes dream
about coming round that corner and seeing that lady. I never said
anything to the boys not wanting to provide ammo for a continuous
hazing, but it took me days to lose that feeling of foreboding and
emptiness that I think was coming from the lady that had raised her
hand and waived at me before she disappeared.If she wasn't a ghost then
I don't know how my buddies didn't see her inside that house.&nbsp; The
funny thing is that if I let myself be really honest with myself I know
she was ghost and I know that there is something that continues after
death...That's my story......<br>
