Ghosts of Alabama<br>
<br>
By: tcovert@charter.net<br>
<br>
while i was in the army i was stationed at redstone arsenal in
huntsville, alabama and that was in 1964 to 1966. but i believe that
this happened to me in 1965. a girl that i was going with at the time
picked me up at my barracks in her car and a friend of mine came along
too for a night on the town. that night it was raining and the wind was
blowing and my lady friend suggested that we go see the ghost of a
woman that had jumped off a bridge and had drowned in a tributary of
the tennesse river which i immediately scoffed at and made fun. this
bridge was out in the country from huntsville which i would not
remember how to get back to. we parked about 25 yards from the bridge
and waited because she had said that the ghost was supposed to appear
at midnight. it was still raining and the wind was blowing and there
was no lights whatsoever just complete darkness and no cars at all on
that gravel road. at approximately midnight my lady friend in a
startled voice said look and what i saw was a bluish form of a woman on
the bridge and it was transparent. so i told my friends that i was
going to walk up to the bridge to get a better look. so i got out of
the car and started walking up to bridge and about that time my lady
friend started screaming for me not to go and when she did that it
scared me so i got back in the car and we started the engine and turned
on the lights and whatever it was was not there anymore. i doubt myself
to this day as to what i saw but i know i saw something. does that
sense? i am a believer now. have you heard of this story before. please
write back. p.s. the guy that was with us did not see anything. how
crazy is that?<br>

Goodwill Hauntings<br>
<br>
<br>

I worked at the goodwill on George St as a night watchman for 2 years.
I did hear and see some wierd things such as; alarms going off in the
middle of the night. The alarm company would phone me informing me of
movement in the area and there would be no one there. The spooky part
about it is that it would not only be one alarm going off it would be 2
or 3 going off one after the other as if some one was walking around
tripping&nbsp; alarms. On other occasions i would be sitting at the
front desk, were us security gaurds would chill out, and the phone
would ring in middle of the night and on the call display ,it would say
cafeteria, i would pick it up and no one would be there. This happened
about 3 or 4 times in 2 years i was there. I finally clued in on the
3rd time that was a little wierd considering it was 3am and no one was
in the buiding.On one occasion i was doing these patrols called
'diester patrols'its were you walk around the whole building with a
electrcal divice and scan bar codes all around the complex.This one
night i was performing these diester patrols and i thought to my self i
feel good not tiried or sleepy i had my glasses on i then came to a
door leading to one of the sorting areas, i opened it, then i looked
up,seen a women in a old ,what looked like olds maids uniform, she then
looked up at me and disapeaered. i took note at the time that i was
wearing my glasses and was wide awake at the time. When i started at
this place i was a none believer of this type of thing but now , well
you be the judge, i believe a little more in the after life and
hauntings in genaral. I have alot more stories but it is late at night
and my spelling and story telling of this place are probley not what
they should be but if you want to hear more shot me an email. I do have
alot more to tell.<br>

he was wearing a flannel shirt with suspenders and carrying an old
fashioned lantern. my mom saw her grandfathers ghost walk out of the
barn and across the driveway. her grandfather and my grandfather died
in the same bedroom 40+years apart of massive heart attacks.they even
fell down dead on the same bed. also when were kids none of us kids

Haunted Houses<br>
<br>
By: Revruby@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
The house that we owned and lived in for 3 years on Park street in the
famous jungle district was built in 1926, and was said to belong to one
of Al Copones cohorts they used to visit the jungle grotto down the
street from the house it was a notorious restaurant, bar, house of ill
repute, and gambling house in the area at the time. It is still
standing. .It is the site of Saffron's restaurant, and several other
small businesses and some apartments now. That site has many amazing
stories.&nbsp; <br>
The house is a bugalow type with a large front porch, and windows all
around, In the day that it was built it was open to the gulf and built
so that the breezes could flow right through it.<br>
it is still standing. It is on a very historic neighborhood. The
property is on the Gulf.&nbsp; My house 320 Park St&nbsp; was in those
days an unusual house. The large freestanding garage had many, many
electrical outlets in it ??? in a day when that was very unusual. <br>
The upstairs and attic area frightened me so much I was never able to
stay up there for more than a very short while. I couldn't shake .the
feeling of being watched.and the fearful feeling no matter how hard I
tried.<br>
My family witnessed items flying across the room, unusual noises, a
table was moved right in front of my eyes, and my husbands eyes. Plants
were thrown out of window sills clear across the room., while the
windows were closed!&nbsp;&nbsp; My daughter&nbsp; saw an old man and
an old women standing by her bed and was so frightened that she moved
out! <br>
A little boy appeared at my door one day and asked me if I had ever had
unusual experiences there. I asked him what he meant, and I only
listened as he told me,{ this house is haunted you know}. He said that
he used to live there and described the same occurrences and the same
old man and old women in the same place that my daughter had seen them.
He wasn't afraid it seemed.&nbsp; As far as I know nothing bad ever
happened to anyone that experienced the things that went on there<br>
.It was an all together unusual experience. This is totally true and
accurate and made a believer out of my very skeptical husband, and some
of the people who visited the house. everyone seemed to want to stay
away.We began to accept the almost daily happenings as just the norm,
while we lived there and did not move because of them.<br>
I felt that the spirits were happy with me because I loved the house so
much I worked very hard on it and brought it back to life in so many
ways, but still they never seemed to want me upstairs. <br>

Haunted Residence<br>
<br>
By: greensleeves531@verizon.net <br>
<br>
I have knowledge of a haunted house in North Fairfield.&nbsp; I lived
there for several years.&nbsp; It is not haunted by an unfriendly ghost
by any means.<br>
The house was built in 1865, so it's seen alot of people over it's years.<br>
A man, Mr. Sutherland, haunts it I believe.&nbsp; He and his wife were
unable to have any children.&nbsp; They ran a rather large farm by
themselves.&nbsp; They would take in troubled boys in the area to help
them.&nbsp; At night, the boys would sneak out.&nbsp; Mr. Sutherland
started walking upstairs several times during the night to check to see
they were all in their beds.<br>
While I lived there, you could hear footsteps coming up the stairs and
going to the doorway of one of the bedrooms several times a night.<br>
There was also a time when my family went away and the dogs were tied
outside.&nbsp; When we got home, the dogs were inside the house.<br>

House on Middletown Road in Media Haunted<br>
<br>
By: BrownIdGrl75@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
The house I am referring to is now longer there now, it was torn down,
but used to stand right next the, I believe it is the Middletown
Baptist Church?&nbsp; I grew up in the house which its address was 32
South Middletown Road. I am 31 now and living in Virginia and my family
and I will still sit around and talk about all the strange and scary
things that happened in that house. I've tired to do research online,
to find out who had lived there previous to my family but have had no
luck. My family moved into the house in 1975 the year I was born. I
know that Riddle Memorial Hospital own the house and my parents rented
it from them. There where 5 of us kids, myself the youngest, I had 3
older brothers and 1 older sister, and I can tell you that we all had
things happen to us. To start it off, Mom told me that when they first
moved in, she was putting away groceries in the kitchen, she opened the
double door to the pantry and the previous owners apparently, left a
bottle of bourbon with a note attached to it that said Good Luck.&nbsp;
I can tell you that as clear as if it happened yesterday I can remember
being about 5 years old, and I always hated sleeping in my room by
myself because I would always here someone walking around in my room
playing with my toys. This one night as crazy as it may sound, I
remember laying in my bed trying to go to sleep, and as I drifted off
to sleep (whether this was a dream or not) I began to feel myself
levitate and float into each of the bedrooms upstairs, I remember while
doing this looking down and seeing my sister laying in her bed
sleeping, my brothers slept in the same room with a set of bunk beds
and a separate bed, and I can remember floating into their rooms and
seeing them, then floating into my parents rooms and seeing them
sleeping, then I came back into my room, came back down into my body
and immediately woke up. Now I know this all sounds crazy, but again I
had to have been about five, not on drugs nor any family members. When
I woke up I ran out of bed and went into my parents room and woke my
Mom up and asked to her to come stay in my bed until I fell asleep. I
remember her, half asleep coming into my bed, laying down and she fell
back to sleep. I snuggled up against her still scared to death about
what I just experienced, and while laying there, I could hear someone
walking around in my room and while walking it was like they where
shuffling their feet pushing my toys out of the way with each
step.&nbsp; I just pushed myself closer to my Mom under the covers and
made myself fall asleep,&nbsp; <br>
I can also remember, and everyone has said they have had the same
feeling, but there where two flights of stairs leading to the 2nd
floor. There was one set of stairs then a landing and then a second
set. Everytime we would be upstairs and start to walk down, you would
get such a strong eerie feeling that someone was right behind you
watching, so much that we all would get about four steps down and jump
to the landing and run down the second flight.&nbsp; My one brother
when he reached his teen years decided he wanted to make one of the
rooms located downstairs off of the living room his own bedroom.&nbsp;
Now you have to know my brother, he is the type that nothing scares him
and he's not afraid of anything, but even recently while talking about
the old house, he told us how on many nights when he would be trying to
go to sleep, he would hear people walking and talking across the front
porch of our house which was right outside his window, he said he would
get so scared he would just hide under the covers.&nbsp; My mom said
that one night while waiting up for my dad to come home from work, she
was in the living room watching tv, all of us kids where in bed
upstairs, (now before I tell you this part, there was a fireplace in
the living room and on the mantel above she used to keep little ceramic
animals, little deer figurines, a raccoon, rabbit etc. The one night
she was sitting there watching tv and she said all of the sudden the
porcelain raccoon flew off the mantel came shooting across the room
went right passed her head and landed on the floor behind the couch. I
can tell you that many nights I can remember laying in bed upstairs
trying to sleep and downstairs in the dining room I could hear dishes
clanging and silverware, like someone was setting the dining room table
up for dinner and you could hear people talking but could never figure
out what they where saying. Mom said that once all of us would go off
to school and she would be by herself in the house she would always
hear the back door open and close as if someone had just came in, she
would get up to look and no one would be there, this happened
frequently. She would also hear someone call her name or call her mom
and she would think that one of us came home sick from school or
something and when she would get up to check, again no one would be
there. <br>
&nbsp;I had moved my stuff into my sisters room which was where the
attic door was located and I can remember laying in bed hearing
footsteps upstairs in the attic, sometimes you would hear a bang as if
someone was up there and had dropped something, but everyone would be
in bed or downstairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can remember one night I was
upstairs getting ready for bed and while getting changed I felt someone
or something flip the back of my hair up, as if someone took their hand
put it on the back of your neck under your hair and just flipped it up.
The wild thing about this is one night we where watching some haunted
places show, and they where talking about a haunted Toys R Us, I forget
where it was, but this one cashier they where interviewing about what
happened to her said that while standing at the register she felt
someone take their hand and flip her hair up in the air. I was freaking
out, because sometimes you did go through moments where you would begin
to think you where just freaking yourself out or imagining things
because you where so scared, but when I saw that show I couldn't
believe it. <br>
We lived in that house until I was about 13 then we moved to Bucks
County, I cant remember how many years went by after we moved that they
tore the house down, but you can still see where the driveway was, I
think there is a rope going across it now where it used to be.&nbsp;
But it used to stand right beside that church.&nbsp; Like I said in the
beginning, I have tried to do research to see who lived in the house
before and if something bad or tragic happened, because there was
definitely something in that house, there was and still is no doubt in
my mind as well as everyone else in my family. I was reading the
different places you have listed on&nbsp; your site and one that stood
out was about Williamson Trade School. The reason is because, we had
about 1-2 acres with this house, all the way in the back yard the woods
started which we used to make trails through and ride our bikes,
especially in the fall with all the leaves, at the end of the woods on
the otherside was the fire trail, which I think now they have built a
nursing home back there, anyway, my brother and I used to right our
bike back through the wood, across the fire trail and we would ride all
the way back to where Williamson Trade School was, I remember this
because we where never supposed to ride that far and we where always
afraid someone from the school would see us and we would get in
trouble. Anyway, when I read about the hauntings at the school I
wondered if there was some kind of connection with who had maybe
haunted or lived in our house. You talked about soldiers who had went
to the school to recover. I dont know if there would be any connection
but you never know. I thought since the hospital owned the house I
would be able to find someone on it, but online Ive had no luck.&nbsp;
I have thought about taking a trip up there and going to the media
courthouse or library to try to look up the deeds and see if there's
any records on the house, I think that is going to be the only way to
find out anything, but finding the time to do so is another story. My
oldest brother still lives there, in fact just right down the street on
Mt Alverno road. Whenever my husband and myself go up to visit I always
make him drive me by where the house used to stand. Even though it was
the scariest house we have all ever lived in, we all grew up there and
had some great and good memories too. I still have dreams about the
house to this day, nothing bad just being in the house or dreams of
playing in the back yard.&nbsp; The picture of the inside of the house,
the back yard, everything is so vivid in my mind, its hard to believe
its been like 20 yrs ago. I dont mean to ramble on and on, but to read
your stories and see so many places close to our house that where
haunted or had unexplained things happen brought back memories. I also
remember the infamous house on Rose Tree Road that you wrote about. My
school but used to drive by that house everyday on the way to Springton
Lake Middle School. I remember when the house caught on fire and
watching on the local news. Anyway, thought you might be interested in
my story of our house and the things that happened. My mom has pictures
of the house if you are interested and if by chance you do any research
I would love to know what you find out. Again, theres no doubt in my
mind that house was definitely haunted.&nbsp; Its kind of funny because
the one side of the house, which you could never see from the road do
the huge holly tree&nbsp; and other trees blocking it, but we always
said that side of the house looked like the house from The Amityville
Horror, with the half moon shaped attic windows, etc. Anyway, I not
crazy, not making this up and if you would like more info I would be
glad to share it. Thanks for reading.<br>

My Fathers Experience<br>
<br>
By: darkemperor77@msn.com <br>
<br>
Hello, I just thought I would write and share the experiences my Father had while working overnight in an old school.<br>
Many of his experiences are incredible, as are those of his co-workers.
One time, him and another woamn were sitting in the break room waiting
for another of their workers to show up. It was late and this guy, Art,
wasn't there yet. They sat around for a while when suddenly they heard
very loud and violent noises coming from the locker room which is right
next to the break room. They said it sounded like someone was in there
tearing the room apart, and they actually though Art was there taking
his anger out on the lockers. But the only way into the locker room was
through the break room where my Dad and his co-worker sat. No one had
entered the room because they would have surely seen them if they had.
It creeped them out very much, to say the least, when they peekd into
the room and saw nothing destroyed and no one at all inside who could
have caused such a ruckus.<br>
Another time, when my Dad was standing in the schools gym, he felt
someone come up behind him and tap him on the shoulder. He thought it
was one of the other overnight workers, but when he turned around,
nobody was there. Art had also said he actually felt someone breathing
down his neck before in the gym.<br>
One of my Dads other co-workers told one of the strangest stories of all. <br>
She cleaned the auditorium regularly, and she would always see two
seats down, always both of them side by side. If she put them up, she
would leave and return shortly after, and two more seats would be down
again, and like before they would be side by side. They were not always
in the same areas either, but they were always side by side, as if two
sentient beings were sitting there expecting to watch a play on the
auditorium stage.<br>
There are many other strange goings on he experienced in his two decade
employment at the school. Everything from shadows moving at the end of
one of the hallways (not explainable by logical means, as I had been
there as a child and remember the place very well), to the sound of
someone sliding along the side of the brick wall right next to my Dad,
to a sturdy chair falling over on its own, as if pushed by a hand of
some sort, to strange presences following him around in one area of the
building, the list can go on and on really.<br>
I believe my Dad about all of these happenings, and I questioned him
thoroughly before I decided that his cases where truly paranormal and
very much beyond what we might call normal logic. I wholeheartedly
believe in ghosts and spirits and what-not, but I do know that things
must be approached logically and attempted to be explained by natural
means before the term paranormal is attached to them. But these
expereinces take the cake. There was something in that school with my
Dad and his co-workers all those years, and it wasn't part of the
natural "living" world, at least not anymore.<br>
Thank you for the opportunity to share these strange and awesome experiences.<br>
<br>

My Nightmare....<br>
<br>
<br>
By: DIAZA@wyeth.com <br>
<br>
Here's something that happened to me when I was about 14 or 15.&nbsp; I
used to buy these comic strip-type novels at the corner store about a
demon who disguised as a handsome prince took a beautiful young girl
and impregnated her - she had a son.&nbsp; These were a running series
and ever week I would rush over to get the next chapter.&nbsp; The
setting was medieval times and I remember there was a "righteous" man
who was after the "demon" or devil - whichever.&nbsp; Anyway, one day
my mom forbade me to buy them any more....she said it was not good
reading for a young teenage girl.&nbsp; You see, my mom was what&nbsp;
you would call a religious fanatic.&nbsp; I said to her, "Come on,
mom.....it's harmless......fiction for entertainment.....what's the big
deal?"&nbsp; She still forbade me so I started sneaking them.<br>
One night this is what I was told happened, though I have no memory of
it:&nbsp; I jumped out of my bed screaming to my sisters, "There he
is....RUN!!!&nbsp; There's the devil!!&nbsp; COME ON....RUN!!! HE'LL
GET YOU!!!!"&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
They told me I kept repeating this over and over and pointing to a
corner in my room.&nbsp; My sisters woke up and were freaked out of
course.&nbsp; This house had a history of unexplained noises and my
sisters were always claiming to hear things at night, especially
someone walking up the stairs when they both knew everyone in the house
was in bed for the night.&nbsp; One night I was up late with them and
we were giggling and acting silly the whole time, all in the
dark.&nbsp; We suddenly heard a really loud thud, like an iron hitting
the floor.&nbsp; All 3 of us girls froze.&nbsp; I mean, everyone was in
bed, we were also in our beds, just sitting carrying on, not walking or
running.&nbsp; The noise sounded like it came from downstairs and none
of us were going to check it out.&nbsp; <br>
Anyway, my&nbsp; mother and stepfather woke up and they came to our
room.&nbsp; My mother crossed herself when she heard what I was saying
and the look on my face.&nbsp; She grabbed me and started praying the
Our Father and Hail Mary while making the sign of the cross on my
forehead, until I calmed down and went back to sleep.&nbsp; Now, I know
what some of you may be thinking.....they made this up to SCARE me into
giving up the novels.&nbsp; And, you know what?&nbsp; You could be
right.&nbsp; But my sisters aren't good at pretending and I can assure
you that if that had been the case, at some point down the road, they
would have told me.&nbsp; My mother seemed genuinely freaked by it too
and mind you, she didn't know I was sneaking the novels...my sisters
and I didn't rat each other out, if you know what I
mean.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
So, what I believe happened may be that my conscious got the best of
me.&nbsp; But, what I don't understand is why would it have manifested
itself that way???&nbsp; I don't have a history of sleep walking or
talking - I'm now married 22 years and my husband has NEVER once told
me I sleep walk or sleep talk, so who knows.&nbsp; And, before that
night I never had anything remotely close to that experience.&nbsp; <br>
But, I'll tell you what.&nbsp; I ran back up to my room after breakfast
that morning and pulled out those novels from under my mattress and
threw them out!&nbsp; I was convinced something happened that night and
that was good enough for me.&nbsp; OH!&nbsp; One more "unexplainable"
thing that happened while we lived in that house.&nbsp; It was the late
70's ('78 or '79) and I went and chopped of my hair..it had been down
to my waist.&nbsp; For those that are my age...remember the "DA" hair
style and how it was popular with both guys and gals?&nbsp; Well I cut
my hair into a "DA" and it was a drastic difference.....people said I
looked much older.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had this neighbor that I was extremely
close with and I spend a lot of my free time in her house, chit
chatting and drinking coffee.&nbsp; One day (weeks after cutting my
hair) I came to her door and she gave me the weirdest look.&nbsp; I
asked what was wrong?&nbsp; She told me that morning she had seen me
looking out the window and she waved to me.&nbsp; The weird
thing:&nbsp; the girl she saw had long dark hair, like I used to.&nbsp;
My neighbor knew that the girl she saw was not me - and I had cut my
hair weeks ago!&nbsp; Neither one of my sisters had long hair
either.&nbsp;&nbsp; When she saw me that morning it suddenly hit her
and she was a little freaked.&nbsp; So was I.<br>
Anyway, just weird stuff.&nbsp; As I read stories on this site, I find
myself remembering little things from when I lived in that house.&nbsp;
I sent in a story about this house previously.&nbsp;&nbsp; Supposedly
someone had performed some witchcraft or whathave you and weird things
happened every once in a while, but not much directly to me.&nbsp;
Mostly my sisters.&nbsp; I think spirits feel sorry for me...they know
I would probably have a heartattack if I saw one!!!....(LOL!!)<br>

My Story, The beginning of my knowledge<br>
<br>
By: blubutterflywingz@hotmail.com <br>
<br>
I have a story for the Real Stories and Experiences section.<br>
My story starts in 1992 when I was 10. My family and I had just moved
to Kentucky on a military assignment. I had been quite used to moving
at this point, but the day that we looked at the house we later moved
into, I felt uneasy. All seemed normal until the next year, looking
back there were times when I was in the lower level of our home and had
felt like I was being watched, but never thought much of it.&nbsp; My
little brother was born that year and so my Dad refinished the garage
to make half of it a bedroom for me. <br>
That's when my problems started. Immediatly, there was something about
my closet that scared me to my core. My bedroom was set up so that you
walked into my room which was longer than it was wide, the closet was
immediatly on the right and my bed was on the far wall. I couldnt
explain it, I would get so scared walking past my closet, I would be in
tears at times. I started hearing noises, not voices but things moving.
I had a toy that when you press rather hard against its belly it would
start laughing and say "I love you", one night when I was laying in bed
reading the toy started going off, over and over. And my room got
really cold. I finally gathered the courage to grab the toy and run it
upstairs. My mom was sitting on the couch and I think the sheer terror
on my face scared her into believing me. It went off once more in the
trash can where it had been quickly thrown and my dad took the bag to
the trash bin immediatly.<br>
One night I had some friends over for a sleep over and we had a curtain
set up in the door way of the downstairs living room so that we had
some privacy. We all awoke late that night to sharp growling noises. I
had looked over at the curtain out of instinct, and about shrieked. It
looked like someone was sitting up against the opposite side, you could
clearly make out the shape of a back leaning against it. It moved a few
times, and the growling persisted. We finally got up the courage to
throw something at it and after making contact with it we heard a low
hiss and it moved. It took us probably a good 10 minutes to regain our
breath and go move the curtain. <br>
The house doors were still locked and everyone upstairs were sound asleep. <br>
We didnt sleep a wink that night.<br>
I kept finding things moved or missing in my room. One day I had a
neighbor over and we were watching tv while we waited for my family to
come back home. Suddenly the tv started flickering and then went off.
No sooner had we stood up to go see what was wrong than my bedroom door
slammed shut. We both screamed and dove for the couch.&nbsp; She looked
over at me and started nervously laughing, then my bedroom door creaked
a little and slammed shut even harder this time, then it did that over
and over again many times repeatedly. It finally stopped and we were in
tears at this point. I finally got my breath back and slowly took the
stairs to my room. The windows were all closed and there was no draft
or movement of air. I even closed the door to check the handle to see
if maybe that was the problem. But it closed fine and didnt give when I
pushed against it.<br>
One night while I was laying in bed watching the closet door, I had a
habit of that now, I saw the dark partially transparent form of an
older woman. <br>
She had very long thin fingers, thats what I remember most. I ended up burying my head and trying not to make any sounds.<br>
The day we finally moved out of that house, my dad and I were alone and
packing the last few things up. I heard my dad call out when I was in
the bathroom. I rushed into the kitchen that faced the stairway
downstairs to find him shaken. He looked at me like someone was playing
a horrible trick on him. He asked me if I had let anyone into the house
without his knowledge. I told him no. I thought he was going to
collapse right then. He told me that while cleaning the fridge he had
caught some movement out of the corner of his eye and had looked
towards the stairs, and saw an elderly lady, clear as day walking
hunched-over down the stair way and then towards my bedroom.&nbsp; I
freaked out and told him I had recently seen the form of an old lady in
my closet. We started talking about it and he told me, with much
regret, that he had sensed an evil presence in my brothers room which
was directly over my room, and had banished it from that bedroom.
Having sent it straight down into my room.<br>
I was very glad to leave that house, and have realized my "sensitivity" <br>
towards spirits now.<br>

Pleasant Grove Experience<br>
<br>
By: swazzdazz88@yahoo.com <br>
A few of my friends and i have been into ghost hunting for quite some
time now.&nbsp; About 3 months ago a friend of a friend knew of a good
place to look with some good history behind it.&nbsp; A barn in some
very disturbing backroads was caught on fire and the barn burned down,
along with the house that was attached to it.&nbsp; A girl small girl,
probably about 5-7 years of age, perished in this fire.&nbsp; A few
years later, the barn was rebuilt but without the house.&nbsp; It is
supposedly haunted by the little girl.&nbsp; The guy who told us about
the barn had a friend who went there broke a wooden step that leads
from the bottom part of the barn(where cows were kept) and died a few
months later.&nbsp; When my friends and I arrived here my one friend
also broke one of these steps and passed away recently. There is also a
rope that hangs in the main part of the barn that swings back and forth
constantly, almost looking like somebody hung themselves there.&nbsp;
Close to the rope there is a ladder leading up to a balcony like thing,
and one of my friends was in the process of climbing this ladder and he
heard a noise from up above and quickly retreated back down to the main
floor.&nbsp; After a bit more wandering around, we again returned to
the site of the rope and the ladder and a stick or something was thrown
from the balcony and hit the side of the barn.&nbsp; After that
happened we were a bit shaken up until it happened a second time,
almost like a spirit did not want us around the barn.&nbsp; After this
happened twice, we left the barn but plan to return in the near future
and i will have updates about it.&nbsp; <br>

The Bouncing Ball<br>
<br>
By: ms_lmartinez@juno.com<br>
<br>
In the month of November, 2000 I experience one of the most fighting
apparitions I have ever witnessed. It had been a cold night so I was
heavily covered with two thick fluffy blankets, and was surrounded by
about 4 pillows. One under my head, one that I hugged, one that I
hugged with my legs (I sleep on my side), and one that holds my back
for support all on a queen size bed. I had fallen asleep early, since
the days are shorter in the winter, and had been sleeping peacefully,
when suddenly my head bounced! I woke up, and felt as if I was on the
edge on my bed. I had no since of direction, whether I was facing up or
down or sideways. At first I was paralyzed, but I know this paralysis
was from the sudden wakeful state so I waited a bit till I was able to
move again. I was still on my side like I had fallen asleep. But I felt
I was on the edge of the bed, as if I moved an inch I would fall. I was
also aware of the felling of a presence standing at my side. Even
though I was still on my side I also realized none of the pillows I had
fallen asleep with were at my side. I rolled to my back and hit the
wall. I was still where I had fallen asleep at! I hadn&#8217;t moved! So I
reached out to grab my pillow, but it wasn&#8217;t there. I slowly made my
way grasping and groping for my pillows, until I hit the edge. That&#8217;s
when I realized something was weird. I remembered my head had bounced
as if someone had suddenly pulled the pillow from under my head! When I
put my hand on the floor that&#8217;s when the noise started. It was an eerie
bouncing right outside on the corner of my bedroom! It sounded like one
of those red balls from grade school bouncing on cement. But here&#8217;s the
weird thing. I live in a trailer in the desert; there is no cement on
the side where the bouncing was coming from! I grabbed my pillow which
was at the other end of the room and jumped into bed. I covered myself
from head to toe with my blankets; even though my head was covered I
could still hear the bouncing very clearly. I fallowed the sounds path
all along the side of the trailer from one end to the other and throw
the driveway and towards my grandma&#8217;s house. When I thought it was gone
I uncover my head and realized it went throw the air conditioning unit,
and the extra room we had just built! If I thought this was a hoax
before, I quickly realized it was the real deal. But just as I realized
it was real, the sound came back starting at the other end of the
trailer and working its way back to me!!! I grabbed my blanket and ran
down the dark narrow hall into my mom&#8217;s room, where my mom and niece
were sleeping. When my mom woke up and asked what was wrong I explained
what happened, and walked into the living room where I saw my dad
sitting on the sofa looking out the window. I didn&#8217;t have to ask him if
he heard anything, I knew by the look on his face that he had heard and
possibly seen it happen.<br>

when we heard something walking around upstairs me my brother dustin
and cousins domonic and nicki went up the stairs to see what all the
noise was,when we reached the top of the stairs we all saw red eyes
staring out of a hole in the wall we stared a minute or two and then
saw the red eyes blink scared to death my cousin nicki went down the
stairs,we stared at it for awhile not knowing what it was going to do
next until we heard something creaking upstairs we thought maybe it was
a ghost we saw a black figure and found out it was nicki again when we
looked back at the wall we saw nothing just the same old hole in the
wall but nothing else.ever since then we thought it was the ghost of
our great great grandma trying to talk to us or comfort us we then
stopped seeing the red eyes but,still heard footsteps all I know is
that we all loved the presence of our grandmother and will see her one
day in heaven.<br>

Schroeder Incident<br>
<br>
By: svr@centurytel.net<br>
<br>
Historical Marker- Father Baragass' Cross<br>
I heard that he was a missionary to the tribes in that region, and he
use to canoe up and down the shore with supplies for the local tribes.
But one day he tipped over and drowned and they found his body washed
up on the shore. I don't know if the memorial was resurrected near the
spot that he was found or not, but that would only make sense if that
was the case...well my Aunt and Uncle use to own a house about 100
yards or so from the memorial. Well my brothers and I use to play down
on the big rocks that you only find on the shore of Superior(we were
from the cities;), and of course we played around and on Father
Baragass' Cross too...only because we didn't know any better back then.
Well time passed by and in '81 I was at the house for a visit (I
was11years old at the time). And during this stay I slept downstairs in
my cousins room. His room was&nbsp; pretty cramped with two twin beds
hugged to the walls with a small walking isle between them...so one
night after falling asleep I woke up because my "sixth sense" was
tingling and it felt as if someone was either staring at me or too
close for comfort...so I reluctantly looked to my right (because to the
left&nbsp; was a wall;) and wouldn't you know it there was a face
looking right back at me, but at first I thought it was my cousin being
an A-hole, so I said; Jack-knock it off!! Well as I was repeating this
four or five times, each time the volume and panic levels were rising
as I noticed that it wasn't Jack's face staring back at me- for the
simple reasons that it had no hair (or very little), and that it seemed
to have a wound or blood on the right side of his forehead...and the
entire time that my volume was rising because I was taking this all
in...the face never change it's expression...just deadpan the entire
time. <br>
I get back home and told the story to my family and my middle brother
came back with that had happened to him also.&nbsp; Strange.<br>
Then later down the road when I was 23.<br>
I visited my relatives and this time I stayed upstairs (by
choice;)...in the room directly above the one where all the "fun"
happened...<br>
A wouldn't you know it...every night I woke up with that same feeling
around 3:13 am...every night. Needless to say I didn't wake up and scan
the entire room looking for my old friend.<br>
In fact, it got to where I would wake up with that stinkin' feeling,
and with my eyes closed I would reach up for the reading light, turn it
on, and then wait for things to subside...to me it was just a little
strange. <br>
&nbsp;I have a few more personal stories to tell, but they all happened
to and around me while I was stationed in Upper Heyford,
England...maybe someday I will pass a few on if your interested. <br>

Spook Light Hill<br>
<br>
By: shadowhunter_immortal@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
In mid march of 2006, me and my girlfriend went to spook light. We
drove north from Brazil on 59 N to Clay/Parke county line and turned
left. We came to the fork in the road, went left and got to the open
field where u turn around and stop at the big oak tree, close to the
2ND telephone pole from the turn around. There, i turned my car off,
flicked my lights 3 times and sat back. A minute later i told her it
should take like 10 minutes to see anything. As soon as I said that,
like about 10 seconds, up ahead a little under the horizon a glowing
ball of neon green went from he left side of the road and swiftly to
the other side and briefly saw it as it disappear. A minute later,
while i was wondering if i saw something or not, right then, some red
lights began gliding swiftly across the road, side to side coming
closer, but not too close it seemed. then the lights got faster, and it
lasted about 10 minutes. Now the green glowing ball, it was i have to
say, about 10 feet in diameter. The red lights were like tail lights,
but there are no roads there and it couldn't be a lazer light, we
would've seen he lazer line throught the trees. anyways after 10
minutes of it i started my car up and drove very fast to see if anyone
was messing around with us and there were no cars or trucks or
reflections or any signs that could've been mistaken for what we saw. A
green street sign does not glow and walk across a road! even tho the
street signs were out of veiw from where u should be watching from. And
SR 59 is not at all in view. Now, if the red lights were tail lights,
then there woud've been head lights. And that a vehicle could'nt of
done it with no headlights because the lights were going too fast and
we heard no vehicles at all. So basically, i saw what u are supposed to
see, plus, a green object. Now about the swamp gas, that area does not
have a lot of deteroriating wood or and very swampy areas to produce a
sight as we've seen.<br>

The Music<br>
<br>
<br>
By: anonymous<br>
<br>
Growing up, my grandmother always had an uncanny sense about when a
sick or aging person was going to pass away.&nbsp; I can always
remember how people joked about it but I never really understood it
until I drove her to see her last remaining aunt who was dreadfully
ill.&nbsp; She was eat up with cancer and going in and out of herself
when I heard my grandmother say, "Aunt Hazel, it won't be long now, I
can hear the music."&nbsp; It was the first thing that Aunt Hazel had
recognized in days.&nbsp; Thinking it was something she said to calm
her, I paid little attention and felt like I had eavesdropped on a very
personal moment.&nbsp; My great aunt Hazel died within 12 hours.&nbsp;
I heard her say it again to her mother just 12 hours before she passed
away as well.&nbsp; When her ex-husband was in ICU after a horrible
bout with cancer,&nbsp; she uttered those words again.&nbsp; Like each
time before, the hearer would pass away within 12 hours.&nbsp; Finally,
I had to ask her about the music.&nbsp; She told me that as a child,
her grandmother was always able to tell when someone's time on Earth
was nearing it's end because she could hear the music.&nbsp; Sometimes
the music was from Heaven and sometimes it was from a place much
further south.&nbsp; She smiled at me and told me not to think too much
of it, that after she was gone, I would understand.&nbsp; In 2003, my
grandmother passed away.&nbsp; During the last week of her life, I
stayed at her house; sleeping little while I waited.&nbsp; One night, I
heard the faint sound of music playing.&nbsp; Thinking it was a
neighbor's radio playing some lovely classical music, I ignored it and
went to sleep.&nbsp; A few nights later, I was stirred from my sleep
thinking that someone had left the radio on and it was going to wake my
grandmother.&nbsp; Futile, I searched the entire house trying to find
the source of this music.&nbsp; Another night, I was startled awake;
the music sounded like the orchestra was surrounding my bed.&nbsp; Each
time I heard the music, it was louder and more beautiful.&nbsp; On the
last day of my grandmother's life, I snuck into her room, kissed her on
the forehead and said, "Granny, it won't be long now.&nbsp; I've been
hearing the music."&nbsp; She smiled at me kissed my hand and I knew
that she was going to be okay.&nbsp; Ever since her passing, there have
been times when I have heard the music.&nbsp; Some is definitely from
Heaven and some from a little further south.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

*A Few Experiences*<br>
<br>
By: mhpayne78@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I have been reading many of the stories on your website over the last
few weeks and find it very intriguing. I have a few short stories I
would like to share which happened either to me or to someone I
know.....<br>
The first experience was one in which I experienced with a friend when
I was about 8 years old. My friend and I were in her upstairs bedroom
playing (it was nighttime, and she lived in an old house on a lot of
land) when we both saw two (almost ghoulish looking) faces appear in
the window. We freaked out and ran to another room in the house and saw
the same "faces" in another room's window. We then ran back to her room
and never saw them again but swear to this day that we both saw them -
we're both 28 years old now so it's pretty wild that we would both
remember such an event so vividly.<br>
Another experience that I had was when I was in like 9th grade. My
friend and I used to attend a nightly bible study once a week. Our
church had recently added a huge new sanctuary but still kept the old
chapel next door to it for other meeting purposes. About 10 years
earlier, a young boy (my parents even knew his parents) had died in a
car accident. Apparantly he used to love to play on the piano after
church when the chapel had cleared out on Sundays before he died. It
was rumored that after dark, one could often hear the tapping on the
piano in the old chapel even though no one would be seen there. So my
friend and I decided to check it out one night. We snuck into the back
room (where the minister would wait before walking out) and never told
anyone what we were planning to do. Before we could even open the door
into the church, we heard a light tapping on the piano - when I cracked
the door, the noise stopped and you could see no none. Talk about
spooky! (And sad, too, I suppose.)<br>
Another occurence happened to a friend of mine. He was part of a crew
of people who would set up a popular haunted house in what actually WAS
the oldest standing house (it was completely rickety and old as heck)
in our town every Halloween. Apparantly the house had two ghosts still
in it that were brothers. Wayne is a very nice, honest guy and I know
he wouldn't have lied about this. He was in the old house by himself
(no one else had arrived to help yet). He was in one room painting a
wall when he had to walk into another room for a second to grab
something. No less than a minute later, he walked back into the room to
find the ladder he had been using placed against the completely
opposite side of the room. After investigating, Wayne realized that he
was the only person there and booked it out of there until he could
have some other people there to meet him! Scary!<br>
Another experience happened to a lady in my sociology class in college.
She ran an old bed and breakfast in town which was once owned by an old
traveling medicine man from the early part of the century named Dr.
Bell - I think he had actually commited suicide in this house. It was
said to be haunted but the lady who was running the place at the
time(in my class) said she didn't believe in that stuff until one day
when she was in the kitchen making some pie. All of a sudden, she
turned to walk out when there in front of her stood this see- through,
yet crystal clear, image of Dr. Bell standing there. She dropped her
pie, looked up, and he vanished. She said that from that point on, she
was a believer. (I would be, too!)<br>
The last experience I would like to share happened to my friend's aunt
and uncle. (They were even featured on Oprah for it several years back
on some Angels and Miracles episode.) The two of them were hiking&nbsp;
along a place here in GA called Tallulah Gorge, where there is a huge
drop off. Her aunt lost her footing, grabbed her uncle, and the two of
them fell off the cliff. No one would normally survive a fall like that
being that there were no ledges or anything below where they fell from
to break the fall. They were both knocked out for a while, but then her
aunt awoke to find that she and her husband were lying safely on a
ledge, far from where they had fallen. Not one bruise on either of
them, and no one else around to see what had happened. When she looked
up, she saw (I believe it was a childlike figure - but I haven't heard
this story in years so bare with me) an image that she swears to this
day was their guardian angel. I believe in angels - so does my mom.
Back in 1982ish, my grandfather had his first heart attack. My mom is
very close to her dad and was about to have a panic attack waiting in
the hospital room for the news about my grandfather to arrive when
suddenly she said she felt what felt like someone hugging her and a
voice tell her "it's ok - everything is going to be ok" - she said she
felt instantly calmed, not scared. Moments later the doctor arrived to
tell her that her father was going to live. How awesome is that!<br>
&nbsp;I definitely belive in spirits and angels. I wanted to share some
of these short stories with you. Thank you for your time.:)<br>
