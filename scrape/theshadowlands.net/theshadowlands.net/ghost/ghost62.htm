<P>
<P><B>   I am glad to know that I am not alone with my "ghostly" experience.
When I</B>
<P><B>was five years old my family moved up to northern Michigan. Coming
from the</B>
<P><B>suburbs of Chicago, the wide open fields and forests were an exiting
change</B>
<P><B>for us. We moved into a 4-bedroom colonial house on 10 acres that had
been</B>
<P><B>empty for a year prior to our move. </B>
<P><B>Something about the upstairs of the house never sat well with me. I
would</B>
<P><B>never go up there alone. I always made my older sister accompany me.
There</B>
<P><B>were four bedrooms and a bathroom in the upstairs. My sister and I
each had</B>
<P><B>our own room, while my parents shared the master bedroom. My Aunt and
cousin</B>
<P><B>lived in the guest room for awile. Anyway, I always had to sleep with
a</B>
<P><B>nightlight on until I was ten years old. I would usually fall asleep
in my</B>
<P><B>parents room and they would carry me to bed in the night. One night
when I was six, I </B>
<P><B>woke up out of a sound sleep paralyzed with fear. I made myself look
at the door way</B>
<P><B> where I felt like</B> <B>somebody was watching me from. I saw a black
outline of a tall man </B>
<P><B>watching me. He was totally</B> <B>opaque and didn't move. He wouldn't
disappear. I opened</B>
<P><B> my mouth to scream but nothing came</B> <B>out. I put my covers over
my head until I got</B>
<P><B> enough courage to fly out of bed and run into my</B> <B>parents room.
My parents were very</B>
<P><B> understanding, even when it happened subsequent times.</B>
<P><B> When I got older (9 or 10) the pervasive feeling of terror I had at
night started to </B>
<P><B>lessen. I still</B> <B>never felt totaly comfortable in the house.</B>
<P><B>Last Summer when I was home from college, in a different house, my
parents,</B>
<P><B>sister, aunt and I started talking about the old house. It turns out
that</B>
<P><B>about once a month my parents would be wakened out of a sound sleep
by what</B>
<P><B>sounded like workboots tromping up and down the hallway. They thought
it was</B>
<P><B>my sister or me sleepwalking, but when they went to check on us we
would be</B>
<P><B>asleep. My aunt verified hearing the footsteps too. My sister said
one night</B>
<P><B>she woke up and saw a white mist in her room. My parents never told
us the</B>
<P><B>stories while we lived in the house, not wanting to scare my sister
and me. My dad said </B>
<P><B>that he</B> <B>told our neighbor at the time about the noises, and
the</B>
<P><B>neighbor told him about history of the house. A hundred years ago a
farm sat</B>
<P><B>where our house was. It had burnt down in a horrible fire. The
neighbor</B>
<P><B>mentioned that he thought that the old farmer, Mr. Cretchmeyer might
have died in the</B>
<P><B> fire. I</B> &nbsp;<B> remember planting trees with my dad and digging
up old bricks, so there is some</B>
<P><B> truth to the</B> <B>story. All I know is that after we moved from
the house I never had a</B>
<P><B> difficult time falling asleep</B> <B>or felt like someone was watching
me.</B>

<P>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B> I have sent you two stories before and </B>
<P><B>wanted to share another experience with you. Last March we held a 50th
</B>
<P><B>birthday party for both of my parents because their birthdays were
twenty days </B>
<P><B>apart. Two weeks later my father was diagnosed with cancer in his </B>
<P><B>throat. Two weeks after that my mother was diagnosed with breast </B>
<P><B>cancer.; Both kept positive outlooks and were told they were both </B>
<P><B>curable. My father started radiation treatment and the cancer all but
</B>
<P><B>disappeared.; My mother had surgery and the cancer was removed.; Two
</B>
<P><B>weeks after my father had completed radiation the cancer had returned
full force </B>
<P><B>and he was started on chemotherapy early. My mother started her </B>
<P><B>chemotherapy not long after him.They both lost their hair and took
turns </B>
<P><B>being sick. My mother had absolutely no problems and still doesn't.
</B>
<P><B>My father lost weight, became weak, and kept getting sicker from infections
</B>
<P><B>caused by low white blood cell counts. One Friday, November 13th, my
</B>
<P><B>father passed away after fighting this disease. The entire family was
</B>
<P><B>shaken and still has not gotten over his loss, especially my </B>
<P><B>mother. About a week ago I had an incredible </B>
<P><B>dream. I can recall walking down stairs and seeing my father standing
by </B>
<P><B>the door. I could tell you exactly what he looked like. He had his
</B>
<P><B>hair, neat but uncombed looking. He had his mustache that he was so
proud </B>
<P><B>of and he was wearing a blue sweatshirt with yellow writing. I believe
it </B>
<P><B>was a St, Louis Rams shirt because that was his favorite team. I know
this </B>
<P><B>because I used to tease him about it. His eyes sparkled and he smiled
at </B>
<P><B>me. It's taken a little time to remember all of the details, but it
seems </B>
<P><B>like he said something about still being here. After that I woke up.
</B>
<P><B>I can recall hearing the sound of someone descending the stairs and
thinking it </B>
<P><B>was nothing, then I realized I could hear my mother crying in her room
as </B>
<P><B>well. I got up and walked into her room and touched her shoulder. </B>
<P><B>Startled by me she threw out her arms and punched me in the mouth.
I have </B>
<P><B>given her a hard time about that since then. That evening I spent hugging
</B>
<P><B>her and listening.I told my friends about this experience and </B>
<P><B>one of them said that my dad probably knew my mom was upset and wanted
me to go </B>
<P><B>to her. There is a picture I drew posthumously of my day when he was
my </B>
<P><B>age and it sits on his dresser facing their bed. I don't know if anyone
</B>
<P><B>else has noticed but the expression on the picture seems to change
with the </B>
<P><B>occasion. When mom is upset in her room there is a sadness almost </B>
<P><B>apologetic look to it, but when the day is fine then it seems to have
a look </B>
<P><B>that says everything is alright. For the record, the picture was given
to </B>
<P><B>my mother not long before the dream.</B>

</H3><P><B>By: jcmiller@stlnet.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>In summer of 1960, when I was 7, my Mom, Dad, younger sister and I
went on</B>
<P><B>a driving vacation, from St. Louis, MO to Washington, DC.  From there
to</B>
<P><B>visit some family in Georgia.  In Washington, DC, we ran the normal</B>
<P><B>monument circuit.  I believe we saw every single one of them, which
I</B>
<P><B>didn't mind.  I enjoyed the whole thing. </B>
<P>
<P><B>We took one day to visit the White House.  When it was our turn to
enter</B>
<P><B>the building, we were at the end of the line.  The glass door was
locked</B>
<P><B>behind us by the secret service agents as the tour guide began to talk.
</B>
<P>
<P><B>There was a recessed wall in the hallway where there were personal
affects</B>
<P><B>that belonged to Abraham Lincoln, his roll top desk, one of his hats,
a</B>
<P><B>couple of coats on a coat rack, two chairs and a pair of shoes.  As
the</B>
<P><B>group made it's way to the Lincoln bedroom, which was down the hall
on the</B>
<P><B>opposite side of his personal affects, the end of the line, which is
where</B>
<P><B>we were, stopped immediately in front of his personal items.  Most
of what</B>
<P><B>the tour guide said I couldn't hear, so I just looked at Lincoln's
things. </B>
<P>
<P><B>As the group made way to go on, the hair on my arms stood up and I
got very</B>
<P><B>cold.  The group stopped at the end of the hall, showing the stairs
leading</B>
<P><B>up to the President's personal quarters.  All I could see was blank
walls,</B>
<P><B>so I went back to see more of Lincoln's things. As I stood there,
someone</B>
<P><B>came up to me and said, "Hello, young lady.  To what do I owe the
pleasure</B>
<P><B>of your company?".  As  I looked around, there was this tall man dressed
in</B>
<P><B>black with a hat and beard.  I told him of my family's vacation plans.
 He</B>
<P><B>thought it was nice that we were doing things together as a family.
 I</B>
<P><B>asked him why he was still in the White House.  He said it was to help
the</B>
<P><B>president's to come not make the mistakes that he made.  </B>
<P><B>He said I would not be able to understand the entire explanation. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I really don't recall word for word what we discussed after that, but
I do</B>
<P><B>remember that at one point he asked me if I was hungry, which I was.
 We</B>
<P><B>went back around the corner to the glass door (which was not glass
any</B>
<P><B>longer) where a bench was. (It wasn't there before.)  As we neared
it, he</B>
<P><B>reached into his pocket and pulled out a pocket knife and a red apple.
 He</B>
<P><B>began slicing off pieces of apple and we shared it.  (Now, I had always
had</B>
<P><B>a bad time with apple skin.  It would always get stuck in between my
front</B>
<P><B>teeth.)  Soon, my mom and a secret service officer were calling out
my</B>
<P><B>name.  I told Mr Lincoln that I was going to have to go.  He said he
was</B>
<P><B>having to go also.  He got up and walked out the door.</B>
<P><B>  </B>
<P><B>When my mom and the agent turned the corner, they asked where I had
been.</B>
<P><B>I told them I was tired and sat down, turning to show them the bench,
which</B>
<P><B>now was not there, now there was a heater.  I asked them if they saw
a man</B>
<P><B>dressed in black that was here with me.  My mom starting apologizing
to the</B>
<P><B>agent for my story.  She apparently did not see the look on the man's
face</B>
<P><B>of like, oh, no, not again.  He quickly said no harm done and suggested
we</B>
<P><B>resume the tour group.  My mom was scolding me as we walked back to
the</B>
<P><B>group.  I remember saying, "But, Mom, he gave me some apple because
I was</B>
<P><B>hungry." That just made matters worse, until we reached the group.
 I felt</B>
<P><B>something stuck between my two front teeth.  I asked Mom if she would
take</B>
<P><B>a look.  When we got it out, it was a rather large red piece of apple
skin.</B>
<P><B> It had been two days since I ate an apple of any kind. She was dead
silent</B>
<P><B>and said let's just go on.  Later, one of the agents approached my
mom </B>
<P><B>and dad to ask if they could talk with me a little.  They took me down
the</B>
<P><B>hall, within viewing distance, but not hearing distance, of my family.
 The</B>
<P><B>questions they asked, I soon got the idea that they knew I was telling
the</B>
<P><B>truth.  They told my parents not to be too hard on me, that they've
had</B>
<P><B>others supposedly see things.  They attributed it to the history of
the</B>
<P><B>house, people's imagination take hold.  And that was that.  I am now
46 and</B>
<P><B>over the years I have heard of others having experiences in the White</B>
<P><B>House, but I have yet to hear specifics. </B>

<P>
<P><B>We live in a house about 100 years old. My </B>
<P><B>parents got the house about 25 years ago from the man who built it.
We got the </B>
<P><B>house this last year. When I was a child growing up here I would frequently
hear </B>
<P><B>footsteps and see strange shadows out of the corner of my eye.When
my husband was</B>
<P><B> in the service during the </B>
<P><B>gulf was I moved home to have my second child. My oldest child was
2. One </B>
<P><B>afternoon he was napping in his crib upstairs. We had a baby moniter
and we </B>
<P><B>could hear him talking to someone. My mother and I thought he was dreaming
until </B>
<P><B>he started screaming. We ran to see what was the matter. He had himself
pinned </B>
<P><B>into a corner of the crib and kept pointing to the oppiste side of
the room. All </B>
<P><B>he would say was a man mommy a man.Needless to say I freaked out. My
mom took </B>
<P><B>him and started to ask questions. My 2 year old son sat and described
the man </B>
<P><B>who built this house and he ahd never seen him. He had died before
Anthiny was </B>
<P><B>ever born!! Nothing physical happened to him but we were all mighty
scared. We </B>
<P><B>told my Dad and he thought we were nuts. My Mom after this told me
and my sister </B>
<P><B>she had had some things happen to her. This was the first time we had
all talked </B>
<P><B>about it. Turns out all of us except my dad experienced things. We
decided to </B>
<P><B>have the house blessed and this seemed to work.</B>
<P><B>At least until my parents sold us the house. </B>
<P><B>After my husband and family moved in its started again. So far just
myself and 1 </B>
<P><B>son have had things happen. I love this house alot. We have many good
memories </B>
<P><B>here. But it can be very unnerving. Mr. Mattwick (our ghost) has actually
shown </B>
<P><B>himself to me twice. I passed out the first time. The second time I
politely </B>
<P><B>asked him to stop doing that becuse it scared me. He faded away right
before my </B>
<P><B>eyes!!!I have never felt threatened by him. It's almost </B>
<P><B>as if he's lonely where ever he is and whants to be a part of the house
he loved </B>
<P><B>so much. The thing is I'm worried about the kids and what </B>
<P><B>it will do to them. I know for me growing up it made me very nervous
and </B>
<P><B>skittish.If you have any comments mail me back. I's like </B>
<P><B>to hear from someone who doesn't think I'm crazy. </B>

<P><B> </B>
<P><B>It was December of 1995.  I had just moved to Maine to live with my
</B>
<P><B>mother.  I was 16.  Shortly after i moved in with mom, someone bought
</B>
<P><B>the building that we were living in so we had to move.  Being a small
</B>
<P><B>community, it was hard finding a place.  We called about a farm house
</B>
<P><B>that was in the paper.  We checked it out, and we liked it  and we
moved </B>
<P><B>in immeadiately.  </B>
<P><B> Upon our first day there.. i had to get ready to go to work.  So i
</B>
<P><B>quickly gathered some clothing and toiletries, and headed for the </B>
<P><B>bathroom.  I got it all ready and began to wash my hair.  As I was
doing </B>
<P><B>so, something grabbed me.  Scared half to death  I screamed, and my
mom </B>
<P><B>came running in to find out why.  When I told her she thought i was
a </B>
<P><B>complete nut and told me to get ready for work.  So I did.  </B>
<P><B>When I got home that night, I was the only one there..  and i heard
a </B>
<P><B>noise like a little girl crying.   It really freaked me out.</B>
<P><B>I called my best friend and begged her to come over, and I told her
why.  </B>
<P><B>She claimed to be able to talk to spirits. When she came over, the
</B>
<P><B>really weird stuff started to happen. The doors would open and close,
</B>
<P><B>lights would go on and off, the crying doubled and got worse.</B>
<P><B>She told me that she had a vision, and in that vision, she saw a trail
</B>
<P><B>of blood that went from the front roo. of the house, through the </B>
<P><B>kitchen, and into my room, and she said that my room did not look like
</B>
<P><B>my room, it looked like a bathroom.  The trail continued through the
</B>
<P><B>wall and into what was the coat closet now the bathroom.  She said
that </B>
<P><B>she felt two spirits in the house.  Thinking  that it was a good hoax
</B>
<P><B>put on by the landlord's son, did my homework and spent the night at
my </B>
<P><B>friends house.</B>
<P><B>After that we did not have much activity in the house until summer
came. </B>
<P><B>i was packing up to move again.. this time to an ever more hauted place.
</B>
<P><B>It was late at night, and it was hot. So i proped the window open with
a  </B>
<P><B>two inch thick stick.. and it was very sturdy.  My cat jumped into
the </B>
<P><B>window and yawled to get outside. And the stick in the window removed
</B>
<P><B>itself sending the window crashing down, almost killing my cat.  I
</B>
<P><B>freaked out.    </B>
<P><B>To this day the windows still come crashing down anytime that he sits
 </B>
<P><B>in them. Sometimes when it is late at night, you can hear a faint cry
 </B>
<P><B>that sounds like a little girl crying.  After that incident, I named
</B>
<P><B>them Melissa and Emily.  Emily being the little girl. </B>
<P><B>I have since moved away, my mother however still lives there. She later
</B>
<P><B>found out that what my friend said was true.  And that there were in
</B>
<P><B>fact two murders.  A woman and a little girl.  </B>
<P><B>If anyone can offer a decent explanation on why some spirits feel the
</B>
<P><B>need to bo a bit violent, please write me.</B>

</H3><P><B>By: MonicaDunlap@webtv.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I lived in Wilmington, NC for two years .  I lived downtown on south</B>
<P><B>sixth st.  The house we lived in was haunted I am for sure.  Many</B>
<P><B>strange things happened there.  Me, my sister and my husband ,who was
in</B>
<P><B>the marine corps, stayed together.  He was gone alot and my sister</B>
<P><B>worked alot so I was home alone most of the time.  I first felt this</B>
<P><B>house was haunted the day I moved in.  It just felt weird.  Lots of</B>
<P><B>little things would happen.   I would lay something down and come
back</B>
<P><B>and it would be gone and I would find it latter somewhere I know I
did</B>
<P><B>not put it.  I was in the kitchen one night and my husband was in the</B>
<P><B>living room and I felt something brush against my shoulder and it
felt</B>
<P><B>like a hand touching me.  I thought it was my husband, but when I
turned</B>
<P><B>no one was there.  While waiting for my sister to come home one night
so</B>
<P><B>we could go out, i got in the shower and I heard the front door open
and</B>
<P><B>shut and i expected it to be her coming in from work, so I called her</B>
<P><B>name ,no answer. I got out of the shower and walked through the house</B>
<P><B>and no one was in there.  The most frighting thng that happened to
me in</B>
<P><B>that house is I was up late reading one night and it got really late
 and</B>
<P><B>my dog was laying beside me and he got up and started growling and
this</B>
<P><B>corner then barking at it like someone was there.  I got him calmed
down</B>
<P><B>and he did for about a minute and then it happened again. I realized
how</B>
<P><B>late it was and decided to go to bed.  My husband had been asleep for</B>
<P><B>hours and I   had been laying in bed about five min. when I heard my
name</B>
<P><B>being called in the living room.  I thought I was just tired and
hearing</B>
<P><B>things.  Well again I heard my name and this time it was closer.  I
knew</B>
<P><B>I heard it this time but still thought I was crazy, then a minute
later,</B>
<P><B>It was a mans voice standing outside my bedroom and he said my name!!
 I</B>
<P><B>started screaming for my husband to get up and look around the house</B>
<P><B>because I thought some one was in there.  no one was.  we were alone.</B>
<P><B>Lots of other things happened to . Like pulling my hair, turning on</B>
<P><B>lights and turning them off.  we also heard people talking.  a man
and a</B>
<P><B>woman having an argument but you could never make out words and as
soon</B>
<P><B>as you got to the source, it stopped.  I could write more but this
is</B>
<P><B>good for now.</B>

</H3><P><B>By: Dmic19@webtv.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>hello I would like to tell one of the things I have experienced. One</B>
<P><B>night I took my daughter home it was about 2.30 a.m. on my way back
home</B>
<P><B>I looked into the side view mirror of my grand prix and to my extreme</B>
<P><B>horror I saw a black creature walking behind my car he was reaching
out</B>
<P><B>to touch my trunk he was about 9 ft. tall and totally black he had
no</B>
<P><B>face just a shinyhead all black. I was going 38 m.p.h. and he was
just</B>
<P><B>walking I ad the feeling if he touched my car I would die. He had big</B>
<P><B>black hands wth long claws  his feet came to a point no toes. he was</B>
<P><B>wearing a black smock type of thing it came to just above his knees.
I</B>
<P><B>sped up to 45mph but he was still walking behind my car I became very</B>
<P><B>terrified so I really put the hammer down finally he started to lose</B>
<P><B>momentum and I started losing him. I came around this corner at
pretty</B>
<P><B>high speed and I saw him catching up again I screamed my God here he</B>
<P><B>comes again so I floored it all the way and I could see I was losing
him</B>
<P><B>finally he was out of sight and I made it  home alive which I didnt</B>
<P><B>think would ever happen I was afraid to go to bed I had to keep the</B>
<P><B>light on all night I couldnt rid myself of the terror inside I felt
he</B>
<P><B>looked like something straight from hell I still think that.The next
day</B>
<P><B>I was setting outside at the picnic table thinking about the creature</B>
<P><B>and all of a sudden I realized it was not the first time I had ever
seen</B>
<P><B>him one year ago at the same time of night I was setting outside at
the</B>
<P><B>picnic table with a friend of my son and he said is that a man out
there</B>
<P><B>in the road? I stood up and looked and I said yes I think its a black</B>
<P><B>man so Rob screams what are you looking at the man said nothing so
Rob</B>
<P><B>repeated the question he still did not answer so Rob started running</B>
<P><B>down to the road and when he got almost there the man started running</B>
<P><B>and he ran up the driveway and across the yard behind the chicken
coop</B>
<P><B>pretty soon Rob comes running back up to the house he said you will</B>
<P><B>never believe this but I was just about close enough to bust him in
the</B>
<P><B>back of the head and he just vanished. He was very upset and I said
dont</B>
<P><B>be upset Rob you know my house is haunted its probably one of our</B>
<P><B>ghosts.He said maybe your right. But one week later Rob was shot in
the</B>
<P><B>head and killed at seven eleven. Besides being totally devestated by
his</B>
<P><B>death I was afraid the man he chased that night might have had
something</B>
<P><B>to do with his murder. So as I set there at the table I realized it
was</B>
<P><B>the same creature that chased my car. and I was filled with fear that
I</B>
<P><B>cant describe.He came back the next year again but I wasnt home that</B>

<P><B>Here is my story...One night about 4 months ago I was lying in bed,</B>
<P><B>and fitfully trying to sleep for school the next morning...all of the</B>
<P><B>sudden I felt my blankets press hard agaisnt my body, and a crushing</B>
<P><B>force was sitting or standing on my chest...I layed very still and</B>
<P><B>stopped breathing...I felt a very hot breathing on my chin and</B>
<P><B>neck...And I still layed there very still...I prayed for the thing
to</B>
<P><B>go away and after about 5 minutes it disappeared, but I was scared
out</B>
<P><B>of my wits...Another scary thing that happened to me, was me and my</B>
<P><B>best friend were in my room talking and all of the sudden this huge</B>
<P><B>deep gash appeared on her arm...She didnt say anything, but got up
and</B>
<P><B>took care of the gash...and suddenly after she left, I felt a burning</B>
<P><B>down my spine, and I called for my friend, and asked her to look at
my</B>
<P><B>back.  It was split from the nape of my neck to my lower back, and
had</B>
<P><B>even cut my bra strap in half...I freaked out and called the</B>
<P><B>ambulance.  When they came, the "thing" wouldnt let them in the
house,</B>
<P><B>or me and my friend out...We moved out of that house about 2 months</B>
<P><B>ago, and luckily "it" didnt follow me..</B>

<P>
<P><B>There are so many stories to relate that I barely know where to
start.</B>
<P><B>I suppose the best place would be the beginning. </B>
<P>
<P><B>My earliest memory of the paranormal occurred when I was 5 years old.</B>
<P><B>The house that we lived in was built for us, especially, so I don't
know</B>
<P><B>whether or not there was something there before the house was built,
or</B>
<P><B>if it was just a passing spirit.  I remember dreaming about a spirit
or</B>
<P><B>a snake talking to me, and this snake told me to open my eyes.  When
I</B>
<P><B>woke up, there was a glowing white skeleton-like apparition there,
and</B>
<P><B>it appeared to be bleeding.  I screamed, and it disappeared.  My</B>
<P><B>grandmother was sleeping in the bed next to me, and she did not see
or</B>
<P><B>hear anything.  My mother came into the room, and she tried to
convince</B>
<P><B>me that I had been dreaming.  I still don't know about that...</B>
<P>
<P><B>My second memory of the "other worldly" happened at a slumber party
on</B>
<P><B>my thirteenth birthday.  We had moved to a house on the other side
of</B>
<P><B>our small Oklahoma town, and had been living there for four years
before</B>
<P><B>anything happened.  On the night I am speaking of, I had about 7
friends</B>
<P><B>sleeping over.  We were all in the living room of the house, which
is</B>
<P><B>next to a spare bedroom.  This bedroom contained our family's piano,</B>
<P><B>some files, my mother's clothes (there wasn't room for them in her</B>
<P><B>closet upstairs in my parents' room), and a large fish tank.  While
we</B>
<P><B>were all trying to drift off to sleep, one of the girls happened to</B>
<P><B>glance into this extra bedroom.  She screamed and pointed, and we all</B>
<P><B>looked.  Every one of us saw a face floating in the tank with the
fish.</B>
<P><B>This was not a human face, however.  It appeared to be almost like
an</B>
<P><B>animal, or a reptile of some sort.  Needless to say, we didn't sleep</B>
<P><B>much that night.</B>
<P>
<P><B>To continue my story, later that year, a girl who lived across the</B>
<P><B>street came over to visit, and we were on the back porch talking. 
We</B>
<P><B>both looked in through the back door, and saw a pair of womens' legs</B>
<P><B>coming out of the stairwell.  The legs only went up to about the
knee,</B>
<P><B>and were wearing the kind of boots that they wore in the late 1800's,</B>
<P><B>early 1900's.  She left immediately, and I stayed outside until my</B>
<P><B>parents came home!</B>
<P>
<P><B>My grandfather died during my sophomore year of high school.  He
lived</B>
<P><B>in California, and my mother flew there to be with him.  My father
had</B>
<P><B>taken her to the airport, and I was home alone with my best friend,
when</B>
<P><B>all of the windows and doors started to shake and be knocked upon.
 This</B>
<P><B>lasted for about 30 seconds to 1 minute, then it stopped.  It
occurred</B>
<P><B>at about the same time my grandfather passed away, and I have always</B>
<P><B>believed that he was saying goodbye.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was 17, I was home alone, and on the phone with my best friend</B>
<P><B>when I heard my front door open, then shut.  I then heard someone run</B>
<P><B>through the house and out the back door.  While we were still on the</B>
<P><B>phone, her mother got on the other extension in their house and
called</B>
<P><B>the police.  When the police came, I went downstairs only to find
both</B>
<P><B>doors locked from the inside, and a total mess on the first floor.</B>
<P><B>Laundry had been thrown around, dishes knocked off the cabinets, and</B>
<P><B>things generally tossed all around the downstairs rooms.  The police</B>
<P><B>looked around the house and grounds, found no sign of forced entry,
and</B>
<P><B>left, promising to watch the house for the rest of the night.</B>
<P>
<P><B>But wait, there is more!  When I turned 19, I moved to Philadelphia.</B>
<P><B>(Not with my parents, just me.)  I lived with roommates in several</B>
<P><B>apartments until I was 23.  At that time I moved into a one-room</B>
<P><B>apartment above a bar.  This was about one block from my boyfriend's</B>
<P><B>house, and my boyfriend's father found the apartment for me.  My</B>
<P><B>apartment was the only one in the building, and I was the only one
with</B>
<P><B>a key.  Several times I would hear the door downstairs open and shut,</B>
<P><B>and then someone come up the stairs and open the door to my
apartment.</B>
<P><B>But the door was always closed, and there was no one there.  One night
I</B>
<P><B>woke up to see a man hovering at my bed with an almost maniacal smile
on</B>
<P><B>his face, and his hands raised as if to grab me or choke me.  I
jerked</B>
<P><B>away and he disappeared.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Meanwhile, back in Oklahoma...</B>
<P>
<P><B>Most recently, in my parents' house, my aunt and my brother were home</B>
<P><B>with my mom.  My brother was asleep, and he heard someone come into
his</B>
<P><B>room, and then open his drawers on his dresser and close them, then
open</B>
<P><B>the door and gointo his closet and shut the door.  He looked, and saw
a</B>
<P><B>woman's form, and he assumed that it was my mother.  My brother's
room</B>
<P><B>is the room that I had while I was home, and I remember my mom always</B>
<P><B>came in to put things away on Saturday mornings while I was sleeping</B>
<P><B>late.  But, the form never left the closet.  While this was happening
in</B>
<P><B>my brother's room, my aunt looked up the stairs, and saw a woman walk</B>
<P><B>across the hallway and into my parents' room.  She also assumed it
was</B>
<P><B>my mother until my mother came in from outside a few minutes later.
 My</B>
<P><B>aunt had been sitting at a table at the foot of the stairs, and she
knew</B>
<P><B>that my mother had not come down the stairs.  My mother was not in
the</B>
<P><B>house at all when these things occurred at the stairs and in my</B>
<P><B>brother's room.  You have to go through my parents' room to get to
my</B>
<P><B>brother's room.  The house was built on the site where a church
burned</B>
<P><B>down about 100 years ago.  The house is about 85 - 90 years old  This</B>
<P><B>makes me wonder if my mom was the only one putting things away in my</B>
<P><B>room all those years...</B>
<P>
<P><B>About a year and 1/2 ago my boyfriend and I bought a house.  No</B>
<P><B>occurrences so far, but you never know.... </B>

<H3><B><A NAME=dream> A Ghostly Dream</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:  ann.russell@worldnet.att.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Although I've experienced a number of </B>
<P><B>supernatural occurrences, this ghostly dream was one of the most upsetting
for </B>
<P><B>me. It happened quite a long time ago--in the spring of 1977, I </B>
<P><B>think.</B>
<P><B>      I was a young divorced Mom who had gone back to </B>
<P><B>college to earn a master's degree and teaching certificate.&amp;nbsp;
I was living </B>
<P><B>in family housing at the University of Michigan and doing my student
teaching at </B>
<P><B>a nearby middle school. Like most teachers who are genuinely interested
in </B>
<P><B>their students, I came to know the details of many of my students'
lives.</B>
<P><B>One fourteen-year-old boy in my Reading class had had a particularly
difficult </B>
<P><B>time, having lived in various foster homes. He was currently living
in a </B>
<P><B>group home but hoping that his family would resolve their problems
and reunite </B>
<P><B>one day in the near future.</B>
<P><B>       Tony used to stop by before class fairly often </B>
<P><B>to kid around with me or tell me about interesting things and people
in his </B>
<P><B>life. One day, just before spring break, he rushed up to my desk, </B>
<P><B>obviously excited. I'll bet I'm gonna have a better spring break </B>
<P><B>than you! he said.Everybody at our group home's gonna take a </B>
<P><B>bus trip down to Florida. We're going to Disney World! I joked </B>
<P><B>with him about how he would have it all over me.--I'd be staying in
town, </B>
<P><B>catching up on studying. I was really happy that Tony had something
to </B>
<P><B>look forward to, but didn't think about his trip beyond that day. Spring
</B>
<P><B>break started, and I was busy with my own concerns.</B>
<P><B>        One morning during spring break, I couldn't seem </B>
<P><B>to rouse myself completely in order to get out of bed and fix breakfast
for my </B>
<P><B>son. Instead I kept drifting off to sleep. As my preschooler gave up
</B>
<P><B>his attempts to wake me and went off to find the cereal himself, I
had a </B>
<P><B>strangely vivid dream--so lifelike that I believed I was actually
experiencing </B>
<P><B>it. I was standing inside a moving bus, a bus filled with children.</B>
<P><B>Because I was at the very back, I couldn't see anyone's face, so I
didn't know </B>
<P><B>who the children were. Suddenly the bus veered off the road and headed
for </B>
<P><B>a tree. I could see the impending accident but could do nothing about
it. </B>
<P><B>I heard screams and felt the impact.</B>
<P><B>       Next I found myself standing on the grass at the </B>
<P><B>side of the road. People who had been injured in the accident were
lying </B>
<P><B>on the grass in front of me, while rescuers worked to treat their </B>
<P><B>injuries. It was a horrible scene. I was upset, and was </B>
<P><B>crying.Just then, someone came up to me. Although I couldn't see </B>
<P><B>his face, I realized that I knew him from somewhere. He seemed to have
two </B>
<P><B>friends with him, who stood a bit apart from him, waiting while we
talked. </B>
<P><B>The person I couldn't quite recognize comforted me, repeating again
and again </B>
<P><B>that things were all right now, that everyone was okay, the tragedy
</B>
<P><B>was over.Gradually he helped me to feel at least a bit more calm, more
</B>
<P><B>accepting of what had happened.</B>
<P><B>          Then he started to move away. </B>
<P><B>Wait! I called.Don't go! I don't know who </B>
<P><B>you are. He turned back toward me, just for an instant, with a </B>
<P><B>friend standing on either side. I sensed that he was revealing his
</B>
<P><B>identity as a favor to me, but that he had somewhere else--somewhere
</B>
<P><B>important--to go. And in that split second I did recognize him: The
</B>
<P><B>husky build, the bright red hair and freckled face.--Tony! I </B>
<P><B>said. He flashed me a beautiful smile. I became briefly aware that
</B>
<P><B>his two friends were slightly-built African American boys, somewhat
younger than </B>
<P><B>he. All three were looking at me intently. Once more, Tony reassured
</B>
<P><B>me:We're all right now. Then they were </B>
<P><B>gone.</B>
<P><B>        I awoke from my dream thoroughly shaken up, but </B>
<P><B>kept telling myself that it had just been a nightmare, not a real </B>
<P><B>occurrence. I couldn't comfort myself with that for long, though, because
</B>
<P><B>later that day the phone rang. It was my critic teacher (my supervisor
for </B>
<P><B>student teaching).Through sobs she told me about the terrible accident
in </B>
<P><B>which Tony and two other boys from the group home had been killed.</B>
<P>
<P><B>               There was an open-casket funeral in nearby </B>
<P><B>Ypsilanti for the three boys. I attended, paying my respects to Tony--and
</B>
<P><B>to two younger boys, slightly-built African American children whose
faces I now </B>
<P><B>recognized.</B>
<P><B>        I don't think I'll ever quite get over the shock </B>
<P><B>of that dream; but at the same time, I understand that it was an important
</B>
<P><B>experience. I'm convinced that Tony came to me in this dream not only
to </B>
<P><B>say goodbye but also to reassure me that people do exist after death,
and that </B>
<P><B>they can go to good places. </B>

<H3><B><A NAME=story>Christopher's Story</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:	coolerboy@sprint.ca </B>
<P>
<P><B>  In 1969 my parents left Toronto. Ontario for a rural community on
the other side of the province.  It was a classic case of culture shock for
my brother and two sisters. I was 3, so life there came naturally and I grew
up a typical small-town farmboy.  In the mid-70's, the summer after I finished
Grade 4, my parents bought a new house in a different part of town.  It was
a cheery-looking yellow brick home that dated back to the 1800's. It'd been
kept in good shape for its age, only it was just too</B> <B>big for us. 
By that time, my brother and one sister had moved out and had been living
on their own for some time. The sister</B> <B>had married and moved away.
My brother had married that same year.   So my dad divided the house into
a duplex and we</B> <B>lived on one side and my brother and his new wife
had the other. </B>&nbsp;<B>  All that summer I thought myself lucky because
my room stayed comfortably cold no matter how hot the weather. My parents</B>
<B>thought it odd, because it was an upstairs room. Even when the rest of
the house was like an oven, it was always bordering on</B> <B>chilly in my
room.  Come that first winter, however, I quickly changed my tune: It was
freezing in that room! I shivered all night,</B> <B>every night, no matter
how many extra blankets I had. I actually slept in my snowsuit some nights
and was cold even then.My folks figured it had something to do with that
room being at the end of its own short hallway. -For some reason the heat</B>
<B>just wasn't circulating from the rest of the house.  So I was duly instructed
to never close my door except when changing butit didn't help things any.
 The heat register was beside the closet door and I took to opening that
door hoping to deflect some</B> <B>heat towards my bed. It seemed like a
good idea at the time, only it didn't work in practice. &nbsp;  At some point
that winter, we had company come for several days. I remember going to bed
and grumbling to myself because</B> <B>all the lights upstairs were left
on so our guests could find their ways to their rooms later on. The light
was keeping me awake;</B> <B>as was the sounds of conversation and laughter
echoing up the stairwell from downstairs.  Soon after there was a lull in
the</B> <B>sounds from downstairs and that's when I heard it.</B> &nbsp;<B>
  ...The sound of slow, stealthy footsteps approaching my bed.  The floor
was hardwood, yet it sounded like someone shuffling</B> <B>their feet across
carpeting. I heard each measured step and even the creaking of the boards
underfoot.  Only, in the light from</B> <B>out in the hall, I could see no
one there.  At first I was puzzled, then it sunk in that in another few moments
whatever it was </B>&nbsp;<B>would be between my bed and the door. I panicked,
and took off downstairs screaming. I'm told it took a good 3 hours to calm</B>
<B>me down.  And even then, I refused to go back up to bed.  I do remember
spending the rest of the night on the couch, all the lights on, and me wide
awake till dawn.  The adults didn't believe me so I learned to keep my mouth
shut lest they think me</B> <B>crazy. And that decision made it like it was
open season on me or something.  After that first incident, I always felt
eyes above</B> <B>and behind me, looking down from the corners of the ceiling.
 Things would go missing or be moved. I was a fair artist and an</B> <B>avid
reader. -Pens I'd literally just put down for a second would disappear. Books
would vanish and reappear in other parts of</B> <B>the house, sometimes months
later. I'd hear my name called or catch flickers of movement out the corners
of my eye. After dark</B> <B>was the worst. I was scared to sleep, scared
of not knowing what was going on around me, not knowing why no one else seemed
to experience the things I was. (*They were, but that was kept from me so's
not to frighten me. Like I could have been</B> <B>any MORE scared than I
already was!)  I kept that closet door shut and locked but that didn't help
much either.</B> <B> Eventually, my dad renovated my sister still living
at home took that room. Me, I was just glad to be out of it. </B>&nbsp;<B>
 By the time I got into highschool, the strange going's on had become second
nature. I began dating a wonderful girl and </B>&nbsp;<B>being a lovestruck
fool, managed to all but forget about the haunting.  Only it hadn't forgotten
about me....  One night in the summer of '86, my girlfriend and I had the
house to ourselves. We were snuggled on a loveseat in the living</B> <B>room
watching videos. She observed that it was really cooling down outside, because
she felt a cold draft. I felt fine, but took</B> <B>it as an invitation to
cuddle closer.  A few minutes later, she complained she was freezing so I
went to get up to start closing</B> <B>windows. I asked her where she felt
the draft coming from and she gestured towards the couch and we both glanced
over at</B> <B>the same moment and I felt every hair on my head go up.</B>
&nbsp;<B>-For there, on the couch, one of the cushions was sagged right down
as if under the weight of a full grown adult. The spot was</B> <B>exactly
underneath where the closet was in that small upstairs room. She ran for
the door and I was right on her heels.  She</B> <B>didn't stop for 3 blocks
and nothing could convince either of us to go back in the house after I confessed
some of the other</B> <B>things I'd experienced since moving there.  We hung
around across the street for 2 hours till my parents got home and even
</B>&nbsp;<B>then she wouldn't go back inside. She was still so upset that
my dad drove her home.  On the way back, I was lectured about</B> <B>renting
scary movies but the tape we'd been watching was Eddie Murphy-Delirious,
a stand-up comedy video. I tried to explain</B> <B>that, but one look from
my dad told me he was in no mood for backtalk of any kind. So I shut up and
let it slide.</B> <B> My girlfriend stayed with me despite her scare. I thought
for sure she'd dump me. A year later, we were out of school and</B> <B>engaged.
I was the last child still at home. My other sister had married and moved
away back when I was still in public school</B> <B>and my brother had moved
to another town because of his work. Since I was leaving soon anyway, my
parents felt the time</B> <B>was right to sell.  They bought themselves a
bungalow across town and in August of '87, my fiancee and I helped them
move.</B> &nbsp;<B>  There was a pretty severe heatwave that summer. High
temperatures, high humidity and violent thunderstorms almost nightly</B>
<B>that only seemed to make the humidity worse.  We took our time with the
move because of the weather. On the last day, my</B> <B>dad asked us to go
back and take one last good look around to make sure nothing had been forgotten
and left behind and</B> <B>then to make sure the place was securely locked
up.  We did so and then popped around the corner to a variety store for</B>
<B>cold drinks.  That day was the worst thus far, weatherwise.  The sky was
cloudless and it was utterly calm and still without eventhe slightest breath
of wind.  Despite all that, we were joking about what my dad had said about
not forgetting anything. We giggled that we had, and on purpose too.  Namely,
the ghost or entity or whatever the invisible being was.  We were just</B>
<B>walking past the old house when all this was being said and we looked
over, and felt the smiles get wiped right off our faces </B>&nbsp;<B>because
the aluminum storm door was opening ever slow slowly.  It kept going till
we s aw it could open no further and it began</B> <B>to swing shut just as
slowly.  My fiancee and I just stood gawking until, just before it closed,
it slammed the rest of the way</B> <B>shut.  That bang was like a starts'
pistol in a race: We started running.   I mean, it's one thing to experience
something at night</B> <B>and then rationalize some explanation by the clear
light of day.  But to see THAT, in the middle of the afternoon on a sunny</B>
<B>day was all just too much.  We didn't stop till we got to my parents'
new place and then worried that the ghost might've</B> <B>followed us there.
-In fact, it very well may have.  My mom was alone in the house a week later
when she thought she heard</B> <B>her name being called from the basement.
 She was half way down the steps when something pushed her from behind. 
She went right to the bottom, but got off lucky with only scrapes and
bruises.</B> &nbsp;<B>   That experience did it. When my one sister heard
of it, she confessed her own encounters in the old house, as did our</B>
<B>sister-in-law. (They'd seen the ghost standing in the closet of that upstairs
room early one morning.)  I shared mine, and my</B> <B>fiancee vouched for
the things that'd happened to the both of us.  My dad finally admitted that
he'd known all along about</B> <B>2 deaths in that house.  One had been a
girl who'd fallen over the upstairs railing to break her neck on the stairs.
We wondered</B> <B>if she'd been pushed, like our mom had.  The other death
was a suicide. An undertaker had owned the house at some point</B> <B>and
hung himself in that very closet. He seemed the  prime candidate for all
the weird goings-on. None of us knows for sure.</B> <B>  The last of these
events happened over a decade ago. Lately, my wife and I have talked seriously
about moving back to</B> <B>that town.  Only it's the memories that's holding
us back right now.  Perhaps the time has come for a reckoning. Maybe the</B>
<B>spirit left, as the new owners seem happy enough. They've put a lot of
work into renovating the grounds and exterior.</B> <B> So maybe it's safe
to go back to town again.  Or maybe it isn't. And that's what we're afraid
of finding out....</B>

<P><B>early in the morning my sister woke up to bone-chilling screams coming
from</B>
<P><B>the den.  She grabbed the heaviest thing she could find--intent on
knocking</B>
<P><B>the crap out of whoever had broken in and was scaring her friends.
 When she</B>
<P><B>got downstairs she threw the light switch on and found her friends
cowering in</B>
<P><B>the corner, paler than anyone should ever be.  After some prodding,
she got</B>
<P><B>them to tell her that there had been something floating above the door
frame.</B>
<P><B>They said that it had red eyes and that it wiggled and jiggled around
the</B>
<P><B>ceiling up until the point when she turned on the light.  At first
we thought</B>
<P><B>that someones brake lights had reflected into the room somehow, but
there was</B>
<P><B>no way that a car could have gotten near the back windows.  The rest
of my</B>
<P><B>family pretty much dismissed the idea as a hoax, not that the girls
had</B>
<P><B>deliberately made it up, but that they saw some sort of reflection.
 </B>
<P><B>I didn't really think much of it until one weekend when I went home
to visit.</B>
<P><B>I rolled over in my bed and saw two red eyes staring at me.  I didn't
really</B>
<P><B>know what to do.  They were about four or five feet away from me,
floating</B>
<P><B>along the wall.  They were only about three feet off the floor, much
lower</B>
<P><B>than the first sighting.  I figured that either the thing was going
to mess</B>
<P><B>with me or leave me well enough alone, so I opted to just close my
eyes for</B>
<P><B>awhile and see what happened.  When I opened them a few minutes later
it was</B>
<P><B>gone.  </B>
<P><B>No one has seen the ghost since then.  I'm pretty sure he's still there
and</B>
<P><B>has been there much longer than we realize.  As a child many
unexplained</B>
<P><B>things happened, mostly in my room.  Radios would turn on/off, lights,
etc.</B>
<P><B>At least it doesn't hurt anyone!  </B>

<H3><B><A NAME=shadow>The Impossible Shadow</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By: jallanderson@compusmart.ab.ca</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have had several </B>
<P><B>brushes with the supranatural during my life (No, that wasn't a typo
-- I </B>
<P><B>believe the word supranaturalis more accurate than </B>
<P><B>supernatural.) However, the one incident -- the second </B>
<P><B>encounter with the unknown -- is the one that stands out in my mind
clearest of </B>
<P><B>all. I was about four or five years old at the time (some may say that
</B>
<P><B>that taints my account, but I know what I experienced, and recall it
very </B>
<P><B>clearly). It was a saturday morning, the sun shining brightly. I was
</B>
<P><B>in the habit of getting up early to watch the saturday morning shows.</B>
<P><B>(This would have been 1968 or '69, if you should be wondering.) We
lived </B>
<P><B>in a small trailer, at the time, on my paternal grandparent's farm;
to get to </B>
<P><B>the living room, where the t.v. was, I had to pass through my parent's
bedroom </B>
<P><B>and the kitchen/dining area. My parents were still asleep. I had </B>
<P><B>crossed about halfway through my parent's bedroom (so I was then standing
at the </B>
<P><B>foot of their bed), when I saw the entity. There was a combination
china </B>
<P><B>cabinet and storage cabinet separating the kitchen/dining area from
the living </B>
<P><B>room; a counter space of about one and a half to two feet separated
the </B>
<P><B>two elements (the china cabinet was suspended/supported above the storage
</B>
<P><B>cabinet). Upon the storage cabinet sat a figure, entirely a featureless
</B>
<P><B>black, like a silhouette. It was shaped like a skeleton sitting </B>
<P><B>cross-legged upon a rocking chair runner, its hands gripping either
end of the </B>
<P><B>runner, and it rocked slowly, rhythmically from side to side. Although
I </B>
<P><B>could see no features, I was certain it not only faced me, but was
aware of </B>
<P><B>me. Over the years, I have thought long and hard about this encounter,
</B>
<P><B>trying to define exactly what I sensed, or felt. It seemed as if wave
</B>
<P><B>after wave of -- for lack of a better way to describe it -- power was
washing </B>
<P><B>against me, much like ocean waves wash against a cliff. (For years,
I </B>
<P><B>thought of it as waves of evil, but I have long since decided that
I was putting </B>
<P><B>cultural values upon something that cannot be properly classified within
such a </B>
<P><B>context. All that I can honestly say is that it was the property of
</B>
<P><B>something non-human; therefore our cultural values are not applicable.)
</B>
<P><B>Curiousity and terror warred within me. Terror at last won, and I got
down </B>
<P><B>on my belly, instinctively trying to make myself hidden. I could not
tear </B>
<P><B>my eyes away from the apparition, but was too scared to keep looking.
My </B>
<P><B>father's cowboy hat happened to be close at hand (as were all his clothing;
he </B>
<P><B>always dumps his clothes on the floor), so I clapped that over my eyes.
I </B>
<P><B>do not know how long a time I stayed like that, but curiousity once
again </B>
<P><B>overrode fear, and I snuck a peek. It was gone, and so was that peculiar
</B>
<P><B>wave-like sensation. With the amazing powers of a child to take anything
</B>
<P><B>in stride, I got up, and proceeded into the living room (passing right
by its </B>
<P><B>perch), and watched my morning shows as if nothing had happened. I
call </B>
<P><B>the apparition The Impossible Shadow for good reason; the front </B>
<P><B>windows, full sunshine pouring through the sheer white curtains over
them, were </B>
<P><B>squarely behind the figure, and therefore it existed where no shadow
had any </B>
<P><B>business existing.</B>
<P><B> I have puzzled over this </B>
<P><B>encounter ever since. To this day, I have no real idea what it was
I </B>
<P><B>beheld that sunny saturday morning long ago. I do know that I have
had the </B>
<P><B>priviledge to witness something that few others, if any, have ever
seen. </B>
<P><B>It may be totally unconnected with that experience; it may even be
the reason </B>
<P><B>why I had had that encounter; or it may be the result of that encounter;
but I </B>
<P><B>have always had a sensitivity, since, to the presence of death. Sometimes
</B>
<P><B>I fancy that on that long ago morning, I may in fact have seen death
</B>
<P><B>him/herself. Though why he/she should have chosen to appear to me is
</B>
<P><B>beyond my poor powers to understand -- if indeed it was death I saw.
(I do </B>
<P><B>have reason to entertain that notion, beyond a mere senstivity to death's
</B>
<P><B>presence, but that's another story, taking place at a much later </B>
<P><B>time.) If you have even the </B>
<P><B>foggiest notion what it was I encountered that morning, please let
me </B>
<P><B>know. I can be contacted at jallanderson@compusmart.ab.ca</B>
<P><B> I have not heard of, or read of, anything quite like this entity,
and I </B>
<P><B>often wonder if anyone else has seen such a thing -- or if it may possibly
have </B>
<P><B>been an extraordinary display of my senses playing tricks on me (my
other </B>
<P><B>encounters with the supranatural notwithstanding).</B>

<P><B> </B>
<P><B>When I was little we lived with my grandmother in her house.  My
younger</B>
<P><B>sister and I</B>
<P><B>shared a bedroom.  I never slept with the doors shut ( our room had
two</B>
<P><B>doors).  I always felt uneasy in the room.  I remember one night hearing
the</B>
<P><B>sounds of someone walking in the room we had wood floors and I felt
the</B>
<P><B>presence of someone. Not wanting to get in trouble for not being asleep
I kept</B>
<P><B>my eyes closed. When it seemed as if the person was standing next to
the bed I</B>
<P><B>opened my eyes.  There was no one there and I felt scared to death.
 Not to</B>
<P><B>long after that I woke up and felt and heard my bed hitting the floor
as if it</B>
<P><B>had been dropped... I didn't want to sleep in that room anymore.  When
I told</B>
<P><B>my Grandmother about it she said its just the house and not to worry.
 I did</B>
<P><B>worry and started sleeping in the living room.  </B>
<P><B>     When I was older I moved into another bedroom of the house figuring
it</B>
<P><B>would be safer.  Again I would sleep with the door open but sometimes
would</B>
<P><B>wake up to find the door shut.  One night I woke up and the door was
shut and</B>
<P><B>I felt scared to death. My eyes were open but I couldn't move.  I tried
to</B>
<P><B>scream for my Grandmother and Sister to help me but I couldn't.  I
felt a</B>
<P><B>pressure on my chest as if someone was laying over me.  Finally I was
able to</B>
<P><B>move my fingers then the pressure left my body... Other people came
to the</B>
<P><B>house and would say they felt something weird in the house.  </B>

</H3><P><B>By:  foxtattoo@lebpub.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was in elementary school, some </B>
<P><B>twenty years ago, I had a strange experience that I consider ghostly.
I </B>
<P><B>had just gotten home from school and found myself locked out of the
house, not </B>
<P><B>really that unusual, but I didn't have my house key with me. At the
back </B>
<P><B>of the house there is a porch that conects to a garage. After trying
the </B>
<P><B>backdoor, and finding it locked as well, I decided I'd have to break
in to the </B>
<P><B>house. Inside the garage there's a door that leads into part of the
house, and </B>
<P><B>even if that door was locked it has a removeable window that would
at least </B>
<P><B>allow me to unlock it so I could get in. The interesting thing about
the </B>
<P><B>door in the garage was that it allowed me to see through the house
to a window </B>
<P><B>which had a view of the locked back door. Well, as I was breaking in,
I </B>
<P><B>happened to look through that window and I saw the locked door open.
No </B>
<P><B>one else was home at that time, and after I put the window back, shaking
the </B>
<P><B>whole time, I ran to the phone and called my mother to tell her what
had </B>
<P><B>happened. I think my parents were reluctant to believe me, and who
</B>
<P><B>could blame them, I'll admit I was a strange child with a vivid
imagination, but </B>
<P><B>this really happened.I'd like to write again and tell some more of
</B>
<P><B>mine and my family and friends unusual experiences.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=omi>My Dear "Omi"</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By: mariel@mindspring.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Just a quick story to perhaps add to your collection...</B>
<P><B>My maternal grandmother, who I called "Omi", passed away at the age
of 92</B>
<P><B>about 3 years ago.  We had been very close, and she was always my
defender</B>
<P><B>and biggest fan.  She was a very spiritual person, and she told me
once</B>
<P><B>that she had been visited by the ghost of her own mother many years
ago.</B>
<P><B>Omi always promised me that, if it was possible, she would come back
to</B>
<P><B>visit me after she died.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, 2 years pass with no visit (and I admit, if anyone could come
back</B>
<P><B>from the Other Side, it would be my grandmother!), I put her promise
out of</B>
<P><B>my mind. This year my mother contracted cancer of the brain and died</B>
<P><B>shortly after, very suddenly.  I do not get along very well with the
rest</B>
<P><B>of my family (my brothers and sister are all over 20 years older than
I am,</B>
<P><B>and my dad and I just can't seem to agree on much of anything), and
my</B>
<P><B>mother's passing was very hard for me, since she and my grandmother
were</B>
<P><B>really the only members of the family I was close to.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have very vivid dreams quite frequently, and often they are very
surreal</B>
<P><B>and I don't quite understand what they mean.  But one night recently,
I had</B>
<P><B>a dream I was back in the house I grew up in and in my grandmother's
room.</B>
<P><B>In the dream, I knew she was dead, but it didn't seem unusual to me
for her</B>
<P><B>to be there.  I had just had a fight with my siblings and my dad and
I was</B>
<P><B>crying.  She hugged me and I pressed my left cheek against hers and
she</B>
<P><B>told me something to the effect of that she was always there with me
and</B>
<P><B>not to be sad or feel alone.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Right then, I woke up, and her presence was definitely in my room (far
away</B>
<P><B>from my old house)and I could still feel her where I had pressed my
cheek</B>
<P><B>against hers in the dream.  It was eerie, but comforting at the same
time.</B>
<P><B>I guess I had been waiting for her to fully appear to me as she said
her</B>
<P><B>own mother had done for her, but now I realize that her spirit was
there in</B>
<P><B>the room with me just as intensely as if I had been able to see her.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=bedroom>Bedroom Sillouette</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:  MityMouth1@worldnet.att.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was 18 years old (I am now 23) I was staying with my mother.
One night I </B>
<P><B>had a friend sleep over with me. It was getting late, so my mother
and her </B>
<P><B>husband decided to go to bed, as did my friend. I was the last one
to go </B>
<P><B>to bed that night. I remember laying there, staring out of the window
</B>
<P><B>because I was having trouble going to sleep. (Please note that I shut
my </B>
<P><B>bedroom door). About 10 minutes later, I heard what I thought was my
</B>
<P><B>Step-father crying. (This was not uncommon due to his Mental </B>
<P><B>disabilities.)I glanced over at the corner of my room, and saw what
I </B>
<P><B>thought was him crouched down, with his head buryied in his hands.
I have </B>
<P><B>never heard such anguish coming from anyone in my entire life. It was
dark </B>
<P><B>in my room, so all I could see was a solid black sillouette. It looked
</B>
<P><B>like ......smoke....is the best way I can describe it now. I raised
my </B>
<P><B>head up, and after a few more seconds, asked, Ed, are you alright?</B>
<P><B>What's wrong?? As soon as I had spoken the words I realized that </B>
<P><B>this thing was Not my mother's husband.It suddenly turned and looked
at </B>
<P><B>me, and it had glowing red eyes. (corny sounding I know.) I have never
in </B>
<P><B>my life been so terrified. The malice and hatred that it projected
at me </B>
<P><B>is something I have never again experienced. I was so terrified that
it </B>
<P><B>was going to attack me that I tried to scream. Yet Nothing came out.
</B>
<P><B>I wanted to wake my friend who was sleeping next to me, but I couldn't
move </B>
<P><B>because I was so afraid. The only thing I could do was clamp my eyes
</B>
<P><B>closed, so I did. When I opened them up again a few minutes later,
it was </B>
<P><B>gone. I didn't get out of bed, instead I laid there untill I fell </B>
<P><B>asleep. Needless to say, I did not sleep well that night, so I was
the </B>
<P><B>first one up in the morning. My door was wide open....I questioned
everyone in the </B>
<P><B>house about it that morning when they got up, but all said that they
had slept </B>
<P><B>soundly and never got out of bed. I never really mentioned it again,
but I </B>
<P><B>still remember the feeling of intense hatred, and rage, that whatever
that thing </B>
<P><B>was felt towards me.....I now question whether the whole experience
was a dream, </B>
<P><B>but only one fact keeps me from thinking so.....I never went to sleep
untill </B>
<P><B>after it was all over with. Have you heard of anything similar to this
at </B>
<P><B>all?? I don't mean hauntings, or ghosts flying around.....But the </B>
<P><B>impression that this thing gave me was that it was a deamon of some
sort.</B>
<P><B>Maybe I'm just crazy.....but I would love to know.Thank you for listening
</B>
<P><B>to my story. I hope it is of help to you.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  philt@hutch.com.au</B>
<P>
<P><B>Some years ago I lived in a 3-storey house in Penzance U.K. The house</B>
<P><B>was about 100 years old, granite construction in a terrace of 11
houses.</B>
<P><B>The house had 5 bedrooms, two of which were on the top floor, ie
attic</B>
<P><B>bedrooms. One overlooked the front of the house and the other the
back.</B>
<P><B>My brother who was a couple of years younger than me claimed the
front</B>
<P><B>bedroom as his own. A few years later he married and left home. I had
a</B>
<P><B>bedroom at t he back of the house on the next floor down.</B>
<P><B>One night my girlfriend slept over in the  front attic bedroom, at
the</B>
<P><B>same time our neighbours daughter and her friend slept over in
another</B>
<P><B>spare bedroom.</B>
<P><B>In the very early hours of the morning my girlfriend heard someone
at</B>
<P><B>her bedroom door. It was as though someone was trying to open the
door,</B>
<P><B>finding it locked or stuck, and then using more and more force to try</B>
<P><B>and open it. The sounds stopped abruptly at which point my girlfriend</B>
<P><B>grabbed her bed-clothes and ran down stairs and spent the rest of the</B>
<P><B>night with the neighbours daughter and friend. She staunchly refused
to</B>
<P><B>sleep in the room again, even refusing to go back up to get her
clothes</B>
<P><B>the next morning.</B>
<P><B>Some time later I moved into the attic bedroom myself and experienced</B>
<P><B>the same manifestation, however there was just the one occasion. It
 was</B>
<P><B>just as my girlfriend had reported. The door sounded as though
someone</B>
<P><B>was trying to force it open. The noise was sufficient to wake me and,</B>
<P><B>although it was somewhere around 12 - 1 o'clock in the morning there
was</B>
<P><B>sufficient light from a street light outside for me to see that the
door</B>
<P><B>was open, exactly as I'd left when I went to bed.</B>
<P><B>An interesting sequel to this story is that a few years later when
most</B>
<P><B>of the family had married and left home my parents sold the house to</B>
<P><B>move to a smaller cottage nearby. One morning my mother was returning</B>
<P><B>from the local shop when she met  the lady whose attic bedroom
adjoined</B>
<P><B>the the one in question. After the usual pleasantries the neighbour
said</B>
<P><B>that something strange had happened a few days earlier. She'd been
in</B>
<P><B>her main bedroom which was directly below her attic bedroom when she</B>
<P><B>heard footsteps on bare floor boards walk from our attic bedroom
across</B>
<P><B>into her attic bedroom. Our attic bedroom had been carpeted and
although</B>
<P><B>my parents had sold the property the new owners at that time hadn't</B>
<P><B>moved in as they were still in the process of selling their property.</B>

<P><B>I don't know whether I was dreaming or what because I heard that</B>
<P><B>sometimes when a person thinks they are awake, they are actually</B>
<P><B> still dreaming.  One night about one year ago, I was sound</B>
<P><B> asleep in my bed.  I woke up at about 2:30 am, I guess cause I </B>
<P><B>was interupted by a noise from outside or something.  I turned</B>
<P><B> over to find what looked like the figure of a woman standing </B>
<P><B>over me smilling.  I closed my eyes for a brief second and when </B>
<P><B>I opened them again, the figure was still there. I was so scared</B>
<P><B>that I started screaming for my mother; it dissappeared when I
started</B>
<P><B>screaming about five to ten seconds after.  I don't know whether</B>
<P><B> that was a weird hallucination, or a brief visit from one of my</B>
<P><B> deceased relatives.  All i know is that it never happened</B>
<P><B>again, and i hope it never does.</B>

<P><B> Before I start this little story I just want to say</B>
<P><B>that my aunt only has two daughters and they are both young girls,
one</B>
<P><B>is 12 and the other is 14. One night while my aunt was washing
dishes,(her</B>
<P><B>back was turned) she said it felt like the little toddler had fell
and</B>
<P><B>tried to catch on to her back leg calves. So she then turned around
but</B>
<P><B>didn't see anything. It also has happened to her more than once, but
she</B>
<P><B>doesn't get scared it really doesn't bother her.</B>
<P><B>       Also, one day my mother went to my aunt's house</B>
<P><B>to visit with her so my mom was outside the door waiting for my aunt
to</B>
<P><B>answer the door. My mom said that the wind wasn't blowing and all of
a</B>
<P><B>sudden she heard a little boy laughing so she turned to her right and
sees</B>
<P><B>this little boy in a blue sailor suit swinging on the swings. And she
said</B>
<P><B>he was kind of transparent, foggy like. She said he stayed there for
a</B>
<P><B>second smiling at her but then he disappeared just like that. My aunt
no</B>
<P><B>longer lives there and it didn't follow her, but now my other aunt
lives</B>
<P><B>there but she hasn't experienced anything. And we aren't going to
tell</B>
<P><B>her about my other aunt's experieces because this aunt is way
dingy-like.</B>
<P><B>And by the way, they knew of no history of the house!</B>

<P>
<P><B>Well, my dad was stationed on an Air Force base in Tenn (well over
20 years</B>
<P><B>ago).  He and some of his friends were clowning around in an old
graveyard.</B>
<P><B>It was old and not very well cared for.  Some of the graves were sunken
in and</B>
<P><B>some were shallow enough that there were holes from the final collapse
of the</B>
<P><B>coffin.  Well, dad and his friends got a little rowdy and something
in the</B>
<P><B>graveyard didnt' like it.  Dad said they could hear this growling sound
and it</B>
<P><B>got louder and louder, comeing from every direction.  Well, these guys
weren't</B>
<P><B>so dumb that they waited around for something to happen.  They took
off like</B>
<P><B>the devil himself was on their heels and the very second they crossed
the</B>
<P><B>threshold of the cemetary, the growling stopped.</B>
<P><B>My family is prone to strange happenings.  My Grandma predicted my
grandpa's</B>
<P><B>death.  She had a dream that Grandpa, my dad and one of my uncles went
over a</B>
<P><B>hill and it was close to dinner time so she called them back.  My dad
and</B>
<P><B>uncle came back, but when she called for Grandpa, he said he wasn't
comeing</B>
<P><B>back.  No more than two weeks after the dream, Grandpa had a heart
attack at</B>
<P><B>the dinner table and died before the paramedics arrived.  That was
19 years</B>
<P><B>ago and Grandma hasn't dreamt about grandpa untill just recently. 
She thinks</B>
<P><B>she'd going to die soon because of it and I can't dismiss it.  I've
predicted</B>
<P><B>the death of some of our favorite pets and can't explain it, but I
know it's</B>
<P><B>for real.  I just looked at one of our parrots one night and she just
looked</B>
<P><B>funny.  I thought to myself, "Sunny-bird, you look dead."  Sure enough,
no</B>
<P><B>more than a week later, she dies accidentally.</B>
<P><B>Than we have a ghost in our house too.  Nothing but silly pranks;
hiding</B>
<P><B>things and not giving them back till we ask, teasing the pets, jumping
up on</B>
<P><B>occupied beds, children laughing in the night, playing with the buttons
on the</B>
<P><B>alarm clocks, nothing major.  We think it's a kid.  But the one that
gets up</B>
<P><B>on the beds may be a dog.  I thought it was my dog a couple of times,
but when</B>
<P><B>I looked, there was nothing there, not even a depression, but I know
I felt</B>
<P><B>something.  Thanks for listening.  </B>
