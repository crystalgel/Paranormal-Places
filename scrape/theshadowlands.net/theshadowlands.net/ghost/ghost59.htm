<H3><B><A NAME=cabin>Wyoming Log Cabin Ghosts</A></B>
</H3><P><B>by: Sttarr@webtv.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>I want to start this at the begining so you fully understand what</B>
<P><B>happened.  My mother, father, little brother and I live in North</B>
<P><B>Carolina for most of my childhood.  My father got laid off from his

job</B>
<P><B>and had to seek other employment.  A friend of my fathers had moved

away</B>
<P><B>a few years earlier.  They stayed in contact through letters and

phone</B>
<P><B>calls.  His friend invited him to come out and see this little town

in</B>
<P><B>Wyoming called Wheatland.  He had been telling my father how nice it

was</B>
<P><B>out there for years.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>After usuccesful attempts to find work, my father decided to take his</B>
<P><B>friend up on his offer.  I was in the beginning of my sophmore year

and</B>
<P><B>my brother had just started seventh grade.  We arrived in Wheatland

and</B>
<P><B>stayed with my dads friend until we could find a place of our own.</B>
<P><B>Luckily his friend was managing three apartment buildings, so we

moved</B>
<P><B>in to our own apartment.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My father has always been the type to like living miles away from</B>
<P><B>civilization, and the apartment life was getting to him.  So my

mother</B>
<P><B>and father set out to find another place to live.  I don't know how

they</B>
<P><B>came across this house exactly, all I remember is one day dad said

him</B>
<P><B>and mom had a house they wanted us to see.  That afternoon they took

us</B>
<P><B>to see it.  It was about thirty miles out of Wheatland in a little

place</B>
<P><B>known as El Rancho.  The house was on a dirt road with only three

other</B>
<P><B>families living on it.  One of those people was our landlord and one

was</B>
<P><B>our landlords cousin.  The other family had lived there almost as long

as</B>
<P><B>our landlord had.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Our house was the last one on the road.  It sat down in a valley and

had</B>
<P><B>two big hills right in front of the house, making it impossible to
see from</B>
<P><B>any road.  My brother and I got out to inspect the place and saw the

big</B>
<P><B>hill to the left of the house.  We decided that we could see alot

more</B>
<P><B>from up there so we climbed to the top to take a look around.  The

place</B>
<P><B>had a creek down to the right of the house, and had an old barn on

the</B>
<P><B>waters edge.  In front of that barn was a fenced in area used for

storing</B>
<P><B>hay bales.  Across from that was a big Quanset Hut.  The hut was

empty</B>
<P><B>and you could tell it had been used mainly for fixing cars.  Right</B>
<P><B>behind the house on the left hand side was an old two story log cabin</B>
<P><B>that was falling in on the back side.  It had only a few windows left

in</B>
<P><B>it and one of them faced the house.  The landlord told us that it was</B>
<P><B>built in the 1800's by two brothers from Kentucky.  We never paid

much</B>
<P><B>attention to it, but it soon became something that would grab the</B>
<P><B>attention of us all.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>We moved in the house about three days later and unpacked and got</B>
<P><B>everything put in its place.  For about the first three months</B>
<P><B>everything went normal.  My brother and I were already in school and

had</B>
<P><B>found our new bus stop which was at the restraunt about three miles

away</B>
<P><B>from the house.  My brother and I always loved to be outside, we were</B>
<P><B>always together, if you saw one of us the other was not to far away.

 We</B>
<P><B>spent all of our spare time outside playing and finding new

adventures</B>
<P><B>to explore.  One day we were playing out by the creek like we had

done</B>
<P><B>many times before.  We were knelt down by the water messing with</B>
<P><B>something, I don't really remember what, when my brother nudged me
on</B>
<P><B>the shoulder and told me to look up.  I looked up and saw this little</B>
<P><B>boy and a blonde colored dog standing about twenty yards down the

creek</B>
<P><B>on the opposite side we were on.  We both were a little confused

about</B>
<P><B>him being there because we were unaware of any other kids living in

the</B>
<P><B>area. except for the ones that lived beside the restraunt.  The kid

we</B>
<P><B>saw was about eight or nine years old and was wearing a red shirt and</B>
<P><B>jeans.  After sitting there looking at him for what seemed to be five</B>
<P><B>minutes the boy began to walk away, so we decided to go talk to him.

 We</B>
<P><B>walked to the other side of the creek and down towards the area he

was</B>
<P><B>standing at, only to find that he was not there.  We looked all

around</B>
<P><B>and saw nothing.  The creek had a few trees on each side all the way</B>
<P><B>down and then it was nothing but a big field that stopped at the base

of</B>
<P><B>the hill our house and the old cabin was on.  We were standing on the</B>
<P><B>edge of the field and knew the boy could not run fast enough to be

out</B>
<P><B>of sight before we could walk across the creek.  We looked for a

little</B>
<P><B>while longer and then just figured that maybe he had went on down the</B>
<P><B>creek.  My brother nor I had never seen him before so we thought

maybe</B>
<P><B>he was down visiting someone in the neighborhood.  Later that night

we</B>
<P><B>told our parents about seeing this little boy and they came to the

same</B>
<P><B>conclusion we did. </B>
<P>
<P><B>As time passed we kept seeing the little boy but we could never catch</B>
<P><B>him.  Strange things started happening in the house like strange

noises</B>
<P><B>coming from the basement and clatering ourside our bedroom window.
 My</B>
<P><B>brother and I shared a room so we were always together when we would</B>
<P><B>hear these noises.  Well I guess my dad got interested in the

sightings</B>
<P><B>of this boy, so one day when him and my mother were at the landlords</B>
<P><B>house they asked if there was a little boy that lived in the area.
 We</B>
<P><B>no longer thought he was just visiting because it had been about six</B>
<P><B>months since the first sighting.  Nobody visits for that long.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>When they asked the question they got the answer we were afraid of.

 No</B>
<P><B>little children lived any where near our house.  At least not in a

twenty</B>
<P><B>mile radius.  That meant that the boy was not normal by far.  To my</B>
<P><B>brother and I that made him more interesting than before.  The next

time</B>
<P><B>we saw him he was sitting on the top of the hay in the fenced in area

of</B>
<P><B>the front yard. My brother and I were right in front of the house</B>
<P><B>playing in the driveway.  We decided to run really fast and try to

talk</B>
<P><B>to him.  The boy let us get about half way there before moving, he

just</B>
<P><B>sat there looking at us.  Then he jumped down from the hay bail and

ran</B>
<P><B>around it to the back side which was out of our site.  We ran even</B>
<P><B>faster trying to get close to him.  When we got there he was gone.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This went on for a year and a half, then something new happened.  We</B>
<P><B>were in our bedroom trying to go to sleep and talking about one thing

or</B>
<P><B>another.  My bed was right under the front window to the house and

his</B>
<P><B>was under the side window of the house.  I always slept with my

window</B>
<P><B>open at night because it would get stuffy in the room.  While we were</B>
<P><B>talking I heard a noise outside my window, I motioned to my brother

to</B>
<P><B>stop talking and he heard it too.  At first it sounded like single</B>
<P><B>footsteps then the footsteps got faster.  After that it seemed like

alot</B>
<P><B>of footsteps.  They were walking on the gravel driveway which was

maybe</B>
<P><B>six feet from my window.  My brother looked out his window first to

see</B>
<P><B>if there was a person or a shadow of a person infront of the house.

 He</B>
<P><B>saw nothing.  Then I decided to look out mine.  There was nothing

there,</B>
<P><B>but the footsteps where louder than before.  It scared the life out

of</B>
<P><B>me so I layed back down.The footsteps were pacing right in front of

the</B>
<P><B>house.  We looked at each other and decided after about five minuted

it</B>
<P><B>was time to go get dad.  We ran in to our parents room and woke him

up.</B>
<P><B>He put on his shoes and grabbed his pistol to go check things out.

 When</B>
<P><B>he went outside we followed,  there was nothing there and the

footsteps</B>
<P><B>had stopped.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The noises and sightings of the little boy went on for the next year.</B>
<P><B>Then another sighting took place this time it was a woman.  I saw her

in</B>
<P><B>a window in the old cabin just looking out into the never ending

fields.</B>
<P><B>I stared at her for a few moments not believing my eyes and then

looked</B>
<P><B>away.  When I looked back a few seconds later she was gone.  I knew</B>
<P><B>better than try to go find her, because I knew she would not be there.

 </B>
<P>
<P><B>The next one was what made my mother a believer.  My father had seen

the</B>
<P><B>boy himself so he knew we were telling the truth.  My mom on the

other</B>
<P><B>hand had never experienced it for herself.  She was down stairs in

the</B>
<P><B>basement, which is where the washer and dryer was located and heard</B>
<P><B>someone calling her.  My father, brother and I had went in town to

get</B>
<P><B>some groceries.  My mother went up stairs thinking we had forgot</B>
<P><B>something.  When she got there she found nothing, nobody was home

except</B>
<P><B>her.</B>
<P>
<P><B>June came and my father had given me permission to fly home and spend</B>
<P><B>the summer with my sister in North Carolina.  I spent the whole

summer</B>
<P><B>there and then decided I wanted to stay for my senior year.  My

parents</B>
<P><B>did not like the idea but respected my decision. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Hunting season came and my father and brother went out of town with</B>
<P><B>friends to Snowy Range, which is known for good size deer and big

game.</B>
<P><B>They were to be gone for three weeks.  That left my mother alone. 

She</B>
<P><B>had a friend that came over alot and stayed a couple nights with her,</B>
<P><B>but for the most part she was by herself.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Everything went ok until the day before my father was coming home.
 My</B>
<P><B>mom was at the kitchen sink washing dishes, were you could look up

and</B>
<P><B>see the old log cabin through the window.  She looked out the window

and</B>
<P><B>saw something that took her breath away.  She saw a lady standing in

the</B>
<P><B>second story window in the front of the cabin.  She was wearing a

white</B>
<P><B>dress and was very bright.  My mother stood there for about thirty</B>
<P><B>minutes and the lady never moved, she just stood there looking out

the</B>
<P><B>window.  Eventually my mother got scared and couldn't take no more.

 She</B>
<P><B>grabbed the keys to the truck and headed for town.  She stayed that</B>
<P><B>night with her friend.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next day my father found her at her friends and she expained what</B>
<P><B>happened.  About three months later I came home and they told me what</B>
<P><B>happened.  My dad decided to open his own business, so we needed a

place</B>
<P><B>closer to town.  We moved out about four months later and have not

been</B>
<P><B>back since.  I don't know what happened to the place or why the

ghosts</B>
<P><B>were there, but I do know that they are real and looking for

something.</B>
<P><B>Now we all live in Texas and often sit and talk about that old cabin,</B>
<P><B>because to us it was an on going mystery. </B>

<H3><B><A NAME=evil>Evil is Out There</A></B>
</H3><P><B>by: pssim@ebtech.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>It all started when I was about 13 years old. My mother was practising

witchcraft</B>
<P><B> (which I later learned about) and she had the neighbour lady over
for coffee one</B>
<P><B> day. This lady was supposedly the head witch of this white magic cult.

She, my</B>
<P><B> mother and I were sitting at our kitchen table when she got up out
of her seat </B>
<P><B>and said I feel a presence in this house. She walked to my parents</B>
<P><B>bedroom door and said The presence is in here. That made my hair

stand</B>
<P><B> on end. She said Do you ever have anything strange going on in or
around this </B>
<P><B>bedroom? My mother tripped my memory off by saying, As a matter of

fact</B>
<P><B> we do. My parents home was over 100 years old at the time(whether
or not that</B>
<P><B> has any bearing, I don't know. My mother told her that no matter when
or how you </B>
<P><B>closed</B> <B>the door, it would always be open a crack when you returned.

Or that we could be </B>
<P><B>sitting right in the living room (outside the door) and you would literally

watch it creak </B>
<P><B>open.</B> &nbsp;<B> My mother also told her that whenever our cat was

anywhere in the radious of </B>
<P><B>one foot from</B> <B>the door, it would put its head between its front
paws and do a somersault </B>
<P><B>right there and</B> <B>then continue on its way like nothing ever

happened.(The cat was never </B>
<P><B>seen doing this anywhere else in the house besides in front of the
bedroom door.) This </B>
<P><B>lady said  It's just what I thought. A woman died in this bedroom years
ago </B>
<P><B>and her spirit can't get</B> <B>any farther than the room. So when
the door opens, it is her </B>
<P><B>looking out. Trying to get out. There went my hair standing on end
again. This story </B>
<P><B>freaks me when I tell it. I don't tell it to too many people because
it's the unknown and </B>
<P><B>they don't want to believe it.They look at you like you've lost your

marbles. I often </B>
<P><B>wondered if I had. Being 13, I</B> <B>was very skeptacle and thought
she was just trying to </B>
<P><B>scare us. Anyhow, a couple of weeks later I asked the old woman who
lived next door if </B>
<P><B>there was anything weird about our house</B> <B>(since she was born
in her house and raised </B>
<P><B>there). She said that a woman had died in the front bedroom many years

before. I asked </B>
<P><B>her if she knew this woman whom my mother had had over for coffee and
she said No. </B>
<P><B>She said that she preferred to keep to herself</B> <B>and didn't mingle

with the neighbours. I </B>
<P><B>ask you. Since this witch woman was newer in the</B> <B>neighbourhood
How could she have </B>
<P><B>known that? Trudging on. About 4 months after</B> <B>her first visit
I was walking around our </B>
<P><B>house with my mother, watching her put stars on all</B> <B>of our

windowpanes. I asked her </B>
<P><B>why and she told me it was so no evil spirits could get in.</B>

&nbsp;<B> (I found out later that she was </B>
<P><B>actually welcoming them in by doing that). One night about 3</B>

<B>months later I was in a </B>
<P><B>deep sleep. My room only illuminated by my alarm clock, my door shut.</B>

&nbsp;<B> I was</B>
<P><B> awakened by a mans breathing. A heavy, deep, loud, almost panicky

breathing sound. I</B>
<P><B> sat</B> <B>up in my bed, fully awake now and listened. The moment
I sat up, it stopped. I </B>
<P><B>thought to myself</B> <B>Whew, I was only dreaming. I had only been
sitting there for about 10 </B>
<P><B>seconds when</B> <B>it started again, only louder this time. I had
my eyes open when I heard it. </B>
<P><B>I plugged my ears and started to freak. I was flailing around, kicking
and screaming Oh </B>
<P><B>my God, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy......... until my dad finally came bargeing

through the </B>
<P><B>door. He turned on the light and saw me freaking and said What in the
hell is the matter. </B>
<P><B>I kept kicking with my eyes</B> <B>shut and yelling et it out Daddy.

Something's in my room. </B>
<P><B>Get it out. Oh my God please get it out. It's under the bed or something.

He yelled </B>
<P><B>What's in your room? I was frantic and I screamed back, There's a man

breathing in </B>
<P><B>here, get it out, oh please get it out. He sat down on the side of
my bed and grabbed </B>
<P><B>ahold of me and said There's nothing in here, I checked. It's okay
and he held me close. </B>
<P><B>When I finally got to look at him, he had panick and terror in his
eyes. He could tell that </B>
<P><B>I wasn't freaking for no reason. &nbsp;I was a very good child and
never told any big lies like</B>
<P><B> that one would be. He got me calmed down and I went back to sleep.Ever

since then,</B>
<P><B> this whatever has followed me to different places I have lived as
an adult. I once saw</B>
<P><B> the sillouette of a man in the hallway from my bed. Once again woken
up by the feeling</B>
<P><B> someone was watching me. I have a younger sister. 7 years younger.
One day at my</B>
<P><B> parents about 6 years ago, our family was discussing that night in
my room many years</B>
<P><B> before which my sister never knew about. All of a sudden, she started
to cry. I gave her </B>
<P><B>a hug and asked what was wrong and she said that she had seen a ghost
of a lady</B>
<P><B> standing outside my bedroom door years earlier. She described what
she was</B>
<P><B> wearingand than she said that she just turned to a skeleton and the
bones just fell into a</B>
<P><B> heap on the floor. She also said she had kept this secret from anyone
for fear everyone</B>
<P><B> would think that she was lying. The look on my parents face was priceless.

Now I know</B>
<P><B> that they really do believe that there was something in my room that

night. My mom</B>
<P><B> had since all this, turned christian and threw out everything on witchery

but I've been</B>
<P><B> told that this thing was following me because I was never properly
prayed for to</B>
<P><B> completely rid me of it. I started to go to church and have never
had another episode. I</B>
<P><B> have left out a few small happenings for fear of running out of room,
but believeyou-me,</B>
<P><B>the unknown is scary and it is really out there. Just like God is there
for us, so are evil</B>
<P><B> sprits, or lost spirits etc. roaming this earth. If you don't beleive
it, it's because you</B>
<P><B> haven't experienced it and I hope you never do.</B>

<P><B>by: boltz1@ibm.net</B>
<P>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>I had a very awful experience with ghosts.I will explain to you. When

I</B>
<P><B>first moved into my boyfriends house, everything was going great. I

had</B>
<P><B>no idea that his house was haunted nor that anyone had died in it.

 His</B>
<P><B>mother had lived there since he was born and had many boyfriends.

Well,</B>
<P><B>one of them had a heart attack in the bathroom and died. People say

that</B>
<P><B>he was a real jerk. Anyways, when my man was 18, his mother died.

After</B>
<P><B>that had happened, he said that he knew she was watching over him.
He</B>
<P><B>said that he would see her on some rare occasions, like when him and

his</B>
<P><B>ex-girlfriend would fight. Well, one morning at around 5:30am, I saw

a</B>
<P><B>shadow of a man that I thought at first to be my boyfriend, but he

had</B>
<P><B>already gone to work. I had this terrible horrible feeling in my gut.

He</B>
<P><B>had walked from my side of the bed to the door then I felt someone</B>
<P><B>trying to pull me out of bed. I had been in and out of sleep up until</B>
<P><B>that point. I instantly was wide awake. I did not sleep again til the</B>
<P><B>next night. My theory on this was that the man that I saw was a very

bad</B>
<P><B>man and my boyfriends mom was trying to wake me up from the horrible</B>
<P><B>things that I was half dreaming.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=hotel>Haunted New Orleans Hotel</A></B>
</H3><P><B>by: LDDD1000@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>   My husband and I visit the beautiful town of New Orleans.  With
us are two</B>
<P><B>couples, one from San Diego and one from New Jersey.  New Orleans is
a great</B>
<P><B>city, whether or not you are interested in hauntings, beautiful sights

and</B>
<P><B>full of history.   We are staying at the ?Thomas Jefferson Hotel? (the

hotel</B>
<P><B>next to the  "corn row fence").  Beautiful hotel, great service, small

rooms.</B>
<P><B>Anyone who has been to New Orleans knows how much fun you can have
on Bourbon</B>
<P><B>Street, but I don't think that explains the following experience. 
</B>
<P>
<P><B>     My husband and I had the smallest room and the room closest to

the</B>
<P><B>courtyard.  One night as we were going to sleep, or should I say, my

husband</B>
<P><B>was asleep and I was trying to go to sleep, I felt something I have
never felt</B>
<P><B>before.  I felt an undulating current of air flowing over me.  ( I

know,</B>
<P><B>sounds weird).  The air was not particularily cold, but it had an

unusual</B>
<P><B>movement to it.  Kind of an up and down wave pattern.  My first instinct

was</B>
<P><B>to giggle, this air simply felt funny.  But after a few minutes, I

started</B>
<P><B>wondering where this air current was coming from.  I could not see
any vents</B>
<P><B>or windows that could account for the unusal feeling of the air, but
I assumed</B>
<P><B>there was an air conditioning vent under the bed that forced the air
into this</B>
<P><B>weird pattern.  I  looked behind the bed but could see nothing.  Finally,

 I</B>
<P><B>fell asleep, the next morning I had my husband pull the bed out from
the wall</B>
<P><B>to locate the vent that caused the current, of course, there was no
vent, so I</B>
<P><B>just dismissed the whole event.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>     The next night, our friends and us took a "ghost tour" (great
fun!)  We</B>
<P><B>toured much of the city and learned about some probable haunted sights.

 One</B>
<P><B>of the last stops we made, to our surprise, was to our hotel.  Our
guide told</B>
<P><B>us that the sight, once was the home of a "Boy's School".  The school

had</B>
<P><B>suffered from a tragic fire and many of the students had been lost
to the</B>
<P><B>blaze.  Our guide was not allowed on hotel grounds  (the hotel did
not want</B>
<P><B>the negative publicity), but she told us an interesting story.  Many

children</B>
<P><B>were lost in the fire.  The hotel was reputed to be haunted by the
ghosts of</B>
<P><B>the children who died in the fire.  Our guide suggested that the ghosts

were</B>
<P><B>very playful ( as children will be ), and that the hotel did not want

the</B>
<P><B>publicity that a  verified haunting would bring.  She was very surprised

that</B>
<P><B>we were staying at the hotel, and wanted to know if we experienced

anything</B>
<P><B>unusal.  Since we were guests, we invited her in to the courtyard and

talked</B>
<P><B>about the stories she has heard surrounding the hotel.  I did not tell

her</B>
<P><B>about my experiences, I don't know why.  But, I feel, I felt the presence

of</B>
<P><B>the ghost of a child.  </B>

<P><B>she was 3 or 4 we were going through some old photo's and came across
one of</B>
<P><B>my grandmother, who my daughter never seen. She said that was my

grandmother</B>
<P><B>and that she had seen her before and had talked to her. I thought that

was</B>

<P>
<P><B>Hi.  My name is Johanna and my story goes back to when I was around
12 or 13</B>
<P><B>years old.  My sister (twin) had a bedroom up in the attic my father
finished</B>
<P><B>off.  He built a huge walk in closet.  On both sides of the doorway
entering</B>
<P><B>the closet was a picture of my grandfather and my greatgrandfather.
 One night</B>
<P><B>I was in the closet trying to select some clothes to wear to school
the next</B>
<P><B>day and I heard the voice.  It was a whisper and it called my name
Johanna.  I</B>
<P><B>heard it twice and got so scared I ran downstairs and told my folks.
 They</B>
<P><B>thought it was just my imigination.  It seemed like everytime I was
by myself</B>
<P><B>and I went into the closet, I would hear that whisper.  It didn't happen
all</B>
<P><B>the time.  Just on occasion.  It really scared me.  Then one day, my
twin</B>
<P><B>sister said she too heard a voice.  This was the house we lived in
New</B>
<P><B>Brunswick, NJ.  I heard the voices off and on until we moved to another
house</B>
<P><B>in East Brunswick.  I though, good we are in another house I won't
hear</B>
<P><B>anything.  Soon after we moved in the house, my mother set up the
ironing</B>
<P><B>board down the cellar.  We would go down there to iron are clothes.
 One night</B>
<P><B>I was down the cellar ironing not even thinking about the voice and
boom! I</B>
<P><B>heard that very faint call Johanna.  I flew up the cellar stairs and
didn't</B>
<P><B>say anything because I thought maybe I'm drinking too much coffee,
I tried not</B>
<P><B>to believe I was hearing this again. Again, this would not happen all
the time</B>
<P><B>but I never new when it would happen again and I was scared.  If I
had to go</B>
<P><B>down the cellar, I always asked my father to come down with me while
I ironed.</B>
<P><B>Now something else started in this house in my bedroom.  One night
I was</B>
<P><B>sleeping in my room with the light out.  I felt a presence like someone
was</B>
<P><B>staring at me from across the room.  I layed in my bed thinking I was
being</B>
<P><B>stupid - just go to sleep I said to myself.  It came closer and then
went</B>
<P><B>away.   Again another night I was sleeping and again I felt this
presence</B>
<P><B>someone standing there all black and tall.   I froze, I couldn't move,
I</B>
<P><B>couldn't screem.  I felt my bed tremble and I put the covers over my
head and</B>
<P><B>hoped it would go away and it did that night.  Another night again
I felt this</B>
<P><B>presence only this time I actually felt this thing come over and lay
on top of</B>
<P><B>me.  I tried to scream, fight.  I was paralyzed. I couldn't move. 
It felt</B>
<P><B>like it lasted for a number of minutes.  Then it got off me and
disappeared.</B>
<P><B>I through the light on in my room.  I'm telling you, I have never been
so</B>
<P><B>scared in my life.  Questions running through my head yelling what
is this?</B>
<P><B>This happened  too often so I always slept with the light on.  This
never</B>
<P><B>happened when I had the light on.  We lived in this house for around
six</B>
<P><B>years.  We now moved to another house down the road, still in East
Brunswick,</B>
<P><B>NJ.  I took a room that had a very old small looking closet.  This
house was</B>
<P><B>around 50 years old.  I did not like the way I felt whenever I stood
in front</B>
<P><B>of that closet.  We were in this house for a couple of months and it
started</B>
<P><B>again.  I was sleeping one night and again I felt there was a presence
in my</B>
<P><B>room.  I knew it was there because I got very cold and I felt like
I was</B>
<P><B>paralyzed again and could not move.  This thing was not nice.  I felt
like it</B>
<P><B>was evil.  It came over to my bed and again layed on time of me feeling
like</B>
<P><B>it pinned me down.  I through the light on again and slept with the
light on.</B>
<P><B>This happened a number of times.  I finally moved out of this house
after 8</B>
<P><B>years and moved into a farm house sharing it some friends of mine.
   One</B>
<P><B>thing I forgot to mention is that the first house in East Brunswick
- when I</B>
<P><B>was down the cellar ironing one night trying to whistle or do anything
to not</B>
<P><B>let me think of hearing voices, I heard a voice call not my name but
my</B>
<P><B>sisters name.  I panicked and was screaming for my father to come
downstairs.</B>
<P><B>To get back to the farmhouse now in Cranbury.  The voices stopped.
 I no</B>
<P><B>longer hear voices calling my name  but the presence is here again.
 I was in</B>
<P><B>my bedroom with my dog and I put the light out to go to sleep.  I was
laying</B>
<P><B>there a little while and I felt someone staring at me from across the
room.  I</B>
<P><B>thought oh know, not again.  I layed there scared.  I tried to reach
over and</B>
<P><B>put the light on and I couldn't.  I was frozen again.  This thing came
over</B>
<P><B>and layed on top of my.  It was a pressure like someone actually laying
on you</B>
<P><B>holding you down.  My dog apparently did not do anything.  One night
this</B>
<P><B>happened so bad, I found myself trying to scream and I actually did.
 I ran</B>
<P><B>downstairs while my roommate was watching TV and sat and watched TV.
 I didn't</B>
<P><B>say anthing to him.  I thought he would think I'm  looney tunes.  The
next day</B>
<P><B>I contacted a psychic.  I had to try and get an answer.  This had been
going</B>
<P><B>on too long.  I explained to her my story and she said what I told
her was</B>
<P><B>what she heard many times from other people.  She called this an
"entity".</B>
<P><B>She recommended I sleep with a cross in my room. and keep a nightlight
on.</B>
<P><B>Well ever since then nothing had happened.  I have since gotten married
and</B>
<P><B>have lived in two other locations and nothing is happening.  Its just
that</B>
<P><B>since I was 12 yrs old and I am now 50, why me?  Why was this thing
bothering</B>
<P><B>me?  Why was I hearing a voice calling my name?</B>
<P>
<P><B>Also, I recently went to a house that was supposed to be haunted over</B>
<P><B>halloween.  They gave tours throughout the house by a well known
psychic.</B>
<P><B>Before our group went into the house we were standing on a large porch
and it</B>
<P><B>was in front of the doorway with glass go you could see inside the
foyer and</B>
<P><B>up the stairs.  As she was speeking about the house and where we were
going to</B>
<P><B>go.  I glanced inside the doorway and was drawn to the landing up the
stairs.</B>
<P><B>I sensed someone was looking down at us watching.  It looked like a
person</B>
<P><B>with  a very long skirt.  Like a victorian skirt.  I saw like a
silhouette.</B>
<P><B>As this psychic spoke more about the house, she now addressed the group
and</B>
<P><B>said we are now going to go into this house and the first site of energy
will</B>
<P><B>be at the first landing on top of the stairs.  This is where she felt
an</B>
<P><B>entity.  Well when I heard that I thought, is it that I have some kind
of not</B>
<P><B>calling but I don't know how to explain why is it that I possibly could
see or</B>
<P><B>sense something.  Anyway this is my story.  If you have any answers
I sure</B>
<P><B>would appreciate some answers.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Thank you.</B>

<P>
<P><B>This happened to my niece Amy who was probably 8 or 9 at the time.
She had a</B>
<P><B>good friend named Sarah, and would frequently spend the night with
her. One</B>
<P><B>night, at Sarah's house, the girls got hungry so as girls will do,
they</B>
<P><B>started to creep upstairs. It was early morning, possibly 1 or 2am.
As they</B>
<P><B>headed up the stairs, they noticed a pinkish light reflecting in the
base of a</B>
<P><B>lamp sitting at the top of the stairs. They turned and to their amazement
saw</B>
<P><B>a woman seated on the couch, holding a baby or small child in her lap.
Both</B>
<P><B>were glowing bright pink. The girls, their hunger forgotten, ran back
down the</B>
<P><B>stairs and dove under the Hyda-Bed they had been sleeping in. The next
morning</B>
<P><B>no one believed them. </B>
<P><B>As far as I know Sarah's family is still there and have not seen the
ghosts</B>
<P><B>since. I changed the girls names but this story is true. It happened
perhaps</B>
<P><B>15 years ago in Washington state.</B>

</H3><P><B>BY: GOODGRL699@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>   I have spent my whole life with ghosts. My mothers house is haunted
and</B>
<P><B>growing up I had strange experiences . I was 3 years old when I first
saw him,</B>
<P><B>he use to come into my bedroom at night and play with my toys. He was
a tall</B>
<P><B>man in a blue suit. I would lay in my bed and pretend I was asleep
but I kept</B>
<P><B>one eye open then when he would turn and look at me I would put my
head under</B>
<P><B>the covers. When your a little kid you think if  you can't see them
they can't</B>
<P><B>see you . Anyways he would go to the end of my bed and grab the end
of my</B>
<P><B>covers and slowly pull them down off of my head. I would quickly grab
the</B>
<P><B>blanket and pull it back up Yelling for my mother to come into my room.
She</B>
<P><B>would come running in and I would tell her what I saw and like any
other</B>
<P><B>mother she would blame it on the late night snack I ate.</B>
<P><B>    This happened pretty close to every night growing up then when
I was 8</B>
<P><B>years old he started to move stuff around my house and making himself
known to</B>
<P><B>not only me but the whole family.  One night about 3 am my mother woke
up and</B>
<P><B>started down the hallway (her room was at the end of a long hall).
to get a</B>
<P><B>drink  my mom was one to walk in the dark she never turned on lights
we use to</B>
<P><B>call her catwoman . Anyways she was walking kind of quickly and bumped
in to</B>
<P><B>a solid figure in the hall way when this happened she fell backwards
the</B>
<P><B>figure picked her back up and turned on the light and as the light
came on</B>
<P><B>there was no one there My mom said she didn't know what to do so she
just said</B>
<P><B>thank you and ran back to her room and shut the door.   Things progressed
from</B>
<P><B>there .After my mothers experience he left me alone and started on
her, he</B>
<P><B>would walk the end of her bed every night and watch her. This went
on for about</B>
<P><B>a month . Then he got a bit braver and would get into her bed in the
middle of</B>
<P><B>the night. She knew he was there because she had a water bed and her
side</B>
<P><B>would raise up when  he got in.  She started to sleep with me after
that.</B>
<P><B>  Then he started to take a liking to my older sister and would open
and close</B>
<P><B>the bathroom door on her while she was in there taking a shower.  Finally
my</B>
<P><B>mom just got  tired of all that was going on and one day as he was
moving the</B>
<P><B>rocking chair from the living room to the kitchen she started yelling
at him.</B>
<P><B>She told him that if he wanted to live in her house he had to play
by her</B>
<P><B>rules  Which I thought was funny because I heard the same speech when
I was</B>
<P><B>16. Anyways my mother still lives in the house and he doesn't bother
her</B>
<P><B>anymore. He is still there but he has set his sites on the cats now
and</B>
<P><B>torments them instead of her.</B>

</H3><P><B>By: donovan@cyberbiz.net.au</B>
<P>
<P><B>( i have changed my name.. and also other peoples)</B>
<P>
<P><B>My Nanna lives in Holland Park, and old suburb of Brisbane, Australia.
She</B>
<P><B>had lived there with my pa for more then ten years. I never knew my</B>
<P><B>grandfather. pa died before I was born, and died in his sleep in this</B>
<P><B>house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Ever since I was five years old I experienced many strange things in
my</B>
<P><B>nanna's house.  when I use to stay overnight I would sleep in my
uncle's</B>
<P><B>old room, which is situated right next to my nanna's bedroom. I would
lay</B>
<P><B>there on the bed, and soon after would here tapping coming from the
floor</B>
<P><B>boards, and begin to hear footsteps, as if there were someone walking
in</B>
<P><B>the room. all of a sudden the room became cold and I would hear
 whispering</B>
<P><B>coming from the corner of the room, and I would try and forget it but
it</B>
<P><B>seemed to come louder and closer. there was dresser near the door,
and</B>
<P><B>there were many statues and things on there, they would begin to move
from</B>
<P><B>side to side, or move up and down. I would hope it would go, and when
it</B>
<P><B>didn't I would go outside and sleep on the couch.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>This room is not the only room I have experienced these things. In
the back</B>
<P><B>room the same things would happen. I would have the door open and I
would</B>
<P><B>see a white light.. kinda soft light that would float across the room
look</B>
<P><B>out the window and then walk past the bed where I was layin and then
stand</B>
<P><B>in front of the dresser for a few minutes, in front of the Jesus
statue</B>
<P><B>there, and would go.  Sometimes I would see the figure wonder in my</B>
<P><B>grandmother room.. and just stand at the doorway and disappear after
a few</B>
<P><B>minutes. </B>
<P>
<P><B>These things would happen very often. Only two years ago.. when I was
15 a</B>
<P><B>friend and myself went under the house.. to get this suitcase of books
my</B>
<P><B>parents had stored there.  We were looking at the books when my friend
Kaye</B>
<P><B>had noticed a wind blow up outside, when all day there was no wind
at all.</B>
<P><B>Then we both heard whispering coming from the the front of the
house...</B>
<P><B>right under the room I slept in.. and then it became louder, and the
wind</B>
<P><B>blew up even more.. we became frightened when saw a dark figure
coming</B>
<P><B>towards us.. and we ran out the door and outside. it stopped after
we moved</B>
<P><B>outside. I am not the only one who have experienced things like this..
my</B>
<P><B>cousins who stay over a fair bit would experience these things, and
so has</B>
<P><B>my nanna. well she said she saw a white figure standing outside here
door. </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>My mother thinks it would be grandfather, and she might be right. but
it</B>
<P><B>still spooks me out when I go in there cause I experience the same
feelings</B>
<P><B>all the time.  </B>

<P>
<P><B>I would like if my story could be told to let people let them know
they're</B>
<P><B>really not alone. When I was  a child I always was afraid to sleep
with</B>
<P><B>out a lite on. My images would come to me at night. Often I felt I
was</B>
<P><B>never alone someone was always watching me. One night I was sleeping
in</B>
<P><B>my bed,and I heard my door open and I woke up right way. To a great</B>
<P><B>suprise I saw a white figment with glowing red eyes . Long black hair</B>
<P><B>,she was wearing a long white flowing gown.  Fear ran threw my body
I</B>
<P><B>follwed the image in to my closet.  I jump up out of bed and turn on
my</B>
<P><B>light right away. I ran to my closet to see if it was still there.
 But</B>
<P><B>there was nothing, later I found out that I was not the only one who
had</B>
<P><B>seen this ghost. My sister too has seen it. It often sat in my living
room</B>
<P><B>as my sister told me.  After that I had more trouble then ever when
ever I</B>
<P><B>took showers the curtain would slid open, it was more aggresive then
ever</B>
<P><B>things would turn off and on all the time.  Till one night I seen
about</B>
<P><B>enough I was laying in bed and it over look my attic to my eyes I saw</B>
<P><B>eyes looking back at me. I screamed out loud . They where green
glowing</B>
<P><B>eyes . My mom came in and asked me what was wrong and I told her .
More</B>
<P><B>problems came along I would wake up for  reasons being my bed would</B>
<P><B>shake. As I grew older it would haunt me, scare me, torment me .Time
past</B>
<P><B>on my sister and I were living in the house, my mom and me up stairs
,and</B>
<P><B>my sister was married and had bulit an apartment down stairs at that
time</B>
<P><B>she had two childen . One night I woke up to my niece screaming. I
ran down</B>
<P><B>stairs to find that thing had been in the room with them.  My neice
had</B>
<P><B>described it to me .  She told me it looked half goat and half human
like</B>
<P><B>. She had to tell me no more I went to library to look up this beast</B>
<P><B>,to only find out that it was the devils right hand man. After
finding</B>
<P><B>this out I study more in to it we had played with oujie board in the</B>
<P><B>house when I was a teen. But go figure they say its just a game. So
I told</B>
<P><B>my mother and she had me show the picture to my sister and my neice.
My neice she</B>
<P><B>said that was the thing.  My sister and I had asked a pastor to come
in the</B>
<P><B>house and bless the house and ever since then everything was over.
I can sleep at</B>
<P><B>night now .  We ended up ripping apart the apartment downstairs . 
There are</B>
<P><B>ways of keeping things from happening I now have holy water placed
in every</B>
<P><B>room just in case. thank you for your time . Im hoping this will</B>
<P><B>help somebody out there with some what of the same problem. If you
have any</B>
<P><B>? please e-mail me and I would be happy to help someone</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=cont>Cont. from Haunted House I lived In</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By: H2OMyers@webtv.net </B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>I wrote to you the other day, about me growing up in a haunted house.
 I</B>
<P><B>knew I would do this, there are some things I forgot to tell you
about.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A few years ago, my husband joined the Air Force.  At the time, our</B>
<P><B>daughter was just a few months old.  We moved into the house with my
Mom</B>
<P><B>(so that I wouldn't be living alone while my husband was at basic</B>
<P><B>training).  Well, my husband doesn't believe in anything supernatural.
 </B>
<P>
<P><B>On several occasions, I would hear people calling my name.  It is a
very</B>
<P><B>big house (17 rooms, 3 stories).  One occasion, I was in the basement</B>
<P><B>doing laundry, I heard my name being called.  I went upstairs to the</B>
<P><B>kitchen, where my Mom was at.  I asked her "what?" .  She said "what
do</B>
<P><B>you mean what?".  I sad, "well, you called me, what do you want?" 
She</B>
<P><B>told me that she hadn't called my name.  I told her that I heard
someone</B>
<P><B>calling my name.  I kind of dismissed it.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>A couple weeks later, I was in the kitchen.  My Mom had gone to a</B>
<P><B>banquet her office was having.  My husband was asleep in the living
room</B>
<P><B>(where we had kind of set up as a bedroom for us, so we wouldn't have
to</B>
<P><B>move furniture up and down the stairs-plus I didn't want to sleep in
any</B>
<P><B>of the bedrooms).  My daughter was also asleep.  I was going through
the</B>
<P><B>cupboards trying to find something to snack on.  When I heard my</B>
<P><B>husbands voice (coming from the top of the back staircase), saying
my</B>
<P><B>name.  I hadn't heard him up walking around.  So, I listened, thinking
I</B>
<P><B>was just hearing things.  I heard it again.  I went into the living</B>
<P><B>room, without saying anything.  I found him fast asleep in bed.</B>
<P><B>Needless to say, I immediately went to bed.</B>
<P>
<P><B>While we were staying there, I found out that an older man had died
in</B>
<P><B>the master bedroom (it was the uncle of a man my sister had babysat</B>
<P><B>for).  No one was using the bedroom at the time.  We kept it closed
up</B>
<P><B>so the cats wouldn't go in there.  It was connected to the bathroom.</B>
<P><B>One day, my husband was in the bathroom showering or getting cleaned
up,</B>
<P><B>or something like that.  He heard someone in there moving around.
 When</B>
<P><B>he came downstairs, he said "very funny, I know that was you."  I had
no</B>
<P><B>idea what he was talking about.  He told me that he knew I was in the</B>
<P><B>bedroom.  I finally got him to believe that I had been downstairs the</B>
<P><B>whole time.  He then said that one of the cats was probably on the
room.</B>
<P><B>We checked it out and found nothing.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That room had been my sister's room off and on.  She had said that
on</B>
<P><B>several occasions that she had heard voices in that room.  Once, she
had</B>
<P><B>come home from work and decided to take a short nap.  As soon as she</B>
<P><B>started to fall asleep, she heard a male voice yell at her to get up.
 </B>
<P>
<P><B>Everytime I had ever slept in that room, I had felt uneasy and had</B>
<P><B>problems sleeping.  That was before I had found out that someone had</B>
<P><B>died in it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My daughter also noticed things while we were living there.  She
wasn't</B>
<P><B>a year old yet.  She would be in her swing or bouncy seat.  And she</B>
<P><B>would just start laughing, at nothing.  She would also act like she
was</B>
<P><B>watching something.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I thought I would write to add this to my story, since I forgot to
last</B>
<P><B>time I wrote.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  wannemacher.25@osu.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>    Well my family and I have had some weirdo stuff occur at our new
house. </B>
<P><B>I'm currently at college, so I don't know how often some of these
things</B>
<P><B>happen.  Anyway, here's some background on the place.  The house we
live</B>
<P><B>in on the property was built in the 60's I believe.  An older man and
his</B>
<P><B>wife lived there.  She died in the 80's I think, and her ashes were</B>
<P><B>scattered across the property.  The man had cancer, and it grew worse.
</B>
<P><B>He stayed in a hospital bed, where our breakfast booth is, and left
the</B>
<P><B>doors open, letting animals come in and out (we live kind of in the</B>
<P><B>country)  Anyway, he died in that bed, and his family cleaned up the</B>
<P><B>place.  We bought it about a year or so ago from his sister.  My mom
has</B>
<P><B>experienced supernatural things before, she could be sensitive to
this</B>
<P><B>stuff.  Many times she will be watching TV alone at night, sitting
on the</B>
<P><B>floor in front of it.  She'll feel something rub up against her, like
a</B>
<P><B>cat would.  But our cat is nowhere to be seen, and besides he is very</B>
<P><B>vocal.  We've also had things happen with our phones, and I know
spirits</B>
<P><B>like to screw with those.  We have two lines, one regular, and one
for</B>
<P><B>the modem, fax, and the personal use of my brother and I.  On the
first</B>
<P><B>line we have voice mail, and on the second my brother uses the fax's</B>
<P><B>built in answering machine.  The second line was added when we moved
in,</B>
<P><B>and is only on the upper floor.  Sometimes when checking voice mail
on</B>
<P><B>the first line, we'll get a message that is just like a dead line,
but</B>
<P><B>with more static.  It will go on until the system just cuts it off,
about</B>
<P><B>5 minutes.  Many times during the recording, it sounds like someone
is</B>
<P><B>trying to dial out, not with tones, but with the old rotary style
sounds.</B>
<P><B> And the phones were originally rotary in the house, in fact we still</B>
<P><B>have one in our laundry room.  The laundry room will show up later
in my</B>
<P><B>story.  This other phone thing has only happened once so far.  My
mother</B>
<P><B>and I heard the first line ring, then right after the second line
began</B>
<P><B>ringing.  We really didn't feel like answering, so we let them go.
 We</B>
<P><B>heard my brother's answering machine come on, and say it's little
speel,</B>
<P><B>but there was just silence when it came time to record the message.
 No</B>
<P><B>big deal, people don't like answering machines much.  We checked the</B>
<P><B>voice mail message and it was my bro's answering machine</B>
<P><B>message!  Somehow the second line had called the first one and</B>
<P><B>left the answering machine message.  Very kooky, because I don't know
how</B>
<P><B>that could be a system glitch.  Okay, my bedroom is down in the
basement.</B>
<P><B> I have 3 doors in it, one to the laundry room, one to the outside,
and</B>
<P><B>one across from that to the rest of the house.  The laundry room door
is</B>
<P><B>usually open, and many times I'll think I see a dark figure out of
the</B>
<P><B>corner of my eye in there, sometimes in the hallway too.  Creepy, but</B>
<P><B>could be my eyes playing tricks on me.  One night in the summer I had
the</B>
<P><B>outside door open, to get some cool airflow in there.  The door to
the</B>
<P><B>hallway was closed, but not latched.  I was sitting at the end of my
bed,</B>
<P><B>and I felt a strong breeze blow by me as the outside door moved open
a</B>
<P><B>bit more.  About 5 seconds later, I heard a thump and saw the hallway</B>
<P><B>door swing open.  It was like when a cat or dog opens up a door, but</B>
<P><B>there no animals in my room, and the breeze would have opened the door
up</B>
<P><B>quicker, and with out the thump.  I was a little wierded out, but okay.
</B>
<P><B>10 minutes later, I was looking at the little table next to my bed,</B>
<P><B>thinking I needed to clean it up.  I had a pair of those foam yellow</B>
<P><B>earplugs on there, next to each other.  All of a sudden, one just
rolled</B>
<P><B>off on to the floor, there was nothing to have caused it.  I picked
it up</B>
<P><B>and put back in the exact spot, and it stayed right where it was.
 Okay,</B>
<P><B>so it's not scary, but still weird.  The worst thing to happen, of
course</B>
<P><B>happened to me.  It rattled me good.  I was laying in my bed one
night,</B>
<P><B>close to morning, but still dark.  I had woken up for some reason,
but I</B>
<P><B>wasn't completely awake, just laying there with my eyes closed.  I
was</B>
<P><B>laying on my side, back to the hallway door, when I felt something
lay</B>
<P><B>their hands on me and start slowly pulling me across the bed!  My
head</B>
<P><B>was laying normally on the pillow, so if I opened my eyes I could see
who</B>
<P><B>was doing this to me.  But I couldn't open my eyes or move at all.
 I</B>
<P><B>could sort off "see" through my eyelids a large dark figure.  I
couldn't</B>
<P><B>do anything, I tried to scream over and over but nothing came out,
only</B>
<P><B>weak breath.  Finally I eked out a moan, not loud, but it shattered</B>
<P><B>everything it seemed.  I could open my eyes and I sat up.  There was</B>
<P><B>nothing at all in the room, and I turned on the light quickly to look</B>
<P><B>around.  I don't know if this was a crazy waking dream, or a spirit</B>
<P><B>dicking with me.  I couldn't sleep down there the next night, but the
one</B>
<P><B>after I did.  I haven't had anything happen down there since, but we
will</B>
<P><B>see.  I tried taking photographs of the bedroom and area where the
man</B>
<P><B>dies, but nothing has shown up.  Well, thanks for listening to my
story!</B>

</H3><P>
<P><B>By: carijackson@home.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is not a whole story ... In other words, a compositon.  I'm
writing</B>
<P><B>mostly because I'm curious about some things I've experienced in my</B>
<P><B>house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>HISTORY:</B>
<P><B>I've lived in this house for about 3 years now.  It was my
grandmother's</B>
<P><B>house and I am buying it from my father at present.  It's an adobe
brick</B>
<P><B>house and has been in the family since the mid 1950s, about 5 or so</B>
<P><B>years after it was built.</B>
<P>
<P><B>As I said, it was my grandmother's house, as it always has been since
I</B>
<P><B>can remember. Of course she had a husband, as well as children ...</B>
<P><B>however, I was seperated from this side of my family between the ages
of</B>
<P><B>3 and 18 so I never really knew my grandfather and don't associate
the</B>
<P><B>house with anyone but my grandma.  AND not only that but I believe
that</B>
<P><B>she may be the one who is lingering.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My grandmother had a powerful presence during her life and she LOVED</B>
<P><B>this house.  In her last few months, she repeatedly expressed the
desire</B>
<P><B>not to leave it.  She called it "my little house" and was heartbroken</B>
<P><B>when after a few years of rapid deterioration, first physical and
then</B>
<P><B>mental, my father needed to send her to a "home" because she had
become</B>
<P><B>a great burden to care for.  Then she died within two weeks of
leaving</B>
<P><B>... but one of the last things I ever heard her say was, "I miss my</B>
<P><B>little house."  She died of heart failure at the home of a foster
family</B>
<P><B>that cared for elderly patients like her.</B>
<P>
<P><B>MY STORY:</B>
<P><B>About a year after my grandmother's death, I moved into the house
with</B>
<P><B>my son and my dad (who has lived here since well before her death).
 The</B>
<P><B>following are some of the experiences I've had since moving into the</B>
<P><B>house:</B>
<P>
<P><B>1) My first experience occurred a few weeks after moving in.  I was</B>
<P><B>sitting on my bed, talking on the phone, in the late afternoon after</B>
<P><B>coming home from work, when I heard the distinct sound of shuffling</B>
<P><B>footsteps and heavy sighing.  This IS the way my grandmother had</B>
<P><B>sounded, especially in the last few years of her life.  BUT it is
also</B>
<P><B>the way that my father sounds, even now, so I thought nothing of it
at</B>
<P><B>the time.  I just continued my phone conversation and when I was done,
I</B>
<P><B>went to tell him that I was off the phone, since I figured he was</B>
<P><B>sighing impatiently because he needed the phone, but there was nobody</B>
<P><B>home and no evidence that he had been there.  This of course scared
me a</B>
<P><B>little but I was able not to panic by telling myself that he had been</B>
<P><B>there and had just left.  It was not until later that evening that
he</B>
<P><B>said he had never been home that afternoon.</B>
<P>
<P><B>2) Another afternoon, just a little while later, I was at the back
door</B>
<P><B>to the house when I heard the front door shut.  I know it was the
front</B>
<P><B>door because, after checking to see who had come in and finding no
one,</B>
<P><B>I opened and shut every door in the house while the memory was still</B>
<P><B>fresh enough to be clear.</B>
<P>
<P><B>There have been other sounds, but these two instances are the most</B>
<P><B>distinct in my mind since they were the first and therefore the most</B>
<P><B>memorable.</B>
<P>
<P><B>3)  My son may or may not have heard things as well ... he mentioned
a</B>
<P><B>few things, such as scratching on his window at night.  But I have</B>
<P><B>recently had another experience that may discredit that - an acacia</B>
<P><B>beetle was making an eerie noise on my window one night but vanishing</B>
<P><B>each time I lifted the blinds to look out.  On this occassion, I</B>
<P><B>discovered the culprit after sending out my dogs who then came to my</B>
<P><B>window, as they always do to get back in. They then chased the bug
up</B>
<P><B>onto the sill where I could see it.  My son claims to have seen
things</B>
<P><B>though.  Once he said he saw a shadow peeking around the corner at
him</B>
<P><B>while he sat on the couch watching TV.  It was during the day and he
was</B>
<P><B>alone in the house except for one of our dogs, a male german shepard.
He</B>
<P><B>claims to have seen it out of the corner of his eye ... What was
notable</B>
<P><B>about this experience though was the fact that it sent the dog into
a</B>
<P><B>panic.  Whatever it was startled the dog into leaping up and then</B>
<P><B>cowering against my son's leg.  He was shaking and whimpering and
while</B>
<P><B>he's not exactly a guard dog or anything, this is the only time I
know</B>
<P><B>that he has ever done that.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  Darious12@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Okay, so mine isn't really a haunting, but more of an experience. I
like</B>
<P><B>to call it my Angel of Comfort story.</B>
<P><B>I am in a military family and move constantly. One cold winter our</B>
<P><B>family adopted, not on purpose, a cat. She just came in to our house
one</B>
<P><B>night and never left. A precious little girl named Missy Kitty. After</B>
<P><B>traveling with us for about 4 or 5 years we thought she would never</B>
<P><B>leave us. When we finally got to our final home she died an old lady.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The experience is this. When we went to the pet cemetary to bury her,
it</B>
<P><B>was assumed you just find a spot and dig it up and bury your loved
pet.</B>
<P><B>My mother did this and soon after the cat was burried, a young man
in a</B>
<P><B>uniform approached her. His exact words to her were, "don't be sad,
she</B>
<P><B>is in a good place now. She is happy and well taken care of. She was
a</B>
<P><B>good cat and now she is in a better place. She is happy where she is</B>
<P><B>now. God is with her."</B>
<P>
<P><B>After my mother gave him a hug and and cried on his shoulder for a
bit,</B>
<P><B>he turned around and left. He made my mother feel comforted and took
the</B>
<P><B>saddness away. When my mother turned around to catch him and thank
him,</B>
<P><B>he was gone, just vanished into thin air. She drove up to the front</B>
<P><B>office and asked about the young man and they said they had no clue
who</B>
<P><B>whe was talking about.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=1st>Evil on the 1st Floor</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By: Tarianna@theshadowlands.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>   When I was 4 we rented a farm house in Iowa,  The farm was worked
by the</B>
<P><B>landlord.  The house was old.  I have no history or knowledge if the
house is</B>
<P><B>still there.  I do know that the doors would never stay shut and the
basement</B>
<P><B>was avoided by my whole family.  There was a sense of evil there so
we locked</B>
<P><B>the door outside leading to the basement, and the basement door inside.
 The</B>
<P><B>indoor basement door was found open most mornings although the door
had been</B>
<P><B>locked by a key and the key was in my parents room!</B>
<P><B>    Another strange incident in that house was footsteps walking around
the</B>
<P><B>1st floor at night.  Since we all slept on the 2nd floor this rarely
disturbed</B>
<P><B>us.  Although on occassion, there was a need to go downstairs in the
middle of</B>
<P><B>the night.  Anyone venturing down would encounter a shadow that would
lurk in</B>
<P><B>the corners of the room and follow you from room to room no matter
how bright</B>
<P><B>the lights were. Years later after we had moved to town, the farmhouse
was</B>
<P><B>gutted by fire.  Many people driving out that direction later claimed
to have</B>
<P><B>seen a white flowing woman leaning out the 2nd story window.  Although
the</B>
<P><B>house was empty at the time of the fire and the only presence we felt
in the</B>
<P><B>house when we lived there seemed to be male.</B>
<P><B>Believe it or not!!!!</B>
