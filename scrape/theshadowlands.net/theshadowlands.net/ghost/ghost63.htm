MOVED OUT. I ALWAYS HAD THE "FEELING" OF ANOTHER PRESENCE...BUT NOT A VIOLENT
ONE. OUR FAMILY HAD ACCEPTED SIGHTINGS OF "APPARITIONS" OUT OF THE CORNER
OF OUR EYES AS COMMONPLACE. IT WAS WHEN I WAS SITTING IN THEIR ROOM ONE NIGHT
WATCHING TV THAT CHILLED ME TO THE BONE. MY PARENTS HAD JUST CALLED, AND
ASKED HOW I WAS GETTING ALONG WITH THE "GHOSTS." I HAD LAUGHED AND SAID "FINE"
OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. MINUTES AFTER I HUNG UP, THE LAMP SHADE ON MY
FATHER'S DESK MADE AN ALARMING SHIFT...TURNING ALMOST COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN.
I WAS LITERALLY FROZEN IN THE CHAIR. MAYBE HE/SHE WANTED TO MAKE SURE I WASN'T
COMPLETELY ALONE THAT NIGHT.</b>
</p><p><b>THE SECOND OCCURRED IN FLORIDA, WHERE MY PARENTS BUILT A HOUSE ON THE
GROUNDS OF AN OLD RESORT HOTEL THAT HAD BEEN DEMOLISHED YEARS EARLIER. IN
THE 20'S IT WAS *THE* PLACE TO BE, FOR PARTIES AND HOB-NOBBING WITH THE ELITE.
I VISTED MY PARENTS FOR A WEEKEND A FEW YEARS BACK, AND WENT TO BED FOR THE
EVENING. AS I TRIED TO LULL MYSELF TO SLEEP IN AN UNFAMILIAR BED, I NOTICED
A LIGHT PASSING UNDER THE DOOR AND THE DISTINCT SCENT OF A FLORAL PERFUME.
WHEN I GOT UP THE NEXT MORNING I ASKED MY MOTHER WHAT SHE WAS DOING UP SO
LATE. SHE CLAIMED SHE WAS FASTASLEEP AT THIS HOUR (AROUND 1AM). WHEN I ASKED
TO SMELL HER PERFUME...WE WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE COLLECTION. NARY A FLORAL
SCENT TO BE FOUND. I WONDER IF SOME BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IS STILL LOOKING FOR
THAT LAST GREAT PARTY...IN A DARK HALLWAY OF MY PARENT'S NEW HOME.</b>

<h3><b><a name="atlas">Atlas Theater</a></b>
</h3><p><b>By:mechelma@greeley.sykes.com</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>I lived in Cheyenne, Wyoming for many years and worked with the</b>
</p><p><b>community theater company there on many occaisions.  The theater
company</b>
</p><p><b>did productions in the Atlas theater located in old downtown Cheyenne</b>
</p><p><b>during the summer Frontier Days celebration and put on a haunted
house</b>
</p><p><b>there in October for Halloween.  Both productions are used to raise</b>
</p><p><b>money for restoration of the theater.  My first experience with a</b>
</p><p><b>haunting was during the Haunted House production in 1993.</b>
</p><p><b>The top floor of the Theater is off limits because it is considered
to</b>
</p><p><b>be dangerous and they don't want people to get hurt.  The floors are
old</b>
</p><p><b>and has holes, and there aren't any lights.  It is possible to see
up</b>
</p><p><b>into the third floor from the second floor from an open area balcony</b>
</p><p><b>located in the middle of the building.  You must keep in mind that
the</b>
</p><p><b>theater used to be a hotel/brothel when it was first built.  There
are</b>
</p><p><b>many rooms up on the 2nd and 3rd floor which were used by the "women"
of</b>
</p><p><b>the time.  For Halloween, the theater company decorates each room on
the</b>
</p><p><b>2nd floor as a different horrific scene and then takes people on
tours</b>
</p><p><b>through it.  It's usually fairly generic, but fun.  I belive it was</b>
</p><p><b>three days before Halloween and I was playing one of the characters
in</b>
</p><p><b>the haunted house which had fallen off the balcony to her death.  I
was</b>
</p><p><b>to lay on the floor as if I was dead and then when they brought a
group</b>
</p><p><b>of people through I was supposed to get up and move towards them as
if I</b>
</p><p><b>was a ghost.  From where I was laying on the floor I could easily see
up</b>
</p><p><b>to the 3rd floor.  About half way through the night I was laying on
my</b>
</p><p><b>back staring up and I could clearly see what looked to be a woman's</b>
</p><p><b>figure dressed in a long green dress wearing a hat.  It shocked me
at</b>
</p><p><b>first because I knew no one was allowed on the upper floor.  There
were</b>
</p><p><b>some people in the room next to me and I whispered to them to look
up at</b>
</p><p><b>the balcony.  They said they could see the woman as well.  We called
out</b>
</p><p><b>to the woman, but she didn't answer and she never moved.  Even some</b>
</p><p><b>people in the groups that went through made comments about her as
well</b>
</p><p><b>though we never pointed her out to anyone.  Eventually one of the</b>
</p><p><b>directors went up stairs to make sure no one there.  He said he went</b>
</p><p><b>through all the rooms and couldn't find anyone. After about an hour
or</b>
</p><p><b>so the woman dissapeared.  It was eerie.  The second experience was</b>
</p><p><b>during a summer performance of the melodrama in 1994.  I was
performing</b>
</p><p><b>in the play as well as helping out with the tech work on the show</b>
</p><p><b>occaisionally.  A bunch of my friends were on the tech crew.  It was</b>
</p><p><b>July and the theater company does performances all month through
August.</b>
</p><p><b>Everything gets locked up at night after each performance so that no
one</b>
</p><p><b>can get in until the next evening and the director and tech director
are</b>
</p><p><b>the only ones with a key.</b>
</p><p><b>One evening during Frontier Days we had all the lights and props set
up</b>
</p><p><b>for the next days performance and had locked up the light board as
well.</b>
</p><p><b>The next day we went in to the theater and had found that all the
props</b>
</p><p><b>had been moved and all the lights were rearranged as if someone had
put</b>
</p><p><b>on a totally different show.  No one had been in the theater all
evening</b>
</p><p><b>or that morning.  There was no explanation for the changes to the
lights</b>
</p><p><b>or any of the props being moved.  Some of the people on the tech crew</b>
</p><p><b>said that they had thought they felt a presence up in the balcony
area</b>
</p><p><b>of the theater occaisionaly and they still believe that a ghost
haunts</b>
</p><p><b>the upstairs.       </b>

<h3><b><a name="room">My Brother's Room</a></b>
</h3><p><b>By:   Amour8@aol.com</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>When I was 7 years old we moved to a new house in East Aurora NY.The
house we</b>
</p><p><b>lived in was made into 3 apartments &lt;we lived on the top floor&gt;.
The only way</b>
</p><p><b>to get into the attic was through my closet. There was a space through
the</b>
</p><p><b>ceiling but it was all boarded up and we never went up there. Anyway
I had</b>
</p><p><b>always been fearless of pretty much anything, especially as a little
kid but a</b>
</p><p><b>few months later I started to get very frightened when I was in bed.
We had a</b>
</p><p><b>night light for my baby brother but I would get these haunting
feelings</b>
</p><p><b>everytime I looked towards the closet. I hated it because I felt that
way</b>
</p><p><b>everynight. I remember a while after this started happening my older
brother</b>
</p><p><b>told me that ghosts would come through his closet and talk to him.</b>
</p><p><b>I thought may be he was just saying that to try and scare me but I
was wrong.</b>
</p><p><b>One night my brother had left to go to a friends house &lt;which I
was unaware</b>
</p><p><b>of&gt; my mom and I were on the couch folding laundry and she told
me to go put</b>
</p><p><b>my brothers laundry in his room. I opened his door and saw what I thought
was</b>
</p><p><b>him with his back turned to me looking out the window, I called his
name</b>
</p><p><b>several times but he wouldn't answer me. I was mad and told my mom
he was</b>
</p><p><b>ignoring me. She gave me an odd look and told me he had left an hour
ago to a</b>
</p><p><b>friend's house. I know that what I saw was real. When I was 12 I went
and did</b>
</p><p><b>some reaseach on the house, It is over a 100 years old and an undertaker
used</b>
</p><p><b>to live there and he would sometimes keep the corpse in the attic.
Thank god</b>
</p><p><b>we were on the process of moving out when I did this research.</b>

<h3><b><a name="parker">Parker Estate Apparition</a></b>
</h3><p><b>By: GolfGar4@aol.com</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>This is an experience I had in 1969 in Janesville, WI.  I was home
from</b>
</p><p><b>college and was driving on old County F, which at the time had become</b>
</p><p><b>something of an abandoned road in town.  I was with a young lady, we
were just</b>
</p><p><b>driving around and talking when we drew near the old Parker Estate,
a large</b>
</p><p><b>deserted mansion that sat up on a hill a fair distance back from the
road.  </b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>As we were driving by the main gates to the mansion, I saw something
dart in</b>
</p><p><b>front of the car.  I wasn't sure what it was, but my companion had
seen it as</b>
</p><p><b>well.  A few seconds later we both heard a thump, which made me think
we had</b>
</p><p><b>hit whatever it was that we'd seen.  We stopped and got out of the
car to see</b>
</p><p><b>what we had hit and if it was hurt...but there was nothing anywhere
around,</b>
</p><p><b>neither in the road nor in the nearby ditches.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>I decided to get a flashlight out of the trunk and have a look around.
 Once I</b>
</p><p><b>had the light, I glanced up to the hilltop near the mansion.  I saw
a man's</b>
</p><p><b>silhouette standing alongside a tree at the top of the hill.  The man
was</b>
</p><p><b>backlit but his shape was clearly visible.  I flashed my light at him,
but</b>
</p><p><b>there was no one standing there.  When I moved the light away from
him, the</b>
</p><p><b>silhouette was once again visible.  I did this two or three more times,
moving</b>
</p><p><b>the light on and off the figure, each time you could see the man when
the</b>
</p><p><b>light was not shining on him but when it was, all you could see was
the tree.</b>
</p><p><b>The tree was not large enough to hide a person, and he could not possible
have</b>
</p><p><b>ducked out of the beam of my flashlight quickly enough.  I asked my
companion</b>
</p><p><b>if she saw what I was seeing, and she said that she saw the man too.
 I am</b>
</p><p><b>certain that it was a man, and not a bush or a tree or something that
merely</b>
</p><p><b>resembled a man.  It was about that time that we decided to get the
hell out</b>
</p><p><b>of Dodge.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>As I turned to open the driver's side door, I looked down at the left
rear</b>
</p><p><b>fender and saw clearly an elongated handprint, as if someone had reached
up</b>
</p><p><b>from ground level and slapped their hand against the car while it was
in</b>
</p><p><b>motion.  This handprint had not been there earlier in the evening.
 My</b>
</p><p><b>companion and I got into the car and left in a hurry.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>I am not aware of anyone else having seen or heard anything unusual
at the old</b>
</p><p><b>Parker estate, but this experience definitely qualifies as "unusual"
in my</b>
</p><p><b>mind.</b>

<h3><b><a name="jersey">Haunted House In New Jersey</a></b>
</h3><p><b>By: cslate@garden.net</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>I grew up in a haunted house located in Flanders </b>
</p><p><b>N.J. My father purchased the house in 1966, it had not been lived in
for quite </b>
</p><p><b>some time. Some of the things that started to occur in the beginning
; My father </b>
</p><p><b>was sanding the bedroom floor, heard who he thought was my mother running
up the </b>
</p><p><b>hallway staircase. He yelled out to her, noone was there. He felt someone
was </b>
</p><p><b>watching him when he returned to the bedroom. Another day he heard
what sounded </b>
</p><p><b>like footsteps running back and forth the attic. He stuck his head
up into the </b>
</p><p><b>attic and saw nothing, it was sealed with no windows. The house was
built in the </b>
</p><p><b>1700s. After he had gotten a couple of the rooms finished upstairs,
my mother </b>
</p><p><b>and I joined him staying in two of the bedrooms that were complete.
My father </b>
</p><p><b>never told my mother what had happened up to that point since he did'nt
want to </b>
</p><p><b>upset her. He is a musician, so he left for work around 7:30 in the
evening. </b>
</p><p><b>When he got home after 2:00am, my mother had all the lights on. She
told him we </b>
</p><p><b>are not alone. She had heard someone sigh in the room. Another night
my father </b>
</p><p><b>was getting ready for work, he looked in the mirror to comb his hair
and saw a </b>
</p><p><b>figure of an old man dressed in black sitting in his windsor rocker.
The man had </b>
</p><p><b>white hair the face was blurry. Looking bacck I remember my sister
who was born </b>
</p><p><b>while we lived there speaking in a language I didn't understand while
she was </b>
</p><p><b>sleeping. Perhaps the oddest part of the story was one night when my
father was </b>
</p><p><b>asleep on the couch my mother in the upstairs bedroom with my sister
and I in </b>
</p><p><b>the other two upstairs bedrooms. My father was asleep when he felt
a pressure on </b>
</p><p><b>his chest, like someone taking there hands in pressing down. He couldn't
wake up </b>
</p><p><b>at that moment, but when he finally did he assumed it was one of our
cats. He </b>
</p><p><b>then saw that all four were asleep locked up in the inside back porch.
Well, the </b>
</p><p><b>next day at the breakfast table my mother said to him she felt something
weird </b>
</p><p><b>had happened the night before. My father asked what she meant, not
telling her </b>
</p><p><b>what he experienced and she said the same thing about the pressure
on her chest. </b>
</p><p><b>The phone rang a short time later, our neighbor down the street who
had a </b>
</p><p><b>telescope in his window had seen some strange lights over our house,
he through </b>
</p><p><b>on a jacket but before he could come over our place they vanished.
I remember </b>
</p><p><b>years later that I felt that same feeling, waking up to a bright white
light and </b>
</p><p><b>a very strange feeling like something had happened at the house. I
was young at </b>
</p><p><b>the time, so it took some time to figure out that it was probably that
same </b>
</p><p><b>night that this had all happened. It was such a profound experience
to me that I </b>
</p><p><b>remember getting on the schoolbus the next morning and telling this
girl who </b>
</p><p><b>lived up the hill from us about how strange I felt the night before
that </b>
</p><p><b>something had happened. I recall feeling numb, like I couldn't wake
up. bright </b>
</p><p><b>white lights. Now was this in fact a UFO that had nothing to do with
the fact </b>
</p><p><b>that that the house was haunted or were they somehow linked together?
There had </b>
</p><p><b>been UFO sightings in the area before, my father and I having seen
things in </b>
</p><p><b>broad daylight on a couple occassions. Anyway my parents divorced in
1973, the </b>
</p><p><b>house was sold in 1974, My parents never told the people who bought
the house </b>
</p><p><b>about the fact that strange things had happened. They told us a couple
months </b>
</p><p><b>later when we invited them to a party that weird things had been happening
and </b>
</p><p><b>they knew they were not alone. The house was sold this year, since
the husband </b>
</p><p><b>had died. His wife never told the new people about anything, but they
have told </b>
</p><p><b>a neighbor they had heard a ringing sound like a bell or something
that they </b>
</p><p><b>couldn't locate, so the story continues.</b>

</p><p>
</p><p><b>This story took place in a house that me and my family lived in when
I</b>
</p><p><b>was a young girl. The house was over 100 years old and when we moved
in</b>
</p><p><b>my father had to do alot of work on it.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>While tearing out a wall seperating the kichen and the stairway
leading</b>
</p><p><b>up stairs,</b>
</p><p><b>he found an old necklace hanging  on a board inside the wall. We took</b>
</p><p><b>the necklace to a jewler becouse there was writing on the clasp . The</b>
</p><p><b>jewler told us that the stamp on the clasp  was from an old jewler
in</b>
</p><p><b>Ireland, dating back at least 100 years. He also said that it was an
old</b>
</p><p><b>custom back then to hide something in the stucture of newly built
houses</b>
</p><p><b>to bring good luck to the owners and keep bad spirits away. My father</b>
</p><p><b>gave me the necklace when we sold the house some years later . Well</b>
</p><p><b>anyway to get to the point of this story , after finding  the
necklace</b>
</p><p><b>and finishing the work in the house. Some family members started
hearing</b>
</p><p><b>things when one of us were in the house alone. At first we just
chalked</b>
</p><p><b>it up to noises in an old house, but there was this one bedroom
upstairs</b>
</p><p><b>, the only bedroom on the back side of the house ,well my father
didn't</b>
</p><p><b>get to fixing that room up right away becouse it was always so cold
in</b>
</p><p><b>there .So we used it for a storage room for many years. Untill my
mother</b>
</p><p><b>got the great idea to redo the room for me. Well she put shag carpet
in</b>
</p><p><b>it and beads on the closet door you know teenagers room. That room</b>
</p><p><b>always kinda gave me the creeps for some reason ,but to please my
mother</b>
</p><p><b>I made it my domain. When I would be sleeping in the middle of the
night</b>
</p><p><b>I would wake up and have this great  feeling that there was something
in</b>
</p><p><b>there with me . I would go running into my sisters room as fast as
I</b>
</p><p><b>could in the pitch dark and as I was running I would here my name
being</b>
</p><p><b>whispered in my ear in a long dragged out manner. I don't mind
telling</b>
</p><p><b>you It scared the hell out of me. I started sleeping with my sister
more</b>
</p><p><b>and more until I just didn't use the room at all. Later on my mother</b>
</p><p><b>started caring for some elderly people and she gave my room to one
of</b>
</p><p><b>the women named  Marie.  she always slept  with the doorshut at night</b>
</p><p><b>because some of the other ladies would snore and keep her awake. One</b>
</p><p><b>morning at breakfest she was conplaining that she didn't get much
sleep</b>
</p><p><b>due to the snoring . My mother asked her why didn't you close your
door</b>
</p><p><b>as you always have . She said well Mrs.Kluge I didn't want to say</b>
</p><p><b>anything but I sometimes hear voices in the room at night.</b>
</p><p><b>Well not long after that I was sleeping  in my sisters room and I
heard</b>
</p><p><b>this young  womens voice singing this happy kinda lulluby  in the
hall</b>
</p><p><b>way . It was loud too . It woke me up out of a sound sleep. The next</b>
</p><p><b>thing I know I here my door start squeeking open and my heart was</b>
</p><p><b>racing. It was my mother , she popped her head in and asked me if I
had</b>
</p><p><b>heard that too . </b>
</p><p><b>she checked all the  women and they   were sound asleep. We started</b>
</p><p><b>asking around to some of the old neighbors and found out that a young</b>
</p><p><b>women , a relative of one of the neighbors had died in that very</b>
</p><p><b>roomwhile during child birth .We still continued to hear stuff in the</b>
</p><p><b>house but we're not as afraid as we were before . I felt sorry for
the</b>
</p><p><b>lost soul . She must be looking for  her child. Thats it . It's kinda</b>

<h3><b><a name="most">A Most Fascinating Experience</a></b>
</h3><p><b>By: Jennifer@theshadowlands.net</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>I originally discovered this house through a friend of mine who was
looking</b>
</p><p><b>for a house to rent, and when she saw this one, it scared the hell
out of</b>
</p><p><b>her.  She told me that she heard a voice say to her, "Get out!".  So
of</b>
</p><p><b>course when she told me about this, I HAD to see it!  I told another
ghost</b>
</p><p><b>hunter friend of mine about it, and he immediately leased it for
himself.</b>
</p><p><b>We went to have a look.  The first time we walked up the driveway,
we both</b>
</p><p><b>felt like we were being watched.  When we walked inside the house,
we both</b>
</p><p><b>felt like we weren't alone, but that the ghosts were somehow scared
of us,</b>
</p><p><b>and had retreated away. (Sounds weird, I know)  One of them was
definitely</b>
</p><p><b>a woman, and I felt a masculine presence as well.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>The house was built in the late 20's, early 30's.  Some of the
original</b>
</p><p><b>stained glass and woodwork was still there, but most of the wood
floors</b>
</p><p><b>were carpeted over.  The upstairs was a complete home.  It had 3
bedrooms,</b>
</p><p><b>3 bathrooms, an office, kitchen, laundry room and a huge living room
with a</b>
</p><p><b>balcony off of it.  The basement was completely separate from the
upstairs.</b>
</p><p><b> It had 2 bedrooms, a huge bathroom, small kitchen, laundry room, a
living</b>
</p><p><b>room with huge wet bar and a wood floor. (Great for parties!) The
weird</b>
</p><p><b>part is, you couldn't get upstairs from the basement without going
outside</b>
</p><p><b>the house!  There was also a maids quarters.  It was just a room with
a</b>
</p><p><b>bathroom and small kitchenette.  You couldn't get anywhere else in
the</b>
</p><p><b>house from that room either.  The garage was the same way, completely
shut</b>
</p><p><b>off from the rest of the house, even though it was part of the house.
 The</b>
</p><p><b>maid's quarters had a small door that led to a crawl space underneath
the</b>
</p><p><b>house.  There was also a crawl space above the wet bar in the
basement.</b>
</p><p><b>(This is where my friend heard the ghost say to him; "Get out")  And
a</b>
</p><p><b>crawl space in the garage.  There was even a hidden space behind a
closet</b>
</p><p><b>wall in the hall of the upper floor of the house.  There wasn't anything
in</b>
</p><p><b>that one, we figured that stairs leading to the basement had once
been</b>
</p><p><b>there, and when they took them out, it left a space.  The space in
the</b>
</p><p><b>garage was left uninvestigated, and we never investigated the ceiling
crawl</b>
</p><p><b>space because the house is pretty old, and it didn't look like it
could</b>
</p><p><b>support much weight.  We shined a flashlight in it a few times, but
really</b>
</p><p><b>couldn't see anything but wires.  The crawl space in the maid's
quarters</b>
</p><p><b>was, I must admit, a bit scary.  It looked like there were trenches
under</b>
</p><p><b>the house.  I don't know anything about building houses, so these
trenches</b>
</p><p><b>could have contained electrical wiring or the water pipes.  There
were</b>
</p><p><b>quite possibly rats in there, too.  So neither one of us ventured very
far</b>
</p><p><b>into it.  We did, however, go far enough into the crawl space to find
some</b>
</p><p><b>old 1970's pornographic magazines. ;) But that was about it.  </b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Over the years, the house had been renovated quite a bit by people
who</b>
</p><p><b>didn't have any style or taste whatsoever, and I said to my friend,
"You</b>
</p><p><b>can tell this house was once beautiful, but someone really screwed
it up."</b>
</p><p><b>All of a sudden, it was like someone opened a flood gate!  It was the</b>
</p><p><b>female ghost.  I could feel her right next to me, and I suddenly felt
like</b>
</p><p><b>my hand was being pulled from room to room.  In each room, I was
being</b>
</p><p><b>"shown" what the room originally looked like.  I would look into the
room,</b>
</p><p><b>and then a second later, get a picture of what it looked like when
she</b>
</p><p><b>lived there.  This went on for about 15 minutes.  I thanked her for
showing</b>
</p><p><b>me her house, and as strange as it may sound, I felt as if I'd made
a real</b>
</p><p><b>connection with this spirit.  From then on, every time I went to that</b>
</p><p><b>house, I got a very welcome feeling.  She was always very
communicative</b>
</p><p><b>with us.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>In the kitchen pantry, there were 2 bins, I said to my friend, "I
wonder</b>
</p><p><b>what these are for?"  Before the words were out of my mouth, I got
a</b>
</p><p><b>picture of 1 bin filled with rice and the other filled with dried
beans!</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Both my friend and I kept thinking of a diamond necklace, we both
thought</b>
</p><p><b>it was in a cabinet off of the master bedroom.  So we took it apart,</b>
</p><p><b>looking for the necklace.  As we were taking it apart, my friend said
to</b>
</p><p><b>me, "I wonder what this room was used for."  In my mind I heard,
`It's a</b>
</p><p><b>sitting room, STUPID!', and I said to him, "It's a sitting room." 
He said,</b>
</p><p><b>"Go ahead and say it."  "What?"  "STUPID!"  He said it just like I
heard it</b>
</p><p><b>in my mind!  We never found the necklace, but we found an old perfume</b>
</p><p><b>bottle and an old medicine bottle.  We thought it best just to put
them</b>
</p><p><b>back as we found them.   </b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Later on, my friend and I were in the kitchen talking.  All of a sudden,
I</b>
</p><p><b>heard, in a most shocked and alarming voice, "What are you doing
wearing</b>
</p><p><b>pants!?"  I then explained to her that women now were able to wear
pants.</b>
</p><p><b>I got the feeling she was very confused and upset by this, it turns
out</b>
</p><p><b>that she had no concept of time.  She had been trapped in that house
for</b>
</p><p><b>quite a while!  </b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>A few nights later, we decided to sit in the living room with the
lights</b>
</p><p><b>off and just see what happens.  There was light from the street coming
in</b>
</p><p><b>through the windows, so it wasn't totally black.  After sitting for
maybe</b>
</p><p><b>2-3 minutes, we saw a purple orb in the opposite corner of the room.
 It</b>
</p><p><b>was about the size of a basketball, and if you looked straight at it,
you</b>
</p><p><b>could just barely see it.  But if you looked away, and watched it from
the</b>
</p><p><b>corner of your eye, you could see it quite clearly.  I put my hand
out,</b>
</p><p><b>hoping it would come closer, but it never did.  It just bobbed around
in</b>
</p><p><b>the opposite corner of the room.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>My friend then decided to take pictures inside of the house.  He got
a</b>
</p><p><b>disposable camera and took 24 pictures.  When he got the film
developed,</b>
</p><p><b>what he saw was absolutely amazing!   There were 5 pictures with
small</b>
</p><p><b>floating white orbs.  On a couple of them, there was what looked like</b>
</p><p><b>stretched cotton, like they make the Halloween spider webs from, in
the top</b>
</p><p><b>left corner.  (My friend kept the pictures, and I've since lost touch
with</b>
</p><p><b>him, otherwise I would have loved to have sent them in for you to
see!)</b>
</p><p><b>Some of the pictures were blurred, but only in part of the picture.
 As if</b>
</p><p><b>part of the picture were out of focus, but the rest of the picture
was</b>
</p><p><b>fine.  I'd never heard of that happening before.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>The basement is where the male ghost mostly hung out.  I remember
looking</b>
</p><p><b>around down there, and opening a closet door.  I was immediately hit
with a</b>
</p><p><b>blast of cold air, and I got a picture of the Grim Reaper.  I wanted
to</b>
</p><p><b>laugh!  It was as scary as a little kid with a sheet over his head,
saying</b>
</p><p><b>"BOO!".  I said `Hello' to him, and let him know that we weren't going
to</b>
</p><p><b>hurt him, that we just wanted to look around.  He seemed to calm down
a</b>
</p><p><b>little, but was still upset at the intrusion.  My friend told me that
while</b>
</p><p><b>he was in one part of the basement, and I was in another, he heard
this one</b>
</p><p><b>say in a very low whisper, "Get out".  Although I always felt his
presence,</b>
</p><p><b>he pretty much left us alone.  </b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>There was only one incident that was actually scary.  Evidently, while
my</b>
</p><p><b>friend was away for the weekend, some people had broken into part of
the</b>
</p><p><b>house.  (There was a shed that was attached to the house, but you could
not</b>
</p><p><b>enter the house from inside of it.  There was a small door that led
to</b>
</p><p><b>another crawl space underneath the house.)  They must have been
screwing</b>
</p><p><b>around with a Ouija board or something, because there was a new
presence.</b>
</p><p><b>I kept getting the impression of hands around my neck and choking.
 I said</b>
</p><p><b>to my friend that I didn't like this presence.  He said, "Me neither,
it</b>
</p><p><b>keeps saying `choke her, choke the bitch'"  We decided to go out for
a cup</b>
</p><p><b>of coffee!  We got half way down the block, and I still felt this
presence.</b>
</p><p><b> So did my friend.  He was able to get rid of it.  I never asked him
how he</b>
</p><p><b>did it, but I never felt the presence of that one again!</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Every once in a while, we would see the ghost of a small child run
down the</b>
</p><p><b>upstairs hall.  It happened maybe 2-3 times.  We asked the female
ghost</b>
</p><p><b>about it, she didn't want to let the child go.  It was comforting to
her.</b>
</p><p><b>&gt;From there, we found that the male ghost was holding the female
ghost in</b>
</p><p><b>the house.  One night, we were able to get her to let go of the child</b>
</p><p><b>ghost.  After that night, we never saw it again.  And we never heard
the</b>
</p><p><b>very faint child's cry again, either.  We then went to work on setting
the</b>
</p><p><b>female ghost free.  I'm not honestly sure if we ever accomplished this.
 We</b>
</p><p><b>got her to a point where she was able to leave.  But I have always
felt</b>
</p><p><b>that she wanted to stay there for some reason.  Unfortunately, this
is</b>
</p><p><b>where the story ends.  Both my friend and I got busy with other things.
 He</b>
</p><p><b>had a short lease on the place, and when that was up, he moved to
another</b>
</p><p><b>city, we lost touch after that.  We never were able to help the male
ghost.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>I did drive by the place not too long ago.  I told another friend about
it,</b>
</p><p><b>and we just drove by and stopped on the street in front of it.  She
swore</b>
</p><p><b>she saw something in one of the windows.  I didn't </b>

</h3><p><b>By:  dcote@hawk.igs.net</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>This is my first time checking out this site, so I thought I'd share
an</b>
</p><p><b>experience I had back in 1986.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>My aunt had just passed away after a very long, painful illness with</b>
</p><p><b>cancer.  We were very close, and had been so since the day I was
born.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>One day, very shortly after her death, I was at a very important
meeting</b>
</p><p><b>downtown.  I had parked my car in an elaborate underground parking</b>
</p><p><b>structure.  As I had been to this building many times, I was
comfortable</b>
</p><p><b>and familiar with the building and the parking structure, so I had
no</b>
</p><p><b>reason to be concerned manouvering my car inside the area.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>After a long meeting, I took the elevator down to the level where I
was</b>
</p><p><b>parked.  I got into my car, put my briefcase in the back seat, and</b>
</p><p><b>started to put the key in the ignition.  I should point out that I
had</b>
</p><p><b>nothing of my aunt's in the car, nor had she driven in it for quite</b>
</p><p><b>awhile as she had been in the hospital for months.  As I went to
start</b>
</p><p><b>the car, I had a distinct feeling of her presence, most particularly
her</b>
</p><p><b>smell.  My aunt did not wear perfume, but always had a pleasant smell
of</b>
</p><p><b>clean soap, a smell I had come to know very well during my lifetime.</b>
</p><p><b>The sense of her smell and presence was so strong, that I was sure
that</b>
</p><p><b>if I turned my head, I would see her sitting in the passenger seat!</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>The feeling that she was with me in the car gave me a sense of great</b>
</p><p><b>peace, I was not afraid.  I backed out of the parking spot and
proceeded</b>
</p><p><b>to drive towards the exit.  There was a curve to get up to the next</b>
</p><p><b>level, for which I had the right of way and the cars coming from the</b>
</p><p><b>left had a stop sign.  As I came to the curve (which I would have</b>
</p><p><b>normally just proceeded through) I heard her voice clearly say
STOP!!!</b>
</p><p><b>I slammed on the brakes, and just as I did so, a car came through the</b>
</p><p><b>stop sign and sped past me at high speed.  Had I not stopped, I would</b>
</p><p><b>have been right in the centre of the curve and the car would surely
have</b>
</p><p><b>slammed into me broadside!  As the space was very small around the</b>
</p><p><b>curve, I would also have been crushed into the steel structure
itself.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>I have always remembered that day, and not told too many people about</b>
</p><p><b>it.  There have been other times that I have felt her presence, even
to</b>
</p><p><b>this day, but I do believe that that day, she saved my life.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Thanks for letting me tell my story.</b>

</b>
</p><p><b>i've had occurences i've never (thank god) had a sighting yet in my
</b>
</p><p><b>life!</b>
</p><p><b>the second house my family lived in was not a very old house, maybe
</b>
</p><p><b>30yrs old at the most. we moved in when i was 11. it started off with
a </b>
</p><p><b>horrible stench in my room. previous to me the room was unoccupied.
the </b>
</p><p><b>door almost always locked and a tear in the screen for the cats to
come </b>
</p><p><b>in and out. it was the cats room! steam cleaning and perfumes only
made </b>
</p><p><b>the horrid, almost skunklike stench worse. the winter after we moved
in </b>
</p><p><b>my father was away for a month on buisness. my mother was up late </b>
</p><p><b>wallpapering, and she heard one of us get up, walk down the hall, go
</b>
</p><p><b>into the bathroom and then back down the hall. she thought nothing
of it </b>
</p><p><b>until a short while later it happened again so she went into the hall
to </b>
</p><p><b>check who it was. there was no one there! around the same time my sister
</b>
</p><p><b>began having nightmares of a woman she'd never seen before scream and
</b>
</p><p><b>curse at her! her dreams concerned her and upset her as she was only
10! </b>
</p><p><b>after my father returned from buisness he was awoken suddenly one night
</b>
</p><p><b>to hear 2 people on the stairs (just outside his room) he laid quietly
</b>
</p><p><b>in bed and saw a woman and man enter the room then leave. he woke my

</p><p><b>mother who had to check the house, and she of course found nothing.
he </b>
</p><p><b>still was quite shaken and made her call the police, who arrived and

</p><p><b>The Little Man:</b>
</p><p><b>my mother told me the story of the ghost in my grandparents house,

<h3><b><a name="friend">Imaginary Friend or Not?</a></b>
</h3><p><b>BY:   IM7HEAVEN@aol.com</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>My Husband,son and I was invited to a get  together from an associate
at my</b>
</p><p><b>husbands work. The people there, was from their work of course.</b>
</p><p><b>The friend who's house we was at ,had a little </b>
</p><p><b>girl around my son's age..,5-6yrs.old.</b>
</p><p><b>It was a cookout  party and all of us was mostly outside. When at one
point I</b>
</p><p><b>noticed my son and our friends daughter was not outside. So.,We went
looking</b>
</p><p><b>for them. When we went inside hunting for them..,we finally found them
screaming and </b>
</p><p><b>banging on the</b> <b>attic door.(there was a door with steps leading
to their attic just like a</b>
</p><p><b>basement would be) We finally got the door opened  and they ran
crying</b>
</p><p><b>outside. We figured they thought they was stuck and became frighten
as a child</b>
</p><p><b>would in a situation like that. We assured them that they would be</b>
</p><p><b>alright..,now.</b>
</p><p><b>Then, like 5 years later my son seen this scary movie on tv of a
ghost</b>
</p><p><b>floating down the stairs that triggered his memory of that night.</b>
</p><p><b>What had happened that night was.., they went up to the attic to
play.,because</b>
</p><p><b>it was her toy room. (the 2 of them) My son noticed another little
girl up</b>
</p><p><b>there. And his friend said oh don't worry about her she's my friend.
This</b>
</p><p><b>little girls parents always said she had an imaginary friend. But.,she
was'nt</b>
</p><p><b>imaginary at all..,in our opinion. For.,my son and his friend started
to head</b>
</p><p><b>down the steps when the other girl stayed at the top of the
steps,sadly</b>
</p><p><b>watching them leave.As they aproached the door it wouldn't open. They
looked</b>
</p><p><b>back at the girl at the top of the steps and she looked</b>
</p><p><b>mad and started to come/float  toward them. That's when we heard them</b>
</p><p><b>screaming and pounding on the door. When my son told me of this.,my
husband</b>
</p><p><b>questioned his friend about the whole thing. He asked his daughter
about it</b>
</p><p><b>and her story was identical. And they now know , that  it wasn't  no
imaginary</b>
</p><p><b>person that  their daughter had been seeing all this time., while living
in</b>
</p><p><b>that house. And.,they no longer live there anymore. When my son told
me this I</b>
</p><p><b>was mad at that ghost/spirit..,if i'd of know this happened at the
time it did</b>
</p><p><b>take place..,this sort of thing would have  given me the will/strength
and</b>
</p><p><b>courage  to go in that attic with power inside of me(especially  once
you find</b>
</p><p><b>out they have messed with your children like that)and to tell them
to leave</b>
</p><p><b>and I would of said</b> <b>"I rebuke you in the name of our LORD JESUS
CHRIST get the </b>
</p><p><b>&nbsp;_ell out of</b> <b>here.,Go to JESUS for he is waiting for
you..,follow the light..,etc..,</b>
</p><p><b>Some peoples stories are frightening and some are loving...,but some

</p><h3><b><a name="phantom">The Phantom Up The Street</a></b>
</h3><p><b>By:	Owest87@aol.com</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>You can believe me or not but the stories I'm about to tell are true.
I never</b>
</p><p><b> really believed in ghosts when I was little. My mother told me they
were made</b>
</p><p><b> up by people a long time ago. And I believed it until I stayed a night
at my </b>
</p><p><b>neighbor's house up the street. The Smiths we'll call them, had a beautiful
colonial</b>
</p><p><b> style house which dated back to the late 1700s. I guess alot of
interesting events </b>
</p><p><b>occured there. The house was apparently owned by a wealthy family including
a house </b>
</p><p><b>across the street. The Smith's house had been used as a servant home
while the house</b>
</p><p><b> across the street was the main mansion. Anyway, one day in the late
1900s, a man </b>
</p><p><b>named Edward was working in the barn with a piece of machinery.  Suddenly
he lost </b>
</p><p><b>control of</b> <b>the machine. His arm got caught inside and it tore
it off. For hours, he laid in </b>
</p><p><b>the barn bleeding, and crying for help, but no one saved him until
it was too late. </b>
</p><p><b>Supposedly,</b> <b>his ghost haunts the Smith's house.</b>
</p><p><b>	So, now the story begins. It Rhode Island, 1987. I was about 6 years
old, but </b>
</p><p><b>I was well aware of my surroundings. My parents were going on vacation
and my sister</b>
</p><p><b> and I were to stay at the Smith's house. It was especially crowded
this particular </b>
</p><p><b>night because their relatives from West Virginia were spending the
night also. At about</b>
</p><p><b> 5 o'clock, we all had dinner, afterwards we all played like little
kids do, and finally </b>
</p><p><b>we all got together to settle down to go to sleep. Since there were
lack of rooms, one of</b>
</p><p><b> hte Smith's sons, John and I had to sleep in the attic. Their attic
wasn't the stereotypical</b>
</p><p><b> spooky attic. One half of it was made for occupation and the other
half was for storage.</b>
</p><p><b> John and I settled on the floor with our sleeping bags, and within
10 minutes, we were </b>
</p><p><b>fast</b> <b>asleep. Sometime in the middle of the night, I woke up.
Forgetting where I was, I </b>
</p><p><b>looked </b>&nbsp;<b>around the room until I realized where I was sleeping.
Slowly I looked to the </b>
</p><p><b>right to see </b>&nbsp;<b>if John was sleeping. He was. Then I looked
up at the doorway to the other </b>
</p><p><b>half of the attic,</b> <b>and what I saw, I'll never forget. In the
darkness was a dark figure with </b>
</p><p><b>an incredibly light</b> <b>face, crouching down in the doorway. The
face was so white, it looked </b>
</p><p><b>like a mask. It looked</b> <b>like his head was just floating there
without a body. I became so </b>
</p><p><b>frightened, I couldn't move. </b>&nbsp;<b>The only movements the figure
made was the blinking of </b>
</p><p><b>his eyes. Suddenly, I threw my blankets over my head, and screamed
for help while I </b>
</p><p><b>cried uncontrollably. It must've been 10 minutes before Mrs. Smith
ascended the attic </b>
</p><p><b>stairs in a rush to see what had startled me. I told her I needed to
go home, but I was </b>
</p><p><b>stuck at the Smith's. Mrs. Smith's only resolution was to put me</b>
<b>to sleep with my sister.</b>
</p><p><b> So, the rest of the night, I slept with my sister safely. Some
people</b> <b>I have told tell me</b>
</p><p><b> that I probably just saw things since I was young and still
questionning</b> <b>everything</b>
</p><p><b> around me. But, I wasn't the only one who saw things there. Mrs. Smith
had many</b>
</p><p><b> experiences with the entity. One night, while the rest of her family
was away in Cape </b>
</p><p><b>Cod, </b>&nbsp;<b>she got ready to go to sleep. Before she fell asleep,
she decided to read the rest of </b>
</p><p><b>one of her</b> <b>books. While she was reading, she looked up at her
bedroom door. She </b>
</p><p><b>became immediately</b> <b>startled at what she saw. There was a man
in clothing that looked </b>
</p><p><b>old-fashioned, standing </b>&nbsp;<b>in the doorway, just staring at
her. Slowly, she got herself </b>
</p><p><b>together and asked the man what</b> <b>he wanted. Without a word, he
turned around and </b>
</p><p><b>walked down the hallway and into the wall,</b> <b>disappearing. Mrs.
Smith, scared out of her</b>
</p><p><b> mind, ran down to our house for some comfort. </b>
</p><p><b>Another time, Mrs. Smith had an incredibly strange dream. In her dream,
she was </b>
</p><p><b>walking around her house aimlessly. She opened her front door, and
walked around the </b>
</p><p><b>perimeter. As she turned a corner to where there was a back stairwell
that lead to a </b>
</p><p><b>deck, she saw an old man standing on the steps, repeating the word
"Here" and pointing </b>
</p><p><b>to the stairs. Mrs. Smith then woke up and thought nothing of the dream.
But during the </b>
</p><p><b>day, she started to clean the house. She stood at the bottom of the
stairs and started to </b>
</p><p><b>walk  up. As she looked up, she saw a window in the room she was walking
up to. But as </b>
</p><p><b>she walked closer, she could see a face pressed against the window.
It was the old man </b>
</p><p><b>that she dreamt about. Mrs. Smith couldn't believe it. She just stood
on the stairs and </b>
</p><p><b>watched him. He was mouthing something through the glass but she couldn't
make it out. </b>
</p><p><b>It was like he was trying to talk to her. Naturally, she ran downstairs
and stayed there. </b>
</p><p><b>But even stranger about that was the window was on a second story window.
</b>
</p><p><b>	Another story about the Smith's house was told to me on accident by
a girl named Jen</b>
</p><p><b> who used to live up the street from me. She told me that one Halloween,
her, her sister, </b>
</p><p><b>and her mother went trick-or-treating up the street. They reached the
Smith's house. </b>
</p><p><b>You would</b> <b>always get excited when you reached the Smith's because
they put on the </b>
</p><p><b>most frightening haunted houses. So, Jen, her mother and sister all
went up to the </b>
</p><p><b>Smith's front door. All the lights in the house were out, but the front
door was wide open. </b>
</p><p><b>Thinking it was part of the haunted house,</b> <b>they went in. The
living room was completely </b>
</p><p><b>dark and the house was silent. But within a few seconds, commotion
began directly </b>
</p><p><b>upstairs. Jen and her family heard ghostly laughter,</b> <b>whispering,
and crying. They also </b>
</p><p><b>heard things rolling on the floor above and a ball bounce until it
bounced down the stairs, </b>
</p><p><b>straight ahead of them. They were scared the way you're scared on
Halloween. But all</b>
</p><p><b> of that changed. Soon after the ball, a figure in the darkness</b>
<b>fell down the stairway, </b>
</p><p><b>screaming. The figure wasn't just sliding down, it was flipping over</b>
<b>on it's head,</b>
</p><p><b> smashing itself into the banister and just damaging itself. After
it's fall,</b>
</p><p><b> the figure just laid at the foot of the stairs completely silent.
Jen, her mother, and sister, </b>
</p><p><b>all ran from the house screaming, not knowing if what they saw was
real or fake. But, </b>
</p><p><b>the next week, the Smiths announced that they were in New Jersey visiting
relatives. </b>
</p><p><b>The figure they</b> <b>saw was not one of the Smiths. </b>
</p><p><b>	Other things have happened here but they were all small. Everything
from nightly </b>
</p><p><b>whispering, to loud thumpings and crashes. There have been other witnesses
to the </b>
</p><p><b>events</b> <b>at the Smith's house but no one knows why the house is
haunted. People think</b>
</p><p><b> that Edward</b> <b>is the ghost that haunts, but the visions everyone
saw didn't fit his</b>
</p><p><b> description. The </b>&nbsp;<b>hauntings still continue today, but
they're not as extreme as they were </b>
</p><p><b>before. Hopefully,</b> <b>the ghost or ghosts will move on into the
afterlife.</b>

</p><p><b>At that time,Cherry Hill was a farm which took in migrant workers

</p><p><b> no one came in. I would know if someone did because the floor is wood

</p><p><b> So I heard this noise like a faucet was running..so I finished and

</p><p><b>The sink had been turned on. So I walk up to the sink..and it just

</b>

</h3><p><b>By:  JnFrancis@aol.com</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>This is the experience that made me a believer...</b>
</p><p><b>About 11 or 12 years ago I was working in a retail picture framing
shop.  It</b>
</p><p><b>was a Sunday afternoon and business was slow.  The store was set up
with a</b>
</p><p><b>retail showroom in the front of the store and the back half of the
store was</b>
</p><p><b>where we did the framing.  There was a bathroom and a manager's office.
 This</b>
</p><p><b>was a pretty laid back place to work.  On this particular Sunday I
was working</b>
</p><p><b>along with two other part timers.  The one part timer was allowed to
bring in</b>
</p><p><b>his portable t.v. to work so that he could watch football when he wasn't
at</b>
</p><p><b>the counter.  </b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>It was a beautiful fall day.  The back door to the shop was propped
open, the</b>
</p><p><b>game was on the t.v., and it was close to quitting time.  Some other
employees</b>
</p><p><b>had stopped in to "hang out."  The bathroom door was always wedged
open with a</b>
</p><p><b>piece of wood, unless it was being used.  There was a sink and two
stalls, but</b>
</p><p><b>we only used it one person at a time.  Anyway, I was standing outside
of the</b>
</p><p><b>wedged open bathroom door next to someone else and suddenly the door
shook,</b>
</p><p><b>violently.  It lasted about 5 seconds and stopped just as abruptly
as it had</b>
</p><p><b>began.  I froze and stared at the door and asked in astonishment, "did
you</b>
</p><p><b>just see that?"  The person next to me had not seen it.  No one did,
except</b>
</p><p><b>me.  It was noisy too.  I couldn't believe that no one else saw it.</b>
</p><p><b>Especially the person that was standing right next to me!</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>After asking around, I learned that the space where the store was located
had</b>
</p><p><b>formerly been a biker bar called the Bratwurst House.  I went to the
library</b>
</p><p><b>and learned that there had been a murder in the bathroom.  At this
point my</b>
</p><p><b>husband called me off the quest.  He was afraid that if there was a
unhappy</b>
</p><p><b>spirit, and someone expressed interest, that it might try to manifest
itself</b>
</p><p><b>through that person.  I felt I had learned enough, and nothing more
ever</b>
</p><p><b>happened.  It made me a believer though.  Someone/something was in
control of</b>
</p><p><b>that door.  It was a controlled shake and stop.  </b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Months later, a customer who claimed to have abilities,  came into
the store</b>
</p><p><b>and I asked if they would go into the bathroom and see if they felt
anything.</b>
</p><p><b>They agreed and said that there was a cold area around the bathroom
mirror.</b>
</p><p><b>Whether they were a reliable source, I'll never know, but since then
I have</b>

<h3><b><a name="an">An Apparition</a></b>
</h3><p><b>By:&nbsp; Anonymous</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>The following experience is recounted exactly how I remember it, and
I swear to its </b>
</p><p><b>authenticity.</b>
</p><p><b>When I was eight years old we moved from the westside of Cleveland
to a rural hamlet</b>
</p><p><b> in Mingo County, Ben Creek, West Virginia. My parents, being Appalachian
people, </b>
</p><p><b>wanted to move back to the area of their family and roots. The area
was mountainous</b>
</p><p><b> and rugged with vast foliage, and the house we moved into on Ben Creek
was in need </b>
</p><p><b>of serious repair.  Because it would only be a temporary housing situation
for us,</b>
</p><p><b> we would make it work.  Our closest neighbors lived about 3/4 mile
further down </b>
</p><p><b>the creek on the winding, narrow, and isolated road.  This area was
nothing like</b>
</p><p><b> my urban experience in Cleveland.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>My parents, along with my five other brothers and sisters (I am the
youngest</b>
</p><p><b> of six children),  made do in the cramped confines of the house. 
For the first</b>
</p><p><b> couple of weeks nothing unusual occured.  What was unusual, however,
were the constant</b>
</p><p><b> questions my brothers and sisters and I encountered almost daily from
the other school</b>
</p><p><b> children as to the "haunted house" we supposedly lived in.  We simply
did not pay much</b>
</p><p><b> attention to these remarks and questions because we had not seen or
heard anything to</b>
</p><p><b> give credence to their questions.  One spring evening, though, that
changed dramatically.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>My parents along with my one of my sisters had gone into town (Matewan)
for groceries</b>
</p><p><b> and to visit my dad's brother.  Matewan was about twenty miles away
and we expected </b>
</p><p><b>them back certainly before nightfall.  When we first witnessed the
apparition, I was home </b>
</p><p><b>along</b> <b>with my two sisters (15 and 13) and my brother who was
ten at the time (as I said I </b>
</p><p><b>was 8 </b>&nbsp;<b>years old).  That evening we four were watching
television in the living room when </b>
</p><p><b>our dog "Mitten" (who was tied up to the front porch) began to bark
hysterically and </b>
</p><p><b>incessently. Immediately, due to the urgency in his bark, my brother,
eldest sister, and I </b>
</p><p><b>quickly jumped</b> <b>up and ran to the opened front door (thinking
we were about to be visited </b>
</p><p><b>by a neighbor).  </b>&nbsp; <b>It was then as we peered toward where
Mitten was barking, and </b>
</p><p><b>standing straight as a soldier</b> <b>and on the edge of the house
was a figure of a man in </b>
</p><p><b>slicker-type apparel.  That is to say, he (it?) was wearing a
fisherman-type hat (the kind </b>
</p><p><b>that goes to the shoulders) with what appeared to be a raincoat reminescent
of the type </b>
</p><p><b>that goes fully past the calf.  It was a</b> <b>flat black human figure
with no light reflecting off </b>
</p><p><b>whatsoever. It almost appeared as a </b>&nbsp;<b>black hole of some
sort.  By the way he (it?) was </b>
</p><p><b>standing we could only make out the front</b> <b>half of this figure,
as the back half was hidden </b>
</p><p><b>behind the corner of the house.  We,</b> <b>initially, thought it was
a man who wanted to break </b>
</p><p><b>into our home--until it moved. </b>
</p><p><b>As I write these words I am again reliving the cold chills.  As it
moved, it moved </b>
</p><p><b>as one single unit with no body motion at all.  That is, it moved as
one would move a </b>
</p><p><b>solid object.  And, I swear before all that is Holy, this thing floated
above the</b>
</p><p><b> ground about one foot.  My sister who is now 42, and my 37 y.o. brother,
and I all know</b>
</p><p><b> this to be true.  This figure floated down our gravel driveway--making
no sound</b>
</p><p><b> whatsoever--and simply made a right turn at the road and was gone.
 </b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>My mother, on a later occassion, sitting in the doorway after a spring
rain, said she</b>
</p><p><b> witnessed the same figure come up out of the roadway and run up the
driveway before </b>
</p><p><b>disappearing behing the house.  The only dissimilarities in our experiences
is that </b>
</p><p><b>the figure came toward the house and she actually saw body motion.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Lastly, and on another evening a short while later, my entire family
and I heard</b>
</p><p><b> "all hell breaking loose" in an unoccupied attic.  Crashing sounds
as though somebody</b>
</p><p><b> was breaking glass and stomping through it, woke us all.  My father
and eldest brother </b>
</p><p><b>(18 at the time), armed with makeshift weapons climbed the attic stairs
thinking a </b>
</p><p><b>madman</b> <b>had broken in and was destroying our attic.  When they
opened the door to the </b>
</p><p><b>attic, </b>&nbsp;<b>nothing had been displaced.  Not a thing.  Even
the cobwebs were undisturbed in </b>
</p><p><b>the window</b> <b>sills.  My dad was finally convinced--this house
was insane, or "haunted."  </b>
</p><p><b>We moved shortly thereafter.</b>
</p><p><b>I still emotionally deal with the other-worldly trauma to this very
day.  Though I have </b>
</p><p><b>learned to live quite well with the experience, I admit it occassionally
still occupies</b>
</p><p><b> my dreams.  When I hear people--who have never experienced something
of this </b>
</p><p><b>paranormal</b> <b>nature--scoff and dismiss, I smile.  I used to get
upset at their narrow </b>
</p><p><b>perspective. </b>&nbsp;<b> But not anymore.  I am a thrity-four year
old man who was severly </b>
</p><p><b>traumatized as a child </b>&nbsp;<b>by an apparition.  And that is
the truth.    </b>

</p><p><b>Hi There</b>
</p><p><b>   This is a true story about a house me and my 2 yr old daughter and
my</b>
</p><p><b>boyfriend used to live in but had to move out of because of all the
crazy</b>
</p><p><b> stuff that went on there. This happened in 1978. 20 yrs ago, and it
is </b>
</p><p><b>still freshon my memory.   This house was </b>
</p><p><b>at least 110yrs old and in the old downtown district of houston.
Montrose</b>
</p><p><b> area is what it is called. My landlady told me she bought this house
in </b>
</p><p><b>1948. Before then it was a insane asslym or what they now call a
Mental</b>
</p><p><b>Hospital. Well, this house was divided into six different apts. I</b>
</p><p><b>believe we had the better part of the house. We had the front porch
</b>
</p><p><b>and front door entrance. The living room had a large piano in it and</b>
</p><p><b> a winding staircase. I have caught my little girl 2 yrs</b>
</p><p><b>old stareing up at the balcony as if there were someone there .</b>
</p><p><b> I ampretty sinsitive to stuff like this and I did feel there was</b>
</p><p><b> something watching us all the time. One night late, about 3am my
boyfriend</b>
</p><p><b> Tommy jumped out of bed so fast it woke me up. I said </b>
</p><p><b>honey, where are you going?  He said Im getting the hell out of here.
</b>
</p><p><b>Theres a ghost of a man standing over on your side of the bed. Dont
you</b>
</p><p><b>dare leave me alone here. I NEVER got dressed so fast in all my life.</b>
</p><p><b> We both ran out to the car, left the front door open. We sat at the</b>
</p><p><b> Dunkin Doughnuts until dawn. Then went back to the house. We</b>
</p><p><b>knew for sure we had a problem then. Well Tommy couldnt take it so
he</b>
</p><p><b>left me there. I stayed a few more months until I had saved enough</b>
</p><p><b> to move out. One winter evening around 9pm I WAS HOME ALONE, reading
</b>
</p><p><b>the newspaper when a males voice breathed in my</b>
</p><p><b>left ear. It was loud and warm and terrifying. I hit the front door</b>
</p><p><b>running. Forgot to put on my shoes and coat. And I forgot my purse
and</b>
</p><p><b>my car keys. I ran 3 blks to a girlfriends house. Screaming and
crying.</b>
</p><p><b>Tottally terrified. Shaking like a leaf.</b>
</p><p><b>  Well youd think I Should have moved by this time, but money was
hard</b>
</p><p><b>to come by for a one parent household. I found out soon after this
my</b>
</p><p><b>land lady was calling in vagabond spirits into her side of the house,</b>
</p><p><b>she said she wanted to direct them to the other side. Well, that was
it.</b>
</p><p><b>I borrowed some cash from a friend who knew about our problem. I
moved</b>
</p><p><b>so fast I left some really nice furniture there. I Had no way to

</p><p>
</p><p><b>I was delighted to find your website because I realized once again
that</b>
</p><p><b>paranormal happenings are not so unusual!</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>About 1972, my husband and I bought a house that was only two years
old and</b>
</p><p><b>which had been rented for that short time by a large, happy family
whose</b>
</p><p><b>father was our real estate agent.  After we moved in, strange but
rather</b>
</p><p><b>comforting things began to happen on relatively regular basis which</b>
</p><p><b>continued for the eight years we lived there.  As an example, one
afternoon</b>
</p><p><b>I arrived home, tired after a day of teaching at a public high school
in</b>
</p><p><b>Louisville, Kentucky.  (By the way, this beautiful old school has its
own</b>
</p><p><b>ghostly lore!)  I went upstairs to change my clothes, take a quick
nap and</b>
</p><p><b>attack the huge stack of English composition papers I had brought home
with</b>
</p><p><b>me.  When I opened our closet, I discovered to my delight that all
the</b>
</p><p><b>clothes had been arranged by type and color, the shoes were neatly
placed</b>
</p><p><b>side-by-side, the shelves were tidy--in sum, everything was as shipshape
as</b>
</p><p><b>a sea captain's quarters.  I've long been of the random type, so this</b>
</p><p><b>pleased me enormously.  When my husband called from work for our
nightly</b>
</p><p><b>conversation (he was on night shift in those days), I thanked him
profusely</b>
</p><p><b>for his hard work on the closet that day.  He replied in his usual
serious,</b>
</p><p><b>no-nonsense way that he hadn't even opened the closet door, having
put out</b>
</p><p><b>his outer clothes to wear one more day and changing only his underwear
and</b>
</p><p><b>socks!  Because we were often alone in the house at different times
of the</b>
</p><p><b>day and night. we independently heard similar phenomena:  heavy steps
both</b>
</p><p><b>upstairs and downstairs, the mouthwatering aroma of baking bread
wafting</b>
</p><p><b>from the kitchen (but, sadly, no bread to be found!), lost items showing
up</b>
</p><p><b>in bizarre places, and a pervasive feeling of being watched over by
a benign</b>
</p><p><b>presence.  Because we often unearthed hand-forged nails and hinges
when we</b>
</p><p><b>dug holes to plant trees and shrubbery, we asked a local historian
about the</b>
</p><p><b>background of the area.  He informed us that we lived on a former
plantation</b>
</p><p><b>of vast proportions and our house stood on the site of the slave
quarters.</b>
</p><p><b>Could it be that a dear lady from the last century was trying to take
care</b>
</p><p><b>of two young, disorganized newly-weds--who had also lost their
mothers?</b>
</p><p><b>More things occurred, but I think you get the drift.  We have lived
in</b>
</p><p><b>another house for many years, but it's essentially "empty" of extra</b>
</p><p><b>inhabitants.  I must confess that I miss our friend!</b>

</p><p><b>   I could remember when I was younger, oh about 10 or so, I had just
moved</b>
</p><p><b>to a new state. We had been living at my new (rented) house for a few</b>
</p><p><b>months then, and we were getting new neighbors across the street.
Being</b>
</p><p><b>friendly, I went over and greeted them. I met the family; A couple
with a</b>
</p><p><b>7-year-old girl and 9-year-old boy. We became friends pretty quickly;
my</b>
</p><p><b>sister, myself, and the two. That's when things started to happen.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>   I had started to think a lot about pets and family that had died
before</b>
</p><p><b>I had moved there. There was my grandfather Jerry [who lived in MI
and died</b>
</p><p><b>the Xmas prior], my dog Denny, and a few countless others, but those
two</b>
</p><p><b>were more distinct then the others.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>  I had a dream one night, involving my grandfather. I had seen
myself,</b>
</p><p><b>sleeping in my bed, and him coming to sit down next to me, stroking
my hair</b>
</p><p><b>and humming his favorite tune. I woke up crying, looking out my window.
The</b>
</p><p><b>outside was a dim colored grey-blue.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>  A few months later I was reading a book, A Time for Dancing by
Davida</b>
</p><p><b>Wills Hurwin, and at the end I started sobbing. I mean really sobbing,
I</b>
</p><p><b>had never cried before to anything; not a book, not a movie, not
anything.</b>
</p><p><b>I had a sudden sweep of sadness I hadn't felt since the night I had
gotten</b>
</p><p><b>the phone call from my grandmother speaking of my grandfather's
death.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>  I told the boy, who I had become almost best friends with. He told
me all</b>
</p><p><b>of his stories, but told me one that sounded a lot like my dream. It</b>
</p><p><b>involved his grandmother. I didn't tell him about it and went home</b>
</p><p><b>afterward, not thinking much of it.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>  That night I was thinking about Denny. I had cried for a while,
missing</b>
</p><p><b>him, even though it had been over 7 years since his untimely death.
I went</b>
</p><p><b>to bed, and lied back, but couldn't sleep. I was looking out my
window</b>
</p><p><b>again. The color shifted, turning to a pale grey-blue/green. Then I
saw a</b>
</p><p><b>small orb, floating outside my window, followed by a light whine and
a</b>
</p><p><b>single bark. I knew it was Denny. I suddenly had the feeling he was
laying</b>
</p><p><b>at my side, nuzzling me, licking my hand. I could feel my smile, and
sleep</b>
</p><p><b>overwelmed me.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>  Two months later, the boy told me about his dad's Objiua board story.
His</b>
</p><p><b>grandmother had owned it, and one day his mom and dad (being
teenagers)</b>
</p><p><b>started to play. They got a haunting message (which I didn't remember)
that</b>
</p><p><b>spooked the living crap out of them. They told their grandmother, and</b>
</p><p><b>instantly she said they should get rid of it. They threw it out. But
it</b>
</p><p><b>appeared in the room again. They broke it and threw it out. But it
appeared</b>
</p><p><b>once more in the room. They took it out and burnt it, then did a prayer.
It</b>
</p><p><b>didn't return.</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>  I always wondered what these moments ment. I never really thought
about</b>
</p><p><b>them, and usually kept quiet about them, until now. I wondered, was
it</b>
</p><p><b>those two children, who are still my friends today, that brought out
these</b>
</p><p><b>thoughts to my attention? Probably to rid me of my grief?</b>

</p><p><b>growing up.  My uncle started to talk about the ghost are still

</p><p><b>with them. I was suprised , since i just thought was just lies. But
he</b>
</p><p><b>assured me they were real. My uncle said they were not just one but

</p><p><b>ghost that lived in the house.  There was a Old Lady that will only</b>
</p><p><b>appear in the attic and a old man that would appear in the attic and</b>
</p><p><b>basement , a small boy about 5 years old that will apear all over the</b>
</p><p><b>house and the backyard , a Young man that appeared recently in the</b>
