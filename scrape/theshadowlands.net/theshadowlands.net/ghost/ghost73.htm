<P>
<P><B>I have never seen a ghost that I can think of. (I have family members

though that have seen </B>
<P><B>tons because of my grandparents haunted house) But I have had at least
two experiences in my </B>
<P><B>life that I will never forget.  The first one was when I lived in

Heidelberg Germany.  My sister</B>
<P><B> was back in the states and she was constantly fighting with my father

about her wedding.  One</B>
<P><B> day she got so frustrated she called me in Germany and asked if I
would call my grandfather </B>
<P><B>(who lived 2 minutes from my sisters home) to see if he could do something

about my father's</B>
<P><B> orneryness.  I said yes sure, and called my grandfather. I spoke for
about 5 minutes and in</B>
<P><B> that time I asked about my grandmother, to see how she was and if
I could talk to her.  He </B>
<P><B>said she was sleeping and would give her a message I had called.  I
went to sleep shortly </B>
<P><B>thereafter and had a dream.  In this dream I was my grandmother and
I had a heart-attack.</B>
<P><B>  I woke up feeling disconnected somehow and strange.  The strange
feeling whatever it was </B>
<P><B>never left me.  When I went to bed that night I had another dream,
again I was my grandmother </B>
<P><B>and I had a second heart-attack, but this time I actually died in this

dream.  I woke up at </B>
<P><B>6:30am with the phone ringing.  It was my sister calling to say that
our grandmother had a </B>
<P><B>stroke and was in the hospital.  I couldn't believe this!  I knew what
was going to happen </B>
<P><B>though, and I told my sister that my grandmother would have another
stroke and die.  5 days</B>
<P><B> later or so that is exactly what happened.  I came home for the funeral,

but was quiet and</B>
<P><B> withdrawn.  I could not cry.  I felt that my grandmother had connected

with me because I was</B>
<P><B> so far away.  I felt prepared for her death. I talk to my grandmother

every now and again. </B>
<P><B> I think somehow she is still around and I really like that because
I really loved her.</B>
<P><B>The second story I will be quick about.  Presently I live in Arizona
and my parents in NY. </B>
<P><B> My friends and I get together every thursday at a coffee house to
play UNO and just relax </B>
<P><B>from the stress of the week.  I had a dream one night that my sister
called me at this coffee</B>
<P><B> house one Thursday to tell me that my father was in the hospital and
in serious condition(later</B>
<P><B> on in the dream he died.)  About one month ago I was at our coffee
house as usual and I was </B>
<P><B>told I had a phone call!  It was my sister calling to say that our
father was in the hospital</B>
<P><B> and he was in serious condition!!!!  I think I really stopped breathing

because the dream came </B>
<P><B>right to my mind.  The only good thing about this dream is that my
father survived the hospital</B>
<P><B> and is safe at home....thank you for listening!</B>

<H3><A NAME=opening><B>Opening Pandora's Box</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: FesterStew@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>My first Husband and I bought our semi-detached, 2 1/2 story home 11
years </B>
<P><B>ago. We were the third owners. It was built in the 1940s. On the third
year </B>
<P><B>of ownership, my husband &amp; I divorced. Our 4 young children and
I remained </B>
<P><B>living in our home. As they grew we began to use the eaves attic storage

</B>
<P><B>space more often. Upon one of our storage adventures, my son William
was </B>
<P><B>exploring the eaves crawl space. He looked between some boards that
were </B>
<P><B>place over the second floors ceiling (the crawl spaces flooring). He
called </B>
<P><B>to me stating that he saw something positioned along side of the chimney,

and </B>
<P><B>that it resembled a metal box.</B>
<P><B>The ironicalness of finding this box excited me tremendously because

several </B>
<P><B>of my older neighbors had told me countless stories about the homes
first </B>
<P><B>owner, Theodore Miller, who was believed to have stashed several large
sums </B>
<P><B>of money through out the house. We casually looked for "his"stash several

</B>
<P><B>times, as if we were playing a scavengers hunt game on snow stormy
winter </B>
<P><B>days. However, we discounted the legends as myth and didn't pay much
</B>
<P><B>attention to the rumors until we found this metal box resting alongside
the </B>
<P><B>chimney. </B>
<P><B>The hidden area was created for the hiding place of this metal box
only and </B>
<P><B>only a very trained eye could actually see it from it's hiding place.
I </B>
<P><B>personally had stored things in the eaves from the time I had moved
into the </B>
<P><B>home. My ex-husband had been in the eaves many times to repair things
and </B>
<P><B>store things and neither of us had ever found the hidden box before.</B>
<P><B>Carrying the metal box down to the first floor dining room, I opened
the box </B>
<P><B>with much apprehension, fearing the Pandora's box story of childhood.
I was </B>
<P><B>profoundly amazed by what I found inside. The box to my amusement did
not </B>
<P><B>contain the first owners hidden cash stash but it did however, contain

nearly </B>
<P><B>a hundred photo's. The photo's were that of the owners family and friends.

</B>
<P><B>Several of the photo's were of the neighbor hood, various homes,

businesses, </B>
<P><B>and residents of bygone years. One of the photo's actually showed the

nearly </B>
<P><B>finished construction of the Junior High School in 1940.</B>
<P><B>The box also contained the original land property purchase receipts,
and Mr. </B>
<P><B>Miller's baptism records from the early 1900s.</B>
<P><B>This information must seem totally irrelevant to the story of ghosts
until </B>
<P><B>you read what happened next. My children who never suffered from nightmares

</B>
<P><B>began to awaken in the middle of the night to fits of screaming and
</B>
<P><B>horrifying dreams. They continually began to complain of seeing things,

</B>
<P><B>especially and man ghost like figure.</B>
<P><B>What I haven't shared with you yet is my own personal experience with
"our </B>
<P><B>haunting." From the time that I moved into this home I never felt

comfortable </B>
<P><B>in the home when I was alone. I preferred to remain on the first floor

during </B>
<P><B>the day time hours and I never went to the third floor alone. I always
had an </B>
<P><B>uncomfortable feeling about that room. I always had a feeling of being

</B>
<P><B>watched while on the second floor, and I sometimes felt I saw something
but </B>
<P><B>chalked it up to my fear and imagination. I never gave it much thought,

never </B>
<P><B>made a connection that I was living among a spirit.</B>
<P><B>Until the box was open and the children complained and began telling
me of </B>
<P><B>experiences they were having. </B>
<P><B>It was not until my boyfriend, now second husband Jon, moved in to
our home </B>
<P><B>that the pieces to our experiences began to make sense. After spending
his </B>
<P><B>first day alone in our home Jon (he worked nights and I work days)
spoke to </B>
<P><B>me that evening about the strange feelings he felt alone during the
daytime </B>
<P><B>hours. He described in detail the same presence I had always felt in
our </B>
<P><B>home. I had not shared my discomfort with anyone before. He knew of
the "box" </B>
<P><B>we had found because He and I were dating at the time of finding it.

Neither </B>
<P><B>he nor I made a connection until that first night. Our thought was
to put the </B>
<P><B>pictures back and close our "Pandora's box." The one glitch was that
I had </B>
<P><B>already donated some of the pictures to the School District. I felt
it would </B>
<P><B>not help us if we did not put things back completely the way we found

them.</B>
<P><B>Our decision was then to accept that our home was being shared by another

and </B>
<P><B>we came to terms with that fact. Both Jon and I still felt the presence
and </B>
<P><B>didn't fear it or get anode with it. At this time, I began to visually
see </B>
<P><B>the ghostly figure of this man throughout the house. I became so secure

with </B>
<P><B>this situation that I even moved our bedroom to the third floor due
to </B>
<P><B>needing more room during a reconstruction. We spent many blissful years

</B>
<P><B>sleeping in this room. It became a haven filled with peace and love.
Two of </B>
<P><B>my sons now share that room and they embrace it with as much joy as
we did.</B>
<P><B>I want to express to everyone that we were at first very afraid and
fearful </B>
<P><B>of what we were experiencing. It appears that once Jon and made peace
with </B>
<P><B>our home sharing we only felt security and pleasure being in our home
at all </B>
<P><B>times alone or not.</B>
<P><B>However, the children continued to have nightmares and daytime sightings.

We </B>
<P><B>were unable to offer them reassurance and understanding to accept this

</B>
<P><B>presence as okay and non threatening.</B>
<P><B>Jon and I decided to send our friendly spirit away from our home because
of </B>
<P><B>the fear the children were experiencing. Together we held hands and
</B>
<P><B>proclaimed our belief in God, and told Mr. Miller clearly that he was
to move </B>
<P><B>on and make no further contact with us or our children. We expressed
our </B>
<P><B>selves through words of love and patience and understanding but making
it </B>
<P><B>know to him that he was scaring the children and that it had to stop
at this </B>
<P><B>instance.</B>
<P><B>We have since learned that Theodore and his wife, Violet Miller, never
had </B>
<P><B>children. They were unable to conceive. Jon and I figure that the reason

"he" </B>
<P><B>was contacting the children was that he longed to play with them and
enjoy </B>
<P><B>having the relationship with them that he didn't have with his own
during his </B>
<P><B>time on this plane. Neither of us feel he was trying to hurt or scare
them. </B>
<P><B>It was their misunderstanding that created their fear of him.</B>
<P><B>We have had many experiences that have happened in our home that leaves
us to </B>
<P><B>believe "he" is with us still all these years later. The exception
is that he </B>
<P><B>no longer contacts us. One memorable time is this past Christmas season.
We </B>
<P><B>had an old but beautiful strand of Christmas lights strung from our
piano. I </B>
<P><B>forgot to unplug them and went to bed. I awoke to find the strand still

</B>
<P><B>plugged in but the cord to the lights were completely burned, melted

blacken </B>
<P><B>plastic. Jon and I both claim the reason our house didn't burn to the

ground </B>
<P><B>is to the loving "ghost of protection" that dwells within our home
with us.</B>

</H3><P><B>By: bawooten@mindspring.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Some years ago I was dating a girl in Tucker, Georgia. We </B>
<P><B>had gone back to her parents house and were downstares (there was an

upstars, </B>
<P><B>main floor and a sunken living room that lead to the garage). While
sitting on </B>
<P><B>the couch and talking I heard some one come downstairs, around into
the dining </B>
<P><B>room and into the kitchen. I turned to see who it was when the steps

continued </B>
<P><B>down to our level (beside me). The weight of the 'person' could be
seen on the </B>
<P><B>steps and the steps (sans body) continued out into the garage. I looked
at her </B>
<P><B>(she was grinning) and followed the steps into the garage. I felt a

presence and </B>
<P><B>saw something to my right. I turned but saw nothing - just felt the

impression </B>
<P><B>that it had passed into the wall&amp;nbsp;at that point. In the

tucker/stone </B>
<P><B>mountain/ decatur area there were many small battles fought during
the civil </B>
<P><B>war. The girl related to me that other houses in the block had experiences

too - </B>
<P><B>all seemed to be in a line. A little research by one of her friends
seemed to </B>
<P><B>intecate that a trench line existed here. She related that the ghost
would go up </B>
<P><B>and down the hall and would also open and shut doors.</B>

<H3><A NAME=dress><B>Wedding Dress Shop</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By:harley474@aol.com </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Hey, I just wanted to post a quick weird thing that happened to me.</B>
<P><B>I went to Salem, MASS to get my wedding dress two weeks ago (married

last</B>
<P><B>weekend) and something weird happened.  I was in Fool's Mansion on
a Sunday,</B>
<P><B>putting my dress on layaway for a week.  And they wouldn't let me get

part</B>
<P><B>of the dress, I wanted.  Hard to describe, but an Over piece that looks

like</B>
<P><B>a tank top on top and a skirt attached that's wicked long and

silky/satiny.</B>
<P><B>It would go over the dress that I did buy.  It's supposed to be

custom-made</B>
<P><B>and</B><B>would have taken 3-4 weeks to make and I only had two weeks (I know,
I</B>
<P><B>know!)  So I asked if I could have the one off the mannequin and she

said</B>
<P><B>no.</B>
<P><B>I was very disappointed.  Oh well.  So I went up front to leave her

some</B>
<P><B>money for the part of the dress I did get.  There are two separate

rooms.</B>
<P><B>The front where the cashiers are and the back, that they call the</B>
<P><B>Renaissance Room.  After I paid I was waiting for my friend to stop</B>
<P><B>chattering away with the woman who sells the alcohol free perfume there.

 So</B>
<P><B>I decided to go in the back room one more time to look at the part
of the</B>
<P><B>dress I couldn't get.  I went back there and the back room also has
a small</B>
<P><B>room attached where they do adjustments and hems and stuff (an open

sewing</B>
<P><B>room.)  The light was on when I was back there before.  But when I
went back</B>
<P><B>this time the sewing room lights were off and I was walking towards

the</B>
<P><B>dress and looking at it and noticed the lights were off and as I was

turning</B>
<P><B>my head to the right, towards the sewing room I heard far away screams

of</B>
<P><B>many many people and once my head was fully turned to the sewing room,

the</B>
<P><B>screams stopped in an instant!  Weird!  I did a double take to make
sure my</B>
<P><B>hearing was correct.  They also have a cellar where the woman who makes

the</B>
<P><B>dresses was at the time, and that's where she makes them.  You have
to walk</B>
<P><B>past the cellar door to get the back room.  It was just really weird

and</B>
<P><B>thought it could have been my imagination, but I don't think so.  Who

knows!</B>

<H3><A NAME=two><B>Two Houses</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: rhiannoned@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi!  I love your website, and I thought I'd share some things that
</B>
<P><B>happened to me, though they're not nearly as dramatic as what other
</B>
<P><B>people have written about....</B>
<P>
<P><B>I grew up in a small split-level house that was situated in a </B>
<P><B>very "normal" neighborhood in south-eastern PA, but I always thought
</B>
<P><B>the house was haunted, and here's why.  First of all, no one could
</B>
<P><B>stand to be in the house alone, even my parents, though we could </B>
<P><B>never say why.  Nothing usually happened, it was just a bad feeling
</B>
<P><B>we would get.  When there was more than one person in the house, it
</B>
<P><B>was fine.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>The first unusual event that I can remember happened when I was about

</B>
<P><B>5.  I remember waking up in the middle of the night and finding what
</B>
<P><B>looked like a black triangle sitting on my bed.  I remember touching
</B>
<P><B>it and it bit or shocked me on the finger.  I don't remember being
</B>
<P><B>afraid at all, only curious.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>The second event did make me afraid.  I had to be about 5-6, because
</B>
<P><B>I was sharing my room with my brother (who's 2 years younger) at the
</B>
<P><B>time.  The way my room was arranged was like this:  the room was </B>
<P><B>square, and the door was near the bottom left corner.  As soon as you

</B>
<P><B>came into the room, my closet was to your left and the foot of my bed

</B>
<P><B>was directly in front of you.  My brother's bed was next to mine, to
</B>
<P><B>the right.  Well, one night, I woke up and there was a lady standing
</B>
<P><B>next to my closet, by my bed.  I know it was not my mother, because
</B>
<P><B>she is very small and has straight dark brown hair, and this woman
</B>
<P><B>was tall with sort of scraggly light brown hair.  I remember her face

</B>
<P><B>was very frightening, like she was grimacing.  I was so afraid I </B>
<P><B>jumped into bed with my brother and slept with him for the rest of
</B>
<P><B>the night.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Then, throughout my childhood, I would frequently wake up in the </B>
<P><B>middle of the night, almost overcome with fear.  I would never open
</B>
<P><B>my eyes, but instead would bury my face under my stuffed bear and my
</B>
<P><B>covers, almost suffocating myself rather than expose any part of my
</B>
<P><B>body to the air.  (Maybe the lady kept coming back!) I was terrified
</B>
<P><B>of the dark and would scream if anyone closed the door to my </B>
<P><B>bedroom.  I always insisted that the hall light be left on when I had

</B>
<P><B>to go to bed.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>The downstairs part of my house was not quite a basement and was only

</B>
<P><B>partially underground (we lived "in" a hill, so the front part of the

</B>
<P><B>downstairs was about 5 feet underground, while the back part had a
</B>
<P><B>door that opened into the backyard).  I was always afraid of the </B>
<P><B>downstairs, and even my very logical and clear-headed aunt says she
</B>
<P><B>too hated to be down there.  It just gave you the creeps.  Whenever
</B>
<P><B>she stayed overnight (the pull-out sofa was down there), she would
</B>
<P><B>ask me and my brother to stay with her.  The only light was all the
</B>
<P><B>way across the room from the stairs, so if you were there at night
</B>
<P><B>and wanted to leave, you had to turn off the light and run as fast
as </B>
<P><B>you could across the dark room to get to safety.  This was always a
</B>
<P><B>problem for me, because the piano was down there, and I often played
</B>
<P><B>at night.  The third scary event is related to the piano.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I was about 12 at the time, and had a habit of rocking up on the </B>
<P><B>front 2 legs of the piano bench when I played.  My mother would </B>
<P><B>always scold me for that, saying I would break the bench if I kept
it </B>
<P><B>up.  One day, during the late afternoon, I was playing the piano and
</B>
<P><B>my entire family was upstairs getting ready for dinner.  Well, I </B>
<P><B>started rocking up on the bench, as usual, when I literally felt a
</B>
<P><B>hand push the back of the bench down so that all legs touched the </B>
<P><B>floor.  I got so scared I ran upstairs and told everyone what </B>
<P><B>happened, but of course, no one believed me.  I got into my head the
</B>
<P><B>thought that maybe the hand had belonged to my guardian angel, so I
</B>
<P><B>started drawing pictures of her (I called her Emily) and talking to
</B>
<P><B>her in my mind.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The last event I can remember happened one night at 12:30 am (I </B>
<P><B>remember looking at the glowing face of my clock and thinking it </B>
<P><B>looked like a giant cat's eye).  There was a mirror on my wall, </B>
<P><B>situated so that if you were lying in bed, you could look into the
</B>
<P><B>mirror and see down the hall and into the kitchen.  Well, that night,

</B>
<P><B>I woke up and just laid there for a while.  I started hearing sounds
</B>
<P><B>in the kitchen:  the floor creaking, liquid being poured, a glass </B>
<P><B>being set on the counter.  I thought it was my father getting a </B>
<P><B>drink, so I laid there and watched in my mirror for him to come out
</B>
<P><B>of the kitchen.  Only he never came!  I waited until about 1, then
I </B>
<P><B>fell asleep.  The next morning, I asked my father if he had been in
</B>
<P><B>the kitchen, and he said no.  So I figure it was a.....</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was thirteen, we moved out of that house into the one we live
</B>
<P><B>in now (I'm now 21).  I still don't like being there alone (I guess
</B>
<P><B>I'm a natural scaredy-cat), though only one documentably strange </B>
<P><B>thing has ever occurred.  When we had first moved in, my cousins came

</B>
<P><B>to visit us.  I was down in the basement (a real basement this time)
</B>
<P><B>playing with my cousin Bettina.  Now, not to be rude, but my cousin
</B>
<P><B>is very very slow, mentally.  I say this because, knowing her, there
</B>
<P><B>is no way that she could make this up, because she has virtually no
</B>
<P><B>imagination.  So we were playing down there, when all of a sudden she

</B>
<P><B>looked up and into the far corner, where in the wall is a sort of </B>
<P><B>cubby hole.  She stared there for a few seconds, and I asked her what

</B>
<P><B>she was looking at.  She said, "did you see that?"  "What?" I asked.
 </B>
<P><B>She said she saw a large figure "covered with eyes" standing in the
</B>
<P><B>corner, and she heard it say "This is the wrong house," and then it
</B>
<P><B>went away.  After that, whenever I have to go down there alone, I </B>
<P><B>sing church hymns (hey, it can't hurt!).  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Finally (I know, I'm sorry this is so long!), two semi-strange things

</B>
<P><B>have happened in our house:  first, in my room, only on some nights,
</B>
<P><B>strange light reflections will appear on my ceiling and I've never
</B>
<P><B>been able to figure out what causes them or where they come from. 
</B>
<P><B>Secondly, since my brother and I have gone to college and my parents
</B>
<P><B>are alone, they have told us that they hear banging noises in their
</B>
<P><B>wall by the bed and in the same wall but downstairs.  Gosh, I HOPE
</B>
<P><B>it's just the plumbing!  </B>

<P><B>One night while my mom was sleeping in our room, she said she</B>
<P><B>woke up because someone was pulling the covers. She looked</B>

<P><B>She's not sure if she was dreaming or not. It felt real.</B>

<P><B>     One day when Mary was about 12 her aunt was planting in the garden.
As </B>
<P><B>she was digging she came across a small doll with a porcline face.
It was in </B>
<P><B>good condition, even thought you could tell that it had been in the
ground </B>
<P><B>for quite a few decades, so she brought it into the house, washed it
off and </B>
<P><B>gave it to Mary. That night Mary put it on her burrow and went to sleep.

The </B>
<P><B>next morning it was gone. She was very upset and asked everyone who
lived in </B>
<P><B>the house if they had taken it but no one had even seen the doll. After
a few </B>
<P><B>weeks she gave up on looking for the doll.</B>
<P><B>A year later her aunt was again working in the garden and in the same
spot </B>
<P><B>found the same doll laying in the same position. So again she took
it into </B>
<P><B>the house and washed it off (at that time she thought that one of Marys

</B>
<P><B>siblings had played a trick on Mary by hiding the doll in the garden,
she </B>
<P><B>didn't think twice about it being in the same local) she than gave
it back to </B>
<P><B>Mary saying that someone must of hidden it on her. So this time Mary
didn't  </B>
<P><B>tell her siblings about her finding the doll and hid it in her underware

</B>
<P><B>drawer where she was sure no one would go. The next day when she went
to get </B>
<P><B>her clothes just before she took her shower, she checked to see if
the doll </B>
<P><B>was still there, SURPRISE!, it wasn't. when she was about thirty and
had a </B>
<P><B>husband and son of her own and she was living in that house with her

mother, </B>
<P><B>husband, and son.  That spring she decided to start a garden and lo
and </B>
<P><B>behold there was the doll in the exact same location she brought it
into the </B>
<P><B>house, washed it off, and put it on her burrow. Next day it was gone.
Mary </B>
<P><B>than decided to never dig in that spot again. I just dread the day
one of </B>
<P><B>there dogs digs it up.</B>
<P><B>               The other is a short story of a singing lady. There
was once a </B>
<P><B>kind elderly old lady who haunted Mary's house. She was not like other

</B>
<P><B>ghosts. She was only seen by Mary twice, Mary describes her as a frail

</B>
<P><B>elderly and short wearing a floral dress. Her voice was the most beautiful

</B>
<P><B>that Mary had ever heard and she sang for a few years to anyone, she
never </B>
<P><B>hid her presence because she never felt threatened she sang fo anyone

family </B>
<P><B>friends and strangers. Plus she often helped them out. After about
three </B>
<P><B>years she left just as suddenly as she came, to much the dismay of
the family </B>
<P><B>(they loved her).</B>

<P><B>    Alright.There I was, a four year old girl sleeping </B>
<P><B>on the floor of my living room. My head was facing the doorway that

attatched </B>
<P><B>the living room with the dining room. That night, around 12:25,</B>
<P><B>I woke up because I was cold. But I was all snug </B>
<P><B>between 2 thick quilts. Then I looked up into the</B>
<P><B>dining room and saw my aunt Pam, who passed away before I was born.
She was a </B>
<P><B>twin to my mom. She was all pale with a long white nightgown on.( did
I </B>
<P><B>meantion she died in her sleep?) So I said, " Mom? Is that you?" She
nodded </B>
<P><B>her head no.than I looked down and saw she had no feet!</B>
<P><B>Then I said, "Go away, I'm trying to sleep!!!"</B>
<P><B> So then she nodded her head yes, turned around,</B>
<P><B>and walked up to a bedroom door, put her hand on</B>
<P><B>the wood, and them vanished! That's not the only </B>
<P><B>meeting with a ghost though.So I'll tell you more some other time!</B>

<H3><A NAME=other><B>Ghosts, Apparitions and Other States of Being</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By:kpyatt@net-link.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello. My name is Barry and I have always been very much into the</B>
<P><B>subject of ghosts and apparitions. I have many books on ghosts and
am</B>
<P><B>fascinated with them, spending countless hours reading real peoples'</B>
<P><B>true stories. I do not call them 'the supernatural' because there is</B>
<P><B>nothing supernatural about ghosts. They are a part of our every day

life</B>
<P><B>and existence, although most people don't think so and so call them</B>
<P><B>weird or 'supernatural'. Anyway, just wanted to clear that up. Now,

on</B>
<P><B>with my stories....</B>
<P>
<P><B>1). I haven't ever actually SEEN a ghost or apparition. Although I

have</B>
<P><B>had many small experiences and have heard family members and friends</B>
<P><B>tell theirs, as most of us at some point in our lives have some sort

of</B>
<P><B>brush with the other side. It's bound to happen. So, here is one of

my</B>
<P><B>experiences: It was quite a few years ago and I was getting ready for</B>
<P><B>school. My dad, step-mom, brother and twin sister were all in the</B>
<P><B>upstairs bathroom bustling around getting ready frantically. I was</B>
<P><B>downstairs in the bathroom that is directly under the one upstairs.</B>
<P><B>There is a vent that leads from the upstairs one to the downstairs

one.</B>
<P><B>I was getting ready to brush my teeth when suddenly I heard someone

hiss</B>
<P><B>my name a couple times. So obvious and not loud but not soft. Enough

to</B>
<P><B>make my head snap to attention and look up. I immediately looked to

the</B>
<P><B>air vent, because that's where it seemed to be coming from. It sort

of</B>
<P><B>sounded like my step-mom's voice, but it obviously wasn't, because

why</B>
<P><B>on earth would she take the time from being so busy to lean down into</B>
<P><B>the vent and hiss my name? Please. That in and of itself isn't

logical.</B>
<P><B>So I just stood there for a few seconds with the toothbrush in my

hand</B>
<P><B>and then threw it down and booked it upstairs, where I saw my family</B>
<P><B>still busily getting ready. I didn't tell any of them about it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>2.) The second experience also happened a long time ago. Now I can't</B>
<P><B>remember exactly how long ago. I was sleeping in my bed and at the

time</B>
<P><B>my bedroom door was open, allowing view out into the hallway and I

could</B>
<P><B>see from the angle my mom's closed bedroom door straight across.</B>
<P><B>Suddenly I opened my eyes for whatever reason and as soon as I opened

my</B>
<P><B>eyes I saw a white glob or white glowing mass in the air, reaching

out</B>
<P><B>for the doorknob of my mom's closed bedroom door. It was so obvious

and</B>
<P><B>so there! I only layed in awe and in a fraction of a second it</B>
<P><B>disappeared. Hhmmm.</B>
<P>
<P><B>3.) My old babysitter used to tell us about the house she used to

live</B>
<P><B>in. When she and her husband moved there it was all run-down and the</B>
<P><B>shutters were sideways and such. But they soon fixed it up and it was</B>
<P><B>pretty nice. Well, her husband worked the night shift and so she

would</B>
<P><B>fall asleep alone. But often she would be lying in bed and she would</B>
<P><B>hear a whistling voice slowly coming up the stairs. Oddly enough it</B>
<P><B>never scared her. It was rather peaceful. Or they would both find</B>
<P><B>newly-lit cigars in the basement in an ash tray. Also, I have seen
a</B>
<P><B>picture of her bedroom wall where green glob was dripping out and it</B>
<P><B>bothered her and so eventually she ended up putting a paper plate

over</B>
<P><B>it, and wallpapering it up! :) Also, once when she was home alone

with</B>
<P><B>her dog she heard her dog barking and went to see where he was--the</B>
<P><B>bathroom. Inside the bathroom she was astonished to find that the

entire</B>
<P><B>bathroom: the walls, the toilet, the sinks the counters, the floor

and</B>
<P><B>even the waste basket were all filled to the brim with water! What</B>
<P><B>caused that to happen? And also they would be watching television,

and</B>
<P><B>then would get up to leave and turn the tv off. Then it would flip

right</B>
<P><B>back on on its own accord--on a different channel! And it was always

a</B>
<P><B>sports channel so they assumed that that, mixed with the sound of the</B>
<P><B>whistling and the cigars in the basement, proved it was an elderly

man.</B>
<P><B>What do you think?</B>

<H3><A NAME=linken><B> Anabella Linken</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: jmbren@essex.ac.uk</B>
<P>
<P><B>My true story began with a simple fun rumour but soon turned out to

be</B>
<P><B>far more chilling than I had ever expected.</B>
<P><B>It all started with a story about a little girl called Anabella who

had</B>
<P><B>fallen down the old stone steps of the "old building" in our school

many</B>
<P><B>years ago. People said her spirit still roamed this eerie building
we</B>
<P><B>all had to go into at school for various things. Being excitable

eleven</B>
<P><B>year olds a few of my friends and myself began playing around with

the</B>
<P><B>idea of this girl stuck in the old building. Often we'd find these</B>
<P><B>strange areas of wall covered in a bloodlike paint and we would say

it</B>
<P><B>was her blood when she fell. It was weird but I personally began to</B>
<P><B>become very obsessed with the idea of a ghost in the school. In lessons

I</B>
<P><B>would gaze out the windows to the dark looming buliding and try and</B>
<P><B>catch her face in the windows and sometimes I thought I could see a

girl</B>
<P><B>with long black hair and  a white sullen face.</B>
<P><B>This is when I began to get scared, I couldn't sleep at night and I</B>
<P><B>quite genuinely felt this spirits presence even when I was at home
at</B>
<P><B>night in bed, as though she were watching me or wanting a part of the</B>
<P><B>childhood she could never have. I never had nightmares but strange</B>
<P><B>things would happen to me to make me feel "she" was there, of lurking</B>
<P><B>quite literally behind me. I am now twenty years old and I still feel</B>
<P><B>afraid at night. Me and my friends messing around in that building

and</B>
<P><B>wanting to see a ghost has caused me to be haunted ever since.</B>
<P><B>Recently my father, who claims to be sensitive to spirits said when

he</B>
<P><B>went to the same school as a boy he sensed a very strong negative

force</B>
<P><B>in the building but refused to ever tell me when I was young. He said

it</B>
<P><B>was focused around an old trap door at the top of the building and

that</B>
<P><B>something sinister may have happened there, perhaps in connection

with</B>
<P><B>the lost girl anabella, this is all such a mystery to me even now I

do</B>
<P><B>not know the truth of what happened all I know is that it is often
not a</B>
<P><B>good idea to involve yourself in these things because us mortals do</B>
<P><B>have control over how it will affect us.</B>

</H3><P><B>By: Mrmeal2@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>     This really happened to my family and I in the mid 80s.I was about
15 at </B>
<P><B>the time and two siblings.Steve 17 and Val 4. My stepdad was at work
and my </B>
<P><B>mother was watching t.v. with us that evening in the livingroom. I
was laying </B>
<P><B>on the floor and everyone else was on the couch. I remember hearing
a sound </B>
<P><B>like air was being let out of something and then suddenly the door
to the </B>
<P><B>living room slammed shut.This door is not on springs it will only close
if </B>
<P><B>someone shuts it and it was wide open at the time. Anyway we all jumped
to our </B>
<P><B>feet and my brother ran into the kitchen and grabbed a knife and told
my mom </B>
<P><B>and sis to stay on the couch. Steve and I opened the door and ran

throughout </B>
<P><B>the house not finding anything. We then went back to the living room
where my </B>
<P><B>mom and sis were and asked if they saw anyone or heard anyone run by
while we </B>
<P><B>were running throughout. Just then we heard something from the celler
. This </B>
<P><B>time my mother ran to the phone as my brother (as nuts as he is ) went

</B>
<P><B>downstairs into the basement. Its not a big basement and he saw nothing.
As </B>
<P><B>he entered the upstairs my mother asked if anyone was down there as
she held </B>
<P><B>the phone. I kept saying "call the police..call the police." and as
I did we </B>
<P><B>heard noises from outside in the garage. The garage is not attached
to the </B>
<P><B>house so we didnt know what was going on. A few minutes went by and

everything </B>
<P><B>was calm and my mother started to explain. We all knew our first father

</B>
<P><B>passed away from a heart attack in the garage in 1972. She told us
weeks after </B>
<P><B>his death she would hear things clang in the sink. He use to throw
his spoon </B>
<P><B>into the sink after eating cereal and stuff and made a game out of
reaching </B>
<P><B>the sink. He always told my mom if he ever died he would come back
to scare </B>
<P><B>her. He was only kidding of course .So we thought. She also saw shadows
and </B>
<P><B>pictures on the walls would suddenly be crooked.Sometimes they fell.
In fact </B>
<P><B>the first time my wife (girlfriend at the time) came over I told her
the </B>
<P><B>story outside before we went in. The minute we went to go upstairs
a picture </B>
<P><B>fell from the wall. Also weeks after that night, Christmas morning
my brother, </B>
<P><B>mother, and I waited for my stepdad and sister to come downstairs to
open the </B>
<P><B>gifts. As we looked through our stocking stuffers and talked we heard

someone </B>
<P><B>coming down the stairs. But there was no-one there and the steps walked

past </B>
<P><B>us and smelt like flowers. We all looked at each other a smiled we
knew that </B>
<P><B>was our Dad. Well ever since the last picture falling off the wall
which was </B>
<P><B>about 5 and a half years ago I don't think anything else has happened.
I ask </B>
<P><B>my mother from time to time.</B>

</H3><P><B>By: Robin121@cwcom.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was about three in the morning when I found myself waking from a

deep</B>
<P><B>sleep. I live in an old victorian servants room, just outside London.

As</B>
<P><B>I woke I noticed a large white mass in front of me slightly to my

right,</B>
<P><B>as I only had my eyes slightly open I thought at first it was my

duvets</B>
<P><B>that had bunched up during the night, but when I fully stretched out

mu</B>
<P><B>arm to pull them towards me,my hand swiped through the mass and as
my</B>
<P><B>vision became clear I saw a woman's face starirng over me towards a</B>
<P><B>small stained glass window I have on my left. At that point she

slowly</B>
<P><B>faded away and then the shock hit me. With 2 duvets pulled up around

me,</B>
<P><B>I was in a hot sweat with shock, but my ears and nose were icy cold,

it</B>
<P><B>took me 3/4 of an hour to allow myself to move.</B>

<H3><A NAME=toy><B>The Toy Room</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: gary@dervish1.freeserve.co.uk</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am not sure whether this is actually a </B>
<P><B>supernatural occurence or not, but when I was five years old, we used
to live in </B>
<P><B>a different house. I was (and still am) an only child, and there were

</B>
<P><B>three bedrooms. I got two of them, one for my toys, and the other for
me </B>
<P><B>to sleep in. Don't ask why this was the arrangement, I don't know to
this </B>
<P><B>day. I just know that one of the bedrooms, the one with toys in, was
</B>
<P><B>bigger than the other by a huge margin. we could only fit a bed in
the </B>
<P><B>other one, and that is where I slept. Strangely though, not where my
</B>
<P><B>experience occured.</B>
<P><B>I had previously chosen the little bedroom to </B>
<P><B>sleep in, for whatever reason sprang into my mind long ago. About two

</B>
<P><B>months after we moved into this house, my cousin told me a ghost story,

which </B>
<P><B>was to be the basis for my whole interest into the supernatural, but
that is </B>
<P><B>another matter.</B>
<P><B>When we were in that house, I never used to like </B>
<P><B>to get my toys, and it was always a little colder than the rest of
the </B>
<P><B>house. When I lay in bed at night in the other bedroom, I used to hear

</B>
<P><B>things sometimes move, as if being pushed. But how much does a little

</B>
<P><B>child who has been told a ghost story imagine I hear you say?</B>
<P><B>Well let me tell you that after we moved (about </B>
<P><B>3 years later) my mother told me that it was in fact colder in the
room, and she </B>
<P><B>did not like it in there either. That seemed kind of strange to me,
as I </B>
<P><B>led myself to believe that it was just my imaginings, being young and

</B>
<P><B>impressionable as I was.</B>
<P><B>The story that I was told which made me </B>
<P><B>most scared was about a man who lived near a grave yard. Every night,
the </B>
<P><B>faces of the teeming dead would visit his very bedroom wall, and wail
in </B>
<P><B>pain......If you want to hear the full story then email me. </B>

</H3><P><B>By: jheermann@mfi.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>    Well, here's another one of those ghost stories for you to post,

if</B>
<P><B>you feel it's worthy.  It might not be as spectacular as some of

them,</B>
<P><B>but it was pretty exciting when it was all going on...

Congratulations</B>
<P><B>on the site, by the way, it's all most interesting.</B>
<P>
<P><B>    Though I've been in quite a few (supposedly) haunted houses where</B>
<P><B>friends or relatives lived, I've only lived in one for about a year.</B>
<P><B>All the strange occurrences ceased only a couple months after they</B>
<P><B>began, but I still have some vivid memories of it all.</B>
<P><B>    It began in August of 1992, when I was 22.  I  moved to San</B>
<P><B>Francisco from California's Central Valley, and took up residence in

a</B>
<P><B>large, pre-1906 quake Victorian that had been divided into three

large</B>
<P><B>flats, each one occupying a full floor.  The upper flat was being</B>
<P><B>repaired by the landlord and wasn't available for rent, and the lower</B>
<P><B>flat was unoccupied.  I rented the middle flat with three friends of</B>
<P><B>mine, all of which were planning to move in a couple of weeks after
I</B>
<P><B>did (they were finishing summer school, taking vacations, etc.).  I

was</B>
<P><B>a little unnerved spending my first night in a new city alone in a</B>
<P><B>100-year-old building, but I made the move and started unpacking, and</B>
<P><B>settling into the new place.  Strange things started happening</B>
<P><B>immediately.</B>
<P><B>    The first couple of nights I had dreams that took place in the

flat,</B>
<P><B>that featured an older couple, and a very young boy and girl, that
I</B>
<P><B>took to be brother and sister.  They weren't really doing anything,

just</B>
<P><B>sort of standing in the long hallway, immobile.  I dismissed it as

the</B>
<P><B>result of stress, but later began to think that they were more real

than</B>
<P><B>characters in a dream.</B>
<P><B>    There were lots of problems with the lights in the house, but the</B>
<P><B>problems seemed to start when I walked into a room--the ceiling

fixture</B>
<P><B>would flicker and spark while I stood in whatever room it might have</B>
<P><B>been, and the moment I would step back out, the problem would stop.

 It</B>
<P><B>was actually kind of comical--one evening I was showering and the</B>
<P><B>bathroom light started acting  up.  I said aloud, "please stop, I

need</B>
<P><B>to take a shower", and it did.</B>
<P><B>    After a couple weeks, my other roommates moved in, and things

really</B>
<P><B>started picking up.  First, we began to hear footsteps coming from

the</B>
<P><B>supposedly vacant flat above us, at times of night when it was</B>
<P><B>impossible that they were workers or the landlord's handymen.  I

should</B>
<P><B>mention that this building was very secure with a sturdy gate and no</B>
<P><B>windows reachable from the street--there was definitely no one in the</B>
<P><B>building other than the four of us.</B>
<P><B>    Doors would open and close in the hallway, usually when one</B>
<P><B>particular roommate of mine was home.  People would see figures out

of</B>
<P><B>the corners of their eyes, only to find that no one was there. 

During</B>
<P><B>all of these occurrences I never had the feeling that there was any</B>
<P><B>malevolence to the "ghosts", just more that they were keeping an eye

on</B>
<P><B>the new tenants.</B>
<P><B>    All the weird goings-on stopped, ironically enough, on that</B>
<P><B>Halloween night.  At least, I didn't notice anything past that point,

so</B>
<P><B>I assume that whatever it was either got tired of us or was unable
to</B>
<P><B>communicate.  My roommates were all away, celebrating the holiday,
and a</B>
<P><B>couple friends of mine came by to visit.  I'd been home most of the</B>
<P><B>evening, and there was no one in the house other than myself and my</B>
<P><B>guests--I'm sure of it.  I started recounting the "supernatural"</B>
<P><B>occurrences in the flat, during which one of my friends asked if we

were</B>
<P><B>talking too loud and waking up any of my roommates.  I said that

there</B>
<P><B>wasn't anyone home.  At that point, one of the bedroom doors off the</B>
<P><B>hallway flung open (we heard it, rather than saw it), followed by the</B>
<P><B>front door and the metal gate across the porch.  There were no</B>
<P><B>footsteps, just the doors slamming open right after another.  After</B>
<P><B>that, as I said, I never noticed any weirdness (of the paranormal

kind)</B>
<P><B>around the house.</B>
<P><B>    I guess I got off pretty easily compared to some, but my

experiences</B>
<P><B>living in a haunted house weren't really traumatic--just kind of</B>
<P><B>intriguing.</B>

</H3><P><B>By: brendac@onlink.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a story my father swears by. He had just moved </B>
<P><B>us all to a rural community, just outside of the city he worked in,
when the </B>
<P><B>dreams started. At first he could not recall details, all he knew was
that </B>
<P><B>in them the same young child was present. It would be months before
he saw </B>
<P><B>her clearly. At first, she would stand at the edge of the bed; although

</B>
<P><B>she was only a few feet from him, he could barely see her. She would
just </B>
<P><B>stand there, unmoving and silent. The dream repeated this way and as
it </B>
<P><B>did his vision of her enhanced. He could now tell that she had dark
brown, </B>
<P><B>curly hair; which was tied back with a ribbon that was sliding out
of her </B>
<P><B>hair. She was wearing a pale blue dress, and was holding something
in her </B>
<P><B>hand. Although he was unsure if ever saw them clearly, he was sure
her </B>
<P><B>eyes were green.As the years went by, the dreams continued on a monthly

</B>
<P><B>and sometimes, weekly basis.</B>
<P><B>As she became clearer to him, he could see that her lips were </B>
<P><B>moving and from time to time he could hear a fragmented whisper of
what she was </B>
<P><B>saying. It would be another year before he could piece the sentences
</B>
<P><B>together.She was telling him that she was cold and covered in dirt.</B>
<P><B>She would often plead with him to find her father. She would tell him
that </B>
<P><B>she was afraid of the dark.My father became deeply troubled by the
</B>
<P><B>dreams. It never occurred to him that they could be anything else.
</B>
<P><B>This conviction did not change even when he felt a tugging at his blanket

and </B>
<P><B>she was there again, this time telling him that she was wet and covered
in </B>
<P><B>mud. This dream occurred during the worst rain storm, I can </B>
<P><B>remember.</B>
<P><B>We had been living here for nearly seven years when a water </B>
<P><B>line had to be routed as the earth around it was falling into the ever

expanding </B>
<P><B>lake. They feared that the exposed pipe would be vulnerable to </B>
<P><B>damage. Towards the end of that summer they had nearly finished digging

</B>
<P><B>the new line and where just a few yards from my house, when they came
upon a </B>
<P><B>starting discovery; the body of a small child. It was later determined

</B>
<P><B>that the body was that of a little girl, who was never identified.
In her </B>
<P><B>right hand, still clutched after so many years of death, was a wooden

handle of </B>
<P><B>a bag that had long since rotted away.</B>
<P><B>He confessed the dreams a few months later when several pints </B>
<P><B>of beer had loosened his tongue. He even confessed to having wondered
the </B>
<P><B>bush surrounding our house in search of ... </B>
<P><B>something. </B>

<H3><A NAME=black><B>The Black Figure</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: bentley@sweetwater.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well I guess the first thing I will let you know is my first

experience</B>
<P><B>with ghost was back in 1980,  from then on I have had several

Encounters</B>
<P><B>with them . I was not one to even think  of ghost , I never had any</B>
<P><B>experiences with them when I was a child , my parents never really</B>
<P><B>mentioned anything about ghost . In 1987 I had bought my own house
,</B>
<P><B>which I was very proud of , since I  was divorced and was raising my

5</B>
<P><B>children alone. It was a two story , three bedroom house , we loved

it</B>
<P><B>.  I had dated a year and a little after that year we got married ,

well</B>
<P><B>even before we got married I had started experienceing  some things

in</B>
<P><B>my house , Our dog would bark at the bathroom , like he was going to</B>
<P><B>kill something , he would stand right outside the bathroom door, I

would</B>
<P><B>go and look in to see what he was barking at ,but nothing would be</B>
<P><B>there, nothing  that I could see anyway..  We would hear  walking at</B>
<P><B>night ,  I started smelling a foul smell , like some dead carcess,

but</B>
<P><B>just in my bedroom  at night ..  then one day while I was home alone

I</B>
<P><B>went into the bathroom and I started smelling it in the bathroom ..

That</B>
<P><B>really puzzled me for it to be in the bathroon because  I slept in
a</B>
<P><B>waterbed and when I would be in the bed I thought " maybe it was a

mouse</B>
<P><B>that might have gotten under the bed and died , so when I would smell

it</B>
<P><B>while I was in bed I would think ," I am going to have to take this

bed</B>
<P><B>apart in the morning and find what has died under my bed . So it was

to</B>
<P><B>my surprise that I smelt it in the bathroom that day . Of course the</B>
<P><B>smell would always be gone in the morning , so I never did take my

bed</B>
<P><B>apart ,actually the smell would be there for a while and then just
go</B>
<P><B>away and then return , it was a smell that would just come and go,
 I</B>
<P><B>never thought of it being a ghost .. Then one night , my husband and

I</B>
<P><B>went to bed , I had the hall light on and the door  just barely open.

I</B>
<P><B>woke up to see a black figure standing on my husband side of the bed

,</B>
<P><B>at first I thought  " oh it is my imagination , it will dissapear any</B>
<P><B>second now ". So I kept watching it  and  it looked like his hand was</B>
<P><B>extended out to me , pointing  at me . He wouldn't  ever dissapear,
I</B>
<P><B>was really scared at that point because I thought " We must have left</B>
<P><B>one of the doors unlocked and someone came in and he is pointing a

gun</B>
<P><B>at me , and thats why he has his arm extended out to me , he is

holding</B>
<P><B>a gun !!! I can't explain the fear that came over me , I was awake
, I</B>
<P><B>know I was awake , to much time had gone by . I knew I had to do</B>
<P><B>something  before he pulled the trigger , so I started screaming ,
but I</B>
<P><B>never took my eyes off of him . Of course that brought my husband out

of</B>
<P><B>a good sleep , he jumped straight up , in a set up position , and as

he</B>
<P><B>came up I watched the figure go down on his side of the bed .. It

didn't</B>
<P><B>squat down , but how can I explain it in words ?? The same way my</B>
<P><B>husbands body came up in bed is how that black figure  went down..
I was</B>
<P><B>still screaming at this point , my husband jumped out of bed and

flipped</B>
<P><B>on the light , I was yelling  " he's on the floor, on your side of

the</B>
<P><B>bed !!! A man , on the floor !!!  I  think  my  husband thought I was</B>
<P><B>crazy ,he looked and no one was there, I got up and looked  to make</B>
<P><B>sure  because I had never took my eyes off of him . After we had

calmed</B>
<P><B>down I cuddled up to my husband but everytime I would start to fall</B>
<P><B>asleep I would feel this dark evil coming over me , needless to say
I</B>
<P><B>did not sleep much that night . That was not to be the last time I

had</B>
<P><B>see that black figure ,  It did continue into another house we bought

,</B>
<P><B>and we have had many more experiences , but this is the  one I will</B>
<P><B>share with you at this time ..Thanks for listening. </B>

<H3><A NAME=palace><B> Spinola Palace</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: sylvana@farsons.com.mt</B>
<P>
<P><B>Malta is very well known to have many haunted places.  Personally,
I </B>
<P><B>never believed in any of them.  Many fortifications in Malta date back

</B>
<P><B>to 1568, at the time of the Knights of St. John.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One particular experience which made me a believer was when I worked
</B>
<P><B>as a secretary to a parliamentary minister in Palazzo Spinola in 1987.

</B>
<P><B> This Palace had incredibly high steps and too much of them! It was
</B>
<P><B>being used as a Government Property for offices.  It was built about
</B>
<P><B>1657 and was used at the time as the Governor's residence and prisons

</B>
<P><B>for the Spanish Inquisition.  Mayor torture there was to be tied to
</B>
<P><B>the walls from the wrists by chains for life.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway, it was summer and a hot one indeed.  One evening I remained
</B>
<P><B>working late and alone on the third floor of the Palace.  There was
</B>
<P><B>only myself and the Minister's messenger at the Reception on the first

</B>
<P><B>floor.  While typing, I heard very clearly my name being called from
</B>
<P><B>the forth floor.  Tony (the messenger) was downstairs I was positive.

</B>
<P><B> I looked around and concluded that probably I was hearing things.
 I </B>
<P><B>finished all pending work, closed all huge heavy wooden windows </B>
<P><B>(windows were kept identical to the antique style due to historical
</B>
<P><B>value).</B>
<P>
<P><B>I then locked all drawers and kept the key for security reasons, took

</B>
<P><B>all the papers and personal items and went downstairs to wait for the

</B>
<P><B>minister to arrive.  Tony was still at the reception.  We chatted for

</B>
<P><B>quite a while, when all of a sudden we felt cold.  Summer in Malta
</B>
<P><B>feels like hell; not even a breeze.  So you can imagine what a dash
of </B>
<P><B>freezing air would feel like in 39C temperature.  Then all of a </B>
<P><B>sudden, we heard all the windows bang open, a great riot of noises
as </B>
<P><B>if hell broke loose, The drawers which I had previously locked were
</B>
<P><B>also being banged shut with great force.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It sounded like there was something or someone very angry upstairs
and </B>
<P><B>kept banging furiously.  Tony looked at me and asked me if I had </B>
<P><B>locked everywhere?  I confirmed and the noise was still going on. </B>
<P><B> There was no wind to clap those windows in that way, besides, I had
</B>
<P><B>closed them all!  We ran outside and confirmed that all windows were
</B>
<P><B>closed.  I asked Tony to come with me upstairs.  He didn't like the
</B>
<P><B>idea, but we went up the stairs slowly approaching the noise. </B>
<P><B>Everything was very quiet suddenly and yes all drawers and things were

</B>
<P><B>in order.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had to leave the place after a couple of months.  I kept hearing
</B>
<P><B>noises from particular rooms.  My job involved working overtime alone

</B>
<P><B>and I couldn't make it anymore.</B>

found </B>

<H3><A NAME=college><B>College Apartment</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: ace9@epix.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>    I have had an experience with the supernatural.  In 1996 my

cousin,</B>
<P><B>myself, and two friends rented an apartment in our town.  We were in</B>
<P><B>college at the time and basically just happy to be on our own.  A few</B>
<P><B>months after we moved in another friend of mine told me that she was

in</B>
<P><B>a bind and asked if she could move in.  I better explain the layout

of</B>
<P><B>the apartment.  We were renting from a man who had a business on the</B>
<P><B>first floor, so the majority of our rooms were on the second floor.

 The</B>
<P><B>entrance was on the first floor.  Our kitchen was the only room on

the</B>
<P><B>first floor.  We kept a sofa in the kitchen for guests.  From the</B>
<P><B>kitchen the stairs led up to a main hallway.  To the left was a</B>
<P><B>bedroom(mine which I shared with another roommate) and the bathroom.

 To</B>
<P><B>the right was another bedroom off of the hall(which was occupied by

my</B>
<P><B>cousin and our other roommate).  At the end of the hall to the right

was</B>
<P><B>the living room.  As you can see there was not much room for another</B>
<P><B>person.  However, I did have a gigantic walk-in closet off of my</B>
<P><B>bedroom.  It was one of those old cedar closets that people used to

keep</B>
<P><B>their furs in.  Anyway, I told my friend that she could move into

this</B>
<P><B>closet.  Everything went well until...</B>
<P><B>    One night I  woke up for no particular reason in the middle of

the</B>
<P><B>night.  I was startled by the appearance of a small child sized

figure</B>
<P><B>standing at the foot of my bed.  This figure seemed to be looking in

at</B>
<P><B>my friend who was sleeping in her closet.  I passed it off as one of</B>
<P><B>those half asleep deals and rolled over to enjoy the rest of my

nights</B>
<P><B>sleep.  In the morning my roommate who had been living in the closet</B>
<P><B>very anxiously shook me until I was awake.  She told me this story
of</B>
<P><B>how she saw a figure standing in front of my bed looking in at her.</B>
<P><B>(Wow, I just got a major chill writing that sentence!)  I was

shocked.</B>
<P><B>I told her that I had seen the same figure that she described.  We</B>
<P><B>relayed the information to our other roommates, but they did not

believe</B>
<P><B>us until...</B>
<P><B>    Strange things began to occur following the sighting.  One day
I was</B>
<P><B>home alone.  I decided to take a shower.  I have this habit of always</B>
<P><B>locking the bathroom door behind me.  Well, when I turned off the

water</B>
<P><B>and opened the curtain the water in the sink was running full blast

from</B>
<P><B>both faucets.  Another time two of my roommates and I came home to

find</B>
<P><B>my cousin nervously smoking cigarettes and drinking a beer.  He said</B>
<P><B>that he was sitting there watching TV when, all of a sudden, every

door</B>
<P><B>on the second floor slammed shut.  He thought it may have been the</B>
<P><B>wind.  He proceeded to go along the hallway opening all of the doors.</B>
<P><B>As soon as he sat back down all of the doors immediately slammed shut</B>
<P><B>again.  That left only one roommate who had not experienced the</B>
<P><B>phenomenon.  Well, one evening while getting ready to go out, he got</B>
<P><B>his.  I had finished getting ready before him.  I entered the living</B>
<P><B>room and began to watch TV with my other roommates.  Suddenly he

entered</B>
<P><B>and asked me why I walked away without answering him.  I had no idea</B>
<P><B>what he was talking about.  He said that while he was in his closet</B>
<P><B>searching for clothing someone who he assumed was me came in and

stood</B>
<P><B>in the doorway.  He had asked a question and the figure walked away.</B>
<P><B>The rest of us knew what it must have been considering that there was

no</B>
<P><B>one else present and we had been in the living room.  Now all of us

had</B>
<P><B>had an experience, but none of our other friends believed us.  We

began</B>
<P><B>to think that we were suffering from mass hysteria until..</B>
<P><B>    It started to happen.  One by one our house guests were becoming</B>
<P><B>freaked upon entering.  At first people would spend the night without</B>
<P><B>thinking twice, but now they were running home.  One night while one

of</B>
<P><B>my friends was sleeping in the living room he woke the whole house
up</B>
<P><B>because he was terrified.  He told of a cold feeling that overcame

the</B>
<P><B>room, and how no matter what he did he could not get warm.  He said

that</B>
<P><B>he heard the light switch in the hallway continually flip on and off,</B>
<P><B>but the light never came on.  He said that he heard sounds coming

from</B>
<P><B>the kitchen downstairs.  He described them as sounding like someone</B>
<P><B>washing the dishes and banging them together.  Needless to say he

never</B>
<P><B>stayed the night again.  On another occasion we had a guest sleeping

in</B>
<P><B>the kitchen on the before mentioned sofa.  We awoke in the morning
to</B>
<P><B>find him gone.  He called later that day and described how he saw a</B>
<P><B>figure moving about the kitchen.  He high tailed it out of there! 

The</B>
<P><B>last experience that I feel needs mentioning is the pill box

incident.</B>
<P><B>One evening while everyone else was asleep my cousin and I(we were

night</B>
<P><B>owls by this point) were sitting in the living room watching a movie.</B>
<P><B>My cousin had a cold and had just taken some over the counter</B>
<P><B>medication.  He set the box flat side down on the end table and sat

to</B>
<P><B>watch the movie.  I specifically remember this because he had just

asked</B>
<P><B>me something about the medication(I am a nurse).  All of a sudden

there</B>
<P><B>was a strange noise.  We both heard it but could not distinguish what

it</B>
<P><B>was.  After searching the room I noticed the box of pills standing
on</B>
<P><B>its side wobbling back and forth as if it had not had time to

completely</B>
<P><B>balance yet.  We looked at each other and shook our heads.</B>
<P><B>    As you can see the spirit never harmed anyone.  It was more</B>
<P><B>playful.  Almost as if it just wanted to let us know that it was

there.</B>
<P><B>Strange occurrences continued until we moved out a year later.  We

tried</B>
<P><B>unsuccessfully to research the history of the house. Nobody seemed
to</B>
<P><B>know anything about the family who had lived there before us.  My</B>
<P><B>experiences during the time that I lived there made me believe that</B>
<P><B>there is something that is worth further investigation.  I never

doubt</B>
<P><B>anyone when they tell me about an experience that they had which they</B>
<P><B>could not explain.</B>

<P>
<P><B>Hello my name is Simon I live in a city a little north of NYC</B>
<P><B>It was about 4 years ago when I used to live in my old apartment

building,</B>
<P><B>it was a small apartment, me and my sister had to sleep on pull out
beds in </B>
<P><B>the living room. </B>
<P><B>one night I heard noises in the kitchen that woke me up</B>
<P><B>it was the sound of something opening like a plastic bag or

something,</B>
<P><B>at first I thought it was my hamsters scratching or running in the
wheel but </B>
<P><B>when I looked at them they were all curled up and asleep. </B>
<P><B>then I thought it was my mom or dad so I rolled over to see what it
was </B>
<P><B>because from the living room I had a pretty good look into the kitchen,

when </B>
<P><B>I rolled over I saw a bright human shaped figure, it was a transparent

white </B>
<P><B>but not blinding bright, I could tell it was transparent because I
could </B>
<P><B>still see the painting that hung on the wall, it was about 6 feet tall
or so </B>
<P><B>and looked to be the shape of an adult male. When I saw it I didn't
know what </B>
<P><B>to do, I couldn't makeout the face, all I saw on its face was where
the eyes </B>
<P><B>were, or should be, in fright when I saw it I sat up in my bed and
tried to </B>
<P><B>call for my mom or dad but nothing could come out but a slight whimper,
I </B>
<P><B>guess it heard me because when I made the noise its head whipped over
in my </B>
<P><B>direction, then it moved with amazing speed into the rest of the kitchen

</B>
<P><B>where I couldn't see from my bed view and then it looked like it was

floating </B>
<P><B>because I couldn't make out any leg movement but it floated in my direction

</B>
<P><B>very fast and just went right through the wall, I dropped into my bed
still </B>
<P><B>unable to speak and pulled the covers over my head and I didn't get
a wink of </B>
<P><B>sleep all night, every noise I heard would wake me.</B>
<P><B>The next day when I was coming up the hill from school there was alot
of </B>
<P><B>police cars in front of my house and an ambulance, my sister and I
went to </B>
<P><B>ask what was going on and they had said the super (the guy that does
all the </B>
<P><B>work in the building that's hired by the land lord) was shot in the
back of </B>
<P><B>his head in the underground garage, I didn't think much of it until
I </B>
<P><B>rememberd the other night and it scared the hell out of me.</B>

<P><B>this story until I seen the lists. Well...me and me cuz was upstair

at</B>
<P><B>her grandmas house listening to music. About 20 years ago,I had a

little</B>

she</B>
<P><B>had passed away before I was born. Well,to mine and my cuzs

 suspense,we</B>
<P><B>pulled the chest out of the closet. We did not know what was in</B>
<P><B>it.then,we went down stairs to try and find the key. It was only me

and</B>
<P><B>my cuz and her grandma in the house. Her grandma was with us and we</B>
<P><B>couldn't find the key. Well...her grandma told us not to mess with

that</B>
<P><B>chest because it was our little cousins(the one who died)clothes in</B>
<P><B>it. We were totally shocked so we went up stairs to put it back and

the</B>
<P><B>chest was already put back in the closet the exact same way we found</B>
<P><B>it. The blankets and everything was put back on top of it.I suppose

<P>
<P><B>it was a few years ago,I was in 3rd grade. I was at my friends home
at a </B>
<P><B>slumber party. I was never at her house before,even though she just
lived up </B>
<P><B>the street. Well once I was in her house it felt...different like something

in </B>
<P><B>the air wasn't right. Even though it was before I knew anything about

ghosts I </B>
<P><B>had a gut feeling that it was haunted. In the middle of the night when
we </B>
<P><B>were talking we heard the water running(we were of course telling what

</B>
<P><B>else,ghosts stories so we were freaked out)so we had a few of us check
it </B>
<P><B>out,I was among the group who checked it out. When we were there we
saw the </B>
<P><B>water running without anybody there,then all of a sudden it turned
off. We ran </B>
<P><B>into the room and told everyone,we couldn't get to sleep. Throughout
the night </B>
<P><B>we heard bells ring and glasses drop,one girl said it could be the
pets,but </B>
<P><B>there were no pets. Then one girl and I saw a hand go through the door.
We </B>
<P><B>screamed and it went away. For the rest of the night we heard all these

noises </B>
<P><B>and did not get to sleep till dawn when we got up we saw bells on the

</B>
<P><B>floor,and two glasses broken on the kitchen floor.</B>

I</B>
