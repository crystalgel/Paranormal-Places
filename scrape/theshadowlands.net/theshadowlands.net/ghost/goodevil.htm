I feel the need to clarify the good/evil issue even further than I already
have.&nbsp; I thought I was clear on my beliefs and opinions but I see
the need to explain them again.&nbsp; I believe that there are good spirits
and evil ones.&nbsp; I base this on experience, research and other related
beliefs.&nbsp; I also believe the&nbsp; vast majority of hauntings and
ghostly encounters are NOT evil in nature.&nbsp; I believe that it is not
often that these evil entities interact with humans and we should not be
obsessed or overly concerned with them.&nbsp; I simple ask that you be
aware that they do exist and take precautions if you feel the need to as
I do.&nbsp; I don't know how to be clearer.&nbsp; My experience with this
type was one of these rare instances.&nbsp; Even though I had this experience
(only one of my many encounters with ghosts was definitely this type) I
still continue to research ghosts and now even hunt them to understand
them better.&nbsp; Should you continue to research, hunt or live with ghosts?&nbsp;
Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you encounter a evil entity by ghost hunting or encounter
one in a haunting?&nbsp; It's unlikely but there is a chance.&nbsp; Maybe
this is a bit clearer than before.&nbsp; Below is the original article
appearing on the page.</B>

<P><B>Recently it has come to my attention that there are many ghost hunters
and&nbsp; investigators,&nbsp; as well as some of you reading this now,&nbsp;
do not believe that there is such a thing as an "evil ghost".&nbsp; To
answer this we first must look at what a ghost is so read my types of ghost
page first.</B>

<P><B>Now I want all of you to look at these pictures of ghosts below:</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Is it a good ghost or a bad ghost, an earthbound human spirit or
a non human entity?</B>

<P><B>I can't tell either.&nbsp; There are a few groups out there that
are telling you that there are absolutely no evil spirits, and that there
are no pictures of one.&nbsp; I'm not sure how they can tell from looking
at the psychic photos of ectoplasm and orbs which ones are or which ones
are not evil spirits.&nbsp; I say that some of these pictures show non
human entities as well as human spirits.&nbsp; Granted, there are far more
pictures showing human spirits than demonic ones, but no one, just looking
at a picture alone, can tell what type of spirit it is.&nbsp; You need
to investigate the ghost further before making that conclusion.</B>

<P><B>I know the demonic spirits exist, I've seen them.&nbsp;<I> Keep in
mind that they are rarely encountered by humans.&nbsp;</I> I lived in a
haunted house for 29 years, 26 of which I was experiencing ghosts and paranormal
phenomenon.&nbsp; Of that 26 years, only 3 years involved possible contact
with non human spirits.&nbsp; In that 3 three years, there was only one
night I can definitely say it was, without a doubt, an evil spirit. The
other spirits during those bad periods could have been either type, a mischievous
human spirit or a non human one.&nbsp; The other 23 years was an earthbound
spirit haunting.&nbsp; At the time I didn't understand the difference and
I was scared of both.&nbsp; Knowing what I do now, I realize that the earthbound
spirit was just getting my attention, saying hi and being playful.&nbsp;
I was scared and didn't know what to do, I asked it to leave and it did.&nbsp;
I then began to research and learn a bit more about ghosts and thought
it was looking for my help, so being the "expert" from reading a little,
I asked the spirit to come back, and it did, but not alone.&nbsp; Other
earthbound human spirits any a non human one came in too.&nbsp; My lack
of knowledge and understanding had opened the door too wide and caught
the attention of a demonic spirit.&nbsp; This is why I tell all of you
to learn from experienced investigators, go with experienced ghost hunting
groups and read all you can before you try this on your own.&nbsp; You
don't necessary want any more human spirits in your home and you really
don't want anything else.&nbsp; Even with my 26 years of experience in
dealing with various hauntings in my parents home and experiences I have
had elsewhere since, I still am being trained by various groups to get
experience doing investigations with people who are experienced in conducting
this type of research properly and safely.</B>

<P><B>In conclusion, if demonic non human spirits do not exist, then I'm
crazy.&nbsp; It would also mean that the Warrens (Ed Warren is a demonologist)
have wasted their lives fabricating stories.&nbsp; Oh, and The Catholic
Church fakes exorcisms and The Bible is incorrect.&nbsp; Still think there
are no such things as demons?&nbsp; Think again.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Keep
in mind thought that this type accounts for a small amount of hauntings
so you probably will never deal with one.</B>

<P><B>I liked your twin monologues on evil spirits and their rarity. I've
been</B>
<BR><B>involved with many, many years of hauntings and other experiences
(about 20</B>
<BR><B>years), and I can also say that there's only one time, in two separate</B>
<BR><B>encounters, that I met something definitely evil (and I had the
fortune to</B>
<BR><B>be on the periphery of the events). Further, I liked how you explained
that</B>
<BR><B>fear can often mislead you to thinking something or someone is evil.</B><B></B>

<P><B>However, while you've done it twice, I would like to suggest further</B>
<BR><B>clarifying for people that they can meet a malignant spirit without
it being</B>
<BR><B>evil. I met a lot of normal, earth-bound spirits that were just
plain mean,</B>
<BR><B>either from their natural disposition or something stupid I'd done.
Hate,</B>
<BR><B>from an intangible source, can be just as bad as your own fear in
making you</B>
<BR><B>think something is evil. I can imagine many people are reading your
pages</B>
<BR><B>thinking "Just 'cause YOU haven't hit them doesn't mean they don't
exist.",</B>
<BR><B>while not thinking through what they experienced.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I personally have a continuous background fear of visual apparitions
(I have</B>
<BR><B>no idea why, since I have no fear at all of any other manifestations,</B>
<BR><B>including any that might interact with me physically), which has
on occasion</B>
<BR><B>led me to jump to conclusions. I realize that not everyone may be
as</B>
<BR><B>fearless when it comes to these matters, which led to this post.</B>
